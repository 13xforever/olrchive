Tonight, August 11th, 2013

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Could Valve finally be making a sequel with a 3 in it?

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
One department store ad teases a Vita price drop

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And is Amazon working on a new gaming console?

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Episode number 515 for this, August 11th, 2013

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here to talk about video games

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, gaming lulz, gaming...

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Insert whatever here

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
With my co-hosts, say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Hey how you doing?

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm unemployed again

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry to hear it, that's...

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I feel better about it once the situation became clearer to me

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I see, so it was one of those, maybe we are better off seeing other people

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Let's just put it this way, I don't want to work for a hypocritical conservative Christian company

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
That ruins other people's businesses

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Well it is important to, you know, work for an employer that you can kind of get behind their values and all that stuff

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
They had a really good environment there but once I found out a bit more about them

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I really started to feel very uncomfortable

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I was like, what's that sticker on your car? What's that equal mean?

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Oh it's for the human rights campaign, I support gay rights

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Oh! Next day, fired

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That's pretty much how it went

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm not laughing at you, I'm just laughing at the awkwardness of that

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It was quite awkward, that and also actually requesting the major Jewish holidays off that morning

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And they said, oh we made the decision this morning, you're just not a good fit

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Oh dear

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So I'm not actually openly accusing them of anything, I'm just saying that those are the circumstances

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Well you can just work for vognetwork.com full time

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You know what, if it paid me I would be really happy

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Except, oh yeah, there's that, sorry about that, we don't have a budget

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Oopsies

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Alright, say hello as well to Techmaster Loki

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You there, Loki?

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yeah

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What are you doing over there, Loki?

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I was pulling up my stories

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Oh, I see, trying to get prepared

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Now that's a little late, that's alright

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
How you doing, what's new?

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Not much, just, I was watching some

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
What was it, a...

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Mugen fighting thing

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yeah, I think it's coming up later in the show, right?

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yeah, so

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Alright

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It was pretty funny

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
A little obsession of yours through the past week or so?

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Nah, just the last couple days

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Way to kill some time

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yeah, so any big personal news you might want to share with listeners tonight?

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yeah, I guess

59
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So, we're having another child

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Congrats

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
In January

62
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
That's amazing, how many weeks along does that make, Nelly?

63
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
16, 17

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I guessed it on a show this morning

65
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
And one of the hosts announced that his wife's expecting

66
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So that's babies everywhere!

67
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yeah

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
For the record, I'm not pregnant

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Not yet, careful what you wish for

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
No, I'm gonna time against my biological clock

71
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm gonna sabotage that motherfucker

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm selling my ovaries

73
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
How much could you get for those?

74
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Actually about 10 grand each

75
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Alright, in all seriousness, Loki, congratulations to you and Mrs. Loki

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Thank you

77
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Good luck with all that

78
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Having another kid, it's gonna be a busy, busy household

79
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yep

80
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And there are some congrats being shown in our chat room

81
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

82
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network

83
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
vognetwork.com

84
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Again, that's vognetwork.com

85
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 Eastern on Sundays

86
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Lots of great podcasts for you to participate with

87
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And geeky content, including articles, audiobook reviews

88
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And movie reviews and movie rankings

89
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And lots of other fun stuff coming soon

90
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
VOG is gonna have a big presence at Dragon Con

91
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And I'm very excited about that

92
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
My first time in Atlanta

93
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So I hope to see some of you guys there

94
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Also joining us on the show tonight

95
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
We have a guest here

96
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
A frequent guest of the show

97
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It probably helps that, you know, the show's at his house too

98
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Everybody say hello to Alan Alchemy

99
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Hello

100
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
How you doing Alan?

101
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm great

102
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You're great

103
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I just want to make sure we can hear you tonight

104
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So how have you been lately?

105
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I've been alright

106
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yeah?

107
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Decided to finally guest on the show again after like a year

108
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Gracing us with your presence

109
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's appreciated

110
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Alright, what's new with you personally?

111
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Not much

112
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yeah?

113
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Usually when I'm either working, I work swing shift

114
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So I'll listen to OLR from work

115
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Or when I'm not working and you guys are all here doing the show

116
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'll kind of just play video games in the office

117
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Or fold laundry or just be domestic

118
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Yeah

119
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So I decided I'd sit in on the show tonight

120
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Okay

121
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Well, I know we're gonna talk about your gaming week a little bit later

122
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But like in general, what kind of games have you been catching up on lately?

123
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Most of the stuff, if it has a Steam trading card thing in it

124
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Then I've checked it out either a little bit

125
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Or you know that trick?

126
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
If you don't want to play the game, you can just let it run

127
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And then go take a shower, go watch TV and come back and have your cards drop

128
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So you got sucked into this whole Steam trading card thing too

129
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yes

130
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Like I did

131
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What's the allure of it?

132
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's just, it appeals to my sort of OCD completionist

133
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You know

134
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Yeah

135
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And the thing is, is you can earn each badge like five times

136
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So once you earn, once you go like, yeah, I got all the cards

137
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Clarity badge, okay, now do it again

138
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Steam's like, do it again

139
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Spend some, put some money in your wallet, buy the cards

140
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I am eligible for the booster packs for like I think 13 or 14 games

141
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And I still have about maybe 15, 16 more that I still need to play to get the things to drop

142
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Not a single booster pack yet

143
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yeah, I've not gotten anything either

144
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
But then again, I haven't really been playing much

145
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I got my second one yesterday

146
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Yeah, I'm pressed like a panini, I hate you

147
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I have a foil card for Saints Row the Third

148
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Oh nice, you can sell those for a little more money

149
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I forgot who I was talking to but someone needed all three of the only cards that I had

150
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So I'm just like, here take them

151
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Wait, how did you get a foil card if you haven't gotten any booster packs?

152
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I get, it was one of my randoms that guy

153
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Really? Oh, I didn't know that

154
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Those will drop, yeah

155
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Oh, okay, well that's never happened to me

156
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So that's something you have up on me

157
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
There you go

158
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
There you go

159
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
See, the problem is I don't know where to buy and sell those cards

160
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I don't know where that's

161
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's the community marketplace

162
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yeah, I have no idea how to get through that

163
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Oh, it's easy, it's, oh, believe me, they make it easy

164
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
We can show you

165
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's really a brilliant thing if you make about it

166
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And it totally plays to people like Alan, and myself admittedly

167
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Who have that OCD need to collect something

168
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Why?

169
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Cause you can

170
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Because

171
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Since we were playing earlier this week I thought I might actually have to get a hat

172
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And so

173
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Well, let's talk about some of the things that, you know, we were off last week because I was away at GamerX

174
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So let's, I want to talk about GamerX, but I want to talk about the other stuff that's gone on in the past couple weeks

175
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
One is that, I don't know how it happened

176
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Christopher

177
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Was it Christopher? I guess Christopher did kind of start

178
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Wasn't he doing like a review or something?

179
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yes, he wanted to review it for Horde House

180
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And to be fair, that was ActDeaf kind of poking at him

181
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Which he's been kind of poking all of us for a while going, hey, play Team Fortress 2

182
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Hey, play Team Fortress 2

183
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And then Phil from Koopa Club I think got in on that a little bit

184
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Hey, play Team Fortress 2

185
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Play it, do it, do it

186
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And finally Extro was like, fine, is it free?

187
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yes, I'll try it

188
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And so we all played one night on, I guess ActDeaf has this server, abandoned server he knew of

189
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So a bunch of us played on there and loved it

190
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
We had so much fun, like it was just so much fun just sitting there blowing people up

191
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And it was great because you don't have to worry that you're not good enough

192
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Or that people are going to yell

193
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It was just a lot of like-minded people having a good time just shooting the shit out of each other

194
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And I was like, oh, I got to get us a server

195
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
We need our own server

196
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
We need a VoG server for this

197
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
We have a Minecraft server sometimes

198
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Why can't we have a Team Fortress 2 server?

199
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
As a trial run

200
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yeah

201
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Test it out

202
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So I remembered I had like $100 sitting in a PayPal account somewhere I hadn't used

203
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So I was like, alright

204
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Oh, just a random $100 sitting aside

205
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
All my money

206
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
When he pointed it out, I was like, that must be nice

207
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Well, you know what though? It's the modern day equivalent of burying it in your backyard

208
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And I was like, you know you haven't been earning interest on that in a year and a half, it's been stuck in there

209
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Well, you know what? It came in awfully handy this week, didn't it?

210
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So I bought us a Team Fortress 2 server

211
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Actually, the server was only like $20

212
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So I got that, it's like a 12 person server

213
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And all of the information is available on our website, VoGnetwork.com

214
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Look at the forums and you can check out the information that's in the video games forum

215
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
All the info you need about the server is there

216
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You might need a little help with the password

217
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
But let me just remind you guys, we used to have a little mascot, a little ferret on the show

218
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That's on my bedside table sitting on Duffy's head

219
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Yes, DarkSakura abducted it

220
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It doesn't work anymore

221
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And no, I do not have the hero's cap, I need it

222
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Just in case you need that information when you look at the post

223
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And it is password protected, but if you ever check it out

224
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Like in your Steam client, you see a bunch of jerks on there with screen names that you don't recognize

225
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You should let Rob know and he can spin the password to something else

226
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Absolutely, because we want it to be the welcoming environment for people that are like

227
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I want to play Team Fortress 2, but I don't know anybody and I'm not very good at shooters

228
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
No one is really good at Team Fortress 2

229
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's too fast, it makes me feel old because I was the soldier class with the shotgun

230
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And I was in the same room with someone, strafing

231
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I couldn't hit someone with the shotgun

232
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And they killed me, I was like, I have a shotgun in your face, I can't hit you

233
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I feel a little silly that I'm just now getting into this game that's like, what, five years old?

234
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It came out with Orange Box, right?

235
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I think I played it a little bit on Orange Box on 360, but it's not even the same like now on PC

236
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It just feels so different

237
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I should probably play that, but I've had other things on my plate

238
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You also might get your little sicky-sick

239
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I feel like it plays most like OG Quake to me

240
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Although it's more cartoony

241
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Which, duh, it makes sense

242
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I mean, Team Fortress 1 was a Quake mod

243
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
The speed of it reminds me of Unreal Tournament

244
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Which I loved

245
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Oh yeah, that's true

246
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Definitely some more games throughout the week

247
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Alan and I would love to play tonight, but we have errands to run after the show

248
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
But that might not stop other people from playing after the show

249
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Active in our chatroom says Team Fortress 2 is around seven years old

250
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Oh my gosh, really? Holy moly

251
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Alright, speaking of other games and things

252
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Dark Soccer, well, I guess it's bugging out right now

253
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
But you were trying to open your Animal Crossing town for the first time

254
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I had three people in there and the connection crashed

255
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So I'm gonna open it one more time, but if it does it again

256
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'm gonna have to leave it closed for the rest of the show

257
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Because our primary concern is keeping our bandwidth open

258
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Yeah, it is, that is, so we don't want to

259
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
But it would be fun if you want to go visit Jamie

260
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You got the VOG pattern, right?

261
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I did, but it won't let me put it on, so I think I just have to recreate it

262
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Well, Bobby's pattern's probably better anyway, so

263
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Go get the one from his town

264
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
But no, I actually can't use something that I got from somebody else

265
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'll have to make it myself

266
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Dope

267
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's fine

268
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Alright, so there's that Animal Crossing going on

269
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And then Minecraft coming back at some point, right Loki?

270
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yeah, I want to get around to it

271
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Alright, so we want to know what other games should VOG have a server for?

272
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
We'll look into it if you have a serious request

273
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Something that we ought to check out, let us know

274
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Free to play is really good too

275
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
That's what makes Team Fortress 2 so great

276
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Because it's free to play

277
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And people even make a little money off it, right?

278
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Getting the item drops and crafting and all that

279
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I mean, not anything to write home about

280
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
But, you know, something to buy trading cards with, right?

281
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Alright, so we missed the show last week

282
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Because I was at GamerX

283
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And Alan was there with me

284
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Yay

285
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Which was great

286
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And if you haven't heard about GamerX

287
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Although I'm pretty sure I've talked about it ad nauseam on the show

288
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
GamerX was a Kickstarter backed convention

289
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
To really just be a safe place for GLBT gamers

290
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
But it's really important to know

291
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
The con was not only for GLBT gamers

292
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And I think I went on this tangent

293
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It might have been on Horde House

294
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
But it always pissed me off when I heard people going

295
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Well, where's our straight gamer convention?

296
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Why can't we have a straight gaming convention?

297
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And I'm like, well, okay

298
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
That's what YowieCon is for girls

299
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
When y'all are getting disowned by your parents

300
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And getting lost past in states that affect your lifestyle

301
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And people are bullying you

302
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And calling you names on Xbox Live

303
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Then you can have your little convention

304
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
But otherwise it's a 365 day a year convention

305
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
The point was not to be like

306
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Gaze only and everybody else get out

307
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It was to be a safe environment

308
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Just like I described the Team Fortress 2 server

309
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Is a safe environment for people

310
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Who are bad at Team Fortress 2

311
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's creating a safe place

312
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Where people are not gonna be screaming

313
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
FAG FAG N-word N-word

314
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's like, bro

315
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
When you play Halo and you have to turn off

316
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Everyone else's mics because you get sick and tired

317
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Of being called a breeder a hundred times a match

318
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Then come talk to us

319
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
We'll talk about a straight convention

320
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I don't think that's happening

321
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
The bullying is bad enough with gay, lesbian, and bisexual

322
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
And then throw transgender into it

323
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It was very eye-opening in some of those panels

324
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
To hear what transgendered people go through

325
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
In games and so forth

326
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It was really eye-opening

327
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I had a marvelous time at the convention

328
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It was honestly something I kind of never thought I would see

329
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
So it made me just very happy to be there

330
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I did have some small reservations

331
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It was a first-time con

332
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And so there were some first-time con issues

333
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
But I want to just make sure I am crystal clear

334
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It was really good for a first-year con

335
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Beyond really good

336
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
My minor issues were

337
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
One, the space was too damn small

338
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Although the Hotel Kabuki in San Francisco is lovely

339
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
And I loved that it was in Japantown

340
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
So all that stuff was nearby

341
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It was just a clusterfuck of people downstairs

342
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I actually had a panic attack from claustrophobia

343
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
That has never happened in my life

344
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
But because the lines were spiraling around

345
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And there were a few exits

346
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You were in a basement

347
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I just suddenly pictured

348
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
What happens if this place gets caught on fire?

349
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
And I literally had the whole high blood pressure

350
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And all that stuff

351
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I had to get out of there

352
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
So thankfully I did

353
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Once you could make it into a room

354
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Whether it was the exposition room

355
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Or the gaming room

356
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Or a panel room

357
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You were fine

358
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
But the people waiting in line

359
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Plus the through traffic

360
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Because people got to get from point A to point B

361
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
They don't give a shit about a panel

362
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Waiting in line if they're not interested in the panel

363
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
And the hallways for that

364
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Were only maybe two or three people wide

365
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
And the ceilings were really low

366
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Like only 10 or 11 feet

367
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
So it was really just claustrophobic and gloomy

368
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Which you know what?

369
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm sure when they looked at the space originally

370
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And kind of had their thought

371
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
What it was going to be in their head

372
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
What a terrible problem to have

373
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
That your con is too popular

374
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
So next year

375
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
They have said it's coming back next year

376
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And I'm pretty sure they said

377
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
They are looking into a bigger space

378
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Although I don't know if that necessarily meant

379
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
They were looking at a different space

380
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I kind of got the feeling that they might just spread it out more

381
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I don't know

382
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
We'll see

383
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
The Hotel Kabuki has hosted different cons before

384
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And what they count on I think

385
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Is that a lot of that traffic is going to start going into the Kintetsu Mall

386
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
To go shopping at Kinokuniya

387
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Or go get crepes or whatever

388
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Maybe they'll spread it out across different hotels

389
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
And Japan Video really likes it

390
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Because they do a lot of business during that

391
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Oh yeah

392
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It was great

393
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
The environment was great

394
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
The Japanese street fair was going on

395
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
The overflow for the con

396
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Was always in that mall

397
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
So yeah it was already kind of a part of the circuit

398
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
So my other bit of creative feedback

399
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Would be that Alan and I went to the Friday night party

400
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Which was for the VIP Kickstarter folks

401
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Because yeah I did kickstart a bit of money into this

402
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Because I really wanted to see it happen

403
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
So we went to the Friday VIP party

404
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Which was fine

405
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Music talent was great

406
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Let's say that

407
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Music talent was great

408
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I know some of VX JasonXV's friends were

409
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
They had a Chiptunes DJ

410
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
That sounds cool

411
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Yeah they were really good

412
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
But the host of the evening was Pandora Box

413
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And she was a contestant on RuPaul's Drag Race

414
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Full disclosure I loved her

415
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Rooted for her all through that season

416
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Ditto

417
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
And I've even

418
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
On the fun little side project

419
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
RuPaul's Drag Race podcast I did with the Game Buoy guys

420
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I even defended her many times

421
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
And I do love her and follow her on Facebook

422
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
But maybe Alan you can describe this better than I can

423
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
What the issue was with Pandora

424
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Well you know it's supposed to be an inclusive convention

425
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
A lot of people had aired concerns online

426
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
That it was just going to be a bunch of white gay dudes

427
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Because that's what San Francisco is really

428
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And we were going to shut out the BLT portion of the convention

429
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
So she gets up there

430
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
And within like a minute she's talking about

431
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
There are lesbians play video games?

432
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Ew I don't like vagina

433
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
And everyone's laughing

434
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Once I was born and fell out of one I was done

435
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
And it's like okay gay men don't like pussy

436
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
That's your joke

437
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Which is like really insulting

438
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I hate when I hear my peers say it

439
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It's like really?

440
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Yeah and then she was kind of going after the nerd thing too

441
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Like oh yay we're having this convention

442
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You guys can get out of your basement for the first time in a year

443
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And I'm just kind of like

444
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I don't know I'm torn because I understand

445
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I understand drag queens are supposed to be bitchy

446
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Like that's their whole thing

447
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
You know so I should just like kind of roll my eyes and do whatever

448
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It's like a big roast

449
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Haha nerds in basement that's the first time I've ever heard that joke

450
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Exactly yeah that's totally original

451
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I was just kind of like

452
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Dude you are like the first thing

453
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
At the first con

454
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Of this first great thing

455
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
And that's what you're going to do with it?

456
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And everyone in that room had donated

457
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm sorry it was 100 bucks right?

458
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Yeah something like that

459
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
So I was just a little bit like

460
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And then she started talking about Grindr

461
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Nerds are introverts here all on Grindr right now

462
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And it's like they'd probably be on Grindr anyway

463
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Haha you're on Grindr bitch

464
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Haha

465
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
So I don't know I just was kind of

466
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I was over her

467
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It wasn't the best

468
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I wasn't a fan of her I didn't like go home and unfollow her on Facebook

469
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Or something I was so mad

470
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
But I was just like that was a little lazy

471
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Her cosplay was good

472
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
That I'm sure her team put together for her

473
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
She didn't know what the fuck she was wearing

474
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Shade

475
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Well alright enough negative

476
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Because honestly lots of positive

477
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You know I was just in my basement in Animal Crossing

478
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Haha we did a panel there

479
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Podcast Cross Zone and had a lot of fun

480
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
And I just want to give a shout out

481
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
And big hearts to the guys

482
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
From Koopa Club

483
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
From Game Bar

484
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
From GameBui.org

485
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Which I'm sure everybody was reciting that URL

486
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
At the end of the day after that panel

487
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
To Fox Van Allen from Wow Insider

488
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And the Techlicious

489
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Is that the one he writes for? I look really stupid right now

490
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I forget which one he writes for but

491
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
He was a great moderator

492
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
And the other folks that came

493
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
To the panel

494
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I was really worried no one was going to show up y'all

495
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
And we had a relatively full room

496
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
A few MTC's but not a lot

497
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And had a great time

498
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
And I was telling jokes, people were laughing

499
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
We were having fun with it

500
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And yes that panel should be up soon

501
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Koopa Club is going to put it on their feed

502
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
So I'll let y'all know when it's up

503
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
And because it was the last panel scheduled for that room

504
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
We got, or you guys rather, got to run long

505
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
So that was good

506
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Yeah that was good

507
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
And we had a great time

508
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
That was really the highlight for me

509
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Getting to do what I love to do

510
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You know, I want to go next year

511
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Oh yeah

512
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Because I was actually trying to think of

513
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Next year is my 20 year high school reunion

514
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Oh my gosh

515
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Shoot me in the face already

516
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
But I want to do one con next year

517
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Assuming I don't move to Washington

518
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
So I was actually thinking of making that my con next year

519
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Although I have another friend

520
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
That's definitely trying to get me back to Fonamy

521
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
For Homestuck cosplay

522
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Oh geez

523
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You know what, I wasn't gonna do it at all

524
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Until she's like, we need to do this

525
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And it's better when you have two people

526
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I was like, fine, I'll make a costume

527
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I was actually gonna suggest GamerX look into the

528
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
San Jose Convention Center, I mean yes

529
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I know that's not the heart of San Francisco

530
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
But San Jose is still the Bay Area

531
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
It's easy to get to

532
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
They need to check the one that YowieCon is at

533
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Which is right outside Burlingame

534
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Where I

535
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Right by the airport, right?

536
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Yeah, and it was a really good venue for the convention

537
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
YowieCon is still relatively small

538
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And it was perfectly accommodating

539
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
To everything, especially having

540
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Electronic glass toys in

541
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
The dealer's room

542
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
And then they had JunkieSpot there

543
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
So I think that, you know, they need to

544
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Did they have a dealer's room?

545
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Yes, it was small, like everything for first year con

546
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It was very small, and some tables

547
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I'd like to talk to the organizer actually

548
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
He's a pretty approachable guy

549
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
So if you can give me that information

550
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Wink wink, nudge nudge

551
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Yeah, I'd definitely be going next year

552
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I had a good time

553
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Yeah, we didn't do Sunday

554
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Because we ended up taking a bunch of people

555
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Up to our friend's place above the Castro

556
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And drinking until 3 AM

557
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
And we got trashed

558
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
That was the best thing we did

559
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
But it was just great to have everybody in one place

560
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It's like, who drank all this tequila?

561
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You did, it's 3 AM

562
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Oh shit, so yeah

563
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Jonko from Koopa Club and I were doing shots of Fireball

564
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
And you guys know how I am after one drink

565
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I think I had like four shots of Fireball

566
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
But being in an enclosed space with all those people

567
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Plus the alcohol lowering your immune system

568
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Con crud

569
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Yeah, and exhaustion

570
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Don't forget that, that's a big one after Clue two weeks ago

571
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Con crud hit Rob hard

572
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I have been sick since

573
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Somehow I didn't really come down with it

574
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Until Tuesday

575
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I was really sick, I'm still getting over it

576
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Like you might be able to hear it in my voice

577
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Yeah, I've been sick since Tuesday

578
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
If you listen to Hoard House on Wednesday

579
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm really out of it

580
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Yeah, I'm still trying to recover from that

581
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Not fun, but I better not get that

582
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
When I go to Dragon Con

583
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
You remember my advice

584
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
And do not drink soda at a con

585
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Drink nothing but tea

586
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
SSJ 100 Matt in our chat room says

587
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
On a scale of one to grandpa, how drunk was everyone?

588
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Every single person

589
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Was drinking except for

590
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Xtaphir, I believe

591
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
From what you're describing, on a scale of one to grandpa

592
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
You were on girl

593
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
The slag kick was driving

594
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
So he didn't drink anything

595
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Oh yeah, that's right, he didn't drink either

596
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
And Brad from Pod Culture in our chat room

597
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
At live.vognetwork.com is saying

598
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Yay, Fireball, and more Fireball is coming to Dragon Con

599
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Here we go

600
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
There is something I'm making, Rob, that you should try

601
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
If you like the Fireball

602
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I'm making ginger rum

603
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
With actual ginger and actual cinnamon

604
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I wish it could come to Dragon Con

605
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Well, you know what, if someone's got money

606
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I actually do have places to stay

607
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
If you are

608
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
If you are going to be in Atlanta

609
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Join us at Dragon Con

610
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I don't know if we have the final details on the panel yet

611
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
But I'm sure Bobby will be spreading that all over the internet

612
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
As soon as we know

613
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I think it's tentatively Sunday night

614
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Around the time that OLR would usually be

615
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Which does mean we are not going to have a show again

616
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Labor Day weekend

617
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I apologize because that's two shows in about a month's span

618
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
That we're going to be missing

619
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Enough, got to do it

620
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
So, it's Labor Day weekend

621
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I think a lot of you guys will be doing various things

622
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Conventions of your own and so forth

623
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Any last words on GamerX, Alan, before we get into our gaming weeks?

624
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Nothing, that was it

625
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Okay, Loki, do you have something to say?

626
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Labor Day weekend, Saints Row IV

627
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
All day and all night

628
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Alright, let's talk about our gaming weeks

629
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
The types of video games that you've been playing this week

630
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I actually think we'll let Alan start tonight, our guest

631
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Alan, how's your gaming week?

632
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
So we're going to spend an hour on this segment

633
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I've been playing everything

634
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Speed it up

635
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Really quickly, back in March and April

636
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I was trying to play Dead Space 1

637
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Because of the hype around Dead Space 3

638
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
It was too scary, I chickened out, I haven't touched it since then

639
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Necromorphs are terrifying

640
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
And it's claustrophobic and it was very scary

641
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I also played and beat GTA IV

642
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
The main game with Niko

643
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Twice, I beat it

644
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
And then I ran through and beat it again

645
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I haven't done the expansions yet

646
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
More recently, because of the Steam Trading Card stuff

647
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I've played

648
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
McPixel

649
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
McPixel's awesome

650
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I burnt out on it kind of fast

651
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Because I was trying to get 100% on everything

652
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Where you have to find all the jokes

653
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
All of the things that you can click wrong

654
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Basically, there's a bomb

655
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
It's just one screen, one room

656
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
There's a bomb somewhere

657
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
You have 20 seconds to click stuff to figure out how to defuse the bomb

658
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
It's kind of like WarioWare

659
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
It's very quick-paced

660
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Once you fail, you move on to the next one

661
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
And it's just trial and error

662
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
So yeah, that was a lot of fun

663
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
It's really neat

664
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I got 100% on the first couple stages

665
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
And then burnt out on it

666
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I played

667
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Revenge of the Titans

668
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Which is a tower defense game

669
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Which I played for the Steam Trading Cards

670
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I don't like tower defense

671
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
So once I saw that's what it was

672
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I was like, okay, I'm not playing this

673
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Past the hour and a half it's going to take me to get

674
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
My little Steam goodies

675
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
The longest time I've ever played a tower defense game

676
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Is Plants vs. Zombies

677
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Which is a great game, but I just don't care

678
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
It's kind of like Bobby with first person shooters

679
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I understand the strategy behind them

680
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I just don't care

681
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
And then the game that I really want to talk about

682
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Is Hotline Miami

683
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Which is phenomenal and I'm really kind of irritated

684
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
That I haven't played it since

685
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
It came out in October and I'm just now discovering it

686
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I got it, I haven't played it yet

687
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
It's sitting in my library

688
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
And I don't have it installed

689
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Oh, I do have it installed, sweet

690
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
But I haven't played it

691
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
The music is phenomenal

692
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
The creators of the game were inspired by that movie

693
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Drive with Ryan Gosling

694
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Awesome

695
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Which is kind of like a noir, neon

696
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
New 80s feel to it

697
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
And I think they even thank the director of that movie

698
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
In the credits

699
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
It's ultra violent

700
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I'm not too great about it

701
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Aside from the flawless soundtrack

702
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Drive was scored by Kravinsky

703
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Who is this French electro producer

704
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
They have a bunch of similar artists

705
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Doing the soundtrack

706
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
With a completely Polish name

707
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
So yeah, the soundtrack

708
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Look it up on YouTube, it's phenomenal

709
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I think we're going to play two of the songs

710
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
From Hotline Miami during the break

711
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Yes, but that would only be for the live listeners

712
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Also to say though, if people do want to see

713
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
The game in action, Classic Game Room reviewed it

714
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Not too long ago

715
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
And he does a really good review

716
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
It shows plenty of the gameplay

717
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
If I have time tonight, maybe I should do some live stream

718
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Because I haven't played it yet at all

719
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
So that might be a fun one

720
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
It's a fast game

721
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
It's also very hard

722
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
It took me a while to figure out the learning curve

723
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
What the hell you're supposed to do

724
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
What's in chat

725
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I'm laughing because Fifth Dream in our chatroom

726
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
says, oh look, I have Hotline Miami in Steam

727
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Who knew?

728
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I've done that

729
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
If you bought Humble Bundle 8, you got it

730
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
And one great thing about it

731
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
It is ultra-violent

732
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
But even just the title screen

733
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
And the music that plays

734
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
There is something disturbing

735
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
And really eerie about that game

736
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
That they nailed

737
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
There's a part halfway through the game

738
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Where the player character starts to hallucinate

739
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
And you start seeing dead people at the 7-Eleven

740
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Or in his apartment that aren't really there

741
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
There's a song that plays in your apartment

742
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
At the start of each mission

743
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I'm uncomfortable playing this

744
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
And it's not because of the violence

745
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Which does get a little out of control at times

746
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
But the creators for such a

747
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
It looks like a Super NES game

748
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Basically

749
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Really captured

750
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
It's a very unsettling game

751
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
And it's really amazing in that sense

752
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
And I think that's

753
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I played some Team Fortress 2

754
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
With the gang

755
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
And no Mass Effect 2 or 3

756
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I kind of burn out on that

757
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Not for good

758
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
But I have my third and fourth Shepherd

759
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
And I'm like, I'll finish their careers later

760
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Torchlight 2, I've been playing a lot of that

761
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
You enjoying Torchlight 2?

762
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I've hit a plateau

763
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Where I'm on an overworld map

764
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
That I keep dying on

765
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Like I just get steamrolled

766
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Because I'm playing it on veteran

767
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Which is kind of like the hard mode

768
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Not elite or super insane

769
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I was doing fine, I kept quaffing my health potions

770
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I was keeping up, but this one map

771
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Trying to get to the other side of it

772
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Where the quest marker is, I just get destroyed

773
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
So I need to

774
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
There's no way to grind really, because monsters don't respawn

775
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I'm going to have to do some co-op sometime

776
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
It'll be fun

777
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Alright, well if that's it for your gaming week

778
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

779
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Totally not playing Animal Crossing

780
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Right this second, right?

781
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Screw that game, no I'm kidding

782
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I'm totally playing Animal Crossing right now

783
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Yeah, Misty's in there, Deft is in there

784
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
We did have Fifth Dream earlier

785
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I don't know if Fifth Dream returned

786
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Look out for Misty, she'll hit you with a bug now

787
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
When you're not looking

788
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Well I told everyone they can have my pears

789
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
It just saved me some perfect pears

790
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
But yeah, playing Animal Crossing

791
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
You know

792
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I am actually back to Mass Effect 3

793
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Because I am taking my modding practice

794
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Another step further

795
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Someone put out a hair mod

796
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Where you can use Brooks' hair

797
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Instead of Allers, which actually makes Allers look decent

798
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
But

799
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
There's another

800
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Hair mesh out there

801
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
That I actually finally got

802
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
To replace the standard Chacwas hair with this one

803
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
But I can't get it to run without

804
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Crashing my game because I need to get the

805
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Right texture for the hair working

806
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Even though I think the cute texture would actually

807
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Work just fine with it, but I'm thinking out loud

808
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
So yeah, I'm still playing with it

809
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
But I finally figured out how to do mesh replacements

810
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
So that's one thing

811
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I am

812
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I'm actually

813
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Going to probably start livestreaming again

814
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
My playthrough of Mass Effect 3

815
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Just so I can

816
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Finish

817
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
The missions I was on

818
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Because I'm like halfway through the game right now

819
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
And a couple people asked me, so I might do it

820
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I also

821
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Am playing Borderlands 2

822
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
With Dan

823
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Because Dan's like, you're going to like it, it's going to be fun

824
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
You won't get that sick

825
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I had a headache by the time I was done

826
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
But I wasn't like frighteningly

827
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Nauseous like I usually am with

828
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
FPS's

829
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Which yeah, for any new listener, just because we

830
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Get new listeners every few weeks or so

831
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
You

832
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Well, you get sick from

833
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Playing first person shooters because of the motion

834
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Stuff right? I honestly think that the sickness

835
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I was getting was

836
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
With low res

837
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Polygon

838
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Because the game that's always done it to me worst

839
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Was Goldeneye on

840
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
The Nintendo 64

841
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
And the early 3D

842
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
First person shooters

843
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I've noticed that I'll get a little sick with like

844
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
With Portal 2 for a while

845
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
And then I was fine

846
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
And I'm having the same adjustment curve with

847
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Borderlands 2 so I think I might be

848
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Getting over some of that

849
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I still can't use my

850
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
3DS and I think they

851
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
No, someone just left

852
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I still can't play the 3D mode on my 3DS

853
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I'm trying to catch a bug

854
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Or something so I can gauge the distance

855
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
But

856
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I'm

857
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Also playing

858
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Back to

859
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Playing some Drunken Robot

860
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Pornography which is awesome

861
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
That's the Jumping Flash

862
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
The Jumping Flash with guns

863
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
And dying really quickly that's

864
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Really freaking hard game, yeah that game's awesome

865
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
And

866
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I

867
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Oh no wonder that was Act F that

868
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Left to go get cherries to sell at my retail

869
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Stay focused girl

870
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
And also thank you for loaning

871
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Me Kid Icarus because I've really wanted

872
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
To try it, yeah no worries just watch the hand cramping

873
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
It's a little crazy

874
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Try to put it on a flat surface to play

875
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
If you can

876
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Well going actually back to that I'm actually

877
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Thinking about

878
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Starting Bayonetta

879
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
That's a fun game, yeah I loved

880
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
It and I didn't get too far in it but

881
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Since I've started drawing again

882
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I haven't had the problem as

883
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Quickly with my hand cramping I mean it still

884
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Does it like especially if I

885
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
It actually does it more if I'm writing

886
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Than if I'm drawing

887
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
So but I've actually sat down with the controller

888
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I started Final Fantasy 7

889
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Which is almost impossible to play with the damn keyboard

890
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
So I'm probably gonna be

891
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I use a 360 controller

892
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Yeah we've got that and Dan's

893
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Been playing

894
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
A lot of really

895
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Weird Nintendo knockoffs

896
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
On a Sega Genesis emulator

897
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
It's been hilarious

898
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
And he actually just went through

899
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
The Ballad of Gay Tony again

900
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Which is really really good for

901
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
GTA I actually really like the story

902
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
So

903
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Between the two of us we've actually

904
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Had a pretty bustling gaming

905
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Week, despite being

906
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
You know working full time and then

907
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Finding out hoops they don't like

908
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
When you're open minded

909
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Anything else for your gaming week?

910
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Ummm

911
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I know there's

912
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Another game but I can't think of it off the top of my head

913
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Alright we'll jump in later we'll come back to you

914
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Loki how about you?

915
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
See I played a bit

916
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Of Team Fortress 2 this week

917
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
And

918
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
What else oh Saints Row the 3rd

919
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I went through I was just trying to finish up some more

920
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Achievements on the Steam version

921
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
And I went ahead and

922
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Finished off all the

923
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Vehicle

924
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
What was it

925
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
The car theft stuff

926
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Saints book vehicle stuff

927
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Where you have to go collect all the vehicles

928
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
And hijack them and stuff

929
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
So I did all that and now I have to finish up

930
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Like some of the other stuff in the Saints book stuff

931
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
One of which is

932
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
The achievement of playing

933
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
With both sexes so I have

934
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Now a female character that I created

935
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Just to get that achievement

936
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Because I've been playing mostly my male character

937
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
And so I need to get

938
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Two hours out of the way on that

939
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
To get the achievement and then

940
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Ummm

941
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Mostly just trying to get

942
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Some of the other stuff that

943
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I've missed there

944
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
What else did I play

945
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I tried playing some F-Zero GX in Dolphin

946
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Just to see how well that worked

947
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I figured because Dolphin's been out for a long time

948
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
That I should be able to run that game and

949
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
And Dolphin's an emulator

950
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
For Wii and GameCube games

951
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
And it

952
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Ran like shit so

953
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Oh well

954
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Well remember it takes a lot more CPU power to emulate

955
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
You know

956
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
That actually reminded me

957
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I've been trying to get

958
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Planet Harriers working

959
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Haven't been able to yet

960
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And then what else did I do this week

961
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Little bit of Call of Duty

962
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Modern Warfare 3 still

963
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Just because

964
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
And ummm

965
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I pre-purchased

966
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
My Saints Row 4 on Steam

967
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
When's that out? That's out what two weeks?

968
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
It's out a week from Tuesday

969
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Oh wow

970
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Have you done the character creator?

971
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Not yet

972
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Originally on PC I was going to import

973
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
My character

974
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
But

975
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Because my game is modded

976
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
It won't let me upload my character to their server

977
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Yet they're going to somehow

978
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Fix that soon

979
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
That they're going to allow you to upload your modded characters

980
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Just because the problem was they have

981
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Slider mods

982
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I don't really have that on mine

983
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
But they have slider mods and stuff

984
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
And that can really screw up characters

985
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
If you mod a character and then someone downloads that modded character

986
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Without having that stuff done

987
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
So

988
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
They don't have that yet but they're going to allow that soon

989
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
But

990
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
I was going to import that character

991
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
So I have one for my Xbox

992
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I'm just going to import that into 4

993
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Because I didn't really need to mess with it yet

994
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
But it looked fun

995
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
And I've been working on my game that I'm making

996
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
So that's it

997
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Good luck with that project

998
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I'll try to be quick with my gaming week because I honestly

999
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Haven't played a lot of new stuff

1000
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I've been doing the card collecting thing

1001
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
We're kind of in a lull in gaming right now

1002
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Before the storm really picks up

1003
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I'm really pumped for the release of Final Fantasy 14

1004
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Realm Reborn

1005
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
That open beta starts a week from

1006
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Friday, or last Friday

1007
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
So it's only days away at this point

1008
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
There's a character creator out for 14 by the way

1009
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Which is also a benchmark

1010
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
So if you're curious about 14 at all

1011
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
You can download that and check it out

1012
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
It's free of course

1013
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
See how that works and play with the character creator there

1014
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
And see what your character would look like in game

1015
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
And the graphics engine that's really good for that game

1016
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
So

1017
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I was messing around with that

1018
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Also Team Fortress 2

1019
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Visiting some older stuff in Steam

1020
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
There's a question I actually played through

1021
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Probably further than I did on 360 when it first came out

1022
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
It's a great little game

1023
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
And it looks better on the PC than it did on 360

1024
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I played that for about 20-30 minutes

1025
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
It was like okay this is neat

1026
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
And then I alt tabbed it and went AFK

1027
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
It's fun, I like that, it's a good game

1028
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
And then I've also still been playing the MOBAs

1029
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I can't remember if I talked about this on the last show

1030
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I think I did a little bit

1031
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
But I started getting into League of Legends

1032
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
And Dota 2, kind of both of them

1033
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
I don't know, there's things I like about Dota 2

1034
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
And there's things I like about League of Legends

1035
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
So I'm kind of juggling them both right now

1036
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Which when you're trying to learn them is really confusing

1037
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
But there's these Dota 2

1038
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Championships going on right now

1039
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Which you can actually watch, but what I like about it

1040
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Is that it's not necessarily just like this Twitch thing

1041
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Or something where you're watching a livestream

1042
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
But you can actually watch in the game client

1043
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Like while the people are playing

1044
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
And I thought that was kind of neat

1045
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
And apparently if you pony up some cash which goes into the pot

1046
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
You can get in-game items as well with that

1047
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
So that's kind of neat

1048
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Okay, well, and you know

1049
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Valve is pretty proud of Dota 2

1050
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I'm pretty sure, so yeah

1051
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
So I've been playing that

1052
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I've also been playing League of Legends

1053
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Dota 2 I'm still mostly in the single player

1054
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Tutorial stuff, like doing the bot matches

1055
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
And all that, but League of Legends

1056
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I am playing a lot of co-op versus bots

1057
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I'm not playing player versus player yet

1058
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Because I feel like I still suck

1059
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
And I have a lot to learn

1060
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Also, I'm playing League of Legends

1061
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I'm playing League of Legends

1062
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I still suck and I have a lot to learn

1063
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Although the last match I played

1064
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Last night I think it was

1065
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Actually boosted my confidence quite a bit

1066
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Which is funny because we lost

1067
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
A match against beginner bots

1068
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
But I was the only person

1069
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Out of the five to get any kills

1070
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
And I actually had like a streak going

1071
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
That actually kind of boosted my confidence

1072
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I was like, alright, I do know what I'm doing

1073
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Compared to these four other people

1074
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
So how bad could it be going into a

1075
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Player versus player match

1076
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
So everybody pray for me

1077
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
As I go into that

1078
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
But that's pretty much my gaming week

1079
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
So, we will start to move into news

1080
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
But I do always like to take a minute for housekeeping

1081
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Again, we will have no show over

1082
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Labor Day weekend, but that's still a few weeks away

1083
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Because I will be in Atlanta at Dragon Con

1084
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Which I hope you will come by

1085
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
And say hi at the VoG panel

1086
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Which will be Sunday night at Dragon Con

1087
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
If you're there

1088
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Also, you can friend us on Twitter

1089
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R and Facebook

1090
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Twitter.com slash Orange Lounge Radio

1091
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Be our friend

1092
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Let's get into the news

1093
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
It's also been a bit of a slow news week

1094
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
But we still got a few things we want to point out

1095
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
That's going on

1096
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
So, Loki, why don't you start us off

1097
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Alright, so, let's talk a little bit about

1098
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Amazon and

1099
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Yet another company getting on the

1100
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Android game console bandwagon

1101
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
So, Amazon

1102
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I guess is playing on

1103
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
It's sort of a rumor right now

1104
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
That they're developing a console

1105
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
I'm assuming it's going to support the Amazon

1106
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Marketplace

1107
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
As far as details beyond that

1108
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
No idea what it's going to be

1109
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
But basically

1110
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
There's still rumors that Google's

1111
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Developing their own console

1112
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
So

1113
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I don't know

1114
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
We'll see

1115
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
They're saying that maybe we'll see it

1116
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Around Black Friday

1117
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
But

1118
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
It's funny, the more and more I hear

1119
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
About other companies coming out with their own consoles

1120
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
And the specs

1121
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
And the features sound better

1122
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
The less and less I like my Ouya

1123
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Well, and it's also one of those things where it's like

1124
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Good God, what kind of

1125
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
What did Ouya do?

1126
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Now I'm worried that everybody wants a piece of that

1127
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Because the Kickstarter was so successful

1128
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
It's like we're seeing all of these clones

1129
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
And I'm like, surely

1130
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
We see the end of this coming

1131
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Where all this crap saturates

1132
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
The market, and then none of them do well

1133
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I don't think it's necessarily that they're going to

1134
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Saturate the market, it's just going to be

1135
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
It's, I mean, you can

1136
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Kind of compare that to tablets

1137
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Oh my God, there's so many tablets out there that

1138
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Saturate the market, and none of them are going to do well

1139
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
You know, I think that's what's going to end up happening

1140
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
When you get all these individual marketplaces

1141
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Because you have

1142
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Ouya, which is on its own

1143
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Marketplace, and Amazon, which is its own

1144
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Marketplace

1145
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
And the Mad Catz one though

1146
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Is on just a regular

1147
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Google Play Marketplace

1148
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
So that might be okay

1149
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I would assume that the Google one

1150
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Would be on the Google Play Marketplace

1151
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
So it's just when you start

1152
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Segmenting the Marketplace like that

1153
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
That's when you run into problems

1154
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
I mean, it's great for indie developers

1155
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
That want to, I guess, get their game out

1156
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Because now they can put it on all these

1157
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Marketplaces because, I mean, porting your game

1158
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
From Android to

1159
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
The Amazon Marketplace

1160
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Basically just putting it on the Marketplace

1161
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Because they're pretty much the same

1162
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
And then also spec wise

1163
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Some of these newer consoles

1164
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Are going to be a lot better spec wise

1165
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Than the Ouya

1166
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
The Ouya may have done

1167
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Okay as far as Kickstarter goes

1168
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
But the way they've been handling everything

1169
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Oh, Game Stick was the other one

1170
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
That's another Marketplace, it's its own thing

1171
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
And then there was the other one that was streaming

1172
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Games, I don't know

1173
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
There's a ton of different options out there

1174
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
And at the end of the day

1175
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
They're all kind of offering similar things

1176
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
There's not a lot of exclusive stuff

1177
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
That differentiates one from the next

1178
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
And

1179
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
The experience isn't all that great

1180
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
At least for the Ouya right now

1181
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Because that's the only one that's actually to market

1182
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
So far

1183
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I don't know

1184
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I think this question is a bit of an ahh

1185
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
But other people are asking it

1186
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
So I'll ask it too

1187
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Do Sony and Nintendo have anything to be worried about

1188
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
With these consoles, why?

1189
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Yeah, no

1190
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
I don't think they have anything to be worried about right now

1191
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
But the way things are going right now

1192
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Is everything kind of trending towards

1193
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
People being, especially a lot of these companies

1194
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Being interested in indie

1195
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Developers

1196
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
And

1197
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Definitely trying to

1198
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Get indie developers on their platform

1199
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Because that seems to be where a lot of the interest

1200
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
And innovation is nowadays

1201
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
And so you have these indie platforms

1202
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Out there like the Ouya

1203
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
It may not be a very powerful platform

1204
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
But it's an independent platform

1205
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
So far, I mean it's still closed

1206
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
But you gotta have some sort of

1207
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Restrictions in place so there's not rampant piracy

1208
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Because as far as I'm aware right now

1209
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I don't think you can really pirate Ouya games

1210
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Although I haven't rooted my Ouya yet

1211
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Soon

1212
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
So I don't really know how it really

1213
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Treats that, but

1214
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I think that's kind of been the draw

1215
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Is there's all these indie games

1216
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I think that if a company like

1217
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Amazon or even Mad Cats

1218
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Or Google come out

1219
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
With their own, well we know

1220
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Mad Cats is, but if they come out with their own

1221
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Device, I think it's going to be

1222
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
A better piece of hardware

1223
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
And as far as the customer service

1224
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
And the way everything's handled is going to be a better

1225
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Device anyways because they have experience

1226
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
With developing

1227
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Things and actually being able to market it

1228
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
And have the platform, they're much bigger

1229
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Than a start up company like Ouya

1230
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Or PlayStick for example

1231
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
So I think it's promising

1232
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
But I'd have to see what their specs are going to be

1233
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I mean hell, Amazon

1234
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Making a console wouldn't be that

1235
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Crazy considering they have their own

1236
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Tablets so

1237
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Why not? I can see that happening

1238
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Alright

1239
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Well, we'll see if there's any truth to this

1240
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I think the one thing too I want to throw out there

1241
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Is that it would be interesting with Amazon because

1242
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
They do have all the things that are tied to Amazon Prime

1243
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Such as, you know, their version of Netflix

1244
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Which, you know, big deal

1245
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
All those boxes will play the streaming

1246
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Video things, but it could be interesting as well

1247
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
What kind of like special things they might

1248
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Offer that would be exclusive to their

1249
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Console, you know, keep in mind they have

1250
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
The Kindle stuff too, they have

1251
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
The movie marketplace

1252
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Where you can buy things, it would be interesting

1253
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
To see if there might be any synergy

1254
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
There. But the price even

1255
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Of their tablets is coming down so much that

1256
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Like, I would think it'd be

1257
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
In their best interest not necessarily to

1258
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Come out with a console but to maybe come out with

1259
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Something that you can play your

1260
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Games on your tablet and then

1261
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
You can stream them to your TV

1262
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
You know, even almost like that Google

1263
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
The Chromecast thing

1264
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Or, you know, and have a controller

1265
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
And stuff so then that way you can take it

1266
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
On the go and you can play with it at

1267
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Home and stuff. How I really wish

1268
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
The, you know, Wii U was kind of handled where you

1269
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Could, you know, that'd be awesome to have your games

1270
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Loaded on like a compact

1271
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Not a compact flash but like, you know, some sort of

1272
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
You know, flash memory

1273
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Or something like that and then that way

1274
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
You can play them on the go instead of having

1275
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
It stream from your console, of course, you know

1276
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
It's not gonna work hardware wise but

1277
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
It would still be kinda cool if you could

1278
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Do that as easily and I know that was

1279
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Something that they wanted to do with like the Vita

1280
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Even where, you know, you play your

1281
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Vita version of MLB

1282
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Or you play your PS3 version of

1283
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
MLB and then you flip it over to

1284
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
The, you know, Vita and you take it on

1285
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
On the road and that kind of stuff. I think

1286
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
That would be really cool but

1287
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I don't know, we'll have to see. I mean right now it's just

1288
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
A rumor and I mean hell

1289
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Apple, I mean that's been

1290
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
A rumor for the longest time that Apple's gonna do something

1291
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
With Apple TV or something that turned that into

1292
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
A console so

1293
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
I don't know, I don't, it's

1294
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
All these different options though

1295
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
That are not necessarily

1296
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Like the major console manufacturers

1297
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Are good options I think for indies

1298
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
So, and even now, even with

1299
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
The way they're kind of, you know

1300
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Opening it up a little bit for indies

1301
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Especially like the Xbox One and the PlayStation

1302
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
4 and stuff, it's just

1303
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
It's a good time to be indie I guess

1304
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Alright, well let's

1305
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Move on to some more news

1306
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
This company isn't necessarily indie

1307
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
But people sure love their games and

1308
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
To the point where people will go

1309
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
To great lengths to figure out where the

1310
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Heck this company might be going and

1311
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
It's Valve and it's about

1312
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
An upcoming project that's been spotted

1313
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Left 4 Dead 3

1314
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Now this is a little more than

1315
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
You know, well since they did 1 and 2

1316
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
A 3's gotta happen at some point, but here's what happened

1317
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Apparently a Valve

1318
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Studio tour was given

1319
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
To some folks who actually

1320
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Got a snapshot of somebody's

1321
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Computer that actually had references

1322
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
To, well it's like a change log

1323
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Of everything that's been going on

1324
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
It had references to Source 2

1325
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Which we know has been a thing, Valve's openly said

1326
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
They're working on Source

1327
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Pretty surprised, but L4D3

1328
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Was also there

1329
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
So, you know, it's something

1330
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
That's happening, could that be the first

1331
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Game to use Source 2

1332
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Who knows, and not

1333
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Unfortunately Half-Life 3, I don't know

1334
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
But apparently

1335
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
More thoughts come out after it

1336
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
That say, hey, this is actually something that

1337
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Is happening, so

1338
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Alan, I'm sure

1339
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
You've been following this a bit, what do you think?

1340
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Well the Source engine, which was

1341
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Designed and made for Half-Life 2 originally

1342
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Which is 2003-2004

1343
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Anything that Valve

1344
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Has put out that's not Dota

1345
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Is on Source, Team Fortress 2

1346
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Portal, Half-Life 2

1347
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Episode 2, it's all the modified

1348
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Original Source engine

1349
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
If Source 2 is done

1350
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
To the point where they can release L4D3

1351
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
On it, even if it takes another 3 years

1352
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
If that, like, this is the product

1353
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
This is the Source 2 engine running, that means

1354
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Half-Life 3, they have

1355
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
An API that they're going to build the game on top of

1356
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
So now, announce it

1357
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Or should you just give up hope?

1358
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Mark Laidlaw, who I

1359
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Tweeted with a couple weeks ago

1360
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
He posted a vine of him in an elevator

1361
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
And he was kind of hovering his finger

1362
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Over the 3 button

1363
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Hovering, then the last second he pushes L

1364
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
For lobby, like he won't push 3

1365
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
And I was like, ugh, like a dagger in my heart

1366
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Wasn't there something else too, where it was like

1367
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
He said something about playing Pikmin 3 and you tweeted him

1368
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Like, what's it like?

1369
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Yeah, he was like, Pikmin 3 is really good

1370
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
And I was like, so Mark, what's it like to play a sequel

1371
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
With a 3 in it, what's that like?

1372
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
And he favorited it and then said

1373
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Oh, we're all slaves to Nintendo

1374
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Valve hearts Nintendo confirmed

1375
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Yeah

1376
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
I love Twitter for things like that

1377
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
That's why Twitter rules

1378
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I do find it funny that people are looking forward

1379
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
To L4D3 considering that there was a

1380
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Boycott campaign for L4D2

1381
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
If you remember that

1382
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Oh, right, because it came out so soon after the first one

1383
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Its street date was almost a year after

1384
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
L4D1

1385
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
But that was, of course, 3, 4, 5 years ago

1386
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
So now 3 has had enough time to

1387
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Simmer

1388
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Tigerkaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says

1389
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
What if Valve is like Half-Life 3

1390
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Exclusive on Xbox One and PlayStation 4

1391
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Since both consoles have PC hardware

1392
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Gabe would never let that happen

1393
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Gabe would have to be pushed down a flight of stairs

1394
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Portal 2 was on PlayStation 3

1395
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Well, I guess it was on Xbox too, but it was way better on PlayStation 3

1396
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
With the Steam integration and all that

1397
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
It was way better on Steam

1398
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
That's true

1399
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
I would also think too, honestly, if Steam's got this

1400
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Steam bot, and I said this on the show before

1401
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I said if they want to sell a million of those

1402
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Steam boxes, make Half-Life 3

1403
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
A timed exclusive to those Steam boxes

1404
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
And watch that shit sell

1405
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
I mean, that's all they'd have to do

1406
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Right?

1407
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Alright, anyhow, let's move on, more news

1408
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
DarkSakura

1409
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
You know how we all complain about GameStop

1410
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
The evil G

1411
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
As we have been calling it

1412
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Basically, the federal judge

1413
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
In Camden, New Jersey said

1414
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Uh, yeah, you can sue them, go for it

1415
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Basically saying that

1416
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
The games that were being sold

1417
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
There did not fully

1418
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Advertise

1419
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
That there might be other costs

1420
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Involved, like for online passes

1421
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Which, honestly

1422
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I think the lawsuit

1423
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Is a little bit on the frivolous side

1424
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Because it is common sense

1425
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
However, to quote a

1426
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Deadpool meme

1427
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Common sense, so rare it's a super power

1428
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Yeah

1429
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
So, because these people lack common sense

1430
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
And other people agree

1431
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
That they shouldn't have to have common sense

1432
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
GameStop is being sued

1433
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Well, I mean, if someone's grandma

1434
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Wants to get, you know, 8 year old Timmy

1435
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Modern Warfare 3

1436
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
And she's trying to get herself a deal

1437
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
And buys it

1438
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
And she gives it to him

1439
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Thinking that it's new

1440
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Or he thinks it's new and it's used and now he can't play online

1441
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
She didn't know, there wasn't a sticker on it

1442
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Right, so

1443
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
It's for people buying games that don't play games

1444
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
But it's still though

1445
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
It's technically

1446
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
I mean, this is a decision for the publishers

1447
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Technically the game is complete

1448
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
You can play the game

1449
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
And sometimes even a portion of the multiplayer

1450
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
But, you know, it's additional DLC

1451
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
That you need to purchase

1452
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
You know

1453
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
I mean, even though it's kind of sad

1454
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Is when they did this lawsuit

1455
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
That now it's already fixed

1456
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
The problem is already gone

1457
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
So, I don't think

1458
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
That they should be

1459
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
I don't think it's GameStop's decision

1460
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
I don't think they should have to be

1461
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Responsible for something the publisher does

1462
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Which is ironic

1463
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Because EA has now said

1464
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
That they're doing away with online pass

1465
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
It's very attractive too

1466
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
So any of those games that you buy

1467
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
They're gone

1468
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
But unfortunately it doesn't really change

1469
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
In the world of a lawsuit

1470
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Because there was a window of time when it was the case

1471
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I want to say, if I remember correctly

1472
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I think these are the same guys that were suing

1473
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Subway and actually won

1474
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
For the footlongs

1475
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Did they win? I thought that hadn't been decided yet

1476
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Oh, okay, I wasn't sure

1477
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
But for the footlongs being 11 inches

1478
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Which, come on

1479
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
The foot is fucking 12 inches

1480
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
That also raises the red flag

1481
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
A little bit, though

1482
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Okay, now we're talking about a serial lawsuit

1483
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Type of individual

1484
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
You always kind of have to raise your eyebrow

1485
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
With that, like, potentially

1486
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Abusing the system

1487
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I

1488
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
I think that it's something

1489
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
That, yeah, it's good to have on your label

1490
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
But, in the end

1491
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
And

1492
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
I think

1493
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
People are looking for excuses

1494
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
To sue

1495
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
The moment somebody is the slightest

1496
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Bit put off

1497
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
That the first thought

1498
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Is sue

1499
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
And I think that

1500
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
It would have

1501
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Been better

1502
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Better handled by sending a

1503
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Letter of complaint to the company

1504
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I don't know if they did that

1505
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
I haven't seen anything about that in the article

1506
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
But, um

1507
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
But they should have

1508
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Instead of, you know, just suing the company

1509
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
The right step would have been

1510
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Contacting the company and say

1511
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Hey, this wasn't on the label

1512
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
We weren't aware of this

1513
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
What can you do? If they don't

1514
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Respond, then the next logical

1515
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Step would be

1516
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Better business bureau

1517
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Then the next logical step

1518
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
May be a lawsuit if they are that

1519
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Pleased, but in the end

1520
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
I

1521
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I really think jumping right to that

1522
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Conclusion is frivolous

1523
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
You know, it is also stupid too because

1524
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Even says right here, it's one of the guys

1525
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Bought, you know, Need for Speed

1526
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Hot Pursuit

1527
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
And, um

1528
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
He tried to play it online and then it says

1529
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
He was hit with an extra fee of $15

1530
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
No, he was told to purchase DLC

1531
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
It was $15. At that point, if he doesn't like that

1532
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
He should have returned it back to the store

1533
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Which he could do within seven days

1534
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
I don't understand

1535
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
That might be GameStop's way out of this too

1536
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
I don't understand, you know, why

1537
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
And no one was forcing him to do that

1538
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
You know, if anything

1539
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
If you want to get into it, if anything

1540
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I think people should be suing fucking EA

1541
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
For having to pay those online passes

1542
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
And then them shutting the servers down

1543
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
That would be a little bit more

1544
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Worth merit

1545
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I mean, even now, it's just kind of like

1546
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Okay, well, they're done with that

1547
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
But I don't think GameStop's really

1548
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Should be the blame of that stuff

1549
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
You're buying a used copy

1550
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
A used copy is not the same as a new copy

1551
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
It's gonna, you know

1552
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Anything that you buy used is not gonna be

1553
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Of the same quality as a new thing

1554
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
So, I think this is gonna be thrown out

1555
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
I think that they're gonna

1556
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
They're not gonna win it

1557
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
I actually think they're gonna win

1558
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
We'll see

1559
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Didn't we kind of predict that this might happen

1560
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
When we first heard about the online pass

1561
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
That the consumers would not be educated on it

1562
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
And that this kind of thing would happen

1563
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
I'm almost positive it had to be said

1564
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
I mean, there's two phrases

1565
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
That are gonna be going out of

1566
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
I think common parlance, you know, soon

1567
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
One of them is, you know

1568
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
The buyer beware

1569
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
And the other one's going to be shoppers remorse

1570
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Or buyers remorse

1571
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Because you can just sue now if you're remorseful over your purchase

1572
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Dungeonbuster in our chatroom says

1573
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
There are people that still have trouble interpreting

1574
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
ESRB ratings

1575
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
That's true, maybe the consumer's not gonna learn this stuff anytime soon

1576
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
That's why they need to rate them like they do movies

1577
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Yeah, I agree with that

1578
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
I only think the ESRB is so

1579
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Confusing because it seems pretty

1580
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
It says what an E for everyone

1581
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
I don't understand how that's confusing

1582
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
It's not to you and me

1583
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
At what point though, I mean

1584
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
I was actually dealing with my library

1585
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Accounts and stuff and we're talking about Final Fantasy

1586
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
XIV, you know

1587
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
They're ordering it thinking it's a game

1588
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
That they can rent out or loan out to

1589
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Their customers even though

1590
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
On our internal website

1591
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
That they order off of, there's a big

1592
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Fucking banner

1593
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
It's bold and there's

1594
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Yellow behind it that says

1595
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Will not work

1596
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
MMO, cost money to play

1597
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Not recommended for

1598
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Renting out

1599
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
People are stupid and they see Final Fantasy

1600
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
I didn't know

1601
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
What more can you fucking do

1602
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
To tell these people

1603
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Or inform them

1604
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Even the ESRB, they tweak their shit

1605
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
So that it would be more clear

1606
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
There's nothing you can do

1607
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
To get it through these people

1608
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Parents and stuff, they just don't give a shit

1609
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
No amount of changing your logos

1610
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Sometimes parents just don't understand

1611
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Sometimes just parents don't give a shit

1612
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Or consumers don't give a shit

1613
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
And they're whatever

1614
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
They're not gonna learn

1615
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
What it is

1616
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
I hate to say it, my mother is a prime example of this

1617
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
And actually there are

1618
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Psychological studies going behind this

1619
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
People get comfortable with a certain idea

1620
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
And anything that

1621
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Supports their idea, even if it is

1622
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Wrong, gives them

1623
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Basically a happy

1624
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Chemical response

1625
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
That's why there's a lot of stupid Republicans out there

1626
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Wow

1627
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Well that's why Rush Limbaugh exists then

1628
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
But it goes either way

1629
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
The moment that something

1630
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Is said that's

1631
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Contrary to this idea

1632
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
That is imprinted into their minds

1633
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
It of course forms an opposite

1634
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Response, the first instinct

1635
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Is not to listen to it, is to dismiss it

1636
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Even if it might save them

1637
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Money in the long run, and then when they go back

1638
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
To suffer the consequences of it

1639
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Of course, oh well nobody told me that's because

1640
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
You have a selective fucking memory

1641
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Alright

1642
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Um

1643
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
I wanted to go to another comment in our chatroom at

1644
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Live.vognetwork.com from ShadowNextGen

1645
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Who says, there was some good GameStop news

1646
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
This week too

1647
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
I'm assuming that's the reprinting of Xenoblade

1648
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Right? Oh yeah

1649
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
That came across my Twitter, that has to be it

1650
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Yeah that has to be the good GameStop news

1651
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Someone, and I'm sorry if you're in chat and I just blanked on who it was

1652
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
But someone on my Twitter feed posted

1653
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Xenoblade Chronicles

1654
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Used

1655
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
And it was 80 bucks

1656
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Used from GameStop and if they're reprinting

1657
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
It they have to redo that used

1658
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
I had no idea that the printing was that limited

1659
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
And it should just be GameStop exclusive

1660
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
It's weird that they're reprinting it too

1661
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
When the Wii isn't really being pushed right now

1662
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
It's supposed to be all about the Wii U

1663
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
You can play it in the Wii U though right?

1664
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Well of course you can, but I wonder if the prices drop

1665
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Maybe it's like $20 at this point

1666
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
It would make a really good

1667
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Thing to have on Wii U

1668
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Please

1669
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Them dropping the price of something that's going

1670
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
For $90 right now

1671
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
And it's exclusive to them, yeah I'm sure

1672
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
They're totally motivated from competition

1673
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
To drop that price

1674
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Like hell they are

1675
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
It's probably going to come back at 60 bucks

1676
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Alright let's move on with some more news

1677
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Loki

1678
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Alright so there was a couple

1679
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Bits of information from

1680
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Microsoft this week about

1681
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Things

1682
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Including Xbox Live family packs

1683
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
They are going away

1684
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Obviously since we already knew that

1685
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
And they're going to be converted into individual

1686
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Gold accounts on August

1687
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
27th

1688
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
That's probably around the same time

1689
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
The new dashboard update is going to come out

1690
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
And we're going to have some other things tied in with that

1691
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,000
One of the reasons why they're doing this

1692
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Is because the

1693
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Xbox One

1694
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
For example is going to allow you to share

1695
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Your gold membership, sort of

1696
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Basically the way they're going to do it

1697
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Is you have

1698
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Your console

1699
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Only one person or one

1700
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Live account on that console

1701
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Needs to have live gold

1702
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
So say I have my family

1703
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
And each one of them has an Xbox Live account

1704
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
I only need to have gold

1705
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
For everybody to play online

1706
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Regardless of which account is signed in

1707
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
And then also the same thing

1708
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Like if I go to my friend's house

1709
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
And sign into my account

1710
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
They can also play on Xbox Live with me

1711
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
While I'm over there

1712
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Then they came out and started talking about

1713
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
This digital game sharing thing

1714
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Which made people think, oh my god they brought back

1715
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
The digital game thing that they were talking about

1716
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Before and it was so fucking awesome

1717
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Which we never saw and we had no idea what it really was

1718
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
So first off

1719
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
They came out and they

1720
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Phrased it kind of like that, hey we're bringing

1721
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
The digital game sharing thing back

1722
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
You're going to be able to do that

1723
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
The problem is, it isn't fucking new

1724
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
This is the same shit that you can do right now

1725
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
On the Xbox 360

1726
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
It's basically, I buy a game online

1727
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
For example, say I bought

1728
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
I don't know, an Xbox Live arcade game

1729
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Say I bought a

1730
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Super Street Fighter 2 or something like that

1731
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
And I have it on my console

1732
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
I've downloaded it

1733
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
It's good to go, I can play it

1734
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Anybody that's in my family

1735
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Or anybody else, any other account on

1736
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
My console can play that as well

1737
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
If I go over to Rob's

1738
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
And download the game

1739
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Sign into my account

1740
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
And download the game on his console

1741
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
We can play it

1742
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Full version, as long as I'm signed in

1743
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
But as soon as I leave, it's going to revert back

1744
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
To the demo version

1745
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
It's exactly the same fucking shit that happens right now

1746
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
And they fucking marketed it as some brand new

1747
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Fucking thing, and guess what

1748
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
A bunch of the fucking unwashed masses

1749
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Xbox fanboys or whatever

1750
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Holy shit

1751
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Game set match, fucking takeover

1752
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
You're so fucking stupid

1753
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
You don't even realize

1754
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
How stupid you are

1755
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
To be fair

1756
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Cool, this game sharing thing

1757
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
It's the same shit you have now

1758
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
And you're like, oh my god

1759
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
I'm going to buy an Xbox One now because it's so amazing

1760
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
You're so stupid

1761
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
And that's why they're going to be able to sell those consoles

1762
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Because you're so fucking stupid

1763
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
You're so fucking stupid

1764
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
And I love it because I was complaining about that shit on Twitter

1765
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
And some random fucking idiot that works on a

1766
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Microsoft store is like, no that's not how it was

1767
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
This is brand new information

1768
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
I'm like, you're a fucking idiot

1769
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
You sell this shit and you don't even fucking know what you're talking about

1770
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
You dumbass

1771
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Alright?

1772
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Except I said that in my head

1773
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
I'm not going to waste my time doing that

1774
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
He was all red in the face just going, okay

1775
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
You couldn't fit it in 140 paces

1776
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Oh, I showed so much restraint

1777
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
I was going to film a YouTube video and all that shit

1778
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
I was going to like, oh hey

1779
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
What the hell, it's black magic

1780
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
My 360 turned into an Xbox One

1781
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
To be fair

1782
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Just to play devil's advocate a little bit to your rant

1783
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Loki

1784
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
One of the things that Xbox One is offering

1785
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
That Xbox 360 didn't offer is the whole game streaming

1786
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Where you can start playing the game right away

1787
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Without the mega long installation

1788
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
So, I mean, doesn't that kind of

1789
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Yes, while this isn't a new thing

1790
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Doesn't it really enhance

1791
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Because it wouldn't be practical

1792
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
For me to like, say, bring Mass Effect over to your house

1793
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
And we have to

1794
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Or, excuse me, go over to your house

1795
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
To install my digital copy of Mass Effect

1796
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Or whatever and wait for it to download 7 gigs

1797
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Before we play it

1798
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Because Xbox One will be able to play it right away

1799
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
So that does kind of enhance it a little bit

1800
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Right?

1801
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Well, yeah, because it would have just been ridiculous

1802
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
If you had to do that

1803
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
As it is, I mean, I know

1804
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Hopefully they're going to treat the recovering profiles

1805
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
A lot easier because

1806
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Now you have to download your profile

1807
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
And it takes a while

1808
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
And then you'd have to download the game

1809
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
And all that stuff

1810
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
It's just kind of ridiculous

1811
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Of course, I mean, they're going to try to market it

1812
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
And how amazing this is

1813
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Of course they're going to do that

1814
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Because they want to make themselves look good

1815
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
So, why not?

1816
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
ActDeaf in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says

1817
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
It's been a while since we've had a Loki rage that hard

1818
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
And TigerClaw says

1819
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Loki ranting and shouting at the Microsoft employee

1820
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Probably would have been like that video of the lady

1821
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Shouting at an Apple store

1822
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
I seriously thought about doing that

1823
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
But just to prove myself right

1824
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
It's not worth it

1825
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
On someone like that that's randomly going through

1826
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
And commenting on everybody's story

1827
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
And I went and read through his stuff

1828
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
And I'm like, nah, it's not even worth it

1829
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
He's drank so much of the Microsoft Kool-Aid

1830
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
That there's no getting through this guy

1831
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
I'm not even going to waste my time

1832
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Do you really think the Xbox One is going to be that bad though?

1833
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Because I kind of think they've gone back

1834
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
On everything they need to

1835
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
The only thing that makes the Xbox One

1836
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
At this point is the fact that it's $100 more

1837
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
And has that required Kinect

1838
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
But it's kind of one of those things where it's like

1839
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Inevitably, a year and a half after it launches

1840
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
There will be some type of price drop

1841
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
I will get an Xbox One eventually

1842
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
I'm not saying that the Xbox One is bad

1843
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
I'm just calling out bullshit marketing

1844
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
That's all I'm calling out

1845
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
If Sony did the exact same thing

1846
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
If Sony came out and said

1847
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Hey, let's talk about how awesome

1848
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Cloud sharing is

1849
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
This is a brand new feature that we're bringing to the PlayStation 4

1850
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
It's never been done before

1851
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
I'd call them out and be like, fuck you

1852
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
This has been something that's been available already

1853
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Something like that

1854
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Nintendo started talking about something ridiculous

1855
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
I find it fascinating that they would come out and say that

1856
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
But it makes sense

1857
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Of course they're going to want to do that

1858
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
And the game sharing thing

1859
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Yeah, it's cool

1860
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
I can sign into my account and play the games I have bought

1861
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
That's not really sharing

1862
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
That's more like I'm going to a friend's house and watching a movie

1863
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
That I brought with me or something

1864
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Any comment from Alan or Dark Soccer on this before we move on?

1865
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
I like rants

1866
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Like I said in chat

1867
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
If they create some sort of

1868
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Mobile mode or travel mode

1869
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
For your account when you sign in

1870
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
It makes the process faster

1871
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
That'd be nice

1872
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
But like Loki said, it's still the same shit we have now

1873
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
I hate importing my profile

1874
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
To a different Xbox

1875
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
It takes like 10 minutes

1876
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
And you have to do it again

1877
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
When you come back home, you have to reimport your profile

1878
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
That's awful

1879
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Going forward

1880
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
This is probably going to tie in with Xbox One

1881
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Live accounts

1882
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Because you're connecting to their service

1883
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
It's probably just going to exist in the cloud

1884
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
You're just going to be signing in like you would sign in on a website

1885
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
And you're never going to have to download that profile

1886
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Because it's all on the cloud

1887
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
So that's

1888
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Probably going to improve

1889
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
You're not going to have that

1890
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
My 10 meg profile

1891
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
For some reason

1892
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
If I'm downloading any other 10 meg file

1893
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Anywhere

1894
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
It would be like instantaneous

1895
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
But oh no, for some reason

1896
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
I'm operating at 24 4

1897
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Or 28 8 or whatever

1898
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Going back to the 90s

1899
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Let me bandwidth

1900
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
In the interest of time, I'm going to move on

1901
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
I want to talk a little bit about Nintendo

1902
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Because Nintendo put out one of their Nintendo Directs this week

1903
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Where they talked about

1904
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Clarified a few things going on for the rest of the year

1905
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
For the record, I think those are a brilliant idea

1906
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
They're working out really well

1907
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
The great thing is they kind of come out of nowhere

1908
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
People are already saying

1909
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Get ready, y'all

1910
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Apple is going to do something on September 10

1911
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
God, that's so far away

1912
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
So far away?

1913
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
It's less than a month

1914
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
That's still a long ways away

1915
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Compared to Nintendo

1916
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
There's going to be a Nintendo Direct day after tomorrow

1917
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Get up early and watch it

1918
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
I'm just saying

1919
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
They had the Nintendo Direct

1920
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
There's no real big bombshells

1921
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
But just a few things

1922
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
First off, Sonic Lost World will be coming out October 22

1923
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
They were talking about some kind of functionality

1924
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Between 3DS and Wii U

1925
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
That sounded interesting

1926
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Art Academy Sketchpad for Wii U

1927
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Some details there

1928
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Kind of looks like you'll be able to post your drawings

1929
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Into Miiverse

1930
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Which as Miiverse grows

1931
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Looks like some people are doing some crazy shit in there too

1932
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
I think there's a version of it already

1933
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Downloadable

1934
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
A little mini version of it

1935
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Luigi was confirmed

1936
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
As a new Super Smash Brothers character

1937
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
I was kind of like

1938
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Isn't that kind of a given?

1939
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
I kind of already thought he was

1940
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Is he going to have crazy leg jumping?

1941
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Did he in the other ones?

1942
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
I was thinking

1943
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
They need to announce

1944
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Mecha Luigi or Demon Deaf Luigi

1945
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Where he's a super uber one

1946
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Or Waluigi

1947
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Waluigi's awesome

1948
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
I have another Nintendo exclusive

1949
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
The next Zelda game is going to have canon in it

1950
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Oh my god

1951
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Alright

1952
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Moving on

1953
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Some other things announced in the Nintendo Direct

1954
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Rayman Legends Wii U will have Mario and Luigi costumes

1955
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Now they're not going to actually be Mario and Luigi

1956
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,000
But it's like Rayman wearing the red suspenders and all that

1957
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
I still found it interesting

1958
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Despite all the drawings

1959
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
I kind of think that's one of those games nowadays

1960
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
For any Nintendo made

1961
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Game that's like oh we gotta have some reference to Mario in it

1962
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Gotta have it

1963
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Even I remember like was it Need for Speed

1964
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Most Wandered or something

1965
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,000
It had cars based off of the Mario Kart cars or something

1966
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
It's just

1967
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
It's neat I guess

1968
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
But when you do it in every single game

1969
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
When there's an homage to Mario in every goddamn game

1970
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
That's third party

1971
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
What are we going to get in Assassin's Creed

1972
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Are we going to have a Mario hat in Assassin's Creed

1973
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Watch Dogs

1974
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Are you going to have a Mario hat in Watch Dogs

1975
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
I mean come on

1976
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
They showed us some more footage

1977
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
From Wind Waker HD and A Link Between Worlds

1978
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
And I am so here for A Link Between Worlds

1979
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
That's like my most anticipated 3DS title right now

1980
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Pretty interesting

1981
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Little virtual console tidbit

1982
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
A game they're going to put out on the 3DS eShop

1983
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Summer Carnival 92

1984
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Wrecka

1985
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Wrecka? Oh my god that game's awesome

1986
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
It's so rare too

1987
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
I might have done Wrecka

1988
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
It's a neat game

1989
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
For a NES game

1990
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
And they actually acknowledge this shit is rare

1991
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
And now everybody's going to be able to play it

1992
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
So that was kind of neat

1993
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Some other things they announced for virtual console on 3DS

1994
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Donkey Kong, Wario Land 3

1995
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Super Mario Bros. 3

1996
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
And Tecmo Bowl

1997
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
In the Nintendo archive

1998
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
I think a lot of that stuff is already on the Wii

1999
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Virtual console save maybe Wario Land 3

2000
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright

2001
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Ace Attorney that was confirmed for the US

2002
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
A lot of people hoping that would get it localized

2003
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
It will be in 2014

2004
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
And then kind of their big thing they said at the end

2005
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Was that they were putting out a new

2006
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Application in the Wii U called

2007
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Animal Crossing Plaza

2008
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
And I actually did download this and check it out

2009
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
It's basically, it's another way of looking at

2010
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Miiverse basically

2011
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
But it is kind of cute because you have all the little

2012
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Animals walking around the screen and you can

2013
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Click on an animal

2014
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
And you can actually see Miiverse posts about that

2015
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Specific animal

2016
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Also it interfaces with

2017
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Your game card

2018
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
So you can actually take the SD card out of your

2019
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
3DS, put it in your Wii U

2020
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
And get your screenshots again on Miiverse

2021
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Which, interesting

2022
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
I don't know

2023
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
It was a weird little last tease

2024
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
But I kind of like that they're trying to push

2025
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
The boundaries of Miiverse with some different things

2026
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
But for me I'm going to be honest

2027
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
It was one of those things I downloaded it once

2028
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
But I was like, huh, neat

2029
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Then I turned it off and I probably won't ever run it again

2030
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
But

2031
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
For those that are really into sharing the creative

2032
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Stuff they've done in Animal Crossing it might be kind of cool

2033
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
So those are some of the highlights

2034
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Of the Nintendo Direct

2035
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
So please look forward to all those games

2036
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Coming out soon

2037
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Dark Sakura, before we get to release dates, what do you have for us?

2038
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Well we do have a demo

2039
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
That's finally on the Wii U

2040
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Wii U eShop

2041
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Wii U Wii U eShop

2042
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
It's been on the

2043
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
American Wii U

2044
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
eShop as well

2045
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Wonderful 101

2046
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Which I watched the trailer for

2047
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Last night

2048
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Actually this kind of makes me want

2049
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
A Wii U again

2050
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Tank Tank Tank was kind of a tank

2051
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,000
But

2052
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
It's free now

2053
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
This though, it was done by

2054
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Hideki Kiyama

2055
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Who did Beautiful Joe

2056
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
It looks like the same feel

2057
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
That Beautiful Joe had, which was a fun

2058
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Series of games

2059
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
So I really

2060
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Really am excited about this one

2061
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
It just looks really fun

2062
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
And it had sort of that Sentai feel

2063
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
To it, you know

2064
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
I like Sentai

2065
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
So I think this might be

2066
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
The convincing factor

2067
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Even Dan was sort of like, ooh that looks cool

2068
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
There are a lot of people pretty excited about this game

2069
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
So I need to download the demo, I keep forgetting

2070
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
I gotta screw that up

2071
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
I would do that right now, but I need the bandwidth

2072
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
For the show

2073
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Remind me to do that later

2074
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Have you seen anything about Wonderful 101?

2075
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
A lot of people on my Twitter are really excited for it

2076
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Yeah, but we're friends with a lot of Nintendo fanboys

2077
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Bless their hearts

2078
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Bless their hearts, alright

2079
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
To register participation

2080
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
For this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio

2081
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
At vognetwork.com

2082
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Use the passphrase, kidney

2083
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Let's move on to some release dates

2084
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Travel around the world and see what games are coming out

2085
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
To a store near you very soon

2086
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
The Angry Birds Trilogy

2087
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
On Wii and Wii U this week

2088
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Because they didn't get them the last time around

2089
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Payday 2

2090
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
On Playstation 3 and Xbox 360

2091
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Phineas and Ferb

2092
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Quest for Cool Stuff

2093
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Oh my god, Phineas and Ferb

2094
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Xbox 360, Wii, Wii U

2095
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
3DS and DS

2096
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
And one week from today

2097
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Disney Infinity

2098
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
PlayStation 3, Xbox 360

2099
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Wii, Wii U

2100
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
And 3DS as well

2101
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
A whole fucking ton of characters

2102
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Any idea

2103
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
What platform I should get it on

2104
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Because, you know

2105
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Like Alan said, we're Twitter friends

2106
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
With a lot of Nintendo fanboys

2107
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
So I'm kind of leaning towards Wii U for that reason

2108
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
So I can play with them, but then I'm like

2109
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Oh god, but then I think about things like Injustice

2110
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Where the, you know, online was kind of out

2111
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Wii 360

2112
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
I was thinking PlayStation 3

2113
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
If you have a Wii U

2114
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Then the tablet acts as the ARFID chip reader

2115
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Does it though? Because I thought that

2116
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Wasn't being implemented until a patch later on

2117
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Although they are talking about the Pokemon Rumble

2118
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Because in Skylanders

2119
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
No, it's not

2120
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
But it's going to

2121
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
It's going to happen for that

2122
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
But it's definitely not going to happen for Infinity

2123
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Because there's too much shit that goes on that portal

2124
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
There's like a bunch of things

2125
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
No way that would happen

2126
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
I know with Skylanders you need that little

2127
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Crystal thing

2128
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
That you put the thing on

2129
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
But if you have a Wii U

2130
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
If you have a Wii U, just put the action figure

2131
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
On your tablet and it's like, okay, I read it

2132
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
You have this character now

2133
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
It's one of those features, like the IR port on the 3DS

2134
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Or like the DS or whatever

2135
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
That they're never going to fucking use

2136
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Except for that Pokemon game

2137
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
But you could tap your credit card on it and use that

2138
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Don't kid yourself

2139
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
That'll be a thing

2140
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
When they announced the Pokemon Rumble

2141
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
I was like, why didn't they announce

2142
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
A new Pokemon Snap with amazing

2143
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
AR

2144
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Tablet camera support

2145
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
I kind of wish that my son was older

2146
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
So that he would be appreciative of this stuff

2147
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
I can get him a Mater

2148
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
The problem is though, to get the

2149
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Cars playset, it's like 40 bucks

2150
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
For the Cars playset

2151
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
$13 for the Mater

2152
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
And then Disney Infinity is another like

2153
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
$75

2154
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
No, I'm not spending $120

2155
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
That's estimated

2156
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
On this stuff

2157
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Just to have a playable Mater

2158
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Besides Saint's Row 4

2159
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
That's all that's bad

2160
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Teaching to play Saint's Row

2161
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Hell yeah

2162
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Alright, well this is where I would usually do the

2163
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Japanese release dates, but guess what

2164
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
There's nothing until August 22nd

2165
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Isn't it a holiday right now?

2166
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
I think it is, so you have things on the 22nd

2167
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
To look forward to, like Disorder 6

2168
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Dungeons and Dragons Mysteria

2169
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
We talked about that before

2170
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
But those are all on the 22nd

2171
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
So I'll touch on them again next week, but for now

2172
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
It's an empty week in Japan

2173
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
I did want to mention, because I was talking about

2174
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Angry Birds this earlier, my son plays Angry Birds

2175
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Actually, he can kind of

2176
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Do it, he 3-starred a level the other day

2177
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Oh, good job

2178
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Wow, that's pretty cool

2179
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
It's a little hard for him to do it on the phone

2180
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
That's the only game he plays so far

2181
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
But hey, I'll take anything

2182
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
You gotta start somewhere

2183
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Alright, well since I don't have Japanese releases, how about the UK?

2184
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
We have, coming out

2185
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
We have DuckTales Remastered on the 13th

2186
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Which actually, I bought that for Dan

2187
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
The day I got fired

2188
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Which I shouldn't have spent money on

2189
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
But I thought I had a job

2190
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
He came up and said

2191
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
My girl loves me

2192
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
She got me DuckTales

2193
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Aww, I'm gonna barf

2194
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
How much he's gonna love you when you buy him Strider

2195
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
I know, right?

2196
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Also coming out is

2197
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Europa Universalis 4

2198
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
And then Payday 2

2199
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
On PC

2200
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
On the 14th, also

2201
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
DuckTales Remastered for PS3

2202
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Alright, just a few more news stories

2203
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
For you guys in the classic game of the week

2204
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
And I was a little surprised with Dark Soccer's

2205
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Pick this week

2206
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Just because it's one of those games

2207
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Where you're like, oh yeah

2208
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
You gotta do that at some point

2209
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
I've come across

2210
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Quite a few that are like, you haven't done that yet?

2211
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Mandatory selection

2212
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Alright, Loki

2213
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Alright

2214
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Let's see

2215
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Kinda going back to some of the changes

2216
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
That are gonna be happening with the

2217
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Xbox 360, Xbox Live, all that stuff

2218
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
As previously mentioned

2219
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Before, they are getting

2220
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Rid of Microsoft Points

2221
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
And are gonna be converting over to

2222
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Real currency

2223
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
And this is supposed to be happening sometime in the 4th quarter

2224
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
October-ish

2225
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Well, it's actually gonna take place at the end of

2226
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
August, they're gonna convert your

2227
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Funds over to real money

2228
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
But they're gonna release new cards I believe in October

2229
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
And they're gonna come in different

2230
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Nominations of

2231
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
50 bucks, 25 dollars

2232
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
30 dollars, which is actually 3

2233
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
10 dollar cards, and 15 dollars

2234
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
So those are gonna be available

2235
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Around October-ish

2236
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
And your

2237
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Microsoft Point cards will still work

2238
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Until they say they won't

2239
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
And the only little

2240
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Bit of small fine print that you have

2241
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
About the points that you have on your

2242
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Account, they must be spent by

2243
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
June of 2015

2244
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
So they are giving you 2 years

2245
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Instead of 1 year now, but I mean honestly

2246
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
You shouldn't really have that much money sitting on your account

2247
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
It means I have to use the

2248
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Card I got for my birthday

2249
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Well, not necessarily

2250
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
I mean you can, you just don't

2251
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Yeah, you have 2 years

2252
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
I mean come on, you should be able to spend

2253
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
It in that time

2254
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
You got enough time

2255
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
My digital copy of Grand Theft Auto 5

2256
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Buy more rock band songs, you know that's what she's gonna do

2257
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
I got the email blast about this

2258
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
From Microsoft, and the way the email

2259
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Made it sound like it was happening

2260
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Now, it just said

2261
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
With an upcoming Xbox

2262
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
System update

2263
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
This will take effect, it didn't actually have any dates in it

2264
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Well the system update from what I'm gathering

2265
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Because they like to do every single system update

2266
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Because they do a new band wave

2267
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Before a major game release

2268
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
So the next system update I'm betting is gonna be right before

2269
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Grand Theft Auto 5

2270
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
And that would be the beginning of September

2271
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
And that's when they've mentioned they're gonna convert

2272
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Everything over, so it would make sense

2273
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
And they're doing a beta right now for it

2274
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
So it's probably very soon

2275
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Yeah, probably end of August

2276
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Alright

2277
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Well I don't know how many of y'all are fans of the

2278
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
EverQuest series, but there was quite a bit of news

2279
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
About EverQuest coming out this week

2280
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Some expansions for

2281
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
EverQuest and EverQuest 2

2282
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
EverQuest getting a new expansion called

2283
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Call of the Forsaken

2284
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Guess what number expansion it is for the EverQuest game

2285
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Guess what number?

2286
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
One, 37 in a row

2287
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Close, it is the

2288
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
20th expansion for EverQuest

2289
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Can you imagine? How many has World of Warcraft had?

2290
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
4? 5?

2291
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
5. 5. Is it?

2292
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Yeah, 5. So hopefully a 6

2293
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Burning Crusade

2294
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Wrath of the Lich King

2295
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Cataclysm, Pandaria is a 4

2296
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Woah, Pandas. It's a 4

2297
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Because Vanilla doesn't count as a suspension

2298
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
But we all know a 5th is coming

2299
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
You know, at Blizzcon this year

2300
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
How many people have they lost now?

2301
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
It's going down

2302
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
They were 7.7 as of the last courthouse

2303
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Yeah, we'll see

2304
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
But 7.7 is still way more than any other MMO

2305
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
So we'll see

2306
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Well, I don't know

2307
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
We could get into a longer discussion on this

2308
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
About how League of Legends has a heck of a lot of people playing that

2309
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
But it's not really measured the same way

2310
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
But anyway, that's another discussion

2311
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Back to EverQuest, Call of the Forsaken

2312
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Is the 20th expansion

2313
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Where you will face off against the Dragon Lady

2314
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Lendenaria

2315
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
And return peace to the world of Norrath

2316
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
As the way these things go

2317
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Two shared bank slots

2318
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
A new heroic adventure system

2319
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
New gear, new raids

2320
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
EverQuest 2 is getting its 10th expansion

2321
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Tears of Vashon

2322
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
A new channeler class coming in with that

2323
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
I think one thing that caught a lot of people's attention

2324
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
However, is the news on EverQuest Next

2325
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
EverQuest Next

2326
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Was shown just a little tidbits

2327
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
And a website up

2328
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
But EverQuest Next will have destructible environments

2329
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
And it's not like a total sandbox

2330
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Like playground

2331
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
There will be restrictions on what you can

2332
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
And what you can't destroy

2333
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
But what I thought about this

2334
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
There's this whole other kind of section to it

2335
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Where people will be able to build their own stuff

2336
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
And maybe sell it

2337
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Like a little transaction place

2338
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
And EverQuest Next is going to be a free thing

2339
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
I felt like a little bit of Minecraft inspiration here

2340
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
And a lot of the screenshots look really good

2341
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
And I was like, okay

2342
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Being able to craft in-game and then sell it

2343
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Depending on whether it has a real money aspect

2344
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Or what

2345
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
That's very Second Life

2346
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Landmark is the name of what I was thinking of

2347
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
You can construct a structure on a plot of land

2348
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
That you claim in the world

2349
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
And then you can sell it in the Player Studios marketplace

2350
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
For use in EverQuest Next

2351
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
So

2352
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
That's very Second Life

2353
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Who's going to build the gigantic penis first?

2354
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
I guess

2355
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
I'm assuming these things have to be screened

2356
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Oh Rob, not everybody's into penis

2357
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Okay

2358
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Then boobies

2359
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Anyhow, also

2360
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
It should be mentioned that there's also

2361
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
An iOS and Android app

2362
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Happening called EverQuest Worlds

2363
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Quests and minigames that will

2364
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Tie into lore content and rewards

2365
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
In the EverQuest franchise

2366
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
That app is free and available now

2367
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
If you're an EverQuest fan, there's a lot going on

2368
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Right now

2369
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Pretty cool

2370
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Teto13811 in our chat says

2371
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
EverQuest meets Minecraft

2372
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Which is kind of cool

2373
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
I like the idea of that

2374
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Let's see

2375
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Trying to see if anybody else is talking about it

2376
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
At

2377
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Live.vognetwork.com

2378
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
I see some comments on the Microsoft point card thing

2379
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Tigerclaw says

2380
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
What's going to happen, I think, is Microsoft will replace

2381
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Those points card with the ones similar to PlayStation Network

2382
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Where you can buy a $20 or $50 card

2383
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Yeah, I think that's pretty much exactly what's happening

2384
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Yeah

2385
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
That comment might have come in before you read that

2386
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Alright, anyhow

2387
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
That does it for the news

2388
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
For part A

2389
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
But we can't wrap this up

2390
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Until we take a trip down memory lane

2391
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:27,000
It's a segment we call the classic game of the week

2392
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Where Dark Sakura is going to step into the gaming vault

2393
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
And find a game that she thinks, hey

2394
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Listen

2395
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
And play this game

2396
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
I see what you did there

2397
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week

2398
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Classic game of the week is Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time

2399
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
I told you guys, right?

2400
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Like, I mean, she has to do it eventually, right?

2401
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
That's a really obscure deep cut, Dark Sakura

2402
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
Right

2403
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Okay, then we'll do Panorama Cotton again

2404
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Jeez, Rammoral Dragon

2405
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
You can't do the same game twice

2406
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Even though you totally did it once

2407
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
You know what, Rob, you know what, you know what, you know what

2408
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
What?

2409
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
So, I had to pick this music to start off with

2410
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Anyway, the Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time

2411
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Also known in Japan as

2412
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Zeru no Densetsu Toki no Ocarina

2413
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Is, um

2414
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
The Nintendo 64 Zelda option

2415
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
The very first one that came out

2416
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
It came out in Japan on November 21st, 1998

2417
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
And North America November 23rd

2418
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
And in Europe December 11th, same year

2419
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
It was originally developed for the

2420
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Nintendo 64 Double D

2421
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
And it came out in Japan on November 21st, 1998

2422
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
And North America November 23rd

2423
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
And in Europe December 11th, same year

2424
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Originally developed for the Nintendo 64 Double D

2425
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
But instead came out on

2426
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Excuse me

2427
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
But instead came out for

2428
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
The, uh

2429
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Nintendo 64

2430
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
So, um

2431
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
You play as Link, you go through Hyrule

2432
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
You have a, you know, completely open world

2433
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
I mean, for as small as it was

2434
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
It was an open world

2435
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
And you had to do several different things

2436
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
You time traveled, you had to solve different puzzles

2437
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
It's a Zelda game

2438
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
But it was the first of its type

2439
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
I really think

2440
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
It was, it had a really good story

2441
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
It was really in depth

2442
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
It had some very weird stuff going on in it

2443
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
But it didn't have that stupid moon

2444
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
And it didn't have Tingle

2445
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
So, it was a lot better than Majora's Mask

2446
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Rude

2447
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
I know

2448
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Also, um, the Guinness Book of World Records

2449
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
Said that Ocarina of Time was the highest rated

2450
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Game ever reviewed

2451
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
And, uh

2452
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Also for 2008 and 2010

2453
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
So, it gets a lot of love

2454
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Um, there was also, um

2455
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Some re-releases

2456
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
One of them was the Ocarina of Time Master Quest

2457
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
That had, uh

2458
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
The dungeons redone with new puzzles

2459
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
And then the collector's edition

2460
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Which was a port for, uh

2461
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
GameCube, which

2462
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
We have that

2463
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
I've actually got the gold cartridge for

2464
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Nintendo 64, which has some fun glitches

2465
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
In it

2466
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
You can do some, uh

2467
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Different fun stuff

2468
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
So, anyway, um, like I said

2469
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Roleplay game, uh, had different elements

2470
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Has a Z-targeting

2471
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
That, uh, basically lets you

2472
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Lock onto another item

2473
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
So that you can focus on it

2474
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
And kill it easier

2475
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
That game did give me some different perspective issues

2476
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
But, you know, you also do

2477
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Quest for the NPC, so it has a slightly

2478
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
MMO quality to it

2479
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Um, you know, just that RPG element

2480
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
And so, basically, you have to get the Master Sword

2481
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Kill Ganon, save Zelda

2482
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
The end, which is typical

2483
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Uh

2484
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
Basically with this game

2485
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
It had, like I said

2486
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Some various ports, re-releases

2487
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
It was re-released, um

2488
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
On the GameCube as an emulated ROM

2489
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
And it also had that, uh

2490
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Master Quest with it

2491
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
And it was part of the Legend of Zelda Collector's Edition

2492
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Um

2493
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
It also, uh

2494
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
The Japanese version was called

2495
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Toki no Ocarina GC Ura

2496
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Um

2497
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Let's see

2498
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
It also, uh, we had other, uh, versions

2499
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
That came out with, uh

2500
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
A GBA re-release of A Link to the Past

2501
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
You could buy it on Virtual Console

2502
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Basically, it was available

2503
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Bless you

2504
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Um

2505
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
It was available, you know, for a while

2506
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Now, like I said, there was a 64 double D version

2507
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
That was planned

2508
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Not as Zelda, but, um

2509
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
It was supposed to expand the game outside of the cartridge limits

2510
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
And that's where that Master Quest came from

2511
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Which is why the Japanese version

2512
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Was called Ura

2513
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Uh, we have the game on the 3DS

2514
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Which is

2515
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
The game

2516
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
And, uh

2517
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
They probably have a

2518
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Well, like it's saying here, they've actually fixed up

2519
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Quite a few things that were wrong with it

2520
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Um, the audio was, of course, done by Koji Kondo

2521
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Rob's playing my favorite music in the game right now

2522
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
The, uh

2523
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Get it out of the valley

2524
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
I have a special love of, uh

2525
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Classical guitar

2526
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Um, so anyway, yeah

2527
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
The game is like one of the

2528
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Most loved Nintendo games of all time

2529
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
It's definitely, I would say

2530
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Probably one of the best that ever came out

2531
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
On the Nintendo 64

2532
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
So we're just looking at an instant classic

2533
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
When it came out, especially given

2534
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
How pretty it was when it came out

2535
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
And, now this is something that's

2536
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Actually important to me

2537
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
And I even remember this, because this was actually

2538
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
The first time I heard of Philip Glass

2539
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
They compared a lot of Koji Kondo's music

2540
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
In this to Philip Glass

2541
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
And, basically

2542
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Um

2543
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
This composer came into

2544
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Discussion recently

2545
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
In, uh, helping people with

2546
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Autistic meltdowns overcome them

2547
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
By listening to minimalist music

2548
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
And I, it made me think

2549
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
That back, you know, when I was, you know

2550
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Playing through this game, if ever I found

2551
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Myself in, uh

2552
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
A situation where I felt

2553
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Overwhelmed, I'd go listen to Zelda music

2554
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
And calm down, the same way I listened to Philip Glass

2555
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
And calm down, so I thought it was very

2556
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Interesting that that stylistic

2557
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Uh, comparison was drawn between the music

2558
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
And that I react to both of them in the same way

2559
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
So it was pretty cool

2560
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
This was the game that made me

2561
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Go out and buy an N64

2562
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Unpopular opinion time, but I

2563
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Played Mario 64 for about 30 minutes

2564
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
And I'm like, this is confusing and weird, I don't like it

2565
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
This is muddy as shit

2566
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
I was at, I was the age

2567
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Where being a fanboy came to you very easily

2568
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
I was what, what year was this?

2569
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
97?

2570
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
Yeah, I've been like 18 or 19, yeah

2571
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Yeah, or 19 or 20, so yeah, being a fanboy came

2572
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Very naturally to me, um, but for this

2573
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
I was like, okay, this 3D is amazing

2574
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
And I bought Ocarina of Time

2575
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
With an N64, bought them both, took them up

2576
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Up to the counter at Electronics Boutique

2577
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
And, um, I bought other N64 games

2578
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Like Ogre Battle 64

2579
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Paper Mario, never played them

2580
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Bought them, never played them, I played Ocarina

2581
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Beat it, never touched my N64 again

2582
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
See, my Rabid fanboy thing

2583
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Which, you know, to some extent

2584
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Still kind of holds to this day, is

2585
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
I really resented the transition to 3D

2586
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
And I just always preferred A Link to the Past

2587
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
And I think I still do to this day

2588
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
I just, you know, and I understand why this game has this

2589
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
I don't think this is a bad game

2590
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
So get off my back

2591
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
It's not my thing

2592
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
I had a really hard time adjusting to the 3D

2593
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Just like with me, you know, my unpopular opinion

2594
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
I guess, is that

2595
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
I liked Wind Waker better than

2596
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
Ocarina of Time

2597
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
The visuals just

2598
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Turned me off so much from the game

2599
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
That maybe I just didn't give it a chance

2600
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
But I just don't care

2601
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
I mean, I liked Wind Waker

2602
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
I really honestly wish it carried on with that kind of visual style

2603
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Because imagine recreating

2604
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
A Link to the Past in that style

2605
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Where it's full 3D

2606
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
That'd be fucking amazing

2607
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
And at one point, spoiler, in Wind Waker

2608
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
You kind of see what that might have been like

2609
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
And I was just like

2610
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Why don't they do that?

2611
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Why didn't they do something like that?

2612
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
I would be cool to see them do like

2613
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
A remake of Ocarina of Time

2614
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Like HD, you know

2615
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Actually, not just up res everything

2616
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
But recreate the game

2617
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Redo all the 3D visuals

2618
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
What if they did it in the style of Twilight Princess?

2619
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
See, I didn't really play Twilight Princess

2620
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
I bought it, and I didn't really

2621
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Twilight Princess was finally when I came around to accept the 3D Zelda

2622
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Twilight Princess was great

2623
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
There's a part in this game, Ocarina of Time

2624
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
That did make me a little emotional too at that age

2625
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
I was very sad

2626
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
The green girl, the little forest girl

2627
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Who has a crush on Link

2628
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Sorry, yeah

2629
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
When you are older and you have to find the seven sages

2630
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
That are going to banish Ganon

2631
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
She's one of them, and there's this scene where now

2632
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
She has to go off and she's never going to see Link again

2633
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
And he's older and she's the same age

2634
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
And you can kind of tell that she has a thing for him

2635
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
I just was very like

2636
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
I teared up at that

2637
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
She was a very sad character for me

2638
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
But how many of us that played the game

2639
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Screamed at the owl when you accidentally made him start over?

2640
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Yeah, yeah

2641
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam

2642
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Did you hear what I said? No

2643
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
You're like, exit, exit, exit

2644
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Shit

2645
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
So yeah, Saria, that was it

2646
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
I knew it was something like that

2647
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
So yeah, Ocarina of Time

2648
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
It was a great game

2649
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
I think some people underappreciated it

2650
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
But it was the one

2651
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
That bridged the gap from

2652
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
The old era to the new

2653
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
And for me

2654
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
There was just so much stuff in it

2655
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
I loved the Gerudo

2656
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
I loved going around

2657
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:26,000
And the one level that I really hated doing though

2658
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Was the cave

2659
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
That was all spirally

2660
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
That was kind of a pain in the butt

2661
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
There was also the water dungeon or the ice dungeon

2662
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
And Zelda is notorious for having ice dungeons

2663
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Where you're like, fuck

2664
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
The water dungeon was actually really fun to me

2665
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
But it was also probably one of the only levels in that game

2666
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
That made me actually sick

2667
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
So yeah, Ocarina of Time

2668
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Alright

2669
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
And I'll even say that to this day

2670
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
The best way I like to play it

2671
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Is busting out the 64

2672
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Popping in that gold cartridge

2673
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
I'm getting my link on

2674
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Alright

2675
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
There it is folks, your classic game of the week

2676
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Legend of Zelda

2677
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
The Ocarina of Time

2678
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
One of the true true classes

2679
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
Considered by some to be the greatest game of all time

2680
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
So there you go

2681
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
The Guinness Book of World Records said something about it

2682
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Alright

2683
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
We got plenty more Orange Launch Radio to come

2684
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
After a quick break

2685
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
We're going to do some rapid fire news of course

2686
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
We're going to talk about some of the game recording stuff

2687
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
For Xbox One and PlayStation 4

2688
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Little clarifications coming out on that this week

2689
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
And Nintendo fighting piracy

2690
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Yet again we'll talk more about that

2691
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
And some rumors about the PlayStation Vita

2692
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
That's right, the Vita, it's not gone

2693
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
So we got news on all of that

2694
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
When we come back after a quick break with more

2695
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Of Orange Lounge Radio

2696
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio

2697
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Episode number 515

2698
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Already in progress

2699
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Tonight is August 11th of 2013

2700
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
And having a pretty busy show here

2701
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Back after a week off of course

2702
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
We weren't here last week unfortunately

2703
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
But getting back in full swing

2704
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Talking about games such as Hotline Miami

2705
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Which the live listeners heard a couple tracks from the

2706
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Soundtrack

2707
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
I like that, I hadn't heard any of the music yet

2708
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
I like the second song a lot more than the first

2709
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
But that was really good

2710
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
I like that

2711
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Good choice Alan

2712
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Alright

2713
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Before we get into some rapid fire news

2714
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
I just kind of wanted to plug a couple appearances

2715
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
On other podcasts because I've kind of been on a roll lately

2716
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
I don't know what it's about but

2717
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
I will take it because I love

2718
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Guesting on other shows and supporting

2719
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Independent broadcasting and podcasting

2720
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
In general so I just wanted to throw out a couple

2721
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Plugs

2722
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
One of them is a new project for our friends over

2723
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
At popcolts.com

2724
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
You remember Tiara

2725
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
And you might know Dan Shadow, I think they've both been on the show

2726
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
At one point or another and some other friends

2727
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
All did this thing called Order of the Chocobo

2728
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Which was a Google hangout, it was actually a video thing

2729
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
That was fun, we had to make

2730
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
A list, it was kind of like listless

2731
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
But not really, making the definitive

2732
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
List of the top 10 Final Fantasy

2733
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Characters

2734
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
I was very humbled by what a civil discussion it was

2735
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
I was expecting hair pulling

2736
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
And chair throwing and I was very happy

2737
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
With the way the list turned out so check that out

2738
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Popcolts.com has the archive of that available

2739
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Also just today

2740
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
I taped a spot for a podcast

2741
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Called Game On

2742
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Epic Slam Press Edition and that's a part of

2743
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
MMORPG.com

2744
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Real quick show, it's only about 30-45 minutes

2745
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
But they were kind enough to have me on today

2746
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Good guys over there so I believe

2747
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
That will be up on Monday so check that out

2748
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
I get to talk a bit about Final Fantasy 14

2749
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
And you guys all know I have the other show Horde House

2750
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
So I got to speak a little bit about some MMOs

2751
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
They were talking about Rift and some of the other changes

2752
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Going on at Triumph so that was pretty exciting

2753
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
I guess I should give another

2754
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Plug because I don't know if I remembered it to mention it

2755
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Two weeks ago but on the last

2756
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Gamebuoy.org show

2757
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Which was about music games

2758
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
I was on that show and that's up on their feed now

2759
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
And it might be getting

2760
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Bumped by the time you hear this by their

2761
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Most recent show they did today

2762
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Which I think they did about GamerX

2763
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
But look for the show on their feed about music games

2764
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
We had a great time, it was like a three hour show

2765
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
So it would have been a great way to fill

2766
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
The time last week with no OLR

2767
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
So check that out

2768
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
I'm having fun guessing on other podcasts

2769
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
I'm always happy to guest on other shows

2770
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
I know Loki and Dark Sakura also willing as well

2771
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Be sure to hit us all up on Twitter

2772
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
If you want to know our individual Twitter accounts

2773
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
Best way to get ahold of me on Twitter

2774
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Twitter.com slash S-K-I-E

2775
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
That's Skye but S-K-I-E

2776
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Dark Sakura?

2777
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Like I check Twitter

2778
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
It's Dark Sakura

2779
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
It's the best way to get ahold of me

2780
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
I'm always happy to guest on other shows

2781
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
I'm always happy to guest on other shows

2782
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Dark Sakura

2783
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
It's the best way to get ahold of me

2784
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
D-A-R-K-S-A-K-U-R-A

2785
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Or you can message me through Tumblr

2786
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
I was going to say the tumbles

2787
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
I tumble a lot more

2788
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
It's Kurotsubasa

2789
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
K-U-R-O-U-T-S-U-B-A-S-A

2790
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Just think Blackwing

2791
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
If you message me on

2792
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
The Twitter I will eventually see it

2793
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
And Loki, I don't know what's the best way

2794
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
For them to get you, Twitter?

2795
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Twitter is fine

2796
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
K-U-R-O-U-T-S-U-B-A-S-A

2797
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Twitter is fine

2798
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Alright, well let's get into some

2799
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Rapid fire news and talk about what else

2800
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Is going on in the gaming world this week

2801
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Loki, why don't you start us off

2802
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
This isn't the first time games tried something like this

2803
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
Where they put up a really expensive

2804
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Ridiculous bundle for

2805
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
An upcoming game, I think they did something like that

2806
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
For Formula One

2807
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
I think it was Formula One 2012

2808
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Where they actually had a Formula One

2809
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
Car as part of the bundle

2810
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
But this is the Saints Row IV

2811
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
The super dangerous

2812
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
WOD WOD edition

2813
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
AKA the million dollar pack

2814
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
It is exactly one million dollars

2815
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
There is only one available

2816
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
And it includes the following

2817
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Saints Row IV, the Commander in Chief edition

2818
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
A Virgin Galactic space flight

2819
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
A full size replica of the dubstep gun

2820
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
A hostage rescue experience

2821
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Plastic surgery

2822
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Spy training day

2823
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
A personal shopper

2824
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
A capsule wardrobe

2825
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
From all the Saints Row stuff

2826
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Seven nights at the top

2827
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Royale suite

2828
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
In Dubai

2829
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
And a partridge in a pear tree

2830
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
A week for two at the Jefferson Hotel

2831
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
In Washington D.C.

2832
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
A first class flight to Washington D.C.

2833
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
In Dubai

2834
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Lamborghini

2835
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
A new Toyota Prius Plus

2836
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
A year's insurance

2837
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
And a year's supercar membership

2838
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
One million dollars

2839
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Which apparently is not a very good deal

2840
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
But my thing is though

2841
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
It's one million dollars

2842
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
And they couldn't even bother to

2843
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Throw in the season pass DLC

2844
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
I mean really

2845
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
This reminds me of how

2846
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Like in WoW there are players with

2847
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
Phenomenal amounts of money

2848
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
That they didn't buy from a gold farmer

2849
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
That they just have in every expansion

2850
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Blizzard has to put in some mount

2851
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Or some treasure thing that costs like

2852
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Gold for like the alchemy mount

2853
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
You have too much gold

2854
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Make this thing

2855
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
That's what this is but in real life

2856
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
You have too much money

2857
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Here's a money sink for you

2858
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Just reminded me of what I should have done

2859
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
In WoW before I left

2860
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
That was by the Time Dragon thing

2861
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
I think this is one of those stupid things

2862
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
That generates blog headlines

2863
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Across the internet and oh look

2864
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
It worked

2865
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Whatever

2866
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
You know what if I had a million dollars

2867
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
You know what I would do

2868
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
I would just buy the Bugatti and leave it alone

2869
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Honestly though it's not really worth it

2870
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
I think they've had a few sites that have actually

2871
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Broken down cost wise

2872
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
And it ends up being about $600,000 worth of product

2873
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
So you're kind of overspending

2874
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
But if you have a million dollars to drop on a game

2875
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Then you probably don't give a shit about money

2876
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
And you know

2877
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Bill Gates I'm looking at you come on you're a

2878
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Real fan right? Honestly if I had a million dollars

2879
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
I'd buy a house

2880
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
And pay my bills

2881
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
But if you had so much money

2882
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
Like millions of dollars

2883
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
This is for the 1%

2884
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
If I magically became the 1%

2885
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
I think my brain would explode

2886
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
I would know what to do

2887
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
If you're so rich you have no idea how much money

2888
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Exactly you have because the stock market

2889
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Fluctuates so much each day then this is for you

2890
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
When you're so rich you don't know how much money you have

2891
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
If I had a million dollars I'd invest

2892
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
And make a million more

2893
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Just saying

2894
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
If I had just one million dollars I'm not going to buy

2895
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
A fucking game with it I mean that's stupid

2896
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
If I had lots and lots of money

2897
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
Like billions of dollars

2898
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Then yes I would drop a million dollars on a fucking game

2899
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Because no one thought that they would purchase it

2900
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
And I'd be like ha I fucking purchased it

2901
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Next story

2902
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
So this is kind of cool news

2903
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
For the Oculus Rift

2904
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
They're actually

2905
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
They have a new

2906
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Chief Technical Officer

2907
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
And that's coming from

2908
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
John Carmack

2909
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
The co-founder of id

2910
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Of course big fan of VR

2911
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
And now

2912
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Going to be a part of the team to make the Oculus Rift

2913
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Awesome

2914
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
So neat

2915
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
We'll have to see what that comes

2916
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
What's going to come out of that

2917
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
And then last but not least

2918
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
The thing that's been kind of taking up a few days

2919
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Of my time at least not entirely

2920
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
It's this website called Salty Bet

2921
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
It's really

2922
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
I don't know it's kind of funny

2923
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
It's basically a website

2924
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
That you go and you sign up

2925
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
And you get fake money

2926
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
You bet on PC

2927
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Controlled Mugen fights

2928
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
And for those that don't know what Mugen is

2929
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
It is a basically create your own

2930
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Fighting game type thing

2931
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
And so there's characters from Street Fighter

2932
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
From all the different fighting series

2933
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
You can possibly imagine and a bunch of other made up stuff

2934
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
So you get like

2935
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
For example in this screenshot here

2936
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
It's the same battle between Popeye and Ash

2937
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
From the Evil Dead versus

2938
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Duck Dodgers

2939
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
And Spawn

2940
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Just like weird shit like that

2941
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
If it's a character that had a sprite made of it

2942
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
During the Genesis slash SNES

2943
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Era then that sprite has probably been

2944
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Imported into Mugen and made a character

2945
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
I watched a fight that took place versus

2946
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
A Dragon Ball Z character and

2947
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Fat Albert

2948
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Hey hey hey

2949
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
I watched one earlier today

2950
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Popeye versus some other random

2951
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Street Fighter character and Pop

2952
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Not Popeye, Ronald McDonald

2953
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Versus some random Street Fighter character

2954
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Piccolo

2955
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
And Ronald McDonald just kicked the shit out of

2956
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Piccolo

2957
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Because he's such an overpowered character that

2958
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Someone created because they're like

2959
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Ronald McDonald is a fighting character

2960
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
But yeah it's kind of fun

2961
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Saltybet.com

2962
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
You sign up you get 400 fake dollars

2963
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
And then you go and you bet

2964
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
I want to watch a Daisy

2965
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Fight for that hidden eye

2966
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Eye beam attack that Mugen

2967
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
Daisy has

2968
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
From Mario Kart

2969
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
I'd have to

2970
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
I'd have to see that but yeah it's funny

2971
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
And they've got like it's just this

2972
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Twitch stream that they have and

2973
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
You bet stuff and you can even they have a

2974
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Chat window and stuff on there you can

2975
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Check stuff out but like there's like people with a ton

2976
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Of money like I'm like how many fucking hours are you

2977
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Spending on this thing? It's ridiculous

2978
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
And I always bet on the losers

2979
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Apparently because it's like

2980
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
How do you pick you know who's gonna win

2981
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Between like some

2982
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
Random anime chick and this

2983
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
This weird screen cap of a

2984
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
Football or you know a soccer player

2985
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Or something like that it's conversations you had

2986
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
When you were 10 I bet

2987
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
That Superman would lose a fight against that one

2988
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Battletoad like I mean that's what

2989
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Mugen is basically once I tried

2990
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
To like find Mugen and install it

2991
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
And get some character packs I couldn't figure

2992
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
Out where the hell this thing is like it's buried

2993
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
On some Japanese forum somewhere I just

2994
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Tried to Google download Mugen play

2995
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Mugen for example I'm gonna tell you something

2996
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
I have a disc from 7 years ago

2997
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
A CD from 7 years ago that has an

2998
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Install of Mugen on it I don't know who these

2999
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Characters I mean I know who one of these characters

3000
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Is but I don't know who both these characters is but right now

3001
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Are you salty betting during the show?

3002
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
No right now they have it's it's Fox

3003
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
McCloud versus Hawkage I guess

3004
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
He's from looks like Naruto

3005
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,200
Um so

3006
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:10,000
Hakage?

3007
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
Hakage I guess yes I can't I can't

3008
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Fucking read Japanese today

3009
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Hakage so it's Fox McCloud versus

3010
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Hakage and Fox McCloud yes Fox McCloud

3011
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Is definitely favored

3012
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
To win so but uh yeah

3013
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Just an example of some of the matchups you see

3014
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
Right there I don't know I had it on the other

3015
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
Day while I was doing other things and they thought

3016
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
It was funny all right let's move

3017
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
On now earlier in the show

3018
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
I was yelled out

3019
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Yelled at in private message by

3020
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
My good pal Shane Alinko

3021
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
When I said that I was most

3022
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Looking forward to on the 3DS the

3023
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
Link Between Two Worlds

3024
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Zelda remake because he said how dare you

3025
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Pokemon X and Y still isn't out

3026
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
So fine here you go Shane

3027
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Here's a Pokemon X and Y story

3028
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
For me to butcher and it's

3029
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
About something you were expressing to me earlier this week

3030
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Mega Evolutions

3031
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
That's right the Pokemon company

3032
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Unveiled more information

3033
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
On Mega Evolutions

3034
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Such as Mewtwo

3035
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Can undergo this change during battle

3036
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
But the effects would only last for the duration of the battle

3037
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
In order for this to happen

3038
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Pokemon has to hold a mega stone

3039
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Item but there are

3040
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Different ones unique to different creatures

3041
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
In order to get these abilities

3042
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
There were also new screens and there was a new

3043
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Trailer that was released for this

3044
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
That talks about how to use this

3045
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
What is this super training is also

3046
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
A thing where you can increase a Pokemon's

3047
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Base stats by playing mini games

3048
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Such as a soccer style game

3049
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
And core training workouts as well

3050
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
That will allow your Pokemon to slowly improve

3051
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Their stats on their own

3052
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
I want to hear more about the fashion shoots and all that

3053
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
Kind of crap that they're going to have in the game

3054
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
And when this story was announced all of the

3055
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
Pokemon theory crafters and min-maxers

3056
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Simultaneously got a boner and an aneurysm

3057
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
Act Deaf

3058
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
Says Digimon will sue

3059
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Pokemon min-maxers

3060
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
Are crazy

3061
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
It's one of the reasons I can't

3062
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Get into Pokemon as much as some

3063
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
People like Shane is that there's

3064
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
There's too fucking much

3065
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Like it's just like oh my god

3066
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
It's like I gotta do this and then I gotta get these

3067
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
Items and I gotta min-max this and I gotta do

3068
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
A fucking fashion shoot on the side like

3069
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
God damn

3070
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
You know what? I was fine with

3071
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
151 Pokemon

3072
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
I was fine with taking their pictures in Snap

3073
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
Yeah that was fun

3074
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
The rest of this shit is too much

3075
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
You know okay I did get some free plushies

3076
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
At E3 which I gave to Julie

3077
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
But you know what?

3078
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Shane does have a career

3079
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
The new bunny Pokemon is super cute by the way

3080
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
He's super derpy and I love it

3081
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
I wanna see the derpiness

3082
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Although I do like when people do

3083
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Memes with the old

3084
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
That looks like a derp

3085
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Isn't he adorable though?

3086
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
What is up with those ears?

3087
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
He's kind of like the

3088
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
What's the one they have all the memes about?

3089
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
Psyduck?

3090
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
The beaver

3091
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
The beaver looking one

3092
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Bidoof

3093
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
Squirtle help I'm on fire

3094
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
LOL Bidoof

3095
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
Squirtle I'm dying

3096
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
I haven't seen this

3097
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
Alright

3098
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
I just like the Diglett memes

3099
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
Far too much Pokemon content for one show

3100
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Shut it down

3101
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
Hearthstone is Blizzard's free to play

3102
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Card game

3103
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
It's gonna be in beta soon

3104
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
And they're saying it's not really

3105
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
But it's not far away either

3106
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
I'm not sure what the hell that's supposed to mean

3107
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
But they're saying here's the quote about it

3108
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
We're not days away from launching

3109
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
The beta but we're not months away

3110
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
Either

3111
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
At the Hearthstone announcement we committed into going to beta testing

3112
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
Before the summer was over

3113
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
And the team has been pulling out all the stops to make that happen

3114
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Well if you think about it summer isn't really over

3115
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Until September 21st

3116
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
So there's still a little bit of time

3117
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
But one can hope it will be there

3118
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
Before the end of August

3119
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
For Saints Row 4

3120
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Even I'm excited about this game honestly

3121
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
I gotta get it at some point

3122
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
The soundtrack list has been revealed

3123
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
109 tracks in this game

3124
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
Good lord

3125
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
I am not gonna read all 109 songs

3126
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
Off of this list

3127
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
But I will just point out

3128
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
Especially because there's a lot of classical songs

3129
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
Since they have the classical station

3130
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
But I will point out I was very excited to see

3131
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Hadaway What Is Love is in the game

3132
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
And apparently it's one of those songs that's used at a key moment

3133
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
Opposites Attract

3134
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Do the safety dance

3135
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Montel Jordan

3136
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
This is how we do it

3137
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
I just laughed because Oh Shit is in it

3138
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Lump by Pussa

3139
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Oh Shit is in it

3140
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Obviously the mix station is gonna be the best

3141
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
Saints Row 4 soundtrack

3142
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
More information there

3143
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
DarkSakura

3144
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
What do you got?

3145
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Well I have some stuff

3146
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
First of all there is a Tomb Raider

3147
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Sequel that has been confirmed

3148
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
By the Square CEO

3149
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
Well at least the American slash

3150
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
European Phil Rogers

3151
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
CEO

3152
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
Basically they're also gonna be doing

3153
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
A comic book that

3154
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
Is a bridge between the games

3155
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
And I knew about this because Gail Simone

3156
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
Actually said something about it and you know I follow her Tumblr

3157
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
She

3158
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Sorta let that slip early

3159
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
So I'm looking forward to that

3160
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Cause I have liked what I've played so far

3161
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
With Tomb Raider I just need to play more of it

3162
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
Or as we call it here at OLR

3163
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Girl

3164
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
Lara Croft's

3165
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Incredible no good

3166
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
Very bad day

3167
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
Whatever that book was called

3168
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
And then there is a fan

3169
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Petition out for Smash Brothers

3170
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
And they want to make

3171
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Reggie Fils-Aime a playable character

3172
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
Yep you can sign

3173
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
The Nintendo and that he

3174
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
Uses Nintendo controllers and characters

3175
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
To his advantage as attacks

3176
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
And

3177
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
They are basically

3178
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
Encouraging Twitter users to

3179
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
Basically message Masahiro Sakurai

3180
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
To

3181
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Have Reggie in the game

3182
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
I think that would be awesome

3183
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
He has to have

3184
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
You remember Norimaro in

3185
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
Marvel Super Heroes

3186
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
He was the Japanese

3187
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
He was only the Japanese version

3188
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
The comedian who was wearing the boys uniform

3189
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
He could do a version like that for Reggie

3190
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
With the big head that's like super

3191
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
Exaggerated features and everything

3192
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
His jaw should be an attack

3193
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
I kind of agree with Fifth Dream in our chat room

3194
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
At live.vognetwork.com

3195
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
LOL fan petition

3196
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
Yeah but it would be funny

3197
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
And weirder things have happened

3198
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
By the way Tekken X Street Fighter

3199
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Is still in development

3200
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
They haven't given up and it should be

3201
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
Better than Street Fighter X Tekken

3202
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
Was

3203
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
I hate this way

3204
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
These stupid

3205
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Well let me say this from Stan in our chat room

3206
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
Because I like this comment too

3207
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
I thought Stan Lee would have been cool in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3

3208
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
Yes

3209
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
Yes

3210
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
So they're looking though

3211
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
With this to build a bigger community

3212
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
For the fighting game fans

3213
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
By combining not just putting the Tekken fans

3214
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
And the Street Fighter fans together

3215
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
But really making it one big whole community

3216
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
So we'll see

3217
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
If it's better than the Capcom attempt

3218
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
Then I'll be happy

3219
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Ta-da

3220
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
Alright there it is your rapid fire news

3221
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
Let's get to the foogle question of the week

3222
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
Every week we ask a question of our Facebook

3223
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
And Google Plus communities

3224
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
But this week was a little different

3225
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
Because unfortunately due to some of the other podcasts

3226
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
I was doing and being sick

3227
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
And having to get Jamie tonight

3228
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Because she's without a car

3229
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
My battery died

3230
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
I was not able to prep the show in a timely manner

3231
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
So I was like alright well we're not going to have enough time

3232
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
To get decent replies tonight

3233
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
So let's mix it up a little bit

3234
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
And do a segment instead

3235
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
That we have not done on Orange Lounge Radio

3236
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
In a very very long time

3237
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
It's a segment we call

3238
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
Ask Orange Lounge

3239
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
God

3240
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
Let's ask Orange Lounge

3241
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
Some stupid question

3242
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
What will we find out this week

3243
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
On Orange Lounge Radio

3244
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
I bet a lot of people

3245
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
Didn't know I usually sing the theme

3246
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
And now they're happy that we don't do this segment

3247
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
A lot anymore

3248
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
Made up every time

3249
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
Can you believe it? I'm a regular Wayne Brady over here

3250
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
Alright let's start with

3251
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Facebook

3252
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
Red the Haze starts us off tonight

3253
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
What is a man?

3254
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
A miserable little pile of secrets

3255
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
Weren't you paying attention?

3256
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Yes

3257
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
Rob himself says

3258
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
Why is there no Loki and Dan show?

3259
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
That would be epic

3260
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Why isn't there a Loki and Dan show?

3261
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
You guys should just look at each other and yell for an hour

3262
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
It'll be fun

3263
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
I would leave the house

3264
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
You wouldn't see me while the whole thing was going on

3265
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
We wouldn't yell at each other we'd probably agree a lot

3266
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
Actually yell in unison

3267
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
It would be the two dudes up in the balcony from the Muppet show

3268
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
That would be awesome

3269
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
That would be awesome

3270
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
You need to channel that

3271
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
I'm going to make the suggestion to Dan then

3272
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
That you do the Grumpy Guy show

3273
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Alright, Jose Osumu-Rigaro wants to know

3274
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
What's the one game you thought you wouldn't enjoy

3275
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
But you ended up loving

3276
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
I only asked because I thought I wasn't going to enjoy

3277
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
Hitman Absolution nearly as much as I am

3278
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
The one game you thought you wouldn't enjoy

3279
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
But you ended up loving

3280
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
Easy for me, Mass Effect

3281
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
I'd have to say

3282
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
That was one for me too

3283
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
And Borderlands 2 actually

3284
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
I like it

3285
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
Alan, anything you can think of?

3286
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
I'm blanking, I'm sorry

3287
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
That's alright, Loki, anything?

3288
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Minecraft

3289
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
Ronnie B says if you could design your own game for the Oculus Rift

3290
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
What would it be like?

3291
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
It would be like F-Zero

3292
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
If I had to do one

3293
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
It would be

3294
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
It would be

3295
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
I don't know

3296
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
I was going to try to think of something really pervy

3297
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
to say

3298
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
It would be like Superhero Dress Up

3299
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
There's plenty of perv content already on Oculus Rift

3300
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
Anybody else? Alan?

3301
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
A game like Rez

3302
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
What was that Fireworks game that was a launch game for the PS2?

3303
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
Phantom Vision

3304
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Something like that

3305
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
Phantom Vision is a fun game

3306
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
Pretty rave

3307
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Drug induced game on the Oculus Rift

3308
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
Ragenator says

3309
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
Train A is traveling south

3310
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
from Butte, Montana at 78 miles an hour

3311
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
Train B is traveling east to Pax East

3312
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
with Cliffy B as a passenger

3313
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
How much bacon can Loki eat in one sitting

3314
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
without getting explosive bacon grease diarrhea?

3315
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
That's disgusting

3316
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
He's not doing that in our apartment

3317
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
I don't

3318
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
get explosive diarrhea from bacon

3319
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
It just ends up getting so heavy

3320
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
It depends on how hungry I am

3321
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
And how crispy the bacon is

3322
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
That is what it comes down to

3323
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
How crispy the bacon is

3324
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
If it's all fatty and greasy

3325
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
You can't eat very much of it

3326
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
If it's really crispy then you can eat a ton of it

3327
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
If it's not very crispy that means it's well lubricated

3328
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
You guys are disgusting

3329
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
We didn't ask the question

3330
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
That's true

3331
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
It's Ragenator's fault

3332
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
Ragenator you're banned

3333
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
Get something to slap him with in the chat room

3334
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
I apologize for the Facebook noises

3335
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
I still haven't disabled it

3336
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
Bobby Blackwolf

3337
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
Asking the heavy hitting question here

3338
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
With all of the heavy topics

3339
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
That are discussed on OLR throughout the years

3340
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
There are many questions that one could ask

3341
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
The Lounge of Orange

3342
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
Some are philosophical, some are personal

3343
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
Others are about the best ways to roast a ferret

3344
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
However there is one question

3345
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
And one question only

3346
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
That dictates the future of gaming

3347
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
And the revelry of gaming's past

3348
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
Why the beep can you not accept

3349
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
That Chrono Trigger and Earthbound are better

3350
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
Than Super Metroid

3351
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
Because you're wrong

3352
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
What is actually a rhetorical question

3353
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
Because the only acceptable answer is

3354
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
You speak the truth Bobby

3355
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
And now I accept your conclusion as fact

3356
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
It has been written on the internet

3357
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
And lo it is true

3358
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
Well

3359
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
First of all it's pronounced gif

3360
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Second of all no

3361
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
I've actually prepared an answer

3362
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
Oh really

3363
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
For this

3364
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
So here's my answer

3365
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
Drum roll please

3366
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
One more please

3367
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
Because fuck you

3368
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
That's why

3369
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
Thank you and good night

3370
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
Do do do do do do do

3371
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
No I just

3372
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
Okay look

3373
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
There's something about the fact

3374
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
That Super Metroid is something that you can

3375
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
Play in like you know one sitting

3376
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
And really kind of do like the speed runs

3377
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
And collect all the items

3378
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
I love the music in Super Metroid

3379
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
And I don't know

3380
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
How to put my finger on it

3381
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
I just fucking love that game

3382
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
And really they don't make Metroid games like it anymore

3383
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
It's just

3384
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
But they do make Castlevania games like it

3385
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
They do they do

3386
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
And I don't hate Chrono Trigger

3387
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
And I especially don't hate Earthbound

3388
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
In fact I got Earthbound on Wii U Virtual Console

3389
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
And it's fun

3390
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
You know what I found the other day?

3391
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
Earthbound the cartridge

3392
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
Dan and I were actually playing through Super Mario World

3393
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
I asked the other game I forgot to say it was playing

3394
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
Was to cheer me up Dan and I

3395
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
Drank wine and played Super Mario World

3396
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Alright three hour show and look how many questions I gotta get through

3397
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
Alright

3398
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Tim Tripp wants to know why not Zoidberg?

3399
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
What?

3400
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
Why not Zoidberg? You're laughing over there Logan

3401
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
Is that Futurama?

3402
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
Because he sheds his skin

3403
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
And he's gross

3404
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
That show got cancelled anyway

3405
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
Didn't it?

3406
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
It got cancelled again

3407
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Stan H wants to know if you were in a Final Fantasy game

3408
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
What would be your job class?

3409
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
I want to do a summoner because I want to summon

3410
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
Cute little creatures to do my bidding

3411
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
I'd be Realm

3412
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
Where I would draw everything that I want into existence

3413
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
And have them beat the shit out of everybody

3414
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
Here's a horde of cute ponies

3415
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
Stop

3416
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
Alan?

3417
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
I'd be Sebastian because he was super hot and built

3418
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
I liked, I don't remember what the class was

3419
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
In Final Fantasy 6

3420
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
It was Edgar, I think he was like an engineer

3421
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
Or something like that, because he had a fucking chainsaw

3422
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
And that's awesome

3423
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
And he had a railgun

3424
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
Jeremy, our buddy from Koopa Club wants to know

3425
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
Do you even lift?

3426
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
No

3427
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
How much can you bench DarkSakura?

3428
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
Who's raising her hand?

3429
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
I actually don't bench, I do deadlifts

3430
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
And I'm up to 60 pounds now

3431
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
Wow

3432
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
That doesn't mean anything

3433
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
It's 2013

3434
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
Well I mean, but for the most part

3435
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
For any

3436
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
For people who don't know, I actually

3437
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
Am working into powerlifting because I can't do heavy

3438
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
Cardio because of bad joints

3439
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
God damn it, Codeman, stop setting off my Facebook

3440
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
But I actually

3441
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
Do deadlifts and

3442
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
I'm going to be starting bench pressing and doing

3443
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
Other powerlifting, so that was a good question

3444
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
I do live lifts

3445
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
Like 30 pounds, or 35 pounds

3446
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
Of live person that I lift up

3447
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
On a daily basis

3448
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
I'm going to lift this question and throw it out of the show

3449
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
Alright, Renee

3450
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
Also from Koopa Club wants to know

3451
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
What's your favorite crepe?

3452
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
Oh my god, those crepes at the

3453
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
Cute little place in Japantown

3454
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
There's this picture of me on Twitter

3455
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
With a spike from Game Buoy

3456
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
And look at the crepes

3457
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
Zoom in on the crepes in that picture because they're adorable

3458
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
They're crepes that are so cute you almost feel bad

3459
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
For wanting to eat it, but you eat it anyway

3460
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
I will say though, as far as savory crepes go

3461
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
There's a place here in Sacramento

3462
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
Called Crepeville

3463
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
They have this curry crepe that's really good

3464
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
Danielle's crepes

3465
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
In Sacramento, I was pointing out to you on the way here

3466
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
Very, very good

3467
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
Chicken crepes

3468
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
Degenerate Johnny says, since Rob often asks

3469
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
This question to every guest on OLR

3470
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
I'd like to know your answers to the question

3471
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
What is your favorite game of all time?

3472
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
Note, if you can't immediately name one game

3473
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
The closest thing would be your favorite game

3474
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
As addressed earlier in this segment

3475
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
Super Metroid

3476
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
Guardian Legend

3477
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
Valkyrie Profile

3478
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
Grand Theft Auto V

3479
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
Did you see the

3480
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
How to basic video for how to install

3481
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
Grand Theft Auto V?

3482
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
Then I watched all of his

3483
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
In fact, we were watching it at lunch

3484
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
I was showing my son

3485
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
Those videos and he's like

3486
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
What's he doing?

3487
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
Alright

3488
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
Fifth Dream says

3489
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
For each member of the cast, if you could listen

3490
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
To only one album

3491
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
For the rest of your lives

3492
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
What would you pick?

3493
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
Ooh, this is hard

3494
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
One album for the rest of your lives

3495
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
What would you pick?

3496
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
Anyone?

3497
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
Okay, Loki? Well, just because I was listening to it

3498
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
For about a couple months already

3499
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
So, Onomatoguchi

3500
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
Endless Fantasy

3501
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
Okay

3502
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
I'm not sure

3503
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
I think I know how I want to answer this

3504
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
But I'm not sure

3505
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
Okay, it would be between

3506
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
I can't narrow it down to one

3507
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
It would be between Tragic Kingdom by No Doubt

3508
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Or

3509
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
LCD Sound Systems

3510
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
Actually, I think it's going to be

3511
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
LCD Sound Systems' second album, Sound of Silver

3512
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
That would be my album

3513
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
Either it would be

3514
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill

3515
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
Or Echo Image's CompuPhonic

3516
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
No, ABBA?

3517
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
ABBA Gold? ABBA Gold, I know

3518
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
I know, but it's only one album

3519
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Only one

3520
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
For me, I'd probably have to say Pearl Jam's 10

3521
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
Because honestly, that is one of the few albums

3522
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
I can listen to all the way through

3523
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
Or maybe

3524
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
God, what was that? Beatles album

3525
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
Because now I can see it in my head

3526
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
And I know the name of it

3527
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
Revolver, Rubber Soul

3528
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
Thank you

3529
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
I knew it was one of the R ones

3530
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
But I used to own

3531
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
Actually, I do, again, own a copy of Rubber Soul

3532
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
And it's my favorite Beatles album to this day

3533
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
Those were the transitional albums where they went from

3534
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
doing bubblegum pop to the really weird

3535
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
metaphorical stuff

3536
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
Rubber Soul and Revolver

3537
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
both were such good albums

3538
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
Now we have people in the chat room

3539
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
giving their answers

3540
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
I like Teto's answer, Throwing Copper

3541
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
Metallica's Black Album was really good

3542
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
Fifth Dream, The Cure with Wish

3543
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
Ooh, another good one

3544
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
You know what I would pick for an album?

3545
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
My iTunes library

3546
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
Depends how long I've been alive

3547
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
I mean, if we're talking like, you know, I've been alive

3548
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
for hundreds of years and probably Christmas speed

3549
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
so I'd kill myself

3550
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
Alright

3551
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
Let's move on. Gamergirl says

3552
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
If Animal Crossing New Leaf really

3553
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
existed, what animal would you

3554
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
be and why?

3555
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
I wanna go last

3556
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
I'd be human. Because I'm the main character

3557
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
And I'm the fucking mayor

3558
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
So fuck all of your

3559
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
animals. I am not gonna be

3560
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
a nice dog

3561
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
like, um, what's his face in my

3562
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
town. I'm gonna hit Ed

3563
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
over the face with a bug net

3564
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
kick that bitch out of my town

3565
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
and run it for money

3566
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
Alan, you be the gay unicorn

3567
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
I'd be a

3568
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
gazelle

3569
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
Loki

3570
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
Poacher

3571
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
Which one's poacher?

3572
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
A poacher

3573
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
as in a hunter that kills the animals

3574
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
No

3575
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
Uh, and my answer is

3576
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
I would be Tom Nook. Now give me my money

3577
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
Fuck no, I have a gun

3578
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
Alright

3579
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
I'm glad none of us said

3580
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
Sahara

3581
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
Because Sahara really likes carpet

3582
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
Is that the one

3583
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Is that the one that's like a boy in the

3584
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
Japanese version? Gracie

3585
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
I would be Gracie, let's be real

3586
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
Sahara is the, uh, the wallpaper

3587
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
and carpet merchant who comes

3588
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
and redoes your house with the most god awful

3589
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
ugly shit ever that you pay three thousand bills for

3590
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
Alright, we got four more on Facebook to get through

3591
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
here. Uh, DJ Melvis

3592
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
our good pal says, it's you

3593
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
versus the Grin Reaper in a

3594
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
duel for your life. You must

3595
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
choose three different games. One

3596
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
8-bit console game, one 16-bit

3597
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
console game, and one arcade game

3598
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
open choice, to have a score

3599
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
battle or timed run against

3600
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
him. What you bring into the

3601
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
duel? You gotta throw down with the

3602
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
Grin Reaper an 8-bit game, a 16-bit

3603
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
game, and an arcade game. What you

3604
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
bring into the duel? Ooh, this

3605
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
is a toughie. I know what my time run would be

3606
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
Okay I would actually break it into Super Mario

3607
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
Brothers, the very, the first one

3608
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
I shouldn't say that about Mario 2 because

3609
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
I'm really fast on speed runs for that game

3610
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
My score one would actually

3611
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
be Kirby's Avalanche

3612
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
on Super Nintendo. Ooh, okay

3613
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
My arcade one would probably be

3614
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
the first Killer Instinct. Wow

3615
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
I was really good at it. Dang, you didn't even

3616
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
get prepped on that question in advance. Anybody

3617
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
else want to take a stab at this? I don't even know

3618
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
Anything that I was super awesome at when I was

3619
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
like 12 I'm out of practice with so I'd be

3620
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
screwed if that was the duel

3621
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
Um,

3622
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
gosh

3623
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
Tetris

3624
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
Uh, 8-bit game

3625
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
I would pick

3626
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
E.T. because I was actually fairly decent

3627
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
at that. You're going way before 8-bits

3628
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
That's like a 2-bit game

3629
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
Tetris is your 8-bit game

3630
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
Master System or

3631
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
Tetris? Yeah

3632
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
And then what's Super Nintendo?

3633
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
I have lots of points

3634
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Um,

3635
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
Kirby's

3636
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
Superstar

3637
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
I dominate that game, arcade game

3638
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
Uh,

3639
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
Klax

3640
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
Alright, um

3641
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
For me, arcade game, easy

3642
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
DDR. Even though I'm not the best

3643
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
at it, I can take on most people even in my old

3644
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
age. Death does have to deal with those heavy robes

3645
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
That's right, so uh, DDR, we're gonna throw down

3646
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
in that. 8-bit game

3647
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
Um, oh

3648
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
god, uh, anticipation

3649
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
And I get to be the heels

3650
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
And uh, 16-bit

3651
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
game

3652
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
You know, you think I would say

3653
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
Super Metroid, but I think I'm actually gonna go with

3654
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
like, I'm gonna go with Tetris Attack

3655
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
Because it was basically Pokemon Puzzle League and I was pretty good

3656
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
at that. Loki. Uh

3657
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
Dance Dance Revolution, Super Mario

3658
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
Kart, and

3659
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
8-bit

3660
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
That's kinda tough

3661
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
Um

3662
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
Mario is missing

3663
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
What did I play a lot, fuck I didn't even play that

3664
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
What the fuck did I play a lot of

3665
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
Um

3666
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
Contra? No, that's still pretty

3667
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
fucking hard. Sky Shark was fun

3668
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
Um, have I done Sky Shark?

3669
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
I don't think so

3670
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
Look it up. I don't know, fuck

3671
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
Duck Hunt, I don't know

3672
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
That's hand-eye coordination

3673
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
I should be really good at that, so

3674
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
Alright, let's move on

3675
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
Edgar R asks, which video game had

3676
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
the worst ending?

3677
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
Mass Effect 3, Mass Effect 3, Mass Effect 3

3678
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
No, because they

3679
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
actually fixed it and made it semi-decent

3680
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
even if it wasn't great

3681
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
Like, go back to like, you know

3682
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
Ghouls and Ghosts, you know, where it was like

3683
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
Congratulation

3684
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
Or it was like Ghosts and Goblins, excuse me

3685
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
Or, hey you win

3686
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
you have to do it all again

3687
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
Oh god, what games

3688
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
had really crappy endings

3689
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
Um

3690
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
I don't know

3691
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
I mean, unless there's like the ones where you die

3692
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
at the end or some shit

3693
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
Super controversial

3694
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
Final Fantasy 7, because shit

3695
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
was not finished

3696
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
If Final Fantasy 7 had come out in the age of

3697
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
the internet, it would have been a Mass Effect 3

3698
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
debacle, it really would have

3699
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
I probably would actually say the

3700
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
original state of endings for Mass Effect 3

3701
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
I did go back and watch them

3702
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
I'm very glad I

3703
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
waited to beat the games when the extended

3704
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
cut came out

3705
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
Although, I do have to say that I really

3706
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
hate that

3707
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
Happy Ending mod, it just is not good

3708
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
Oh no, no

3709
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
It doesn't even suit it

3710
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
Alright, Jon R says

3711
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
Chrono Trigger greater than Metroid less than

3712
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
Secret of Evermore, why fight it Rob

3713
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
we're all right, even Bobby for once

3714
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:11,000
The only reason I read that and entertained it was the for once part, because teehee

3715
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
Alright, Dartetsuya asks

3716
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
Remember OLR presents

3717
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
The Hunt, based on Loki's

3718
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
favorite novel, Ready Player One

3719
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
Can we find a way to do that again?

3720
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
Maybe expand it beyond classic games to include

3721
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
more geeky stuff so more of our VOG peeps

3722
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
can participate, that was kind of like

3723
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
a relay race type of thing

3724
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
using classic games, right?

3725
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
Some modern games, yeah it would be fun to do again

3726
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
It would be really cool if we could, you know, because

3727
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
our website VOG Network is a social game after all

3728
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
Not to volunteer Bobby for projects

3729
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
because I know he's got his plate full already

3730
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
but maybe in 2014 that could be some

3731
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
type of thing we look at doing

3732
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
It would be fun, yeah I'd be down for it

3733
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
By that time maybe the movie will come out

3734
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
Who knows, who knows

3735
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
I think it would be great, especially if we could tie it into

3736
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
a charity thing, like everybody has to

3737
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
pony up ten bucks to participate

3738
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
and like, you know, half the pot goes to

3739
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
a prize maybe and the other half goes to charity

3740
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
or it all goes to a charity of

3741
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
the participant's choosing or something like that, I think it would be a really

3742
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
great thing

3743
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
Or it goes to the dark sakura and needs a job fund

3744
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
That's not a registered

3745
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
charity

3746
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
Alright

3747
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
Oh my gosh

3748
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
I was going to see if there were any more questions

3749
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
We're going to keep a couple more times

3750
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
Where are we?

3751
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
Okay, one more on

3752
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
Facebook

3753
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
Code Man wants to know if you were to cosplay

3754
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
what would you cosplay as?

3755
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
Well a lot of us have cosplay

3756
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
What happens I cosplay as?

3757
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
What would you cosplay as now?

3758
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
Actually I can tell you what my next cosplay is going to be

3759
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
My friend Chadi

3760
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
who I think you might have met

3761
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
She wanted, we did a stupid

3762
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
online quiz for Homestuck about what would

3763
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
your god tier be so we were going to just do our god tier

3764
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
outfits

3765
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
Which mine would be the self of heart

3766
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
I need to cosplay as Joker

3767
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
because I got the red beard to pull it off

3768
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
so I would think

3769
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
that would be a character I'd resemble pretty well

3770
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
that I could cosplay

3771
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
I found tutorials

3772
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
Talk to me later

3773
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
Low key

3774
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
Alan, any interest in cosplaying?

3775
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
What would you cosplay as?

3776
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
Um

3777
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
I don't know

3778
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
Low key

3779
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
There you go

3780
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
Um

3781
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
I guess I would cosplay

3782
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
Actually it's funny

3783
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
There's only two things that I kind of wanted to

3784
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
cosplay just because it both involves

3785
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
building cool things

3786
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
Some sort of giant mech thing

3787
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
Although then I'd have to learn how to walk on stilts and that sounds dangerous

3788
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
Or get one of those

3789
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
costumes that's like the

3790
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
really realistic looking

3791
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
raptor dinosaur thing

3792
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
Because it'd be fun to run around with that shit

3793
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
I just want that costume

3794
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
It's pretty sweet

3795
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
I have a better answer

3796
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
A replacement answer

3797
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
Gender swapped ooh la la

3798
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
That would actually be really cool

3799
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
I would cosplay as one of the other characters

3800
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
You have like orange vinyl bell bottoms

3801
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
That's amazing

3802
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
Travis over on Google Plus

3803
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
The lone Google Plus respondent says

3804
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
Hey Robin gang just finished Tomb Raider

3805
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
And was going to start on Deus Ex Human Revolution

3806
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
Was wondering what you all thought about each game

3807
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
Loved Tomb Raider

3808
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
Didn't get a chance to play Deus Ex Human Revolution

3809
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000
You should download it quickly because it is

3810
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
free on the PlayStation Network right now

3811
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
Oh is it?

3812
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
Thanks for the tip

3813
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
And Hitman is one they just added too

3814
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
I watched, I think it was TimTrip was playing Hitman

3815
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
The new one and it looked pretty neat

3816
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
It looked like a game I would be terrible at

3817
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
And Jet Set Radio is on there free as well

3818
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
Good lord

3819
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
I was downloading Hitman today

3820
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
I'm playing Dota 2 right now

3821
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
I suck at it but I like it

3822
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
I know you Rob have been playing it

3823
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
What do you think about the learning curve of the game

3824
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
Are you having as much trouble as me?

3825
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
Keep up the good work love you guys

3826
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
Thank you Travis

3827
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
Yes I am having as much trouble as you

3828
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
You just have to jump in there and do it

3829
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
I think that's the only way

3830
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
The good news is Dota 2 has a very robust

3831
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
tutorial system

3832
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
Don't be afraid to do the single lane match

3833
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
I really learned

3834
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
I do not like playing melee classes

3835
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
But I like playing

3836
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
ranged classes

3837
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
One of the ones I really liked was The Lich

3838
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
Because it's basically a parody of

3839
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
Arnold Schwarzenegger and Batman and Robin

3840
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
Chill out

3841
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
Everybody freeze

3842
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
The Lich is like that in Dota 2

3843
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
This is my new favorite character

3844
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
So check that out

3845
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
Alright there it is

3846
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
The end of Ask Orange Lounge

3847
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
But lots of good questions

3848
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
How could we not do that

3849
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
Alright let's do some stories

3850
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
Mailbag a few of the week coming up

3851
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
Twitter topics and the skype line

3852
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
But we have some news first

3853
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
Ok so there's a quick comparison

3854
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
Because we've gotten some information about

3855
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
The DVR function

3856
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
Of those

3857
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
Different next gen consoles

3858
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
So first off

3859
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
Game DVR

3860
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
For the Xbox One

3861
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
There was a Q&A section

3862
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
I had to laugh

3863
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
So IGN did this

3864
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
Ask Microsoft

3865
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
An AMA thing that they have on

3866
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,000
Reddit and stuff

3867
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
Except that none of the people that

3868
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
You know

3869
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
I'm bringing you a handful of Ask Microsoft

3870
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
Anything answers each Monday at 2pm

3871
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
Blah blah blah

3872
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
But the people that

3873
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
Participated on IGN didn't get the fucking

3874
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
Answer any of those questions

3875
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
It was all shit from IGN

3876
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
Probably you know

3877
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
Stuff that Microsoft said

3878
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
Ok here's what we're gonna give you answers for

3879
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
So anyways so one of those things

3880
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,000
About you know

3881
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,000
The game capture stuff they're saying

3882
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
Well fours of five clips capture 1080p

3883
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
And 60 frames per second and you know

3884
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:51,000
Where can game DVR clips be uploaded to

3885
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
And they're saying game DVR clips

3886
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
Capture beautiful 720p

3887
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
30 frames per second

3888
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
Video and I believe it's up to

3889
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
Five minutes if that was correct

3890
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
One of the things that kind of sucks

3891
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:05,000
Though is you have to have Xbox Live Gold

3892
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
In order to use that feature

3893
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
So they're locking it behind a paywall

3894
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
And of course

3895
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
In typical simly fashion

3896
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
As of late

3897
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
They responded back on Twitter

3898
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
And this is from

3899
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
Shuhei Yoshida

3900
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
Basically

3901
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
Saying that hey guess what

3902
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
The Playstation 4

3903
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
DVR function will record

3904
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
Up to 15 minutes of gameplay

3905
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
In the background and won't be

3906
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
Behind a paywall you do not need Playstation

3907
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
Plus in order to access

3908
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
The game recordings or streaming functionality

3909
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
So

3910
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
Cool

3911
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
I honestly don't think this is that big a deal

3912
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
It's not a huge deal

3913
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
I mean especially since you know if you're gonna be

3914
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
Capturing video and stuff you probably

3915
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
Want to upload it but there

3916
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
You probably have your own set of equipment too

3917
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
If you're really serious about it

3918
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
I understand that but the thing was is they were

3919
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
Basically saying well it's behind a paywall because

3920
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
You know you need to upload it to the cloud

3921
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
Or something like that but if you're uploading a clip

3922
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
To YouTube

3923
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
I don't understand I guess this is what it's doing

3924
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
It's capturing a video and it's uploading it to the cloud

3925
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,000
And then you edit it in the cloud then it gets forward to the YouTube

3926
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
It just seems like a really unnecessary process

3927
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
But whatever

3928
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
I mean

3929
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
I think a lot of people are gonna be getting the Xbox

3930
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
One probably already have

3931
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
Xbox Live Gold or

3932
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
Will be getting gold and also

3933
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
Now that you only have to have one account per family

3934
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
That has gold if you're gaming on one system

3935
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
That's not a huge deal but

3936
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
Still though it does kind of suck that there's

3937
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
Yet another feature behind a paywall

3938
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
Alright well Bungie has a

3939
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
New game coming out soon Destiny and of course

3940
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
Bungie was best known as the makers of the

3941
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
Halo series for quite some time

3942
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
And you know Halo isn't

3943
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,000
Always a game known for its best online

3944
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
Behavior and not only do you have the language

3945
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
That people use on things like Xbox Live

3946
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
But then of course you know teabagging

3947
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
Corpses and everything else that people do

3948
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
So Chris Butcher

3949
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
Who is a Bungie technical director was asked

3950
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
In an interview with Edge about

3951
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
How are you gonna address

3952
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
Some of these aggressive behaviors people have

3953
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
And he's mentioning that the developers

3954
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
Are talking about positive social behavior

3955
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,000
Rewarding in these games

3956
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,000
If you look back at online multiplayer

3957
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
Gaming for the last 10 years the dominant

3958
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
Thread has been adolescent males shooting each

3959
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
Other in the face and squatting on each other's

3960
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
Corpses at least they acknowledge it

3961
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
That emerges from design decisions

3962
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
The community gets attracted towards that

3963
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
And that is popular to a lot of other people

3964
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
And so it tends to exclude others

3965
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
What they're trying to do is they want to exclude

3966
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,000
Certain in game gestures

3967
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
And have the mapping of in game gestures

3968
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
Like waving and dancing to encourage

3969
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000
More collaboration and friendliness

3970
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
Less posturing and aggression

3971
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
Here's the other quote

3972
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
You give people these tools that encourage

3973
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
Them to interact positively with each other

3974
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
And then if someone is interacting negatively

3975
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
With you well they can't ruin your

3976
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
Experience now they can just dance on your corpse

3977
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
I know it seems a little bit naive

3978
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
To me for a company that's you know did just

3979
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
That's just like trying to like say hey we're

3980
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
Giving you a game where you can draw things but we're gonna

3981
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
Band the dicks it's not gonna happen

3982
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
You're just not just

3983
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
Like if you if all you leave

3984
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
In is a little waving emote people

3985
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
Are gonna figure out how to fist each other

3986
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
Using the terrain

3987
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
That's what's gonna happen

3988
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
Come on

3989
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
But we'll see

3990
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
You underestimate their ability to

3991
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
Create lewd gestures

3992
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
But I do think rewarding good behavior is a good thing

3993
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
League of Legends does it and it feels pretty good

3994
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
When I get the little karma point after a match

3995
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
Because I was friendly to people

3996
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
I really wish WoW would implement a similar system

3997
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
So you know yeah it would be cool if they would reward

3998
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
The good behavior in Destiny but we'll see

3999
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
Where if someone gets killed by somebody else

4000
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
And they try to squad on them they get launched into space

4001
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
It would be funny

4002
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
That would be awesome

4003
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
And then people would do it on purpose to see what happens

4004
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
That would be kind of like a rad mod like you should be able to

4005
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
Carry around like little enhancements and one of them

4006
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
Could be like a time bomb

4007
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
On your corpse so somebody tries to teabag you

4008
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
It sets off the bomb and they go flying that would be funny

4009
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
Anyway

4010
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Dark Sakura

4011
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
Well in other news

4012
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
Apart from teabagging and exploding into space

4013
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
There's an ad

4014
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
That Target put out

4015
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
That shows the PS Vita

4016
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
Going for 200 bucks

4017
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
And

4018
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
Basically there hasn't been

4019
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
Like a big announcement on anything like that

4020
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
Sony didn't say anything

4021
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
But it's in a Target ad and they have to get it from somewhere

4022
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
Basically this was

4023
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
Shown on

4024
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
Blu-ray forums

4025
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
With them all being marked down to $199.99

4026
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
At Target beginning August 18th

4027
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
To August 24th

4028
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
But there's been no confirmation

4029
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
I mean this could have just been some sort of

4030
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
Photoshopping deal

4031
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
But looking at

4032
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
The image

4033
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
You can see bleed through from the other side

4034
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
For the ads on the other side

4035
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
Which is a lot

4036
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
More effort to put into photoshopping

4037
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
Than most people will do

4038
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
Also considering where it's coming from

4039
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
The Blu-ray forums they're just looking at Blu-ray

4040
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
Discounts and stuff like that

4041
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
Focusing on

4042
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
Gaming consoles

4043
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
I think if anything

4044
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
They're probably trying to clear out some inventory

4045
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
Move some of that product because they've been sitting on it for a while

4046
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
Yeah

4047
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
The first thing that I do when I see stuff like this

4048
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
Is make sure that it's not a Photoshop job

4049
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
Also

4050
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
There is a message

4051
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
From the article itself

4052
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
Saying that Inside Gaming Daily

4053
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
Reported speculation about

4054
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
Doing a $500

4055
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
Vita PS4 bundle

4056
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
Yeah I don't think they'd do that

4057
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
Like I said, speculation

4058
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
But it would kind of go in if they did decrease

4059
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
The cost of the PS Vita

4060
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
Then that would make it easier

4061
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
To bundle with the system

4062
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
For $499?

4063
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
Is that what they were saying?

4064
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
Well they were saying

4065
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
Yeah $500 bundle

4066
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
But again

4067
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
If you've got the system going up for $399

4068
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
And then you threw in a $100 Vita

4069
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
And it competes with

4070
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
Basically the

4071
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
Xbone

4072
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
You're actually getting a better deal

4073
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
With the Playstation

4074
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
It better come with a Lamborghini

4075
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
And a Virgin Galactic space flight

4076
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
And a trip to Dubai

4077
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
Maybe not

4078
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
I would rather have a system with a handheld system

4079
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
Than have to deal with the stupid Kinect bullshit

4080
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
Just saying

4081
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
It'd be nice if it was true

4082
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
I don't know if I'd want a $100

4083
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
Space flight

4084
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
That sounds kind of dangerous

4085
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
So Nintendo is fighting piracy

4086
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
And this is actually more of like

4087
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
Legit piracy

4088
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
This is coming from

4089
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
A website

4090
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
Wait wait wait

4091
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
What is legit piracy?

4092
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
Like making physical goods

4093
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
Like

4094
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
Duplicating physical goods

4095
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
For example

4096
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
They filed a lawsuit against

4097
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
Hackyourconsole.com

4098
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
Other than selling the R4 device

4099
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
And similar things

4100
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
They also happen to sell hard drives

4101
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
That are preloaded with 200 Wii games

4102
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
Hmm that sounds a

4103
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
Bit bad

4104
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
That's pretty clear cut there

4105
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
They've lawsuit against them

4106
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
And most likely

4107
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
They're probably going to win

4108
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
That's pretty clear cut

4109
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
If they were just selling the R4 devices

4110
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
I'd say that they may have

4111
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
A little bit of a fight ahead of them

4112
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
But selling actual

4113
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
You know

4114
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
Hard drives that are full

4115
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
Of

4116
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
Games that's kind of bad

4117
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
Alright

4118
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
Well I don't know what else to say about that

4119
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
I mean if you're doing some bad stuff

4120
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
You're going to get shut down eventually

4121
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
There's really no arguing that right?

4122
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
Yeah it looks like actually they've removed

4123
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
The modded Wii consoles off their site

4124
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
All right well

4125
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
Moving on to talk about

4126
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
Street Fighter 5

4127
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
Nothing's been announced

4128
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
Don't get too excited

4129
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
After all we still have Ultra Street Fighter 4

4130
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
To get through

4131
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
There's at least a dozen more adjectives they can slap on to 4

4132
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
Well you're going to have

4133
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
Alina, Rolento, Hugo

4134
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
Poison and who knows who else

4135
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
Coming to Ultra Street Fighter 4

4136
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
But here's the thing

4137
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
According to one of the producers at Capcom

4138
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
Jackie Ayano says that

4139
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
Users do not need to worry because

4140
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
The characters will definitely not be just copy and pasted

4141
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
For Street Fighter X Tekken

4142
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
If we did that they would undoubtedly be the strongest characters

4143
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
In the game so

4144
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
These characters will be redone for Ultra Street Fighter 4

4145
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
But what happens next?

4146
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
Well

4147
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
It took 6 years to go from Street Fighter 2

4148
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
To Street Fighter 3

4149
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
And 9 years to go from Street Fighter 3 to Street Fighter 4

4150
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
So it would probably take us until

4151
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
The year 2018

4152
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
Before Street Fighter 5 comes out

4153
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
So yes no Street Fighter 5 until 2018

4154
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
But look forward to

4155
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
Insert adjective here Street Fighter 4

4156
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
Each and every year until then

4157
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
Single adjective please

4158
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
In 2018 I'll be turning 40

4159
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
And that makes me sad

4160
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
And you'll be 42

4161
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
40 also

4162
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
Not 42

4163
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
But at least we'll have Street Fighter 5

4164
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
At our birthday party to celebrate

4165
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
You can both be quiet

4166
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
I have 3 years for that shit

4167
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
That's right you forgot 40

4168
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
And amazing

4169
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
Anyhow can you believe we started

4170
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
This show and I was what like

4171
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
23 or having my 24th birthday

4172
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
And

4173
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
Now we're getting old as the show's getting old

4174
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
We'll probably still be doing OLR

4175
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
Hey kids

4176
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
50 come hey kids come

4177
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
Listen to our super cool show about games

4178
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
Oh but then again all you guys

4179
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
I tried to play this Kinect shit and broke

4180
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
My hip all you guys listening you're all

4181
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
Getting older too so

4182
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
We do have listeners that are older than us

4183
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
Yeah you guys will all be like 30

4184
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
My 30's are awesome

4185
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
For the record

4186
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
Alright let's get to the mailbag

4187
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
Speaking of our listeners we love to hear from our listeners

4188
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
I mean yeah we do

4189
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
Shut up of course we do we love to hear from our listeners

4190
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
Every week and you can

Email us mailbag at

4192
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
Plowandtrader.com

4193
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
DarkSakura will be peer pressured into reading her

4194
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
Favorite emails here on the show

4195
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
Read the emails

4196
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
God dang Rob

4197
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
Hi all Ragenator here

4198
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
Here's a last second short random question

4199
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
What is the worst game each of you have played

4200
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
And what qualifies said games as being the worst

4201
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
I can tell you one that was so bad

4202
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
That Dan and I took it back to a

4203
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
Botbuster and requested a refund

4204
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
That was like some

4205
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
wrestling game it was thunder like WCW

4206
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
Thunder

4207
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
This is when we were on a really big wrestling kick

4208
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
And it was just bad

4209
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
We were like what the hell is this

4210
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
And also Spice World

4211
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
Fusion Frenzy 2 is the worst

4212
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
Game in recent memory that I've played

4213
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
It was so fucking bad

4214
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
Yaris

4215
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
That was gonna be my answer

4216
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
Me too me too

4217
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
Alright that's it

4218
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
So short

4219
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
God this is long

4220
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
With links to YouTube that I am not

4221
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
Going to address because first of all

4222
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
Can't watch YouTube on my iPad

4223
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
Thank you

4224
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
You can watch YouTube on your iPad

4225
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
Yes I can but not during the show

4226
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
Alright just to be clear

4227
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
Stop it

4228
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
Greetings OLR

4229
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
First off I hope you guys enjoyed your week off

4230
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
I might have if I still had a job

4231
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
I know we can all use one

4232
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
Anyway I thought I'd share some thoughts about

4233
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
Phil Fish's recent childish outburst

4234
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
First of all I'm greatly disappointed that you

4235
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
Guys improperly present Marcus

4236
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
Beer's complaint

4237
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
At least to me he seemed more angry than Phil Fish

4238
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
And Jonathan Blow were acting

4239
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
As though being asked questions

4240
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
Was some sort of unreasonable burden

4241
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
In case you haven't linked

4242
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
I'd certainly love to see what Phil Fish

4243
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
And Jonathan Blow said to Game Informer leading up

4244
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
To this however with only Marcus's

4245
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
Initial rant and Fish's immature response

4246
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
It just looks like a lot of grief could have

4247
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
Been saved with more

4248
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
Boilerplate non-committal response

4249
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
Which leads me to my position

4250
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
Phil Fish cancelled Fez 2 and is

4251
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
Leaving the game industry just because a few people

4252
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
Called out his condescending nonsense

4253
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
Seriously?

4254
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
I'm some

4255
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
Insignificant twit in Miami who gets

4256
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
Worse every time he sends an email to the show

4257
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
Saying something someone doesn't like

4258
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
But do you see me pitching my skirt and running away?

4259
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
No

4260
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
The only reason I haven't sent an email lately

4261
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
Is because I've not had anything to say before this

4262
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:46,000
You ask me Marcus is 100% right on this

4263
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
If you don't have anything to say

4264
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
Or you're looking for a confirmation

4265
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
You can say so

4266
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
You can give a rote

4267
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
We do not comment on rumors and speculation

4268
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
If you like

4269
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
However unless you're going to do a massive TV and radio advertisement

4270
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
Carpet bombing

4271
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
It's not a good idea to treat the press like

4272
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
They're the worst thing that's ever existed

4273
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
If they're not asking anything personal

4274
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
Or trying to create controversy for page hits

4275
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
Then treat them with the measure of respect

4276
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
That you want them to treat you

4277
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
Or more importantly your game

4278
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
Honestly I hope the press takes

4279
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
Marcus Spears advice

4280
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
I hope Blow and Fish

4281
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
Have trouble for the rest of their careers

4282
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
Finding press who want to endure

4283
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
Their nonsensical whining

4284
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
Because that's the only thing that hostile

4285
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
That hostile assholes deserve

4286
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
Unfortunately I know that Fish will come back

4287
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
To kickstarter for Fez 2

4288
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
And get his goal times a billion

4289
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
Because most gamers stop thinking for themselves

4290
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
When words like innovation and independent

4291
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
Are thrown about

4292
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
This is of course while many other developers

4293
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
In the air know struggle to gain any attention at all

4294
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
There truly is no justice in the world

4295
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
Anyway

4296
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
Quick question now, thank you

4297
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
I had a quick question unrelated to this nonsense

4298
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
Recently Giant Bomb had a quick look

4299
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
Of Dynasty Warriors 8

4300
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
In which the only bit of information that could be gleaned

4301
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
They looked at it was that the Xbox 360 version

4302
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
Was a poorly done port

4303
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
Why was there so little information

4304
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
For such a long video

4305
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
Because Jeff and Vinny were devoted to hammering

4306
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
The hit X joke into the ground

4307
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
And whining about how they hated the series as a whole

4308
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
Anyway I've never played

4309
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
A Musou game before and was mainly

4310
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
Scared off of them as it seems many of the media

4311
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
Outlets I frequent have the same attitude

4312
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
Of dismissing the games at first glance

4313
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
Then you need to re-destruct

4314
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
Doid and Jim Sterling

4315
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
See some people

4316
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
Sorry to interrupt but some people

4317
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
Are here for that and I think either you're

4318
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
Kind of like a fan of those types of games

4319
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
Some people get great pleasure

4320
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
Out of button mashing X and kill kill kill

4321
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
Die die die

4322
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
See that's the thing with reviewers

4323
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
You can't just take some anonymous reviewers

4324
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
Opinion for it, you gotta look at what they like

4325
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
And if they like similar games

4326
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
That you like then that's the reviewer

4327
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
You follow as far as whether

4328
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
You may like something that

4329
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
If they like that genre of game

4330
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
Then yes that would probably be

4331
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
One that you wanna, if they say it's truly bad

4332
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
Then you know

4333
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
I get really stressed out and irritated too

4334
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
When I hear these big media outlets

4335
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
Talking about things that they don't know a lick about

4336
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
Like you know I think a great example

4337
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
Going back to X-Play

4338
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
When they talked about how Beatmania on the Playstation 2

4339
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
Was a rip off of Guitar Hero

4340
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
I was like um

4341
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
Um no

4342
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
But then I have to remember

4343
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
I don't really give a shit what X-Play thinks

4344
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
You know and I don't really base my decisions

4345
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
Off that show

4346
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
So I have to find the reviewer that best matches me

4347
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
And you say a lot

4348
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
With your voice when you tune out

4349
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
Yeah but if you don't look at multiple sources

4350
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
You may miss something

4351
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
I'm not saying focus necessarily on just one

4352
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
But you do have to kinda

4353
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
You have to find those that kinda mesh well with your taste

4354
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
I think like Loki said

4355
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
I don't know much about these Jim Sterling reviews

4356
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
But it sounds like if he's more of a fan of these

4357
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
It's counter balanced to what you saw happen over on

4358
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
There's more in the email

4359
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
There's a lot more in the email

4360
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
However I read a blog defending the series

4361
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
And this was on Giant Bomb

4362
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
And was immediately struck by the passionate defense of the series

4363
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
And the blogger's reactions for loving it as he does

4364
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
Intrigued by the case he made

4365
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
I picked up Warriors Orochi 3 Hyper

4366
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
For Wii U

4367
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
As a sort of test for how I'd feel

4368
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
I ended up enjoying the game immensely

4369
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
And have since picked up Dynasty Warriors 8 for the PS3

4370
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
And the original Warriors Orochi for 360

4371
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
In addition to importing the PS3 version

4372
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
Of Dynasty Warriors 7 Empires

4373
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
I think about this now

4374
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
Against the current backdrop of people passionately tearing

4375
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
Apart reviewers for having a less than positive

4376
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
Opinion of Dragon's Crown to the point where

4377
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
Atlas had to defend controversial reviews

4378
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
By the way

4379
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
My problem with Dragon Crown is just

4380
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
The

4381
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
I love and hate the art style in that game

4382
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
And that's really what I hate

4383
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
Did you see the minigame where the girl's chained up

4384
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
And you can touch her and she squirms?

4385
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
Yeah, I hate that

4386
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
Anyway, going onward

4387
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
While I don't like the game either

4388
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
After having played it

4389
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
I can safely assume that were I on the fence

4390
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
Controversial ranting

4391
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
We're seeing now would not have driven me

4392
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
To try the way the game

4393
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
The way the impassioned

4394
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
Immature defense of Dynasty Warriors

4395
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
I mentioned earlier had moved me

4396
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
With that in mind, here's my inquiry

4397
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
I thought it was a short question

4398
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
Okay

4399
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
I'm sorry RossoUT

4400
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
I actually really like your emails because of how well

4401
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
Written they are and just how well you lay out

4402
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
Your ideas

4403
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
You know what, I do appreciate that

4404
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
He does come back when he's got something to say

4405
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
Yes

4406
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
With that in mind, here's my inquiry

4407
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
Uh oh, I need to make sure I don't get out of chat

4408
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
Okay

4409
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
First, why does defending

4410
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
Something often turn into attacks on disagreeing

4411
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
Reviewers despite it being counterproductive

4412
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
To the apparent goal of winning

4413
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
Over the indecisive

4414
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
Well to go on that first, I mean look at freaking politics

4415
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
Oh god yes

4416
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
I think that's more human, that's not something specific to gaming

4417
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
That's human nature

4418
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
Yeah that's human nature, my way or the highway

4419
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
And as I mentioned in part A, people actually do get a positive

4420
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
Chemical response from having other people agree with them

4421
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
And by presenting

4422
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
Their own information

4423
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
It is

4424
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
I think it's a dopamine response

4425
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
Where if you, people actually feel better

4426
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
Attacking something that's outside

4427
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,000
It feels good to be validated and affirmated

4428
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
Get out

4429
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
I understand

4430
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
But for some people they actually take that

4431
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
Aggression side of it and get kind of an adrenaline

4432
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
Rush off of it

4433
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,000
You know, you get into that

4434
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
Especially the more passionate you feel about something

4435
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000
You stop really caring about what other people think

4436
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
Your idea or nothing

4437
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
And you do get an emotional rush out of it

4438
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
So it really is just basic

4439
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,000
Biochemistry and psychology

4440
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,000
Anybody else?

4441
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,000
Want to expand?

4442
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
Nah go ahead because I know there's at least a couple more

4443
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
Second, have you ever been moved by an

4444
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,000
Unpopular games defenders to give said game

4445
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,000
A chance?

4446
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,000
Mass Effect

4447
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
Yeah Mass Effect is a good example

4448
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,000
And it wasn't unpopular but a lot of people

4449
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:01,000
I wasn't going to give it a chance

4450
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,000
Well at the time, remember we got into it right when

4451
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,000
Mass Effect 3 had first come out

4452
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,000
There was all that ending wank

4453
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
So I don't know about the unpopular part

4454
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
Well god even just this week

4455
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
I gave Team Fortress 2 a try

4456
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
I didn't think I'd like it but Act Deaf was like

4457
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
No you gotta try, you gotta try

4458
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,000
I think it's a massively unpopular game

4459
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:21,000
Yeah that's true, I guess Team Fortress isn't really unpopular either

4460
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
Well god, what about the music games

4461
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
We used to play for years

4462
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,000
I don't think those cracked into the mainstream

4463
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
Well and I actually liked Kraken DJ

4464
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:31,000
For a while, I thought that was fun

4465
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,000
And a lot of people were like yeah

4466
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,000
Um

4467
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
I know that there were others because um

4468
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,000
Like some of the weirder treasure

4469
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
Games that people were kind of poo pooing on

4470
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
I thought were great, you know like, I liked Chameleon

4471
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,000
Twist, I liked uh

4472
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,000
Mischief Makers, those were fun games

4473
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,000
You know, anything?

4474
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,000
Okay, anyway keep up the good work

4475
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:55,000
Guys, I look forward to your response

4476
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:57,000
Regards, we're all still UT

4477
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,000
Alrighty, two more to go

4478
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:01,000
Alright, dearest denizens of

4479
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:03,000
Podcastopia

4480
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:05,000
So I got a summons for jury duty

4481
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,000
For next week, I'm sorry

4482
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000
I didn't know on what day this week

4483
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:11,000
I will have to drag my happy ass out of bed

4484
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:13,000
To be at the courthouse at 8am to do my civic duty

4485
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,000
But I do know that day is

4486
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,000
Not Monday, this gives me at least one

4487
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:19,000
Day to download a game off PSN

4488
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:21,000
To play on my Vita

4489
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:23,000
What should I get? Preferably

4490
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:25,000
I'd like something that won't make a lot of noise

4491
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,000
But will require me to make a lot of

4492
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:29,000
Movements that look vaguely threatening to old people

4493
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:31,000
Stay black, redertainment

4494
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,000
Trainer

4495
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:35,000
Uh

4496
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:37,000
Gaming during jury duty is

4497
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,000
There is going to be long periods of waiting

4498
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:41,000
You know what?

4499
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
You know the Sacramento courthouse that make you turn off all your devices

4500
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:45,000
What? When you're in

4501
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,000
Oh, when you're in the room, when you're in the

4502
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:49,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I mean like while you're waiting

4503
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:51,000
In the jury hall, while you're waiting in the hallway

4504
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,000
I have always spent more time

4505
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
In the stupid jury selection

4506
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,000
Than I have ever in the lines

4507
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:59,000
So any suggestions

4508
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:01,000
For Vita games that make you look

4509
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
Vaguely spasmodic?

4510
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,000
Not that don't involve Kinect

4511
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,000
Katamari!

4512
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,000
Um, Little Big Planet?

4513
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
Maybe

4514
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
Or I

4515
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:17,000
I can't recommend this because

4516
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,000
The game is bad, but a fighting game

4517
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:21,000
Involves in there's

4518
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:23,000
Cap Comics Tekken

4519
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:25,000
So that'll be

4520
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,000
Mashing the buttons and looking mean

4521
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000
Yeah

4522
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:31,000
I definitely see looks of frustration

4523
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
In playing that, so that makes sense

4524
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:35,000
So we do have one last email

4525
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
Hey OLR crew

4526
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
AZHP here

4527
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
I never asked, is it AZHP or AZHP?

4528
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:43,000
I think it's AZHP

4529
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
I thought the HP was Harry Potter

4530
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,000
Okay

4531
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,000
Last week I went to a convention

4532
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,000
Co-founded by a good friend of mine called

4533
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,000
GamerX

4534
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:55,000
My girlfriend cosplayed as Zelda

4535
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
Which as anime fans is the most mainstream

4536
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,000
Game cosplay she had

4537
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,000
I wanted to write in to say

4538
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000
She had a super positive experience

4539
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:05,000
Even as a completely straight couple

4540
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:07,000
Everyone who wanted a picture with her was super enthusiastic

4541
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,000
And didn't give off the typical creeper vibe

4542
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,000
That comes with most convention goers

4543
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:13,000
When they said

4544
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:15,000
I love your costume, it's amazing

4545
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,000
She didn't feel like they were trying to hit on her

4546
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:19,000
And genuinely enjoyed her costume

4547
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
Even though we didn't go to many of the panels

4548
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:23,000
And the dealer's hall was clearly geared toward

4549
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,000
The LGBT crowd

4550
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:27,000
The vibe we got from the convention was super positive

4551
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:29,000
The game room was lots of fun

4552
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
The Japanese version of Project Diva F

4553
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:33,000
The Saturn version of Puzzle Bobble

4554
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,000
And Typing of the Dead on Dreamcast

4555
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,000
I was actually surprised

4556
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:39,000
There weren't that many furries at the convention

4557
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
Given that I know a lot of gamers are also

4558
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:43,000
Furries

4559
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:45,000
There were a couple, because they were even advertising a furry con

4560
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000
That's coming up, had one of the booths

4561
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,000
So, you know, hey, whatever you like

4562
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:51,000
As long as it's, you know, consensual

4563
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:53,000
I unfortunately wasn't able to stay

4564
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000
Late enough to catch the podcast panel

4565
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,000
I definitely regret

4566
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,000
Missing my chance to say hi to Rob

4567
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:01,000
Squinty face

4568
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:03,000
Anyway, I definitely recommend people check it out

4569
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:05,000
It's definitely a fun experience

4570
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,000
Well, definitely, lots of definitelys there

4571
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:09,000
Check it out again next year if it's in San Francisco again

4572
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:11,000
Yours truly is HP

4573
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:13,000
P.S. If you guys are interested

4574
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:15,000
Here's a picture of the Zelda costume my girlfriend wore

4575
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:17,000
I actually looked at the picture

4576
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,000
And I saw her

4577
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,000
Which must have been I saw you at some point

4578
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,000
And I was like

4579
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:25,000
Wow, that is fucking good

4580
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:27,000
Feel free to link in the chat

4581
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:29,000
I helped make the harp

4582
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,000
So it was cool hearing people compliment it at the convention

4583
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:33,000
So I'm pulling it up

4584
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:35,000
Very nice

4585
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:37,000
Yeah, it was very good

4586
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:39,000
Yeah, if you can put that in chat

4587
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:41,000
I'm sure the chatters would like to see that

4588
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,000
Very well done

4589
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,000
I saw her in the gaming room

4590
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:47,000
Playing one of the dancing games

4591
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:49,000
Alright, well I'm gonna copy this

4592
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:51,000
If I didn't actually close the window

4593
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,000
Alright, that's it for

4594
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,000
Emails tonight, right?

4595
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

4596
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
We're almost to 9 o'clock

4597
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:01,000
So let's try to jam through the rest of this pretty quick

4598
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,000
Because I do want to get in some calls

4599
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:05,000
So we're gonna go to the FUs

4600
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,000
Of the week

4601
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:23,000
Dark Sakura

4602
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
I was debating whether or not

4603
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:27,000
I wanted to say their name on air

4604
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:29,000
But I'm going to

4605
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:31,000
FU to Bonnie Plumbing Heating and Air

4606
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:35,000
For giving indications

4607
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:39,000
Of being the type of hypocritical conservative Christians

4608
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:41,000
That I personally do not like

4609
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:43,000
Allegedly

4610
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:45,000
Loki

4611
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
Oh, and my battery

4612
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
FU to my car

4613
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
I'm not really sure what it's doing

4614
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,000
But whenever I turn all the way to the right

4615
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,000
My radio shuts off

4616
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
That's weird

4617
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,000
That's a little creepy

4618
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,000
FU to this fucking con plague

4619
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:03,000
I've been carrying since Tuesday

4620
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,000
And FU to Extifer

4621
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,000
Who allegedly gave it to me

4622
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
Alan

4623
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
FU to the associated dental issues

4624
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:13,000
That someone can get when they're in their 30s

4625
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
And also FU to the fact that I think

4626
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
Sanrio chewed through

4627
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,000
The microphone portion cable

4628
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,000
Of my headset

4629
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
Though it doesn't look chewed

4630
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
It looks like someone just snipped it with scissors

4631
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,000
Because you know how a headset has the green

4632
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,000
And the red for the mic

4633
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
It forks off like a snake stone at the very end

4634
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,000
I wonder why she would have chewed that

4635
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,000
It's weird

4636
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
She's gonna have to buy a new headset

4637
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
It's like 40 bucks that I don't have

4638
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,000
Alright, there it is, you have to use the week

4639
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:44,000
Loki

4640
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,000
Alright, so more Xbox One news

4641
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:48,000
This is once again

4642
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,000
Something else that they've kind of changed their mind on

4643
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:52,000
And that was the whole inclusion

4644
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
Of a chat headset

4645
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
With the Xbox One

4646
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,000
Yes, the Xbox One

4647
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
Day one edition will come with a chat headset

4648
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:04,000
So it'll be very much like it was with the Xbox 360

4649
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
Originally, they were planning not to include one of those

4650
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,000
And you'd have to buy it separately

4651
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
So, good to know

4652
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,000
You're getting some more value for your $500

4653
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:18,000
Hooray! I guess a lot of people are very excited about that

4654
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:20,000
More value is good

4655
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:23,000
And also hooray, I want to end on a positive note tonight

4656
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,000
Because unfortunately a lot of times

4657
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
We have to talk about, you know, gaming studios

4658
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,000
That are closing

4659
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
And people that are out of a job

4660
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
But tonight we get to say hooray

4661
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:37,000
In Vancouver, Namco Bandai is opening a new office

4662
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:40,000
And it's gonna be dedicated to mobile and online titles

4663
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:43,000
But about 30 people working there in Vancouver

4664
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:45,000
Making these titles

4665
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:47,000
No word of course on what those games are

4666
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,000
But, yay

4667
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:51,000
And since this is a Namco story

4668
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:52,000
Can I say something real quick?

4669
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:53,000
Please do

4670
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:55,000
They're talking about this in chat

4671
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:59,000
Pac-Man Champion Edition DX is coming to Steam

4672
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:01,000
It's a DX Plus version

4673
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:03,000
Out of respect for Dark Sakura

4674
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:05,000
I will say I purchased early

4675
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:07,000
I purchased in advance

4676
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:09,000
I did not pre-purchase because that's not a thing

4677
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,000
I purchased early the game

4678
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:13,000
Oh, stop feeding her

4679
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:15,000
Alan is perfectly right

4680
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:17,000
If you purchase early

4681
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
Because it's not gonna be playable until September 24th

4682
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,000
And they took my $9.99

4683
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:23,000
So if you purchase early you'll get

4684
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:25,000
What I think is going to be a DLC pack

4685
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:27,000
It's extra songs, extra maps

4686
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:29,000
And you can play as the little Dig Dug avatar

4687
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:31,000
I thought some of that was supposed to be part of it anyway

4688
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,000
And a little race car avatar

4689
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:36,000
Well it says Act Def in chat pasted the Steam link

4690
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,000
And it'll say purchase now and you'll get all this crap

4691
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:43,000
So, new Pac-Man or Pac-Man DX is such an amazing game

4692
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:45,000
Yeah, it is a great Pac-Man game

4693
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:46,000
It's coming to Steam

4694
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,000
Alright, we're gonna open up the phones now

4695
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
It's that time, 1877 Game OLR

4696
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
Or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio

4697
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,000
If you want to give us a call

4698
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,000
And talk with us about anything we've talked about tonight

4699
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:58,000
Or maybe you have something that we didn't cover

4700
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,000
That you want to talk about

4701
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,000
But, there it is

4702
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
The phones are open

4703
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:06,000
1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype

4704
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,000
Orange Lounge Radio

4705
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
I saw at least one tweet come through that I want to get to

4706
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,000
Here quickly

4707
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,000
Otherwise, do we have any last minute stories?

4708
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,000
Loki, Dark Sakura?

4709
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,000
Yeah, I can talk real quick about

4710
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:20,000
They announced, well, I knew about them

4711
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:22,000
They announced the characters for the second wave

4712
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:24,000
Of Disney Infinity stuff

4713
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,000
That's going to be starting in October

4714
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:28,000
And those include such things as like the Wreck-It Ralph

4715
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,000
Characters, so you get Wreck-It Ralph

4716
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
They've got

4717
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,000
What else here?

4718
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:36,000
Of course, the Toy Story pack is going to be coming around

4719
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,000
At the same time as the Buzz Lightyear

4720
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:40,000
Jesse are going to be in the actual pack

4721
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,000
And then Woody is going to be sold separately

4722
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:44,000
They're going to have the Phineas and Furb

4723
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,000
Or Phineas and Agent P

4724
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:48,000
And then of course, like I said

4725
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:50,000
Ralph, Vanellope

4726
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:52,000
And then kind of some one-offs

4727
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:54,000
They have Rapunzel from Tangled

4728
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
Jack Skellington

4729
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:58,000
And, um

4730
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:00,000
Let me, I'm on Fantasia

4731
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:02,000
We actually have a call on the line

4732
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:04,000
You can probably hear the coffee in the background

4733
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,000
We have a call on the line

4734
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:08,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

4735
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,000
Hello, it's Codeman

4736
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:12,000
Hey Codeman, how you doing?

4737
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:14,000
Sorry for the Facebook sounds, Rob

4738
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,000
You better be

4739
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:18,000
Do what?

4740
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:20,000
Is that you coughing? Or is that the little one?

4741
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:22,000
Oh no, she's asleep

4742
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:24,000
Oh, okay, well what's up?

4743
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:28,000
Oh no, I was just wanting to know if everyone's excited about August 13th

4744
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:30,000
I am totally jazzed about Tuesday

4745
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:32,000
And why?

4746
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:34,000
Is this Disney Infinite?

4747
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:36,000
Or what is it that you're excited about?

4748
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:38,000
DuckTales, isn't it?

4749
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,000
Oh, DuckTales

4750
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,000
I am excited about that, yes

4751
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:44,000
So excited I forgot the day

4752
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,000
Well, and like, what I was

4753
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,000
Just so fan, I mean, I was just

4754
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,000
Amazed about, like, they brought back

4755
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:52,000
Every single voice actor

4756
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:54,000
Yes

4757
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:56,000
That has ever played in the DuckTales series

4758
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:58,000
And, and, I'm not

4759
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:00,000
Quite sure how old

4760
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,000
The voice actor is for Scrooge McDuck

4761
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:04,000
He's in the, he's in his 90s, I know that

4762
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:06,000
Yeah, the lady with the magic of the spell

4763
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,000
Is old as hell too

4764
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:10,000
Yeah, and like, I was just

4765
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,000
Amazed at how the voice actually

4766
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,000
Sounded in, like, the trailers and stuff

4767
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,000
And I was like, it's

4768
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,000
It's perfect, like, it's the same

4769
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:20,000
Exact voice that was in

4770
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,000
The, you know, the game back in the day

4771
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
So I, you know, I'm really excited about that

4772
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,000
I just wanted to call in and talk about that

4773
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:28,000
Because I am just stoked

4774
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:30,000
About this game, I haven't been so

4775
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:32,000
Excited, well, except

4776
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:34,000
For when Earthbound was released, but

4777
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:36,000
But, I mean, I'm excited

4778
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:38,000
So excited about the game

4779
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:40,000
What platform? How do you guys feel about the game?

4780
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:43,000
Yes, I will definitely be picking it up

4781
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,000
But even I can't decide what platform

4782
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,000
Do I get it on, because I could do

4783
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:49,000
PC, I could do Wii U

4784
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:51,000
Because, you know, it's kind of the newest thing out there

4785
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:53,000
I could get PlayStation 3

4786
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,000
Because, you know, trophies or whatever

4787
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:57,000
Xbox 360s, where a lot of my friends will probably be

4788
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:59,000
I don't know, I don't know what system to get it on

4789
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:01,000
Have you decided?

4790
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:03,000
Unfortunately, I don't think they're releasing it

4791
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,000
For the Mac, so I can't get it on Steam

4792
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,000
But I can, I think

4793
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:09,000
I'm gonna be picking it up on the Wii U

4794
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:11,000
Why is that?

4795
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:13,000
Well, because, I don't know, it's just nostalgic

4796
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,000
Of, like, it being on Nintendo

4797
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:17,000
Like, when I used to play it when I was a kid

4798
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:19,000
And so, like, I feel like I should play it on a

4799
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:21,000
Nintendo console, it sounds stupid

4800
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:23,000
No, not at all

4801
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:25,000
I just feel like I should play it on a Nintendo console

4802
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:27,000
Okay, fair enough, I think I might end up

4803
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:29,000
Getting it on Wii U, because at least it does have the

4804
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,000
Off-screen play, which, you know, as little

4805
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:33,000
As it is, it is something the other

4806
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:35,000
Platforms don't get, so, and I think

4807
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
Xbox 360 is delayed anyway, so, I mean

4808
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,000
Yeah, I think it's September

4809
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,000
I could be wrong, but I think it's September

4810
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
13th or 14th, but I could be wrong

4811
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:52,000
I am, that's what I enjoy about the whole

4812
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:54,000
Earthbound things, you know, because my wife

4813
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:56,000
You know, she might want to watch Hulu

4814
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:58,000
Or Netflix or something, and I could just sit here

4815
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:00,000
On my Wii U tablet and play Earthbound

4816
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:02,000
All night, so that was really cool

4817
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:05,000
Oh, Nintendo wants you to sell some Wii U's

4818
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,000
That's exactly what they want to hear

4819
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:09,000
No, I love that about that console

4820
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:11,000
You know, I picked up Metroid

4821
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:13,000
You know, and all that stuff

4822
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:15,000
And so I can just sit there on my tablet

4823
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:17,000
And play that, so that's really cool

4824
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:19,000
Excellent

4825
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:21,000
Well, anything else you're looking forward to

4826
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:23,000
Over these coming weeks?

4827
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:25,000
Well, I mean, not really

4828
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
I'm going to be playing the hell out of DuckTales

4829
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,000
So that's probably the only thing

4830
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:31,000
I'm going to be playing for a while

4831
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:33,000
I've been playing Don't Starve

4832
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:35,000
It has stolen my life

4833
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:37,000
It literally has, I mean, that game

4834
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:39,000
I don't know if you've played it yet

4835
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,000
I haven't

4836
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:43,000
Not yet, but tell the listeners more about it

4837
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:45,000
For those that don't know, because you have been trying to

4838
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:47,000
Get me in on this game

4839
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:49,000
Well, Don't Starve is basically a roguelike game

4840
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:51,000
I mean, you start out at day one

4841
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:53,000
It is the title

4842
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:55,000
I mean, you're basically trying to survive

4843
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:57,000
And you just continue

4844
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:59,000
On and on and on

4845
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,000
And you go through all the seasons

4846
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:03,000
You start out in the spring

4847
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:05,000
Well, actually, I think you start in the summer

4848
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:07,000
And then you go into the spring, and then you go into the winter

4849
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:09,000
And then everything has everything to do with

4850
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:11,000
Like, you have to build

4851
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:13,000
Coats

4852
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:15,000
To stay warm

4853
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:17,000
You have to, you know, fires at night

4854
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:19,000
So you don't die from creatures in the night

4855
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:21,000
And all that stuff

4856
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:23,000
You have sanity that you have to keep up

4857
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:25,000
You have to constantly keep your belly full of food

4858
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:27,000
And then you have to constantly keep your health up

4859
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:29,000
So, I mean, it's such

4860
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:31,000
A frustrating game, because you get

4861
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:33,000
I think the other day I got to like

4862
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:35,000
Day 34 or something in the winter

4863
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:37,000
And I just ran out of food

4864
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:39,000
Because nothing grows in the winter

4865
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:41,000
And so then I died at day 34

4866
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:43,000
And it just starts you

4867
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:45,000
Back at day one with nothing

4868
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,000
I mean, I haven't played a roguelike game in forever

4869
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:49,000
So, I mean, it's just

4870
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:51,000
It's very frustrating, but it's a very fun game

4871
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:53,000
And I would suggest anybody

4872
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:55,000
On Steam to buy it

4873
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:57,000
And play the hell out of it

4874
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:59,000
I think it's $14.99

4875
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:01,000
And that's everything

4876
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:03,000
And they update it constantly

4877
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:05,000
With new places to go

4878
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:07,000
In wormholes

4879
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,000
And then there's like a

4880
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:11,000
There's different worlds all throughout the game

4881
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:13,000
So you can just continue going to different worlds

4882
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:15,000
I mean, it's an amazing game

4883
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:17,000
Well, I'm going to have to check that out at some point

4884
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:19,000
It does sound pretty hot

4885
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:21,000
And I live for roguelikes

4886
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,000
I'm enjoying Rogue Legacy as well, by the way

4887
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:25,000
Alright, well, Codeman, I'm going to let you go

4888
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,000
Thanks for calling in. Do you have anything you need to plug?

4889
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:29,000
Want to plug before we get out?

4890
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:31,000
No, not really

4891
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:33,000
I mean, we still have our podcast

4892
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:35,000
We still do it from time to time

4893
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:37,000
We've mostly moved to YouTube

4894
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:39,000
We do Google Hangouts

4895
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:41,000
But it's the YouTube.com

4896
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:43,000
Backslash The Down For Maintenance podcast

4897
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:45,000
Well, I think it's like the DFM podcast

4898
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:47,000
But you can look us up on YouTube

4899
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:49,000
And then I have a YouTube channel

4900
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:51,000
But, I mean, it's really hard to remember

4901
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:53,000
I mean, it's YouTube.com

4902
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:55,000
Backslash C. Taylor 1785

4903
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:57,000
Because YouTube won't let me change it

4904
02:48:57,000 --> 02:49:03,000
But, yeah, you should do more Let's Plays, Rob

4905
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:06,000
You know, I was gifted by a kind listener

4906
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:08,000
Another scary game called Paranormal

4907
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:11,000
And that is up on the list of things I need to play, too

4908
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:13,000
Holy crap, that game is fantastic

4909
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:15,000
I hate it and love it all at the same time

4910
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,000
I'm not sure if I'm looking forward to it

4911
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:19,000
Alright, Codeman, I'm going to let you go, buddy

4912
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:21,000
Alright, well, I'll talk to you guys later

4913
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:22,000
Alright, take care

4914
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:23,000
Alright, bye

4915
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:25,000
Alright, and our phones are lighting up

4916
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,000
We've got another call coming in right now

4917
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:28,000
So let's go to the phones

4918
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:29,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio

4919
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:30,000
Who's this?

4920
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:31,000
This is Shane

4921
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:32,000
Hey, Shane, how you doing?

4922
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:35,000
I'm hot, it's like really hot here right now

4923
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:36,000
Isn't it like

4924
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:38,000
You should come to California

4925
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:39,000
Isn't it hotter there?

4926
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:40,000
Yeah, probably

4927
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:42,000
But not at night, so come here

4928
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:44,000
Yeah, maybe

4929
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,000
We're not Phoenix or anything, and it's a dry heat

4930
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:47,000
Phoenix is terrible

4931
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:48,000
It is terrible

4932
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:49,000
What's up?

4933
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:51,000
Pokemon

4934
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:55,000
Oh, did you hear my little dedication to you earlier?

4935
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:58,000
Yeah, I take some issues with that dedication

4936
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:00,000
Why?

4937
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:02,000
Well, first of all, you ended it too quick

4938
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:05,000
Like, there's never enough time to talk about Pokemon

4939
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:09,000
Like, okay, for example, my job today

4940
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:12,000
I had a demo and I was demoing the new Mario and Luigi game

4941
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:14,000
And all the people that showed up

4942
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:16,000
Pretty much just wanted to talk Pokemon with me

4943
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:18,000
Which I was fine with, that was fun

4944
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:20,000
Way more fun than demoing a game

4945
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:32,000
But, yeah, like, I don't like the thought that it should have stopped after 151 Pokemon

4946
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:34,000
Sorry, Jamie

4947
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:38,000
Just because, like, that would have been boring

4948
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:40,000
You have to keep the series going

4949
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:44,000
And if you only had those same 151 were, like, 15 years now

4950
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:46,000
Or something like that since they first came out

4951
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:48,000
That would have been terrible

4952
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:52,000
So, yeah, we're at 649 plus whatever new ones are in here

4953
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:54,000
But it's still really fun

4954
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:58,000
And these mega evolutions, like the new trailer that was posted is awesome

4955
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:00,000
And it reminds me of Power Rangers

4956
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:01,000
So I am on board

4957
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:02,000
Wait a minute

4958
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:03,000
100% on board

4959
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:05,000
Wait a minute, because the other night you said, I don't know

4960
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:09,000
I know, but then they put a trailer that made it look like Power Rangers to me

4961
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:11,000
And that is all you need to do

4962
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:16,000
If there is more blue in the trailer and maybe some Taco Bell

4963
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:18,000
Which I'm still kind of boycotting

4964
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:20,000
Wait, you're boycotting Taco Bell?

4965
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:22,000
Yes, they got rid of some stuff I liked

4966
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:25,000
Uh-oh, that's right, they got rid of the volcano stuff, I forgot

4967
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:27,000
Yeah, and I really liked that

4968
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:28,000
We had this conversation the other night

4969
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:30,000
Fifth Dream in our chat room with a question for Shane

4970
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:33,000
Hey, they don't ask us questions anymore, they ask the caller's questions

4971
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:36,000
Fifth Dream wants to know, Shane, did you watch any of the Pokemon Championships?

4972
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:38,000
Yes, and I didn't want to

4973
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:41,000
I was just really bored, I was like, okay, this will be fun

4974
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:43,000
And that's my sarcastic voice

4975
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:45,000
So I put it on, it was so fun

4976
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:47,000
Like, it was really fun to watch

4977
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:51,000
And I watched some of the finals today before work

4978
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:54,000
And I was getting excited and there was no reason to

4979
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:57,000
And I feel like it was when I liked basketball

4980
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:59,000
When the NCAA tournament was going on

4981
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:02,000
Like, I just got sucked in and it was amazing

4982
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:06,000
Was it the Pokemon card game?

4983
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:09,000
They had the card game later today, which I was at work for

4984
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:12,000
So I couldn't watch that, it was the actual video games

4985
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:15,000
Wow, and Nintendo let them stream it?

4986
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:18,000
Well, because it's Nintendo sponsored

4987
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:21,000
Me and my friend Danny, we want to go to next year's championships

4988
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:23,000
It's in DC, this year was in Vancouver

4989
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:26,000
But they get all sorts of cool stuff

4990
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:28,000
They have all this merchandise

4991
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:31,000
And things that you won't find anywhere else

4992
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:33,000
Just at the World Championships

4993
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:39,000
And like today, or yesterday, they announced a new mega evolution

4994
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:42,000
And that they haven't put out anywhere else

4995
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:45,000
And they announced that they're going to have a soundtrack out on iTunes

4996
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:48,000
This November for X and Y, it's going to have 220 tracks

4997
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:49,000
Good lord

4998
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:51,000
Like, yeah, that's ridiculous

4999
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:52,000
Oh my gosh

5000
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:53,000
And I will have it day one

5001
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:57,000
So, what's the countdown to X and Y at this point?

5002
02:52:57,000 --> 02:52:58,000
How many days left?

5003
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:01,000
It's like, almost exactly two months

5004
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:02,000
Tomorrow will be two months

5005
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:04,000
But for me, I don't know, because I'll get it early

5006
02:53:04,000 --> 02:53:07,000
So, sucks to be everybody else

5007
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:10,000
At least you have Final Fantasy XIV to hold you over, right?

5008
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:11,000
Yes, yes

5009
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:13,000
And I learned today, 100%

5010
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:16,000
Because they put some sort of graph out

5011
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:18,000
That if I get the PS3 collector's edition

5012
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:20,000
Which I'm getting through Amazon, because I had gift cards

5013
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:22,000
So it's fully paid off

5014
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:25,000
And I apply it to my current PC account

5015
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:27,000
I will be able to play on both

5016
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:29,000
For the free 30 days

5017
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:31,000
And because I'm an old player

5018
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:34,000
My 30 days won't kick in until September 10th

5019
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:37,000
So I'll have from the 24th of August till September 10th

5020
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:39,000
Not paying anything

5021
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:43,000
And then September 11th for the next 30 days for free as well

5022
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:44,000
Hmm

5023
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:45,000
There you go

5024
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:47,000
And you get all that collector's edition crap that you don't need

5025
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:50,000
Um, don't need?

5026
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:52,000
That's rude

5027
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:54,000
Well, what's in there that you need?

5028
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:56,000
The book, the art book is going to be fantastic

5029
02:53:56,000 --> 02:53:58,000
The baby soundtrack

5030
02:53:58,000 --> 02:54:00,000
Because the other soundtrack is just way too expensive

5031
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:02,000
And I don't have anything that can play it except for a PS3

5032
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:04,000
Even though I want the little pet

5033
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:06,000
And um

5034
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:08,000
The box

5035
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:10,000
Okay, it's the box

5036
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:12,000
That's acceptable to say, right?

5037
02:54:12,000 --> 02:54:14,000
Like, because the box looks cool

5038
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:16,000
Alright, fair enough

5039
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:18,000
Yes, exactly

5040
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:20,000
Alright, Shane, anything else before we let you go?

5041
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:22,000
Um, everybody should watch that new trailer

5042
02:54:22,000 --> 02:54:25,000
It has like rock music that plays during it

5043
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:27,000
And it's like remixed, I think, of a gym theme

5044
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:31,000
And seriously, if it doesn't remind you of Power Rangers

5045
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:33,000
Which is what I'm seeing from everybody's comments

5046
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:35,000
Everywhere on the internet that I'm looking right now

5047
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:37,000
You're crazy

5048
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:39,000
Because the end with the five of them lined up

5049
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:41,000
And their mega evolutions is totally Power Rangers

5050
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:43,000
It's awesome

5051
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:45,000
Alright, anything you want to plug while you're here on the show?

5052
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:47,000
Um

5053
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:49,000
Well, I just plugged Pokemon X and Y

5054
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:51,000
And we talked about Final Fantasy XIV

5055
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:53,000
Um

5056
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:55,000
Yes, sure

5057
02:54:55,000 --> 02:54:57,000
Apparently, there's a really cool Konami game in Japan

5058
02:54:57,000 --> 02:54:59,000
Called Sound Vortex

5059
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:01,000
And I've watched videos and it's awesome

5060
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:03,000
Somebody, I guess, cracked it

5061
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:05,000
So you can play on your PC

5062
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:07,000
And there are websites now building controllers

5063
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:09,000
For the Sound Vortex game that you can buy

5064
02:55:09,000 --> 02:55:11,000
That you'd be able to hook up to your PC and play it

5065
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:13,000
And that game is so cool looking

5066
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:15,000
You need to link me this

5067
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:17,000
I need to get a link to Sound Vortex

5068
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:19,000
Or for the controller

5069
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:21,000
The controller is like $300 and some dollars

5070
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:23,000
I can link you the gameplay

5071
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:25,000
It's amazing

5072
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:27,000
Alright, get on the case, Nancy Drew

5073
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:29,000
Uh, my name is Shane

5074
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:31,000
Alright, bye, Shane

5075
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:33,000
Bye

5076
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:35,000
1877 Game OLR

5077
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:37,000
Our username on Skype is

5078
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:39,000
OrangeLoungeRadio

5079
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:41,000
Going to some tweets real quick

5080
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:43,000
I'm going to do these pretty quick here because we're running kind of late tonight

5081
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:45,000
Dark Tetsuya sends the show a tweet that says

5082
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:47,000
Hey, just a note, the latest version of

5083
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:49,000
Super Mario Crossover, or 3.0

5084
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:51,000
Is now out and it's available at

5085
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:53,000
ExplodingRabbit.com

5086
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:55,000
Did they do a Kickstarter for that one?

5087
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:57,000
No, they did a Kickstarter for their game that's not quite

5088
02:55:57,000 --> 02:55:59,000
That game, but it's

5089
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:01,000
All the characters changed is slightly

5090
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:03,000
Renamed and their own original levels

5091
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:05,000
Got it, got it

5092
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:07,000
Act F says

5093
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:09,000
The King of Fighters XIII Steam Edition

5094
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:11,000
Trailer was leaked in the Steam store

5095
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:13,000
And removed

5096
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:15,000
So King of Fighters XIII probably coming

5097
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:17,000
To Steam at some point

5098
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:19,000
TigerClaw sent us a tweet

5099
02:56:19,000 --> 02:56:21,000
Imagi Studios originally was going to make

5100
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:23,000
A Legend of Zelda movie, check out the short movie

5101
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:25,000
Pitch video and he linked us to YouTube

5102
02:56:25,000 --> 02:56:27,000
I actually did see this earlier in the week

5103
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:29,000
And it did look pretty cool

5104
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:31,000
Although there was no, I don't believe there was any voices

5105
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:33,000
In it, but it did, it looked interesting

5106
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:35,000
But you know, Nintendo

5107
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:37,000
Is crazy possessive over their IPs

5108
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:39,000
Ever since that Super Mario Brothers movie was a

5109
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:41,000
Stink bomb, so I'm not

5110
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:43,000
Surprised they didn't get to go forward with it

5111
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:45,000
But it sure made a great little YouTube to look at

5112
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:47,000
Did you guys see that at all?

5113
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:49,000
The little concept, the Zelda pitch

5114
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:51,000
No, it was neat

5115
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:53,000
Alright, I'll give it one more minute

5116
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:55,000
To see if anybody's going to call in, but if not

5117
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:57,000
We'll close up shop, 1-877-GAME-OLR

5118
02:56:57,000 --> 02:56:59,000
Or our username on Skype is

5119
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:01,000
OrangeLoungeRadio, anybody else

5120
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:03,000
Have a last minute story for us tonight?

5121
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:05,000
Well, actually

5122
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:07,000
Not necessarily a story, but I'm going to

5123
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:09,000
Start making my 3DS

5124
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:11,000
Cases, and put them

5125
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:13,000
Available to sell before too long

5126
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:15,000
Is that an Etsy thing?

5127
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:17,000
I might do it on Etsy, either that or Storenvy

5128
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:19,000
I'm still deciding

5129
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:21,000
And why would somebody want a 3DS case from Dark Sakura?

5130
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:23,000
Because they are well made and protect your system

5131
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:25,000
A lot better than this flip up in cases do

5132
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:27,000
Fair enough, alright

5133
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:29,000
We do have one more call coming in, this will probably be the last one

5134
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:31,000
For tonight, so let's go to it

5135
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:33,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

5136
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:35,000
Hello

5137
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:37,000
Hello

5138
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:39,000
It's OrangeLoungeRadio

5139
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:41,000
Hello

5140
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:43,000
This is HeyacDeft

5141
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:45,000
HeyacDeft, and we see you, it's a video call

5142
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:47,000
Hi

5143
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:49,000
Hello

5144
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:51,000
Is that a My Little Pony?

5145
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:53,000
No, it's a Pokemon

5146
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:55,000
Oh, it's a Pokemon

5147
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:57,000
Uh oh, Shane's going to kill me for that one too

5148
02:57:57,000 --> 02:57:59,000
You know, I need to get my plus and minus ones back from Julian

5149
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:01,000
Send them to Shane

5150
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:03,000
Which Pokemon is that?

5151
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:05,000
It's the Pokemon Black and White

5152
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:07,000
Legendary Rusharound

5153
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:09,000
Oh, okay, alright

5154
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:13,000
So you just call in tonight to show off your plushie?

5155
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:15,000
Not really, I want to talk about

5156
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:17,000
Pac-Man Z DX Plus

5157
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:19,000
Ah, the game that

5158
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:21,000
Alan was talking about earlier, right?

5159
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:23,000
Yeah, I'm pretty excited about it

5160
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:25,000
Because I'm a fan of

5161
02:58:25,000 --> 02:58:27,000
Pac-Man Z

5162
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:29,000
I played the hell out of it

5163
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:31,000
I even got in the

5164
02:58:31,000 --> 02:58:33,000
In the beginning

5165
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:35,000
When it was released

5166
02:58:35,000 --> 02:58:37,000
I was in the top 40 scores

5167
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:39,000
That game

5168
02:58:39,000 --> 02:58:41,000
Yeah, like I said, I played it a lot

5169
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:43,000
Like, a freaking lot

5170
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:45,000
So I'm pretty excited

5171
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:47,000
To have

5172
02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:49,000
Or at least being able to play

5173
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:51,000
DX because what I have

5174
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:53,000
Seen about it, it seems pretty

5175
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:55,000
Damn cool

5176
02:58:55,000 --> 02:58:57,000
And mostly

5177
02:58:57,000 --> 02:58:59,000
The reason

5178
02:58:59,000 --> 02:59:01,000
I haven't even

5179
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:03,000
Been able to play it

5180
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:05,000
It's because

5181
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:07,000
It's not available in Mexico

5182
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:09,000
For some reason

5183
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:11,000
I don't know why

5184
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:13,000
So I'm pretty stoked that it's coming to Steam

5185
02:59:13,000 --> 02:59:15,000
Even since the

5186
02:59:15,000 --> 02:59:17,000
Announcement

5187
02:59:17,000 --> 02:59:19,000
It was a few months ago

5188
02:59:19,000 --> 02:59:21,000
I don't remember when exactly

5189
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:23,000
But I'm pretty excited

5190
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:25,000
To see it now

5191
02:59:25,000 --> 02:59:27,000
Being able to

5192
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:29,000
Purchase ahead

5193
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:31,000
Not to say pre-purchase or pre-order

5194
02:59:31,000 --> 02:59:33,000
Hahahaha

5195
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:35,000
You got everybody trained, DarkSagra

5196
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:37,000
What?

5197
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:39,000
He took great care to make

5198
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:41,000
Sure he said purchase ahead

5199
02:59:41,000 --> 02:59:43,000
Yes, which is how it should be

5200
02:59:43,000 --> 02:59:45,000
Because it's wrong to put

5201
02:59:45,000 --> 02:59:47,000
Unnecessary prefix

5202
02:59:47,000 --> 02:59:49,000
Didn't you listen to George Carlin?

5203
02:59:49,000 --> 02:59:51,000
Geez, Rob

5204
02:59:51,000 --> 02:59:53,000
How dare I speak up

5205
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:55,000
The only sad part is that

5206
02:59:55,000 --> 02:59:57,000
We have to wait at least

5207
02:59:57,000 --> 02:59:59,000
One month and a half

5208
02:59:59,000 --> 03:00:01,000
To be able to play it since it releases

5209
03:00:01,000 --> 03:00:03,000
On the 25th

5210
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:05,000
So yeah, but

5211
03:00:05,000 --> 03:00:07,000
The extra content will be

5212
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:09,000
Pretty good too

5213
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:11,000
The Rally Access skin

5214
03:00:11,000 --> 03:00:13,000
The Dick Duck skin

5215
03:00:13,000 --> 03:00:15,000
There's even old school

5216
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:17,000
Pac-Man skin

5217
03:00:17,000 --> 03:00:19,000
So that's gonna be pretty cool

5218
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:21,000
I just love that this game is how old

5219
03:00:21,000 --> 03:00:23,000
And they're still supporting it

5220
03:00:23,000 --> 03:00:25,000
Like this was really a pleasant surprise

5221
03:00:25,000 --> 03:00:27,000
Because it was at the point where the game was

5222
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:29,000
Plus, I mean I had it on 360 anyway

5223
03:00:29,000 --> 03:00:31,000
But now I have it on PlayStation

5224
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:33,000
Because why not, it was free

5225
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:35,000
So I picked it up there too to try and get some trophies

5226
03:00:35,000 --> 03:00:37,000
And now it's pretty cool to know that, oh okay

5227
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:39,000
Now I can get this DLC

5228
03:00:39,000 --> 03:00:41,000
Which maybe that's the reason they were giving it away for free

5229
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:43,000
Was to try and make a sale there

5230
03:00:43,000 --> 03:00:45,000
But, eh, it'll work

5231
03:00:45,000 --> 03:00:47,000
It'll work

5232
03:00:47,000 --> 03:00:49,000
Yeah, they sure have gotten a sale out of me

5233
03:00:49,000 --> 03:00:51,000
Alright

5234
03:00:51,000 --> 03:00:53,000
Well, anything else you're looking forward to this year?

5235
03:00:53,000 --> 03:00:55,000
Well, mostly this coming week

5236
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:57,000
Like DuckTales

5237
03:00:57,000 --> 03:00:59,000
Like everyone else

5238
03:00:59,000 --> 03:01:01,000
I bet Codeman's happy to hear that

5239
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:03,000
What system are you getting DuckTales on?

5240
03:01:03,000 --> 03:01:05,000
Most possibly Steam, but I'm still debating on it

5241
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:07,000
Okay

5242
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:09,000
Very cool

5243
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:11,000
Alright, well Act F, we're gonna let you go so we can wrap up the show

5244
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:13,000
But thank you and your little Pokemon there for calling in

5245
03:01:13,000 --> 03:01:15,000
Who's waving goodbye, adorable

5246
03:01:15,000 --> 03:01:17,000
Alright, bye Act F, thanks for the call

5247
03:01:17,000 --> 03:01:19,000
We love the video calls, take care

5248
03:01:19,000 --> 03:01:21,000
Alright, that's gonna do it

5249
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:23,000
Shane never answered my question

5250
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:25,000
I'm just gonna see if he wanted my giant Togepi

5251
03:01:25,000 --> 03:01:27,000
He probably turned the show off, so don't give it to him

5252
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:29,000
But you know what?

5253
03:01:29,000 --> 03:01:31,000
Did I tell you how I got my giant Togepi?

5254
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:33,000
I got held up at gunpoint

5255
03:01:33,000 --> 03:01:35,000
Working at GNC

5256
03:01:35,000 --> 03:01:37,000
Oh god, yeah, that's a horrible story

5257
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:39,000
And I found $10 in the parking lot outside Toys R Us

5258
03:01:41,000 --> 03:01:43,000
And I went in

5259
03:01:43,000 --> 03:01:45,000
And I used it to buy myself a giant Togepi

5260
03:01:45,000 --> 03:01:47,000
The $20 Togepi

5261
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:49,000
You earned it

5262
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:51,000
And so my giant Togepi

5263
03:01:51,000 --> 03:01:53,000
Was like my comfort creature thing

5264
03:01:53,000 --> 03:01:55,000
And my Charmander pillow

5265
03:01:55,000 --> 03:01:57,000
Well we have to wrap up the show

5266
03:01:57,000 --> 03:01:59,000
Guys, it's about that time

5267
03:01:59,000 --> 03:02:01,000
We're running a little long tonight

5268
03:02:01,000 --> 03:02:03,000
And Alan and I still have errands to run after the show

5269
03:02:03,000 --> 03:02:05,000
So we're gonna wrap up the show

5270
03:02:05,000 --> 03:02:07,000
I wanna start with Alan tonight

5271
03:02:07,000 --> 03:02:09,000
Thank you very much for being here tonight

5272
03:02:09,000 --> 03:02:11,000
Really appreciate you being on the show

5273
03:02:11,000 --> 03:02:13,000
And lending your wit

5274
03:02:13,000 --> 03:02:15,000
And so forth, don't be a stranger

5275
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:17,000
You only live here

5276
03:02:17,000 --> 03:02:19,000
So do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

5277
03:02:19,000 --> 03:02:21,000
Um

5278
03:02:21,000 --> 03:02:23,000
If I can get my headset replaced

5279
03:02:23,000 --> 03:02:25,000
I might start doing like an achievement run

5280
03:02:25,000 --> 03:02:27,000
In Half Life for Twitch TV

5281
03:02:27,000 --> 03:02:29,000
Fun!

5282
03:02:29,000 --> 03:02:31,000
You think it's time to go wireless?

5283
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:33,000
I don't know, I've had bad experiences with wireless

5284
03:02:33,000 --> 03:02:35,000
Do you have like a Twitter you wanna plug?

5285
03:02:35,000 --> 03:02:37,000
Or anything you wanna plug if people wanna

5286
03:02:37,000 --> 03:02:39,000
Get your wit online? Because you are really funny

5287
03:02:39,000 --> 03:02:41,000
I actually am on Twitter a lot now

5288
03:02:41,000 --> 03:02:43,000
I finally got Twitter

5289
03:02:43,000 --> 03:02:45,000
How it works

5290
03:02:45,000 --> 03:02:47,000
I always just ignore it

5291
03:02:48,000 --> 03:02:50,000
Okay

5292
03:02:50,000 --> 03:02:52,000
It's very salacious

5293
03:02:52,000 --> 03:02:54,000
Alright

5294
03:02:54,000 --> 03:02:56,000
Loki, sorry we didn't get to all the last minute news

5295
03:02:56,000 --> 03:02:58,000
But we're trying to wrap up

5296
03:02:58,000 --> 03:03:00,000
It's been a long show, it's almost 9.30

5297
03:03:00,000 --> 03:03:02,000
Do you have any last minute thoughts for our listeners tonight?

5298
03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:04,000
Uh

5299
03:03:04,000 --> 03:03:06,000
No, not really

5300
03:03:06,000 --> 03:03:08,000
And I will say my final thought tonight

5301
03:03:08,000 --> 03:03:10,000
Is I better be over this damn cold tomorrow

5302
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:12,000
Because I need to get back to work

5303
03:03:12,000 --> 03:03:14,000
I have a ton of work to catch up on for being sick

5304
03:03:14,000 --> 03:03:16,000
For two days

5305
03:03:16,000 --> 03:03:18,000
One plague can kiss my ass

5306
03:03:18,000 --> 03:03:20,000
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight

5307
03:03:23,000 --> 03:03:25,000
I want a house

5308
03:03:25,000 --> 03:03:27,000
And a job

5309
03:03:28,000 --> 03:03:30,000
Probably in that order

5310
03:03:30,000 --> 03:03:32,000
In that order

5311
03:03:32,000 --> 03:03:34,000
By the way

5312
03:03:34,000 --> 03:03:36,000
My cat is the cutest animal in the universe

5313
03:03:36,000 --> 03:03:38,000
Um, next to Sanrio, yes

5314
03:03:38,000 --> 03:03:40,000
Do you know what the next Pink Berry flavor's gonna be?

5315
03:03:40,000 --> 03:03:42,000
Peanut butter

5316
03:03:42,000 --> 03:03:44,000
No, that's out now

5317
03:03:44,000 --> 03:03:46,000
Butter pecan

5318
03:03:46,000 --> 03:03:48,000
Girl

5319
03:03:48,000 --> 03:03:50,000
You know what, they need to start paying advertising on this program

5320
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:52,000
For us to keep talking about them

5321
03:03:52,000 --> 03:03:54,000
Alright, in all seriousness, thank you for staying with our show tonight

5322
03:03:54,000 --> 03:03:56,000
And listening to the show

5323
03:03:56,000 --> 03:03:58,000
After a week off, we really appreciate you sticking with us

5324
03:03:58,000 --> 03:04:00,000
And supporting independent broadcasting

5325
03:04:00,000 --> 03:04:02,000
And if for whatever reason

5326
03:04:02,000 --> 03:04:04,000
You listened to this entire show and you thought it was terrible

5327
03:04:04,000 --> 03:04:06,000
Hey, that's okay

5328
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:08,000
Just all we ask is, find another great

5329
03:04:08,000 --> 03:04:10,000
Independent podcast producer and support that

5330
03:04:10,000 --> 03:04:12,000
Support all of our independent podcast friends

5331
03:04:12,000 --> 03:04:14,000
And if you do like Orange Lawn Tradio

5332
03:04:14,000 --> 03:04:16,000
And you did like what you hear

5333
03:04:16,000 --> 03:04:18,000
Help spread the word, tell a friend or five about the show

5334
03:04:18,000 --> 03:04:20,000
And spread the word about Orange Lawn Tradio

5335
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:22,000
And help us grow our little family

5336
03:04:22,000 --> 03:04:24,000
In the meantime, we will be back next week

5337
03:04:24,000 --> 03:04:26,000
Same time and same place

5338
03:04:26,000 --> 03:04:28,000
To do it all over again

5339
03:04:28,000 --> 03:04:30,000
With DuckTales coming out this week

5340
03:04:30,000 --> 03:04:32,000
And Disney Infinity next Sunday

5341
03:04:32,000 --> 03:04:34,000
I'm sure there'll be plenty of new stuff to talk about

5342
03:04:34,000 --> 03:04:36,000
Oh, I'll probably have Saints Row by then

5343
03:04:36,000 --> 03:04:38,000
Final Fantasy XIV beta as well

5344
03:04:38,000 --> 03:04:40,000
There'll be lots and lots of stuff next week

5345
03:04:40,000 --> 03:04:42,000
Do join us again next week

5346
03:04:42,000 --> 03:04:44,000
You guys, thank you very much for tuning in

5347
03:04:44,000 --> 03:04:46,000
Have a wonderful week

5348
03:04:46,000 --> 03:04:48,000
Good night

5349
03:05:10,000 --> 03:05:12,000
Those of the staff of Orange Lawn Tradio

5350
03:05:12,000 --> 03:05:14,000
Or VOG Network

5351
03:05:14,000 --> 03:05:16,000
But you know they were all still true

5352
03:05:16,000 --> 03:05:18,000
See you next week

5353
03:05:40,000 --> 03:05:42,000
Thanks for watching!
