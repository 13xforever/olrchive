27000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	43000	It's Orange Lounge Radio, episode 516 for this, August the 18th of 2013.
43000	49000	We're here to talk about video games, gaming culture, gamer lifestyle with me, Rob Roberts.
49000	54000	I'm one of your hosts, and joining me as she does every Sunday night, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
54000	55000	Yo.
55000	58000	How are you doing, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers?
58000	59000	Or...
59000	60000	And?
60000	61000	All of the above.
61000	64000	Whatever. You can be whoever you want to be.
64000	66000	Oh, um, I'll be me.
66000	68000	Okay. Well, you do...
68000	69000	I'm really out of it today.
69000	70000	Yeah?
70000	72000	Yeah, it's been a weird, weird week.
72000	74000	Are you on any prescription medications right now?
74000	80000	Well, I'm always on prescription medications that keep me from killing people. On the internet.
80000	83000	No, but I mean, like, are you, uh...
83000	85000	No, no Oxycontin.
85000	87000	Any sickness going around?
87000	90000	I have the rockin pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu.
90000	92000	Sorry to hear it.
92000	94000	No, I'm not. That means I'm happy, I guess.
94000	96000	An apparently obscure reference, uh...
96000	98000	Oh, and there's Techmaster Loki. How you doing, Loki?
98000	99000	I'm doing fine.
99000	100000	Yeah?
100000	101000	Yeah.
101000	102000	What's new with you?
102000	104000	Um... games.
104000	110000	Yeah? Lots of games? We'll get to gaming weeks here shortly, but I noticed you brought a big box full of Disney Infinity with you.
110000	111000	Yes.
111000	118000	So, um, I noticed that you were able to get the game early through your connections, and you put up a YouTube, right?
118000	124000	You did, like, a little unboxing YouTube, because information on Disney Infinity's been kinda not around, really.
124000	131000	Like, the review embargo apparently didn't lift until today, or they didn't have early reviews or something.
131000	137000	Maybe they were afraid the game wasn't gonna get good reviews, although it seems like it's doing alright from the minimal things I've seen today.
137000	144000	But, um, so you did this whole unboxing, you did some playing, and, uh, hilarious stuff going down on YouTube, right?
144000	147000	Uh, yeah, just typical YouTube commenters, you know?
147000	148000	Yeah.
148000	153000	Demanding, you need to tell me how you got that, or else I'm gonna report you to who?
153000	154000	Yeah, report it.
154000	155000	With the police.
155000	158000	He's playing this game before I have it!
159000	161000	Yeah, it's like, whatever, you know?
161000	168000	I would've actually done some more, um, uh, like, actual, like, Let's Plays and stuff, but I just...
168000	170000	I thought you did, I thought you were up on...
170000	173000	Well, I did a stream on, uh, Twitch.
173000	174000	Yeah.
174000	176000	You know, I did something that had audio problems at the beginning, because, you know.
176000	177000	Dope.
177000	185000	Well, it was a whole new setup, so, you know, I was trying to get it to work with my old TV and stuff, and this cable I have just didn't work correctly.
185000	193000	So I ended up setting it up all differently, and then I was trying to hear audio, I was trying to split the audio going to the TV.
193000	207000	So split it between the video capture card and my headset, but when I did that, it, because I needed an amp on it, when I did that, it just, there was no audio coming through at all.
207000	208000	So tech issues.
208000	215000	Yeah, tech issues. So I ended up just listening through my computer, but, you know, the audio was lagged by a couple, like, a second or so.
215000	217000	So it was just a little annoying.
217000	224000	Well, not to, um, tap into your gaming leak too much, although I'm sure you've played plenty else besides Disney Infinity, but what did you think overall of Disney Infinity?
224000	229000	It's alright, um, because I hadn't really played, like, I didn't play Skylanders.
229000	239000	Um, I checked out just, I, the beginning, I did a little, like, a couple of the tutorials, um, that walk you through some of the sandbox, or the toy box stuff.
239000	245000	It's okay, but you don't start off with a whole lot of pieces to build, you know, with the toy box stuff.
245000	251000	Um, some of that you get through, like, these little power-up disc things that you can buy.
251000	259000	Um, not a whole ton of that stuff. A lot of it's just kind of cosmetic, like, you know, it looks like Alice in Wonderland or Little Nemo.
259000	261000	It's just, it's really kind of eh.
261000	271000	Um, there's, there's some pre-built stuff that you can look at, um, but a lot of it you have to play through the actual, they call them the playsets.
271000	272000	Yeah.
272000	276000	So, like, the story campaigns, I guess, for, you know, each of the characters.
276000	279000	So I've been playing through Pirates of the Caribbean, which is alright.
279000	285000	Um, it, I don't know, it's definitely a kid's game, so, you know, it's geared towards that.
285000	289000	Well, I was gonna ask you, what did your young one think of it? Did you let him kind of watch, or?
289000	294000	He didn't really get the watch play, cause, you know, the only time I get the play is when he's gone to bed.
294000	296000	Yeah, and he might be a little, he might be a little too young, too.
296000	297000	Yeah, he-
297000	298000	Like, at three, you don't really-
298000	301000	He doesn't really understand how to use controllers and stuff yet, but he liked the figures.
301000	305000	He, like, took all the cars figures and put them on this little table with his cars and stuff and was playing with them.
305000	306000	Mm-hmm.
306000	319000	Um, so, there's that. Um, and that's kind of how I got it, too, is cause, you know, I'd mentioned to, uh, you know, my friend at, you know, Disney, that, you know, my son was really into, like, you know, he loved Mater.
319000	325000	I was trying to get a Mater figure is what I was trying to do, and they ended up just sending me everything to play with the Mater figures.
325000	328000	So, the game, the cars play set, and Mater.
328000	333000	So, what all, cause I'm having a hard time understanding, like, what all crap are they selling with this?
333000	335000	Because with Skylanders, it's just the figures. That's really-
335000	337000	Oh, no, in the Skylanders, it's not just the figures.
337000	338000	Originally it was.
338000	350000	Yeah, cause Skylanders, like, okay, so Skylanders, they have, you know, and they have a lot, and a lot of it is figures, but it's so crazy now, cause they have, like, for giants, they have the regular figures.
350000	359000	They have light core figures that light up when you put them on the thing. They have giant figures, and then with Swap Force, they're gonna have Swap Force figures with that.
359000	366000	And then they have, like, adventure sets, and then they have battle sets that, you know, have figures, and they're, like, crap with it.
366000	373000	Okay, so what all is there for Disney Infinity? Because now we've entered this world where they're not even really microtransactions, they are literally transactions.
373000	375000	You're going into the store and buying something tangible.
375000	377000	It's physical DLC is basically what it is.
377000	380000	But what all is there? There's character statues, right?
380000	394000	There's characters, there's individual characters, they have character three packs, so they have a villains pack that has, uh, Davy Jones, Randy, and, uh, Syndrome, you know, from all three of the, uh, sets that are in the game.
394000	401000	And then there's a sidekicks pack that has Mike, Mrs. Incredible, and, um, Captain Barboza.
401000	407000	Okay, I don't even know all the packs, but you've got, you've got these characters, and then what? You've got, you've got the, the hidden discs.
408000	411000	We have the blind discs, or the blind packs of the power-up discs.
411000	412000	And what do they do?
412000	427000	Those are basically just, they have add-ons, like, little power-up add-ons for the characters, although, with the, I got two with that, and then I bought personally four because, you know, I haven't invested any money in it yet, so, you know, why not?
427000	434000	Um, and I have yet to get any of the circular power-up discs. I've gotten all just the little, I don't know, hexagonal discs that they have.
434000	435000	What do they do?
435000	436000	Although I have the full, I have the full rare, so they, um.
436000	437000	Wait, what do they do?
437000	454000	They unlock things in the game, so you have, like, um, it could be vehicles, like, uh, you know, Mickey's jalopy, or, you know, there's Abu, and stuff like that, or, like, guns, or, uh, cosmetic stuff, like, you know, different skins for your playset world.
454000	455000	Because you said you had a Wreck-It Ralph one, right?
455000	458000	Yeah, it, it skins the background, like, you know, Wreck-It Ralph.
458000	464000	Okay, so what's the difference between the characters, and then there's a thing called a playset that has the two characters. Is the playset, like, another?
464000	474000	Yeah, the playset's basically, like, a single-player campaign, if you kind of think of it. Or, well, it's a story campaign, so they have a Cars playset, and it comes with two cars with that.
474000	480000	And then they've got the, um, what is it, the Lone Ranger playset that's got the two characters with that.
480000	488000	But obviously, you don't have to buy all that. You can, you know, just pick what you want, because, like, you know, I have no interest in the Lone Ranger.
488000	492000	Yeah, but surely the game incentivizes this stuff somehow.
492000	499000	I think you get, well, the incentive, I think, is you, like, you would with, um, LittleBigPlanet would be a perfect example.
499000	508000	Um, when you buy the add-ons for LittleBigPlanet, like DLC, you get more pieces that you can use in building your own levels. So that's the incentive, I guess.
508000	509000	It's kind of like LittleBigPlanet.
509000	510000	Sort of.
510000	512000	Except without the LittleBigPlanet itself.
512000	517000	Well, you have, like, the Metal Gear stuff you can download, and the Muppets stuff you can download, but, I mean, I don't know, it's just different.
517000	525000	It's very much like LittleBigPlanet. It's like LittleBigPlanet crossed with the Lego games. It's, you know, the way I see it. It's very much like that.
525000	533000	So, it's alright. I mean, they do, like I said, they do kind of prompt you to, like, you know, try to get you the purchase stuff.
533000	538000	But, I mean, Skylanders did the exact same thing, and it doesn't, I didn't run into it too much.
538000	546000	That's the trickiest part, though, because, especially when it's for kids, because, you know, if you have a six or seven year old that is about the right age to be doing this stuff,
546000	552000	you know, they're going to hit these roadblocks, and, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, I have to have it. Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy.
552000	555000	Well, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy.
555000	558000	They don't have to give in to it. I mean, that's the thing.
558000	564000	Yeah, of course they're going to try it. That's like TV commercials, though. Daddy, Daddy, I want whatever's on the TV, you know.
564000	569000	I gotta have this, you know. So, I mean, there's that, but it's not, I don't think it's a huge...
569000	572000	You're ruining my life if you don't buy it.
572000	573000	Like, because I played...
573000	575000	I'm gonna just die.
575000	582000	I tried both Lightning McQueen and Mater in, like, the Cars game, and it didn't seem like that they played too different. They played pretty much exactly the same.
582000	583000	Okay.
583000	587000	So, I don't think it's just a huge difference. Although, it was kind of funny to watch Mater, you know.
587000	592000	So, maybe the place, you really need the play sets, and they come with characters, but maybe you don't need to buy all these extra characters.
592000	601000	Yeah, you probably don't need to buy all these extra characters, and the places come with two characters, so it's kind of nice, like, if you wanted to co-op, like, if you have kids and stuff, and, you know, it has two characters in there.
601000	607000	I just, you know, other than, you know, the characters that are, you know, in these play sets, there's not a whole ton else that you might want.
607000	617000	I mean, maybe if you wanted to co-op in, like, the regular game, you probably would want to pick up at least maybe the sidekicks pack or something, so that way you have an extra set of characters you can play through each one of the play sets.
617000	618000	Makes sense.
618000	631000	But, I mean, it's, you don't have to do all that stuff, and a lot of the stuff you do unlock things as you go through the game, and on top of just the toy box mode, there is a lot of customization within, like, the actual game.
631000	643000	Like, in the Pirates of the Caribbean, so if you can pick up the actual people and throw them into the shop, you can customize what each character looks like, you can customize your ship and what the loadouts are and that and stuff, but a lot of it you have to buy with in-game money.
643000	651000	So, like, I had, like, to upgrade my cans and stuff, I had to, you know, earn money, and it's a lot of grind to get that, but the ship combat's kinda cool.
651000	653000	Yeah, they don't have a store you can just go into and spend 99 cents.
653000	657000	No, they don't have anything like that, but as far as I saw, so, yeah.
657000	659000	Daddy, yeah, yeah, yeah, buy me! Buy me!
659000	669000	I don't think they're gonna do anything like that, because I think that could be a big problem if, you know, all of a sudden kids racked up, you know, hundreds of dollars in online transactions.
669000	675000	Alright, let's go to our chat room. I don't mean to neglect you folks, but you got a lot of good questions, I just wanted to let Loki get his thoughts out.
675000	679000	And then I wanted to have a coughing fit, sorry.
679000	689000	We do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern on Sundays, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
689000	695000	And we do have our chatters there at live.vognetwork.com, and let's see, some of the questions here.
695000	703000	Tigerclaw says, do you guys think Disney Infinity could be huge this coming holiday season, given how successful Skylanders was? It could be bigger because of the Disney's name.
703000	711000	Well, I think that's the idea, and I think a lot of, like, if this game flops, which I kinda don't think it will.
711000	712000	I don't think it's gonna.
712000	721000	But if this game flops, like, Disney Interactive will close. I think that's kinda what's riding on this, for real, because they've invested a lot into this.
721000	723000	I don't see how it could fail right now.
724000	726000	I really don't see how it could fail either.
726000	734000	The figures are nice. I like the figures. Like, even if I didn't have the game and it just had the figures, I mean, the figures are nice. They'd be something I'd put up on my shelf. I mean, they look cool.
734000	742000	I don't know. It has that going for it. And the game's not bad. And I like the whole, like, toy box mode in there. It's kinda cool where you can build your own things.
743000	751000	So there's that going for it. And really, like, the new Skylanders game is just kind of a very linear action game.
751000	756000	And so, I just don't know. I don't think there's a whole lot of incentive to buy stuff for that.
756000	763000	E3VL wants to know what your YouTube channel is, where you had the unboxing, where he can leave nasty comment. No, I made that part up. But where can you leave that?
763000	764000	It's just Loki O.L.R.
764000	765000	It's all one word?
765000	766000	Yeah, just all one word.
767000	776000	Let's see. Dartitsuya at live.vognetwork.com asks, you think the figures and discs and so forth will get to be like the pins at the Magic Kingdom? I think that's what Disney wants.
776000	784000	Definitely. And they have rares in each one of the sets. I've got a full set and then some of the rares so far.
784000	788000	And I'm sure some of the Disney souvenir shops are already selling this.
788000	799000	And they have exclusive rares. For example, they have Mike's car that's exclusive to Toys R Us right now. Toys R Us kind of does that thing. In fact, I'll actually give you some of these because I have duplicates.
799000	804000	Woohoo! Well, I guess I'm gonna have to get the stupid game at some point. We'll see. I don't know. I was kind of trying to hold off.
804000	807000	I'm gonna put my foot down and stomp and pout. I'm not gonna.
807000	820000	Let's do a little bit of roleplay, DarkSakura. Let's do a little roleplay, okay? Let's assume that I'm your kid. Heaven help you. And that you just bought me the Disney Infinity Starter set, okay?
820000	823000	No, that would assume that I would have gotten you the Disney Infinity Starter set.
823000	825000	We're playing make-believe. We're playing make-believe. All right.
825000	827000	Yeah, but if I was being a parent, I wouldn't do it. Because I'm poor.
827000	834000	Okay, then Uncle Loki was spoiling and bought it for me. Okay, so now I have it. All right, so here we go.
834000	836000	Thank you, Uncle Loki!
836000	837000	You're welcome.
837000	846000	Mommy! Mommy, you have to buy me! Mommy, you have to buy me the cars! Mommy! Mommy, Mommy, Mommy! You have to buy it!
846000	851000	Rob? Rob? Rob? Rob? I don't have to buy you shit. Go to your room.
851000	861000	You little ingrate! Time out! Ten minutes in your room on time out and you're not allowed to play with any toys. You have to stare at the wall.
861000	865000	And then come back and tell me what you did wrong.
865000	868000	I-O-I-O!
868000	875000	Or you could go to the backyard and pick a Switch. That's what happened to me when I was a kid.
875000	878000	All right, let's see.
878000	880000	I love you guys, chat.
880000	886000	It's live.vognotework.com. Let's see, other comments here. Back on a serious note.
886000	891000	Black Wolf wants to know, how much story is included in the base game without buying anything else?
891000	899000	You have the full thing for Parts of the Caribbean, The Incredibles, and Monsters U. So you have three playsets, basically.
899000	902000	So it's like three little mini-adventures you get to play through.
902000	909000	They're pretty long. I mean, I've already played through about a few hours of Parts of the Caribbean. I'm not very far into it, so.
909000	913000	There's a lot there. A lot of content, I think.
913000	919000	Tigerclaw wants to know, does the game actually end if you don't have all the figures? Can you just play the core game and finish it?
919000	921000	So you get the three little adventures.
921000	925000	No, the game doesn't end. You just play through everything.
925000	935000	There's additional missions, I think, in each game where if you have different characters you can do a little mini-game or mission or something.
935000	940000	It definitely doesn't end. You can keep going through and playing things and unlocking stuff.
940000	948000	Because some of the unlocks are random when you unlock things. One of them is a Tron costume for some little figure that's running around.
948000	950000	Exactly. I wanted that, too.
950000	952000	That's why you bought the four things.
952000	958000	No, no. Even on the livestream, it's just like, Tron costume. Come on, come on, come on. I don't want that!
958000	960000	Did she get a Cinderella carriage or something?
960000	964000	By the way, Rob, you should be really happy that I didn't break out my mom's accent.
964000	968000	I did my momma impersonation.
968000	970000	We'll roleplay again sometime.
970000	971000	Oh, girl.
971000	976000	But look at Jim Sally in our chatroom. Hi, Jim Sally. We haven't seen Jim Sally in a while. I hope he's doing well.
976000	977000	Jim Sally has responsibilities.
977000	986000	Yes. Jim Sally said, Rob's annoying kid impression is awesome. Thank you. Well, I was one of those annoying kids growing up, so there you go.
986000	988000	I'm just tapping into what I know.
989000	1001000	Anyhow, I think that's all I want to talk about Disney Infinity. Quickly, before we get into officially our gaming weeks, I guess I'm ruining it a little bit by talking about the beta that has a lot of people's attention captured this weekend.
1001000	1009000	There's actually really, there's two big betas going on right now. There's, and I'll talk about this later in the show, there's a Blizzard-related beta for their free-to-play game.
1010000	1017000	But there's also, that one is invite-only, and so only certain people are playing it right now in certain fan sites and so forth.
1017000	1025000	But there's an open beta going on for another game, Final Fantasy XIV, which is one I've been talking about a little bit on the show before.
1025000	1036000	And we're going to talk about this by just straight up, the first version never happened. Bad figment of the imagination, not going to go talk about version one anymore.
1036000	1038000	Because this is now the real Final Fantasy XIV.
1038000	1041000	It almost seemed like the intro was like, we blew up that world, lol.
1041000	1045000	Yeah, well he said he was inspired by World of Warcraft Cataclysm, the producer, so.
1045000	1052000	But Dark Soccer, you've been playing it, and I've been playing it. I literally, I literally played for 15 hours yesterday.
1052000	1053000	At it.
1053000	1055000	And, you know, well here's the thing.
1055000	1056000	Ah, the good old days.
1056000	1061000	I know, here's my justification. When was the last time I had a day like that? I couldn't tell you.
1061000	1069000	Between rehearsals for local shows, between work-related stuff, between other, you know, I just have not had a day like that.
1069000	1073000	So it's really just what the doctor ordered, to sit and do nothing all day. It felt great.
1073000	1083000	The last time I did that, apart from when I had almost broken my ankle and was playing WoW for, what, 20 hours in a day, was Ragnarok Online back in the beta.
1083000	1087000	I mean, seriously, when I was in the beta of that game for seven years.
1087000	1090000	Oh, you haven't had like a console game come around lately that sucked you in like that?
1090000	1096000	Well, when I had hand surgery, I was high on Vicodin, and played Blue Dragon, like, and almost finished the game.
1096000	1101000	I think when Final Fantasy XIII first came out, I think I spent, oops, sorry, didn't mean to kick you.
1101000	1103000	PSO, good point, Brad.
1103000	1108000	I think I played Final Fantasy XIII a heck of a lot. But anyway, the XIV beta's going on.
1108000	1116000	You know, I'm hearing it's having its share of issues, that people are having problems when they zone, they get kicked out, and then they cannot log back in the game.
1116000	1122000	Which actually, that happened to me once, but it resolved itself within 10 minutes. So I didn't really have the serious issue.
1122000	1131000	And besides full servers, once in a while, which seems to also go away after 15, 20 minutes, I'm not hearing of a lot of issues that my friends are having.
1132000	1138000	When I go over to like Reddit, or like forums, I see like, you would think the entire world's having problems, but I don't know.
1138000	1142000	It sucks that people are getting locked out of this beta, but...
1142000	1152000	Well, there was the Worldful thing today, and I actually went and made a character on the European server, on Shiva, just so I could see what the server lists looked like.
1152000	1155000	And there were maybe four servers that weren't blacked out.
1155000	1160000	Well, the quote-unquote official server got changed at the last minute for Horde House 2.
1160000	1163000	Midgarsemer is the server that we're actually playing on.
1163000	1172000	We were originally going to play on a different server, but it was so popular that they closed out new character creation, like only a couple hours after it opened, because everybody was going there.
1172000	1181000	So Shane and I had a quick discussion. It's like, alright, it's more important that we pick an open server that our friends can get on than necessarily picking a populated server.
1181000	1190000	So Midgarsemer is what we picked. Well, finally, it took a good 24 hours, but Midgarsemer filled up, too, now, and they had to actually open new worlds.
1190000	1195000	And unfortunately, people can only roll on the new worlds. They can't go to the worlds.
1195000	1204000	So I kind of think that part is a bit of a mess, that Square is going to have to figure out a solution, because why would you fucking play an MMO if you can't play it with your friends?
1204000	1209000	It gets really boring that way. I mean, we'll go make new friends, moron!
1209000	1215000	Why did I stop playing WoW? Yeah, exactly. Why am I playing less and less WoW? Like, more and more people I know left.
1215000	1224000	You know, if we were, and I was actually saying something to that thing yesterday, I prefer playing Alliance to Horde, and unfortunately our Alliance guild just sort of dried up.
1224000	1232000	Except for Grandpa. But you can't blame people for not having fun anymore and not enjoying the game. I mean, they left because for whatever reason they weren't having fun.
1232000	1237000	I don't blame anybody, but that's why I left, because I had no one to play with that, and Pandas was kind of stupid.
1237000	1242000	Pandas, as in the expansion, was, I hate the grind. Hate the grind.
1242000	1255000	Well, you know, every expansion has its up and down. But anyway, so Final Fantasy XIV is going on, and despite those things, I hope they are able to institute, I think the world pass thing that they had in Final Fantasy XI actually worked out really well.
1255000	1263000	Where, like, if you're friends on the server, they buy you a pass that you can use to get on. And it costs them a lot of gil, depending on how many people are already on the server.
1263000	1266000	You bought me mine? Yeah, but people will do it. People will do it.
1266000	1280000	So, anyway. Otherwise, I mean, the good news is, I'm just, God, the game is gorgeous. I love running instances with friends. There was myself, Shane, Captain Spike from Game Buoy, and TimTrip were all running.
1280000	1292000	We have the perfect layout of classes that the four of us can make a light party, and we did the beginner instances just back to back last night, and they're so fucking gorgeous. And having fun with it.
1292000	1305000	Some people might criticize that the classes don't have enough abilities, and that healing is kind of like whack-a-mole because of it, but I kind of think if you're a really good healer, you can heal and DPS at the same time. It's really possible.
1305000	1309000	I mean, you actually pretty much learn how to do that when you're settling your duties.
1309000	1319000	And for folks that liked Warcraft back in the very beginning, when it was minimal abilities, too, I think they might find something kind of fun in Final Fantasy XIV.
1319000	1329000	But I love it. I'm definitely buying the game when it comes out, and I will sub for at least a few months while I figure out, you know, am I going to cancel WoW to play this? Am I going to stick with this?
1329000	1340000	I'm really curious to see what the end game is like, because I know a lot about Final Fantasy XIV from levels 0 to 20, because I've actually been in since the alpha, so I've done that grind like five times, 0 to 20.
1340000	1352000	And so I know a lot about it, but I don't know much about what the game is past that, and that kind of concerns me. But it could, I mean, it's only a concern. That doesn't mean it's going to be negative. I just don't know.
1352000	1356000	And if the end game isn't exciting enough, it's not going to really keep me there once I get to 50.
1356000	1367000	I will tell you one thing, though, is that, I mean, and you were online for a little bit of this when I went exploring in the level 30 area. It actually had a lot of really neat stuff.
1367000	1379000	There were some neat characters I've found, Costa del Sol, which you can't get to right now except by walking, because it's, the fairies are disabled, and Limsa Lominsa.
1379000	1380000	Yeah, Limsa Lominsa.
1380000	1382000	Limsa, that's hard to say.
1382000	1383000	Just say Limsa.
1384000	1386000	Which, by the way, is my favorite town so far.
1386000	1391000	I love the leader of that town, the female Rogenan. She's great, and her voice acting I like the best.
1391000	1396000	I'm super enjoying Arcanist. I mean, just because my carbo-glue is so cute.
1396000	1397000	It's a great class.
1397000	1406000	And I haven't had nearly the same problems I did with Thaumaturge, because Thaumaturge, well, I mean, they've also fixed the duties, but still.
1407000	1416000	But I had to say that just what I saw, there were some pretty encouraging things for stories. I think we're going to get more raid-like content and stuff like that.
1416000	1429000	It sounds like they're really going to be developing it and so forth, but if they fuck up some of these basics, like getting people who want to play together able to play together and in the same guild, if they fuck up these basics, it isn't going to matter how much they invest in the game in the end.
1429000	1438000	So I really hope, you know, but again, it's a beta. Y'all didn't pay for it this weekend, so this is the disclaimer to that.
1438000	1443000	And I know a lot of people are forming their opinions of the game based on this weekend, but it is what it is.
1443000	1450000	Well, my plan for next weekend, because I've been taking it really slowly. I've been trying to sparse it out since I can't go past 20 this weekend.
1450000	1457000	I'm at 14 right now and I figured that when I hit like 18, I was going to start trying weaving or something, you know, whenever.
1457000	1466000	But I've already decided that I'm probably going to be selling off some of my services so that I can afford to buy the game because it really is.
1466000	1475000	I was excited. I really enjoy it. It has some of the elements I liked about Cataclysm that made me finally think WoW was fun.
1475000	1479000	Because you remember how many times I started WoW and then just said, oh, boring, oh, boring, boring.
1479000	1487000	It had a lot of the fun. It had characters that made me, I laughed at my desk, I mean, especially with the moogles drinking all the wine.
1487000	1488000	Did you see that bit?
1488000	1489000	Yes, yes, I did.
1489000	1495000	It's so cute. Because I rolled a Lalafell this morning. A really cute little teeny Lalafell.
1496000	1506000	I just, I have different things that make me laugh. I mean, the only things in WoW that really made me laugh were like the very meta stuff and the weird pop culture jokes.
1506000	1508000	Like, you know, Harris Pilton and all that.
1508000	1516000	Yeah. They actually, they did a little bit of pop culture jokes in 14, too, in the localization, which was a pleasant surprise.
1516000	1524000	Like, one of the levels that you level up is Arcanist or Conjurer, one of them. The little achievement is called, just talk about Shaft.
1525000	1526000	Yeah.
1526000	1529000	Maybe it was mining. I don't know. But anyway, it's just funny.
1529000	1536000	But I've had a, well, you know, and the names of the quests have been funny. You know, I've really had a lot of fun.
1536000	1543000	And the other big thing for me is that I have really been enjoying having my friends on, you know, people to chat with.
1543000	1544000	Yeah.
1544000	1551000	And the fact that nobody had, you know what, I'd give you a hug for free, Jim Sally, but you have to come out here and get it.
1551000	1561000	No, I'm doing logos for people. I'm working on a logo for a couple of people right now and making fabric art.
1561000	1562000	Awesome.
1562000	1563000	Yes.
1563000	1564000	Well, good luck with all of that.
1564000	1567000	Thank you. So I can game and pay for my habit.
1567000	1568000	Pay for your obsession.
1568000	1569000	As I tap in my vein.
1569000	1574000	All right. I'm sure we'll get phone calls on Final Fantasy XIV later, but that's all we'll say on it for now.
1574000	1581000	If you do want to play with OLR people and generally VoG people, Horde House kind of snatched that and took that over.
1581000	1587000	We're all on the Midgarsemer server. So it will open up eventually, even if it's locked when you try to create a character.
1587000	1593000	Check back in like 30 minutes, check back in an hour. And I'm sure this will be the case in early access as well.
1593000	1597000	It does open up and Midgarsemer is not supposed to be one of the super populated servers.
1597000	1601000	So you will be able to get in eventually. It just might be frustrating that you can't get in right away.
1601000	1608000	But all of us that were super eager about this game, we all got in and it's going to be too tough to move everybody at this point.
1608000	1610000	So we're going to stick it out on Midgarsemer.
1610000	1614000	So you can get more information on the Horde House, Twitter, twitter.com slash Horde House.
1614000	1620000	We do have a link shell set up right now called Horde House, but all a link shell is, is a fancy chat channel.
1620000	1625000	Free companies are the guilds and we're going to set one of those up as soon as they open up.
1625000	1627000	And we're trying to think of a good name right now.
1627000	1631000	What we want to do is we want something where the acronym is VOG.
1631000	1636000	So it'll be something like, like Vanquishers of Garland or something.
1636000	1638000	You know, we want something that'll be VOG.
1638000	1639000	Gilgamesh.
1639000	1640000	Yeah.
1640000	1641000	That's very Final Fantasy like.
1641000	1646000	Yeah, we're going to. So if you have some good ideas, throw them out there, especially Shane, because he'll be the one that puts it all together.
1646000	1648000	I'm sure because he's going to.
1648000	1650000	Verp of gastritis.
1650000	1653000	But yeah, we're looking at something where the abbreviation will be VOG.
1653000	1655000	So just to kind of tie it together. Be fun.
1655000	1658000	So. All right.
1658000	1662000	Let's see. Codeman says in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
1662000	1666000	Like I asked before, if you roll on that server when live, will you still be on that server?
1666000	1672000	Yes, the characters are not supposed to delete between open beta and live at this point.
1672000	1676000	If there is a huge game breaking bug, they may still erase them.
1676000	1683000	Although, although I don't know, because of all these issues people are having, maybe that'll be justification for them to erase them.
1683000	1684000	I hope not.
1684000	1687000	But this is why everybody was very much about like they wanted to get on the server.
1687000	1691000	They want to get on because this is your real character now that you're going to have in the main game.
1691000	1693000	So we'll see. So.
1693000	1697000	Bobby said very old gamers.
1697000	1700000	That would mostly be accurate. We'll see.
1700000	1704000	All right. Technus in chat says, if you can't think of a name, find a Latin phrase.
1704000	1709000	You know, you don't know how many Warcraft guilds that worked for.
1709000	1712000	And Final Fantasy 11 to be fair.
1712000	1716000	All right. Geeklet in our chat room says they might have to wipe the server to fix that dumb error.
1716000	1718000	That is a distinct possibility.
1718000	1720000	So we all have to kind of be prepared for that.
1720000	1725000	That's why I kind of, I leveled my, and we'll wrap up this discussion guys.
1725000	1726000	I knew when we get to the other games.
1726000	1731000	I leveled one of my jobs to like 18 and another one to 13 and then did some crafting stuff.
1731000	1734000	And so if they wiped them all, I would be kind of mad.
1734000	1740000	But at the end of the day, that's the reason why I stopped playing too and I'm not going to play anymore.
1740000	1744000	I logged out and am getting my rest bar because if they do wipe it, then fine.
1744000	1746000	You know, I'll just, I'll deal with it.
1746000	1748000	That's kind of my logic too.
1748000	1754000	Well, and there's the other thing too, is that I'm probably going to stick with just caster classes for a while because,
1754000	1762000	and I love this so much over some of the stuff they did in 11 is that your gear will carry over to multiple classes.
1762000	1763000	It's nice.
1763000	1769000	Yeah. And I can keep using my leather gear in a, like as a gladiator or whatever, if I wanted to.
1769000	1772000	So I wouldn't have to, cause I sold all my old gear. Oops.
1772000	1776000	All right. Anyhow, let's talk about officially our gaming week.
1776000	1780000	So besides Disney infinity, besides Final Fantasy 14, what kind of games have you been playing this week?
1780000	1782000	Is there anything else, Rob?
1782000	1785000	No. And clearly I'm playing Animal Crossing right now.
1785000	1787000	My village is open.
1787000	1791000	What if people want to add you, be your friend on 3DS so they can visit during the show?
1791000	1792000	How do they do that?
1792000	1793000	Well, I'd have to add them back.
1793000	1802000	So, um, I might close and then reopen in part B so I can put out my friend code cause I don't memorize it.
1802000	1804000	So be here live, live.vognetwork.com Sunday nights.
1804000	1806000	Yeah, that's how you get it. You have to be here live.
1806000	1807000	Yeah, that's how you're going to get it.
1807000	1811000	Um, unless, unless one of you guys, like I know Actideft has it.
1811000	1816000	See, I would point you to the friend code thread at vognetwork.com, but I know Jamie doesn't check it.
1816000	1817000	I posted it.
1817000	1818000	Oh, did you?
1818000	1819000	I posted there.
1819000	1823000	So Rob, thank you for your assumptions. Geez.
1823000	1825000	I never, I'm never happier to be wrong.
1825000	1827000	I'm so insulted.
1827000	1828000	Oh, get over it.
1828000	1829000	You know what? Okay.
1829000	1837000	Um, I played some Mass Effect 3 because I am still working on trying to get a custom texture and not texture, a custom mesh to work,
1837000	1841000	but unfortunately it's not using any of the default textures in it.
1841000	1845000	And I hate using text mod with Mass Effect 3, so I'm just sort of like, bleh.
1845000	1852000	Um, I am also, I've, what did I play? Oh yeah, I played more Fractal.
1852000	1857000	I'm back to playing Fractal because that is my game that I play when my brain is too busy.
1857000	1864000	Like if I have all these thoughts that I just want to get out of my head, I completely blank out and play Fractal.
1864000	1865000	It's such a good game.
1865000	1871000	I've also, um, I got Dan DuckTales and I got myself a copy.
1871000	1878000	I haven't touched it yet, but basically I've been watching Dan play through the whole thing and humming along with the music because it's so good.
1878000	1882000	And he found an 8-bit music mode, so he was super happy and playing through it with that.
1882000	1887000	Um, I played some other stuff. What did I play?
1887000	1895000	Oh yeah, this, well I went to Scandia this morning because we went to breakfast and then played mini golf, which, it's 102 today,
1895000	1900000	and it was already like 90 something at 11 this morning, so I was like, I'm not having any more of that.
1900000	1912000	I've got a sunburn, but I went inside and, poor Scandia, I met a person who works there named Danny, who apparently owns two DX machines, several of them,
1912000	1918000	and a Pump It Up and a DDR and a Poppin' Music and has like the actual arcade cabinets. He showed me photos of them.
1918000	1920000	I was like, I'm going to be friends with you.
1920000	1925000	Actually it was really cool and he was fixing one of the machines that I lost some tokens to.
1925000	1928000	You know what's funny? I think I've heard of this guy. Somebody was telling me about-
1928000	1929000	I'm on his Facebook now.
1929000	1933000	Somebody was telling me about a friend, a friend of a friend or something here, who had a bunch of those cabinets in their house.
1933000	1937000	Yeah, it's, um, I forget. He has an arcade in his garage.
1937000	1940000	Yeah, that might have been him. So, but anyway, he was really nice.
1940000	1941000	Apparently he's a legend around here.
1941000	1948000	Well, he was a really nice guy. We chatted about games, we talked about pinball for a little while, and, um, yes, 2DX.
1948000	1951000	Seanigan. It's Seanigan. That's what it was.
1951000	1956000	Well, I just, he let me add him on Facebook, so it was really cool.
1956000	1963000	Um, so anyway, uh, we, uh, I don't know, Misty. I didn't ask. I just saw pictures.
1963000	1967000	Um, so anyway, uh, he fixed the machine that I was on and we, you know, chatted about-
1967000	1972000	The 2DX marquee, the big speaker setup, is on top of the ticket cage.
1972000	1978000	Not the ticket cage, the, where you buy your, um, your mini golf stuff inside the arcade.
1978000	1984000	Um, so sitting in a Raiden Fighters cabinet was actually a DonPachi, which I was like, it's a copy of DonPachi.
1984000	1990000	It's an arcade one, so I played it and the right side was broken, but the second side worked fine, and I played Guitar Hero.
1990000	1996000	And Dan played Crazy Taxi because some kid kept, uh, putting in, uh, tokens.
1996000	1997000	Crazy money?
1997000	2000000	Let's make some crazy money! Yeah.
2000000	2004000	So, um, hi Brad. Brad just arrived in Normandy.
2004000	2010000	So anyway, um, we, uh, you know, we're basically going around just playing all kinds of different games.
2010000	2012000	They had to pump it up. I didn't know that they'd gotten to pump it up.
2012000	2019000	But, uh, there were, I was a little dismayed. I mean, I shouldn't have been surprised.
2019000	2027000	They have no more pinball. Um, all the ticket games, of course, were in perfect condition, but the Tekken 5 had no monitor in it.
2027000	2036000	There was another game that had no monitor in it. The, um, X-Men vs. Street Fighter had, like, such bad, um, burn-in.
2036000	2039000	The monitor was, like, green. It was really in bad shape.
2040000	2045000	Um, I played some Silent Scope. A little Dark Silhouette because that one was really the best of them.
2045000	2052000	Um, then, uh, I really did play a lot of stuff this week, relatively.
2052000	2058000	Uh, you've loaned me Kid Icarus Uprising, which I started and then had to put down because the cat threw up.
2058000	2062000	That's a shitty, that's a crappy reason to stop playing a game.
2062000	2063000	No, it's a barfy reason.
2063000	2066000	Um, she threw up on Dan's chair. I was so mad.
2066000	2067000	Alright.
2067000	2074000	She's such a brat. Um, so, yeah, uh, and I was gonna start, um, Birth by Sleep, but I barred it from my friend.
2074000	2076000	I was like, I'm already playing too much. I just gave it back to her.
2076000	2080000	Alright, is there anything else you actually played or is this all thought about playing?
2080000	2082000	Well, no, it's, I started stuff.
2082000	2089000	Oh, and Final Fantasy VII, but I just cannot play it with keyboards, so fuck it. I'm gonna find the controller somewhere.
2089000	2092000	Get those trading cards somewhere. Oh, wait, Final Fantasy VII doesn't have trading cards, so.
2092000	2094000	I don't even give a shit about the trading cards thing.
2094000	2098000	I played Magic for five years. I'm kinda over card games.
2098000	2101000	Alright, Loki, uh, how was your gaming week?
2101000	2107000	Um, it didn't play a whole ton of stuff other than Disney Infinity and Saints Row IV.
2107000	2112000	So I played a lot of Saints Row IV in the last couple days here and it's, it's fun.
2112000	2119000	Um, you know, definitely a lot different than Saints Row III with the whole superpower thing.
2119000	2127000	Um, at the same time, some of the, you know, challenges that are in the game, the actual stuff you have to do to get some experience and stuff,
2127000	2134000	like driving a car for like a long distance and stuff, seems like it's gonna be kind of difficult to do that since you don't,
2134000	2140000	there's really no need to drive a car since you can run super fast and jump over buildings and fly.
2140000	2146000	So that's kind of the only annoying thing is that there's not really a point to the cars at all.
2146000	2154000	Um, there was one little, I don't know if it's a glitch, but a design flaw, if I were to call it,
2154000	2162000	where when you're buying stuff at a store, if people happen to be attacking you, it will kick you out of the menu that you're in.
2162000	2168000	So like I was in Friendly Fire buying, I was actually messing with the dubstep gun, looking at all the different designs.
2168000	2169000	Dubstep gun?
2169000	2170000	Yeah, the dubstep gun.
2170000	2171000	Does it wub wub?
2171000	2177000	Yes it does. All the different designs that they had in there for that because they had different dubstep tracks that it would play,
2177000	2182000	and so I was cycling through those, and unfortunately, you know, that got my wanted level up a little bit,
2182000	2190000	and so I went back into the store and I was trying to cycle through to the next, you know, one, and it kept kicking me out of the menu.
2190000	2193000	Now I'm like, what the hell is going on? Why am I getting kicked out of the menu?
2193000	2199000	So then I went back into it again and got kicked out of the menu again, and so then I saw that I was getting shot by a cop.
2199000	2202000	So it's kind of dumb that they had that.
2202000	2207000	I understand that, yeah, you can't hide in stores anymore to drop your notoriety,
2207000	2211000	but at the very least they should pause the game when you're in a menu
2211000	2218000	because it's kind of dumb that you can't browse the menu while you're, you know, in the middle of a fight.
2218000	2224000	I mean, I don't see why you would, why they should do that, but whatever, that's their choice.
2224000	2226000	So that was a little annoying.
2226000	2229000	I did find a couple hidden weapons in the game.
2229000	2235000	They have the penetrator, the giant dildo bat hidden in the game.
2235000	2236000	Oh no, it's back.
2236000	2238000	It's back, yes.
2238000	2247000	Well, they also have a tentacle bat, and they also have an anal probe that has a tongue on it.
2247000	2249000	That's awesome.
2249000	2250000	Wow.
2250000	2253000	And it makes licking motions when you're in it.
2253000	2255000	So that's kind of funny.
2255000	2258000	So they've got that, y'all need Jesus.
2258000	2263000	And then some of the, like, weapon skins they have in there are kind of dumb,
2263000	2266000	so I didn't really mess with a whole ton of that stuff.
2266000	2269000	But I have, like, a lot of the upgrades are kind of cool.
2269000	2275000	I just, it felt like I don't really like the whole having to pick health pickups,
2275000	2280000	having to gather health pickups instead of having just a regenerating health,
2280000	2284000	which has been in the game forever, but they decided to switch it up.
2284000	2287000	It's not a huge deal, but it's kind of annoying.
2287000	2288000	I'm trying to think of anyone else.
2288000	2289000	So far, the story's kind of fun.
2289000	2294000	I haven't really played a whole bunch of the story missions yet, but it was funny.
2294000	2297000	There was moments that I was laughing out loud.
2297000	2304000	I love the new, like, the third had, like, these wrestling moves you could do
2304000	2308000	if you hold down sprint and, you know, hit one of the attack buttons.
2308000	2313000	Well, now they have, like, super powered attacks, and they're just goddamn ridiculous,
2313000	2316000	like, throwing people up there and just, like, stomping on their skull
2316000	2318000	and just ridiculous stuff in the game.
2318000	2321000	So I kind of dig that.
2321000	2322000	And then what else?
2322000	2324000	So I've been playing an Xbox 360.
2324000	2330000	I just preloaded my Steam copy, so I'm looking forward to that.
2330000	2333000	So I'll be playing this for a while until Grand Theft Auto V comes out.
2333000	2334000	And then all bets are off.
2334000	2336000	It's just going to be Grand Theft Auto until I die.
2336000	2339000	We'll talk about Grand Theft Auto V and your excitement a little later in the show,
2339000	2341000	but anything else for your gaming week?
2341000	2342000	That was it.
2342000	2343000	Okay.
2343000	2346000	The only game I'll talk about besides Final Fantasy XIV earlier
2346000	2349000	is another game that I played this week was DuckTales Remastered,
2349000	2351000	which Dark Soccer already brought up.
2351000	2354000	I played it on Wii U, actually.
2354000	2358000	I just decided, you know what, I'm going to take a leap of faith
2358000	2360000	and see what the Wii U version might have to offer
2360000	2363000	that the 360 and the PS3 ones wouldn't have with the second screen.
2363000	2368000	It did take me a little while to figure out that you can actually get the map
2368000	2370000	on the second screen while you're playing.
2370000	2375000	It's not just a carbon copy of the game, which is what it defaults to,
2375000	2377000	but the game doesn't really tell you how to do it.
2377000	2378000	I kind of had to figure it out.
2378000	2381000	So the trick is, just in case anyone else gets it on Wii U,
2381000	2384000	when you pause the game like you would see the map normally,
2384000	2387000	hit the X button, and then the map will take up the whole bottom screen
2387000	2390000	and stay that way when you're playing, which is cool.
2390000	2393000	Although, let's be real, DuckTales never really had complicated maps.
2393000	2397000	The only reason I needed it was because of all the little mini missions they put in.
2397000	2400000	Sometimes you need to find all the coins or whatever.
2400000	2402000	It helps me be able to find everything.
2402000	2404000	And know where I've been and where I haven't.
2404000	2406000	That's kind of helpful.
2406000	2409000	Did you notice that they did change a few things around?
2409000	2410000	Oh, God, yes.
2410000	2414000	There's that new level in the beginning, and then they totally changed the end,
2414000	2417000	where in the NES game, you used to go back to Transylvania,
2417000	2420000	and that's where you would fight the last boss.
2420000	2422000	But in this one, they made a whole new level.
2422000	2425000	Spoiler, sorry, but come on.
2425000	2429000	They made a new level, Mount Vesuvius, that you play instead,
2429000	2432000	which is kind of like inside a volcano, so it's very different
2432000	2436000	and much harder in difficulty than the base levels.
2436000	2443000	More spoiler alert, after the final boss, there's a Metroid-esque escape element.
2443000	2448000	That was definitely controller-throwing frustration.
2448000	2452000	Luckily, I own a Wii U, so I wasn't about to throw that controller.
2452000	2454000	But thought about it.
2454000	2455000	I heard plenty of screaming.
2455000	2457000	Yeah, Alan could tell you all about it.
2457000	2459000	He was here when I was playing through it.
2459000	2461000	So that was fun.
2461000	2464000	So the game itself, when it was like the game modes, is great.
2464000	2466000	The soundtrack is amazing.
2466000	2469000	The graphics look great.
2469000	2470000	I love the redone sprites.
2470000	2472000	Cartoony has a great look.
2472000	2474000	Honestly, my biggest problem with DuckTales,
2474000	2477000	and I really feel horrible saying this, but it was the voice acting,
2477000	2482000	and not the talent, because it's the original talent doing it,
2482000	2486000	and they're great, even though it's showing its age a little bit.
2486000	2488000	I didn't mind that.
2488000	2491000	What I did mind is that it constantly interrupted the action
2491000	2494000	in what is supposed to be a fast game.
2494000	2497000	And although after you play through the whole thing once,
2497000	2499000	you can skip cut scenes later on,
2499000	2502000	it's still really annoying that you're going through the game
2502000	2504000	and then, oh, stop, cut scene.
2504000	2506000	Oh, stop, cut scene.
2506000	2509000	And I get that if you have kids or whatever,
2509000	2510000	they're going to eat it up.
2510000	2511000	They're going to love it.
2511000	2514000	If you love the old 90s show, it's great.
2514000	2515000	You're going to love it.
2515000	2516000	But I don't know.
2516000	2519000	I kind of got over it pretty quick,
2519000	2521000	and I just wanted to play the game,
2521000	2524000	and that experience kept getting interrupted every five seconds.
2524000	2526000	And that was one thing I loved about the original game.
2526000	2528000	It was this game you could really speed run
2528000	2533000	and beat the whole thing in not even an hour maybe if you're good.
2533000	2535000	So I don't know.
2535000	2537000	I did not like that whole stop-and-go element,
2537000	2539000	and here's what really pissed me off.
2539000	2545000	The quality of the audio is atrocious.
2545000	2546000	Was it?
2546000	2547000	Not the music.
2547000	2548000	The music's great.
2548000	2551000	The voice acting audio quality, horrible.
2551000	2553000	Scrooge sounds like he's coming through an iPhone.
2553000	2556000	It sounded really clear on the PC.
2557000	2559000	It might be a Wii U thing.
2559000	2564000	It could be, but I heard the same thing from somebody who played it on 360.
2564000	2565000	It's a console thing, man.
2565000	2567000	Maybe it is a console thing.
2567000	2570000	I don't know, but the quality of the sound itself was really bad,
2570000	2574000	especially the worst is when you're going through,
2574000	2577000	and he gets hit or whatever, and he'll go,
2577000	2579000	oh, ouch, things like that.
2579000	2582000	It gets drowned out by the music.
2582000	2583000	It sounds really out of place.
2583000	2584000	It gets really repetitive.
2584000	2585000	It's horrible.
2585000	2589000	So, yeah, not a fan of that.
2589000	2593000	So when I was actually playing the game DuckTales Remastered,
2593000	2594000	I was having a great time.
2594000	2598000	I could have done without all the other crap, sorry to say.
2598000	2600000	There was one other thing I wanted to say about DuckTales.
2600000	2604000	Oh, I will say this, and I know this has got to be unique to the Wii U.
2604000	2609000	I kind of think it was a lazy port, which shouldn't be a surprise whatsoever,
2609000	2613000	but speaking of sound design, there was no...
2613000	2617000	They did not sync up the sound coming out of the Wii U game pad
2617000	2619000	and the sound coming out of the TV.
2619000	2622000	So if you're sitting in front of the TV and you're playing it on the game pad
2622000	2626000	and the volume's up in the TV, you definitely hear a delay in the audio,
2626000	2628000	and it's really annoying.
2628000	2631000	There's a delay in the audio coming out of the game pad versus the TV
2631000	2636000	and in the music, so it's like everything's just the slightest bit off.
2636000	2638000	I had to mute the game pad.
2638000	2641000	I cannot play the game with sound on the game pad.
2641000	2645000	So that's a little bit annoying, because the Nintendo games don't have that problem.
2645000	2647000	They're all synced up just fine.
2647000	2652000	So I think that's just a lazy port problem, but it is what it is.
2652000	2656000	You know, I mean, I'm just saying overall in terms of the voices,
2656000	2659000	I didn't notice a problem at all on the PC.
2659000	2662000	So I might have to stream it when I'm playing through it
2662000	2664000	just to see if anything comes across.
2664000	2667000	It could also just be taste and maybe, you know,
2667000	2669000	not to say you don't have an ear for this dark soccer,
2669000	2672000	but having done audio editing for all these years doing the show,
2672000	2676000	I just can hear it, and I go, my God, where did they take this guy?
2676000	2677000	Because he sounds awful.
2677000	2681000	After the show, I'd like to hear yours, because I can tell you if there's a difference.
2681000	2685000	Okay. Sounds good. We'll arrange that.
2685000	2689000	Okey-dokey. That's it. That's all I wanted to say about my gaming week.
2689000	2692000	Everything else I played was too brief and nothing really new.
2692000	2695000	So let's get into housekeeping so we can get into news.
2695000	2697000	I want to talk about Dragon Con a little bit.
2697000	2700000	There's not going to be a show over Labor Day weekend.
2700000	2702000	I don't know if I should say this.
2702000	2705000	There may not be a show the week after either.
2705000	2708000	I didn't get a chance to tell you yet why. I'll tell you off air.
2708000	2713000	I will know next week, and it's something I can't control.
2713000	2717000	So I'll tell you off air why, but we'll talk about that later.
2717000	2720000	Dark Sakura and Loki may put something else together.
2720000	2723000	We have to figure all that out because I got something dropped on me.
2723000	2725000	I will know next week for sure.
2725000	2727000	You definitely will not be here Labor Day.
2727000	2730000	And the reason why I won't be here Labor Day weekend is because
2730000	2733000	I'm going to be at Dragon Con, which I'm really excited about.
2733000	2736000	I'm going to have a fun time. I'm sad Dark Sakura and Loki can't come with me,
2736000	2740000	but I'll have fun for the three of us at Dragon Con.
2740000	2743000	And if you want to come see me at Dragon Con,
2743000	2748000	probably the best time to do that would be to come to the VOG Super Show panel,
2748000	2753000	which is going to be Saturday night at 5.30 as part of the podcasting track.
2753000	2756000	So definitely come see that. Saturday night at 5.30 is the VOG Super Show.
2756000	2759000	Not just me, Bobby Black Wolf, Pod Culture.
2759000	2763000	Travis Donovan's going to be there. One of the Critical Myth guys is there.
2763000	2766000	I hope I'm not forgetting anybody.
2766000	2769000	So it'll be a whole bunch of us that do shows at VOG,
2769000	2774000	and possibly some surprises in store during that panel.
2774000	2775000	That's all I can say.
2775000	2777000	Like magical plane tickets for me.
2777000	2781000	Well, and you get a car, and you get a car. No, nothing like that.
2781000	2785000	If you miss me Saturday night, because, I don't know, there's something else going on,
2785000	2788000	a good time to find me would be Monday at 11.30.
2788000	2790000	There's a streaming podcast panel.
2790000	2793000	Bobby's going to be a part of that, so I will be there just to support.
2793000	2796000	And, you know, me too. I do a streaming podcast.
2796000	2799000	So I'll be there. That would be your second chance to see me.
2799000	2803000	But then I fly out of town Monday night, so if you don't see me Monday at 11.30,
2803000	2805000	you probably missed me. Just saying.
2805000	2809000	So I will remind you of that next week during the last show before Dragon Con.
2809000	2810000	Just saying.
2810000	2813000	Otherwise, friend us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
2813000	2817000	We're also on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2817000	2821000	Let's go to our news tonight.
2821000	2822000	Loki, why don't you start us off?
2822000	2823000	Alright.
2823000	2832000	So, there's been a lot of changes for the Xbox One for sure since the original announcement.
2832000	2837000	They're trying to fix what people didn't like.
2837000	2840000	And so here's another notch to add to that.
2840000	2848000	The Xbox One will no longer require the Kinect to be plugged in in order for the system to work.
2848000	2852000	That's right. You can play with the system unconnected from the Kinect.
2852000	2859000	However, if you're going to play a game that requires the Kinect, then obviously you have to plug it in.
2859000	2864000	But they are still including it in the box.
2864000	2873000	And right now, it's not something that they're going to be putting in a separate SKU or something without the Kinect.
2873000	2876000	So it's still going to be $4.99.
2876000	2879000	It still has the Kinect in the box.
2879000	2880000	Alright. And then the other thing.
2880000	2882000	Xbox One controllers.
2882000	2886000	I know I'm interested in getting one just for PC at the very least.
2886000	2892000	You can get one for PC, but the drivers aren't coming out until 2014.
2892000	2900000	And basically, as we've stated, the Xbox One controller, although it looks similar in many ways, shares no underlying technology with the current Xbox 360.
2900000	2910000	New wireless protocol combined with the ability to work in wired mode and additional features like impulse triggers, means software has to be written and optimized for the PC.
2910000	2918000	However, this week there was a big announcement for Call of Duty showing off the multiplayer.
2918000	2921000	And the game was being played on PC with Xbox One controllers.
2921000	2930000	So those dumb fucks have the drivers, but they're making excuses so that if you really want to play with that controller, you better buy an Xbox One.
2930000	2937000	Just playing devil's advocate, could they have been developed third party? Could it be a Joy to Key situation?
2937000	2946000	No, it's not because it was on a PC version of the game because they were able to go in the options and there was an enable gamepad option on there.
2946000	2950000	Why would you purposely delay the release of the drivers?
2950000	2961000	Because people then, oh I want to get the Xbox One experience with Call of Duty and Battlefield, I'm just going to buy the PC versions and I don't need to buy a next gen console for that.
2961000	2969000	So what they're trying to do is trying to get the sync in so all these people that really need to have that controller are going to buy, you know.
2970000	2977000	I would think you just pull, yank the 360 controllers off the market, well I guess you really can't do that when you're still selling the console.
2977000	2982000	Because I was going to say, for the PC people, make that not an option, they have to get the Xbox One.
2982000	2989000	It's not a huge deal because I mean, all you're really getting is those impulse control, the impulse triggers or whatever, so I guess they have to build that in.
2989000	2997000	But it's still kind of stupid, I don't know why they would do that, but whatever, you know, that's their decision then I guess I just won't buy another controller.
2997000	2999000	Not that I really need one anyways.
2999000	3003000	Are you getting the one at launch at this point? I didn't think you were.
3003000	3006000	I'm not planning on getting one at all at the moment.
3006000	3011000	And I'm still kind of on the fence with the PlayStation 4 just because of Grand Theft Auto 5.
3011000	3021000	Just because the launch lineup is not that strong, I mean there's a kill zone which looks cool, but it's not really a game I'm interested in.
3021000	3025000	Like I've played some of the other kill zone games and it's just not my thing.
3025000	3029000	If it was a Resistance game or something, that might be a whole different story because I'm a real big fan of Resistance.
3029000	3033000	But kill zone I'm not a huge fan of, Drive Club I'm kind of eh.
3033000	3037000	And NAC, I just really don't care about that.
3037000	3043000	Infamous looks great, so I'd definitely pick up Infamous next year, but I still might.
3043000	3047000	I still may pick one up just because I already have my pre-order in with Amazon.
3048000	3051000	We'll see, we'll see what they announce this week and stuff.
3051000	3053000	Maybe they'll announce that there's a packing game or something like that.
3053000	3055000	That might sweeten the deal a little bit.
3055000	3060000	GameGuru also has a good point in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com when it comes to this Call of Duty ghosts and all this.
3060000	3063000	GameGuru says people could just stick with a 360 controller.
3063000	3064000	That's true, you could.
3064000	3070000	So that would seem really ridiculous that they would hold back the drivers for that reason you're saying.
3070000	3074000	Because if somebody really wants to have a console experience on a PC or whatever,
3074000	3078000	If you really want to play controller on the PC, then just yeah, use the 360 controller.
3078000	3082000	Exactly, but my point is, so they have the drivers available, so their reasoning behind it is,
3082000	3087000	Oh, we have to develop new drivers is a bunch of bullshit because those drivers are available.
3087000	3092000	And yes, I can understand if it was running on an Xbox One dev kit that happened to be a PC.
3092000	3098000	Okay, I understand that that's a little different, but this was a PC version of the game because they saw the PC options in there.
3098000	3103000	And, you know, maybe it's a PC version of the game that they're gonna port to the Xbox One.
3103000	3108000	I have no fucking clue, but the drivers do exist in some form, whether it be developer only or whatever.
3108000	3113000	But it's not that hard to develop drivers for a controller. I mean, come on.
3113000	3115000	Yeah, it wouldn't seem like it's that.
3115000	3119000	I would think if anything, I'm thinking probably you'd see a third party solution from some hackers.
3119000	3122000	Is there gonna be a USB plugged in version?
3122000	3126000	Well, that's the thing. The controller has a battery pack that you can put in there.
3126000	3132000	And when you plug it in, it shuts off the radio for the wireless. So it acts like a wired controller.
3132000	3133000	This is like a PlayStation 3 controller.
3133000	3135000	Yeah. Okay. Sort of. Yeah.
3135000	3137000	Sort of. Okay.
3137000	3142000	All right. Well, speaking of Xbox One, some changes with the launch of the Xbox One.
3142000	3150000	And that is certain countries kind of got screwed with the launch because Xbox One was originally going to launch in 21 different countries.
3150000	3161000	However, Microsoft in a blog post said that goal was too aggressive and that Xbox One will only be available in 13 territories this November.
3161000	3167000	So Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Sweden, Switzerland, you got screwed.
3167000	3170000	So you will get the console in 2014 instead.
3170000	3173000	You know what? Russia earned it.
3173000	3177000	That's a whole nother Oprah.
3177000	3179000	Being dickish.
3179000	3184000	Bad chip yields is what has that they can't make enough to cover all those countries.
3184000	3190000	Maybe they're just trying to fortify their position in the countries that they know that they can do well in.
3190000	3192000	But it's still kind of lame.
3192000	3195000	I mean, I understand why they're doing it.
3195000	3201000	But at the same time, you know, especially like I would it's I'm surprised that they're not trying to make more headway in Japan.
3201000	3203000	They just like.
3203000	3206000	Oh, they we've written it up. They have written off Japan.
3206000	3208000	Literally, you know, for the Xbox 360.
3208000	3210000	We're definitely not going to try any harder.
3210000	3214000	Maybe maybe I shouldn't say that because they are supposed to be doing Tokyo Game Show.
3214000	3217000	They're trying to build buzz somehow over there.
3217000	3220000	And who knows what they're keeping in their hat to show at Tokyo Game Show.
3220000	3228000	You know, that maybe would be something, you know, you never know what type of studio they pulled together to create a very, you know, Japanese RPG or something.
3228000	3234000	Although I guess they tried that on 360 and it didn't totally pan out, although I loved Lost Odyssey.
3234000	3237000	That was a hugely neglected 360 game.
3237000	3239000	That is amazing if you love JRPGs.
3239000	3242000	But then Blue Dragon was kind of well, it had its fans.
3242000	3244000	Jamie loved it. I thought it was.
3244000	3247000	I was high on Vicodin, Rob.
3247000	3251000	I mean, it was cool, you know, and I always like Toriyama's art style.
3251000	3254000	I mean, dude designed Chrono Trigger.
3254000	3258000	But anyway, my point is, you don't know what they're what rabbit they're going to pull out of their hat at Tokyo Game Show.
3258000	3262000	So maybe I shouldn't say they've written off Japan, but it sure feels like it sometimes.
3262000	3264000	IkumaJP says we don't care.
3264000	3272000	And well, and you guys clearly have shown that through the Xbox 360, which, you know, fair is fair.
3272000	3276000	Anyhow, just quickly, these are the territories that will get Xbox One.
3276000	3283000	Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Spain, United Kingdom, United States, New Zealand.
3283000	3287000	I'm glad Germany's on there because that'd be really awkward to make an announcement.
3288000	3291000	Hey, this console will be launching this year.
3291000	3293000	Oh, wait. No, not for you guys.
3295000	3299000	All right. Anyhow, going on to Xbox One.
3299000	3304000	Now, here's the thing that well, let's assume it wasn't coming out in Germany for whatever reason and might actually be OK.
3304000	3306000	And these countries that want one bad enough.
3306000	3311000	Guess what? The Xbox One games are no longer going to be region locked.
3311000	3313000	Sorry.
3313000	3316000	The Xbox One games will not be region locked.
3316000	3324000	So in an interview with Eurogamer, Xbox One, they said when the console launches this November, we will support the Xbox One in 13 markets.
3324000	3329000	Xbox One may be used in all countries, including the non-launched markets.
3329000	3333000	In addition, Xbox One games are not region locked.
3333000	3338000	Any Xbox One game purchases retail can be used in any country on any Xbox.
3338000	3342000	That was that was part of their original 180 flip thing that that was going to happen.
3343000	3355000	Well, clarify that, you know, even with this change in the 13 lineups, if you live in one of the eight affected countries, you could get around it and still have a good experience with Xbox One.
3355000	3359000	So this is good, though.
3359000	3362000	Yeah, I'm glad that I'm glad everybody's going region free.
3362000	3367000	I mean, this is the obvious answer. Who's still region locked? Only Nintendo at this point.
3368000	3370000	Tis tusk.
3370000	3374000	And the sad thing was, they were sort of on region locked.
3374000	3376000	Yeah, they were going that way.
3376000	3381000	Yes, they're like, I think maybe the 3DS is because they couldn't really figure out their marketplace too well.
3381000	3386000	And so, you know, they didn't know how to, I guess, make the purchase in the region free or something.
3386000	3389000	And so because of that, that might be why it's locked down.
3389000	3391000	I don't know. Maybe because of piracy.
3391000	3395000	But it's whatever.
3395000	3399000	All right, well, lots and lots of Xbox One news this week.
3399000	3407000	And a lot of folks going, it's Xbox 180, Xbox reverse and course, which, you know, I am impressed that they are doing this.
3407000	3411000	And there's even more to come, I think. Well, no, I guess you...
3411000	3414000	Was there more later? I thought we had one more Xbox story.
3414000	3421000	Well, anyway, just by everything you're saying about, you know, the Kinect and the controllers and, you know, the region locking and all that stuff.
3421000	3425000	You know, Xbox is giving people what they wanted and it's kind of impressive.
3425000	3428000	I thought originally after E3 it wasn't going to happen this fast.
3428000	3432000	Let's not forget, Don Mattrick's not running things anymore either.
3432000	3436000	So there's definitely been a change in how things are being run.
3436000	3443000	And whether that's coming, you know, at his former level or a higher level, who knows.
3444000	3452000	So, yeah, and I'm not sure how much more they're going to really be able to do, like, especially with like the price and, you know, doing a SKU without Kinect to drop the price.
3452000	3459000	I don't think that's going to happen because the whole point of having Kinect in there is they want to make sure that all the developers are going to be utilizing it.
3459000	3468000	And if you take that out, then it's going to basically it's just going to make it pointless because you're going to have stuff not utilizing it.
3468000	3471000	But at the same time, though, I don't think they utilize it that well.
3471000	3475000	I mean, hell, all the games they showed at E3 didn't use Kinect.
3475000	3479000	I mean, they may have supported it, but they sure as hell didn't demonstrate Kinect.
3479000	3488000	The one thing I liked most about Kinect was the whole people calling each other to talk during TV shows, which I know is a really weird feature to like.
3488000	3494000	But I thought that was kind of cool and something I could actually see myself utilizing, depending on the show and depending on the person.
3495000	3502000	So I like that. And knowing that all the Xbox One users will have one will make it so that more there's more people available to call or whatever.
3502000	3503000	Do you have an iPhone?
3503000	3504000	Yes.
3504000	3506000	Do you know people have an Android phone?
3506000	3507000	Yes.
3507000	3509000	You know, those have Skype on them.
3509000	3510000	They do.
3510000	3511000	And they're free.
3511000	3514000	There's something about having it right there on the TV, though. I don't know.
3515000	3523000	You know, you have a point, but the tablet stuff can be weird sometimes because the camera's, you know, pointing and I'm trying to watch a show, you know.
3523000	3526000	How many people do you actually FaceTime with?
3526000	3527000	No one.
3527000	3530000	Yeah, there's like two people I ever call on FaceTime.
3530000	3531000	My mom.
3531000	3532000	Yeah. Do you really?
3532000	3538000	When my mom got her iPhone, because it was given to her, she's like, I need to learn everything on this, so you better.
3538000	3540000	I was like, Mom, do you know what FaceTime is?
3540000	3541000	What's that?
3541000	3543000	So we FaceTime from time to time.
3543000	3551000	I just, I mean, it sounds like a cool feature, but at the same time, it was like, hey, Twitter and Facebook sound like cool features on the Xbox 360.
3551000	3557000	I can check my Twitter feed and my Facebook, and then, no. It's just, it's not.
3557000	3566000	All right, Game Guru in Chat says, it is rather admirable that Microsoft is actually reversing their horrible, horrible idea, though they never should have had it in the first place.
3567000	3578000	I'll tell you what, though, having, you know, tried streaming this week and stuff, I am definitely looking forward to the console, you know, recording and streaming functionality of both consoles, so I think that's pretty awesome.
3578000	3584000	It's just, you know, I don't know, just anything to make it easier would be fantastic.
3584000	3586000	All right, let's move on to another article.
3586000	3590000	All right, well, I don't know how people are going to feel.
3590000	3597000	So for anyone who has been looking into Xenoblade Chronicles, of course, it's an exclusive at GameStop.
3597000	3601000	Well, they are pretty much defending how much they're charging for it.
3601000	3612000	Basically, it's 90 bucks, and when they were contacted, they said that they use feedback from their PowerUp members to see what titles they want to bring back.
3612000	3622000	And, you know, talking about Xenoblade Chronicles, and that they basically were saying that the price is competitive, it's based on market value, and people will pay it.
3622000	3628000	And then they say, and then they say, but our PowerUp Pro members always receive a 10% discount, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
3628000	3634000	So they're basically like, we can charge it, screw you, pretty much.
3634000	3638000	I mean, I don't work for GameStop, but I'm saying, that's what it sounds like.
3639000	3645000	You know what's funny is last week, we were talking about something else related to this whole thing, and I said, I even said in joking,
3645000	3648000	oh, the good news is all these copies of Xenoblade are going back to GameStop.
3648000	3657000	I did not realize that it was under this fucking, this outrageous pricing scheme that they're giving to us.
3657000	3658000	It's ridiculous.
3658000	3669000	I can understand that there's an actual shortage on the game and stuff, and that it's rare, and that maybe the, you know, I know eBay people might be charging more money for, you know, used copies of it because it's harder to find now.
3669000	3676000	But they fucking reprinted this shit, opened them up, and they're selling them as used, and like, look at all these rare copies.
3676000	3677000	For 90 bucks.
3677000	3678000	Yes, for $90.
3678000	3684000	And all of a sudden, you know, all of a sudden, all of the stores happen to have copies of it.
3684000	3695000	Yeah, that's very coincidental that all of a sudden, all the stores have copies, and they're used copies that happen to also still have unredeemed, was it Nintendo Club codes in there.
3695000	3698000	Oh, that's so, so convenient.
3698000	3713000	I'm gonna say something that I'm probably gonna regret saying, but this is my honest-to-God reaction when I hear this stuff, and maybe this is just the, you know, I don't know, the Les Miserables revolution person in me or whatever.
3713000	3717000	But honest-to-God, Xenoblade is a, exactly, right?
3717000	3722000	Xenoblade is a great game, and you should pirate it so you can play it.
3722000	3723000	That is what I'm gonna say.
3723000	3726000	You should pirate Xenoblade so you can play this game because it's great.
3726000	3730000	And it's, there's instructions on how to mod your Wii out there.
3730000	3735000	It was on a bunch of sites when the game was only out in the UK, but you know what?
3735000	3740000	Nintendo restricting its release to only, you know, GameStop, and they no longer sell it on their shop.
3740000	3745000	If Nintendo was selling it on their shop, I'd say, oh great, you should definitely support it by going to buy this game on Nintendo.
3745000	3752000	But if this is what they're gonna let happen, Nintendo is letting this happen, you should go pirate the game.
3752000	3755000	And hey, here's a thought too, by the way.
3755000	3759000	Look at what happens when you have one place that sells a game that everybody likes.
3759000	3761000	Only one place.
3762000	3768000	Hello? Microsoft, you know, was trying to do the same shit, what, not too long ago with the Xbox One,
3768000	3774000	that there was only gonna be one place that you'd be able to basically take back your games and stuff?
3775000	3777000	They're gonna limit who can actually sell those games?
3777000	3780000	You really think they're gonna come down in price, like Steam?
3780000	3783000	Ha ha ha! That's very funny.
3784000	3787000	Bobby in our chatroom says, I rented it via Gamefly.
3787000	3792000	That's a great solution. Probably a better one than I suggested, quite honestly.
3792000	3797000	But as much as you may think I'm terrible for what I said or whatever, I mean,
3797000	3798000	I don't think you're terrible.
3798000	3804000	The reality is, when you see stuff like this happen, that's why piracy is happening.
3804000	3808000	Ninety dollars for this game that should not be this cra-
3808000	3814000	That one company is essentially controlling price fixing, they are price fixing this game.
3814000	3815000	Yeah.
3815000	3816000	It's ridiculous.
3816000	3821000	You know what? There's limited copies out there, and if they want more copies,
3821000	3824000	they go print more copies of the game and they sell them.
3824000	3830000	But now, what they've done is they're going back and reprinting it, because you guys demanded it.
3830000	3832000	We're gonna reprint it.
3832000	3835000	Yes, I don't think the fans demanded that you charge ninety dollars for it either.
3836000	3842000	Do you know what they ought to do, is they ought to just release it on the Wii U download shop.
3843000	3844000	Yeah.
3844000	3849000	And then I would say, go ye forth and download this game, it's great and you should play it.
3850000	3854000	That would be a great, that would be a great thing for them to do.
3856000	3861000	You know what though, it's the same thing that people were fessing at people for, for going out.
3861000	3865000	I mean, it's why Target and places like that were restricting the number of Wii's people could buy,
3865000	3870000	because they knew that they were a limited number, and they were gonna go on eBay and charge a bajillion for it,
3870000	3874000	which would, you know, hurt their chances later on of actually selling the system for retail price.
3875000	3878000	Fifth Dream in chat says, oh it's a Wii game, who gives a fuck?
3878000	3880000	Because honestly, it's great. It really is.
3880000	3881000	I give a fuck.
3881000	3884000	Yeah, it's, you are missing out not playing it.
3884000	3893000	I think when I originally reviewed the game, I said it was, it's the greatest PlayStation 2 Japanese RPG you'll play on a Nintendo Wii.
3894000	3899000	Cause that's kinda what it is, but it's, you know, just because it's on the Wii doesn't make it a bad game.
3900000	3907000	Well, I still, I wouldn't pay 90 bucks for, I've paid 90 bucks for games, but usually they were new imports.
3908000	3915000	Just think what'll happen if they ever print, you know, Mother 3 and bring it over here and it's a GameStop exclusive,
3915000	3921000	and then, oh hey, we sold out of our initial copies, oh you want that again? That'll be $150.
3922000	3926000	Alright, before I say something else that's gonna get me in trouble, let's go on to another news story. Lowkey.
3926000	3931000	Alright, so Sony's got some news that they're gonna be unveiling this week at Gamescom,
3931000	3938000	and that news is rumored to be their plans for, or the release plans for the PlayStation 4.
3938000	3942000	And those are gonna be shared on August 20th during their conference.
3942000	3952000	They're emphasizing that they're gonna have a, or I guess they're gonna have a brief announcement regarding the release plans for the PlayStation 4.
3952000	3956000	And also, I guess Microsoft's supposed to have some sort of announcement as well,
3956000	3961000	though they're saying that their conference is really short in emphasizing on developers and their games.
3961000	3966000	Yeah, I think it's basically really short because that news that they were supposed to be unveiling about the, you know,
3966000	3970000	Xbox One systems being dev kits and stuff like that, that already got leaked out.
3970000	3975000	So, they don't have anything to talk about anymore, so that's kind of unfortunate.
3975000	3980000	But, I'm interested to see what both parties have to say.
3980000	3987000	Well, I'm also interested to see what release date they're gonna give the PlayStation 4. That's gonna come out this week, right?
3987000	3991000	Probably November. Everything's November. I'd be surprised if it's October.
3991000	3993000	A lot of rumors pointing to October for some reason.
3993000	3995000	They're trying to get a jump.
3995000	4005000	Originally, I thought October because there were some placeholder dates that I had from a third party that were the same day as other games,
4005000	4011000	but it ended up they were just copy pasta, their own information.
4011000	4017000	It's like, hey, your UPCs are the same too. You might want to change all that stuff.
4017000	4021000	Are we expecting any other big, big news out of Gamescom this week from anybody else?
4021000	4024000	There might be some more game announcements from Microsoft.
4024000	4029000	I know everyone's expecting maybe like a Crackdown 3 or something like that.
4030000	4035000	Although, Saints Row 4 is coming out the same day, so there's your Crackdown 3.
4038000	4042000	Crackdown 3 would be slightly interesting. If it was a launch-style, that would be even more interesting.
4042000	4046000	What's the free game on 360 now? Because Crackdown was the first half of the month, right?
4046000	4049000	Dead Rising 2 and Dead Rising Case 0.
4049000	4051000	Oh, I'm gonna have to pick that up.
4051000	4057000	Yeah, I put it in my queue. I've been putting everything in my queue, except for that last Xbox Live Arcade game, because I don't give a shit about that.
4058000	4064000	But I've been just putting it all in my queue, but I don't know, they're okay.
4064000	4067000	It's just at the same time, it's not exactly like PlayStation Plus.
4067000	4073000	I did put Hitman Absolution. The problem, and this just goes back to the whole digital download thing,
4073000	4079000	it's a 17-gig download for Hitman, because it's PlayStation 3.
4079000	4081000	Sure, yeah, it's a Blu-ray disc.
4082000	4089000	And my network timed out in the middle of the download, because it was a few hours, even though I have pretty fast internet.
4089000	4094000	Do you have PlayStation Plus, because you're downloading the game, can't you just trigger it to start downloading,
4094000	4098000	and then turn off your PlayStation and let it download overnight when it does the...
4098000	4100000	Because any outstanding downloads will download overnight.
4100000	4105000	Yeah, I could. I just downloaded most of it. I'm sure it would resume it, but it's just, you know...
4106000	4110000	It's annoying. I just wanted it on my queue. I'm probably not gonna actually play that right away.
4111000	4115000	All right, well, something we may hear about at Gamescom, although probably not, it'll probably come out later,
4115000	4121000	but there's some of these rumors about the Sony PlayStation 4 and a TV service that they're apparently building.
4121000	4126000	Now, we kind of knew, like, they were getting, you know, into some TV things from the earlier press conference,
4126000	4129000	but, you know, now it's really starting to gel together what this might actually be,
4129000	4132000	and it looks like it's gonna be some type of paid TV service.
4132000	4135000	I would have thought it would have been an enhancement to PlayStation Plus.
4135000	4136000	Maybe it still is.
4136000	4140000	God, I hope. If it's free TV and PlayStation Plus, fuck yeah.
4140000	4144000	You would think that they would sweeten the pot with that, but I don't know, maybe not.
4144000	4151000	But anyway, it's according to our report in the Wall Street Journal, because Sony made a big deal with Viacom.
4151000	4155000	Viacom is a huge media company, what, they own CBS, don't they?
4155000	4164000	And Paramount and all these companies, to carry Viacom cable channels on an internet-based service for Sony products.
4164000	4168000	So you will be able to get Viacom cable channels, which is MTV and that stuff, right?
4168000	4173000	MTV Comedy Central, VH1, I don't remember what else they have.
4173000	4181000	So, assumably, you will be able to get these channels through your PlayStation 3 and essentially bypass your cable box.
4181000	4184000	You know what?
4184000	4186000	I don't see how the cable companies are gonna let that fly.
4186000	4193000	It's Viacom, though. Viacom, you know, they're higher up than the cable companies, so I can see how they can let that fly.
4193000	4199000	It's just interesting to me. Well, I mean, we've seen throughout this whole mess of, what is it, Time Warner and CBS,
4199000	4202000	that cable companies will block, you know, whatever they want.
4202000	4206000	So I'm kind of surprised that they're gonna be able to get away with this.
4206000	4211000	Yeah, but they can block it on their own, like, as far as, you know, negotiating with, you know, other companies.
4211000	4214000	They can block it on their own service, but they can't really block it off the internet.
4214000	4219000	There's so many people that are ditching cable TV in favor of Netflix and Hulu.
4219000	4221000	Yeah, we'll just start raising internet prices.
4221000	4224000	Yeah, you're right. Probably. Probably.
4224000	4227000	It's costing us a lot more to expand our network.
4227000	4230000	Brandon, we gotta put these bandwidth caps on, because bandwidth is super expensive.
4230000	4234000	But also keep in mind how many people do you know who have ditched their landline for their cell phone.
4234000	4236000	True.
4236000	4237000	So it's more the same thing.
4237000	4239000	True, and AT&T's still kicking, right?
4239000	4240000	Yeah.
4240000	4243000	They're still putting out that blazing fast DSL.
4243000	4246000	I'm sorry. No, that's not.
4246000	4251000	Sony also to do on-demand programming and cable channels online.
4251000	4259000	There'll be a recommended programming feature that will be influenced by content providers and an algorithm of what you've been watching.
4259000	4261000	So, interesting.
4261000	4264000	June 26th, it should be noted. My birthday.
4264000	4269000	Sony renewed a trademark for PlayStation TV, likely to be the final name of this.
4269000	4272000	So who knows who might see more on this at Gamescom.
4272000	4279000	Even though they just inked this deal the other day, Apple is notorious for inking deals the night before they make an announcement.
4279000	4287000	So you could see something, but it may be a rabbit in their hat they keep till later when we have more of what that's really gonna be.
4287000	4292000	I am really curious to see how Comcast, Time Warner, reacts to this.
4292000	4294000	Be interesting.
4297000	4301000	Gameguru in chat says Viacom doesn't care. They're the guys who own CBS.
4301000	4307000	Oh yeah, Viacom is probably really excited about this because fuck Time Warner at this point.
4307000	4314000	If they can get CBS on PlayStation boxes, I mean, this is a dream for them if Sony's giving them what they want.
4314000	4321000	I mean, this is a huge piece in their favor as far as Viacom's concerned.
4321000	4326000	Yeah, you're just bypassing the whole, you know, because now you can get your, you know, you bypass everything.
4327000	4332000	Now, an interesting point, I've seen this on Twitters and so forth, so this is worth discussing.
4332000	4339000	BlackWolf says TV, TV, TV, TV. Microsoft talks TV equals, Microsoft doesn't know what they're doing, how lame.
4339000	4342000	Sony talks TV equals, this is awesome.
4342000	4347000	Okay, well there's a little difference between having an IPTV service that you have going through your game console
4347000	4355000	and plugging in a video in through your goddamn console just to, you know, you can watch TV on the Xbox One.
4355000	4361000	You can watch TV on your TV. Basically, they're saying, hey look, we have this wonderful feature that has been featured on
4361000	4369000	almost all devices since a VCR where you have a video in and then you can watch TV on your device.
4369000	4376000	All they're doing, what functionality are they really adding to my, so I basically still need a cable box.
4376000	4381000	It's just my cable box is now running through my Xbox One. That's my problem.
4381000	4385000	It was like, hey, here's this brand new TV service that Microsoft's putting out.
4385000	4391000	You can access it through, you know, the Xbox 360 or the Xbox One. You don't need a cable box.
4391000	4394000	That's a little different. That's my problem.
4394000	4399000	That and their unveil of the console, they focus strictly on a lot of the entertainment things,
4399000	4403000	which people are like, come on, I want to know about games because this is a gaming console type thing.
4404000	4410000	I think too, it's not that I necessarily dislike what Microsoft is doing, and also to be fair,
4410000	4414000	it's not like this news made me drop down the money to get a PlayStation 4.
4414000	4418000	I had made that decision long before it, but when I hear about this enhanced value, of course I get excited.
4418000	4423000	But it is all rumor. It may pan out to be nothing. And if it costs too much, I won't do it.
4423000	4429000	And if Sony talks all about TV during their Gamescom, you know, announcements and stuff, that might be a little boring.
4429000	4432000	And yeah, people would, I'd still rag on about that.
4432000	4436000	Like, okay, that's cool that you have this TV service coming, but I kind of want to know about your games.
4436000	4440000	Oh, unless they announce the tester season four. I can't wait. I can't wait.
4440000	4442000	Oh, Rob.
4442000	4444000	Dark Soccer, will you go on tester season four?
4444000	4445000	No.
4445000	4448000	Because I remember we tried to get her to go on season three.
4448000	4452000	No, they wouldn't want me anyway. I'm too bitchy.
4452000	4456000	No, they would absolutely want you for being bitchy.
4456000	4459000	I would lay the smack down on everybody and go, you know what?
4459000	4466000	I remember when the only access we had to Sony and video games was when they made the Super Nintendo sound processor.
4466000	4468000	And some limited games.
4468000	4471000	And, well, you know how PlayStation started, right?
4471000	4474000	It was supposed to be the whole CD expansion for Super Nintendo, right?
4474000	4476000	Indeed.
4476000	4479000	All right. Anyhow, let's move on.
4479000	4481000	Dark Soccer, one more story before release dates.
4481000	4485000	I was putting out my friend code. I'm putting myself out.
4486000	4494000	Well, some people may or may not be happy about this, but the games for Windows Live Marketplace is closing on August 22nd.
4494000	4499000	Which is pretty much next week.
4499000	4512000	So, anyway, they put out an FAQ on Xbox.com so that for people who have purchased games on Windows Live and their DLC, they'll still be able to play them, but they won't be able to purchase additional content.
4512000	4518000	And, basically, they're afraid that...
4518000	4521000	There's people who are afraid that they're going to be pulling the games out of Steam as well.
4521000	4524000	But, as far as that, I don't really see anything about that.
4524000	4527000	They said that the games that are on Steam are still going to be on Steam.
4527000	4531000	It's just that the Microsoft points are going bye-bye, you know, which we already knew.
4531000	4537000	I think it's just because they're putting everything on their Windows Marketplace now and no point in having two different Marketplaces.
4537000	4541000	They're putting everything out on their Inconvenience Marketplace.
4541000	4548000	Oh my God, you know, the games for Windows Marketplace, my only Marketplace I buy games, said no one ever.
4548000	4557000	Exactly. It's just, for the people who have bought things through there, they're really inconveniencing their consumers.
4557000	4561000	There was a free game you got when you signed up for games for Windows Live that had achievements in it.
4561000	4564000	I remember that's why I got it.
4564000	4566000	Tinker or something like that was the game.
4566000	4567000	Oh, Rob.
4567000	4569000	I don't remember.
4569000	4571000	Some have achievements in like Solitaire now.
4571000	4580000	And, I mean, it's kind of a big thing. I mean, yeah, they're definitely working on getting all their stuff ready for the X-Bone.
4580000	4586000	But, in the end, nobody could see me shrug, but that's all I can say is shrug.
4586000	4594000	And I shed another tear for my Microsoft Game Room, which was a part of games for Windows Live.
4594000	4601000	So, if you have that, my assumption is that you won't be able to buy the packs anymore because that was all integrated through games for Windows Live.
4601000	4606000	Although, shit, that game's pretty much long gone if you don't have what you wanted out of that.
4606000	4608000	I haven't gotten a single thing on that.
4608000	4611000	I actually had a lot. I had like 15 games.
4611000	4616000	Why do you think I was so mad when they pulled the plug on it too soon?
4616000	4617000	Anyway.
4617000	4622000	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and out with the old, in with the new, I suppose.
4622000	4625000	Yes. This week's actually quite a bit of stuff coming out.
4625000	4630000	It's kind of a little bit of a kickoff for the fourth quarter, which is creeping up earlier every year.
4630000	4636000	So, this week, Saints Row IV on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
4636000	4643000	Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Blacklist on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii U, and PC.
4644000	4653000	We also have The Walking Dead Complete First Season on the Vita, and it has the additional DLC in there as well.
4653000	4659000	New Super Luigi U for the Wii U, and that's the physical disc version of that.
4659000	4668000	Also, the Bureau XCOM Declassified on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
4669000	4674000	And this isn't a game, but I still think it's interesting.
4674000	4680000	The Game Stick, the second Android console, is finally making its way out.
4680000	4684000	So, they're going to have that and the dock as well available for that.
4684000	4686000	And then $79.99.
4686000	4688000	Ooh, undercutting the Ouya.
4688000	4690000	Yeah.
4690000	4692000	Alright, we'll see how that goes.
4693000	4697000	On the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan, Disorder 6 in regular and limited edition.
4697000	4702000	Dungeons & Dragons Mysteria is out this week as well, which we've talked about before on the show.
4702000	4705000	The disc release, even though there's the download release too.
4705000	4709000	Medal of Honor Warfighter gets a price reduction as it moves into the best hits.
4709000	4717000	And also out this week, Super Robot Taisen OG Saga, Maso Kishin 3, Pride of Justice comes out on the PlayStation 3.
4718000	4723000	On the Xbox 360, because yes, there are still a few things here and there on the 360 in Japan.
4723000	4725000	Disorder 6 in its regular and limited edition.
4725000	4730000	And Medal of Honor Warfighter gets that same price reduction on the 360 as well.
4730000	4735000	Moving to the handhelds on the PlayStation Vita this week, Super Robot Taisen OG Saga.
4735000	4739000	That same game I mentioned before is out on the Vita as well.
4739000	4747000	Conception 2, Sichise no Michibiki to Mazuru no Akumu comes out this week as well.
4747000	4749000	I want to know what this is about. Let's see.
4749000	4751000	Conception 2...
4751000	4756000	Sichise 7 World something.
4756000	4758000	Trying to see what kind of game it is.
4758000	4762000	Looks like it might be like a tactical RPG-ish type of thing.
4762000	4764000	I've seen that design somewhere.
4764000	4765000	Yeah.
4765000	4766000	Let me look at the name again.
4766000	4767000	Sure.
4767000	4769000	Well, here's the box art if you want to see it.
4769000	4771000	Well, yeah, but I can't. That's 7 something.
4771000	4772000	God damn it.
4773000	4775000	This is great radio. There it is. Here it is.
4775000	4779000	7th World something and I don't know.
4781000	4782000	Well, there you go.
4782000	4783000	Akumu, translate for us, please. We love you.
4783000	4786000	Help. Alright. Quickly, quickly.
4786000	4787000	Akumu-san is our hero.
4787000	4796000	On the Wii U this week. Yes, the Wii U sees a release in the Wonderful 101, which is out in Japan on August the 24th, which I believe is the same day it's out here, right?
4796000	4797000	That's very soon.
4797000	4808000	And lastly on the 3DS, that same Conception 2 game, as well as Nanami to Ishio ni Gabuko English Jotsatsu no Kutsu comes out.
4808000	4810000	Oh, I think that's an English teacher.
4810000	4811000	Which I'm assuming is up. Yeah.
4811000	4813000	Let's learn English with cute anime girls.
4814000	4816000	No, learn with Nanami.
4816000	4817000	Oh.
4817000	4818000	Hold on. Go back to the title.
4818000	4821000	Well, Nanami is missing her belly button on her...
4821000	4822000	No, she has her belly button. We can see it.
4822000	4823000	On her shirt.
4823000	4826000	Yeah, it's like a study with Nanami.
4826000	4830000	And Nanami also is showing a little cleavage.
4830000	4835000	He said you need to link that other game to chat so that Akumu-san can translate for us.
4835000	4839000	Alright, I will work on that while you travel to the UK.
4839000	4849000	I wish. On the 20th, Disney Infinity for Damn Near Everything. On the 22nd, we have Skullgirls for PC. I want that game.
4850000	4856000	Splinter Cell Blacklist for Wii U. On the 23rd, Saints Row 4, X-Com, X-Com, X-Com, no.
4856000	4861000	The Wonderful 101, which would be my reason for getting a Wii U, and Splinter Cell Blacklist.
4861000	4864000	Rob, if you get Wonderful 101, I'm just gonna move into your living room.
4864000	4868000	They have a demo available on Wii U. I've downloaded it, but I've not played it yet.
4868000	4870000	I need to see it.
4870000	4874000	Well, maybe after, well, I gotta go get Alan, so maybe during the week.
4874000	4876000	Wonderful.
4876000	4877000	You better do it for him out of town.
4877000	4878000	Alan can walk.
4880000	4881000	Hard, hard, hard, hard.
4881000	4883000	If he's listening, he's gonna cut you.
4883000	4885000	Alan, I was joking. Don't cut me.
4886000	4889000	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.
4889000	4891000	But first, Loki.
4894000	4896000	Loki? Hello?
4896000	4898000	Sorry, I was listening to a Nero song.
4898000	4899000	Anyways.
4899000	4901000	Wait, no. What is more important than this show?
4901000	4903000	Nero song?
4903000	4909000	Let's talk Call of Duty. Actually, I did watch the Call of Duty multiplayer preview thing that they did.
4909000	4911000	It looks kinda cool.
4911000	4915000	It was interesting. They did some new stuff with it.
4915000	4919000	Like, for example, they have now more character creation in there.
4919000	4927000	You can actually customize the way your character looks, and the big thing is that they added female soldiers in the game now.
4927000	4928000	Big deal.
4928000	4938000	One of the other things, though, that they mentioned that they're gonna basically allow you to take your profiles and your DLC from current gen to next gen.
4938000	4945000	Now, the profile thing is not a huge deal because that's kinda linked with your Call of Duty elite stuff, so that's kinda cross-platform as it is.
4945000	4947000	But the DLC thing's kinda neat.
4947000	4954000	So basically, if you buy a season pass or whatever on Xbox 360, you'll be able to take it to Xbox One.
4954000	4956000	Same with the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4.
4958000	4961000	And that's not just limited to Call of Duty as well.
4961000	4964000	It's also something that Battlefield 4 will have as well.
4964000	4976000	So you can do a one-time transfer between the Xbox 360 and Xbox One and PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 for your stats, unlocks, ranks, award assignments, and that kind of thing.
4976000	4989000	It's kinda lame, though, that it's a one-time deal for Battlefield 4, because what if I have an Xbox 360 at my work and an Xbox One at home and stuff, and I wanna play on both?
4989000	4993000	Why limit that? I don't know why, but that's something that they're supporting.
4993000	5004000	And if I guess the Xbox One's saying they're supporting the season pass guarantee, that this is gonna apply for a lot of different things, including, well, they had mentioned Call of Duty Ghosts and Battlefield 4.
5004000	5010000	I'm wondering if it's other games as well. They're gonna have some sort of tie in there.
5013000	5018000	Do you think a lot of people will be using this, or do you think people will just kinda already be upgrading or not?
5018000	5025000	As much as I go, oh, yay, this is a neat idea, I kinda think to myself, well, God, you have to buy the games twice? How many people are really gonna do that?
5025000	5034000	There might be some people that'll do that. I think what's gonna basically be is if, you know, say I wanna buy Call of Duty this year, and I'm not buying a next-gen system,
5034000	5042000	and then next year, I wanna, okay, we'll say mid next year, I wanna buy a PlayStation 4 or something like that.
5042000	5052000	If I buy it on PlayStation 3, I can buy the season pass, like I'll do that, buy the season pass, and then, you know, I buy my new system, and I now have to buy the season pass again.
5052000	5060000	I don't understand why it's such a big deal in the first place, because they do a lot of cross-buy stuff already on the PlayStation Network.
5060000	5066000	I mean, I think this would be more news for Microsoft, because they don't really do any of that cross-buy stuff.
5067000	5081000	So, I don't know. I guess it's a cool feature, but it's something that I think should be kind of expected, instead of having to buy the content more than once.
5081000	5086000	But, whatever, I mean, I guess that's cool if they're doing that.
5086000	5089000	I guess we live in a day and age where they didn't have to.
5089000	5101000	Yeah, it's one of those things now, and I was just gonna check here real quick to see if we have a story later on about, uh, yeah, I guess we do later on.
5101000	5114000	But, you know, a lot of this nowadays, they're talking about features that, I mean, necessarily, they're already there, but you may not be completely familiar with them, or you may have forgotten that they have them there, and now they're new.
5114000	5122000	Yeah, it's like, you know, this whole, uh, what was it with the Xbox? There was just something recently.
5122000	5124000	There was something coming up in Part B.
5124000	5131000	Yeah, I guess. No, no, it wasn't that. It wasn't that one. It was, um, the game sharing thing. Remember we talked about it last week?
5131000	5133000	Oh, yeah. Yes, you ranted about that last week.
5133000	5140000	Yes, that's not a new thing, but it's something that a lot of people don't really think about, or maybe, you know, they can spin it in a way that makes it a feature.
5140000	5141000	It might be better on Xbox One, to be fair.
5141000	5145000	It is, with the whole, you know, live sharing. It's kind of cool, so, but, I don't know.
5145000	5146000	Alright.
5148000	5155000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, bar.
5155000	5170000	This would be awesome if it's actually happening, no idea, but, uh, there's a thing going on in Japan this week called the Pokemon Game Show, and during this event, Nintendo actually teased, potentially, don't get your hopes up, but a Pokemon title for the Wii U in 3D.
5171000	5181000	Which would be weird, because there's never been a straight-up Pokemon, like, main franchise game on the consoles. They've always been the handhelds. Now, there's been tons of spin-off stuff.
5181000	5183000	Yeah, like the Rumble stuff.
5183000	5188000	Yeah, exactly, but, uh, you know, Pinball, and, well, no, I guess Pinball was on the handhelds, too, but wasn't there, um-
5188000	5189000	Pokemon Snap.
5189000	5192000	Yeah, Pokemon Snap, and then there was the GameCube Coliseum.
5192000	5193000	They also have those weird-
5193000	5194000	That was fun.
5194000	5197000	They also have the weird spin-off games, the Poke Park games that have been on the Wii.
5197000	5216000	Well, what happened in this video is that, uh, you're playing on the main- it was playing on the main screen, it had a CG Pikachu, leading Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander in a Game Boy world, but at the end of the trailer, uh, there was a 3D Wii U Pokemon title that showed Lucario going face-to-face with Blaziken in a futuristic city.
5216000	5226000	And I- I did think to myself, I was like, you know, if Nintendo wanted to turn the Wii U around real quick, real quick, here's a way to do it.
5228000	5230000	Pokemon's prints money.
5230000	5238000	I think that they- I think it's- I think it's gonna be another, like, Coliseum title or something. I don't think it's gonna be anything like a mainstream Pokemon game.
5238000	5250000	And, you know, and I said before, with the whole Skylanders and Disney Infinity stuff, I'm like, it's really only- and I know that Nintendo is doing it in some capacity, but if that's successful, or whatever, it could just get even bigger.
5250000	5257000	Like, I know with the- the rumble- the download thing where you can only get the figures at GameStop or whatever, it does feel in some way like getting the foot in the water.
5257000	5259000	Figures are gonna be $90 now, by the way.
5262000	5263000	They're scarce.
5263000	5268000	And you can't- you can't download the figure on the internet, so I don't know what to tell you if you get screwed on those.
5268000	5271000	Technically, that's not entirely true.
5272000	5284000	Because there are apps, and they have this with Skylanders already, there are apps where people have recorded the RFID, you know, the near-field communication stuff, and you can actually simulate that with your phone.
5284000	5288000	You just put your phone on, you know, the communication thing, and you can play as that stuff.
5288000	5294000	In fact, I- I don't think my phone supports that, but that'd be kind of interesting to check out with Disney Infinity.
5294000	5296000	That might be a way to get around buying figures.
5297000	5300000	It's a strange form of piracy.
5301000	5304000	Uh, it's like... I don't know what you can call that.
5304000	5312000	You know what? We need- we need to travel back to a time when there wasn't these fucking figures they had to buy to give the whole experience to the game.
5312000	5313000	It's all about patches.
5313000	5318000	No, there was no patches back then either. If the game was fucked, it was fucked.
5318000	5323000	Games back then went through a process called testing, which I think is sometimes skipped now.
5324000	5325000	As is the case of Disney-
5325000	5327000	There was a seal of approval, goddammit.
5327000	5331000	As is the case of Disney Infinity on PlayStation 3, if Twitter is any indication.
5332000	5333000	Yeah.
5333000	5341000	Anyhow, DarkSakura, why don't you step into the gaming vault and take us back to a time when games didn't have all this shit?
5341000	5344000	Uh, by the way, I did just beat Find Me.
5344000	5346000	Oh, congrats. Did I slay the final boss?
5346000	5348000	Actually, a wandering hero did.
5349000	5353000	But you almost did it. It was one hit point off, so Rob-
5353000	5356000	Story of my life. Somebody comes in and snatches all my glory.
5356000	5357000	This is-
5357000	5358000	Story of my life.
5358000	5360000	The game is Guilty Gear X.
5362000	5368000	And the reason why I picked Guilty Gear X over Guilty Gear was, I mean, the original is because I think more people played X.
5368000	5369000	You don't have to give a reason.
5369000	5372000	I can give a reason if I- Rob! Rob!
5373000	5377000	Uh oh, this is battle music. This is the music DarkSakura kicked my butt to.
5379000	5385000	I have a story about this, by the way. Guilty Gear X, which was, um, I had it on Dreamcast.
5386000	5390000	And it's supposed to take place a few weeks after the first game.
5391000	5407000	There's a new Commander Gear. Basically, it takes everything that was good about the, uh, about the, uh, original one on PlayStation and just pumps it up a few more notches.
5407000	5411000	It's got better graphics, of course, because it was on the Dreamcast.
5411000	5414000	It's got great music. It's really, really fun.
5414000	5420000	And also, it was, like, one of the last cosplays I did. I cosplayed Biken, and my husband did not like it because of the cleavage.
5421000	5426000	So, moving forward, so yeah, the Dreamcast one had a limited, uh, release.
5426000	5431000	It came with a special mini CD, um, that had different artworks that you could view on the PC.
5431000	5434000	Um, there was a Type A, Type B, and Type C.
5434000	5439000	And, um, it had different images printed on the GD-ROM disk instead.
5440000	5444000	As far as the characters in it, it has, uh, a bunch of people from the first game.
5444000	5451000	It had Soul Bad Guy, which is funny because Soul Bad Guy was actually voiced by the, uh, creator of the series.
5452000	5464000	And, uh, it had, uh, you know, Mei, Biken, the Kaikisuke, Potemkin, Chip Zanuff, Milia Rage, Zatoone, Axolot, and Testament.
5464000	5472000	Um, it had new characters like Jim, Kurado, uh, Kurado Berry, Johnny, Anji, Mito, Venom, Dizzy, and Robo Key.
5473000	5484000	So, it was, um, a really fun fighting game. I mean, I have, I actually have the Guilty Gear petite on WonderSwan, by the way, which was also super fun.
5484000	5491000	But I've enjoyed every game in the series, but I'd have to say that I didn't really enjoy the series until this one came out.
5491000	5501000	As far as other versions came out, there was X+, that was an enhanced version that had two extra characters that came out on the PS2, um, in Japan only.
5501000	5514000	And, uh, then, um, that was on November 29th, and then there was basically just a bare bones port of the Dreamcast one that didn't have any of the extra stuff from the Japanese version that came out in the US and Europe.
5514000	5528000	Um, the two new characters were, uh, Cliff Anderson and Justice, uh, had different game modes, it had, uh, just all kinds of different moves, it was really neat, and more in the story mode and password mode.
5528000	5539000	Uh, the advanced version came out on GBA, and it was basically the arcade version, and it had all of the characters except for Robo Key.
5539000	5543000	But it had, but, uh, it was just different stuff.
5543000	5555000	There was version 1.5 as well that had some of the stuff from Guilty Gear XX, um, there was Petit, which is the one I mentioned earlier, the WonderSwan color version, which was pretty fun.
5555000	5560000	I mean, it was actually super cutesy Guilty Gear, it's all I can say, and I've beaten that several times.
5560000	5567000	Petit 2 came out, and it also, um, had all of the arcade characters except for Bike and Dizzy and Robo Key.
5567000	5574000	Um, it had Fanny coming back, I have to laugh every time I say that because that's also slang for girl bits.
5574000	5584000	Um, it was really, it was really cute. The one I owned though was Petit, and then there was Club and Raid of Arms, but honestly, the Dreamcast one, awesome.
5585000	5601000	And now the story about this, back in the day when we used to rip our Dreamcast games, um, we actually found out the hard way, this is the game that we, that my friend Julie learned to, and you remember Julie, learned how to rip
5601000	5602000	No, I forgot her.
5602000	5603000	Everyone's forgotten her because
5603000	5605000	She's a figment of my imagination.
5605000	5617000	You know what, she means well to me, I haven't heard from her in ages. So, anyway, um, Julie was trying to figure out how to rip, um, Dreamcast games, and this was the game she tried on, so we had many, many copies of the soundtrack.
5617000	5620000	Many copies of the soundtrack.
5620000	5624000	And learned quite a bit about the data that went to, uh, GB-ROM.
5626000	5630000	Or, I should say, uh, uh, GD-ROM, the Giga Disc.
5631000	5636000	So, great soundtrack, great game, great characters, lots of cosplay fun.
5636000	5637000	Alright.
5637000	5641000	I, you know, still have my Biken costume, except for the claw which belonged to Evan.
5644000	5645000	Cosplay memories.
5645000	5646000	Cosplay memories.
5646000	5652000	You know what, I got the craziest arm cramp doing the Biken costume, because Biken's missing an arm.
5652000	5662000	So I had to, I had this huge sleeve that was all torn and ratted up, you know, because she's missing an arm and the sleeve's all ratted, and she has a claw that hangs out of it.
5662000	5672000	So I had to walk around with my hand on my shoulder, and this hook thing around my, uh, strapped to my arm hanging down with the chain and everything.
5672000	5680000	And, oh my god, I had the worst cramp, and I ended up just having to think of another way to tuck it into the sleeve because it was a pain to cosplay.
5680000	5681000	But it was a fun costume.
5681000	5684000	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Guilty Gear X.
5686000	5687000	Alright.
5687000	5691000	It doesn't, it doesn't feel like the game is that old, but I guess it is, it's over ten years old.
5691000	5695000	Well, the first Guilty Gear, you know, was PlayStation.
5695000	5696000	Alright.
5696000	5703000	Well, uh, that's gonna do it for this half of Orange Launch Radio, but don't go anywhere, we got plenty more show coming up, uh, including some rapid fire news.
5703000	5709000	The Fugal Question of the Week, emails, and, uh, your phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
5709000	5712000	When we come back with all more Orange Launch Radio.
5719000	5721000	Hi, welcome back everybody to Orange Launch Radio.

5744000	5750000	Especially, you know, it's a long show, so I know some of you dedicate a lot of time to, uh, listen throughout the week, so we appreciate it.
5750000	5755000	Hope we're helping you get through your workday or your commute, or wherever you choose to listen to this program.
5755000	5756000	Rob, I have a request.
5756000	5757000	Okay.
5757000	5759000	When we're officially into Final Fantasy Land.
5759000	5760000	Okay.
5760000	5762000	You need to make a version of Sassy Pants.
5763000	5765000	I thought about naming my character that, but, uh...
5765000	5767000	Lil Poundcake is cute, though.
5767000	5772000	Yeah, well, I named my character in Final Fantasy XIV, Lil Poundcake, and she's a little...
5772000	5775000	I always, I still want to say Tarutarus, because that's the word in Final Fantasy XI, but I guess they're...
5775000	5776000	Lelafell, or Falafel.
5776000	5779000	I call her Falafels. She's a little falafel.
5779000	5781000	And, uh, yeah, Lil Poundcake.
5781000	5783000	And, somebody actually asked me in the show...
5783000	5784000	Oh, no, it was you.
5784000	5785000	It was me, because I was asking everybody.
5785000	5790000	Yeah, you're like, where'd the inspiration for your name come from? Because there are, like, a diverse amount of...
5790000	5791000	My favorite was Sprinkles Galore.
5791000	5792000	Yeah.
5792000	5793000	And, uh, Seymour Gylove.
5793000	5796000	Uh, there was a character I saw called Fap Fap.
5796000	5799000	I saw Fap Fap. And, uh, Captain Obvious.
5799000	5801000	I bet you did, you dirty hoe.
5801000	5802000	You know what, I saw Captain Obvious.
5802000	5803000	Yeah.
5803000	5810000	And, I also saw, um, what was the other one there? I saw Ianto Jones, and I said, okay, Torchwood, and they're like, yeah, big Torchwood fans. Cool.
5810000	5816000	But, you were like, where's, what's the inspiration for your name? And, like, you know, some are named after, like, philosophers, or an anime, or whatever.
5816000	5819000	And, I'm like, uh, my name comes from RuPaul's Drag Race.
5819000	5824000	I was actually super surprised that I got the names I got, though.
5824000	5828000	Yeah. Well, it's, when there's first name and last name, it's much easier to get the names.
5828000	5830000	Yeah, but I was going for specific Homestuck characters.
5830000	5831000	Yeah.
5831000	5836000	So, I was like, why not? Because I was making a cat girl, and I wanted to name her after one of the cat trolls.
5836000	5842000	I was, uh, being asked in chat during the break at Live.VogueNetwork.com by, uh, SailorVenus, who's in our chat tonight. Hello.
5842000	5851000	Uh, what, uh, Warcraft characters I was playing these days. And, to be honest, I, I haven't really been tapped into WoW as much lately, because I kind of got distracted with single player games.
5851000	5854000	I went through my whole MOBA phase, which I'm still in a little bit.
5854000	5855000	Sassy is the best.
5856000	5862000	Well, yes, I do have my paladin. But, like, SailorVenus asked me, what's your main main, what's your main main character?
5862000	5870000	And I'm like, I kind of have, I have ADD character at this point. I used to raid with my monk, so I guess that's my main.
5870000	5871000	Was it Gordita?
5871000	5873000	She would be the best geared. No, uh, Calmain.
5873000	5874000	Calmain.
5875000	5884000	But I had my priest before that. I had Chakwas, my priest, who I raided with. I have, uh, Sassy on alliance, who I did get to 90, and I did some five mans with.
5884000	5886000	And I've geared her that way, but I haven't really done any raids.
5886000	5890000	I've, I've got your, your Rissa close to being raid ready.
5890000	5896000	But now, I also have, see, the character I was playing the most, like, two months ago was Chocolena, my hunter, who's PVP.
5896000	5899000	So, cause I, I had my PVP phase.
5899000	5901000	I think it's hard to PVP on a hunter, though.
5901000	5903000	Well, that was the fun of it.
5904000	5907000	You know what, PVP is the whole reason why I never finish Children's Week.
5907000	5909000	Oh, yeah, it can be- Stupid PVP.
5909000	5914000	You really, like, honestly, if you're gonna do PVP, just turn off chat. It'll make your life easier.
5914000	5921000	Alright, anyhow, we could talk MMOs all night, and I do on Wednesday nights on a show called Hoard House, 7 o'clock Pacific.
5921000	5924000	Pluggity pluggity. And for the record, I didn't get Nepeta, I got Mulan.
5926000	5930000	What unique context. Remember how I talked about the, uh, podcast and, and Stitcher listeners earlier?
5930000	5936000	Queen Simia, in chat, asked if I got Nepeta Lajon, which I didn't. I got Mulan, which is the one I wanted.
5936000	5937000	There you go. Alright.
5937000	5939000	But Nepeta's cute, but I wanted Mulan.
5939000	5944000	Let's go into, uh, rapid fire news tonight, and some other gaming news we're gonna go over quickly.
5944000	5950000	Alright. So, let's, uh, let's talk a little bit about discounts.
5950000	5957000	Um, the Vita is actually dropping in price, apparently. Actually, it's not apparently, it's gonna happen.
5957000	5963000	Um, but this is something else. Uh, during Gamescom, I guess, they're probably gonna make this announcement as well.
5963000	5973000	But, uh, I guess the launch versions of the system, the 3G Vita launch bundle, and also the Wi-Fi version are dropping down to $200.
5973000	5982000	And, um, also at the same time, they're going to be dropping the price of, uh, the Greatest Hits games, I guess, for $15 a piece, and that's for PlayStation 3.
5982000	5987000	Um, the other thing, too, which I don't think is on here and hasn't been announced yet.
5987000	5997000	That also includes new bundles that happen to be coming out, the new starter bundles, which, um, you know, there is one that happens to be coming out on Tuesday for The Walking Dead.
5997000	6002000	Just saying. So, um, you can get those for $200 now.
6002000	6011000	Also for $200, and this is allegedly a rumor, but it's not, uh, there is a 12 gigabyte PlayStation 3 coming to North America.
6011000	6020000	Now, I know what you're thinking. 12 gigabytes? That's awfully small. That's flash storage that they have on there, but you will be able to add a hard drive to it as well.
6020000	6026000	So, it's a good place if you wanna, if you're planning on adding your own hard drive anyways, might as well not spend any more money than you have to.
6026000	6030000	And 12 gigabytes would be enough to install Grand Theft Auto 5, I'm just saying.
6030000	6032000	Which is apparently all a person needs, right?
6032000	6033000	That's really all a person needs, yeah.
6033000	6038000	You know what? You just need to talk to Dan, because he's all kinds of happy about that game.
6039000	6046000	It is gonna encompass a lot of my time. That's all I'm saying. Anyways, uh, Fantasia!
6046000	6050000	Coming soon to VOG, the Grand Theft Auto 5 show, because it's all Loki's ever gonna be able to talk about.
6050000	6052000	They already have a Grand Theft Auto 5 show.
6052000	6057000	Grand Theft Auto 5, GTA 5 o'clock, and it's a UK show, and it's great.
6057000	6058000	Good for them, that's great.
6058000	6059000	They are fantastic.
6059000	6060000	That's awesome.
6060000	6067000	But hey, you know, since I will be spending most of my time online, I could probably guess Sun Horde House.
6068000	6069000	You sure could!
6069000	6073000	Since, you know, Horde House was a Warcraft only show, but now it isn't, it's all online games.
6073000	6076000	So yes, you could guess on Horde House to talk Grand Theft Auto 5 online.
6076000	6077000	Yes.
6077000	6079000	Because lord knows none of us will be playing it.
6079000	6082000	And you're really doing yourself a disservice.
6082000	6085000	I'm kidding, I'm super curious. But anyway.
6085000	6089000	It's not all about murdering people, you can play golf, and do yoga.
6089000	6095000	Oh, yay! Yoga! Oh man, yoga's my favorite thing in Final Fantasy XIV, I don't know about you.
6095000	6100000	And that golfing in Warcraft, that's the reason to plunk down the money right there.
6100000	6102000	You know what.
6102000	6114000	Alright. Fantasia, Music Evolved, new game coming from Harmonix, and they also have some more original pieces coming to the game,
6114000	6124000	including some works from, I guess, Inan Zur, and he did some music in Fallout, Fallout 3.
6124000	6139000	And he's going to be doing, I guess, some original versions of, or different takes on, I guess, Vivaldi, Four Seasons, Night on the Bald Mountain, stuff like that.
6139000	6145000	Also, I guess he's arranged the orchestral mix of Queens Bohemian Rhapsody in the game.
6145000	6147000	That sounds interesting.
6147000	6152000	And of course, that's coming out sometime in 2014 on both Xbox platforms.
6152000	6157000	And this is a little strange, but...
6157000	6168000	So, they have, I guess this is going to be one of those announcements at Gamescom, but PlayStation Vita Pets coming to the Vita.
6168000	6175000	It's like Nintendogs. If the dogs talked, they talk. It's weird.
6175000	6178000	Here's that killer app that's going to sell a million Vitas.
6178000	6182000	It's weird that they're talking. I just, the whole point...
6182000	6183000	I don't want you to talk.
6183000	6196000	Exactly. And they talk like that generic after school TV, kids Disney show or something like that that's really annoying and grinding on your brain.
6196000	6204000	It would really only be awesome if you could take your PlayStation Pets and import them into Tokyo Jungle. That would be awesome.
6204000	6205000	That could be pretty cool.
6205000	6208000	See? You and I need to start a game studio.
6208000	6209000	Tokyo Jungle.
6209000	6211000	Dark Soccer could come visit once in a while.
6211000	6215000	Starts off like Nintendogs and then it gets really dark.
6215000	6217000	Now that I like.
6217000	6220000	It's like Battle Royale for dogs and cats.
6220000	6224000	No, but then you talk pet cruelty and I'm like, no, we can't have that.
6224000	6225000	No, it's not pet cruelty.
6225000	6229000	Oh, come on. You're the one who named your horse Politary and beat her.
6229000	6230000	That was different.
6230000	6231000	In Derby Owners Club.
6231000	6232000	That was different.
6232000	6233000	I should do like games.
6233000	6234000	You named your horse Glue.
6234000	6235000	I have in my cube.
6235000	6237000	I did name my horse Glue.
6237000	6248000	I have my, I have in my cubicle at work. There's a poster that I, it was, it's a little, I don't even know where it's from, but it basically shows how to create battle hamsters.
6248000	6254000	And it's basically a hamster that you tape, you duct tape a knife to and then they fight it out.
6254000	6255000	But that would be fun.
6255000	6258000	As long as it's over the top, then that's fine.
6258000	6261000	Like, you know, like, remember Bungie Ferret Tossing?
6261000	6262000	That, that game is hilarious.
6262000	6263000	That one's over the top.
6263000	6264000	There's another game.
6264000	6270000	And once again, the name is escaping me that has like dogs with tank cannons on them.
6270000	6276000	And I don't remember what it was called, but it's something that it's got a few games in the series and it was on PlayStation 2 and stuff.
6276000	6284000	They had, it's like, literally they have like dogs with tank cannons on, like giant tank cannons.
6284000	6285000	Not just a clever name.
6285000	6286000	Artillery. It's, it's ridiculous.
6286000	6287000	Dogs with guns.
6287000	6288000	That's like worms.
6288000	6289000	You know what?
6289000	6290000	That's worms.
6290000	6291000	Actually, you remember, okay, going back to WoW for just a second.
6291000	6292000	Yeah.
6292000	6294000	That one little, where was it?
6294000	6298000	It was in wherever the Taran area is up on top of a plateau.
6298000	6299000	Thunder Bluff, right?
6299000	6304000	Was it, was it there or was it somewhere closer to human lands where there were the-
6304000	6305000	There's Metal Saga, by the way.
6305000	6310000	Where there were the hamsters and the rabbits that would suddenly, you know, have knives.
6310000	6311000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
6311000	6312000	And shit.
6312000	6313000	Yeah.
6313000	6315000	I just hung out there for hours just watching them.
6315000	6316000	Because, oh, I was bored.
6316000	6320000	But anyway, but like you follow one of them around and you can actually watch them transform.
6320000	6323000	But like there was the rabbit with combat knife and the hamster with the Uzi.
6323000	6324000	All right.
6324000	6326000	Y'all and your animal fighting issues.
6326000	6327000	No, no, no.
6327000	6328000	See, this is what I'm telling you.
6328000	6329000	That was awesome.
6329000	6331000	See, that's from Metal Saga right there.
6331000	6332000	Okay, I have to play this.
6332000	6333000	I gotta move on.
6333000	6336000	I want Ashiba Inu with bazooka.
6336000	6338000	Moving on, moving on.
6338000	6341000	That's what Call of Duty ghost scenes right there.
6341000	6343000	Dogs with giant bazookas.
6343000	6344000	All right.
6344000	6345000	I'd play it.
6345000	6349000	I don't know how many of you guys have checked this out, but there's the Humble Origin bundle,
6349000	6350000	which is available from the-
6350000	6351000	What?
6351000	6353000	Yeah, the Humble bundle has the Humble Origin bundle.
6353000	6356000	And I know a lot of people are like, ew, origin.
6356000	6359000	But the cool thing is, well, A, it's for charity.
6359000	6361000	And all of the money is going to charity.
6361000	6362000	So no money goes to EA.
6362000	6364000	So what games are in there that I already own?
6364000	6365000	Okay, here it is.
6365000	6370000	If you pay a dollar or more, you get Dead Space, Burnout Paradise, The Ultimate Box,
6370000	6374000	Crysis 2 Maximum Edition, Mirror's Edge, Dead Space 3, and Medal of Honor.
6374000	6377000	If you pay more than the average, which will be about five bucks,
6377000	6382000	Battlefield 3 and The Sims 3 plus the starter pack are included.
6382000	6386000	Any of those games that are available on Steam will let you get Steam keys.
6386000	6391000	So I believe the only games you have to have Origin installed for are Dead Space 3
6391000	6393000	and then the two bonus games, Battlefield 3 and The Sims.
6393000	6395000	I do want to play Dead Space 3.
6395000	6397000	So, well, you can go get it for like a dollar.
6397000	6399000	I've already got, though, a bunch of those other games.
6399000	6400000	And it goes to charity.
6400000	6401000	It's charity.
6401000	6406000	Yeah, and since you've already installed Origin, so you're already kind of, you know, tainted anyways,
6406000	6407000	then you can go ahead and, you know-
6407000	6408000	Might as well, right?
6408000	6412000	I took my pills.
6412000	6416000	See, I, on the other hand, I only, uh, I paid the full amount,
6416000	6420000	because I like Battlefield 3, but I just haven't played it yet.
6420000	6422000	So I like the idea of it.
6422000	6425000	I just, uh, not installing Origin, though.
6425000	6431000	But I, mainly I paid more than the average, because, you know, they always add in extra games towards the end of the week.
6431000	6433000	So I'm curious to see what those are.
6433000	6435000	And I wanted Mirror's Edge and Burnout.
6435000	6438000	Burnout Paradise, dude, that is the, come on.
6438000	6443000	It's at least a dollar you can pay for one of the best racing games this generation.
6443000	6445000	I was going to say, the charities are great.
6445000	6447000	Like, you have Human Rights Campaign.
6447000	6449000	You can just have all of your money go to that.
6449000	6455000	American Cancer Society, Sacramento, or San Francisco AIDS Foundation, American Red Cross, WotC.
6455000	6457000	I mean, this is great.
6457000	6458000	Very cool.
6458000	6461000	So, um, yeah, I mean, it's for charity.
6461000	6466000	So hate on Origin all you want, but it's pretty hard to get mad at this.
6466000	6470000	Although, I've already got the three of those games.
6470000	6475000	Maybe I'm just being the Grinch, but you have to wonder, you have to wonder,
6475000	6478000	are they just trying to get Origin put on more computers?
6478000	6479000	Yeah.
6479000	6482000	Yep, because then they're going to say, look how many people have Origin.
6482000	6486000	Origin's a successful service. Look how many people have Origin.
6486000	6490000	I hate going there, because at the end of the day this is a great thing,
6490000	6492000	but it's just that you can't help but wonder.
6492000	6494000	And you know people are talking about it.
6494000	6497000	I'm super close to patching my Mass Effect 3 so I don't have to go through Origin.
6497000	6501000	I almost bought the Deep Silver bundle, but the problem is I bought the THQ bundle,
6501000	6503000	and that had a lot of the games that were in the Deep Silver bundle.
6503000	6504000	That's very true.
6504000	6510000	So I was like, eh, I just can't see myself buying yet another copy of Saints Row the Third.
6510000	6515000	Brad from Paw Culture says, with these bundles I always put all my fundage towards the charities.
6515000	6516000	That's at live.vognore.com.
6516000	6518000	Yes, you can decide how your money is split.
6518000	6522000	The cool thing about this one is that since EA is not getting any of the money,
6522000	6526000	usually the indie developers, you can give them a chunk of the pot and by default they get some.
6526000	6531000	But this time it's all charities and what they call the Humble Bundle tip.
6531000	6532000	Yeah.
6532000	6534000	Alright, and apparently I leveled up during that segment.
6534000	6538000	Well, that was also Dan texting me, and I usually have my phone turned off.
6538000	6540000	So now everyone knows what my text sound is.
6540000	6541000	There you go.
6541000	6547000	Alright, a StarCraft MMO, and I think this is something they were actually creating in the StarCraft II engine, fan created,
6547000	6551000	but like World of StarCraft or whatever, but it got kind of smacked down.
6551000	6553000	But now it's on Kickstarter.
6553000	6557000	StarCraft Universe, which was originally World of StarCraft,
6557000	6561000	it will allow players to create a character and log into an alternate history StarCraft.
6561000	6564000	The Zerg and Protoss hybrids are around.
6564000	6567000	I guess Blizzard does bless this project now.
6567000	6571000	So StarCraft Universe, they can make this in the StarCraft II engine.
6571000	6573000	It just can't be called World of StarCraft.
6573000	6574000	That was the deal.
6574000	6575000	I remember they changed something.
6575000	6579000	So they won $80,000 that they're getting on Kickstarter, and here's why.
6579000	6585000	This is for the creator Ryan Winsen and the people he's working with to get additional pylons
6585000	6590000	and focus solely on creating the game and getting it out there in 2014 for an open beta,
6590000	6593000	which I'm assuming means I want to be able to quit my job and do this full time
6593000	6595000	and actually get it out in a timely manner.
6595000	6597000	That's what I'm reading.
6597000	6598000	That sounds about right, yeah.
6598000	6604000	There are stretch goals and other rewards, a Zerg character class if they make $100,000, and so on and so on.
6604000	6606000	Let me see where they're at right now.
6606000	6609000	Just kind of curious for an update here on this Sunday evening.
6609000	6613000	They've got 22 days to go, and they've almost made half their money.
6613000	6615000	They're at $36,000, so not bad.
6615000	6618000	They're ahead of the curve a little bit if they can keep that going,
6618000	6621000	although I think most Kickstarters, the earlier the better.
6621000	6623000	So, good luck.
6624000	6627000	I'm surprised Blizzard's kind of letting them do that,
6627000	6631000	because aren't they raising money based off of StarCraft IP in a way?
6631000	6634000	I'm sure they've got some kind of deal worked out.
6634000	6638000	I guess, and I guess at the end of the day it's all promo for StarCraft II, so.
6638000	6639000	Yeah.
6639000	6646000	Anyhow, speaking of Blizzard, another beta that launched this weekend that has a lot of people's attention is Hearthstone.
6646000	6648000	The Hearthstone closed beta.
6648000	6651000	This is Blizzard's free-to-play little card game that they've got.
6651000	6654000	It went into a closed beta this weekend.
6654000	6659000	Some folks from the opt-in pool, some press and some fansites all in the beta,
6659000	6662000	checking out Hearthstone this weekend, and there's no NDA for it,
6662000	6666000	so people everywhere are streaming their plays and so forth, which is cool.
6666000	6668000	I want to check this game out at some point.
6668000	6671000	I'm especially excited that it's supposed to be on tablets or whatever,
6671000	6674000	and a lot of people that are playing it saying it's very easy to play.
6674000	6677000	I do think it's very interesting timing on Blizzard's part,
6677000	6682000	and I don't think it's any coincidence at all that the Hearthstone beta started out of nowhere this weekend,
6682000	6688000	when a lot of World of Warcraft and hardcore Blizzard fans I think were a little bored waiting for patch 5.4.
6688000	6693000	Let me go try this other open beta that's going on right now.
6693000	6696000	I'm going to go try this Final Fantasy XIV.
6696000	6700000	So Blizzard releases this to their most vocal people,
6700000	6704000	people that are some heavy influencers in the community and so forth,
6704000	6707000	and suddenly none of them care about Final Fantasy XIV anymore.
6707000	6709000	They're all playing this.
6709000	6713000	That's a smart move on Blizzard's part, but I will say this,
6713000	6716000	and I'll expand a little bit on this on Horde House, but I can't help myself.
6716000	6718000	I have to say something now.
6718000	6722000	Because of this, I've seen some people shading Final Fantasy XIV a little bit,
6722000	6725000	and I'm just going to say, don't shade a game you haven't played.
6725000	6727000	That's ignorant.
6727000	6731000	One of these is a free-to-play trading card game that's going to be on tablets.
6731000	6736000	The other one of these is a very intricate MMO that's going to be on PlayStation 3.
6736000	6739000	They're not alike in any way, shape, or form.
6739000	6740000	NPC.
6740000	6741000	Huh?
6741000	6742000	NPC.
6742000	6743000	Yes, NPC.
6743000	6746000	What are you so threatened by, y'all?
6746000	6748000	What's so threatening?
6748000	6752000	Because people like to be right, and people like their thing to be better.
6752000	6756000	Yes, and that's kind of like blind fandom, and it's a little bit ridiculous, people.
6756000	6757000	Come on.
6757000	6758000	So, anyway.
6758000	6760000	I'm going to give you all a piece of advice.
6760000	6763000	You can like item A and also like item B.
6763000	6766000	Oh, I can like Lady Gaga and Katy Perry?
6766000	6767000	No.
6767000	6769000	I can like Supernatural and Doctor Who.
6769000	6770000	What?
6770000	6772000	I can like the current Doctor Who and the classic Doctor Who.
6772000	6773000	What?
6773000	6774000	I know, right?
6774000	6775000	Since you're a foreign Grand Theft Auto 5?
6775000	6776000	No.
6777000	6778000	Rob.
6778000	6779000	What?
6779000	6781000	I can play Dragon Age 2 and the Mass Effect series.
6781000	6783000	PlayStation and Xbox?
6783000	6784000	Xbox?
6784000	6785000	What?
6785000	6786000	No.
6786000	6787000	You have to.
6787000	6788000	Loki, that's just cross.
6788000	6789000	You have to buy one or the other.
6789000	6790000	Hey, guess what?
6790000	6794000	I have both and a Wii.
6794000	6797000	My God, people.
6797000	6798000	I know.
6798000	6800000	Cats and dogs living together.
6800000	6801000	Mass hysteria.
6801000	6803000	I love that line.
6803000	6808000	Anyway, I look forward to playing this beta at some point whenever I, you know, get my
6808000	6809000	little access.
6809000	6811000	By the way, I do have to make a little tangent.
6811000	6814200	And I forgot to mention I was playing Dragon Age 2 because I actually stopped Final Fantasy
6814200	6816000	XIV to play Dragon Age 2.
6816000	6821000	I totally missed one part where I could, to start the romance with Fenris.
6821000	6829000	So I totally cheated and did the debug mode so I could just change all the romance options.
6829000	6832000	And Becky's husband said, so you gave him roofies?
6832000	6835000	I was like, okay, that's pretty funny.
6835000	6836000	All right.
6836000	6838000	Dark Sakura, you have some rapid fire news for us.
6838000	6839000	I do.
6839000	6844000	And one of them is about Shin Megami Tensei, if I can actually get to Safari.
6844000	6847000	There is a UK release date.
6847000	6853000	It is going to be, that's actually Shin Megami Tensei, Devil Summoner, Soul Hackers.
6853000	6859000	The European release date is going to be on September, moved from September 13th to September
6859000	6860000	20th.
6860000	6867000	And it's going to be available digitally on the 3DS eShop on the following week on the
6867000	6868000	25th of September.
6868000	6871000	So that is the official release date for that.
6871000	6873000	Sorry guys in the UK.
6873000	6877000	We also have a date for Castle of Illusion remaster in the UK.
6877000	6880000	It's going to be September 4th and it will be 10 pounds.
6880000	6883000	So I would love to hear what people say.
6883000	6889000	Now, of course, it's going to be available for pre-order on August 21st on PlayStation
6889000	6892000	Network for the Mega Drive emulator.
6892000	6896000	And last but not least, we have Castlevania Mirror of Fate HD.
6896000	6901000	It has a list date that's on Play Asia.
6901000	6906000	And it says it's going to be for PS3 and Xbox 360.
6906000	6911000	And saying that the collection will have the first Lords of Shadow, all the DLC, and an
6911000	6915000	exclusive demo of Lords of Shadow 2 and will be out in October.
6915000	6921000	Yeah, it's going to be part of the Lords of Shadow collection thing since Lords of Shadow
6921000	6924000	2 got delayed to next year.
6925000	6935000	Also, Brazil's games rating board had for December 2012, I'm sorry, in December 2012
6935000	6940000	Mirror of Fate was on the Brazil rating board.
6940000	6945000	And they're also saying that there's going to be a PC and Wii U one, but there's nothing
6945000	6947000	listed on Play Asia.
6947000	6950000	So that's it.
6950000	6951000	All right.
6952000	6956000	It's sad that actually that's like almost the only game.
6956000	6959000	I mean, Konami has hardly any games coming out.
6959000	6961000	Pro Evo and this.
6961000	6963000	I mean, that's it.
6963000	6964000	And the next year.
6964000	6966000	Metal Gear Solid 5.
6966000	6968000	Yeah, Metal Gear Solid 5.
6968000	6972000	But I mean, shit, they're releasing stuff less often than Capcom is nowadays.
6972000	6974000	Don't they have a lot of like kiddie stuff though?
6974000	6976000	They're all mobile now.
6976000	6979000	But they don't have a lot of kiddie licenses anymore.
6979000	6981000	No DDR anymore.
6981000	6984000	No, not even Karaoke Revolution anymore.
6984000	6985000	All right.
6985000	6987000	Let's get to the foogle question of the week.
6995000	6998000	Every week we ask our Facebook and our Google Plus communities a question.
6998000	7002000	You take those two words, you slam them together, you get foogle.
7002000	7003000	Here's the question.
7003000	7007000	There's rumors out there that Sony is making some moves to launch an online TV service
7007000	7008000	on the PlayStation 4.
7008000	7011000	Certainly similar TV integrative features are a part of the Xbox One as well.
7011000	7015000	How important is the integration of television into your video game console?
7015000	7018000	Is this sort of service something you are interested in?
7018000	7021000	Or do you think Sony and Microsoft should focus less on these online TV networks
7021000	7023000	and more on the games?
7023000	7025000	Redertainment on Google Plus says,
7025000	7030000	I gave up having a centralized box for my entertainment when I hooked up my Nest to my VCR.
7030000	7035000	My current entertainment system is essentially a series of individual components working together
7035000	7038000	that I upgrade as my will and resources allow me to do so.
7038000	7042000	Having one centralized box for everything would wreck the general aesthetic
7042000	7047000	of the altar that I worship in front of for several hours each day.
7047000	7048000	Act Def says,
7048000	7051000	For me it's truly something I don't care that much about
7051000	7054000	since most of the services they offer only work in some countries.
7054000	7056000	It's as good as Plus though.
7056000	7058000	E3VL says,
7058000	7063000	I'm not much of a TV guy so if it's part of PlayStation Plus I may check it out if I have spare time.
7063000	7067000	Definitely not going to pay extra for the service unless it has enough quality content
7067000	7071000	to replace my Netflix subscription at the same or lower cost.
7071000	7073000	Joe C says,
7073000	7078000	I live in the UK so it's probably of no consequence to me as these services are non-existent,
7078000	7080000	severely limited over here.
7080000	7083000	I don't like too many services competing with each other though.
7083000	7087000	I don't want to subscribe to them all so I always feel as though I'm missing out.
7087000	7088000	That's a good point.
7088000	7091000	Like sometimes you have to feel like you have to do Hulu and Netflix
7091000	7093000	and everybody wants a little piece of that.
7093000	7094000	And Techie Q says,
7094000	7095000	Bring it on.
7095000	7100000	It's a small but big step into breaking the traditional TV cable model.
7100000	7102000	Those are the answers on Google Plus.
7102000	7104000	Some of them I had to shorten them all
7104000	7106000	because I want to try to get in a lot of people tonight
7106000	7108000	and we still have a lot more answers here over on Facebook
7108000	7110000	so I'm going to try to shorten some of these.
7110000	7112000	So I'm sorry if I don't read your full answer
7112000	7116000	but I'm going to encourage everybody to go over to facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio
7116000	7118000	and our Google Plus page Orange Lounge Radio
7118000	7120000	and read the full answers themselves.
7120000	7121000	Critical Myth says,
7121000	7126000	It's not that important to me given that I have several other options currently
7126000	7128000	that I'm very comfortable with.
7128000	7130000	Renee, our friend from Koopa Club says,
7130000	7134000	You know it's not really that important to me to have my television services
7134000	7136000	integrated into my video game console.
7136000	7140000	I understand the concept of wanting to encapsulate everything into one unit
7140000	7145000	or box if you will to just have one place to go for all your entertainment needs.
7145000	7146000	Lauren Z says,
7146000	7149000	What if we had a gaming console that actually focused on gaming?
7149000	7151000	I know, I know, it's an odd concept but just think about it.
7151000	7152000	It could work, right?
7152000	7154000	No? Okay.
7154000	7155000	Raginator says,
7155000	7158000	If this was a year or two ago I would have said that it's very important
7158000	7164000	but nowadays I'd probably say that it's not at all important.
7164000	7166000	Shane says,
7166000	7170000	They already do that stuff for me as they all play Hulu and Netflix.
7170000	7172000	Cable TV is for chumps.
7172000	7175000	Patty E says,
7175000	7178000	I get a gaming system for games.
7178000	7181000	I enjoy the fact that I can stream video from something like Netflix or Hulu
7181000	7183000	or directly from my computer,
7183000	7187000	but that does not at all contribute to why I want the system.
7187000	7189000	Marcello L says,
7189000	7191000	All these TV features are nice,
7191000	7195000	but really I buy a PlayStation 4 or Xbox One for games.
7195000	7198000	Now if the games had a feature that tied to the channel you are watching or show,
7198000	7199000	that would be interesting.
7199000	7201000	Still not buying an Xbox One.
7201000	7203000	Daniel S says,
7203000	7205000	I don't watch TV so this won't really affect me.
7205000	7207000	I mean the wife will use it so whatever.
7207000	7209000	I just find it funny because if this is true,
7209000	7211000	Sony will get compliments for adding on to their system,
7211000	7214000	but when Microsoft makes changes to be more like Sony,
7214000	7215000	they get slammed.
7215000	7216000	The console war is a fun show.
7216000	7219000	So kind of bringing up a point that was brought up by a chatter earlier.
7219000	7220000	Mason D says,
7220000	7223000	I think they need to spend more time making use of the peripherals that they put out.
7223000	7227000	Think of if Yu-Gi-Oh! with the PlayStation Eye.
7227000	7228000	Mason says,
7228000	7231000	You know, Sony, stop putting out all this shit and then not supporting it.
7231000	7233000	Interesting.
7233000	7235000	For the Fallen Dreams answers and says,
7235000	7240000	While most gamers would agree that the focus should be towards games, excuse me,
7240000	7244000	you can't deny the popularity of consoles for multimedia for more casual users.
7244000	7249000	My father, for instance, saw the PlayStation 3 as the cheapest Blu-ray Netflix player at the time
7249000	7251000	and uses it solely for that.
7251000	7253000	If there's a market for it, companies will follow suit.
7253000	7257000	It's easier to hook up a console in your living room than it is a desktop or laptop.
7257000	7260000	That's definitely an audience I'm sure these TV things are going for,
7260000	7265000	is people that are using their PlayStation 3 as their Blu-ray device.
7265000	7268000	So, yeah, I'm sure there's a lot of people like that.
7268000	7269000	SHA100Matt says,
7269000	7274000	The thought of having additional entertainment options on top of my gaming platform is definitely a good plus,
7274000	7279000	although the gamer side of me thinks that they should spend their time investing in additional gaming enhancements.
7279000	7281000	Galley89 says,
7281000	7283000	It makes no difference to me as I don't have cable.
7283000	7285000	I would be interested in an a la carte service, though.
7285000	7286000	Geeklet says,
7286000	7289000	It's always handy, but I don't think it's really a decision maker.
7289000	7291000	I'm fine with a console just playing games.
7291000	7293000	And lastly, Mike B says,
7293000	7301000	The future is no TV as we know it, only on demand, and pay for what you want to watch without commercials.
7301000	7302000	You know what?
7302000	7307000	Quickly, those are some abbreviated comments from Facebook and Google Plus.
7307000	7309000	Check out the full answers on those respective pages.
7309000	7310000	Yes, Jamie?
7310000	7314000	I'm just saying, a lot of people are repeating pretty much what's already going on in a lot of homes.
7314000	7315000	It definitely goes on in mine.
7315000	7318000	We have a computer hooked up to our TV.
7318000	7321000	So anything that we want to watch, it's either stuff we've downloaded.
7321000	7325000	We use Hulu Plus and we have Netflix.
7325000	7327000	Anything that we want to watch, it's all there.
7327000	7331000	Becky got rid of her cable so that she could use Amazon Prime.
7331000	7333000	She's really been happy with Amazon Prime.
7333000	7335000	She gets shows for Julia in that way.
7335000	7340000	So I'm just saying, it's kind of like what I was saying before with the whole people going to cell phone.
7340000	7348000	People are abandoning their traditional cable and TV services for getting what they want, when they want.
7348000	7354000	I think as much as Mike B kind of took us out there with the whole there's only going to be on demand,
7354000	7358000	my mind kind of goes there, but I actually don't think that's true.
7358000	7363000	Because yes, I think a lot of TV as we know it today will go that way,
7363000	7365000	and a lot of the expanded cable channels and so forth.
7365000	7369000	But keep in mind, there's one thing that on demand can't do, and that's live.
7369000	7373000	The live experience can't be duplicated in an on demand service.
7373000	7377000	The live experience can be, you know, we can go a different direction with it,
7377000	7380000	such as things like One Vs. 100 and so forth,
7380000	7385000	but I think there's always going to be a place out there for things like cable news.
7385000	7391000	Things like American Idol, which whether you watch it or not, it's still a very highly rated show.
7391000	7394000	And all those talent shows, you know, The Voice and things, those are still live shows.
7394000	7399000	I think in a way, broadcast TV may experience a bit of a renaissance,
7399000	7403000	where it goes back to, in the beginning of television, it was all live stuff.
7403000	7408000	But what I think is going to happen more with that is news might go on a subscription service.
7408000	7416000	Or take the path that BBC News has done, where you can go on the website for any of their news.
7416000	7419000	They also have live stream radio.
7419000	7425000	Where, like, I caught all kinds of new music just by listening to, what is it, Radio 4?
7425000	7427000	VOG Network's the only radio you need.
7427000	7433000	But I'm saying, you know, we're even with, how about all the crap that went down in Texas?
7433000	7439000	We had live streaming going on from the assembly room.
7439000	7444000	We had the freaking internet catch the Texas Assembly, breaking the law.
7445000	7451000	Live? I watched the whole thing. I was like, where's my popcorn? I'm just watching this.
7451000	7458000	But I mean, news in and of itself, you've got your people who are still going to listen to your biased sources.
7458000	7461000	You know, like your Fox News or your CNN or all of that, you know.
7461000	7465000	But you also have a great deal more people who are looking outside of those sources,
7465000	7470000	who are probably getting pretty fed up with having, you know, their world events spoon fed to them,
7470000	7473000	and want to actually see what's going on. They're looking to those other sources.
7473000	7477000	Another good catch from our chat room, something that you couldn't get on demand,
7477000	7480000	Jim Sally in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,
7480000	7485000	Sports need to be live. Football and baseball will keep traditional TV around forever.
7485000	7488000	ESPN's going to go to a subscription service.
7488000	7492000	Well, they kind of have subscription services like the NFL Direct and all that, and the NHL.
7492000	7495000	Well, that's probably what they're going to go towards.
7495000	7496000	We'll see.
7496000	7500000	You know, you want your ESPN. Well, you have the ESPN streaming service,
7500000	7503000	where you pay X amount and you get all the sports you want.
7503000	7509000	You get so many sports as you start, you know, sprouting the colors of your favorite team out of your skin or something.
7509000	7510000	All right.
7510000	7512000	You turn into a buccaneer.
7512000	7517000	All right. We're going to move on from our frugal question of the week, but good answers, you guys. Good answers.
7517000	7522000	All right. Let's get back into the news, and I know Loki's been dying to talk about this next story all night long.
7522000	7524000	Of course, I was.
7525000	7533000	Yes, Grand Theft Auto V finally had their big unveil of their online portion of the game.
7533000	7539000	It's actually going to be called Grand Theft Auto Online, and it's all sorts of awesome.
7539000	7544000	What's interesting, though, is it's actually kind of its own separate thing.
7544000	7549000	It launches October 1st, if you buy a copy of Grand Theft Auto V.
7549000	7556000	And thankfully, they're doing that because it gives me two weeks to play the game before I have to worry about trying to hog online.
7556000	7558000	But you get to create your own character.
7558000	7561000	You earn money in the game, and you can customize your character.
7561000	7563000	You can buy property in the game.
7563000	7565000	You can insure your cars.
7565000	7566000	You can buy cars.
7566000	7571000	It's so deep as far as the detail in the game.
7571000	7573000	They have it where you can play the stock market.
7573000	7578000	For example, you can invest money in a car company, and you go and destroy those cars out in the street,
7578000	7581000	and then they have to make more cars, and therefore your stock goes up.
7581000	7582000	You know, kind of stuff like that.
7582000	7588000	You can pull off heists with your friends, do all sorts of other unstructured activities,
7588000	7592000	plus they also have the regular deathmatch and all that fun stuff in there as well.
7592000	7595000	Lots of interesting details coming out.
7595000	7601000	Some of them actually were from the GTA 5 O'Clock story.
7601000	7605000	Basically saying, well, first off, it's GTA Online.
7605000	7609000	It's not actually part of Grand Theft Auto 5, although it's going to start off with San Andreas,
7609000	7612000	but it will expand beyond that.
7612000	7620000	So they're planning on adding more area other than Los Santos and San Andreas to play in.
7620000	7626000	Also saying that, you know, there's voice chat.
7626000	7628000	You can actually talk in the game.
7628000	7635000	Your character will move its mouth, matching your dialogue.
7635000	7640000	It will lip sync, and the AI characters in the game will react to the urgency in your voice.
7640000	7644000	So like if you said, get on the fucking floor!
7644000	7645000	They will get on the fucking floor.
7645000	7646000	You know, that type of shit.
7646000	7648000	But if you go, get on the floor.
7648000	7649000	Get on the floor.
7649000	7650000	Then they'll start dancing.
7650000	7651000	Yeah, exactly.
7651000	7652000	Or they'll strip.
7652000	7655000	Get on the floor now.
7656000	7660000	Basically, lots of interesting stuff in there.
7660000	7661000	It's a little different.
7661000	7666000	It's not necessarily an MMO, because you can play up to 16 players in there at a time,
7666000	7668000	but you can play with other people.
7668000	7670000	So you can play with your friends and stuff like that.
7670000	7672000	You can invite random people in there.
7672000	7673000	Is this mediocre?
7673000	7674000	Pretty massive?
7674000	7676000	It's going to be pretty massive, I think.
7676000	7680000	And plus, you know, they're saying that there's also a...
7680000	7681000	This is cool.
7681000	7683000	There's sort of like a spectator mode in it.
7683000	7688000	For example, if your friends have a high wanted level or whatever,
7688000	7690000	and they're getting chased down by the police,
7690000	7692000	you can sit back in your apartment and watch on the TV,
7692000	7694000	and it'll show it like a newscast,
7694000	7696000	watching your friends getting chased by the police.
7696000	7697000	That's pretty sweet.
7697000	7698000	I'm sorry.
7698000	7701000	So if you get in a white Bronco and drive away, I can watch it on the TV?
7701000	7702000	Yeah, you can do that.
7702000	7703000	That's awesome.
7703000	7711000	And what's also cool, though, is you can jump straight into your multiplayer by...
7711000	7713000	They've got the character select in the bottom of the screen
7713000	7714000	that you use your directional pad for,
7714000	7717000	and one of those characters that will unlock in there,
7717000	7720000	there'll be a countdown until it gets to October 1st,
7720000	7721000	is your multiplayer character.
7721000	7725000	So you can actually jump into multiplayer that quickly.
7725000	7726000	I don't know.
7726000	7729000	I think I'm just going to be spending a whole lot of time in this game
7729000	7733000	because I've been looking forward to this since Grand Theft Auto IV came out.
7733000	7734000	And you've literally said,
7734000	7737000	you know, I don't think I'm getting the new consoles.
7737000	7741000	I'm not getting Final Fantasy XIV because my life will get eaten up by this.
7741000	7743000	Yes, and that's the thing.
7743000	7747000	I see myself playing a lot more of this than, say, Killzone or something.
7747000	7752000	Yeah, if I get a console, of course I'm going to check out a game with it and stuff,
7752000	7757000	but it was kind of the same thing when I got all three consoles last time.
7757000	7761000	It was like, oh, cool, I got a PlayStation 3 and a Wii,
7761000	7764000	and I played those for a little bit, but I always went back to my Xbox 360
7764000	7766000	and were playing games on that.
7766000	7769000	You can't play a ton of different consoles at the same time.
7769000	7775000	I only have a finite amount of time to play games.
7775000	7781000	And so I'm probably going to dedicate most of my time to this.
7781000	7785000	And even Call of Duty and stuff, I'm like, you know, Call of Duty is kind of pretty awesome.
7785000	7788000	I may get that just because we don't have anything to play at work
7788000	7791000	because you can't really play online at work because our firewall is shit
7791000	7793000	and we don't have a lot of bandwidth.
7793000	7800000	But, you know, if it wasn't for that, if we had access to Live and stuff,
7800000	7802000	I probably wouldn't get Call of Duty either.
7802000	7804000	And I'm still not sure if I will get Call of Duty.
7804000	7809000	I probably will get Call of Duty, but yeah, it's just I'm going to be mostly at home.
7809000	7812000	I'm going to be playing mainly Grand Theft Auto 5.
7812000	7814000	You know what I was just thinking?
7814000	7820000	With that lip syncing thing, we are going to have a ton of machinima.
7820000	7822000	Well, they already have that in EverQuest too, remember?
7822000	7825000	They have that option, so it's definitely possible.
7825000	7828000	It'll be interesting to see.
7828000	7834000	And shit, if you can pull this stuff off with, and I'm assuming it's not Kinect,
7834000	7838000	why the fuck do you need Kinect for most of those voice command games anyway?
7838000	7840000	That's what I'm always wondering.
7840000	7842000	Bang, bang, bang, bang.
7842000	7844000	Grenade, grenade.
7844000	7846000	Why do you need Kinect for that?
7846000	7848000	Oh, I know, because you have to still Kinect.
7848000	7850000	You have to make a reason for it.
7850000	7855000	All right, well, more Xbox One confirmations and so forth coming out this week.
7855000	7861000	One thing that was coming out from General Manager of Console Development Leo Del Castillo
7861000	7867000	in an interview with Gizmodo said that the Xbox One will automatically detect if it's overheating
7867000	7870000	and will make adjustments to cool itself down.
7870000	7873000	This is, I guess, something that also happens with PCs.
7873000	7878000	They can dial back the power of the box considerably, forcing the system into a low power state
7878000	7880000	to correct any issues.
7880000	7885000	So the way they designed the box, they don't want to actually intend it to ever have to go to maximum speed
7885000	7888000	under normal environmental conditions, but there is overhead.
7888000	7891000	So we'll allow the fan to go all the way up to its maximum speed,
7891000	7895000	and if that solves the condition without the user having to do anything.
7895000	7901000	My assumption is that is to curb the three light special that affected most 360s
7901000	7905000	because the system was overheating, which, granted, they corrected later on,
7905000	7907000	which I thought was through a method similar to this.
7907000	7910000	Maybe Loki knows more about that. I don't know.
7910000	7917000	They had a thing on the, well, it was when it got really hot that that fan would kick up to 100%.
7917000	7920000	So they did have something like that, but usually at that point it's like,
7920000	7924000	eh, your system's kind of toasty right now.
7924000	7930000	So I don't know. It's not new, but the whole throttling the voltage down
7930000	7933000	and actually clocking the system down is kind of new.
7933000	7938000	And once again, it just reads as though they're talking.
7938000	7943000	It's like, okay, we've got to tell some, but let people know that it's not going to red ring.
7943000	7948000	I mean, even though their systems haven't been red ringing since the old...
7948000	7950000	It still haunts them a bit.
7950000	7952000	Well, yeah, of course it would.
7952000	7953000	As it should.
7953000	7957000	I was so traumatized when my Xbox stopped working and these three lights showed up.
7957000	7962000	Well, I think some things you have to consider when you're going to get an Xbox One is,
7962000	7964000	will Microsoft fuck up the hardware again?
7964000	7965000	First world problems.
7965000	7966000	Just saying.
7966000	7969000	All right. Moving on. DarkSakura.
7969000	7971000	Me? Why do I have to?
7971000	7974000	Okay, how about something for Minecraft fans?
7974000	7977000	Well, not really Minecraft fans, but people who like first person shooters
7977000	7980000	where you kill zombies.
7980000	7984000	Or actually you shoot undead cop zombies.
7984000	7990000	Notch put out a browser based zombie first person shooter game that's called Shambles.
7990000	8000000	And it was originally made for the 70 FPS, which was basically creators making a first person shooter in seven days.
8000000	8005000	And this one, basically, you have to collect yellow orbs that are dropped by dead zombies.
8005000	8009000	And the only way you get guns and ambos is to kill dead cops.
8009000	8012000	Well, I mean, is to get them from dead cops.
8012000	8017000	And the only way that you get health is to get first aid drops that are left by dead civilians.
8017000	8020000	So they're already dead, so I guess shooting them is okay.
8020000	8025000	However, you get shot at if you open fire on them, so it's really kind of a weird thing.
8025000	8027000	I don't know. Have you heard of this?
8027000	8031000	I just saw that he did a game jam game.
8031000	8033000	It was a FPS game jam game.
8033000	8035000	It was a seven day week long thing.
8035000	8038000	Yeah, it sounded interesting. I haven't played it.
8038000	8039000	It's browser based.
8039000	8041000	Well, I'm kind of interested because he did it in Unity.
8041000	8043000	And so, you know, that's what I'm working with right now.
8043000	8046000	So it'd be kind of interesting to check it out.
8046000	8049000	I like the style of his graphics.
8049000	8055000	It is kind of 90s FPS with the pre-rendered hand.
8055000	8059000	Oh, yeah, they're all very pixelated.
8059000	8061000	That's pretty sweet.
8061000	8064000	With, you know, shadowed out backgrounds and everything.
8064000	8068000	It's pretty interesting. I just like that the zombies are just green.
8069000	8073000	I'm surprised he didn't go with Minecraft zombies because that would have been even funnier.
8073000	8075000	Yeah, but that would be expected.
8079000	8081000	I like expected from him.
8084000	8087000	So, something else regarding Notch.
8087000	8091000	That one game, what was it? I don't remember what the hell it was called.
8091000	8092000	Oh, I love that one game.
8092000	8093000	The OX-10C.
8093000	8095000	I played it that time with these people.
8095000	8100000	His space game that was supposed to be kind of a, not a sequel to Minecraft,
8100000	8104000	but still sandbox-ish and procedurally generated.
8104000	8110000	But anyways, he has decided to go ahead and stop development on it.
8110000	8112000	Basically shelving it.
8112000	8116000	This is due to kind of a creative block they had with the game.
8116000	8124000	However, he was saying though that there are some fans that are actually interested in carrying on into the project.
8125000	8131000	Basically saying that they're not using any of his old code or his name or anything.
8131000	8140000	That they're going to just kind of, I guess based on what he had, sort of create a new game.
8140000	8146000	Not really with the story and stuff, but just kind of a new concept with the original idea.
8147000	8148000	I don't know.
8149000	8157000	Which the original idea did sound kind of neat, so I was a little sad to see it go, but if he doesn't want to do it, it is what it is.
8157000	8160000	Yeah, I mean that's fine I guess to be inspired by them.
8160000	8164000	They're saying they're calling it Project Trillic for now.
8164000	8174000	And no idea what exactly they're going to be doing with it other than they're saying that they're not planning on selling it once it's released.
8174000	8179000	But, I don't know, it would be interesting to see.
8179000	8186000	I still didn't really understand what the whole game was about other than I know that you could create your own ship and then you could visit planets and stuff.
8186000	8194000	I don't know, it wasn't Minecraft, but it was some sort of crafting into it and you can program stuff.
8194000	8202000	I don't know, it was just very high concept, but I didn't really understand how it would play I guess.
8204000	8208000	And now I never will because it's not going to work.
8208000	8210000	It will come from somebody else now.
8210000	8216000	Alright, well let's talk about another Kickstarter project because this is where a lot of studios are getting funding now.
8216000	8222000	But this is an interesting project of note because this involves Japanese developers turning to Kickstarter.
8222000	8227000	One of them involved is the legendary Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Imatsu.
8227000	8235000	What they're launching on Kickstarter is called Project Phoenix and it is an indie JRPG that is trying to be developed.
8235000	8241000	The group behind it is Creative Intelligence Arts, it's a Tokyo-based company.
8241000	8247000	And they do also Eminent Symphony Orchestra that does video game and anime arrangement stuff.
8247000	8254000	Hiroaki Yura will be the director and producer on Project Phoenix whereas Imatsu will score the title.
8254000	8261000	It's not strictly Japanese developers because LA Noire game designer Vaughn Smith is supposed to be a part of it.
8261000	8272000	But also fantasy novelist Yoko Inoki, concept artist in Final Fantasy Kiyoshi Arai, sound engineer John Kurlander who worked on Lord of the Rings and Elder Scrolls V Skyrim.
8272000	8275000	So they kind of have this team together, but now they just need the money to pay them.
8275000	8281000	So they say this will be a JRPG with squad-based real-time strategy game design.
8281000	8285000	It's going to be for Windows PC, Mac, and Linux via Steam.
8285000	8290000	And they're hoping to also launch maybe some type of different limited version for iOS and Android.
8290000	8294000	Possibly a PlayStation 4 port if the group gets enough funding.
8294000	8302000	Well they got their funding pretty quick. They wanted $100,000 to do this with 23 days to go, five times that amount.
8302000	8305000	They have over half a million in their Kickstarter for this right now.
8305000	8307000	I got lost when they said it was a real-time strategy.
8307000	8310000	A squad-based RTS game, but yeah.
8310000	8311000	That just is not fun.
8311000	8313000	No Uematsu will do the music.
8313000	8315000	I'll take the soundtrack, but I won't play the game.
8315000	8321000	So let's see some of the stretch goals. Double the amount of character in Monster Models, and Uematsu will do more music.
8321000	8327000	So they've hit that goal. They're going to fight inside the Kraken if they make a million.
8327000	8329000	I don't know what that even means.
8329000	8335000	But alright. Congrats to those guys for getting their funding. I hope the game's great.
8335000	8336000	Huzzah!
8336000	8338000	You got to make a game that Jamie wants to play.
8338000	8342000	Yeah, make it a standard RPG with lots of shooting.
8342000	8345000	Go to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
8345000	8349000	Dark Tetsuya says, hey, we're at least guaranteed an epic soundtrack on this.
8349000	8350000	That is true.
8350000	8351000	Heck yeah.
8351000	8357000	A game I mentioned in the first half that I'm going to mention again because it was so horrifically underlooked.
8357000	8365000	Lost Odyssey had an amazing soundtrack as well, and I believe Uematsu did a lot of the music for that game.
8365000	8367000	Didn't he?
8367000	8369000	To the Google Cave!
8369000	8370000	I believe he did.
8370000	8375000	I think he did because Mistwalker, he was a part of that, wasn't he? Or I should say is.
8377000	8379000	But the music sounds right.
8379000	8382000	I'm looking it up real quick. Yes, he did do the music.
8382000	8387000	I just had that moment of shit.
8387000	8391000	He did do the music, right?
8392000	8398000	Anyhow, let's get into this music that means it is time for the mailbag.
8402000	8406000	Mailbag at orangelaundrydo.com is the place where you can send us emails.
8406000	8410000	Dark Soccer will dive into the mailbag and hopefully pull out some letters worth reading.
8410000	8411000	Deleting a spam.
8411000	8413000	It's been really bad.
8413000	8416000	I'm going to tell you guys, we will be changing that address soon.
8416000	8421000	Actually, we need to start using Gmail service for our mail project.
8421000	8423000	But you have to pay for that now, so...
8423000	8424000	Nah.
8424000	8426000	We'll talk off air.
8426000	8430000	Anyway, I'll start with a short one.
8430000	8433000	This is from Nark.
8433000	8444000	Since you had such a fun time playing Team Fortress 2, I thought I'd put in a plug for a Team Fortress 2 light game that's still in beta but definitely ready for prime time loadout.
8444000	8446000	Keep up the fun, casting Nark.
8446000	8448000	I've heard of loadout.
8448000	8450000	And we need to do another Epic Team Fortress 2 night.
8450000	8453000	People ask me, like, well, when do people actually play on the server?
8453000	8456000	It's there for you guys to get together.
8456000	8460000	Talk on Twitter and the forums and so forth and make something happen.
8460000	8466000	I myself, um, maybe will be there tonight, but I don't want to promise that.
8466000	8469000	So, um, probably during the week next week.
8469000	8470000	There'll be a night.
8470000	8472000	We just need to have a set-aside night.
8472000	8474000	Maybe after Hoard House on Wednesday or something.
8474000	8476000	Next email?
8476000	8477000	Yep.
8477000	8479000	I downloaded DuckTales on the PSN.
8479000	8484000	It plays fine, but I can't help but think the game probably looks better in the original 8-bit.
8484000	8487000	Since you guys played the original, how does it compare?
8487000	8489000	By the way, I love the animation in the vaults. It made me smile.
8489000	8491000	And that's from Rababa.
8491000	8494000	I haven't played the original in a very long time.
8494000	8496000	But from what I remember...
8496000	8497000	Well, I think, you know...
8497000	8498000	It's 8-bit.
8498000	8501000	I think I touched on a lot of this at the top of the show.
8501000	8504000	They did change some of the mechanics, and there's the new levels and stuff.
8504000	8508000	And when you're actually playing the game, the gameplay feels pretty good.
8508000	8511000	But there's all these cutscenes that were not...
8511000	8515000	I mean, the original did have cutscenes, but they weren't the same.
8515000	8517000	The poses are the same.
8517000	8522000	I mean, I thought that the new animation frames really harkened back to the original.
8522000	8524000	I did love the way it looked.
8524000	8526000	Yeah, it's really pretty.
8527000	8530000	You know what warmed my heart in such a lovely way?
8530000	8532000	Is hearing June 4A.
8532000	8534000	And I didn't mean to rhyme, but it did.
8534000	8535000	No, that was...
8535000	8536000	I love her so much!
8536000	8541000	I hate bagging on the sound, because I don't want to make it sound like it's the actor's fault.
8541000	8544000	It is not, and I'm so happy they got back together, but it's just...
8544000	8549000	I really need to hear the console one, because it sounded fine on Dan's computer.
8549000	8550000	Well, anyway...
8550000	8552000	It could have been his speakers. I don't know.
8552000	8553000	So I think I got...
8553000	8557000	Rababa, if I missed something, shoot us another email. I'll clarify.
8557000	8559000	Now the jungle music is stuck in my head.
8560000	8562000	Why not the moon music? That's the best music.
8562000	8565000	Because the fortune cookie will explain it.
8568000	8569000	The fortune cookie will explain it.
8570000	8571000	Next email.
8571000	8572000	Hi, O.L.R.
8572000	8576000	With all the various policy reversals being done for the Xbone,
8576000	8579000	you've got people around the net saying,
8579000	8582000	Alright haters, Microsoft heard you, now will you get the Xbox?
8582000	8585000	Dumb fanboys will, of course, and come up with stupid shit like,
8585000	8590000	The power brick is huge, and I believe there are lesser known points that should be brought to light.
8590000	8593000	Please feel free to correct me and offer counterpoints.
8593000	8595000	By the way, this is coming from the Nasty Canasta.
8596000	8597000	One of my favorite names.
8597000	8598000	I know.
8598000	8603000	First, I cannot help but think about the security breach that unfortunately affected Rab.
8603000	8607000	Yes, Sony had their breach too, and when you consider everything that happened between Sony and Microsoft,
8607000	8609000	it's like trying to figure out the lesser of two evils.
8609000	8615000	But Microsoft tried to keep things under the rug and didn't seem like they were taking things seriously,
8615000	8616000	which is utter bullshit.
8617000	8623000	Rob, would you please briefly recap what you went through so I can point people to this episode about the incident?
8624000	8626000	No, go through the archive. No, I'm kidding.
8627000	8632000	So, yeah, even though the Sony service was hacked some time ago, we all know how that went down,
8632000	8635000	I don't know anybody who lost money on the Playstation.
8635000	8641000	Not that that excuses what happened, because that was horrible, but I didn't actually lose money.
8641000	8648000	But what did happen is that somebody else signed into my account and bought a bunch of stuff,
8648000	8650000	bought those FIFA, like FIFA gold packs, something like that.
8650000	8656000	They ran up, I don't even remember how much it was at this point, I want to say it was about $100, ran up.
8656000	8657000	No, it wasn't like...
8657000	8660000	It wasn't astronomical, but it was certainly enough where I missed it.
8660000	8661000	It was something recoverable.
8661000	8672000	Yeah, but they had taken this money, and I was always convinced, and I've never not been convinced of this,
8672000	8678000	that the link was between EA and EA's online services, because it seems like everybody who was losing money
8678000	8682000	was losing it to some sort of EA game, be it FIFA or something else, that they were going in and getting the money
8682000	8688000	and linking my account to their pre-origin EA online service.
8688000	8692000	Somebody linked my account to one of those, and so I had to call Microsoft.
8692000	8698000	They took care of it and did what they had to do, but there was a couple days I was out that money,
8698000	8702000	and it was really infuriating, kind of violating.
8702000	8706000	And when that happened to you, the first thing I did was sign up for that EA account thing so that I could...
8706000	8710000	Yes, because I told all the listeners, I said, if you sign up for that, then they can't do it for you.
8710000	8711000	Exactly.
8711000	8713000	So I remember doing that.
8713000	8720000	But lots of people I know, like people who hadn't even touched their Xbox in forever were getting hacked like that.
8720000	8728000	And everybody would say, oh, well, Rob, you're stupid, you fell for one of those fishing sites or somewhere,
8728000	8733000	and I'm just kind of sitting here going, I'm not going to sit here and say, that would never happen to me,
8733000	8739000	because I'm not going to be that full of myself that I can't think I might make a mistake once in a while.
8739000	8743000	But I think it says something when people who haven't even used their Xboxes in so long
8743000	8748000	and would have no interest in going to any website online were also having their money taken.
8748000	8753000	And I kind of always, when Microsoft came out and said, oh, everybody's just getting phished.
8753000	8755000	That's the problem. We have a real phishing problem.
8755000	8758000	I'm kind of sitting here going, bullshit, bullshit.
8758000	8760000	And that kind of pissed me off.
8760000	8764000	And have I forgiven them for it?
8764000	8766000	I guess. It's been a long time.
8766000	8768000	Have I forgotten? Hell no.
8768000	8773000	And I try very hard not to save my credit card information or any of that anymore.
8773000	8776000	Well, there's always lessons to be learned from any experience.
8776000	8778000	Moving on.
8778000	8781000	Second, putting free apps behind the gold paywall.
8781000	8787000	I outright refuse to support a service that requires you to pay to use a program freely available elsewhere.
8787000	8791000	No matter what features and perks are available, you should not have to pay and continue paying Microsoft
8791000	8793000	just so you can watch Netflix or Hulu.
8793000	8795000	That's why I have my computer.
8796000	8800000	Lastly, Microsoft has a muddy reputation when it comes to indie developers.
8800000	8805000	In the past, we've had indies like Team Meat and Phil Fish comments on how Microsoft poorly treated them
8805000	8809000	when it came to handling advertising and patches on the Xbox marketplace.
8809000	8813000	And while the recent change to self-publishing is good, we have Retro City Rampage creator,
8813000	8822000	Brian, I can never pronounce his name, Provinciano, stating to develop that Microsoft's indie development program
8823000	8829000	is not on par with what other companies offer and there are strings attached with the change to self-publishing.
8829000	8836000	Hearing all this makes me assume that the once digital-only offerings won't be as numerous as the PS4s.
8836000	8838000	That's a nasty canasta.
8838000	8842000	And just checking, no more email. That's it.
8844000	8845000	So...
8845000	8849000	Sorry, I got distracted with a private message, but there was something else in that email I wanted to reply to
8849000	8854000	and I read it before the show. Can you recap the last two points?
8854000	8855000	I closed it.
8856000	8861000	One of them was about how poorly they treat the indie developers and how they're strings attached
8861000	8864000	and they're not very user-friendly and not receptive.
8864000	8867000	And then... Oh, thank you.
8867000	8871000	The stuff being behind the gold paywall. Yeah, that's stupid.
8873000	8875000	I don't know what else to say.
8876000	8878000	That is going to make the decision.
8878000	8887000	I would point at the Facebook commenter earlier who said the dad bought the PlayStation 3 just for the Blu-ray and the Netflix Hulu.
8888000	8893000	If they have to buy an extra subscription, you're not going to sell an Xbox One to that individual.
8893000	8897000	So, especially when you can do Netflix online for free.
8897000	8903000	Granted, yes, you pay the subscription, but I'm talking about the viewer itself is on any Internet Explorer window for free.
8903000	8906000	Microsoft probably shouldn't gate that shit.
8906000	8915000	As far as the indie developers go, you know, Microsoft could make it right and they are moving in that direction.
8915000	8921000	Even though Team Meat and Phil Fish are some of the louder indie developers out there, they're not the only ones.
8921000	8924000	And, you know, Microsoft could, let's be real,
8924000	8930000	Microsoft could throw a ton of money at other indies to get exclusives and make it right, so to speak.
8930000	8938000	So, I really don't know what that's going to look like until we see what the release calendar looks like.
8938000	8944000	But I want to say, didn't we talk about last week that they have talked about that the store is going to kind of intermix everything?
8944000	8948000	The indies and big games and all that are all going to be mixed together.
8948000	8953000	So, I mean, it does sound like they are trying to take steps to be better than they are now.
8953000	8958000	So, I think Microsoft does realize they done fucked up and they're going in the other direction.
8958000	8961000	And I think Microsoft should be giving some credit for that.
8961000	8971000	I mean, they are giving all these bitches what they wanted, you know, at the sacrifice of potentially moving gaming in this new vision or this new direction, whether it be right or wrong.
8971000	8977000	You know, they're going back to what works for people now.
8977000	8983000	So, I kind of don't want to keep dogging them for doing that.
8983000	8991000	Now, it is really going to be about the games and that $100 price difference between the two systems, which you never know.
8991000	8998000	We could still hear that whole, now they may remove it, who knows, or take a loss to drop the price if they're that desperate enough.
8998000	9001000	I don't know. I kind of don't think that will happen.
9001000	9007000	But here's what I could see them doing, you know, as kind of a helping thing is bundling software with it.
9007000	9013000	Bundling software or including a year of gold would be a huge thing too.
9013000	9015000	That would be a super easy thing.
9015000	9017000	It still wouldn't be enough for some people.
9017000	9021000	It wouldn't, but it would definitely sweeten the pot and make it a lot more attractive.
9021000	9032000	It's just like the Wii U needs to drop their fucking price already and all they have to do is remove the basic set and make the deluxe set the only set and make it the basic price.
9033000	9043000	I think what they're planning on doing with the Wii U, I think they're playing it cool right now because they're wanting to see how the new software, these big titles that they have coming out, are what the uptick is going to be with that.
9043000	9046000	Because if that does it alone, then they don't need to drop the price.
9046000	9049000	If that doesn't do it, then they may drop the price.
9049000	9052000	I think that's what they're waiting on is to see how it does it.
9052000	9057000	But the longer you wait, the more it's going to suffer.
9058000	9063000	Anyhow, that's it. I think I've said enough in response to that email.
9063000	9067000	So mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com if you want to email us in the future.
9067000	9071000	Let's move on, although we are going to look into changing that this week.
9071000	9074000	So this might be the last week of that, but you can send it there for now and be safe.
9074000	9076000	Mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com.
9076000	9078000	I don't think we'll be getting rid of it immediately.
9078000	9083000	No, but having a break coming up with Labor Day would be a great time to change it too.
9083000	9086000	Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week. It's that time.
9086000	9088000	No, we should change it to your ass.
9088000	9091000	So you can email your ass at Orangelaunchradio.com.
9091000	9092000	Don't get crazy.
9108000	9111000	I have an FU. It's to every fucking thing.
9112000	9119000	Well, not everything, but a lot of stuff. I'm just, I'm still kind of fucked off over that whole job thing.
9119000	9124000	But then again, I don't want to work for bigots, so I'm of two minds.
9124000	9132000	And FU to Bubba Gump Shrimp Company, because I had your delicious fish and chips and it murdered me.
9132000	9137000	I was sick for days after that and eat nothing but almond butter and honey.
9137000	9140000	Which is true. I ate nothing but almond butter and honey for two days.
9140000	9142000	And grapes. Grapes are good.
9142000	9147000	But just, a big pile of fuckery is abounding and I'm getting sick of it.
9147000	9155000	It needs to be, someone needs to take out the leaf blower thing and blow it out of my life.
9155000	9158000	I'm done. So sick of this shit.
9159000	9160000	Loki?
9161000	9173000	FU to, well, to my work because once again, one of our reps left and they're not hiring another person to take that person's spot.
9173000	9182000	And so then I have a ton more work I have to do and a lot more accounts I have to handle and no additional compensation.
9182000	9183000	Convince them to hire me.
9183000	9186000	Nope, they're not going to hire anybody, so not going to happen.
9186000	9187000	I'll drug them.
9187000	9189000	It's not going to happen.
9190000	9196000	And then also FU to, whoever it is in my neighborhood that's firing off mortars in the middle of the night.
9196000	9199000	It's like, wow, it's like, what the hell are you doing?
9199000	9204000	It's not fucking fourth of July. Why are you firing off mortars at like one in the morning?
9206000	9207000	People. What are you going to do?
9207000	9209000	Because people are invading.
9210000	9214000	My FU of the week goes to drama. I don't want none.
9214000	9220000	And if you try to bring drama into my life, you will not be as big of a part of my life.
9220000	9222000	So keep your trauma away from me.
9222000	9224000	Thank you and good night.
9229000	9230000	All right.
9230000	9231000	All right.
9232000	9233000	That's it.
9233000	9236000	Let's talk a little bit more Nintendo.
9236000	9244000	They had a lawsuit that was brought against them for their infringement of a 3D display patent.
9244000	9248000	And this is, of course, with the 3DS.
9248000	9259000	And they have, though, managed to reduce the, I guess, a reduction of what they were going to have to pay.
9259000	9263000	So now it's down to thirty point two million dollars.
9263000	9276000	And they're saying that also possibly there says maybe even being able to reduce it to even less than that.
9276000	9280000	So I don't know.
9280000	9283000	It sounds like maybe the evidence.
9283000	9291000	They were saying that is, I guess, unsupported by the evidence presented at the trial.
9291000	9297000	So maybe they were having a hard case and, you know, saying that they violated rights or not.
9297000	9307000	But either way, though, less money having to be awarded means that they can print more of those 90 dollar copies of Xenoblade Chronicles.
9307000	9312000	All right.
9312000	9315000	One more story for you guys, and then we're going to open up the Skype line.
9315000	9320000	One eight seven seven game O.L.R., our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
9320000	9324000	Again, that's one eight seven seven game O.L.R., Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
9324000	9327000	But we have to talk about this, our last story for tonight.
9327000	9330000	More erotic Oculus Rift games.
9330000	9333000	This is what we really want the Oculus Rift for.
9333000	9337000	This is the future right here is porn, porn, porn.
9338000	9352000	So anyway, let's see, 3D Heaven is one that's being worked on, apparently, which is a detailed full body 3D scans, which would be like, I guess, a nude model that you can just kind of look at.
9352000	9356000	Look at our boobies, look all around and look at our boobies everywhere.
9356000	9358000	Try to reach out and touch the boobies.
9358000	9362000	They give you like, depending on how you bend your head and stuff.
9362000	9366000	Damn!
9366000	9368000	Let's see what else there is here.
9368000	9371000	ThryX Games Chat House 3D.
9371000	9376000	It's real time chat client software called Chat House 3D.
9376000	9383000	And I guess it's like a voyeur mode or whatever and you can, I guess, chat with babes and maybe they'll take their top off.
9383000	9385000	I don't know.
9385000	9389000	But whatever, it's all in the real, real vision, the Oculus Rift.
9389000	9396000	3DX Chat is a multiplayer erotic game that is supposed to have Oculus Rift support.
9396000	9399000	It's called the first 3D sex game with Oculus Rift support.
9399000	9404000	There's also added support for the V-Stroker adult accessory.
9404000	9407000	Do you have a V-Stroker, Loki?
9407000	9409000	No, I do not have a V-Stroker.
9409000	9410000	Why don't you Google that?
9410000	9412000	And sadly enough, I know what that is.
9412000	9414000	Is it like a flashlight? Really, what is it?
9414000	9417000	It is like a flashlight thing, but it actually, it's USB powered.
9417000	9422000	Vrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.
9422000	9424000	Eh.
9424000	9426000	It's your handle, never get tired.
9426000	9430000	It's masturbation for the lazy.
9430000	9433000	Move my hand back for it, that's just too much work.
9433000	9437000	I got a hand cramp, somebody get me my V-Stroker.
9440000	9442000	Mom! V-Stroker!
9444000	9445000	Okie dokie.
9445000	9447000	Mommy I have to have the V-Stroker.
9451000	9453000	Shut up Rob, you're 35.
9453000	9455000	Jim Sully wants one, whatever it is.
9455000	9457000	They don't make them in Canada.
9460000	9462000	Ok, I have to digress in a second.
9462000	9465000	Because they have something in Canada on the app store that I wish we had here.
9465000	9466000	Alright.
9466000	9468000	It's where you can be a parking attendant.
9468000	9473000	And take pictures of people who park badly, record their license plate number.
9473000	9477000	And then you get whatever their parking violation fee is, you get like up to 40% of it.
9477000	9478000	That's fucking awesome.
9478000	9479000	Oh my god!
9479000	9480000	We need this here!
9480000	9481000	We need this here immediately!
9481000	9482000	I know right?
9482000	9484000	I posted it on Facebook a while back.
9484000	9486000	Yeah but there would be so many complaints.
9486000	9487000	Who cares?
9487000	9490000	It's America and I can park bad if I want.
9490000	9493000	I'll sue you because you misreported me.
9493000	9494000	Yeah but that's the thing though.
9494000	9496000	You moved my car when I wasn't looking.
9496000	9500000	And the other thing that Canada has is Canada's worst driver, just saying.
9500000	9501000	That shows awesome.
9501000	9503000	There was an America's worst driver you know.
9503000	9505000	It lasted one season because it fucked it up.
9505000	9509000	Well do you know who won America's worst driver?
9509000	9511000	The guy who started GamerX.
9511000	9512000	Really?
9512000	9513000	That's funny.
9513000	9514000	As long as he's not driving.
9514000	9517000	In one of those weird it's a small world kind of things.
9517000	9521000	But for the record Canada's worst driver is awesome because it's actually educational.
9523000	9525000	I haven't seen either one.
9525000	9526000	Oh my god it's so good.
9526000	9527000	Alright.
9527000	9529000	It's like the only reality show I like.
9529000	9530000	Alright.
9532000	9533000	Let's see.
9534000	9535000	Was that it?
9535000	9537000	Yeah that's it for the Oculus Rift games.
9537000	9538000	That's enough.
9538000	9540000	We learned what a Vstroker is thanks to this so.
9540000	9542000	Alright we are going to go to the Skype line.
9542000	9544000	1877 Game OLR.
9544000	9546000	Our username on Skype is OrangeLaunchRadio.
9546000	9548000	The phones are open for business.
9548000	9549000	So give us a call.
9549000	9551000	Meanwhile I'll get to Twitter topics in a minute here.
9551000	9554000	But I wanted to check with Loki if there's any last minute stories.
9554000	9555000	Not really.
9555000	9559000	I thought honestly it was kind of a slow week.
9559000	9561000	But let's see.
9562000	9566000	Yeah there's not a whole lot going on this week.
9568000	9569000	I don't know.
9569000	9571000	We can talk more about Grand Theft Auto 5.
9571000	9573000	Hey you want to talk about Grand Theft Auto 5?
9575000	9576000	Acute Games.
9576000	9578000	They've got a new visualizer that's coming to the PS3.
9578000	9583000	So you can get something other than the rotating globe.
9583000	9585000	Alright you're saved by phone calls on the Skype line.
9585000	9587000	So let's go to the Skype line.
9587000	9589000	1877 Game OLR.
9589000	9591000	Our username on Skype is OrangeLaunchRadio.
9591000	9592000	But we do have a call.
9592000	9593000	Hi you're on OrangeLaunchRadio.
9593000	9594000	Who's this?
9594000	9595000	It's Ranma.
9595000	9596000	Hey Ranma.
9596000	9597000	How you doing?
9597000	9598000	I'm doing good.
9598000	9599000	How about you?
9599000	9603000	I'm enlightened now that I know what a Vstroker is.
9603000	9604000	What's up?
9604000	9605000	Not too much.
9605000	9608000	I just wanted to say a couple things about last week's podcast.
9608000	9610000	I believe it was.
9610000	9612000	Because I was kind of on the road at the time so.
9612000	9615000	Oh right you're coming back from one of your many conventions.
9615000	9618000	Yes I am such the convention whore.
9618000	9620000	You really are but that's why we love you.
9620000	9623000	Well do you have a, are you now immune to all the confunks?
9625000	9626000	No.
9626000	9632000	We'll never be immune to the confunk, the con plague, or con anything.
9632000	9637000	There was a special breed of it though that was out around final May 2001 called the Dorbola.
9637000	9640000	People in TBR Freak remember that.
9643000	9645000	What's on your mind regarding last week's show?
9645000	9650000	Well I just want to say Rob, I really appreciate what you said about GamerX.
9650000	9659000	Because a lot of what you said reminds me of some of the conversations I've had with cosplayers, con goers at anime conventions.
9659000	9668000	Because a lot of what you were talking about you kind of find there because of like similar fans of anime, different genres and so forth.
9668000	9673000	You know to kind of get together and like understand and like relate to what it is.
9673000	9676000	No they all get together and bash the homestucks.
9678000	9684000	Let's not because if we're going to go that direction nobody's getting on this skype line so let's not.
9684000	9685000	Yeah.
9686000	9693000	But anyway you're right so kind of how like having a safe place for you know like minded individuals absolutely.
9693000	9695000	Yep yep definitely.
9695000	9698000	So that's kind of is that the thrill that you get at anime conventions?
9699000	9708000	Part of it yeah because I mean I ain't going to lie ever since I had this VOG shirt my desire to cosplay has kind of cut down a lot.
9708000	9714000	I still cosplay mostly for like meetups and stuff but I just like wearing a shirt that has who I'm representing and who I am.
9714000	9722000	And I'm taking pictures and handing out cards you know it's like well this is where I want to be and I'm happy where I am.
9722000	9727000	You know that's funny because I was thinking like oh I got to cosplay for I got to cosplay for Dragon Con.
9727000	9733000	I got to think of a cosplay like I can't let Travis out I can't let Travis outshine me even though he totally will with that awesome costume.
9733000	9738000	I got to figure out what I'm going to do but then I'm like well I should just wear my VOG shirt honestly.
9738000	9739000	Rob.
9739000	9740000	What?
9740000	9745000	No no no you and I are fighting someone with a sewing machine and we're making your damn Joker costume.
9745000	9747000	Yeah in two weeks good luck.
9747000	9751000	Hey Evan and I made my Baiken costume in three days.
9751000	9752000	Fair enough.
9752000	9757000	Well come on Rob you could be we can send you a Black Mage costume.
9757000	9760000	I did like that costume that was a lot of fun.
9760000	9763000	But I do have an idea for a perfect costume for you.
9763000	9771000	You should go to Dragon Con dressed as Jesus with a rainbow sash and just walk around with a glass of water.
9771000	9774000	Wouldn't that be a glass of wine?
9774000	9778000	Exactly.
9778000	9785000	I don't want to offend people though and you know going to the deep south you know although Dragon Con is a certain crowd.
9785000	9787000	You're not going to offend them.
9787000	9794000	I have gone to conventions where people in the center where people have dressed up as Jesus walking around with the little Arby's logo above their head.
9794000	9796000	Rob should be Buddy Christ.
9796000	9798000	Better.
9798000	9805000	The most hilarious thing I thought about doing because I don't here's the thing I don't want to have to keep shaving my fucking beard off for costumes.
9805000	9810000	So whatever I dress up as I really want to have a mustache and beard so I thought about maybe doing Tingle.
9810000	9815000	But I don't want to have to.
9815000	9820000	I don't know I don't know I don't want I don't necessarily want pictures of me like that on the internet.
9820000	9821000	Joker's cool.
9821000	9823000	Joker I'll have pictures of me as Joker on the internet.
9823000	9826000	You know what I think you should do if you did the Joker costume?
9826000	9829000	You should do the first Mass Effect uniform.
9829000	9830000	Sure.
9830000	9831000	Because that one I think is a cool one.
9831000	9834000	Yeah.
9835000	9839000	Brad from Pod Culture says that wouldn't bother anyone and Blackwell says my friend cosplayed as Buddy Christ.
9839000	9843000	I underestimate the crowd at Dragon Con clearly.
9843000	9845000	Maybe just wear a bathrobe and be the dude.
9845000	9848000	I want to be offended at Dragon Con.
9848000	9850000	I really hope cosplay pushes the envelope.
9850000	9851000	I know I know I know.
9851000	9855000	We get you leather undies and you can go like Final Fantasy 11 outfit.
9855000	9856000	No.
9856000	9857000	No.
9857000	9858000	No.
9858000	9859000	And let me check my iPad.
9859000	9860000	No.
9861000	9866000	Well if we're going the route of leather we can just smoke this hard gay razor Ramon.
9866000	9868000	But Rob would have to shave for that.
9868000	9875000	I don't think I like where this conversation's going so you need to change the topic or get the hell off the phone.
9875000	9878000	We'll find you something good.
9878000	9879000	Alright.
9879000	9881000	Okay alright well changing topics I'm getting out of here.
9881000	9882000	Alright.
9882000	9886000	Well in case you haven't heard I am officially a college graduate.
9886000	9887000	Congratulations.
9887000	9888000	Mazel tov.
9888000	9889000	Thank you.
9889000	9895000	And in regards to that in one of my classes we had to do a term paper about an invention.
9895000	9902000	So and it was like minimum of five pages so I sat there after drinking thinking about it and pushing myself.
9902000	9907000	I pretty much shat out an eight page term paper on the history of the Nintendo Entertainment System.
9907000	9908000	Nice.
9910000	9911000	That's awesome.
9911000	9912000	Awesome.
9912000	9919000	So I have to say by the way because I'm coming up on another degree this semester just because I've changed my major so many times.

10117000	10121000	Yeah when I was there was a rough time in my life when I was about 12 years old 11 12
10121000	10126000	my parents split up and I'd have to go see my dad every two weeks and it kind of sucked
10126000	10130000	but every two weeks I went to go see him I would get to go to the one store in town that
10130000	10133000	rented Sega games because there's only one store in town that rented them and sure enough
10133000	10139000	one day I got there and I found Phantasy Star it was a four mega cartridge or something
10139000	10142000	it was called it was the only one they had right it was a big deal if you get the four
10142000	10148000	mega cartridge and I picked up this weirdo Japanese RPG game and I wasn't really into
10148000	10150000	them because I was only 12 or it wasn't really a cool thing to do.
10150000	10151000	Right.
10151000	10154000	But I brought it home and I played it all weekend and I was like astonished at how awesome
