13750	19572	Tonight, August 18, 2013, several more changes are announced that will affect the launch of the Xbox One.
19932	26394	GameStop defends a high price for used copies of Xenoblade and Metroid Prime, and more details emerge on Grand Theft Auto V.
31670	33291	Hello, my friends out there on the internet.
33331	35994	Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36074	38956	It's Orange Lounge Radio, episode 516.
40538	49185	For this, August the 18th of 2013, we're here to talk about video games, gaming culture, gamer lifestyle, with me, Rob Roberts.
49265	54369	I'm one of your hosts, and joining me, as she does every Sunday night, say hello to Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers.
54950	55330	Yo.
55610	57672	How you doing, Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers?
58413	58493	Or...
59955	60876	and... All of the above.
61116	61536	Whatever.
61917	63318	You can be whoever you want to be.
64499	66180	Oh, I'll be me.
66200	66981	Okay.
67321	69122	Well, you do... I'm really out of it today.
69282	69603	Yeah?
69903	71964	Yeah, it's been a weird, weird week.
72405	74326	Are you on any prescription medications right now?
74346	79830	Well, I'm always on prescription medications that keep me from killing people on the internet.
81252	84434	No, but I mean, like, are you... No, no OxyContin.
84474	85635	Six or anything?
85815	86976	Any sickness going around?
87839	90001	I have the rockin' pneumonia and the boogie-woogie flu.
91082	91682	Sorry to hear it.
92223	92803	No, I'm not.
92823	94465	That means I'm happy, I guess.
94525	95706	An apparently obscure reference.
95866	97587	Oh, and there's Techmaster Loki.
97627	98308	How you doing, Loki?
98728	99329	I'm doing fine.
99429	99729	Yeah?
100049	100249	Yeah.
100329	100870	What's new with you?
100890	100930	Um...
103712	104093	Games.
104453	105454	Yeah, lots of games.
105674	110079	We'll get to Gaming Weeks here shortly, but I noticed you brought a big box full of Disney Infinity with you.
110219	110419	Yes.
110880	117908	So I noticed that you were able to get the game early through your connections, and you put up a YouTube, right?
117928	122673	You did a little unboxing YouTube, because information on Disney Infinity has been kind of not...
122933	123913	around, really.
124413	131235	The review embargo apparently didn't lift until today, or they didn't have early reviews or something.
131295	137137	Maybe they were afraid the game wasn't going to get good reviews, although it seems like it's doing all right from the minimal things I've seen today.
138057	143679	So you did this whole unboxing, you did some playing, and hilarious stuff going down on YouTube, right?
144179	146139	Yeah, just typical YouTube commenters.
147500	147920	Demanding...
149488	152331	You need to tell me how you got that or else I'm going to report you.
152592	153032	To who?
153433	154053	The police?
155375	157958	I'm playing this game before I have it.
159219	160301	It's like, whatever.
161662	168010	I would have actually done some more actual Let's Plays and stuff, but I just...
168690	169791	I thought you did, I thought you were up on...
190152	216988	Audio, I was trying to split the audio going to the TV So split it between the video capture card and my headset But when I did that, because I needed an amp on it When I did that, there was no audio coming through at all So tech issues Yeah, tech issues So I ended up just listening through my computer But the audio was lagged by a second or so So it was just a little annoying
217560	224745	Well, not to tap into your gaming week too much, although I'm sure you've played plenty else besides Disney Infinity, but what did you think overall of Disney Infinity?
225185	228947	It's alright, because I hadn't really played Skylanders.
230048	233270	I checked out just the beginning.
233290	239634	I did a couple of the tutorials, walking through some of the sandbox or the toy box stuff.
240155	245238	It's okay, but you don't start off with a whole lot of pieces to build with the toy box stuff.
246058	251060	Um, some of that you get through, like, these little power-up disc things that you can buy.
251860	253741	Um, not a whole ton of that stuff.
253781	255942	A lot of it's just kind of cosmetic.
256262	259523	Like, you know, it looks like Alice in Wonderland or Little Nemo.
259783	261003	It's just, it's really kind of eh.
261644	262684	Um, there's...
264403	280141	they have some pre-built stuff that you can look at but a lot of it you have to play through the actual they call them the play sets so like the story campaigns I guess for each of the characters so I've been playing through Pirates of the Caribbean which is alright it
282136	285358	I don't know, it's definitely a kid's game, so it's geared towards that.
285459	287520	Well, I was going to ask you, what did your young one think of it?
287540	289021	Did you let him kind of watch?
289702	293825	He didn't really get to watch play, because the only time I get to play is when he's gone to bed.
294265	296447	Yeah, and he might be a little too young, too.
296467	300890	Like at three, you don't really... He doesn't really understand how to use controllers and stuff yet, but he liked the figures.
300950	305033	He took all the Cars figures and put them on this little table with his cars and stuff and was playing with them.
306294	307315	So there's that.
309115	318898	And that's kind of how I got it, too, is because I'd mentioned to my friend at Disney that my son was really into, like, he loved Mater.
318918	324680	I was trying to get Mater figures, what I was trying to do, and they ended up just sending me everything to play with the Mater figures.
324720	327881	So, the game, the Cars playset, and Mater figures.
328061	332563	So what all, because I'm having a hard time understanding, like, what all crap are they selling with this?
332603	334763	Because with Skylanders, it's just the figures.
334824	335764	That's really the only stuff they sell.
335784	337585	Oh, no, in the Skylanders, it's not just the figures.
337665	338685	Originally, it was.
338745	348989	Yeah, because Skylanders, like, okay, so Skylanders, they have, you know, and they have a lot, a lot of it is figures, but it's so crazy now because they have, like, for Giants, they have...
349949	350730	The regular figures.
350770	353691	They have light core figures that light up when you put them on the thing.
353711	355672	They have giant figures.
355993	358954	And then with Swap Force, they're going to have Swap Force figures with that.
359655	361856	And then they have adventure sets.
362036	366419	And then they have battle sets that have figures and then crap with it.
366499	368460	Okay, so what all is there for Disney Infinity?
368500	371762	Because now we've entered this world where they're not even really microtransactions.
371822	373303	They are literally transactions.
373323	375964	You're going into the store and buying something tangible.
376024	377585	It's physical DLC is basically what it is.
377645	378766	But what all is there?
378846	380227	There's character statues, right?
380247	381067	There's characters.
381127	382188	There's individual characters.
382208	383448	They have character three packs.
383468	392053	So they have a villains pack that has Davy Jones, Randy, and Syndrome from all three of the characters.
392734	393934	Sets that are in the game.
394135	401220	And then there's a Sidekicks pack that has Mike, Mrs. Incredible, and Captain Barboza.
401360	405083	Okay, I don't even know all the packs, but you've got these characters, and then what?
405143	407745	You've got the hidden discs.
407805	411188	We have the blind packs of the power-up discs.
411628	412168	And what do they do?
412409	416552	Those are basically just, they have add-ons, like little power-up add-ons for the characters.
416652	421796	Although, I got two with that, and then I bought personally four because...
422636	426599	and, you know, I haven't invested any money in it yet, so, you know, why not?
427499	430421	And I have yet to get any of the circular power-up discs.
430521	434203	I've gotten all just the little, I don't know, hexagonal discs that they have.
434463	435124	What do they do?
435324	436285	I have the full rare set.
436305	436825	Wait, what do they do?
437025	451614	They unlock things in the game, so you have, like, it could be vehicles, like, you know, Mickey's Jalopy or, you know, there's Abu and stuff like that, or, like, guns or cosmetic stuff, like, you know,
452174	454375	different skins for your playset world.
454395	455756	You said you had a Wreck-It Ralph one, right?
455776	458777	Yeah, it skins the background like Wreck-It Ralph.
458857	463480	Okay, so what's the difference between the characters and then there's a thing called a playset that has the two characters.
463500	467402	Is playset like another... Yeah, the playset's basically like a single-player campaign.
468842	470463	Well, it's a story campaign.
470503	473965	So they have a Cars playset and then it comes with two cars with that.
474345	480028	And then they've got the Lone Ranger playset that's got the two characters with that.
480908	480988	Wow.
481008	481088	Yeah.
481108	481168	Wow.
508280	508740	Thanks for watching!
526309	526850	It's alright.
526910	532754	I mean, they do, like I said, they do kind of prompt you to like, you know, try to get you the purchase stuff.
533135	538239	But I mean, Skylanders did the exact same thing and it doesn't, I didn't run into it too much.
538299	549868	That's the trickiest part though because especially when it's for kids because, you know, if you have a six or seven year old that is about the right age to be doing this stuff, you know, they're going to hit these roadblocks and Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, I have to have it.
549908	551309	Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy.
552690	553651	Daddy, Daddy, Daddy.
555213	556774	They don't have to give in to it.
557094	557955	I mean, that's the thing.
558315	559476	Yeah, of course they're going to try it.
559496	560817	That's like TV commercials, though.
560857	563759	Daddy, daddy, I want whatever's on the TV.
564320	565340	I got to have this.
565540	569183	So, I mean, there's that, but I don't think it's a huge difference.
569203	572886	You're ruining my life if you don't buy it.
572946	574987	I'm going to just die.
575067	580111	I tried both Lightning McQueen and Mater in the Cars game, and it didn't seem like they played too different.
580131	581572	They played pretty much exactly the same.
581872	584293	Okay, so I don't think it's just a huge difference.
584613	587074	Although it was kind of funny to watch Mater, you know.
587134	592257	So maybe the play sets, you really need the play sets, and they come with characters, but maybe you don't need to buy all these extra characters.
592277	593857	Yeah, you probably don't need to buy all these extra characters.
593877	598800	And the play sets come with two characters, so it's kind of nice if you wanted to co-op, like if you have kids and stuff.
599640	626398	you know it has two characters in there I just you know other than you know the characters that are you know in these playsets there's not a whole ton else that you might want maybe if you wanted to co-op in like the regular game you probably would want to pick up at least maybe the sidekicks pack or something so that way you have an extra set of characters you can play through each one of the playsets but I mean it's you don't have to do all that stuff and a lot of the stuff you do unlock things as you go through the game and on top of
626958	628700	Just the toy box mode.
628720	630982	There is a lot of customization within, like, the actual game.
631002	636648	Like, in the Pirates of the Caribbean, so if you can pick up the actual people and throw them into the shop, you can customize what each character looks like.
637028	639911	You can customize your ship and what the loadouts are and that and stuff.
640191	643074	But a lot of it you have to buy with in-game money.
643575	646798	So, like, I had, like, to upgrade my Kansas, I had to, you know, earn money.
646818	649000	It's a lot of grind to get that.
649261	649361	But...
649781	650922	The ship combat's kind of cool.
650962	653024	They don't have a store you could just go into and spend 99 cents?
653084	654905	No, they don't have anything like that.
654925	655266	Not yet.
655286	656787	As far as I saw, so, yeah.
656887	658088	Daddy, daddy, daddy, buy me!
658248	658688	Buy me!
658929	668356	I don't think they're going to do anything like that because I think that could be a big problem if, you know, all of a sudden kids racked up, you know, hundreds of dollars in online transactions.
669397	671239	All right, let's go to our chat room.
671339	673741	I don't mean to neglect you folks, but you got a lot of good questions.
673801	675242	I just want to let Loki get his thoughts out.
675643	676023	Okay.
677064	678325	And then I wanted to have a coughing fit.
678385	678605	Sorry.
679465	688712	We do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern on Sundays, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
689693	692575	And we do have our chatters there at live.vognetwork.com.
693076	695137	And let's see some of the questions here.
695377	701602	Tiger Claw says, Do you guys think Disney Infinity could be huge this coming holiday season, given how successful Skylanders was?
701682	703464	It could be bigger because of the Disney's name.
704744	723517	well I think that's the idea and I think a lot of like if this game flops which I kind of don't think it will but if this game flops like Disney Interactive will close I think that's kind of what's riding on this for real because they've invested a lot into this I don't see how it could fail right now
724204	725085	Thanks for watching!
743147	766566	so there's that going forward and really like the new Skylanders game is just kind of a very linear action game and so I just don't know don't think there's a whole lot of incentive to buy stuff for that E3VL wants to know what your YouTube channel is where you had the unboxing where he can leave nasty comment no I made that part up but where can you leave it's just LokiOLR it's all one word yeah just all one word
767406	774530	Let's see, Dartetsuya at live.vognetwork.com asks, you think the figures and discs and so forth will get to be like the pins at the Magic Kingdom?
775210	776271	I think that's what Disney wants.
776971	780873	Definitely, and they have rares in each one of the sets.
781013	784355	I've got a full set and then some of the rares so far.
784375	787817	And I'm sure some of the Disney souvenir shops are already selling this.
788077	789838	And they have exclusive rares.
789858	793600	For example, they have Mike's car that's exclusive to Toys R Us right now.
793620	794000	All right.
794440	795060	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
820643	823265	No, that would assume that I would have gotten you the Disney Infinity Star instead.
823285	823965	We're playing make-leave.
823985	824686	We're playing make-leave.
824706	824886	All right.
824906	826627	Yeah, but if I was being a parent, I wouldn't do it.
826707	826947	All right.
827147	828748	Because I'm poor.
828849	832451	Okay, then Uncle Loki was spoiling and bought it for me.
832491	833292	Okay, so now I have it.
833352	834192	All right, so here we go.
834532	835753	Thank you, Uncle Loki.
835773	836974	You're welcome.
837074	837935	Mommy!
838395	840336	Mommy, you have to buy me!
840797	842958	Mommy, you have to buy me the cars!
843318	843919	Mommy!
844139	845099	Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!
845400	846220	You have to buy it!
846360	848201	Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
848962	849923	I don't have to buy you shit.
849963	850383	Go to your room.
852244	853285	You little ingrate!
853545	854265	Time out!
855867	859129	Ten minutes in your room on time out and you're not allowed to play with any toys.
859349	861370	You have to stare at the wall.
861991	864332	And then come back and tell me what you did wrong.
865933	866954	I know, I know.
868555	869996	Or you could go to the backyard and pick a switch.
871894	899322	that's what happened to me when I was a kid alright let's see I love you guys chat it's live.vognetwork.com let's see other comments here back on a serious note Black Wolf wants to know how much story is included in the base game without buying anything else you have the full thing for Pirates of the Caribbean The Incredibles and Monsters U so you have three play sets basically
899597	901798	So it's like three little mini-adventures you get to play through.
901818	902538	They're pretty long.
902578	906779	I mean, I've already played through about a few hours of Pirates of the Caribbean.
906839	912281	I'm not very far into it, so there's a lot there, a lot of content, I think.
913661	917183	TigerClaw wants to know, does the game actually end if you don't have all the figures?
917243	919103	Can you just play the core game and finish it?
919163	921344	So you get the three little adventures, basically.
921804	923446	Thanks for watching!
940487	941147	Thanks for watching!
958510	959511	Rob's Annoying Kid Impression is Awesome
981846	983427	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1009727	1011630	Final Fantasy XIV Final Fantasy XIV
1026350	1045342	and we're going to talk about this by just you know straight up the first version never happened bad figment of the imagination not going to go talk about version 1 anymore because this is now the real Final Fantasy 14 it always seemed like the intro was like we blew up that world lol yeah well he said he was inspired by World of Warcraft Cataclysm the producer so
1046343	1046823	DarkSakura.com
1061482	1062303	Ragnarok Online Back in the Beta
1084056	1087398	I mean, seriously, when I was in the beta of that game for seven years.
1087458	1090920	Oh, you haven't had a console game come around lately that sucked you in like that?
1090960	1096224	Well, when I had hand surgery, I was high on Vicodin and played Blue Dragon and almost finished the game.
1096992	1098133	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1117380	1121001	Which actually, that happened to me once, but it resolved itself within 10 minutes.
1121161	1122482	So I didn't really have the serious issue.
1123142	1131865	And besides full servers once in a while, which seems to also go away after 15-20 minutes, I'm not hearing of a lot of issues that my friends are having.
1132245	1136746	When I go over to Reddit or forums, I see you would think the entire world's having problems.
1137246	1138087	But I don't know.
1138127	1141948	It sucks that people are getting locked out of this beta, but...
1142168	1144209	Well, there was the world full thing today.
1144809	1151693	And I actually went and made a character on the European server, on Shiva, just so I could see what the server lists looked like.
1152134	1154555	And there were maybe four servers that weren't blacked out.
1155188	1156429	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1181264	1210130	so Midgarcimer is what we picked well finally it took a good 24 hours but Midgarcimer filled up too now and they had to actually open new worlds and unfortunately people can only roll on the new worlds they can't go to the worlds so I kind of think that part is a bit of a mess that Square is going to have to figure out a solution because why would you fucking play an MMO if you can't play it with your friends it gets really boring that way I mean we'll go make new friends moron why did I stop playing WoW
1210470	1211391	Yeah, exactly.
1211431	1212851	Why am I playing less and less WoW?
1212871	1214792	Like, more and more people I know left.
1215072	1225338	You know, if we were, and I was actually saying something to that, I prefer playing Alliance to Horde, and unfortunately our Alliance guild just sort of dried up, except for Grandpa.
1225618	1229060	but you can't blame people for not having fun anymore and not enjoying the game.
1229120	1231722	I mean, they left because for whatever reason they were having fun.
1231742	1236385	I said I don't blame anybody but that's why I left because I had no one to play with that and Pandas was kind of stupid.
1237686	1240308	Pandas as in the expansion was I hate the grind.
1240328	1241269	I hate the grind.
1241949	1244670	Well, you know, every expansion has its own noun.
1244710	1247732	But anyway, so Final Fantasy XIV is going on.
1247952	1255195	And despite those things, I hope they are able to institute... I think the World Pass thing that they had in Final Fantasy XI actually worked out really well.
1255636	1259598	Where, like, if you're friends on the server, they buy you a pass that you can use to get on.
1259698	1263099	And it costs them a lot of gil, depending on how many people are already on the server.
1263119	1263800	You bought me mine.
1263960	1264980	Yeah, but people will do it.
1265440	1266061	People will do it.
1266741	1271904	So anyway, otherwise, I mean, the good news is I'm just God, the game is gorgeous.
1272825	1274666	I love running instances with friends.
1274806	1279889	There was myself, Shane, Captain Spike from Game Buoy and Tim Tripp.
1279969	1280630	We're all running it.
1280690	1285092	We just we have the perfect layout of classes that the four of us can make a light party.
1285393	1288014	And we did the beginner instances just back to back last night.
1288114	1292117	And they're they're so fucking gorgeous and having fun with it.
1292717	1293338	and DarkSakura.com.
1306138	1309401	I mean, you actually pretty much learn how to do that when you're soloing your duties.
1310943	1319791	And for folks that liked Warcraft back in the very beginning when it was minimal abilities too, I think they might find something kind of fun in Final Fantasy XIV.
1320191	1320792	But I love it.
1320932	1327698	I'm definitely buying the game when it comes out and I will sub for at least a few months while I figure out, you know, am I going to cancel WoW to play this?
1327738	1328119	Am I going to
1328539	1356332	stick with this I'm really curious to see what the end game is like because I know a lot about Final Fantasy 14 from level 0 to 20 because I've actually been in since the alpha so I've done that grind like 5 times 0 to 20 and so I know a lot about it but I don't know much about what the game is past that and that kind of concerns me but it could I mean it's only a concern that doesn't mean it's gonna be negative I just don't know and if the end game isn't exciting enough it's not gonna really keep me there once I get to 50
1356912	1386123	I will tell you one thing though is that I mean and you were online for a little bit of this when I went exploring in the level 30 area it actually had a lot of really neat stuff there were some neat characters I've found Costa del Sol which you can't get to right now except by walking because it's the fairies are disabled and Limsa Lominsa yeah Limsa Lominsa that's hard to say just say Limsa but which by the way is my favorite town so far
1386551	1389053	I love the leader of that town, the female Rogadin.
1389453	1391455	She's great, and her voice acting I like the best.
1391915	1394317	I'm super enjoying Arcanist.
1395017	1396699	I mean, just because my carbuncle is so cute.
1396719	1397519	It's a great class.
1398880	1402363	And I haven't had nearly the same problems I did with Thaumaturge.
1402623	1406586	Because Thaumaturge, well, I mean, they've also fixed the duties, but still.
1407847	1412791	But I had to say that just what I saw, there were some pretty encouraging things for stories.
1412891	1416455	I think we're going to get more raid-like content and stuff like that.
1416535	1419117	It sounds like they're really going to be developing it and so forth.
1419157	1429366	But if they fuck up some of these basics, like getting people who want to play together able to play together and in the same guild, if they fuck up these basics, it isn't going to matter how much they invest in the game in the end.
1429767	1430627	So I really hope...
1431388	1432129	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1450720	1457487	I'm at 14 right now, and I figured that when I hit like 18, I was going to start trying weaving or something, you know, whenever.
1458248	1466316	But I've already decided that I'm probably going to be selling off some of my services so that I can afford to buy the game, because it really is...
1468411	1469332	I was excited.
1469532	1470332	I really enjoyed it.
1470393	1475315	It has some of the elements I liked about Cataclysm that made me finally think WoW was fun.
1475535	1479137	Because you remember how many times I started WoW and then just said, oh, boring, oh, boring, oh, boring.
1479577	1481298	It had a lot of the fun.
1481378	1483760	It had characters that made me, I laughed at my desk.
1483820	1487001	I mean, especially with the Moogles drinking all the wine.
1487682	1488322	Did you see that bit?
1488402	1489142	Yes, yes, I did.
1489162	1489703	It's so cute.
1490583	1493625	Because I rolled a Lalafell this morning.
1494125	1495586	A really cute little teeny lalafell
1524308	1547587	Ha ha ha ha Maybe it was mining, I don't know But anyway, it was just funny The names of the quests have been funny I've really had a lot of fun The other big thing for me is that I have really been enjoying having my friends on People to chat with You know what?
1548187	1550749	I'd give you a hug for free, Jim Sally But you have to come out here and get it
1552090	1555172	I'm doing logos for people.
1555372	1560475	I'm working on a logo for a couple of people right now and making fabric art.
1561936	1562176	Awesome.
1562957	1563137	Yes.
1563537	1564558	Well, good luck with all of that.
1564878	1565798	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1588369	1589810	Check back in like 30 minutes.
1589870	1590750	Check back in an hour.
1591091	1593112	And I'm sure this will be the case in early access as well.
1593512	1594333	It does open up.
1594453	1597235	And Midgarcimer is not supposed to be one of the super populated servers.
1597515	1598876	So you will be able to get in eventually.
1598937	1601098	It just might be frustrating that you can't get in right away.
1601438	1605742	But all of us that were super eager about this game, we all got in.
1605882	1608344	And it's going to be too tough to move everybody at this point.
1608424	1610025	So we're going to stick it out on Midgarcimer.
1610625	1611746	VOG Network
1631841	1636587	So it'll be something like Vanquishers of Garland or something.
1636607	1637969	You know, we want something that'll be VOG.
1637989	1638209	Gilgamesh.
1638229	1639310	Yeah, something like that.
1639330	1640732	That's very Final Fantasy-like.
1640752	1649062	Yeah, we're gonna... So if you have some good ideas, throw them out there, especially Shane, because he'll be the one that puts it all together, I'm sure, because he's gonna... Verp of gastritis.
1650684	1653086	But yeah, we're looking at something where the abbreviation will be VOG.
1653406	1655107	So just to kind of tie it together, be fun.
1655768	1656909	So, all right.
1658490	1658930	Let's see.
1659390	1666275	Codeman says in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, like I asked before, if you roll on that server when live, will you still be on that server?
1666835	1672419	Yes, the characters are not supposed to delete between open beta and live at this point.
1672499	1676102	If there is a huge game breaking bug, they may still erase them.
1676642	1679545	Although, I don't know.
1679625	1683169	Because of all these issues people are having, maybe that'll be justification for them to erase them.
1683209	1683770	I hope not.
1684190	1691098	But this is why everybody was very much about like they wanted to get on the server they want to get on because this is your real character now that you're going to have in the main game.
1691398	1691899	So we'll see.
1692519	1692620	So...
1693320	1695641	Um, Bobby said very old gamers.
1697942	1699403	That would mostly be accurate.
1699443	1699783	We'll see.
1700703	1701003	All right.
1701824	1704745	Technus in chat says, if you can't think of a name, find a Latin phrase.
1704785	1707686	You know, you don't know how many Warcraft guilds that worked for.
1709987	1731223	and Final Fantasy XI to be fair alright Geeklet in our chatroom says they might have to wipe the server to fix that dumb error that is a distinct possibility so we all have to kind of be prepared for that that's why I kind of I leveled my and we'll wrap up this discussion guys I know we're going to get to the other games I leveled one of my jobs to like 18 and another one to 13 and then did some crafting stuff
1731963	1740829	and so if they wipe them all I would be kind of mad but at the end of the day that's the reason why I stopped playing too and I'm not going to play anymore.
1740949	1745272	I logged out and I'm getting my rest bar because if they do wipe it then fine.
1745452	1746633	I'll deal with it.
1746673	1748334	That's kind of my logic too.
1749295	1760942	The other thing too is that I'm probably going to stick with just caster classes for a while because and I love this so much over some of the stuff they did in 11 is that your gear will carry over
1762283	1762664	It's nice.
1763144	1771692	Yeah, and I can keep using my leather gear as a gladiator or whatever if I wanted to, so I wouldn't have to, because I sold all my old gear.
1771792	1772973	Whoops.
1773994	1776797	All right, anyhow, let's talk about officially our gaming week.
1776837	1780620	So besides Disney Infinity, besides Final Fantasy XIV, what kind of games have you been playing this week?
1780761	1781681	Is there anything else, Rob?
1782983	1785685	No, and clearly I'm playing Animal Crossing right now.
1785745	1786626	My village is open.
1787887	1790908	What if people want to add you, be your friend on 3DS so they can visit during the show?
1790988	1791508	How do they do that?
1791528	1791948	Oh, crap.
1792408	1793668	Well, I'd have to add them back.
1793809	1802271	So I might close and then reopen in Part B so I can put out my friend code because I don't memorize it.
1802391	1804531	So be here live, live.vognetwork.com Sunday nights.
1804551	1805131	Yeah, that's how you get it.
1805171	1806032	You have to be here live.
1806092	1807072	Yeah, that's how you're going to get it.
1808934	1811558	Unless one of you guys, like, I know Actdeft has it.
1811798	1816264	See, I would point you to the friend code thread at vognetwork.com, but I know Jamie doesn't check it.
1816725	1817366	I posted it.
1817586	1817947	Oh, did you?
1817967	1819389	I posted there.
1819489	1821772	So, Rob, thank you for your assumptions.
1821812	1822293	Jeez.
1823694	1824275	I swear.
1824575	1825696	I'm never happier to be wrong.
1825736	1826576	I'm so insulted.
1827317	1827477	Really.
1827557	1828137	Oh, get over it.
1828317	1828858	You know what?
1829138	1829418	Okay.
1830178	1841465	I played some Mass Effect 3 because I am still working on trying to get a custom texture, not texture, a custom mesh to work, but unfortunately it's not using any of the default textures in it.
1841866	1845048	And I hate using text mod with Mass Effect 3, so I'm just sort of like, bleh.
1846128	1851113	Um, I am also, I've, what did I play?
1851173	1852233	Oh yeah, I played more Fractal.
1852274	1853154	I'm back to playing Fractal.
1853595	1857298	Because that is my game that I play when my brain is too busy.
1858098	1864444	Like, if I have all these thoughts that I just want to get out of my head, I completely blank out and play Fractal.
1864644	1865445	It's such a good game.
1866366	1893289	I've also um I got Dan DuckTales and I got myself a copy I haven't touched it yet but basically I've been watching Dan play through the whole thing and humming along with the music because it's so good and he found a 8-bit music mode so he was super happy and playing through it with that um I played some other stuff what did I play oh yeah this well I went to Scandia this morning um because we went to breakfast and then played um mini golf which um
1894009	1900093	It's 102 today, and it was already like 90-something at 11 this morning, so I was like, I'm not having any more of that.
1900113	1900894	I've got a sunburn.
1901574	1905017	But I went inside, and poor Scandia.
1905437	1917205	I met a person who works there named Danny, who apparently owns 2DX machines, several of them, and a Pump It Up, and a DDR, and a Poppin' Music, and has the actual arcade cabinets.
1917225	1918106	He showed me photos of them.
1918806	1920610	I was like, I'm gonna be friends with you.
1920791	1921612	Actually, it was really cool.
1921653	1924900	And he was fixing one of the machines that I lost some tokens to.
1925643	1926924	Sean again, it's Sean again, that's what it was
1952014	1954096	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1973052	1974253	Dan played Crazy Taxi Crazy Money
1997873	1999113	Let's make some crazy money!
2016599	2017940	I was a little dismayed.
2018020	2019540	I mean, I shouldn't have been surprised.
2019960	2020941	They have no more pinball.
2022681	2027463	All the ticket games, of course, were in perfect condition, but the Tekken 5 had no monitor in it.
2027983	2030884	There was another game that had no monitor in it.
2031404	2036625	The X-Men vs. Street Fighter had such bad burn-in.
2037105	2038326	The monitor was green.
2038406	2039806	It was really in bad shape.
2041247	2045088	I played some Silent Scope, a little dark silhouette, because that one is really the best of them.
2048411	2051915	I really did play a lot of stuff this week, relatively.
2053456	2057721	You've loaned me Kid Icarus Uprising, which I started and then had to put down because the cat threw up.
2059543	2060884	Midna has been the queen.
2060904	2062286	That's a crappy reason to stop playing a game.
2062386	2063347	No, it's a barfy reason.
2064809	2065890	She threw up on Dan's chair.
2065970	2066590	I was so mad.
2066610	2067772	I was such a brat.
2068292	2075780	Um, so yeah, uh, and I was gonna start, um, Birth By Sleep, but I borrowed it from a friend, and I was like, I'm already playing too much, I just gave it back to her.
2075800	2080085	Alright, is there anything else you actually played, or is this all thought about playing?
2080105	2089115	Well, no, it's, I started stuff, and I, oh, and Final Fantasy 7, but I just cannot play it with keyboards, so, fuck it, I'm gonna find the controller somewhere.
2089429	2090451	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2102497	2107319	It didn't play a whole ton of stuff other than Disney Infinity and Saints Row 4.
2107419	2112441	So I played a lot of Saints Row 4 the last couple days here and it's fun.
2114882	2118784	Definitely a lot different than Saints Row 3 with the whole superpower thing.
2120164	2121425	At the same time, some of the...
2122305	2123206	Thanks for watching!
2141065	2146730	So, that's kind of the only annoying thing is that there's not really a point to the cars at all.
2147852	2161744	There was one little, I don't know if it's a glitch, but a design flaw, if I were to call it, where when you're buying stuff at a store, if people happen to be attacking you, it will kick you out of the menu that you're in.
2161904	2163546	So, like, I was in Friendly Fire once.
2164147	2165208	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2178968	2180170	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2199111	2201952	So, it's kind of dumb that they had that.
2202032	2206574	I understand that, yeah, you can't hide in stores anymore to drop your notoriety.
2207974	2216977	But, at the very least, they should pause the game when you're in a menu because it's kind of dumb that you can't browse the menu while you're in the middle of a fight.
2216997	2221379	I mean, I don't see why they should do that.
2222299	2223780	But whatever, that's their choice.
2225460	2226180	That was a little annoying.
2226580	2228541	I did find a couple hidden weapons in the game.
2229141	2234783	They have the penetrator, the giant dildo bat hidden in the game.
2235463	2236584	Oh no, it's back.
2236784	2237664	It's back, yes.
2238444	2246447	They also have a tentacle bat and they also have an anal probe that has a tongue on it.
2247952	2248533	That's awesome.
2249734	2250034	Wow.
2250735	2251977	It makes licking motions.
2252037	2254219	So that's kind of funny.
2255160	2255961	So they've got that.
2256882	2257803	Y'all need Jesus.
2258424	2262548	And then some of the weapon skins they have in there are kind of dumb.
2262788	2264971	So I didn't really mess with a whole ton of that stuff.
2266252	2268134	But I have a lot of the upgrades are kind of cool.
2268815	2274120	I just... It felt like I... I don't really like the whole having to pick health pickups.
2275041	2281347	Having to gather health pickups instead of having just a regenerating health, which has been in the game forever.
2281887	2283248	But they decided to switch it up.
2283569	2285350	It's not a huge deal, but it's kind of annoying.
2286111	2286231	Um...
2287412	2288193	I'm trying to think of what else.
2288233	2289253	So far, the story's kind of fun.
2289414	2293817	I haven't really played a whole bunch of the story missions yet, but it's funny.
2293857	2296078	There was moments that I was laughing out loud.
2297319	2307647	I love the new... You know how the third had these wrestling moves you could do if you hold down sprint and hit one of the attack buttons?
2308067	2316113	Well, now they have super-powered attacks, and they're just goddamn ridiculous, like throwing people up there and just stomping on their skull and
2316573	2318314	Just ridiculous stuff in the game.
2318394	2319916	So I kind of dig that.
2321537	2322317	And then what else?
2322338	2324159	So I've been playing on an Xbox 360.
2324259	2329763	I just preloaded my Steam copy, so I'm looking forward to that.
2330144	2332645	So I'll be playing this for a while until Grand Theft Auto V comes out.
2333126	2334287	And then all bets are off.
2334307	2336649	It's just going to be Grand Theft Auto until I die.
2336689	2339471	We'll talk about Grand Theft Auto V and your excitement a little later in the show.
2339591	2341112	But anything else for your gaming weakness?
2341212	2343334	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2364332	2365293	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2393667	2395570	Did you notice that they did change a few things around?
2409170	2409750	Oh god, yes.
2410151	2421697	There's that new level in the beginning, and then they totally changed the end, where in the NES game you used to go back to Transylvania, and that's where you would fight the last boss, but in this one they made a whole new level.
2422057	2425099	They made the, you know, spoiler, sorry, but, you know, come on.
2425959	2431281	They made a new level, Mount Vesuvius, that you play instead, which is kind of like Inside a Volcano.
2431321	2435663	So it's very different and much harder in difficulty than the base levels.
2436303	2442606	And more spoiler alert, after the final boss, there's a Metroid-esque escape element.
2444547	2447988	That was definitely controller-throwing frustration.
2448568	2451129	Luckily, I own a Wii U, so I wasn't about to throw that controller.
2452210	2453270	But thought about it.
2453690	2455672	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2472188	2473569	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2494449	2505253	and although after you play through the whole thing once, you can skip cutscenes later on, it's still really annoying that you're going through the game and then, oh, stop, cutscene, oh, stop, cutscene.
2506114	2510635	And I get that, you know, like if you have kids or whatever, like they're gonna eat it up, they're gonna love it.
2510775	2514457	If you love the old 90s show, it's great, you're gonna love it.
2515277	2544259	but I don't know like I kind of got over it pretty quick and I just wanted to play the game and that experience kept getting interrupted every five seconds and that was one thing I loved about the original game is it was it was this game you could really speed run and you know beat the whole thing in not even an hour maybe if you're good you know so I don't know I did not like that whole stop and go element and here's what really pissed me off the quality of the audio is atrocious
2545194	2545575	Was it?
2545855	2547378	It sounded... Not the music.
2547458	2548179	The music's great.
2548499	2550142	The voice acting audio quality?
2550623	2551143	Horrible.
2551464	2553187	Scrooge sounds like he's coming through an iPhone.
2553780	2556622	It sounded really clear on the PC.
2556682	2558844	It might be a Wii U thing.
2559024	2562827	It could be, but I heard the same thing from somebody who played it on 360.
2562867	2565309	Maybe it's a console thing then.
2565649	2566750	Maybe it is a console thing.
2566850	2567231	I don't know.
2567291	2570233	But the quality of the sound itself was really bad.
2570693	2578139	Especially the worst is when you're going through and he gets hit or whatever and you go, Oh, ouch!
2578159	2578639	Things like that.
2578699	2578900	Like...
2579720	2581882	It gets drowned out by the music.
2581962	2583103	It sounds really out of place.
2583123	2584144	It gets really repetitive.
2584484	2584985	It's horrible.
2585505	2588087	So yeah, not a fan of that.
2589708	2594252	So when I was actually playing the game DuckTales Remastered, I was having a great time.
2594292	2596294	I could have done without all the other crap, sorry to say.
2597374	2598736	Um, what else?
2598776	2600457	There was one other thing I wanted to say about DuckTales.
2600677	2612246	Oh, I will say this, and I know this has got to be unique to the Wii U. I kind of think it was a lazy port, which shouldn't be a surprise whatsoever, but speaking of sound design, there was no, uh...
2613027	2614468	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2636756	2637898	I had to mute the gamepad.
2638278	2640340	I cannot play the game with sound on the gamepad.
2640901	2644285	And so that's a little bit annoying because the Nintendo games don't have that problem.
2645226	2646588	They're all synced up just fine.
2646988	2649992	So I think that's just a lazy port problem.
2650733	2651794	But it is what it is.
2652034	2658076	You know, I mean, I'm just saying overall in terms of the voices, I didn't notice a problem at all on the PC.
2659037	2664019	So I might have to stream it when I'm playing through it just to see if anything comes across.
2664259	2675663	It could also just be taste and maybe, you know, not to say you don't have an ear for this, DarkSakura, but having done audio editing for all these years doing the show, I just can hear it and I go, my God, where did they take this guy?
2675683	2676763	Because he sounds awful.
2677203	2680825	After the show, I'd like to hear yours because I can tell you if there's a difference.
2680845	2681105	Okay.
2681809	2683150	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2708360	2723841	I will know next week And it's something I can't control So I'll tell you off air why But we'll talk about that later DarkSakura and Loki may put something else together We have to figure all that out Because I got something dropped on me I will know next week for sure
2724741	2725621	DarkSakura, Loki, DragonCon
2752970	2780531	So definitely come see that Saturday night, 5.30 is the VOG Super Show Not just me, Bobby Blackwolf, PodCulture I don't even remember, Travis Donovan's gonna be there One of the Critical Myth guys is there I hope I'm not forgetting everybody, anybody But yeah, so it'll be a whole bunch of us that do shows at VOG And possibly some surprises in store during that panel That's all I can say Like magical plane tickets for me Well, and you get a car, and you get a car No, nothing like that
2781451	2786875	If you miss me Saturday night because, I don't know, there's something else going on, a good time to find me would be Monday at 11.30.
2787275	2789316	There's a streaming podcast panel.
2789917	2792978	Bobby's going to be a part of that, so I will be there just to support.
2793178	2793979	And, you know, me too.
2794039	2795020	I do a streaming podcast.
2795420	2796400	So I'll be there.
2796460	2797861	That would be your second chance to see me.
2798762	2800203	But then I fly out of town Monday night.
2800383	2803545	So if you don't see me Monday at 11.30, you probably missed me.
2803725	2804125	Just saying.
2804725	2809188	So I will remind you of that next week during the last show before DragonCon.
2809648	2810029	Just saying.
2811289	2813750	Otherwise, friend us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
2813790	2817250	We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2818571	2820731	Let's go to our news tonight.
2821231	2822412	Loki, why don't you start us off?
2822752	2823152	All right.
2823892	2832174	So there's been a lot of changes for the Xbox One for sure since the original announcement.
2833774	2836936	They're trying to fix what people didn't like.
2837096	2840178	And so here's another notch to add to that.
2840658	2847883	The Xbox One will no longer require the Kinect to be plugged in in order for the system to work.
2847943	2848323	That's right.
2848763	2852225	You can play with the system unconnected from the Kinect.
2852586	2858409	However, if you're going to play a game that requires the Kinect, then obviously you have to plug it in.
2860010	2861972	XBOX One Controllers
2886519	2889882	You can get one for PC, but the drivers aren't coming out until 2014.
2889942	2900192	And basically, as we've stated, the Xbox One controller, although it looks similar in many ways, shares no underlying technology with the current Xbox 360.
2900632	2909600	New wireless protocol combined with the ability to work in wired mode and additional features like impulse triggers means software has to be written and optimized for the PC.
2910762	2912043	However...
2914232	2918153	This week, there was a big announcement for Call of Duty showing off the multiplayer.
2918694	2921635	And the game was being played on PC with Xbox One controllers.
2921895	2929978	So those dumb fucks have the drivers, but they're making excuses so that if you really want to play with that controller, you better buy an Xbox One.
2930758	2936223	Just playing devil's advocate, could they have been developed third party?
2936243	2937985	Could it be a Joy to Key situation?
2938005	2945872	No, it's not because it was on a PC version of the game because they were able to go in the options and there was an enable gamepad option on there.
2946432	2951697	Why would you purposely delay the release of the drivers?
2951998	2956963	Because people then, oh, I want to get the Xbox One experience with Call of Duty and Battlefield.
2957323	2961427	I'm just going to buy the PC versions, and I don't need to buy an next-gen console for that.
2961787	2965371	So what they're trying to do is trying to get the sync in so all these people that...
2965831	2969194	Really need to have that controller are going to buy, you know.
2969454	2969895	Here's the thing.
2970916	2974479	I would think you just pull, yank the 360 controllers off the market.
2974719	2976961	Well, I guess you really can't do that when you're still selling the console.
2977621	2981004	Because as I say, for the PC people, make that not an option.
2981024	2981885	They have to get the Xbox One.
2981945	2987330	It's not a huge deal because, I mean, all you're really getting is those impulse control, you know, the impulse triggers or whatever.
2987710	2988891	So I guess they have to build that in.
2988932	2990513	But it's still kind of stupid.
2990713	2991914	I don't know why they would do that.
2992114	2992335	But...
2993035	2995436	Whatever, you know, that's their decision.
2995456	2997337	Then I guess I just won't buy another controller.
2997557	2999958	Not that I really need one anyways.
3000338	3001459	Are you getting the one at launch?
3001699	3001739	No.
3001759	3002159	At this point?
3002219	3002879	I didn't think you were.
3003299	3006100	I'm not planning on getting one at all at the moment.
3007241	3011263	And I'm still kind of on the fence with the PlayStation 4 just because of Grand Theft Auto V.
3012683	3036823	and just because the launch lineup is not that strong I mean there's you know Killzone which looks cool but it's not really a game I'm interested in like I've played some of the other Killzone games and it's just not not my thing if it was a Resistance game or something that might be a whole different story because I'm a real big fan of Resistance but uh Killzone I'm not a huge fan of Drive Club I'm kind of eh and um Knack I just really don't care about Knack
3037043	3038084	Infamous looks great.
3038205	3040708	So I'd definitely pick up Infamous next year.
3041228	3042910	But I still might.
3043030	3048377	I still may pick one up just because I already have my pre-order in with Amazon.
3048417	3050800	We'll see what they announce this week and stuff.
3050820	3053162	Maybe they'll announce that there's a packing game or something like that.
3053683	3055045	That might sweeten the deal a little bit.
3055425	3060288	GameGuru also has a good point in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com when it comes to this Call of Duty ghosts and all this.
3060708	3063269	GameGuru says people could just stick with a 360 controller.
3063349	3063849	That's true.
3063889	3064110	You could.
3064130	3064370	Why not?
3064790	3065170	I understand.
3065190	3077657	So that would seem really ridiculous that people, that they would hold back the drivers for that reason you're saying because if somebody really wants to have a console experience on a PC or whatever, like if you really want to play controller on a PC, then just, yeah, use a 360 controller.
3077677	3078097	Exactly.
3078177	3082079	But my point is, so they have the drivers available, so their reasoning behind it is, oh, we have to
3082159	3082659	and DarkSakura.
3108676	3111838	It's not that hard to develop drivers for a controller.
3112099	3112679	I mean, come on.
3112739	3114740	Yeah, it wouldn't seem like it's that.
3114840	3119243	I would think if anything, I'm thinking probably you'd see a third-party solution from some hackers.
3119323	3122466	Is there going to be a USB plugged-in version?
3122746	3123646	Well, that's the thing.
3123827	3132172	The controller has a battery pack that you can put in there, and when you plug it in, it shuts off the radio for the wireless, so it acts like a wired controller.
3132192	3133473	This is like a PlayStation 3 controller.
3133593	3133773	Yeah.
3134114	3134314	Okay.
3134774	3135114	Sort of.
3135314	3135514	Yeah.
3135655	3135915	Sort of.
3136115	3136395	Okay.
3136855	3136995	Hmm.
3137896	3150379	All right, well, speaking of Xbox One, some changes with the launch of the Xbox One, and that is certain countries kind of got screwed with the launch because Xbox One was originally going to launch in 21 different countries.
3150479	3161501	However, Microsoft, in a blog post, said that goal was too aggressive and that Xbox One will only be available in 13 territories this November.
3161981	3166822	So Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Sweden, Switzerland...
3167122	3167763	You got screwed.
3168123	3170484	So you will get the console in 2014 instead.
3170504	3170985	You know what?
3172065	3172766	Russia earned it.
3175128	3176609	That's a whole nother Oprah.
3177909	3183613	I think it's bad ship yields is what they can't make enough to cover all those countries.
3183813	3189197	And maybe they're just trying to fortify their position in the countries that they know that they can do well in.
3189858	3191719	But it's still kind of lame.
3192159	3196222	I mean, I understand why they're doing it, but at the same time, you know,
3196522	3200551	Especially, like, I'm surprised that they're not trying to make more headway in Japan.
3200932	3201353	They just, like...
3202948	3205750	Oh, they have written off Japan.
3205770	3209892	Yeah, we've sucked it up for the Xbox 360 and we're definitely not going to try any harder.
3210613	3213775	Maybe I shouldn't say that because they are supposed to be doing Tokyo Game Show.
3214315	3228504	They're trying to build Buzz somehow over there and who knows what they're keeping in their hat to show at Tokyo Game Show that maybe would be something you never know what type of studio they pulled together or something to create a very Japanese RPG or something.
3228884	3232226	Although, I guess they tried that on 360 and it didn't totally pan out.
3232246	3232346	Yeah.
3232346	3233447	I was high on Vicodin, Rob.
3233487	3233827	Fair enough.
3233847	3234787	I mean, it was cool.
3235448	3236548	And I always like Toriyama's art style.
3236568	3237409	Dude designed Chrono Trigger.
3254150	3255352	AkumaJP says we don't care
3265766	3272368	and, well, and you guys clearly have shown that through the Xbox 360, which, you know, fair is fair.
3273008	3276349	Anyhow, just quickly, these are the territories that will get Xbox One.
3276689	3283231	Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Spain, United Kingdom, United States, New Zealand.
3283431	3288553	I'm glad Germany's on there because that'd be really awkward to make an announcement at Gamescom.
3288593	3291454	Hey, this console will be launching this year.
3291634	3294035	Oh, wait, no, not for you guys.
3294135	3295235	Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine.
3295695	3296675	Alright, anyhow.
3297996	3299397	Going on to Xbox One.
3299437	3300197	Now, here's the thing though.
3300217	3302938	Well, let's assume it wasn't coming out in Germany for whatever reason.
3303358	3304419	It might actually be okay.
3304619	3307380	And these countries that want one bad enough, guess what?
3307960	3311622	The Xbox One games are no longer going to be region locked.
3312903	3313283	Sorry.
3313843	3315825	The Xbox One games will not be region locked.
3316885	3324551	So in an interview with Eurogamer, Xbox One, they said, when the console launches this November, we will support the Xbox One in 13 markets.
3324811	3329374	Xbox One may be used in all countries, including the non-launched markets.
3329994	3332756	In addition, Xbox One games are not region locked.
3333317	3338601	Any Xbox One game purchased at retail can be used in any country on any Xbox One.
3338661	3342443	That was part of their original 180 flip thing, that that was going to happen.
3342463	3342503	So...
3343924	3357210	Well, clarified that even with this change in the 13 lineups, if you live in one of the eight affected countries, you could get around it and still have a good experience with Xbox One.
3358590	3359331	This is good, though.
3359851	3362372	Yeah, I'm glad that everybody's going region-free.
3362432	3364313	I mean, this is the obvious answer.
3365093	3366034	Who's still region-locked?
3366074	3367034	Only Nintendo at this point?
3367054	3367574	Nintendo, yes.
3367954	3368515	Tsk, tsk.
3369655	3370296	I don't know.
3370316	3370616	Tis-tis.
3370696	3374580	And the sad thing was they were sort of on region locked at one point.
3374600	3375641	Yeah, they were going that way.
3375681	3377663	And then the 3DS, they're like, eh.
3377803	3381547	I think the 3DS is because they couldn't really figure out their marketplace too well.
3381607	3386592	And so they didn't know how to, I guess, make the purchase and be region free or something.
3386732	3389194	And so because of that, that might be why it's locked down.
3389775	3390155	I don't know.
3390195	3391256	Maybe because of piracy.
3391977	3394259	But, yeah, it's, I don't know, whatever.
3411630	3412331	Was there more later?
3412471	3414053	I thought we had one more Xbox story.
3414353	3425587	Well, anyway, despite everything you're saying about, you know, the Kinect and the controllers and, you know, the region locking and all that stuff, you know, Xbox is giving people what they wanted and it's kind of impressive.
3425887	3428471	I thought originally after E3 it wasn't going to happen this fast.
3428931	3429732	Let's not forget.
3430612	3432473	Don Mattrick's not running things anymore either.
3432813	3436454	So there's definitely been a change in how things are being run.
3437414	3443296	And whether that's coming at his former level or a higher level, who knows?
3444537	3447478	Yeah, and I'm not sure how much more they're going to really be able to do.
3447558	3452099	Especially with the price and doing a skew without Connect to drop the price.
3452199	3453440	I don't think that's going to happen because...
3454000	3454661	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3472173	3485303	Hell, all the games they showed at E3 didn't use Kinect I mean, they may have supported it but they sure as hell didn't demonstrate Kinect The one thing I liked most about Kinect was the whole people calling each other to talk during TV shows
3486365	3486845	Do you have an iPhone?
3486865	3486945	Yes.
3486965	3488646	Do you know people that have an Android phone?
3488686	3488746	Yes.
3488786	3489967	You know those have Skype on them.
3490547	3491087	They do, they do.
3491187	3491707	And they're free.
3491747	3494468	There's something about having it right there on the TV, though.
3495069	3495469	I don't know.
3516308	3516528	My mom.
3533194	3534315	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3551994	3579650	I can check my Twitter feed and my Facebook and then no it's just it's not alright GameGuru in chat says it is rather admirable that Microsoft is actually reversing their horrible horrible idea though they never should have had it in the first place I'll tell you what though having you know tried streaming this week and stuff I am definitely looking forward to the console you know recording and streaming functionality of both consoles so I think that's pretty awesome it's just you know
3581345	3583648	I don't know, just anything to make it easier would be fantastic.
3584169	3585751	Alright, let's move on to another article.
3586820	3589662	All right, well, I don't know how people are going to feel.
3590703	3597408	So for anyone who has been looking into Xenoblade Chronicles, of course, it's an exclusive at GameStop.
3597608	3600970	Well, they are pretty much defending how much they're charging for it.
3601751	3602672	Basically, it's 90 bucks.
3603732	3612118	And when they were contacted, they said that they use feedback from their Power Up members to see what titles they want to bring back.
3612278	3614040	And, you know, talking about Xenoblade Chronicles.
3614700	3619962	and that they basically were saying that the price is competitive.
3620202	3622103	It's based on market value and people will pay it.
3623303	3628625	And then they say, but our Power Up Pro members always receive a 10% discount and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
3628705	3631567	So they're basically like, we can charge it.
3632027	3632467	Screw you.
3633807	3634168	Pretty much.
3635428	3637909	I mean, I don't order for GameStop, but I'm just saying it's what it sounds like.
3639286	3648474	You know what's funny is last week we were talking about something else related to this whole thing and I even said in joking, oh, the good news is all these copies of Xenoblade are going back to GameStop.
3648814	3657261	I did not realize that it was under this fucking outrageous pricing scheme that they're giving to it.
3657281	3658402	It's ridiculous.
3658742	3663767	I can understand that there's an actual shortage on the game and stuff and that it's rare and that maybe the...
3664147	3664407	DarkSakura.com
3682088	3684089	All of the stores happen to have copies of it.
3684209	3694816	Yeah, that's very coincidental that all of a sudden all the stores have copies and they're used copies that happen to also still have unredeemed Nintendo Club codes in there.
3695136	3697598	Oh, that's so convenient.
3698158	3705120	I'm going to say something that I'm probably going to regret saying, but this is my honest to God reaction when I hear this stuff.
3705200	3712502	And maybe this is just the, you know, I don't know, the Les Miserables revolution person in me or whatever.
3713002	3720184	But honest to God, Xenoblade is a great game and you should pirate it so you can play it.
3722113	3723033	That is what I'm going to say.
3723353	3726394	You should pirate Xenoblade so you can play this game because it's great.
3726834	3729975	And there's instructions on how to mod your Wii out there.
3730295	3732855	It was on a bunch of sites when the game was only out in the UK.
3733295	3734876	But you know what?
3735076	3740197	Nintendo restricting its release to only GameStop and they no longer sell it on their shop.
3740237	3742037	If Nintendo was selling it on their shop, I'd say, oh, great.
3742097	3744958	Oh, you should definitely support it by going to buy this game on Nintendo.
3745218	3749919	But if this is what they're going to let happen, Nintendo is letting this happen.
3750865	3751625	You should go pirate the game.
3775387	3777368	They're gonna limit who can actually sell those games?
3777549	3780070	You really think they're gonna come down in price like Steam?
3780431	3781191	Ha ha ha!
3781611	3782732	That's very funny.
3784533	3787115	Bobby in our chatroom says, I rented it via Gamefly.
3787856	3788736	That's a great solution.
3789117	3791859	Probably a better one than I suggested, quite honestly.
3791939	3798003	But as much as you may think I'm terrible for what I said or whatever, I mean... I don't think you're terrible.
3798343	3799244	The reality is...
3800339	3801199	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3821829	3824291	They go print more copies of the game and they sell them.
3824772	3830517	But now what they've done is they're going back and reprinting it because you guys demanded it.
3830837	3831818	We're going to reprint it.
3832639	3835521	Yes, I don't think the fans demanded that you charge $90 for it either.
3837203	3842507	Do you know what they ought to do is they ought to just release it on the Wii U download shop?
3843428	3843608	Yeah.
3844169	3847392	And then I would say, go ye forth and download this game.
3847452	3848713	It's great and you should play it.
3850287	3853489	That would be a great thing for them to do.
3856130	3856891	You know what, though?
3857391	3860733	It's the same thing that people were fessing at people for going out.
3860853	3874120	I mean, it's why Target and places like that were restricting the number of Wii's people could buy because they knew that they were a limited number and they were going to go on eBay and charge a bajillion for it, which would hurt their chances later on of actually selling the system for retail price.
3875101	3877082	FifthDream in chat says, oh, it's a Wii game?
3877142	3877883	Who gives a fuck?
3878203	3879343	Because honestly, it's great.
3879803	3880444	It really is.
3880464	3880864	I give a fuck.
3881284	3884326	Yeah, you are missing out on not playing it.
3884886	3892650	I think when I originally reviewed the game, I said it's the greatest PlayStation 2 Japanese RPG you'll play on a Nintendo Wii.
3894468	3895008	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3922543	3926085	Alright, before I say something else that's going to get me in trouble, let's go on to another news story.
3926146	3926526	Loki.
3927006	3931329	Alright, so Sony's got some news that they're going to be unveiling this week at Gamescom.
3931809	3938354	And that news is rumored to be their release plans for the PlayStation 4.
3939034	3942276	And those are going to be shared on August 20th during their conference.
3942737	3951783	They're emphasizing that they're going to have a brief announcement regarding the release plans for the PlayStation 4.
3953063	3975998	and also I guess Microsoft was to have some sort of announcement as well though they're saying that their conference is really short and emphasizing on developers in their games yeah I think it's basically really short because that news that they were supposed to be unveiling about the you know Xbox One systems being dev kits and stuff like that that already got leaked out so they don't have anything to talk about anymore so that's kind of unfortunate but
3978112	3980254	I'm interested to see what both parties have to say.
3980634	3986218	Well, I'm also interested to see what release date they're going to give the PlayStation 4.
3986318	3987759	That's going to come out this week, right?
3987779	3988380	Probably November.
3988480	3989240	Everything's November.
3989701	3990922	I'd be surprised if it's October.
3990942	3993624	A lot of rumors pointing to October for some reason.
3994344	3995245	Maybe trying to get a jump.
3995925	4001930	Originally, I thought October because there were some placeholder dates that I had from a third party that were...
4003328	4004509	Thanks for watching!
4022264	4024426	There might be some more game announcements from Microsoft.
4024987	4028611	I know everyone's expecting maybe like a Crackdown 3 or something like that.
4029912	4034657	Although Saints Row 4 is coming out the same day, so there's your Crackdown 3.
4036929	4037229	I don't know.
4038170	4040152	Oh, the Crackdown 3 would be slightly interesting.
4040372	4042274	If it was a launch style, that would be even more interesting.
4042294	4043915	What's the free game on 360 now?
4044175	4046517	Because Crackdown was the first half of the month, right?
4046617	4048839	Dead Rising 2 and Dead Rising Case Zero.
4048859	4050660	Oh, I'm going to have to pick that up.
4050781	4052582	Yeah, I put it in my queue.
4052602	4057846	I've been putting everything in my queue, except for that last Xbox Live Arcade game, because I don't give a shit about that.
4058087	4061309	But I've been just putting it all in my queue, but...
4062512	4063673	I don't know, they're okay.
4063853	4066934	It's just at the same time it's not exactly like PlayStation Plus.
4066954	4068815	I did put Hitman Absolution.
4068855	4078939	The problem, and this goes back to the whole digital download thing, it's a 17 gig download for Hitman because it's PlayStation 3.
4079259	4088883	It's 17 gigs and my network timed out in the middle of the download because it was a few hours even though I have pretty fast internet.
4089663	4090244	Do you have PlayStation?
4090304	4092286	Well, yeah, you have PlayStation Plus because you're downloading the game.
4092306	4100393	Can't you just trigger it to start downloading and then turn off your PlayStation and let it download overnight when it does the... Because any outstanding downloads will download overnight.
4100433	4101294	Yeah, I could.
4101314	4102815	I just... It downloaded most.
4102835	4104777	I'm sure it would resume it, but it's just, you know...
4106601	4107422	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4121718	4132023	Now, we kind of knew they were getting into some TV things from the earlier press conference, but now it's really starting to gel together what this might actually be, and it looks like it's going to be some type of paid TV service.
4132204	4135265	I would have thought it would have been an enhancement to PlayStation Plus.
4135805	4136746	Maybe it still is.
4136986	4139768	If it's free TV and PlayStation Plus, fuck yeah.
4140728	4143590	You would think that they would sweeten the pot with that, but I don't know.
4143630	4143950	Maybe not.
4144350	4144770	But anyway...
4146791	4151595	It's according to a report in the Wall Street Journal because Sony made a big deal with Viacom.
4151715	4153736	Viacom is a huge media company.
4153756	4154877	They own CBS, don't they?
4155438	4157319	And Paramount and all these companies.
4158019	4163624	To carry Viacom cable channels on an internet-based service for Sony products.
4164364	4168570	So you will be able to get Viacom cable channels, which is MTV and that stuff, right?
4168590	4173697	MTV Comedy Central, VH1, I don't remember what else they have.
4173717	4181367	So assumably, you will be able to get these channels through your PlayStation 3 and essentially bypass your cable box.
4184264	4186506	I don't see how the cable companies are going to let that fly.
4187087	4188388	It's Viacom, though.
4188428	4193253	Viacom, they're higher up than the cable companies, so I can see how they can let that fly.
4193293	4194835	It's just interesting to me.
4195055	4202383	We've seen throughout this whole mess of Time Warner and CBS that cable companies will block whatever they want.
4202803	4205905	I'm kind of surprised that they're going to be able to get away with this.
4205925	4207446	They can block it on their own.
4207906	4214530	As far as negotiating with other companies, they can block it on their own service, but they can't really block it off the internet.
4214550	4218933	There's so many people that are ditching cable TV in favor of Netflix and Hulu.
4218953	4220814	They'll just start raising internet prices.
4221515	4222635	Yeah, you're right.
4222695	4223015	Probably.
4223596	4223856	Probably.
4224377	4227343	It's costing us a lot more to expand.
4227603	4230509	We gotta put these bandwidth caps on because bandwidth is super expensive.
4230529	4234557	But also keep in mind, how many people do you know who have ditched their landline for their cell phone?
4234998	4235458	True.
4236044	4237385	So it's more the same thing.
4237425	4239206	True, and AT&T is still kicking, right?
4239286	4242828	They're still putting out that blazing fast DSL.
4243289	4243869	I'm sorry.
4243929	4246011	No, that's not.
4246071	4258679	Sony also, to do on-demand programming and cable channels online, there'll be a recommended programming feature that will be influenced by content providers and an algorithm of what you've been watching.
4259299	4260999	So, interesting.
4261120	4269482	June 26th, it should be noted, my birthday, Sony renewed a trademark for PlayStation TV, likely to be the final name of this.
4269782	4270242	So, who knows?
4270282	4271922	We might see more on this at Gamescom.
4272882	4278884	Even though they just inked this deal the other day, Apple is notorious for inking deals the night before they make an announcement.
4279264	4283585	So, you could see something, but it may be a rabbit in their hat.
4283605	4287006	They keep till later when we have more of what that's really going to be.
4287026	4287246	Okay.
4287566	4291988	I am really curious to see how Comcast, Time Warner reacts to this.
4293208	4293789	Be interesting.
4297750	4299771	GameGuru in chat says Viacom doesn't care.
4299811	4301432	They're the guys who own CBS.
4301812	4302152	Oh, yeah.
4302592	4326564	Viacom is probably really excited about this because fuck Time Warner at this point if they can get CBS on PlayStation boxes I mean this is a dream for them if Sony's giving them what they want I mean this is this is a huge piece in their favor as far as Viacom is concerned you're just bypassing the whole you know because now you can get your you know you bypass everything
4327549	4332133	Now, an interesting point, and I've seen this on Twitters and so forth, so this is worth discussing.
4332213	4334295	BlackWolf says, TV, TV, TV, TV.
4334816	4338359	Microsoft talks TV equals Microsoft doesn't know what they're doing.
4338419	4338979	How lame.
4339460	4341902	Sony talks TV equals this is awesome.
4342222	4347427	Okay, well, there's a little difference between having an IPTV service that you have going through your game console and...
4347987	4354813	Plugging in a video in through your goddamn console just be to, you know, you can watch TV on the Xbox One.
4354913	4356214	You can watch TV on your TV.
4356354	4368904	Basically, they're saying, hey, look, we have this wonderful feature that's been featured on almost all devices since a VCR where you have a video in and then you can watch TV on your device.
4369064	4372287	All they're doing, what functionality are they really adding to Xbox?
4373848	4375990	I basically still need a cable box.
4376551	4379674	It's just my cable box is now running through my Xbox One.
4380034	4380775	That's my problem.
4380815	4385519	If it was like, hey, here's this brand new TV service that Microsoft's putting out.
4385840	4389483	You can access it through the Xbox 360 or the Xbox One.
4389823	4391185	You don't need a cable box.
4391525	4392386	That's a little different.
4393106	4393947	That's my problem.
4394547	4396308	That and their unveil of the console.
4396328	4402773	They focus strictly on a lot of the entertainment things, which people are like, come on, I want to know about games because this is a gaming console type thing.
4404454	4408777	I think, too, it's not that I necessarily dislike what Microsoft is doing.
4408937	4413761	And also, to be fair, it's not like this news made me drop down the money to get a PlayStation 4.
4414341	4415862	I had made that decision long before it.
4415922	4418344	But when I hear about this enhanced value, of course I get excited.
4418504	4419565	But it is all rumor.
4420265	4421506	It may pan out to be nothing.
4421787	4423428	And if it costs too much, I won't do it.
4423528	4429835	And if Sony talks all about TV during their Gamescom announcement and stuff, that might be a little boring.
4429875	4432097	And yeah, I'd still rag on them about that.
4432518	4436522	Like, okay, that's cool that you have this TV service coming, but I kind of want to know about your games.
4436542	4438604	Oh, unless they announce the Tester Season 4.
4438664	4439305	I can't wait.
4439485	4440045	I can't wait.
4440065	4440606	Oh, Rob.
4442688	4444809	DarkSakura, will you go on Tester Season 4?
4444989	4445269	No.
4445549	4447610	Because I remember we tried to get her to go on Season 3.
4447910	4448171	No.
4448611	4449711	They wouldn't want me anyway.
4449731	4452212	I'm too bitchy.
4453053	4456074	No, they would absolutely want you for being bitchy.
4456514	4465659	I would lay the smackdown on everybody and go, you know what, I remember when the only access we had to Sony in video games was when they made the Super Nintendo sound processor.
4467159	4468040	And some limited games.
4468560	4470901	And, well, you know how PlayStation started, right?
4471810	4474332	It was supposed to be the whole CD expansion for Super Nintendo, right?
4474552	4475032	Indeed.
4476713	4477013	Alright.
4477714	4479234	Anyhow, let's move on.
4479795	4481616	DarkSakura, one more story before release dates.
4482016	4483397	I was putting out my friend code.
4483957	4486098	I'm putting myself out.
4487559	4498305	Well, some people may or may not be happy about this, but the games for Windows Live Marketplace is closing on August 22nd, which is pretty much next week.
4499506	4521319	so anyway they put out an FAQ on Xbox.com so that for people who have purchased games on Windows Live and their DLC they'll still be able to play them but they won't be able to purchase additional content and basically they're afraid that there's people who are afraid that they're going to be pulling the games out of Steam as well
4521795	4524358	But as far as that, I don't really see anything about that.
4524378	4527041	They said that the games that are on Steam are still going to be on Steam.
4527522	4531226	It's just that the Microsoft points are going bye-bye, you know, which we already knew.
4531286	4537314	I think it's just because they're putting everything on their Windows Marketplace now and no point in having two different marketplaces.
4537414	4539897	They're putting everything out on their inconvenience marketplace.
4541678	4547280	Oh my god, you know, the Games for Windows marketplace, my only marketplace I buy games, said no one ever.
4547900	4549121	Said no one, exactly.
4550001	4561266	It's just, for the people who have bought things through there, they're really inconveniencing their consumers, but... There was a free game you got when you signed up for Games for Windows Live that had achievements in it.
4561666	4562886	I remember that's why I got it.
4564427	4565667	Tinker or something like that was the game?
4565687	4566048	Oh, Rob.
4566448	4566908	I don't remember.
4568792	4571455	I just know that they have achievements in like Solitaire now.
4571596	4575240	And I mean, it's kind of a big thing.
4575300	4579506	I mean, yeah, they're definitely working on getting all their stuff ready for the X-Bone.
4580527	4581168	But in the end...
4583472	4586393	Nobody could see me shrug, but that's all I can say is shrug.
4586613	4593455	And I shed another tear for my Microsoft Game Room, which was a part of Games for Windows Live.
4594256	4601118	So if you have that, my assumption is that you won't be able to buy the packs anymore because that was all integrated through Games for Windows Live.
4601698	4606079	Although, shit, that game's pretty much long gone if you don't have what you wanted out of that.
4606099	4607840	I haven't gotten a single thing on that.
4608657	4609739	I actually had a lot.
4609839	4611040	I had like 15 games.
4612682	4614644	Why do you think I was so mad when they pulled the plug on it?
4615004	4615505	Too soon.
4616446	4616806	Anyway.
4617547	4622212	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and out with the old, in with the new, I suppose.
4623024	4625865	Yes, this week is actually quite a bit of stuff coming out.
4625885	4630587	It's kind of a little bit of a kickoff for the fourth quarter, which is creeping up earlier every year.
4631747	4636789	So this week, Saints Row 4 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
4637249	4643091	Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Blacklist on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii U, and PC.
4644491	4649976	We also have The Walking Dead, a complete first season on the Vita.
4650877	4652998	And it has an additional DLC in there as well.
4653559	4659224	New Super Luigi U for the Wii U, and that's the physical disc version of that.
4660465	4665329	Also, the Bureau XCOM Declassified on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
4670313	4673677	And this isn't a game, but I still think it's interesting.
4673917	4679163	The GameStick, the second Android console, is finally making its way out.
4680304	4683688	So they're going to have that and the dock as well available for that.
4683988	4684168	And it's $79.99.
4684208	4685109	Ooh, undercutting the OUYA.
4688713	4689193	Yeah.
4689874	4690814	Alright, we'll see how that goes.
4691735	4692435	Moving to Japan.
4693515	4697417	On the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan, Disorder 6 in regular and limited edition.
4697877	4702240	Dungeons & Dragons Mysteria is out this week as well, which we've talked about before on the show.
4702720	4705421	The disc release, even though there's the download release too.
4706261	4709343	Medal of Honor Warfighter gets a price reduction as it moves into the best hits.
4709883	4717087	And also out this week, Super Robot Taisen OG Saga Masoukishin 3 Pride of Justice comes out on the PlayStation 3.
4718267	4723391	on the Xbox 360, because yes, there are still a few things here and there on the 360 in Japan.
4723631	4730436	Disorder 6 in its regular and limited edition, and Medal of Honor Warfighter gets that same price reduction on the 360 as well.
4731397	4738882	Moving to the handhelds, on the PlayStation Vita this week, Super Robot Taisen OG Saga, that same game I mentioned before, is out on the Vita as well.
4739503	4746628	Conception 2, Shichise no Michibiki to Mazuru no Akumu comes out this week as well.
4747108	4748169	I want to know what this is about.
4748729	4749189	Let's see.
4749749	4756093	Conception 2... Did you say 7 World something?
4756153	4757614	Trying to see what kind of game it is.
4758234	4761616	Looks like it might be like a tactical RPG-ish type of thing.
4762436	4763637	I've seen that design somewhere.
4763797	4765758	Yeah, very... Let me look at the name again?
4766018	4766178	Sure.
4767239	4768760	Well, here's the box art if you want to see it.
4768860	4769940	Well, yeah, but I can't.
4770240	4770961	That's 7 something.
4770981	4771461	God damn it.
4772998	4774059	7th World something and I don't know
4781088	4782789	Ikuma, translate for us, please.
4782969	4785451	We love you.
4785551	4786792	Ikuma-san is our hero.
4787092	4795898	On the Wii U this week, yes, the Wii U sees a release in the Wonderful 101, which is out in Japan on August the 24th, which I believe is the same day it's out here, right?
4796218	4797099	That's very soon.
4797699	4808406	And lastly, on the 3DS, that Saiyan Conception 2 game, as well as Nanami to Ishii ni Gabuko English Jotsatsu no Kutsu comes out.
4808766	4810707	Oh, I think that's an English teacher.
4810807	4813268	Yeah, let's learn English with cute anime girls.
4814968	4816089	No, learn with Nanami.
4816889	4816989	Oh.
4817630	4818630	Hold on, go back to the title.
4818650	4822711	Well, Nanami is missing her belly button on her... No, she has her belly button, we can see it.
4823112	4823812	On her shirt.
4824032	4826453	Yeah, it's like a study with Nanami.
4827182	4830866	and Nanami also is showing a little cleavage.
4831046	4836092	He said you need to link that other game to chat so that Ikuma-san can translate for us.
4836152	4839816	Alright, I will work on that while you travel to the UK.
4840076	4840657	I wish.
4841958	4844160	On the 20th, Disney Infinity for Damn Near Everything.
4845381	4848243	On the 22nd, we have Skullgirls for PC.
4848764	4849825	I want that game.
4850405	4861473	Splinter Cell Blacklist for Wii U. On the 23rd, Saints Row 4, XCOM, XCOM, XCOM, no, The Wonderful 101, which would be my reason for getting a Wii U, and Splinter Cell Blacklist.
4861993	4864475	Rob, if you get The Wonderful 101, I'm just going to move into your living room.
4864795	4868278	They have a demo available on Wii U. I've downloaded it, but I've not played it yet.
4868318	4869979	I need to see it.
4870099	4874242	Well, maybe after, well, I gotta go get Alan, so maybe during the week.
4875043	4877405	You better do it for him out of town.
4877485	4878305	Alan can walk.
4878986	4880808	Hard, hard, hard, hard.
4880908	4882549	If he's listening, he's going to cut you.
4882669	4883750	Alan, I was joking.
4884391	4884871	Don't cut me.
4886192	4889335	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.
4889395	4890036	But first, Loki.
4893806	4894146	Loki?
4895207	4895547	Hello?
4896207	4897748	Sorry, I was listening to a Nero song.
4898188	4898468	Anyways.
4898548	4899148	Wait, no.
4899288	4901109	What is more important than this show?
4901249	4901670	Nero song?
4903470	4904331	Let's talk Call of Duty.
4904431	4908953	Actually, I did watch the Call of Duty multiplayer preview thing that they did.
4908973	4910333	It looks kind of cool.
4911394	4912154	It was interesting.
4912194	4915156	They did some new stuff with it.
4915196	4918497	Like, for example, they have now more character creation in there.
4918897	4919538	You can actually...
4921912	4922672	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4943058	4945261	So that's kind of cross-platform as it is.
4945681	4947563	But the DLC thing is kind of neat.
4947603	4956313	So basically if you buy a season pass or whatever on Xbox 360, you'll be able to take it to Xbox One, same with PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4.
4958868	4960969	and that's not just limited to Call of Duty as well.
4961049	4963729	It's also something that Battlefield 4 will have as well.
4963789	4975812	So you can do a one-time transfer between the Xbox 360 and Xbox One and PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 for your stats, unlocks, ranks, award assignments and that kind of thing.
4976332	4986514	It's kind of lame though that it's a one-time deal for Battlefield 4 because what if I have an Xbox 360 at my work and an Xbox One at home and I want to
4988054	4988815	Play them both.
4989195	4990696	Why limit that?
4990896	4993418	I don't know why, but that's something that they're supporting.
4993718	5004445	And if it gets to Xbox One saying they're supporting the season pass guarantee, that this is going to apply for a lot of different things, including, well, they had mentioned Call of Duty Ghosts and Battlefield 4.
5004805	5007307	I'm wondering if it's other games as well.
5007327	5010529	They're going to have some sort of tie in there.
5013374	5017917	Do you think a lot of people will be using this or do you think people will just kind of already be upgrading or not?
5019098	5023682	As much as I go, oh yeah, this is a neat idea, I kind of think to myself, well God, you have to buy the games twice?
5023822	5025043	How many people are really going to do that?
5025143	5026504	There might be some people that will do that.
5026644	5042075	I think what's going to basically be is if, you know, say I want to buy Call of Duty this year and I'm not buying a next-gen system and then next year I want to, okay, we'll say mid-next year I want to buy a PlayStation 4 or something like that.
5042395	5045436	If I buy it on PlayStation 3, I can buy the Season Pass.
5045957	5047337	Like, I'll do that.
5047397	5052600	Buy the Season Pass and then, you know, I buy my new system and I know how to buy the Season Pass again.
5053080	5060524	I don't understand why it's such a big deal in the first place because they do a lot of cross-buy stuff already on the PlayStation Network.
5060964	5066066	I mean, I think this would be more news for Microsoft because they don't really do any of that cross-buy stuff.
5067827	5069548	So, I don't know.
5069568	5069608	It...
5072975	5080720	I guess it's a cool feature, but it's something that I think should be kind of expected instead of having to buy the content more than once.
5081801	5083122	But whatever.
5083222	5085484	I mean, I guess that's cool if they're doing that.
5085784	5089466	I guess we live in a day and age where they didn't have to.
5089566	5091688	Yeah, it's one of those things now.
5091788	5097212	And I was just going to check here real quick to see if we have that story later on about...
5099776	5120078	uh yeah i guess we do later on but uh you know a lot of this nowadays they're talking about features that they necessarily they they're already there but you may not be completely familiar with them or you may have forgotten that they have them there and now they're new you know it's like you know this whole uh what was it with the xbox um
5120959	5122180	There was just something recently.
5122460	5124541	There's something coming up in Part B. Yeah, I guess.
5125262	5126283	No, it wasn't that.
5126383	5127103	It wasn't that one.
5127183	5130245	It was the game sharing thing.
5130265	5131966	Remember we talked about it last week?
5131986	5133507	Yes, you ranted about that last week.
5133627	5139792	Yes, that's not a new thing, but it's something that a lot of people don't really think about, or maybe they can spin it in a way that makes sense.
5139812	5141493	It might be better on Xbox One, to be fair.
5141513	5143474	It is with the whole live sharing.
5143554	5145555	It's kind of cool, but I don't know.
5145976	5146236	All right.
5148437	5154784	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase BAR.
5155445	5157407	This would be awesome if it's actually happening.
5157507	5158028	No idea.
5158408	5162432	But there's a thing going on in Japan this week called the Pokemon Game Show.
5162973	5166356	And during this event, Nintendo actually teased...
5166957	5171198	Potentially, don't get your hopes up, but a Pokemon title for the Wii U in 3D.
5171659	5177680	Which would be weird because there's never been a straight up Pokemon main franchise game on the consoles.
5177700	5178821	They've always been the handhelds.
5179301	5181542	Now there's been tons of spin-off stuff.
5181822	5183022	Yeah, like the Rumble stuff.
5183162	5183902	Yeah, exactly.
5184102	5185303	But, you know, Pinball.
5185643	5187163	Well, no, I guess Pinball was on the handhelds too.
5187404	5188164	Pokemon Snap.
5188864	5189764	Yeah, Pokemon Snap.
5189784	5191625	And then there was the GameCube Coliseum.
5192666	5197170	They also have the weird spin-off games, the Poke Park games that have been on the Wii.
5197950	5202734	Well, what happened in this video is that it was playing on the main screen.
5202774	5207759	It had a CG Pikachu leading Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander in a Game Boy World.
5207799	5215766	But at the end of the trailer, there was a 3D Wii U Pokemon title that showed Lusario going face-to-face with Blaziken in a futuristic city.
5216587	5219029	And I did think to myself, I was like, you know...
5220549	5226017	If Nintendo wanted to turn the Wii U around real quick, real quick, here's a way to do it.
5230846	5234989	I think it's going to be another Coliseum title or something.
5235009	5237831	I don't think it's going to be anything like a mainstream Pokemon game.
5237931	5250539	And you know, and I said before, with the whole Skylanders and Disney Infinity stuff, I'm like, it's really only, and I know that Nintendo is doing it in some capacity, but if that's successful or whatever, it could just get even bigger.
5250639	5257704	Like, I know with the download thing where you can only get the figures at GameStop or whatever, it does feel in some way like getting the foot in the water.
5257724	5259285	Figures are going to be $90 now, by the way.
5262426	5263246	They're scarce.
5263747	5268567	And you can't download the figure on the internet, so I don't know what to tell you if you get screwed on those.
5268587	5271268	Technically, that's not entirely true.
5272608	5284350	Because there are apps, and they have this with Skylanders already, there are apps where people have recorded the RFID, the near-field communication stuff, and you can actually simulate that with your phone.
5284370	5288831	You just put your phone on the communication thing and you can play as that stuff.
5288851	5289151	In fact, I...
5290211	5294116	I don't think my phone supports that but that'd be kind of interesting to check out with Disney Infinity.
5294216	5296139	That might be a way to get around buying figures.
5297801	5300184	It's a strange form of piracy.
5301285	5301606	It's like...
5302816	5303997	I don't know what you're going to call that.
5304117	5304737	You know what?
5305258	5312383	We need to travel back to a time when there wasn't these fucking figures you had to buy to get the whole experience of the game.
5312423	5313224	It's all about patches.
5313764	5315766	No, there was no patches back then either.
5316146	5317887	If the game was fucked, it was fucked.
5318488	5323111	Games back then went through a process called testing, which I think is sometimes skipped now.
5324372	5326754	There was a seal of approval, goddammit.
5327174	5331597	As is the case of Disney Infinity on PlayStation 3, if Twitter is any indication.
5331638	5331978	Ha ha ha.
5332438	5332718	Yeah.
5333159	5340983	Anyhow, DarkSakura, why don't you step into the gaming vault and take us back to a time when games didn't have all this shit.
5341964	5343725	By the way, I did just beat Find Me.
5344385	5345066	Oh, congrats.
5345286	5346507	Did I slay the final boss?
5346967	5348308	Actually, a wandering hero did.
5349708	5351049	But you almost did it.
5351510	5352870	It was one hit point off.
5352910	5353351	So, Rob?
5353631	5354551	Story of my life.
5354691	5356733	Somebody comes in and snatches all my glory.
5356933	5357733	You said snatch.
5357813	5358654	Story of my life.
5359114	5360195	The game is Guilty Gear X.
5362677	5363097	Guilty Gear X
5387237	5390618	And it's supposed to take place a few weeks after the first game.
5391859	5392999	There's a new Commander gear.
5393039	5400682	Basically, it takes everything that was good about the, uh... About the, uh...
5403078	5403859	Thank you for watching!
5421552	5423174	So, moving forward.
5423214	5426297	So yeah, the Dreamcast 1 had a limited release.
5426537	5431703	It came with a special mini-CD that had different artworks that you could view on the PC.
5432423	5439851	There was a Type A, Type B, and Type C. And it had different images printed on the GD-ROM disc instead.
5440271	5444476	As far as the characters in it, it has a bunch of people from the first game.
5444616	5451143	It had Soul Bad Guy, which is funny because Soul Bad Guy was actually voiced by the creator of the series.
5452717	5464219	and had Mei, Baiken, Kaikisuke, Potemkin, Chip Xanath, Meliorage, Zatoan, Axel Lowe, and Testament.
5464739	5472781	It had new characters like Jim, Kurado Berry, Johnny, Anji, Mito, Venom, Dizzy, and Roboki.
5473181	5477722	So it was a really fun fighting game.
5477862	5478142	I mean...
5479884	5484046	I actually have the Guilty Gear Petite on Wonderswan, by the way, which was also super fun.
5484066	5486047	But I've enjoyed every game in the series.
5486087	5490850	But I'd have to say that I didn't really enjoy the series until this one came out.
5491450	5497333	As far as other versions came out, there was X+, that was an enhanced version that had two extra characters.
5497413	5500695	It came out on the PS2 in Japan only.
5501316	5501476	And...
5502556	5504857	That was on November 29th.
5504978	5513542	And then there was basically just a bare-bones port of the Dreamcast 1 that didn't have any of the extra stuff from the Japanese version that came out in the US and Europe.
5514723	5518445	The two new characters were Cliff Anderson and Justice.
5519565	5521126	It had different game modes.
5521466	5523687	It had all kinds of different moves.
5523727	5524568	It was really neat.
5524648	5527329	And more in the story mode and password mode.
5529190	5535473	The advanced version came out on GBA and it was basically the arcade version.
5536034	5538755	And it had all of the characters except for RoboKey.
5539475	5542857	But it was just different stuff.
5543297	5547639	There was version 1.5 as well that had some of the stuff from Guilty Gear XX.
5548299	5553422	There was Petite, which is the one I mentioned earlier, the Wonderswan Color version, which was...
5554142	5554722	Pretty fun.
5554783	5557264	I mean, it was actually super cutesy, guilty gear.
5557284	5560006	That's all I can say, and I've beaten that several times.
5560486	5566771	Petite 2 came out, and it also had all the arcade characters, except for Bike and Dizzy and Robokai.
5568852	5570273	It had Fanny coming back.
5570373	5575797	I have to laugh every time I say that, because that's also slang for girl bits.
5576317	5577017	It was really cute.
5577558	5583722	The one I owned, though, was Petite, and then there was Club and Raid of Arms, but honestly, the Dreamcast one, awesome.
5585401	5586462	And now the story about this.
5587003	5595093	Back in the day when we used to rip our Dreamcast games, we actually found out the hard way.
5595173	5598637	This is the game that my friend Julie learned to...
5600639	5601919	No, I forgot her.
5602540	5603580	Everyone's forgotten her.
5603740	5605060	She's a figment of my imagination.
5605240	5605540	You know what?
5605580	5606220	She may as well be.
5606240	5607761	I haven't heard from her in ages.
5608461	5614022	Anyway, Julie was trying to figure out how to rip Dreamcast games, and this was the game she tried on.
5614082	5616963	So we had many, many copies of the soundtrack.
5617983	5619724	Many copies of the soundtrack.
5620504	5623865	And learned quite a bit about the data that went to GBROM.
5626545	5629706	Or I should say GDROM, the GigaDisc.
5631781	5636364	So, great soundtrack, great game, great characters, lots of cosplay fun.
5636384	5641006	I, you know, still have my Baiken costume, except for the claw, which belonged to Evan.
5644488	5645269	Cosplay memories.
5645762	5647023	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5672800	5695420	and oh my god I had the worst cramp and I ended up just having to think of another way to tuck it into the sleeve because it was a pain to cosplay but it was fun costume all right there it is your classic game of the week Guilty Gear X all right it doesn't it doesn't feel like the game is that old but I guess it's over 10 years old well in the first Guilty Gear you know was PlayStation
5695876	5696156	All right.
5696657	5700141	Well, that's going to do it for this half of Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere.
5700161	5708970	We've got plenty more show coming up, including some rapid-fire news, the Fugle Question of the Week, emails, and your phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
5709170	5712294	When we come back with all more Orange Lounge Radio.
5719042	5721604	Hi, welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
5721664	5728888	We are live on this Sunday evening, August the 18th, 2013, with the 516th episode of our program.
5729508	5731049	And of course, as always, you can join us.
5731109	5735772	If you are listening live, you can join us in our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.
5736272	5744457	And if you're listening on the podcast feed, be it through an iTunes download or through Stitcher or whatever, well, we appreciate you guys listening along as well, especially...
5745097	5750601	You know, it's a long show, so I know some of you dedicate a lot of time to listen throughout the week, so we appreciate it.
5750641	5755124	Hope we're helping you get through your work day or your commute, wherever you choose to listen to this program.
5755284	5756185	Rob, I have a request.
5756405	5756725	Okay.
5757206	5762049	When we're officially into Final Fantasy land, you need to make a version of Sassy Pants.
5763630	5767052	I thought about naming my character that, but... Lil' Poundcake is cute, though.
5767192	5776678	Yeah, well, I named my character in Final Fantasy XIV Lil' Poundcake, and she's a little... I still want to say Taru-Tarus, because that's the word in Final Fantasy XI, but I guess they're... Lalafel, or Falafel.
5776718	5777659	I call them Falafels.
5777999	5778979	She's a little falafel.
5779580	5780841	And, yeah, Lil' Poundcake.
5781241	5783742	And somebody actually asked me in the show... Oh, no, it was you.
5783762	5785183	It was me, because I was asking everybody.
5785223	5787905	Yeah, you're like, where did the inspiration for your name come from?
5787945	5791227	Because there are, like, a diverse amount of... My favorite was Sprinkles Galore.
5791647	5791887	Yeah.
5792608	5793588	And Seymour Guylove.
5794149	5795990	There was a character I saw called FapFap.
5796851	5797711	I saw FapFap.
5798292	5799413	And Captain Obvious.
5799493	5800693	I bet you did, you dirty hoe.
5800734	5801294	You know what?
5801474	5802575	I saw Captain Obvious.
5802935	5803155	Yeah.
5803475	5805777	And I also saw, what was the other one?
5805797	5807038	I saw Ianto Jones.
5807158	5808559	And I said, okay, Torchwood?
5808579	5809800	And they're like, yeah, big Torchwood fans.
5809820	5810360	I was like, cool.
5810901	5813042	But you were like, what's the inspiration for your name?
5813082	5816705	And some are named after philosophers or an anime or whatever.
5816725	5819347	And I'm like, my name comes from RuPaul's Drag Race.
5822054	5824436	I was actually super surprised that I got the names I got, though.
5825057	5828100	Well, when there's first name and last name, it's much easier to get the names.
5828120	5830562	Yeah, but I was going for specific Homestuck characters.
5830983	5831203	Yeah.
5831503	5833545	So, I was like, why not?
5833605	5836408	Because I was making a cat girl and wanted to name her after one of the cat trolls.
5836648	5842054	I was being asked in chat during the break at live.vognetwork.com by Sailor Venus, who's in our chat tonight.
5842094	5842354	Hello.
5842374	5842514	Hello.
5842734	5843675	Sessy's the best
5863263	5865806	I have ADD character at this point.
5865886	5870050	I used to raid with my monk, so I guess that's my main.
5870070	5870650	Was it Gordita?
5870750	5871831	She would be the best geared.
5871911	5872772	No, Kalmain.
5872892	5873293	Kalmain.
5873613	5874514	Was my monk.
5874914	5876456	But I had my priest before that.
5876576	5878758	I had Chakwas, my priest, who I raided with.
5879178	5886145	I have Sassy on Alliance, who I did get to 90, and I did some five-mans with, and I've geared her that way, but I haven't really done any raids.
5886625	5891007	I've got your Rissa close to being raid ready.
5891307	5897089	See, the character I was playing the most two months ago was Chocolina, my hunter, who's PvP.
5897309	5898950	I had my PvP phase.
5898990	5901011	It's hard to PvP on a hunter, though.
5901511	5902651	Well, that was the fun of it!
5904192	5904552	You know what?
5904592	5906813	PvP is the whole reason why I never finish Children's Week.
5907834	5908254	Oh, yeah.
5908314	5910115	It can be... Stupid PvP bullshit.
5910195	5912716	Honestly, if you're going to do PvP, just turn off chat.
5913056	5913917	It'll make your life easier.
5914577	5914857	All right.
5915257	5921079	Anyhow, we could talk MMOs all night, and I do on Wednesday nights on a show called Horde House, 7 o'clock Pacific.
5921099	5921720	Pluggedy, pluggedy.
5922080	5923600	And for the record, I didn't get Nepeta.
5923660	5924221	I got Mulan.
5926198	5927320	What unique context.
5927340	5930604	Remember how I talked about the podcast and Stitcher listeners earlier?
5930644	5934068	Queen Simia in chat asked if I got Nepeta Lajon, which I didn't.
5934088	5936071	I got Mulan, which is the one I wanted.
5936251	5936672	There you go.
5936872	5937112	All right.
5937333	5939295	But Nepeta's cute, but I wanted Mulan.
5940056	5944442	Let's go into rapid fire news tonight and some other gaming news we're going to go over quickly.
5945206	5945586	All right.
5946186	5950488	So let's talk a little bit about discounts.
5951888	5954849	The Vita is actually dropping in price, apparently.
5955670	5956610	Actually, it's not apparently.
5956910	5957690	It's going to happen.
5958631	5959731	But this is something else.
5960351	5963853	During Gamescom, I guess, they're probably going to make this announcement as well.
5964373	5972216	But I guess the launch versions of the system, the 3G Vita launch bundle and also the Wi-Fi version are dropping down to $200.
5972276	5972356	Wow.
5973876	6001079	and also at the same time they're going to be dropping the price of the greatest hits games I guess for $15 a piece and that's for PlayStation 3 the other thing too which I don't think is on here and hasn't been announced yet that also includes new bundles that happen to be coming out the new starter bundles which you know there is one that happens to be coming out on Tuesday for The Walking Dead just saying so you can get those for $200 now
6002140	6011089	Also, for $200, and this is allegedly a rumor, but it's not, there is a 12GB PlayStation 3 coming to North America.
6011149	6012050	Now, I know what you're thinking.
6012451	6012951	12GB?
6012991	6013892	That's awfully small.
6014333	6015894	That's flash storage that they have on there.
6015974	6018457	But, you will be able to add a hard drive.
6019277	6037545	to it as well so it's a good place if you want to if you're planning on adding your own hard drive anyways might as well not spend any more money than you have to and 12 gigabytes would be enough to install Grand Theft Auto 5 I'm just saying which is apparently all a person needs right that's really all a person needs yeah you know what you just need to talk to Dan because he's all kinds of happy about that game
6039404	6041565	is going to encompass a lot of my time.
6041845	6043186	That's all I'm saying.
6043466	6045907	Anyways, Fantasia.
6046067	6050389	Coming soon to VOG, the Grand Theft Auto 5 show, because it's all Loki's ever going to be able to talk about.
6050409	6051950	They already have a Grand Theft Auto 5 show.
6052290	6053130	My God, really?
6053150	6054791	GTA 5 o'clock.
6054811	6055071	You know what?
6055111	6055652	That should surprise me.
6055672	6057132	It's a UK show, and it's great.
6057272	6057672	Good for them.
6057712	6058153	That's great.
6058373	6059293	They are fantastic.
6059333	6059813	That's awesome.
6059873	6066416	But hey, you know, since I will be spending most of my time online, I could probably guess Sun Hoard House.
6067317	6067417	Yeah.
6067837	6068618	You sure could!
6069619	6071740	Horde House was a Warcraft-only show, but now it isn't.
6071760	6072561	It's all online games.
6072581	6075703	So yes, you could guest on Horde House to talk Grand Theft Auto V online.
6075923	6077765	Because Lord knows none of us will be playing it.
6079026	6081247	And you're really doing yourself a disservice.
6081307	6081768	I'm kidding.
6082348	6083689	I'm super curious.
6083769	6084370	But anyway...
6084970	6101234	it's not all about murdering people you can play golf and do yoga oh yay yoga oh man hey yoga is my favorite thing in Final Fantasy 14 I don't know about you and that golfing and warcraft that's the reason to plunk down the money right there you know what
6105139	6108821	Fantasia Music Evolved, a new game coming from Harmonix.
6108881	6118665	They also have some more original pieces coming to the game, including some works from Inan Zur.
6120626	6123447	He did some music in Fallout 3.
6125268	6138977	and he's going to be doing some original versions of different takes on Vivaldi, Four Seasons, Night on the Bald Mountain, and stuff like that.
6139537	6144620	Also, I guess he's arranged the orchestral mix of Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody in the game.
6145401	6146401	That sounds interesting.
6147322	6152085	And of course, that's coming out sometime in 2014 on both Xbox platforms.
6154147	6168897	And this is a little strange, but they have, I guess it's going to be one of those announcements at Gamescom, but PlayStation Vita Pets coming to the Vita.
6169457	6172279	It's like Nintendogs, if the dogs talked.
6173600	6174220	They talk.
6175000	6177962	Here's that killer app that's going to sell a million betas.
6178162	6180624	It's weird that they're talking.
6182124	6183385	I don't want you to talk.
6183605	6184166	Exactly.
6185206	6196273	And they talk like that generic after school TV kids Disney show or something like that that's really annoying and grinding on your brain.
6196613	6201656	It would really only be awesome if you could take your Playstation pets and import them into Tokyo Jungle.
6202936	6203957	That would be awesome.
6204057	6204877	That could be pretty cool.
6205217	6205477	See?
6206397	6207738	You and I need to start a game studio.
6208458	6209398	Tokyo Jungle.
6209418	6211399	DarkSakura could come visit once in a while.
6211759	6214520	Starts off like Nintendogs and then it gets really dark.
6216641	6217481	Now that I like.
6217881	6221242	It's like Battle Royale for dogs and cats.
6221362	6224684	No, but then you talk pet cruelty and I'm like, no, we can't have that.
6224704	6227705	Oh, come on, you're the one who named your horse Politary and beat her.
6230015	6231115	and Derby Owners Club
6254203	6258084	As long as it's over the top, then that's fine.
6258124	6260825	Like, you know, I look at a game like, remember Bungie Ferret Tossing?
6261225	6261966	That game's hilarious.
6261986	6262726	That one's over the top.
6262746	6269788	There's another game, and once again, the name is escaping me, that has, like, dogs with tank cannons on them.
6270188	6279451	And I don't remember what it's called, but it's something that... It's got a few games in the series, and it was on PlayStation 2 and stuff, but they had... It's, like, literally, they have, like...
6280948	6281848	Thanks for watching!
6298376	6323879	Thunderbluff was it was it there or was it somewhere closer to human lands where there were the metal saga by the way where there were the hamsters and the rabbits that would suddenly you know have knives oh yeah yeah yeah I just hung out there for hours just watching them because I was bored but anyway but like you follow one of them around and you can actually watch them transform but like there was the rabbit with combat knife and the hamster with the Uzi and
6324159	6326861	Alright, y'all and your animal fighting issues.
6326881	6328743	No, no, no, see, this is what I'm telling you.
6328763	6329323	That was awesome.
6329664	6331365	See, that's from Metal Saga right there.
6331745	6332686	Okay, I have to play this.
6333327	6333967	I gotta move on.
6333987	6335549	I want a Shiba Inu with a bazooka.
6336610	6337730	Moving on, moving on.
6338351	6340693	That's what Call of Duty Ghost scenes right there.
6341794	6343055	Dogs with giant bazookas.
6344096	6350942	Alright, I don't know how many of you guys have checked this out, but there's the Humble Origin bundle, which is available from the, yeah, the Humble bundle.
6350962	6351242	I bought it.
6351562	6352403	Dead Space 3 and Medal of Honor
6374617	6375538	I do want to play Dead Space 3
6395237	6397920	I've already got a bunch of those other games I took my pills
6412202	6419764	See, I, on the other hand, I only... I paid the full amount, because I like Battlefield 3, but I just haven't played it yet.
6420265	6421265	I like the idea of it.
6422185	6431488	I just... I'm not installing Origin, though, but I... Mainly I paid more than the average, because they always add in extra games towards the end of the week.
6431888	6433229	So I'm curious to see what those are.
6433469	6435069	And I wanted Mirror's Edge and Burnout.
6435289	6436390	Burnout Paradise, dude!
6436410	6436730	That is the...
6437310	6437770	Come on.
6437991	6443554	At least a dollar you can pay for one of the best racing games this generation.
6443574	6445335	I was going to say, the charities are great.
6445616	6447457	Like, you have human rights campaigns.
6447537	6449298	You can just have all of your money go to that.
6449818	6455662	American Cancer Society, San Francisco AIDS Foundation, American Red Cross, WOTC.
6455722	6457223	I mean, this is great.
6457784	6458244	Very cool.
6458744	6459825	So, yeah.
6459905	6460986	I mean, it's for charity.
6461086	6466409	So, hate on Origin all you want, but it's pretty hard to get mad at this.
6466550	6466910	Although,
6469452	6470852	I've already got those three of those games.
6470892	6473334	Maybe I'm just being the Grinch, but you have to wonder.
6473374	6474595	You have to wonder.
6476256	6478037	Are they just trying to get Origin put on more computers?
6478538	6478878	Yep.
6479238	6482160	Yep, because then they're going to say, look how many people have Origin.
6482640	6484262	Origin's a successful service.
6484282	6485442	Look how many people have Origin.
6486623	6492227	I hate going there because at the end of the day, this is a great thing, but it's just that you can't help but wonder.
6492667	6493768	And you know people are talking about it.
6493968	6497392	I'm super close to patching my Mass Effect 3 so I don't have to go through Origin.
6497452	6503578	I almost bought the Deep Silver bundle, but the problem is I bought the THQ bundle and that had a lot of the games that were in the Deep Silver bundle.
6503598	6504259	That's very true.
6504799	6509664	And so I was like, eh, I just can't see myself buying yet another copy of Saints Row the 3rd.
6510779	6515402	Brad from PodCulture says, with these bundles, I always put all my fundage towards the charities.
6515442	6516703	That's at live.vognetwork.com.
6516723	6518484	Yes, you can decide how your money is split.
6518824	6526068	The cool thing about this one is that since EA is not getting any of the money, usually the indie developers, you can give them a chunk of the pot and by default they get some.
6526388	6531451	But this time, it's all charities and what they call the humble bundle tip.
6531691	6531871	Yeah.
6531891	6531971	Yeah.
6532725	6533125	StarCraft MMO
6554119	6575516	StarCraft Universe which was originally World of StarCraft it will allow players to create a character and log in to an alternate history StarCraft the Zerg and Protoss hybrids are around I guess Blizzard does bless this project now so StarCraft Universe they can make this in the StarCraft 2 engine it just can't be called World of StarCraft that was the deal I remember they changed something
6576377	6579760	So they won $80,000 that they're getting on Kickstarter, and here's why.
6580741	6595075	This is for the creator Ryan Winsen and the people he's working with to get additional pylons and focus solely on creating the game and getting it out there in 2014 for an open beta, which I'm assuming means I want to be able to quit my job and do this full-time and actually get it out in a timely manner.
6595716	6596897	That's what I'm reading.
6596937	6597758	That sounds about right, yeah.
6598078	6622414	There are stretch goals and other rewards Zerg character class if they make $100,000 And so on and so on Let me see where they're at right now Just kind of curious for an update here on this Sunday evening They've got 22 days to go and they've almost made half their money They're at $36,000 So not bad They're ahead of the curve a little bit if they can keep that going Although I think most Kickstarters you want the earlier the better So good luck
6624895	6631078	I'm surprised Blizzard's kind of letting them do that because aren't they raising money based off of StarCraft IP in a way?
6631958	6634479	I'm sure they've got some kind of deal worked out.
6634579	6634960	I guess.
6635180	6637561	And I guess at the end of the day, it's all promo for StarCraft too.
6637721	6637921	Yeah.
6638341	6639322	All right.
6639682	6645805	Anyhow, speaking of Blizzard, another beta that launched this weekend that has a lot of people's attention is Hearthstone.
6646345	6647725	The Hearthstone closed beta.
6647765	6650867	This is Blizzard's free-to-play little card game that they've got.
6651227	6654028	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6673895	6687551	I do think it's very interesting timing on Blizzard's part, and I don't think it's any coincidence at all that the Hearthstone beta started out of nowhere this weekend, when a lot of World of Warcraft and hardcore Blizzard fans I think were a little bored waiting for patch 5.4, and eh, let me go...
6689033	6693217	Let me go try this other open beta that's going on right now.
6693277	6695138	I'm going to go try this Final Fantasy XIV.
6695559	6703486	So Blizzard releases this to their most vocal people and the people that are some heavy influences to the community and so forth.
6703826	6706909	And suddenly, none of them care about Final Fantasy XIV anymore.
6706929	6708130	They're all playing this.
6709411	6712694	That's a smart move on Blizzard's part, but I will say this.
6713734	6716455	And I'll expand a little bit on this on Horde House, but I can't help myself.
6716475	6717336	I have to say something now.
6718116	6722058	Because of this, I've seen some people shading Final Fantasy XIV a little bit.
6722438	6725199	And I'm just going to say, don't shade a game you haven't played.
6725479	6726279	That's ignorant.
6726899	6730981	One of these is a free-to-play trading card game that's going to be on tablets.
6731401	6735743	The other one of these is a very intricate MMO that's going to be on PlayStation 3.
6736543	6739124	They're not alike in any way, shape, or form.
6739485	6739705	Huh?
6739965	6740205	NPC.
6741105	6741765	Yes, and PC.
6742645	6744906	What are you so threatened by, y'all?
6745746	6746826	What's so threatening?
6747526	6747826	Anyway.
6747906	6748846	Because people like to be right.
6749687	6751747	And people like their thing to be better.
6752087	6756328	Yes, and that's kind of like blind fandom, and it's a little bit ridiculous, people.
6756768	6757188	Come on.
6758088	6758588	So, anyway.
6758648	6760388	I'm going to give you all a piece of advice.
6761229	6766709	You can like item A and also like item B. I can like Lady Gaga and Katy Perry?
6767110	6767430	No.
6767590	6769630	I can like Supernatural and Doctor Who.
6769650	6769690	No.
6769810	6770090	What?
6770230	6772951	I can like the current Doctor Who and the classic Doctor Who.
6772991	6773351	What?
6773791	6775471	I know, right?
6775551	6776051	No.
6777991	6778232	Rob.
6778592	6778792	What?
6779032	6781332	I can play Dragon Age 2 and the Mass Effect series.
6781912	6783773	PlayStation and Xbox?
6784813	6788613	No, you have to... Loki, that's just cross... You have to buy one or the other.
6788653	6789354	Hey, guess what?
6789934	6791034	I have both and a Wii.
6795075	6795915	My God, people.
6796755	6797035	I know.
6798635	6800917	Cats and Dogs, Living Together, Mass Hysteria.
6801978	6802819	I love that line.
6803840	6808825	Anyway, I look forward to playing this beta at some point whenever I get my little access.
6808925	6811148	By the way, I do have to make a little tangent.
6811168	6815832	I forgot to mention I was playing Dragon Age 2 because I actually stopped Final Fantasy XIV to play Dragon Age 2.
6816733	6822259	I totally missed one part where I could start the romance with Fenris, so I totally cheated.
6823400	6829104	and did the debug mode so I could just change all the romance options.
6829585	6831887	And Becky's husband said, so you gave him roofies?
6832808	6834589	I was like, okay, that's pretty funny.
6835250	6837772	All right, DarkSakura, you have some rapid fire news for us.
6838368	6843490	I do, and one of them is about Shin Megami Tensei, if I can actually get to Safari.
6844630	6846851	There is a UK release date.
6847011	6852933	It is going to be, that's actually Shin Megami Tensei, Devil Summoner, Soul Hackers.
6853413	6859396	The European release date is going to be on September, moved from September 13th to September 20th.
6860796	6868102	and it's going to be available digitally on the 3DS eShop on the following week on the 25th of September.
6868763	6871125	So that is the official release date for that.
6871365	6872286	Sorry guys in the UK.
6873587	6877690	We also have a date for Castle of Illusion Remaster in the UK.
6877730	6879812	It's going to be September 4th and it will be £10.
6879852	6879892	So...
6882114	6882955	Castlevania, Mirror of Fate HD
6897242	6924752	it has a list date that's on PlayAsia and it says it's going to be for PS3 and Xbox 360 and saying that the collection will have the first Lords of Shadow, all the DLC and an exclusive demo of Lords of Shadow 2 and will be out in October yeah it's going to be part of the Lords of Shadow collection since Lords of Shadow 2 got delayed to next year
6925385	6932630	Also, Brazil's games rating board had, for December 2012, I'm sorry.
6934832	6940036	In December 2012, Mirror of Fate was on the Brazil rating board.
6940876	6946741	And they're also saying that there's going to be a PC and Wii U one, but there's nothing listed on PlayAsia.
6947221	6949763	So, that's it.
6950584	6950964	All right.
6952034	6956039	It's sad that actually that's like almost the only game.
6956119	6958782	I mean, Konami has hardly any games coming out.
6959283	6961205	Pro Evo and this.
6961505	6963207	I mean, that's it.
6963508	6965750	And then next year... Metal Gear Solid 5.
6966011	6966892	Phantom Pain, right?
6966912	6967813	Yeah, Metal Gear Solid 5.
6967853	6972138	But I mean, shit, they're releasing stuff less often than Capcom is nowadays.
6972366	6974148	Don't they have a lot of kiddie stuff though?
6974509	6975450	They're all mobile now.
6976851	6978734	They don't have a lot of kiddie licenses anymore.
6978854	6979815	No DDR anymore.
6981017	6983219	Not even Karaoke Revolution anymore.
6985041	6986263	Let's get to the Fugle Question of the Week.
6994838	6998001	Every week we ask our Facebook and our Google Plus communities a question.
6998021	7001424	You take those two words, you slam them together, you get... Google!
7002545	7003305	Here's the question.
7003345	7007969	There's rumors out there that Sony is making some moves to launch an online TV service on the PlayStation 4.
7008570	7011812	Certainly similar TV integrative features are a part of the Xbox One as well.
7011892	7015235	How important is the integration of television into your video game console?
7015676	7017677	Is this sort of service something you are interested in?
7018138	7022762	Or do you think Sony and Microsoft should focus less on these online TV networks and more on the games?
7023963	7025424	Redertainment on Google Plus says,
7047345	7048486	Actdeft says, E3VL says, E3VL says,
7072621	7093197	Joe C says I live in the UK so it's probably of no consequence to me as these services are non-existent severely limited over here I don't like too many services competing with each other though I don't want to subscribe to them all so I always feel as though I'm missing out that's a good point like sometimes you have to feel like you have to do Hulu and Netflix and you know everybody wants a little piece of that
7093877	7095519	and Techie Q says, bring it on.
7095779	7100063	It's a small but big step into breaking the traditional TV cable model.
7100623	7102104	Those are the answers on Google+.
7102144	7108530	Some of them, I had to shorten them all because I want to try to get in a lot of people tonight and we still have a lot more answers here over on Facebook.
7108550	7110051	So I'm going to try to shorten some of these.
7110492	7120601	So I'm sorry if I don't read your full answer, but I'm going to encourage everybody to go over to facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and our Google Plus page, Orange Lounge Radio and read the full answers themselves.
7121221	7128425	CriticalMyth says it's not that important to me given that I have several other options currently that I'm very comfortable with.
7129366	7136690	Renee, our friend from Koopa Club says you know it's not really that important to me to have my television services integrated into my video game console.
7137110	7145075	I understand the concept of wanting to encapsulate everything into one unit or box if you will to just have one place to go for all your entertainment needs.
7145855	7149398	Lauren Z says, what if we had a gaming console that actually focused on gaming?
7149839	7151560	I know, I know, it's an odd concept, but just think about it.
7151681	7152421	It could work, right?
7152982	7153242	No?
7153622	7154743	Okay.
7154823	7164312	Ragenator says, if this was a year or two ago, I would have said it is very important, but nowadays I'd probably say that it's not at all important.
7165833	7170557	Shane says, they already do that stuff for me as they all play Hulu and Netflix.
7170677	7172099	Cable TV is for chumps.
7174752	7178073	Patty E says, I get a gaming system for games.
7178473	7186336	I enjoy the fact that I can stream video from something like Netflix or Hulu or directly from my computer, but that does not at all contribute to why I want the system.
7187756	7194759	Marcello L says, all these TV features are nice, but really, I buy a PlayStation 4 or Xbox One for games.
7195219	7199500	Now, if the games had a feature that tied to the channel you're watching or show, that would be interesting.
7199780	7200841	Still not buying an Xbox One.
7201961	7230383	uh Daniel S says I don't watch TV so this won't really affect me I mean the wife will use it so whatever I just find it funny because if this is true Sony will get compliments for adding on to their system but when Microsoft makes changes to be more like Sony they get slammed the console war is a fun show so kind of bringing up a point that was brought up by a chatter earlier uh Mason D says I think they need to spend more time making use of the peripherals that they put out think of if Yu-Gi-Oh with the PlayStation Eye that's Mason says you know Sony stop putting out all this shit and then not supporting it
7231195	7231595	Interesting.
7233116	7234938	For the Fallen Dreams answers and says,
7257614	7265000	That's definitely an audience I'm sure these TV things are going for, is people that are using their PlayStation 3 as their Blu-ray device.
7265540	7267622	So yeah, I'm sure there's a lot of people like that.
7268342	7268603	SSJ100Matt says...
7279851	7300807	Gally89 says it makes no difference to me as I don't have cable I would be interested in an a la carte service though Geeklet says it's always handy but I don't think it's really a decision maker I'm fine with a console just playing games and lastly Mike B says the future is no TV as we know it only on demand and pay for what you want to watch without commercials
7302065	7309991	you know what those quickly those are some abbreviated comments from Facebook and Google Plus check out the full answers on those respective pages yes Jamie
7310307	7314449	I'm just saying, a lot of people are repeating pretty much what's already going on in a lot of homes.
7314489	7315550	It definitely goes on in mine.
7316070	7317891	We have a computer hooked up to our TV.
7318331	7321353	So anything that we want to watch, it's either stuff we've downloaded.
7321833	7325295	We use Hulu Plus and we have Netflix.
7325936	7327396	Anything that we want to watch, it's all there.
7327757	7331259	Becky got rid of her cable so that she could use Amazon Prime.
7332059	7333580	She's really been happy with Amazon Prime.
7333600	7334981	She gets shows for Julia in that way.
7335581	7336982	So I'm just saying, it's really...
7337862	7338303	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7349145	7358413	I think, you know, as much as, you know, Mike B kind of took us out there with the whole there's only going to be on demand, you know, my mind kind of goes there, but I actually don't think that's true.
7359014	7365940	Because, yes, I think a lot of TV as we know it today will go that way and a lot of the expanded cable channels and so forth.
7365980	7369864	But keep in mind, there's one thing that on demand can't do, and that's live.
7370504	7371385	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7386000	7391443	Um, things like American Idol, which whether you watch it or not, it's still a very highly rated show.
7391483	7394324	And all those talent shows, you know, The Voice and things, those are still live shows.
7394724	7403708	I think in a way, broadcast TV may experience a bit of a renaissance where it goes back to, in the beginning of television, it was all live stuff.
7403948	7404809	LiveStream Radio
7420849	7425653	I caught all kinds of new music just by listening to Radio 4.
7425693	7427855	VOG Network is the only radio you need.
7430598	7433740	How about all the crap that went down in Texas?
7434741	7439766	We had live streaming going on from the assembly room.
7440495	7444598	We had the freaking internet catch the Texas Assembly breaking the law.
7444978	7445598	Oh, yeah, yeah.
7445918	7446299	Live.
7446799	7450021	You know, I watched the whole... I was like, where's my popcorn?
7450081	7450861	I'm just watching this.
7451382	7460928	But, I mean, news in and of itself, you've got your people who are still going to listen to your biased sources, you know, like your Fox News or your CNN or all of that, you know.
7461528	7472031	But you also have a great deal more people who are looking outside of those sources who are probably getting pretty fed up with having their world events spoon-fed to them and want to actually see what's going on.
7472071	7473371	They're looking to those other sources.
7473912	7477453	Another good catch from our chat room, something that you couldn't get on demand.
7477673	7482194	Jim Sally in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, Sports need to be live.
7482274	7485415	Football and baseball will keep traditional TV around forever.
7485655	7488817	ESPN is going to go to a subscription service.
7488917	7492839	Well, they kind of have subscription services like the NFL Direct and all that and the NHL.
7493139	7494960	That's probably what they're going to go towards.
7496381	7496781	We'll see.
7497322	7498242	You want your ESPN?
7498262	7503045	Well, you have the ESPN streaming service where you pay X amount and you get all the sports you want.
7503445	7508608	You can get so many sports as you start sprouting the colors of your favorite team out of your skin or something.
7510269	7511550	You turn into a buccaneer.
7511690	7516393	All right, we're going to move on from our fugal question of the week, but good answers, you guys.
7516853	7517333	Good answers.
7517653	7522296	All right, let's get back into the news, and I know Loki's been dying to talk about this next story all night long.
7522856	7524037	Of course, I was.
7524637	7533542	And yes, Grand Theft Auto V finally had their big unveil of their online portion of the game.
7533582	7538845	It's actually going to be called Grand Theft Auto Online, and it's all sorts of awesome stuff.
7539366	7543991	What's interesting though is it's actually kind of its own separate thing.
7544251	7553461	It launches October 1st if you buy a copy of Grand Theft Auto V and thankfully they're doing that because it gives me two weeks to play the game before I have to worry about trying to
7554302	7582032	Hogg online but you get to create your own character you earn money in the game and you can customize your character you can buy property in the game you can insure your cars you can buy cars it's so deep as far as the you know the detail in the game they have it where you can play the stock market for example you can invest money in a car company and you go and destroy those cars out in the street and then they have to make more cars and therefore your stock goes up you know kind of stuff like that
7582532	7583093	Deathmatch GTA 5 O'Clock
7602193	7605296	Basically saying, well, first off, it's GTA Online.
7605356	7612462	It's not actually part of Grand Theft Auto V, although it's going to start off with San Andreas, but it will expand beyond that.
7612882	7619868	So they're planning on adding more area other than Los Santos and San Andreas to play in.
7621270	7624212	Also saying that, you know, there's...
7625713	7626774	Voice chat.
7627074	7628354	You can actually talk in the game.
7628574	7635056	Your character will move its mouth matching your dialogue.
7635076	7635757	It will lip sync.
7636157	7639878	And the AI characters in the game will react to the urgency in your voice.
7641119	7641939	So like you said...
7642739	7643740	Get on the fucking floor!
7644020	7645041	They will get on the fucking floor.
7645061	7646121	You know, that type of shit.
7646261	7649344	But if you go get on the floor... Get on the floor!
7649804	7650764	Then they'll start dancing.
7650785	7651485	Yeah, exactly.
7651505	7652806	Or they'll strip.
7654067	7656108	Get on the floor now.
7657449	7660471	Basically, lots of interesting stuff in there.
7660791	7661452	It's a little different.
7661472	7665795	It's not necessarily an MMO because you can play up to 16 players in there at a time.
7666255	7667977	But you can play with other people.
7668177	7670319	So you can play with your friends and stuff like that.
7670459	7672001	You invite random people in there.
7672021	7674563	So it's mediocre, but massive?
7674903	7676565	It's going to be pretty massive, I think.
7676945	7681089	And plus, you know, they're saying that there's also... This is cool.
7681730	7683392	There's sort of like a spectator mode in it.
7683492	7695905	For example, if your friends have a high wanted level or whatever, and they're getting chased down by the police, you can sit back in your apartment and watch on the TV, and it'll show it like a newscast, watching your friends getting chased by the police.
7696265	7697106	That's pretty sweet.
7698027	7701050	So if you get in a white Bronco and drive away, I can watch it on the TV?
7701090	7701711	Yep, you can do that.
7701731	7702572	That's awesome.
7703152	7703352	So...
7705669	7721480	What's also cool, though, is you can jump straight into your multiplayer by... They've got the characters selected on the bottom of the screen that you use your directional pad for, and one of those characters that will unlock in there, there'll be a countdown until it gets to October 1st, is your multiplayer character.
7721500	7723621	So you can actually jump into multiplayer that quickly.
7725442	7725782	I don't know.
7726003	7732427	I think I'm just going to be spending a whole lot of time in this game because I've been looking forward to this since Grand Theft Auto 4 came out.
7732967	7736549	And you've literally said, you know, I don't think I'm getting the new consoles.
7736849	7740731	I'm not getting Final Fantasy XIV because my life will get eaten up by this.
7741132	7742372	Yes, and that's the thing.
7742452	7747515	It's like, I see myself playing a lot more of this than, say, Killzone or something.
7747535	7752178	Yeah, I mean, like, if I get a console, of course I'm going to check out, you know, a game with and stuff, but...
7753888	7754809	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7777701	7781522	Just, you know, I'm probably going to dedicate most of my time to this.
7781622	7783363	And like, even like Call of Duty and stuff.
7783403	7785444	I'm like, you know, Call of Duty is kind of pretty awesome.
7785484	7793207	I may get that just because we don't have anything to play at work because you can't really play online at work because our firewalls shit and we don't have a lot of bandwidth.
7793267	7794268	But, um,
7796820	7801585	If it wasn't for that, if we had access to live and stuff, I probably wouldn't get Call of Duty either.
7801985	7804347	I'm still not sure if I will get Call of Duty.
7804467	7808291	I probably will get Call of Duty.
7808431	7813516	At home, I'm going to be playing mainly Grand Theft Auto V. You know what I was just thinking?
7814417	7819001	With that lip syncing thing, we are going to have a ton of machinima.
7820267	7820687	Bang, bang, bang, bang
7842694	7843134	Grenade!
7843354	7843835	Grenade!
7844595	7845836	Why do you need Kinect for that?
7845996	7847457	Oh, I know, because you have to still Kinect.
7847737	7848898	You have to make a reason for it.
7849658	7849898	Whatever.
7850519	7855321	Alright, well, more Xbox One confirmations and so forth coming out this week.
7855762	7869890	One thing that was coming out from General Manager of Console Development, Leo Del Castillo, in an interview with Gizmodo, said that the Xbox One will automatically detect if it's overheating and will make adjustments to cool itself down.
7870911	7873233	This is, I guess, something that also happens with PCs.
7874093	7879938	They can dial back the power of the box considerably, forcing the system into a low-power state to correct any issues.
7881219	7888245	So the way they designed the box, they don't want to actually intend it to ever have to go to maximum speed under normal environmental conditions, but there is overhead.
7888606	7894631	So we'll allow the fan to go all the way up to its maximum speed, and if that solves the condition without the user having to do anything.
7895211	7907545	My assumption is that is to curb the three light special that affected most 360s because the system was overheating, which granted they corrected later on, which I thought was through a method similar to this.
7907685	7909207	Maybe Loki knows more about that.
7909247	7909647	I don't know.
7910188	7910568	But, um...
7911229	7916738	They had a thing on the... Well, it was when it got really hot that that fan would kick up to 100%.
7917920	7923529	So they did have something like that, but usually at that point it's like, eh, your system's kind of toasty right now.
7923549	7924310	So...
7927529	7927869	I don't know.
7927949	7933173	It's not new, but the whole throttling the voltage down and actually clocking the system down is kind of new.
7935375	7938397	Once again, it just reads as though they're talking.
7938477	7943200	It's like, okay, we've got to tell someone, but let people know that it's not going to red ring.
7943260	7946002	I mean, even though their systems haven't been red ringing since like...
7947063	7947404	DarkSakura
7969528	7970588	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7990928	8000354	And it was originally made for the 70 FPS, which was basically creators making a first-person shooter in seven days.
8001115	8004737	And this one, basically, you have to collect yellow orbs that are dropped by dead zombies.
8005518	8009521	And the only way you get guns and ambos is to kill dead cops.
8009701	8011542	Well, I mean, is to get them from dead cops.
8011922	8016966	And the only way that you get health is to get first aid drops that are left by dead civilians.
8017506	8020388	So they're already dead, so I guess shooting them is okay.
8020949	8025465	However, you get shot at if you open fire on them, so it's really kind of a weird thing.
8025565	8025946	I don't know.
8025986	8026548	Have you heard of this?
8028298	8030839	I just saw that he did a game jam game.
8030859	8033300	It was a FPS game jam game.
8033420	8035220	It was a seven-day, week-long thing.
8035620	8036841	Yeah, it sounded interesting.
8036861	8037741	I haven't played it.
8038381	8039141	It's browser-based.
8039361	8043623	Well, I'm kind of interested because he did it in Unity, and so that's what I'm working with right now.
8043703	8045543	So it would be kind of interesting to check it out.
8045563	8048844	I like the style of his graphics.
8048944	8053986	It is kind of 90s FPS with the pre-rendered hand.
8054106	8056547	Oh, yeah, they're all very...
8058427	8058928	Pixelated?
8058948	8059588	Pixely, yeah.
8059608	8060528	That's pretty sweet.
8061229	8064130	With, you know, shadowed out backgrounds and everything.
8065070	8065871	It's pretty interesting.
8065931	8067392	I just like that the zombies are just green.
8069753	8072714	I'm surprised he didn't go with Minecraft zombies because that would have been even funnier.
8073294	8074895	Yeah, but that would be expected.
8076856	8077276	Still though.
8078997	8080318	I like expected from him.
8080338	8080938	Yeah.
8084383	8087088	Um, so something else regarding Notch.
8087328	8089352	That one game, um, what was it?
8089372	8090795	I don't remember what the hell it was called.
8090875	8091877	Oh, I love that one game.
8091897	8092698	The OX10C.
8092738	8094121	I played it that time with these people.
8095178	8116237	his space game that was supposed to be like kind of a not a sequel to Minecraft but still sandbox-ish and procedurally generated but anyways he has decided to go ahead and stop development on it and basically shelving it and just this is due to kind of a creative block they had with the game and
8116377	8123623	However, he was saying, though, that there are some fans that are actually interested in carrying on into the project.
8124523	8131088	And, you know, basically saying that they're not using any of his old code or his name or anything.
8132149	8140576	That they're going to just kind of, I guess, based on what he had, sort of create a new game.
8140776	8146040	Not really with the story and stuff, but just kind of a new concept with the original idea.
8147719	8175534	I don't know which the original idea did sound kind of neat so I was a little sad to see it go but yeah if he doesn't want to do it it is what it is yeah I mean and that's fine I guess to be inspired by them they're saying they're calling it Project Trillic for now and um no idea what exactly they're going to be doing with it other than they're saying that they're not planning on selling it once it's released but um
8177222	8177502	I don't know.
8177763	8179504	It would be interesting to see.
8179564	8186350	I still didn't really understand what the whole game was about other than I know that you could create your own ship and then you could visit planets and stuff.
8186570	8187992	I don't know.
8188112	8194237	It wasn't Minecraft, but it was some sort of crafting into it and you can program stuff.
8194758	8195098	I don't know.
8195178	8202445	It was just very high concept, but I didn't really understand how it would play, I guess.
8204045	8204666	DarkSakura
8222605	8226688	One of them involved is the legendary Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu.
8227668	8234613	What they're launching on Kickstarter is called Project Phoenix, and it is an indie JRPG that is trying to be developed.
8235093	8239175	The group behind it is Creative Intelligence Arts.
8239255	8246540	It's a Tokyo-based company, and they do also Eminence Symphony Orchestra that does video game and anime arrangement stuff.
8247200	8275616	um Hiroaki Yura will be the director and producer on Project Phoenix whereas Uematsu will score the title uh which it's not strictly Japanese developers because like LA Noire game designer Vaughn Smith is supposed to be a part of it uh but also fantasy novelist Yoko Inoki uh concept artist in Final Fantasy Kiyoshi Arai sound engineer John Kurlander who worked on Lord of the Rings and Elder Scrolls 5 Skyrim so they kind of have this team together but now they just need the money to pay them uh
8275956	8280598	So they say this will be a JRPG with squad-based real-time strategy game design.
8281598	8284459	It's going to be for Windows PC, Mac, and Linux via Steam.
8285619	8294322	And they're hoping to also launch maybe some type of different limited version for iOS and Android, possibly a PlayStation 4 port if the group gets enough funding.
8294743	8296423	Well, they got their funding pretty quick.
8296503	8297143	They wanted $100,000 to do this.
8299204	8302365	with 23 days to go, five times that amount.
8302385	8305306	They have half a million, over half a million in their Kickstarter for this right now.
8305326	8307146	I got lost when they said it was a real-time strategy.
8308347	8310167	A squad-based RTS game, but yeah.
8310547	8311508	That just is not fun.
8311768	8313288	No, Buoy Matsu will do the music.
8313408	8315009	I'll take the soundtrack, but I won't play the game.
8316329	8317989	So let's see some of the stretch goals.
8318089	8321850	Double the amount of character and monster models and Uematsu will do more music.
8321890	8322771	So they've hit that goal.
8324931	8327592	They're going to fight inside the Kraken if they make a million.
8327612	8329172	I don't know what that even means.
8329992	8331032	But all right.
8332453	8334313	Congrats to those guys for getting their funding.
8334333	8335333	I hope the game's great.
8335894	8338034	You got to make a game that Jamie wants to play.
8338694	8341995	Yeah, make it a standard RPG with lots of shooting.
8342934	8365366	going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com DarkTetsuya says hey we're at least guaranteed an epic soundtrack on this that is true a game I mentioned in the first half that I'm going to mention again because it was so horrifically underlooked Lost Odyssey had an amazing soundtrack as well and I believe Uematsu did a lot of the music for that game didn't he?
8368231	8369252	To the Google Cave!
8369272	8370193	I believe he did.
8370293	8373935	I think he did because Mistwalker, he was a part of that, wasn't he?
8374015	8374796	Or I should say is.
8377519	8400824	uh but the music sounds right I'm looking it up real quick yes he did do the music no I don't I just had that moment of geek cred intact I know I had that moment of shit he did do the music right uh all right anyhow uh let's get into this music that means it is time for the mailbag so
8402270	8409513	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place where you can send us emails and DarkSakura will dive into the mailbag and hopefully pull out some letters worth reading.
8409693	8410734	Deleting a spam.
8411114	8412515	Oh God, it's been really bad.
8412915	8416076	I'm going to tell you guys, we will be changing that address soon.
8416416	8421099	Actually, we need to start using Gmail service for our mail rejection.
8421119	8424240	But you have to pay for that now, so... Nah.
8424840	8425741	We'll talk off air.
8425841	8426081	Okay.
8426761	8430043	Anyway, I'll start with a short one.
8430984	8432625	This is from Nark.
8433585	8443811	Since you had such a fun time playing Team Fortress 2, I thought I'd put in a plug for a Team Fortress 2-like game that's still in beta but definitely ready for prime time loadout.
8444632	8446293	Keep up the fun casting, Nark.
8446849	8474440	I've heard of Loadout and we need to do another Epic Team Forgers tonight people ask me like well when do people actually play on the server it's there for you guys to get together talk on Twitter and the forums and so forth and make something happen I myself maybe will be there tonight but I don't want to promise that so probably during the week next week there'll be a night we just need to have a set aside night maybe after Horde House on Wednesday or something
8475939	8476380	Next email?
8476680	8476860	Yep.
8477661	8479684	I downloaded DuckTales on the PSN.
8479764	8483829	It plays fine, but I can't help but think the game probably looks better in the original 8-bit.
8484350	8486893	Since you guys played the original, how does it compare?
8487134	8488816	By the way, I love the animation in the vault.
8488896	8489617	It made me smile.
8489657	8490318	And that's from Robaba.
8491385	8515008	I haven't played the original in a very long time but from what I remember well I think you know I think I think I touched on a lot of this at the top of the show they did change some of the mechanics and there's the new levels and stuff and when you're actually playing the game the gameplay feels pretty good but there's all these cutscenes that were not I mean the original did have cutscenes but they were just they weren't the same
8515208	8516209	The poses are the same.
8516890	8522217	I mean, I thought that the new animation frames really harkened back to the original.
8522237	8523679	I did love the way it looked.
8524059	8525321	Yeah, it's really pretty.
8527392	8531313	You know what warmed my heart in such a lovely way is hearing June Foray.
8532433	8534154	And I didn't mean to rhyme, but it did.
8534554	8537375	No, that was... I love her so much.
8537615	8541176	I hate bagging on the sound because I don't want to make it sound like it's the actor's fault.
8541236	8541776	It is not.
8541816	8549358	And I'm so happy they got back together, but it's just... I really need to hear the console one because it sounded fine on Dan's computer.
8549518	8549978	Well, anyway.
8550918	8551639	It could have been his speakers.
8551659	8551999	I don't know.
8552019	8556140	So I think I got... Rob, if I missed something, shoot us another email.
8556180	8556660	I'll clarify.
8557017	8558618	Now the jungle music is stuck in my head.
8560478	8561319	Why not the moon music?
8561339	8562039	That's the best music.
8562239	8567481	Because the fortune cookie will explain it.
8568142	8569282	The fortune cookie will explain it.
8569482	8569802	Next email.
8571638	8573019	One of my favorite names.
8598809	8602953	First, I cannot help but think about the security breach that unfortunately affected Rob.
8603473	8609499	Yes, Sony had their breach too and when you consider everything that happened between Sony and Microsoft, it's like trying to figure out the lesser of two evils.
8610019	8616626	But Microsoft tried to keep things under the rug and didn't seem like they were taking things seriously, which is utter bullshit.
8617286	8623532	Rob, would you please briefly recap what you went through so I can point people to this episode about the incident?
8624258	8625399	No, go through the archive.
8625479	8625919	No, I'm kidding.
8627020	8632424	So, yeah, even though the Sony service was hacked some time ago, we all know how that went down.
8632825	8635226	I don't know anybody who lost money on the PlayStation.
8635667	8641231	Not that that excuses what happened, because that was horrible, but I didn't actually lose money.
8641611	8650758	But what did happen is that somebody else signed into my account and bought a bunch of stuff, bought those FIFA gold packs and stuff like that.
8650778	8651418	They ran up...
8652279	8654061	I don't even remember how much it was at this point.
8654101	8654822	I want to say it was about $100.
8654942	8660829	No, it wasn't like... It wasn't astronomical, but it was certainly enough where I missed it.
8660849	8661810	It was something recoverable.
8661970	8662170	Yeah.
8662751	8666015	But yeah, they had taken this money and I...
8667316	8668217	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8688889	8702559	Somebody linked my account to one of those, and so I had to call Microsoft, and they took care of it and did what they had to do, but there was a couple days I was out that money, and it was really infuriating, kind of violating.
8702999	8710024	And when that happened to you, the first thing I did was sign up for that EA account thing so that I could... Yes, because I told all the listeners, I said, if you sign up for that, then they can't do it for you.
8710204	8710644	Exactly.
8710845	8712846	So I remember doing that.
8713186	8717850	But lots of people I know, like people who hadn't even touched their Xbox in forever were getting...
8718790	8720111	were hacked like that.
8720631	8739364	And everybody would say, oh, well, Rob, you're stupid and you fell for one of those phishing sites or somewhere and I'm just kind of sitting here going, I'm not going to sit here and say that would never happen to me because I'm not going to be that full of myself that I can't think I might make a mistake once in a while.
8739804	8748190	But I think it says something when people who haven't even used their Xboxes in so long and would have no interest in going to any website online were also having their money taken.
8748730	8753013	and I kind of always... When Microsoft came out and said, oh, everybody's just getting phished.
8753253	8753813	That's the problem.
8753833	8755074	We have a real phishing problem.
8755394	8758056	I'm kind of sitting here going, bullshit, bullshit.
8758876	8760077	And that kind of pissed me off.
8760778	8764480	And have I forgiven them for it?
8765040	8765520	I guess.
8765601	8766541	It's been a long time.
8766601	8767402	Have I forgotten?
8767482	8768262	Hell no.
8769363	8773345	And I try very hard not to save my credit card information or any of that anymore.
8773385	8775767	Well, there's always lessons to be learned from any experience.
8775787	8775927	Mm-hmm.
8779070	8781552	Second, putting free apps behind the gold paywall.
8781972	8786877	I outright refuse to support a service that requires you to pay to use a program freely available elsewhere.
8787357	8793422	No matter what features and perks are available, you should not have to pay and continue paying Microsoft just so you can watch Netflix or Hulu.
8794043	8795404	That's why I have my computer.
8796885	8800506	Lastly, Microsoft has a muddy reputation when it comes to indie developers.
8801066	8809528	In the past, we've had indies like Team Meat and Phil Fish comment on how Microsoft poorly treated them when it came to handling advertising and patches on the Xbox Marketplace.
8809968	8814229	And while the recent change to self-publishing is good, we have retro city rampage creator Provinciano
8817790	8828873	and stating to develop that Microsoft's indie development program is not on par with what other companies offer and there are strings attached with the change to self-publishing.
8830254	8836295	Hearing all this makes me assume that the ones digital only offerings won't be as numerous as the PS4s.
8836775	8837816	That's a nasty canasta.
8839556	8841857	And just checking, no more email.
8842017	8842377	That's it.
8845639	8851683	Sorry, I got distracted with a private message, but there was something else in that email I wanted to reply to, and I read it before the show.
8853084	8854565	Can you recap the last two points?
8854685	8856726	I closed it.
8856926	8863911	One of them was about how poorly they treat the indie developers and how they're strings attached and they're not very user-friendly and not receptive.
8863931	8865692	Oh, thank you.
8867655	8869656	The stuff being behind the gold paywall.
8870016	8871276	Yeah, that's stupid.
8873637	8874637	I don't know what else to say.
8876438	8877618	That is going to make the decision.
8878458	8887401	I would point at the Facebook commenter earlier who said the dad bought the PlayStation 3 just for the Blu-ray and the Netflix Hulu.
8888782	8893403	If they have to buy an extra subscription, you're not going to sell an Xbox One to that individual.
8893903	8905987	So, especially when you can do Netflix online for free, and I mean, granted, yes, you pay the subscription, but I'm talking about the viewer itself is on any Internet Explorer window for free, Microsoft probably shouldn't gate that shit.
8906768	8908488	As far as the indie developers go...
8910769	8912071	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8931031	8933854	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8953451	8982790	so I think Microsoft does realize they done fucked up and they're going in the other direction and I think Microsoft should be giving some credit for that I mean they are giving all these bitchers what they wanted you know at the sacrifice of potentially moving gaming in this new vision or this new direction whether it be right or wrong you know they're going back to what what people what works for people now so I kind of don't want to keep dogging them for doing that but
8983090	9010731	um now it is really going to be about the games and that $100 price difference between the two systems which you never know we could still hear that whole now that connect they may remove it who knows or or take a loss to drop the price if they're that desperate enough I don't know um I kind of don't think that'll happen but here's what I could see them doing um you know it's kind of a helping thing is bundling software with it bundling software or including a year of gold
9012438	9018943	It's just like the Wii U needs to drop their fucking price already and all they have to do is remove the basic set and make the deluxe set the only set and make it the basic price
9032853	9043322	I think what they're planning on doing with the Wii U, I think they're playing it cool right now because they're wanting to see how the new software, these big titles that they have coming out, what the uptick is going to be with that.
9043342	9046284	Because if that does it alone, then they don't need to drop the price.
9046505	9049107	If that doesn't do it, then they may drop the price.
9049307	9052290	I think that's what they're waiting on is to see how it does it.
9052310	9057014	But the longer you wait, the more it's going to suffer.
9057774	9058034	Alright.
9058575	9060897	Anyhow, that's it.
9061477	9063238	I think I've said enough in response to that email.
9063258	9065520	So mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com That's it.
9065580	9066821	If you want to email us in the future.
9068282	9069023	Let's move on.
9069083	9071204	Although we are going to look into changing that this week.
9071224	9072666	So this might be the last week of that.
9072826	9074487	But you can send it there for now and be safe.
9074527	9075688	Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com
9075950	9076391	Don't get crazy.
9108161	9108925	I have an F you.
9109308	9111039	It's to every fucking thing.
9113294	9116036	Well, not everything, but a lot of stuff.
9116336	9119419	I'm still kind of fucked off over that whole job thing.
9120279	9124262	But then again, I don't want to work for bigots, so I'm of two minds.
9125343	9132308	F you to Bubba Gump Shrimp Company, because I had your delicious fish and chips and it murdered me.
9133289	9137012	I was sick for days after that and could eat nothing but almond butter and honey.
9137792	9139774	Which is true, I ate nothing but almond butter and honey for two days.
9140188	9140528	and Grapes.
9141168	9141608	Grapes are good.
9142469	9147570	But just a big pile of fuckery is abounding and I'm getting sick of it.
9149231	9155213	Someone needs to take out the leaf blower thing and blow it out of my life.
9155593	9156273	I'm done.
9157073	9158013	So sick of this shit.
9159694	9159994	Loki?
9160014	9160094	Loki?
9161590	9181829	F you to my work because once again one of our reps left and they're not hiring another person to take that person's spot and so I have a ton more work I have to do and a lot more accounts I have to handle and no additional compensation.
9182329	9183190	Convince them to hire me.
9183686	9184287	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9205868	9206228	People.
9206889	9208350	Because people are invading.
9210372	9212594	My FU of the week goes to drama.
9213334	9214235	I don't want none.
9214555	9219780	And if you try to bring drama into my life, you will not be as big of a part of my life.
9220240	9221922	So keep your drama away from me.
9222602	9223463	Thank you and good night.
9229389	9229729	Alright.
9229990	9230550	Chirp chirp.
9230910	9231371	Chirp chirp.
9232171	9232612	That's it.
9233052	9233392	Loki.
9234273	9236035	Let's talk a little bit more Nintendo.
9236575	9244422	They had a lawsuit that was brought against them for their infringement of a 3D display patent.
9245382	9248325	And this is, of course, with the 3DS.
9249286	9253069	And they have, though, managed to reduce the...
9255631	9259473	and I guess a reduction of what they were going to have to pay.
9259553	9263595	So now it's down to $30.2 million.
9264776	9276622	And they're saying that also possibly maybe even being able to reduce it to even less than that.
9276762	9280964	So I don't know.
9281085	9282926	It sounds like that maybe the evidence...
9286048	9297216	Oh, they were saying that it was, I guess, unsupported by the evidence presented at the trial, so maybe they were having a hard case, saying that they violated rights or not.
9298397	9307544	But either way, though, less money having to be awarded means that they can print more of those $90 copies of Xenoblade Chronicles, so...
9311485	9311625	Yay!
9311645	9311745	Yay!
9331658	9333779	This is what we really want the Oculus Rift for.
9333819	9337140	This is the future right here is porn, porn, porn.
9338420	9340101	So anyway, let's see.
9340561	9351665	3D Heaven is one that's being worked on apparently, which is a detailed full body 3D scans, which would be like, I guess, a nude model that you can just kind of look at.
9352185	9353026	Look at our boobies.
9353486	9355366	Look all around and look at our boobies everywhere.
9356007	9357207	Try to reach out and touch the boobies.
9357347	9361891	That'd be funny, like, they give you, like, depending on how you bend your head and stuff, and stuff like that.
9362191	9366315	Damn!
9366355	9367416	Let's see what else there is here.
9368176	9371079	ThryX Games Chat House 3D.
9371780	9383510	It's real-time chat client software called Chat House 3D, and I guess it's like a voyeur mode or whatever, and you can, I guess, chat with babes, and maybe they'll take their top off?
9383570	9383930	I don't know.
9384050	9384170	I'm...
9385191	9406293	But whatever, it's all in the real vision, the Oculus Rift 3DX Chap is a multiplayer erotic game that is supposed to have Oculus Rift support It's called the first 3D sex game with Oculus Rift support There's also added support for the V-Stroker adult accessory Do you have a V-Stroker, Loki?
9407194	9409276	No, I do not have a V-Stroker.
9409316	9410477	Why don't you Google that?
9410497	9411598	And sadly enough, I know what that is.
9411618	9412298	Is it like a flashlight?
9412699	9413339	Really, what is it?
9413759	9422887	It is like a flashlight thing, but it actually, it's USB powered.
9424308	9426430	It's masturbation for the lazy.
9429992	9430953	Move my hand back for it.
9430973	9432394	That's just too much work.
9433055	9434116	I got a hand cramp.
9434156	9435457	Somebody give me my V-Stroker.
9439740	9440101	Mom!
9440441	9441262	Bee Stroker!
9443845	9444847	Okie dokie!
9445147	9447109	Mommy, I have to have the Bee Stroker!
9448351	9449812	Bye!
9451374	9451955	Shut up, Rob.
9452295	9452836	You're 35.
9452876	9453497	Whatever it is.
9455800	9456921	They don't make them in Canada.
9460024	9464907	Okay, I have to digress in a second because they have something in Canada on the App Store that I wish we had here.
9465087	9465387	Alright.
9465907	9477454	It's where you can be a parking attendant and take pictures of people who park badly, record their license plate number, and then you get whatever their parking violation fee is, you get like up to 40% of it.
9477534	9478354	That's fucking awesome.
9478474	9479335	Oh my god!
9479495	9480295	We need this here!
9480315	9481576	We need this here immediately!
9481636	9482416	I know, right?
9482616	9484257	I posted it on Facebook a while back.
9484437	9486238	Yeah, but there'd be so many complaints.
9486778	9487439	Who cares?
9488512	9493081	it's Murica and I can park bad if I want I'll sue you because you misreported me
9493513	9494634	Yeah, but that's the thing, though.
9494774	9496556	You moved my car when I wasn't looking.
9497236	9499538	And the other thing that Canada has is Canada's Worst Driver.
9499598	9499998	Just saying.
9500759	9501480	That show's awesome.
9501500	9503261	There was an America's Worst Driver, you know.
9503321	9505043	It lasted one season because I fucked it up.
9505183	9508826	Well, do you know who won America's Worst Driver?
9509286	9510867	The guy who started GamerX.
9511228	9511468	Really?
9511588	9511788	Yeah.
9511948	9512449	That's funny.
9513069	9514390	As long as he's not driving.
9514410	9517112	In one of those weird, it's a small world kind of things.
9517633	9521356	But for the record, Canada's Worst Driver is awesome because it's actually educational.
9523955	9525056	I haven't seen either one.
9525176	9526076	Oh my god, it's so good.
9526717	9528758	It's like the only reality show I like.
9529479	9529759	Alright.
9532240	9532821	Let's see.
9534802	9535242	Was that it?
9535342	9536983	Yeah, that's it for the Oculus Rift games.
9537003	9537403	That's enough.
9537463	9539304	We learned what a V-stroker is thanks to this.
9540376	9543157	All right, we are going to go to the Skype line.
9543177	9545859	1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9545899	9549160	The phones are open for business, so give us a call.
9549600	9553502	Meanwhile, I'll get to Twitter topics in a minute here, but I want to check with Loki if there's any last-minute stories.
9554583	9555083	Not really.
9556004	9561286	I thought, honestly, it was kind of a slow week, but let's see.
9562927	9566248	Yeah, there's not a whole lot going on this week.
9568618	9568898	I don't know.
9569579	9573461	We can talk more about Grand Theft Auto V. Hey, you want to talk about Grand Theft Auto V?
9574222	9582927	IQ Games, they've got a new visualizer that's coming to the PS3, so you can get something other than the rotating globe.
9583868	9588431	Alright, you're saved by phone calls on the Skype line, so let's go to the Skype line.
9588451	9591913	1-877-GAME-OLR or his name on Skype is Orange Sounds Radio, but we do have a call.
9592013	9592854	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
9592874	9593194	Who's this?
9594094	9594755	It's Ranma.
9595095	9596216	Hey, Ranma, how you doing?
9597366	9598706	I'm doing good, how about you?
9599247	9603268	I'm enlightened now that I know what a V-Stroker is, what's up?
9604528	9623153	Not too much, I just wanted to say a couple things about last week's podcast I believe it was, because I was kind of on the road at the time Oh right, you're coming back from one of your many conventions Yes, I am such the convention whore You really are, but that's why we love you Are you now immune to all the confunks?
9625177	9625517	No.
9626438	9631760	We'll never be immune to the con-funk, the con-plague, or con-anything.
9632320	9637082	There was a special breed of it, though, that was out around Final Maid 2001 called the Dorbola.
9638423	9639944	People on TBR Freak remember that.
9643625	9645186	What's on your mind regarding last week's show?
9645814	9662436	Well, I just want to say, Rob, I really appreciate what you said about GamerX because a lot of what you said reminds me of some of the conversations I've had with cosplayers, con goers at anime conventions because a lot of what you were talking about you kind of find there because...
9663257	9673544	of similar fans of anime, different genres and so forth, to kind of get together and understand and relate to what it is.
9674425	9676186	They all get together and bash the homestucks.
9679248	9684412	Let's not, because if we're going to go that direction, nobody's getting on the Skype line, so let's not.
9686814	9688195	But anyway, you're right.
9688255	9692858	So kind of having a safe place for like-minded individuals, absolutely.
9693752	9694813	Yep, yep, definitely.
9695473	9698234	So that's kind of, is that the thrill that you get in anime conventions?
9699515	9702757	Part of it, yeah, because, I mean, I ain't gonna lie.
9703277	9708380	Ever since I had this VOG shirt, my desire to cosplay has kind of cut down a lot.
9708500	9718786	I still cosplay mostly for, like, meetups and stuff, but I just like wearing a shirt that has who I'm representing and who I am, and I'm taking pictures and handing out cards, you know, it's like, well...
9719568	9722130	This is where I wanna be, and I'm happy where I am.
9738500	9739962	Rob, no, no, no.
9740522	9744646	You and I are fighting someone with a sewing machine and we're making your damn Joker costume.
9745687	9746347	In two weeks?
9746408	9746768	Good luck.
9746948	9750691	Hey, Evan and I made my Baiken costume in three days.
9751632	9752033	Fair enough.
9752673	9754035	Well, come on, Rob.
9754195	9756457	We can send you a Black Mage costume.
9757818	9758819	I did like that costume.
9758839	9759580	That was a lot of fun.
9760407	9763310	But I do have an idea for a perfect costume for you.
9763790	9770497	You should go to Dragon Con dressed as Jesus with a rainbow sash and just walk around with a glass of water.
9772259	9773380	Wouldn't that be a glass of wine?
9776633	9779276	Rob should be Buddy Christ.
9796998	9809934	I better the the most hilarious thing I thought about doing because I don't here's the thing I don't want to have to keep shaving my fucking beard off for costumes so whatever I dress up as I really want to have a mustache and beard so I thought about maybe doing tingle
9815877	9816337	I don't know.
9816537	9819858	I don't necessarily want pictures of me like that on the internet.
9820259	9821179	Joker's cool.
9821579	9823800	I'll have pictures of me as Joker on the internet.
9824120	9826260	You know what I think you should do if you did the Joker costume?
9826801	9829361	You should do the first Mass Effect uniform.
9829561	9829822	Sure.
9829942	9831342	Because that one I think is a cool one.
9835037	9839280	Brad from PodCulture says that wouldn't bother anyone and Blackwell says my friend cosplayed as Buddy Christ.
9839681	9842923	I underestimate the crowd at DragonCon, clearly.
9842943	9845325	Maybe you should just wear a bathrobe and be the dude.
9845625	9848027	I want to be offended at DragonCon.
9848107	9849508	I really hope cosplay pushes the envelope.
9849548	9850228	I know, I know, I know.
9850669	9855252	We get you leather undies and you can go like Final Fantasy XI outfit.
9855592	9855972	No.
9856593	9857013	No.
9857614	9858074	No.
9858234	9859475	And let me check my iPad.
9859795	9860075	No.
9860095	9860135	No.
9861296	9865620	Well, if we're going the route of leather, we could dress him up as hard gay Razor Ramon.
9866881	9868242	But Rob would have to shave for that.
9869303	9872265	I don't think I like where this conversation is going.
9872325	9876428	So you need to change the topic or get the hell off the phone.
9876528	9877789	We'll find you something good.
9878069	9878370	All right.
9879030	9879430	Okay.
9879490	9879731	All right.
9879771	9880651	We're changing topics.
9880691	9881512	I'm getting out of here.
9881652	9881992	All right.
9882293	9885956	As you haven't heard, I am officially a college graduate.
9886236	9886936	Congratulations.

9981382	9981783	Who's this?
9983584	9984364	It's Jim Sally.
9984384	9985105	Holy shit!
9985165	9986205	Oh my god, it's Jim Sally.
9986245	9987006	It's Jim Sally.
9987066	9988507	Oh my god, it's been forever.
9988587	9989828	Where the hell have you been, young man?
9991459	9992340	I bought a horse farm.
9992520	9993481	I've been cleaning it up.
9993982	9996245	Wait, you bought a horse farm?
9996726	9997827	I bought a horse farm, man.
9997847	10003716	You remember a while ago, last fall, I moved up north, and we were—I'm going to get a better light for you.
10003756	10008342	We had to find a house, and I didn't find a really good house farm or horse farm.
10009096	10009716	So I bought it.
10010037	10011498	It didn't come with any horses, though.
10011518	10012478	I gotta get some next year.
10012839	10015341	But I got stables, I got a barn, I got everything, man.
10015361	10015781	I'm ready to go.
10015801	10018643	I got a little pasture for them to eat their little grass and shit in.
10018683	10019183	It's awesome.
10019283	10025428	Oh my god, so when your daughter gets to that age where she's like, I want a pony, I want a pony, you're gonna be like, alright, let's do it.
10025928	10026889	I gotta get a horse farm.
10027850	10030452	I got one ready on call for her third birthday next year.
10032173	10036396	There's a racetrack like three hours away and they have the retired horses, so instead of just killing off the
10036856	10038017	You know what they do to racehorses.
10038998	10040139	That's where the glue comes from.
10040379	10042140	I'm just going to bring a couple home.
10042621	10043601	There you go.
10043641	10044162	That's great.
10045223	10048165	It's probably cheaper to get to work than gas anyway too, right?
10048405	10048605	Yep.
10048685	10053669	DungeonBuster in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says real life animal crossing for Jim Sally.
10054029	10054290	Yes.
10054550	10058613	Yeah, except your horse won't ask you to deliver a package to the person standing right next to you.
10061135	10062556	Congratulations on the house though.
10062576	10063217	That's awesome.
10064377	10064958	Yeah, it's pretty good.
10064978	10065478	It's pretty big.
10065999	10066379	I love it.
10066721	10068122	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10093939	10094159	Wait.
10094339	10095460	You mean Phantasy Star?
10095980	10096700	Phantasy Star.
10096740	10097501	Phantasy Star.
10097581	10099522	I'm talking about Phantasy Star.
10099542	10100122	Look at my eye.
10100162	10102243	You can tell I'm talking about Phantasy Star.
10103104	10103364	All right.
10103424	10103644	I know.
10103704	10103944	I know.
10103964	10105505	You can tell I don't know Phantasy Star.
10105525	10105725	I know.
10105765	10106586	It's Canada.
10106606	10108407	It's what you do on a horse farm.
10108787	10109047	All right.
10110027	10113049	So Phantasy Star, yes, on Sega.
10113569	10114090	Good memories?
10116991	10117952	Yeah.
10117992	10120913	That was a rough time in my life when I was about 12 years old, 11, 12.
10120973	10121573	My parents split up.
10123117	10125958	And I'd have to go see my dad every two weeks, and it kind of sucked.
10126559	10132442	But every two weeks I went to go see him, I would get to go to the one store in town that rented Sega games, because there was only one store in town that rented them.
10133122	10136504	And sure enough, one day I got there and I found Phantasy Star.
10137044	10139425	It was a four-mega cartridge or something it was called.
10139465	10140766	It was the only one they had, right?
10140786	10141466	It was a big deal.
10141906	10146589	If you get the four-mega cartridge, and I picked up this weirdo Japanese RPG game and
10147233	10149093	I wasn't really into them because I was only 12, right?
10149113	10150134	It wasn't really a cool thing to do.
10150334	10150574	Right.
10150714	10155555	But I brought it home and I played it all weekend and I was like astonished at how awesome it was, man.
10155835	10160196	I got my, spoiler alert, I got my little mirror shield and I shined it in fucking Medusa's face and suck that bitch.
10160556	10161537	She all turned to stone and shit.
10161557	10163237	I was like, this is the fucking greatest game ever.
10163577	10165818	And it was one of the first, no, you remember that shit, man?
10165898	10168438	Odin gets the mirror shield and only Odin can hold it.
10168739	10169499	I remember this shit, man.
10169519	10170779	Trust me, this is a big deal in my life.
10171219	10173300	So listen, I'm telling you right now, Rob, from me to you, okay?
10173460	10173720	Listen.
10174080	10174260	Mm-hmm.
10174761	10181066	It was the first game I had anyway that you could save a game on those old fucking cartridges, right?
10181086	10182627	Those old shitty blowing them cartridges.
10182708	10183848	And you could save it.
10184109	10187251	So I saved my game to the first spot and I put a note.
10187431	10188752	Remember when they used to have game manuals?
10188833	10190474	I put a sticky note on the front of the game manual.
10190885	10191786	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10213217	10214317	Fuck you, Johnny.
10214337	10216838	You're fucked.
10216998	10218159	Oh my god.
10218179	10222200	I put it in, I loaded up game one, and he fucking sold all my armor and shit that I had.
10222240	10225301	He fucking took everything and hid it somewhere in a chest or something.
10225641	10228943	I had three of my characters are dead and just a little fucking cat was alive and shit.
10228983	10230243	What a dick!
10230983	10232724	I'm being serious.
10233204	10235385	I thought Canadians were supposed to be nice.
10235625	10237246	I thought Canadians were supposed to be nice.
10237306	10238326	That guy was a dick.
10239127	10242389	I was video game playing Canadians in 1992, man.
10242409	10244230	Jesus Christ, a lot of assholes up here, man.
10244450	10244710	Fuck.
10245331	10246952	So hey, do you still have a master system?
10247052	10248073	So I spend all weekend.
10248433	10249033	But check this out.
10249053	10250674	This is where the story gets a little bit dirty.
10251194	10251855	Spoiler alert.
10252195	10253036	Spoiler alert.
10253076	10256258	Teenage or young child, preteen, dirtyness coming up here.
10256818	10258659	So I fucking took the game and I was all upset.
10258679	10262622	I fucking played real hard and I brought my characters back and shit.
10263322	10264923	And I fucking left a note in there again.
10265223	10266584	Dude, whoever gets this game next.
10267014	10278871	I save my game to level 1 I only get it every 2 weeks when I visit my dad please don't over save my game 2 weeks later I go back and I get the fucking game and there's a fucking note in there again and I'm like oh here comes the asshole and this time the note said
10279557	10281198	Hi, my name is Christy.
10281598	10283018	My game save is number two.
10283319	10286260	If you ever want to hang out and play together, here's my phone number and my address.
10286280	10289261	And she actually left me her phone number and her address in the fucking game manual.
10289621	10290462	Wow.
10290482	10296424	Can you imagine telling your 12-year-old girl to leave her fucking phone number and address inside of a game nowadays?
10296464	10297625	Can you fucking imagine that shit?
10297645	10298885	But again, this is 1992, right?
10298985	10299185	This is 1992.
10299225	10300926	Did you call the number because I'm thinking 65-year-old man?
10306371	10311195	No, dude, I called a number and it was a fucking 12-year-old girl that lived like maybe five, six blocks.
10311215	10312216	It was far from my house.
10312696	10316019	But we would hang out every two weeks for like maybe six months afterwards.
10316379	10319301	And we would play the game for like, I don't know, an hour or two.
10319642	10320983	And then we would play another game.
10322810	10323811	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10343767	10344428	Yeah, exactly.
10344448	10345188	It got me to first mate.
10345208	10346829	We were only 12, but I kissed her.
10346849	10348030	I would kiss her a little bit.
10348330	10349170	We would snuggle.
10349491	10350531	And then we would play the game.
10350591	10354493	She'd be like, no, you should buy the fangs for the cat.
10354574	10356895	And we don't have to buy the staff for the old man because he's stuck.
10356915	10358696	So I'd be like, Noah's the fucking man.
10358756	10360157	He saved us in the forest.
10360297	10360917	Fuck Noah.
10361678	10363459	Get the jewels for the, get the collar jewels.
10364199	10367861	And we would fucking have these little arguments for like, oh, at least six months.
10368222	10370343	Until the summertime came and then she took off for like, what?
10371819	10373680	We beat the game like three times together, guy.
10373700	10374181	It was awesome.
10374221	10375542	We just kept playing that same game.
10375742	10377863	So that's how it ends?
10378203	10378904	What?
10378944	10379504	That's how it ends?
10379544	10383867	She just disappeared one summer and no fulfilling the fantasy star?
10383907	10386768	We didn't go to the same school in the summertime.
10386788	10390451	I didn't have to see my dad every two weeks in the summertime.
10391091	10392332	And then we just kind of fell off, man.
10392352	10394113	We never really got together because that was grade 8.
10394153	10395554	I think I went into grade 7 or grade 8.
10395594	10395714	It was
10397839	10399141	I was a sophomore in high school.
10415143	10421305	Jim Sally, you still got it.
10421445	10422805	You still got it and you know it.
10423345	10424025	You still got it.
10425226	10437769	Now, I know you're married and you're spoken for and all that, but if you were to find... If you were to find that girl again today, she would throw her panties at you.
10437869	10438529	That's all I'm saying.
10439270	10440070	Oh, you guys are pretty.
10441130	10441630	Look at that.
10441650	10442590	Look at this old car.
10442630	10445391	I restored this old car so we could drive around and it just started our wedding day.
10445411	10449973	This is absolutely terrible radio and I don't care because I'm getting to see pictures of Jim Sally's wife.
10449993	10453193	You can see these pictures on Jim Sally's Facebook at jimsallysfacebook.com.
10453213	10453674	There you go.
10453874	10456274	It's not a real website, you fucking idiots.
10458435	10459075	Jim Sally.
10459115	10460416	Hey, I can make that happen.
10460496	10462676	Jim Sally, I fucking love it when you call.
10463236	10465677	I unfortunately have to let you go so we can wrap up the show.
10466057	10467658	But goddamn, don't be a stranger.
10468198	10469018	Don't be a stranger.
10470595	10472296	No, man, I'll be online a lot more.
10472316	10473397	I got the farm settled now.
10473437	10474377	I'll be online a lot more.
10474397	10474858	I promise.
10475038	10475378	All right.
10475798	10476199	Promise.
10476239	10476839	Pinky swear?
10477760	10479140	Swear on your Phantasy Star save?
10479161	10480621	I can fucking pinky swear on this.
10480802	10481522	Oh, I don't know.
10481882	10483944	I can't really pinky swear on an iPad.
10484884	10485865	I have my pinky up.
10485925	10486645	I have my pinky up.
10487346	10487606	All right.
10487886	10488887	I'm trying to pinky swear.
10489407	10490127	Jim Sally.
10490308	10491348	Okay, I love everybody.
10491648	10491889	All right.
10491909	10494030	We love you too, Jim Sally.
10494130	10495451	Before I go, though, DarkSakura.
10495471	10495571	Yes.
10496198	10498859	Seriously, seriously, tell Dan to let the world see your cleavage.
10498879	10500119	You should never hide your cleavage.
10502559	10505160	The Lord gave you that cleavage for the rest of us to enjoy.
10505360	10507900	I actually am wearing a rather busty shirt today.
10507980	10509381	This was the bike in cleavage.
10510901	10512561	You played Guilty Gear X, right?
10512962	10515422	How come you're not Skype videoing me then with the cleavage?
10515602	10517542	Because we have to give you a reason to call in next week.
10517622	10518783	Alright, Jim Sally, I gotta let you go.
10520751	10521772	Alright, I'm letting you go.
10522192	10522712	Bye.
10523073	10523973	Tits are GTFO.
10524293	10524814	Bye.
10525194	10527495	He lifted his shirt up and showed us his boobies.
10532299	10538983	If you think you can top that call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10540224	10541885	Oh God, I love when he calls in.
10542946	10543766	He needs a show.
10543886	10547749	I need to find the pictures of me in the bike and outfit that I had to duct tape my boobs up.
10549133	10552176	You know what I mean by the duct tape lift that... Yes, oh yes.
10552676	10553437	So, yeah.
10554238	10556760	I knew many girls in Rocky Horror that, you know...
10557219	10557699	You know what?
10557859	10563602	It takes boobs of iron to be able to duct tape directly to the skin.
10564102	10565563	Just saying.
10565603	10566123	That shit hurts.
10566863	10568384	I need to do some Twitter topics.
10568464	10570065	Twitter.com slash OLR.
10570445	10577528	SSJ100Matt tweets us that Tommy Tallarico and the Video Games Live crew have taken a Kickstarter to fund the next Video Games Live album.
10577568	10578668	And yeah, that's on Kickstarter.
10578929	10583110	Video Games Live Level 3 that they're currently trying to fund on Kickstarter.
10583190	10584231	And I'm sure they'll make it.
10584371	10585912	Lots of people love their Video Games Live.
10586892	10606020	TigerClaw sends us a couple of tweets too Warhammer 40k Space Wolf is card based and free to play so if you're interested in that game the good news is that's going to be free to play also he sends us a tweet that a Halo novelist has joined Amazon's game studio I didn't realize Amazon had their own game studio
10609045	10613188	I guess they do, and I know that they're still kicking around the idea of maybe a console.
10615209	10619872	Oh yeah, that's true, because we did have that on the last show, where they might have their own Ouya version or whatever.
10620293	10629059	But yeah, the writer Eric Nyland, who wrote Gears of War 3 and Halo Reach, he's the new director of narrative design for Amazon Games, so they must be planning something.
10629419	10633402	They gotta be planning some juicy exclusive for that Android console, we'll see.
10634723	10640027	Last chance to call 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10640907	10646572	I'm really pressed that I missed Video Games Live when they were here recently, but I just had so much going on.
10648484	10650945	Anyway, I'll give it another minute here.
10650965	10652146	We have no other last minute stories?
10652166	10652746	We covered everything?
10652766	10653226	Not really.
10653387	10654387	Not anything interesting.
10654667	10654907	All right.
10654927	10655668	Well, we're getting to about 930.
10655748	10659890	And I think Jim Sally's call was so good.
10660230	10661191	I saw a Sanrio.
10661431	10661791	Did you?
10661931	10662671	Poking her nose out.
10662691	10663812	She's ready for KTs.
10663832	10664752	That's why she's out there.
10665273	10666033	Meow, meow, meow.
10666113	10666653	Give me something.
10667474	10667734	All right.
10668394	10669635	I guess we'll close up the Skype line then.
10671076	10674557	And we'll go around and get everybody's final thoughts and all that good stuff.
10674878	10677038	Thank you guys for listening to another week of Orange Launch Radio.
10677078	10678739	Thank you for supporting Independent Radio.
10679179	10687483	And, you know, there's a lot of fantastic podcasts out there from very hardworking independent individuals and new ones showing up every week.
10687543	10690684	I just heard of a new one on Twitter today that makes me very excited.
10691765	10694387	So, yeah, just support independent broadcasting.
10694467	10700591	And if you thought this show was awful, I don't know how you made it to the end, but thank you, at least for giving it a fair shot.
10701192	10706015	But if you thought this show was awful, at least try another independent podcast and see if you can find the one that works for you.
10706416	10710699	If you did like Orange Lounge Radio, all we ask, tell a friend or five about the show.
10711019	10712160	Help us spread the word.
10712280	10716143	That's all we got, because we don't have a big budget to advertise this or anything like that.
10716423	10726528	We're going to try at DragonCon, but otherwise we don't have TV ads we can do or magazine ads or whatever, so word of mouth helps a lot.
10727529	10728810	You can always leave us a nice review.
10728830	10733632	We haven't had a nice five-star review on iTunes in like a year, so I would love to see some new ones.
10734152	10734393	Love us.
10734733	10736694	Thumbs up on Stitcher and all that helps too.
10736734	10743417	I know a lot of people are switching to the streaming apps like TuneIn and so forth, so spreading the word and sharing the show there really helps too.
10743597	10744438	Really appreciate it, guys.
10746379	10747160	That's going to do it, though.
10747200	10748741	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
10749001	10750342	DarkSakura, why don't you start us off tonight?
10750523	10753245	If I have to clean up cat puke when I get home, I will be grumpy.
10754846	10759290	My final thought is... Keys!
10762320	10762861	I got nothing.
10763081	10764142	And keys were sitting in front of me.
10764282	10764722	Cents!
10765983	10766183	What?
10766483	10767024	What'd you send me?
10767844	10768064	Cents.
10768124	10768605	Oh, cents.
10769145	10770806	Oh, like dollars and cents.
10771306	10772687	Rob has pennies on his desk.
10772707	10775289	Okay, we are going insane here at the end of the show.
10775409	10776970	Loki, last but not least, your final thought.
10777431	10779872	I'm going to play some more Saints Row this week.
10781333	10782314	And on multiple platforms.
10783455	10783875	Have fun.
10784095	10784435	Good luck.
10784495	10785096	What the hell?
10785516	10786076	Burn a CD.
10787017	10788098	I was like, your computer's possessed.
10788118	10790259	Your laptop is about to take off into space.
10790279	10791180	Can the listeners hear that?
10793329	10804058	I was gonna say that the demon jumped from Rob's toilet into your computer I'm just tired of listening to the same CD over and over in my car so I'm burning a new one I meant to do it earlier but fair enough
10804454	10806355	Alright guys, that's going to do it for tonight.
10806715	10811597	Be sure to be here live next week, Sunday, August 25th, when we do it all over again.
10811657	10815638	Keep in mind, it will be the last show for possibly three weeks.
10816118	10816639	Possibly.
10816659	10818799	We're going to try to avert that best we can.
10819120	10822781	But yeah, be here next week for that show, episode 517.
10823581	10826322	Until then, thank you guys once again for tuning in and supporting our show.
10826722	10827623	You guys are awesome.
10827863	10828703	Have a wonderful week.
10828763	10830964	So that would mean that we're coming back on wit day now?
10831624	10834967	So it wouldn't be the third because that's Labor Day, right?
10836148	10836928	Right when I'm ending the show.
10837208	10839090	We will have no show September 1st.
10839230	10840190	That's Labor Day.
10840671	10841812	Okay, first that's Labor Day.
10842012	10844694	I may be out September 8th, which I'll talk to you about off air.
10844994	10845294	Maybe.
10845734	10847335	That would mean we would come back September 15th.
10847355	10847456	Okay.
10850583	10851704	Yes, we would miss your birthday.
10851964	10853005	No, no, no, no.
10853165	10855386	I'm not worried about that.
10855507	10855887	The 15th.
10857068	10858329	Is that when Grand Theft Auto V is out?
10858889	10862572	It's out on the 17th.
10862632	10866594	By the way, Rob, so next week is our last one before breaks.
10867075	10868376	You know, it happens the week after that.
10868536	10868756	What?
10869176	10870637	It's my 8th year wedding anniversary.
10870938	10871678	Oh my gosh.
10872218	10872959	Happy anniversary.
10873179	10873599	Thank you.
10874460	10875080	My god.
10875921	10877382	When this show started, you weren't married.
10877822	10878083	Right.
10878443	10878523	Ugh.
10879110	10879650	This show's old.
10880071	10881011	But we were cohabiting.
10881031	10882933	We were living in sin.
10883473	10884434	Living in sin's the best.
10884614	10884974	I know, I love it.
10884994	10886976	And on that note, I really am ending it now.
10887036	10889297	Everybody be quiet so I can play the closing song.
