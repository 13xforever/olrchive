7000	13000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	16000	Tonight, August 11th, 2013
16000	19000	Could Valve finally be making a sequel with a 3 in it?
19000	22000	One department store ad teases a Vita price drop
22000	26000	And is Amazon working on a new gaming console?
27000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	33000	Hello everybody out there on the internet
33000	36000	And welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice
36000	38000	It is Orange Lounge Radio
38000	43000	Episode number 515 for this, August 11th, 2013
43000	46000	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here to talk about video games
46000	49000	Gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, gaming lulz, gaming...
49000	51000	Insert whatever here
51000	54000	With my co-hosts, say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers
54000	56000	Hey how you doing?
56000	58000	I'm unemployed again
58000	60000	I'm sorry to hear it, that's...
60000	63000	I feel better about it once the situation became clearer to me
63000	66000	I see, so it was one of those, maybe we are better off seeing other people
66000	70000	Let's just put it this way, I don't want to work for a hypocritical conservative Christian company
70000	73000	That ruins other people's businesses
73000	79000	Well it is important to, you know, work for an employer that you can kind of get behind their values and all that stuff
80000	85000	They had a really good environment there but once I found out a bit more about them
85000	88000	I really started to feel very uncomfortable
88000	92000	I was like, what's that sticker on your car? What's that equal mean?
92000	96000	Oh it's for the human rights campaign, I support gay rights
96000	100000	Oh! Next day, fired
100000	102000	That's pretty much how it went
102000	106000	I'm not laughing at you, I'm just laughing at the awkwardness of that
106000	112000	It was quite awkward, that and also actually requesting the major Jewish holidays off that morning
112000	115000	And they said, oh we made the decision this morning, you're just not a good fit
115000	117000	Oh dear
117000	121000	So I'm not actually openly accusing them of anything, I'm just saying that those are the circumstances
121000	124000	Well you can just work for vognetwork.com full time
124000	126000	You know what, if it paid me I would be really happy
126000	129000	Except, oh yeah, there's that, sorry about that, we don't have a budget
129000	130000	Oopsies
130000	132000	Alright, say hello as well to Techmaster Loki
132000	134000	You there, Loki?
134000	135000	Yeah
135000	137000	What are you doing over there, Loki?
137000	139000	I was pulling up my stories
139000	141000	Oh, I see, trying to get prepared
141000	143000	Now that's a little late, that's alright
143000	145000	How you doing, what's new?
145000	148000	Not much, just, I was watching some
148000	151000	What was it, a...
151000	153000	Mugen fighting thing
153000	155000	Yeah, I think it's coming up later in the show, right?
155000	157000	Yeah, so
157000	158000	Alright
158000	159000	It was pretty funny
159000	161000	A little obsession of yours through the past week or so?
161000	163000	Nah, just the last couple days
163000	164000	Way to kill some time
164000	168000	Yeah, so any big personal news you might want to share with listeners tonight?
168000	170000	Yeah, I guess
170000	174000	So, we're having another child
174000	176000	Congrats
176000	178000	In January
178000	181000	That's amazing, how many weeks along does that make, Nelly?
181000	184000	16, 17
184000	186000	I guessed it on a show this morning
186000	189000	And one of the hosts announced that his wife's expecting
189000	191000	So that's babies everywhere!
191000	192000	Yeah
192000	194000	For the record, I'm not pregnant
194000	197000	Not yet, careful what you wish for
197000	200000	No, I'm gonna time against my biological clock
200000	202000	I'm gonna sabotage that motherfucker
202000	205000	I'm selling my ovaries
205000	208000	How much could you get for those?
208000	209000	Actually about 10 grand each
209000	213000	Alright, in all seriousness, Loki, congratulations to you and Mrs. Loki
213000	214000	Thank you
214000	215000	Good luck with all that
215000	218000	Having another kid, it's gonna be a busy, busy household
218000	219000	Yep
219000	222000	And there are some congrats being shown in our chat room

251000	253000	My first time in Atlanta
253000	255000	So I hope to see some of you guys there
255000	258000	Also joining us on the show tonight
258000	259000	We have a guest here
259000	260000	A frequent guest of the show
260000	263000	It probably helps that, you know, the show's at his house too
263000	265000	Everybody say hello to Alan Alchemy
265000	266000	Hello
266000	267000	How you doing Alan?
267000	268000	I'm great
268000	269000	You're great
269000	270000	I just want to make sure we can hear you tonight
270000	271000	So how have you been lately?
271000	272000	I've been alright
272000	273000	Yeah?
273000	275000	Decided to finally guest on the show again after like a year
275000	276000	Gracing us with your presence
276000	277000	It's appreciated
277000	278000	Alright, what's new with you personally?
278000	279000	Not much
279000	280000	Yeah?
280000	282000	Usually when I'm either working, I work swing shift
282000	284000	So I'll listen to OLR from work
284000	287000	Or when I'm not working and you guys are all here doing the show
287000	289000	I'll kind of just play video games in the office
289000	291000	Or fold laundry or just be domestic
291000	292000	Yeah
292000	294000	So I decided I'd sit in on the show tonight
294000	295000	Okay
295000	297000	Well, I know we're gonna talk about your gaming week a little bit later
297000	300000	But like in general, what kind of games have you been catching up on lately?
300000	305000	Most of the stuff, if it has a Steam trading card thing in it
305000	308000	Then I've checked it out either a little bit
308000	310000	Or you know that trick?
310000	312000	If you don't want to play the game, you can just let it run
312000	316000	And then go take a shower, go watch TV and come back and have your cards drop
316000	319000	So you got sucked into this whole Steam trading card thing too
319000	320000	Yes
320000	321000	Like I did
321000	322000	What's the allure of it?
322000	329000	It's just, it appeals to my sort of OCD completionist
329000	330000	You know
330000	331000	Yeah
332000	335000	And the thing is, is you can earn each badge like five times
335000	338000	So once you earn, once you go like, yeah, I got all the cards
338000	340000	Clarity badge, okay, now do it again
340000	342000	Steam's like, do it again
342000	345000	Spend some, put some money in your wallet, buy the cards
345000	350000	I am eligible for the booster packs for like I think 13 or 14 games
350000	355000	And I still have about maybe 15, 16 more that I still need to play to get the things to drop
355000	357000	Not a single booster pack yet
357000	359000	Yeah, I've not gotten anything either
359000	360000	But then again, I haven't really been playing much
360000	362000	I got my second one yesterday
362000	364000	Yeah, I'm pressed like a panini, I hate you
364000	367000	I have a foil card for Saints Row the Third
367000	369000	Oh nice, you can sell those for a little more money
369000	373000	I forgot who I was talking to but someone needed all three of the only cards that I had
373000	375000	So I'm just like, here take them
375000	377000	Wait, how did you get a foil card if you haven't gotten any booster packs?
377000	379000	I get, it was one of my randoms that guy
379000	380000	Really? Oh, I didn't know that
380000	381000	Those will drop, yeah
381000	383000	Oh, okay, well that's never happened to me
383000	385000	So that's something you have up on me
385000	386000	There you go
386000	387000	There you go
387000	390000	See, the problem is I don't know where to buy and sell those cards
390000	391000	I don't know where that's
391000	392000	It's the community marketplace
392000	393000	Yeah, I have no idea how to get through that
393000	395000	Oh, it's easy, it's, oh, believe me, they make it easy
395000	396000	We can show you
396000	399000	It's really a brilliant thing if you make about it
399000	402000	And it totally plays to people like Alan, and myself admittedly
402000	405000	Who have that OCD need to collect something
405000	406000	Why?
406000	407000	Cause you can
407000	408000	Because
411000	415000	Since we were playing earlier this week I thought I might actually have to get a hat
417000	418000	And so
419000	423000	Well, let's talk about some of the things that, you know, we were off last week because I was away at GamerX
423000	430000	So let's, I want to talk about GamerX, but I want to talk about the other stuff that's gone on in the past couple weeks
430000	433000	One is that, I don't know how it happened
433000	434000	Christopher
434000	437000	Was it Christopher? I guess Christopher did kind of start
437000	438000	Wasn't he doing like a review or something?
438000	441000	Yes, he wanted to review it for Horde House
441000	444000	And to be fair, that was ActDeaf kind of poking at him
444000	448000	Which he's been kind of poking all of us for a while going, hey, play Team Fortress 2
448000	449000	Hey, play Team Fortress 2
449000	453000	And then Phil from Koopa Club I think got in on that a little bit
453000	454000	Hey, play Team Fortress 2
454000	455000	Play it, do it, do it
455000	457000	And finally Extro was like, fine, is it free?
457000	458000	Yes, I'll try it
458000	464000	And so we all played one night on, I guess ActDeaf has this server, abandoned server he knew of
464000	467000	So a bunch of us played on there and loved it
467000	471000	We had so much fun, like it was just so much fun just sitting there blowing people up
471000	474000	And it was great because you don't have to worry that you're not good enough
474000	475000	Or that people are going to yell
475000	479000	It was just a lot of like-minded people having a good time just shooting the shit out of each other
479000	481000	And I was like, oh, I got to get us a server
481000	482000	We need our own server
482000	483000	We need a VoG server for this
483000	485000	We have a Minecraft server sometimes
485000	487000	Why can't we have a Team Fortress 2 server?
487000	488000	As a trial run
488000	489000	Yeah
489000	490000	Test it out
490000	494000	So I remembered I had like $100 sitting in a PayPal account somewhere I hadn't used
494000	495000	So I was like, alright
495000	498000	Oh, just a random $100 sitting aside
498000	500000	All my money
500000	502000	When he pointed it out, I was like, that must be nice
502000	508000	Well, you know what though? It's the modern day equivalent of burying it in your backyard
508000	512000	And I was like, you know you haven't been earning interest on that in a year and a half, it's been stuck in there
513000	517000	Well, you know what? It came in awfully handy this week, didn't it?
517000	519000	So I bought us a Team Fortress 2 server
519000	521000	Actually, the server was only like $20
521000	524000	So I got that, it's like a 12 person server
524000	530000	And all of the information is available on our website, VoGnetwork.com
530000	536000	Look at the forums and you can check out the information that's in the video games forum
536000	538000	All the info you need about the server is there
538000	540000	You might need a little help with the password
540000	545000	But let me just remind you guys, we used to have a little mascot, a little ferret on the show
545000	548000	That's on my bedside table sitting on Duffy's head
548000	550000	Yes, DarkSakura abducted it
550000	552000	It doesn't work anymore
552000	555000	And no, I do not have the hero's cap, I need it
555000	558000	Just in case you need that information when you look at the post
558000	561000	And it is password protected, but if you ever check it out
561000	566000	Like in your Steam client, you see a bunch of jerks on there with screen names that you don't recognize
566000	569000	You should let Rob know and he can spin the password to something else
569000	574000	Absolutely, because we want it to be the welcoming environment for people that are like
574000	579000	I want to play Team Fortress 2, but I don't know anybody and I'm not very good at shooters
579000	582000	No one is really good at Team Fortress 2
582000	586000	It's too fast, it makes me feel old because I was the soldier class with the shotgun
586000	589000	And I was in the same room with someone, strafing
589000	591000	I couldn't hit someone with the shotgun
591000	594000	And they killed me, I was like, I have a shotgun in your face, I can't hit you
594000	598000	I feel a little silly that I'm just now getting into this game that's like, what, five years old?
598000	599000	It came out with Orange Box, right?
599000	604000	I think I played it a little bit on Orange Box on 360, but it's not even the same like now on PC
604000	606000	It just feels so different
608000	611000	I should probably play that, but I've had other things on my plate
611000	613000	You also might get your little sicky-sick
613000	616000	I feel like it plays most like OG Quake to me
616000	618000	Although it's more cartoony
618000	620000	Which, duh, it makes sense
620000	622000	I mean, Team Fortress 1 was a Quake mod
622000	624000	The speed of it reminds me of Unreal Tournament
624000	625000	Which I loved
625000	627000	Oh yeah, that's true
627000	629000	Definitely some more games throughout the week
629000	632000	Alan and I would love to play tonight, but we have errands to run after the show
632000	635000	But that might not stop other people from playing after the show
635000	639000	Active in our chatroom says Team Fortress 2 is around seven years old
639000	642000	Oh my gosh, really? Holy moly
642000	645000	Alright, speaking of other games and things
645000	648000	Dark Soccer, well, I guess it's bugging out right now
648000	651000	But you were trying to open your Animal Crossing town for the first time
651000	653000	I had three people in there and the connection crashed
653000	655000	So I'm gonna open it one more time, but if it does it again
655000	657000	I'm gonna have to leave it closed for the rest of the show
657000	660000	Because our primary concern is keeping our bandwidth open
660000	662000	Yeah, it is, that is, so we don't want to
662000	664000	But it would be fun if you want to go visit Jamie
664000	666000	You got the VOG pattern, right?
666000	669000	I did, but it won't let me put it on, so I think I just have to recreate it
669000	671000	Well, Bobby's pattern's probably better anyway, so
671000	673000	Go get the one from his town
673000	676000	But no, I actually can't use something that I got from somebody else
676000	678000	I'll have to make it myself
678000	679000	Dope
679000	680000	It's fine
680000	682000	Alright, so there's that Animal Crossing going on
682000	684000	And then Minecraft coming back at some point, right Loki?
684000	686000	Yeah, I want to get around to it
686000	689000	Alright, so we want to know what other games should VOG have a server for?
689000	692000	We'll look into it if you have a serious request
692000	694000	Something that we ought to check out, let us know
694000	696000	Free to play is really good too
696000	698000	That's what makes Team Fortress 2 so great
698000	700000	Because it's free to play
700000	702000	And people even make a little money off it, right?
702000	704000	Getting the item drops and crafting and all that
704000	706000	I mean, not anything to write home about
706000	708000	But, you know, something to buy trading cards with, right?
709000	713000	Alright, so we missed the show last week
713000	716000	Because I was at GamerX
716000	718000	And Alan was there with me
718000	719000	Yay
719000	721000	Which was great
721000	723000	And if you haven't heard about GamerX
723000	725000	Although I'm pretty sure I've talked about it ad nauseam on the show
725000	728000	GamerX was a Kickstarter backed convention
728000	734000	To really just be a safe place for GLBT gamers
734000	736000	But it's really important to know
736000	739000	The con was not only for GLBT gamers
739000	741000	And I think I went on this tangent
741000	743000	It might have been on Horde House
743000	745000	But it always pissed me off when I heard people going
745000	747000	Well, where's our straight gamer convention?
747000	749000	Why can't we have a straight gaming convention?
749000	751000	And I'm like, well, okay
751000	753000	That's what YowieCon is for girls
753000	756000	When y'all are getting disowned by your parents
756000	760000	And getting lost past in states that affect your lifestyle
760000	762000	And people are bullying you
762000	764000	And calling you names on Xbox Live
765000	767000	Then you can have your little convention
767000	770000	But otherwise it's a 365 day a year convention
770000	772000	The point was not to be like
772000	774000	Gaze only and everybody else get out
774000	776000	It was to be a safe environment
776000	779000	Just like I described the Team Fortress 2 server
779000	781000	Is a safe environment for people
781000	783000	Who are bad at Team Fortress 2
783000	785000	It's creating a safe place
785000	787000	Where people are not gonna be screaming
787000	790000	FAG FAG N-word N-word
790000	792000	It's like, bro
792000	794000	When you play Halo and you have to turn off
794000	796000	Everyone else's mics because you get sick and tired
796000	798000	Of being called a breeder a hundred times a match
798000	800000	Then come talk to us
800000	802000	We'll talk about a straight convention
802000	804000	I don't think that's happening
804000	808000	The bullying is bad enough with gay, lesbian, and bisexual
808000	811000	And then throw transgender into it
811000	815000	It was very eye-opening in some of those panels
815000	818000	To hear what transgendered people go through
818000	820000	In games and so forth
820000	822000	It was really eye-opening
822000	824000	I had a marvelous time at the convention
824000	828000	It was honestly something I kind of never thought I would see
828000	830000	So it made me just very happy to be there
830000	832000	I did have some small reservations
832000	834000	It was a first-time con
834000	836000	And so there were some first-time con issues
836000	838000	But I want to just make sure I am crystal clear
838000	841000	It was really good for a first-year con
841000	842000	Beyond really good
842000	844000	My minor issues were
844000	846000	One, the space was too damn small
846000	848000	Although the Hotel Kabuki in San Francisco is lovely
848000	850000	And I loved that it was in Japantown
850000	852000	So all that stuff was nearby
852000	856000	It was just a clusterfuck of people downstairs
856000	859000	I actually had a panic attack from claustrophobia
859000	861000	That has never happened in my life
861000	865000	But because the lines were spiraling around
865000	867000	And there were a few exits
867000	869000	You were in a basement
869000	871000	I just suddenly pictured
871000	873000	What happens if this place gets caught on fire?
873000	875000	And I literally had the whole high blood pressure
875000	876000	And all that stuff
876000	877000	I had to get out of there
877000	879000	So thankfully I did
879000	881000	Once you could make it into a room
881000	883000	Whether it was the exposition room
883000	884000	Or the gaming room
884000	885000	Or a panel room
885000	886000	You were fine
886000	888000	But the people waiting in line
888000	890000	Plus the through traffic
890000	892000	Because people got to get from point A to point B
892000	894000	They don't give a shit about a panel
894000	896000	Waiting in line if they're not interested in the panel
896000	898000	And the hallways for that
898000	900000	Were only maybe two or three people wide
900000	902000	And the ceilings were really low
902000	903000	Like only 10 or 11 feet
903000	906000	So it was really just claustrophobic and gloomy
907000	908000	Which you know what?
908000	910000	I'm sure when they looked at the space originally
910000	912000	And kind of had their thought
912000	914000	What it was going to be in their head
914000	916000	What a terrible problem to have
916000	918000	That your con is too popular
918000	919000	So next year
919000	921000	They have said it's coming back next year
921000	922000	And I'm pretty sure they said
922000	924000	They are looking into a bigger space
924000	925000	Although I don't know if that necessarily meant
925000	927000	They were looking at a different space
927000	929000	I kind of got the feeling that they might just spread it out more
929000	930000	I don't know
930000	931000	We'll see
931000	934000	The Hotel Kabuki has hosted different cons before
934000	936000	And what they count on I think
936000	939000	Is that a lot of that traffic is going to start going into the Kintetsu Mall
939000	941000	To go shopping at Kinokuniya
941000	943000	Or go get crepes or whatever
943000	945000	Maybe they'll spread it out across different hotels
945000	947000	And Japan Video really likes it
947000	949000	Because they do a lot of business during that
949000	950000	Oh yeah
950000	951000	It was great
951000	952000	The environment was great
952000	954000	The Japanese street fair was going on
954000	956000	The overflow for the con
956000	958000	Was always in that mall
958000	960000	So yeah it was already kind of a part of the circuit
960000	963000	So my other bit of creative feedback
963000	966000	Would be that Alan and I went to the Friday night party
966000	969000	Which was for the VIP Kickstarter folks
969000	971000	Because yeah I did kickstart a bit of money into this
971000	973000	Because I really wanted to see it happen
973000	975000	So we went to the Friday VIP party
975000	976000	Which was fine
976000	977000	Music talent was great
977000	978000	Let's say that
978000	979000	Music talent was great
979000	981000	I know some of VX JasonXV's friends were
981000	983000	They had a Chiptunes DJ
983000	984000	That sounds cool
984000	986000	Yeah they were really good
986000	988000	But the host of the evening was Pandora Box
988000	990000	And she was a contestant on RuPaul's Drag Race
990000	992000	Full disclosure I loved her
992000	994000	Rooted for her all through that season
994000	995000	Ditto
995000	996000	And I've even
996000	998000	On the fun little side project
998000	1000000	RuPaul's Drag Race podcast I did with the Game Buoy guys
1000000	1002000	I even defended her many times
1002000	1004000	And I do love her and follow her on Facebook
1004000	1007000	But maybe Alan you can describe this better than I can
1007000	1009000	What the issue was with Pandora
1009000	1013000	Well you know it's supposed to be an inclusive convention
1013000	1016000	A lot of people had aired concerns online
1016000	1019000	That it was just going to be a bunch of white gay dudes
1019000	1021000	Because that's what San Francisco is really
1021000	1025000	And we were going to shut out the BLT portion of the convention
1025000	1027000	So she gets up there
1027000	1029000	And within like a minute she's talking about
1029000	1031000	There are lesbians play video games?
1031000	1033000	Ew I don't like vagina
1033000	1034000	And everyone's laughing
1034000	1036000	Once I was born and fell out of one I was done
1036000	1039000	And it's like okay gay men don't like pussy
1039000	1041000	That's your joke
1041000	1043000	Which is like really insulting
1043000	1046000	I hate when I hear my peers say it
1046000	1047000	It's like really?
1048000	1050000	Yeah and then she was kind of going after the nerd thing too
1050000	1052000	Like oh yay we're having this convention
1052000	1054000	You guys can get out of your basement for the first time in a year
1054000	1056000	And I'm just kind of like
1056000	1058000	I don't know I'm torn because I understand
1058000	1060000	I understand drag queens are supposed to be bitchy
1060000	1062000	Like that's their whole thing
1062000	1064000	You know so I should just like kind of roll my eyes and do whatever
1064000	1066000	It's like a big roast
1066000	1069000	Haha nerds in basement that's the first time I've ever heard that joke
1069000	1071000	Exactly yeah that's totally original
1071000	1072000	I was just kind of like
1072000	1074000	Dude you are like the first thing
1074000	1076000	At the first con
1076000	1078000	Of this first great thing
1078000	1080000	And that's what you're going to do with it?
1080000	1082000	And everyone in that room had donated
1082000	1084000	I'm sorry it was 100 bucks right?
1084000	1086000	Yeah something like that
1086000	1088000	So I was just a little bit like
1088000	1090000	And then she started talking about Grindr
1090000	1092000	Nerds are introverts here all on Grindr right now
1092000	1094000	And it's like they'd probably be on Grindr anyway
1094000	1096000	Haha you're on Grindr bitch
1096000	1098000	Haha
1098000	1100000	So I don't know I just was kind of
1100000	1102000	I was over her
1102000	1104000	It wasn't the best
1104000	1106000	I wasn't a fan of her I didn't like go home and unfollow her on Facebook
1106000	1108000	Or something I was so mad
1108000	1110000	But I was just like that was a little lazy
1110000	1112000	Her cosplay was good
1112000	1114000	That I'm sure her team put together for her
1114000	1116000	She didn't know what the fuck she was wearing
1116000	1118000	Shade
1118000	1120000	Well alright enough negative
1120000	1122000	Because honestly lots of positive
1122000	1124000	You know I was just in my basement in Animal Crossing
1124000	1126000	Haha we did a panel there
1126000	1128000	Podcast Cross Zone and had a lot of fun
1128000	1130000	And I just want to give a shout out
1130000	1132000	And big hearts to the guys
1132000	1134000	From Koopa Club
1134000	1136000	From Game Bar
1136000	1138000	From GameBui.org
1138000	1140000	Which I'm sure everybody was reciting that URL
1140000	1142000	At the end of the day after that panel
1142000	1144000	To Fox Van Allen from Wow Insider
1144000	1146000	And the Techlicious
1146000	1148000	Is that the one he writes for? I look really stupid right now
1148000	1150000	I forget which one he writes for but
1150000	1152000	He was a great moderator
1152000	1154000	And the other folks that came
1154000	1156000	To the panel
1156000	1158000	I was really worried no one was going to show up y'all
1158000	1160000	And we had a relatively full room
1160000	1162000	A few MTC's but not a lot
1162000	1164000	And had a great time
1164000	1166000	And I was telling jokes, people were laughing
1166000	1168000	We were having fun with it
1168000	1170000	And yes that panel should be up soon
1170000	1172000	Koopa Club is going to put it on their feed
1172000	1174000	So I'll let y'all know when it's up
1174000	1176000	And because it was the last panel scheduled for that room
1176000	1178000	We got, or you guys rather, got to run long
1178000	1180000	So that was good
1180000	1182000	Yeah that was good
1182000	1184000	And we had a great time
1184000	1186000	That was really the highlight for me
1186000	1188000	Getting to do what I love to do
1188000	1190000	You know, I want to go next year
1190000	1192000	Oh yeah
1192000	1194000	Because I was actually trying to think of
1194000	1196000	Next year is my 20 year high school reunion
1196000	1198000	Oh my gosh
1198000	1200000	Shoot me in the face already
1200000	1202000	But I want to do one con next year
1202000	1204000	Assuming I don't move to Washington
1204000	1208000	So I was actually thinking of making that my con next year
1208000	1210000	Although I have another friend
1210000	1212000	That's definitely trying to get me back to Fonamy
1212000	1214000	For Homestuck cosplay
1214000	1216000	Oh geez
1216000	1218000	You know what, I wasn't gonna do it at all
1218000	1220000	Until she's like, we need to do this
1220000	1222000	And it's better when you have two people
1222000	1224000	I was like, fine, I'll make a costume
1224000	1226000	I was actually gonna suggest GamerX look into the
1226000	1228000	San Jose Convention Center, I mean yes
1228000	1230000	I know that's not the heart of San Francisco
1230000	1232000	But San Jose is still the Bay Area
1232000	1234000	It's easy to get to
1234000	1236000	They need to check the one that YowieCon is at
1236000	1238000	Which is right outside Burlingame
1238000	1240000	Where I
1240000	1242000	Right by the airport, right?
1242000	1244000	Yeah, and it was a really good venue for the convention
1244000	1246000	YowieCon is still relatively small
1246000	1248000	And it was perfectly accommodating
1248000	1250000	To everything, especially having
1250000	1252000	Electronic glass toys in
1252000	1254000	The dealer's room
1254000	1256000	And then they had JunkieSpot there
1256000	1258000	So I think that, you know, they need to
1258000	1260000	Did they have a dealer's room?
1260000	1262000	Yes, it was small, like everything for first year con
1262000	1264000	It was very small, and some tables
1264000	1266000	I'd like to talk to the organizer actually
1266000	1268000	He's a pretty approachable guy
1268000	1270000	So if you can give me that information
1270000	1272000	Wink wink, nudge nudge
1273000	1275000	Yeah, I'd definitely be going next year
1275000	1277000	I had a good time
1277000	1279000	Yeah, we didn't do Sunday
1279000	1281000	Because we ended up taking a bunch of people
1281000	1283000	Up to our friend's place above the Castro
1283000	1285000	And drinking until 3 AM
1285000	1287000	And we got trashed
1287000	1289000	That was the best thing we did
1289000	1291000	But it was just great to have everybody in one place
1291000	1293000	It's like, who drank all this tequila?
1293000	1295000	You did, it's 3 AM
1295000	1297000	Oh shit, so yeah
1297000	1299000	Jonko from Koopa Club and I were doing shots of Fireball
1299000	1301000	And you guys know how I am after one drink
1301000	1303000	I think I had like four shots of Fireball
1303000	1305000	But being in an enclosed space with all those people
1305000	1307000	Plus the alcohol lowering your immune system
1307000	1309000	Con crud
1309000	1311000	Yeah, and exhaustion
1311000	1313000	Don't forget that, that's a big one after Clue two weeks ago
1313000	1315000	Con crud hit Rob hard
1315000	1317000	I have been sick since
1317000	1319000	Somehow I didn't really come down with it
1319000	1321000	Until Tuesday
1321000	1323000	I was really sick, I'm still getting over it
1323000	1325000	Like you might be able to hear it in my voice
1325000	1327000	Yeah, I've been sick since Tuesday
1327000	1329000	If you listen to Hoard House on Wednesday
1329000	1331000	I'm really out of it
1331000	1333000	Yeah, I'm still trying to recover from that
1333000	1335000	Not fun, but I better not get that
1335000	1337000	When I go to Dragon Con
1337000	1339000	You remember my advice
1339000	1341000	And do not drink soda at a con
1341000	1343000	Drink nothing but tea
1343000	1345000	SSJ 100 Matt in our chat room says
1345000	1347000	On a scale of one to grandpa, how drunk was everyone?
1347000	1349000	Every single person
1349000	1351000	Was drinking except for
1351000	1353000	Xtaphir, I believe
1353000	1355000	From what you're describing, on a scale of one to grandpa
1355000	1357000	You were on girl
1357000	1359000	The slag kick was driving
1359000	1361000	So he didn't drink anything
1361000	1363000	Oh yeah, that's right, he didn't drink either
1363000	1365000	And Brad from Pod Culture in our chat room
1365000	1367000	At live.vognetwork.com is saying
1367000	1369000	Yay, Fireball, and more Fireball is coming to Dragon Con
1373000	1375000	Here we go
1375000	1377000	There is something I'm making, Rob, that you should try
1377000	1379000	If you like the Fireball
1379000	1381000	I'm making ginger rum
1381000	1383000	With actual ginger and actual cinnamon
1383000	1385000	I wish it could come to Dragon Con
1385000	1387000	Well, you know what, if someone's got money
1387000	1389000	I actually do have places to stay
1389000	1391000	If you are
1391000	1393000	If you are going to be in Atlanta
1393000	1395000	Join us at Dragon Con
1395000	1397000	I don't know if we have the final details on the panel yet
1397000	1399000	But I'm sure Bobby will be spreading that all over the internet
1399000	1401000	As soon as we know
1401000	1403000	I think it's tentatively Sunday night
1403000	1405000	Around the time that OLR would usually be
1405000	1407000	Which does mean we are not going to have a show again
1407000	1409000	Labor Day weekend
1409000	1411000	I apologize because that's two shows in about a month's span
1411000	1413000	That we're going to be missing
1413000	1415000	Enough, got to do it
1415000	1417000	So, it's Labor Day weekend
1417000	1419000	I think a lot of you guys will be doing various things
1419000	1421000	Conventions of your own and so forth
1421000	1423000	Any last words on GamerX, Alan, before we get into our gaming weeks?
1423000	1425000	Nothing, that was it
1425000	1427000	Okay, Loki, do you have something to say?
1427000	1429000	Labor Day weekend, Saints Row IV
1429000	1431000	All day and all night
1431000	1433000	Alright, let's talk about our gaming weeks
1433000	1435000	The types of video games that you've been playing this week
1435000	1437000	I actually think we'll let Alan start tonight, our guest
1437000	1439000	Alan, how's your gaming week?
1439000	1441000	So we're going to spend an hour on this segment
1441000	1443000	I've been playing everything
1443000	1445000	Speed it up
1445000	1447000	Really quickly, back in March and April
1447000	1449000	I was trying to play Dead Space 1
1449000	1451000	Because of the hype around Dead Space 3
1451000	1453000	It was too scary, I chickened out, I haven't touched it since then
1453000	1455000	Necromorphs are terrifying
1455000	1457000	And it's claustrophobic and it was very scary
1457000	1459000	I also played and beat GTA IV
1459000	1461000	The main game with Niko
1461000	1463000	Twice, I beat it
1463000	1465000	And then I ran through and beat it again
1465000	1467000	I haven't done the expansions yet
1467000	1469000	More recently, because of the Steam Trading Card stuff
1469000	1471000	I've played
1471000	1473000	McPixel
1473000	1475000	McPixel's awesome
1475000	1477000	I burnt out on it kind of fast
1477000	1479000	Because I was trying to get 100% on everything
1479000	1481000	Where you have to find all the jokes
1481000	1483000	All of the things that you can click wrong
1483000	1485000	Basically, there's a bomb
1485000	1487000	It's just one screen, one room
1487000	1489000	There's a bomb somewhere
1489000	1491000	You have 20 seconds to click stuff to figure out how to defuse the bomb
1491000	1493000	It's kind of like WarioWare
1493000	1495000	It's very quick-paced
1495000	1497000	Once you fail, you move on to the next one
1497000	1499000	And it's just trial and error
1499000	1501000	So yeah, that was a lot of fun
1501000	1503000	It's really neat
1503000	1505000	I got 100% on the first couple stages
1505000	1507000	And then burnt out on it
1507000	1509000	I played
1509000	1511000	Revenge of the Titans
1511000	1513000	Which is a tower defense game
1513000	1515000	Which I played for the Steam Trading Cards
1515000	1517000	I don't like tower defense
1517000	1519000	So once I saw that's what it was
1519000	1521000	I was like, okay, I'm not playing this
1521000	1523000	Past the hour and a half it's going to take me to get
1523000	1525000	My little Steam goodies
1525000	1529000	The longest time I've ever played a tower defense game
1529000	1531000	Is Plants vs. Zombies
1531000	1533000	Which is a great game, but I just don't care
1533000	1535000	It's kind of like Bobby with first person shooters
1535000	1537000	I understand the strategy behind them
1537000	1539000	I just don't care
1541000	1543000	And then the game that I really want to talk about
1543000	1545000	Is Hotline Miami
1545000	1547000	Which is phenomenal and I'm really kind of irritated
1547000	1549000	That I haven't played it since
1549000	1551000	It came out in October and I'm just now discovering it
1551000	1553000	I got it, I haven't played it yet
1553000	1555000	It's sitting in my library
1555000	1557000	And I don't have it installed
1557000	1559000	Oh, I do have it installed, sweet
1559000	1561000	But I haven't played it
1561000	1563000	The music is phenomenal
1563000	1565000	The creators of the game were inspired by that movie
1565000	1567000	Drive with Ryan Gosling
1567000	1569000	Awesome
1569000	1571000	Which is kind of like a noir, neon
1571000	1573000	New 80s feel to it
1575000	1577000	And I think they even thank the director of that movie
1577000	1579000	In the credits
1579000	1581000	It's ultra violent
1581000	1583000	I'm not too great about it
1583000	1585000	Aside from the flawless soundtrack
1585000	1587000	Drive was scored by Kravinsky
1587000	1589000	Who is this French electro producer
1589000	1591000	They have a bunch of similar artists
1591000	1593000	Doing the soundtrack
1593000	1595000	With a completely Polish name
1595000	1597000	So yeah, the soundtrack
1597000	1599000	Look it up on YouTube, it's phenomenal
1599000	1601000	I think we're going to play two of the songs
1601000	1603000	From Hotline Miami during the break
1603000	1605000	Yes, but that would only be for the live listeners
1605000	1607000	Also to say though, if people do want to see
1607000	1609000	The game in action, Classic Game Room reviewed it
1609000	1611000	Not too long ago
1611000	1613000	And he does a really good review
1613000	1615000	It shows plenty of the gameplay
1615000	1617000	If I have time tonight, maybe I should do some live stream
1617000	1619000	Because I haven't played it yet at all
1619000	1621000	So that might be a fun one
1621000	1623000	It's a fast game
1623000	1625000	It's also very hard
1625000	1627000	It took me a while to figure out the learning curve
1627000	1629000	What the hell you're supposed to do
1629000	1631000	What's in chat
1631000	1633000	I'm laughing because Fifth Dream in our chatroom
1633000	1635000	says, oh look, I have Hotline Miami in Steam
1635000	1637000	Who knew?
1637000	1639000	I've done that
1639000	1641000	If you bought Humble Bundle 8, you got it
1643000	1645000	And one great thing about it
1645000	1647000	It is ultra-violent
1647000	1649000	But even just the title screen
1649000	1651000	And the music that plays
1651000	1653000	There is something disturbing
1653000	1655000	And really eerie about that game
1655000	1657000	That they nailed
1657000	1659000	There's a part halfway through the game
1659000	1661000	Where the player character starts to hallucinate
1661000	1663000	And you start seeing dead people at the 7-Eleven
1663000	1665000	Or in his apartment that aren't really there
1665000	1667000	There's a song that plays in your apartment
1667000	1669000	At the start of each mission
1669000	1671000	I'm uncomfortable playing this
1671000	1673000	And it's not because of the violence
1673000	1675000	Which does get a little out of control at times
1675000	1677000	But the creators for such a
1677000	1679000	It looks like a Super NES game
1679000	1681000	Basically
1681000	1683000	Really captured
1683000	1685000	It's a very unsettling game
1685000	1687000	And it's really amazing in that sense
1687000	1689000	And I think that's
1689000	1691000	I played some Team Fortress 2
1691000	1693000	With the gang
1693000	1695000	And no Mass Effect 2 or 3
1695000	1697000	I kind of burn out on that
1697000	1699000	Not for good
1699000	1701000	But I have my third and fourth Shepherd
1701000	1703000	And I'm like, I'll finish their careers later
1703000	1705000	Torchlight 2, I've been playing a lot of that
1705000	1707000	You enjoying Torchlight 2?
1707000	1709000	I've hit a plateau
1709000	1711000	Where I'm on an overworld map
1711000	1713000	That I keep dying on
1713000	1715000	Like I just get steamrolled
1715000	1717000	Because I'm playing it on veteran
1717000	1719000	Which is kind of like the hard mode
1719000	1721000	Not elite or super insane
1721000	1723000	I was doing fine, I kept quaffing my health potions
1723000	1725000	I was keeping up, but this one map
1725000	1727000	Trying to get to the other side of it
1727000	1729000	Where the quest marker is, I just get destroyed
1729000	1731000	So I need to
1731000	1733000	There's no way to grind really, because monsters don't respawn
1733000	1735000	I'm going to have to do some co-op sometime
1735000	1737000	It'll be fun
1737000	1739000	Alright, well if that's it for your gaming week
1739000	1741000	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
1741000	1743000	Totally not playing Animal Crossing
1743000	1745000	Right this second, right?
1745000	1747000	Screw that game, no I'm kidding
1747000	1749000	I'm totally playing Animal Crossing right now
1749000	1751000	Yeah, Misty's in there, Deft is in there
1751000	1753000	We did have Fifth Dream earlier
1753000	1755000	I don't know if Fifth Dream returned
1755000	1757000	Look out for Misty, she'll hit you with a bug now
1757000	1759000	When you're not looking
1759000	1761000	Well I told everyone they can have my pears
1761000	1763000	It just saved me some perfect pears
1763000	1765000	But yeah, playing Animal Crossing
1765000	1767000	You know
1767000	1769000	I am actually back to Mass Effect 3
1769000	1771000	Because I am taking my modding practice
1771000	1773000	Another step further
1773000	1775000	Someone put out a hair mod
1775000	1777000	Where you can use Brooks' hair
1777000	1779000	Instead of Allers, which actually makes Allers look decent
1779000	1781000	But
1781000	1783000	There's another
1783000	1785000	Hair mesh out there
1785000	1787000	That I actually finally got
1787000	1789000	To replace the standard Chacwas hair with this one
1789000	1791000	But I can't get it to run without
1791000	1793000	Crashing my game because I need to get the
1793000	1795000	Right texture for the hair working
1795000	1797000	Even though I think the cute texture would actually
1797000	1799000	Work just fine with it, but I'm thinking out loud
1799000	1801000	So yeah, I'm still playing with it
1801000	1803000	But I finally figured out how to do mesh replacements
1803000	1805000	So that's one thing
1805000	1807000	I am
1807000	1809000	I'm actually
1809000	1811000	Going to probably start livestreaming again
1811000	1813000	My playthrough of Mass Effect 3
1813000	1815000	Just so I can
1815000	1817000	Finish
1817000	1819000	The missions I was on
1819000	1821000	Because I'm like halfway through the game right now
1821000	1823000	And a couple people asked me, so I might do it
1823000	1825000	I also
1825000	1827000	Am playing Borderlands 2
1827000	1829000	With Dan
1829000	1831000	Because Dan's like, you're going to like it, it's going to be fun
1831000	1833000	You won't get that sick
1833000	1835000	I had a headache by the time I was done
1835000	1837000	But I wasn't like frighteningly
1837000	1839000	Nauseous like I usually am with
1839000	1841000	FPS's
1841000	1843000	Which yeah, for any new listener, just because we
1843000	1845000	Get new listeners every few weeks or so
1845000	1847000	You
1847000	1849000	Well, you get sick from
1849000	1851000	Playing first person shooters because of the motion
1851000	1853000	Stuff right? I honestly think that the sickness
1853000	1855000	I was getting was
1855000	1857000	With low res
1857000	1859000	Polygon
1859000	1861000	Because the game that's always done it to me worst
1861000	1863000	Was Goldeneye on
1863000	1865000	The Nintendo 64
1865000	1867000	And the early 3D
1867000	1869000	First person shooters
1869000	1871000	I've noticed that I'll get a little sick with like
1871000	1873000	With Portal 2 for a while
1873000	1875000	And then I was fine
1875000	1877000	And I'm having the same adjustment curve with
1877000	1879000	Borderlands 2 so I think I might be
1879000	1881000	Getting over some of that
1881000	1883000	I still can't use my
1883000	1885000	3DS and I think they
1885000	1887000	No, someone just left
1887000	1889000	I still can't play the 3D mode on my 3DS
1889000	1891000	I'm trying to catch a bug
1891000	1893000	Or something so I can gauge the distance
1893000	1895000	But
1895000	1897000	I'm
1897000	1899000	Also playing
1899000	1901000	Back to
1901000	1903000	Playing some Drunken Robot
1903000	1905000	Pornography which is awesome
1905000	1907000	That's the Jumping Flash
1907000	1909000	The Jumping Flash with guns
1909000	1911000	And dying really quickly that's
1911000	1913000	Really freaking hard game, yeah that game's awesome
1913000	1915000	And
1915000	1917000	I
1917000	1919000	Oh no wonder that was Act F that
1919000	1921000	Left to go get cherries to sell at my retail
1921000	1923000	Stay focused girl
1923000	1925000	And also thank you for loaning
1925000	1927000	Me Kid Icarus because I've really wanted
1927000	1929000	To try it, yeah no worries just watch the hand cramping
1929000	1931000	It's a little crazy
1931000	1933000	Try to put it on a flat surface to play
1933000	1935000	If you can
1935000	1937000	Well going actually back to that I'm actually
1937000	1939000	Thinking about
1939000	1941000	Starting Bayonetta
1941000	1943000	That's a fun game, yeah I loved
1943000	1945000	It and I didn't get too far in it but
1945000	1947000	Since I've started drawing again
1947000	1949000	I haven't had the problem as
1949000	1951000	Quickly with my hand cramping I mean it still
1951000	1953000	Does it like especially if I
1953000	1955000	It actually does it more if I'm writing
1955000	1957000	Than if I'm drawing
1957000	1959000	So but I've actually sat down with the controller
1959000	1961000	I started Final Fantasy 7
1961000	1963000	Which is almost impossible to play with the damn keyboard
1963000	1965000	So I'm probably gonna be
1965000	1967000	I use a 360 controller
1967000	1969000	Yeah we've got that and Dan's
1969000	1971000	Been playing
1971000	1973000	A lot of really
1973000	1975000	Weird Nintendo knockoffs
1975000	1977000	On a Sega Genesis emulator
1977000	1979000	It's been hilarious
1979000	1981000	And he actually just went through
1981000	1983000	The Ballad of Gay Tony again
1983000	1985000	Which is really really good for
1985000	1987000	GTA I actually really like the story
1987000	1989000	So
1989000	1991000	Between the two of us we've actually
1991000	1993000	Had a pretty bustling gaming
1993000	1995000	Week, despite being
1995000	1997000	You know working full time and then
1997000	1999000	Finding out hoops they don't like
1999000	2001000	When you're open minded
2001000	2003000	Anything else for your gaming week?
2003000	2005000	Ummm
2005000	2007000	I know there's
2007000	2009000	Another game but I can't think of it off the top of my head
2009000	2011000	Alright we'll jump in later we'll come back to you
2011000	2013000	Loki how about you?
2013000	2015000	See I played a bit
2015000	2017000	Of Team Fortress 2 this week
2017000	2019000	And
2019000	2021000	What else oh Saints Row the 3rd
2021000	2023000	I went through I was just trying to finish up some more
2023000	2025000	Achievements on the Steam version
2025000	2027000	And I went ahead and
2027000	2029000	Finished off all the
2029000	2031000	Vehicle
2031000	2033000	What was it
2033000	2035000	The car theft stuff
2035000	2037000	Saints book vehicle stuff
2037000	2039000	Where you have to go collect all the vehicles
2039000	2041000	And hijack them and stuff
2041000	2043000	So I did all that and now I have to finish up
2043000	2045000	Like some of the other stuff in the Saints book stuff
2045000	2047000	One of which is
2047000	2049000	The achievement of playing
2049000	2051000	With both sexes so I have
2051000	2053000	Now a female character that I created
2053000	2055000	Just to get that achievement
2055000	2057000	Because I've been playing mostly my male character
2057000	2059000	And so I need to get
2059000	2061000	Two hours out of the way on that
2061000	2063000	To get the achievement and then
2063000	2065000	Ummm
2065000	2067000	Mostly just trying to get
2067000	2069000	Some of the other stuff that
2069000	2071000	I've missed there
2071000	2073000	What else did I play
2073000	2075000	I tried playing some F-Zero GX in Dolphin
2075000	2077000	Just to see how well that worked
2077000	2079000	I figured because Dolphin's been out for a long time
2079000	2081000	That I should be able to run that game and
2081000	2083000	And Dolphin's an emulator
2083000	2085000	For Wii and GameCube games
2085000	2087000	And it
2087000	2089000	Ran like shit so
2089000	2091000	Oh well
2091000	2093000	Well remember it takes a lot more CPU power to emulate
2093000	2095000	You know
2095000	2097000	That actually reminded me
2097000	2099000	I've been trying to get
2099000	2101000	Planet Harriers working
2101000	2103000	Haven't been able to yet
2103000	2105000	And then what else did I do this week
2105000	2107000	Little bit of Call of Duty
2107000	2109000	Modern Warfare 3 still
2109000	2111000	Just because
2111000	2113000	And ummm
2113000	2115000	I pre-purchased
2115000	2117000	My Saints Row 4 on Steam
2117000	2119000	When's that out? That's out what two weeks?
2119000	2121000	It's out a week from Tuesday
2121000	2123000	Oh wow
2123000	2125000	Have you done the character creator?
2125000	2127000	Not yet
2127000	2129000	Originally on PC I was going to import
2129000	2131000	My character
2131000	2133000	But
2133000	2135000	Because my game is modded
2135000	2137000	It won't let me upload my character to their server
2137000	2139000	Yet they're going to somehow
2139000	2141000	Fix that soon
2141000	2143000	That they're going to allow you to upload your modded characters
2143000	2145000	Just because the problem was they have
2145000	2147000	Slider mods
2147000	2149000	I don't really have that on mine
2149000	2151000	But they have slider mods and stuff
2151000	2153000	And that can really screw up characters
2153000	2155000	If you mod a character and then someone downloads that modded character
2155000	2157000	Without having that stuff done
2157000	2159000	So
2159000	2161000	They don't have that yet but they're going to allow that soon
2161000	2163000	But
2163000	2165000	I was going to import that character
2165000	2167000	So I have one for my Xbox
2167000	2169000	I'm just going to import that into 4
2169000	2171000	Because I didn't really need to mess with it yet
2171000	2173000	But it looked fun
2173000	2175000	And I've been working on my game that I'm making
2175000	2177000	So that's it
2177000	2179000	Good luck with that project
2179000	2181000	I'll try to be quick with my gaming week because I honestly
2181000	2183000	Haven't played a lot of new stuff
2183000	2185000	I've been doing the card collecting thing
2185000	2187000	We're kind of in a lull in gaming right now
2187000	2189000	Before the storm really picks up
2189000	2191000	I'm really pumped for the release of Final Fantasy 14
2191000	2193000	Realm Reborn
2193000	2195000	That open beta starts a week from
2195000	2197000	Friday, or last Friday
2197000	2199000	So it's only days away at this point
2199000	2201000	There's a character creator out for 14 by the way
2201000	2203000	Which is also a benchmark
2203000	2205000	So if you're curious about 14 at all
2205000	2207000	You can download that and check it out
2207000	2209000	It's free of course
2209000	2211000	See how that works and play with the character creator there
2211000	2213000	And see what your character would look like in game
2213000	2215000	And the graphics engine that's really good for that game
2215000	2217000	So
2217000	2219000	I was messing around with that
2219000	2221000	Also Team Fortress 2
2221000	2223000	Visiting some older stuff in Steam
2223000	2225000	There's a question I actually played through
2225000	2227000	Probably further than I did on 360 when it first came out
2227000	2229000	It's a great little game
2229000	2231000	And it looks better on the PC than it did on 360
2231000	2233000	I played that for about 20-30 minutes
2233000	2235000	It was like okay this is neat
2235000	2237000	And then I alt tabbed it and went AFK
2237000	2239000	It's fun, I like that, it's a good game
2239000	2241000	And then I've also still been playing the MOBAs
2241000	2243000	I can't remember if I talked about this on the last show
2243000	2245000	I think I did a little bit
2245000	2247000	But I started getting into League of Legends
2247000	2249000	And Dota 2, kind of both of them
2249000	2251000	I don't know, there's things I like about Dota 2
2251000	2253000	And there's things I like about League of Legends
2253000	2255000	So I'm kind of juggling them both right now
2255000	2257000	Which when you're trying to learn them is really confusing
2257000	2259000	But there's these Dota 2
2259000	2261000	Championships going on right now
2261000	2263000	Which you can actually watch, but what I like about it
2263000	2265000	Is that it's not necessarily just like this Twitch thing
2265000	2267000	Or something where you're watching a livestream
2267000	2269000	But you can actually watch in the game client
2269000	2271000	Like while the people are playing
2271000	2273000	And I thought that was kind of neat
2273000	2275000	And apparently if you pony up some cash which goes into the pot
2275000	2277000	You can get in-game items as well with that
2277000	2279000	So that's kind of neat
2279000	2281000	Okay, well, and you know
2281000	2283000	Valve is pretty proud of Dota 2
2283000	2285000	I'm pretty sure, so yeah
2285000	2287000	So I've been playing that
2287000	2289000	I've also been playing League of Legends
2289000	2291000	Dota 2 I'm still mostly in the single player
2291000	2293000	Tutorial stuff, like doing the bot matches
2293000	2295000	And all that, but League of Legends
2295000	2297000	I am playing a lot of co-op versus bots
2297000	2299000	I'm not playing player versus player yet
2299000	2301000	Because I feel like I still suck
2301000	2303000	And I have a lot to learn
2303000	2305000	Also, I'm playing League of Legends
2305000	2307000	I'm playing League of Legends
2307000	2309000	I still suck and I have a lot to learn
2309000	2311000	Although the last match I played
2311000	2313000	Last night I think it was
2313000	2315000	Actually boosted my confidence quite a bit
2315000	2317000	Which is funny because we lost
2317000	2319000	A match against beginner bots
2319000	2321000	But I was the only person
2321000	2323000	Out of the five to get any kills
2323000	2325000	And I actually had like a streak going
2325000	2327000	That actually kind of boosted my confidence
2327000	2329000	I was like, alright, I do know what I'm doing
2329000	2331000	Compared to these four other people
2331000	2333000	So how bad could it be going into a
2333000	2335000	Player versus player match
2335000	2337000	So everybody pray for me
2337000	2339000	As I go into that
2339000	2341000	But that's pretty much my gaming week
2341000	2343000	So, we will start to move into news
2343000	2345000	But I do always like to take a minute for housekeeping
2345000	2347000	Again, we will have no show over
2347000	2349000	Labor Day weekend, but that's still a few weeks away
2349000	2351000	Because I will be in Atlanta at Dragon Con
2351000	2353000	Which I hope you will come by
2353000	2355000	And say hi at the VoG panel
2355000	2357000	Which will be Sunday night at Dragon Con
2357000	2359000	If you're there
2359000	2361000	Also, you can friend us on Twitter
2361000	2363000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R and Facebook
2363000	2365000	Twitter.com slash Orange Lounge Radio
2365000	2367000	Be our friend
2367000	2369000	Let's get into the news
2369000	2371000	It's also been a bit of a slow news week
2371000	2373000	But we still got a few things we want to point out
2373000	2375000	That's going on
2375000	2377000	So, Loki, why don't you start us off
2377000	2379000	Alright, so, let's talk a little bit about
2379000	2381000	Amazon and
2381000	2383000	Yet another company getting on the
2383000	2385000	Android game console bandwagon
2385000	2387000	So, Amazon
2387000	2389000	I guess is playing on
2389000	2391000	It's sort of a rumor right now
2391000	2393000	That they're developing a console
2393000	2395000	I'm assuming it's going to support the Amazon
2395000	2397000	Marketplace
2397000	2399000	As far as details beyond that
2399000	2401000	No idea what it's going to be
2401000	2403000	But basically
2403000	2405000	There's still rumors that Google's
2405000	2407000	Developing their own console
2407000	2409000	So
2409000	2411000	I don't know
2411000	2413000	We'll see
2413000	2415000	They're saying that maybe we'll see it
2415000	2417000	Around Black Friday
2417000	2419000	But
2419000	2421000	It's funny, the more and more I hear
2421000	2423000	About other companies coming out with their own consoles
2423000	2425000	And the specs
2425000	2427000	And the features sound better
2427000	2429000	The less and less I like my Ouya
2429000	2431000	Well, and it's also one of those things where it's like
2431000	2433000	Good God, what kind of
2433000	2435000	What did Ouya do?
2435000	2437000	Now I'm worried that everybody wants a piece of that
2437000	2439000	Because the Kickstarter was so successful
2439000	2441000	It's like we're seeing all of these clones
2441000	2443000	And I'm like, surely
2443000	2445000	We see the end of this coming
2445000	2447000	Where all this crap saturates
2447000	2449000	The market, and then none of them do well
2449000	2451000	I don't think it's necessarily that they're going to
2451000	2453000	Saturate the market, it's just going to be
2453000	2455000	It's, I mean, you can
2455000	2457000	Kind of compare that to tablets
2457000	2459000	Oh my God, there's so many tablets out there that
2459000	2461000	Saturate the market, and none of them are going to do well
2461000	2463000	You know, I think that's what's going to end up happening
2463000	2465000	When you get all these individual marketplaces
2465000	2467000	Because you have
2467000	2469000	Ouya, which is on its own
2469000	2471000	Marketplace, and Amazon, which is its own
2471000	2473000	Marketplace
2473000	2475000	And the Mad Catz one though
2475000	2477000	Is on just a regular
2477000	2479000	Google Play Marketplace
2479000	2481000	So that might be okay
2481000	2483000	I would assume that the Google one
2483000	2485000	Would be on the Google Play Marketplace
2485000	2487000	So it's just when you start
2487000	2489000	Segmenting the Marketplace like that
2489000	2491000	That's when you run into problems
2491000	2493000	I mean, it's great for indie developers
2493000	2495000	That want to, I guess, get their game out
2495000	2497000	Because now they can put it on all these
2497000	2499000	Marketplaces because, I mean, porting your game
2499000	2501000	From Android to
2501000	2503000	The Amazon Marketplace
2503000	2505000	Basically just putting it on the Marketplace
2505000	2507000	Because they're pretty much the same
2509000	2511000	And then also spec wise
2511000	2513000	Some of these newer consoles
2513000	2515000	Are going to be a lot better spec wise
2515000	2517000	Than the Ouya
2517000	2519000	The Ouya may have done
2519000	2521000	Okay as far as Kickstarter goes
2521000	2523000	But the way they've been handling everything
2523000	2525000	Oh, Game Stick was the other one
2525000	2527000	That's another Marketplace, it's its own thing
2527000	2529000	And then there was the other one that was streaming
2529000	2531000	Games, I don't know
2531000	2533000	There's a ton of different options out there
2533000	2535000	And at the end of the day
2535000	2537000	They're all kind of offering similar things
2537000	2539000	There's not a lot of exclusive stuff
2539000	2541000	That differentiates one from the next
2541000	2543000	And
2543000	2545000	The experience isn't all that great
2545000	2547000	At least for the Ouya right now
2547000	2549000	Because that's the only one that's actually to market
2549000	2551000	So far
2551000	2553000	I don't know
2553000	2555000	I think this question is a bit of an ahh
2555000	2557000	But other people are asking it
2557000	2559000	So I'll ask it too
2559000	2561000	Do Sony and Nintendo have anything to be worried about
2561000	2563000	With these consoles, why?
2563000	2565000	Yeah, no
2565000	2567000	I don't think they have anything to be worried about right now
2567000	2569000	But the way things are going right now
2569000	2571000	Is everything kind of trending towards
2571000	2573000	People being, especially a lot of these companies
2573000	2575000	Being interested in indie
2575000	2577000	Developers
2577000	2579000	And
2579000	2581000	Definitely trying to
2581000	2583000	Get indie developers on their platform
2583000	2585000	Because that seems to be where a lot of the interest
2585000	2587000	And innovation is nowadays
2587000	2589000	And so you have these indie platforms
2589000	2591000	Out there like the Ouya
2591000	2593000	It may not be a very powerful platform
2593000	2595000	But it's an independent platform
2595000	2597000	So far, I mean it's still closed
2597000	2599000	But you gotta have some sort of
2599000	2601000	Restrictions in place so there's not rampant piracy
2601000	2603000	Because as far as I'm aware right now
2603000	2605000	I don't think you can really pirate Ouya games
2605000	2607000	Although I haven't rooted my Ouya yet
2607000	2609000	Soon
2609000	2611000	So I don't really know how it really
2611000	2613000	Treats that, but
2613000	2615000	I think that's kind of been the draw
2615000	2617000	Is there's all these indie games
2617000	2619000	I think that if a company like
2619000	2621000	Amazon or even Mad Cats
2621000	2623000	Or Google come out
2623000	2625000	With their own, well we know
2625000	2627000	Mad Cats is, but if they come out with their own
2627000	2629000	Device, I think it's going to be
2629000	2631000	A better piece of hardware
2631000	2633000	And as far as the customer service
2633000	2635000	And the way everything's handled is going to be a better
2635000	2637000	Device anyways because they have experience
2637000	2639000	With developing
2639000	2641000	Things and actually being able to market it
2641000	2643000	And have the platform, they're much bigger
2643000	2645000	Than a start up company like Ouya
2645000	2647000	Or PlayStick for example
2647000	2649000	So I think it's promising
2649000	2651000	But I'd have to see what their specs are going to be
2651000	2653000	I mean hell, Amazon
2653000	2655000	Making a console wouldn't be that
2655000	2657000	Crazy considering they have their own
2657000	2659000	Tablets so
2659000	2661000	Why not? I can see that happening
2661000	2663000	Alright
2663000	2665000	Well, we'll see if there's any truth to this
2665000	2667000	I think the one thing too I want to throw out there
2667000	2669000	Is that it would be interesting with Amazon because
2669000	2671000	They do have all the things that are tied to Amazon Prime
2671000	2673000	Such as, you know, their version of Netflix
2673000	2675000	Which, you know, big deal
2675000	2677000	All those boxes will play the streaming
2677000	2679000	Video things, but it could be interesting as well
2679000	2681000	What kind of like special things they might
2681000	2683000	Offer that would be exclusive to their
2683000	2685000	Console, you know, keep in mind they have
2685000	2687000	The Kindle stuff too, they have
2687000	2689000	The movie marketplace
2689000	2691000	Where you can buy things, it would be interesting
2691000	2693000	To see if there might be any synergy
2693000	2695000	There. But the price even
2695000	2697000	Of their tablets is coming down so much that
2697000	2699000	Like, I would think it'd be
2699000	2701000	In their best interest not necessarily to
2701000	2703000	Come out with a console but to maybe come out with
2703000	2705000	Something that you can play your
2705000	2707000	Games on your tablet and then
2707000	2709000	You can stream them to your TV
2709000	2711000	You know, even almost like that Google
2711000	2713000	The Chromecast thing
2713000	2715000	Or, you know, and have a controller
2715000	2717000	And stuff so then that way you can take it
2717000	2719000	On the go and you can play with it at
2719000	2721000	Home and stuff. How I really wish
2721000	2723000	The, you know, Wii U was kind of handled where you
2723000	2725000	Could, you know, that'd be awesome to have your games
2725000	2727000	Loaded on like a compact
2727000	2729000	Not a compact flash but like, you know, some sort of
2729000	2731000	You know, flash memory
2731000	2733000	Or something like that and then that way
2733000	2735000	You can play them on the go instead of having
2735000	2737000	It stream from your console, of course, you know
2737000	2739000	It's not gonna work hardware wise but
2739000	2741000	It would still be kinda cool if you could
2741000	2743000	Do that as easily and I know that was
2743000	2745000	Something that they wanted to do with like the Vita
2745000	2747000	Even where, you know, you play your
2747000	2749000	Vita version of MLB
2749000	2751000	Or you play your PS3 version of
2751000	2753000	MLB and then you flip it over to
2753000	2755000	The, you know, Vita and you take it on
2755000	2757000	On the road and that kind of stuff. I think
2757000	2759000	That would be really cool but
2759000	2761000	I don't know, we'll have to see. I mean right now it's just
2761000	2763000	A rumor and I mean hell
2763000	2765000	Apple, I mean that's been
2765000	2767000	A rumor for the longest time that Apple's gonna do something
2767000	2769000	With Apple TV or something that turned that into
2769000	2771000	A console so
2771000	2773000	I don't know, I don't, it's
2773000	2775000	All these different options though
2775000	2777000	That are not necessarily
2777000	2779000	Like the major console manufacturers
2779000	2781000	Are good options I think for indies
2781000	2783000	So, and even now, even with
2783000	2785000	The way they're kind of, you know
2785000	2787000	Opening it up a little bit for indies
2787000	2789000	Especially like the Xbox One and the PlayStation
2789000	2791000	4 and stuff, it's just
2791000	2793000	It's a good time to be indie I guess
2793000	2795000	Alright, well let's
2795000	2797000	Move on to some more news
2797000	2799000	This company isn't necessarily indie
2799000	2801000	But people sure love their games and
2801000	2803000	To the point where people will go
2803000	2805000	To great lengths to figure out where the
2805000	2807000	Heck this company might be going and
2807000	2809000	It's Valve and it's about
2809000	2811000	An upcoming project that's been spotted
2811000	2813000	Left 4 Dead 3
2813000	2815000	Now this is a little more than
2815000	2817000	You know, well since they did 1 and 2
2817000	2819000	A 3's gotta happen at some point, but here's what happened
2819000	2821000	Apparently a Valve
2821000	2823000	Studio tour was given
2823000	2825000	To some folks who actually
2825000	2827000	Got a snapshot of somebody's
2827000	2829000	Computer that actually had references
2829000	2831000	To, well it's like a change log
2831000	2833000	Of everything that's been going on
2833000	2835000	It had references to Source 2
2835000	2837000	Which we know has been a thing, Valve's openly said
2837000	2839000	They're working on Source
2839000	2841000	Pretty surprised, but L4D3
2841000	2843000	Was also there
2843000	2845000	So, you know, it's something
2845000	2847000	That's happening, could that be the first
2847000	2849000	Game to use Source 2
2849000	2851000	Who knows, and not
2851000	2853000	Unfortunately Half-Life 3, I don't know
2853000	2855000	But apparently
2855000	2857000	More thoughts come out after it
2857000	2859000	That say, hey, this is actually something that
2859000	2861000	Is happening, so
2861000	2863000	Alan, I'm sure
2863000	2865000	You've been following this a bit, what do you think?
2865000	2867000	Well the Source engine, which was
2867000	2869000	Designed and made for Half-Life 2 originally
2869000	2871000	Which is 2003-2004
2871000	2873000	Anything that Valve
2873000	2875000	Has put out that's not Dota
2875000	2877000	Is on Source, Team Fortress 2
2877000	2879000	Portal, Half-Life 2
2879000	2881000	Episode 2, it's all the modified
2881000	2883000	Original Source engine
2883000	2885000	If Source 2 is done
2885000	2887000	To the point where they can release L4D3
2887000	2889000	On it, even if it takes another 3 years
2889000	2891000	If that, like, this is the product
2891000	2893000	This is the Source 2 engine running, that means
2893000	2895000	Half-Life 3, they have
2895000	2897000	An API that they're going to build the game on top of
2897000	2899000	So now, announce it
2899000	2901000	Or should you just give up hope?
2901000	2903000	Mark Laidlaw, who I
2903000	2905000	Tweeted with a couple weeks ago
2905000	2907000	He posted a vine of him in an elevator
2907000	2909000	And he was kind of hovering his finger
2909000	2911000	Over the 3 button
2911000	2913000	Hovering, then the last second he pushes L
2913000	2915000	For lobby, like he won't push 3
2915000	2917000	And I was like, ugh, like a dagger in my heart
2919000	2921000	Wasn't there something else too, where it was like
2921000	2923000	He said something about playing Pikmin 3 and you tweeted him
2923000	2925000	Like, what's it like?
2925000	2927000	Yeah, he was like, Pikmin 3 is really good
2927000	2929000	And I was like, so Mark, what's it like to play a sequel
2929000	2931000	With a 3 in it, what's that like?
2931000	2933000	And he favorited it and then said
2933000	2935000	Oh, we're all slaves to Nintendo
2937000	2939000	Valve hearts Nintendo confirmed
2939000	2941000	Yeah
2941000	2943000	I love Twitter for things like that
2943000	2945000	That's why Twitter rules
2945000	2947000	I do find it funny that people are looking forward
2947000	2949000	To L4D3 considering that there was a
2949000	2951000	Boycott campaign for L4D2
2951000	2953000	If you remember that
2953000	2955000	Oh, right, because it came out so soon after the first one
2955000	2957000	Its street date was almost a year after
2957000	2959000	L4D1
2959000	2961000	But that was, of course, 3, 4, 5 years ago
2961000	2963000	So now 3 has had enough time to
2963000	2965000	Simmer
2965000	2967000	Tigerkaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says
2967000	2969000	What if Valve is like Half-Life 3
2969000	2971000	Exclusive on Xbox One and PlayStation 4
2971000	2973000	Since both consoles have PC hardware
2973000	2975000	Gabe would never let that happen
2975000	2977000	Gabe would have to be pushed down a flight of stairs
2977000	2979000	Portal 2 was on PlayStation 3
2979000	2981000	Well, I guess it was on Xbox too, but it was way better on PlayStation 3
2981000	2983000	With the Steam integration and all that
2983000	2985000	It was way better on Steam
2985000	2987000	That's true
2987000	2989000	I would also think too, honestly, if Steam's got this
2989000	2991000	Steam bot, and I said this on the show before
2991000	2993000	I said if they want to sell a million of those
2993000	2995000	Steam boxes, make Half-Life 3
2995000	2997000	A timed exclusive to those Steam boxes
2997000	2999000	And watch that shit sell
2999000	3001000	I mean, that's all they'd have to do
3001000	3003000	Right?
3003000	3005000	Alright, anyhow, let's move on, more news
3005000	3007000	DarkSakura
3007000	3009000	You know how we all complain about GameStop
3009000	3011000	The evil G
3011000	3013000	As we have been calling it
3013000	3015000	Basically, the federal judge
3015000	3017000	In Camden, New Jersey said
3017000	3019000	Uh, yeah, you can sue them, go for it
3019000	3021000	Basically saying that
3021000	3023000	The games that were being sold
3023000	3025000	There did not fully
3025000	3027000	Advertise
3027000	3029000	That there might be other costs
3029000	3031000	Involved, like for online passes
3031000	3033000	Which, honestly
3033000	3035000	I think the lawsuit
3035000	3037000	Is a little bit on the frivolous side
3037000	3039000	Because it is common sense
3039000	3041000	However, to quote a
3041000	3043000	Deadpool meme
3043000	3045000	Common sense, so rare it's a super power
3045000	3047000	Yeah
3047000	3049000	So, because these people lack common sense
3049000	3051000	And other people agree
3051000	3053000	That they shouldn't have to have common sense
3053000	3055000	GameStop is being sued
3055000	3057000	Well, I mean, if someone's grandma
3057000	3059000	Wants to get, you know, 8 year old Timmy
3059000	3061000	Modern Warfare 3
3061000	3063000	And she's trying to get herself a deal
3063000	3065000	And buys it
3065000	3067000	And she gives it to him
3067000	3069000	Thinking that it's new
3069000	3071000	Or he thinks it's new and it's used and now he can't play online
3071000	3073000	She didn't know, there wasn't a sticker on it
3073000	3075000	Right, so
3075000	3077000	It's for people buying games that don't play games
3077000	3079000	But it's still though
3079000	3081000	It's technically
3081000	3083000	I mean, this is a decision for the publishers
3083000	3085000	Technically the game is complete
3085000	3087000	You can play the game
3087000	3089000	And sometimes even a portion of the multiplayer
3089000	3091000	But, you know, it's additional DLC
3091000	3093000	That you need to purchase
3093000	3095000	You know
3095000	3097000	I mean, even though it's kind of sad
3097000	3099000	Is when they did this lawsuit
3099000	3101000	That now it's already fixed
3101000	3103000	The problem is already gone
3103000	3105000	So, I don't think
3105000	3107000	That they should be
3107000	3109000	I don't think it's GameStop's decision
3109000	3111000	I don't think they should have to be
3111000	3113000	Responsible for something the publisher does
3113000	3115000	Which is ironic
3115000	3117000	Because EA has now said
3117000	3119000	That they're doing away with online pass
3119000	3121000	It's very attractive too
3121000	3123000	So any of those games that you buy
3123000	3125000	They're gone
3125000	3127000	But unfortunately it doesn't really change
3127000	3129000	In the world of a lawsuit
3129000	3131000	Because there was a window of time when it was the case
3131000	3133000	I want to say, if I remember correctly
3133000	3135000	I think these are the same guys that were suing
3135000	3137000	Subway and actually won
3137000	3139000	For the footlongs
3139000	3141000	Did they win? I thought that hadn't been decided yet
3141000	3143000	Oh, okay, I wasn't sure
3143000	3145000	But for the footlongs being 11 inches
3145000	3147000	Which, come on
3147000	3149000	The foot is fucking 12 inches
3149000	3151000	That also raises the red flag
3151000	3153000	A little bit, though
3153000	3155000	Okay, now we're talking about a serial lawsuit
3155000	3157000	Type of individual
3157000	3159000	You always kind of have to raise your eyebrow
3159000	3161000	With that, like, potentially
3161000	3163000	Abusing the system
3163000	3165000	I
3165000	3167000	I think that it's something
3167000	3169000	That, yeah, it's good to have on your label
3169000	3171000	But, in the end
3171000	3173000	And
3173000	3175000	I think
3175000	3177000	People are looking for excuses
3177000	3179000	To sue
3179000	3181000	The moment somebody is the slightest
3181000	3183000	Bit put off
3183000	3185000	That the first thought
3185000	3187000	Is sue
3187000	3189000	And I think that
3189000	3191000	It would have
3191000	3193000	Been better
3193000	3195000	Better handled by sending a
3195000	3197000	Letter of complaint to the company
3197000	3199000	I don't know if they did that
3199000	3201000	I haven't seen anything about that in the article
3201000	3203000	But, um
3203000	3205000	But they should have
3205000	3207000	Instead of, you know, just suing the company
3207000	3209000	The right step would have been
3209000	3211000	Contacting the company and say
3211000	3213000	Hey, this wasn't on the label
3213000	3215000	We weren't aware of this
3215000	3217000	What can you do? If they don't
3217000	3219000	Respond, then the next logical
3219000	3221000	Step would be
3221000	3223000	Better business bureau
3223000	3225000	Then the next logical step
3225000	3227000	May be a lawsuit if they are that
3227000	3229000	Pleased, but in the end
3229000	3231000	I
3231000	3233000	I really think jumping right to that
3233000	3235000	Conclusion is frivolous
3235000	3237000	You know, it is also stupid too because
3237000	3239000	Even says right here, it's one of the guys
3239000	3241000	Bought, you know, Need for Speed
3241000	3243000	Hot Pursuit
3243000	3245000	And, um
3245000	3247000	He tried to play it online and then it says
3247000	3249000	He was hit with an extra fee of $15
3249000	3251000	No, he was told to purchase DLC
3251000	3253000	It was $15. At that point, if he doesn't like that
3253000	3255000	He should have returned it back to the store
3255000	3257000	Which he could do within seven days
3257000	3259000	I don't understand
3259000	3261000	That might be GameStop's way out of this too
3261000	3263000	I don't understand, you know, why
3263000	3265000	And no one was forcing him to do that
3265000	3267000	You know, if anything
3267000	3269000	If you want to get into it, if anything
3269000	3271000	I think people should be suing fucking EA
3271000	3273000	For having to pay those online passes
3273000	3275000	And then them shutting the servers down
3275000	3277000	That would be a little bit more
3277000	3279000	Worth merit
3279000	3281000	I mean, even now, it's just kind of like
3281000	3283000	Okay, well, they're done with that
3283000	3285000	But I don't think GameStop's really
3285000	3287000	Should be the blame of that stuff
3287000	3289000	You're buying a used copy
3289000	3291000	A used copy is not the same as a new copy
3291000	3293000	It's gonna, you know
3293000	3295000	Anything that you buy used is not gonna be
3295000	3297000	Of the same quality as a new thing
3297000	3299000	So, I think this is gonna be thrown out
3299000	3301000	I think that they're gonna
3301000	3303000	They're not gonna win it
3303000	3305000	I actually think they're gonna win
3305000	3307000	We'll see
3307000	3309000	Didn't we kind of predict that this might happen
3309000	3311000	When we first heard about the online pass
3312000	3314000	That the consumers would not be educated on it
3314000	3316000	And that this kind of thing would happen
3316000	3318000	I'm almost positive it had to be said
3318000	3320000	I mean, there's two phrases
3320000	3322000	That are gonna be going out of
3322000	3324000	I think common parlance, you know, soon
3324000	3326000	One of them is, you know
3326000	3328000	The buyer beware
3328000	3330000	And the other one's going to be shoppers remorse
3330000	3332000	Or buyers remorse
3332000	3334000	Because you can just sue now if you're remorseful over your purchase
3334000	3336000	Dungeonbuster in our chatroom says
3336000	3338000	There are people that still have trouble interpreting
3338000	3340000	ESRB ratings
3340000	3342000	That's true, maybe the consumer's not gonna learn this stuff anytime soon
3342000	3344000	That's why they need to rate them like they do movies
3344000	3346000	Yeah, I agree with that
3346000	3348000	I only think the ESRB is so
3348000	3350000	Confusing because it seems pretty
3350000	3352000	It says what an E for everyone
3352000	3354000	I don't understand how that's confusing
3354000	3356000	It's not to you and me
3356000	3358000	At what point though, I mean
3358000	3360000	I was actually dealing with my library
3360000	3362000	Accounts and stuff and we're talking about Final Fantasy
3362000	3364000	XIV, you know
3364000	3366000	They're ordering it thinking it's a game
3366000	3368000	That they can rent out or loan out to
3368000	3370000	Their customers even though
3370000	3372000	On our internal website
3372000	3374000	That they order off of, there's a big
3374000	3376000	Fucking banner
3376000	3378000	It's bold and there's
3378000	3380000	Yellow behind it that says
3380000	3382000	Will not work
3382000	3384000	MMO, cost money to play
3384000	3386000	Not recommended for
3386000	3388000	Renting out
3388000	3390000	People are stupid and they see Final Fantasy
3390000	3392000	I didn't know
3392000	3394000	What more can you fucking do
3394000	3396000	To tell these people
3396000	3398000	Or inform them
3398000	3400000	Even the ESRB, they tweak their shit
3400000	3402000	So that it would be more clear
3402000	3404000	There's nothing you can do
3404000	3406000	To get it through these people
3406000	3408000	Parents and stuff, they just don't give a shit
3408000	3410000	No amount of changing your logos
3410000	3412000	Sometimes parents just don't understand
3412000	3414000	Sometimes just parents don't give a shit
3414000	3416000	Or consumers don't give a shit
3416000	3418000	And they're whatever
3418000	3420000	They're not gonna learn
3420000	3422000	What it is
3422000	3424000	I hate to say it, my mother is a prime example of this
3424000	3426000	And actually there are
3426000	3428000	Psychological studies going behind this
3428000	3430000	People get comfortable with a certain idea
3430000	3432000	And anything that
3432000	3434000	Supports their idea, even if it is
3434000	3436000	Wrong, gives them
3436000	3438000	Basically a happy
3438000	3440000	Chemical response
3440000	3442000	That's why there's a lot of stupid Republicans out there
3442000	3444000	Wow
3444000	3446000	Well that's why Rush Limbaugh exists then
3446000	3448000	But it goes either way
3448000	3450000	The moment that something
3450000	3452000	Is said that's
3452000	3454000	Contrary to this idea
3454000	3456000	That is imprinted into their minds
3456000	3458000	It of course forms an opposite
3458000	3460000	Response, the first instinct
3460000	3462000	Is not to listen to it, is to dismiss it
3462000	3464000	Even if it might save them
3464000	3466000	Money in the long run, and then when they go back
3466000	3468000	To suffer the consequences of it
3468000	3470000	Of course, oh well nobody told me that's because
3470000	3472000	You have a selective fucking memory
3472000	3474000	Alright
3474000	3476000	Um
3476000	3478000	I wanted to go to another comment in our chatroom at
3478000	3480000	Live.vognetwork.com from ShadowNextGen
3480000	3482000	Who says, there was some good GameStop news
3482000	3484000	This week too
3484000	3486000	I'm assuming that's the reprinting of Xenoblade
3486000	3488000	Right? Oh yeah
3488000	3490000	That came across my Twitter, that has to be it
3490000	3492000	Yeah that has to be the good GameStop news
3492000	3494000	Someone, and I'm sorry if you're in chat and I just blanked on who it was
3494000	3496000	But someone on my Twitter feed posted
3496000	3498000	Xenoblade Chronicles
3498000	3500000	Used
3500000	3502000	And it was 80 bucks
3502000	3504000	Used from GameStop and if they're reprinting
3504000	3506000	It they have to redo that used
3506000	3508000	I had no idea that the printing was that limited
3508000	3510000	And it should just be GameStop exclusive
3510000	3512000	It's weird that they're reprinting it too
3512000	3514000	When the Wii isn't really being pushed right now
3514000	3516000	It's supposed to be all about the Wii U
3516000	3518000	You can play it in the Wii U though right?
3518000	3520000	Well of course you can, but I wonder if the prices drop
3520000	3522000	Maybe it's like $20 at this point
3522000	3524000	It would make a really good
3524000	3526000	Thing to have on Wii U
3526000	3528000	Please
3528000	3530000	Them dropping the price of something that's going
3530000	3532000	For $90 right now
3532000	3534000	And it's exclusive to them, yeah I'm sure
3534000	3536000	They're totally motivated from competition
3536000	3538000	To drop that price
3538000	3540000	Like hell they are
3540000	3542000	It's probably going to come back at 60 bucks
3542000	3544000	Alright let's move on with some more news
3544000	3546000	Loki
3546000	3548000	Alright so there was a couple
3548000	3550000	Bits of information from
3550000	3552000	Microsoft this week about
3552000	3554000	Things
3554000	3556000	Including Xbox Live family packs
3556000	3558000	They are going away
3558000	3560000	Obviously since we already knew that
3560000	3562000	And they're going to be converted into individual
3562000	3564000	Gold accounts on August
3564000	3566000	27th
3566000	3568000	That's probably around the same time
3568000	3570000	The new dashboard update is going to come out
3570000	3572000	And we're going to have some other things tied in with that
3572000	3576000	One of the reasons why they're doing this
3576000	3578000	Is because the
3578000	3580000	Xbox One
3580000	3582000	For example is going to allow you to share
3582000	3584000	Your gold membership, sort of
3584000	3586000	Basically the way they're going to do it
3586000	3588000	Is you have
3588000	3590000	Your console
3590000	3592000	Only one person or one
3592000	3594000	Live account on that console
3594000	3596000	Needs to have live gold
3596000	3598000	So say I have my family
3598000	3600000	And each one of them has an Xbox Live account
3600000	3602000	I only need to have gold
3602000	3604000	For everybody to play online
3604000	3606000	Regardless of which account is signed in
3606000	3608000	And then also the same thing
3608000	3610000	Like if I go to my friend's house
3610000	3612000	And sign into my account
3612000	3614000	They can also play on Xbox Live with me
3614000	3616000	While I'm over there
3616000	3618000	Then they came out and started talking about
3618000	3620000	This digital game sharing thing
3620000	3622000	Which made people think, oh my god they brought back
3622000	3624000	The digital game thing that they were talking about
3624000	3626000	Before and it was so fucking awesome
3626000	3628000	Which we never saw and we had no idea what it really was
3628000	3630000	So first off
3630000	3632000	They came out and they
3632000	3634000	Phrased it kind of like that, hey we're bringing
3634000	3636000	The digital game sharing thing back
3636000	3638000	You're going to be able to do that
3638000	3640000	The problem is, it isn't fucking new
3640000	3642000	This is the same shit that you can do right now
3642000	3644000	On the Xbox 360
3644000	3646000	It's basically, I buy a game online
3646000	3648000	For example, say I bought
3649000	3651000	I don't know, an Xbox Live arcade game
3651000	3653000	Say I bought a
3653000	3655000	Super Street Fighter 2 or something like that
3655000	3657000	And I have it on my console
3657000	3659000	I've downloaded it
3659000	3661000	It's good to go, I can play it
3661000	3663000	Anybody that's in my family
3663000	3665000	Or anybody else, any other account on
3665000	3667000	My console can play that as well
3667000	3669000	If I go over to Rob's
3669000	3671000	And download the game
3671000	3673000	Sign into my account
3673000	3675000	And download the game on his console
3675000	3677000	We can play it
3678000	3680000	Full version, as long as I'm signed in
3680000	3682000	But as soon as I leave, it's going to revert back
3682000	3684000	To the demo version
3684000	3686000	It's exactly the same fucking shit that happens right now
3686000	3688000	And they fucking marketed it as some brand new
3688000	3690000	Fucking thing, and guess what
3690000	3692000	A bunch of the fucking unwashed masses
3692000	3694000	Xbox fanboys or whatever
3694000	3696000	Holy shit
3696000	3698000	Game set match, fucking takeover
3698000	3700000	You're so fucking stupid
3700000	3702000	You don't even realize
3702000	3704000	How stupid you are
3704000	3706000	To be fair
3706000	3708000	Cool, this game sharing thing
3708000	3710000	It's the same shit you have now
3710000	3712000	And you're like, oh my god
3712000	3714000	I'm going to buy an Xbox One now because it's so amazing
3714000	3716000	You're so stupid
3716000	3718000	And that's why they're going to be able to sell those consoles
3718000	3720000	Because you're so fucking stupid
3720000	3722000	You're so fucking stupid
3722000	3724000	And I love it because I was complaining about that shit on Twitter
3724000	3726000	And some random fucking idiot that works on a
3726000	3728000	Microsoft store is like, no that's not how it was
3728000	3730000	This is brand new information
3730000	3732000	I'm like, you're a fucking idiot
3732000	3734000	You sell this shit and you don't even fucking know what you're talking about
3734000	3736000	You dumbass
3736000	3738000	Alright?
3738000	3740000	Except I said that in my head
3740000	3742000	I'm not going to waste my time doing that
3742000	3744000	He was all red in the face just going, okay
3744000	3746000	You couldn't fit it in 140 paces
3746000	3748000	Oh, I showed so much restraint
3748000	3750000	I was going to film a YouTube video and all that shit
3750000	3752000	I was going to like, oh hey
3752000	3754000	What the hell, it's black magic
3754000	3756000	My 360 turned into an Xbox One
3756000	3758000	To be fair
3758000	3760000	Just to play devil's advocate a little bit to your rant
3760000	3762000	Loki
3762000	3764000	One of the things that Xbox One is offering
3764000	3766000	That Xbox 360 didn't offer is the whole game streaming
3766000	3768000	Where you can start playing the game right away
3768000	3770000	Without the mega long installation
3770000	3772000	So, I mean, doesn't that kind of
3772000	3774000	Yes, while this isn't a new thing
3774000	3776000	Doesn't it really enhance
3776000	3778000	Because it wouldn't be practical
3778000	3780000	For me to like, say, bring Mass Effect over to your house
3780000	3782000	And we have to
3782000	3784000	Or, excuse me, go over to your house
3784000	3786000	To install my digital copy of Mass Effect
3786000	3788000	Or whatever and wait for it to download 7 gigs
3788000	3790000	Before we play it
3790000	3792000	Because Xbox One will be able to play it right away
3792000	3794000	So that does kind of enhance it a little bit
3794000	3796000	Right?
3796000	3798000	Well, yeah, because it would have just been ridiculous
3798000	3800000	If you had to do that
3800000	3802000	As it is, I mean, I know
3802000	3804000	Hopefully they're going to treat the recovering profiles
3804000	3806000	A lot easier because
3806000	3808000	Now you have to download your profile
3808000	3810000	And it takes a while
3810000	3812000	And then you'd have to download the game
3812000	3814000	And all that stuff
3814000	3816000	It's just kind of ridiculous
3816000	3818000	Of course, I mean, they're going to try to market it
3818000	3820000	And how amazing this is
3820000	3822000	Of course they're going to do that
3822000	3824000	Because they want to make themselves look good
3824000	3826000	So, why not?
3826000	3828000	ActDeaf in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says
3828000	3830000	It's been a while since we've had a Loki rage that hard
3830000	3832000	And TigerClaw says
3832000	3834000	Loki ranting and shouting at the Microsoft employee
3834000	3836000	Probably would have been like that video of the lady
3836000	3838000	Shouting at an Apple store
3838000	3840000	I seriously thought about doing that
3840000	3842000	But just to prove myself right
3842000	3844000	It's not worth it
3844000	3846000	On someone like that that's randomly going through
3846000	3848000	And commenting on everybody's story
3848000	3850000	And I went and read through his stuff
3850000	3852000	And I'm like, nah, it's not even worth it
3852000	3854000	He's drank so much of the Microsoft Kool-Aid
3854000	3856000	That there's no getting through this guy
3856000	3858000	I'm not even going to waste my time
3858000	3860000	Do you really think the Xbox One is going to be that bad though?
3860000	3862000	Because I kind of think they've gone back
3862000	3864000	On everything they need to
3864000	3866000	The only thing that makes the Xbox One
3866000	3868000	At this point is the fact that it's $100 more
3868000	3870000	And has that required Kinect
3870000	3872000	But it's kind of one of those things where it's like
3872000	3874000	Inevitably, a year and a half after it launches
3874000	3876000	There will be some type of price drop
3876000	3878000	I will get an Xbox One eventually
3878000	3880000	I'm not saying that the Xbox One is bad
3880000	3882000	I'm just calling out bullshit marketing
3882000	3884000	That's all I'm calling out
3884000	3886000	If Sony did the exact same thing
3886000	3888000	If Sony came out and said
3888000	3890000	Hey, let's talk about how awesome
3890000	3892000	Cloud sharing is
3892000	3894000	This is a brand new feature that we're bringing to the PlayStation 4
3894000	3896000	It's never been done before
3896000	3898000	I'd call them out and be like, fuck you
3898000	3900000	This has been something that's been available already
3900000	3902000	Something like that
3903000	3906000	Nintendo started talking about something ridiculous
3908000	3912000	I find it fascinating that they would come out and say that
3912000	3914000	But it makes sense
3914000	3916000	Of course they're going to want to do that
3916000	3918000	And the game sharing thing
3918000	3920000	Yeah, it's cool
3920000	3922000	I can sign into my account and play the games I have bought
3922000	3924000	That's not really sharing
3924000	3926000	That's more like I'm going to a friend's house and watching a movie
3926000	3928000	That I brought with me or something
3928000	3930000	Any comment from Alan or Dark Soccer on this before we move on?
3930000	3932000	I like rants
3934000	3936000	Like I said in chat
3936000	3938000	If they create some sort of
3938000	3940000	Mobile mode or travel mode
3940000	3942000	For your account when you sign in
3942000	3944000	It makes the process faster
3944000	3946000	That'd be nice
3946000	3948000	But like Loki said, it's still the same shit we have now
3948000	3950000	I hate importing my profile
3950000	3952000	To a different Xbox
3952000	3954000	It takes like 10 minutes
3954000	3956000	And you have to do it again
3956000	3958000	When you come back home, you have to reimport your profile
3958000	3960000	That's awful
3960000	3962000	Going forward
3962000	3964000	This is probably going to tie in with Xbox One
3964000	3966000	Live accounts
3966000	3968000	Because you're connecting to their service
3968000	3970000	It's probably just going to exist in the cloud
3970000	3972000	You're just going to be signing in like you would sign in on a website
3972000	3974000	And you're never going to have to download that profile
3974000	3976000	Because it's all on the cloud
3976000	3978000	So that's
3978000	3980000	Probably going to improve
3980000	3982000	You're not going to have that
3982000	3984000	My 10 meg profile
3984000	3986000	For some reason
3986000	3988000	If I'm downloading any other 10 meg file
3988000	3990000	Anywhere
3990000	3992000	It would be like instantaneous
3992000	3994000	But oh no, for some reason
3994000	3996000	I'm operating at 24 4
3996000	3998000	Or 28 8 or whatever
3998000	4000000	Going back to the 90s
4000000	4002000	Let me bandwidth
4002000	4004000	In the interest of time, I'm going to move on
4004000	4006000	I want to talk a little bit about Nintendo
4006000	4008000	Because Nintendo put out one of their Nintendo Directs this week
4008000	4010000	Where they talked about
4010000	4012000	Clarified a few things going on for the rest of the year
4012000	4014000	For the record, I think those are a brilliant idea
4014000	4016000	They're working out really well
4016000	4018000	The great thing is they kind of come out of nowhere
4018000	4020000	People are already saying
4020000	4022000	Get ready, y'all
4022000	4024000	Apple is going to do something on September 10
4024000	4026000	God, that's so far away
4026000	4028000	So far away?
4028000	4030000	It's less than a month
4030000	4032000	That's still a long ways away
4032000	4034000	Compared to Nintendo
4034000	4036000	There's going to be a Nintendo Direct day after tomorrow
4036000	4038000	Get up early and watch it
4038000	4040000	I'm just saying
4040000	4042000	They had the Nintendo Direct
4042000	4044000	There's no real big bombshells
4044000	4046000	But just a few things
4046000	4048000	First off, Sonic Lost World will be coming out October 22
4048000	4050000	They were talking about some kind of functionality
4050000	4052000	Between 3DS and Wii U
4052000	4054000	That sounded interesting
4054000	4056000	Art Academy Sketchpad for Wii U
4056000	4058000	Some details there
4058000	4060000	Kind of looks like you'll be able to post your drawings
4060000	4062000	Into Miiverse
4062000	4064000	Which as Miiverse grows
4064000	4066000	Looks like some people are doing some crazy shit in there too
4066000	4068000	I think there's a version of it already
4068000	4070000	Downloadable
4070000	4072000	A little mini version of it
4072000	4074000	Luigi was confirmed
4074000	4076000	As a new Super Smash Brothers character
4076000	4078000	I was kind of like
4078000	4080000	Isn't that kind of a given?
4080000	4082000	I kind of already thought he was
4082000	4084000	Is he going to have crazy leg jumping?
4084000	4086000	Did he in the other ones?
4086000	4088000	I was thinking
4088000	4090000	They need to announce
4090000	4092000	Mecha Luigi or Demon Deaf Luigi
4092000	4094000	Where he's a super uber one
4094000	4096000	Or Waluigi
4096000	4098000	Waluigi's awesome
4098000	4100000	I have another Nintendo exclusive
4100000	4102000	The next Zelda game is going to have canon in it
4102000	4104000	Oh my god
4104000	4106000	Alright
4106000	4108000	Moving on
4108000	4110000	Some other things announced in the Nintendo Direct
4110000	4112000	Rayman Legends Wii U will have Mario and Luigi costumes
4112000	4114000	Now they're not going to actually be Mario and Luigi
4114000	4118000	But it's like Rayman wearing the red suspenders and all that
4118000	4120000	I still found it interesting
4120000	4122000	Despite all the drawings
4122000	4124000	I kind of think that's one of those games nowadays
4124000	4126000	For any Nintendo made
4126000	4130000	Game that's like oh we gotta have some reference to Mario in it
4130000	4132000	Gotta have it
4132000	4134000	Even I remember like was it Need for Speed
4134000	4136000	Most Wandered or something
4136000	4140000	It had cars based off of the Mario Kart cars or something
4140000	4142000	It's just
4142000	4144000	It's neat I guess
4144000	4146000	But when you do it in every single game
4146000	4148000	When there's an homage to Mario in every goddamn game
4148000	4150000	That's third party
4150000	4152000	What are we going to get in Assassin's Creed
4152000	4154000	Are we going to have a Mario hat in Assassin's Creed
4154000	4156000	Watch Dogs
4156000	4158000	Are you going to have a Mario hat in Watch Dogs
4158000	4160000	I mean come on
4160000	4162000	They showed us some more footage
4162000	4164000	From Wind Waker HD and A Link Between Worlds
4164000	4166000	And I am so here for A Link Between Worlds
4166000	4168000	That's like my most anticipated 3DS title right now
4168000	4170000	Pretty interesting
4170000	4172000	Little virtual console tidbit
4172000	4174000	A game they're going to put out on the 3DS eShop
4174000	4176000	Summer Carnival 92
4176000	4178000	Wrecka
4178000	4180000	Wrecka? Oh my god that game's awesome
4180000	4182000	It's so rare too
4182000	4184000	I might have done Wrecka
4184000	4186000	It's a neat game
4186000	4188000	For a NES game
4188000	4190000	And they actually acknowledge this shit is rare
4190000	4192000	And now everybody's going to be able to play it
4192000	4194000	So that was kind of neat
4194000	4196000	Some other things they announced for virtual console on 3DS
4196000	4198000	Donkey Kong, Wario Land 3
4198000	4200000	Super Mario Bros. 3
4200000	4202000	And Tecmo Bowl
4202000	4204000	In the Nintendo archive
4204000	4206000	I think a lot of that stuff is already on the Wii
4206000	4208000	Virtual console save maybe Wario Land 3
4209000	4211000	Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright
4211000	4213000	Ace Attorney that was confirmed for the US
4213000	4215000	A lot of people hoping that would get it localized
4215000	4217000	It will be in 2014
4217000	4219000	And then kind of their big thing they said at the end
4219000	4221000	Was that they were putting out a new
4221000	4223000	Application in the Wii U called
4223000	4225000	Animal Crossing Plaza
4225000	4227000	And I actually did download this and check it out
4227000	4229000	It's basically, it's another way of looking at
4229000	4231000	Miiverse basically
4231000	4233000	But it is kind of cute because you have all the little
4233000	4235000	Animals walking around the screen and you can
4235000	4237000	Click on an animal
4237000	4239000	And you can actually see Miiverse posts about that
4239000	4241000	Specific animal
4241000	4243000	Also it interfaces with
4243000	4245000	Your game card
4245000	4247000	So you can actually take the SD card out of your
4247000	4249000	3DS, put it in your Wii U
4249000	4251000	And get your screenshots again on Miiverse
4251000	4253000	Which, interesting
4253000	4255000	I don't know
4255000	4257000	It was a weird little last tease
4257000	4259000	But I kind of like that they're trying to push
4259000	4261000	The boundaries of Miiverse with some different things
4261000	4263000	But for me I'm going to be honest
4263000	4265000	It was one of those things I downloaded it once
4265000	4267000	But I was like, huh, neat
4267000	4269000	Then I turned it off and I probably won't ever run it again
4269000	4271000	But
4271000	4273000	For those that are really into sharing the creative
4273000	4275000	Stuff they've done in Animal Crossing it might be kind of cool
4275000	4277000	So those are some of the highlights
4277000	4279000	Of the Nintendo Direct
4279000	4281000	So please look forward to all those games
4281000	4283000	Coming out soon
4283000	4285000	Dark Sakura, before we get to release dates, what do you have for us?
4285000	4287000	Well we do have a demo
4287000	4289000	That's finally on the Wii U
4289000	4291000	Wii U eShop
4291000	4293000	Wii U Wii U eShop
4293000	4295000	It's been on the
4295000	4297000	American Wii U
4297000	4299000	eShop as well
4299000	4301000	Wonderful 101
4301000	4303000	Which I watched the trailer for
4303000	4305000	Last night
4305000	4307000	Actually this kind of makes me want
4307000	4309000	A Wii U again
4309000	4311000	Tank Tank Tank was kind of a tank
4311000	4313000	But
4313000	4315000	It's free now
4315000	4317000	This though, it was done by
4317000	4319000	Hideki Kiyama
4319000	4321000	Who did Beautiful Joe
4321000	4323000	It looks like the same feel
4323000	4325000	That Beautiful Joe had, which was a fun
4325000	4327000	Series of games
4327000	4329000	So I really
4329000	4331000	Really am excited about this one
4331000	4333000	It just looks really fun
4333000	4335000	And it had sort of that Sentai feel
4335000	4337000	To it, you know
4337000	4339000	I like Sentai
4339000	4341000	So I think this might be
4341000	4343000	The convincing factor
4343000	4345000	Even Dan was sort of like, ooh that looks cool
4345000	4347000	There are a lot of people pretty excited about this game
4347000	4349000	So I need to download the demo, I keep forgetting
4349000	4351000	I gotta screw that up
4351000	4353000	I would do that right now, but I need the bandwidth
4353000	4355000	For the show
4355000	4357000	Remind me to do that later
4357000	4359000	Have you seen anything about Wonderful 101?
4359000	4361000	A lot of people on my Twitter are really excited for it
4361000	4363000	Yeah, but we're friends with a lot of Nintendo fanboys
4363000	4365000	Bless their hearts
4365000	4367000	Bless their hearts, alright
4367000	4369000	To register participation
4369000	4371000	For this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
4371000	4373000	At vognetwork.com
4373000	4375000	Use the passphrase, kidney
4375000	4377000	Let's move on to some release dates
4377000	4379000	Travel around the world and see what games are coming out
4379000	4381000	To a store near you very soon
4381000	4383000	The Angry Birds Trilogy
4383000	4385000	On Wii and Wii U this week
4385000	4387000	Because they didn't get them the last time around
4387000	4389000	Payday 2
4389000	4391000	On Playstation 3 and Xbox 360
4391000	4393000	Phineas and Ferb
4393000	4395000	Quest for Cool Stuff
4395000	4397000	Oh my god, Phineas and Ferb
4397000	4399000	Xbox 360, Wii, Wii U
4399000	4401000	3DS and DS
4401000	4403000	And one week from today
4403000	4405000	Disney Infinity
4405000	4407000	PlayStation 3, Xbox 360
4407000	4409000	Wii, Wii U
4409000	4411000	And 3DS as well
4411000	4413000	A whole fucking ton of characters
4413000	4415000	Any idea
4415000	4417000	What platform I should get it on
4417000	4419000	Because, you know
4419000	4421000	Like Alan said, we're Twitter friends
4421000	4423000	With a lot of Nintendo fanboys
4423000	4425000	So I'm kind of leaning towards Wii U for that reason
4425000	4427000	So I can play with them, but then I'm like
4427000	4429000	Oh god, but then I think about things like Injustice
4429000	4431000	Where the, you know, online was kind of out
4431000	4433000	Wii 360
4434000	4436000	I was thinking PlayStation 3
4436000	4438000	If you have a Wii U
4438000	4441000	Then the tablet acts as the ARFID chip reader
4441000	4443000	Does it though? Because I thought that
4443000	4445000	Wasn't being implemented until a patch later on
4445000	4447000	Although they are talking about the Pokemon Rumble
4447000	4449000	Because in Skylanders
4449000	4451000	No, it's not
4451000	4453000	But it's going to
4453000	4455000	It's going to happen for that
4455000	4457000	But it's definitely not going to happen for Infinity
4457000	4459000	Because there's too much shit that goes on that portal
4459000	4461000	There's like a bunch of things
4461000	4463000	No way that would happen
4463000	4465000	I know with Skylanders you need that little
4465000	4467000	Crystal thing
4467000	4469000	That you put the thing on
4469000	4471000	But if you have a Wii U
4471000	4473000	If you have a Wii U, just put the action figure
4473000	4475000	On your tablet and it's like, okay, I read it
4475000	4477000	You have this character now
4477000	4479000	It's one of those features, like the IR port on the 3DS
4479000	4481000	Or like the DS or whatever
4481000	4483000	That they're never going to fucking use
4483000	4485000	Except for that Pokemon game
4485000	4487000	But you could tap your credit card on it and use that
4487000	4491000	Don't kid yourself
4491000	4493000	That'll be a thing
4493000	4495000	When they announced the Pokemon Rumble
4495000	4497000	I was like, why didn't they announce
4497000	4499000	A new Pokemon Snap with amazing
4499000	4501000	AR
4501000	4503000	Tablet camera support
4503000	4505000	I kind of wish that my son was older
4505000	4507000	So that he would be appreciative of this stuff
4507000	4509000	I can get him a Mater
4509000	4511000	The problem is though, to get the
4511000	4513000	Cars playset, it's like 40 bucks
4513000	4515000	For the Cars playset
4515000	4517000	$13 for the Mater
4517000	4519000	And then Disney Infinity is another like
4519000	4521000	$75
4521000	4523000	No, I'm not spending $120
4523000	4525000	That's estimated
4525000	4527000	On this stuff
4527000	4529000	Just to have a playable Mater
4529000	4531000	Besides Saint's Row 4
4531000	4533000	That's all that's bad
4533000	4535000	Teaching to play Saint's Row
4535000	4537000	Hell yeah
4537000	4539000	Alright, well this is where I would usually do the
4539000	4541000	Japanese release dates, but guess what
4541000	4543000	There's nothing until August 22nd
4543000	4545000	Isn't it a holiday right now?
4545000	4547000	I think it is, so you have things on the 22nd
4547000	4549000	To look forward to, like Disorder 6
4549000	4551000	Dungeons and Dragons Mysteria
4551000	4553000	We talked about that before
4553000	4555000	But those are all on the 22nd
4555000	4557000	So I'll touch on them again next week, but for now
4557000	4559000	It's an empty week in Japan
4559000	4561000	I did want to mention, because I was talking about
4561000	4563000	Angry Birds this earlier, my son plays Angry Birds
4563000	4565000	Actually, he can kind of
4565000	4567000	Do it, he 3-starred a level the other day
4567000	4569000	Oh, good job
4569000	4571000	Wow, that's pretty cool
4571000	4573000	It's a little hard for him to do it on the phone
4575000	4577000	That's the only game he plays so far
4577000	4579000	But hey, I'll take anything
4579000	4581000	You gotta start somewhere
4581000	4583000	Alright, well since I don't have Japanese releases, how about the UK?
4583000	4585000	We have, coming out
4585000	4587000	We have DuckTales Remastered on the 13th
4587000	4589000	Which actually, I bought that for Dan
4589000	4591000	The day I got fired
4591000	4593000	Which I shouldn't have spent money on
4593000	4595000	But I thought I had a job
4595000	4597000	He came up and said
4597000	4599000	My girl loves me
4599000	4601000	She got me DuckTales
4601000	4603000	Aww, I'm gonna barf
4603000	4605000	How much he's gonna love you when you buy him Strider
4605000	4607000	I know, right?
4607000	4609000	Also coming out is
4609000	4611000	Europa Universalis 4
4611000	4613000	And then Payday 2
4613000	4615000	On PC
4615000	4617000	On the 14th, also
4617000	4619000	DuckTales Remastered for PS3
4621000	4623000	Alright, just a few more news stories
4623000	4625000	For you guys in the classic game of the week
4625000	4627000	And I was a little surprised with Dark Soccer's
4627000	4629000	Pick this week
4629000	4631000	Just because it's one of those games
4631000	4633000	Where you're like, oh yeah
4633000	4635000	You gotta do that at some point
4635000	4637000	I've come across
4637000	4639000	Quite a few that are like, you haven't done that yet?
4639000	4641000	Mandatory selection
4641000	4643000	Alright, Loki
4643000	4645000	Alright
4645000	4647000	Let's see
4647000	4649000	Kinda going back to some of the changes
4649000	4651000	That are gonna be happening with the
4651000	4653000	Xbox 360, Xbox Live, all that stuff
4653000	4655000	As previously mentioned
4655000	4657000	Before, they are getting
4657000	4659000	Rid of Microsoft Points
4659000	4661000	And are gonna be converting over to
4661000	4663000	Real currency
4663000	4665000	And this is supposed to be happening sometime in the 4th quarter
4665000	4667000	October-ish
4667000	4669000	Well, it's actually gonna take place at the end of
4669000	4671000	August, they're gonna convert your
4671000	4673000	Funds over to real money
4673000	4675000	But they're gonna release new cards I believe in October
4675000	4677000	And they're gonna come in different
4677000	4679000	Nominations of
4679000	4681000	50 bucks, 25 dollars
4681000	4683000	30 dollars, which is actually 3
4683000	4685000	10 dollar cards, and 15 dollars
4685000	4687000	So those are gonna be available
4687000	4689000	Around October-ish
4689000	4691000	And your
4691000	4693000	Microsoft Point cards will still work
4693000	4695000	Until they say they won't
4695000	4697000	And the only little
4697000	4699000	Bit of small fine print that you have
4699000	4701000	About the points that you have on your
4701000	4703000	Account, they must be spent by
4703000	4705000	June of 2015
4705000	4707000	So they are giving you 2 years
4707000	4709000	Instead of 1 year now, but I mean honestly
4709000	4711000	You shouldn't really have that much money sitting on your account
4711000	4713000	It means I have to use the
4713000	4715000	Card I got for my birthday
4715000	4717000	Well, not necessarily
4717000	4719000	I mean you can, you just don't
4719000	4721000	Yeah, you have 2 years
4721000	4723000	I mean come on, you should be able to spend
4723000	4725000	It in that time
4725000	4727000	You got enough time
4727000	4729000	My digital copy of Grand Theft Auto 5
4729000	4731000	Buy more rock band songs, you know that's what she's gonna do
4731000	4733000	I got the email blast about this
4733000	4735000	From Microsoft, and the way the email
4735000	4737000	Made it sound like it was happening
4737000	4739000	Now, it just said
4739000	4741000	With an upcoming Xbox
4741000	4743000	System update
4743000	4745000	This will take effect, it didn't actually have any dates in it
4745000	4747000	Well the system update from what I'm gathering
4747000	4749000	Because they like to do every single system update
4749000	4751000	Because they do a new band wave
4751000	4753000	Before a major game release
4753000	4755000	So the next system update I'm betting is gonna be right before
4755000	4757000	Grand Theft Auto 5
4757000	4759000	And that would be the beginning of September
4759000	4761000	And that's when they've mentioned they're gonna convert
4761000	4763000	Everything over, so it would make sense
4763000	4765000	And they're doing a beta right now for it
4765000	4767000	So it's probably very soon
4767000	4769000	Yeah, probably end of August
4769000	4771000	Alright
4771000	4773000	Well I don't know how many of y'all are fans of the
4773000	4775000	EverQuest series, but there was quite a bit of news
4775000	4777000	About EverQuest coming out this week
4777000	4779000	Some expansions for
4779000	4781000	EverQuest and EverQuest 2
4781000	4783000	EverQuest getting a new expansion called
4783000	4785000	Call of the Forsaken
4785000	4787000	Guess what number expansion it is for the EverQuest game
4787000	4789000	Guess what number?
4789000	4791000	One, 37 in a row
4791000	4793000	Close, it is the
4793000	4795000	20th expansion for EverQuest
4795000	4797000	Can you imagine? How many has World of Warcraft had?
4797000	4799000	4? 5?
4799000	4801000	5. 5. Is it?
4801000	4803000	Yeah, 5. So hopefully a 6
4803000	4805000	Burning Crusade
4805000	4807000	Wrath of the Lich King
4807000	4809000	Cataclysm, Pandaria is a 4
4809000	4811000	Woah, Pandas. It's a 4
4811000	4813000	Because Vanilla doesn't count as a suspension
4813000	4815000	But we all know a 5th is coming
4815000	4817000	You know, at Blizzcon this year
4817000	4819000	How many people have they lost now?
4819000	4821000	It's going down
4821000	4823000	They were 7.7 as of the last courthouse
4823000	4825000	Yeah, we'll see
4825000	4827000	But 7.7 is still way more than any other MMO
4827000	4829000	So we'll see
4829000	4831000	Well, I don't know
4831000	4833000	We could get into a longer discussion on this
4833000	4835000	About how League of Legends has a heck of a lot of people playing that
4835000	4837000	But it's not really measured the same way
4837000	4839000	But anyway, that's another discussion
4839000	4841000	Back to EverQuest, Call of the Forsaken
4841000	4843000	Is the 20th expansion
4843000	4845000	Where you will face off against the Dragon Lady
4845000	4847000	Lendenaria
4847000	4849000	And return peace to the world of Norrath
4849000	4851000	As the way these things go
4851000	4853000	Two shared bank slots
4853000	4855000	A new heroic adventure system
4855000	4857000	New gear, new raids
4857000	4859000	EverQuest 2 is getting its 10th expansion
4859000	4861000	Tears of Vashon
4861000	4863000	A new channeler class coming in with that
4863000	4865000	I think one thing that caught a lot of people's attention
4865000	4867000	However, is the news on EverQuest Next
4867000	4869000	EverQuest Next
4869000	4871000	Was shown just a little tidbits
4871000	4873000	And a website up
4873000	4875000	But EverQuest Next will have destructible environments
4875000	4877000	And it's not like a total sandbox
4877000	4879000	Like playground
4879000	4881000	There will be restrictions on what you can
4881000	4883000	And what you can't destroy
4883000	4885000	But what I thought about this
4885000	4887000	There's this whole other kind of section to it
4887000	4889000	Where people will be able to build their own stuff
4889000	4891000	And maybe sell it
4891000	4893000	Like a little transaction place
4893000	4895000	And EverQuest Next is going to be a free thing
4895000	4897000	I felt like a little bit of Minecraft inspiration here
4897000	4899000	And a lot of the screenshots look really good
4899000	4901000	And I was like, okay
4901000	4903000	Being able to craft in-game and then sell it
4903000	4905000	Depending on whether it has a real money aspect
4905000	4907000	Or what
4907000	4909000	That's very Second Life
4909000	4911000	Landmark is the name of what I was thinking of
4911000	4913000	You can construct a structure on a plot of land
4913000	4915000	That you claim in the world
4915000	4917000	And then you can sell it in the Player Studios marketplace
4917000	4919000	For use in EverQuest Next
4919000	4921000	So
4921000	4923000	That's very Second Life
4923000	4925000	Who's going to build the gigantic penis first?
4925000	4927000	I guess
4927000	4929000	I'm assuming these things have to be screened
4929000	4931000	Oh Rob, not everybody's into penis
4931000	4933000	Okay
4933000	4935000	Then boobies
4935000	4937000	Anyhow, also
4937000	4939000	It should be mentioned that there's also
4939000	4941000	An iOS and Android app
4941000	4943000	Happening called EverQuest Worlds
4943000	4945000	Quests and minigames that will
4945000	4947000	Tie into lore content and rewards
4947000	4949000	In the EverQuest franchise
4949000	4951000	That app is free and available now
4951000	4953000	If you're an EverQuest fan, there's a lot going on
4953000	4955000	Right now
4955000	4957000	Pretty cool
4957000	4961000	Teto13811 in our chat says
4961000	4963000	EverQuest meets Minecraft
4963000	4965000	Which is kind of cool
4965000	4967000	I like the idea of that
4967000	4969000	Let's see
4969000	4973000	Trying to see if anybody else is talking about it
4973000	4975000	At
4975000	4977000	Live.vognetwork.com
4977000	4979000	I see some comments on the Microsoft point card thing
4979000	4981000	Tigerclaw says
4981000	4983000	What's going to happen, I think, is Microsoft will replace
4983000	4985000	Those points card with the ones similar to PlayStation Network
4985000	4987000	Where you can buy a $20 or $50 card
4987000	4989000	Yeah, I think that's pretty much exactly what's happening
4989000	4991000	Yeah
4991000	4993000	That comment might have come in before you read that
4993000	4995000	Alright, anyhow
4995000	4997000	That does it for the news
4997000	4999000	For part A
4999000	5001000	But we can't wrap this up
5001000	5003000	Until we take a trip down memory lane
5003000	5007000	It's a segment we call the classic game of the week
5007000	5009000	Where Dark Sakura is going to step into the gaming vault
5009000	5011000	And find a game that she thinks, hey
5011000	5013000	Listen
5013000	5015000	And play this game
5015000	5017000	I see what you did there
5017000	5019000	Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week
5019000	5021000	Classic game of the week is Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time
5021000	5023000	I told you guys, right?
5023000	5025000	Like, I mean, she has to do it eventually, right?
5025000	5027000	That's a really obscure deep cut, Dark Sakura
5027000	5029000	Right
5029000	5031000	Okay, then we'll do Panorama Cotton again
5031000	5033000	Jeez, Rammoral Dragon
5033000	5035000	You can't do the same game twice
5035000	5037000	Even though you totally did it once
5037000	5039000	You know what, Rob, you know what, you know what, you know what
5039000	5041000	What?
5041000	5043000	So, I had to pick this music to start off with
5043000	5045000	Anyway, the Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time
5045000	5047000	Also known in Japan as
5047000	5049000	Zeru no Densetsu Toki no Ocarina
5049000	5051000	Is, um
5051000	5053000	The Nintendo 64 Zelda option
5053000	5055000	The very first one that came out
5055000	5057000	It came out in Japan on November 21st, 1998
5057000	5059000	And North America November 23rd
5059000	5061000	And in Europe December 11th, same year
5061000	5063000	It was originally developed for the
5063000	5065000	Nintendo 64 Double D
5065000	5067000	And it came out in Japan on November 21st, 1998
5067000	5069000	And North America November 23rd
5069000	5071000	And in Europe December 11th, same year
5071000	5073000	Originally developed for the Nintendo 64 Double D
5073000	5075000	But instead came out on
5075000	5077000	Excuse me
5077000	5079000	But instead came out for
5079000	5081000	The, uh
5081000	5083000	Nintendo 64
5083000	5085000	So, um
5085000	5087000	You play as Link, you go through Hyrule
5087000	5089000	You have a, you know, completely open world
5089000	5091000	I mean, for as small as it was
5091000	5093000	It was an open world
5093000	5095000	And you had to do several different things
5095000	5097000	You time traveled, you had to solve different puzzles
5097000	5099000	It's a Zelda game
5099000	5101000	But it was the first of its type
5101000	5103000	I really think
5103000	5105000	It was, it had a really good story
5105000	5107000	It was really in depth
5107000	5109000	It had some very weird stuff going on in it
5109000	5111000	But it didn't have that stupid moon
5111000	5113000	And it didn't have Tingle
5113000	5115000	So, it was a lot better than Majora's Mask
5115000	5117000	Rude
5117000	5119000	I know
5119000	5121000	Also, um, the Guinness Book of World Records
5121000	5123000	Said that Ocarina of Time was the highest rated
5123000	5125000	Game ever reviewed
5125000	5127000	And, uh
5127000	5129000	Also for 2008 and 2010
5129000	5131000	So, it gets a lot of love
5131000	5133000	Um, there was also, um
5133000	5135000	Some re-releases
5135000	5137000	One of them was the Ocarina of Time Master Quest
5137000	5139000	That had, uh
5139000	5141000	The dungeons redone with new puzzles
5141000	5143000	And then the collector's edition
5143000	5145000	Which was a port for, uh
5145000	5147000	GameCube, which
5147000	5149000	We have that
5149000	5151000	I've actually got the gold cartridge for
5151000	5153000	Nintendo 64, which has some fun glitches
5153000	5155000	In it
5155000	5157000	You can do some, uh
5157000	5159000	Different fun stuff
5159000	5161000	So, anyway, um, like I said
5161000	5163000	Roleplay game, uh, had different elements
5163000	5165000	Has a Z-targeting
5165000	5167000	That, uh, basically lets you
5167000	5169000	Lock onto another item
5169000	5171000	So that you can focus on it
5171000	5173000	And kill it easier
5173000	5175000	That game did give me some different perspective issues
5175000	5177000	But, you know, you also do
5177000	5179000	Quest for the NPC, so it has a slightly
5179000	5181000	MMO quality to it
5181000	5183000	Um, you know, just that RPG element
5183000	5185000	And so, basically, you have to get the Master Sword
5185000	5187000	Kill Ganon, save Zelda
5187000	5189000	The end, which is typical
5189000	5191000	Uh
5191000	5193000	Basically with this game
5193000	5195000	It had, like I said
5195000	5197000	Some various ports, re-releases
5197000	5199000	It was re-released, um
5199000	5201000	On the GameCube as an emulated ROM
5201000	5203000	And it also had that, uh
5203000	5205000	Master Quest with it
5205000	5207000	And it was part of the Legend of Zelda Collector's Edition
5207000	5209000	Um
5209000	5211000	It also, uh
5211000	5213000	The Japanese version was called
5213000	5215000	Toki no Ocarina GC Ura
5215000	5217000	Um
5217000	5219000	Let's see
5219000	5221000	It also, uh, we had other, uh, versions
5221000	5223000	That came out with, uh
5223000	5225000	A GBA re-release of A Link to the Past
5225000	5227000	You could buy it on Virtual Console
5227000	5229000	Basically, it was available
5229000	5231000	Bless you
5231000	5233000	Um
5233000	5235000	It was available, you know, for a while
5235000	5237000	Now, like I said, there was a 64 double D version
5237000	5239000	That was planned
5239000	5241000	Not as Zelda, but, um
5241000	5243000	It was supposed to expand the game outside of the cartridge limits
5243000	5245000	And that's where that Master Quest came from
5245000	5247000	Which is why the Japanese version
5247000	5249000	Was called Ura
5249000	5251000	Uh, we have the game on the 3DS
5251000	5253000	Which is
5253000	5255000	The game
5255000	5257000	And, uh
5257000	5259000	They probably have a
5259000	5261000	Well, like it's saying here, they've actually fixed up
5261000	5263000	Quite a few things that were wrong with it
5263000	5265000	Um, the audio was, of course, done by Koji Kondo
5265000	5267000	Rob's playing my favorite music in the game right now
5269000	5271000	The, uh
5271000	5273000	Get it out of the valley
5275000	5277000	I have a special love of, uh
5277000	5279000	Classical guitar
5279000	5281000	Um, so anyway, yeah
5281000	5283000	The game is like one of the
5283000	5285000	Most loved Nintendo games of all time
5285000	5287000	It's definitely, I would say
5287000	5289000	Probably one of the best that ever came out
5289000	5291000	On the Nintendo 64
5291000	5293000	So we're just looking at an instant classic
5293000	5295000	When it came out, especially given
5295000	5297000	How pretty it was when it came out
5297000	5299000	And, now this is something that's
5299000	5301000	Actually important to me
5301000	5303000	And I even remember this, because this was actually
5303000	5305000	The first time I heard of Philip Glass
5305000	5307000	They compared a lot of Koji Kondo's music
5307000	5309000	In this to Philip Glass
5309000	5311000	And, basically
5311000	5313000	Um
5313000	5315000	This composer came into
5315000	5317000	Discussion recently
5317000	5319000	In, uh, helping people with
5319000	5321000	Autistic meltdowns overcome them
5321000	5323000	By listening to minimalist music
5323000	5325000	And I, it made me think
5325000	5327000	That back, you know, when I was, you know
5327000	5329000	Playing through this game, if ever I found
5329000	5331000	Myself in, uh
5331000	5333000	A situation where I felt
5333000	5335000	Overwhelmed, I'd go listen to Zelda music
5335000	5337000	And calm down, the same way I listened to Philip Glass
5337000	5339000	And calm down, so I thought it was very
5339000	5341000	Interesting that that stylistic
5341000	5343000	Uh, comparison was drawn between the music
5343000	5345000	And that I react to both of them in the same way
5345000	5347000	So it was pretty cool
5347000	5349000	This was the game that made me
5349000	5351000	Go out and buy an N64
5351000	5353000	Unpopular opinion time, but I
5353000	5355000	Played Mario 64 for about 30 minutes
5355000	5357000	And I'm like, this is confusing and weird, I don't like it
5357000	5359000	This is muddy as shit
5359000	5361000	I was at, I was the age
5361000	5363000	Where being a fanboy came to you very easily
5363000	5365000	I was what, what year was this?
5365000	5367000	97?
5367000	5369000	Yeah, I've been like 18 or 19, yeah
5369000	5371000	Yeah, or 19 or 20, so yeah, being a fanboy came
5371000	5373000	Very naturally to me, um, but for this
5373000	5375000	I was like, okay, this 3D is amazing
5375000	5377000	And I bought Ocarina of Time
5377000	5379000	With an N64, bought them both, took them up
5379000	5381000	Up to the counter at Electronics Boutique
5382000	5384000	And, um, I bought other N64 games
5384000	5386000	Like Ogre Battle 64
5386000	5388000	Paper Mario, never played them
5388000	5390000	Bought them, never played them, I played Ocarina
5390000	5392000	Beat it, never touched my N64 again
5392000	5394000	See, my Rabid fanboy thing
5394000	5396000	Which, you know, to some extent
5396000	5398000	Still kind of holds to this day, is
5398000	5400000	I really resented the transition to 3D
5400000	5402000	And I just always preferred A Link to the Past
5402000	5404000	And I think I still do to this day
5404000	5406000	I just, you know, and I understand why this game has this
5406000	5408000	I don't think this is a bad game
5408000	5410000	So get off my back
5410000	5412000	It's not my thing
5412000	5414000	I had a really hard time adjusting to the 3D
5414000	5416000	Just like with me, you know, my unpopular opinion
5416000	5418000	I guess, is that
5418000	5420000	I liked Wind Waker better than
5420000	5422000	Ocarina of Time
5422000	5424000	The visuals just
5424000	5426000	Turned me off so much from the game
5426000	5428000	That maybe I just didn't give it a chance
5428000	5430000	But I just don't care
5430000	5432000	I mean, I liked Wind Waker
5432000	5434000	I really honestly wish it carried on with that kind of visual style
5434000	5436000	Because imagine recreating
5436000	5438000	A Link to the Past in that style
5438000	5440000	Where it's full 3D
5440000	5442000	That'd be fucking amazing
5442000	5444000	And at one point, spoiler, in Wind Waker
5444000	5446000	You kind of see what that might have been like
5446000	5448000	And I was just like
5448000	5450000	Why don't they do that?
5450000	5452000	Why didn't they do something like that?
5452000	5454000	I would be cool to see them do like
5454000	5456000	A remake of Ocarina of Time
5456000	5458000	Like HD, you know
5458000	5460000	Actually, not just up res everything
5460000	5462000	But recreate the game
5462000	5464000	Redo all the 3D visuals
5464000	5466000	What if they did it in the style of Twilight Princess?
5466000	5468000	See, I didn't really play Twilight Princess
5468000	5470000	I bought it, and I didn't really
5470000	5472000	Twilight Princess was finally when I came around to accept the 3D Zelda
5472000	5474000	Twilight Princess was great
5474000	5476000	There's a part in this game, Ocarina of Time
5476000	5478000	That did make me a little emotional too at that age
5478000	5480000	I was very sad
5480000	5482000	The green girl, the little forest girl
5482000	5484000	Who has a crush on Link
5484000	5486000	Sorry, yeah
5486000	5488000	When you are older and you have to find the seven sages
5488000	5490000	That are going to banish Ganon
5490000	5492000	She's one of them, and there's this scene where now
5492000	5494000	She has to go off and she's never going to see Link again
5494000	5496000	And he's older and she's the same age
5496000	5498000	And you can kind of tell that she has a thing for him
5498000	5500000	I just was very like
5500000	5502000	I teared up at that
5502000	5504000	She was a very sad character for me
5504000	5506000	But how many of us that played the game
5506000	5508000	Screamed at the owl when you accidentally made him start over?
5508000	5510000	Yeah, yeah
5510000	5512000	Spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam
5512000	5514000	Did you hear what I said? No
5514000	5516000	You're like, exit, exit, exit
5516000	5518000	Shit
5518000	5520000	So yeah, Saria, that was it
5520000	5522000	I knew it was something like that
5522000	5524000	So yeah, Ocarina of Time
5524000	5526000	It was a great game
5526000	5528000	I think some people underappreciated it
5528000	5530000	But it was the one
5530000	5532000	That bridged the gap from
5532000	5534000	The old era to the new
5534000	5536000	And for me
5536000	5538000	There was just so much stuff in it
5538000	5540000	I loved the Gerudo
5540000	5542000	I loved going around
5542000	5546000	And the one level that I really hated doing though
5546000	5550000	Was the cave
5550000	5552000	That was all spirally
5552000	5554000	That was kind of a pain in the butt
5554000	5556000	There was also the water dungeon or the ice dungeon
5556000	5558000	And Zelda is notorious for having ice dungeons
5558000	5560000	Where you're like, fuck
5560000	5562000	The water dungeon was actually really fun to me
5562000	5564000	But it was also probably one of the only levels in that game
5564000	5566000	That made me actually sick
5566000	5568000	So yeah, Ocarina of Time
5568000	5570000	Alright
5570000	5572000	And I'll even say that to this day
5572000	5574000	The best way I like to play it
5574000	5576000	Is busting out the 64
5576000	5578000	Popping in that gold cartridge
5578000	5580000	I'm getting my link on
5580000	5582000	Alright
5582000	5584000	There it is folks, your classic game of the week
5584000	5586000	Legend of Zelda
5586000	5588000	The Ocarina of Time
5588000	5590000	One of the true true classes
5590000	5592000	Considered by some to be the greatest game of all time
5592000	5594000	So there you go
5594000	5596000	The Guinness Book of World Records said something about it
5596000	5598000	Alright
5598000	5600000	We got plenty more Orange Launch Radio to come
5600000	5602000	After a quick break
5602000	5604000	We're going to do some rapid fire news of course
5604000	5606000	We're going to talk about some of the game recording stuff
5606000	5608000	For Xbox One and PlayStation 4
5608000	5610000	Little clarifications coming out on that this week
5610000	5612000	And Nintendo fighting piracy
5612000	5614000	Yet again we'll talk more about that
5614000	5616000	And some rumors about the PlayStation Vita
5616000	5618000	That's right, the Vita, it's not gone
5618000	5620000	So we got news on all of that
5620000	5622000	When we come back after a quick break with more
5622000	5624000	Of Orange Lounge Radio
5630000	5632000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio
5632000	5634000	Episode number 515
5634000	5636000	Already in progress
5636000	5638000	Tonight is August 11th of 2013
5638000	5640000	And having a pretty busy show here
5640000	5642000	Back after a week off of course
5642000	5644000	We weren't here last week unfortunately
5644000	5646000	But getting back in full swing
5646000	5648000	Talking about games such as Hotline Miami
5648000	5650000	Which the live listeners heard a couple tracks from the
5650000	5652000	Soundtrack
5652000	5654000	I like that, I hadn't heard any of the music yet
5654000	5656000	I like the second song a lot more than the first
5656000	5658000	But that was really good
5658000	5660000	I like that
5660000	5662000	Good choice Alan
5662000	5664000	Alright
5664000	5666000	Before we get into some rapid fire news
5666000	5668000	I just kind of wanted to plug a couple appearances
5668000	5670000	On other podcasts because I've kind of been on a roll lately
5670000	5672000	I don't know what it's about but
5672000	5674000	I will take it because I love
5674000	5676000	Guesting on other shows and supporting
5676000	5678000	Independent broadcasting and podcasting
5678000	5680000	In general so I just wanted to throw out a couple
5680000	5682000	Plugs
5682000	5684000	One of them is a new project for our friends over
5684000	5686000	At popcolts.com
5686000	5688000	You remember Tiara
5688000	5690000	And you might know Dan Shadow, I think they've both been on the show
5690000	5692000	At one point or another and some other friends
5692000	5694000	All did this thing called Order of the Chocobo
5694000	5696000	Which was a Google hangout, it was actually a video thing
5696000	5698000	That was fun, we had to make
5698000	5700000	A list, it was kind of like listless
5700000	5702000	But not really, making the definitive
5702000	5704000	List of the top 10 Final Fantasy
5704000	5706000	Characters
5706000	5708000	I was very humbled by what a civil discussion it was
5708000	5710000	I was expecting hair pulling
5710000	5712000	And chair throwing and I was very happy
5712000	5714000	With the way the list turned out so check that out
5714000	5716000	Popcolts.com has the archive of that available
5716000	5718000	Also just today
5718000	5720000	I taped a spot for a podcast
5720000	5722000	Called Game On
5722000	5724000	Epic Slam Press Edition and that's a part of
5724000	5726000	MMORPG.com
5726000	5728000	Real quick show, it's only about 30-45 minutes
5728000	5730000	But they were kind enough to have me on today
5730000	5732000	Good guys over there so I believe
5732000	5734000	That will be up on Monday so check that out
5734000	5736000	I get to talk a bit about Final Fantasy 14
5736000	5738000	And you guys all know I have the other show Horde House
5738000	5740000	So I got to speak a little bit about some MMOs
5740000	5742000	They were talking about Rift and some of the other changes
5742000	5744000	Going on at Triumph so that was pretty exciting
5744000	5746000	I guess I should give another
5746000	5748000	Plug because I don't know if I remembered it to mention it
5748000	5750000	Two weeks ago but on the last
5750000	5752000	Gamebuoy.org show
5752000	5754000	Which was about music games
5754000	5756000	I was on that show and that's up on their feed now
5756000	5758000	And it might be getting
5758000	5760000	Bumped by the time you hear this by their
5760000	5762000	Most recent show they did today
5762000	5764000	Which I think they did about GamerX
5764000	5766000	But look for the show on their feed about music games
5766000	5768000	We had a great time, it was like a three hour show
5768000	5770000	So it would have been a great way to fill
5770000	5772000	The time last week with no OLR
5772000	5774000	So check that out
5774000	5776000	I'm having fun guessing on other podcasts
5776000	5778000	I'm always happy to guest on other shows
5778000	5780000	I know Loki and Dark Sakura also willing as well
5780000	5782000	Be sure to hit us all up on Twitter
5782000	5784000	If you want to know our individual Twitter accounts
5784000	5786000	Best way to get ahold of me on Twitter
5786000	5788000	Twitter.com slash S-K-I-E
5788000	5790000	That's Skye but S-K-I-E

5810000	5812000	I was going to say the tumbles
5812000	5814000	I tumble a lot more
5814000	5816000	It's Kurotsubasa
5816000	5818000	K-U-R-O-U-T-S-U-B-A-S-A
5818000	5820000	Just think Blackwing

5822000	5824000	The Twitter I will eventually see it
5824000	5826000	And Loki, I don't know what's the best way
5826000	5828000	For them to get you, Twitter?
5828000	5830000	Twitter is fine
5830000	5832000	K-U-R-O-U-T-S-U-B-A-S-A
5832000	5834000	Twitter is fine
5834000	5836000	Alright, well let's get into some
5836000	5838000	Rapid fire news and talk about what else
5838000	5840000	Is going on in the gaming world this week
5840000	5842000	Loki, why don't you start us off
5842000	5844000	This isn't the first time games tried something like this
5844000	5846000	Where they put up a really expensive
5846000	5848000	Ridiculous bundle for
5848000	5850000	An upcoming game, I think they did something like that
5850000	5852000	For Formula One
5852000	5854000	I think it was Formula One 2012
5854000	5856000	Where they actually had a Formula One
5856000	5858000	Car as part of the bundle
5858000	5860000	But this is the Saints Row IV
5860000	5862000	The super dangerous
5862000	5864000	WOD WOD edition
5864000	5866000	AKA the million dollar pack
5866000	5868000	It is exactly one million dollars
5868000	5870000	There is only one available
5870000	5872000	And it includes the following
5872000	5874000	Saints Row IV, the Commander in Chief edition
5874000	5876000	A Virgin Galactic space flight
5876000	5878000	A full size replica of the dubstep gun
5878000	5880000	A hostage rescue experience
5880000	5882000	Plastic surgery
5882000	5884000	Spy training day
5884000	5886000	A personal shopper
5886000	5888000	A capsule wardrobe
5888000	5890000	From all the Saints Row stuff
5890000	5892000	Seven nights at the top
5892000	5894000	Royale suite
5894000	5896000	In Dubai
5896000	5898000	And a partridge in a pear tree
5898000	5900000	A week for two at the Jefferson Hotel
5900000	5902000	In Washington D.C.
5902000	5904000	A first class flight to Washington D.C.
5904000	5906000	In Dubai
5906000	5908000	Lamborghini
5908000	5910000	A new Toyota Prius Plus
5910000	5912000	A year's insurance
5912000	5914000	And a year's supercar membership
5914000	5916000	One million dollars
5916000	5918000	Which apparently is not a very good deal
5918000	5920000	But my thing is though
5920000	5922000	It's one million dollars
5922000	5924000	And they couldn't even bother to
5924000	5926000	Throw in the season pass DLC
5926000	5928000	I mean really
5928000	5930000	This reminds me of how
5930000	5932000	Like in WoW there are players with
5932000	5934000	Phenomenal amounts of money
5934000	5936000	That they didn't buy from a gold farmer
5936000	5938000	That they just have in every expansion
5938000	5940000	Blizzard has to put in some mount
5940000	5942000	Or some treasure thing that costs like
5942000	5944000	Gold for like the alchemy mount
5944000	5946000	You have too much gold
5946000	5948000	Make this thing
5948000	5950000	That's what this is but in real life
5950000	5952000	You have too much money
5952000	5954000	Here's a money sink for you
5954000	5956000	Just reminded me of what I should have done
5956000	5958000	In WoW before I left
5958000	5960000	That was by the Time Dragon thing
5960000	5962000	I think this is one of those stupid things
5962000	5964000	That generates blog headlines
5964000	5966000	Across the internet and oh look
5966000	5968000	It worked
5968000	5970000	Whatever
5970000	5972000	You know what if I had a million dollars
5972000	5974000	You know what I would do
5974000	5976000	I would just buy the Bugatti and leave it alone
5976000	5978000	Honestly though it's not really worth it
5978000	5980000	I think they've had a few sites that have actually
5980000	5982000	Broken down cost wise
5982000	5984000	And it ends up being about $600,000 worth of product
5984000	5986000	So you're kind of overspending
5986000	5988000	But if you have a million dollars to drop on a game
5988000	5990000	Then you probably don't give a shit about money
5990000	5992000	And you know
5992000	5994000	Bill Gates I'm looking at you come on you're a
5994000	5996000	Real fan right? Honestly if I had a million dollars
5996000	5998000	I'd buy a house
5998000	6000000	And pay my bills
6000000	6002000	But if you had so much money
6002000	6004000	Like millions of dollars
6004000	6006000	This is for the 1%
6006000	6008000	If I magically became the 1%
6008000	6010000	I think my brain would explode
6010000	6012000	I would know what to do
6012000	6014000	If you're so rich you have no idea how much money
6014000	6016000	Exactly you have because the stock market
6016000	6018000	Fluctuates so much each day then this is for you
6018000	6020000	When you're so rich you don't know how much money you have
6020000	6022000	If I had a million dollars I'd invest
6022000	6024000	And make a million more
6024000	6026000	Just saying
6026000	6028000	If I had just one million dollars I'm not going to buy
6028000	6030000	A fucking game with it I mean that's stupid
6030000	6032000	If I had lots and lots of money
6032000	6034000	Like billions of dollars
6034000	6036000	Then yes I would drop a million dollars on a fucking game
6036000	6038000	Because no one thought that they would purchase it
6038000	6040000	And I'd be like ha I fucking purchased it
6040000	6042000	Next story
6042000	6044000	So this is kind of cool news
6044000	6046000	For the Oculus Rift
6046000	6048000	They're actually
6048000	6050000	They have a new
6050000	6052000	Chief Technical Officer
6052000	6054000	And that's coming from
6054000	6056000	John Carmack
6056000	6058000	The co-founder of id
6058000	6060000	Of course big fan of VR
6060000	6062000	And now
6062000	6064000	Going to be a part of the team to make the Oculus Rift
6064000	6066000	Awesome
6066000	6068000	So neat
6068000	6070000	We'll have to see what that comes
6070000	6072000	What's going to come out of that
6072000	6074000	And then last but not least
6074000	6076000	The thing that's been kind of taking up a few days
6076000	6078000	Of my time at least not entirely
6078000	6080000	It's this website called Salty Bet
6080000	6082000	It's really
6082000	6084000	I don't know it's kind of funny
6084000	6086000	It's basically a website
6086000	6088000	That you go and you sign up
6088000	6090000	And you get fake money
6090000	6092000	You bet on PC
6092000	6094000	Controlled Mugen fights
6094000	6096000	And for those that don't know what Mugen is
6096000	6098000	It is a basically create your own
6098000	6100000	Fighting game type thing
6100000	6102000	And so there's characters from Street Fighter
6102000	6104000	From all the different fighting series
6104000	6106000	You can possibly imagine and a bunch of other made up stuff
6106000	6108000	So you get like
6108000	6110000	For example in this screenshot here
6110000	6112000	It's the same battle between Popeye and Ash
6112000	6114000	From the Evil Dead versus
6114000	6116000	Duck Dodgers
6116000	6118000	And Spawn
6118000	6120000	Just like weird shit like that
6120000	6122000	If it's a character that had a sprite made of it
6122000	6124000	During the Genesis slash SNES
6124000	6126000	Era then that sprite has probably been
6126000	6128000	Imported into Mugen and made a character
6128000	6130000	I watched a fight that took place versus
6130000	6132000	A Dragon Ball Z character and
6132000	6134000	Fat Albert
6134000	6136000	Hey hey hey
6136000	6138000	I watched one earlier today
6138000	6140000	Popeye versus some other random
6140000	6142000	Street Fighter character and Pop
6142000	6144000	Not Popeye, Ronald McDonald
6144000	6146000	Versus some random Street Fighter character
6146000	6148000	Piccolo
6148000	6150000	And Ronald McDonald just kicked the shit out of
6150000	6152000	Piccolo
6152000	6154000	Because he's such an overpowered character that
6154000	6156000	Someone created because they're like
6156000	6158000	Ronald McDonald is a fighting character
6158000	6160000	But yeah it's kind of fun
6160000	6162000	Saltybet.com
6162000	6164000	You sign up you get 400 fake dollars
6164000	6166000	And then you go and you bet
6166000	6168000	I want to watch a Daisy
6168000	6170000	Fight for that hidden eye
6170000	6172000	Eye beam attack that Mugen
6172000	6174000	Daisy has
6174000	6176000	From Mario Kart
6176000	6178000	I'd have to
6178000	6180000	I'd have to see that but yeah it's funny
6180000	6182000	And they've got like it's just this
6182000	6184000	Twitch stream that they have and
6184000	6186000	You bet stuff and you can even they have a
6186000	6188000	Chat window and stuff on there you can
6188000	6190000	Check stuff out but like there's like people with a ton
6190000	6192000	Of money like I'm like how many fucking hours are you
6192000	6194000	Spending on this thing? It's ridiculous
6194000	6196000	And I always bet on the losers
6196000	6198000	Apparently because it's like
6198000	6200000	How do you pick you know who's gonna win
6200000	6202000	Between like some
6202000	6204000	Random anime chick and this
6204000	6206000	This weird screen cap of a
6206000	6208000	Football or you know a soccer player
6208000	6210000	Or something like that it's conversations you had
6210000	6212000	When you were 10 I bet
6212000	6214000	That Superman would lose a fight against that one
6214000	6216000	Battletoad like I mean that's what
6216000	6218000	Mugen is basically once I tried
6218000	6220000	To like find Mugen and install it
6220000	6222000	And get some character packs I couldn't figure
6222000	6224000	Out where the hell this thing is like it's buried
6224000	6226000	On some Japanese forum somewhere I just
6226000	6228000	Tried to Google download Mugen play
6228000	6230000	Mugen for example I'm gonna tell you something
6230000	6232000	I have a disc from 7 years ago
6232000	6234000	A CD from 7 years ago that has an
6234000	6236000	Install of Mugen on it I don't know who these
6236000	6238000	Characters I mean I know who one of these characters
6238000	6240000	Is but I don't know who both these characters is but right now
6240000	6242000	Are you salty betting during the show?
6242000	6244000	No right now they have it's it's Fox
6244000	6246000	McCloud versus Hawkage I guess
6246000	6248000	He's from looks like Naruto
6248000	6249200	Um so
6249200	6250000	Hakage?
6250000	6252000	Hakage I guess yes I can't I can't
6252000	6254000	Fucking read Japanese today
6254000	6256000	Hakage so it's Fox McCloud versus
6256000	6258000	Hakage and Fox McCloud yes Fox McCloud
6258000	6260000	Is definitely favored
6260000	6262000	To win so but uh yeah
6262000	6264000	Just an example of some of the matchups you see
6264000	6266000	Right there I don't know I had it on the other
6266000	6268000	Day while I was doing other things and they thought
6268000	6270000	It was funny all right let's move
6270000	6272000	On now earlier in the show
6272000	6274000	I was yelled out
6274000	6276000	Yelled at in private message by
6276000	6278000	My good pal Shane Alinko
6278000	6280000	When I said that I was most
6280000	6282000	Looking forward to on the 3DS the
6282000	6284000	Link Between Two Worlds
6284000	6286000	Zelda remake because he said how dare you
6286000	6288000	Pokemon X and Y still isn't out
6288000	6290000	So fine here you go Shane
6290000	6292000	Here's a Pokemon X and Y story
6292000	6294000	For me to butcher and it's
6294000	6296000	About something you were expressing to me earlier this week
6296000	6298000	Mega Evolutions
6298000	6300000	That's right the Pokemon company
6300000	6302000	Unveiled more information
6302000	6304000	On Mega Evolutions
6304000	6306000	Such as Mewtwo
6306000	6308000	Can undergo this change during battle
6308000	6310000	But the effects would only last for the duration of the battle
6310000	6312000	In order for this to happen
6312000	6314000	Pokemon has to hold a mega stone
6314000	6316000	Item but there are
6316000	6318000	Different ones unique to different creatures
6318000	6320000	In order to get these abilities
6320000	6322000	There were also new screens and there was a new
6322000	6324000	Trailer that was released for this
6324000	6326000	That talks about how to use this
6326000	6328000	What is this super training is also
6328000	6330000	A thing where you can increase a Pokemon's
6330000	6332000	Base stats by playing mini games
6332000	6334000	Such as a soccer style game
6334000	6336000	And core training workouts as well
6336000	6338000	That will allow your Pokemon to slowly improve
6338000	6340000	Their stats on their own
6340000	6342000	I want to hear more about the fashion shoots and all that
6342000	6344000	Kind of crap that they're going to have in the game
6344000	6346000	And when this story was announced all of the
6346000	6348000	Pokemon theory crafters and min-maxers
6348000	6350000	Simultaneously got a boner and an aneurysm
6350000	6352000	Act Deaf
6352000	6354000	Says Digimon will sue
6354000	6356000	Pokemon min-maxers
6356000	6358000	Are crazy
6358000	6360000	It's one of the reasons I can't
6360000	6362000	Get into Pokemon as much as some
6362000	6364000	People like Shane is that there's
6364000	6366000	There's too fucking much
6366000	6368000	Like it's just like oh my god
6368000	6370000	It's like I gotta do this and then I gotta get these
6370000	6372000	Items and I gotta min-max this and I gotta do
6372000	6374000	A fucking fashion shoot on the side like
6374000	6376000	God damn
6376000	6378000	You know what? I was fine with
6378000	6380000	151 Pokemon
6380000	6382000	I was fine with taking their pictures in Snap
6382000	6384000	Yeah that was fun
6384000	6386000	The rest of this shit is too much
6386000	6388000	You know okay I did get some free plushies
6388000	6390000	At E3 which I gave to Julie
6390000	6392000	But you know what?
6392000	6394000	Shane does have a career
6394000	6396000	The new bunny Pokemon is super cute by the way
6396000	6398000	He's super derpy and I love it
6398000	6400000	I wanna see the derpiness
6400000	6402000	Although I do like when people do
6402000	6404000	Memes with the old
6404000	6406000	That looks like a derp
6406000	6408000	Isn't he adorable though?
6408000	6410000	What is up with those ears?
6410000	6412000	He's kind of like the
6412000	6414000	What's the one they have all the memes about?
6414000	6416000	Psyduck?
6416000	6418000	The beaver
6418000	6420000	The beaver looking one
6420000	6422000	Bidoof
6422000	6424000	Squirtle help I'm on fire
6424000	6426000	LOL Bidoof
6426000	6428000	Squirtle I'm dying
6428000	6430000	I haven't seen this
6430000	6432000	Alright
6432000	6434000	I just like the Diglett memes
6434000	6436000	Far too much Pokemon content for one show
6436000	6438000	Shut it down
6438000	6440000	Hearthstone is Blizzard's free to play
6440000	6442000	Card game
6442000	6444000	It's gonna be in beta soon
6444000	6446000	And they're saying it's not really
6446000	6448000	But it's not far away either
6448000	6450000	I'm not sure what the hell that's supposed to mean
6450000	6452000	But they're saying here's the quote about it
6452000	6454000	We're not days away from launching
6454000	6456000	The beta but we're not months away
6456000	6458000	Either
6458000	6460000	At the Hearthstone announcement we committed into going to beta testing
6460000	6462000	Before the summer was over
6462000	6464000	And the team has been pulling out all the stops to make that happen
6464000	6466000	Well if you think about it summer isn't really over
6466000	6468000	Until September 21st
6468000	6470000	So there's still a little bit of time
6470000	6472000	But one can hope it will be there
6472000	6474000	Before the end of August
6474000	6476000	For Saints Row 4
6476000	6478000	Even I'm excited about this game honestly
6478000	6480000	I gotta get it at some point
6480000	6482000	The soundtrack list has been revealed
6482000	6484000	109 tracks in this game
6484000	6486000	Good lord
6486000	6488000	I am not gonna read all 109 songs
6488000	6490000	Off of this list
6490000	6492000	But I will just point out
6492000	6494000	Especially because there's a lot of classical songs
6494000	6496000	Since they have the classical station
6496000	6498000	But I will point out I was very excited to see
6498000	6500000	Hadaway What Is Love is in the game
6500000	6502000	And apparently it's one of those songs that's used at a key moment
6502000	6504000	Opposites Attract
6504000	6506000	Do the safety dance
6506000	6508000	Montel Jordan
6508000	6510000	This is how we do it
6510000	6512000	I just laughed because Oh Shit is in it
6512000	6514000	Lump by Pussa
6514000	6516000	Oh Shit is in it
6516000	6518000	Obviously the mix station is gonna be the best
6518000	6520000	Saints Row 4 soundtrack
6520000	6522000	More information there
6522000	6524000	DarkSakura
6524000	6526000	What do you got?
6526000	6528000	Well I have some stuff
6528000	6530000	First of all there is a Tomb Raider
6530000	6532000	Sequel that has been confirmed
6532000	6534000	By the Square CEO
6534000	6536000	Well at least the American slash
6536000	6538000	European Phil Rogers
6538000	6540000	CEO
6540000	6542000	Basically they're also gonna be doing
6542000	6544000	A comic book that
6544000	6546000	Is a bridge between the games
6546000	6548000	And I knew about this because Gail Simone
6548000	6550000	Actually said something about it and you know I follow her Tumblr
6550000	6552000	She
6552000	6554000	Sorta let that slip early
6554000	6556000	So I'm looking forward to that
6556000	6558000	Cause I have liked what I've played so far
6558000	6560000	With Tomb Raider I just need to play more of it
6560000	6562000	Or as we call it here at OLR
6562000	6564000	Girl
6564000	6566000	Lara Croft's
6566000	6568000	Incredible no good
6568000	6570000	Very bad day
6570000	6572000	Whatever that book was called
6572000	6574000	And then there is a fan
6574000	6576000	Petition out for Smash Brothers
6576000	6578000	And they want to make
6578000	6580000	Reggie Fils-Aime a playable character
6580000	6582000	Yep you can sign
6582000	6584000	The Nintendo and that he
6584000	6586000	Uses Nintendo controllers and characters
6586000	6588000	To his advantage as attacks
6588000	6590000	And
6590000	6592000	They are basically
6592000	6594000	Encouraging Twitter users to
6594000	6596000	Basically message Masahiro Sakurai
6596000	6598000	To
6598000	6600000	Have Reggie in the game
6600000	6602000	I think that would be awesome
6602000	6604000	He has to have
6604000	6606000	You remember Norimaro in
6606000	6608000	Marvel Super Heroes
6608000	6610000	He was the Japanese
6610000	6612000	He was only the Japanese version
6612000	6614000	The comedian who was wearing the boys uniform
6614000	6616000	He could do a version like that for Reggie
6616000	6618000	With the big head that's like super
6618000	6620000	Exaggerated features and everything
6620000	6622000	His jaw should be an attack
6622000	6624000	I kind of agree with Fifth Dream in our chat room
6624000	6626000	At live.vognetwork.com
6626000	6628000	LOL fan petition
6628000	6630000	Yeah but it would be funny
6630000	6632000	And weirder things have happened
6632000	6634000	By the way Tekken X Street Fighter
6634000	6636000	Is still in development
6636000	6638000	They haven't given up and it should be
6638000	6640000	Better than Street Fighter X Tekken
6640000	6642000	Was
6642000	6644000	I hate this way
6644000	6646000	These stupid
6646000	6648000	Well let me say this from Stan in our chat room
6648000	6650000	Because I like this comment too
6650000	6652000	I thought Stan Lee would have been cool in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3
6652000	6654000	Yes
6654000	6656000	Yes
6656000	6658000	So they're looking though
6658000	6660000	With this to build a bigger community
6660000	6662000	For the fighting game fans
6662000	6664000	By combining not just putting the Tekken fans
6664000	6666000	And the Street Fighter fans together
6666000	6668000	But really making it one big whole community
6668000	6670000	So we'll see
6670000	6672000	If it's better than the Capcom attempt
6672000	6674000	Then I'll be happy
6674000	6676000	Ta-da
6676000	6678000	Alright there it is your rapid fire news
6678000	6680000	Let's get to the foogle question of the week
6688000	6690000	Every week we ask a question of our Facebook
6690000	6692000	And Google Plus communities
6692000	6694000	But this week was a little different
6694000	6696000	Because unfortunately due to some of the other podcasts
6696000	6698000	I was doing and being sick
6698000	6700000	And having to get Jamie tonight
6700000	6702000	Because she's without a car
6702000	6704000	My battery died
6704000	6706000	I was not able to prep the show in a timely manner
6706000	6708000	So I was like alright well we're not going to have enough time
6708000	6710000	To get decent replies tonight
6710000	6712000	So let's mix it up a little bit
6712000	6714000	And do a segment instead
6714000	6716000	That we have not done on Orange Lounge Radio
6716000	6718000	In a very very long time
6718000	6720000	It's a segment we call
6720000	6722000	Ask Orange Lounge
6722000	6724000	God
6724000	6726000	Let's ask Orange Lounge
6726000	6728000	Some stupid question
6728000	6730000	What will we find out this week
6730000	6732000	On Orange Lounge Radio
6732000	6734000	I bet a lot of people
6734000	6736000	Didn't know I usually sing the theme
6736000	6738000	And now they're happy that we don't do this segment
6738000	6740000	A lot anymore
6740000	6742000	Made up every time
6742000	6744000	Can you believe it? I'm a regular Wayne Brady over here
6744000	6746000	Alright let's start with
6746000	6748000	Facebook
6748000	6750000	Red the Haze starts us off tonight
6750000	6752000	What is a man?
6752000	6754000	A miserable little pile of secrets
6754000	6756000	Weren't you paying attention?
6756000	6758000	Yes
6758000	6760000	Rob himself says
6760000	6762000	Why is there no Loki and Dan show?
6762000	6764000	That would be epic
6764000	6766000	Why isn't there a Loki and Dan show?
6766000	6768000	You guys should just look at each other and yell for an hour
6768000	6770000	It'll be fun
6770000	6772000	I would leave the house
6772000	6774000	You wouldn't see me while the whole thing was going on
6774000	6776000	We wouldn't yell at each other we'd probably agree a lot
6776000	6778000	Actually yell in unison
6778000	6780000	It would be the two dudes up in the balcony from the Muppet show
6780000	6782000	That would be awesome
6782000	6784000	That would be awesome
6784000	6786000	You need to channel that
6786000	6788000	I'm going to make the suggestion to Dan then
6788000	6790000	That you do the Grumpy Guy show
6790000	6792000	Alright, Jose Osumu-Rigaro wants to know
6792000	6794000	What's the one game you thought you wouldn't enjoy
6794000	6796000	But you ended up loving
6796000	6798000	I only asked because I thought I wasn't going to enjoy
6798000	6800000	Hitman Absolution nearly as much as I am
6800000	6802000	The one game you thought you wouldn't enjoy
6802000	6804000	But you ended up loving
6804000	6806000	Easy for me, Mass Effect
6806000	6808000	I'd have to say
6808000	6810000	That was one for me too
6810000	6812000	And Borderlands 2 actually
6812000	6814000	I like it
6814000	6816000	Alan, anything you can think of?
6816000	6818000	I'm blanking, I'm sorry
6818000	6820000	That's alright, Loki, anything?
6820000	6822000	Minecraft
6822000	6824000	Ronnie B says if you could design your own game for the Oculus Rift
6824000	6826000	What would it be like?
6826000	6828000	It would be like F-Zero
6832000	6834000	If I had to do one
6834000	6836000	It would be
6836000	6838000	It would be
6838000	6840000	I don't know
6840000	6842000	I was going to try to think of something really pervy
6842000	6844000	to say
6844000	6846000	It would be like Superhero Dress Up
6846000	6848000	There's plenty of perv content already on Oculus Rift
6848000	6850000	Anybody else? Alan?
6850000	6852000	A game like Rez
6852000	6854000	What was that Fireworks game that was a launch game for the PS2?
6854000	6856000	Phantom Vision
6856000	6858000	Something like that
6858000	6860000	Phantom Vision is a fun game
6860000	6862000	Pretty rave
6862000	6864000	Drug induced game on the Oculus Rift
6864000	6866000	Ragenator says
6866000	6868000	Train A is traveling south
6868000	6870000	from Butte, Montana at 78 miles an hour
6870000	6872000	Train B is traveling east to Pax East
6872000	6874000	with Cliffy B as a passenger
6874000	6876000	How much bacon can Loki eat in one sitting
6876000	6878000	without getting explosive bacon grease diarrhea?
6878000	6880000	That's disgusting
6880000	6882000	He's not doing that in our apartment
6882000	6884000	I don't
6884000	6886000	get explosive diarrhea from bacon
6886000	6888000	It just ends up getting so heavy
6888000	6890000	It depends on how hungry I am
6890000	6892000	And how crispy the bacon is
6892000	6894000	That is what it comes down to
6894000	6896000	How crispy the bacon is
6896000	6898000	If it's all fatty and greasy
6898000	6900000	You can't eat very much of it
6900000	6902000	If it's really crispy then you can eat a ton of it
6902000	6904000	If it's not very crispy that means it's well lubricated
6904000	6906000	You guys are disgusting
6906000	6908000	We didn't ask the question
6908000	6910000	That's true
6910000	6912000	It's Ragenator's fault
6912000	6914000	Ragenator you're banned
6914000	6916000	Get something to slap him with in the chat room
6916000	6918000	I apologize for the Facebook noises
6918000	6920000	I still haven't disabled it
6921000	6923000	Bobby Blackwolf
6923000	6925000	Asking the heavy hitting question here
6925000	6927000	With all of the heavy topics
6927000	6929000	That are discussed on OLR throughout the years
6929000	6931000	There are many questions that one could ask
6931000	6933000	The Lounge of Orange
6933000	6935000	Some are philosophical, some are personal
6935000	6937000	Others are about the best ways to roast a ferret
6937000	6939000	However there is one question
6939000	6941000	And one question only
6941000	6943000	That dictates the future of gaming
6943000	6945000	And the revelry of gaming's past
6945000	6947000	Why the beep can you not accept
6947000	6949000	That Chrono Trigger and Earthbound are better
6949000	6951000	Than Super Metroid
6951000	6953000	Because you're wrong
6953000	6955000	What is actually a rhetorical question
6955000	6957000	Because the only acceptable answer is
6957000	6959000	You speak the truth Bobby
6959000	6961000	And now I accept your conclusion as fact
6961000	6963000	It has been written on the internet
6963000	6965000	And lo it is true
6965000	6967000	Well
6967000	6969000	First of all it's pronounced gif
6969000	6971000	Second of all no
6971000	6973000	I've actually prepared an answer
6973000	6975000	Oh really
6975000	6977000	For this
6977000	6979000	So here's my answer
6979000	6981000	Drum roll please
6981000	6983000	One more please
6983000	6985000	Because fuck you
6985000	6987000	That's why
6987000	6989000	Thank you and good night
6989000	6991000	Do do do do do do do
6991000	6993000	No I just
6993000	6995000	Okay look
6995000	6997000	There's something about the fact
6997000	6999000	That Super Metroid is something that you can
6999000	7001000	Play in like you know one sitting
7001000	7003000	And really kind of do like the speed runs
7003000	7005000	And collect all the items
7005000	7007000	I love the music in Super Metroid
7007000	7009000	And I don't know
7009000	7011000	How to put my finger on it
7011000	7013000	I just fucking love that game
7013000	7015000	And really they don't make Metroid games like it anymore
7015000	7017000	It's just
7017000	7019000	But they do make Castlevania games like it
7019000	7021000	They do they do
7021000	7023000	And I don't hate Chrono Trigger
7023000	7025000	And I especially don't hate Earthbound
7025000	7027000	In fact I got Earthbound on Wii U Virtual Console
7027000	7029000	And it's fun
7029000	7031000	You know what I found the other day?
7031000	7033000	Earthbound the cartridge
7033000	7035000	Dan and I were actually playing through Super Mario World
7035000	7037000	I asked the other game I forgot to say it was playing
7037000	7039000	Was to cheer me up Dan and I
7039000	7041000	Drank wine and played Super Mario World
7041000	7043000	Alright three hour show and look how many questions I gotta get through
7043000	7045000	Alright
7045000	7047000	Tim Tripp wants to know why not Zoidberg?
7049000	7051000	What?
7051000	7053000	Why not Zoidberg? You're laughing over there Logan
7053000	7055000	Is that Futurama?
7055000	7057000	Because he sheds his skin
7057000	7059000	And he's gross
7059000	7061000	That show got cancelled anyway
7061000	7063000	Didn't it?
7063000	7065000	It got cancelled again
7065000	7067000	Stan H wants to know if you were in a Final Fantasy game
7067000	7069000	What would be your job class?
7071000	7073000	I want to do a summoner because I want to summon
7073000	7075000	Cute little creatures to do my bidding
7075000	7077000	I'd be Realm
7077000	7079000	Where I would draw everything that I want into existence
7079000	7081000	And have them beat the shit out of everybody
7081000	7083000	Here's a horde of cute ponies
7083000	7085000	Stop
7085000	7087000	Alan?
7087000	7089000	I'd be Sebastian because he was super hot and built
7089000	7091000	I liked, I don't remember what the class was
7091000	7093000	In Final Fantasy 6
7093000	7095000	It was Edgar, I think he was like an engineer
7095000	7097000	Or something like that, because he had a fucking chainsaw
7097000	7099000	And that's awesome
7099000	7101000	And he had a railgun
7101000	7103000	Jeremy, our buddy from Koopa Club wants to know
7103000	7105000	Do you even lift?
7105000	7107000	No
7107000	7109000	How much can you bench DarkSakura?
7109000	7111000	Who's raising her hand?
7111000	7113000	I actually don't bench, I do deadlifts
7113000	7115000	And I'm up to 60 pounds now
7115000	7117000	Wow
7117000	7119000	That doesn't mean anything
7119000	7121000	It's 2013
7121000	7123000	Well I mean, but for the most part
7123000	7125000	For any
7125000	7127000	For people who don't know, I actually
7127000	7129000	Am working into powerlifting because I can't do heavy
7129000	7131000	Cardio because of bad joints
7131000	7133000	God damn it, Codeman, stop setting off my Facebook
7133000	7135000	But I actually
7135000	7137000	Do deadlifts and
7137000	7139000	I'm going to be starting bench pressing and doing
7139000	7141000	Other powerlifting, so that was a good question
7141000	7143000	I do live lifts
7143000	7145000	Like 30 pounds, or 35 pounds
7145000	7147000	Of live person that I lift up
7147000	7149000	On a daily basis
7149000	7151000	I'm going to lift this question and throw it out of the show
7151000	7153000	Alright, Renee
7153000	7155000	Also from Koopa Club wants to know
7155000	7157000	What's your favorite crepe?
7157000	7159000	Oh my god, those crepes at the
7159000	7161000	Cute little place in Japantown
7161000	7163000	There's this picture of me on Twitter
7163000	7165000	With a spike from Game Buoy
7165000	7167000	And look at the crepes
7167000	7169000	Zoom in on the crepes in that picture because they're adorable
7169000	7171000	They're crepes that are so cute you almost feel bad
7171000	7173000	For wanting to eat it, but you eat it anyway
7173000	7175000	I will say though, as far as savory crepes go
7175000	7177000	There's a place here in Sacramento
7177000	7179000	Called Crepeville
7179000	7181000	They have this curry crepe that's really good
7181000	7183000	Danielle's crepes
7183000	7185000	In Sacramento, I was pointing out to you on the way here
7185000	7187000	Very, very good
7187000	7189000	Chicken crepes
7189000	7191000	Degenerate Johnny says, since Rob often asks
7191000	7193000	This question to every guest on OLR
7193000	7195000	I'd like to know your answers to the question
7195000	7197000	What is your favorite game of all time?
7197000	7199000	Note, if you can't immediately name one game
7199000	7201000	The closest thing would be your favorite game
7201000	7203000	As addressed earlier in this segment
7203000	7205000	Super Metroid
7205000	7207000	Guardian Legend
7207000	7209000	Valkyrie Profile
7209000	7211000	Grand Theft Auto V
7211000	7213000	Did you see the
7213000	7215000	How to basic video for how to install
7215000	7217000	Grand Theft Auto V?
7217000	7219000	Then I watched all of his
7219000	7221000	In fact, we were watching it at lunch
7221000	7223000	I was showing my son
7223000	7225000	Those videos and he's like
7225000	7227000	What's he doing?
7227000	7229000	Alright
7229000	7231000	Fifth Dream says
7231000	7233000	For each member of the cast, if you could listen
7233000	7235000	To only one album
7235000	7237000	For the rest of your lives
7237000	7239000	What would you pick?
7239000	7241000	Ooh, this is hard
7241000	7243000	One album for the rest of your lives
7243000	7245000	What would you pick?
7245000	7247000	Anyone?
7247000	7249000	Okay, Loki? Well, just because I was listening to it
7249000	7251000	For about a couple months already
7251000	7253000	So, Onomatoguchi
7253000	7255000	Endless Fantasy
7255000	7257000	Okay
7257000	7259000	I'm not sure
7259000	7261000	I think I know how I want to answer this
7261000	7263000	But I'm not sure
7263000	7265000	Okay, it would be between
7265000	7267000	I can't narrow it down to one
7267000	7269000	It would be between Tragic Kingdom by No Doubt
7269000	7271000	Or
7271000	7273000	LCD Sound Systems
7273000	7275000	Actually, I think it's going to be
7275000	7277000	LCD Sound Systems' second album, Sound of Silver
7277000	7279000	That would be my album
7279000	7281000	Either it would be
7281000	7283000	Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill
7283000	7285000	Or Echo Image's CompuPhonic
7285000	7287000	No, ABBA?
7287000	7289000	ABBA Gold? ABBA Gold, I know
7289000	7291000	I know, but it's only one album
7291000	7293000	Only one
7293000	7295000	For me, I'd probably have to say Pearl Jam's 10
7295000	7297000	Because honestly, that is one of the few albums
7297000	7299000	I can listen to all the way through
7299000	7301000	Or maybe
7301000	7303000	God, what was that? Beatles album
7303000	7305000	Because now I can see it in my head
7305000	7307000	And I know the name of it
7307000	7309000	Revolver, Rubber Soul
7309000	7311000	Thank you
7311000	7313000	I knew it was one of the R ones
7313000	7315000	But I used to own
7315000	7317000	Actually, I do, again, own a copy of Rubber Soul
7317000	7319000	And it's my favorite Beatles album to this day
7319000	7321000	Those were the transitional albums where they went from
7321000	7323000	doing bubblegum pop to the really weird
7323000	7325000	metaphorical stuff
7325000	7327000	Rubber Soul and Revolver
7327000	7329000	both were such good albums
7329000	7331000	Now we have people in the chat room
7331000	7333000	giving their answers
7333000	7335000	I like Teto's answer, Throwing Copper
7335000	7337000	Metallica's Black Album was really good
7337000	7339000	Fifth Dream, The Cure with Wish
7339000	7341000	Ooh, another good one
7341000	7343000	You know what I would pick for an album?
7343000	7345000	My iTunes library
7345000	7347000	Depends how long I've been alive
7347000	7349000	I mean, if we're talking like, you know, I've been alive
7349000	7351000	for hundreds of years and probably Christmas speed
7351000	7353000	so I'd kill myself
7353000	7355000	Alright
7355000	7357000	Let's move on. Gamergirl says
7357000	7359000	If Animal Crossing New Leaf really
7359000	7361000	existed, what animal would you
7361000	7363000	be and why?
7363000	7365000	I wanna go last
7365000	7367000	I'd be human. Because I'm the main character
7367000	7369000	And I'm the fucking mayor
7369000	7371000	So fuck all of your
7371000	7373000	animals. I am not gonna be
7373000	7375000	a nice dog
7375000	7377000	like, um, what's his face in my
7377000	7379000	town. I'm gonna hit Ed
7379000	7381000	over the face with a bug net
7381000	7383000	kick that bitch out of my town
7383000	7385000	and run it for money
7385000	7387000	Alan, you be the gay unicorn
7391000	7393000	I'd be a
7393000	7395000	gazelle
7395000	7397000	Loki
7397000	7399000	Poacher
7399000	7401000	Which one's poacher?
7401000	7403000	A poacher
7403000	7405000	as in a hunter that kills the animals
7405000	7407000	No
7407000	7409000	Uh, and my answer is
7409000	7411000	I would be Tom Nook. Now give me my money
7411000	7413000	Fuck no, I have a gun
7413000	7415000	Alright
7415000	7417000	I'm glad none of us said
7417000	7419000	Sahara
7419000	7421000	Because Sahara really likes carpet
7421000	7423000	Is that the one
7423000	7425000	Is that the one that's like a boy in the
7425000	7427000	Japanese version? Gracie
7427000	7429000	I would be Gracie, let's be real
7429000	7431000	Sahara is the, uh, the wallpaper
7431000	7433000	and carpet merchant who comes
7433000	7435000	and redoes your house with the most god awful
7435000	7437000	ugly shit ever that you pay three thousand bills for
7437000	7439000	Alright, we got four more on Facebook to get through
7439000	7441000	here. Uh, DJ Melvis
7441000	7443000	our good pal says, it's you
7443000	7445000	versus the Grin Reaper in a
7445000	7447000	duel for your life. You must
7447000	7449000	choose three different games. One
7449000	7451000	8-bit console game, one 16-bit
7451000	7453000	console game, and one arcade game
7453000	7455000	open choice, to have a score
7455000	7457000	battle or timed run against
7457000	7459000	him. What you bring into the
7459000	7461000	duel? You gotta throw down with the
7461000	7463000	Grin Reaper an 8-bit game, a 16-bit
7463000	7465000	game, and an arcade game. What you
7465000	7467000	bring into the duel? Ooh, this
7467000	7469000	is a toughie. I know what my time run would be
7469000	7471000	Okay I would actually break it into Super Mario
7471000	7473000	Brothers, the very, the first one
7473000	7475000	I shouldn't say that about Mario 2 because
7475000	7477000	I'm really fast on speed runs for that game
7477000	7479000	My score one would actually
7479000	7481000	be Kirby's Avalanche
7481000	7483000	on Super Nintendo. Ooh, okay
7483000	7485000	My arcade one would probably be
7485000	7487000	the first Killer Instinct. Wow
7487000	7489000	I was really good at it. Dang, you didn't even
7489000	7491000	get prepped on that question in advance. Anybody
7491000	7493000	else want to take a stab at this? I don't even know
7493000	7495000	Anything that I was super awesome at when I was
7495000	7497000	like 12 I'm out of practice with so I'd be
7497000	7499000	screwed if that was the duel
7499000	7501000	Um,
7501000	7503000	gosh
7503000	7505000	Tetris
7505000	7507000	Uh, 8-bit game
7507000	7509000	I would pick
7509000	7511000	E.T. because I was actually fairly decent
7511000	7513000	at that. You're going way before 8-bits
7513000	7515000	That's like a 2-bit game
7515000	7517000	Tetris is your 8-bit game
7517000	7519000	Master System or
7519000	7521000	Tetris? Yeah
7521000	7523000	And then what's Super Nintendo?
7523000	7525000	I have lots of points
7525000	7527000	Um,
7527000	7529000	Kirby's
7529000	7531000	Superstar
7531000	7533000	I dominate that game, arcade game
7533000	7535000	Uh,
7535000	7537000	Klax
7537000	7539000	Alright, um
7539000	7541000	For me, arcade game, easy
7541000	7543000	DDR. Even though I'm not the best
7543000	7545000	at it, I can take on most people even in my old
7545000	7547000	age. Death does have to deal with those heavy robes
7547000	7549000	That's right, so uh, DDR, we're gonna throw down
7549000	7551000	in that. 8-bit game
7551000	7553000	Um, oh
7553000	7555000	god, uh, anticipation
7555000	7557000	And I get to be the heels
7557000	7559000	And uh, 16-bit
7559000	7561000	game
7561000	7563000	You know, you think I would say
7563000	7565000	Super Metroid, but I think I'm actually gonna go with
7565000	7567000	like, I'm gonna go with Tetris Attack
7567000	7569000	Because it was basically Pokemon Puzzle League and I was pretty good
7569000	7571000	at that. Loki. Uh
7571000	7573000	Dance Dance Revolution, Super Mario
7573000	7575000	Kart, and
7575000	7577000	8-bit
7577000	7579000	That's kinda tough
7579000	7581000	Um
7581000	7583000	Mario is missing
7583000	7585000	What did I play a lot, fuck I didn't even play that
7585000	7587000	What the fuck did I play a lot of
7587000	7589000	Um
7589000	7591000	Contra? No, that's still pretty
7591000	7593000	fucking hard. Sky Shark was fun
7593000	7595000	Um, have I done Sky Shark?
7595000	7597000	I don't think so
7597000	7599000	Look it up. I don't know, fuck
7599000	7601000	Duck Hunt, I don't know
7601000	7603000	That's hand-eye coordination
7603000	7605000	I should be really good at that, so
7605000	7607000	Alright, let's move on
7607000	7609000	Edgar R asks, which video game had
7609000	7611000	the worst ending?
7611000	7613000	Mass Effect 3, Mass Effect 3, Mass Effect 3
7613000	7615000	No, because they
7615000	7617000	actually fixed it and made it semi-decent
7617000	7619000	even if it wasn't great
7619000	7621000	Like, go back to like, you know
7621000	7623000	Ghouls and Ghosts, you know, where it was like
7623000	7625000	Congratulation
7625000	7627000	Or it was like Ghosts and Goblins, excuse me
7627000	7629000	Or, hey you win
7629000	7631000	you have to do it all again
7631000	7633000	Oh god, what games
7633000	7635000	had really crappy endings
7635000	7637000	Um
7637000	7639000	I don't know
7639000	7641000	I mean, unless there's like the ones where you die
7641000	7643000	at the end or some shit
7643000	7645000	Super controversial
7645000	7647000	Final Fantasy 7, because shit
7647000	7649000	was not finished
7649000	7651000	If Final Fantasy 7 had come out in the age of
7651000	7653000	the internet, it would have been a Mass Effect 3
7653000	7655000	debacle, it really would have
7655000	7657000	I probably would actually say the
7657000	7659000	original state of endings for Mass Effect 3
7659000	7661000	I did go back and watch them
7661000	7663000	I'm very glad I
7663000	7665000	waited to beat the games when the extended
7665000	7667000	cut came out
7667000	7669000	Although, I do have to say that I really
7669000	7671000	hate that
7671000	7673000	Happy Ending mod, it just is not good
7673000	7675000	Oh no, no
7675000	7677000	It doesn't even suit it
7677000	7679000	Alright, Jon R says
7679000	7681000	Chrono Trigger greater than Metroid less than
7681000	7683000	Secret of Evermore, why fight it Rob
7683000	7685000	we're all right, even Bobby for once
7685000	7691000	The only reason I read that and entertained it was the for once part, because teehee
7691000	7693000	Alright, Dartetsuya asks
7693000	7695000	Remember OLR presents
7695000	7697000	The Hunt, based on Loki's
7697000	7699000	favorite novel, Ready Player One
7699000	7701000	Can we find a way to do that again?
7701000	7703000	Maybe expand it beyond classic games to include
7703000	7705000	more geeky stuff so more of our VOG peeps
7705000	7707000	can participate, that was kind of like
7707000	7709000	a relay race type of thing
7709000	7711000	using classic games, right?
7711000	7713000	Some modern games, yeah it would be fun to do again
7713000	7715000	It would be really cool if we could, you know, because
7715000	7717000	our website VOG Network is a social game after all
7717000	7719000	Not to volunteer Bobby for projects
7719000	7721000	because I know he's got his plate full already
7721000	7723000	but maybe in 2014 that could be some
7723000	7725000	type of thing we look at doing
7725000	7727000	It would be fun, yeah I'd be down for it
7727000	7729000	By that time maybe the movie will come out
7729000	7731000	Who knows, who knows
7731000	7733000	I think it would be great, especially if we could tie it into
7733000	7735000	a charity thing, like everybody has to
7735000	7737000	pony up ten bucks to participate
7737000	7739000	and like, you know, half the pot goes to
7739000	7741000	a prize maybe and the other half goes to charity
7741000	7743000	or it all goes to a charity of
7743000	7745000	the participant's choosing or something like that, I think it would be a really
7745000	7747000	great thing
7747000	7749000	Or it goes to the dark sakura and needs a job fund
7749000	7751000	That's not a registered
7751000	7753000	charity
7753000	7755000	Alright
7755000	7757000	Oh my gosh
7757000	7759000	I was going to see if there were any more questions
7759000	7761000	We're going to keep a couple more times
7761000	7763000	Where are we?
7763000	7765000	Okay, one more on
7765000	7767000	Facebook
7767000	7769000	Code Man wants to know if you were to cosplay
7769000	7771000	what would you cosplay as?
7771000	7773000	Well a lot of us have cosplay
7773000	7775000	What happens I cosplay as?
7775000	7777000	What would you cosplay as now?
7777000	7779000	Actually I can tell you what my next cosplay is going to be
7779000	7781000	My friend Chadi
7781000	7783000	who I think you might have met
7783000	7785000	She wanted, we did a stupid
7785000	7787000	online quiz for Homestuck about what would
7787000	7789000	your god tier be so we were going to just do our god tier
7789000	7791000	outfits
7791000	7793000	Which mine would be the self of heart
7793000	7795000	I need to cosplay as Joker
7795000	7797000	because I got the red beard to pull it off
7797000	7799000	so I would think
7799000	7801000	that would be a character I'd resemble pretty well
7801000	7803000	that I could cosplay
7803000	7805000	I found tutorials
7805000	7807000	Talk to me later
7807000	7809000	Low key
7809000	7811000	Alan, any interest in cosplaying?
7811000	7813000	What would you cosplay as?
7813000	7815000	Um
7815000	7817000	I don't know
7817000	7819000	Low key
7819000	7821000	There you go
7821000	7823000	Um
7823000	7825000	I guess I would cosplay
7825000	7827000	Actually it's funny
7827000	7829000	There's only two things that I kind of wanted to
7829000	7831000	cosplay just because it both involves
7831000	7833000	building cool things
7833000	7835000	Some sort of giant mech thing
7835000	7837000	Although then I'd have to learn how to walk on stilts and that sounds dangerous
7837000	7839000	Or get one of those
7839000	7841000	costumes that's like the
7841000	7843000	really realistic looking
7843000	7845000	raptor dinosaur thing
7845000	7847000	Because it'd be fun to run around with that shit
7847000	7849000	I just want that costume
7849000	7851000	It's pretty sweet
7851000	7853000	I have a better answer
7853000	7855000	A replacement answer
7855000	7857000	Gender swapped ooh la la
7857000	7859000	That would actually be really cool
7859000	7861000	I would cosplay as one of the other characters
7861000	7863000	You have like orange vinyl bell bottoms
7863000	7865000	That's amazing
7865000	7867000	Travis over on Google Plus
7867000	7869000	The lone Google Plus respondent says
7869000	7871000	Hey Robin gang just finished Tomb Raider
7871000	7873000	And was going to start on Deus Ex Human Revolution
7873000	7875000	Was wondering what you all thought about each game
7875000	7877000	Loved Tomb Raider
7877000	7879000	Didn't get a chance to play Deus Ex Human Revolution
7879000	7881000	You should download it quickly because it is
7881000	7883000	free on the PlayStation Network right now
7883000	7885000	Oh is it?
7885000	7887000	Thanks for the tip
7887000	7889000	And Hitman is one they just added too
7889000	7891000	I watched, I think it was TimTrip was playing Hitman
7891000	7893000	The new one and it looked pretty neat
7893000	7895000	It looked like a game I would be terrible at
7895000	7897000	And Jet Set Radio is on there free as well
7897000	7899000	Good lord
7899000	7901000	I was downloading Hitman today
7901000	7903000	I'm playing Dota 2 right now
7903000	7905000	I suck at it but I like it
7905000	7907000	I know you Rob have been playing it
7907000	7909000	What do you think about the learning curve of the game
7909000	7911000	Are you having as much trouble as me?
7911000	7913000	Keep up the good work love you guys
7913000	7915000	Thank you Travis
7915000	7917000	Yes I am having as much trouble as you
7917000	7919000	You just have to jump in there and do it
7919000	7921000	I think that's the only way
7921000	7923000	The good news is Dota 2 has a very robust
7923000	7925000	tutorial system
7925000	7927000	Don't be afraid to do the single lane match
7927000	7929000	I really learned
7929000	7931000	I do not like playing melee classes
7931000	7933000	But I like playing
7933000	7935000	ranged classes
7935000	7937000	One of the ones I really liked was The Lich
7937000	7939000	Because it's basically a parody of
7939000	7941000	Arnold Schwarzenegger and Batman and Robin
7941000	7943000	Chill out
7943000	7945000	Everybody freeze
7945000	7947000	The Lich is like that in Dota 2
7947000	7949000	This is my new favorite character
7949000	7951000	So check that out
7951000	7953000	Alright there it is
7953000	7955000	The end of Ask Orange Lounge
7955000	7957000	But lots of good questions
7957000	7959000	How could we not do that
7959000	7961000	Alright let's do some stories
7961000	7963000	Mailbag a few of the week coming up
7963000	7965000	Twitter topics and the skype line
7965000	7967000	But we have some news first
7967000	7969000	Ok so there's a quick comparison
7969000	7971000	Because we've gotten some information about
7971000	7973000	The DVR function
7973000	7975000	Of those
7975000	7977000	Different next gen consoles
7977000	7979000	So first off
7979000	7981000	Game DVR
7981000	7983000	For the Xbox One
7983000	7985000	There was a Q&A section
7985000	7987000	I had to laugh
7987000	7989000	So IGN did this
7989000	7991000	Ask Microsoft
7991000	7993000	An AMA thing that they have on
7993000	7995000	Reddit and stuff
7995000	7997000	Except that none of the people that
7997000	7999000	You know
7999000	8001000	I'm bringing you a handful of Ask Microsoft
8001000	8003000	Anything answers each Monday at 2pm
8003000	8005000	Blah blah blah
8005000	8007000	But the people that
8007000	8009000	Participated on IGN didn't get the fucking
8009000	8011000	Answer any of those questions
8011000	8013000	It was all shit from IGN
8013000	8015000	Probably you know
8015000	8017000	Stuff that Microsoft said
8017000	8019000	Ok here's what we're gonna give you answers for
8019000	8021000	So anyways so one of those things
8021000	8023000	About you know
8023000	8025000	The game capture stuff they're saying
8025000	8027000	Well fours of five clips capture 1080p
8027000	8029000	And 60 frames per second and you know
8029000	8031000	Where can game DVR clips be uploaded to
8031000	8033000	And they're saying game DVR clips
8033000	8035000	Capture beautiful 720p
8035000	8037000	30 frames per second
8037000	8039000	Video and I believe it's up to
8039000	8041000	Five minutes if that was correct
8041000	8043000	One of the things that kind of sucks
8043000	8045000	Though is you have to have Xbox Live Gold
8045000	8047000	In order to use that feature
8047000	8049000	So they're locking it behind a paywall
8049000	8051000	And of course
8051000	8053000	In typical simly fashion
8053000	8055000	As of late
8055000	8057000	They responded back on Twitter
8057000	8059000	And this is from
8059000	8061000	Shuhei Yoshida
8061000	8063000	Basically
8063000	8065000	Saying that hey guess what
8065000	8067000	The Playstation 4
8067000	8069000	DVR function will record
8069000	8071000	Up to 15 minutes of gameplay
8071000	8073000	In the background and won't be
8073000	8075000	Behind a paywall you do not need Playstation
8075000	8077000	Plus in order to access
8077000	8079000	The game recordings or streaming functionality
8079000	8081000	So
8081000	8083000	Cool
8083000	8085000	I honestly don't think this is that big a deal
8085000	8087000	It's not a huge deal
8087000	8089000	I mean especially since you know if you're gonna be
8089000	8091000	Capturing video and stuff you probably
8091000	8093000	Want to upload it but there
8093000	8095000	You probably have your own set of equipment too
8095000	8097000	If you're really serious about it
8097000	8099000	I understand that but the thing was is they were
8099000	8101000	Basically saying well it's behind a paywall because
8101000	8103000	You know you need to upload it to the cloud
8103000	8105000	Or something like that but if you're uploading a clip
8105000	8107000	To YouTube
8107000	8109000	I don't understand I guess this is what it's doing
8109000	8111000	It's capturing a video and it's uploading it to the cloud
8111000	8113000	And then you edit it in the cloud then it gets forward to the YouTube
8113000	8115000	It just seems like a really unnecessary process
8115000	8117000	But whatever
8117000	8119000	I mean
8119000	8121000	I think a lot of people are gonna be getting the Xbox
8121000	8123000	One probably already have
8123000	8125000	Xbox Live Gold or
8125000	8127000	Will be getting gold and also
8127000	8129000	Now that you only have to have one account per family
8129000	8131000	That has gold if you're gaming on one system
8131000	8133000	That's not a huge deal but
8133000	8135000	Still though it does kind of suck that there's
8135000	8137000	Yet another feature behind a paywall
8137000	8139000	Alright well Bungie has a
8139000	8141000	New game coming out soon Destiny and of course
8141000	8143000	Bungie was best known as the makers of the
8143000	8145000	Halo series for quite some time
8145000	8147000	And you know Halo isn't
8147000	8149000	Always a game known for its best online
8149000	8151000	Behavior and not only do you have the language
8151000	8153000	That people use on things like Xbox Live
8153000	8155000	But then of course you know teabagging
8155000	8157000	Corpses and everything else that people do
8157000	8159000	So Chris Butcher
8159000	8161000	Who is a Bungie technical director was asked
8161000	8163000	In an interview with Edge about
8163000	8165000	How are you gonna address
8165000	8167000	Some of these aggressive behaviors people have
8167000	8169000	And he's mentioning that the developers
8169000	8171000	Are talking about positive social behavior
8171000	8173000	Rewarding in these games
8173000	8175000	If you look back at online multiplayer
8175000	8177000	Gaming for the last 10 years the dominant
8177000	8179000	Thread has been adolescent males shooting each
8179000	8181000	Other in the face and squatting on each other's
8181000	8183000	Corpses at least they acknowledge it
8183000	8185000	That emerges from design decisions
8185000	8187000	The community gets attracted towards that
8187000	8189000	And that is popular to a lot of other people
8189000	8191000	And so it tends to exclude others
8191000	8193000	What they're trying to do is they want to exclude
8193000	8195000	Certain in game gestures
8195000	8197000	And have the mapping of in game gestures
8197000	8199000	Like waving and dancing to encourage
8199000	8201000	More collaboration and friendliness
8201000	8203000	Less posturing and aggression
8203000	8205000	Here's the other quote
8210000	8212000	You give people these tools that encourage
8212000	8214000	Them to interact positively with each other
8214000	8216000	And then if someone is interacting negatively
8216000	8218000	With you well they can't ruin your
8218000	8220000	Experience now they can just dance on your corpse
8220000	8222000	I know it seems a little bit naive
8222000	8224000	To me for a company that's you know did just
8224000	8226000	That's just like trying to like say hey we're
8226000	8228000	Giving you a game where you can draw things but we're gonna
8228000	8230000	Band the dicks it's not gonna happen
8230000	8232000	You're just not just
8232000	8234000	Like if you if all you leave
8234000	8236000	In is a little waving emote people
8236000	8238000	Are gonna figure out how to fist each other
8238000	8240000	Using the terrain
8240000	8242000	That's what's gonna happen
8244000	8246000	Come on
8246000	8248000	But we'll see
8248000	8250000	You underestimate their ability to
8250000	8252000	Create lewd gestures
8252000	8254000	But I do think rewarding good behavior is a good thing
8254000	8256000	League of Legends does it and it feels pretty good
8256000	8258000	When I get the little karma point after a match
8258000	8260000	Because I was friendly to people
8260000	8262000	I really wish WoW would implement a similar system
8262000	8264000	So you know yeah it would be cool if they would reward
8264000	8266000	The good behavior in Destiny but we'll see
8266000	8268000	Where if someone gets killed by somebody else
8268000	8270000	And they try to squad on them they get launched into space
8270000	8272000	It would be funny
8272000	8274000	That would be awesome
8274000	8276000	And then people would do it on purpose to see what happens
8276000	8278000	That would be kind of like a rad mod like you should be able to
8278000	8280000	Carry around like little enhancements and one of them
8280000	8282000	Could be like a time bomb
8282000	8284000	On your corpse so somebody tries to teabag you
8284000	8286000	It sets off the bomb and they go flying that would be funny
8286000	8288000	Anyway
8288000	8290000	Dark Sakura
8290000	8292000	Well in other news
8292000	8294000	Apart from teabagging and exploding into space
8294000	8296000	There's an ad
8296000	8298000	That Target put out
8298000	8300000	That shows the PS Vita
8300000	8302000	Going for 200 bucks
8302000	8304000	And
8304000	8306000	Basically there hasn't been
8306000	8308000	Like a big announcement on anything like that
8308000	8310000	Sony didn't say anything
8310000	8312000	But it's in a Target ad and they have to get it from somewhere
8312000	8314000	Basically this was
8314000	8316000	Shown on
8316000	8318000	Blu-ray forums
8318000	8320000	With them all being marked down to $199.99
8320000	8322000	At Target beginning August 18th
8322000	8324000	To August 24th
8324000	8326000	But there's been no confirmation
8326000	8328000	I mean this could have just been some sort of
8328000	8330000	Photoshopping deal
8330000	8332000	But looking at
8332000	8334000	The image
8334000	8336000	You can see bleed through from the other side
8336000	8338000	For the ads on the other side
8338000	8340000	Which is a lot
8340000	8342000	More effort to put into photoshopping
8342000	8344000	Than most people will do
8344000	8346000	Also considering where it's coming from
8346000	8348000	The Blu-ray forums they're just looking at Blu-ray
8348000	8350000	Discounts and stuff like that
8350000	8352000	Focusing on
8352000	8354000	Gaming consoles
8354000	8356000	I think if anything
8356000	8358000	They're probably trying to clear out some inventory
8358000	8360000	Move some of that product because they've been sitting on it for a while
8360000	8362000	Yeah
8362000	8364000	The first thing that I do when I see stuff like this
8364000	8366000	Is make sure that it's not a Photoshop job
8366000	8368000	Also
8368000	8370000	There is a message
8370000	8372000	From the article itself
8372000	8374000	Saying that Inside Gaming Daily
8374000	8376000	Reported speculation about
8376000	8378000	Doing a $500
8378000	8380000	Vita PS4 bundle
8380000	8382000	Yeah I don't think they'd do that
8382000	8384000	Like I said, speculation
8384000	8386000	But it would kind of go in if they did decrease
8386000	8388000	The cost of the PS Vita
8388000	8390000	Then that would make it easier
8390000	8392000	To bundle with the system
8392000	8394000	For $499?
8394000	8396000	Is that what they were saying?
8396000	8398000	Well they were saying
8398000	8400000	Yeah $500 bundle
8400000	8402000	But again
8402000	8404000	If you've got the system going up for $399
8404000	8406000	And then you threw in a $100 Vita
8406000	8408000	And it competes with
8408000	8410000	Basically the
8410000	8412000	Xbone
8412000	8414000	You're actually getting a better deal
8414000	8416000	With the Playstation
8416000	8418000	It better come with a Lamborghini
8418000	8420000	And a Virgin Galactic space flight
8420000	8422000	And a trip to Dubai
8422000	8424000	Maybe not
8424000	8426000	I would rather have a system with a handheld system
8426000	8428000	Than have to deal with the stupid Kinect bullshit
8428000	8430000	Just saying
8430000	8432000	It'd be nice if it was true
8432000	8434000	I don't know if I'd want a $100
8434000	8436000	Space flight
8436000	8438000	That sounds kind of dangerous
8438000	8440000	So Nintendo is fighting piracy
8440000	8442000	And this is actually more of like
8442000	8444000	Legit piracy
8444000	8446000	This is coming from
8446000	8448000	A website
8448000	8450000	Wait wait wait
8450000	8452000	What is legit piracy?
8452000	8454000	Like making physical goods
8454000	8456000	Like
8456000	8458000	Duplicating physical goods
8458000	8460000	For example
8460000	8462000	They filed a lawsuit against
8462000	8464000	Hackyourconsole.com
8464000	8466000	Other than selling the R4 device
8466000	8468000	And similar things
8468000	8470000	They also happen to sell hard drives
8470000	8472000	That are preloaded with 200 Wii games
8472000	8474000	Hmm that sounds a
8474000	8476000	Bit bad
8476000	8478000	That's pretty clear cut there
8478000	8480000	They've lawsuit against them
8480000	8482000	And most likely
8482000	8484000	They're probably going to win
8484000	8486000	That's pretty clear cut
8486000	8488000	If they were just selling the R4 devices
8488000	8490000	I'd say that they may have
8490000	8492000	A little bit of a fight ahead of them
8492000	8494000	But selling actual
8494000	8496000	You know
8496000	8498000	Hard drives that are full
8498000	8500000	Of
8500000	8502000	Games that's kind of bad
8504000	8506000	Alright
8506000	8508000	Well I don't know what else to say about that
8508000	8510000	I mean if you're doing some bad stuff
8510000	8512000	You're going to get shut down eventually
8512000	8514000	There's really no arguing that right?
8514000	8516000	Yeah it looks like actually they've removed
8516000	8518000	The modded Wii consoles off their site
8518000	8520000	All right well
8520000	8522000	Moving on to talk about
8522000	8524000	Street Fighter 5
8524000	8526000	Nothing's been announced
8526000	8528000	Don't get too excited
8528000	8530000	After all we still have Ultra Street Fighter 4
8530000	8532000	To get through
8532000	8534000	There's at least a dozen more adjectives they can slap on to 4
8534000	8536000	Well you're going to have
8536000	8538000	Alina, Rolento, Hugo
8538000	8540000	Poison and who knows who else
8540000	8542000	Coming to Ultra Street Fighter 4
8542000	8544000	But here's the thing
8544000	8546000	According to one of the producers at Capcom
8546000	8548000	Jackie Ayano says that
8548000	8550000	Users do not need to worry because
8550000	8552000	The characters will definitely not be just copy and pasted
8552000	8554000	For Street Fighter X Tekken
8554000	8556000	If we did that they would undoubtedly be the strongest characters
8556000	8558000	In the game so
8558000	8560000	These characters will be redone for Ultra Street Fighter 4
8560000	8562000	But what happens next?
8562000	8564000	Well
8564000	8566000	It took 6 years to go from Street Fighter 2
8566000	8568000	To Street Fighter 3
8568000	8570000	And 9 years to go from Street Fighter 3 to Street Fighter 4
8570000	8572000	So it would probably take us until
8572000	8574000	The year 2018
8574000	8576000	Before Street Fighter 5 comes out
8576000	8578000	So yes no Street Fighter 5 until 2018
8578000	8580000	But look forward to
8580000	8582000	Insert adjective here Street Fighter 4
8582000	8584000	Each and every year until then
8584000	8586000	Single adjective please
8586000	8588000	In 2018 I'll be turning 40
8588000	8590000	And that makes me sad
8590000	8592000	And you'll be 42
8592000	8594000	40 also
8594000	8596000	Not 42
8596000	8598000	But at least we'll have Street Fighter 5
8598000	8600000	At our birthday party to celebrate
8600000	8602000	You can both be quiet
8602000	8604000	I have 3 years for that shit
8604000	8606000	That's right you forgot 40
8606000	8608000	And amazing
8608000	8610000	Anyhow can you believe we started
8610000	8612000	This show and I was what like
8612000	8614000	23 or having my 24th birthday
8614000	8616000	And
8616000	8618000	Now we're getting old as the show's getting old
8618000	8620000	We'll probably still be doing OLR
8620000	8622000	Hey kids
8622000	8624000	50 come hey kids come

8662000	8664000	Favorite emails here on the show
8666000	8668000	Read the emails
8668000	8670000	God dang Rob
8670000	8672000	Hi all Ragenator here
8672000	8674000	Here's a last second short random question
8674000	8676000	What is the worst game each of you have played
8676000	8678000	And what qualifies said games as being the worst
8678000	8680000	I can tell you one that was so bad
8680000	8682000	That Dan and I took it back to a
8682000	8684000	Botbuster and requested a refund
8684000	8686000	That was like some
8686000	8688000	wrestling game it was thunder like WCW
8688000	8690000	Thunder
8690000	8692000	This is when we were on a really big wrestling kick
8692000	8694000	And it was just bad
8694000	8696000	We were like what the hell is this
8696000	8698000	And also Spice World
8698000	8700000	Fusion Frenzy 2 is the worst
8700000	8702000	Game in recent memory that I've played
8702000	8704000	It was so fucking bad
8706000	8708000	Yaris
8708000	8710000	That was gonna be my answer
8710000	8712000	Me too me too
8712000	8714000	Alright that's it
8714000	8716000	So short
8716000	8718000	God this is long
8718000	8720000	With links to YouTube that I am not
8720000	8722000	Going to address because first of all
8722000	8724000	Can't watch YouTube on my iPad
8724000	8726000	Thank you
8726000	8728000	You can watch YouTube on your iPad
8728000	8730000	Yes I can but not during the show
8730000	8732000	Alright just to be clear
8732000	8734000	Stop it
8734000	8736000	Greetings OLR
8736000	8738000	First off I hope you guys enjoyed your week off
8738000	8740000	I might have if I still had a job
8740000	8742000	I know we can all use one
8742000	8744000	Anyway I thought I'd share some thoughts about
8744000	8746000	Phil Fish's recent childish outburst
8746000	8748000	First of all I'm greatly disappointed that you
8748000	8750000	Guys improperly present Marcus
8750000	8752000	Beer's complaint
8752000	8754000	At least to me he seemed more angry than Phil Fish
8754000	8756000	And Jonathan Blow were acting
8756000	8758000	As though being asked questions
8758000	8760000	Was some sort of unreasonable burden
8760000	8762000	In case you haven't linked
8762000	8764000	I'd certainly love to see what Phil Fish
8764000	8766000	And Jonathan Blow said to Game Informer leading up
8766000	8768000	To this however with only Marcus's
8768000	8770000	Initial rant and Fish's immature response
8770000	8772000	It just looks like a lot of grief could have
8772000	8774000	Been saved with more
8774000	8776000	Boilerplate non-committal response
8776000	8778000	Which leads me to my position
8778000	8780000	Phil Fish cancelled Fez 2 and is
8780000	8782000	Leaving the game industry just because a few people
8782000	8784000	Called out his condescending nonsense
8784000	8786000	Seriously?
8786000	8788000	I'm some
8788000	8790000	Insignificant twit in Miami who gets
8790000	8792000	Worse every time he sends an email to the show
8792000	8794000	Saying something someone doesn't like
8794000	8796000	But do you see me pitching my skirt and running away?
8796000	8798000	No
8798000	8800000	The only reason I haven't sent an email lately
8800000	8802000	Is because I've not had anything to say before this
8802000	8806000	You ask me Marcus is 100% right on this
8806000	8808000	If you don't have anything to say
8808000	8810000	Or you're looking for a confirmation
8810000	8812000	You can say so
8812000	8814000	You can give a rote
8814000	8816000	We do not comment on rumors and speculation
8816000	8818000	If you like
8818000	8820000	However unless you're going to do a massive TV and radio advertisement
8820000	8822000	Carpet bombing
8822000	8824000	It's not a good idea to treat the press like
8824000	8826000	They're the worst thing that's ever existed
8826000	8828000	If they're not asking anything personal
8828000	8830000	Or trying to create controversy for page hits
8830000	8832000	Then treat them with the measure of respect
8832000	8834000	That you want them to treat you
8834000	8836000	Or more importantly your game
8836000	8838000	Honestly I hope the press takes
8838000	8840000	Marcus Spears advice
8840000	8842000	I hope Blow and Fish
8842000	8844000	Have trouble for the rest of their careers
8844000	8846000	Finding press who want to endure
8846000	8848000	Their nonsensical whining
8848000	8850000	Because that's the only thing that hostile
8850000	8852000	That hostile assholes deserve
8852000	8854000	Unfortunately I know that Fish will come back
8854000	8856000	To kickstarter for Fez 2
8856000	8858000	And get his goal times a billion
8858000	8860000	Because most gamers stop thinking for themselves
8860000	8862000	When words like innovation and independent
8862000	8864000	Are thrown about
8864000	8866000	This is of course while many other developers
8866000	8868000	In the air know struggle to gain any attention at all
8868000	8870000	There truly is no justice in the world
8870000	8872000	Anyway
8872000	8874000	Quick question now, thank you
8874000	8876000	I had a quick question unrelated to this nonsense
8876000	8878000	Recently Giant Bomb had a quick look
8878000	8880000	Of Dynasty Warriors 8
8880000	8882000	In which the only bit of information that could be gleaned
8882000	8884000	They looked at it was that the Xbox 360 version
8884000	8886000	Was a poorly done port
8886000	8888000	Why was there so little information
8888000	8890000	For such a long video
8890000	8892000	Because Jeff and Vinny were devoted to hammering
8892000	8894000	The hit X joke into the ground
8894000	8896000	And whining about how they hated the series as a whole
8896000	8898000	Anyway I've never played
8898000	8900000	A Musou game before and was mainly
8900000	8902000	Scared off of them as it seems many of the media
8902000	8904000	Outlets I frequent have the same attitude
8904000	8906000	Of dismissing the games at first glance
8906000	8908000	Then you need to re-destruct
8908000	8910000	Doid and Jim Sterling
8910000	8912000	See some people
8912000	8914000	Sorry to interrupt but some people
8914000	8916000	Are here for that and I think either you're
8916000	8918000	Kind of like a fan of those types of games
8918000	8920000	Some people get great pleasure
8920000	8922000	Out of button mashing X and kill kill kill
8922000	8924000	Die die die
8924000	8926000	See that's the thing with reviewers
8926000	8928000	You can't just take some anonymous reviewers
8928000	8930000	Opinion for it, you gotta look at what they like
8930000	8932000	And if they like similar games
8932000	8934000	That you like then that's the reviewer
8934000	8936000	You follow as far as whether
8936000	8938000	You may like something that
8938000	8940000	If they like that genre of game
8940000	8942000	Then yes that would probably be
8942000	8944000	One that you wanna, if they say it's truly bad
8944000	8946000	Then you know
8946000	8948000	I get really stressed out and irritated too
8948000	8950000	When I hear these big media outlets
8950000	8952000	Talking about things that they don't know a lick about
8952000	8954000	Like you know I think a great example
8954000	8956000	Going back to X-Play
8956000	8958000	When they talked about how Beatmania on the Playstation 2
8958000	8960000	Was a rip off of Guitar Hero
8960000	8962000	I was like um
8962000	8964000	Um no
8964000	8966000	But then I have to remember
8966000	8968000	I don't really give a shit what X-Play thinks
8968000	8970000	You know and I don't really base my decisions
8970000	8972000	Off that show
8972000	8974000	So I have to find the reviewer that best matches me
8974000	8976000	And you say a lot
8976000	8978000	With your voice when you tune out
8978000	8980000	Yeah but if you don't look at multiple sources
8980000	8982000	You may miss something
8982000	8984000	I'm not saying focus necessarily on just one
8984000	8986000	But you do have to kinda
8986000	8988000	You have to find those that kinda mesh well with your taste
8988000	8990000	I think like Loki said
8990000	8992000	I don't know much about these Jim Sterling reviews
8992000	8994000	But it sounds like if he's more of a fan of these
8994000	8996000	It's counter balanced to what you saw happen over on
8996000	8998000	There's more in the email
8998000	9000000	There's a lot more in the email
9000000	9002000	However I read a blog defending the series
9002000	9004000	And this was on Giant Bomb
9004000	9006000	And was immediately struck by the passionate defense of the series
9006000	9008000	And the blogger's reactions for loving it as he does
9008000	9010000	Intrigued by the case he made
9010000	9012000	I picked up Warriors Orochi 3 Hyper
9012000	9014000	For Wii U
9014000	9016000	As a sort of test for how I'd feel
9016000	9018000	I ended up enjoying the game immensely
9018000	9020000	And have since picked up Dynasty Warriors 8 for the PS3
9020000	9022000	And the original Warriors Orochi for 360
9022000	9024000	In addition to importing the PS3 version
9024000	9026000	Of Dynasty Warriors 7 Empires
9026000	9028000	I think about this now
9028000	9030000	Against the current backdrop of people passionately tearing
9030000	9032000	Apart reviewers for having a less than positive
9032000	9034000	Opinion of Dragon's Crown to the point where
9034000	9036000	Atlas had to defend controversial reviews
9036000	9038000	By the way
9038000	9040000	My problem with Dragon Crown is just
9040000	9042000	The
9042000	9044000	I love and hate the art style in that game
9044000	9046000	And that's really what I hate
9046000	9048000	Did you see the minigame where the girl's chained up
9048000	9050000	And you can touch her and she squirms?
9050000	9052000	Yeah, I hate that
9052000	9054000	Anyway, going onward
9054000	9056000	While I don't like the game either
9056000	9058000	After having played it
9058000	9060000	I can safely assume that were I on the fence
9060000	9062000	Controversial ranting
9062000	9064000	We're seeing now would not have driven me
9064000	9066000	To try the way the game
9066000	9068000	The way the impassioned
9068000	9070000	Immature defense of Dynasty Warriors
9070000	9072000	I mentioned earlier had moved me
9072000	9074000	With that in mind, here's my inquiry
9074000	9076000	I thought it was a short question
9076000	9078000	Okay
9078000	9080000	I'm sorry RossoUT
9080000	9082000	I actually really like your emails because of how well
9082000	9084000	Written they are and just how well you lay out
9084000	9086000	Your ideas
9086000	9088000	You know what, I do appreciate that
9088000	9090000	He does come back when he's got something to say
9090000	9092000	Yes
9092000	9094000	With that in mind, here's my inquiry
9094000	9096000	Uh oh, I need to make sure I don't get out of chat
9096000	9098000	Okay
9098000	9100000	First, why does defending
9100000	9102000	Something often turn into attacks on disagreeing
9102000	9104000	Reviewers despite it being counterproductive
9104000	9106000	To the apparent goal of winning
9106000	9108000	Over the indecisive
9108000	9110000	Well to go on that first, I mean look at freaking politics
9110000	9112000	Oh god yes
9112000	9114000	I think that's more human, that's not something specific to gaming
9114000	9116000	That's human nature
9116000	9118000	Yeah that's human nature, my way or the highway
9118000	9120000	And as I mentioned in part A, people actually do get a positive
9120000	9122000	Chemical response from having other people agree with them
9122000	9124000	And by presenting
9124000	9126000	Their own information
9126000	9128000	It is
9128000	9130000	I think it's a dopamine response
9130000	9132000	Where if you, people actually feel better
9132000	9134000	Attacking something that's outside
9135000	9137000	It feels good to be validated and affirmated
9137000	9139000	Get out
9139000	9141000	I understand
9141000	9143000	But for some people they actually take that
9143000	9145000	Aggression side of it and get kind of an adrenaline
9145000	9147000	Rush off of it
9147000	9149000	You know, you get into that
9149000	9151000	Especially the more passionate you feel about something
9151000	9153000	You stop really caring about what other people think
9153000	9155000	Your idea or nothing
9155000	9157000	And you do get an emotional rush out of it
9157000	9159000	So it really is just basic
9159000	9161000	Biochemistry and psychology
9161000	9163000	Anybody else?
9163000	9165000	Want to expand?
9165000	9167000	Nah go ahead because I know there's at least a couple more
9167000	9169000	Second, have you ever been moved by an
9169000	9171000	Unpopular games defenders to give said game
9171000	9173000	A chance?
9173000	9175000	Mass Effect
9175000	9177000	Yeah Mass Effect is a good example
9177000	9179000	And it wasn't unpopular but a lot of people
9179000	9181000	I wasn't going to give it a chance
9181000	9183000	Well at the time, remember we got into it right when
9183000	9185000	Mass Effect 3 had first come out
9185000	9187000	There was all that ending wank
9187000	9189000	So I don't know about the unpopular part
9189000	9191000	Well god even just this week
9191000	9193000	I gave Team Fortress 2 a try
9193000	9195000	I didn't think I'd like it but Act Deaf was like
9195000	9197000	No you gotta try, you gotta try
9197000	9199000	I think it's a massively unpopular game
9199000	9201000	Yeah that's true, I guess Team Fortress isn't really unpopular either
9201000	9203000	Well god, what about the music games
9203000	9205000	We used to play for years
9205000	9207000	I don't think those cracked into the mainstream
9207000	9209000	Well and I actually liked Kraken DJ
9209000	9211000	For a while, I thought that was fun
9211000	9213000	And a lot of people were like yeah
9213000	9215000	Um
9215000	9217000	I know that there were others because um
9217000	9219000	Like some of the weirder treasure
9219000	9221000	Games that people were kind of poo pooing on
9221000	9223000	I thought were great, you know like, I liked Chameleon
9223000	9225000	Twist, I liked uh
9225000	9227000	Mischief Makers, those were fun games
9227000	9229000	You know, anything?
9231000	9233000	Okay, anyway keep up the good work
9233000	9235000	Guys, I look forward to your response
9235000	9237000	Regards, we're all still UT
9237000	9239000	Alrighty, two more to go
9239000	9241000	Alright, dearest denizens of
9241000	9243000	Podcastopia
9243000	9245000	So I got a summons for jury duty
9245000	9247000	For next week, I'm sorry
9247000	9249000	I didn't know on what day this week
9249000	9251000	I will have to drag my happy ass out of bed
9251000	9253000	To be at the courthouse at 8am to do my civic duty
9253000	9255000	But I do know that day is
9255000	9257000	Not Monday, this gives me at least one
9257000	9259000	Day to download a game off PSN
9259000	9261000	To play on my Vita
9261000	9263000	What should I get? Preferably
9263000	9265000	I'd like something that won't make a lot of noise
9265000	9267000	But will require me to make a lot of
9267000	9269000	Movements that look vaguely threatening to old people
9269000	9271000	Stay black, redertainment
9271000	9273000	Trainer
9273000	9275000	Uh
9275000	9277000	Gaming during jury duty is
9277000	9279000	There is going to be long periods of waiting
9279000	9281000	You know what?
9281000	9283000	You know the Sacramento courthouse that make you turn off all your devices
9283000	9285000	What? When you're in
9285000	9287000	Oh, when you're in the room, when you're in the
9287000	9289000	Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I mean like while you're waiting
9289000	9291000	In the jury hall, while you're waiting in the hallway
9291000	9293000	I have always spent more time
9293000	9295000	In the stupid jury selection
9295000	9297000	Than I have ever in the lines
9297000	9299000	So any suggestions
9299000	9301000	For Vita games that make you look
9301000	9303000	Vaguely spasmodic?
9305000	9307000	Not that don't involve Kinect
9307000	9309000	Katamari!
9309000	9311000	Um, Little Big Planet?
9311000	9313000	Maybe
9313000	9315000	Or I
9315000	9317000	I can't recommend this because
9317000	9319000	The game is bad, but a fighting game
9319000	9321000	Involves in there's
9321000	9323000	Cap Comics Tekken
9323000	9325000	So that'll be
9325000	9327000	Mashing the buttons and looking mean
9327000	9329000	Yeah
9329000	9331000	I definitely see looks of frustration
9331000	9333000	In playing that, so that makes sense
9333000	9335000	So we do have one last email
9335000	9337000	Hey OLR crew
9337000	9339000	AZHP here
9339000	9341000	I never asked, is it AZHP or AZHP?
9341000	9343000	I think it's AZHP
9343000	9345000	I thought the HP was Harry Potter
9345000	9347000	Okay
9347000	9349000	Last week I went to a convention
9349000	9351000	Co-founded by a good friend of mine called
9351000	9353000	GamerX
9353000	9355000	My girlfriend cosplayed as Zelda
9355000	9357000	Which as anime fans is the most mainstream
9357000	9359000	Game cosplay she had
9359000	9361000	I wanted to write in to say
9361000	9363000	She had a super positive experience
9363000	9365000	Even as a completely straight couple
9365000	9367000	Everyone who wanted a picture with her was super enthusiastic
9367000	9369000	And didn't give off the typical creeper vibe
9369000	9371000	That comes with most convention goers
9371000	9373000	When they said
9373000	9375000	I love your costume, it's amazing
9375000	9377000	She didn't feel like they were trying to hit on her
9377000	9379000	And genuinely enjoyed her costume
9379000	9381000	Even though we didn't go to many of the panels
9381000	9383000	And the dealer's hall was clearly geared toward
9383000	9385000	The LGBT crowd
9385000	9387000	The vibe we got from the convention was super positive
9387000	9389000	The game room was lots of fun
9389000	9391000	The Japanese version of Project Diva F
9391000	9393000	The Saturn version of Puzzle Bobble
9393000	9395000	And Typing of the Dead on Dreamcast
9395000	9397000	I was actually surprised
9397000	9399000	There weren't that many furries at the convention
9399000	9401000	Given that I know a lot of gamers are also
9401000	9403000	Furries
9403000	9405000	There were a couple, because they were even advertising a furry con
9405000	9407000	That's coming up, had one of the booths
9407000	9409000	So, you know, hey, whatever you like
9409000	9411000	As long as it's, you know, consensual
9411000	9413000	I unfortunately wasn't able to stay
9413000	9415000	Late enough to catch the podcast panel
9415000	9417000	I definitely regret
9417000	9419000	Missing my chance to say hi to Rob
9419000	9421000	Squinty face
9421000	9423000	Anyway, I definitely recommend people check it out
9423000	9425000	It's definitely a fun experience
9425000	9427000	Well, definitely, lots of definitelys there
9427000	9429000	Check it out again next year if it's in San Francisco again
9429000	9431000	Yours truly is HP
9431000	9433000	P.S. If you guys are interested
9433000	9435000	Here's a picture of the Zelda costume my girlfriend wore
9435000	9437000	I actually looked at the picture
9437000	9439000	And I saw her
9439000	9441000	Which must have been I saw you at some point
9441000	9443000	And I was like
9443000	9445000	Wow, that is fucking good
9445000	9447000	Feel free to link in the chat
9447000	9449000	I helped make the harp
9449000	9451000	So it was cool hearing people compliment it at the convention
9451000	9453000	So I'm pulling it up
9453000	9455000	Very nice
9455000	9457000	Yeah, it was very good
9457000	9459000	Yeah, if you can put that in chat
9459000	9461000	I'm sure the chatters would like to see that
9461000	9463000	Very well done
9463000	9465000	I saw her in the gaming room
9465000	9467000	Playing one of the dancing games
9467000	9469000	Alright, well I'm gonna copy this
9469000	9471000	If I didn't actually close the window
9471000	9473000	Alright, that's it for
9473000	9475000	Emails tonight, right?
9475000	9477000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
9477000	9479000	We're almost to 9 o'clock
9479000	9481000	So let's try to jam through the rest of this pretty quick
9481000	9483000	Because I do want to get in some calls
9483000	9485000	So we're gonna go to the FUs
9485000	9487000	Of the week
9487000	9503000	Dark Sakura
9503000	9505000	I was debating whether or not
9505000	9507000	I wanted to say their name on air
9507000	9509000	But I'm going to
9509000	9511000	FU to Bonnie Plumbing Heating and Air
9511000	9515000	For giving indications
9515000	9519000	Of being the type of hypocritical conservative Christians
9519000	9521000	That I personally do not like
9521000	9523000	Allegedly
9523000	9525000	Loki
9525000	9527000	Oh, and my battery
9527000	9529000	FU to my car
9529000	9531000	I'm not really sure what it's doing
9531000	9533000	But whenever I turn all the way to the right
9533000	9535000	My radio shuts off
9535000	9537000	That's weird
9537000	9539000	That's a little creepy
9539000	9541000	FU to this fucking con plague
9541000	9543000	I've been carrying since Tuesday
9543000	9545000	And FU to Extifer
9545000	9547000	Who allegedly gave it to me
9547000	9549000	Alan
9549000	9551000	FU to the associated dental issues
9551000	9553000	That someone can get when they're in their 30s
9553000	9555000	And also FU to the fact that I think
9555000	9557000	Sanrio chewed through
9557000	9559000	The microphone portion cable
9559000	9561000	Of my headset
9561000	9563000	Though it doesn't look chewed
9563000	9565000	It looks like someone just snipped it with scissors
9565000	9567000	Because you know how a headset has the green
9567000	9569000	And the red for the mic
9569000	9571000	It forks off like a snake stone at the very end
9572000	9574000	I wonder why she would have chewed that
9574000	9576000	It's weird
9576000	9578000	She's gonna have to buy a new headset
9578000	9580000	It's like 40 bucks that I don't have
9580000	9582000	Alright, there it is, you have to use the week
9582000	9584000	Loki
9584000	9586000	Alright, so more Xbox One news
9586000	9588000	This is once again
9588000	9590000	Something else that they've kind of changed their mind on
9590000	9592000	And that was the whole inclusion
9592000	9594000	Of a chat headset
9594000	9596000	With the Xbox One
9596000	9598000	Yes, the Xbox One
9598000	9600000	Day one edition will come with a chat headset
9600000	9604000	So it'll be very much like it was with the Xbox 360
9604000	9606000	Originally, they were planning not to include one of those
9606000	9608000	And you'd have to buy it separately
9608000	9610000	So, good to know
9610000	9612000	You're getting some more value for your $500
9615000	9618000	Hooray! I guess a lot of people are very excited about that
9618000	9620000	More value is good
9620000	9623000	And also hooray, I want to end on a positive note tonight
9623000	9625000	Because unfortunately a lot of times
9625000	9627000	We have to talk about, you know, gaming studios
9627000	9629000	That are closing
9629000	9631000	And people that are out of a job
9631000	9633000	But tonight we get to say hooray
9633000	9637000	In Vancouver, Namco Bandai is opening a new office
9637000	9640000	And it's gonna be dedicated to mobile and online titles
9640000	9643000	But about 30 people working there in Vancouver
9643000	9645000	Making these titles
9645000	9647000	No word of course on what those games are
9647000	9649000	But, yay
9649000	9651000	And since this is a Namco story
9651000	9652000	Can I say something real quick?
9652000	9653000	Please do
9653000	9655000	They're talking about this in chat
9656000	9659000	Pac-Man Champion Edition DX is coming to Steam
9659000	9661000	It's a DX Plus version
9661000	9663000	Out of respect for Dark Sakura
9663000	9665000	I will say I purchased early
9665000	9667000	I purchased in advance
9667000	9669000	I did not pre-purchase because that's not a thing
9669000	9671000	I purchased early the game
9671000	9673000	Oh, stop feeding her
9673000	9675000	Alan is perfectly right
9675000	9677000	If you purchase early
9677000	9679000	Because it's not gonna be playable until September 24th
9679000	9681000	And they took my $9.99
9681000	9683000	So if you purchase early you'll get
9683000	9685000	What I think is going to be a DLC pack
9685000	9687000	It's extra songs, extra maps
9687000	9689000	And you can play as the little Dig Dug avatar
9689000	9691000	I thought some of that was supposed to be part of it anyway
9691000	9693000	And a little race car avatar
9693000	9696000	Well it says Act Def in chat pasted the Steam link
9696000	9698000	And it'll say purchase now and you'll get all this crap
9698000	9703000	So, new Pac-Man or Pac-Man DX is such an amazing game
9703000	9705000	Yeah, it is a great Pac-Man game
9705000	9706000	It's coming to Steam
9706000	9708000	Alright, we're gonna open up the phones now
9708000	9710000	It's that time, 1877 Game OLR
9710000	9712000	Or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio
9712000	9714000	If you want to give us a call
9714000	9716000	And talk with us about anything we've talked about tonight
9716000	9718000	Or maybe you have something that we didn't cover
9718000	9720000	That you want to talk about
9720000	9722000	But, there it is
9722000	9724000	The phones are open
9724000	9726000	1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype
9726000	9728000	Orange Lounge Radio
9728000	9730000	I saw at least one tweet come through that I want to get to
9730000	9732000	Here quickly
9732000	9734000	Otherwise, do we have any last minute stories?
9734000	9736000	Loki, Dark Sakura?
9736000	9738000	Yeah, I can talk real quick about
9738000	9740000	They announced, well, I knew about them
9740000	9742000	They announced the characters for the second wave
9742000	9744000	Of Disney Infinity stuff
9744000	9746000	That's going to be starting in October
9746000	9748000	And those include such things as like the Wreck-It Ralph
9748000	9750000	Characters, so you get Wreck-It Ralph
9750000	9752000	They've got
9752000	9754000	What else here?
9754000	9756000	Of course, the Toy Story pack is going to be coming around
9756000	9758000	At the same time as the Buzz Lightyear
9758000	9760000	Jesse are going to be in the actual pack
9760000	9762000	And then Woody is going to be sold separately
9762000	9764000	They're going to have the Phineas and Furb
9764000	9766000	Or Phineas and Agent P
9766000	9768000	And then of course, like I said
9768000	9770000	Ralph, Vanellope
9770000	9772000	And then kind of some one-offs
9772000	9774000	They have Rapunzel from Tangled
9774000	9776000	Jack Skellington
9776000	9778000	And, um
9778000	9780000	Let me, I'm on Fantasia
9780000	9782000	We actually have a call on the line
9782000	9784000	You can probably hear the coffee in the background
9784000	9786000	We have a call on the line
9786000	9788000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
9788000	9790000	Hello, it's Codeman
9790000	9792000	Hey Codeman, how you doing?
9792000	9794000	Sorry for the Facebook sounds, Rob
9794000	9796000	You better be
9796000	9798000	Do what?
9798000	9800000	Is that you coughing? Or is that the little one?
9800000	9802000	Oh no, she's asleep
9802000	9804000	Oh, okay, well what's up?
9804000	9808000	Oh no, I was just wanting to know if everyone's excited about August 13th
9808000	9810000	I am totally jazzed about Tuesday
9810000	9812000	And why?
9812000	9814000	Is this Disney Infinite?
9814000	9816000	Or what is it that you're excited about?
9816000	9818000	DuckTales, isn't it?
9818000	9820000	Oh, DuckTales
9820000	9822000	I am excited about that, yes
9822000	9824000	So excited I forgot the day
9824000	9826000	Well, and like, what I was
9826000	9828000	Just so fan, I mean, I was just
9828000	9830000	Amazed about, like, they brought back
9830000	9832000	Every single voice actor
9832000	9834000	Yes
9834000	9836000	That has ever played in the DuckTales series
9836000	9838000	And, and, I'm not
9838000	9840000	Quite sure how old
9840000	9842000	The voice actor is for Scrooge McDuck
9842000	9844000	He's in the, he's in his 90s, I know that
9844000	9846000	Yeah, the lady with the magic of the spell
9846000	9848000	Is old as hell too
9848000	9850000	Yeah, and like, I was just
9850000	9852000	Amazed at how the voice actually
9852000	9854000	Sounded in, like, the trailers and stuff
9854000	9856000	And I was like, it's
9856000	9858000	It's perfect, like, it's the same
9858000	9860000	Exact voice that was in
9860000	9862000	The, you know, the game back in the day
9862000	9864000	So I, you know, I'm really excited about that
9864000	9866000	I just wanted to call in and talk about that
9866000	9868000	Because I am just stoked
9868000	9870000	About this game, I haven't been so
9870000	9872000	Excited, well, except
9872000	9874000	For when Earthbound was released, but
9874000	9876000	But, I mean, I'm excited
9876000	9878000	So excited about the game
9878000	9880000	What platform? How do you guys feel about the game?
9881000	9883000	Yes, I will definitely be picking it up
9883000	9885000	But even I can't decide what platform
9885000	9887000	Do I get it on, because I could do
9887000	9889000	PC, I could do Wii U
9889000	9891000	Because, you know, it's kind of the newest thing out there
9891000	9893000	I could get PlayStation 3
9893000	9895000	Because, you know, trophies or whatever
9895000	9897000	Xbox 360s, where a lot of my friends will probably be
9897000	9899000	I don't know, I don't know what system to get it on
9899000	9901000	Have you decided?
9901000	9903000	Unfortunately, I don't think they're releasing it
9903000	9905000	For the Mac, so I can't get it on Steam
9905000	9907000	But I can, I think
9907000	9909000	I'm gonna be picking it up on the Wii U
9909000	9911000	Why is that?
9911000	9913000	Well, because, I don't know, it's just nostalgic
9913000	9915000	Of, like, it being on Nintendo
9915000	9917000	Like, when I used to play it when I was a kid
9917000	9919000	And so, like, I feel like I should play it on a
9919000	9921000	Nintendo console, it sounds stupid
9921000	9923000	No, not at all
9923000	9925000	I just feel like I should play it on a Nintendo console
9925000	9927000	Okay, fair enough, I think I might end up
9927000	9929000	Getting it on Wii U, because at least it does have the
9929000	9931000	Off-screen play, which, you know, as little
9931000	9933000	As it is, it is something the other
9933000	9935000	Platforms don't get, so, and I think
9935000	9937000	Xbox 360 is delayed anyway, so, I mean
9938000	9940000	Yeah, I think it's September
9940000	9942000	I could be wrong, but I think it's September
9942000	9944000	13th or 14th, but I could be wrong
9950000	9952000	I am, that's what I enjoy about the whole
9952000	9954000	Earthbound things, you know, because my wife
9954000	9956000	You know, she might want to watch Hulu
9956000	9958000	Or Netflix or something, and I could just sit here
9958000	9960000	On my Wii U tablet and play Earthbound
9960000	9962000	All night, so that was really cool
9962000	9965000	Oh, Nintendo wants you to sell some Wii U's
9965000	9967000	That's exactly what they want to hear
9967000	9969000	No, I love that about that console
9969000	9971000	You know, I picked up Metroid
9971000	9973000	You know, and all that stuff
9973000	9975000	And so I can just sit there on my tablet
9975000	9977000	And play that, so that's really cool
9977000	9979000	Excellent
9979000	9981000	Well, anything else you're looking forward to
9981000	9983000	Over these coming weeks?
9983000	9985000	Well, I mean, not really
9985000	9987000	I'm going to be playing the hell out of DuckTales
9987000	9989000	So that's probably the only thing
9989000	9991000	I'm going to be playing for a while
9991000	9993000	I've been playing Don't Starve
9993000	9995000	It has stolen my life
9995000	9997000	It literally has, I mean, that game
9997000	9999000	I don't know if you've played it yet
9999000	10001000	I haven't
10001000	10003000	Not yet, but tell the listeners more about it
10003000	10005000	For those that don't know, because you have been trying to
10005000	10007000	Get me in on this game
10007000	10009000	Well, Don't Starve is basically a roguelike game
10009000	10011000	I mean, you start out at day one
10011000	10013000	It is the title
10013000	10015000	I mean, you're basically trying to survive
10015000	10017000	And you just continue
10017000	10019000	On and on and on
10019000	10021000	And you go through all the seasons
10021000	10023000	You start out in the spring
10023000	10025000	Well, actually, I think you start in the summer
10025000	10027000	And then you go into the spring, and then you go into the winter
10027000	10029000	And then everything has everything to do with
10029000	10031000	Like, you have to build
10031000	10033000	Coats
10033000	10035000	To stay warm
10035000	10037000	You have to, you know, fires at night
10037000	10039000	So you don't die from creatures in the night
10039000	10041000	And all that stuff
10041000	10043000	You have sanity that you have to keep up
10043000	10045000	You have to constantly keep your belly full of food
10045000	10047000	And then you have to constantly keep your health up
10047000	10049000	So, I mean, it's such
10049000	10051000	A frustrating game, because you get
10051000	10053000	I think the other day I got to like
10053000	10055000	Day 34 or something in the winter
10055000	10057000	And I just ran out of food
10057000	10059000	Because nothing grows in the winter
10059000	10061000	And so then I died at day 34
10061000	10063000	And it just starts you
10063000	10065000	Back at day one with nothing
10065000	10067000	I mean, I haven't played a roguelike game in forever
10067000	10069000	So, I mean, it's just
10069000	10071000	It's very frustrating, but it's a very fun game
10071000	10073000	And I would suggest anybody
10073000	10075000	On Steam to buy it
10075000	10077000	And play the hell out of it
10077000	10079000	I think it's $14.99
10079000	10081000	And that's everything
10081000	10083000	And they update it constantly
10083000	10085000	With new places to go
10085000	10087000	In wormholes
10087000	10089000	And then there's like a
10089000	10091000	There's different worlds all throughout the game
10091000	10093000	So you can just continue going to different worlds
10093000	10095000	I mean, it's an amazing game
10095000	10097000	Well, I'm going to have to check that out at some point
10097000	10099000	It does sound pretty hot
10099000	10101000	And I live for roguelikes
10101000	10103000	I'm enjoying Rogue Legacy as well, by the way
10103000	10105000	Alright, well, Codeman, I'm going to let you go
10105000	10107000	Thanks for calling in. Do you have anything you need to plug?
10107000	10109000	Want to plug before we get out?
10109000	10111000	No, not really
10111000	10113000	I mean, we still have our podcast
10113000	10115000	We still do it from time to time
10115000	10117000	We've mostly moved to YouTube
10117000	10119000	We do Google Hangouts
10119000	10121000	But it's the YouTube.com
10121000	10123000	Backslash The Down For Maintenance podcast
10123000	10125000	Well, I think it's like the DFM podcast
10125000	10127000	But you can look us up on YouTube
10127000	10129000	And then I have a YouTube channel
10129000	10131000	But, I mean, it's really hard to remember
10131000	10133000	I mean, it's YouTube.com
10133000	10135000	Backslash C. Taylor 1785
10135000	10137000	Because YouTube won't let me change it
10137000	10143000	But, yeah, you should do more Let's Plays, Rob
10143000	10146000	You know, I was gifted by a kind listener
10146000	10148000	Another scary game called Paranormal
10148000	10151000	And that is up on the list of things I need to play, too
10151000	10153000	Holy crap, that game is fantastic
10153000	10155000	I hate it and love it all at the same time
10155000	10157000	I'm not sure if I'm looking forward to it
10157000	10159000	Alright, Codeman, I'm going to let you go, buddy
10159000	10161000	Alright, well, I'll talk to you guys later
10161000	10162000	Alright, take care
10162000	10163000	Alright, bye
10163000	10165000	Alright, and our phones are lighting up
10165000	10167000	We've got another call coming in right now
10167000	10168000	So let's go to the phones
10168000	10169000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio
10169000	10170000	Who's this?
10170000	10171000	This is Shane
10171000	10172000	Hey, Shane, how you doing?
10172000	10175000	I'm hot, it's like really hot here right now
10175000	10176000	Isn't it like
10176000	10178000	You should come to California
10178000	10179000	Isn't it hotter there?
10179000	10180000	Yeah, probably
10180000	10182000	But not at night, so come here
10182000	10184000	Yeah, maybe
10184000	10186000	We're not Phoenix or anything, and it's a dry heat
10186000	10187000	Phoenix is terrible
10187000	10188000	It is terrible
10188000	10189000	What's up?
10190000	10191000	Pokemon
10191000	10195000	Oh, did you hear my little dedication to you earlier?
10195000	10198000	Yeah, I take some issues with that dedication
10198000	10200000	Why?
10200000	10202000	Well, first of all, you ended it too quick
10202000	10205000	Like, there's never enough time to talk about Pokemon
10205000	10209000	Like, okay, for example, my job today
10209000	10212000	I had a demo and I was demoing the new Mario and Luigi game
10212000	10214000	And all the people that showed up
10214000	10216000	Pretty much just wanted to talk Pokemon with me
10216000	10218000	Which I was fine with, that was fun
10218000	10220000	Way more fun than demoing a game
10220000	10232000	But, yeah, like, I don't like the thought that it should have stopped after 151 Pokemon
10232000	10234000	Sorry, Jamie
10234000	10238000	Just because, like, that would have been boring
10238000	10240000	You have to keep the series going
10240000	10244000	And if you only had those same 151 were, like, 15 years now
10244000	10246000	Or something like that since they first came out
10246000	10248000	That would have been terrible
10248000	10252000	So, yeah, we're at 649 plus whatever new ones are in here
10252000	10254000	But it's still really fun
10254000	10258000	And these mega evolutions, like the new trailer that was posted is awesome
10258000	10260000	And it reminds me of Power Rangers
10260000	10261000	So I am on board
10261000	10262000	Wait a minute
10262000	10263000	100% on board
10263000	10265000	Wait a minute, because the other night you said, I don't know
10265000	10269000	I know, but then they put a trailer that made it look like Power Rangers to me
10269000	10271000	And that is all you need to do
10272000	10276000	If there is more blue in the trailer and maybe some Taco Bell
10276000	10278000	Which I'm still kind of boycotting
10278000	10280000	Wait, you're boycotting Taco Bell?
10280000	10282000	Yes, they got rid of some stuff I liked
10282000	10285000	Uh-oh, that's right, they got rid of the volcano stuff, I forgot
10285000	10287000	Yeah, and I really liked that
10287000	10288000	We had this conversation the other night
10288000	10290000	Fifth Dream in our chat room with a question for Shane
10290000	10293000	Hey, they don't ask us questions anymore, they ask the caller's questions
10293000	10296000	Fifth Dream wants to know, Shane, did you watch any of the Pokemon Championships?
10296000	10298000	Yes, and I didn't want to
10298000	10301000	I was just really bored, I was like, okay, this will be fun
10301000	10303000	And that's my sarcastic voice
10303000	10305000	So I put it on, it was so fun
10305000	10307000	Like, it was really fun to watch
10307000	10311000	And I watched some of the finals today before work
10311000	10314000	And I was getting excited and there was no reason to
10314000	10317000	And I feel like it was when I liked basketball
10317000	10319000	When the NCAA tournament was going on
10319000	10322000	Like, I just got sucked in and it was amazing
10322000	10326000	Was it the Pokemon card game?
10326000	10329000	They had the card game later today, which I was at work for
10329000	10332000	So I couldn't watch that, it was the actual video games
10332000	10335000	Wow, and Nintendo let them stream it?
10335000	10338000	Well, because it's Nintendo sponsored
10338000	10341000	Me and my friend Danny, we want to go to next year's championships
10341000	10343000	It's in DC, this year was in Vancouver
10343000	10346000	But they get all sorts of cool stuff
10346000	10348000	They have all this merchandise
10348000	10351000	And things that you won't find anywhere else
10351000	10353000	Just at the World Championships
10354000	10359000	And like today, or yesterday, they announced a new mega evolution
10359000	10362000	And that they haven't put out anywhere else
10362000	10365000	And they announced that they're going to have a soundtrack out on iTunes
10365000	10368000	This November for X and Y, it's going to have 220 tracks
10368000	10369000	Good lord
10369000	10371000	Like, yeah, that's ridiculous
10371000	10372000	Oh my gosh
10372000	10373000	And I will have it day one
10373000	10377000	So, what's the countdown to X and Y at this point?
10377000	10378000	How many days left?
10378000	10381000	It's like, almost exactly two months
10381000	10382000	Tomorrow will be two months
10382000	10384000	But for me, I don't know, because I'll get it early
10384000	10387000	So, sucks to be everybody else
10387000	10390000	At least you have Final Fantasy XIV to hold you over, right?
10390000	10391000	Yes, yes
10391000	10393000	And I learned today, 100%
10393000	10396000	Because they put some sort of graph out
10396000	10398000	That if I get the PS3 collector's edition
10398000	10400000	Which I'm getting through Amazon, because I had gift cards
10400000	10402000	So it's fully paid off
10402000	10405000	And I apply it to my current PC account
10405000	10407000	I will be able to play on both
10407000	10409000	For the free 30 days
10409000	10411000	And because I'm an old player
10411000	10414000	My 30 days won't kick in until September 10th
10414000	10417000	So I'll have from the 24th of August till September 10th
10417000	10419000	Not paying anything
10419000	10423000	And then September 11th for the next 30 days for free as well
10423000	10424000	Hmm
10424000	10425000	There you go
10425000	10427000	And you get all that collector's edition crap that you don't need
10427000	10430000	Um, don't need?
10430000	10432000	That's rude
10432000	10434000	Well, what's in there that you need?
10434000	10436000	The book, the art book is going to be fantastic
10436000	10438000	The baby soundtrack
10438000	10440000	Because the other soundtrack is just way too expensive
10440000	10442000	And I don't have anything that can play it except for a PS3
10442000	10444000	Even though I want the little pet
10444000	10446000	And um
10446000	10448000	The box
10448000	10450000	Okay, it's the box
10450000	10452000	That's acceptable to say, right?
10452000	10454000	Like, because the box looks cool
10454000	10456000	Alright, fair enough
10456000	10458000	Yes, exactly
10458000	10460000	Alright, Shane, anything else before we let you go?
10460000	10462000	Um, everybody should watch that new trailer
10462000	10465000	It has like rock music that plays during it
10465000	10467000	And it's like remixed, I think, of a gym theme
10467000	10471000	And seriously, if it doesn't remind you of Power Rangers
10471000	10473000	Which is what I'm seeing from everybody's comments
10473000	10475000	Everywhere on the internet that I'm looking right now
10475000	10477000	You're crazy
10477000	10479000	Because the end with the five of them lined up
10479000	10481000	And their mega evolutions is totally Power Rangers
10481000	10483000	It's awesome
10483000	10485000	Alright, anything you want to plug while you're here on the show?
10485000	10487000	Um
10487000	10489000	Well, I just plugged Pokemon X and Y
10489000	10491000	And we talked about Final Fantasy XIV
10491000	10493000	Um
10493000	10495000	Yes, sure
10495000	10497000	Apparently, there's a really cool Konami game in Japan
10497000	10499000	Called Sound Vortex
10499000	10501000	And I've watched videos and it's awesome
10501000	10503000	Somebody, I guess, cracked it
10503000	10505000	So you can play on your PC
10505000	10507000	And there are websites now building controllers
10507000	10509000	For the Sound Vortex game that you can buy
10509000	10511000	That you'd be able to hook up to your PC and play it
10511000	10513000	And that game is so cool looking
10513000	10515000	You need to link me this
10515000	10517000	I need to get a link to Sound Vortex
10517000	10519000	Or for the controller
10519000	10521000	The controller is like $300 and some dollars
10521000	10523000	I can link you the gameplay
10523000	10525000	It's amazing
10525000	10527000	Alright, get on the case, Nancy Drew
10527000	10529000	Uh, my name is Shane
10529000	10531000	Alright, bye, Shane
10531000	10533000	Bye
10533000	10535000	1877 Game OLR
10535000	10537000	Our username on Skype is
10537000	10539000	OrangeLoungeRadio
10539000	10541000	Going to some tweets real quick
10541000	10543000	I'm going to do these pretty quick here because we're running kind of late tonight
10543000	10545000	Dark Tetsuya sends the show a tweet that says
10545000	10547000	Hey, just a note, the latest version of
10547000	10549000	Super Mario Crossover, or 3.0
10549000	10551000	Is now out and it's available at
10551000	10553000	ExplodingRabbit.com
10553000	10555000	Did they do a Kickstarter for that one?
10555000	10557000	No, they did a Kickstarter for their game that's not quite
10557000	10559000	That game, but it's
10559000	10561000	All the characters changed is slightly
10561000	10563000	Renamed and their own original levels
10563000	10565000	Got it, got it
10565000	10567000	Act F says
10567000	10569000	The King of Fighters XIII Steam Edition
10569000	10571000	Trailer was leaked in the Steam store
10571000	10573000	And removed
10573000	10575000	So King of Fighters XIII probably coming
10575000	10577000	To Steam at some point
10577000	10579000	TigerClaw sent us a tweet
10579000	10581000	Imagi Studios originally was going to make
10581000	10583000	A Legend of Zelda movie, check out the short movie
10583000	10585000	Pitch video and he linked us to YouTube
10585000	10587000	I actually did see this earlier in the week
10587000	10589000	And it did look pretty cool
10589000	10591000	Although there was no, I don't believe there was any voices
10591000	10593000	In it, but it did, it looked interesting
10593000	10595000	But you know, Nintendo
10595000	10597000	Is crazy possessive over their IPs
10597000	10599000	Ever since that Super Mario Brothers movie was a
10599000	10601000	Stink bomb, so I'm not
10601000	10603000	Surprised they didn't get to go forward with it
10603000	10605000	But it sure made a great little YouTube to look at
10605000	10607000	Did you guys see that at all?
10607000	10609000	The little concept, the Zelda pitch
10609000	10611000	No, it was neat
10611000	10613000	Alright, I'll give it one more minute
10613000	10615000	To see if anybody's going to call in, but if not
10615000	10617000	We'll close up shop, 1-877-GAME-OLR
10617000	10619000	Or our username on Skype is
10619000	10621000	OrangeLoungeRadio, anybody else
10621000	10623000	Have a last minute story for us tonight?
10623000	10625000	Well, actually
10625000	10627000	Not necessarily a story, but I'm going to
10627000	10629000	Start making my 3DS
10629000	10631000	Cases, and put them
10631000	10633000	Available to sell before too long
10633000	10635000	Is that an Etsy thing?
10635000	10637000	I might do it on Etsy, either that or Storenvy
10637000	10639000	I'm still deciding
10639000	10641000	And why would somebody want a 3DS case from Dark Sakura?
10641000	10643000	Because they are well made and protect your system
10643000	10645000	A lot better than this flip up in cases do
10645000	10647000	Fair enough, alright
10647000	10649000	We do have one more call coming in, this will probably be the last one
10649000	10651000	For tonight, so let's go to it
10651000	10653000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
10653000	10655000	Hello
10655000	10657000	Hello
10657000	10659000	It's OrangeLoungeRadio
10659000	10661000	Hello
10661000	10663000	This is HeyacDeft
10663000	10665000	HeyacDeft, and we see you, it's a video call
10665000	10667000	Hi
10667000	10669000	Hello
10669000	10671000	Is that a My Little Pony?
10671000	10673000	No, it's a Pokemon
10673000	10675000	Oh, it's a Pokemon
10675000	10677000	Uh oh, Shane's going to kill me for that one too
10677000	10679000	You know, I need to get my plus and minus ones back from Julian
10679000	10681000	Send them to Shane
10681000	10683000	Which Pokemon is that?
10683000	10685000	It's the Pokemon Black and White
10685000	10687000	Legendary Rusharound
10687000	10689000	Oh, okay, alright
10690000	10693000	So you just call in tonight to show off your plushie?
10693000	10695000	Not really, I want to talk about
10695000	10697000	Pac-Man Z DX Plus
10697000	10699000	Ah, the game that
10699000	10701000	Alan was talking about earlier, right?
10701000	10703000	Yeah, I'm pretty excited about it
10703000	10705000	Because I'm a fan of
10705000	10707000	Pac-Man Z
10707000	10709000	I played the hell out of it
10709000	10711000	I even got in the
10711000	10713000	In the beginning
10713000	10715000	When it was released
10715000	10717000	I was in the top 40 scores
10717000	10719000	That game
10719000	10721000	Yeah, like I said, I played it a lot
10721000	10723000	Like, a freaking lot
10723000	10725000	So I'm pretty excited
10725000	10727000	To have
10727000	10729000	Or at least being able to play
10729000	10731000	DX because what I have
10731000	10733000	Seen about it, it seems pretty
10733000	10735000	Damn cool
10735000	10737000	And mostly
10737000	10739000	The reason
10739000	10741000	I haven't even
10741000	10743000	Been able to play it
10743000	10745000	It's because
10745000	10747000	It's not available in Mexico
10747000	10749000	For some reason
10749000	10751000	I don't know why
10751000	10753000	So I'm pretty stoked that it's coming to Steam
10753000	10755000	Even since the
10755000	10757000	Announcement
10757000	10759000	It was a few months ago
10759000	10761000	I don't remember when exactly
10761000	10763000	But I'm pretty excited
10763000	10765000	To see it now
10765000	10767000	Being able to
10767000	10769000	Purchase ahead
10769000	10771000	Not to say pre-purchase or pre-order
10771000	10773000	Hahahaha
10773000	10775000	You got everybody trained, DarkSagra
10775000	10777000	What?
10777000	10779000	He took great care to make
10779000	10781000	Sure he said purchase ahead
10781000	10783000	Yes, which is how it should be
10783000	10785000	Because it's wrong to put
10785000	10787000	Unnecessary prefix
10787000	10789000	Didn't you listen to George Carlin?
10789000	10791000	Geez, Rob
10791000	10793000	How dare I speak up
10793000	10795000	The only sad part is that
10795000	10797000	We have to wait at least
10797000	10799000	One month and a half
10799000	10801000	To be able to play it since it releases
10801000	10803000	On the 25th
10803000	10805000	So yeah, but
10805000	10807000	The extra content will be
10807000	10809000	Pretty good too
10809000	10811000	The Rally Access skin
10811000	10813000	The Dick Duck skin
10813000	10815000	There's even old school
10815000	10817000	Pac-Man skin
10817000	10819000	So that's gonna be pretty cool
10819000	10821000	I just love that this game is how old
10821000	10823000	And they're still supporting it
10823000	10825000	Like this was really a pleasant surprise
10825000	10827000	Because it was at the point where the game was
10827000	10829000	Plus, I mean I had it on 360 anyway
10829000	10831000	But now I have it on PlayStation
10831000	10833000	Because why not, it was free
10833000	10835000	So I picked it up there too to try and get some trophies
10835000	10837000	And now it's pretty cool to know that, oh okay
10837000	10839000	Now I can get this DLC
10839000	10841000	Which maybe that's the reason they were giving it away for free
10841000	10843000	Was to try and make a sale there
10843000	10845000	But, eh, it'll work
10845000	10847000	It'll work
10847000	10849000	Yeah, they sure have gotten a sale out of me
10849000	10851000	Alright
10851000	10853000	Well, anything else you're looking forward to this year?
10853000	10855000	Well, mostly this coming week
10855000	10857000	Like DuckTales
10857000	10859000	Like everyone else
10859000	10861000	I bet Codeman's happy to hear that
10861000	10863000	What system are you getting DuckTales on?
10863000	10865000	Most possibly Steam, but I'm still debating on it
10865000	10867000	Okay
10867000	10869000	Very cool
10869000	10871000	Alright, well Act F, we're gonna let you go so we can wrap up the show
10871000	10873000	But thank you and your little Pokemon there for calling in
10873000	10875000	Who's waving goodbye, adorable
10875000	10877000	Alright, bye Act F, thanks for the call
10877000	10879000	We love the video calls, take care
10879000	10881000	Alright, that's gonna do it
10881000	10883000	Shane never answered my question
10883000	10885000	I'm just gonna see if he wanted my giant Togepi
10885000	10887000	He probably turned the show off, so don't give it to him
10887000	10889000	But you know what?
10889000	10891000	Did I tell you how I got my giant Togepi?
10891000	10893000	I got held up at gunpoint
10893000	10895000	Working at GNC
10895000	10897000	Oh god, yeah, that's a horrible story
10897000	10899000	And I found $10 in the parking lot outside Toys R Us
10901000	10903000	And I went in
10903000	10905000	And I used it to buy myself a giant Togepi
10905000	10907000	The $20 Togepi
10907000	10909000	You earned it
10909000	10911000	And so my giant Togepi
10911000	10913000	Was like my comfort creature thing
10913000	10915000	And my Charmander pillow
10915000	10917000	Well we have to wrap up the show
10917000	10919000	Guys, it's about that time
10919000	10921000	We're running a little long tonight
10921000	10923000	And Alan and I still have errands to run after the show
10923000	10925000	So we're gonna wrap up the show
10925000	10927000	I wanna start with Alan tonight
10927000	10929000	Thank you very much for being here tonight
10929000	10931000	Really appreciate you being on the show
10931000	10933000	And lending your wit
10933000	10935000	And so forth, don't be a stranger
10935000	10937000	You only live here
10937000	10939000	So do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
10939000	10941000	Um
10941000	10943000	If I can get my headset replaced
10943000	10945000	I might start doing like an achievement run
10945000	10947000	In Half Life for Twitch TV
10947000	10949000	Fun!
10949000	10951000	You think it's time to go wireless?
10951000	10953000	I don't know, I've had bad experiences with wireless
10953000	10955000	Do you have like a Twitter you wanna plug?
10955000	10957000	Or anything you wanna plug if people wanna
10957000	10959000	Get your wit online? Because you are really funny
10959000	10961000	I actually am on Twitter a lot now
10961000	10963000	I finally got Twitter
10963000	10965000	How it works
10965000	10967000	I always just ignore it
10968000	10970000	Okay
10970000	10972000	It's very salacious
10972000	10974000	Alright
10974000	10976000	Loki, sorry we didn't get to all the last minute news
10976000	10978000	But we're trying to wrap up
10978000	10980000	It's been a long show, it's almost 9.30
10980000	10982000	Do you have any last minute thoughts for our listeners tonight?
10982000	10984000	Uh
10984000	10986000	No, not really
10986000	10988000	And I will say my final thought tonight
10988000	10990000	Is I better be over this damn cold tomorrow
10990000	10992000	Because I need to get back to work
10992000	10994000	I have a ton of work to catch up on for being sick
10994000	10996000	For two days
10996000	10998000	One plague can kiss my ass
10998000	11000000	Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight
11003000	11005000	I want a house
11005000	11007000	And a job
11008000	11010000	Probably in that order
11010000	11012000	In that order
11012000	11014000	By the way
11014000	11016000	My cat is the cutest animal in the universe
11016000	11018000	Um, next to Sanrio, yes
11018000	11020000	Do you know what the next Pink Berry flavor's gonna be?
11020000	11022000	Peanut butter
11022000	11024000	No, that's out now
11024000	11026000	Butter pecan
11026000	11028000	Girl
11028000	11030000	You know what, they need to start paying advertising on this program
11030000	11032000	For us to keep talking about them
11032000	11034000	Alright, in all seriousness, thank you for staying with our show tonight
11034000	11036000	And listening to the show
11036000	11038000	After a week off, we really appreciate you sticking with us

11040000	11042000	And if for whatever reason
11042000	11044000	You listened to this entire show and you thought it was terrible
11044000	11046000	Hey, that's okay
11046000	11048000	Just all we ask is, find another great
11048000	11050000	Independent podcast producer and support that
11050000	11052000	Support all of our independent podcast friends

11070000	11072000	And Disney Infinity next Sunday
11072000	11074000	I'm sure there'll be plenty of new stuff to talk about
11074000	11076000	Oh, I'll probably have Saints Row by then
11076000	11078000	Final Fantasy XIV beta as well
11078000	11080000	There'll be lots and lots of stuff next week
