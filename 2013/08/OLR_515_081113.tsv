13834	19298	Tonight, August 11th, 2013, could Valve finally be making a sequel with a 3 in it?
19779	25343	One department store ad teases a Vita price drop, and is Amazon working on a new gaming console?
31724	36465	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36546	42907	It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 515 for this August 11th, 2013.
43368	52010	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here to talk about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, gaming lulz, gaming insert whatever here with my co-host.
52210	54651	Say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
54871	55291	Rar.
55551	56132	Hey, how you doing?
56392	57132	I'm unemployed again.
57672	58393	I'm sorry to hear it.
58713	59935	That's no fun.
59955	63158	I feel better about it once the situation became clearer to me.
63339	63619	I see.
63659	66522	So it was one of those, maybe we are better off seeing other people.
66662	67483	Let's just put it this way.
67623	72909	I don't want to work for a hypocritical conservative Christian company that ruins other people's businesses.
73110	78776	Well, it is important to work for an employer that you can kind of get behind their values and all that stuff.
80036	87739	They had a really good environment there, but once I found out a bit more about them, I really started to feel very uncomfortable.
88220	90881	I was like, what's that sticker on your car?
90941	92181	What's that equal mean?
92721	94442	Oh, it's for the human rights campaign.
94562	95963	I support gay rights.
97163	97343	Oh!
98544	99384	Next day, fired.
100925	101885	That's pretty much how it went.
102866	104447	I'm not laughing at you.
104507	106128	I'm just laughing at the awkwardness of that.
106148	107088	It's quite awkward.
107329	111831	That and also actually requesting the major Jewish holidays off that morning.
112472	114153	And they said, oh, we made the decision this morning.
114173	115074	You're just not a good fit.
115894	116535	Oh, dear.
116895	119316	So I'm not actually openly accusing them of anything.
119376	121498	I'm just saying that those are the circumstances.
121846	124287	Well, you can just work for vognetwork.com full time.
124627	124948	You know what?
125008	126488	If it paid me, I would be more than happy to.
126548	127949	Except, oh yeah, there's that.
128149	128669	Sorry about that.
128769	129470	We don't have a budget.
129670	130030	Oopsies.
130330	132251	All right, say hello as well to Tech Master Loki.

134632	134953	Yeah.
134973	136293	And what are you doing over there, Loki?

264058	265579	Everybody say hello to Alan Alkemy.
265819	266219	Hello.
266439	267059	How you doing, Alan?

267860	268260	You're great.
268280	269740	I just want to make sure we can hear you tonight.
269780	270680	So how have you been lately?
270941	271481	I've been all right.
271661	271921	Yeah?
272141	274622	Decided to finally guest on the show again after like a year.
274842	276082	Yeah, gracing us with your presence.
276122	276762	It's appreciated.
276782	277283	All right.
277363	278303	What's new with you personally?
278803	279164	Not much.
279724	291376	Usually when I'm either working, I work swing shift, so I'll listen to OLR from work, or when I'm not working and you guys are all here doing the show, I'll kind of just play video games in the office or fold laundry or just be domestic.
292096	294118	So I decided I'd sit in on the show tonight.
295500	300705	I know we're going to talk about your gaming week a little bit later, but in general, what kind of games have you been catching up on lately?
301403	328975	most of the stuff if it has a Steam trading card thing in it then I've checked it out either a little bit or you know that trick if you don't want to play the game you can just let it run and then go take a shower go watch TV and come back when have your cards drop so you got sucked into this whole Steam trading card thing too like I did what what what's the allure of it it's just it appeals to my sort of OCD completionist
330868	331208	Yeah.
332449	335411	And the thing is, is you can earn each badge like five times.
335451	340034	So once you earn, once you go like, yeah, I got all the cards, carry badges, okay, now do it again.
340715	341655	Steam's like, do it again.
343336	344937	Put some money in your wallet, buy the cards.
345158	355004	I am eligible for the booster packs for like, I think, 13 or 14 games, and I still have about maybe 15, 16 more that I still need to play to get the things to drop.
355645	356725	Not a single booster pack yet.
357286	357646	I'm so glad.
357666	360608	Yeah, I have not gotten anything either, but then again, I haven't really been playing much.
360988	362409	I got my second one yesterday.
362429	363769	Yeah, I'm pressed like a panini.
363829	364310	I hate you.
365710	367851	I have a foil card for Saints Row the Third.
367951	368351	Oh, nice.
368371	369772	You can sell those for a little more money.
369892	375055	I forgot who I was talking to, but someone needed all three of the only cards that I had, so I'm just like, here, take them.
375395	377896	Wait, how did you get a foil card if you haven't got any booster packs?
378036	379937	It was one of my randoms that I got.
379957	380257	Really?
380377	381357	Oh, I didn't know that could happen.
381377	382598	Those will drop, yeah.
382718	382818	Oh.
382838	385699	Okay, well, that's never happened to me, so that's something you have up on me.
385719	386840	There you go.
387341	390142	See, the problem is I don't know where to buy and sell those cards.
390583	391983	It's the community marketplace.
392123	393184	Yeah, I have no idea how to get to that.
393224	393644	Oh, it's easy.
394405	395625	Believe me, they make it easy.
395685	397066	Yeah, we can show you.
397206	405230	It's really a brilliant thing if you make about it, and it totally plays to people like Alan, and myself, admittedly, who have that OCD need to collect something.
405390	405770	Why?
406291	407211	Because you can.
407451	407832	Because...
411627	413188	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
438686	441008	Yes, he wanted to review it for Horde House.
441048	447914	And to be fair, that was Actdeft kind of poking at him, which he's been kind of poking all of us for a while going, hey, play Team Fortress 2.
448154	449215	Hey, play Team Fortress 2.
449956	452858	And then Phil from Koopa Club, I think, got in on that a little bit.
452918	453999	Hey, play Team Fortress 2.
454279	454540	Play it.
454620	454840	Do it.
454900	455120	Do it.
455500	456882	And finally, X4 was like, fine.
456962	457462	Is it free?
457602	458283	Yes, I'll try it.
458783	487537	and so we all played one night on I guess Actdeft has this server abandoned server he knew of so a bunch of us played on there and loved it we had so much fun like it was just so much fun just sitting there blowing people up and it was great because you don't have to worry that you're not good enough or that people are gonna yell it was just a lot of like-minded people having a good time just shooting the shit out of each other and I was like oh I gotta get us a server we need our own server we need a VOG server for this we have a Minecraft server sometimes why can't we have a Team Fortress 2 server
487737	488437	as a trial run.
488597	488817	Yeah.
488958	489418	Test it out.
489738	494020	So I remembered I had like $100 sitting in a PayPal account somewhere I hadn't used.
494420	495320	So I was like, all right.
495840	498681	Oh, just a random hundred sitting aside.
498742	499862	All my money.
500202	502443	When he pointed it out, I was like, that must be nice.
502803	503884	Well, you know what, though?
504024	508005	It's the modern day equivalent of burying it in your backyard.
508465	510966	And I was like, you know, you haven't been earning interest on that in a year and a half.
510986	511707	It's been stuck in there.
513846	514787	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
528926	531007	on our website, vognetwork.com.
531428	535510	Look at the forums and you can check out the information.
535550	536530	It's in the video games forum.
536631	538091	All the info you need about the server is there.
538452	545516	You might need a little help with the password, but let me just remind you guys, we used to have a little mascot, a little ferret on the show.
546196	548678	It's on my bedside table sitting on Duffy's head.
548718	550158	Yes, Dark Sakura abducted it.
550879	551899	It doesn't work anymore.
552560	554841	And no, Actdeft, I do not have the hero's cap.
554881	555221	I need it.
555822	557943	Just in case you need that information when you look at the post.
558416	568821	And it is password protected, but if you ever check it out, like in your Steam client, you see a bunch of jerks on there with screen names that you don't recognize, make sure to let Rob know and he can spin the password to something else.
569001	579846	Absolutely, because we want it to be the welcoming environment for people that are like, I want to play Team Fortress 2, but I don't know anybody, and I'm not very good at shooters, and da-da-da.
580126	581467	No one's really good at Team Fortress 2.
581507	581707	Yeah.
582327	583007	It's too fast.
583047	588849	It makes me feel old because I was the soldier class with the shotgun and I was in the same room with someone strafing.
589249	591930	I couldn't hit someone with a shotgun and they killed me.
592130	593371	I was like, I have a shotgun in your face.
593411	593951	I can't hit you.
594111	598112	I feel a little silly that I'm just now getting into this game that's like, what, five years old, right?
598132	599253	It came out with Orange Box, right?
599513	604414	I think I played it like a little bit on Orange Box on 360, but it's not even the same like now on PC, you know?
604454	605435	It just feels so different.
605835	605955	So...
608189	611053	I should probably play that, but I've had other things on my plate
627373	642260	uh definitely some more games throughout the week Alan and I would love to play tonight but we have errands to run after the show but that doesn't that might not stop other people from playing after the show so um Actdeft in our chat room says Team Fortress 2 is around seven years old oh my gosh really holy moly all right
642980	650483	Speaking of other games and things, DarkSakura, I guess it's bugging out right now, but you were trying to open your Animal Crossing town.
650723	653164	I had three people in there and the connection crashed.
653464	657146	I'm going to open it one more time, but if it does it again, I'm going to have to leave it closed for the rest of the show.
657506	660827	Because our primary concern is keeping our bandwidth open.
660927	661947	That is, so we don't want to.
662087	664048	But it would be fun if you want to go visit Jamie.
664528	665929	You got the VOG pattern, right?
666289	668970	I did, but it won't let me put it on, so I think I just have to recreate it.
669230	671192	Well, Bobby's pattern is probably better anyway.
673015	676479	But no, I actually can't use something that I got from somebody else.
676899	677800	I'll have to make it myself.
678100	678321	Don't.
678941	679262	It's fine.
680416	682478	All right, so there's that Animal Crossing going on.
682518	684559	And then Minecraft coming back at some point, right, Loki?
684799	685860	Yeah, I want to get around to it.
686020	686221	All right.
686641	689803	So we want to know, what other games should VOG have a server for?
689903	690644	We'll look into it.
690684	693906	If you have a serious request, something that we ought to check out, let us know.
694307	696348	Free-to-play is really good, too.
696989	699971	That's what makes Team Fortress 2 so great, because it's free-to-play.
700472	702533	And people even make a little money off it, right?
702573	704355	Getting the item drops and crafting and all that.
704535	708598	I mean, not anything to write home about, but, you know, something to buy trading cards with, right?
710299	713483	GamerX was a Kickstarter-backed convention.
729602	735346	to really just be a safe place for GLBT gamers.
735446	739948	But it's really important to know the con was not only for GLBT gamers.
739968	741309	And I think I went on this tangent.
741349	747392	It might have been on Horde House, but it always pissed me off when I heard people going, well, where's our straight gamer convention?
747432	749333	Why can't we have a straight gaming convention?
749954	751575	And I'm like, well, okay.
751595	752935	That's what YowieCon is for girls.
754196	766773	When y'all are getting disowned by your parents and getting lost past in states that affect your lifestyle and people are bullying you and calling you names on Xbox Live, then you can have your little convention.
766793	769717	But otherwise, it's a 365 day a year convention.
770117	770678	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
787692	799618	F-A-G, F-A-G, N-word, N-word, you know, it's not... It's like, bro, when you play Halo and you have to turn off everyone else's mics because you get sick and tired of being called a breeder a hundred times a match, then come talk to us.
799678	800819	We'll talk about a straight convention.
801159	801999	I don't think that's happening.
802260	802440	Right.
803260	827469	and I mean it's I mean and it's the bullying is bad enough with gay lesbian and bisexual and and then throw transgender into it and you know my I really it was it was very eye-opening in some of those panels to kind of hear like what transgendered people go through in in games and so forth so you know it was it was really eye-opening and I had a I had a marvelous time at the convention it was honestly something I kind of never thought I would see
828769	855901	so it made me just very happy to be there I did have some small reservations it was a first time con and so there were some first time con issues but I want to just make sure I am crystal clear it was really good for a first year con like beyond really good my minor issues were one the space was too damn small although the Hotel Kabuki in San Francisco is lovely and I love that it was in Japantown so all that stuff was nearby it was just a clusterfuck of people downstairs
886611	895477	The people waiting in line plus the through traffic because, you know, people got to get from point A to point B. They don't give a shit about a panel waiting in line if they're not interested in the panel.
896277	902461	And the hallways for that were only maybe two or three people wide and the ceilings were really low, like only 10 or 11 feet.
903122	906464	So that was it was really just claustrophobic and gloomy.
906764	917789	Yeah, which, you know what, I'm sure when they looked at the space originally and kind of, you know, had their, you know, thought what it was going to be in their head, I mean, what a terrible problem to have that your con is too popular, you know?
917849	923632	So, next year, you know, they have said it's coming back next year, and I'm pretty sure they said they are looking into a bigger space.
924052	926473	Although, I don't know if that necessarily meant they were looking at a different space.
926713	928934	I kind of got the feeling that they might just spread it out more.
928994	929975	I don't know, I'm kind of...
930875	933657	The Hotel Kabuki has hosted different cons before.
934378	942744	And what they count on, I think, is that a lot of that traffic is going to start going into the Kintetsu Mall to go shopping at Kinokuniya or go get crepes or whatever.
942904	945606	Yeah, and maybe they'll spread it out across different hotels or something.
945626	948427	And Japan Video really likes it because they do a lot of business during that.
948568	950229	Oh, yeah.
950349	951790	Well, the environment was great.
952210	954171	The Japanese street fair was going on, right?
954191	957314	Yeah, the overflow for the con was always in that mall.
957474	959215	So, yeah, it was already kind of a part of the circuit.
959375	960476	They had a chiptunes DJ.
960616	961597	Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
983357	983957	That sounds cool.
984157	985138	Yeah, they were really good.
985978	987699	But the host of the evening was Pandora Box.
988079	990200	And she was a contestant on RuPaul's Drag Race Season 2.
990240	993342	Full disclosure, I loved her, rooted for her all through that season.
993882	994222	Ditto.
994462	1002406	And I've even, on the fun little side project RuPaul's Drag Race podcast I did with the Game Boy guys, I even defended her many times.
1002446	1004187	And I do love her and follow her on Facebook.
1004447	1008689	But maybe, Alan, you can describe this better than I can, what the issue was with Pandora Box.
1008959	1013203	Well, you know, it's supposed to be an inclusive convention.
1013824	1024634	A lot of people had aired concerns online that it was just going to be a bunch of white gay dudes, because that's what San Francisco is really, and we were going to shut out the BLT portion of
1025094	1025875	You know, the convention.
1025915	1031780	So she gets up there and within like a minute she's talking about, lesbians play video games?
1032141	1033642	Ew, I don't like vagina.
1033682	1034523	And everyone's laughing.
1034843	1036805	Once I was born and fell out of one, I was done.
1036825	1039327	And it's like, okay, gay men don't like pussy.
1040368	1041269	That's your joke.
1041609	1043211	Which is like really insulting.
1043831	1046434	I hate when I hear my peers say it.
1046734	1047294	It's like really...
1048464	1049064	It's like a big roast
1066173	1068974	Haha, nerds in basement, that's the first time I've ever heard that joke.
1068994	1069535	Yeah, exactly.
1070015	1071355	That's totally original.
1071435	1079019	I was just kind of like, dude, you are like the first thing at the first con of this first great thing, and that's what you're going to do with it?
1079039	1082901	And everyone in that room had donated on the, sorry, it was 100 bucks, right?
1082941	1085182	Yeah, something like that, 90, 100, something like that.
1086082	1092305	So I was just a little bit like... And then she started talking about Grindr, about how nerds are introverts, so you're all on Grindr right now, and it's like...
1092845	1094125	They'd probably be on Grindr anyway.
1095246	1096366	You're on Grindr, bitch!
1098286	1099006	So, I don't know.
1099146	1101227	I just was kind of... I was over her.
1101247	1101927	It wasn't the best.
1102587	1104447	I mean, I still am a fan of her.
1104487	1106508	I didn't go home and unfollow her on Facebook or something.
1106528	1107068	I was so mad.
1107448	1110029	But I was just like, that was a little lazy planning.
1110049	1113229	Her cosplay was good that I'm sure her team put together for her.
1113249	1115030	She didn't know what the fuck she was wearing.
1115110	1115670	Shade.
1117930	1144880	enough negative because honestly lots of positive I was just in my basement in Animal Crossing we did a panel there, Podcast Cross Zone and had a lot of fun and I just want to give a shout out in big hearts to the guys from Koopa Club from Game Bar from GameBooey.org which I'm sure everybody was reciting that URL at the end of the day after that panel to Fox Van Allen from Wow Insider and the tech
1145200	1146601	Techlicious, is that the one he writes for?
1146921	1147821	I look really stupid right now.
1147841	1150843	I forget which one he writes for, but he was a great moderator.
1151503	1157387	And the other folks that came to the panel, I was really worried no one was going to show up, y'all.
1157887	1161569	And we had a relatively full room, a few empty seats, but not a lot.
1162089	1178026	and had a great time and I was telling jokes people were laughing we were having fun with it and yes that panel should be up soon Koopa Club's gonna put it on their feed so I'll let y'all know when it's up and because it was the last panel scheduled for that room we got there you guys rather got to run long so that was good
1178522	1179923	Yeah, that was good.
1180283	1181063	And we had a great time.
1181083	1186746	That was really the highlight for me, was just getting to do what I love to do, and that's the live panels and all that.
1188427	1190247	You know, I want to go next year.
1190728	1191008	Oh, yeah.
1191108	1196050	Because I was actually trying to think of... Next year is my 20-year high school reunion.
1196150	1196590	Oh, my gosh.
1196630	1197631	Shoot me in the face already.
1198331	1203634	But I want to do one con next year, assuming I don't move to Washington.
1204815	1214140	So I was actually thinking of making that my con next year, although I have another friend that's definitely trying to get me back to Fonami for Homestuck Cosplay.
1214600	1215160	Oh, jeez.
1215841	1216521	You know what?
1217102	1222024	I wasn't going to do it at all until she's like, we need to do this, and it's better when you have two people.
1222104	1223645	I was like, fine, I'll make a costume.
1223905	1227067	I was actually going to suggest GamerX look into the San Jose Convention Center.
1227087	1231670	I mean, yes, I know that's not the heart of San Francisco, but San Jose is still the Bay Area.
1231750	1232830	It's easy to get to.
1232850	1238433	They need to check the one that YowieCon is at, which is right outside Burlingame, where I...
1239574	1240354	Right by the airport, right?
1240474	1244116	Yeah, and it was a really good venue for the convention.
1244496	1253120	Yaoi-Kan is still relatively small, and it was perfectly accommodating to everything, especially having electronic glass toys in the dealer's room.
1253701	1258723	And then they had Junkie Spot there, so I think that they need to... Did they have a dealer's room?
1259486	1260346	Yes, it was small.
1260406	1262887	Like everything for a first year con, it was very small and some tables.
1263067	1265608	I'd like to talk to the organizer, actually.
1265888	1267208	He's a pretty approachable guy.
1267468	1269009	So if you can give me that information.
1269229	1269429	Yeah.
1269709	1270950	Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.
1271310	1272390	I'm sure we can set that up.
1272510	1272770	Cool.
1273210	1274431	Yeah, I'll definitely be going next year.
1274591	1275571	I had a good time.
1275771	1283935	Yeah, we didn't do Sunday because we ended up taking a bunch of people up to our friend's place above the Castro and drinking until 3 a.m.
1283956	1286197	And we got trashed.
1286217	1287437	That was the finest night of the con.
1287537	1288858	That was the best thing we did.
1288938	1291880	I mean, it was just great to have everybody in one place like that.
1291900	1293281	It's like, who drank all this tequila?
1293381	1293861	You did.
1293901	1294561	It's 3 a.m.
1294741	1295262	Oh, shit.
1295342	1295682	So, yeah.
1295922	1298624	Junko from Koopa Club and I were doing shots of Fireball.
1298684	1300525	And you guys know how I am after one drink.
1300825	1303046	I think I had four shots of Fireball that night.
1303066	1307249	But being in an enclosed space with all those people plus the alcohol lowering your immune system.
1307269	1309670	Con crud!
1309770	1311291	Yeah, and exhaustion.
1311331	1311792	Don't forget that.
1311832	1313433	That's a big one after Clue two weeks ago.
1313453	1315474	The con crud hit Rob hard.
1315594	1320037	I have been sick since... Somehow, I didn't really come down with it until Tuesday.
1320697	1320877	DragonCon
1337196	1338137	You remember my advice.
1339838	1341539	And do not drink soda at a con.
1341599	1342560	Drink nothing but tea.
1343440	1347623	SSJ100 Matt in our chatroom says, on a scale of one to grandpa, how drunk was everyone?
1348224	1352307	Every single person was drinking except for Extifer, I believe.
1352647	1355869	Well, from what you're describing, on a scale of one to grandpa, you were on girl.
1356970	1359872	Well, Slag Kick was driving, so he didn't drink anything.
1359892	1360352	Oh, yeah, that's right.
1360372	1360953	He didn't drink either.
1361913	1362293	Good kid.
1363073	1367134	And Brad from PogCulture in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com is saying, Yay, Fireball!
1367294	1369195	And more Fireball is coming to DragonCon.
1370395	1370935	Uh-oh!
1372935	1373636	Here we go.
1373656	1377356	Now, there is something I'm making, Rob, that you should try if you like the Fireball.
1377896	1378216	What's that?
1378236	1379257	I'm making ginger rum.
1380017	1380697	Oh, my gosh.
1380897	1382537	With actual ginger and actual cinnamon.
1382897	1383378	For reals.
1383458	1384658	I wish you could come to DragonCon.
1384678	1385478	We're going to have a good time.
1385658	1386178	Well, you know what?
1386218	1386978	If someone's got money.
1388039	1389859	I actually do have places to stay.
1390467	1394629	If you are going to be in Atlanta, join us at DragonCon.
1394989	1399792	I don't know if we have the final details on the panel yet, but I'm sure Bobby will be spreading that all over the internet as soon as we know.
1399812	1406475	I think it's tentatively Sunday night, around the time that OLR would usually be, which does mean we are not going to have a show again Labor Day weekend.
1407436	1411578	I apologize because that's two shows in about a month's span that we're going to be missing, but you know what?
1412118	1414539	To do the live stuff, gotta do it.
1414959	1416800	So, it's Labor Day weekend.
1416820	1419962	I think a lot of you guys will be doing various things, conventions of your own and so forth.
1420802	1423443	Any last words on GamerX, Alan, before we get into our gaming weeks?
1423463	1424023	No, I think that was it.
1424363	1425743	Okay, Loki, did you have something to say?
1425763	1426383	Labor Day weekend?
1426884	1428204	Saints Row 4.
1429144	1429784	All day and all night.
1431385	1435426	All right, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that you've been playing this week.
1435746	1437566	I actually think we'll let Alan start tonight, our guest.
1437846	1438826	Alan, how's your gaming week?
1438986	1442427	So we're going to spend an hour on this segment because I've been playing everything.
1442447	1442907	Speed it up.
1442967	1443928	Yeah.
1444788	1449469	Really quickly, back in March and April, I was trying to play Dead Space 1 because of the hype around Dead Space 3.
1449969	1450630	It was too scary.
1450730	1451230	I chickened out.
1451250	1452171	I haven't touched it since then.
1452871	1456474	Necromorphs are terrifying, and it's claustrophobic, and it was very scary.
1457475	1462279	I also played and beat GTA 4, the main game with Nico, twice.
1462679	1464160	I beat it, and then I ran through and beat it again.
1464941	1466122	I haven't done the expansions yet.
1467122	1472607	More recently, because of the Steam trading card stuff, I've played McPixel, which I burned out.
1473027	1474007	McPixel's awesome.
1474268	1475348	Just have to add that in there.
1475448	1481671	I burnt out on it kind of fast because I was trying to get 100% on everything where you have to find all the jokes, like all of the things that you can click wrong.
1482731	1484252	Because basically there's a bomb.
1484692	1486193	It's just one screen, one room.
1486553	1487814	There's a bomb somewhere.
1488294	1488734	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1506169	1507129	Burnout on it.
1508670	1514651	I played Revenge of the Titans, which is a tower defense game, which I played for the Steam trading cards.
1515731	1524313	I don't like tower defense, so once I saw that's what it was, I was like, okay, yeah, I'm not playing this past the hour and a half it's going to take me to get my little Steam goodies.
1525454	1532635	The longest time I've ever played a tower defense game is Plants vs. Zombies, which is a great game, but I don't care.
1532835	1534636	It's kind of like Bobby with First Person Shooters.
1536322	1553378	I understand the strategy behind them, I just don't care and then the game that I really want to talk about is Hotline Miami which is phenomenal and I'm really kind of irritated that I haven't played it since I mean it came out in October and I'm just now discovering it I got it, I haven't played it yet
1554167	1558632	It's sitting in my library and I don't have it installed.
1558752	1559933	Oh, I do have it installed.
1559954	1560174	Sweet.
1560454	1560975	I haven't played it.
1561055	1562717	The music is phenomenal.
1563057	1567662	The creators of the game were inspired by that movie Drive with Ryan Gosling.
1568123	1568803	Oh, awesome.
1568964	1573689	Which is kind of like a noir, neon, kind of new 80s feel to it.
1575891	1578475	And I think they even thank the director of that movie in the credits.
1578535	1589028	Yeah, it's ultra-violent, and one thing that's great about it, aside from the flawless soundtrack, Drive was, I think, scored by Kravinsky, who's this French electro-producer.
1589448	1591631	They have a bunch of similar artists doing the soundtrack.
1591651	1592813	It's a completely Polish name.
1593253	1593513	Okay.
1595737	1598278	So yeah, the soundtrack for... Look it up on YouTube.
1598298	1598839	It's phenomenal.
1598859	1602040	I think we're going to play two of the songs from Hotline Miami during the break.
1602300	1603761	Yes, but that would only be for the live listeners.
1603781	1604462	Sorry, podcasters.
1604522	1605022	It's copyright.
1605102	1611925	Also to say, though, if people do want to see the game in action, Classic Game Room reviewed it not too long ago, and he does a really good review of it.
1611945	1612926	It shows plenty of the gameplay.
1613453	1620481	If I have time tonight, maybe I should do some livestream because I haven't played it yet at all.
1620541	1622303	It's a fast game.
1622343	1623325	It's also very hard.
1623385	1627750	It took me a while to figure out the learning curve on what the hell you're supposed to do.
1629291	1630031	What's in chat?
1630071	1634873	I'm laughing because Fifth Dream in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Oh, look, I have Hotline Miami in Steam.
1634913	1635233	Who knew?
1635633	1637233	You know, a lot of you might be saying that.
1637334	1637874	I've done that.
1637954	1640695	If you bought Humble Bundle 8, you got it.
1640995	1643035	Yeah.
1643055	1647136	And one great thing about it, it is ultra violent, which, you know, whatever.
1647597	1655499	But even just the title screen and the music that plays, there is something disturbing and really eerie about that game that they nailed.
1655519	1655739	Yeah.
1656079	1663784	There's a part halfway through the game where the player character starts to hallucinate and you start seeing dead people at the 7-Eleven or in his apartment that aren't really there.
1664685	1681697	The song that plays in your apartment at the start of each mission, I'm like, I'm uncomfortable playing this and it's not because of the violence, which does get a little out of control at times, but the creators for such a... It looks like a Super NES game, basically, really captured...
1684018	1706355	it's a very unsettling game and it's really amazing in that sense and I think that's I played some Team Fortress 2 with the gang on the VOG server and no Mass Effect 2 or 3 I kind of burn out on that not for good but I have my third and fourth Shepard and I'm like I'll finish their careers later Torchlight 2 I've been playing a lot of that Enjoying Torchlight 2?
1706912	1735378	I've hit a plateau where I'm on an overworld map that I keep dying on like I just get steamrolled and up until that point because I'm playing it on veteran which is kind of like the hard mode not elite or super insane but just veteran I was doing fine I kept quaffing my health potions I was keeping up but this one map trying to get to the other side of it where the quest marker is I just get destroyed so I need to there's no way to grind really because monsters don't respawn I'm going to have to do some co-op sometime it'll be fun
1735652	1736812	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1758115	1761998	Okay, well I told everyone they can have my pairs, it just saved me some perfect pairs.
1763239	1772785	But yeah, playing Animal Crossing, you know, I am actually back to Mass Effect 3 because I am taking my modding practice another step further.
1773786	1774527	Thanks for watching!
1795103	1822081	Even though I think the cute texture would actually work just fine But I'm thinking out loud So yeah, I'm still playing with it But I finally figured out how to do mesh replacements So that's one thing I am actually going to probably start live streaming again My playthrough of Mass Effect 3 Just so I can finish the missions I was on Because I'm like halfway through the game right now And a couple people asked me, so I might do it
1822941	1827723	Um, I also am playing Borderlands 2 with Dan.
1827743	1831704	Because Dan's like, you're gonna like it, it's gonna be fun, you won't get that sick.
1831764	1833385	And to be honest, I did not get that sick.
1833445	1840747	I had a headache by the time I was done, but I wasn't like frighteningly nauseous like I usually am with FPSs.
1841027	1851553	Which, yeah, for any new listener, just because we get new listeners every few weeks or so, you get sick from playing first-person shooters because of the motion stuff, right?
1851573	1858036	I honestly think that the sickness I was getting was with low-res polygon.
1858516	1867661	Because the game that's always done it to me worst was GoldenEye on the Nintendo 64 and the early 3D first-person shooters.
1868334	1873678	I've noticed that I'll get a little sick with Portal 2 for a while, and then I was fine.
1874158	1879742	And I'm having the same adjustment curve with Borderlands 2, so I think I might be getting over some of that.
1879882	1880622	That's good.
1881123	1884765	I still can't use my 3DS, and I think they... No, someone just left.
1886606	1893311	I still can't play the 3D mode on my 3DS unless I'm trying to catch a bug or something so I can gauge the distance.
1894071	1894252	But...
1896417	1899361	I'm also playing... What was it?
1900582	1905568	Back to playing some Drunken Robot Pornography, which is awesome.
1905769	1907311	That's the Jumping Flash-esque game, right?
1907431	1912116	The Jumping Flash with guns and dying really quickly that's a really freaking hard game.
1912156	1912957	Yeah, that game's awesome.
1914259	1914439	And...
1917730	1920751	Oh, no wonder that was Actdeft that left to go get cherries to sell at my retail.
1922352	1923073	Stay focused, girl.
1923113	1923873	Yeah, I know.
1923973	1927575	And also thank you for loaning me Kid Icarus because I really wanted to try it.
1927636	1928036	Yeah, no worries.
1928056	1929156	Just watch the hand cramping.
1929216	1930737	It's a little crazy.
1931078	1933259	Try to put it on a flat surface to play if you can.
1933686	1941014	Well, going actually back to that, I'm actually thinking about starting Bayonetta again.
1941034	1941735	Oh, that's a fun game.
1941975	1950664	Yeah, I loved it, and I didn't get too far in it, but since I've started drawing again, I haven't had the problem as quickly with my hand cramping.
1950704	1956009	I mean, it still does it, especially if I... It actually does it more if I'm writing than if I'm drawing.
1956910	1959291	So, but I've actually sat down with the controller.
1959311	1963353	I started Final Fantasy 7, which is almost impossible to play with the damn keyboard.
1964253	1966954	So I'm probably going to be... I use a 360 controller.
1967034	1968315	Yeah, we've got that.
1968515	1976918	And Dan's been playing a lot of really weird Nintendo knockoffs on the Sega Genesis emulator.
1977439	1978339	It's been hilarious.
1979039	1983281	And he actually just went through the Ballad of Gay Tony again, which is...
1983821	1985462	Really, really good for GTA.
1985722	1987102	I actually really like the story.
1989743	1993404	So between the two of us, we've actually had a pretty bustling gaming week.
1994184	2000126	Despite being, you know, working full time and then finding out hoops they don't like when you're open minded.
2001566	2002606	Anything else for your gaming week?
2004067	2004167	Um...
2006572	2008960	I know there's another game, but I can't think of it off the top of my head.
2009401	2010445	Alright, we'll jump in later.
2010565	2011187	We'll come back to you.
2011829	2012471	Loki, how about you?
2014321	2019926	See, I played a bit of Team Fortress 2 this week, and, um, what else?
2019966	2040465	Oh, Saints Row the Third, I went through, I was just trying to finish up some more achievements on the Steam version, and, uh, I went ahead and I finished off, uh, all the vehicle, uh, what was it, the, uh, cart, car theft stuff, the Saints Book vehicle stuff where you have to go collect all the vehicles and hijack them and stuff.
2040925	2041765	So I did all that.
2042105	2045646	And now I have to finish up some of the other stuff in the Saints book stuff.
2046567	2050388	One of which is the achievement of playing with both sexes.
2050528	2054949	So I have now a female character that I created just to get that achievement.
2054969	2057750	Because I've been playing mostly my male character.
2057790	2061951	So I need to get two hours out of the way on that to get the achievement.
2062351	2063011	And then...
2065752	2070296	Mostly just trying to get some of the other stuff that I've missed there.
2071997	2072698	What else did I play?
2072798	2076621	I tried playing some F-Zero GX and Dolphin just to see how well that worked.
2076941	2080664	I figured because Dolphin's been out for a long time that I should be able to run that game.
2080764	2082626	And Dolphin's an emulator.
2082726	2085328	Yeah, it's an emulator for Wii and GameCube games.
2086629	2087710	And it ran like shit.
2087950	2089231	So, oh well.
2090092	2093395	Well, remember, it takes a lot more CPU power to emulate, you know...
2094377	2095297	That actually reminded me.
2096278	2100219	I've been trying to get Planet Harriers working.
2100579	2101319	Haven't been able to yet.
2102679	2104240	And then what else did I do this week?
2104680	2109001	A little bit of Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 3 still.
2109981	2111662	Just because that's all we're playing right now.
2112822	2117083	And I pre-purchased my Saints Row 4 on Steam.
2117583	2118064	When's that out?
2118104	2118904	That's out, what, two weeks?
2118924	2121307	It's out a week from Tuesday.
2121527	2121947	Oh, wow.
2121987	2123709	So the 20th.
2123749	2125350	Have you done the character creator?
2125971	2126531	Not yet.
2126571	2137441	I haven't really, because originally on PC I was going to import my character, but because my game is modded, it won't let me upload my character to their server yet.
2137922	2143267	They're going to somehow fix that soon, that they're going to allow you to upload your modded characters just because...
2143667	2145588	The problem was they have slider mods.
2146128	2157393	I don't really have that on mine, but they have slider mods and stuff, and that can really screw up characters if you mod a character and then someone downloads that modded character without having that stuff done.
2158334	2161175	So they don't have that yet, but they're going to allow that soon.
2162956	2164877	But I was going to import that character.
2164937	2171120	So I have one for my Xbox, so I'm just going to import that into 4 because I didn't really need to mess with it yet.
2171420	2173381	All right, good luck with that project.
2189247	2213742	I'm really pumped for the release of Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn and that open beta starts a week from Friday or last Friday so it's only days away at this point there's a character creator out for XIV by the way which is also a benchmark so if you're curious about XIV at all you can download that and check it out it's free of course and you know see how that works and play with the character creator there and see what your character would look like in game and the graphics engine that's really good for that game
2214883	2217545	So, yeah, I was messing around with that.
2217705	2218806	Also, Team Fortress 2.
2219847	2222469	Visiting some older stuff in Steam just to get the cards.
2222549	2224411	Like Bastion, I actually played through.
2224471	2226793	Probably further than I did on 360 when it first came out.
2227474	2230516	You know, it's a great little game and it looks better on the PC than it did on 360.
2230796	2234720	I played that for about 20-30 minutes and was like, okay, this is neat and then I
2235421	2236882	Oh, you're missing.
2236922	2237323	It's fun.
2237483	2237883	I like that.
2237923	2238424	It's a good game.
2239425	2241507	And then I've also still been playing the MOBAs.
2241627	2244130	I can't remember if I talked about this on the last show.
2244490	2249275	I think I did a little bit, but I started getting into League of Legends and Dota 2, kind of both of them.
2249756	2250016	I don't know.
2250036	2254220	There's things I like about Dota 2, and there's things I like about League of Legends, so I'm kind of juggling them both right now, which is...
2254981	2257183	Which when you're trying to learn them is really confusing.
2257623	2261646	But there's these Dota 2 championships going on right now, which you can actually watch.
2261687	2266210	But what I like about it is that it's not necessarily just like this Twitch thing or something where you're watching a live stream.
2266570	2270514	But you can actually watch in the game client while the people are playing.
2270534	2271434	And I thought that was kind of neat.
2271835	2277119	And apparently if you pony up some cash, which goes into the pot, you can get in-game items as well with that.
2277940	2284287	Mark Laidlaw, who's the sci-fi writer who writes Half-Life, has been tweeting about it a lot.
2284407	2288832	I'll talk about him during a story that's coming up.
2289133	2291355	Valve is pretty proud of Dota 2, I'm pretty sure.
2293596	2295437	I've also been playing League of Legends.
2295737	2300338	Dota 2, I'm still mostly in the single player tutorial stuff, like doing the bot matches and all that.
2300638	2303659	But League of Legends, I am playing a lot of co-op versus bots.
2304039	2308360	I'm not playing player versus player yet because I feel like I still suck and I have a lot to learn.
2308980	2314521	Although the last match I played, last night I think it was, actually boosted my confidence quite a bit.
2314901	2319002	Which is funny because we lost a match against beginner bots once.
2319122	2338741	but I was the only person out of the five to get any kills and I actually like had like a streak going that actually kind of boosted my confidence I was like alright I do know what I'm doing compared to these four other people so how bad could it be going into a player versus player match so that'll probably be what I do next so everybody pray for me as I go into that
2339241	2340602	But that's pretty much my gaming week.
2341143	2345066	So we will start to move into news, but I do always like to take a minute for housekeeping.
2345386	2356836	Again, we will have no show over Labor Day weekend, but that's still a few weeks away because I will be in Atlanta at DragonCon, which I hope you will come by and say hi at the VOG panel, which will be Sunday night at DragonCon if you're there.
2357556	2364821	Um, also you can friend us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR and Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2364901	2365422	Be our friend.
2366022	2367163	Let's get into the news.
2367263	2371406	It's also been a bit of a slow news week, but we still got a few things we want to point out that's going on.
2371446	2372707	So Loki, why don't you start us off?
2373052	2378358	Amazon is planning on making a console that will support the Amazon Marketplace.
2395755	2400338	As far as details beyond that, no idea what it's going to be.
2401318	2409463	But basically, there's still rumors that Google's developing their own console, so I don't know.
2410264	2410624	We'll see.
2412085	2415727	They're saying that maybe we'll see it around Black Friday, but
2418806	2419126	I don't know.
2419667	2420167	It's funny.
2420187	2428152	The more and more I hear about other companies coming out with their own consoles and the specs and the features sound better, the less and less I like my Ouya.
2429073	2431695	Well, and it's also one of those things where it's like, good God, what did Ouya do?
2434537	2438941	Now I'm worried that everybody wants a piece of that because the Kickstarter was so successful.
2438981	2440843	It's like we're seeing all of these clones.
2440883	2448791	And I'm like, surely we see the end of this coming where all this crap saturates the market and then none of them do well.
2448991	2451592	I don't think it's necessarily that they're going to saturate the market.
2451672	2456654	It's just going to be... I mean, you can kind of compare that to tablets.
2457115	2460716	Oh, my God, there's so many tablets out there that saturate the market, and none of them are going to do well.
2461396	2471881	I think that's what's going to end up happening is when you get all these individual marketplaces, though, because you have Ouya, which is on its own marketplace, and Amazon, which is its own marketplace...
2472822	2480249	and, you know, the Mad Catz one, though, that is on just a regular, you know, Google Play Marketplace, so that might be okay.
2480349	2485474	And then, you know, I would assume that the Google one would be on, you know, the Google Play Marketplace.
2485995	2490299	So it's just when you start segmenting the marketplace like that, that's when you run into problems.
2491460	2506251	I mean, it's great for indie developers that want to, I guess, get their game out because now they can, you know, put it on all these marketplaces because, I mean, porting your game from, like, Android to the Amazon marketplace is basically just, you know, putting it on another marketplace because they're pretty much the same.
2508843	2526424	Yeah, it's just, and then also spec-wise, like, you know, some of these newer consoles are going to be a lot better spec-wise than, you know, the Ouya, and even, you know, the Ouya may have done okay as far as Kickstarter goes, but the way they've been handling everything, and oh, GameStick was the other one, that's another marketplace's own thing.
2527184	2550579	um and then there was the other one that was like streaming games i don't know but so still there's a ton of different options out there and at the end of the day they're all kind of offering similar things there's not a lot of exclusive stuff that you know differentiates one from the next and you know the experience isn't all that great at least for the uya right now because that's the only one that's actually to market so far um
2552772	2557575	I think this question is a bit of an eh, but other people are asking it, so I'll ask it too.
2558255	2561637	Does Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo have anything to be worried about with these consoles?
2561937	2562097	No.
2562117	2562317	Why?
2563258	2563838	Yeah, no.
2564459	2570442	I don't think that they have anything to be worried about right now, but the way things are going right now is everything kind of trending towards...
2570922	2571322	DarkSakura.com
2591532	2595733	It may not be a very powerful platform, but it's an independent platform so far.
2595753	2601175	I mean, it's still closed, but you've got to have some sort of restrictions in place so there's not rampant piracy.
2601215	2605176	Because as far as I'm aware, I don't think you can really pirate Ouya games.
2605736	2606996	Although I haven't rooted my Ouya yet.
2607396	2607637	Soon.
2608817	2611718	So I don't really know how it really treats that.
2611798	2616259	But I think that's kind of been the draw is there's all these indie games.
2617399	2618199	Thanks for watching!
2641787	2646588	The platform, they're much bigger than a startup company like Ouya or PlayStick, you know, for example.
2646668	2651289	So I think it's promising, but I'd have to see what their specs are going to be.
2651570	2657571	I mean, hell, Amazon making a console wouldn't be that crazy considering they have their own tablet.
2657651	2659692	So why not?
2660052	2661052	I could see that happening.
2662575	2665157	Alright, well, we'll see if there's any truth to this.
2665478	2674805	I think the one thing, too, I want to throw out there is that it would be interesting with Amazon because they do have all the things that are tied to Amazon Prime, such as their version of Netflix, which, you know, big deal.
2675226	2677648	All those boxes will play the streaming video things.
2678208	2678488	DarkSakura.com
2694496	2719637	but the price even of their tablets is coming down so much that I would think it'd be in their best interest not necessarily to come out with a console but to maybe come out with something that you can play your games on your tablet and then you can stream them to your TV even almost like that Google Chromecast thing and have a controller and stuff so then that way you can take it on the go and you can play with it at home and stuff
2720177	2732210	How I really wish the Wii U was kind of handled where you could, you know, that'd be awesome to have your games loaded on like a compact, not compact flash, but like, you know, some sort of, you know, flash memory or something like that.
2732491	2736155	And then that way you can play them on the go instead of having it stream from your console.
2736195	2736816	Of course, you know, that...
2737256	2742219	It's not going to work hardware-wise, but it would still be kind of cool if you could do that easily.
2742259	2756448	And I know that was something that they wanted to do with the Vita even, where you play your Vita version of MLB or you play your PS3 version of MLB and then you flip it over to the Vita and you take it on the road and that kind of stuff.
2756788	2757768	I think that would be really cool.
2758249	2758469	But...
2759565	2760367	I don't know, we'll have to see.
2760407	2761409	I mean, right now it's just a rumor.
2762271	2764136	And, I mean, hell, Apple.
2764376	2766100	I mean, that's been a rumor for the longest time.
2766220	2769708	Apple's gonna do something with Apple TV or something that turned that into a console, so.
2771440	2772660	I don't know.
2773561	2781403	All these different options, though, that are not necessarily the major console manufacturers are good options, I think, for indies.
2781743	2793287	And even now, even with the way they're opening it up a little bit for indies, especially the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 and stuff, it's a good time to be indie, I guess.
2794446	2794726	Left 4 Dead 3
2813419	2818420	Now this is a little more than, you know, well, since they did 1 and 2, a 3's gotta happen at some point.
2818460	2819201	But here's what happened.
2819841	2832324	Apparently a Valve Studio Tour was given to some folks who actually got a snapshot of somebody's computer that actually had references to... Well, it was like a changelog of everything that's been going on.
2832704	2835965	It had references to Source 2, which we know has been a thing.
2836025	2837825	Valve's openly said they're working on Source.
2837845	2839586	Yeah, so that's not really a surprise, but...
2840206	2842669	and L4D3 was also there.
2842809	2845512	So it's something that's happening.
2845812	2848394	Could that be the first game to use Source 2?
2849596	2850176	Who knows?
2850697	2852298	And not, unfortunately, Half-Life 3.
2852739	2853259	I don't know.
2854200	2859546	But apparently more thoughts come out after it that say, hey, this is actually something that is happening.
2860346	2864209	So, Alan, I'm sure you've been following this a bit.
2864249	2864750	What do you think?
2864790	2875398	Well, the Source engine, which was designed and made for Half-Life 2 originally, which is 2003-2004, anything that Valve has put out that's not Dota is on Source.
2875718	2882103	Team Fortress 2, Portal, Half-Life 2 Episode 2, it's all the modified original Source engine.
2883185	2897224	So if Source 2 is done to the point where they can release Left 4 Dead 3 on it, even if it takes another three years, if this is the product, this is the Source 2 engine running, that means Half-Life 3, they have the API that they're going to build the game on top of, so now...
2898655	2899135	Announce it.
2899335	2900436	Or should you just give up hope?
2900776	2900916	Yeah.
2901377	2910022	Mark Laidlaw, who I kind of tweeted with a couple weeks ago, he posted a vine of him in an elevator and he was kind of hovering his finger over the three button.
2910842	2911503	Hovering, hovering.
2911523	2915305	And then the last second he pushes L for lobby like he won't push three.
2915465	2917386	And I was like, ugh, like a dagger in my heart.
2918827	2923971	Uh, wasn't there something else, too, where it was like he said something about playing Pikmin 3, and you tweeted him, like, what's it like?
2924471	2929695	Yeah, he was like, uh, Pikmin 3's really good, and I was like, uh, so, Mark, what's it like to play a sequel with a 3 in it?
2929715	2930335	What's that like?
2931476	2934238	And he favorited it, and then said, uh, we're all slaves to Nintendo.
2937701	2939202	Valve Hearts Nintendo, confirmed.
2939402	2940402	Yeah.
2942044	2943505	I love Twitter for things like that.
2944325	2945146	That's why Twitter rules.
2945855	2946516	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2965044	2972988	Tiger Call in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, what if Valve is like Half-Life 3 exclusive on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 since both consoles have PC hardware?
2973008	2974328	Gabe wouldn't ever let that happen.
2975249	2977070	Gabe would have to be pushed down a flight of stairs.
2977090	2978650	Portal 2 was on PlayStation 3.
2979070	2982952	Well, I guess it was on Xbox 2, but it was way better on PlayStation 3 with the Steam integration and all that.
2983032	2984513	It was way better on Steam.
2984953	2985433	That's true.
2985654	2986494	Than anything.
2986634	2999122	I would also think too, honestly, if Steam's got this Steam bot, and I said this on the show before, I said, if they want to sell a million of those Steam boxes, make Half-Life 3 a timed exclusive to those Steam boxes and watch that shit sell.
2999142	3001644	I mean, that's all they'd have to do, right?
3001664	3002684	Yeah.
3003465	3004465	Alright, anyhow, let's move on.
3004485	3005326	More news, DarkSakura.
3005652	3012595	Well, in other news, you know how we all complain about GameStop, the evil G, as we have been calling it.
3013335	3019297	Basically, the federal judge in Camden, New Jersey said, yeah, you can sue them, go for it.
3019957	3031642	Basically saying that the games that were being sold there did not fully advertise that there might be other costs involved, like for online passes.
3033062	3039948	Which, honestly, I think the lawsuit is a little bit on the frivolous side, because it is common sense.
3040068	3046032	However, to quote a Deadpool meme, common sense, so rare it's a superpower?
3046793	3046993	Yeah.
3047733	3056220	So, because these people lack common sense, and other people agree that they shouldn't have to have common sense, GameStop is being sued.
3057955	3072140	If someone's grandma wants to get 8-year-old Timmy Modern Warfare 3 and she's trying to get herself a deal and buys it and then she gives it to him thinking that it's new or he thinks it's new and it's used and now he can't play online, she didn't know.
3072180	3073841	There wasn't a sticker on it.
3074841	3076962	It's for people buying games that don't play games.
3077222	3082964	But it's still, though, it's technically... I mean, this is a decision for the publishers.
3083344	3084884	Technically, the game is complete.
3084924	3092006	You can play the game, and sometimes even a portion of the multiplayer, but it's additional DLC that you need to purchase.
3095667	3100568	Even though it's kind of sad, is when they did this lawsuit, that now it's already fixed.
3101309	3102709	The problem is already gone, so...
3104552	3108916	I don't think it's GameStop's decision.
3109056	3113660	I don't think they should have to be responsible for something that the publisher does.
3114621	3118324	Which is ironic because EA has now said that they're doing away with online pass.
3118344	3119665	Yeah, and that's retroactive too.
3119725	3123228	So any of those games that you may buy used, they're gone.
3123308	3128913	But unfortunately, it doesn't really change in the world of lawsuit because there was a window of time when it was the case.
3129153	3136558	I want to say, if I remember correctly, I think these are the same guys that were suing Subway and actually won for the footlongs.
3136578	3136938	Did they win?
3136958	3138079	I thought that hadn't been decided yet.
3138639	3138999	Oh, okay.
3139059	3139520	I wasn't sure.
3139980	3145083	But for the footlongs being 11 inches, which, come on.
3145163	3146885	I mean, you're advertising a footlong sandwich.
3146965	3148946	A foot is fucking 12 inches.
3149306	3162513	That also raises the red flag a little bit, though, that, okay, now we're talking about a serial lawsuit type of individual, and you always kind of have to kind of raise your eyebrow at that, like, potentially abusing the system.
3164133	3171157	I think that it's something that, yeah, it's good to have on your label, but in the end...
3174946	3185699	I think people are looking for excuses to sue the moment somebody is the slightest bit put off that the first thought is sue.
3187301	3188222	And I think that
3190808	3196590	It would have been better handled by sending a letter of complaint to the company.
3196970	3197970	I don't know if they did that.
3198090	3200511	I mean, I haven't seen anything about that in the article.
3201511	3211114	But they should have, instead of just suing the company, the right step would have been contacting the company and say, Hey...
3212214	3215958	This wasn't on the label, we weren't aware of this, what can you do?
3216218	3234234	If they don't respond, then the next logical step would be Better Business Bureau Then the next logical step may be a lawsuit if they are that displeased But in the end, I really think jumping right to that conclusion is frivolous
3234653	3236034	That might be GameStop's way out of this too.
3260037	3263959	I don't understand why, and no one was forcing them to do that.
3264940	3273124	If anything, if you want to get into it, if anything, I think people should be suing fucking EA for having to pay those online passes and then them shutting the servers down.
3274865	3277406	That would be a little bit more worth merit.
3278207	3281369	Even now, it's just kind of like, okay, well, they're done with that.
3281509	3282749	It's gone, whatever.
3283190	3286071	But I don't think GameStops really should be to blame for that stuff.
3286111	3287372	You're buying a used copy.
3287392	3289473	A used copy is not the same as a new copy.
3292920	3317661	anything that you buy used is not going to be of the same quality as a new thing so I think this is going to be thrown out I think that they're not going to win it I actually think they're going to win we'll see didn't we kind of predict that this might happen when we first heard about the online pass in the first place that the consumers would not be educated on it and that this kind of thing would happen I'm almost positive it had to be said
3318098	3323786	I mean, there's two phrases that are going to be going out of, I think, common parlance soon.
3324447	3326930	One of them is, you know, the buyer beware.
3327430	3330394	And the other one's going to be shopper's remorse or buyer's remorse.
3330895	3333579	Because you can just sue now if you're remorseful over your purchase.
3334575	3339138	Dungeon Buster in our chatroom says there are people that still have trouble interpreting ESRB ratings.
3339758	3340238	That's true.
3340379	3342360	Maybe the consumer's not going to learn this stuff anytime soon.
3342800	3344261	That's why they need to rate them like they do movies.
3344581	3345522	Yeah, I agree with that.
3346302	3351725	I don't even think the ESRB is so confusing because it seems pretty, you know, it says what it is for everyone.
3352345	3356348	I understand how that's confusing, but you know... It's not to you and me.
3356528	3358549	At what point, though, I mean, like, I had this thing.
3358609	3362711	I was actually dealing with my library accounts and stuff, and we're talking about Final Fantasy XIV.
3362812	3363012	You know,
3363692	3368553	They're ordering it thinking it's a game that they can rent out or loan out to their customers.
3368673	3375374	Even though on our internal website that they order off of, there's a big fucking banner.
3376514	3378835	It's bold and there's yellow behind it.
3378855	3380375	It says, will not work.
3380835	3387096	It's like MMO, cost money to play, not recommended for renting out.
3387436	3387876	People are stupid.
3387896	3388516	They see Final Fantasy.
3388536	3389397	People will still order that.
3389417	3390997	They're like, I didn't know.
3391397	3393019	Thanks for watching!
3408158	3409580	No amount of changing your logos.
3409620	3411201	Sometimes parents just don't understand.
3411361	3413163	Sometimes just parents don't give a shit.
3413343	3413884	You know, that's it.
3413984	3416546	Or consumers don't give a shit and they're whatever.
3416927	3418949	They're not going to learn.
3419209	3423393	What it is, and this is, I hate to say it, my mother is a prime example of this.
3424674	3427237	and actually there are psychological studies going behind this.
3427277	3438851	People get comfortable with a certain idea and anything that supports their idea even if it is wrong gives them basically a happy chemical response.
3439291	3441414	That's why there's a lot of stupid Republicans out there.
3443456	3443676	Wow.
3444497	3445818	Well, that's why Rush Limbaugh exists then.
3448079	3449380	But it goes either way.
3449500	3458806	The moment that something is said that's contrary to this idea that is imprinted into their minds, it of course forms an opposite response.
3459066	3461967	The first instinct is not to listen to it, is to dismiss it.
3462588	3465029	Even if it might save them money in the long run.
3465109	3471293	And then when they go back to suffer the consequences of it, of course, oh, well, nobody told me that's because you have a selective fucking memory.
3473655	3482860	Alright, I wanted to go to another comment in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com from ShadowNextChan who says, there was some good GameStop news this week too.
3483900	3486342	I'm assuming that's the reprinting of Xenoblade, right?
3487102	3489323	Oh yeah, that came across my Twitter, that has to be it.
3489343	3490804	Yeah, that has to be the good GameStop news.
3490844	3496167	Someone, and I'm sorry if you're in chat and I just blanked on who it was, but someone on my Twitter feed posted...
3496887	3505555	Xenoblade Chronicles used and it was $80 used from GameStop and if they're reprinting it they have to redo that used.
3505955	3509898	I had no idea that the printing was that limited and it should have just been GameStop exclusive.
3510259	3513241	It's weird that they're reprinting it too when the Wii isn't really being pushed right now.
3513261	3516824	It's supposed to be all about the Wii U but I mean... You can play it in the Wii U though, right?
3517345	3524051	Well, of course you can but I wonder if the price has dropped maybe so it's like $20 at this point and it would make a really good, you know...
3524631	3527772	Please, please.
3528072	3533173	Them dropping the price of something that's going for $90 right now, and it's exclusive to them?
3533373	3537593	Yeah, I'm sure they're totally motivated from competition to drop that price.
3538374	3539634	Like, hell they are.
3539854	3541274	It's probably going to come back at $60.
3542034	3543815	Alright, let's move on with some more news.
3543895	3544155	Loki.
3544875	3551436	Alright, so, there was a couple bits of information from Microsoft this week about
3552731	3554212	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3574541	3583527	One of the reasons why they're doing this is because the Xbox One, for example, is going to allow you to share your gold membership, sort of.
3584948	3589290	Basically, the way they're going to do it is you have your console.
3589810	3596174	Only one person or one live account on that console needs to have live gold.
3596474	3600477	So, say I have my family and each one of them has an Xbox Live account.
3600937	3615099	I only need to have Golden for everybody to play online regardless of which account is signed in and then also the same thing like if I go to my friend's house and sign into my account they can also play on Xbox Live with me while I'm over there
3616229	3617389	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3637495	3647775	The problem is, it isn't fucking new This is the same shit that you can do right now on the Xbox 360 It's basically, I buy a game online For example, say I bought...
3649102	3650603	I don't know, an Xbox Live Arcade game.
3651303	3654684	Say I bought Super Street Fighter 2 or something like that.
3656005	3657425	And I have it on my console.
3657685	3658486	I've downloaded it.
3659006	3659666	It's good to go.
3660026	3660667	I can play it.
3661567	3666549	Anybody that's in my family or anybody else, any other account on my console can play that as well.
3667009	3674172	If I go over to Rob's and sign into my account and download the game on his console...
3674932	3675913	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3696388	3698429	Game, set, match, or a fucking takeover.
3698670	3700471	You're so fucking stupid.
3700671	3703513	You don't even realize how stupid you are.
3703693	3704533	To be fair.
3704553	3706114	The Xbox Live sharing thing, cool.
3706574	3710677	This game sharing thing, it's the same shit you have now.
3710797	3714580	And you're like, oh my god, I'm going to buy an Xbox One now because it's so amazing.
3714780	3715880	You're so stupid.
3716161	3719343	And that's why they're going to be able to sell those consoles because you're so fucking stupid.
3720143	3720784	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3736642	3737002	All right.
3737723	3738703	Except I said that in my head.
3738743	3741445	I didn't actually respond back to him because I'm not going to waste my time doing that.
3741645	3744006	He was all red in the face just going, okay.
3744266	3745487	You couldn't fit it into 140 characters.
3745587	3747508	Oh, I showed so much restraint.
3747588	3750009	I was going to film a YouTube video and all that shit.
3750049	3752771	I was going to like, oh, hey, what the hell?
3753371	3756273	BlackMagic, my 360 turned into an Xbox One!
3778209	3789079	for me to, like, say, bring Mass Effect over to your house, and we have to, or, excuse me, go over to your house to install my digital copy of Mass Effect or whatever, and wait for it to download 7 gigs before we play it.
3789459	3792242	But on the Xbox One, we'll be able to play it right away.
3792382	3794304	So it does kind of enhance it a little bit, right?
3794324	3798447	Well, yeah, because it would have just been ridiculous if you had to do that, you know, as it is.
3798587	3802731	I mean, I know, hopefully, they're going to treat the recovering profiles a lot easier, because...
3803672	3804552	Thanks for watching!
3825098	3830441	Um, Actdeft in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, it's been a while since we've had a Loki rage that hard.
3830741	3836783	And Tiger Claw says, Loki ranting and shouting at the Microsoft employee probably would have been like that video of the lady shouting at an Apple store.
3836943	3839765	I seriously thought about doing that, but just to prove myself right, but...
3840585	3841345	It's not worth it.
3841465	3847626	On someone like that that's randomly going through and like actually searching for like Xbox One and commenting on everybody's story.
3847887	3849487	And like I went and read through like his stuff.
3849507	3855148	I'm like, no, it's not even worth it because this guy's so – he's drank so much of the Microsoft Kool-Aid that there's no getting through this guy.
3855168	3857208	So I'm not even going to waste my time.
3857528	3859629	Do you really think the Xbox One is going to be that bad though?
3859649	3864250	Because I've really – I mean I kind of think they've kind of gone back on everything they need to.
3864630	3869631	The only thing that makes the Xbox One at this point is the fact that it's $100 more and has that required Kinect.
3870151	3876812	But it's kind of one of those things where it's like, inevitably, a year and a half after it launches, there will be some type of price drop.
3877413	3879413	Like, I will get an Xbox One eventually.
3879433	3881213	I'm not saying that the Xbox One's bad.
3881273	3883094	I'm just calling out bullshit marketing.
3883214	3884334	That's all I'm calling out.
3884354	3891075	Because if Sony did the exact same thing, if Sony came out and said, you know, like, hey, let's talk about how awesome cloud sharing is.
3891095	3893556	This is a brand new feature that we're bringing to the PlayStation 4.
3894196	3894917	It's never been done before.
3894937	3898480	I'd call them out and I'd be like, fuck you, this has been something that's been available already.
3898881	3900262	You know, something like that.
3900282	3902204	I would do it both ways.
3902284	3905948	Or Nintendo, you know, Nintendo started talking about something ridiculous.
3906388	3911773	You know, so it's just, I find it fascinating that they would come out and say that.
3911793	3912694	But I mean, it makes sense.
3912734	3917739	Of course they're going to want to do that because it makes it, and the game sharing thing is just ridiculous.
3918786	3921510	Yes, cool, I can sign into my account and play the games I have bought.
3921670	3927038	Okay, I mean, that's not really sharing, that's more like I'm going to a friend's house and watching a movie that I brought with me or something.
3927279	3929923	Alright, any comment from Alan or DarkSakura on this before we move on?
3931606	3950856	I like rants well like I said in chat if they create some sort of mobile mode or travel mode for your account when you sign in it makes the process faster that'd be nice but like Loki said it's still the same shit we have now I hate importing my profile to a different Xbox
3951776	3954718	It takes like 10 minutes, and you have to do it again.
3955238	3957640	When you come back home, you have to re-import your profile.
3958140	3959041	That's awful.
3959161	3959841	Here's the thing, though.
3960161	3966886	Going forward, this is probably going to tie in with Xbox One live accounts because you're connecting to their service.
3967286	3968827	It's probably just going to exist in the cloud.
3968847	3976932	You're just going to be signing in like you would sign in on a website, and you're never going to have to download that profile because it's all on the cloud type thing.
3976992	3978072	So that's...
3979193	3993912	Probably gonna improve, you're not gonna have that, you know, I download my, you know, my 10 meg profile for some reason that takes, you know, if I'm downloading any other 10 meg file anywhere, it would be like instantaneous, but oh no, for some reason I'm, I'm...
3994372	4011603	Operating at 24.4 or 28.8 or whatever Going back to the 90s Let me move In the interest of time I'm going to move on I want to talk a little bit about Nintendo Because Nintendo put out one of their Nintendo Directs this week Where they talked about Clarified a few things going on for the rest of the year
4011843	4030692	for the record I think those are a brilliant idea yeah they're they're they're working out really well I love you know and the great thing is they kind of come out of nowhere like you know people people are already saying get ready y'all Apple's gonna do something on September 10th and it's like god that's so far away but when Nintendo Direct so far away yeah it's less than a month it's still it's still a long ways away
4031368	4035550	Well, okay, compared to Nintendo says, all right, there's going to be a Nintendo Direct day after tomorrow.
4035950	4036731	Get up early and watch it.
4036891	4037231	Cool.
4037571	4038452	So, I'm just saying.
4038872	4040453	Anyhow, they had the Nintendo Direct.
4040813	4042014	Just kind of clarified a few things.
4042074	4044395	No real big bombshells, but just a few things.
4044775	4048057	First off, Sonic Lost World will be coming out October 22nd.
4048077	4051779	They were talking about some kind of functionality between 3DS and Wii U that sounded interesting.
4052639	4071193	Art Academy Sketchpad for Wii U Some details there And kind of looks like you'll be able to post your drawings into Miiverse Which, you know, alright, whatever Which as Miiverse grows, it's kind of nice Looks like some people are doing some crazy shit in there too I think there's a version of it already downloadable Like a little mini version of it
4072313	4075374	Luigi was confirmed as a new Super Smash Bros.
4075414	4078936	character and I was kind of like, isn't that kind of a given?
4079296	4080776	I kind of already thought he was.
4081017	4082337	Is he going to have crazy leg jumping?
4082437	4083217	Because that would be awesome.
4083738	4084518	Did he in the other ones?
4084598	4085018	I think so.
4085198	4087659	I was thinking, you know, if the Mario 2 stuff.
4088786	4093489	They need to announce Mecha Luigi or Demon Death Luigi where he's like a super uber one.
4093909	4094870	Or Waluigi.
4095670	4095810	No.
4096211	4097291	Waluigi's awesome.
4097772	4099373	I have another Nintendo exclusive.
4100053	4102074	The next Zelda game is going to have Ganon in it.
4102494	4103335	Oh my god.
4104836	4106037	Alright.
4106717	4107257	Moving on.
4107538	4109119	Some other things announced in the Nintendo Direct.
4109199	4112561	Rayman Legends Wii U will have Mario and Luigi costumes.
4112621	4117744	Now, they're not going to actually be Mario and Luigi but it's like Rayman wearing the red suspenders and all that.
4118506	4120949	I still found it interesting despite all the drums with this game.
4120969	4129478	I kind of think that's one of those things nowadays for any Nintendo-made game that's like, oh, we gotta have fucking some reference to Mario in it.
4130019	4130680	Gotta have it.
4131601	4133683	Even I remember, was it Need for Speed?
4134664	4138969	Most Wandered or something had fucking cars based off of the Mario Kart cars or something.
4138989	4139469	It's just...
4141751	4151858	It's neat, I guess, but when you do it in every single game, when there's an homage to Mario in every goddamn game that's third party, like, what are we going to get in fucking Assassin's Creed, you know?
4151918	4153900	Are we going to have a Mario hat in Assassin's Creed?
4153940	4155020	Or Watch Dogs?
4155040	4157722	Are you going to have a Mario hat in Watch Dogs?
4157782	4157983	I mean...
4159924	4165829	They showed some more footage from Wind Waker HD and A Link Between Worlds, and I am so here for A Link Between Worlds.
4165849	4167891	That's like my most anticipated 3DS title right now.
4169132	4171815	Pretty interesting little virtual console tidbit.
4172415	4177780	A game they're going to put out on the 3DS eShop, Summer Carnival 92 Rekka, which is a very...
4178160	4178540	Wrecka?
4178680	4180241	Oh my god, that game's awesome!
4180381	4181281	It's so rare, too.
4181301	4182101	Have I covered it, too?
4182161	4183142	Oh, I don't know.
4183162	4184202	I might have done Wrecka.
4184422	4184682	Maybe.
4184862	4187003	It's a neat game for a NES game.
4187123	4193386	Yeah, well, yeah, and they actually acknowledged, like, this shit is rare, and now everybody's gonna be able to play it, so that was kinda neat.
4193966	4199408	Some other things they announced for Virtual Console on 3DS, Donkey Kong, Wario Land 3, Super Mario Bros.
4199748	4201729	3, and Tecmo Bowl, which, you know, kinda...
4203149	4204329	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4230194	4230474	Me-Verse
4252396	4253177	Interesting.
4254219	4254559	I don't know.
4254579	4260967	It was a weird little last tease, but I kind of like that they're trying to push the boundaries of me versus some different things.
4261047	4266253	But for me, I'm going to be honest, it was one of those things I downloaded it once, I checked it out, I was like, huh, neat.
4266494	4268176	Then I turned it off and I probably won't ever run it again.
4269807	4274955	But for those that are really into sharing the creative stuff they've done in Animal Crossing, it might be kind of cool.
4275436	4277960	So those are some of the highlights of the Nintendo Direct.
4278942	4281586	So please look forward to all those games coming out soon.
4282408	4284411	DarkSakura, before we get to release dates, what do you have for us?
4285006	4289708	Well, we do have a demo that's finally on the EU Wii U eShop.
4290349	4291809	EU Wii U eShop.
4292210	4293990	Just try saying that three times fast.
4294751	4298713	But it's been on the American Wii U eShop as well.
4299553	4304536	Wonderful 101, which I watched the trailer for last night and...
4305456	4308118	Actually, this kind of makes me want a Wii U again.
4308378	4313622	I mean, Tank Tank Tank was kind of a tank, but... It's free now.
4314043	4314243	Yeah.
4314383	4319867	Well, this though, and it was done by Hideki Kiyama, who did Beautiful Joe.
4320347	4325731	And it totally looks like the same feel that Beautiful Joe had, which was a fun series of games.
4327513	4330955	So I really, really am excited about this one.
4331696	4332757	It just looked really fun.
4333297	4338060	And it had sort of that Sentai feel to it, you know, because, you know, I like Sentai.
4338781	4342483	So I think this might be the convincing factor.
4342643	4344865	Even Dan was sort of like, oh, that was cool.
4345165	4347066	There are a lot of people pretty excited about this game.
4347126	4348307	So I need to download the demo.
4348327	4349008	I keep forgetting.
4349068	4350369	I got to do that up.
4351029	4353691	I would do that right now, but I need the bandwidth for the show.
4353951	4355712	Remind me to do that later.
4356473	4357894	Have you seen anything about Wonderful 101?
4358234	4360315	A lot of people on my Twitter are really excited for it.
4360455	4362617	Yeah, but we're friends with a lot of Nintendo fanboys.
4363597	4364257	Bless their hearts.
4364497	4365238	Bless their hearts.
4365478	4365758	All right.
4367899	4374301	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, kidney.
4375301	4377062	Let's move on to some release dates.
4377422	4381043	Travel around the world and see what games are coming out to a store near you very soon.
4381723	4387465	The Angry Birds trilogy on Wii and Wii U this week because they didn't get them last time around.
4388299	4396935	Payday 2 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 Phineas and Ferb Quest for Cool Stuff Xbox 360 Wii, Wii U, 3DS and DS
4402492	4411016	And one week from today, Disney Infinity, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, Wii U, and 3DS as well.
4411076	4413538	A whole fucking ton of characters.
4413698	4417520	Any idea what platform I should get it on?
4417560	4422683	Because, you know, like Alan said, we're Twitter friends with a lot of Nintendo fanboys.
4423023	4426045	So I'm kind of leaning towards Wii U for that reason so I can play with them.
4426085	4427166	But then I'm like, oh God.
4427206	4429367	But then I think about things like Injustice where the...
4429887	4431368	You're going 360?
4431668	4436070	I don't even know if I'm buying it.
4436811	4440773	If you have a Wii U, then the tablet acts as the ARFID chip reader.
4441293	4441933	Does it though?
4442053	4444815	Because I thought that wasn't being implemented until a patch later on.
4444855	4446956	Although they are talking about the Pokemon Rumble, so...
4447216	4448297	Skylanders Skylanders
4466098	4468539	Crystal thing that you put the thing on.
4468559	4469780	The magic!
4469800	4471201	You need the magic!
4471341	4474903	If you have a Wii U, just put the action figure on your tablet and it's like, okay, I read it.
4474943	4475603	You have this character now.
4475623	4484189	It's one of those features like the IR port on the 3DS or the DS or whatever that they're never going to fucking use except for that Pokemon game.
4484209	4486210	But you could tap your credit card on it and use that.
4490442	4492023	Don't kid yourself, that'll be a thing.
4492444	4494966	When they announced the Pokemon Rumble, is it?
4495607	4502814	I was like, why didn't they announce a new Pokemon Snap with amazing AR tablet camera support?
4502914	4507178	I kind of wish that my son was older so that he would be appreciative of this stuff.
4507198	4508079	I can get him a Mater.
4509780	4514001	The problem is to get the Cars playset, it's like $40 for the Cars playset.
4514521	4516662	It's like $13 for the Mater.
4517402	4518723	And then Disney Infinity is another $75.
4519163	4528086	No, I'm not spending $120 on this stuff just to have a playable Mater.
4528526	4531267	Besides Saints Row 4.
4532148	4532928	That's all it's about.
4532988	4534209	I'm teaching to play Saints Row.
4534829	4535249	Hell yeah.
4536434	4537714	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4561042	4562683	My son plays Angry Birds.
4563184	4565406	Actually, he can kind of do it.
4565446	4566827	He three-starred a level the other day.
4567187	4567687	Oh, good job.
4567707	4570189	Like, I was just, wow, that's pretty cool.
4570209	4578216	You know, it's a little hard for him to do it on the phone, but he... That's the only game he plays so far, but hey, I'll take anything.
4578396	4579276	You gotta start somewhere.
4580037	4582239	Alright, well, since I don't have Japanese releases, how about the UK?
4582259	4582459	Okay.
4583127	4604655	we have um coming out we have DuckTales Remastered on the 13th um which actually I bought that for Dan the day I got fired which I shouldn't have spent money on but I thought I had a job but he said he came up and said my girl loves me because she got me DuckTales I was like oh I'm gonna barf just think about how much he's gonna love you when you buy him Strider
4608099	4618451	also coming out is Europa Universalis 4 and then Payday 2 on PC on the 14th also DuckTales Remastered for PS3
4621258	4625345	Alright, just a few more news stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.
4625365	4627789	And I was a little surprised DarkSakura's picked this week.
4627889	4629732	Why?
4629832	4634559	Just because it's one of those games where you're like, oh yeah, you gotta do that at some point.
4636449	4637451	Xbox 360, Xbox Live, etc.
4653568	4662098	As previously mentioned before, they are getting rid of Microsoft Points and are going to be converting over to real currency.
4662778	4666963	And this is supposed to be happening sometime in the fourth quarter, October-ish.
4667023	4669506	Well, it's actually going to take place at the end of August.
4669526	4672509	They're going to convert your funds over to real money.
4672869	4675152	But they're going to release new cards, I believe, in October.
4675892	4684658	And they're going to come in different nominations of $50, $25, $30, which are actually $3 to $10 cards, and $15.
4685978	4689160	So those are going to be available around October-ish.
4689901	4694504	And your Microsoft Point cards will still work until they say they won't.
4695224	4703669	And the only little bit of small fine print that you have about the points that you have on your account, they must be spent by June of 2015.
4705490	4707712	So they are giving you two years instead of one year now.
4707772	4711276	But I mean, honestly, you shouldn't really have that much money sitting on your account.
4712417	4714439	It means I have to use the card I got for my birthday.
4715802	4745050	well not necessarily I mean you can you just don't yeah you have two years I mean come on you should be able to spend enough time yeah you got enough time buy a digital copy of Grand Theft Auto 5 buy more rock band songs you know that's what she's gonna do I got the email blast about this from Microsoft and the way the email made it sound like it was happening now it just said with with an upcoming Xbox system update this will take effect it didn't actually have any dates in it
4745310	4752114	Well, the system update from what I'm gathering, because they like to do every single system update because they do a new ban wave before a major game release.
4752534	4755836	So the next system update I'm betting is going to be right before Grand Theft Auto 5.
4756516	4758998	And that would be, you know, beginning of September.
4759618	4761639	And that's when they've mentioned they're going to convert everything over.
4761679	4762420	So it would make sense.
4762520	4763901	And they're doing a beta right now for it.
4763921	4765301	So it's probably very soon.
4766762	4769684	So, yeah, probably end of August.
4771683	4777025	I don't know how many of y'all are fans of the EverQuest series, but there was quite a bit of news about EverQuest coming out this week.
4777725	4780746	Some expansions for EverQuest and EverQuest 2.
4781387	4784748	EverQuest getting a new expansion called Call of the Forsaken.
4784888	4787649	Guess what number expansion it is for the EverQuest game?
4787989	4788469	Guess what number?
4788989	4790330	One.
4790350	4790730	37 in a row.
4791131	4791571	Close.
4792451	4794613	It is the 20th expansion for EverQuest.
4795153	4795674	Can you imagine?
4795894	4797495	How many has World of Warcraft had?
4797755	4798035	Four?
4798455	4798676	Five.
4799116	4799376	Five.
4799596	4799796	Five.
4800297	4800537	Is it?
4800757	4801337	Yeah, five.
4801598	4803779	So hopefully a six.
4804099	4808122	Burning Crusade, Wrath of the Lich King, Cataclysm, Pandaria is a four.
4808142	4809023	Roll Pandas.
4809323	4811544	Is a four because Vanilla doesn't count as a expansion.
4811985	4814906	But we all know a fifth is coming at BlizzCon this year.
4817168	4818649	How many people have they lost now?
4820030	4821110	It's going down.
4821370	4823751	They were at 7.7 as of the last Horde House.
4823931	4825112	Yeah.
4825132	4828033	But 7.7 is still way more than any other MMO, so we'll see.
4828593	4830374	Well, I don't know.
4830434	4836877	I mean, we could get into a longer discussion on this about how League of Legends has a heck of a lot of people playing that, but it's not really measured the same way.
4836937	4837297	But anyway.
4837757	4838698	That's another discussion.
4838758	4839418	Back to EverQuest.
4840058	4849783	Call of the Forsaken is the 20th expansion where you will face off against the dragon lady Lendinaria and return peace to the world of Norath as the way these things go.
4850464	4855366	Also, two shared bank slots, a new heroic adventure system, new gear, new raids.
4855767	4861890	EverQuest 2 is getting its 10th expansion, Tears of Vashan, a new channeler class coming in with that.
4862310	4867594	I think one thing that caught a lot of people's attention, though, however, is the news on EverQuest Next.
4868295	4874820	EverQuest Next was shown, just little tidbits and a website up, but EverQuest Next will have destructible environments.
4875441	4878563	And it's not like a total sandbox-like playground.
4878824	4881446	There will be restrictions on what you can and what you can't destroy.
4882026	4884128	But what I thought about this was that there's this whole other kind of
4885769	4886610	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4908229	4910590	Landmark is the name of what I was thinking of.
4910851	4920358	You can construct a structure on a plot of land that you claim in the world and then you can sell it in the Player Studios marketplace for use in EverQuest Next.
4922400	4923301	That's very Second Life.
4923461	4925262	Who's going to build the gigantic penis first?
4927464	4929245	I guess I'm assuming these things have to be screened.
4929766	4931747	Oh, Rob, not everybody's into penis.
4932868	4934009	Okay, then boobies.
4934389	4934669	All right.
4935390	4942976	Anyhow, also it should be mentioned that there's also an iOS and Android app happening called EverQuest Worlds.
4943376	4948300	Quests and minigames that will tie into lore content and rewards in the EverQuest franchise.
4948340	4950281	That app is free and available now.
4950762	4953924	So if you're an EverQuest fan, there's a lot going on right now.
4954845	4955165	Pretty cool.
4958020	4962346	Teto13811 in our chat says, EverQuest meets Minecraft.
4962366	4965249	Yeah, that's kind of the impression I got from it too, which is kind of cool.
4965670	4967112	Like, you know, I like the idea of that.
4969335	4969855	Let's see.
4972018	4974081	Trying to see if anybody else is talking about it.
4976127	4978508	at live.vognetwork.com.
4979748	4981849	I see some comments on the Microsoft point card thing.
4981889	4989951	Tigerclaw says, what's going to happen, I think, is Microsoft will replace those points card with the one similar to PlayStation Network where you can buy a $20 or $50 card.
4989991	4992271	Yeah, I think that's pretty much exactly what's happening.
4992311	4994392	Yeah, that comment might have come in before you read that.
4994992	4995252	All right.
4995892	5004755	Anyhow, that does it for the news for Part A, but we can't wrap this up until we take a trip down memory lane.
5006929	5009411	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
5009431	5011032	The classic game of the week is Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time.
5025376	5026477	I told you guys, right?
5026537	5029019	Like, I mean, she has to do it eventually, right?
5029059	5031481	That's a really obscure deep cut, DarkSakura.
5031521	5031801	Right?
5033483	5035304	Okay, then we'll do Panorama Cotton again.
5035324	5036845	Or Emerald Dragon.
5037206	5040328	You can't do the same game twice, even though you totally did it once.
5040408	5040929	You know what, Rob?
5040949	5041229	You know what?
5041249	5041509	You know what?
5041549	5041970	You know what?
5042030	5042250	What?
5044512	5046653	So, I had to pick this music to start off with.
5046713	5047314	Okay.
5049155	5061599	Anyway, the Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time, also known in Japan as Zeru no Densetsu Toki no Ocarina, is the Nintendo 64 Zelda option, the very first one that came out.
5062520	5067921	It came out in Japan on November 21st, 1998, and North America November 23rd, and in Europe December 11th, same year.
5069822	5081846	It was originally developed for the Nintendo 64DD, but instead came out for the Nintendo 64.
5082827	5089589	So you play as Link, you go through Hyrule, you have a completely open world.
5089729	5091850	I mean, for as small as it was, it was an open world.
5092783	5114311	and you had to do several different things you time traveled you had to solve different puzzles it's a Zelda game but it was the first of its type I really think it was it had a really good story it was really in-depth it had some very weird stuff going on in it but it didn't have that stupid moon and it didn't have tingle so it was a lot better than Majora's Mask
5116225	5116525	I know.
5117686	5124272	Also, the Guinness Book of World Records said that Ocarina of Time was the highest rated game ever reviewed.
5125513	5128115	And this was also for 2008 and 2010, so it gets a lot of love.
5131558	5157545	there was also some re-releases one of them was Ocarina of Time Master Quest that had the dungeons redone with new puzzles and then the collector's edition which was a port for GameCube we have that I've actually got the gold cartridge for Nintendo 64 which has some fun glitches in it you can do some different fun stuff
5158149	5171007	So anyway, like I said, roleplay game, had different elements, has a Z targeting that basically lets you lock on to another item so that you can focus on it and kill it easier.
5171668	5174712	That game did give me some different perspective issues, but...
5175674	5180481	You also do quests for the NPCs, so it has a slightly MMO quality to it.
5181062	5182244	Just that RPG element.
5183125	5187713	And so basically, you have to get the Master Sword, kill Ganon, save Zelda, the end.
5187933	5188654	Which is typical.
5190566	5193347	The Japanese version was called Tokino Ocarina GC Ura.
5193367	5193407	Um...
5217230	5217851	Let's see.
5218331	5223474	It also, we had other versions that came out with a GBA.
5223514	5224915	We released A Link to the Past.
5225795	5227656	You could buy it on Virtual Console.
5228097	5229598	Basically, it was available.
5229898	5230198	Bless you.
5232499	5235102	It was available, you know, for a while.
5235322	5248175	Now, like I said, there was a 64DD version that was planned that was called Ura Zelda, but it was supposed to expand the game outside of the cartridge limits, and that's where that Master Quest came from, which is why the Japanese version was called Ura.
5249836	5254581	We have the game on the 3DS, which is the game.
5256210	5263077	and, uh, they probably have a, well, like it's saying here, they've actually fixed up quite a few things that were wrong with it.
5263778	5265580	Um, the audio was, of course, done by Koji Kondo.
5265620	5267542	Rob's playing my favorite music in the game right now.
5268803	5270025	The, uh, Gerudo Valley.
5275471	5300250	I have a special love of classical guitar So anyway, yeah, the game is like one of the most loved Nintendo games of all time It's definitely, I would say, probably one of the best that ever came out on the Nintendo 64 So we're just looking at an instant classic when it came out Especially given how pretty it was when it came out And now this is something that's actually important to me
5301290	5304973	I even remember this because this was actually the first time I heard of Philip Glass.
5305834	5308716	They compared a lot of Koji Kondo's music in this to Philip Glass.
5309557	5322407	And basically, this composer came into discussion recently in helping people with autistic meltdowns overcome them by listening to minimalist music.
5323568	5337460	And it made me think that back when I was playing through this game, if ever I found myself in a situation where I felt overwhelmed, I'd go listen to Zelda music and calm down the same way I listen to Philip Glass and calm down.
5337941	5345047	So I thought it was very interesting that that stylistic comparison was drawn between the music and that I react to both of them in the same way.
5345667	5346248	So it was pretty cool.
5347790	5350853	This was the game that made me go out and buy an N64.
5351334	5358643	Unpopular opinion time, but I played Mario 64 for about 30 minutes, and I'm like, this is confusing and weird, I don't like it, this is muddy as shit.
5360165	5363289	I was the age where being a fanboy came to you very easily.
5363650	5364090	I was what?
5364130	5364751	What year was this?
5365572	5366952	Thank you for watching!
5382277	5387463	and I bought other N64 games like Ogre Battle 64, Paper Mario, never played them.
5387923	5388644	Bought them, never played them.
5388984	5391747	I played Ocarina, beat it, never touched my N64 again.
5391827	5401838	See, my rabid fanboy thing, which to some extent still kind of holds to this day, is I really resented the transition to 3D and I just always preferred A Link to the Past.
5401938	5403139	I think I still do to this day.
5403159	5403520	Exactly.
5406022	5411368	I don't think this is a bad game, so get off my... It was just not my thing.
5411388	5413911	I had a really hard time adjusting to the 3D.
5414071	5419236	Just like with me, my unpopular opinion, I guess, is that I liked Wind Waker better than...
5420097	5420778	Ocarina of Time
5447173	5448754	I was just like, why don't they do that?
5449335	5451837	Why didn't they do something like that?
5452037	5456700	I would be cool to see them do a remake of Ocarina of Time HD.
5456961	5461944	Actually, not just up-res everything, but recreate the game, redo all the 3D visuals.
5461984	5465107	What if they did it in the style of Twilight Princess?
5466463	5468104	See, I didn't really play Twilight Princess.
5468224	5472888	I bought it, and I didn't really... Twilight Princess was finally when I came around to accept the 3D Zelda.
5473929	5474649	Twilight Princess was great.
5474669	5478112	There's a part in this game, Ocarina of Time, that did make me a little emotional, too, at that age.
5478772	5479433	I was very sad.
5479993	5484677	The green girl, the little forest girl who has a crush on... Sorry, yeah.
5485157	5493921	When you are older and you have to find the seven sages that are going to banish Ganon, she's one of them, and there's this scene where now she has to go off and she's never going to see Link again.
5494322	5498304	And he's older and she's the same age, and you can kind of tell that she has a thing for him.
5499364	5501125	I just was very, like, I teared up at that.
5501325	5503146	She was a very sad character for me.
5503326	5508609	But how many of us that played the game screamed at the owl when you accidentally made him start over?
5509169	5509489	Yeah, yeah.
5509849	5511130	Spam, spam, spam, spam, spam.
5511310	5512191	Did you hear what I said?
5512211	5512251	No.
5512511	5512711	No.
5513632	5514853	Thank you for watching!
5534994	5537236	And for me, there was just so much stuff in it.
5537276	5538777	Like, I loved the Gerudo.
5539457	5542379	I loved going around.
5543240	5551806	And the one level that I really hated doing, though, was the cave that was all spirally.
5551826	5552907	That was kind of a pain in the butt.
5552927	5557630	Well, there was also the water dungeon or the ice dungeon in Zelda's Notorious for having ice dungeons where you're like...
5557830	5558512	Fuck.
5558572	5564951	The water dungeon was actually really fun to me, but it was also probably one of the only levels in that game that made me actually sick.
5566678	5568518	So yeah, Ocarina of Time.
5568858	5569239	Alright.
5569499	5578280	And I'll even say that to this day, the best way I like to play it is busting out the 64, popping in that gold cartridge and saying, leave me alone.
5578380	5579901	I'm getting my link on.
5581641	5582101	Alright.
5582541	5583201	There it is, folks.
5583221	5585082	Your classic game of the week.
5585822	5588042	Legend of Zelda, the Ocarina of Time.
5588922	5590103	One of the true, true classics.
5590403	5592823	Considered by some to be the greatest game of all time.
5593163	5593883	So, there you go.
5593903	5596384	If the Guinness Book of World Records said something about it, then...
5598591	5602613	We've got news on all of that when we come back after a quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5631297	5637239	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 515, already in progress.
5637799	5642181	Tonight is August 11th of 2013 and having a pretty busy show here.
5642581	5644181	Back after a week off, of course.
5644301	5652364	We weren't here last week, unfortunately, but getting back in full swing talking about games such as Hotline Miami, which the live listeners heard a couple tracks from the soundtrack.
5653184	5653665	I like that.
5653985	5655105	I hadn't heard any of the music yet.
5655485	5658506	I like the second song a lot more than the first, but that was really good.
5659006	5659406	I like that.
5659907	5660827	Good choice, Alan.
5661127	5661547	Thanks for watching!
5681681	5682221	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5698848	5699329	Thanks for watching!
5716769	5742923	Also, just today, I taped a spot for a podcast called Game On Epic Slant Press Edition And that's a part of MMORPG.com And a real quick show, it's only about 30-45 minutes, but they were kind enough to have me on today Good guys over there, so I believe that will be up on Monday, so check that out I get to talk a bit about Final Fantasy XIV, and you guys all know I have the other show, Horde House So I got to speak a little bit about some MMOs, they were talking about Rift and some of the other changes going on at Triumph
5743543	5744324	So that was pretty exciting.
5744824	5754631	And I guess I should give another plug, because I don't know if I remembered to mention it two weeks ago, but on the last GameBooey.org show, which was about music games, I was on that show.
5754651	5755832	And that's up on their feed now.
5756412	5763417	And it might be getting bumped by the time you hear this by their most recent show they did today, which I think they did about GamerX.
5763798	5765959	But look for the show in their feed about music games.
5765999	5766419	We had a great time.
5766440	5767380	It was like a three-hour show.
5768041	5768181	So...
5768761	5769621	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5790931	5791232	DarkSakura.com
5802854	5804175	It's the best way to get a hold of me.
5804395	5808496	D-A-R-K-S-A-K-U-R-A Or you can message me through Tumblr.
5808516	5809557	I was going to say, Tumbles.
5810037	5811097	I tumble a lot more.
5811777	5819500	It's Kuro Tsubasa, K-U-R-O-U-T-S-U-B-A-S-A Just think Blackwing.
5820361	5823222	I mean, if you message me on the Twitter, I will eventually see it.
5824522	5826683	And Loki, I don't know, what's the best way for them to get you?
5826783	5827063	Twitter?
5827963	5828684	Twitter is fine.
5829804	5831805	LokiOLR and Twitter.
5834443	5840087	All right, well, let's get into some rapid-fire news and talk about what else is going on in the gaming world this week.
5840528	5841428	Loki, why don't you start us off?
5841728	5848913	This isn't the first time games tried something like this, where they put up a really expensive, ridiculous bundle for an upcoming game.
5848934	5850675	I think they did something like that for Formula 1.
5852316	5857460	I think it was Formula 1 2012, where they actually had a Formula 1 car as part of the bundle.
5857480	5857760	Yeah.
5858821	5865465	Uh, but this is the Saints Row 4, the Super Dangerous Wad Wad Edition, aka the Million Dollar Pack.
5865926	5871270	It is exactly one million dollars, there is only one available, and it includes the following.
5871650	5885160	Saints Row 4, the Commander-in-Chief Edition, a Virgin Galactic Space Flight, a full-size replica of the Dubstep Gun, a hostage rescue experience, plastic surgery, spy training day, a personal shopper,
5885760	5889882	A capsule wardrobe from all the Saints Row stuff.
5890742	5895464	Seven nights at the Top Royale Suite in Dubai.
5895804	5897925	And a partridge in a pear tree.
5898045	5901147	A week for two at the Jefferson Hotel in Washington, D.C.
5901187	5903228	A first class flight to Washington, D.C.
5903268	5903728	and Dubai.
5904208	5912752	A Lamborghini, a new Toyota Prius Plus, a year's insurance, and a year's supercar membership.
5913232	5917437	All for $1 million, which apparently is not a very good deal because it's very cheap.
5917998	5924865	But my thing is, though, it's $1 million and they couldn't even bother to throw in the Season Pass DLC.
5924966	5927108	I mean, really?
5928209	5936740	This reminds me of how, like in WoW, there are players with phenomenal amounts of money that they didn't buy from a gold farmer that they just have in every expansion.
5937601	5944150	Blizzard has to put in some mount or some treasure thing that costs like 300,000 gold for like the alchemy mount.
5944550	5945892	You have too much gold there.
5946813	5947634	Make this thing.
5947994	5949355	That's what this is, but in real life.
5949655	5950536	You have too much money.
5951817	5953298	Here's a money sink for you.
5953338	5954159	Buy this.
5954379	5956840	It just reminded me of what I should have done a while before I left.
5957521	5959663	That was by the time dragon thing.
5959943	5965327	I think this is one of those stupid things that generates blog headlines across the internet.
5965367	5966608	And oh, look, it worked.
5967711	5968091	Whatever.
5968451	5969052	They trollin'.
5969572	5970172	It's a good troll.
5970192	5970612	You know what?
5971012	5973173	If I had a million dollars, you know what I would do?
5973733	5976114	I would just buy the Bugatti and leave it alone.
5976535	5978215	Honestly, though, it's not really worth it.
5978335	5984578	I think they've had a few sites that have actually broken down cost-wise, and it ends up being about $600,000 worth of product there.
5985018	5986439	So you're kind of overspending.
5986459	5990400	But if you have a million dollars to drop on a game, then you probably don't give a shit about money.
5992241	5993241	Bill Gates, I'm looking at you.
5993281	5994482	Come on, you're a Saints Row fan, right?
5994682	6000566	Honestly, if I had a million dollars, I'd buy a house and pay my bills.
6000606	6005630	But if you had so much money that you had extra, like millions of dollars were just like dollar bills.
6005650	6006431	This is for the 1%.
6008072	6011214	If I magically became the 1%, I think my brain would explode.
6011234	6012035	I wouldn't know what to do.
6012115	6018520	If you're so rich you have no idea how much money exactly you have because the stock market fluctuates so much each day, then this is for you.
6018820	6020461	When you're so rich, you don't know how much money you have.
6020521	6022943	If I had a million dollars, I'd invest and make a million more.
6024983	6025383	Just saying.
6025644	6029067	Well, if I had just one million dollars, I'm not going to buy a fucking game with it.
6029127	6030107	I mean, that's stupid.
6030828	6039996	If I had lots and lots of money, like billions of dollars, then yes, I would drop a million dollars on a fucking game because no one thought that they would purchase it and I'd be like, ha, I fucking purchased it.
6040096	6040937	Next story.
6041897	6067264	so this is kind of cool news for the Oculus Rift they're actually they have a new chief technical officer and that's coming from John Carmack the co-founder of id of course big fan of VR and now going to be a part of the team to make the Oculus Rift awesome so neat
6068604	6068965	Saltibet Saltibet
6085064	6089308	It's basically a website that you go and you sign up and you get fake money.
6089929	6093432	You bet on PC controlled Mugen fights.
6093833	6099598	And for those that don't know what Mugen is, it is a basically create your own fighting game type thing.
6099618	6105885	And so there's characters from Street Fighter, from all the different fighting series you can possibly imagine and a bunch of other made up stuff.
6106245	6106926	So you get like
6107946	6117251	For example, this screenshot here, you get a team battle between Popeye and Ash from Evil Dead versus Duck Dodgers and Spawn.
6117872	6119032	Just weird shit like that.
6119132	6127517	If it's a character that had a sprite made of it during the Genesis slash SNES era, then that sprite has probably been imported into Mugen and made a character.
6127597	6132699	I watched a fight that took place versus a Dragon Ball Z character and Fat Albert.
6132779	6133420	I just watched...
6134000	6135041	Hey, hey, hey!
6157395	6158937	But yeah, it's kind of fun.
6158977	6164344	So saltybet.com, you sign up, you get 400 fake dollars, and then you go and you bet.
6164624	6166266	What a colossal waste of time.
6166326	6175738	I'd want to watch a Daisy fight for that hidden eye beam attack that the Moogan Daisy has from Mario Kart.
6177264	6178966	I'd have to see that.
6178986	6188695	But yeah, it's funny and they've got like... It's just this Twitch stream that they have and you bet stuff and you can even... They have a chat window and stuff on there and you can check stuff out.
6188735	6190336	But there's people with a ton of money.
6190416	6192919	I'm like, how many fucking hours are you spending on this thing?
6193339	6193920	It's ridiculous.
6194440	6196903	And I always bet on the losers apparently because...
6197804	6208877	It's like, how do you pick who's going to win between some random anime chick and this weird screen cap of a soccer player or something like that?
6208897	6210459	It's conversations you had when you were 10.
6211300	6214404	I bet that Superman would lose a fight against that one Battletoad.
6215084	6216805	I mean, that's what Mugen is, basically.
6217325	6223348	Once I tried to find Mugen and install it and get some character packs, I couldn't figure out where the hell this thing is.
6223608	6225669	It's buried on some Japanese forum somewhere.
6225749	6228971	I just tried to Google, download Mugen, play Mugen, for example.
6228991	6229771	I'm going to tell you something.
6230292	6235014	I have a disc from seven years ago, a CD from seven years ago that has an install of Mugen on it.
6235274	6236536	I don't know who these characters are.
6236556	6239459	I mean, I know who one of these characters is, but I don't know who both these characters are.
6239499	6241781	But right now... Are you salty betting during the show?
6241861	6245826	No, right now they have... It's Fox McCloud versus Hawkage.
6245846	6248208	I guess he's from... Looks like Naruto.
6248308	6249670	So... Takagi?
6250236	6251057	Hakage, I guess.
6251117	6253498	Yes, I can't fucking read Japanese today.
6254599	6256580	So it's Fox McCloud versus Hakage.
6256621	6257401	Good for Fox McCloud.
6257481	6260483	Yes, Fox McCloud is definitely favored to win.
6261444	6264446	But yeah, just an example of some of the matchups you see right there.
6265126	6268489	I don't know, I had it on the other day while I was doing other things and I thought it was funny.
6269269	6287600	Alright, let's move on Earlier in the show, I was yelled at in private message by my good pal Shane Alinko When I said that I was most looking forward to on the 3DS the Link Between Two Worlds Zelda remake Because he said, how dare you, Pokemon X and Y still isn't out
6288340	6289081	So fine.
6289141	6289881	Here you go, Shane.
6289901	6292723	Here's a Pokemon X and Y story for me to butcher.
6293263	6296105	And it's about something you were expressing to me earlier this week.
6296606	6298147	Mega evolutions.
6298787	6299107	That's right.
6299127	6305532	The Pokemon Company unveiled more information on mega evolutions such as Mewtwo.
6306192	6310355	It can undergo this change during battle, but the effects would only last for the duration of the battle.
6311216	6319749	In order for this to happen, Pokemon has to hold a Mega Stone item, but there are different ones unique to different creatures in order to get these abilities.
6320370	6325518	There were also new screens and there was a new trailer that was released for this that talks about how to use this.
6326419	6326779	What is this?
6326859	6339162	Super Training is also a thing where you can increase a Pokemon's base stats by playing mini games such as a soccer style game and core training workouts as well that will allow your Pokemon to slowly improve their stats on their own.
6339582	6343543	I want to hear more about the fashion shoots and all that kind of crap that they're going to have in the game.
6343683	6349905	And when this story was announced, all of the Pokemon theory crafters and min-maxers simultaneously got a boner and an aneurysm.
6351725	6353706	Actdeft says Digimon will sue.
6355356	6383159	Pokemon min-maxers are crazy it's one of the reasons I can't get into Pokemon as much as some people like Shane is that there's too fucking much like it's just like oh my god it's like I gotta do this and then I gotta get these items and I gotta min-max this and I gotta do a fucking fashion shoot on the side like god damn you know what I was fine with 151 Pokemon I was fine with taking their pictures and snap yeah that was fun
6383726	6385147	The rest of this shit is too much.
6385528	6385768	Yeah.
6386148	6390352	You know, okay, I did get some free plushies at E3, which I gave to Julie.
6390973	6391813	But, you know what?
6392454	6392614	Shane?
6392634	6392794	Done.
6392814	6393715	Shane does have a career.
6393735	6396137	The new buddy Pokemon is super cute, by the way.
6396177	6397718	He's super derpy, and I love it.
6397759	6398219	Wait, come on.
6398239	6399220	I want to see the derpiness.
6399280	6399760	Come on.
6400261	6400461	Load.
6400481	6401122	I'm trying to get to load studio.
6401142	6404785	Although, I do like when people do memes with the old... Okay, that looks like a derp.
6405125	6406026	Okay.
6406386	6407346	Isn't he adorable, though?
6408546	6409727	What is up with those ears?
6410167	6413567	He's kind of like the... What's the one they have all the memes about?
6414648	6415928	Psyduck?
6416488	6417168	No.
6417708	6418928	The beaver-looking one.
6418988	6419408	Bidoof.
6419749	6420289	Yeah, Bidoof.
6420429	6421849	What the fuck is a Bidoof?
6421929	6422529	Squirtle, help.
6422569	6423229	I'm on fire.
6423889	6424529	LOL, Bidoof.
6425130	6426030	Squirtle, I'm dying.
6426970	6428110	I haven't seen those.
6429910	6430170	All right.
6431111	6432811	I just like the Diglett memes.
6433722	6435564	Far too much Pokemon content for one show.
6435664	6436164	Shut it down.
6437765	6440847	Hearthstone is Blizzard's free-to-play card game.
6441568	6447772	It's going to be in beta soon, and they're saying it's not really around the corner, but it's not far away either.
6448153	6456619	I'm not sure what the hell that's supposed to mean, but they're saying, here's the quote about it, "...we're not days away from launching the beta, but we're not months away either."
6457159	6457900	Thank you for watching!
6475234	6502161	for Saints Row 4 even I'm excited about this game honestly I gotta get it at some point the soundtrack list has been revealed 109 tracks in this game good lord I am not gonna read all 109 songs off of this list but I will just point out especially because there's like a lot of classical songs because they have the classical station but I will point out I was very excited to see Hathaway What Is Love is in the game and apparently it's one of those songs that's used at a key moment baby don't hurt me
6502942	6505624	Opposites Attract by Paula Abdul Dude, the safety dance!
6507966	6524382	Montel Jordan, this is how we do it I just laughed because Oh Shit's in it Lump by Pusa Oh Shit is in it Obviously the mix station is going to be the best Alright, there you go, Saints Row 4 soundtrack More information there DarkSakura, how about you?
6524483	6524823	What do you got?
6525587	6526988	Okay, well, I have some stuff.
6527809	6533452	We have, first of all, there is a Tomb Raider sequel that has been confirmed by the Square CEO.
6534253	6538936	Well, at least the American slash European Phil Rogers CEO.
6540116	6545059	Basically, they're also going to be doing a comic book that is a bridge between the games.
6545780	6548982	And I knew about this because Gail Simone actually said something about it.
6549042	6550003	You know, I follow her Tumblr.
6551804	6553624	She sort of let that slip early.
6554365	6558507	So I'm looking forward to that because I have liked what I've played so far of Tomb Raider.
6558607	6559867	I just need to play more of it.
6560888	6563209	Or as we call it here at OLR, Girl.
6563369	6563649	Girl.
6565290	6569532	Lara Croft's incredible, no good, very bad day.
6569712	6570813	Whatever that book was called.
6572671	6598947	and then there is a fan petition out for Smash Brothers and they want to make Reggie Fils-Aimé a playable character yep, you can sign the Nintendo and that he uses Nintendo controllers and characters to his advantage as attacks and they are basically encouraging Twitter users to basically message Masahiro Sakurai to have Reggie in the game
6599201	6600042	I think that'd be awesome.
6600482	6601343	That would be pretty sweet.
6601443	6608908	He has to have... You remember Norimaro in Marvel Super Heroes?
6609008	6610649	He was only in the Japanese version.
6610729	6613491	The comedian who was wearing the boy's uniform.
6613571	6615793	I think they should do a version like that for Reggie.
6616033	6620456	With the big head that's super exaggerated features and everything.
6620516	6621477	His jaw should be in attack.
6621597	6626700	I kind of agree with 5th Dream in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com LOL fan petition.
6627681	6628602	Yeah, but it would be funny.
6630163	6652471	and weirder things have happened by the way Tekken X Street Fighter is still in development they haven't given up and it should be better than Street Fighter X Tekken was so I hate this way these stupid well let me say this from Stan in our chat room because I like this comment too I thought Stan Lee would have been cool in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 yes yes
6655425	6667768	So, they're looking, though, with this to build a bigger community for the fighting game fans by combining, not just putting the Tekken fans and the Street Fighter fans together, but really making it one big whole community.
6667848	6668908	So, we'll see.
6669308	6672929	As long as it's better than, you know, the Capcom attempt, then I'll be happy.
6674490	6674850	Ta-da!
6675210	6677150	Alright, there it is, your rapid-fire news.
6677570	6679711	Let's get to the Fugle question of the week.
6687876	6691318	Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities.
6691879	6701105	But this week was a little different because unfortunately due to some of the other podcasts I was doing and being sick and having to get Jamie tonight because she's without car.
6701525	6702386	Yeah, my battery died.
6703647	6705788	I was not able to prep the show in a timely manner.
6705908	6709150	So I was like, all right, well, we're not going to have enough time to get decent replies tonight.
6709551	6717636	So let's mix it up a little bit and do a segment instead that we have not done on Orange Lounge Radio in a very, very long time.
6718016	6720777	It's a segment we call Ask Orange Lounge.
6721477	6721877	God.
6726218	6729199	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
6729679	6732920	What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
6733421	6740363	I bet a lot of people didn't know I usually sing the theme and now they're happy that we don't do this segment a lot anymore.
6742564	6743384	Made up every time.
6743544	6744085	Can you believe it?
6744525	6745846	I'm a regular Wayne Brady over here.
6746287	6749069	Alright, let's start with Facebook.
6749529	6750950	Red the Haze starts us off tonight.
6751070	6751931	What is a man?
6753252	6754773	A miserable little pile of secrets.
6755254	6756094	Weren't you paying attention?
6756715	6756935	Yes.
6758256	6761419	Rob himself says, why is there no Loki and Dan show?
6761479	6762239	That would be epic.
6762840	6764121	Why isn't there a Loki and Dan show?
6764141	6766062	You guys should just look at each other and yell for an hour.
6766082	6766603	It would be fun.
6768129	6769110	I would leave the house.
6769951	6771972	You wouldn't see me while the whole thing was going on.
6771992	6773093	We wouldn't yell at each other.
6773133	6774274	We'd probably agree a lot.
6774394	6774875	Actually, yeah.
6774895	6775655	Yell in unison.
6775755	6778458	It would be the two dudes up in the balcony from the Muppet Show.
6779278	6780840	Dude, that would be awesome.
6780960	6783682	Oh, that would be awesome.
6784062	6784943	Just need to channel that.
6784983	6785343	You know what?
6785403	6788766	I'm going to make the suggestion to Dan, then, that you do the Grumpy Guy Show.
6789987	6796188	Alright, Hoseo Sumerogawa wants to know, what's the one game you thought you wouldn't enjoy, but you ended up loving?
6796508	6801330	I only ask because I thought I wasn't going to enjoy Hitman Absolution nearly as much as I am.
6802030	6804430	The one game you thought you wouldn't enjoy, but you ended up loving.
6804970	6806371	Easy for me, Mass Effect.
6807431	6809471	I'd have to say that was one for me too.
6810151	6811312	And Borderlands 2 actually.
6811932	6812332	I like it.
6813729	6815090	Alan, anything you can think of?
6815351	6815931	I'm blanking.
6815951	6816451	I'm sorry.
6816512	6816872	That's all right.
6816892	6817652	Loki, anything?
6817913	6818353	Minecraft.
6818834	6819975	All right.
6820255	6824839	Ronnie B says, if you could design your own game for the Oculus Rift, what would it be like?
6826700	6828001	It would be like F-Zero.
6832565	6833426	If I had to do one?
6833806	6835148	Yeah.
6835388	6836008	It would be...
6839497	6840017	I don't know.
6840037	6842738	I was going to try to think of something really pervy to say.
6843558	6844739	It'd be like superhero dress up.
6844759	6847139	There's plenty of perv content already on Oculus Rift.
6847180	6847700	Anybody else?
6847780	6847980	Alan?
6848580	6854002	A game like Rez or what was that fireworks game that was a launch game for the PS2?
6854462	6854962	Fantavision.
6854982	6855602	Something like that.
6856202	6856543	Very good.
6856563	6857963	Fantavision is a fun game.
6859084	6863027	Pretty rave drug-induced game on the Oculus Rift.
6863047	6863588	Wireframe.
6863948	6864648	All right.
6864728	6869913	Ragenator says, Train A is traveling south from Butte, Montana at 78 miles an hour.
6870373	6873636	Train B is traveling east to PAX East with Cliffy B as a passenger.
6874116	6878320	How much bacon can Loki eat in one sitting without getting explosive bacon grease diarrhea?
6878520	6879721	That's disgusting.
6879921	6881082	He's not doing that in our apartment.
6883399	6885800	I don't get explosive diarrhea from bacon.
6885820	6887781	It just ends up getting so heavy.
6887841	6889042	It depends on how hungry I am.
6889882	6891083	And how crispy the bacon is.
6891123	6892644	Don't take the question seriously.
6892884	6895906	It's really, that is what it comes down to is how crispy the bacon is.
6895966	6900068	Because if it's not, if it's like all fatty and greasy, then yeah, you can't eat very much of it.
6900088	6902209	But if it's really crispy, then you can eat a ton of it.
6902469	6921088	If it's not very crispy, that means it's well lubricated You guys are disgusting Hey, we didn't ask the question That's true, that's true It's Ragenator's fault Ragenator, you're banned Get something to slap him with in the chatroom And I apologize for the Facebook noises I still haven't disabled it Stop being jerks and setting it off
6921608	6925330	Alright, Bobby Blackwolf asking the heavy hitting question here.
6925890	6932433	With all of the heavy topics that are discussed on OLR throughout the years, there are many questions that one could ask the Lounge of Orange.
6932513	6937135	Some are philosophical, some are personal, others are about the best ways to roast a ferret.
6937935	6944178	However, there is one question and one question only that dictates the future of gaming and the revelry of gaming's past.
6944818	6950161	Why the beep can you not accept that Chrono Trigger and Earthbound are better than Super Metroid?
6951521	6954023	What is actually a rhetorical question?
6954043	6959047	Because the only acceptable answer is, you speak the truth, Bobby, and now I accept your conclusion as fact.
6959127	6961609	It has been written on the internet, and lo, it is true.
6962210	6962430	Well...
6963564	6965065	First of all, it's pronounced Gith.
6966507	6967668	Second of all, no.
6968769	6971491	I've actually prepared an answer for this.
6972092	6980079	I know the internet's been waiting a long time for me to explain the answer to this, so here's my answer.
6980839	6981560	Drumroll, please.
6982200	6982701	Drumroll, please.
6984683	6986224	Because fuck you, that's why.
6986644	6987585	Thank you and goodnight!
6987805	6988886	Do-do-do-do-do-do.
6988906	6989787	Do-do-do-do-do-do.
6994429	6995570	No, I just... Okay, look.
6996190	7004756	There's something about the fact that Super Metroid is something that you can play in, like, you know, one sitting and really kind of do, like, the speedruns and collect all the items.
7004876	7010059	I love the music in Super Metroid, and I don't know how to put my finger on it.
7010239	7014562	I just fucking love that game, and really, they don't make Metroid games like it anymore.
7014582	7014902	It's just...
7015868	7017549	They do make Castlevania games like it.
7018770	7019271	They do.
7019411	7019971	They do.
7020171	7023414	And I don't hate Chrono Trigger and I especially don't hate Earthbound.
7023434	7026296	In fact, I got Earthbound on Wii U Virtual Console and it's fun.
7026436	7027477	You know what I found the other day?
7027997	7028478	Earthbound.
7029118	7029579	The cartridge.
7029739	7030459	Oh, good times.
7030479	7030920	Did you play it?
7031520	7031901	Uh, no.
7031921	7032721	Alright.
7033041	7034583	Dan and I were actually playing through Super Mario World.
7034603	7036624	That's the other game I forgot to say I was playing.
7036944	7037865	It was to cheer me up.
7037905	7040147	Dan and I drank wine and played Super Mario World.
7040458	7042879	Alright, three hour show and look how many questions I gotta get through.
7043620	7047041	Alright, Tim Tripp wants to know, why not Zoidberg?
7049263	7049543	What?
7050903	7051944	Why not Zoidberg?
7051964	7052784	You're laughing over there, Loki.
7052844	7053745	Is that Futurama?
7053765	7055246	I think so.
7055786	7057467	Because he sheds his skin and he's gross.
7058507	7059728	That show got cancelled anyway.
7060328	7061249	It came back, didn't it?
7061949	7063210	I think it's gone again.
7064330	7069053	Stan H wants to know, if you were in a Final Fantasy game, what would be your job class?
7071253	7074354	I want to do a summoner because I want to summon cute little creatures to do my bidding.
7074454	7075775	I'd be Realm.
7076055	7080376	Where I would draw everything that I want into existence and have them beat the shit out of everybody.
7080997	7082357	Here's a horde of cute ponies.
7083057	7084778	Stop, stop, stop.
7084898	7085078	Alan?
7085658	7087539	I'd be Saban because he was super hot and built.
7088719	7089059	Loki?
7089519	7092580	I don't remember what the class was in Final Fantasy VI.
7092640	7093681	It was Edgar.
7093721	7095761	I think he was an engineer or something like that.
7095781	7097642	Because he had a fucking chainsaw and that's awesome.
7097662	7098262	And he had a real gun.
7101319	7104361	Jeremy, our buddy from Koopa Club, wants to know, do you even lift?
7105602	7105842	No.
7107783	7109905	How much can you bench, DarkSakura, who's raising her hand?
7110245	7111186	I actually don't bench.
7111246	7114188	I do deadlifts, and I am up to 60 pounds now.
7114749	7115349	Wow.
7116090	7116730	Hey, I'm a girl!
7118332	7119453	That doesn't mean anything.
7120013	7120133	It's 2013.
7121604	7130629	Well, I mean, but for the most part, for people who don't know, I actually am working into powerlifting because I can't do heavy cardio because of bad joints.
7130669	7133371	God damn it, Code Man, stop setting off my Facebook.
7134411	7141035	But I actually do deadlifts, and I'm going to be starting bench pressing and doing other powerlifting, so that was a good question.
7141656	7148078	I do live lifts, like 30 pounds or 35 pounds of live person that I lift up on a daily basis.
7148238	7150498	I'm going to lift this question and throw it out of the show.
7151759	7152139	All right.
7152579	7155679	Renee, also from Koopa Club, wants to know, what's your favorite crepe?
7156640	7157100	Oh, my God.
7157140	7160881	Those crepes at the cute little place in Japantown.
7161621	7164982	There's this picture of me on Twitter with a spike from Game Buoy.
7165522	7166482	And look at the crepes.
7166602	7168183	Zoom in on the crepes in that picture because they're adorable.
7168203	7169623	There are crepes that are so cute.
7169663	7169743	You...
7170223	7172666	Almost feel bad for wanting to eat it, but you eat it anyway.
7173066	7179173	I will say, though, as far as savory crepes go, there's a place here in Sacramento called Crepeville that's downtown.
7179193	7181416	They have this curry crepe that's really good.
7181856	7183758	Danielle's Crepes in Sacramento.
7183778	7185280	I was pointing out to you on the way here.
7186201	7187923	Very, very good chicken crepes.
7188667	7196796	DeGenerate Johnny says, since Rob often asks this question to every guest on OLR, I'd like to know your answers to the question, what is your favorite game of all time?
7197097	7201902	Note, if you can't immediately name one game, the closest thing would be your favorite game from your favorite gaming genre.
7202603	7204565	As addressed earlier in this segment, Super Metroid.
7204845	7205306	DarkSakura?
7205466	7206047	Guardian Legend.
7206667	7207428	Valkyrie Profile.
7207829	7208449	Grand Theft Auto V.
7212165	7215568	Did you see the how-to basic video for how to install Grand Theft Auto V?
7217230	7218751	Then I watched all of his.
7218891	7220853	In fact, we were watching it at lunch.
7220893	7223635	I was showing my son those videos.
7224016	7225917	He's like, what's he doing?
7225937	7229661	That's awesome.
7229781	7237127	Fifth Dream says, for each member of the cast, if you could listen to only one album for the rest of your lives...
7237808	7238929	What would you pick?
7239230	7240591	Ooh, this is hard.
7241272	7242954	One album for the rest of your lives.
7243014	7243615	What would you pick?
7245957	7246118	Anyone?
7246138	7246518	That's easy.
7246818	7247279	Okay, Loki?
7247579	7251224	Well, just because I was listening to it for about a couple months already.
7251324	7253967	So, Onamonoguchi, Endless Fantasy.
7254768	7254948	Okay.
7257687	7258167	I'm not sure.
7259007	7261409	I think I know how I want to answer this, but I'm not sure.
7261789	7272074	I have, okay, it would be between, I can't narrow it down to one, so it would be between Tragic Kingdom by No Doubt or LCD Sound Systems.
7272275	7275276	Actually, I think it's going to be LCD Sound Systems' second album, Sound of Silver.
7275376	7276137	That would be my album.
7278418	7283981	Either it would be Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill or Echo Image's CompuPhonic.
7285023	7285903	No, ABBA.
7287104	7287644	ABBA Gold.
7287684	7289224	ABBA Gold, I know, I know.
7289424	7290645	But it's only one album.
7291365	7291745	Only one.
7291905	7294106	I would, for me, I'd probably have to say Pearl Jam's 10.
7295066	7298387	Because honestly, that is one of the few albums I can listen to all the way through.
7298927	7302208	Or maybe, what was that Beatles album?
7302248	7305429	Because now I can see it in my head and I know the name of it.
7305849	7305949	Not...
7306169	7329132	Not Abbey Road, it was Revolver, Rubber Soul Rubber Soul, thank you I knew it was one of the R ones I love Revolver and Rubber Soul about equally But I used to own, actually I do again own a copy of Rubber Soul And it's my favorite Beatles album to this day Those were the transitional albums where they went from doing bubblegum pop To like the really weird metaphorical stuff Those were the, yeah Rubber Soul and Revolver both were such good albums
7329955	7331816	Now we have people in the chatroom giving their answers.
7332416	7334056	I like Teto's answer, Throwing Copper.
7334076	7334917	Reginator has a good one.
7335497	7336997	Metallica's Black Album was really good.
7337017	7338638	Ooh, Fifth Dream, The Cure with Wish.
7339138	7340018	Ooh, another good one.
7340038	7340498	Another good one.
7340538	7341199	Lots of good choices.
7341439	7342759	You know what I would pick for an album?
7343319	7344220	My iTunes library.
7345560	7346880	Depends how long I've been alive.
7346920	7351862	I mean, if we're talking like, you know, I've been alive for hundreds of years and probably Christmas speed, so I'd kill myself.
7355970	7362421	GamerGirl says, if Animal Crossing New Leaf really existed, what animal would you be and why?
7363463	7364064	I want to go last.
7364574	7365174	I'd be human.
7365995	7367056	Because I'm the main character.
7368097	7370078	And I'm the fucking mayor.
7370158	7371779	So fuck all of your animals.
7372039	7377323	I am not going to be a nice dog like what's his face in my town.
7378004	7384288	I'm going to hit Ed over the face with a bug net, kick that bitch out of my town, and run it for money.
7385649	7387390	Alan, you'd be the gay unicorn.
7391113	7392354	I'd be a
7393939	7394659	Kazelle.
7397300	7397700	Loki.
7398261	7398701	Poacher.
7400141	7400902	Which one's poacher?
7401922	7405323	A poacher, as in a hunter that kills the animals.
7405443	7405984	No.
7407224	7410185	And my answer is, I would be Tom Nook.
7410265	7411066	Now give me my money.
7412628	7413630	Fuck no, I have a gun.
7415292	7418136	I'm glad none of us said Sahara.
7419398	7421181	Because Sahara really likes carpet.
7422483	7425928	Is that the one that's like a boy in the Japanese version?
7426168	7426589	Gracie.
7426869	7428251	I would be Gracie, let's be real.
7428972	7437096	Sahara is the wallpaper and carpet merchant who comes and redoes your house with the most god-awful ugly shit ever that you pay 3,000 bills for.
7437116	7439237	Alright, we got four more on Facebook to get through here.
7440198	7446101	DJ Melvis, our good pal, says, It's you versus the Grin Reaper in a duel for your life.
7446641	7448362	You must choose three different games.
7448902	7453085	One 8-bit console game, one 16-bit console game, and one arcade game.
7453165	7453565	Open choice.
7454185	7457447	To have a score battle or timed run against him.
7458047	7459428	What you bring into the duel?
7460088	7464490	You got a throwdown with a Grim Reaper, an 8-bit game, a 16-bit game, and an arcade game.
7464871	7465911	What you bring into the duel?
7466532	7467852	Ooh, this is a toughie.
7468052	7469053	I know what my time run would be.
7469293	7469573	Okay.
7469793	7472995	I would actually break it into Super Mario Brothers, the first one.
7473695	7476997	I should not say that about Mario, too, because I'm really fast on speed runs for that game.
7477898	7482280	My score one would actually be Kirby's Avalanche on Super Nintendo.
7482320	7482860	Ooh, okay.
7483020	7486102	My arcade one would probably be the first Killer Instinct.
7486542	7486843	Wow.
7487143	7488044	I was really good at it.
7488104	7488565	Dang.
7488725	7490808	You didn't even get prepped on that question in advance.
7490868	7492009	Anybody else want to take a stab at this?
7492049	7492690	I don't even know.
7492890	7498498	Anything that I was super awesome at when I was like 12, I'm out of practice with, so I'd be screwed if that was the duel.
7500941	7501321	Gosh.
7503344	7509368	Tetris 8-bit game I would pick E.T.
7509408	7521276	because I was actually fairly decent at that You're going way before 8-bits That's like a 2-bit game Tetris is your 8-bit game Master System or Nintendo And then what's Super Nintendo?
7522425	7524808	I have lots of points.
7527630	7529632	Kirby's Superstar.
7530834	7532295	I dominate that game.
7532315	7533016	Arcade game.
7536719	7537060	Klax.
7538467	7542009	Arcade Game, Easy, DDR 8-bit game Anticipation 16-bit game
7561929	7589476	you know you think I would say Super Metroid but I think I'm actually going to go with like I'm going to go with Tetris Attack because it was basically Pokemon Puzzle League and I was pretty good at that Loki Dance Dance Revolution, Super Mario Kart and 8-bit that's kind of tough Mario is missing fuck I didn't even play that what the fuck did I play a lot of Contra?
7590376	7591717	Edgar R. asks, which video game had the worst ending?
7611328	7613208	Mass Effect 3, Mass Effect 3, Mass Effect 3.
7614269	7618490	No, because they actually fixed it and made it semi-decent, even if it wasn't great.
7618750	7623951	How about, like, go back to, like, you know, Ghouls and Ghosts, you know, where it was like, congratulations.
7625572	7626432	Or was it Ghosts and Goblins?
7626452	7627692	Excuse me.
7628633	7629073	You win.
7629093	7630413	You have to do it all again.
7631813	7632433	Oh, God.
7632574	7634194	What games had really crappy endings?
7638197	7638918	I don't know.
7639118	7642440	I mean, unless there's like the ones where you die at the end or some shit.
7644041	7645042	Super controversial.
7645883	7647904	Final Fantasy VII because shit was not finished.
7648685	7649005	Yeah.
7649025	7653488	If Final Fantasy VII had come out in the age of the internet, it would have been a Mass Effect 3 debacle.
7653548	7654149	It really would have.
7655436	7659220	I probably would actually say the original state of endings for Mass Effect 3.
7660281	7661462	I did go back and watch them.
7662103	7665847	I'm very glad I waited to beat the games when the extended cut came out.
7667509	7672254	Although I do have to say that I really hate that happy ending mod.
7672574	7673375	It just is not good.
7674696	7676038	It just doesn't even suit it.
7676949	7681832	All right, John R. says, Chrono Trigger greater than Metroid, less than Secret of Evermore.
7681912	7682873	Why fight it, Rob?
7683273	7685355	We're all right, even Bobby for once.
7687316	7691199	The only reason I read that and entertained it was the for once part because tee hee.
7691819	7698504	All right, DarkTetsuya asks, remember OLR presents The Hunt based on Loki's favorite novel, Ready Player One?
7698784	7700345	Can we find a way to do that again?
7700665	7705909	Maybe expand it beyond classic games to include more geeky stuff so more of our VOG peeps can participate.
7705929	7706129	All right,
7706289	7710610	That was kind of like a relay race type of thing using classic games, right?
7710750	7710970	Yeah.
7710990	7711630	Some modern games.
7711670	7712491	Yeah, it would be fun to do again.
7712511	7724174	You know, it would be really cool if we could, you know, because our website, VOG Network, is a social game after all, not to volunteer Bobby for projects because I know he's got his plate full already, but maybe in 2014 that could be some type of thing we look at doing.
7724334	7724834	That would be fun.
7724854	7725454	That would be fun.
7726294	7745505	I'd be down for it by that time maybe the movie will come out who knows I think it would be great especially if we could tie it into a charity thing like everybody has to pony up 10 bucks to participate and like you know half the pot goes to a prize maybe and the other half goes to charity or it all goes to a charity of the participants choosing or something like that I think it would be a really great thing
7746004	7748408	or it goes to the DarkSakura and needs a job fund.
7750030	7751773	That's not a registered charity.
7753876	7755018	Alright.
7756300	7756841	Oh my gosh.
7756881	7760006	I was going to see if there were any more questions because I thought I heard it beep a couple more times.
7760647	7761128	Where are we?
7764395	7765496	One more on Facebook.
7766797	7770940	Codeman wants to know, if you were to cosplay, what would you cosplay as?
7771040	7773361	What happens I cosplayed as?
7773541	7775243	What would you cosplay as now?
7775443	7777865	Actually, I can tell you what my next cosplay is going to be.
7778905	7789653	My friend, Chadi, who I think you might have met, we did a stupid online quiz for Homestuck about what would your god tier be, so we were going to just do our god tier outfits.
7790734	7792295	Which mine would be the Sylph of Heart.
7793573	7797496	I need to cosplay as Joker because I got the red beard to pull it off.
7797736	7801879	So I would think that would be a character I'd resemble pretty well that I could cosplay.
7802339	7804521	I found tutorials.
7805122	7805642	Talk to me later.
7805822	7806623	Yeah, I'll have to look into that.
7808264	7810145	Loki, Alan, any interest in cosplaying?
7811206	7812047	What would you cosplay as?
7813588	7813708	Um...
7815965	7816425	I don't know.
7833313	7848944	some sort of giant mech thing although then I'd have to learn how to walk on stilts and that sounds dangerous or get one of those costumes that's like the really realistic looking like raptor dinosaur thing because it'd be fun to run around with that shit and I just want that costume.
7848984	7849544	It's pretty sweet.
7849985	7850965	I have a better answer.
7851466	7851666	Okay.
7851726	7853167	Or a replacement answer.
7853667	7854688	Gender swapped ooh la la.
7854708	7857830	That would actually be really cool.
7858030	7858430	That's amazing.
7858531	7861913	I would cosplay as one of the other characters from Do you have like orange vinyl bell bottoms?
7862033	7862113	Yep.
7863069	7863609	That's amazing.
7864190	7864470	All right.
7864870	7873554	Travis over on Google+, the lone Google Plus respondent, says, Hey, Robin Gang, just finished Tomb Raider and was going to start on Deus Ex Human Revolution.
7873894	7875655	Was wondering what you all thought about each game.
7876535	7877515	Loved Tomb Raider.
7877655	7879796	Didn't get a chance to play Deus Ex Human Revolution yet.
7879816	7883138	You should download it quickly because it is free on the PlayStation Network right now.
7883198	7883618	Oh, is it?
7883638	7884558	PlayStation Plus, yes.
7884658	7885239	Thanks for the tip.
7885439	7885939	And Hitman.
7885959	7886359	I'll do that.
7886379	7888000	Hitman is one they just added, too.
7888180	7888820	I watched.
7888840	7892242	I think it was Tim Tripp was playing Hitman, the new one, and it looked pretty neat.
7893122	7907155	It looks like a game I would be terrible at And Jet Set Radio is on there free as well Good lord I was downloading Hitman today I'm playing Dota 2 right now, I suck at it, but I like it I know you, Rob, have been playing it What do you think about the learning curve of the game?
7907175	7908476	Are you having as much trouble as me?
7908856	7916603	Keep up the good work, love you guys Thank you, Travis Yes, I am having as much trouble as you You just have to kind of jump in there and do it I think that's the only way
7917263	7920606	The good news is Dota 2 has a very robust tutorial system.
7921006	7927632	I think don't be afraid to do the single lane match over against the bot over and over and over again because it'll help you find a character that you like.
7928012	7933857	Like I really learned like I do not like playing melee classes, but I like playing ranged classes.
7934237	7941222	One of the ones I really liked was The Lich because it's basically a parody of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Batman and Robin.
7941242	7941543	Yeah.
7942443	7966769	chill out everybody freeze like the lich is like that in Dota 2 this is my new favorite character so check that out alright there it is the end of Ask Orange Lounge wow that was lengthy tonight but lots of good questions how could we not do that alright let's do some stories mailbag a few of the week coming up and then twitter topics and the skype line at 1877 game OLR but we have some news first Loki
7966949	7967810	Game DVR for the Xbox One
7984722	7985843	I had to laugh.
7987024	8003616	So IGN did this Ask Microsoft Anything, you know, an AMA thing that they have on Reddit and stuff, except that none of the people that, you know, it says, I'm bringing you a handful of Ask Microsoft Anything answers each Monday at 2 p.m., blah, blah, blah.
8004657	8010201	But the people that, you know, participated on IGN didn't get to fucking answer any of those questions.
8010481	8011862	Or ask any of those questions.
8011922	8013764	It was all shit from IGN.
8013844	8019027	Probably, you know, stuff that Microsoft said, okay, here's what we're going to give you answers for.
8019948	8024311	So anyways, so one of those things about, you know, the game capture stuff.
8024331	8028034	They're saying, will Forza 5 clips capture at 1080p and 60 frames per second?
8028054	8028094	No.
8028534	8048889	and where can game DVR clips be uploaded to and they're saying game DVR clips capture beautiful 720p 30 frames per second video and I believe it's up to 5 minutes if that was correct one of the things that kind of sucks though is you have to have Xbox Live Gold in order to use that feature so they're locking it behind a paywall
8049950	8056215	And of course, in typical assembly fashion as of late, they responded back on Twitter.
8056475	8064821	And this is from Shuhei Yoshida, basically saying that, hey, guess what?
8065982	8066582	The PlayStation 4...
8068283	8073928	DVR function will record up to 15 minutes of gameplay in the background and won't be behind a paywall.
8073968	8079674	You do not need PlayStation Plus in order to access the game recordings or streaming functionality.
8080374	8082837	So, cool.
8084258	8084478	DarkSakura
8104005	8104426	DarkSakura.com
8118672	8136065	I think a lot of people are going to be getting the Xbox One probably already have Xbox Live Gold or will be getting Gold and also now that you only have to have one account per family that has Gold if you're gaming on one system that's not a huge deal but still though it does kind of suck that there's yet another feature behind a paywall.
8136564	8136804	Bungie
8157771	8167217	So Chris Butcher, who is a Bungie technical director, was asked in an interview with Edge about, you know, how are you going to address some of these aggressive behaviors people have?
8167697	8172861	And he's mentioning that the developers are talking about positive social behavior rewarding in these games.
8172961	8181266	Quote, if you look back at online multiplayer gaming for the last 10 years, the dominant threat has been adolescent males shooting each other in the face and squatting on each other's corpses.
8181686	8182547	At least they acknowledge it.
8183067	8184667	That emerges from design decisions.
8184727	8190409	The community gets attracted towards that, and that is popular to a lot of other people, and so it tends to exclude others.
8191369	8202271	What they're trying to do is they want to exclude certain in-game gestures and have the game mapping of in-game gestures like waving and dancing to encourage more collaboration and friendliness, less posturing and aggression.
8202451	8203131	Here's the other quote.
8203532	8209993	I don't think you can ever design toxic behavior out, but what you can do is prevent them being able to ruin other players' experiences.
8210413	8214135	You give people these tools that encourage them to interact positively with each other.
8214495	8218578	And then if someone is interacting negatively with you, well, they can't ruin your experience.
8218758	8220139	Now they can just dance on your corpse.
8220259	8220479	I know.
8220719	8228784	It seems a little bit naive to me for a company that's, you know, did... That's just like trying to like say, hey, we're giving you a game where you can draw things, but we're going to ban the dicks.
8229284	8230145	It's not going to happen.
8230185	8231005	You're just not...
8233427	8238853	If all you leave in is a little waving emote, people are going to figure out how to fist each other using the terrain.
8239354	8240115	That's just the thing.
8240455	8241636	That's what's going to happen.
8241676	8242978	It's going to be whacking off somebody.
8243038	8243338	Come on.
8246502	8247022	But we'll see.
8247202	8250744	You underestimate their ability to create lewd gestures.
8250784	8252805	But I do think rewarding good behavior is a good thing.
8252865	8257867	League of Legends does it, and it feels pretty good when I get the little karma point after a match because I was friendly to people.
8258247	8260428	I really wish WoW would implement a similar system.
8261408	8265490	So, you know, yeah, it would be cool if they would reward the good behavior in Destiny, but we'll see.
8265510	8270732	Just have it where if someone gets killed by somebody else and they try to squat on them, they get launched into space.
8271432	8272773	It would be funny.
8272853	8273673	That would be awesome.
8273733	8275774	And then people would do it on purpose to see what happens.
8275854	8276475	DarkSakura DarkSakura
8295683	8301047	There's an ad that Target put out that shows the PS Vita going for $200.
8302989	8307773	And basically there hasn't been a big announcement on anything like that.
8307833	8309114	Sony didn't say anything.
8309554	8312116	But it's in a Target ad and they have to get it from somewhere.
8312697	8322484	Basically this was shown on Blu-ray forums with them all being marked down to $199.99 at Target beginning August 18th through August 24th.
8323545	8325065	But there's been no confirmation.
8325085	8331047	I mean, this could have just been, you know, some sort of a photoshopping deal.
8331067	8342549	But looking at the image, you can see bleed through from the other side for the ads on the other side, which is a lot more effort to put into photoshopping than most people will do.
8342589	8348630	Also, considering where it's coming from, the Blu-ray forms, they're just looking at like Blu-ray, you know, discounts and stuff like that.
8348650	8350831	I don't think they're necessarily focusing on...
8352131	8353052	Gaming consoles.
8353212	8361076	I think if anything they're probably trying to clear out some inventory and move some of that product because they've been sitting on it for a while.
8362597	8366539	The first thing that I do when I see stuff like this is make sure that it's not a Photoshop job.
8368019	8377184	Also, there is a message from the article itself saying that Inside Gaming Daily reported speculation about doing a $500 Vita PS4 bundle.
8380585	8382027	Yeah, I don't think they'd do that.
8382047	8383209	Like I said, speculation.
8383389	8388115	But it would kind of go in if they did decrease the cost of the PS Vita.
8388976	8391439	Then that would make it easier to bundle with the system.
8392600	8392780	For $4.99?
8392901	8394382	Is that what they were saying?
8395324	8397566	Well, they were saying, yeah, $500 bundle.
8400200	8415483	But again, if you've got the system going up for $399 and then you threw in a $100 Vita and it competes with basically the X-Bone, you're actually getting a better deal with the PlayStation.
8415623	8420744	It better come with a Lamborghini and a Virgin Galactic space flight and a trip to Dubai.
8422345	8422965	Maybe not.
8423065	8428126	I mean, I would rather have a system with a handheld system than have to deal with the stupid Kinect bullshit.
8428686	8429106	Just saying.
8430770	8431671	It'd be nice if it was true.
8432932	8435053	I don't know if I'd want a $100 space flight.
8435073	8436134	That sounds kind of dangerous.
8437995	8440557	So Nintendo is fighting piracy.
8440957	8443639	And this is actually more of like legit piracy.
8444939	8447121	This is coming from a website.
8447621	8448602	Wait, wait, wait.
8448902	8450443	What is legit piracy?
8450543	8454005	Like making physical goods.
8454125	8457608	Like duplicating physical goods and stuff.
8457628	8458128	For example...
8458368	8460049	with an eyepatch on them.
8460149	8471878	They filed a lawsuit against a website called HackYourConsole.com and one of the things, you know, other than selling the R4 device and similar things, they also happen to sell hard drives that are preloaded with 200 Wii games.
8472278	8473319	Hmm, that sounds a...
8474359	8476860	Bit bad, you know, that's pretty clear-cut there.
8477380	8482621	So, yes, they've lost it against them, and most likely they're probably going to win.
8483021	8484662	Because, I mean, that's pretty clear-cut.
8485042	8491343	If they were just selling, like, you know, the R4 devices and stuff, I'd say that they may have, like, a little bit of a fight ahead of them.
8491403	8502306	But selling actual, you know, hard drives that are full of, you know, games, that's kind of bad.
8504693	8505594	Street Fighter V
8523903	8524444	and DarkSakura.com.
8542304	8561873	but here's the thing according to one of the producers at Capcom Tomoaki Ayano says that quote users do not need to worry because the characters will definitely not be just copy and pasted for Street Fighter X Tech and if we did that they would undoubtedly be the strongest characters in the game so these characters will be redone for Ultra Street Fighter 4 but what happens next?
8563701	8569766	It took six years to go from Street Fighter 2 to Street Fighter 3 and nine years to go from Street Fighter 3 to Street Fighter 4.
8570607	8576012	So it would probably take us until the year 2018 before Street Fighter 5 comes out.
8577013	8579075	So yes, no Street Fighter 5 until 2018.
8579415	8583899	But look forward to, insert adjective here, Street Fighter 4 each and every year until then.
8584312	8585573	Single adjective, please.
8587175	8589958	In 2018, I'll be turning 40 and that makes me sad.
8590298	8592480	And you'll be 42.
8592520	8594963	40 also, not 42.
8596845	8599407	But at least we'll have Street Fighter V at our birthday party to celebrate.
8599427	8600428	We can both be quiet.
8602310	8603651	I have three years for that shit.
8604572	8604873	That's right.
8605113	8607135	You forgot 40 and amazing.
8608942	8609002	O.L.R.
8621210	8626233	Hey kids, come listen to our super cool show about games.
8627053	8630555	I tried to play this Kinect shit and broke my hip.
8630715	8633016	All you guys listening, you're all getting older too.
8636238	8638039	We do have listeners that are older than us.
8638259	8639119	You guys will all be like 30.
8642941	8646064	My 30s are awesome, for the record.
8646384	8647846	All right, let's get to the mailbag.
8647886	8650108	Speaking of our listeners, we love to hear from our listeners.
8650128	8650588	No, we don't.
8650728	8651910	I mean, yeah, we do.
8652010	8652410	Shut up.
8652510	8653091	Of course we do.
8653111	8654432	We love to hear from our listeners every week.
8655573	8658916	And you can email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
8659256	8664141	Dark Sakura will be peer pressured into reading her favorite emails here on the show.
8666123	8666663	Read the emails.
8667304	8668205	God dang, Rob.
8669861	8671201	Hi all, Raginator here.
8671581	8674022	Here's a last second short random question.
8674442	8678343	What is the worst game each of you have played and what qualifies said games as being the worst?
8678763	8683544	I can tell you one that was so bad that Dan and I took it back to Blockbuster and requested a refund.
8684604	8686365	That was like some wrestling game.
8686445	8688405	It was Thunder, like WCW Thunder.
8689585	8693286	This was when we were on a really big wrestling kick and it was just bad.
8693586	8694907	We were like, what the hell is this?
8695267	8696107	And also Spice World.
8698240	8701847	Fusion Frenzy 2 is the worst game in recent memory that I've played.
8701887	8703170	It was so fucking bad.
8707105	8707505	Yaris.
8708946	8710206	That was going to be my answer.
8711027	8711607	Me too, me too.
8712327	8712628	Fair enough.
8712748	8713828	Alright, that's it?
8714168	8715529	Yeah.
8716089	8716870	God, this is long.
8718110	8724653	With links to YouTube that I am not going to address because, first of all, can't watch YouTube on my iPad.
8724753	8725313	Thank you.
8725634	8726674	You can watch YouTube on your iPad.
8726694	8728175	Yes, I can, but not during the show.
8728895	8730037	All right, just to be clear.
8730378	8731079	Stop it.
8731861	8732962	This is from WellStillUT.
8733904	8734605	Greetings, OLR.
8735026	8736869	First off, I hope you guys enjoyed your week off.
8737310	8738873	I might have if I still had a job.
8740686	8741907	I know we can all use one.
8742227	8746031	Anyway, I thought I'd share some thoughts about Phil Fish's recent childish outburst.
8746411	8750815	First of all, I'm greatly disappointed that you guys didn't properly present Marcus Beer's complaint.
8751816	8759382	At least to me, he seemed more angry than Phil Fish and Jonathan Blow were acting as though being asked questions was some sort of unreasonable burden.
8759702	8760763	In case you haven't, Link...
8762927	8766390	I'd certainly love to see what Phil Fish and Jonathan Blow said to Game Informer leading up to this.
8766830	8775778	However, with only Marcus' initial rant and Fish's immature response, it just looks like a lot of grief could have been saved with more boilerplate noncommittal response.
8776899	8778240	Which leads me to my position.
8778260	8783745	Phil Fish cancelled Fez 2 and is leaving the game industry just because a few people called out his condescending nonsense.
8784221	8796268	Seriously, I'm some insignificant twit in Miami who gets worse every time he sends an email to the show saying something someone doesn't like, but do you see me pitching my skirt and running away?
8797289	8797509	No.
8798049	8802052	Only reason I haven't sent an email lately is because I've not had anything to say before this.
8802572	8805434	You ask me, Marcus is 100% right on this.
8805994	8811237	If you don't have anything to say, or you're looking for confirmation, you can say so.
8811937	8812158	If you...
8813358	8816519	You can give a rote we do not comment on rumors and speculation if you like.
8817160	8825703	However, unless you're going to do a massive TV and radio advertisement carpet bombing, it's not a good idea to treat the press like they're the worst thing that's ever existed.
8826563	8835247	If they're not asking anything personal or trying to create controversy for page hits, then treat them with the measure of respect that you want them to treat you, or more importantly, your game.
8836327	8839029	Honestly, I hope the press takes Marcus Spears' advice.
8839149	8851277	I hope Blow and Fish, especially Fish, have trouble for the rest of their careers finding press who want to endure their nonsensical whining because that's the only thing that hostile assholes deserve.
8851737	8861363	Unfortunately, I know that Fish will come back, probably with Kickstarter for Fez 2, and get his goal times a billion because misgamers stop thinking for themselves when words like innovation and independent are thrown about.
8862344	8866685	This is, of course, while many other developers in the year know struggle to gain any attention at all.
8867105	8868646	There truly is no justice in the world.
8869786	8874928	Anyway, I had a quick question unrelated to this nonsense.
8875468	8885771	Recently, Giant Bomb had a quick look of Dynasty Warriors 8, in which the only bit of information that could be gleaned from the entire hour they looked at it was that the Xbox 360 version was a poorly done port.
8886631	8889613	Why was there so little information for such a long video?
8889693	8895716	Because Jeff and Vinny were devoted to hammering the hit X joke into the ground and whining about how they hated the series as a whole.
8896537	8900739	Anyway, I've never played a Musou game before and was mainly scared off of them.
8900839	8905942	As it seems, many of the media outlets I frequent have the same attitude of dismissing the games at first glance.
8905962	8908623	Then you need to read Destructoid and Jim...
8909784	8911065	Jim Sterling, a huge fan of that.
8911125	8914808	See, some people... Sorry to interrupt, DarkSakura, but some people are here for that.
8914908	8922794	And I think either you're kind of like a fan of those types of games where it's... Some people get great pleasure out of button-mashing X and kill, kill, kill, die, die, die.
8923194	8925796	You just need to follow... See, that's the thing with reviewers.
8925836	8929098	You can't just take some anonymous reviewer's opinion for it.
8929118	8930219	You gotta look at what they like.
8931140	8938225	And if they like similar games that you like, then that's the reviewer you follow as far as whether you may like something that... If they...
8939526	8940026	That's stupid.
8940046	8940086	Um...
8963138	8964359	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8981297	8998619	I'm not saying focus necessarily on just one but you do have to kind of you have to find those that kind of mesh well with your taste and I think like Loki said I don't know much about these Jim Sterling reviews but it sounds like if he's more of a fan of these maybe this is at least a good counterbalance to what you saw happen over on there's more in the email okay sorry there's a lot more in the email all right
8999199	9008505	However, I read a blog defending the series, and this was on Giant Bomb, and was immediately struck by the calm yet passionate defense of the series and the blogger's reactions for loving it as he does.
9009005	9014748	Intrigued by the case he made, I picked up Warriors Orochi 3 Hyper for Wii U as a sort of test for how I'd feel.
9015349	9025515	I ended up enjoying the game immensely and have since picked up Dynasty Warriors 8 for the PS3 and the original Warriors Orochi for 360, in addition to importing the PS3 version of Dynasty Warriors 7 Empires.
9026375	9036284	I think about this now against the current backdrop of people passionately tearing apart reviewers for having a less than positive opinion of Dragon's Crown to the point where Atlas had to defend controversial reviews.
9037605	9045111	By the way, my problem with Dragon's Crown is just the... I love and hate the art style in that game, and that's really what I hate.
9045451	9049555	Did you see the minigame where the girl's chained up and you can touch her and she squirms?
9049850	9051731	Yeah, I hate that.
9052752	9054053	Anyway, going onward.
9054794	9071245	While I don't like the game either after having played it, I can safely assume that were I on the fence, controversial ranting we're seeing now would not have driven me to try the way the game, the way the impassioned and mature defensive dynasty warriors I mentioned earlier had moved me.
9072206	9073887	With that in mind, here's my inquiry.
9075464	9076605	I thought it was a short question.
9076966	9078187	Okay.
9078207	9079388	I'm sorry, RawStillUT.
9079488	9084613	I actually really like your emails because of how well written they are and just how well you lay out your ideas.
9085242	9085642	You know what?
9085682	9089944	I do appreciate that he does come back when he's got something to say.
9090164	9090344	Yes.
9091285	9092946	With that in mind, here's my inquiry.
9093346	9095667	Uh-oh, I need to make sure I don't get kicked out of chat.
9095727	9095967	Oops.
9096648	9096888	Okay.
9098909	9107273	First, why does defending something often turn into attacks on disagreeing reviewers despite it being counterproductive to the apparent goal of winning over the indecisive?
9107873	9109794	Well, to go on that first, I mean, look at freaking politics.
9110606	9111186	Oh God, yes.
9111887	9112847	I think that's more human nature.
9112867	9113948	That's not something specific to gaming.
9113968	9114388	That's human nature.
9114648	9115589	Yeah, that's human nature.
9115629	9116389	My way or the highway.
9116429	9121692	And as I mentioned in part A, people actually do get a positive chemical response from having other people agree with them.
9122653	9134900	And by presenting their own information, I think it's a dopamine response where people actually feel better attacking something that's outside their scope of understanding.
9134960	9136801	It feels good to be validated and affirmated?
9136861	9137381	Get out.
9139662	9140343	I understand.
9140523	9145906	But for some people, they actually take that aggression side of it and get kind of an adrenaline rush off of it.
9146707	9152350	You know, you get into that, especially the more passionate you feel about something, you stop really caring about what other people think.
9152850	9153931	Your idea or nothing.
9154631	9156913	And you do get an emotional rush out of it.
9157073	9160695	So it really is just basic biochemistry and psychology.
9162015	9164216	Anybody else want to expand?
9164336	9166376	Nah, go ahead, because I know there's at least a couple more.
9166516	9171517	Second, have you ever been moved by an unpopular game's defenders to give said game a chance?
9172257	9172877	Mass Effect.
9175397	9176598	Yeah, Mass Effect is a good example.
9176618	9179638	I mean, it wasn't unpopular, but a lot of people, I wasn't going to give it a chance.
9179838	9183839	Well, at the time, remember, we got into it right when Mass Effect 3 had first come out.
9183899	9184219	Exactly.
9184239	9187599	There was all that ending wank, so I don't know about the unpopular part.
9188760	9189980	Well, God, even just this week,
9191000	9192301	I gave Team Fortress 2 a try.
9192341	9195803	I didn't think I'd like it, but Actdeft was like, no, you gotta try, you gotta try.
9195883	9198105	I think it's a massively unpopular game.
9198125	9198685	Yeah, that's true.
9198725	9200766	I guess Team Fortress isn't really unpopular either.
9201387	9204249	Well, God, what about the music games we used to play for years?
9204529	9206230	I don't think those cracked into the mainstream.
9206823	9209545	Well, and I actually liked Kraken DJ for a while.
9209725	9210566	I thought that was fun.
9210846	9212067	And a lot of people were like, eh.
9214609	9221694	I know that there were others because, like, some of the weirder treasure games that people were kind of poo-pooing on I thought were great.
9221754	9223395	You know, like, I liked Chameleon Twist.
9224256	9225797	I liked Mischief Makers.
9225937	9226938	Those were fun games.
9227599	9227839	You know?
9228779	9229160	Anything?
9229180	9231261	Okay.
9232062	9233343	Anyway, keep up the good work, guys.
9233583	9235004	I look forward to your response.
9235104	9236045	Regards, RawsteelUT.
9236065	9236245	Okay.
9237096	9237456	Alright.
9238176	9238637	Two more to go.
9238657	9239097	Alright.
9239637	9245859	Dearest denizens of Podcastopia, so I got a summons for jury duty for next week.
9245899	9246359	I'm sorry.
9247340	9255662	I didn't know on what day this week I will have to drag my happy ass out of bed to be at the courthouse at 8am to do my civic duty, but I do know that day is not Monday.
9255762	9259944	This gives me at least one day to download a game off PSN to play on my Vita.
9260504	9261204	What should I get?
9261724	9269066	Preferably, I'd like something that won't make a lot of noise but will require me to make a lot of movements that look vaguely threatening to old people.
9269787	9271527	Stay black, Red Entertainment, Trainer.
9274928	9276849	Gaming during jury duty is great.
9276869	9278489	There is going to be long periods of waiting.
9279755	9280295	and you know what?
9280796	9283037	You know the Sacramento Courthouse that make you turn off all your devices.
9283577	9283838	What?
9283938	9285599	When you're in the selection.
9285619	9287420	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
9287460	9291262	But I mean like while you're waiting in the jury hall, while you're waiting in the hallway.
9291402	9296445	I have always spent more time in the stupid jury selection than I have ever in the lines.
9297946	9301769	So any suggestions for Vita games that make you look vaguely spasmodic?
9305571	9307452	Not that don't involve Kinect.
9308133	9308553	Katamari!
9308573	9308733	Katamari!
9310968	9326965	LittleBigPlanet maybe I can't recommend this because the game is bad but a fighting game involves Capcom X Tekken so that'll be mashing the buttons and looking mean
9329936	9332798	I definitely see looks of frustration in playing that, so that makes sense.
9333679	9334940	So we do have one last email.
9336060	9337862	Hey, OLR crew, AZHP here.
9338602	9341665	I never asked, is it AzHP or AZHP?
9341805	9344567	I think it's AZHP, because I thought the HP was Harry Potter.
9344858	9347719	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9364264	9365625	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9384256	9386738	The vibe we got from the convention was super positive.
9387299	9388340	The game room was lots of fun.
9388400	9394184	I got to play the Japanese version of Project Diva F, the Saturn version of Puzzle Bobble, and typing of the Dead on Dreamcast.
9395165	9401611	I was actually surprised there weren't that many furries at the convention, given that I know a lot of gamers are also furries.
9401651	9406194	There were a couple, because they were even advertising a furry con that's coming up, had one of the booths.
9406675	9410458	So, you know, hey, whatever you like, as long as it's, you know, consensual.
9411423	9414686	I unfortunately wasn't able to stay late enough to catch the podcast panel.
9414726	9418589	I definitely regret missing my chance to say hi to Rob.
9419209	9419770	Squinty face.
9419910	9420610	As you should.
9421371	9423412	Anyway, I definitely recommend people check it out.
9423532	9425014	It's definitely a fun experience.
9425074	9425714	Well, definitely.
9425854	9426655	Lots of definitely's there.
9427175	9429977	Check it out again next year if it's in San Francisco again.
9430058	9431218	Yours truly is HP.
9431939	9432439	P.S.
9432559	9435702	If you guys are interested, here's a picture of the Zelda costume my girlfriend wore.
9436050	9460715	I actually looked at the picture and I saw her which must have mean I saw you at some point and I was like wow that is fucking good so feel free to link in the chat I helped make the harp so it was cool hearing people compliment it at the convention so I'm pulling it up very nice yeah it was very good yeah if you can put that in chat I'm sure the chatters like to see that very well done
9461613	9466035	I think, yeah, I saw her in the gaming room playing one of the dancing games.
9466055	9466575	Yeah, yeah.
9466595	9470417	All right, well, I'm going to copy this if I didn't actually close the window.
9471898	9473738	All right, that's it for emails tonight, right?
9474319	9477440	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
9477460	9481942	We're almost to 9 o'clock, so let's try to jam through the rest of this pretty quick because I do want to get in some calls.
9482982	9486364	So we're going to go to the FUs of the week.
9502318	9502918	DarkSakura.
9504078	9507619	I was debating whether or not I wanted to say their name on air, but I'm going to.
9508339	9520122	So, F you to Bonnie Plumbing, Heating, and Air for giving indications of being the type of hypocritical conservative Christians that I personally do not like.
9521802	9522242	Allegedly.
9523162	9523822	And you're Loki.
9524623	9525243	Oh, and my battery.
9527130	9533495	F you to my car for I'm not really sure what it's doing but whenever I turn all the way to the right my radio shuts off.
9535036	9536017	That's weird.
9536097	9536417	Yeah.
9536477	9537458	That's a little creepy.
9538339	9545904	F you to this fucking con plague I've been carrying since Tuesday and F you to Extifer who allegedly gave it to me.
9546305	9546725	Allegedly.
9547546	9547786	Alan.
9548326	9555372	F you to the associated dental issues that someone can get when they're in their 30s and also F you to the fact that I think Sanrio
9556152	9558973	I wonder why she would have chewed that
9574118	9574518	It's weird.
9574538	9576941	I'm going to have to buy a new headset.
9577282	9578523	It's like $40 that I don't have.
9579845	9580405	Alright, there it is.
9580425	9581166	You have Fuse of the Week.
9581767	9582027	Loki.
9583069	9584230	Alright.
9584410	9585812	So more Xbox One news.
9585832	9590158	This is once again something else that they've kind of changed their mind on.
9590678	9596244	and that was the whole inclusion of a chat headset with the Xbox One.
9596444	9600648	Yes, the Xbox One Day One Edition will come with a chat headset.
9601349	9604331	So, it'll be very much like it was with the Xbox 360.
9604391	9608015	Originally, they were planning not to include one of those and you'd have to buy it separately.
9608616	9611498	So, good to know you're getting some more value for your $500.
9615526	9616086	Hooray!
9616226	9618148	I guess a lot of people are very excited about that.
9618668	9619769	More value is good.
9620810	9632537	And also, hooray, I want to end on a positive note tonight because unfortunately a lot of times we have to talk about gaming studios that are closing and people that are out of a job, but tonight we get to say hooray!
9633018	9643785	In Vancouver, Namco Bandai is opening a new office and it's going to be dedicated to mobile and online titles, but about 30 people working there in Vancouver are
9644225	9645165	making these titles.
9645285	9648586	No word, of course, on what those games are, but yay.
9649306	9652186	And since this is a Namco story, can I say something real quick?
9652386	9652727	Please do.
9653027	9654627	They're talking about this in chat.
9656207	9661268	Pac-Man Champion Edition DX is coming to Steam with its DX Plus version.
9661848	9666129	Out of respect for DarkSakura, I will say I purchased early, purchased in advance.
9666769	9668549	I did not pre-purchase because that's not a thing.
9669309	9670650	I purchased early the game.
9670810	9671870	Oh, stop feeding her.
9671890	9672490	Okay.
9673010	9674511	Alan is perfectly right.
9674871	9679592	If you purchase early, because it's not going to be playable until September 24th, and they took my $9.99.
9679672	9685274	So if you purchase early, you'll get what I think is going to be a DLC pack.
9685314	9688995	It's extra songs, extra maps, and you can play as the little Dig Dug avatar.
9689275	9691316	I thought some of that was supposed to be part of it anyway.
9691436	9692776	And a little race car avatar.
9692816	9698358	Well it says Actdeft in chat pasted the Steam link and it'll say purchase now and you'll get all this crap.
9699018	9702879	So new Pac-Man or Pac-Man DX is such an amazing game.
9703479	9704740	Yeah it is a great Pac-Man game.
9704780	9705340	It's coming to Steam.
9705760	9706020	All right.
9706381	9707802	We're going to open up the phones now.
9708203	9708824	It's that time.
9708844	9716232	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to give us a call and talk with us about anything we've talked about tonight.
9716733	9719496	Or maybe you have something that we didn't cover that you want to talk about.
9720076	9720236	But...
9722096	9722496	There it is.
9722556	9723637	The phones are open.
9723657	9725918	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype.
9726058	9727119	Orange Lounge Radio.
9727179	9730541	I saw at least one tweet come through that I want to get to here quickly.
9731481	9733042	Otherwise, do we have any last-minute stories?
9733283	9734283	Loki, DarkSakura?
9734964	9738986	Yeah, I can talk real quick about... They announced... Well, I knew about them, but...
9739266	9739566	Wreck-It-Ralph
9761371	9784281	They're going to have the Phineas and Ferb, or Phineas and Agent P And then of course, like I said, Wreck-It Ralph, Vanellope And then kind of some one-offs, they have Rapunzel from Tangled, Jack Skellington, and Mickey from Fantasia We actually have a call on the line, you can probably hear the coffee in the background We have a call on the line, hi, you're on Orange Sons Radio, who's this?
9785219	9786520	Hello, it's Codeman.
9786560	9787620	Hey Codeman, how you doing?
9788380	9791101	Sorry for the Facebook sounds, Rob.
9791461	9792202	You better be.
9792862	9793922	I guess I can forgive.
9794543	9795463	Was that you coughing?
9796563	9797244	Do what?
9797264	9798144	Was that you coughing?
9798424	9799224	Or was that the little one?
9800305	9801105	Oh no, she's asleep.
9801245	9801665	Oh, okay.
9801705	9802166	Well, what's up?
9803126	9807908	Oh no, I was just wanting to know if everyone's excited about August 13th.
9808048	9810489	I am totally jazzed about Tuesday.
9811613	9814955	and why why is this Disney Infinity or what is it that you're excited about?
9814975	9815515	DuckTales isn't it?
9815876	9816616	Oh DuckTales.
9816636	9817677	DuckTales Remastered.
9817697	9822600	Oh yes yes I am excited about that yes so excited I forgot the day.
9824080	9836648	Well and like what I was just so fan I mean I was just amazed about like they brought back every single voice actor yes that has ever played in the DuckTales series and and
9837448	9838529	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9859554	9860676	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9874714	9877716	But, I mean, I'm excited, so excited about the game.
9877977	9879418	How do you guys feel about the game?
9879518	9881899	Obviously, you're probably pretty excited about it.
9882000	9886383	Yes, I will definitely be picking it up, but even I can't decide what platform do I get it on.
9886443	9891046	Because I could do PC, I could do Wii U, because, you know, it's kind of the newest thing out there.
9891106	9894569	I could get PlayStation 3, because, you know, trophies or whatever.
9894849	9896830	Xbox 360s, where a lot of my friends will probably be.
9897271	9897611	I don't know.
9897771	9898872	I don't know what system to get it on.
9899312	9899993	Have you decided?
9900013	9900053	No.
9900977	9909339	Um, unfortunately, I don't think they're releasing it for the Mac, so I can't get it on Steam, but I can, I think I'm going to be picking it up on the Wii U. And why is that?
9910519	9919641	Well, because, I don't know, it's just nostalgic of, like, it being on Nintendo, like, when I used to play it when I was a kid, and so, like, I feel like I should play it on a Nintendo console.
9919661	9924382	It sounds stupid, but, I don't know, I just feel like I should play it on a Nintendo console.
9924798	9925599	Okay, fair enough.
9925739	9933865	I think I might end up getting it on Wii U, because at least it does have the off-screen play, which, you know, as little as it is, it is something the other platforms don't get.
9934406	9937328	And I think Xbox 360 is delayed anyway, so that's out.
9937648	9937929	Sorry.
9937989	9944574	Yeah, I think it's September... I could be wrong, but I think it's September 13th or 14th, but I could be wrong.
9944694	9949338	It's not a part of their ongoing promotion, so they kind of screwed up on that one, in my opinion.
9950374	9960882	I am, that's what I enjoy about the whole Earthbound thing is, you know, because my wife, you know, she might want to watch Hulu or Netflix or something and I could just sit here on my Wii U tablet and play Earthbound all night.
9960902	9962163	So that was really cool.
9962183	9965346	Oh, Nintendo wants you to sell some Wii U's.
9965386	9966667	That's exactly what they want to hear.
9967948	9970049	No, I love that about that console.
9970069	9974012	And then, you know, I picked up, you know, Metroid, you know, and all that stuff.
9974052	9977575	And so, like, I can just sit there on my, you know, tablet and play that.
9977635	9978716	So that's really cool.
9979705	9980125	Excellent.
9980486	9982867	Well, anything else you're looking forward to over these coming weeks?
9984429	9986910	Um, well, I mean, not really.
9986950	9991794	I mean, I'm going to be playing the hell out of DuckTales, so that's probably the only thing I'm going to be playing for a while.
9991814	9995496	I've been playing Don't Starve for, it has stolen my life.
9995697	9999199	It literally has, I mean, that game, I don't know if you've played it yet.
9999539	10005604	I haven't, not yet, but tell the listeners more about it for those that don't know, because you have been trying to get me in on this game.
10006516	10008597	Well, Don't Starve is basically a roguelike game.
10008637	10009937	I mean, you start out at day one.
10011137	10013098	It is the title.
10013138	10020220	I mean, you're basically trying to survive, and you just continue on and on and on, and you go through all the seasons.
10020300	10021921	You start out in spring.
10022081	10030524	Well, actually, I think you start in the summer, and then you go into the spring, and then you go into the winter, and then everything has everything to do with, like, you have to build...
10031864	10033525	Thanks for watching!
10052739	10064364	Day 34 or something in the winter and I just ran out of food because nothing grows in the winter and then I died at Day 34 and it just starts you back at Day 1 with nothing.
10064764	10076490	I haven't played a roguelike game in forever so it's very frustrating but it's a very fun game and I would suggest anybody on Steam to buy it and play the hell out of it.
10076890	10078210	I think it's $14.99 and that's everything.
10078230	10078911	They update it
10082112	10083433	Thanks for calling in.
10083553	10087296	Do you have anything you need to plug?
10087336	10088517	Want to plug before we get out?
10109173	10109814	No, not really.
10109854	10112315	I mean, we still have our podcast.
10112335	10113896	We still do it from time to time.
10114237	10115397	We've mostly moved to YouTube.
10115437	10122722	We do Google Hangouts, but it's the YouTube.com backslash the Down for Maintenance podcast.
10122742	10126765	Well, I think it's like the DFM podcast, but you can look us up on YouTube.
10126805	10129187	And then I have a YouTube channel, but I mean...
10129827	10130928	It's really hard to remember.
10131168	10136792	I mean, it's youtube.com backslash ctaylor1785 because YouTube won't let me change it.
10137273	10138694	Dope.
10139474	10143657	But yeah, you should do more Let's Plays, Rob.
10143778	10150723	You know, I was gifted by a kind listener another scary game called Paranormal, and that is up on the list of things I need to play, too.
10151523	10154125	Holy crap, that game is fantastic.
10154365	10155887	I hate it and love it all at the same time.
10155907	10157608	I'm not sure if I'm looking forward to it.
10157688	10158989	All right, Codeman, I'm going to let you go, buddy.
10159921	10161102	All right, well, I'll talk to you guys later.
10161162	10161682	All right, take care.
10162402	10162802	All right, bye.
10162842	10163023	Bye.
10163643	10165524	All right, and our phones are lighting up.
10165564	10168285	We got another call coming in right now, so let's go to the phones.
10168325	10169306	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10169326	10169666	Who's this?
10170146	10170746	This is Shane.
10170966	10172027	Hey, Shane, how you doing?
10173128	10173908	I'm hot.
10173968	10175649	It's like really hot here right now.
10175849	10177630	Isn't it like... You should come to California.
10178250	10179291	Isn't it hotter there?
10179311	10179931	Yeah, probably.
10179951	10181111	But not at night, so come here.
10183191	10183912	Yeah, maybe.
10184032	10186076	We're not Phoenix or anything, and it's a dry read.
10186676	10187518	Phoenix is terrible.
10187638	10188119	It is terrible.
10188159	10188479	What's up?
10189681	10190783	Um, Pokemon.
10191965	10194388	Oh, did you hear my little dedication to you earlier?
10195089	10197994	Yeah, I take some issues with that dedication.
10199055	10199435	Why?
10199975	10201936	Well, first of all, you ended it too quick.
10202176	10204796	Like, there's never enough time to talk about Pokemon.
10206236	10217339	Like, okay, for example, my job today, I had a demo, and I was demoing the new Mario and Luigi game, and all the people that showed up pretty much just wanted to talk Pokemon with me, which I was fine with.
10217399	10218019	That was fun.
10218919	10220279	Way more fun than demoing a game.
10220939	10223500	But, yeah, like...
10224620	10232866	I don't like the thought that it should have stopped after 151 Pokemon.
10233006	10233687	Sorry, Jamie.
10235188	10238950	Just because that would have been boring.
10239050	10246396	You have to keep the series going, and if you only had the same 151, we're like 15 years now or something like that since they first came out.
10247196	10248498	That would have been terrible.
10248798	10252503	So yeah, we're at 649 plus whatever new ones are in here.
10252543	10253744	But it's still really fun.
10253784	10258089	And these mega evolutions, like the new trailer that was posted is awesome.
10258189	10259691	And it reminds me of Power Rangers.
10260192	10261413	So I am on board.
10261533	10262094	Wait a minute.
10262114	10262314	100% on board.
10262975	10265439	Wait a minute, because the other night you said, I don't know.
10266000	10269204	I know, but then they put a trailer that made it look like Power Rangers to me.
10269525	10270786	And that is all you need to do.
10272028	10277576	If there's more blue in the trailer and maybe some Taco Bell, which I'm still kind of boycotting.
10278437	10304886	um wait you're boycotting Taco Bell yes they got rid of some stuff I liked oh that's right they got rid of the volcano stuff I forgot yeah and I really like that conversation the other night uh Fifth Dream in our chat room with a question for Shane hey they don't ask us questions anymore they ask the callers questions Fifth Dream wants to know Shane did you watch any of the Pokemon championships yes and I didn't want to I was just really bored I was like okay this will be fun and that's my sarcastic voice so I put it on it was so fun
10305866	10307267	It was really fun to watch.
10307567	10314392	And I watched some of the finals today before work, and I was getting excited, and there was no reason to.
10314853	10319356	And I feel like it was when I liked basketball, when the NCAA tournament was going on.
10319676	10322078	I just got sucked in, and it was amazing.
10323706	10343333	and what what what was it the Pokemon card game or was it the um they had the card game later today which I was at work for so I couldn't watch that it was the actual like video games wow and Nintendo let him stream it well because it's Nintendo sponsored me and my friend Danny we want to go to next year's championships it's in DC this year was in Vancouver
10344053	10370718	but like they get all sorts of cool stuff they have all this merchandise and like things that you won't find anywhere else just at the world championships and like today or yesterday they announced a new mega evolution and that they haven't put out anywhere else and they announced that they're gonna have a soundtrack out on iTunes this November for X and Y that's gonna have 220 tracks good lord yeah that's ridiculous
10371536	10371937	Oh my gosh.
10371957	10373158	And I will have it day one.
10373258	10376963	So what's the countdown to X and Y at this point?
10377003	10377724	How many days left?
10378886	10381148	It's like almost exactly two months.
10381309	10382350	Tomorrow will be two months.
10382390	10384232	But for me, I don't know because I'll get it early.
10384313	10386716	So sucks to be everybody else.
10386816	10387156	Rub it in.
10387477	10389820	But at least you have Final Fantasy XIV to hold you over, right?
10390307	10390948	Yes, yes.
10391048	10409122	And I learned today 100% because they put some sort of graph out that if I get the PS3 collector's edition, which I'm getting through Amazon because I had gift cards, so it's fully paid off and I apply it to my current PC account, I will be able to play on both for the free 30 days.
10409283	10413886	And because I'm an old player, my 30 days won't kick in until September 10th.
10413946	10414427	So I'll have
10414767	10422674	from the 24th of August till September 10th, not paying anything, and then September 11th for the next 30 days for free as well.
10424176	10424596	There you go.
10424716	10426858	And you get all that Collector's Edition crap that you don't need.
10428460	10428840	Don't need?
10431141	10433722	that's rude what's in there that you need?
10434162	10452128	the book, the art book is going to be fantastic the baby soundtrack because the other soundtrack is just way too expensive and I don't have anything that can play it except for a PS3 even though I want the little pet and the box that's acceptable to say, right?
10452528	10459611	because the box looks cool alright, fair enough exactly alright Shane, anything else before we let you go?
10461325	10484698	everybody should watch that new trailer it has like rock music that plays during it and it's like remixed I think of a gym theme and seriously if it doesn't remind you of Power Rangers which is what I'm seeing from everybody's comments everywhere on the internet that I'm looking right now you're crazy because the end with the five of them lined up and their mega evolutions it's totally Power Rangers it's awesome alright anything you want to plug while you're here on the show
10486131	10514103	um well I just played Pokemon X and Y and we talked about Final Fantasy 14 um yes sure apparently there's a really cool Konami game in Japan called Sound Voltex and I've watched videos and it's awesome somebody I guess cracked it so you can play on your PC and there are websites now building controllers for the Sound Voltex game that you can buy that you'd be able to hook up to your PC and play it and that game is so cool looking you need to link me this
10514833	10517935	I need to get a link to sound Voltex or for the controller?
10517975	10522619	The controller is like 300 and some dollars for some reason.
10522639	10524000	I can link you the gameplay.
10524060	10524360	It's amazing.
10524380	10524860	We'll talk on Facebook.
10524880	10525341	How about that?
10525361	10525661	All right.
10525721	10527042	Get on the case, Nancy Drew.
10528343	10529183	My name is Shane.
10530344	10530604	All right.
10530684	10531345	Bye, Shane.
10531745	10533527	Bye.
10533547	10537970	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10538610	10540172	I'm going to some tweets real quick.
10540212	10542555	I'm going to do these pretty quick here because we're running kind of late tonight.
10543256	10552567	DarkTetsuya sends the show a tweet that says, Hey, just to note, the latest version of Super Mario Crossover or 3.0 is now out and it's available at ExplodingRabbit.com.
10552587	10553868	Did they do a Kickstarter for that one?
10554489	10563474	No, they did a Kickstarter for their game that's not quite that game, but all the characters changed to slightly renamed and their own original levels.
10563674	10564474	Got it, got it.
10566015	10572158	Actdeft says the King of Fighters 13 Steam Edition trailer was leaked in the Steam store and removed.
10572678	10576000	So King of Fighters 13 probably coming to Steam at some point.
10577100	10605018	TigerClaw sent us a tweet Imagi Studios originally was going to make a Legend of Zelda movie check out the short movie pitch video and he linked us to YouTube I actually did see this earlier in the week and it did look pretty cool although there was no I don't believe there was any voices in it but it did it looked interesting but you know Nintendo is crazy possessive over their IPs ever since that Super Mario Brothers movie was a stink bomb so I'm not surprised they didn't get to go forward with it but it sure made a great little YouTube to look at
10605979	10606940	Did you guys see that at all?
10607101	10609043	The little concept, the Zelda pitch?
10609344	10609624	No.
10609824	10610666	No, it was neat.
10611707	10616193	All right, I'll give it one more minute to see if anybody's going to call in, but if not, we'll close up shop.
10616213	10619918	1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10620419	10622602	Anybody else have a last-minute story for us tonight?
10623447	10629431	Well, actually, not necessarily a story, but I'm going to start making my 3DS cases.
10630151	10630392	Oh, yeah?
10630632	10632673	And put them available to sell before too long.
10632873	10633614	Is that an Etsy thing?
10634094	10634895	I might do it on Etsy.
10635435	10636275	Either that or Store Envy.
10636315	10637196	I'm still deciding.
10637556	10640238	And why would somebody want a 3DS case from DarkSakura?
10640378	10645021	Because they are well-made and protect your system a lot better than those flip-open cases do.
10646322	10646742	Fair enough.
10646782	10648183	All right, we do have one more call coming in.
10648223	10650665	This will probably be the last one for tonight, so let's go to it.
10650705	10651586	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10651606	10651966	Who's this?
10655148	10657550	Hello, it's Orange Lounge Radio.
10658491	10658831	Hello.
10659112	10659552	Hi.
10660553	10661013	Who's this?
10662034	10662815	Hey, this is Actdeft.
10662915	10664316	Hey, Actdeft, and we see you.
10664377	10665698	It's a video call.
10666599	10667159	Hello.
10668300	10669501	Is that a My Little Pony?
10670722	10672044	No, it's a Pokemon.
10672204	10673385	Oh, it's a Pokemon.
10673405	10676348	Uh-oh, Shane's going to kill me for that one, too.
10676368	10679350	You know, I need to get my plus and minus ones back from Julie and send them to Shane.
10679931	10680792	Which Pokemon is that?
10682355	10692948	It's the Pokemon Black and White Legendary Rush Around Oh, okay, alright It's a Loki doll, so yeah So did you just call in tonight to show off your plushie?
10693909	10700978	Not really, I want to talk about Pac-Man CDX Plus Ah, the game that Alan was talking about earlier, right?
10701724	10707847	Yeah, I'm pretty excited about it because I'm a fan of Pac-Man C or Championship Edition.
10707887	10709167	I played the hell out of it.
10710047	10717571	I even got in the tops, way in the beginning when it was released, I was in the top 40 scores of that game.
10717931	10718691	Holy crap.
10719091	10723133	Yeah, like I said, I played it a lot, like a freaking lot.
10723829	10734193	So I'm pretty excited to have or at least being able to play DX because what I have seen about it, it seems pretty damn cool.
10736594	10741796	And mostly the reason, I haven't even been able to play it.
10745023	10749065	It's because it's not available in Mexico for some reason.
10749505	10750125	I don't know why.
10750986	10754467	So I'm pretty stoked that it's coming to Steam.
10754847	10759269	Even since the announcement, it was a few months ago.
10759289	10761150	I don't remember when exactly.
10762211	10768073	But I'm pretty excited to see it now being able to purchase ahead.
10769014	10770734	Not to say pre-purchase or pre-order.
10773527	10775148	You got everybody trained, DarkSakura.
10775748	10776068	What?
10777209	10781291	He took great care to make sure he said purchase ahead and not pre-purchase.
10781351	10786073	Yes, which is how it should be because it's wrong to put unnecessary prefix.
10786093	10787214	Didn't you listen to George Carlin?
10787914	10788574	Jeez, Rob.
10790175	10791156	How dare I speak up.
10791796	10801740	The only sad part is that we have to wait at least one month and a half to be able to play it since it releases on the 25th
10803533	10807916	So yeah, but the extra content will be pretty good too.
10808457	10811419	The Ralliac skin, the Dick Duck skin.
10812120	10817864	There's even old school Pac-Man skin, so that's going to be pretty cool.
10818104	10821167	I just love that this game is how old and they're still supporting it.
10821227	10825070	Like, this was really a pleasant surprise because it was at the point where the game was given...
10825450	10825930	All right.
10825950	10827471	Well, anything else you're looking forward to this year?
10853154	10856955	Well, mostly this coming week, DuckTales, and everyone else.
10857535	10858936	I bet Codeman's happy to hear that.
10858976	10860576	What system are you getting DuckTales on?
10861576	10864497	Most possibly Steam, but I'm still debating on it.
10864817	10865117	Okay.
10865678	10866118	But yeah.
10866738	10867238	Very cool.
10867678	10873260	All right, well, Actdeft, we're going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thank you and your little Pokemon there for calling in, who's waving goodbye.
10873620	10874080	Adorable.
10874160	10874280	Bye.
10874520	10875380	All right, bye, Actdeft.
10875400	10876060	Thanks for the call.
10876501	10877361	We love the video calls.
10877401	10877681	Take care.
10879722	10880443	Alright, that's gonna do it.
10880463	10881804	Shane never answered my question.
10881904	10882685	What was the question?
10882825	10885026	I was gonna see if he wanted my giant Togepi.
10885066	10887328	He probably turned the show off, so don't give it to him.
10887348	10888009	But you know what?
10888129	10888349	What?
10888549	10890391	Did I tell you how I got my giant Togepi?
10891411	10894154	I got held up at gunpoint working at GNC.
10894254	10895415	Oh god, yeah, I did.
10895615	10896636	That's a horrible story.
10896716	10899838	And I found $10 in the parking lot outside Toys R Us.
10901480	10905904	And I went in and I used it to buy myself a giant Togepi.
10906684	10907605	The $20 Togepi.
10907825	10908586	You earned it.
10909607	10913691	And so my giant Togepi was like my comfort creature thing.
10914492	10915393	And my Charmander pillow.
10916033	10918134	Well, we have to wrap up the show, guys.
10918514	10919235	It's about that time.
10919255	10923637	We're running a little long tonight, and Alan and I still have errands to run after the show.
10924117	10925518	So we're going to wrap up the show.
10926338	10927799	I want to start with Alan tonight.
10927859	10929539	Thank you very much for being here tonight.
10930060	10933421	Really appreciate you being on the show and lending your wit and so forth.
10933441	10934222	Don't be a stranger.
10934482	10935402	You know, you only live here.
10936243	10938144	So do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
10941286	10947230	If I can get my headset replaced, I might start doing like an achievement run in Half-Life for Twitch TV.
10947410	10947671	Fun.
10947991	10949252	You think it's time to go wireless?
10950613	10950933	I don't know.
10950953	10952354	I've had bad experiences with wireless.
10953475	10957779	Do you have like a Twitter you want to plug or anything you want to plug if people want to get your wit online?
10957799	10958639	Because you are really funny.
10958659	10960201	I actually am on Twitter a lot now.
10960241	10964124	I finally got Twitter to like how it works.
10964684	10965825	I always just ignore it.
10966365	10968327	It's at salacious underscore pop.
10968786	10970769	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10983746	11011072	no, not really alright, and I will say my final thought tonight is I better be over this damn cold tomorrow because I need to get back to work, I have a ton of work to catch up on from being sick for two days and so this con play can kiss my ass DarkSakura, your final thought tonight I want a house and a job probably in that order in that order
11012230	11013251	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
11027489	11044291	you know what they need to start paying advertising on this program for us to keep talking about them alright in all seriousness thank you for staying with our show tonight and listening to the show after a week off we really appreciate you sticking with us and supporting independent broadcasting and if for whatever reason you listened to this entire show and you thought it was terrible
11044631	11045532	Hey, that's okay.

11076049	11077730	Final Fantasy 14 beta as well.
