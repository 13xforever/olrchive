00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:19,572
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, August 18, 2013, several more changes are announced that will affect the launch of the Xbox One.

2
00:00:19,932 --> 00:00:26,394
[SPEAKER_01]: GameStop defends a high price for used copies of Xenoblade and Metroid Prime, and more details emerge on Grand Theft Auto V.

3
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:33,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet.

4
00:00:33,331 --> 00:00:35,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:36,074 --> 00:00:38,956
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Orange Lounge Radio, episode 516.

6
00:00:40,538 --> 00:00:49,185
[SPEAKER_06]: For this, August the 18th of 2013, we're here to talk about video games, gaming culture, gamer lifestyle, with me, Rob Roberts.

7
00:00:49,265 --> 00:00:54,369
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm one of your hosts, and joining me, as she does every Sunday night, say hello to Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:55,330
[SPEAKER_14]: Yo.

9
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,672
[SPEAKER_06]: How you doing, Dark Sakura, or Jamie Summers?

10
00:00:58,413 --> 00:00:58,493
[SPEAKER_14]: Or...

11
00:00:59,955 --> 00:01:00,876
[SPEAKER_14]: and... All of the above.

12
00:01:01,116 --> 00:01:01,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

13
00:01:01,917 --> 00:01:03,318
[SPEAKER_06]: You can be whoever you want to be.

14
00:01:04,499 --> 00:01:06,180
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I'll be me.

15
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:06,981
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

16
00:01:07,321 --> 00:01:09,122
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, you do... I'm really out of it today.

17
00:01:09,282 --> 00:01:09,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah?

18
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,964
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it's been a weird, weird week.

19
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you on any prescription medications right now?

20
00:01:14,346 --> 00:01:19,830
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I'm always on prescription medications that keep me from killing people on the internet.

21
00:01:21,252 --> 00:01:24,434
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but I mean, like, are you... No, no OxyContin.

22
00:01:24,474 --> 00:01:25,635
[SPEAKER_06]: Six or anything?

23
00:01:25,815 --> 00:01:26,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Any sickness going around?

24
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:30,001
[SPEAKER_15]: I have the rockin' pneumonia and the boogie-woogie flu.

25
00:01:31,082 --> 00:01:31,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry to hear it.

26
00:01:32,223 --> 00:01:32,803
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I'm not.

27
00:01:32,823 --> 00:01:34,465
[SPEAKER_15]: That means I'm happy, I guess.

28
00:01:34,525 --> 00:01:35,706
[SPEAKER_08]: An apparently obscure reference.

29
00:01:35,866 --> 00:01:37,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and there's Techmaster Loki.

30
00:01:37,627 --> 00:01:38,308
[SPEAKER_06]: How you doing, Loki?

31
00:01:38,728 --> 00:01:39,329
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing fine.

32
00:01:39,429 --> 00:01:39,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah?

33
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:40,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

34
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:40,870
[SPEAKER_06]: What's new with you?

35
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:40,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

36
00:01:43,712 --> 00:01:44,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Games.

37
00:01:44,453 --> 00:01:45,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, lots of games.

38
00:01:45,674 --> 00:01:50,079
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get to Gaming Weeks here shortly, but I noticed you brought a big box full of Disney Infinity with you.

39
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:50,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

40
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:57,908
[SPEAKER_06]: So I noticed that you were able to get the game early through your connections, and you put up a YouTube, right?

41
00:01:57,928 --> 00:02:02,673
[SPEAKER_06]: You did a little unboxing YouTube, because information on Disney Infinity has been kind of not...

42
00:02:02,933 --> 00:02:03,913
[SPEAKER_06]: around, really.

43
00:02:04,413 --> 00:02:11,235
[SPEAKER_06]: The review embargo apparently didn't lift until today, or they didn't have early reviews or something.

44
00:02:11,295 --> 00:02:17,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they were afraid the game wasn't going to get good reviews, although it seems like it's doing all right from the minimal things I've seen today.

45
00:02:18,057 --> 00:02:23,679
[SPEAKER_06]: So you did this whole unboxing, you did some playing, and hilarious stuff going down on YouTube, right?

46
00:02:24,179 --> 00:02:26,139
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, just typical YouTube commenters.

47
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:27,920
[SPEAKER_08]: Demanding...

48
00:02:29,488 --> 00:02:32,331
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to tell me how you got that or else I'm going to report you.

49
00:02:32,592 --> 00:02:33,032
[SPEAKER_08]: To who?

50
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:34,053
[SPEAKER_08]: The police?

51
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:37,958
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm playing this game before I have it.

52
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:40,301
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, whatever.

53
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:48,010
[SPEAKER_08]: I would have actually done some more actual Let's Plays and stuff, but I just...

54
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:49,791
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought you did, I thought you were up on...

55
00:03:10,152 --> 00:03:36,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Audio, I was trying to split the audio going to the TV So split it between the video capture card and my headset But when I did that, because I needed an amp on it When I did that, there was no audio coming through at all So tech issues Yeah, tech issues So I ended up just listening through my computer But the audio was lagged by a second or so So it was just a little annoying

56
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:44,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, not to tap into your gaming week too much, although I'm sure you've played plenty else besides Disney Infinity, but what did you think overall of Disney Infinity?

57
00:03:45,185 --> 00:03:48,947
[SPEAKER_08]: It's alright, because I hadn't really played Skylanders.

58
00:03:50,048 --> 00:03:53,270
[SPEAKER_08]: I checked out just the beginning.

59
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:59,634
[SPEAKER_08]: I did a couple of the tutorials, walking through some of the sandbox or the toy box stuff.

60
00:04:00,155 --> 00:04:05,238
[SPEAKER_08]: It's okay, but you don't start off with a whole lot of pieces to build with the toy box stuff.

61
00:04:06,058 --> 00:04:11,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, some of that you get through, like, these little power-up disc things that you can buy.

62
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, not a whole ton of that stuff.

63
00:04:13,781 --> 00:04:15,942
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of it's just kind of cosmetic.

64
00:04:16,262 --> 00:04:19,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you know, it looks like Alice in Wonderland or Little Nemo.

65
00:04:19,783 --> 00:04:21,003
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, it's really kind of eh.

66
00:04:21,644 --> 00:04:22,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, there's...

67
00:04:24,403 --> 00:04:40,141
[SPEAKER_08]: they have some pre-built stuff that you can look at but a lot of it you have to play through the actual they call them the play sets so like the story campaigns I guess for each of the characters so I've been playing through Pirates of the Caribbean which is alright it

68
00:04:42,136 --> 00:04:45,358
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, it's definitely a kid's game, so it's geared towards that.

69
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:47,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I was going to ask you, what did your young one think of it?

70
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you let him kind of watch?

71
00:04:49,702 --> 00:04:53,825
[SPEAKER_08]: He didn't really get to watch play, because the only time I get to play is when he's gone to bed.

72
00:04:54,265 --> 00:04:56,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and he might be a little too young, too.

73
00:04:56,467 --> 00:05:00,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Like at three, you don't really... He doesn't really understand how to use controllers and stuff yet, but he liked the figures.

74
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:05,033
[SPEAKER_08]: He took all the Cars figures and put them on this little table with his cars and stuff and was playing with them.

75
00:05:06,294 --> 00:05:07,315
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's that.

76
00:05:09,115 --> 00:05:18,898
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's kind of how I got it, too, is because I'd mentioned to my friend at Disney that my son was really into, like, he loved Mater.

77
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:24,680
[SPEAKER_08]: I was trying to get Mater figures, what I was trying to do, and they ended up just sending me everything to play with the Mater figures.

78
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,881
[SPEAKER_08]: So, the game, the Cars playset, and Mater figures.

79
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:32,563
[SPEAKER_06]: So what all, because I'm having a hard time understanding, like, what all crap are they selling with this?

80
00:05:32,603 --> 00:05:34,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Because with Skylanders, it's just the figures.

81
00:05:34,824 --> 00:05:35,764
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really the only stuff they sell.

82
00:05:35,784 --> 00:05:37,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, in the Skylanders, it's not just the figures.

83
00:05:37,665 --> 00:05:38,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Originally, it was.

84
00:05:38,745 --> 00:05:48,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because Skylanders, like, okay, so Skylanders, they have, you know, and they have a lot, a lot of it is figures, but it's so crazy now because they have, like, for Giants, they have...

85
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:50,730
[SPEAKER_08]: The regular figures.

86
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,691
[SPEAKER_08]: They have light core figures that light up when you put them on the thing.

87
00:05:53,711 --> 00:05:55,672
[SPEAKER_08]: They have giant figures.

88
00:05:55,993 --> 00:05:58,954
[SPEAKER_08]: And then with Swap Force, they're going to have Swap Force figures with that.

89
00:05:59,655 --> 00:06:01,856
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they have adventure sets.

90
00:06:02,036 --> 00:06:06,419
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they have battle sets that have figures and then crap with it.

91
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so what all is there for Disney Infinity?

92
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Because now we've entered this world where they're not even really microtransactions.

93
00:06:11,822 --> 00:06:13,303
[SPEAKER_06]: They are literally transactions.

94
00:06:13,323 --> 00:06:15,964
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going into the store and buying something tangible.

95
00:06:16,024 --> 00:06:17,585
[SPEAKER_06]: It's physical DLC is basically what it is.

96
00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:18,766
[SPEAKER_06]: But what all is there?

97
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:20,227
[SPEAKER_06]: There's character statues, right?

98
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:21,067
[SPEAKER_08]: There's characters.

99
00:06:21,127 --> 00:06:22,188
[SPEAKER_08]: There's individual characters.

100
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,448
[SPEAKER_08]: They have character three packs.

101
00:06:23,468 --> 00:06:32,053
[SPEAKER_08]: So they have a villains pack that has Davy Jones, Randy, and Syndrome from all three of the characters.

102
00:06:32,734 --> 00:06:33,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Sets that are in the game.

103
00:06:34,135 --> 00:06:41,220
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there's a Sidekicks pack that has Mike, Mrs. Incredible, and Captain Barboza.

104
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I don't even know all the packs, but you've got these characters, and then what?

105
00:06:45,143 --> 00:06:47,745
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got the hidden discs.

106
00:06:47,805 --> 00:06:51,188
[SPEAKER_08]: We have the blind packs of the power-up discs.

107
00:06:51,628 --> 00:06:52,168
[SPEAKER_08]: And what do they do?

108
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:56,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are basically just, they have add-ons, like little power-up add-ons for the characters.

109
00:06:56,652 --> 00:07:01,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Although, I got two with that, and then I bought personally four because...

110
00:07:02,636 --> 00:07:06,599
[SPEAKER_08]: and, you know, I haven't invested any money in it yet, so, you know, why not?

111
00:07:07,499 --> 00:07:10,421
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have yet to get any of the circular power-up discs.

112
00:07:10,521 --> 00:07:14,203
[SPEAKER_08]: I've gotten all just the little, I don't know, hexagonal discs that they have.

113
00:07:14,463 --> 00:07:15,124
[SPEAKER_08]: What do they do?

114
00:07:15,324 --> 00:07:16,285
[SPEAKER_08]: I have the full rare set.

115
00:07:16,305 --> 00:07:16,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, what do they do?

116
00:07:17,025 --> 00:07:31,614
[SPEAKER_08]: They unlock things in the game, so you have, like, it could be vehicles, like, you know, Mickey's Jalopy or, you know, there's Abu and stuff like that, or, like, guns or cosmetic stuff, like, you know,

117
00:07:32,174 --> 00:07:34,375
[SPEAKER_08]: different skins for your playset world.

118
00:07:34,395 --> 00:07:35,756
[SPEAKER_06]: You said you had a Wreck-It Ralph one, right?

119
00:07:35,776 --> 00:07:38,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it skins the background like Wreck-It Ralph.

120
00:07:38,857 --> 00:07:43,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so what's the difference between the characters and then there's a thing called a playset that has the two characters.

121
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Is playset like another... Yeah, the playset's basically like a single-player campaign.

122
00:07:48,842 --> 00:07:50,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's a story campaign.

123
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:53,965
[SPEAKER_08]: So they have a Cars playset and then it comes with two cars with that.

124
00:07:54,345 --> 00:08:00,028
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they've got the Lone Ranger playset that's got the two characters with that.

125
00:08:00,908 --> 00:08:00,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

126
00:08:01,008 --> 00:08:01,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

127
00:08:01,108 --> 00:08:01,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

128
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:28,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

129
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:46,850
[SPEAKER_08]: It's alright.

130
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:52,754
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, they do, like I said, they do kind of prompt you to like, you know, try to get you the purchase stuff.

131
00:08:53,135 --> 00:08:58,239
[SPEAKER_08]: But I mean, Skylanders did the exact same thing and it doesn't, I didn't run into it too much.

132
00:08:58,299 --> 00:09:09,868
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the trickiest part though because especially when it's for kids because, you know, if you have a six or seven year old that is about the right age to be doing this stuff, you know, they're going to hit these roadblocks and Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, I have to have it.

133
00:09:09,908 --> 00:09:11,309
[SPEAKER_00]: Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy.

134
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,651
[SPEAKER_00]: Daddy, Daddy, Daddy.

135
00:09:15,213 --> 00:09:16,774
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't have to give in to it.

136
00:09:17,094 --> 00:09:17,955
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's the thing.

137
00:09:18,315 --> 00:09:19,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, of course they're going to try it.

138
00:09:19,496 --> 00:09:20,817
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like TV commercials, though.

139
00:09:20,857 --> 00:09:23,759
[SPEAKER_08]: Daddy, daddy, I want whatever's on the TV.

140
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,340
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to have this.

141
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:29,183
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, there's that, but I don't think it's a huge difference.

142
00:09:29,203 --> 00:09:32,886
[SPEAKER_03]: You're ruining my life if you don't buy it.

143
00:09:32,946 --> 00:09:34,987
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to just die.

144
00:09:35,067 --> 00:09:40,111
[SPEAKER_08]: I tried both Lightning McQueen and Mater in the Cars game, and it didn't seem like they played too different.

145
00:09:40,131 --> 00:09:41,572
[SPEAKER_08]: They played pretty much exactly the same.

146
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:44,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so I don't think it's just a huge difference.

147
00:09:44,613 --> 00:09:47,074
[SPEAKER_08]: Although it was kind of funny to watch Mater, you know.

148
00:09:47,134 --> 00:09:52,257
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe the play sets, you really need the play sets, and they come with characters, but maybe you don't need to buy all these extra characters.

149
00:09:52,277 --> 00:09:53,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you probably don't need to buy all these extra characters.

150
00:09:53,877 --> 00:09:58,800
[SPEAKER_08]: And the play sets come with two characters, so it's kind of nice if you wanted to co-op, like if you have kids and stuff.

151
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:26,398
[SPEAKER_08]: you know it has two characters in there I just you know other than you know the characters that are you know in these playsets there's not a whole ton else that you might want maybe if you wanted to co-op in like the regular game you probably would want to pick up at least maybe the sidekicks pack or something so that way you have an extra set of characters you can play through each one of the playsets but I mean it's you don't have to do all that stuff and a lot of the stuff you do unlock things as you go through the game and on top of

152
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Just the toy box mode.

153
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,982
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a lot of customization within, like, the actual game.

154
00:10:31,002 --> 00:10:36,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, in the Pirates of the Caribbean, so if you can pick up the actual people and throw them into the shop, you can customize what each character looks like.

155
00:10:37,028 --> 00:10:39,911
[SPEAKER_08]: You can customize your ship and what the loadouts are and that and stuff.

156
00:10:40,191 --> 00:10:43,074
[SPEAKER_08]: But a lot of it you have to buy with in-game money.

157
00:10:43,575 --> 00:10:46,798
[SPEAKER_08]: So, like, I had, like, to upgrade my Kansas, I had to, you know, earn money.

158
00:10:46,818 --> 00:10:49,000
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a lot of grind to get that.

159
00:10:49,261 --> 00:10:49,361
[SPEAKER_08]: But...

160
00:10:49,781 --> 00:10:50,922
[SPEAKER_08]: The ship combat's kind of cool.

161
00:10:50,962 --> 00:10:53,024
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't have a store you could just go into and spend 99 cents?

162
00:10:53,084 --> 00:10:54,905
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they don't have anything like that.

163
00:10:54,925 --> 00:10:55,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Not yet.

164
00:10:55,286 --> 00:10:56,787
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as I saw, so, yeah.

165
00:10:56,887 --> 00:10:58,088
[SPEAKER_08]: Daddy, daddy, daddy, buy me!

166
00:10:58,248 --> 00:10:58,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Buy me!

167
00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:08,356
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think they're going to do anything like that because I think that could be a big problem if, you know, all of a sudden kids racked up, you know, hundreds of dollars in online transactions.

168
00:11:09,397 --> 00:11:11,239
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's go to our chat room.

169
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:13,741
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't mean to neglect you folks, but you got a lot of good questions.

170
00:11:13,801 --> 00:11:15,242
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to let Loki get his thoughts out.

171
00:11:15,643 --> 00:11:16,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

172
00:11:17,064 --> 00:11:18,325
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I wanted to have a coughing fit.

173
00:11:18,385 --> 00:11:18,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

174
00:11:19,465 --> 00:11:28,712
[SPEAKER_06]: We do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern on Sundays, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

175
00:11:29,693 --> 00:11:32,575
[SPEAKER_06]: And we do have our chatters there at live.vognetwork.com.

176
00:11:33,076 --> 00:11:35,137
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's see some of the questions here.

177
00:11:35,377 --> 00:11:41,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Tiger Claw says, Do you guys think Disney Infinity could be huge this coming holiday season, given how successful Skylanders was?

178
00:11:41,682 --> 00:11:43,464
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be bigger because of the Disney's name.

179
00:11:44,744 --> 00:12:03,517
[SPEAKER_06]: well I think that's the idea and I think a lot of like if this game flops which I kind of don't think it will but if this game flops like Disney Interactive will close I think that's kind of what's riding on this for real because they've invested a lot into this I don't see how it could fail right now

180
00:12:04,204 --> 00:12:05,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

181
00:12:23,147 --> 00:12:46,566
[SPEAKER_08]: so there's that going forward and really like the new Skylanders game is just kind of a very linear action game and so I just don't know don't think there's a whole lot of incentive to buy stuff for that E3VL wants to know what your YouTube channel is where you had the unboxing where he can leave nasty comment no I made that part up but where can you leave it's just LokiOLR it's all one word yeah just all one word

182
00:12:47,406 --> 00:12:54,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, Dartetsuya at live.vognetwork.com asks, you think the figures and discs and so forth will get to be like the pins at the Magic Kingdom?

183
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,271
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's what Disney wants.

184
00:12:56,971 --> 00:13:00,873
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely, and they have rares in each one of the sets.

185
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:04,355
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got a full set and then some of the rares so far.

186
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:07,817
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sure some of the Disney souvenir shops are already selling this.

187
00:13:08,077 --> 00:13:09,838
[SPEAKER_08]: And they have exclusive rares.

188
00:13:09,858 --> 00:13:13,600
[SPEAKER_08]: For example, they have Mike's car that's exclusive to Toys R Us right now.

189
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,000
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

190
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,060
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

191
00:13:40,643 --> 00:13:43,265
[SPEAKER_15]: No, that would assume that I would have gotten you the Disney Infinity Star instead.

192
00:13:43,285 --> 00:13:43,965
[SPEAKER_06]: We're playing make-leave.

193
00:13:43,985 --> 00:13:44,686
[SPEAKER_06]: We're playing make-leave.

194
00:13:44,706 --> 00:13:44,886
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

195
00:13:44,906 --> 00:13:46,627
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, but if I was being a parent, I wouldn't do it.

196
00:13:46,707 --> 00:13:46,947
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

197
00:13:47,147 --> 00:13:48,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'm poor.

198
00:13:48,849 --> 00:13:52,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, then Uncle Loki was spoiling and bought it for me.

199
00:13:52,491 --> 00:13:53,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so now I have it.

200
00:13:53,352 --> 00:13:54,192
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so here we go.

201
00:13:54,532 --> 00:13:55,753
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Uncle Loki.

202
00:13:55,773 --> 00:13:56,974
[SPEAKER_13]: You're welcome.

203
00:13:57,074 --> 00:13:57,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Mommy!

204
00:13:58,395 --> 00:14:00,336
[SPEAKER_07]: Mommy, you have to buy me!

205
00:14:00,797 --> 00:14:02,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Mommy, you have to buy me the cars!

206
00:14:03,318 --> 00:14:03,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Mommy!

207
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:05,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!

208
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,220
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to buy it!

209
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,201
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

210
00:14:08,962 --> 00:14:09,923
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't have to buy you shit.

211
00:14:09,963 --> 00:14:10,383
[SPEAKER_13]: Go to your room.

212
00:14:12,244 --> 00:14:13,285
[SPEAKER_13]: You little ingrate!

213
00:14:13,545 --> 00:14:14,265
[SPEAKER_13]: Time out!

214
00:14:15,867 --> 00:14:19,129
[SPEAKER_13]: Ten minutes in your room on time out and you're not allowed to play with any toys.

215
00:14:19,349 --> 00:14:21,370
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to stare at the wall.

216
00:14:21,991 --> 00:14:24,332
[SPEAKER_13]: And then come back and tell me what you did wrong.

217
00:14:25,933 --> 00:14:26,954
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, I know.

218
00:14:28,555 --> 00:14:29,996
[SPEAKER_15]: Or you could go to the backyard and pick a switch.

219
00:14:31,894 --> 00:14:59,322
[SPEAKER_06]: that's what happened to me when I was a kid alright let's see I love you guys chat it's live.vognetwork.com let's see other comments here back on a serious note Black Wolf wants to know how much story is included in the base game without buying anything else you have the full thing for Pirates of the Caribbean The Incredibles and Monsters U so you have three play sets basically

220
00:14:59,597 --> 00:15:01,798
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like three little mini-adventures you get to play through.

221
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:02,538
[SPEAKER_08]: They're pretty long.

222
00:15:02,578 --> 00:15:06,779
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I've already played through about a few hours of Pirates of the Caribbean.

223
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:12,281
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not very far into it, so there's a lot there, a lot of content, I think.

224
00:15:13,661 --> 00:15:17,183
[SPEAKER_06]: TigerClaw wants to know, does the game actually end if you don't have all the figures?

225
00:15:17,243 --> 00:15:19,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you just play the core game and finish it?

226
00:15:19,163 --> 00:15:21,344
[SPEAKER_06]: So you get the three little adventures, basically.

227
00:15:21,804 --> 00:15:23,446
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

228
00:15:40,487 --> 00:15:41,147
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

229
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob's Annoying Kid Impression is Awesome

230
00:16:21,846 --> 00:16:23,427
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

231
00:16:49,727 --> 00:16:51,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy XIV Final Fantasy XIV

232
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:25,342
[SPEAKER_06]: and we're going to talk about this by just you know straight up the first version never happened bad figment of the imagination not going to go talk about version 1 anymore because this is now the real Final Fantasy 14 it always seemed like the intro was like we blew up that world lol yeah well he said he was inspired by World of Warcraft Cataclysm the producer so

233
00:17:26,343 --> 00:17:26,823
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

234
00:17:41,482 --> 00:17:42,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Ragnarok Online Back in the Beta

235
00:18:04,056 --> 00:18:07,398
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, seriously, when I was in the beta of that game for seven years.

236
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:10,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you haven't had a console game come around lately that sucked you in like that?

237
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,224
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, when I had hand surgery, I was high on Vicodin and played Blue Dragon and almost finished the game.

238
00:18:16,992 --> 00:18:18,133
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

239
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:41,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Which actually, that happened to me once, but it resolved itself within 10 minutes.

240
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,482
[SPEAKER_06]: So I didn't really have the serious issue.

241
00:18:43,142 --> 00:18:51,865
[SPEAKER_06]: And besides full servers once in a while, which seems to also go away after 15-20 minutes, I'm not hearing of a lot of issues that my friends are having.

242
00:18:52,245 --> 00:18:56,746
[SPEAKER_06]: When I go over to Reddit or forums, I see you would think the entire world's having problems.

243
00:18:57,246 --> 00:18:58,087
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't know.

244
00:18:58,127 --> 00:19:01,948
[SPEAKER_06]: It sucks that people are getting locked out of this beta, but...

245
00:19:02,168 --> 00:19:04,209
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, there was the world full thing today.

246
00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:11,693
[SPEAKER_15]: And I actually went and made a character on the European server, on Shiva, just so I could see what the server lists looked like.

247
00:19:12,134 --> 00:19:14,555
[SPEAKER_15]: And there were maybe four servers that weren't blacked out.

248
00:19:15,188 --> 00:19:16,429
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

249
00:19:41,264 --> 00:20:10,130
[SPEAKER_06]: so Midgarcimer is what we picked well finally it took a good 24 hours but Midgarcimer filled up too now and they had to actually open new worlds and unfortunately people can only roll on the new worlds they can't go to the worlds so I kind of think that part is a bit of a mess that Square is going to have to figure out a solution because why would you fucking play an MMO if you can't play it with your friends it gets really boring that way I mean we'll go make new friends moron why did I stop playing WoW

250
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.

251
00:20:11,431 --> 00:20:12,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Why am I playing less and less WoW?

252
00:20:12,871 --> 00:20:14,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, more and more people I know left.

253
00:20:15,072 --> 00:20:25,338
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, if we were, and I was actually saying something to that, I prefer playing Alliance to Horde, and unfortunately our Alliance guild just sort of dried up, except for Grandpa.

254
00:20:25,618 --> 00:20:29,060
[SPEAKER_06]: but you can't blame people for not having fun anymore and not enjoying the game.

255
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,722
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they left because for whatever reason they were having fun.

256
00:20:31,742 --> 00:20:36,385
[SPEAKER_15]: I said I don't blame anybody but that's why I left because I had no one to play with that and Pandas was kind of stupid.

257
00:20:37,686 --> 00:20:40,308
[SPEAKER_15]: Pandas as in the expansion was I hate the grind.

258
00:20:40,328 --> 00:20:41,269
[SPEAKER_15]: I hate the grind.

259
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, every expansion has its own noun.

260
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,732
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, so Final Fantasy XIV is going on.

261
00:20:47,952 --> 00:20:55,195
[SPEAKER_06]: And despite those things, I hope they are able to institute... I think the World Pass thing that they had in Final Fantasy XI actually worked out really well.

262
00:20:55,636 --> 00:20:59,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Where, like, if you're friends on the server, they buy you a pass that you can use to get on.

263
00:20:59,698 --> 00:21:03,099
[SPEAKER_06]: And it costs them a lot of gil, depending on how many people are already on the server.

264
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:03,800
[SPEAKER_06]: You bought me mine.

265
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but people will do it.

266
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,061
[SPEAKER_06]: People will do it.

267
00:21:06,741 --> 00:21:11,904
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, otherwise, I mean, the good news is I'm just God, the game is gorgeous.

268
00:21:12,825 --> 00:21:14,666
[SPEAKER_06]: I love running instances with friends.

269
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:19,889
[SPEAKER_06]: There was myself, Shane, Captain Spike from Game Buoy and Tim Tripp.

270
00:21:19,969 --> 00:21:20,630
[SPEAKER_06]: We're all running it.

271
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:25,092
[SPEAKER_06]: We just we have the perfect layout of classes that the four of us can make a light party.

272
00:21:25,393 --> 00:21:28,014
[SPEAKER_06]: And we did the beginner instances just back to back last night.

273
00:21:28,114 --> 00:21:32,117
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're they're so fucking gorgeous and having fun with it.

274
00:21:32,717 --> 00:21:33,338
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.com.

275
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,401
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, you actually pretty much learn how to do that when you're soloing your duties.

276
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:59,791
[SPEAKER_06]: And for folks that liked Warcraft back in the very beginning when it was minimal abilities too, I think they might find something kind of fun in Final Fantasy XIV.

277
00:22:00,191 --> 00:22:00,792
[SPEAKER_06]: But I love it.

278
00:22:00,932 --> 00:22:07,698
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm definitely buying the game when it comes out and I will sub for at least a few months while I figure out, you know, am I going to cancel WoW to play this?

279
00:22:07,738 --> 00:22:08,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I going to

280
00:22:08,539 --> 00:22:36,332
[SPEAKER_06]: stick with this I'm really curious to see what the end game is like because I know a lot about Final Fantasy 14 from level 0 to 20 because I've actually been in since the alpha so I've done that grind like 5 times 0 to 20 and so I know a lot about it but I don't know much about what the game is past that and that kind of concerns me but it could I mean it's only a concern that doesn't mean it's gonna be negative I just don't know and if the end game isn't exciting enough it's not gonna really keep me there once I get to 50

281
00:22:36,912 --> 00:23:06,123
[SPEAKER_15]: I will tell you one thing though is that I mean and you were online for a little bit of this when I went exploring in the level 30 area it actually had a lot of really neat stuff there were some neat characters I've found Costa del Sol which you can't get to right now except by walking because it's the fairies are disabled and Limsa Lominsa yeah Limsa Lominsa that's hard to say just say Limsa but which by the way is my favorite town so far

282
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:09,053
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the leader of that town, the female Rogadin.

283
00:23:09,453 --> 00:23:11,455
[SPEAKER_06]: She's great, and her voice acting I like the best.

284
00:23:11,915 --> 00:23:14,317
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm super enjoying Arcanist.

285
00:23:15,017 --> 00:23:16,699
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, just because my carbuncle is so cute.

286
00:23:16,719 --> 00:23:17,519
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a great class.

287
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,363
[SPEAKER_15]: And I haven't had nearly the same problems I did with Thaumaturge.

288
00:23:22,623 --> 00:23:26,586
[SPEAKER_15]: Because Thaumaturge, well, I mean, they've also fixed the duties, but still.

289
00:23:27,847 --> 00:23:32,791
[SPEAKER_15]: But I had to say that just what I saw, there were some pretty encouraging things for stories.

290
00:23:32,891 --> 00:23:36,455
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we're going to get more raid-like content and stuff like that.

291
00:23:36,535 --> 00:23:39,117
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds like they're really going to be developing it and so forth.

292
00:23:39,157 --> 00:23:49,366
[SPEAKER_06]: But if they fuck up some of these basics, like getting people who want to play together able to play together and in the same guild, if they fuck up these basics, it isn't going to matter how much they invest in the game in the end.

293
00:23:49,767 --> 00:23:50,627
[SPEAKER_06]: So I really hope...

294
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:52,129
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

295
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:17,487
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm at 14 right now, and I figured that when I hit like 18, I was going to start trying weaving or something, you know, whenever.

296
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:26,316
[SPEAKER_15]: But I've already decided that I'm probably going to be selling off some of my services so that I can afford to buy the game, because it really is...

297
00:24:28,411 --> 00:24:29,332
[SPEAKER_15]: I was excited.

298
00:24:29,532 --> 00:24:30,332
[SPEAKER_15]: I really enjoyed it.

299
00:24:30,393 --> 00:24:35,315
[SPEAKER_15]: It has some of the elements I liked about Cataclysm that made me finally think WoW was fun.

300
00:24:35,535 --> 00:24:39,137
[SPEAKER_15]: Because you remember how many times I started WoW and then just said, oh, boring, oh, boring, oh, boring.

301
00:24:39,577 --> 00:24:41,298
[SPEAKER_15]: It had a lot of the fun.

302
00:24:41,378 --> 00:24:43,760
[SPEAKER_15]: It had characters that made me, I laughed at my desk.

303
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:47,001
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, especially with the Moogles drinking all the wine.

304
00:24:47,682 --> 00:24:48,322
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you see that bit?

305
00:24:48,402 --> 00:24:49,142
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, yes, I did.

306
00:24:49,162 --> 00:24:49,703
[SPEAKER_15]: It's so cute.

307
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:53,625
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I rolled a Lalafell this morning.

308
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,586
[SPEAKER_15]: A really cute little teeny lalafell

309
00:25:24,308 --> 00:25:47,587
[SPEAKER_15]: Ha ha ha ha Maybe it was mining, I don't know But anyway, it was just funny The names of the quests have been funny I've really had a lot of fun The other big thing for me is that I have really been enjoying having my friends on People to chat with You know what?

310
00:25:48,187 --> 00:25:50,749
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd give you a hug for free, Jim Sally But you have to come out here and get it

311
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:55,172
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm doing logos for people.

312
00:25:55,372 --> 00:26:00,475
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm working on a logo for a couple of people right now and making fabric art.

313
00:26:01,936 --> 00:26:02,176
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

314
00:26:02,957 --> 00:26:03,137
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

315
00:26:03,537 --> 00:26:04,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, good luck with all of that.

316
00:26:04,878 --> 00:26:05,798
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

317
00:26:28,369 --> 00:26:29,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Check back in like 30 minutes.

318
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:30,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Check back in an hour.

319
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:33,112
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sure this will be the case in early access as well.

320
00:26:33,512 --> 00:26:34,333
[SPEAKER_06]: It does open up.

321
00:26:34,453 --> 00:26:37,235
[SPEAKER_06]: And Midgarcimer is not supposed to be one of the super populated servers.

322
00:26:37,515 --> 00:26:38,876
[SPEAKER_06]: So you will be able to get in eventually.

323
00:26:38,937 --> 00:26:41,098
[SPEAKER_06]: It just might be frustrating that you can't get in right away.

324
00:26:41,438 --> 00:26:45,742
[SPEAKER_06]: But all of us that were super eager about this game, we all got in.

325
00:26:45,882 --> 00:26:48,344
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's going to be too tough to move everybody at this point.

326
00:26:48,424 --> 00:26:50,025
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to stick it out on Midgarcimer.

327
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:51,746
[SPEAKER_06]: VOG Network

328
00:27:11,841 --> 00:27:16,587
[SPEAKER_06]: So it'll be something like Vanquishers of Garland or something.

329
00:27:16,607 --> 00:27:17,969
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we want something that'll be VOG.

330
00:27:17,989 --> 00:27:18,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Gilgamesh.

331
00:27:18,229 --> 00:27:19,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, something like that.

332
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:20,732
[SPEAKER_15]: That's very Final Fantasy-like.

333
00:27:20,752 --> 00:27:29,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we're gonna... So if you have some good ideas, throw them out there, especially Shane, because he'll be the one that puts it all together, I'm sure, because he's gonna... Verp of gastritis.

334
00:27:30,684 --> 00:27:33,086
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, we're looking at something where the abbreviation will be VOG.

335
00:27:33,406 --> 00:27:35,107
[SPEAKER_06]: So just to kind of tie it together, be fun.

336
00:27:35,768 --> 00:27:36,909
[SPEAKER_06]: So, all right.

337
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:38,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

338
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:46,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Codeman says in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, like I asked before, if you roll on that server when live, will you still be on that server?

339
00:27:46,835 --> 00:27:52,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, the characters are not supposed to delete between open beta and live at this point.

340
00:27:52,499 --> 00:27:56,102
[SPEAKER_06]: If there is a huge game breaking bug, they may still erase them.

341
00:27:56,642 --> 00:27:59,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, I don't know.

342
00:27:59,625 --> 00:28:03,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Because of all these issues people are having, maybe that'll be justification for them to erase them.

343
00:28:03,209 --> 00:28:03,770
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope not.

344
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:11,098
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is why everybody was very much about like they wanted to get on the server they want to get on because this is your real character now that you're going to have in the main game.

345
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:11,899
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see.

346
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:12,620
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

347
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,641
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, Bobby said very old gamers.

348
00:28:17,942 --> 00:28:19,403
[SPEAKER_06]: That would mostly be accurate.

349
00:28:19,443 --> 00:28:19,783
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

350
00:28:20,703 --> 00:28:21,003
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

351
00:28:21,824 --> 00:28:24,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Technus in chat says, if you can't think of a name, find a Latin phrase.

352
00:28:24,785 --> 00:28:27,686
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you don't know how many Warcraft guilds that worked for.

353
00:28:29,987 --> 00:28:51,223
[SPEAKER_06]: and Final Fantasy XI to be fair alright Geeklet in our chatroom says they might have to wipe the server to fix that dumb error that is a distinct possibility so we all have to kind of be prepared for that that's why I kind of I leveled my and we'll wrap up this discussion guys I know we're going to get to the other games I leveled one of my jobs to like 18 and another one to 13 and then did some crafting stuff

354
00:28:51,963 --> 00:29:00,829
[SPEAKER_06]: and so if they wipe them all I would be kind of mad but at the end of the day that's the reason why I stopped playing too and I'm not going to play anymore.

355
00:29:00,949 --> 00:29:05,272
[SPEAKER_06]: I logged out and I'm getting my rest bar because if they do wipe it then fine.

356
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,633
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll deal with it.

357
00:29:06,673 --> 00:29:08,334
[SPEAKER_15]: That's kind of my logic too.

358
00:29:09,295 --> 00:29:20,942
[SPEAKER_15]: The other thing too is that I'm probably going to stick with just caster classes for a while because and I love this so much over some of the stuff they did in 11 is that your gear will carry over

359
00:29:22,283 --> 00:29:22,664
[SPEAKER_15]: It's nice.

360
00:29:23,144 --> 00:29:31,692
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, and I can keep using my leather gear as a gladiator or whatever if I wanted to, so I wouldn't have to, because I sold all my old gear.

361
00:29:31,792 --> 00:29:32,973
[SPEAKER_15]: Whoops.

362
00:29:33,994 --> 00:29:36,797
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, anyhow, let's talk about officially our gaming week.

363
00:29:36,837 --> 00:29:40,620
[SPEAKER_06]: So besides Disney Infinity, besides Final Fantasy XIV, what kind of games have you been playing this week?

364
00:29:40,761 --> 00:29:41,681
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there anything else, Rob?

365
00:29:42,983 --> 00:29:45,685
[SPEAKER_15]: No, and clearly I'm playing Animal Crossing right now.

366
00:29:45,745 --> 00:29:46,626
[SPEAKER_15]: My village is open.

367
00:29:47,887 --> 00:29:50,908
[SPEAKER_06]: What if people want to add you, be your friend on 3DS so they can visit during the show?

368
00:29:50,988 --> 00:29:51,508
[SPEAKER_06]: How do they do that?

369
00:29:51,528 --> 00:29:51,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, crap.

370
00:29:52,408 --> 00:29:53,668
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I'd have to add them back.

371
00:29:53,809 --> 00:30:02,271
[SPEAKER_15]: So I might close and then reopen in Part B so I can put out my friend code because I don't memorize it.

372
00:30:02,391 --> 00:30:04,531
[SPEAKER_06]: So be here live, live.vognetwork.com Sunday nights.

373
00:30:04,551 --> 00:30:05,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's how you get it.

374
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:06,032
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to be here live.

375
00:30:06,092 --> 00:30:07,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's how you're going to get it.

376
00:30:08,934 --> 00:30:11,558
[SPEAKER_15]: Unless one of you guys, like, I know Actdeft has it.

377
00:30:11,798 --> 00:30:16,264
[SPEAKER_06]: See, I would point you to the friend code thread at vognetwork.com, but I know Jamie doesn't check it.

378
00:30:16,725 --> 00:30:17,366
[SPEAKER_15]: I posted it.

379
00:30:17,586 --> 00:30:17,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, did you?

380
00:30:17,967 --> 00:30:19,389
[SPEAKER_06]: I posted there.

381
00:30:19,489 --> 00:30:21,772
[SPEAKER_15]: So, Rob, thank you for your assumptions.

382
00:30:21,812 --> 00:30:22,293
[SPEAKER_15]: Jeez.

383
00:30:23,694 --> 00:30:24,275
[SPEAKER_06]: I swear.

384
00:30:24,575 --> 00:30:25,696
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm never happier to be wrong.

385
00:30:25,736 --> 00:30:26,576
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm so insulted.

386
00:30:27,317 --> 00:30:27,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Really.

387
00:30:27,557 --> 00:30:28,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, get over it.

388
00:30:28,317 --> 00:30:28,858
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

389
00:30:29,138 --> 00:30:29,418
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

390
00:30:30,178 --> 00:30:41,465
[SPEAKER_15]: I played some Mass Effect 3 because I am still working on trying to get a custom texture, not texture, a custom mesh to work, but unfortunately it's not using any of the default textures in it.

391
00:30:41,866 --> 00:30:45,048
[SPEAKER_15]: And I hate using text mod with Mass Effect 3, so I'm just sort of like, bleh.

392
00:30:46,128 --> 00:30:51,113
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I am also, I've, what did I play?

393
00:30:51,173 --> 00:30:52,233
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah, I played more Fractal.

394
00:30:52,274 --> 00:30:53,154
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm back to playing Fractal.

395
00:30:53,595 --> 00:30:57,298
[SPEAKER_15]: Because that is my game that I play when my brain is too busy.

396
00:30:58,098 --> 00:31:04,444
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, if I have all these thoughts that I just want to get out of my head, I completely blank out and play Fractal.

397
00:31:04,644 --> 00:31:05,445
[SPEAKER_15]: It's such a good game.

398
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:33,289
[SPEAKER_15]: I've also um I got Dan DuckTales and I got myself a copy I haven't touched it yet but basically I've been watching Dan play through the whole thing and humming along with the music because it's so good and he found a 8-bit music mode so he was super happy and playing through it with that um I played some other stuff what did I play oh yeah this well I went to Scandia this morning um because we went to breakfast and then played um mini golf which um

399
00:31:34,009 --> 00:31:40,093
[SPEAKER_15]: It's 102 today, and it was already like 90-something at 11 this morning, so I was like, I'm not having any more of that.

400
00:31:40,113 --> 00:31:40,894
[SPEAKER_15]: I've got a sunburn.

401
00:31:41,574 --> 00:31:45,017
[SPEAKER_15]: But I went inside, and poor Scandia.

402
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:57,205
[SPEAKER_15]: I met a person who works there named Danny, who apparently owns 2DX machines, several of them, and a Pump It Up, and a DDR, and a Poppin' Music, and has the actual arcade cabinets.

403
00:31:57,225 --> 00:31:58,106
[SPEAKER_15]: He showed me photos of them.

404
00:31:58,806 --> 00:32:00,610
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, I'm gonna be friends with you.

405
00:32:00,791 --> 00:32:01,612
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, it was really cool.

406
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:04,900
[SPEAKER_15]: And he was fixing one of the machines that I lost some tokens to.

407
00:32:05,643 --> 00:32:06,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Sean again, it's Sean again, that's what it was

408
00:32:32,014 --> 00:32:34,096
[SPEAKER_15]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

409
00:32:53,052 --> 00:32:54,253
[SPEAKER_15]: Dan played Crazy Taxi Crazy Money

410
00:33:17,873 --> 00:33:19,113
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's make some crazy money!

411
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:37,940
[SPEAKER_15]: I was a little dismayed.

412
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,540
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I shouldn't have been surprised.

413
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,941
[SPEAKER_15]: They have no more pinball.

414
00:33:42,681 --> 00:33:47,463
[SPEAKER_15]: All the ticket games, of course, were in perfect condition, but the Tekken 5 had no monitor in it.

415
00:33:47,983 --> 00:33:50,884
[SPEAKER_15]: There was another game that had no monitor in it.

416
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:56,625
[SPEAKER_15]: The X-Men vs. Street Fighter had such bad burn-in.

417
00:33:57,105 --> 00:33:58,326
[SPEAKER_15]: The monitor was green.

418
00:33:58,406 --> 00:33:59,806
[SPEAKER_15]: It was really in bad shape.

419
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:05,088
[SPEAKER_15]: I played some Silent Scope, a little dark silhouette, because that one is really the best of them.

420
00:34:08,411 --> 00:34:11,915
[SPEAKER_15]: I really did play a lot of stuff this week, relatively.

421
00:34:13,456 --> 00:34:17,721
[SPEAKER_15]: You've loaned me Kid Icarus Uprising, which I started and then had to put down because the cat threw up.

422
00:34:19,543 --> 00:34:20,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Midna has been the queen.

423
00:34:20,904 --> 00:34:22,286
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a crappy reason to stop playing a game.

424
00:34:22,386 --> 00:34:23,347
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it's a barfy reason.

425
00:34:24,809 --> 00:34:25,890
[SPEAKER_15]: She threw up on Dan's chair.

426
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:26,590
[SPEAKER_15]: I was so mad.

427
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:27,772
[SPEAKER_15]: I was such a brat.

428
00:34:28,292 --> 00:34:35,780
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, so yeah, uh, and I was gonna start, um, Birth By Sleep, but I borrowed it from a friend, and I was like, I'm already playing too much, I just gave it back to her.

429
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:40,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, is there anything else you actually played, or is this all thought about playing?

430
00:34:40,105 --> 00:34:49,115
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, no, it's, I started stuff, and I, oh, and Final Fantasy 7, but I just cannot play it with keyboards, so, fuck it, I'm gonna find the controller somewhere.

431
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:50,451
[SPEAKER_06]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

432
00:35:02,497 --> 00:35:07,319
[SPEAKER_08]: It didn't play a whole ton of stuff other than Disney Infinity and Saints Row 4.

433
00:35:07,419 --> 00:35:12,441
[SPEAKER_08]: So I played a lot of Saints Row 4 the last couple days here and it's fun.

434
00:35:14,882 --> 00:35:18,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely a lot different than Saints Row 3 with the whole superpower thing.

435
00:35:20,164 --> 00:35:21,425
[SPEAKER_08]: At the same time, some of the...

436
00:35:22,305 --> 00:35:23,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

437
00:35:41,065 --> 00:35:46,730
[SPEAKER_08]: So, that's kind of the only annoying thing is that there's not really a point to the cars at all.

438
00:35:47,852 --> 00:36:01,744
[SPEAKER_08]: There was one little, I don't know if it's a glitch, but a design flaw, if I were to call it, where when you're buying stuff at a store, if people happen to be attacking you, it will kick you out of the menu that you're in.

439
00:36:01,904 --> 00:36:03,546
[SPEAKER_08]: So, like, I was in Friendly Fire once.

440
00:36:04,147 --> 00:36:05,208
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

441
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,170
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

442
00:36:39,111 --> 00:36:41,952
[SPEAKER_08]: So, it's kind of dumb that they had that.

443
00:36:42,032 --> 00:36:46,574
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand that, yeah, you can't hide in stores anymore to drop your notoriety.

444
00:36:47,974 --> 00:36:56,977
[SPEAKER_08]: But, at the very least, they should pause the game when you're in a menu because it's kind of dumb that you can't browse the menu while you're in the middle of a fight.

445
00:36:56,997 --> 00:37:01,379
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I don't see why they should do that.

446
00:37:02,299 --> 00:37:03,780
[SPEAKER_08]: But whatever, that's their choice.

447
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,180
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a little annoying.

448
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:08,541
[SPEAKER_08]: I did find a couple hidden weapons in the game.

449
00:37:09,141 --> 00:37:14,783
[SPEAKER_08]: They have the penetrator, the giant dildo bat hidden in the game.

450
00:37:15,463 --> 00:37:16,584
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh no, it's back.

451
00:37:16,784 --> 00:37:17,664
[SPEAKER_08]: It's back, yes.

452
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:26,447
[SPEAKER_08]: They also have a tentacle bat and they also have an anal probe that has a tongue on it.

453
00:37:27,952 --> 00:37:28,533
[SPEAKER_15]: That's awesome.

454
00:37:29,734 --> 00:37:30,034
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

455
00:37:30,735 --> 00:37:31,977
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes licking motions.

456
00:37:32,037 --> 00:37:34,219
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's kind of funny.

457
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:35,961
[SPEAKER_08]: So they've got that.

458
00:37:36,882 --> 00:37:37,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Y'all need Jesus.

459
00:37:38,424 --> 00:37:42,548
[SPEAKER_08]: And then some of the weapon skins they have in there are kind of dumb.

460
00:37:42,788 --> 00:37:44,971
[SPEAKER_08]: So I didn't really mess with a whole ton of that stuff.

461
00:37:46,252 --> 00:37:48,134
[SPEAKER_08]: But I have a lot of the upgrades are kind of cool.

462
00:37:48,815 --> 00:37:54,120
[SPEAKER_08]: I just... It felt like I... I don't really like the whole having to pick health pickups.

463
00:37:55,041 --> 00:38:01,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Having to gather health pickups instead of having just a regenerating health, which has been in the game forever.

464
00:38:01,887 --> 00:38:03,248
[SPEAKER_08]: But they decided to switch it up.

465
00:38:03,569 --> 00:38:05,350
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a huge deal, but it's kind of annoying.

466
00:38:06,111 --> 00:38:06,231
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

467
00:38:07,412 --> 00:38:08,193
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to think of what else.

468
00:38:08,233 --> 00:38:09,253
[SPEAKER_08]: So far, the story's kind of fun.

469
00:38:09,414 --> 00:38:13,817
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't really played a whole bunch of the story missions yet, but it's funny.

470
00:38:13,857 --> 00:38:16,078
[SPEAKER_08]: There was moments that I was laughing out loud.

471
00:38:17,319 --> 00:38:27,647
[SPEAKER_08]: I love the new... You know how the third had these wrestling moves you could do if you hold down sprint and hit one of the attack buttons?

472
00:38:28,067 --> 00:38:36,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, now they have super-powered attacks, and they're just goddamn ridiculous, like throwing people up there and just stomping on their skull and

473
00:38:36,573 --> 00:38:38,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Just ridiculous stuff in the game.

474
00:38:38,394 --> 00:38:39,916
[SPEAKER_08]: So I kind of dig that.

475
00:38:41,537 --> 00:38:42,317
[SPEAKER_08]: And then what else?

476
00:38:42,338 --> 00:38:44,159
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've been playing on an Xbox 360.

477
00:38:44,259 --> 00:38:49,763
[SPEAKER_08]: I just preloaded my Steam copy, so I'm looking forward to that.

478
00:38:50,144 --> 00:38:52,645
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll be playing this for a while until Grand Theft Auto V comes out.

479
00:38:53,126 --> 00:38:54,287
[SPEAKER_08]: And then all bets are off.

480
00:38:54,307 --> 00:38:56,649
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just going to be Grand Theft Auto until I die.

481
00:38:56,689 --> 00:38:59,471
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll talk about Grand Theft Auto V and your excitement a little later in the show.

482
00:38:59,591 --> 00:39:01,112
[SPEAKER_06]: But anything else for your gaming weakness?

483
00:39:01,212 --> 00:39:03,334
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

484
00:39:24,332 --> 00:39:25,293
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

485
00:39:53,667 --> 00:39:55,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you notice that they did change a few things around?

486
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:09,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh god, yes.

487
00:40:10,151 --> 00:40:21,697
[SPEAKER_06]: There's that new level in the beginning, and then they totally changed the end, where in the NES game you used to go back to Transylvania, and that's where you would fight the last boss, but in this one they made a whole new level.

488
00:40:22,057 --> 00:40:25,099
[SPEAKER_06]: They made the, you know, spoiler, sorry, but, you know, come on.

489
00:40:25,959 --> 00:40:31,281
[SPEAKER_06]: They made a new level, Mount Vesuvius, that you play instead, which is kind of like Inside a Volcano.

490
00:40:31,321 --> 00:40:35,663
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's very different and much harder in difficulty than the base levels.

491
00:40:36,303 --> 00:40:42,606
[SPEAKER_06]: And more spoiler alert, after the final boss, there's a Metroid-esque escape element.

492
00:40:44,547 --> 00:40:47,988
[SPEAKER_06]: That was definitely controller-throwing frustration.

493
00:40:48,568 --> 00:40:51,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Luckily, I own a Wii U, so I wasn't about to throw that controller.

494
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:53,270
[SPEAKER_06]: But thought about it.

495
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:55,672
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

496
00:41:12,188 --> 00:41:13,569
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

497
00:41:34,449 --> 00:41:45,253
[SPEAKER_06]: and although after you play through the whole thing once, you can skip cutscenes later on, it's still really annoying that you're going through the game and then, oh, stop, cutscene, oh, stop, cutscene.

498
00:41:46,114 --> 00:41:50,635
[SPEAKER_06]: And I get that, you know, like if you have kids or whatever, like they're gonna eat it up, they're gonna love it.

499
00:41:50,775 --> 00:41:54,457
[SPEAKER_06]: If you love the old 90s show, it's great, you're gonna love it.

500
00:41:55,277 --> 00:42:24,259
[SPEAKER_06]: but I don't know like I kind of got over it pretty quick and I just wanted to play the game and that experience kept getting interrupted every five seconds and that was one thing I loved about the original game is it was it was this game you could really speed run and you know beat the whole thing in not even an hour maybe if you're good you know so I don't know I did not like that whole stop and go element and here's what really pissed me off the quality of the audio is atrocious

501
00:42:25,194 --> 00:42:25,575
[SPEAKER_14]: Was it?

502
00:42:25,855 --> 00:42:27,378
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounded... Not the music.

503
00:42:27,458 --> 00:42:28,179
[SPEAKER_06]: The music's great.

504
00:42:28,499 --> 00:42:30,142
[SPEAKER_06]: The voice acting audio quality?

505
00:42:30,623 --> 00:42:31,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Horrible.

506
00:42:31,464 --> 00:42:33,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Scrooge sounds like he's coming through an iPhone.

507
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:36,622
[SPEAKER_15]: It sounded really clear on the PC.

508
00:42:36,682 --> 00:42:38,844
[SPEAKER_06]: It might be a Wii U thing.

509
00:42:39,024 --> 00:42:42,827
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be, but I heard the same thing from somebody who played it on 360.

510
00:42:42,867 --> 00:42:45,309
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it's a console thing then.

511
00:42:45,649 --> 00:42:46,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it is a console thing.

512
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:47,231
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

513
00:42:47,291 --> 00:42:50,233
[SPEAKER_06]: But the quality of the sound itself was really bad.

514
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:58,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially the worst is when you're going through and he gets hit or whatever and you go, Oh, ouch!

515
00:42:58,159 --> 00:42:58,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Things like that.

516
00:42:58,699 --> 00:42:58,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Like...

517
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,882
[SPEAKER_06]: It gets drowned out by the music.

518
00:43:01,962 --> 00:43:03,103
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds really out of place.

519
00:43:03,123 --> 00:43:04,144
[SPEAKER_06]: It gets really repetitive.

520
00:43:04,484 --> 00:43:04,985
[SPEAKER_06]: It's horrible.

521
00:43:05,505 --> 00:43:08,087
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, not a fan of that.

522
00:43:09,708 --> 00:43:14,252
[SPEAKER_06]: So when I was actually playing the game DuckTales Remastered, I was having a great time.

523
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:16,294
[SPEAKER_06]: I could have done without all the other crap, sorry to say.

524
00:43:17,374 --> 00:43:18,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, what else?

525
00:43:18,776 --> 00:43:20,457
[SPEAKER_06]: There was one other thing I wanted to say about DuckTales.

526
00:43:20,677 --> 00:43:32,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I will say this, and I know this has got to be unique to the Wii U. I kind of think it was a lazy port, which shouldn't be a surprise whatsoever, but speaking of sound design, there was no, uh...

527
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,468
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

528
00:43:56,756 --> 00:43:57,898
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to mute the gamepad.

529
00:43:58,278 --> 00:44:00,340
[SPEAKER_06]: I cannot play the game with sound on the gamepad.

530
00:44:00,901 --> 00:44:04,285
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's a little bit annoying because the Nintendo games don't have that problem.

531
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:06,588
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all synced up just fine.

532
00:44:06,988 --> 00:44:09,992
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that's just a lazy port problem.

533
00:44:10,733 --> 00:44:11,794
[SPEAKER_06]: But it is what it is.

534
00:44:12,034 --> 00:44:18,076
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I mean, I'm just saying overall in terms of the voices, I didn't notice a problem at all on the PC.

535
00:44:19,037 --> 00:44:24,019
[SPEAKER_15]: So I might have to stream it when I'm playing through it just to see if anything comes across.

536
00:44:24,259 --> 00:44:35,663
[SPEAKER_06]: It could also just be taste and maybe, you know, not to say you don't have an ear for this, DarkSakura, but having done audio editing for all these years doing the show, I just can hear it and I go, my God, where did they take this guy?

537
00:44:35,683 --> 00:44:36,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Because he sounds awful.

538
00:44:37,203 --> 00:44:40,825
[SPEAKER_15]: After the show, I'd like to hear yours because I can tell you if there's a difference.

539
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:41,105
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

540
00:44:41,809 --> 00:44:43,150
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

541
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:23,841
[SPEAKER_06]: I will know next week And it's something I can't control So I'll tell you off air why But we'll talk about that later DarkSakura and Loki may put something else together We have to figure all that out Because I got something dropped on me I will know next week for sure

542
00:45:24,741 --> 00:45:25,621
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Loki, DragonCon

543
00:45:52,970 --> 00:46:20,531
[SPEAKER_06]: So definitely come see that Saturday night, 5.30 is the VOG Super Show Not just me, Bobby Blackwolf, PodCulture I don't even remember, Travis Donovan's gonna be there One of the Critical Myth guys is there I hope I'm not forgetting everybody, anybody But yeah, so it'll be a whole bunch of us that do shows at VOG And possibly some surprises in store during that panel That's all I can say Like magical plane tickets for me Well, and you get a car, and you get a car No, nothing like that

544
00:46:21,451 --> 00:46:26,875
[SPEAKER_06]: If you miss me Saturday night because, I don't know, there's something else going on, a good time to find me would be Monday at 11.30.

545
00:46:27,275 --> 00:46:29,316
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a streaming podcast panel.

546
00:46:29,917 --> 00:46:32,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby's going to be a part of that, so I will be there just to support.

547
00:46:33,178 --> 00:46:33,979
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, me too.

548
00:46:34,039 --> 00:46:35,020
[SPEAKER_06]: I do a streaming podcast.

549
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:36,400
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll be there.

550
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,861
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be your second chance to see me.

551
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:40,203
[SPEAKER_06]: But then I fly out of town Monday night.

552
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:43,545
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you don't see me Monday at 11.30, you probably missed me.

553
00:46:43,725 --> 00:46:44,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Just saying.

554
00:46:44,725 --> 00:46:49,188
[SPEAKER_06]: So I will remind you of that next week during the last show before DragonCon.

555
00:46:49,648 --> 00:46:50,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Just saying.

556
00:46:51,289 --> 00:46:53,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, friend us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

557
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:57,250
[SPEAKER_06]: We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

558
00:46:58,571 --> 00:47:00,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to our news tonight.

559
00:47:01,231 --> 00:47:02,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, why don't you start us off?

560
00:47:02,752 --> 00:47:03,152
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

561
00:47:03,892 --> 00:47:12,174
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's been a lot of changes for the Xbox One for sure since the original announcement.

562
00:47:13,774 --> 00:47:16,936
[SPEAKER_08]: They're trying to fix what people didn't like.

563
00:47:17,096 --> 00:47:20,178
[SPEAKER_08]: And so here's another notch to add to that.

564
00:47:20,658 --> 00:47:27,883
[SPEAKER_08]: The Xbox One will no longer require the Kinect to be plugged in in order for the system to work.

565
00:47:27,943 --> 00:47:28,323
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

566
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:32,225
[SPEAKER_08]: You can play with the system unconnected from the Kinect.

567
00:47:32,586 --> 00:47:38,409
[SPEAKER_08]: However, if you're going to play a game that requires the Kinect, then obviously you have to plug it in.

568
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:41,972
[SPEAKER_08]: XBOX One Controllers

569
00:48:06,519 --> 00:48:09,882
[SPEAKER_08]: You can get one for PC, but the drivers aren't coming out until 2014.

570
00:48:09,942 --> 00:48:20,192
[SPEAKER_08]: And basically, as we've stated, the Xbox One controller, although it looks similar in many ways, shares no underlying technology with the current Xbox 360.

571
00:48:20,632 --> 00:48:29,600
[SPEAKER_08]: New wireless protocol combined with the ability to work in wired mode and additional features like impulse triggers means software has to be written and optimized for the PC.

572
00:48:30,762 --> 00:48:32,043
[SPEAKER_08]: However...

573
00:48:34,232 --> 00:48:38,153
[SPEAKER_08]: This week, there was a big announcement for Call of Duty showing off the multiplayer.

574
00:48:38,694 --> 00:48:41,635
[SPEAKER_08]: And the game was being played on PC with Xbox One controllers.

575
00:48:41,895 --> 00:48:49,978
[SPEAKER_08]: So those dumb fucks have the drivers, but they're making excuses so that if you really want to play with that controller, you better buy an Xbox One.

576
00:48:50,758 --> 00:48:56,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Just playing devil's advocate, could they have been developed third party?

577
00:48:56,243 --> 00:48:57,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Could it be a Joy to Key situation?

578
00:48:58,005 --> 00:49:05,872
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's not because it was on a PC version of the game because they were able to go in the options and there was an enable gamepad option on there.

579
00:49:06,432 --> 00:49:11,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Why would you purposely delay the release of the drivers?

580
00:49:11,998 --> 00:49:16,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Because people then, oh, I want to get the Xbox One experience with Call of Duty and Battlefield.

581
00:49:17,323 --> 00:49:21,427
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just going to buy the PC versions, and I don't need to buy an next-gen console for that.

582
00:49:21,787 --> 00:49:25,371
[SPEAKER_08]: So what they're trying to do is trying to get the sync in so all these people that...

583
00:49:25,831 --> 00:49:29,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Really need to have that controller are going to buy, you know.

584
00:49:29,454 --> 00:49:29,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing.

585
00:49:30,916 --> 00:49:34,479
[SPEAKER_06]: I would think you just pull, yank the 360 controllers off the market.

586
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:36,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I guess you really can't do that when you're still selling the console.

587
00:49:37,621 --> 00:49:41,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Because as I say, for the PC people, make that not an option.

588
00:49:41,024 --> 00:49:41,885
[SPEAKER_06]: They have to get the Xbox One.

589
00:49:41,945 --> 00:49:47,330
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a huge deal because, I mean, all you're really getting is those impulse control, you know, the impulse triggers or whatever.

590
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:48,891
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess they have to build that in.

591
00:49:48,932 --> 00:49:50,513
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's still kind of stupid.

592
00:49:50,713 --> 00:49:51,914
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why they would do that.

593
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:52,335
[SPEAKER_08]: But...

594
00:49:53,035 --> 00:49:55,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever, you know, that's their decision.

595
00:49:55,456 --> 00:49:57,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I guess I just won't buy another controller.

596
00:49:57,557 --> 00:49:59,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Not that I really need one anyways.

597
00:50:00,338 --> 00:50:01,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you getting the one at launch?

598
00:50:01,699 --> 00:50:01,739
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

599
00:50:01,759 --> 00:50:02,159
[SPEAKER_08]: At this point?

600
00:50:02,219 --> 00:50:02,879
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't think you were.

601
00:50:03,299 --> 00:50:06,100
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not planning on getting one at all at the moment.

602
00:50:07,241 --> 00:50:11,263
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm still kind of on the fence with the PlayStation 4 just because of Grand Theft Auto V.

603
00:50:12,683 --> 00:50:36,823
[SPEAKER_08]: and just because the launch lineup is not that strong I mean there's you know Killzone which looks cool but it's not really a game I'm interested in like I've played some of the other Killzone games and it's just not not my thing if it was a Resistance game or something that might be a whole different story because I'm a real big fan of Resistance but uh Killzone I'm not a huge fan of Drive Club I'm kind of eh and um Knack I just really don't care about Knack

604
00:50:37,043 --> 00:50:38,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Infamous looks great.

605
00:50:38,205 --> 00:50:40,708
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd definitely pick up Infamous next year.

606
00:50:41,228 --> 00:50:42,910
[SPEAKER_08]: But I still might.

607
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:48,377
[SPEAKER_08]: I still may pick one up just because I already have my pre-order in with Amazon.

608
00:50:48,417 --> 00:50:50,800
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see what they announce this week and stuff.

609
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:53,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe they'll announce that there's a packing game or something like that.

610
00:50:53,683 --> 00:50:55,045
[SPEAKER_08]: That might sweeten the deal a little bit.

611
00:50:55,425 --> 00:51:00,288
[SPEAKER_06]: GameGuru also has a good point in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com when it comes to this Call of Duty ghosts and all this.

612
00:51:00,708 --> 00:51:03,269
[SPEAKER_06]: GameGuru says people could just stick with a 360 controller.

613
00:51:03,349 --> 00:51:03,849
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

614
00:51:03,889 --> 00:51:04,110
[SPEAKER_06]: You could.

615
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:04,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

616
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:05,170
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand.

617
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:17,657
[SPEAKER_06]: So that would seem really ridiculous that people, that they would hold back the drivers for that reason you're saying because if somebody really wants to have a console experience on a PC or whatever, like if you really want to play controller on a PC, then just, yeah, use a 360 controller.

618
00:51:17,677 --> 00:51:18,097
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

619
00:51:18,177 --> 00:51:22,079
[SPEAKER_08]: But my point is, so they have the drivers available, so their reasoning behind it is, oh, we have to

620
00:51:22,159 --> 00:51:22,659
[SPEAKER_08]: and DarkSakura.

621
00:51:48,676 --> 00:51:51,838
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not that hard to develop drivers for a controller.

622
00:51:52,099 --> 00:51:52,679
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, come on.

623
00:51:52,739 --> 00:51:54,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it wouldn't seem like it's that.

624
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:59,243
[SPEAKER_08]: I would think if anything, I'm thinking probably you'd see a third-party solution from some hackers.

625
00:51:59,323 --> 00:52:02,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there going to be a USB plugged-in version?

626
00:52:02,746 --> 00:52:03,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's the thing.

627
00:52:03,827 --> 00:52:12,172
[SPEAKER_08]: The controller has a battery pack that you can put in there, and when you plug it in, it shuts off the radio for the wireless, so it acts like a wired controller.

628
00:52:12,192 --> 00:52:13,473
[SPEAKER_06]: This is like a PlayStation 3 controller.

629
00:52:13,593 --> 00:52:13,773
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

630
00:52:14,114 --> 00:52:14,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

631
00:52:14,774 --> 00:52:15,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Sort of.

632
00:52:15,314 --> 00:52:15,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

633
00:52:15,655 --> 00:52:15,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Sort of.

634
00:52:16,115 --> 00:52:16,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

635
00:52:16,855 --> 00:52:16,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

636
00:52:17,896 --> 00:52:30,379
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, speaking of Xbox One, some changes with the launch of the Xbox One, and that is certain countries kind of got screwed with the launch because Xbox One was originally going to launch in 21 different countries.

637
00:52:30,479 --> 00:52:41,501
[SPEAKER_06]: However, Microsoft, in a blog post, said that goal was too aggressive and that Xbox One will only be available in 13 territories this November.

638
00:52:41,981 --> 00:52:46,822
[SPEAKER_06]: So Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Sweden, Switzerland...

639
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:47,763
[SPEAKER_06]: You got screwed.

640
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:50,484
[SPEAKER_06]: So you will get the console in 2014 instead.

641
00:52:50,504 --> 00:52:50,985
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

642
00:52:52,065 --> 00:52:52,766
[SPEAKER_15]: Russia earned it.

643
00:52:55,128 --> 00:52:56,609
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a whole nother Oprah.

644
00:52:57,909 --> 00:53:03,613
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's bad ship yields is what they can't make enough to cover all those countries.

645
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:09,197
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe they're just trying to fortify their position in the countries that they know that they can do well in.

646
00:53:09,858 --> 00:53:11,719
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's still kind of lame.

647
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:16,222
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I understand why they're doing it, but at the same time, you know,

648
00:53:16,522 --> 00:53:20,551
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially, like, I'm surprised that they're not trying to make more headway in Japan.

649
00:53:20,932 --> 00:53:21,353
[SPEAKER_08]: They just, like...

650
00:53:22,948 --> 00:53:25,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, they have written off Japan.

651
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:29,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we've sucked it up for the Xbox 360 and we're definitely not going to try any harder.

652
00:53:30,613 --> 00:53:33,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I shouldn't say that because they are supposed to be doing Tokyo Game Show.

653
00:53:34,315 --> 00:53:48,504
[SPEAKER_06]: They're trying to build Buzz somehow over there and who knows what they're keeping in their hat to show at Tokyo Game Show that maybe would be something you never know what type of studio they pulled together or something to create a very Japanese RPG or something.

654
00:53:48,884 --> 00:53:52,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, I guess they tried that on 360 and it didn't totally pan out.

655
00:53:52,246 --> 00:53:52,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

656
00:53:52,346 --> 00:53:53,447
[SPEAKER_06]: I was high on Vicodin, Rob.

657
00:53:53,487 --> 00:53:53,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Fair enough.

658
00:53:53,847 --> 00:53:54,787
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it was cool.

659
00:53:55,448 --> 00:53:56,548
[SPEAKER_06]: And I always like Toriyama's art style.

660
00:53:56,568 --> 00:53:57,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude designed Chrono Trigger.

661
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:15,352
[SPEAKER_06]: AkumaJP says we don't care

662
00:54:25,766 --> 00:54:32,368
[SPEAKER_06]: and, well, and you guys clearly have shown that through the Xbox 360, which, you know, fair is fair.

663
00:54:33,008 --> 00:54:36,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, just quickly, these are the territories that will get Xbox One.

664
00:54:36,689 --> 00:54:43,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Spain, United Kingdom, United States, New Zealand.

665
00:54:43,431 --> 00:54:48,553
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad Germany's on there because that'd be really awkward to make an announcement at Gamescom.

666
00:54:48,593 --> 00:54:51,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, this console will be launching this year.

667
00:54:51,634 --> 00:54:54,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wait, no, not for you guys.

668
00:54:54,135 --> 00:54:55,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine.

669
00:54:55,695 --> 00:54:56,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anyhow.

670
00:54:57,996 --> 00:54:59,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Going on to Xbox One.

671
00:54:59,437 --> 00:55:00,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, here's the thing though.

672
00:55:00,217 --> 00:55:02,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's assume it wasn't coming out in Germany for whatever reason.

673
00:55:03,358 --> 00:55:04,419
[SPEAKER_06]: It might actually be okay.

674
00:55:04,619 --> 00:55:07,380
[SPEAKER_06]: And these countries that want one bad enough, guess what?

675
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:11,622
[SPEAKER_06]: The Xbox One games are no longer going to be region locked.

676
00:55:12,903 --> 00:55:13,283
Sorry.

677
00:55:13,843 --> 00:55:15,825
[SPEAKER_06]: The Xbox One games will not be region locked.

678
00:55:16,885 --> 00:55:24,551
[SPEAKER_06]: So in an interview with Eurogamer, Xbox One, they said, when the console launches this November, we will support the Xbox One in 13 markets.

679
00:55:24,811 --> 00:55:29,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Xbox One may be used in all countries, including the non-launched markets.

680
00:55:29,994 --> 00:55:32,756
[SPEAKER_06]: In addition, Xbox One games are not region locked.

681
00:55:33,317 --> 00:55:38,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Any Xbox One game purchased at retail can be used in any country on any Xbox One.

682
00:55:38,661 --> 00:55:42,443
[SPEAKER_08]: That was part of their original 180 flip thing, that that was going to happen.

683
00:55:42,463 --> 00:55:42,503
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

684
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:57,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, clarified that even with this change in the 13 lineups, if you live in one of the eight affected countries, you could get around it and still have a good experience with Xbox One.

685
00:55:58,590 --> 00:55:59,331
[SPEAKER_06]: This is good, though.

686
00:55:59,851 --> 00:56:02,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm glad that everybody's going region-free.

687
00:56:02,432 --> 00:56:04,313
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, this is the obvious answer.

688
00:56:05,093 --> 00:56:06,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's still region-locked?

689
00:56:06,074 --> 00:56:07,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Only Nintendo at this point?

690
00:56:07,054 --> 00:56:07,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo, yes.

691
00:56:07,954 --> 00:56:08,515
[SPEAKER_06]: Tsk, tsk.

692
00:56:09,655 --> 00:56:10,296
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

693
00:56:10,316 --> 00:56:10,616
[SPEAKER_08]: Tis-tis.

694
00:56:10,696 --> 00:56:14,580
[SPEAKER_08]: And the sad thing was they were sort of on region locked at one point.

695
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:15,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they were going that way.

696
00:56:15,681 --> 00:56:17,663
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the 3DS, they're like, eh.

697
00:56:17,803 --> 00:56:21,547
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the 3DS is because they couldn't really figure out their marketplace too well.

698
00:56:21,607 --> 00:56:26,592
[SPEAKER_08]: And so they didn't know how to, I guess, make the purchase and be region free or something.

699
00:56:26,732 --> 00:56:29,194
[SPEAKER_08]: And so because of that, that might be why it's locked down.

700
00:56:29,775 --> 00:56:30,155
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

701
00:56:30,195 --> 00:56:31,256
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe because of piracy.

702
00:56:31,977 --> 00:56:34,259
[SPEAKER_08]: But, yeah, it's, I don't know, whatever.

703
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:52,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Was there more later?

704
00:56:52,471 --> 00:56:54,053
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought we had one more Xbox story.

705
00:56:54,353 --> 00:57:05,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, anyway, despite everything you're saying about, you know, the Kinect and the controllers and, you know, the region locking and all that stuff, you know, Xbox is giving people what they wanted and it's kind of impressive.

706
00:57:05,887 --> 00:57:08,471
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought originally after E3 it wasn't going to happen this fast.

707
00:57:08,931 --> 00:57:09,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's not forget.

708
00:57:10,612 --> 00:57:12,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Don Mattrick's not running things anymore either.

709
00:57:12,813 --> 00:57:16,454
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's definitely been a change in how things are being run.

710
00:57:17,414 --> 00:57:23,296
[SPEAKER_06]: And whether that's coming at his former level or a higher level, who knows?

711
00:57:24,537 --> 00:57:27,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and I'm not sure how much more they're going to really be able to do.

712
00:57:27,558 --> 00:57:32,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially with the price and doing a skew without Connect to drop the price.

713
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:33,440
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think that's going to happen because...

714
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:34,661
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

715
00:57:52,173 --> 00:58:05,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Hell, all the games they showed at E3 didn't use Kinect I mean, they may have supported it but they sure as hell didn't demonstrate Kinect The one thing I liked most about Kinect was the whole people calling each other to talk during TV shows

716
00:58:06,365 --> 00:58:06,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have an iPhone?

717
00:58:06,865 --> 00:58:06,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

718
00:58:06,965 --> 00:58:08,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know people that have an Android phone?

719
00:58:08,686 --> 00:58:08,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

720
00:58:08,786 --> 00:58:09,967
[SPEAKER_06]: You know those have Skype on them.

721
00:58:10,547 --> 00:58:11,087
[SPEAKER_06]: They do, they do.

722
00:58:11,187 --> 00:58:11,707
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're free.

723
00:58:11,747 --> 00:58:14,468
[SPEAKER_06]: There's something about having it right there on the TV, though.

724
00:58:15,069 --> 00:58:15,469
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

725
00:58:36,308 --> 00:58:36,528
[SPEAKER_06]: My mom.

726
00:58:53,194 --> 00:58:54,315
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

727
00:59:11,994 --> 00:59:39,650
[SPEAKER_08]: I can check my Twitter feed and my Facebook and then no it's just it's not alright GameGuru in chat says it is rather admirable that Microsoft is actually reversing their horrible horrible idea though they never should have had it in the first place I'll tell you what though having you know tried streaming this week and stuff I am definitely looking forward to the console you know recording and streaming functionality of both consoles so I think that's pretty awesome it's just you know

728
00:59:41,345 --> 00:59:43,648
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, just anything to make it easier would be fantastic.

729
00:59:44,169 --> 00:59:45,751
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's move on to another article.

730
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:49,662
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, well, I don't know how people are going to feel.

731
00:59:50,703 --> 00:59:57,408
[SPEAKER_15]: So for anyone who has been looking into Xenoblade Chronicles, of course, it's an exclusive at GameStop.

732
00:59:57,608 --> 01:00:00,970
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, they are pretty much defending how much they're charging for it.

733
01:00:01,751 --> 01:00:02,672
[SPEAKER_15]: Basically, it's 90 bucks.

734
01:00:03,732 --> 01:00:12,118
[SPEAKER_15]: And when they were contacted, they said that they use feedback from their Power Up members to see what titles they want to bring back.

735
01:00:12,278 --> 01:00:14,040
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, talking about Xenoblade Chronicles.

736
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:19,962
[SPEAKER_15]: and that they basically were saying that the price is competitive.

737
01:00:20,202 --> 01:00:22,103
[SPEAKER_15]: It's based on market value and people will pay it.

738
01:00:23,303 --> 01:00:28,625
[SPEAKER_15]: And then they say, but our Power Up Pro members always receive a 10% discount and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

739
01:00:28,705 --> 01:00:31,567
[SPEAKER_15]: So they're basically like, we can charge it.

740
01:00:32,027 --> 01:00:32,467
[SPEAKER_15]: Screw you.

741
01:00:33,807 --> 01:00:34,168
[SPEAKER_15]: Pretty much.

742
01:00:35,428 --> 01:00:37,909
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I don't order for GameStop, but I'm just saying it's what it sounds like.

743
01:00:39,286 --> 01:00:48,474
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what's funny is last week we were talking about something else related to this whole thing and I even said in joking, oh, the good news is all these copies of Xenoblade are going back to GameStop.

744
01:00:48,814 --> 01:00:57,261
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not realize that it was under this fucking outrageous pricing scheme that they're giving to it.

745
01:00:57,281 --> 01:00:58,402
[SPEAKER_06]: It's ridiculous.

746
01:00:58,742 --> 01:01:03,767
[SPEAKER_08]: I can understand that there's an actual shortage on the game and stuff and that it's rare and that maybe the...

747
01:01:04,147 --> 01:01:04,407
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.com

748
01:01:22,088 --> 01:01:24,089
[SPEAKER_08]: All of the stores happen to have copies of it.

749
01:01:24,209 --> 01:01:34,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's very coincidental that all of a sudden all the stores have copies and they're used copies that happen to also still have unredeemed Nintendo Club codes in there.

750
01:01:35,136 --> 01:01:37,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's so convenient.

751
01:01:38,158 --> 01:01:45,120
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to say something that I'm probably going to regret saying, but this is my honest to God reaction when I hear this stuff.

752
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:52,502
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe this is just the, you know, I don't know, the Les Miserables revolution person in me or whatever.

753
01:01:53,002 --> 01:02:00,184
[SPEAKER_06]: But honest to God, Xenoblade is a great game and you should pirate it so you can play it.

754
01:02:02,113 --> 01:02:03,033
[SPEAKER_06]: That is what I'm going to say.

755
01:02:03,353 --> 01:02:06,394
[SPEAKER_06]: You should pirate Xenoblade so you can play this game because it's great.

756
01:02:06,834 --> 01:02:09,975
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's instructions on how to mod your Wii out there.

757
01:02:10,295 --> 01:02:12,855
[SPEAKER_06]: It was on a bunch of sites when the game was only out in the UK.

758
01:02:13,295 --> 01:02:14,876
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know what?

759
01:02:15,076 --> 01:02:20,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo restricting its release to only GameStop and they no longer sell it on their shop.

760
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:22,037
[SPEAKER_06]: If Nintendo was selling it on their shop, I'd say, oh, great.

761
01:02:22,097 --> 01:02:24,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you should definitely support it by going to buy this game on Nintendo.

762
01:02:25,218 --> 01:02:29,919
[SPEAKER_06]: But if this is what they're going to let happen, Nintendo is letting this happen.

763
01:02:30,865 --> 01:02:31,625
[SPEAKER_06]: You should go pirate the game.

764
01:02:55,387 --> 01:02:57,368
[SPEAKER_08]: They're gonna limit who can actually sell those games?

765
01:02:57,549 --> 01:03:00,070
[SPEAKER_08]: You really think they're gonna come down in price like Steam?

766
01:03:00,431 --> 01:03:01,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Ha ha ha!

767
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:02,732
[SPEAKER_08]: That's very funny.

768
01:03:04,533 --> 01:03:07,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby in our chatroom says, I rented it via Gamefly.

769
01:03:07,856 --> 01:03:08,736
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a great solution.

770
01:03:09,117 --> 01:03:11,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably a better one than I suggested, quite honestly.

771
01:03:11,939 --> 01:03:18,003
[SPEAKER_06]: But as much as you may think I'm terrible for what I said or whatever, I mean... I don't think you're terrible.

772
01:03:18,343 --> 01:03:19,244
[SPEAKER_06]: The reality is...

773
01:03:20,339 --> 01:03:21,199
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

774
01:03:41,829 --> 01:03:44,291
[SPEAKER_08]: They go print more copies of the game and they sell them.

775
01:03:44,772 --> 01:03:50,517
[SPEAKER_08]: But now what they've done is they're going back and reprinting it because you guys demanded it.

776
01:03:50,837 --> 01:03:51,818
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to reprint it.

777
01:03:52,639 --> 01:03:55,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I don't think the fans demanded that you charge $90 for it either.

778
01:03:57,203 --> 01:04:02,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know what they ought to do is they ought to just release it on the Wii U download shop?

779
01:04:03,428 --> 01:04:03,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

780
01:04:04,169 --> 01:04:07,392
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I would say, go ye forth and download this game.

781
01:04:07,452 --> 01:04:08,713
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great and you should play it.

782
01:04:10,287 --> 01:04:13,489
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be a great thing for them to do.

783
01:04:16,130 --> 01:04:16,891
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what, though?

784
01:04:17,391 --> 01:04:20,733
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the same thing that people were fessing at people for going out.

785
01:04:20,853 --> 01:04:34,120
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it's why Target and places like that were restricting the number of Wii's people could buy because they knew that they were a limited number and they were going to go on eBay and charge a bajillion for it, which would hurt their chances later on of actually selling the system for retail price.

786
01:04:35,101 --> 01:04:37,082
[SPEAKER_06]: FifthDream in chat says, oh, it's a Wii game?

787
01:04:37,142 --> 01:04:37,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Who gives a fuck?

788
01:04:38,203 --> 01:04:39,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Because honestly, it's great.

789
01:04:39,803 --> 01:04:40,444
[SPEAKER_06]: It really is.

790
01:04:40,464 --> 01:04:40,864
[SPEAKER_14]: I give a fuck.

791
01:04:41,284 --> 01:04:44,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you are missing out on not playing it.

792
01:04:44,886 --> 01:04:52,650
[SPEAKER_06]: I think when I originally reviewed the game, I said it's the greatest PlayStation 2 Japanese RPG you'll play on a Nintendo Wii.

793
01:04:54,468 --> 01:04:55,008
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

794
01:05:22,543 --> 01:05:26,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, before I say something else that's going to get me in trouble, let's go on to another news story.

795
01:05:26,146 --> 01:05:26,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

796
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:31,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, so Sony's got some news that they're going to be unveiling this week at Gamescom.

797
01:05:31,809 --> 01:05:38,354
[SPEAKER_08]: And that news is rumored to be their release plans for the PlayStation 4.

798
01:05:39,034 --> 01:05:42,276
[SPEAKER_08]: And those are going to be shared on August 20th during their conference.

799
01:05:42,737 --> 01:05:51,783
[SPEAKER_08]: They're emphasizing that they're going to have a brief announcement regarding the release plans for the PlayStation 4.

800
01:05:53,063 --> 01:06:15,998
[SPEAKER_08]: and also I guess Microsoft was to have some sort of announcement as well though they're saying that their conference is really short and emphasizing on developers in their games yeah I think it's basically really short because that news that they were supposed to be unveiling about the you know Xbox One systems being dev kits and stuff like that that already got leaked out so they don't have anything to talk about anymore so that's kind of unfortunate but

801
01:06:18,112 --> 01:06:20,254
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm interested to see what both parties have to say.

802
01:06:20,634 --> 01:06:26,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm also interested to see what release date they're going to give the PlayStation 4.

803
01:06:26,318 --> 01:06:27,759
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to come out this week, right?

804
01:06:27,779 --> 01:06:28,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably November.

805
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:29,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything's November.

806
01:06:29,701 --> 01:06:30,922
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd be surprised if it's October.

807
01:06:30,942 --> 01:06:33,624
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of rumors pointing to October for some reason.

808
01:06:34,344 --> 01:06:35,245
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe trying to get a jump.

809
01:06:35,925 --> 01:06:41,930
[SPEAKER_08]: Originally, I thought October because there were some placeholder dates that I had from a third party that were...

810
01:06:43,328 --> 01:06:44,509
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

811
01:07:02,264 --> 01:07:04,426
[SPEAKER_08]: There might be some more game announcements from Microsoft.

812
01:07:04,987 --> 01:07:08,611
[SPEAKER_08]: I know everyone's expecting maybe like a Crackdown 3 or something like that.

813
01:07:09,912 --> 01:07:14,657
[SPEAKER_08]: Although Saints Row 4 is coming out the same day, so there's your Crackdown 3.

814
01:07:16,929 --> 01:07:17,229
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

815
01:07:18,170 --> 01:07:20,152
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, the Crackdown 3 would be slightly interesting.

816
01:07:20,372 --> 01:07:22,274
[SPEAKER_08]: If it was a launch style, that would be even more interesting.

817
01:07:22,294 --> 01:07:23,915
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the free game on 360 now?

818
01:07:24,175 --> 01:07:26,517
[SPEAKER_08]: Because Crackdown was the first half of the month, right?

819
01:07:26,617 --> 01:07:28,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Dead Rising 2 and Dead Rising Case Zero.

820
01:07:28,859 --> 01:07:30,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm going to have to pick that up.

821
01:07:30,781 --> 01:07:32,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I put it in my queue.

822
01:07:32,602 --> 01:07:37,846
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been putting everything in my queue, except for that last Xbox Live Arcade game, because I don't give a shit about that.

823
01:07:38,087 --> 01:07:41,309
[SPEAKER_08]: But I've been just putting it all in my queue, but...

824
01:07:42,512 --> 01:07:43,673
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, they're okay.

825
01:07:43,853 --> 01:07:46,934
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just at the same time it's not exactly like PlayStation Plus.

826
01:07:46,954 --> 01:07:48,815
[SPEAKER_08]: I did put Hitman Absolution.

827
01:07:48,855 --> 01:07:58,939
[SPEAKER_08]: The problem, and this goes back to the whole digital download thing, it's a 17 gig download for Hitman because it's PlayStation 3.

828
01:07:59,259 --> 01:08:08,883
[SPEAKER_08]: It's 17 gigs and my network timed out in the middle of the download because it was a few hours even though I have pretty fast internet.

829
01:08:09,663 --> 01:08:10,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have PlayStation?

830
01:08:10,304 --> 01:08:12,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yeah, you have PlayStation Plus because you're downloading the game.

831
01:08:12,306 --> 01:08:20,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't you just trigger it to start downloading and then turn off your PlayStation and let it download overnight when it does the... Because any outstanding downloads will download overnight.

832
01:08:20,433 --> 01:08:21,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I could.

833
01:08:21,314 --> 01:08:22,815
[SPEAKER_08]: I just... It downloaded most.

834
01:08:22,835 --> 01:08:24,777
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure it would resume it, but it's just, you know...

835
01:08:26,601 --> 01:08:27,422
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

836
01:08:41,718 --> 01:08:52,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, we kind of knew they were getting into some TV things from the earlier press conference, but now it's really starting to gel together what this might actually be, and it looks like it's going to be some type of paid TV service.

837
01:08:52,204 --> 01:08:55,265
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have thought it would have been an enhancement to PlayStation Plus.

838
01:08:55,805 --> 01:08:56,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it still is.

839
01:08:56,986 --> 01:08:59,768
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's free TV and PlayStation Plus, fuck yeah.

840
01:09:00,728 --> 01:09:03,590
[SPEAKER_06]: You would think that they would sweeten the pot with that, but I don't know.

841
01:09:03,630 --> 01:09:03,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe not.

842
01:09:04,350 --> 01:09:04,770
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway...

843
01:09:06,791 --> 01:09:11,595
[SPEAKER_06]: It's according to a report in the Wall Street Journal because Sony made a big deal with Viacom.

844
01:09:11,715 --> 01:09:13,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Viacom is a huge media company.

845
01:09:13,756 --> 01:09:14,877
[SPEAKER_06]: They own CBS, don't they?

846
01:09:15,438 --> 01:09:17,319
[SPEAKER_06]: And Paramount and all these companies.

847
01:09:18,019 --> 01:09:23,624
[SPEAKER_06]: To carry Viacom cable channels on an internet-based service for Sony products.

848
01:09:24,364 --> 01:09:28,570
[SPEAKER_06]: So you will be able to get Viacom cable channels, which is MTV and that stuff, right?

849
01:09:28,590 --> 01:09:33,697
[SPEAKER_08]: MTV Comedy Central, VH1, I don't remember what else they have.

850
01:09:33,717 --> 01:09:41,367
[SPEAKER_06]: So assumably, you will be able to get these channels through your PlayStation 3 and essentially bypass your cable box.

851
01:09:44,264 --> 01:09:46,506
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see how the cable companies are going to let that fly.

852
01:09:47,087 --> 01:09:48,388
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Viacom, though.

853
01:09:48,428 --> 01:09:53,253
[SPEAKER_08]: Viacom, they're higher up than the cable companies, so I can see how they can let that fly.

854
01:09:53,293 --> 01:09:54,835
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just interesting to me.

855
01:09:55,055 --> 01:10:02,383
[SPEAKER_06]: We've seen throughout this whole mess of Time Warner and CBS that cable companies will block whatever they want.

856
01:10:02,803 --> 01:10:05,905
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of surprised that they're going to be able to get away with this.

857
01:10:05,925 --> 01:10:07,446
[SPEAKER_08]: They can block it on their own.

858
01:10:07,906 --> 01:10:14,530
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as negotiating with other companies, they can block it on their own service, but they can't really block it off the internet.

859
01:10:14,550 --> 01:10:18,933
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so many people that are ditching cable TV in favor of Netflix and Hulu.

860
01:10:18,953 --> 01:10:20,814
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll just start raising internet prices.

861
01:10:21,515 --> 01:10:22,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you're right.

862
01:10:22,695 --> 01:10:23,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably.

863
01:10:23,596 --> 01:10:23,856
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably.

864
01:10:24,377 --> 01:10:27,343
[SPEAKER_08]: It's costing us a lot more to expand.

865
01:10:27,603 --> 01:10:30,509
[SPEAKER_06]: We gotta put these bandwidth caps on because bandwidth is super expensive.

866
01:10:30,529 --> 01:10:34,557
[SPEAKER_15]: But also keep in mind, how many people do you know who have ditched their landline for their cell phone?

867
01:10:34,998 --> 01:10:35,458
[SPEAKER_06]: True.

868
01:10:36,044 --> 01:10:37,385
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's more the same thing.

869
01:10:37,425 --> 01:10:39,206
[SPEAKER_06]: True, and AT&T is still kicking, right?

870
01:10:39,286 --> 01:10:42,828
[SPEAKER_06]: They're still putting out that blazing fast DSL.

871
01:10:43,289 --> 01:10:43,869
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

872
01:10:43,929 --> 01:10:46,011
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's not.

873
01:10:46,071 --> 01:10:58,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony also, to do on-demand programming and cable channels online, there'll be a recommended programming feature that will be influenced by content providers and an algorithm of what you've been watching.

874
01:10:59,299 --> 01:11:00,999
[SPEAKER_06]: So, interesting.

875
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:09,482
[SPEAKER_06]: June 26th, it should be noted, my birthday, Sony renewed a trademark for PlayStation TV, likely to be the final name of this.

876
01:11:09,782 --> 01:11:10,242
[SPEAKER_06]: So, who knows?

877
01:11:10,282 --> 01:11:11,922
[SPEAKER_06]: We might see more on this at Gamescom.

878
01:11:12,882 --> 01:11:18,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though they just inked this deal the other day, Apple is notorious for inking deals the night before they make an announcement.

879
01:11:19,264 --> 01:11:23,585
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you could see something, but it may be a rabbit in their hat.

880
01:11:23,605 --> 01:11:27,006
[SPEAKER_06]: They keep till later when we have more of what that's really going to be.

881
01:11:27,026 --> 01:11:27,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

882
01:11:27,566 --> 01:11:31,988
[SPEAKER_06]: I am really curious to see how Comcast, Time Warner reacts to this.

883
01:11:33,208 --> 01:11:33,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Be interesting.

884
01:11:37,750 --> 01:11:39,771
[SPEAKER_06]: GameGuru in chat says Viacom doesn't care.

885
01:11:39,811 --> 01:11:41,432
[SPEAKER_06]: They're the guys who own CBS.

886
01:11:41,812 --> 01:11:42,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

887
01:11:42,592 --> 01:12:06,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Viacom is probably really excited about this because fuck Time Warner at this point if they can get CBS on PlayStation boxes I mean this is a dream for them if Sony's giving them what they want I mean this is this is a huge piece in their favor as far as Viacom is concerned you're just bypassing the whole you know because now you can get your you know you bypass everything

888
01:12:07,549 --> 01:12:12,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, an interesting point, and I've seen this on Twitters and so forth, so this is worth discussing.

889
01:12:12,213 --> 01:12:14,295
[SPEAKER_06]: BlackWolf says, TV, TV, TV, TV.

890
01:12:14,816 --> 01:12:18,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Microsoft talks TV equals Microsoft doesn't know what they're doing.

891
01:12:18,419 --> 01:12:18,979
[SPEAKER_06]: How lame.

892
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:21,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony talks TV equals this is awesome.

893
01:12:22,222 --> 01:12:27,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, well, there's a little difference between having an IPTV service that you have going through your game console and...

894
01:12:27,987 --> 01:12:34,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Plugging in a video in through your goddamn console just be to, you know, you can watch TV on the Xbox One.

895
01:12:34,913 --> 01:12:36,214
[SPEAKER_08]: You can watch TV on your TV.

896
01:12:36,354 --> 01:12:48,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, they're saying, hey, look, we have this wonderful feature that's been featured on almost all devices since a VCR where you have a video in and then you can watch TV on your device.

897
01:12:49,064 --> 01:12:52,287
[SPEAKER_08]: All they're doing, what functionality are they really adding to Xbox?

898
01:12:53,848 --> 01:12:55,990
[SPEAKER_08]: I basically still need a cable box.

899
01:12:56,551 --> 01:12:59,674
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just my cable box is now running through my Xbox One.

900
01:13:00,034 --> 01:13:00,775
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my problem.

901
01:13:00,815 --> 01:13:05,519
[SPEAKER_08]: If it was like, hey, here's this brand new TV service that Microsoft's putting out.

902
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:09,483
[SPEAKER_08]: You can access it through the Xbox 360 or the Xbox One.

903
01:13:09,823 --> 01:13:11,185
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't need a cable box.

904
01:13:11,525 --> 01:13:12,386
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a little different.

905
01:13:13,106 --> 01:13:13,947
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my problem.

906
01:13:14,547 --> 01:13:16,308
[SPEAKER_08]: That and their unveil of the console.

907
01:13:16,328 --> 01:13:22,773
[SPEAKER_08]: They focus strictly on a lot of the entertainment things, which people are like, come on, I want to know about games because this is a gaming console type thing.

908
01:13:24,454 --> 01:13:28,777
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, too, it's not that I necessarily dislike what Microsoft is doing.

909
01:13:28,937 --> 01:13:33,761
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, to be fair, it's not like this news made me drop down the money to get a PlayStation 4.

910
01:13:34,341 --> 01:13:35,862
[SPEAKER_06]: I had made that decision long before it.

911
01:13:35,922 --> 01:13:38,344
[SPEAKER_06]: But when I hear about this enhanced value, of course I get excited.

912
01:13:38,504 --> 01:13:39,565
[SPEAKER_06]: But it is all rumor.

913
01:13:40,265 --> 01:13:41,506
[SPEAKER_06]: It may pan out to be nothing.

914
01:13:41,787 --> 01:13:43,428
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it costs too much, I won't do it.

915
01:13:43,528 --> 01:13:49,835
[SPEAKER_08]: And if Sony talks all about TV during their Gamescom announcement and stuff, that might be a little boring.

916
01:13:49,875 --> 01:13:52,097
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, I'd still rag on them about that.

917
01:13:52,518 --> 01:13:56,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, okay, that's cool that you have this TV service coming, but I kind of want to know about your games.

918
01:13:56,542 --> 01:13:58,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, unless they announce the Tester Season 4.

919
01:13:58,664 --> 01:13:59,305
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait.

920
01:13:59,485 --> 01:14:00,045
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait.

921
01:14:00,065 --> 01:14:00,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Rob.

922
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:04,809
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, will you go on Tester Season 4?

923
01:14:04,989 --> 01:14:05,269
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

924
01:14:05,549 --> 01:14:07,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I remember we tried to get her to go on Season 3.

925
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:08,171
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

926
01:14:08,611 --> 01:14:09,711
[SPEAKER_15]: They wouldn't want me anyway.

927
01:14:09,731 --> 01:14:12,212
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm too bitchy.

928
01:14:13,053 --> 01:14:16,074
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they would absolutely want you for being bitchy.

929
01:14:16,514 --> 01:14:25,659
[SPEAKER_15]: I would lay the smackdown on everybody and go, you know what, I remember when the only access we had to Sony in video games was when they made the Super Nintendo sound processor.

930
01:14:27,159 --> 01:14:28,040
[SPEAKER_06]: And some limited games.

931
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:30,901
[SPEAKER_15]: And, well, you know how PlayStation started, right?

932
01:14:31,810 --> 01:14:34,332
[SPEAKER_06]: It was supposed to be the whole CD expansion for Super Nintendo, right?

933
01:14:34,552 --> 01:14:35,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Indeed.

934
01:14:36,713 --> 01:14:37,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

935
01:14:37,714 --> 01:14:39,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, let's move on.

936
01:14:39,795 --> 01:14:41,616
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, one more story before release dates.

937
01:14:42,016 --> 01:14:43,397
[SPEAKER_15]: I was putting out my friend code.

938
01:14:43,957 --> 01:14:46,098
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm putting myself out.

939
01:14:47,559 --> 01:14:58,305
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, some people may or may not be happy about this, but the games for Windows Live Marketplace is closing on August 22nd, which is pretty much next week.

940
01:14:59,506 --> 01:15:21,319
[SPEAKER_15]: so anyway they put out an FAQ on Xbox.com so that for people who have purchased games on Windows Live and their DLC they'll still be able to play them but they won't be able to purchase additional content and basically they're afraid that there's people who are afraid that they're going to be pulling the games out of Steam as well

941
01:15:21,795 --> 01:15:24,358
[SPEAKER_15]: But as far as that, I don't really see anything about that.

942
01:15:24,378 --> 01:15:27,041
[SPEAKER_15]: They said that the games that are on Steam are still going to be on Steam.

943
01:15:27,522 --> 01:15:31,226
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just that the Microsoft points are going bye-bye, you know, which we already knew.

944
01:15:31,286 --> 01:15:37,314
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's just because they're putting everything on their Windows Marketplace now and no point in having two different marketplaces.

945
01:15:37,414 --> 01:15:39,897
[SPEAKER_15]: They're putting everything out on their inconvenience marketplace.

946
01:15:41,678 --> 01:15:47,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, you know, the Games for Windows marketplace, my only marketplace I buy games, said no one ever.

947
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:49,121
[SPEAKER_15]: Said no one, exactly.

948
01:15:50,001 --> 01:16:01,266
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just, for the people who have bought things through there, they're really inconveniencing their consumers, but... There was a free game you got when you signed up for Games for Windows Live that had achievements in it.

949
01:16:01,666 --> 01:16:02,886
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember that's why I got it.

950
01:16:04,427 --> 01:16:05,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Tinker or something like that was the game?

951
01:16:05,687 --> 01:16:06,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Rob.

952
01:16:06,448 --> 01:16:06,908
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember.

953
01:16:08,792 --> 01:16:11,455
[SPEAKER_08]: I just know that they have achievements in like Solitaire now.

954
01:16:11,596 --> 01:16:15,240
[SPEAKER_15]: And I mean, it's kind of a big thing.

955
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:19,506
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, yeah, they're definitely working on getting all their stuff ready for the X-Bone.

956
01:16:20,527 --> 01:16:21,168
[SPEAKER_15]: But in the end...

957
01:16:23,472 --> 01:16:26,393
[SPEAKER_15]: Nobody could see me shrug, but that's all I can say is shrug.

958
01:16:26,613 --> 01:16:33,455
[SPEAKER_06]: And I shed another tear for my Microsoft Game Room, which was a part of Games for Windows Live.

959
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:41,118
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you have that, my assumption is that you won't be able to buy the packs anymore because that was all integrated through Games for Windows Live.

960
01:16:41,698 --> 01:16:46,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, shit, that game's pretty much long gone if you don't have what you wanted out of that.

961
01:16:46,099 --> 01:16:47,840
[SPEAKER_15]: I haven't gotten a single thing on that.

962
01:16:48,657 --> 01:16:49,739
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually had a lot.

963
01:16:49,839 --> 01:16:51,040
[SPEAKER_06]: I had like 15 games.

964
01:16:52,682 --> 01:16:54,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Why do you think I was so mad when they pulled the plug on it?

965
01:16:55,004 --> 01:16:55,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Too soon.

966
01:16:56,446 --> 01:16:56,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

967
01:16:57,547 --> 01:17:02,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and out with the old, in with the new, I suppose.

968
01:17:03,024 --> 01:17:05,865
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, this week is actually quite a bit of stuff coming out.

969
01:17:05,885 --> 01:17:10,587
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of a little bit of a kickoff for the fourth quarter, which is creeping up earlier every year.

970
01:17:11,747 --> 01:17:16,789
[SPEAKER_08]: So this week, Saints Row 4 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

971
01:17:17,249 --> 01:17:23,091
[SPEAKER_08]: Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Blacklist on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii U, and PC.

972
01:17:24,491 --> 01:17:29,976
[SPEAKER_08]: We also have The Walking Dead, a complete first season on the Vita.

973
01:17:30,877 --> 01:17:32,998
[SPEAKER_08]: And it has an additional DLC in there as well.

974
01:17:33,559 --> 01:17:39,224
[SPEAKER_08]: New Super Luigi U for the Wii U, and that's the physical disc version of that.

975
01:17:40,465 --> 01:17:45,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, the Bureau XCOM Declassified on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

976
01:17:50,313 --> 01:17:53,677
[SPEAKER_08]: And this isn't a game, but I still think it's interesting.

977
01:17:53,917 --> 01:17:59,163
[SPEAKER_08]: The GameStick, the second Android console, is finally making its way out.

978
01:18:00,304 --> 01:18:03,688
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're going to have that and the dock as well available for that.

979
01:18:03,988 --> 01:18:04,168
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's $79.99.

980
01:18:04,208 --> 01:18:05,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, undercutting the OUYA.

981
01:18:08,713 --> 01:18:09,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

982
01:18:09,874 --> 01:18:10,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we'll see how that goes.

983
01:18:11,735 --> 01:18:12,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving to Japan.

984
01:18:13,515 --> 01:18:17,417
[SPEAKER_06]: On the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan, Disorder 6 in regular and limited edition.

985
01:18:17,877 --> 01:18:22,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Dungeons & Dragons Mysteria is out this week as well, which we've talked about before on the show.

986
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:25,421
[SPEAKER_06]: The disc release, even though there's the download release too.

987
01:18:26,261 --> 01:18:29,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Medal of Honor Warfighter gets a price reduction as it moves into the best hits.

988
01:18:29,883 --> 01:18:37,087
[SPEAKER_06]: And also out this week, Super Robot Taisen OG Saga Masoukishin 3 Pride of Justice comes out on the PlayStation 3.

989
01:18:38,267 --> 01:18:43,391
[SPEAKER_06]: on the Xbox 360, because yes, there are still a few things here and there on the 360 in Japan.

990
01:18:43,631 --> 01:18:50,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Disorder 6 in its regular and limited edition, and Medal of Honor Warfighter gets that same price reduction on the 360 as well.

991
01:18:51,397 --> 01:18:58,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving to the handhelds, on the PlayStation Vita this week, Super Robot Taisen OG Saga, that same game I mentioned before, is out on the Vita as well.

992
01:18:59,503 --> 01:19:06,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Conception 2, Shichise no Michibiki to Mazuru no Akumu comes out this week as well.

993
01:19:07,108 --> 01:19:08,169
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to know what this is about.

994
01:19:08,729 --> 01:19:09,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

995
01:19:09,749 --> 01:19:16,093
[SPEAKER_15]: Conception 2... Did you say 7 World something?

996
01:19:16,153 --> 01:19:17,614
[SPEAKER_06]: Trying to see what kind of game it is.

997
01:19:18,234 --> 01:19:21,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Looks like it might be like a tactical RPG-ish type of thing.

998
01:19:22,436 --> 01:19:23,637
[SPEAKER_15]: I've seen that design somewhere.

999
01:19:23,797 --> 01:19:25,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, very... Let me look at the name again?

1000
01:19:26,018 --> 01:19:26,178
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

1001
01:19:27,239 --> 01:19:28,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's the box art if you want to see it.

1002
01:19:28,860 --> 01:19:29,940
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, yeah, but I can't.

1003
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:30,961
[SPEAKER_06]: That's 7 something.

1004
01:19:30,981 --> 01:19:31,461
[SPEAKER_06]: God damn it.

1005
01:19:32,998 --> 01:19:34,059
[SPEAKER_06]: 7th World something and I don't know

1006
01:19:41,088 --> 01:19:42,789
[SPEAKER_15]: Ikuma, translate for us, please.

1007
01:19:42,969 --> 01:19:45,451
[SPEAKER_06]: We love you.

1008
01:19:45,551 --> 01:19:46,792
[SPEAKER_15]: Ikuma-san is our hero.

1009
01:19:47,092 --> 01:19:55,898
[SPEAKER_06]: On the Wii U this week, yes, the Wii U sees a release in the Wonderful 101, which is out in Japan on August the 24th, which I believe is the same day it's out here, right?

1010
01:19:56,218 --> 01:19:57,099
[SPEAKER_06]: That's very soon.

1011
01:19:57,699 --> 01:20:08,406
[SPEAKER_06]: And lastly, on the 3DS, that Saiyan Conception 2 game, as well as Nanami to Ishii ni Gabuko English Jotsatsu no Kutsu comes out.

1012
01:20:08,766 --> 01:20:10,707
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I think that's an English teacher.

1013
01:20:10,807 --> 01:20:13,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, let's learn English with cute anime girls.

1014
01:20:14,968 --> 01:20:16,089
[SPEAKER_15]: No, learn with Nanami.

1015
01:20:16,889 --> 01:20:16,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

1016
01:20:17,630 --> 01:20:18,630
[SPEAKER_15]: Hold on, go back to the title.

1017
01:20:18,650 --> 01:20:22,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Nanami is missing her belly button on her... No, she has her belly button, we can see it.

1018
01:20:23,112 --> 01:20:23,812
[SPEAKER_06]: On her shirt.

1019
01:20:24,032 --> 01:20:26,453
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it's like a study with Nanami.

1020
01:20:27,182 --> 01:20:30,866
[SPEAKER_06]: and Nanami also is showing a little cleavage.

1021
01:20:31,046 --> 01:20:36,092
[SPEAKER_15]: He said you need to link that other game to chat so that Ikuma-san can translate for us.

1022
01:20:36,152 --> 01:20:39,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, I will work on that while you travel to the UK.

1023
01:20:40,076 --> 01:20:40,657
[SPEAKER_15]: I wish.

1024
01:20:41,958 --> 01:20:44,160
[SPEAKER_15]: On the 20th, Disney Infinity for Damn Near Everything.

1025
01:20:45,381 --> 01:20:48,243
[SPEAKER_15]: On the 22nd, we have Skullgirls for PC.

1026
01:20:48,764 --> 01:20:49,825
[SPEAKER_15]: I want that game.

1027
01:20:50,405 --> 01:21:01,473
[SPEAKER_15]: Splinter Cell Blacklist for Wii U. On the 23rd, Saints Row 4, XCOM, XCOM, XCOM, no, The Wonderful 101, which would be my reason for getting a Wii U, and Splinter Cell Blacklist.

1028
01:21:01,993 --> 01:21:04,475
[SPEAKER_15]: Rob, if you get The Wonderful 101, I'm just going to move into your living room.

1029
01:21:04,795 --> 01:21:08,278
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a demo available on Wii U. I've downloaded it, but I've not played it yet.

1030
01:21:08,318 --> 01:21:09,979
[SPEAKER_15]: I need to see it.

1031
01:21:10,099 --> 01:21:14,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe after, well, I gotta go get Alan, so maybe during the week.

1032
01:21:15,043 --> 01:21:17,405
[SPEAKER_06]: You better do it for him out of town.

1033
01:21:17,485 --> 01:21:18,305
[SPEAKER_15]: Alan can walk.

1034
01:21:18,986 --> 01:21:20,808
[SPEAKER_15]: Hard, hard, hard, hard.

1035
01:21:20,908 --> 01:21:22,549
[SPEAKER_06]: If he's listening, he's going to cut you.

1036
01:21:22,669 --> 01:21:23,750
[SPEAKER_15]: Alan, I was joking.

1037
01:21:24,391 --> 01:21:24,871
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't cut me.

1038
01:21:26,192 --> 01:21:29,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.

1039
01:21:29,395 --> 01:21:30,036
[SPEAKER_06]: But first, Loki.

1040
01:21:33,806 --> 01:21:34,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki?

1041
01:21:35,207 --> 01:21:35,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello?

1042
01:21:36,207 --> 01:21:37,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I was listening to a Nero song.

1043
01:21:38,188 --> 01:21:38,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways.

1044
01:21:38,548 --> 01:21:39,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, no.

1045
01:21:39,288 --> 01:21:41,109
[SPEAKER_06]: What is more important than this show?

1046
01:21:41,249 --> 01:21:41,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Nero song?

1047
01:21:43,470 --> 01:21:44,331
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's talk Call of Duty.

1048
01:21:44,431 --> 01:21:48,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I did watch the Call of Duty multiplayer preview thing that they did.

1049
01:21:48,973 --> 01:21:50,333
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks kind of cool.

1050
01:21:51,394 --> 01:21:52,154
[SPEAKER_08]: It was interesting.

1051
01:21:52,194 --> 01:21:55,156
[SPEAKER_08]: They did some new stuff with it.

1052
01:21:55,196 --> 01:21:58,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, for example, they have now more character creation in there.

1053
01:21:58,897 --> 01:21:59,538
[SPEAKER_08]: You can actually...

1054
01:22:01,912 --> 01:22:02,672
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1055
01:22:23,058 --> 01:22:25,261
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's kind of cross-platform as it is.

1056
01:22:25,681 --> 01:22:27,563
[SPEAKER_08]: But the DLC thing is kind of neat.

1057
01:22:27,603 --> 01:22:36,313
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically if you buy a season pass or whatever on Xbox 360, you'll be able to take it to Xbox One, same with PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4.

1058
01:22:38,868 --> 01:22:40,969
[SPEAKER_08]: and that's not just limited to Call of Duty as well.

1059
01:22:41,049 --> 01:22:43,729
[SPEAKER_08]: It's also something that Battlefield 4 will have as well.

1060
01:22:43,789 --> 01:22:55,812
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can do a one-time transfer between the Xbox 360 and Xbox One and PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 for your stats, unlocks, ranks, award assignments and that kind of thing.

1061
01:22:56,332 --> 01:23:06,514
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of lame though that it's a one-time deal for Battlefield 4 because what if I have an Xbox 360 at my work and an Xbox One at home and I want to

1062
01:23:08,054 --> 01:23:08,815
[SPEAKER_08]: Play them both.

1063
01:23:09,195 --> 01:23:10,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Why limit that?

1064
01:23:10,896 --> 01:23:13,418
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why, but that's something that they're supporting.

1065
01:23:13,718 --> 01:23:24,445
[SPEAKER_08]: And if it gets to Xbox One saying they're supporting the season pass guarantee, that this is going to apply for a lot of different things, including, well, they had mentioned Call of Duty Ghosts and Battlefield 4.

1066
01:23:24,805 --> 01:23:27,307
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm wondering if it's other games as well.

1067
01:23:27,327 --> 01:23:30,529
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to have some sort of tie in there.

1068
01:23:33,374 --> 01:23:37,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think a lot of people will be using this or do you think people will just kind of already be upgrading or not?

1069
01:23:39,098 --> 01:23:43,682
[SPEAKER_06]: As much as I go, oh yeah, this is a neat idea, I kind of think to myself, well God, you have to buy the games twice?

1070
01:23:43,822 --> 01:23:45,043
[SPEAKER_08]: How many people are really going to do that?

1071
01:23:45,143 --> 01:23:46,504
[SPEAKER_08]: There might be some people that will do that.

1072
01:23:46,644 --> 01:24:02,075
[SPEAKER_08]: I think what's going to basically be is if, you know, say I want to buy Call of Duty this year and I'm not buying a next-gen system and then next year I want to, okay, we'll say mid-next year I want to buy a PlayStation 4 or something like that.

1073
01:24:02,395 --> 01:24:05,436
[SPEAKER_08]: If I buy it on PlayStation 3, I can buy the Season Pass.

1074
01:24:05,957 --> 01:24:07,337
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I'll do that.

1075
01:24:07,397 --> 01:24:12,600
[SPEAKER_08]: Buy the Season Pass and then, you know, I buy my new system and I know how to buy the Season Pass again.

1076
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:20,524
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't understand why it's such a big deal in the first place because they do a lot of cross-buy stuff already on the PlayStation Network.

1077
01:24:20,964 --> 01:24:26,066
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I think this would be more news for Microsoft because they don't really do any of that cross-buy stuff.

1078
01:24:27,827 --> 01:24:29,548
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I don't know.

1079
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:29,608
[SPEAKER_08]: It...

1080
01:24:32,975 --> 01:24:40,720
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess it's a cool feature, but it's something that I think should be kind of expected instead of having to buy the content more than once.

1081
01:24:41,801 --> 01:24:43,122
[SPEAKER_08]: But whatever.

1082
01:24:43,222 --> 01:24:45,484
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I guess that's cool if they're doing that.

1083
01:24:45,784 --> 01:24:49,466
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess we live in a day and age where they didn't have to.

1084
01:24:49,566 --> 01:24:51,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's one of those things now.

1085
01:24:51,788 --> 01:24:57,212
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was just going to check here real quick to see if we have that story later on about...

1086
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:20,078
[SPEAKER_08]: uh yeah i guess we do later on but uh you know a lot of this nowadays they're talking about features that they necessarily they they're already there but you may not be completely familiar with them or you may have forgotten that they have them there and now they're new you know it's like you know this whole uh what was it with the xbox um

1087
01:25:20,959 --> 01:25:22,180
[SPEAKER_08]: There was just something recently.

1088
01:25:22,460 --> 01:25:24,541
[SPEAKER_08]: There's something coming up in Part B. Yeah, I guess.

1089
01:25:25,262 --> 01:25:26,283
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it wasn't that.

1090
01:25:26,383 --> 01:25:27,103
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't that one.

1091
01:25:27,183 --> 01:25:30,245
[SPEAKER_08]: It was the game sharing thing.

1092
01:25:30,265 --> 01:25:31,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember we talked about it last week?

1093
01:25:31,986 --> 01:25:33,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you ranted about that last week.

1094
01:25:33,627 --> 01:25:39,792
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that's not a new thing, but it's something that a lot of people don't really think about, or maybe they can spin it in a way that makes sense.

1095
01:25:39,812 --> 01:25:41,493
[SPEAKER_08]: It might be better on Xbox One, to be fair.

1096
01:25:41,513 --> 01:25:43,474
[SPEAKER_08]: It is with the whole live sharing.

1097
01:25:43,554 --> 01:25:45,555
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of cool, but I don't know.

1098
01:25:45,976 --> 01:25:46,236
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1099
01:25:48,437 --> 01:25:54,784
[SPEAKER_06]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase BAR.

1100
01:25:55,445 --> 01:25:57,407
[SPEAKER_06]: This would be awesome if it's actually happening.

1101
01:25:57,507 --> 01:25:58,028
[SPEAKER_06]: No idea.

1102
01:25:58,408 --> 01:26:02,432
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's a thing going on in Japan this week called the Pokemon Game Show.

1103
01:26:02,973 --> 01:26:06,356
[SPEAKER_06]: And during this event, Nintendo actually teased...

1104
01:26:06,957 --> 01:26:11,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Potentially, don't get your hopes up, but a Pokemon title for the Wii U in 3D.

1105
01:26:11,659 --> 01:26:17,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Which would be weird because there's never been a straight up Pokemon main franchise game on the consoles.

1106
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:18,821
[SPEAKER_06]: They've always been the handhelds.

1107
01:26:19,301 --> 01:26:21,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Now there's been tons of spin-off stuff.

1108
01:26:21,822 --> 01:26:23,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, like the Rumble stuff.

1109
01:26:23,162 --> 01:26:23,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.

1110
01:26:24,102 --> 01:26:25,303
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, Pinball.

1111
01:26:25,643 --> 01:26:27,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, no, I guess Pinball was on the handhelds too.

1112
01:26:27,404 --> 01:26:28,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Pokemon Snap.

1113
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:29,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Pokemon Snap.

1114
01:26:29,784 --> 01:26:31,625
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there was the GameCube Coliseum.

1115
01:26:32,666 --> 01:26:37,170
[SPEAKER_06]: They also have the weird spin-off games, the Poke Park games that have been on the Wii.

1116
01:26:37,950 --> 01:26:42,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what happened in this video is that it was playing on the main screen.

1117
01:26:42,774 --> 01:26:47,759
[SPEAKER_06]: It had a CG Pikachu leading Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander in a Game Boy World.

1118
01:26:47,799 --> 01:26:55,766
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the end of the trailer, there was a 3D Wii U Pokemon title that showed Lusario going face-to-face with Blaziken in a futuristic city.

1119
01:26:56,587 --> 01:26:59,029
[SPEAKER_06]: And I did think to myself, I was like, you know...

1120
01:27:00,549 --> 01:27:06,017
[SPEAKER_06]: If Nintendo wanted to turn the Wii U around real quick, real quick, here's a way to do it.

1121
01:27:10,846 --> 01:27:14,989
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's going to be another Coliseum title or something.

1122
01:27:15,009 --> 01:27:17,831
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it's going to be anything like a mainstream Pokemon game.

1123
01:27:17,931 --> 01:27:30,539
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, and I said before, with the whole Skylanders and Disney Infinity stuff, I'm like, it's really only, and I know that Nintendo is doing it in some capacity, but if that's successful or whatever, it could just get even bigger.

1124
01:27:30,639 --> 01:27:37,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I know with the download thing where you can only get the figures at GameStop or whatever, it does feel in some way like getting the foot in the water.

1125
01:27:37,724 --> 01:27:39,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Figures are going to be $90 now, by the way.

1126
01:27:42,426 --> 01:27:43,246
[SPEAKER_06]: They're scarce.

1127
01:27:43,747 --> 01:27:48,567
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can't download the figure on the internet, so I don't know what to tell you if you get screwed on those.

1128
01:27:48,587 --> 01:27:51,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Technically, that's not entirely true.

1129
01:27:52,608 --> 01:28:04,350
[SPEAKER_08]: Because there are apps, and they have this with Skylanders already, there are apps where people have recorded the RFID, the near-field communication stuff, and you can actually simulate that with your phone.

1130
01:28:04,370 --> 01:28:08,831
[SPEAKER_08]: You just put your phone on the communication thing and you can play as that stuff.

1131
01:28:08,851 --> 01:28:09,151
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, I...

1132
01:28:10,211 --> 01:28:14,116
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think my phone supports that but that'd be kind of interesting to check out with Disney Infinity.

1133
01:28:14,216 --> 01:28:16,139
[SPEAKER_08]: That might be a way to get around buying figures.

1134
01:28:17,801 --> 01:28:20,184
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a strange form of piracy.

1135
01:28:21,285 --> 01:28:21,606
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like...

1136
01:28:22,816 --> 01:28:23,997
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what you're going to call that.

1137
01:28:24,117 --> 01:28:24,737
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

1138
01:28:25,258 --> 01:28:32,383
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to travel back to a time when there wasn't these fucking figures you had to buy to get the whole experience of the game.

1139
01:28:32,423 --> 01:28:33,224
[SPEAKER_16]: It's all about patches.

1140
01:28:33,764 --> 01:28:35,766
[SPEAKER_06]: No, there was no patches back then either.

1141
01:28:36,146 --> 01:28:37,887
[SPEAKER_06]: If the game was fucked, it was fucked.

1142
01:28:38,488 --> 01:28:43,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Games back then went through a process called testing, which I think is sometimes skipped now.

1143
01:28:44,372 --> 01:28:46,754
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a seal of approval, goddammit.

1144
01:28:47,174 --> 01:28:51,597
[SPEAKER_06]: As is the case of Disney Infinity on PlayStation 3, if Twitter is any indication.

1145
01:28:51,638 --> 01:28:51,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Ha ha ha.

1146
01:28:52,438 --> 01:28:52,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1147
01:28:53,159 --> 01:29:00,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, DarkSakura, why don't you step into the gaming vault and take us back to a time when games didn't have all this shit.

1148
01:29:01,964 --> 01:29:03,725
[SPEAKER_15]: By the way, I did just beat Find Me.

1149
01:29:04,385 --> 01:29:05,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, congrats.

1150
01:29:05,286 --> 01:29:06,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Did I slay the final boss?

1151
01:29:06,967 --> 01:29:08,308
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, a wandering hero did.

1152
01:29:09,708 --> 01:29:11,049
[SPEAKER_15]: But you almost did it.

1153
01:29:11,510 --> 01:29:12,870
[SPEAKER_15]: It was one hit point off.

1154
01:29:12,910 --> 01:29:13,351
[SPEAKER_15]: So, Rob?

1155
01:29:13,631 --> 01:29:14,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Story of my life.

1156
01:29:14,691 --> 01:29:16,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody comes in and snatches all my glory.

1157
01:29:16,933 --> 01:29:17,733
[SPEAKER_06]: You said snatch.

1158
01:29:17,813 --> 01:29:18,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Story of my life.

1159
01:29:19,114 --> 01:29:20,195
[SPEAKER_15]: The game is Guilty Gear X.

1160
01:29:22,677 --> 01:29:23,097
[SPEAKER_15]: Guilty Gear X

1161
01:29:47,237 --> 01:29:50,618
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's supposed to take place a few weeks after the first game.

1162
01:29:51,859 --> 01:29:52,999
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a new Commander gear.

1163
01:29:53,039 --> 01:30:00,682
[SPEAKER_15]: Basically, it takes everything that was good about the, uh... About the, uh...

1164
01:30:03,078 --> 01:30:03,859
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for watching!

1165
01:30:21,552 --> 01:30:23,174
[SPEAKER_15]: So, moving forward.

1166
01:30:23,214 --> 01:30:26,297
[SPEAKER_15]: So yeah, the Dreamcast 1 had a limited release.

1167
01:30:26,537 --> 01:30:31,703
[SPEAKER_15]: It came with a special mini-CD that had different artworks that you could view on the PC.

1168
01:30:32,423 --> 01:30:39,851
[SPEAKER_15]: There was a Type A, Type B, and Type C. And it had different images printed on the GD-ROM disc instead.

1169
01:30:40,271 --> 01:30:44,476
[SPEAKER_15]: As far as the characters in it, it has a bunch of people from the first game.

1170
01:30:44,616 --> 01:30:51,143
[SPEAKER_15]: It had Soul Bad Guy, which is funny because Soul Bad Guy was actually voiced by the creator of the series.

1171
01:30:52,717 --> 01:31:04,219
[SPEAKER_15]: and had Mei, Baiken, Kaikisuke, Potemkin, Chip Xanath, Meliorage, Zatoan, Axel Lowe, and Testament.

1172
01:31:04,739 --> 01:31:12,781
[SPEAKER_15]: It had new characters like Jim, Kurado Berry, Johnny, Anji, Mito, Venom, Dizzy, and Roboki.

1173
01:31:13,181 --> 01:31:17,722
[SPEAKER_15]: So it was a really fun fighting game.

1174
01:31:17,862 --> 01:31:18,142
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean...

1175
01:31:19,884 --> 01:31:24,046
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually have the Guilty Gear Petite on Wonderswan, by the way, which was also super fun.

1176
01:31:24,066 --> 01:31:26,047
[SPEAKER_15]: But I've enjoyed every game in the series.

1177
01:31:26,087 --> 01:31:30,850
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'd have to say that I didn't really enjoy the series until this one came out.

1178
01:31:31,450 --> 01:31:37,333
[SPEAKER_15]: As far as other versions came out, there was X+, that was an enhanced version that had two extra characters.

1179
01:31:37,413 --> 01:31:40,695
[SPEAKER_15]: It came out on the PS2 in Japan only.

1180
01:31:41,316 --> 01:31:41,476
[SPEAKER_15]: And...

1181
01:31:42,556 --> 01:31:44,857
[SPEAKER_15]: That was on November 29th.

1182
01:31:44,978 --> 01:31:53,542
[SPEAKER_15]: And then there was basically just a bare-bones port of the Dreamcast 1 that didn't have any of the extra stuff from the Japanese version that came out in the US and Europe.

1183
01:31:54,723 --> 01:31:58,445
[SPEAKER_15]: The two new characters were Cliff Anderson and Justice.

1184
01:31:59,565 --> 01:32:01,126
[SPEAKER_15]: It had different game modes.

1185
01:32:01,466 --> 01:32:03,687
[SPEAKER_15]: It had all kinds of different moves.

1186
01:32:03,727 --> 01:32:04,568
[SPEAKER_15]: It was really neat.

1187
01:32:04,648 --> 01:32:07,329
[SPEAKER_15]: And more in the story mode and password mode.

1188
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:15,473
[SPEAKER_15]: The advanced version came out on GBA and it was basically the arcade version.

1189
01:32:16,034 --> 01:32:18,755
[SPEAKER_15]: And it had all of the characters except for RoboKey.

1190
01:32:19,475 --> 01:32:22,857
[SPEAKER_15]: But it was just different stuff.

1191
01:32:23,297 --> 01:32:27,639
[SPEAKER_15]: There was version 1.5 as well that had some of the stuff from Guilty Gear XX.

1192
01:32:28,299 --> 01:32:33,422
[SPEAKER_15]: There was Petite, which is the one I mentioned earlier, the Wonderswan Color version, which was...

1193
01:32:34,142 --> 01:32:34,722
[SPEAKER_15]: Pretty fun.

1194
01:32:34,783 --> 01:32:37,264
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it was actually super cutesy, guilty gear.

1195
01:32:37,284 --> 01:32:40,006
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all I can say, and I've beaten that several times.

1196
01:32:40,486 --> 01:32:46,771
[SPEAKER_15]: Petite 2 came out, and it also had all the arcade characters, except for Bike and Dizzy and Robokai.

1197
01:32:48,852 --> 01:32:50,273
[SPEAKER_15]: It had Fanny coming back.

1198
01:32:50,373 --> 01:32:55,797
[SPEAKER_15]: I have to laugh every time I say that, because that's also slang for girl bits.

1199
01:32:56,317 --> 01:32:57,017
[SPEAKER_15]: It was really cute.

1200
01:32:57,558 --> 01:33:03,722
[SPEAKER_15]: The one I owned, though, was Petite, and then there was Club and Raid of Arms, but honestly, the Dreamcast one, awesome.

1201
01:33:05,401 --> 01:33:06,462
[SPEAKER_15]: And now the story about this.

1202
01:33:07,003 --> 01:33:15,093
[SPEAKER_15]: Back in the day when we used to rip our Dreamcast games, we actually found out the hard way.

1203
01:33:15,173 --> 01:33:18,637
[SPEAKER_15]: This is the game that my friend Julie learned to...

1204
01:33:20,639 --> 01:33:21,919
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I forgot her.

1205
01:33:22,540 --> 01:33:23,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone's forgotten her.

1206
01:33:23,740 --> 01:33:25,060
[SPEAKER_06]: She's a figment of my imagination.

1207
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:25,540
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

1208
01:33:25,580 --> 01:33:26,220
[SPEAKER_15]: She may as well be.

1209
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:27,761
[SPEAKER_15]: I haven't heard from her in ages.

1210
01:33:28,461 --> 01:33:34,022
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, Julie was trying to figure out how to rip Dreamcast games, and this was the game she tried on.

1211
01:33:34,082 --> 01:33:36,963
[SPEAKER_15]: So we had many, many copies of the soundtrack.

1212
01:33:37,983 --> 01:33:39,724
[SPEAKER_15]: Many copies of the soundtrack.

1213
01:33:40,504 --> 01:33:43,865
[SPEAKER_15]: And learned quite a bit about the data that went to GBROM.

1214
01:33:46,545 --> 01:33:49,706
[SPEAKER_15]: Or I should say GDROM, the GigaDisc.

1215
01:33:51,781 --> 01:33:56,364
[SPEAKER_15]: So, great soundtrack, great game, great characters, lots of cosplay fun.

1216
01:33:56,384 --> 01:34:01,006
[SPEAKER_15]: I, you know, still have my Baiken costume, except for the claw, which belonged to Evan.

1217
01:34:04,488 --> 01:34:05,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Cosplay memories.

1218
01:34:05,762 --> 01:34:07,023
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1219
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:55,420
[SPEAKER_15]: and oh my god I had the worst cramp and I ended up just having to think of another way to tuck it into the sleeve because it was a pain to cosplay but it was fun costume all right there it is your classic game of the week Guilty Gear X all right it doesn't it doesn't feel like the game is that old but I guess it's over 10 years old well in the first Guilty Gear you know was PlayStation

1220
01:34:55,876 --> 01:34:56,156
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1221
01:34:56,657 --> 01:35:00,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's going to do it for this half of Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere.

1222
01:35:00,161 --> 01:35:08,970
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got plenty more show coming up, including some rapid-fire news, the Fugle Question of the Week, emails, and your phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1223
01:35:09,170 --> 01:35:12,294
[SPEAKER_06]: When we come back with all more Orange Lounge Radio.

1224
01:35:19,042 --> 01:35:21,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

1231
01:35:55,284 --> 01:35:56,185
[SPEAKER_15]: Rob, I have a request.

1232
01:35:56,405 --> 01:35:56,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1233
01:35:57,206 --> 01:36:02,049
[SPEAKER_15]: When we're officially into Final Fantasy land, you need to make a version of Sassy Pants.

1234
01:36:03,630 --> 01:36:07,052
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought about naming my character that, but... Lil' Poundcake is cute, though.

1235
01:36:07,192 --> 01:36:16,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, I named my character in Final Fantasy XIV Lil' Poundcake, and she's a little... I still want to say Taru-Tarus, because that's the word in Final Fantasy XI, but I guess they're... Lalafel, or Falafel.

1236
01:36:16,718 --> 01:36:17,659
[SPEAKER_06]: I call them Falafels.

1237
01:36:17,999 --> 01:36:18,979
[SPEAKER_06]: She's a little falafel.

1238
01:36:19,580 --> 01:36:20,841
[SPEAKER_06]: And, yeah, Lil' Poundcake.

1239
01:36:21,241 --> 01:36:23,742
[SPEAKER_06]: And somebody actually asked me in the show... Oh, no, it was you.

1240
01:36:23,762 --> 01:36:25,183
[SPEAKER_15]: It was me, because I was asking everybody.

1241
01:36:25,223 --> 01:36:27,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you're like, where did the inspiration for your name come from?

1242
01:36:27,945 --> 01:36:31,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there are, like, a diverse amount of... My favorite was Sprinkles Galore.

1243
01:36:31,647 --> 01:36:31,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1244
01:36:32,608 --> 01:36:33,588
[SPEAKER_15]: And Seymour Guylove.

1245
01:36:34,149 --> 01:36:35,990
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a character I saw called FapFap.

1246
01:36:36,851 --> 01:36:37,711
[SPEAKER_15]: I saw FapFap.

1247
01:36:38,292 --> 01:36:39,413
[SPEAKER_15]: And Captain Obvious.

1248
01:36:39,493 --> 01:36:40,693
[SPEAKER_07]: I bet you did, you dirty hoe.

1249
01:36:40,734 --> 01:36:41,294
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1250
01:36:41,474 --> 01:36:42,575
[SPEAKER_15]: I saw Captain Obvious.

1251
01:36:42,935 --> 01:36:43,155
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1252
01:36:43,475 --> 01:36:45,777
[SPEAKER_15]: And I also saw, what was the other one?

1253
01:36:45,797 --> 01:36:47,038
[SPEAKER_15]: I saw Ianto Jones.

1254
01:36:47,158 --> 01:36:48,559
[SPEAKER_15]: And I said, okay, Torchwood?

1255
01:36:48,579 --> 01:36:49,800
[SPEAKER_15]: And they're like, yeah, big Torchwood fans.

1256
01:36:49,820 --> 01:36:50,360
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, cool.

1257
01:36:50,901 --> 01:36:53,042
[SPEAKER_06]: But you were like, what's the inspiration for your name?

1258
01:36:53,082 --> 01:36:56,705
[SPEAKER_06]: And some are named after philosophers or an anime or whatever.

1259
01:36:56,725 --> 01:36:59,347
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, my name comes from RuPaul's Drag Race.

1260
01:37:02,054 --> 01:37:04,436
[SPEAKER_15]: I was actually super surprised that I got the names I got, though.

1261
01:37:05,057 --> 01:37:08,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, when there's first name and last name, it's much easier to get the names.

1262
01:37:08,120 --> 01:37:10,562
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, but I was going for specific Homestuck characters.

1263
01:37:10,983 --> 01:37:11,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1264
01:37:11,503 --> 01:37:13,545
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I was like, why not?

1265
01:37:13,605 --> 01:37:16,408
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I was making a cat girl and wanted to name her after one of the cat trolls.

1266
01:37:16,648 --> 01:37:22,054
[SPEAKER_06]: I was being asked in chat during the break at live.vognetwork.com by Sailor Venus, who's in our chat tonight.

1267
01:37:22,094 --> 01:37:22,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

1268
01:37:22,374 --> 01:37:22,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

1269
01:37:22,734 --> 01:37:23,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Sessy's the best

1270
01:37:43,263 --> 01:37:45,806
[SPEAKER_06]: I have ADD character at this point.

1271
01:37:45,886 --> 01:37:50,050
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to raid with my monk, so I guess that's my main.

1272
01:37:50,070 --> 01:37:50,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it Gordita?

1273
01:37:50,750 --> 01:37:51,831
[SPEAKER_06]: She would be the best geared.

1274
01:37:51,911 --> 01:37:52,772
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Kalmain.

1275
01:37:52,892 --> 01:37:53,293
[SPEAKER_13]: Kalmain.

1276
01:37:53,613 --> 01:37:54,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Was my monk.

1277
01:37:54,914 --> 01:37:56,456
[SPEAKER_06]: But I had my priest before that.

1278
01:37:56,576 --> 01:37:58,758
[SPEAKER_06]: I had Chakwas, my priest, who I raided with.

1279
01:37:59,178 --> 01:38:06,145
[SPEAKER_06]: I have Sassy on Alliance, who I did get to 90, and I did some five-mans with, and I've geared her that way, but I haven't really done any raids.

1280
01:38:06,625 --> 01:38:11,007
[SPEAKER_15]: I've got your Rissa close to being raid ready.

1281
01:38:11,307 --> 01:38:17,089
[SPEAKER_06]: See, the character I was playing the most two months ago was Chocolina, my hunter, who's PvP.

1282
01:38:17,309 --> 01:38:18,950
[SPEAKER_06]: I had my PvP phase.

1283
01:38:18,990 --> 01:38:21,011
[SPEAKER_15]: It's hard to PvP on a hunter, though.

1284
01:38:21,511 --> 01:38:22,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that was the fun of it!

1285
01:38:24,192 --> 01:38:24,552
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

1286
01:38:24,592 --> 01:38:26,813
[SPEAKER_15]: PvP is the whole reason why I never finish Children's Week.

1287
01:38:27,834 --> 01:38:28,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

1288
01:38:28,314 --> 01:38:30,115
[SPEAKER_06]: It can be... Stupid PvP bullshit.

1289
01:38:30,195 --> 01:38:32,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, if you're going to do PvP, just turn off chat.

1290
01:38:33,056 --> 01:38:33,917
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll make your life easier.

1291
01:38:34,577 --> 01:38:34,857
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1292
01:38:35,257 --> 01:38:41,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, we could talk MMOs all night, and I do on Wednesday nights on a show called Horde House, 7 o'clock Pacific.

1293
01:38:41,099 --> 01:38:41,720
[SPEAKER_15]: Pluggedy, pluggedy.

1294
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:43,600
[SPEAKER_15]: And for the record, I didn't get Nepeta.

1295
01:38:43,660 --> 01:38:44,221
[SPEAKER_15]: I got Mulan.

1296
01:38:46,198 --> 01:38:47,320
[SPEAKER_06]: What unique context.

1297
01:38:47,340 --> 01:38:50,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember how I talked about the podcast and Stitcher listeners earlier?

1298
01:38:50,644 --> 01:38:54,068
[SPEAKER_15]: Queen Simia in chat asked if I got Nepeta Lajon, which I didn't.

1299
01:38:54,088 --> 01:38:56,071
[SPEAKER_15]: I got Mulan, which is the one I wanted.

1300
01:38:56,251 --> 01:38:56,672
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

1301
01:38:56,872 --> 01:38:57,112
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1302
01:38:57,333 --> 01:38:59,295
[SPEAKER_15]: But Nepeta's cute, but I wanted Mulan.

1303
01:39:00,056 --> 01:39:04,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go into rapid fire news tonight and some other gaming news we're going to go over quickly.

1304
01:39:05,206 --> 01:39:05,586
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1305
01:39:06,186 --> 01:39:10,488
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's talk a little bit about discounts.

1306
01:39:11,888 --> 01:39:14,849
[SPEAKER_08]: The Vita is actually dropping in price, apparently.

1307
01:39:15,670 --> 01:39:16,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, it's not apparently.

1308
01:39:16,910 --> 01:39:17,690
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to happen.

1309
01:39:18,631 --> 01:39:19,731
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is something else.

1310
01:39:20,351 --> 01:39:23,853
[SPEAKER_08]: During Gamescom, I guess, they're probably going to make this announcement as well.

1311
01:39:24,373 --> 01:39:32,216
[SPEAKER_08]: But I guess the launch versions of the system, the 3G Vita launch bundle and also the Wi-Fi version are dropping down to $200.

1312
01:39:32,276 --> 01:39:32,356
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

1313
01:39:33,876 --> 01:40:01,079
[SPEAKER_08]: and also at the same time they're going to be dropping the price of the greatest hits games I guess for $15 a piece and that's for PlayStation 3 the other thing too which I don't think is on here and hasn't been announced yet that also includes new bundles that happen to be coming out the new starter bundles which you know there is one that happens to be coming out on Tuesday for The Walking Dead just saying so you can get those for $200 now

1314
01:40:02,140 --> 01:40:11,089
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, for $200, and this is allegedly a rumor, but it's not, there is a 12GB PlayStation 3 coming to North America.

1315
01:40:11,149 --> 01:40:12,050
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I know what you're thinking.

1316
01:40:12,451 --> 01:40:12,951
[SPEAKER_08]: 12GB?

1317
01:40:12,991 --> 01:40:13,892
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awfully small.

1318
01:40:14,333 --> 01:40:15,894
[SPEAKER_08]: That's flash storage that they have on there.

1319
01:40:15,974 --> 01:40:18,457
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you will be able to add a hard drive.

1320
01:40:19,277 --> 01:40:37,545
[SPEAKER_08]: to it as well so it's a good place if you want to if you're planning on adding your own hard drive anyways might as well not spend any more money than you have to and 12 gigabytes would be enough to install Grand Theft Auto 5 I'm just saying which is apparently all a person needs right that's really all a person needs yeah you know what you just need to talk to Dan because he's all kinds of happy about that game

1321
01:40:39,404 --> 01:40:41,565
[SPEAKER_08]: is going to encompass a lot of my time.

1322
01:40:41,845 --> 01:40:43,186
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all I'm saying.

1323
01:40:43,466 --> 01:40:45,907
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, Fantasia.

1324
01:40:46,067 --> 01:40:50,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Coming soon to VOG, the Grand Theft Auto 5 show, because it's all Loki's ever going to be able to talk about.

1325
01:40:50,409 --> 01:40:51,950
[SPEAKER_08]: They already have a Grand Theft Auto 5 show.

1326
01:40:52,290 --> 01:40:53,130
[SPEAKER_06]: My God, really?

1327
01:40:53,150 --> 01:40:54,791
[SPEAKER_08]: GTA 5 o'clock.

1328
01:40:54,811 --> 01:40:55,071
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

1329
01:40:55,111 --> 01:40:55,652
[SPEAKER_06]: That should surprise me.

1330
01:40:55,672 --> 01:40:57,132
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a UK show, and it's great.

1331
01:40:57,272 --> 01:40:57,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Good for them.

1332
01:40:57,712 --> 01:40:58,153
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.

1333
01:40:58,373 --> 01:40:59,293
[SPEAKER_08]: They are fantastic.

1334
01:40:59,333 --> 01:40:59,813
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.

1335
01:40:59,873 --> 01:41:06,416
[SPEAKER_08]: But hey, you know, since I will be spending most of my time online, I could probably guess Sun Hoard House.

1336
01:41:07,317 --> 01:41:07,417
Yeah.

1337
01:41:07,837 --> 01:41:08,618
[SPEAKER_06]: You sure could!

1338
01:41:09,619 --> 01:41:11,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Horde House was a Warcraft-only show, but now it isn't.

1339
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:12,561
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all online games.

1340
01:41:12,581 --> 01:41:15,703
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes, you could guest on Horde House to talk Grand Theft Auto V online.

1341
01:41:15,923 --> 01:41:17,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Lord knows none of us will be playing it.

1342
01:41:19,026 --> 01:41:21,247
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're really doing yourself a disservice.

1343
01:41:21,307 --> 01:41:21,768
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kidding.

1344
01:41:22,348 --> 01:41:23,689
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm super curious.

1345
01:41:23,769 --> 01:41:24,370
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway...

1346
01:41:24,970 --> 01:41:41,234
[SPEAKER_06]: it's not all about murdering people you can play golf and do yoga oh yay yoga oh man hey yoga is my favorite thing in Final Fantasy 14 I don't know about you and that golfing and warcraft that's the reason to plunk down the money right there you know what

1347
01:41:45,139 --> 01:41:48,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Fantasia Music Evolved, a new game coming from Harmonix.

1348
01:41:48,881 --> 01:41:58,665
[SPEAKER_08]: They also have some more original pieces coming to the game, including some works from Inan Zur.

1349
01:42:00,626 --> 01:42:03,447
[SPEAKER_08]: He did some music in Fallout 3.

1350
01:42:05,268 --> 01:42:18,977
[SPEAKER_08]: and he's going to be doing some original versions of different takes on Vivaldi, Four Seasons, Night on the Bald Mountain, and stuff like that.

1351
01:42:19,537 --> 01:42:24,620
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, I guess he's arranged the orchestral mix of Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody in the game.

1352
01:42:25,401 --> 01:42:26,401
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds interesting.

1353
01:42:27,322 --> 01:42:32,085
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, that's coming out sometime in 2014 on both Xbox platforms.

1354
01:42:34,147 --> 01:42:48,897
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is a little strange, but they have, I guess it's going to be one of those announcements at Gamescom, but PlayStation Vita Pets coming to the Vita.

1355
01:42:49,457 --> 01:42:52,279
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like Nintendogs, if the dogs talked.

1356
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:54,220
[SPEAKER_08]: They talk.

1357
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's that killer app that's going to sell a million betas.

1358
01:42:58,162 --> 01:43:00,624
[SPEAKER_08]: It's weird that they're talking.

1359
01:43:02,124 --> 01:43:03,385
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want you to talk.

1360
01:43:03,605 --> 01:43:04,166
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

1361
01:43:05,206 --> 01:43:16,273
[SPEAKER_08]: And they talk like that generic after school TV kids Disney show or something like that that's really annoying and grinding on your brain.

1362
01:43:16,613 --> 01:43:21,656
[SPEAKER_06]: It would really only be awesome if you could take your Playstation pets and import them into Tokyo Jungle.

1363
01:43:22,936 --> 01:43:23,957
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be awesome.

1364
01:43:24,057 --> 01:43:24,877
[SPEAKER_06]: That could be pretty cool.

1365
01:43:25,217 --> 01:43:25,477
[SPEAKER_06]: See?

1366
01:43:26,397 --> 01:43:27,738
[SPEAKER_06]: You and I need to start a game studio.

1367
01:43:28,458 --> 01:43:29,398
[SPEAKER_08]: Tokyo Jungle.

1368
01:43:29,418 --> 01:43:31,399
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura could come visit once in a while.

1369
01:43:31,759 --> 01:43:34,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Starts off like Nintendogs and then it gets really dark.

1370
01:43:36,641 --> 01:43:37,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that I like.

1371
01:43:37,881 --> 01:43:41,242
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like Battle Royale for dogs and cats.

1372
01:43:41,362 --> 01:43:44,684
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but then you talk pet cruelty and I'm like, no, we can't have that.

1373
01:43:44,704 --> 01:43:47,705
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, come on, you're the one who named your horse Politary and beat her.

1374
01:43:50,015 --> 01:43:51,115
[SPEAKER_15]: and Derby Owners Club

1375
01:44:14,203 --> 01:44:18,084
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as it's over the top, then that's fine.

1376
01:44:18,124 --> 01:44:20,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, I look at a game like, remember Bungie Ferret Tossing?

1377
01:44:21,225 --> 01:44:21,966
[SPEAKER_06]: That game's hilarious.

1378
01:44:21,986 --> 01:44:22,726
[SPEAKER_08]: That one's over the top.

1379
01:44:22,746 --> 01:44:29,788
[SPEAKER_08]: There's another game, and once again, the name is escaping me, that has, like, dogs with tank cannons on them.

1380
01:44:30,188 --> 01:44:39,451
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't remember what it's called, but it's something that... It's got a few games in the series, and it was on PlayStation 2 and stuff, but they had... It's, like, literally, they have, like...

1381
01:44:40,948 --> 01:44:41,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

1382
01:44:58,376 --> 01:45:23,879
[SPEAKER_15]: Thunderbluff was it was it there or was it somewhere closer to human lands where there were the metal saga by the way where there were the hamsters and the rabbits that would suddenly you know have knives oh yeah yeah yeah I just hung out there for hours just watching them because I was bored but anyway but like you follow one of them around and you can actually watch them transform but like there was the rabbit with combat knife and the hamster with the Uzi and

1383
01:45:24,159 --> 01:45:26,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, y'all and your animal fighting issues.

1384
01:45:26,881 --> 01:45:28,743
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, see, this is what I'm telling you.

1385
01:45:28,763 --> 01:45:29,323
[SPEAKER_06]: That was awesome.

1386
01:45:29,664 --> 01:45:31,365
[SPEAKER_06]: See, that's from Metal Saga right there.

1387
01:45:31,745 --> 01:45:32,686
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I have to play this.

1388
01:45:33,327 --> 01:45:33,967
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta move on.

1389
01:45:33,987 --> 01:45:35,549
[SPEAKER_15]: I want a Shiba Inu with a bazooka.

1390
01:45:36,610 --> 01:45:37,730
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on, moving on.

1391
01:45:38,351 --> 01:45:40,693
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what Call of Duty Ghost scenes right there.

1392
01:45:41,794 --> 01:45:43,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Dogs with giant bazookas.

1393
01:45:44,096 --> 01:45:50,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, I don't know how many of you guys have checked this out, but there's the Humble Origin bundle, which is available from the, yeah, the Humble bundle.

1394
01:45:50,962 --> 01:45:51,242
[SPEAKER_06]: I bought it.

1395
01:45:51,562 --> 01:45:52,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Dead Space 3 and Medal of Honor

1396
01:46:14,617 --> 01:46:15,538
[SPEAKER_06]: I do want to play Dead Space 3

1397
01:46:35,237 --> 01:46:37,920
[SPEAKER_06]: I've already got a bunch of those other games I took my pills

1398
01:46:52,202 --> 01:46:59,764
[SPEAKER_08]: See, I, on the other hand, I only... I paid the full amount, because I like Battlefield 3, but I just haven't played it yet.

1399
01:47:00,265 --> 01:47:01,265
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the idea of it.

1400
01:47:02,185 --> 01:47:11,488
[SPEAKER_08]: I just... I'm not installing Origin, though, but I... Mainly I paid more than the average, because they always add in extra games towards the end of the week.

1401
01:47:11,888 --> 01:47:13,229
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm curious to see what those are.

1402
01:47:13,469 --> 01:47:15,069
[SPEAKER_08]: And I wanted Mirror's Edge and Burnout.

1403
01:47:15,289 --> 01:47:16,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Burnout Paradise, dude!

1404
01:47:16,410 --> 01:47:16,730
[SPEAKER_08]: That is the...

1405
01:47:17,310 --> 01:47:17,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on.

1406
01:47:17,991 --> 01:47:23,554
[SPEAKER_08]: At least a dollar you can pay for one of the best racing games this generation.

1407
01:47:23,574 --> 01:47:25,335
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, the charities are great.

1408
01:47:25,616 --> 01:47:27,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you have human rights campaigns.

1409
01:47:27,537 --> 01:47:29,298
[SPEAKER_06]: You can just have all of your money go to that.

1410
01:47:29,818 --> 01:47:35,662
[SPEAKER_06]: American Cancer Society, San Francisco AIDS Foundation, American Red Cross, WOTC.

1411
01:47:35,722 --> 01:47:37,223
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, this is great.

1412
01:47:37,784 --> 01:47:38,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.

1413
01:47:38,744 --> 01:47:39,825
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

1414
01:47:39,905 --> 01:47:40,986
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's for charity.

1415
01:47:41,086 --> 01:47:46,409
[SPEAKER_06]: So, hate on Origin all you want, but it's pretty hard to get mad at this.

1416
01:47:46,550 --> 01:47:46,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Although,

1417
01:47:49,452 --> 01:47:50,852
[SPEAKER_14]: I've already got those three of those games.

1418
01:47:50,892 --> 01:47:53,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I'm just being the Grinch, but you have to wonder.

1419
01:47:53,374 --> 01:47:54,595
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to wonder.

1420
01:47:56,256 --> 01:47:58,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they just trying to get Origin put on more computers?

1421
01:47:58,538 --> 01:47:58,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

1422
01:47:59,238 --> 01:48:02,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, because then they're going to say, look how many people have Origin.

1423
01:48:02,640 --> 01:48:04,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Origin's a successful service.

1424
01:48:04,282 --> 01:48:05,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Look how many people have Origin.

1425
01:48:06,623 --> 01:48:12,227
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate going there because at the end of the day, this is a great thing, but it's just that you can't help but wonder.

1426
01:48:12,667 --> 01:48:13,768
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know people are talking about it.

1427
01:48:13,968 --> 01:48:17,392
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm super close to patching my Mass Effect 3 so I don't have to go through Origin.

1428
01:48:17,452 --> 01:48:23,578
[SPEAKER_08]: I almost bought the Deep Silver bundle, but the problem is I bought the THQ bundle and that had a lot of the games that were in the Deep Silver bundle.

1429
01:48:23,598 --> 01:48:24,259
[SPEAKER_08]: That's very true.

1430
01:48:24,799 --> 01:48:29,664
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I was like, eh, I just can't see myself buying yet another copy of Saints Row the 3rd.

1431
01:48:30,779 --> 01:48:35,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Brad from PodCulture says, with these bundles, I always put all my fundage towards the charities.

1432
01:48:35,442 --> 01:48:36,703
[SPEAKER_06]: That's at live.vognetwork.com.

1433
01:48:36,723 --> 01:48:38,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you can decide how your money is split.

1434
01:48:38,824 --> 01:48:46,068
[SPEAKER_06]: The cool thing about this one is that since EA is not getting any of the money, usually the indie developers, you can give them a chunk of the pot and by default they get some.

1435
01:48:46,388 --> 01:48:51,451
[SPEAKER_06]: But this time, it's all charities and what they call the humble bundle tip.

1436
01:48:51,691 --> 01:48:51,871
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1437
01:48:51,891 --> 01:48:51,971
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1438
01:48:52,725 --> 01:48:53,125
[SPEAKER_06]: StarCraft MMO

1439
01:49:14,119 --> 01:49:35,516
[SPEAKER_06]: StarCraft Universe which was originally World of StarCraft it will allow players to create a character and log in to an alternate history StarCraft the Zerg and Protoss hybrids are around I guess Blizzard does bless this project now so StarCraft Universe they can make this in the StarCraft 2 engine it just can't be called World of StarCraft that was the deal I remember they changed something

1440
01:49:36,377 --> 01:49:39,760
[SPEAKER_06]: So they won $80,000 that they're getting on Kickstarter, and here's why.

1441
01:49:40,741 --> 01:49:55,075
[SPEAKER_06]: This is for the creator Ryan Winsen and the people he's working with to get additional pylons and focus solely on creating the game and getting it out there in 2014 for an open beta, which I'm assuming means I want to be able to quit my job and do this full-time and actually get it out in a timely manner.

1442
01:49:55,716 --> 01:49:56,897
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm reading.

1443
01:49:56,937 --> 01:49:57,758
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds about right, yeah.

1444
01:49:58,078 --> 01:50:22,414
[SPEAKER_06]: There are stretch goals and other rewards Zerg character class if they make $100,000 And so on and so on Let me see where they're at right now Just kind of curious for an update here on this Sunday evening They've got 22 days to go and they've almost made half their money They're at $36,000 So not bad They're ahead of the curve a little bit if they can keep that going Although I think most Kickstarters you want the earlier the better So good luck

1445
01:50:24,895 --> 01:50:31,078
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm surprised Blizzard's kind of letting them do that because aren't they raising money based off of StarCraft IP in a way?

1446
01:50:31,958 --> 01:50:34,479
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure they've got some kind of deal worked out.

1447
01:50:34,579 --> 01:50:34,960
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess.

1448
01:50:35,180 --> 01:50:37,561
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess at the end of the day, it's all promo for StarCraft too.

1449
01:50:37,721 --> 01:50:37,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1450
01:50:38,341 --> 01:50:39,322
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1451
01:50:39,682 --> 01:50:45,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, speaking of Blizzard, another beta that launched this weekend that has a lot of people's attention is Hearthstone.

1452
01:50:46,345 --> 01:50:47,725
[SPEAKER_06]: The Hearthstone closed beta.

1453
01:50:47,765 --> 01:50:50,867
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Blizzard's free-to-play little card game that they've got.

1454
01:50:51,227 --> 01:50:54,028
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1455
01:51:13,895 --> 01:51:27,551
[SPEAKER_06]: I do think it's very interesting timing on Blizzard's part, and I don't think it's any coincidence at all that the Hearthstone beta started out of nowhere this weekend, when a lot of World of Warcraft and hardcore Blizzard fans I think were a little bored waiting for patch 5.4, and eh, let me go...

1456
01:51:29,033 --> 01:51:33,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me go try this other open beta that's going on right now.

1457
01:51:33,277 --> 01:51:35,138
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go try this Final Fantasy XIV.

1458
01:51:35,559 --> 01:51:43,486
[SPEAKER_06]: So Blizzard releases this to their most vocal people and the people that are some heavy influences to the community and so forth.

1459
01:51:43,826 --> 01:51:46,909
[SPEAKER_06]: And suddenly, none of them care about Final Fantasy XIV anymore.

1460
01:51:46,929 --> 01:51:48,130
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all playing this.

1461
01:51:49,411 --> 01:51:52,694
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a smart move on Blizzard's part, but I will say this.

1462
01:51:53,734 --> 01:51:56,455
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll expand a little bit on this on Horde House, but I can't help myself.

1463
01:51:56,475 --> 01:51:57,336
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to say something now.

1464
01:51:58,116 --> 01:52:02,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Because of this, I've seen some people shading Final Fantasy XIV a little bit.

1465
01:52:02,438 --> 01:52:05,199
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm just going to say, don't shade a game you haven't played.

1466
01:52:05,479 --> 01:52:06,279
[SPEAKER_06]: That's ignorant.

1467
01:52:06,899 --> 01:52:10,981
[SPEAKER_06]: One of these is a free-to-play trading card game that's going to be on tablets.

1468
01:52:11,401 --> 01:52:15,743
[SPEAKER_06]: The other one of these is a very intricate MMO that's going to be on PlayStation 3.

1469
01:52:16,543 --> 01:52:19,124
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not alike in any way, shape, or form.

1470
01:52:19,485 --> 01:52:19,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh?

1471
01:52:19,965 --> 01:52:20,205
[SPEAKER_15]: NPC.

1472
01:52:21,105 --> 01:52:21,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and PC.

1473
01:52:22,645 --> 01:52:24,906
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you so threatened by, y'all?

1474
01:52:25,746 --> 01:52:26,826
[SPEAKER_06]: What's so threatening?

1475
01:52:27,526 --> 01:52:27,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

1476
01:52:27,906 --> 01:52:28,846
[SPEAKER_15]: Because people like to be right.

1477
01:52:29,687 --> 01:52:31,747
[SPEAKER_15]: And people like their thing to be better.

1478
01:52:32,087 --> 01:52:36,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and that's kind of like blind fandom, and it's a little bit ridiculous, people.

1479
01:52:36,768 --> 01:52:37,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.

1480
01:52:38,088 --> 01:52:38,588
[SPEAKER_06]: So, anyway.

1481
01:52:38,648 --> 01:52:40,388
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to give you all a piece of advice.

1482
01:52:41,229 --> 01:52:46,709
[SPEAKER_06]: You can like item A and also like item B. I can like Lady Gaga and Katy Perry?

1483
01:52:47,110 --> 01:52:47,430
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1484
01:52:47,590 --> 01:52:49,630
[SPEAKER_15]: I can like Supernatural and Doctor Who.

1485
01:52:49,650 --> 01:52:49,690
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

1486
01:52:49,810 --> 01:52:50,090
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

1487
01:52:50,230 --> 01:52:52,951
[SPEAKER_15]: I can like the current Doctor Who and the classic Doctor Who.

1488
01:52:52,991 --> 01:52:53,351
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

1489
01:52:53,791 --> 01:52:55,471
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, right?

1490
01:52:55,551 --> 01:52:56,051
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1491
01:52:57,991 --> 01:52:58,232
[SPEAKER_15]: Rob.

1492
01:52:58,592 --> 01:52:58,792
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1493
01:52:59,032 --> 01:53:01,332
[SPEAKER_15]: I can play Dragon Age 2 and the Mass Effect series.

1494
01:53:01,912 --> 01:53:03,773
[SPEAKER_15]: PlayStation and Xbox?

1495
01:53:04,813 --> 01:53:08,613
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you have to... Loki, that's just cross... You have to buy one or the other.

1496
01:53:08,653 --> 01:53:09,354
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, guess what?

1497
01:53:09,934 --> 01:53:11,034
[SPEAKER_15]: I have both and a Wii.

1498
01:53:15,075 --> 01:53:15,915
[SPEAKER_06]: My God, people.

1499
01:53:16,755 --> 01:53:17,035
[SPEAKER_15]: I know.

1500
01:53:18,635 --> 01:53:20,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Cats and Dogs, Living Together, Mass Hysteria.

1501
01:53:21,978 --> 01:53:22,819
[SPEAKER_12]: I love that line.

1502
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:28,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, I look forward to playing this beta at some point whenever I get my little access.

1503
01:53:28,925 --> 01:53:31,148
[SPEAKER_15]: By the way, I do have to make a little tangent.

1504
01:53:31,168 --> 01:53:35,832
[SPEAKER_15]: I forgot to mention I was playing Dragon Age 2 because I actually stopped Final Fantasy XIV to play Dragon Age 2.

1505
01:53:36,733 --> 01:53:42,259
[SPEAKER_15]: I totally missed one part where I could start the romance with Fenris, so I totally cheated.

1506
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:49,104
[SPEAKER_15]: and did the debug mode so I could just change all the romance options.

1507
01:53:49,585 --> 01:53:51,887
[SPEAKER_15]: And Becky's husband said, so you gave him roofies?

1508
01:53:52,808 --> 01:53:54,589
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, okay, that's pretty funny.

1509
01:53:55,250 --> 01:53:57,772
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, DarkSakura, you have some rapid fire news for us.

1510
01:53:58,368 --> 01:54:03,490
[SPEAKER_15]: I do, and one of them is about Shin Megami Tensei, if I can actually get to Safari.

1511
01:54:04,630 --> 01:54:06,851
[SPEAKER_15]: There is a UK release date.

1512
01:54:07,011 --> 01:54:12,933
[SPEAKER_15]: It is going to be, that's actually Shin Megami Tensei, Devil Summoner, Soul Hackers.

1513
01:54:13,413 --> 01:54:19,396
[SPEAKER_15]: The European release date is going to be on September, moved from September 13th to September 20th.

1514
01:54:20,796 --> 01:54:28,102
[SPEAKER_15]: and it's going to be available digitally on the 3DS eShop on the following week on the 25th of September.

1515
01:54:28,763 --> 01:54:31,125
[SPEAKER_15]: So that is the official release date for that.

1516
01:54:31,365 --> 01:54:32,286
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry guys in the UK.

1517
01:54:33,587 --> 01:54:37,690
[SPEAKER_15]: We also have a date for Castle of Illusion Remaster in the UK.

1518
01:54:37,730 --> 01:54:39,812
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to be September 4th and it will be £10.

1519
01:54:39,852 --> 01:54:39,892
[SPEAKER_15]: So...

1520
01:54:42,114 --> 01:54:42,955
[SPEAKER_15]: Castlevania, Mirror of Fate HD

1521
01:54:57,242 --> 01:55:24,752
[SPEAKER_15]: it has a list date that's on PlayAsia and it says it's going to be for PS3 and Xbox 360 and saying that the collection will have the first Lords of Shadow, all the DLC and an exclusive demo of Lords of Shadow 2 and will be out in October yeah it's going to be part of the Lords of Shadow collection since Lords of Shadow 2 got delayed to next year

1522
01:55:25,385 --> 01:55:32,630
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, Brazil's games rating board had, for December 2012, I'm sorry.

1523
01:55:34,832 --> 01:55:40,036
[SPEAKER_15]: In December 2012, Mirror of Fate was on the Brazil rating board.

1524
01:55:40,876 --> 01:55:46,741
[SPEAKER_15]: And they're also saying that there's going to be a PC and Wii U one, but there's nothing listed on PlayAsia.

1525
01:55:47,221 --> 01:55:49,763
[SPEAKER_15]: So, that's it.

1526
01:55:50,584 --> 01:55:50,964
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1527
01:55:52,034 --> 01:55:56,039
[SPEAKER_08]: It's sad that actually that's like almost the only game.

1528
01:55:56,119 --> 01:55:58,782
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, Konami has hardly any games coming out.

1529
01:55:59,283 --> 01:56:01,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Pro Evo and this.

1530
01:56:01,505 --> 01:56:03,207
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's it.

1531
01:56:03,508 --> 01:56:05,750
[SPEAKER_08]: And then next year... Metal Gear Solid 5.

1532
01:56:06,011 --> 01:56:06,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Phantom Pain, right?

1533
01:56:06,912 --> 01:56:07,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Metal Gear Solid 5.

1534
01:56:07,853 --> 01:56:12,138
[SPEAKER_08]: But I mean, shit, they're releasing stuff less often than Capcom is nowadays.

1535
01:56:12,366 --> 01:56:14,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't they have a lot of kiddie stuff though?

1536
01:56:14,509 --> 01:56:15,450
[SPEAKER_08]: They're all mobile now.

1537
01:56:16,851 --> 01:56:18,734
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't have a lot of kiddie licenses anymore.

1538
01:56:18,854 --> 01:56:19,815
[SPEAKER_08]: No DDR anymore.

1539
01:56:21,017 --> 01:56:23,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Not even Karaoke Revolution anymore.

1540
01:56:25,041 --> 01:56:26,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get to the Fugle Question of the Week.

1541
01:56:34,838 --> 01:56:38,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Every week we ask our Facebook and our Google Plus communities a question.

1542
01:56:38,021 --> 01:56:41,424
[SPEAKER_06]: You take those two words, you slam them together, you get... Google!

1543
01:56:42,545 --> 01:56:43,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the question.

1544
01:56:43,345 --> 01:56:47,969
[SPEAKER_06]: There's rumors out there that Sony is making some moves to launch an online TV service on the PlayStation 4.

1545
01:56:48,570 --> 01:56:51,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Certainly similar TV integrative features are a part of the Xbox One as well.

1546
01:56:51,892 --> 01:56:55,235
[SPEAKER_06]: How important is the integration of television into your video game console?

1547
01:56:55,676 --> 01:56:57,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this sort of service something you are interested in?

1548
01:56:58,138 --> 01:57:02,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Or do you think Sony and Microsoft should focus less on these online TV networks and more on the games?

1549
01:57:03,963 --> 01:57:05,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Redertainment on Google Plus says,

1550
01:57:27,345 --> 01:57:28,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft says, E3VL says, E3VL says,

1551
01:57:52,621 --> 01:58:13,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Joe C says I live in the UK so it's probably of no consequence to me as these services are non-existent severely limited over here I don't like too many services competing with each other though I don't want to subscribe to them all so I always feel as though I'm missing out that's a good point like sometimes you have to feel like you have to do Hulu and Netflix and you know everybody wants a little piece of that

1552
01:58:13,877 --> 01:58:15,519
[SPEAKER_06]: and Techie Q says, bring it on.

1553
01:58:15,779 --> 01:58:20,063
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a small but big step into breaking the traditional TV cable model.

1554
01:58:20,623 --> 01:58:22,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are the answers on Google+.

1555
01:58:22,144 --> 01:58:28,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them, I had to shorten them all because I want to try to get in a lot of people tonight and we still have a lot more answers here over on Facebook.

1556
01:58:28,550 --> 01:58:30,051
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to try to shorten some of these.

1557
01:58:30,492 --> 01:58:40,601
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm sorry if I don't read your full answer, but I'm going to encourage everybody to go over to facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and our Google Plus page, Orange Lounge Radio and read the full answers themselves.

1558
01:58:41,221 --> 01:58:48,425
[SPEAKER_06]: CriticalMyth says it's not that important to me given that I have several other options currently that I'm very comfortable with.

1559
01:58:49,366 --> 01:58:56,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Renee, our friend from Koopa Club says you know it's not really that important to me to have my television services integrated into my video game console.

1560
01:58:57,110 --> 01:59:05,075
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand the concept of wanting to encapsulate everything into one unit or box if you will to just have one place to go for all your entertainment needs.

1561
01:59:05,855 --> 01:59:09,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Lauren Z says, what if we had a gaming console that actually focused on gaming?

1562
01:59:09,839 --> 01:59:11,560
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I know, it's an odd concept, but just think about it.

1563
01:59:11,681 --> 01:59:12,421
[SPEAKER_06]: It could work, right?

1564
01:59:12,982 --> 01:59:13,242
[SPEAKER_06]: No?

1565
01:59:13,622 --> 01:59:14,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1566
01:59:14,823 --> 01:59:24,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Ragenator says, if this was a year or two ago, I would have said it is very important, but nowadays I'd probably say that it's not at all important.

1567
01:59:25,833 --> 01:59:30,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Shane says, they already do that stuff for me as they all play Hulu and Netflix.

1568
01:59:30,677 --> 01:59:32,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Cable TV is for chumps.

1569
01:59:34,752 --> 01:59:38,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Patty E says, I get a gaming system for games.

1570
01:59:38,473 --> 01:59:46,336
[SPEAKER_06]: I enjoy the fact that I can stream video from something like Netflix or Hulu or directly from my computer, but that does not at all contribute to why I want the system.

1571
01:59:47,756 --> 01:59:54,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Marcello L says, all these TV features are nice, but really, I buy a PlayStation 4 or Xbox One for games.

1572
01:59:55,219 --> 01:59:59,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, if the games had a feature that tied to the channel you're watching or show, that would be interesting.

1573
01:59:59,780 --> 02:00:00,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Still not buying an Xbox One.

1574
02:00:01,961 --> 02:00:30,383
[SPEAKER_06]: uh Daniel S says I don't watch TV so this won't really affect me I mean the wife will use it so whatever I just find it funny because if this is true Sony will get compliments for adding on to their system but when Microsoft makes changes to be more like Sony they get slammed the console war is a fun show so kind of bringing up a point that was brought up by a chatter earlier uh Mason D says I think they need to spend more time making use of the peripherals that they put out think of if Yu-Gi-Oh with the PlayStation Eye that's Mason says you know Sony stop putting out all this shit and then not supporting it

1575
02:00:31,195 --> 02:00:31,595
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

1576
02:00:33,116 --> 02:00:34,938
[SPEAKER_06]: For the Fallen Dreams answers and says,

1577
02:00:57,614 --> 02:01:05,000
[SPEAKER_06]: That's definitely an audience I'm sure these TV things are going for, is people that are using their PlayStation 3 as their Blu-ray device.

1578
02:01:05,540 --> 02:01:07,622
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I'm sure there's a lot of people like that.

1579
02:01:08,342 --> 02:01:08,603
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100Matt says...

1580
02:01:19,851 --> 02:01:40,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Gally89 says it makes no difference to me as I don't have cable I would be interested in an a la carte service though Geeklet says it's always handy but I don't think it's really a decision maker I'm fine with a console just playing games and lastly Mike B says the future is no TV as we know it only on demand and pay for what you want to watch without commercials

1581
02:01:42,065 --> 02:01:49,991
[SPEAKER_06]: you know what those quickly those are some abbreviated comments from Facebook and Google Plus check out the full answers on those respective pages yes Jamie

1582
02:01:50,307 --> 02:01:54,449
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just saying, a lot of people are repeating pretty much what's already going on in a lot of homes.

1583
02:01:54,489 --> 02:01:55,550
[SPEAKER_15]: It definitely goes on in mine.

1584
02:01:56,070 --> 02:01:57,891
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a computer hooked up to our TV.

1585
02:01:58,331 --> 02:02:01,353
[SPEAKER_15]: So anything that we want to watch, it's either stuff we've downloaded.

1586
02:02:01,833 --> 02:02:05,295
[SPEAKER_15]: We use Hulu Plus and we have Netflix.

1587
02:02:05,936 --> 02:02:07,396
[SPEAKER_15]: Anything that we want to watch, it's all there.

1588
02:02:07,757 --> 02:02:11,259
[SPEAKER_15]: Becky got rid of her cable so that she could use Amazon Prime.

1589
02:02:12,059 --> 02:02:13,580
[SPEAKER_15]: She's really been happy with Amazon Prime.

1590
02:02:13,600 --> 02:02:14,981
[SPEAKER_15]: She gets shows for Julia in that way.

1591
02:02:15,581 --> 02:02:16,982
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm just saying, it's really...

1592
02:02:17,862 --> 02:02:18,303
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1593
02:02:29,145 --> 02:02:38,413
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, you know, as much as, you know, Mike B kind of took us out there with the whole there's only going to be on demand, you know, my mind kind of goes there, but I actually don't think that's true.

1594
02:02:39,014 --> 02:02:45,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, yes, I think a lot of TV as we know it today will go that way and a lot of the expanded cable channels and so forth.

1595
02:02:45,980 --> 02:02:49,864
[SPEAKER_06]: But keep in mind, there's one thing that on demand can't do, and that's live.

1596
02:02:50,504 --> 02:02:51,385
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1597
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:11,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, things like American Idol, which whether you watch it or not, it's still a very highly rated show.

1598
02:03:11,483 --> 02:03:14,324
[SPEAKER_06]: And all those talent shows, you know, The Voice and things, those are still live shows.

1599
02:03:14,724 --> 02:03:23,708
[SPEAKER_06]: I think in a way, broadcast TV may experience a bit of a renaissance where it goes back to, in the beginning of television, it was all live stuff.

1600
02:03:23,948 --> 02:03:24,809
[SPEAKER_15]: LiveStream Radio

1601
02:03:40,849 --> 02:03:45,653
[SPEAKER_15]: I caught all kinds of new music just by listening to Radio 4.

1602
02:03:45,693 --> 02:03:47,855
[SPEAKER_06]: VOG Network is the only radio you need.

1603
02:03:50,598 --> 02:03:53,740
[SPEAKER_15]: How about all the crap that went down in Texas?

1604
02:03:54,741 --> 02:03:59,766
[SPEAKER_15]: We had live streaming going on from the assembly room.

1605
02:04:00,495 --> 02:04:04,598
[SPEAKER_15]: We had the freaking internet catch the Texas Assembly breaking the law.

1606
02:04:04,978 --> 02:04:05,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, yeah.

1607
02:04:05,918 --> 02:04:06,299
[SPEAKER_15]: Live.

1608
02:04:06,799 --> 02:04:10,021
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I watched the whole... I was like, where's my popcorn?

1609
02:04:10,081 --> 02:04:10,861
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just watching this.

1610
02:04:11,382 --> 02:04:20,928
[SPEAKER_15]: But, I mean, news in and of itself, you've got your people who are still going to listen to your biased sources, you know, like your Fox News or your CNN or all of that, you know.

1611
02:04:21,528 --> 02:04:32,031
[SPEAKER_15]: But you also have a great deal more people who are looking outside of those sources who are probably getting pretty fed up with having their world events spoon-fed to them and want to actually see what's going on.

1612
02:04:32,071 --> 02:04:33,371
[SPEAKER_15]: They're looking to those other sources.

1613
02:04:33,912 --> 02:04:37,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Another good catch from our chat room, something that you couldn't get on demand.

1614
02:04:37,673 --> 02:04:42,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Jim Sally in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says, Sports need to be live.

1615
02:04:42,274 --> 02:04:45,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Football and baseball will keep traditional TV around forever.

1616
02:04:45,655 --> 02:04:48,817
[SPEAKER_15]: ESPN is going to go to a subscription service.

1617
02:04:48,917 --> 02:04:52,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they kind of have subscription services like the NFL Direct and all that and the NHL.

1618
02:04:53,139 --> 02:04:54,960
[SPEAKER_15]: That's probably what they're going to go towards.

1619
02:04:56,381 --> 02:04:56,781
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see.

1620
02:04:57,322 --> 02:04:58,242
[SPEAKER_15]: You want your ESPN?

1621
02:04:58,262 --> 02:05:03,045
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you have the ESPN streaming service where you pay X amount and you get all the sports you want.

1622
02:05:03,445 --> 02:05:08,608
[SPEAKER_15]: You can get so many sports as you start sprouting the colors of your favorite team out of your skin or something.

1623
02:05:10,269 --> 02:05:11,550
[SPEAKER_15]: You turn into a buccaneer.

1624
02:05:11,690 --> 02:05:16,393
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we're going to move on from our fugal question of the week, but good answers, you guys.

1625
02:05:16,853 --> 02:05:17,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Good answers.

1626
02:05:17,653 --> 02:05:22,296
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's get back into the news, and I know Loki's been dying to talk about this next story all night long.

1627
02:05:22,856 --> 02:05:24,037
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, I was.

1628
02:05:24,637 --> 02:05:33,542
[SPEAKER_08]: And yes, Grand Theft Auto V finally had their big unveil of their online portion of the game.

1629
02:05:33,582 --> 02:05:38,845
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually going to be called Grand Theft Auto Online, and it's all sorts of awesome stuff.

1630
02:05:39,366 --> 02:05:43,991
[SPEAKER_08]: What's interesting though is it's actually kind of its own separate thing.

1631
02:05:44,251 --> 02:05:53,461
[SPEAKER_08]: It launches October 1st if you buy a copy of Grand Theft Auto V and thankfully they're doing that because it gives me two weeks to play the game before I have to worry about trying to

1632
02:05:54,302 --> 02:06:22,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Hogg online but you get to create your own character you earn money in the game and you can customize your character you can buy property in the game you can insure your cars you can buy cars it's so deep as far as the you know the detail in the game they have it where you can play the stock market for example you can invest money in a car company and you go and destroy those cars out in the street and then they have to make more cars and therefore your stock goes up you know kind of stuff like that

1633
02:06:22,532 --> 02:06:23,093
[SPEAKER_08]: Deathmatch GTA 5 O'Clock

1634
02:06:42,193 --> 02:06:45,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically saying, well, first off, it's GTA Online.

1635
02:06:45,356 --> 02:06:52,462
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not actually part of Grand Theft Auto V, although it's going to start off with San Andreas, but it will expand beyond that.

1636
02:06:52,882 --> 02:06:59,868
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're planning on adding more area other than Los Santos and San Andreas to play in.

1637
02:07:01,270 --> 02:07:04,212
[SPEAKER_08]: Also saying that, you know, there's...

1638
02:07:05,713 --> 02:07:06,774
[SPEAKER_08]: Voice chat.

1639
02:07:07,074 --> 02:07:08,354
[SPEAKER_08]: You can actually talk in the game.

1640
02:07:08,574 --> 02:07:15,056
[SPEAKER_08]: Your character will move its mouth matching your dialogue.

1641
02:07:15,076 --> 02:07:15,757
[SPEAKER_08]: It will lip sync.

1642
02:07:16,157 --> 02:07:19,878
[SPEAKER_08]: And the AI characters in the game will react to the urgency in your voice.

1643
02:07:21,119 --> 02:07:21,939
[SPEAKER_08]: So like you said...

1644
02:07:22,739 --> 02:07:23,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Get on the fucking floor!

1645
02:07:24,020 --> 02:07:25,041
[SPEAKER_08]: They will get on the fucking floor.

1646
02:07:25,061 --> 02:07:26,121
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, that type of shit.

1647
02:07:26,261 --> 02:07:29,344
[SPEAKER_14]: But if you go get on the floor... Get on the floor!

1648
02:07:29,804 --> 02:07:30,764
[SPEAKER_08]: Then they'll start dancing.

1649
02:07:30,785 --> 02:07:31,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, exactly.

1650
02:07:31,505 --> 02:07:32,806
[SPEAKER_08]: Or they'll strip.

1651
02:07:34,067 --> 02:07:36,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Get on the floor now.

1652
02:07:37,449 --> 02:07:40,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, lots of interesting stuff in there.

1653
02:07:40,791 --> 02:07:41,452
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little different.

1654
02:07:41,472 --> 02:07:45,795
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not necessarily an MMO because you can play up to 16 players in there at a time.

1655
02:07:46,255 --> 02:07:47,977
[SPEAKER_08]: But you can play with other people.

1656
02:07:48,177 --> 02:07:50,319
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can play with your friends and stuff like that.

1657
02:07:50,459 --> 02:07:52,001
[SPEAKER_08]: You invite random people in there.

1658
02:07:52,021 --> 02:07:54,563
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's mediocre, but massive?

1659
02:07:54,903 --> 02:07:56,565
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be pretty massive, I think.

1660
02:07:56,945 --> 02:08:01,089
[SPEAKER_08]: And plus, you know, they're saying that there's also... This is cool.

1661
02:08:01,730 --> 02:08:03,392
[SPEAKER_08]: There's sort of like a spectator mode in it.

1662
02:08:03,492 --> 02:08:15,905
[SPEAKER_08]: For example, if your friends have a high wanted level or whatever, and they're getting chased down by the police, you can sit back in your apartment and watch on the TV, and it'll show it like a newscast, watching your friends getting chased by the police.

1663
02:08:16,265 --> 02:08:17,106
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty sweet.

1664
02:08:18,027 --> 02:08:21,050
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you get in a white Bronco and drive away, I can watch it on the TV?

1665
02:08:21,090 --> 02:08:21,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, you can do that.

1666
02:08:21,731 --> 02:08:22,572
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.

1667
02:08:23,152 --> 02:08:23,352
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

1668
02:08:25,669 --> 02:08:41,480
[SPEAKER_08]: What's also cool, though, is you can jump straight into your multiplayer by... They've got the characters selected on the bottom of the screen that you use your directional pad for, and one of those characters that will unlock in there, there'll be a countdown until it gets to October 1st, is your multiplayer character.

1669
02:08:41,500 --> 02:08:43,621
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can actually jump into multiplayer that quickly.

1670
02:08:45,442 --> 02:08:45,782
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1671
02:08:46,003 --> 02:08:52,427
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I'm just going to be spending a whole lot of time in this game because I've been looking forward to this since Grand Theft Auto 4 came out.

1672
02:08:52,967 --> 02:08:56,549
[SPEAKER_06]: And you've literally said, you know, I don't think I'm getting the new consoles.

1673
02:08:56,849 --> 02:09:00,731
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not getting Final Fantasy XIV because my life will get eaten up by this.

1674
02:09:01,132 --> 02:09:02,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, and that's the thing.

1675
02:09:02,452 --> 02:09:07,515
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, I see myself playing a lot more of this than, say, Killzone or something.

1676
02:09:07,535 --> 02:09:12,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, like, if I get a console, of course I'm going to check out, you know, a game with and stuff, but...

1677
02:09:13,888 --> 02:09:14,809
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1678
02:09:37,701 --> 02:09:41,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Just, you know, I'm probably going to dedicate most of my time to this.

1679
02:09:41,622 --> 02:09:43,363
[SPEAKER_08]: And like, even like Call of Duty and stuff.

1680
02:09:43,403 --> 02:09:45,444
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, you know, Call of Duty is kind of pretty awesome.

1681
02:09:45,484 --> 02:09:53,207
[SPEAKER_08]: I may get that just because we don't have anything to play at work because you can't really play online at work because our firewalls shit and we don't have a lot of bandwidth.

1682
02:09:53,267 --> 02:09:54,268
[SPEAKER_08]: But, um,

1683
02:09:56,820 --> 02:10:01,585
[SPEAKER_08]: If it wasn't for that, if we had access to live and stuff, I probably wouldn't get Call of Duty either.

1684
02:10:01,985 --> 02:10:04,347
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still not sure if I will get Call of Duty.

1685
02:10:04,467 --> 02:10:08,291
[SPEAKER_08]: I probably will get Call of Duty.

1686
02:10:08,431 --> 02:10:13,516
[SPEAKER_08]: At home, I'm going to be playing mainly Grand Theft Auto V. You know what I was just thinking?

1687
02:10:14,417 --> 02:10:19,001
[SPEAKER_14]: With that lip syncing thing, we are going to have a ton of machinima.

1688
02:10:20,267 --> 02:10:20,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Bang, bang, bang, bang

1689
02:10:42,694 --> 02:10:43,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Grenade!

1690
02:10:43,354 --> 02:10:43,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Grenade!

1691
02:10:44,595 --> 02:10:45,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Why do you need Kinect for that?

1692
02:10:45,996 --> 02:10:47,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I know, because you have to still Kinect.

1693
02:10:47,737 --> 02:10:48,898
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to make a reason for it.

1694
02:10:49,658 --> 02:10:49,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

1695
02:10:50,519 --> 02:10:55,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, more Xbox One confirmations and so forth coming out this week.

1696
02:10:55,762 --> 02:11:09,890
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing that was coming out from General Manager of Console Development, Leo Del Castillo, in an interview with Gizmodo, said that the Xbox One will automatically detect if it's overheating and will make adjustments to cool itself down.

1697
02:11:10,911 --> 02:11:13,233
[SPEAKER_06]: This is, I guess, something that also happens with PCs.

1698
02:11:14,093 --> 02:11:19,938
[SPEAKER_06]: They can dial back the power of the box considerably, forcing the system into a low-power state to correct any issues.

1699
02:11:21,219 --> 02:11:28,245
[SPEAKER_06]: So the way they designed the box, they don't want to actually intend it to ever have to go to maximum speed under normal environmental conditions, but there is overhead.

1700
02:11:28,606 --> 02:11:34,631
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll allow the fan to go all the way up to its maximum speed, and if that solves the condition without the user having to do anything.

1701
02:11:35,211 --> 02:11:47,545
[SPEAKER_06]: My assumption is that is to curb the three light special that affected most 360s because the system was overheating, which granted they corrected later on, which I thought was through a method similar to this.

1702
02:11:47,685 --> 02:11:49,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe Loki knows more about that.

1703
02:11:49,247 --> 02:11:49,647
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1704
02:11:50,188 --> 02:11:50,568
[SPEAKER_08]: But, um...

1705
02:11:51,229 --> 02:11:56,738
[SPEAKER_08]: They had a thing on the... Well, it was when it got really hot that that fan would kick up to 100%.

1706
02:11:57,920 --> 02:12:03,529
[SPEAKER_08]: So they did have something like that, but usually at that point it's like, eh, your system's kind of toasty right now.

1707
02:12:03,549 --> 02:12:04,310
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

1708
02:12:07,529 --> 02:12:07,869
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1709
02:12:07,949 --> 02:12:13,173
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not new, but the whole throttling the voltage down and actually clocking the system down is kind of new.

1710
02:12:15,375 --> 02:12:18,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Once again, it just reads as though they're talking.

1711
02:12:18,477 --> 02:12:23,200
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, okay, we've got to tell someone, but let people know that it's not going to red ring.

1712
02:12:23,260 --> 02:12:26,002
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, even though their systems haven't been red ringing since like...

1713
02:12:27,063 --> 02:12:27,404
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura

1714
02:12:49,528 --> 02:12:50,588
[SPEAKER_15]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1715
02:13:10,928 --> 02:13:20,354
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was originally made for the 70 FPS, which was basically creators making a first-person shooter in seven days.

1716
02:13:21,115 --> 02:13:24,737
[SPEAKER_15]: And this one, basically, you have to collect yellow orbs that are dropped by dead zombies.

1717
02:13:25,518 --> 02:13:29,521
[SPEAKER_15]: And the only way you get guns and ambos is to kill dead cops.

1718
02:13:29,701 --> 02:13:31,542
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I mean, is to get them from dead cops.

1719
02:13:31,922 --> 02:13:36,966
[SPEAKER_15]: And the only way that you get health is to get first aid drops that are left by dead civilians.

1720
02:13:37,506 --> 02:13:40,388
[SPEAKER_15]: So they're already dead, so I guess shooting them is okay.

1721
02:13:40,949 --> 02:13:45,465
[SPEAKER_15]: However, you get shot at if you open fire on them, so it's really kind of a weird thing.

1722
02:13:45,565 --> 02:13:45,946
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

1723
02:13:45,986 --> 02:13:46,548
[SPEAKER_15]: Have you heard of this?

1724
02:13:48,298 --> 02:13:50,839
[SPEAKER_08]: I just saw that he did a game jam game.

1725
02:13:50,859 --> 02:13:53,300
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a FPS game jam game.

1726
02:13:53,420 --> 02:13:55,220
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a seven-day, week-long thing.

1727
02:13:55,620 --> 02:13:56,841
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it sounded interesting.

1728
02:13:56,861 --> 02:13:57,741
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't played it.

1729
02:13:58,381 --> 02:13:59,141
[SPEAKER_08]: It's browser-based.

1730
02:13:59,361 --> 02:14:03,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm kind of interested because he did it in Unity, and so that's what I'm working with right now.

1731
02:14:03,703 --> 02:14:05,543
[SPEAKER_08]: So it would be kind of interesting to check it out.

1732
02:14:05,563 --> 02:14:08,844
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the style of his graphics.

1733
02:14:08,944 --> 02:14:13,986
[SPEAKER_08]: It is kind of 90s FPS with the pre-rendered hand.

1734
02:14:14,106 --> 02:14:16,547
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yeah, they're all very...

1735
02:14:18,427 --> 02:14:18,928
[SPEAKER_08]: Pixelated?

1736
02:14:18,948 --> 02:14:19,588
[SPEAKER_15]: Pixely, yeah.

1737
02:14:19,608 --> 02:14:20,528
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty sweet.

1738
02:14:21,229 --> 02:14:24,130
[SPEAKER_15]: With, you know, shadowed out backgrounds and everything.

1739
02:14:25,070 --> 02:14:25,871
[SPEAKER_15]: It's pretty interesting.

1740
02:14:25,931 --> 02:14:27,392
[SPEAKER_15]: I just like that the zombies are just green.

1741
02:14:29,753 --> 02:14:32,714
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm surprised he didn't go with Minecraft zombies because that would have been even funnier.

1742
02:14:33,294 --> 02:14:34,895
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, but that would be expected.

1743
02:14:36,856 --> 02:14:37,276
[SPEAKER_15]: Still though.

1744
02:14:38,997 --> 02:14:40,318
[SPEAKER_08]: I like expected from him.

1745
02:14:40,338 --> 02:14:40,938
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1746
02:14:44,383 --> 02:14:47,088
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so something else regarding Notch.

1747
02:14:47,328 --> 02:14:49,352
[SPEAKER_08]: That one game, um, what was it?

1748
02:14:49,372 --> 02:14:50,795
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember what the hell it was called.

1749
02:14:50,875 --> 02:14:51,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I love that one game.

1750
02:14:51,897 --> 02:14:52,698
[SPEAKER_08]: The OX10C.

1751
02:14:52,738 --> 02:14:54,121
[SPEAKER_15]: I played it that time with these people.

1752
02:14:55,178 --> 02:15:16,237
[SPEAKER_08]: his space game that was supposed to be like kind of a not a sequel to Minecraft but still sandbox-ish and procedurally generated but anyways he has decided to go ahead and stop development on it and basically shelving it and just this is due to kind of a creative block they had with the game and

1753
02:15:16,377 --> 02:15:23,623
[SPEAKER_08]: However, he was saying, though, that there are some fans that are actually interested in carrying on into the project.

1754
02:15:24,523 --> 02:15:31,088
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, basically saying that they're not using any of his old code or his name or anything.

1755
02:15:32,149 --> 02:15:40,576
[SPEAKER_08]: That they're going to just kind of, I guess, based on what he had, sort of create a new game.

1756
02:15:40,776 --> 02:15:46,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Not really with the story and stuff, but just kind of a new concept with the original idea.

1757
02:15:47,719 --> 02:16:15,534
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know which the original idea did sound kind of neat so I was a little sad to see it go but yeah if he doesn't want to do it it is what it is yeah I mean and that's fine I guess to be inspired by them they're saying they're calling it Project Trillic for now and um no idea what exactly they're going to be doing with it other than they're saying that they're not planning on selling it once it's released but um

1758
02:16:17,222 --> 02:16:17,502
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1759
02:16:17,763 --> 02:16:19,504
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be interesting to see.

1760
02:16:19,564 --> 02:16:26,350
[SPEAKER_08]: I still didn't really understand what the whole game was about other than I know that you could create your own ship and then you could visit planets and stuff.

1761
02:16:26,570 --> 02:16:27,992
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1762
02:16:28,112 --> 02:16:34,237
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't Minecraft, but it was some sort of crafting into it and you can program stuff.

1763
02:16:34,758 --> 02:16:35,098
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1764
02:16:35,178 --> 02:16:42,445
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just very high concept, but I didn't really understand how it would play, I guess.

1765
02:16:44,045 --> 02:16:44,666
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura

1766
02:17:02,605 --> 02:17:06,688
[SPEAKER_06]: One of them involved is the legendary Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu.

1767
02:17:07,668 --> 02:17:14,613
[SPEAKER_06]: What they're launching on Kickstarter is called Project Phoenix, and it is an indie JRPG that is trying to be developed.

1768
02:17:15,093 --> 02:17:19,175
[SPEAKER_06]: The group behind it is Creative Intelligence Arts.

1769
02:17:19,255 --> 02:17:26,540
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a Tokyo-based company, and they do also Eminence Symphony Orchestra that does video game and anime arrangement stuff.

1770
02:17:27,200 --> 02:17:55,616
[SPEAKER_06]: um Hiroaki Yura will be the director and producer on Project Phoenix whereas Uematsu will score the title uh which it's not strictly Japanese developers because like LA Noire game designer Vaughn Smith is supposed to be a part of it uh but also fantasy novelist Yoko Inoki uh concept artist in Final Fantasy Kiyoshi Arai sound engineer John Kurlander who worked on Lord of the Rings and Elder Scrolls 5 Skyrim so they kind of have this team together but now they just need the money to pay them uh

1771
02:17:55,956 --> 02:18:00,598
[SPEAKER_06]: So they say this will be a JRPG with squad-based real-time strategy game design.

1772
02:18:01,598 --> 02:18:04,459
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be for Windows PC, Mac, and Linux via Steam.

1773
02:18:05,619 --> 02:18:14,322
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're hoping to also launch maybe some type of different limited version for iOS and Android, possibly a PlayStation 4 port if the group gets enough funding.

1774
02:18:14,743 --> 02:18:16,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they got their funding pretty quick.

1775
02:18:16,503 --> 02:18:17,143
[SPEAKER_06]: They wanted $100,000 to do this.

1776
02:18:19,204 --> 02:18:22,365
[SPEAKER_06]: with 23 days to go, five times that amount.

1777
02:18:22,385 --> 02:18:25,306
[SPEAKER_06]: They have half a million, over half a million in their Kickstarter for this right now.

1778
02:18:25,326 --> 02:18:27,146
[SPEAKER_14]: I got lost when they said it was a real-time strategy.

1779
02:18:28,347 --> 02:18:30,167
[SPEAKER_06]: A squad-based RTS game, but yeah.

1780
02:18:30,547 --> 02:18:31,508
[SPEAKER_15]: That just is not fun.

1781
02:18:31,768 --> 02:18:33,288
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Buoy Matsu will do the music.

1782
02:18:33,408 --> 02:18:35,009
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll take the soundtrack, but I won't play the game.

1783
02:18:36,329 --> 02:18:37,989
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's see some of the stretch goals.

1784
02:18:38,089 --> 02:18:41,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Double the amount of character and monster models and Uematsu will do more music.

1785
02:18:41,890 --> 02:18:42,771
[SPEAKER_06]: So they've hit that goal.

1786
02:18:44,931 --> 02:18:47,592
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to fight inside the Kraken if they make a million.

1787
02:18:47,612 --> 02:18:49,172
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what that even means.

1788
02:18:49,992 --> 02:18:51,032
[SPEAKER_06]: But all right.

1789
02:18:52,453 --> 02:18:54,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Congrats to those guys for getting their funding.

1790
02:18:54,333 --> 02:18:55,333
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope the game's great.

1791
02:18:55,894 --> 02:18:58,034
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to make a game that Jamie wants to play.

1792
02:18:58,694 --> 02:19:01,995
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, make it a standard RPG with lots of shooting.

1793
02:19:02,934 --> 02:19:25,366
[SPEAKER_06]: going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com DarkTetsuya says hey we're at least guaranteed an epic soundtrack on this that is true a game I mentioned in the first half that I'm going to mention again because it was so horrifically underlooked Lost Odyssey had an amazing soundtrack as well and I believe Uematsu did a lot of the music for that game didn't he?

1794
02:19:28,231 --> 02:19:29,252
[SPEAKER_06]: To the Google Cave!

1795
02:19:29,272 --> 02:19:30,193
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe he did.

1796
02:19:30,293 --> 02:19:33,935
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he did because Mistwalker, he was a part of that, wasn't he?

1797
02:19:34,015 --> 02:19:34,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Or I should say is.

1798
02:19:37,519 --> 02:20:00,824
[SPEAKER_06]: uh but the music sounds right I'm looking it up real quick yes he did do the music no I don't I just had that moment of geek cred intact I know I had that moment of shit he did do the music right uh all right anyhow uh let's get into this music that means it is time for the mailbag so

1799
02:20:02,270 --> 02:20:09,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com is the place where you can send us emails and DarkSakura will dive into the mailbag and hopefully pull out some letters worth reading.

1800
02:20:09,693 --> 02:20:10,734
[SPEAKER_15]: Deleting a spam.

1801
02:20:11,114 --> 02:20:12,515
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh God, it's been really bad.

1802
02:20:12,915 --> 02:20:16,076
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to tell you guys, we will be changing that address soon.

1803
02:20:16,416 --> 02:20:21,099
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, we need to start using Gmail service for our mail rejection.

1804
02:20:21,119 --> 02:20:24,240
[SPEAKER_06]: But you have to pay for that now, so... Nah.

1805
02:20:24,840 --> 02:20:25,741
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll talk off air.

1806
02:20:25,841 --> 02:20:26,081
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1807
02:20:26,761 --> 02:20:30,043
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, I'll start with a short one.

1808
02:20:30,984 --> 02:20:32,625
[SPEAKER_15]: This is from Nark.

1809
02:20:33,585 --> 02:20:43,811
[SPEAKER_15]: Since you had such a fun time playing Team Fortress 2, I thought I'd put in a plug for a Team Fortress 2-like game that's still in beta but definitely ready for prime time loadout.

1810
02:20:44,632 --> 02:20:46,293
[SPEAKER_15]: Keep up the fun casting, Nark.

1811
02:20:46,849 --> 02:21:14,440
[SPEAKER_06]: I've heard of Loadout and we need to do another Epic Team Forgers tonight people ask me like well when do people actually play on the server it's there for you guys to get together talk on Twitter and the forums and so forth and make something happen I myself maybe will be there tonight but I don't want to promise that so probably during the week next week there'll be a night we just need to have a set aside night maybe after Horde House on Wednesday or something

1812
02:21:15,939 --> 02:21:16,380
[SPEAKER_15]: Next email?

1813
02:21:16,680 --> 02:21:16,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

1814
02:21:17,661 --> 02:21:19,684
[SPEAKER_15]: I downloaded DuckTales on the PSN.

1815
02:21:19,764 --> 02:21:23,829
[SPEAKER_15]: It plays fine, but I can't help but think the game probably looks better in the original 8-bit.

1816
02:21:24,350 --> 02:21:26,893
[SPEAKER_15]: Since you guys played the original, how does it compare?

1817
02:21:27,134 --> 02:21:28,816
[SPEAKER_15]: By the way, I love the animation in the vault.

1818
02:21:28,896 --> 02:21:29,617
[SPEAKER_15]: It made me smile.

1819
02:21:29,657 --> 02:21:30,318
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's from Robaba.

1820
02:21:31,385 --> 02:21:55,008
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't played the original in a very long time but from what I remember well I think you know I think I think I touched on a lot of this at the top of the show they did change some of the mechanics and there's the new levels and stuff and when you're actually playing the game the gameplay feels pretty good but there's all these cutscenes that were not I mean the original did have cutscenes but they were just they weren't the same

1821
02:21:55,208 --> 02:21:56,209
[SPEAKER_15]: The poses are the same.

1822
02:21:56,890 --> 02:22:02,217
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I thought that the new animation frames really harkened back to the original.

1823
02:22:02,237 --> 02:22:03,679
[SPEAKER_06]: I did love the way it looked.

1824
02:22:04,059 --> 02:22:05,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's really pretty.

1825
02:22:07,392 --> 02:22:11,313
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what warmed my heart in such a lovely way is hearing June Foray.

1826
02:22:12,433 --> 02:22:14,154
[SPEAKER_15]: And I didn't mean to rhyme, but it did.

1827
02:22:14,554 --> 02:22:17,375
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that was... I love her so much.

1828
02:22:17,615 --> 02:22:21,176
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate bagging on the sound because I don't want to make it sound like it's the actor's fault.

1829
02:22:21,236 --> 02:22:21,776
[SPEAKER_06]: It is not.

1830
02:22:21,816 --> 02:22:29,358
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm so happy they got back together, but it's just... I really need to hear the console one because it sounded fine on Dan's computer.

1831
02:22:29,518 --> 02:22:29,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, anyway.

1832
02:22:30,918 --> 02:22:31,639
[SPEAKER_15]: It could have been his speakers.

1833
02:22:31,659 --> 02:22:31,999
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

1834
02:22:32,019 --> 02:22:36,140
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think I got... Rob, if I missed something, shoot us another email.

1835
02:22:36,180 --> 02:22:36,660
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll clarify.

1836
02:22:37,017 --> 02:22:38,618
[SPEAKER_15]: Now the jungle music is stuck in my head.

1837
02:22:40,478 --> 02:22:41,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not the moon music?

1838
02:22:41,339 --> 02:22:42,039
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the best music.

1839
02:22:42,239 --> 02:22:47,481
[SPEAKER_15]: Because the fortune cookie will explain it.

1840
02:22:48,142 --> 02:22:49,282
[SPEAKER_15]: The fortune cookie will explain it.

1841
02:22:49,482 --> 02:22:49,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Next email.

1842
02:22:51,638 --> 02:22:53,019
[SPEAKER_15]: One of my favorite names.

1843
02:23:18,809 --> 02:23:22,953
[SPEAKER_15]: First, I cannot help but think about the security breach that unfortunately affected Rob.

1844
02:23:23,473 --> 02:23:29,499
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, Sony had their breach too and when you consider everything that happened between Sony and Microsoft, it's like trying to figure out the lesser of two evils.

1845
02:23:30,019 --> 02:23:36,626
[SPEAKER_15]: But Microsoft tried to keep things under the rug and didn't seem like they were taking things seriously, which is utter bullshit.

1846
02:23:37,286 --> 02:23:43,532
[SPEAKER_15]: Rob, would you please briefly recap what you went through so I can point people to this episode about the incident?

1847
02:23:44,258 --> 02:23:45,399
[SPEAKER_06]: No, go through the archive.

1848
02:23:45,479 --> 02:23:45,919
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm kidding.

1849
02:23:47,020 --> 02:23:52,424
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, even though the Sony service was hacked some time ago, we all know how that went down.

1850
02:23:52,825 --> 02:23:55,226
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know anybody who lost money on the PlayStation.

1851
02:23:55,667 --> 02:24:01,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Not that that excuses what happened, because that was horrible, but I didn't actually lose money.

1852
02:24:01,611 --> 02:24:10,758
[SPEAKER_06]: But what did happen is that somebody else signed into my account and bought a bunch of stuff, bought those FIFA gold packs and stuff like that.

1853
02:24:10,778 --> 02:24:11,418
[SPEAKER_06]: They ran up...

1854
02:24:12,279 --> 02:24:14,061
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even remember how much it was at this point.

1855
02:24:14,101 --> 02:24:14,822
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say it was about $100.

1856
02:24:14,942 --> 02:24:20,829
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it wasn't like... It wasn't astronomical, but it was certainly enough where I missed it.

1857
02:24:20,849 --> 02:24:21,810
[SPEAKER_15]: It was something recoverable.

1858
02:24:21,970 --> 02:24:22,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1859
02:24:22,751 --> 02:24:26,015
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, they had taken this money and I...

1860
02:24:27,316 --> 02:24:28,217
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1861
02:24:48,889 --> 02:25:02,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody linked my account to one of those, and so I had to call Microsoft, and they took care of it and did what they had to do, but there was a couple days I was out that money, and it was really infuriating, kind of violating.

1862
02:25:02,999 --> 02:25:10,024
[SPEAKER_06]: And when that happened to you, the first thing I did was sign up for that EA account thing so that I could... Yes, because I told all the listeners, I said, if you sign up for that, then they can't do it for you.

1863
02:25:10,204 --> 02:25:10,644
[SPEAKER_15]: Exactly.

1864
02:25:10,845 --> 02:25:12,846
[SPEAKER_06]: So I remember doing that.

1865
02:25:13,186 --> 02:25:17,850
[SPEAKER_06]: But lots of people I know, like people who hadn't even touched their Xbox in forever were getting...

1866
02:25:18,790 --> 02:25:20,111
[SPEAKER_06]: were hacked like that.

1867
02:25:20,631 --> 02:25:39,364
[SPEAKER_06]: And everybody would say, oh, well, Rob, you're stupid and you fell for one of those phishing sites or somewhere and I'm just kind of sitting here going, I'm not going to sit here and say that would never happen to me because I'm not going to be that full of myself that I can't think I might make a mistake once in a while.

1868
02:25:39,804 --> 02:25:48,190
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think it says something when people who haven't even used their Xboxes in so long and would have no interest in going to any website online were also having their money taken.

1869
02:25:48,730 --> 02:25:53,013
[SPEAKER_06]: and I kind of always... When Microsoft came out and said, oh, everybody's just getting phished.

1870
02:25:53,253 --> 02:25:53,813
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the problem.

1871
02:25:53,833 --> 02:25:55,074
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a real phishing problem.

1872
02:25:55,394 --> 02:25:58,056
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of sitting here going, bullshit, bullshit.

1873
02:25:58,876 --> 02:26:00,077
[SPEAKER_06]: And that kind of pissed me off.

1874
02:26:00,778 --> 02:26:04,480
[SPEAKER_06]: And have I forgiven them for it?

1875
02:26:05,040 --> 02:26:05,520
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess.

1876
02:26:05,601 --> 02:26:06,541
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a long time.

1877
02:26:06,601 --> 02:26:07,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Have I forgotten?

1878
02:26:07,482 --> 02:26:08,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell no.

1879
02:26:09,363 --> 02:26:13,345
[SPEAKER_06]: And I try very hard not to save my credit card information or any of that anymore.

1880
02:26:13,385 --> 02:26:15,767
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, there's always lessons to be learned from any experience.

1881
02:26:15,787 --> 02:26:15,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

1882
02:26:19,070 --> 02:26:21,552
[SPEAKER_15]: Second, putting free apps behind the gold paywall.

1883
02:26:21,972 --> 02:26:26,877
[SPEAKER_15]: I outright refuse to support a service that requires you to pay to use a program freely available elsewhere.

1884
02:26:27,357 --> 02:26:33,422
[SPEAKER_15]: No matter what features and perks are available, you should not have to pay and continue paying Microsoft just so you can watch Netflix or Hulu.

1885
02:26:34,043 --> 02:26:35,404
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why I have my computer.

1886
02:26:36,885 --> 02:26:40,506
[SPEAKER_15]: Lastly, Microsoft has a muddy reputation when it comes to indie developers.

1887
02:26:41,066 --> 02:26:49,528
[SPEAKER_15]: In the past, we've had indies like Team Meat and Phil Fish comment on how Microsoft poorly treated them when it came to handling advertising and patches on the Xbox Marketplace.

1888
02:26:49,968 --> 02:26:54,229
[SPEAKER_15]: And while the recent change to self-publishing is good, we have retro city rampage creator Provinciano

1889
02:26:57,790 --> 02:27:08,873
[SPEAKER_15]: and stating to develop that Microsoft's indie development program is not on par with what other companies offer and there are strings attached with the change to self-publishing.

1890
02:27:10,254 --> 02:27:16,295
[SPEAKER_15]: Hearing all this makes me assume that the ones digital only offerings won't be as numerous as the PS4s.

1891
02:27:16,775 --> 02:27:17,816
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a nasty canasta.

1892
02:27:19,556 --> 02:27:21,857
[SPEAKER_15]: And just checking, no more email.

1893
02:27:22,017 --> 02:27:22,377
[SPEAKER_15]: That's it.

1894
02:27:25,639 --> 02:27:31,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I got distracted with a private message, but there was something else in that email I wanted to reply to, and I read it before the show.

1895
02:27:33,084 --> 02:27:34,565
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you recap the last two points?

1896
02:27:34,685 --> 02:27:36,726
[SPEAKER_15]: I closed it.

1897
02:27:36,926 --> 02:27:43,911
[SPEAKER_15]: One of them was about how poorly they treat the indie developers and how they're strings attached and they're not very user-friendly and not receptive.

1898
02:27:43,931 --> 02:27:45,692
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, thank you.

1899
02:27:47,655 --> 02:27:49,656
[SPEAKER_06]: The stuff being behind the gold paywall.

1900
02:27:50,016 --> 02:27:51,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's stupid.

1901
02:27:53,637 --> 02:27:54,637
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what else to say.

1902
02:27:56,438 --> 02:27:57,618
[SPEAKER_06]: That is going to make the decision.

1903
02:27:58,458 --> 02:28:07,401
[SPEAKER_06]: I would point at the Facebook commenter earlier who said the dad bought the PlayStation 3 just for the Blu-ray and the Netflix Hulu.

1904
02:28:08,782 --> 02:28:13,403
[SPEAKER_06]: If they have to buy an extra subscription, you're not going to sell an Xbox One to that individual.

1905
02:28:13,903 --> 02:28:25,987
[SPEAKER_06]: So, especially when you can do Netflix online for free, and I mean, granted, yes, you pay the subscription, but I'm talking about the viewer itself is on any Internet Explorer window for free, Microsoft probably shouldn't gate that shit.

1906
02:28:26,768 --> 02:28:28,488
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as the indie developers go...

1907
02:28:30,769 --> 02:28:32,071
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1908
02:28:51,031 --> 02:28:53,854
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1909
02:29:13,451 --> 02:29:42,790
[SPEAKER_06]: so I think Microsoft does realize they done fucked up and they're going in the other direction and I think Microsoft should be giving some credit for that I mean they are giving all these bitchers what they wanted you know at the sacrifice of potentially moving gaming in this new vision or this new direction whether it be right or wrong you know they're going back to what what people what works for people now so I kind of don't want to keep dogging them for doing that but

1910
02:29:43,090 --> 02:30:10,731
[SPEAKER_06]: um now it is really going to be about the games and that $100 price difference between the two systems which you never know we could still hear that whole now that connect they may remove it who knows or or take a loss to drop the price if they're that desperate enough I don't know um I kind of don't think that'll happen but here's what I could see them doing um you know it's kind of a helping thing is bundling software with it bundling software or including a year of gold

1911
02:30:12,438 --> 02:30:18,943
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like the Wii U needs to drop their fucking price already and all they have to do is remove the basic set and make the deluxe set the only set and make it the basic price

1912
02:30:32,853 --> 02:30:43,322
[SPEAKER_08]: I think what they're planning on doing with the Wii U, I think they're playing it cool right now because they're wanting to see how the new software, these big titles that they have coming out, what the uptick is going to be with that.

1913
02:30:43,342 --> 02:30:46,284
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if that does it alone, then they don't need to drop the price.

1914
02:30:46,505 --> 02:30:49,107
[SPEAKER_08]: If that doesn't do it, then they may drop the price.

1915
02:30:49,307 --> 02:30:52,290
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's what they're waiting on is to see how it does it.

1916
02:30:52,310 --> 02:30:57,014
[SPEAKER_08]: But the longer you wait, the more it's going to suffer.

1917
02:30:57,774 --> 02:30:58,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1918
02:30:58,575 --> 02:31:00,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, that's it.

1919
02:31:01,477 --> 02:31:03,238
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I've said enough in response to that email.

1920
02:31:03,258 --> 02:31:05,520
[SPEAKER_06]: So mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com That's it.

1921
02:31:05,580 --> 02:31:06,821
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to email us in the future.

1922
02:31:08,282 --> 02:31:09,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's move on.

1923
02:31:09,083 --> 02:31:11,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Although we are going to look into changing that this week.

1924
02:31:11,224 --> 02:31:12,666
[SPEAKER_06]: So this might be the last week of that.

1925
02:31:12,826 --> 02:31:14,487
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can send it there for now and be safe.

1926
02:31:14,527 --> 02:31:15,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at orangelaunchradio.com

1927
02:31:15,950 --> 02:31:16,391
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't get crazy.

1928
02:31:48,161 --> 02:31:48,925
[SPEAKER_14]: I have an F you.

1929
02:31:49,308 --> 02:31:51,039
[SPEAKER_15]: It's to every fucking thing.

1930
02:31:53,294 --> 02:31:56,036
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, not everything, but a lot of stuff.

1931
02:31:56,336 --> 02:31:59,419
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm still kind of fucked off over that whole job thing.

1932
02:32:00,279 --> 02:32:04,262
[SPEAKER_15]: But then again, I don't want to work for bigots, so I'm of two minds.

1933
02:32:05,343 --> 02:32:12,308
[SPEAKER_15]: F you to Bubba Gump Shrimp Company, because I had your delicious fish and chips and it murdered me.

1934
02:32:13,289 --> 02:32:17,012
[SPEAKER_15]: I was sick for days after that and could eat nothing but almond butter and honey.

1935
02:32:17,792 --> 02:32:19,774
[SPEAKER_15]: Which is true, I ate nothing but almond butter and honey for two days.

1936
02:32:20,188 --> 02:32:20,528
[SPEAKER_15]: and Grapes.

1937
02:32:21,168 --> 02:32:21,608
[SPEAKER_15]: Grapes are good.

1938
02:32:22,469 --> 02:32:27,570
[SPEAKER_15]: But just a big pile of fuckery is abounding and I'm getting sick of it.

1939
02:32:29,231 --> 02:32:35,213
[SPEAKER_15]: Someone needs to take out the leaf blower thing and blow it out of my life.

1940
02:32:35,593 --> 02:32:36,273
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm done.

1941
02:32:37,073 --> 02:32:38,013
[SPEAKER_15]: So sick of this shit.

1942
02:32:39,694 --> 02:32:39,994
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki?

1943
02:32:40,014 --> 02:32:40,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki?

1944
02:32:41,590 --> 02:33:01,829
[SPEAKER_08]: F you to my work because once again one of our reps left and they're not hiring another person to take that person's spot and so I have a ton more work I have to do and a lot more accounts I have to handle and no additional compensation.

1945
02:33:02,329 --> 02:33:03,190
[SPEAKER_14]: Convince them to hire me.

1946
02:33:03,686 --> 02:33:04,287
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1947
02:33:25,868 --> 02:33:26,228
[SPEAKER_06]: People.

1948
02:33:26,889 --> 02:33:28,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Because people are invading.

1949
02:33:30,372 --> 02:33:32,594
[SPEAKER_06]: My FU of the week goes to drama.

1950
02:33:33,334 --> 02:33:34,235
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want none.

1951
02:33:34,555 --> 02:33:39,780
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you try to bring drama into my life, you will not be as big of a part of my life.

1952
02:33:40,240 --> 02:33:41,922
[SPEAKER_06]: So keep your drama away from me.

1953
02:33:42,602 --> 02:33:43,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you and good night.

1954
02:33:49,389 --> 02:33:49,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1955
02:33:49,990 --> 02:33:50,550
[SPEAKER_06]: Chirp chirp.

1956
02:33:50,910 --> 02:33:51,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Chirp chirp.

1957
02:33:52,171 --> 02:33:52,612
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

1958
02:33:53,052 --> 02:33:53,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

1959
02:33:54,273 --> 02:33:56,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's talk a little bit more Nintendo.

1960
02:33:56,575 --> 02:34:04,422
[SPEAKER_08]: They had a lawsuit that was brought against them for their infringement of a 3D display patent.

1961
02:34:05,382 --> 02:34:08,325
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is, of course, with the 3DS.

1962
02:34:09,286 --> 02:34:13,069
[SPEAKER_08]: And they have, though, managed to reduce the...

1963
02:34:15,631 --> 02:34:19,473
[SPEAKER_08]: and I guess a reduction of what they were going to have to pay.

1964
02:34:19,553 --> 02:34:23,595
[SPEAKER_08]: So now it's down to $30.2 million.

1965
02:34:24,776 --> 02:34:36,622
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're saying that also possibly maybe even being able to reduce it to even less than that.

1966
02:34:36,762 --> 02:34:40,964
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know.

1967
02:34:41,085 --> 02:34:42,926
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounds like that maybe the evidence...

1968
02:34:46,048 --> 02:34:57,216
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, they were saying that it was, I guess, unsupported by the evidence presented at the trial, so maybe they were having a hard case, saying that they violated rights or not.

1969
02:34:58,397 --> 02:35:07,544
[SPEAKER_08]: But either way, though, less money having to be awarded means that they can print more of those $90 copies of Xenoblade Chronicles, so...

1970
02:35:11,485 --> 02:35:11,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

1971
02:35:11,645 --> 02:35:11,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

1972
02:35:31,658 --> 02:35:33,779
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what we really want the Oculus Rift for.

1973
02:35:33,819 --> 02:35:37,140
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the future right here is porn, porn, porn.

1974
02:35:38,420 --> 02:35:40,101
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, let's see.

1975
02:35:40,561 --> 02:35:51,665
[SPEAKER_06]: 3D Heaven is one that's being worked on apparently, which is a detailed full body 3D scans, which would be like, I guess, a nude model that you can just kind of look at.

1976
02:35:52,185 --> 02:35:53,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at our boobies.

1977
02:35:53,486 --> 02:35:55,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Look all around and look at our boobies everywhere.

1978
02:35:56,007 --> 02:35:57,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Try to reach out and touch the boobies.

1979
02:35:57,347 --> 02:36:01,891
[SPEAKER_08]: That'd be funny, like, they give you, like, depending on how you bend your head and stuff, and stuff like that.

1980
02:36:02,191 --> 02:36:06,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn!

1981
02:36:06,355 --> 02:36:07,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see what else there is here.

1982
02:36:08,176 --> 02:36:11,079
[SPEAKER_06]: ThryX Games Chat House 3D.

1983
02:36:11,780 --> 02:36:23,510
[SPEAKER_06]: It's real-time chat client software called Chat House 3D, and I guess it's like a voyeur mode or whatever, and you can, I guess, chat with babes, and maybe they'll take their top off?

1984
02:36:23,570 --> 02:36:23,930
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1985
02:36:24,050 --> 02:36:24,170
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm...

1986
02:36:25,191 --> 02:36:46,293
[SPEAKER_06]: But whatever, it's all in the real vision, the Oculus Rift 3DX Chap is a multiplayer erotic game that is supposed to have Oculus Rift support It's called the first 3D sex game with Oculus Rift support There's also added support for the V-Stroker adult accessory Do you have a V-Stroker, Loki?

1987
02:36:47,194 --> 02:36:49,276
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I do not have a V-Stroker.

1988
02:36:49,316 --> 02:36:50,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't you Google that?

1989
02:36:50,497 --> 02:36:51,598
[SPEAKER_08]: And sadly enough, I know what that is.

1990
02:36:51,618 --> 02:36:52,298
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it like a flashlight?

1991
02:36:52,699 --> 02:36:53,339
[SPEAKER_15]: Really, what is it?

1992
02:36:53,759 --> 02:37:02,887
[SPEAKER_08]: It is like a flashlight thing, but it actually, it's USB powered.

1993
02:37:04,308 --> 02:37:06,430
[SPEAKER_08]: It's masturbation for the lazy.

1994
02:37:09,992 --> 02:37:10,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Move my hand back for it.

1995
02:37:10,973 --> 02:37:12,394
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just too much work.

1996
02:37:13,055 --> 02:37:14,116
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a hand cramp.

1997
02:37:14,156 --> 02:37:15,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody give me my V-Stroker.

1998
02:37:19,740 --> 02:37:20,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Mom!

1999
02:37:20,441 --> 02:37:21,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Bee Stroker!

2000
02:37:23,845 --> 02:37:24,847
[SPEAKER_13]: Okie dokie!

2001
02:37:25,147 --> 02:37:27,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Mommy, I have to have the Bee Stroker!

2002
02:37:28,351 --> 02:37:29,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye!

2003
02:37:31,374 --> 02:37:31,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up, Rob.

2004
02:37:32,295 --> 02:37:32,836
[SPEAKER_15]: You're 35.

2005
02:37:32,876 --> 02:37:33,497
[SPEAKER_15]: Whatever it is.

2006
02:37:35,800 --> 02:37:36,921
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't make them in Canada.

2007
02:37:40,024 --> 02:37:44,907
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I have to digress in a second because they have something in Canada on the App Store that I wish we had here.

2008
02:37:45,087 --> 02:37:45,387
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

2009
02:37:45,907 --> 02:37:57,454
[SPEAKER_15]: It's where you can be a parking attendant and take pictures of people who park badly, record their license plate number, and then you get whatever their parking violation fee is, you get like up to 40% of it.

2010
02:37:57,534 --> 02:37:58,354
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fucking awesome.

2011
02:37:58,474 --> 02:37:59,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god!

2012
02:37:59,495 --> 02:38:00,295
[SPEAKER_15]: We need this here!

2013
02:38:00,315 --> 02:38:01,576
[SPEAKER_06]: We need this here immediately!

2014
02:38:01,636 --> 02:38:02,416
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, right?

2015
02:38:02,616 --> 02:38:04,257
[SPEAKER_15]: I posted it on Facebook a while back.

2016
02:38:04,437 --> 02:38:06,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but there'd be so many complaints.

2017
02:38:06,778 --> 02:38:07,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Who cares?

2018
02:38:08,512 --> 02:38:13,081
[SPEAKER_06]: it's Murica and I can park bad if I want I'll sue you because you misreported me

2019
02:38:13,513 --> 02:38:14,634
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but that's the thing, though.

2020
02:38:14,774 --> 02:38:16,556
[SPEAKER_06]: You moved my car when I wasn't looking.

2021
02:38:17,236 --> 02:38:19,538
[SPEAKER_15]: And the other thing that Canada has is Canada's Worst Driver.

2022
02:38:19,598 --> 02:38:19,998
[SPEAKER_15]: Just saying.

2023
02:38:20,759 --> 02:38:21,480
[SPEAKER_15]: That show's awesome.

2024
02:38:21,500 --> 02:38:23,261
[SPEAKER_06]: There was an America's Worst Driver, you know.

2025
02:38:23,321 --> 02:38:25,043
[SPEAKER_15]: It lasted one season because I fucked it up.

2026
02:38:25,183 --> 02:38:28,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, do you know who won America's Worst Driver?

2027
02:38:29,286 --> 02:38:30,867
[SPEAKER_06]: The guy who started GamerX.

2028
02:38:31,228 --> 02:38:31,468
[SPEAKER_15]: Really?

2029
02:38:31,588 --> 02:38:31,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2030
02:38:31,948 --> 02:38:32,449
[SPEAKER_13]: That's funny.

2031
02:38:33,069 --> 02:38:34,390
[SPEAKER_15]: As long as he's not driving.

2032
02:38:34,410 --> 02:38:37,112
[SPEAKER_06]: In one of those weird, it's a small world kind of things.

2033
02:38:37,633 --> 02:38:41,356
[SPEAKER_15]: But for the record, Canada's Worst Driver is awesome because it's actually educational.

2034
02:38:43,955 --> 02:38:45,056
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't seen either one.

2035
02:38:45,176 --> 02:38:46,076
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my god, it's so good.

2036
02:38:46,717 --> 02:38:48,758
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like the only reality show I like.

2037
02:38:49,479 --> 02:38:49,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

2038
02:38:52,240 --> 02:38:52,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

2039
02:38:54,802 --> 02:38:55,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that it?

2040
02:38:55,342 --> 02:38:56,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's it for the Oculus Rift games.

2041
02:38:57,003 --> 02:38:57,403
[SPEAKER_06]: That's enough.

2042
02:38:57,463 --> 02:38:59,304
[SPEAKER_06]: We learned what a V-stroker is thanks to this.

2043
02:39:00,376 --> 02:39:03,157
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we are going to go to the Skype line.

2044
02:39:03,177 --> 02:39:05,859
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2045
02:39:05,899 --> 02:39:09,160
[SPEAKER_06]: The phones are open for business, so give us a call.

2046
02:39:09,600 --> 02:39:13,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Meanwhile, I'll get to Twitter topics in a minute here, but I want to check with Loki if there's any last-minute stories.

2047
02:39:14,583 --> 02:39:15,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Not really.

2048
02:39:16,004 --> 02:39:21,286
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought, honestly, it was kind of a slow week, but let's see.

2049
02:39:22,927 --> 02:39:26,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there's not a whole lot going on this week.

2050
02:39:28,618 --> 02:39:28,898
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

2051
02:39:29,579 --> 02:39:33,461
[SPEAKER_08]: We can talk more about Grand Theft Auto V. Hey, you want to talk about Grand Theft Auto V?

2052
02:39:34,222 --> 02:39:42,927
[SPEAKER_08]: IQ Games, they've got a new visualizer that's coming to the PS3, so you can get something other than the rotating globe.

2053
02:39:43,868 --> 02:39:48,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, you're saved by phone calls on the Skype line, so let's go to the Skype line.

2054
02:39:48,451 --> 02:39:51,913
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or his name on Skype is Orange Sounds Radio, but we do have a call.

2055
02:39:52,013 --> 02:39:52,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

2056
02:39:52,874 --> 02:39:53,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

2057
02:39:54,094 --> 02:39:54,755
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Ranma.

2058
02:39:55,095 --> 02:39:56,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Ranma, how you doing?

2059
02:39:57,366 --> 02:39:58,706
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing good, how about you?

2060
02:39:59,247 --> 02:40:03,268
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm enlightened now that I know what a V-Stroker is, what's up?

2061
02:40:04,528 --> 02:40:23,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Not too much, I just wanted to say a couple things about last week's podcast I believe it was, because I was kind of on the road at the time Oh right, you're coming back from one of your many conventions Yes, I am such the convention whore You really are, but that's why we love you Are you now immune to all the confunks?

2062
02:40:25,177 --> 02:40:25,517
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

2063
02:40:26,438 --> 02:40:31,760
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll never be immune to the con-funk, the con-plague, or con-anything.

2064
02:40:32,320 --> 02:40:37,082
[SPEAKER_15]: There was a special breed of it, though, that was out around Final Maid 2001 called the Dorbola.

2065
02:40:38,423 --> 02:40:39,944
[SPEAKER_15]: People on TBR Freak remember that.

2066
02:40:43,625 --> 02:40:45,186
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind regarding last week's show?

2067
02:40:45,814 --> 02:41:02,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I just want to say, Rob, I really appreciate what you said about GamerX because a lot of what you said reminds me of some of the conversations I've had with cosplayers, con goers at anime conventions because a lot of what you were talking about you kind of find there because...

2068
02:41:03,257 --> 02:41:13,544
[SPEAKER_02]: of similar fans of anime, different genres and so forth, to kind of get together and understand and relate to what it is.

2069
02:41:14,425 --> 02:41:16,186
[SPEAKER_15]: They all get together and bash the homestucks.

2070
02:41:19,248 --> 02:41:24,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's not, because if we're going to go that direction, nobody's getting on the Skype line, so let's not.

2071
02:41:26,814 --> 02:41:28,195
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, you're right.

2072
02:41:28,255 --> 02:41:32,858
[SPEAKER_06]: So kind of having a safe place for like-minded individuals, absolutely.

2073
02:41:33,752 --> 02:41:34,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, yep, definitely.

2074
02:41:35,473 --> 02:41:38,234
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of, is that the thrill that you get in anime conventions?

2075
02:41:39,515 --> 02:41:42,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of it, yeah, because, I mean, I ain't gonna lie.

2076
02:41:43,277 --> 02:41:48,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Ever since I had this VOG shirt, my desire to cosplay has kind of cut down a lot.

2077
02:41:48,500 --> 02:41:58,786
[SPEAKER_02]: I still cosplay mostly for, like, meetups and stuff, but I just like wearing a shirt that has who I'm representing and who I am, and I'm taking pictures and handing out cards, you know, it's like, well...

2078
02:41:59,568 --> 02:42:02,130
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where I wanna be, and I'm happy where I am.

2079
02:42:18,500 --> 02:42:19,962
[SPEAKER_15]: Rob, no, no, no.

2080
02:42:20,522 --> 02:42:24,646
[SPEAKER_15]: You and I are fighting someone with a sewing machine and we're making your damn Joker costume.

2081
02:42:25,687 --> 02:42:26,347
[SPEAKER_06]: In two weeks?

2082
02:42:26,408 --> 02:42:26,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Good luck.

2083
02:42:26,948 --> 02:42:30,691
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, Evan and I made my Baiken costume in three days.

2084
02:42:31,632 --> 02:42:32,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Fair enough.

2085
02:42:32,673 --> 02:42:34,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, come on, Rob.

2086
02:42:34,195 --> 02:42:36,457
[SPEAKER_02]: We can send you a Black Mage costume.

2087
02:42:37,818 --> 02:42:38,819
[SPEAKER_06]: I did like that costume.

2088
02:42:38,839 --> 02:42:39,580
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a lot of fun.

2089
02:42:40,407 --> 02:42:43,310
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do have an idea for a perfect costume for you.

2090
02:42:43,790 --> 02:42:50,497
[SPEAKER_02]: You should go to Dragon Con dressed as Jesus with a rainbow sash and just walk around with a glass of water.

2091
02:42:52,259 --> 02:42:53,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Wouldn't that be a glass of wine?

2092
02:42:56,633 --> 02:42:59,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob should be Buddy Christ.

2093
02:43:16,998 --> 02:43:29,934
[SPEAKER_06]: I better the the most hilarious thing I thought about doing because I don't here's the thing I don't want to have to keep shaving my fucking beard off for costumes so whatever I dress up as I really want to have a mustache and beard so I thought about maybe doing tingle

2094
02:43:35,877 --> 02:43:36,337
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

2095
02:43:36,537 --> 02:43:39,858
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't necessarily want pictures of me like that on the internet.

2096
02:43:40,259 --> 02:43:41,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Joker's cool.

2097
02:43:41,579 --> 02:43:43,800
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll have pictures of me as Joker on the internet.

2098
02:43:44,120 --> 02:43:46,260
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what I think you should do if you did the Joker costume?

2099
02:43:46,801 --> 02:43:49,361
[SPEAKER_15]: You should do the first Mass Effect uniform.

2100
02:43:49,561 --> 02:43:49,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

2101
02:43:49,942 --> 02:43:51,342
[SPEAKER_15]: Because that one I think is a cool one.

2102
02:43:55,037 --> 02:43:59,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Brad from PodCulture says that wouldn't bother anyone and Blackwell says my friend cosplayed as Buddy Christ.

2103
02:43:59,681 --> 02:44:02,923
[SPEAKER_06]: I underestimate the crowd at DragonCon, clearly.

2104
02:44:02,943 --> 02:44:05,325
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe you should just wear a bathrobe and be the dude.

2105
02:44:05,625 --> 02:44:08,027
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to be offended at DragonCon.

2106
02:44:08,107 --> 02:44:09,508
[SPEAKER_06]: I really hope cosplay pushes the envelope.

2107
02:44:09,548 --> 02:44:10,228
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I know, I know.

2108
02:44:10,669 --> 02:44:15,252
[SPEAKER_13]: We get you leather undies and you can go like Final Fantasy XI outfit.

2109
02:44:15,592 --> 02:44:15,972
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

2110
02:44:16,593 --> 02:44:17,013
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

2111
02:44:17,614 --> 02:44:18,074
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

2112
02:44:18,234 --> 02:44:19,475
[SPEAKER_06]: And let me check my iPad.

2113
02:44:19,795 --> 02:44:20,075
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

2114
02:44:20,095 --> 02:44:20,135
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

2115
02:44:21,296 --> 02:44:25,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if we're going the route of leather, we could dress him up as hard gay Razor Ramon.

2116
02:44:26,881 --> 02:44:28,242
[SPEAKER_02]: But Rob would have to shave for that.

2117
02:44:29,303 --> 02:44:32,265
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I like where this conversation is going.

2118
02:44:32,325 --> 02:44:36,428
[SPEAKER_06]: So you need to change the topic or get the hell off the phone.

2119
02:44:36,528 --> 02:44:37,789
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll find you something good.

2120
02:44:38,069 --> 02:44:38,370
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2121
02:44:39,030 --> 02:44:39,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2122
02:44:39,490 --> 02:44:39,731
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2123
02:44:39,771 --> 02:44:40,651
[SPEAKER_02]: We're changing topics.

2124
02:44:40,691 --> 02:44:41,512
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting out of here.

2125
02:44:41,652 --> 02:44:41,992
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2126
02:44:42,293 --> 02:44:45,956
[SPEAKER_02]: As you haven't heard, I am officially a college graduate.

2127
02:44:46,236 --> 02:44:46,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations.

02:45:10,664 --> 02:45:21,802

[SPEAKER_06]: Take care, buddy.

2153
02:45:55,795 --> 02:45:56,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, take care.

[SPEAKER_06]: You too, man.

[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, bye.

2156
02:45:58,218 --> 02:45:59,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Why isn't Ranma going to DragonCon?

2157
02:45:59,620 --> 02:46:00,341
[SPEAKER_06]: This makes me sad.

2158
02:46:00,661 --> 02:46:01,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranma, you make me sad.

2159
02:46:02,850 --> 02:46:03,631
[SPEAKER_15]: I miss Ronchon.

2160
02:46:03,651 --> 02:46:04,831
[SPEAKER_15]: He needs to come back out here.

2161
02:46:05,092 --> 02:46:05,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?

2162
02:46:05,392 --> 02:46:10,815
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2163
02:46:10,895 --> 02:46:11,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Give us a call.

2164
02:46:11,476 --> 02:46:11,936
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll talk.

2165
02:46:12,196 --> 02:46:13,117
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I love you, Fifth Dream.

2166
02:46:13,137 --> 02:46:13,997
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm a bitch of all trades.

2167
02:46:15,338 --> 02:46:15,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Master of none.

2168
02:46:16,359 --> 02:46:17,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's go to the phones.

2169
02:46:17,680 --> 02:46:18,560
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll show you, Master.

2170
02:46:18,640 --> 02:46:20,001
[SPEAKER_06]: We got another call coming in.

2171
02:46:20,322 --> 02:46:21,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2172
02:46:21,382 --> 02:46:21,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

2173
02:46:23,584 --> 02:46:24,364
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Jim Sally.

2174
02:46:24,384 --> 02:46:25,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy shit!

2175
02:46:25,165 --> 02:46:26,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, it's Jim Sally.

2176
02:46:26,245 --> 02:46:27,006
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Jim Sally.

2177
02:46:27,066 --> 02:46:28,507
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, it's been forever.

2178
02:46:28,587 --> 02:46:29,828
[SPEAKER_10]: Where the hell have you been, young man?

2179
02:46:31,459 --> 02:46:32,340
[SPEAKER_10]: I bought a horse farm.

2180
02:46:32,520 --> 02:46:33,481
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been cleaning it up.

2181
02:46:33,982 --> 02:46:36,245
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, you bought a horse farm?

2182
02:46:36,726 --> 02:46:37,827
[SPEAKER_10]: I bought a horse farm, man.

2183
02:46:37,847 --> 02:46:43,716
[SPEAKER_09]: You remember a while ago, last fall, I moved up north, and we were—I'm going to get a better light for you.

2184
02:46:43,756 --> 02:46:48,342
[SPEAKER_09]: We had to find a house, and I didn't find a really good house farm or horse farm.

2185
02:46:49,096 --> 02:46:49,716
[SPEAKER_09]: So I bought it.

2186
02:46:50,037 --> 02:46:51,498
[SPEAKER_09]: It didn't come with any horses, though.

2187
02:46:51,518 --> 02:46:52,478
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta get some next year.

2188
02:46:52,839 --> 02:46:55,341
[SPEAKER_09]: But I got stables, I got a barn, I got everything, man.

2189
02:46:55,361 --> 02:46:55,781
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm ready to go.

2190
02:46:55,801 --> 02:46:58,643
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a little pasture for them to eat their little grass and shit in.

2191
02:46:58,683 --> 02:46:59,183
[SPEAKER_06]: It's awesome.

2192
02:46:59,283 --> 02:47:05,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, so when your daughter gets to that age where she's like, I want a pony, I want a pony, you're gonna be like, alright, let's do it.

2193
02:47:05,928 --> 02:47:06,889
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta get a horse farm.

2194
02:47:07,850 --> 02:47:10,452
[SPEAKER_09]: I got one ready on call for her third birthday next year.

2195
02:47:12,173 --> 02:47:16,396
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a racetrack like three hours away and they have the retired horses, so instead of just killing off the

2196
02:47:16,856 --> 02:47:18,017
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what they do to racehorses.

2197
02:47:18,998 --> 02:47:20,139
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where the glue comes from.

2198
02:47:20,379 --> 02:47:22,140
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to bring a couple home.

2199
02:47:22,621 --> 02:47:23,601
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

2200
02:47:23,641 --> 02:47:24,162
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.

2201
02:47:25,223 --> 02:47:28,165
[SPEAKER_09]: It's probably cheaper to get to work than gas anyway too, right?

2202
02:47:28,405 --> 02:47:28,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

2203
02:47:28,685 --> 02:47:33,669
[SPEAKER_06]: DungeonBuster in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says real life animal crossing for Jim Sally.

2204
02:47:34,029 --> 02:47:34,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2205
02:47:34,550 --> 02:47:38,613
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, except your horse won't ask you to deliver a package to the person standing right next to you.

2206
02:47:41,135 --> 02:47:42,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations on the house though.

2207
02:47:42,576 --> 02:47:43,217
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.

2208
02:47:44,377 --> 02:47:44,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's pretty good.

2209
02:47:44,978 --> 02:47:45,478
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty big.

2210
02:47:45,999 --> 02:47:46,379
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it.

2211
02:47:46,721 --> 02:47:48,122
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2212
02:48:13,939 --> 02:48:14,159
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait.

2213
02:48:14,339 --> 02:48:15,460
[SPEAKER_09]: You mean Phantasy Star?

2214
02:48:15,980 --> 02:48:16,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Phantasy Star.

2215
02:48:16,740 --> 02:48:17,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Phantasy Star.

2216
02:48:17,581 --> 02:48:19,522
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm talking about Phantasy Star.

2217
02:48:19,542 --> 02:48:20,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at my eye.

2218
02:48:20,162 --> 02:48:22,243
[SPEAKER_09]: You can tell I'm talking about Phantasy Star.

2219
02:48:23,104 --> 02:48:23,364
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2220
02:48:23,424 --> 02:48:23,644
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

2221
02:48:23,704 --> 02:48:23,944
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

2222
02:48:23,964 --> 02:48:25,505
[SPEAKER_06]: You can tell I don't know Phantasy Star.

2223
02:48:25,525 --> 02:48:25,725
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

2224
02:48:25,765 --> 02:48:26,586
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Canada.

2225
02:48:26,606 --> 02:48:28,407
[SPEAKER_06]: It's what you do on a horse farm.

2226
02:48:28,787 --> 02:48:29,047
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2227
02:48:30,027 --> 02:48:33,049
[SPEAKER_06]: So Phantasy Star, yes, on Sega.

2228
02:48:33,569 --> 02:48:34,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Good memories?

2229
02:48:36,991 --> 02:48:37,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2230
02:48:37,992 --> 02:48:40,913
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a rough time in my life when I was about 12 years old, 11, 12.

2231
02:48:40,973 --> 02:48:41,573
[SPEAKER_09]: My parents split up.

2232
02:48:43,117 --> 02:48:45,958
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd have to go see my dad every two weeks, and it kind of sucked.

2233
02:48:46,559 --> 02:48:52,442
[SPEAKER_09]: But every two weeks I went to go see him, I would get to go to the one store in town that rented Sega games, because there was only one store in town that rented them.

2234
02:48:53,122 --> 02:48:56,504
[SPEAKER_09]: And sure enough, one day I got there and I found Phantasy Star.

2235
02:48:57,044 --> 02:48:59,425
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a four-mega cartridge or something it was called.

2236
02:48:59,465 --> 02:49:00,766
[SPEAKER_09]: It was the only one they had, right?

2237
02:49:00,786 --> 02:49:01,466
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a big deal.

2238
02:49:01,906 --> 02:49:06,589
[SPEAKER_09]: If you get the four-mega cartridge, and I picked up this weirdo Japanese RPG game and

2239
02:49:07,233 --> 02:49:09,093
[SPEAKER_09]: I wasn't really into them because I was only 12, right?

2240
02:49:09,113 --> 02:49:10,134
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't really a cool thing to do.

2241
02:49:10,334 --> 02:49:10,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

2242
02:49:10,714 --> 02:49:15,555
[SPEAKER_09]: But I brought it home and I played it all weekend and I was like astonished at how awesome it was, man.

2243
02:49:15,835 --> 02:49:20,196
[SPEAKER_09]: I got my, spoiler alert, I got my little mirror shield and I shined it in fucking Medusa's face and suck that bitch.

2244
02:49:20,556 --> 02:49:21,537
[SPEAKER_09]: She all turned to stone and shit.

2245
02:49:21,557 --> 02:49:23,237
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, this is the fucking greatest game ever.

2246
02:49:23,577 --> 02:49:25,818
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was one of the first, no, you remember that shit, man?

2247
02:49:25,898 --> 02:49:28,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Odin gets the mirror shield and only Odin can hold it.

2248
02:49:28,739 --> 02:49:29,499
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember this shit, man.

2249
02:49:29,519 --> 02:49:30,779
[SPEAKER_09]: Trust me, this is a big deal in my life.

2250
02:49:31,219 --> 02:49:33,300
[SPEAKER_09]: So listen, I'm telling you right now, Rob, from me to you, okay?

2251
02:49:33,460 --> 02:49:33,720
[SPEAKER_09]: Listen.

2252
02:49:34,080 --> 02:49:34,260
[SPEAKER_16]: Mm-hmm.

2253
02:49:34,761 --> 02:49:41,066
[SPEAKER_09]: It was the first game I had anyway that you could save a game on those old fucking cartridges, right?

2254
02:49:41,086 --> 02:49:42,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Those old shitty blowing them cartridges.

2255
02:49:42,708 --> 02:49:43,848
[SPEAKER_09]: And you could save it.

2256
02:49:44,109 --> 02:49:47,251
[SPEAKER_09]: So I saved my game to the first spot and I put a note.

2257
02:49:47,431 --> 02:49:48,752
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember when they used to have game manuals?

2258
02:49:48,833 --> 02:49:50,474
[SPEAKER_09]: I put a sticky note on the front of the game manual.

2259
02:49:50,885 --> 02:49:51,786
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2260
02:50:13,217 --> 02:50:14,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck you, Johnny.

2261
02:50:14,337 --> 02:50:16,838
[SPEAKER_09]: You're fucked.

2262
02:50:16,998 --> 02:50:18,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my god.

2263
02:50:18,179 --> 02:50:22,200
[SPEAKER_09]: I put it in, I loaded up game one, and he fucking sold all my armor and shit that I had.

2264
02:50:22,240 --> 02:50:25,301
[SPEAKER_09]: He fucking took everything and hid it somewhere in a chest or something.

2265
02:50:25,641 --> 02:50:28,943
[SPEAKER_09]: I had three of my characters are dead and just a little fucking cat was alive and shit.

2266
02:50:28,983 --> 02:50:30,243
[SPEAKER_09]: What a dick!

2267
02:50:30,983 --> 02:50:32,724
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm being serious.

2268
02:50:33,204 --> 02:50:35,385
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought Canadians were supposed to be nice.

2269
02:50:35,625 --> 02:50:37,246
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought Canadians were supposed to be nice.

2270
02:50:37,306 --> 02:50:38,326
[SPEAKER_06]: That guy was a dick.

2271
02:50:39,127 --> 02:50:42,389
[SPEAKER_09]: I was video game playing Canadians in 1992, man.

2272
02:50:42,409 --> 02:50:44,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Jesus Christ, a lot of assholes up here, man.

2273
02:50:44,450 --> 02:50:44,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck.

2274
02:50:45,331 --> 02:50:46,952
[SPEAKER_09]: So hey, do you still have a master system?

2275
02:50:47,052 --> 02:50:48,073
[SPEAKER_09]: So I spend all weekend.

2276
02:50:48,433 --> 02:50:49,033
[SPEAKER_09]: But check this out.

2277
02:50:49,053 --> 02:50:50,674
[SPEAKER_09]: This is where the story gets a little bit dirty.

2278
02:50:51,194 --> 02:50:51,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Spoiler alert.

2279
02:50:52,195 --> 02:50:53,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Spoiler alert.

2280
02:50:53,076 --> 02:50:56,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Teenage or young child, preteen, dirtyness coming up here.

2281
02:50:56,818 --> 02:50:58,659
[SPEAKER_09]: So I fucking took the game and I was all upset.

2282
02:50:58,679 --> 02:51:02,622
[SPEAKER_09]: I fucking played real hard and I brought my characters back and shit.

2283
02:51:03,322 --> 02:51:04,923
[SPEAKER_09]: And I fucking left a note in there again.

2284
02:51:05,223 --> 02:51:06,584
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, whoever gets this game next.

2285
02:51:07,014 --> 02:51:18,871
[SPEAKER_09]: I save my game to level 1 I only get it every 2 weeks when I visit my dad please don't over save my game 2 weeks later I go back and I get the fucking game and there's a fucking note in there again and I'm like oh here comes the asshole and this time the note said

2286
02:51:19,557 --> 02:51:21,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, my name is Christy.

2287
02:51:21,598 --> 02:51:23,018
[SPEAKER_09]: My game save is number two.

2288
02:51:23,319 --> 02:51:26,260
[SPEAKER_09]: If you ever want to hang out and play together, here's my phone number and my address.

2289
02:51:26,280 --> 02:51:29,261
[SPEAKER_09]: And she actually left me her phone number and her address in the fucking game manual.

2290
02:51:29,621 --> 02:51:30,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

2291
02:51:30,482 --> 02:51:36,424
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you imagine telling your 12-year-old girl to leave her fucking phone number and address inside of a game nowadays?

2292
02:51:36,464 --> 02:51:37,625
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you fucking imagine that shit?

2293
02:51:37,645 --> 02:51:38,885
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, this is 1992, right?

2294
02:51:38,985 --> 02:51:39,185
[SPEAKER_09]: This is 1992.

2295
02:51:39,225 --> 02:51:40,926
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you call the number because I'm thinking 65-year-old man?

2296
02:51:46,371 --> 02:51:51,195
[SPEAKER_09]: No, dude, I called a number and it was a fucking 12-year-old girl that lived like maybe five, six blocks.

2297
02:51:51,215 --> 02:51:52,216
[SPEAKER_09]: It was far from my house.

2298
02:51:52,696 --> 02:51:56,019
[SPEAKER_09]: But we would hang out every two weeks for like maybe six months afterwards.

2299
02:51:56,379 --> 02:51:59,301
[SPEAKER_09]: And we would play the game for like, I don't know, an hour or two.

2300
02:51:59,642 --> 02:52:00,983
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we would play another game.

2301
02:52:02,810 --> 02:52:03,811
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2302
02:52:23,767 --> 02:52:24,428
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, exactly.

2303
02:52:24,448 --> 02:52:25,188
[SPEAKER_09]: It got me to first mate.

2304
02:52:25,208 --> 02:52:26,829
[SPEAKER_09]: We were only 12, but I kissed her.

2305
02:52:26,849 --> 02:52:28,030
[SPEAKER_09]: I would kiss her a little bit.

2306
02:52:28,330 --> 02:52:29,170
[SPEAKER_09]: We would snuggle.

2307
02:52:29,491 --> 02:52:30,531
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we would play the game.

2308
02:52:30,591 --> 02:52:34,493
[SPEAKER_09]: She'd be like, no, you should buy the fangs for the cat.

2309
02:52:34,574 --> 02:52:36,895
[SPEAKER_09]: And we don't have to buy the staff for the old man because he's stuck.

2310
02:52:36,915 --> 02:52:38,696
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd be like, Noah's the fucking man.

2311
02:52:38,756 --> 02:52:40,157
[SPEAKER_09]: He saved us in the forest.

2312
02:52:40,297 --> 02:52:40,917
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck Noah.

2313
02:52:41,678 --> 02:52:43,459
[SPEAKER_09]: Get the jewels for the, get the collar jewels.

2314
02:52:44,199 --> 02:52:47,861
[SPEAKER_09]: And we would fucking have these little arguments for like, oh, at least six months.

2315
02:52:48,222 --> 02:52:50,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Until the summertime came and then she took off for like, what?

2316
02:52:51,819 --> 02:52:53,680
[SPEAKER_09]: We beat the game like three times together, guy.

2317
02:52:53,700 --> 02:52:54,181
[SPEAKER_09]: It was awesome.

2318
02:52:54,221 --> 02:52:55,542
[SPEAKER_09]: We just kept playing that same game.

2319
02:52:55,742 --> 02:52:57,863
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's how it ends?

2320
02:52:58,203 --> 02:52:58,904
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

2321
02:52:58,944 --> 02:52:59,504
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how it ends?

2322
02:52:59,544 --> 02:53:03,867
[SPEAKER_06]: She just disappeared one summer and no fulfilling the fantasy star?

2323
02:53:03,907 --> 02:53:06,768
[SPEAKER_15]: We didn't go to the same school in the summertime.

2324
02:53:06,788 --> 02:53:10,451
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't have to see my dad every two weeks in the summertime.

2325
02:53:11,091 --> 02:53:12,332
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we just kind of fell off, man.

2326
02:53:12,352 --> 02:53:14,113
[SPEAKER_09]: We never really got together because that was grade 8.

2327
02:53:14,153 --> 02:53:15,554
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I went into grade 7 or grade 8.

2328
02:53:15,594 --> 02:53:15,714
[SPEAKER_09]: It was

2329
02:53:17,839 --> 02:53:19,141
[SPEAKER_09]: I was a sophomore in high school.

2330
02:53:35,143 --> 02:53:41,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Jim Sally, you still got it.

2331
02:53:41,445 --> 02:53:42,805
[SPEAKER_06]: You still got it and you know it.

2332
02:53:43,345 --> 02:53:44,025
[SPEAKER_06]: You still got it.

2333
02:53:45,226 --> 02:53:57,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I know you're married and you're spoken for and all that, but if you were to find... If you were to find that girl again today, she would throw her panties at you.

2334
02:53:57,869 --> 02:53:58,529
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I'm saying.

2335
02:53:59,270 --> 02:54:00,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you guys are pretty.

2336
02:54:01,130 --> 02:54:01,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at that.

2337
02:54:01,650 --> 02:54:02,590
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at this old car.

2338
02:54:02,630 --> 02:54:05,391
[SPEAKER_09]: I restored this old car so we could drive around and it just started our wedding day.

2339
02:54:05,411 --> 02:54:09,973
[SPEAKER_06]: This is absolutely terrible radio and I don't care because I'm getting to see pictures of Jim Sally's wife.

2340
02:54:09,993 --> 02:54:13,193
[SPEAKER_09]: You can see these pictures on Jim Sally's Facebook at jimsallysfacebook.com.

2341
02:54:13,213 --> 02:54:13,674
[SPEAKER_09]: There you go.

2342
02:54:13,874 --> 02:54:16,274
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not a real website, you fucking idiots.

2343
02:54:18,435 --> 02:54:19,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Jim Sally.

2344
02:54:19,115 --> 02:54:20,416
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, I can make that happen.

2345
02:54:20,496 --> 02:54:22,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Jim Sally, I fucking love it when you call.

2346
02:54:23,236 --> 02:54:25,677
[SPEAKER_06]: I unfortunately have to let you go so we can wrap up the show.

2347
02:54:26,057 --> 02:54:27,658
[SPEAKER_06]: But goddamn, don't be a stranger.

2348
02:54:28,198 --> 02:54:29,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't be a stranger.

2349
02:54:30,595 --> 02:54:32,296
[SPEAKER_09]: No, man, I'll be online a lot more.

2350
02:54:32,316 --> 02:54:33,397
[SPEAKER_09]: I got the farm settled now.

2351
02:54:33,437 --> 02:54:34,377
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be online a lot more.

2352
02:54:34,397 --> 02:54:34,858
[SPEAKER_09]: I promise.

2353
02:54:35,038 --> 02:54:35,378
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2354
02:54:35,798 --> 02:54:36,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Promise.

2355
02:54:36,239 --> 02:54:36,839
[SPEAKER_11]: Pinky swear?

2356
02:54:37,760 --> 02:54:39,140
[SPEAKER_11]: Swear on your Phantasy Star save?

2357
02:54:39,161 --> 02:54:40,621
[SPEAKER_11]: I can fucking pinky swear on this.

2358
02:54:40,802 --> 02:54:41,522
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I don't know.

2359
02:54:41,882 --> 02:54:43,944
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't really pinky swear on an iPad.

2360
02:54:44,884 --> 02:54:45,865
[SPEAKER_11]: I have my pinky up.

2361
02:54:45,925 --> 02:54:46,645
[SPEAKER_16]: I have my pinky up.

2362
02:54:47,346 --> 02:54:47,606
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2363
02:54:47,886 --> 02:54:48,887
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying to pinky swear.

2364
02:54:49,407 --> 02:54:50,127
[SPEAKER_11]: Jim Sally.

2365
02:54:50,308 --> 02:54:51,348
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I love everybody.

2366
02:54:51,648 --> 02:54:51,889
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2367
02:54:51,909 --> 02:54:54,030
[SPEAKER_09]: We love you too, Jim Sally.

2368
02:54:54,130 --> 02:54:55,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Before I go, though, DarkSakura.

2369
02:54:55,471 --> 02:54:55,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2370
02:54:56,198 --> 02:54:58,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Seriously, seriously, tell Dan to let the world see your cleavage.

2371
02:54:58,879 --> 02:55:00,119
[SPEAKER_09]: You should never hide your cleavage.

2372
02:55:02,559 --> 02:55:05,160
[SPEAKER_09]: The Lord gave you that cleavage for the rest of us to enjoy.

2373
02:55:05,360 --> 02:55:07,900
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually am wearing a rather busty shirt today.

2374
02:55:07,980 --> 02:55:09,381
[SPEAKER_15]: This was the bike in cleavage.

2375
02:55:10,901 --> 02:55:12,561
[SPEAKER_06]: You played Guilty Gear X, right?

2376
02:55:12,962 --> 02:55:15,422
[SPEAKER_06]: How come you're not Skype videoing me then with the cleavage?

2377
02:55:15,602 --> 02:55:17,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we have to give you a reason to call in next week.

2378
02:55:17,622 --> 02:55:18,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, Jim Sally, I gotta let you go.

2379
02:55:20,751 --> 02:55:21,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, I'm letting you go.

2380
02:55:22,192 --> 02:55:22,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

2381
02:55:23,073 --> 02:55:23,973
[SPEAKER_15]: Tits are GTFO.

2382
02:55:24,293 --> 02:55:24,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

2383
02:55:25,194 --> 02:55:27,495
[SPEAKER_06]: He lifted his shirt up and showed us his boobies.

2384
02:55:32,299 --> 02:55:38,983
[SPEAKER_06]: If you think you can top that call, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2385
02:55:40,224 --> 02:55:41,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh God, I love when he calls in.

2386
02:55:42,946 --> 02:55:43,766
[SPEAKER_06]: He needs a show.

2387
02:55:43,886 --> 02:55:47,749
[SPEAKER_15]: I need to find the pictures of me in the bike and outfit that I had to duct tape my boobs up.

2388
02:55:49,133 --> 02:55:52,176
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what I mean by the duct tape lift that... Yes, oh yes.

2389
02:55:52,676 --> 02:55:53,437
[SPEAKER_15]: So, yeah.

2390
02:55:54,238 --> 02:55:56,760
[SPEAKER_06]: I knew many girls in Rocky Horror that, you know...

2391
02:55:57,219 --> 02:55:57,699
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

2392
02:55:57,859 --> 02:56:03,602
[SPEAKER_15]: It takes boobs of iron to be able to duct tape directly to the skin.

2393
02:56:04,102 --> 02:56:05,563
[SPEAKER_15]: Just saying.

2394
02:56:05,603 --> 02:56:06,123
[SPEAKER_06]: That shit hurts.

2395
02:56:06,863 --> 02:56:08,384
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to do some Twitter topics.

2396
02:56:08,464 --> 02:56:10,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

2397
02:56:10,445 --> 02:56:17,528
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100Matt tweets us that Tommy Tallarico and the Video Games Live crew have taken a Kickstarter to fund the next Video Games Live album.

2398
02:56:17,568 --> 02:56:18,668
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, that's on Kickstarter.

2399
02:56:18,929 --> 02:56:23,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Video Games Live Level 3 that they're currently trying to fund on Kickstarter.

2400
02:56:23,190 --> 02:56:24,231
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sure they'll make it.

2401
02:56:24,371 --> 02:56:25,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of people love their Video Games Live.

2402
02:56:26,892 --> 02:56:46,020
[SPEAKER_06]: TigerClaw sends us a couple of tweets too Warhammer 40k Space Wolf is card based and free to play so if you're interested in that game the good news is that's going to be free to play also he sends us a tweet that a Halo novelist has joined Amazon's game studio I didn't realize Amazon had their own game studio

2403
02:56:49,045 --> 02:56:53,188
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess they do, and I know that they're still kicking around the idea of maybe a console.

2404
02:56:55,209 --> 02:56:59,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, that's true, because we did have that on the last show, where they might have their own Ouya version or whatever.

2405
02:57:00,293 --> 02:57:09,059
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, the writer Eric Nyland, who wrote Gears of War 3 and Halo Reach, he's the new director of narrative design for Amazon Games, so they must be planning something.

2406
02:57:09,419 --> 02:57:13,402
[SPEAKER_06]: They gotta be planning some juicy exclusive for that Android console, we'll see.

2407
02:57:14,723 --> 02:57:20,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Last chance to call 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2408
02:57:20,907 --> 02:57:26,572
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really pressed that I missed Video Games Live when they were here recently, but I just had so much going on.

2409
02:57:28,484 --> 02:57:30,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, I'll give it another minute here.

2410
02:57:30,965 --> 02:57:32,146
[SPEAKER_06]: We have no other last minute stories?

2411
02:57:32,166 --> 02:57:32,746
[SPEAKER_06]: We covered everything?

2412
02:57:32,766 --> 02:57:33,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Not really.

2413
02:57:33,387 --> 02:57:34,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Not anything interesting.

2414
02:57:34,667 --> 02:57:34,907
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2415
02:57:34,927 --> 02:57:35,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we're getting to about 930.

2416
02:57:35,748 --> 02:57:39,890
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think Jim Sally's call was so good.

2417
02:57:40,230 --> 02:57:41,191
[SPEAKER_15]: I saw a Sanrio.

2418
02:57:41,431 --> 02:57:41,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you?

2419
02:57:41,931 --> 02:57:42,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Poking her nose out.

2420
02:57:42,691 --> 02:57:43,812
[SPEAKER_06]: She's ready for KTs.

2421
02:57:43,832 --> 02:57:44,752
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why she's out there.

2422
02:57:45,273 --> 02:57:46,033
[SPEAKER_15]: Meow, meow, meow.

2423
02:57:46,113 --> 02:57:46,653
[SPEAKER_15]: Give me something.

2424
02:57:47,474 --> 02:57:47,734
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2425
02:57:48,394 --> 02:57:49,635
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess we'll close up the Skype line then.

2426
02:57:51,076 --> 02:57:54,557
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll go around and get everybody's final thoughts and all that good stuff.

2427
02:57:54,878 --> 02:57:57,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys for listening to another week of Orange Launch Radio.

2428
02:57:57,078 --> 02:57:58,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for supporting Independent Radio.

2429
02:57:59,179 --> 02:58:07,483
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, there's a lot of fantastic podcasts out there from very hardworking independent individuals and new ones showing up every week.

2430
02:58:07,543 --> 02:58:10,684
[SPEAKER_06]: I just heard of a new one on Twitter today that makes me very excited.

2431
02:58:11,765 --> 02:58:14,387
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, just support independent broadcasting.

2432
02:58:14,467 --> 02:58:20,591
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you thought this show was awful, I don't know how you made it to the end, but thank you, at least for giving it a fair shot.

2433
02:58:21,192 --> 02:58:26,015
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you thought this show was awful, at least try another independent podcast and see if you can find the one that works for you.

2434
02:58:26,416 --> 02:58:30,699
[SPEAKER_06]: If you did like Orange Lounge Radio, all we ask, tell a friend or five about the show.

2435
02:58:31,019 --> 02:58:32,160
[SPEAKER_06]: Help us spread the word.

2436
02:58:32,280 --> 02:58:36,143
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all we got, because we don't have a big budget to advertise this or anything like that.

2437
02:58:36,423 --> 02:58:46,528
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to try at DragonCon, but otherwise we don't have TV ads we can do or magazine ads or whatever, so word of mouth helps a lot.

2438
02:58:47,529 --> 02:58:48,810
[SPEAKER_06]: You can always leave us a nice review.

2439
02:58:48,830 --> 02:58:53,632
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't had a nice five-star review on iTunes in like a year, so I would love to see some new ones.

2440
02:58:54,152 --> 02:58:54,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Love us.

2441
02:58:54,733 --> 02:58:56,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Thumbs up on Stitcher and all that helps too.

2442
02:58:56,734 --> 02:59:03,417
[SPEAKER_06]: I know a lot of people are switching to the streaming apps like TuneIn and so forth, so spreading the word and sharing the show there really helps too.

2443
02:59:03,597 --> 02:59:04,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Really appreciate it, guys.

2444
02:59:06,379 --> 02:59:07,160
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to do it, though.

2445
02:59:07,200 --> 02:59:08,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

2446
02:59:09,001 --> 02:59:10,342
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, why don't you start us off tonight?

2447
02:59:10,523 --> 02:59:13,245
[SPEAKER_15]: If I have to clean up cat puke when I get home, I will be grumpy.

2448
02:59:14,846 --> 02:59:19,290
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought is... Keys!

2449
02:59:22,320 --> 02:59:22,861
[SPEAKER_06]: I got nothing.

2450
02:59:23,081 --> 02:59:24,142
[SPEAKER_06]: And keys were sitting in front of me.

2451
02:59:24,282 --> 02:59:24,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Cents!

2452
02:59:25,983 --> 02:59:26,183
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

2453
02:59:26,483 --> 02:59:27,024
[SPEAKER_06]: What'd you send me?

2454
02:59:27,844 --> 02:59:28,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Cents.

2455
02:59:28,124 --> 02:59:28,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, cents.

2456
02:59:29,145 --> 02:59:30,806
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, like dollars and cents.

2457
02:59:31,306 --> 02:59:32,687
[SPEAKER_15]: Rob has pennies on his desk.

2458
02:59:32,707 --> 02:59:35,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, we are going insane here at the end of the show.

2459
02:59:35,409 --> 02:59:36,970
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, last but not least, your final thought.

2460
02:59:37,431 --> 02:59:39,872
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to play some more Saints Row this week.

2461
02:59:41,333 --> 02:59:42,314
[SPEAKER_08]: And on multiple platforms.

2462
02:59:43,455 --> 02:59:43,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Have fun.

2463
02:59:44,095 --> 02:59:44,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Good luck.

2464
02:59:44,495 --> 02:59:45,096
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell?

2465
02:59:45,516 --> 02:59:46,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Burn a CD.

2466
02:59:47,017 --> 02:59:48,098
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, your computer's possessed.

2467
02:59:48,118 --> 02:59:50,259
[SPEAKER_06]: Your laptop is about to take off into space.

2468
02:59:50,279 --> 02:59:51,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Can the listeners hear that?

2469
02:59:53,329 --> 03:00:04,058
[SPEAKER_08]: I was gonna say that the demon jumped from Rob's toilet into your computer I'm just tired of listening to the same CD over and over in my car so I'm burning a new one I meant to do it earlier but fair enough

2470
03:00:04,454 --> 03:00:06,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright guys, that's going to do it for tonight.

2471
03:00:06,715 --> 03:00:11,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Be sure to be here live next week, Sunday, August 25th, when we do it all over again.

2472
03:00:11,657 --> 03:00:15,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep in mind, it will be the last show for possibly three weeks.

2473
03:00:16,118 --> 03:00:16,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Possibly.

2474
03:00:16,659 --> 03:00:18,799
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to try to avert that best we can.

2475
03:00:19,120 --> 03:00:22,781
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, be here next week for that show, episode 517.

2476
03:00:23,581 --> 03:00:26,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Until then, thank you guys once again for tuning in and supporting our show.

2477
03:00:26,722 --> 03:00:27,623
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are awesome.

2478
03:00:27,863 --> 03:00:28,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a wonderful week.

2479
03:00:28,763 --> 03:00:30,964
[SPEAKER_08]: So that would mean that we're coming back on wit day now?

2480
03:00:31,624 --> 03:00:34,967
[SPEAKER_08]: So it wouldn't be the third because that's Labor Day, right?

2481
03:00:36,148 --> 03:00:36,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Right when I'm ending the show.

2482
03:00:37,208 --> 03:00:39,090
[SPEAKER_06]: We will have no show September 1st.

2483
03:00:39,230 --> 03:00:40,190
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Labor Day.

2484
03:00:40,671 --> 03:00:41,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, first that's Labor Day.

2485
03:00:42,012 --> 03:00:44,694
[SPEAKER_06]: I may be out September 8th, which I'll talk to you about off air.

2486
03:00:44,994 --> 03:00:45,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

2487
03:00:45,734 --> 03:00:47,335
[SPEAKER_06]: That would mean we would come back September 15th.

2488
03:00:47,355 --> 03:00:47,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2489
03:00:50,583 --> 03:00:51,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we would miss your birthday.

2490
03:00:51,964 --> 03:00:53,005
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no, no.

2491
03:00:53,165 --> 03:00:55,386
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not worried about that.

2492
03:00:55,507 --> 03:00:55,887
[SPEAKER_08]: The 15th.

2493
03:00:57,068 --> 03:00:58,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that when Grand Theft Auto V is out?

2494
03:00:58,889 --> 03:01:02,572
[SPEAKER_08]: It's out on the 17th.

2495
03:01:02,632 --> 03:01:06,594
[SPEAKER_15]: By the way, Rob, so next week is our last one before breaks.

2496
03:01:07,075 --> 03:01:08,376
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, it happens the week after that.

2497
03:01:08,536 --> 03:01:08,756
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

2498
03:01:09,176 --> 03:01:10,637
[SPEAKER_15]: It's my 8th year wedding anniversary.

2499
03:01:10,938 --> 03:01:11,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my gosh.

2500
03:01:12,218 --> 03:01:12,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy anniversary.

2501
03:01:13,179 --> 03:01:13,599
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2502
03:01:14,460 --> 03:01:15,080
[SPEAKER_06]: My god.

2503
03:01:15,921 --> 03:01:17,382
[SPEAKER_06]: When this show started, you weren't married.

2504
03:01:17,822 --> 03:01:18,083
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

2505
03:01:18,443 --> 03:01:18,523
Ugh.

2506
03:01:19,110 --> 03:01:19,650
[SPEAKER_06]: This show's old.

2507
03:01:20,071 --> 03:01:21,011
[SPEAKER_13]: But we were cohabiting.

2508
03:01:21,031 --> 03:01:22,933
[SPEAKER_13]: We were living in sin.

2509
03:01:23,473 --> 03:01:24,434
[SPEAKER_06]: Living in sin's the best.

2510
03:01:24,614 --> 03:01:24,974
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I love it.

2511
03:01:24,994 --> 03:01:26,976
[SPEAKER_06]: And on that note, I really am ending it now.

2512
03:01:27,036 --> 03:01:29,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody be quiet so I can play the closing song.

2513
03:01:29,337 --> 03:01:29,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Good night.

2514
03:01:30,278 --> 03:01:33,340
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2515
03:01:33,961 --> 03:01:38,184
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios.

2516
03:01:38,764 --> 03:01:45,429
