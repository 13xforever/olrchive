00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's Orange Lounge Radio, episode 516 for this, August the 18th of 2013.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We're here to talk about video games, gaming culture, gamer lifestyle with me, Rob Roberts.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm one of your hosts, and joining me as she does every Sunday night, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yo.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
How are you doing, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers?

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Or...

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And?

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
All of the above.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Whatever. You can be whoever you want to be.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Oh, um, I'll be me.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Okay. Well, you do...

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm really out of it today.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yeah?

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yeah, it's been a weird, weird week.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Are you on any prescription medications right now?

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Well, I'm always on prescription medications that keep me from killing people. On the internet.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
No, but I mean, like, are you, uh...

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
No, no Oxycontin.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Any sickness going around?

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I have the rockin pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Sorry to hear it.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
No, I'm not. That means I'm happy, I guess.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
An apparently obscure reference, uh...

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Oh, and there's Techmaster Loki. How you doing, Loki?

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm doing fine.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yeah?

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Yeah.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What's new with you?

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Um... games.

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yeah? Lots of games? We'll get to gaming weeks here shortly, but I noticed you brought a big box full of Disney Infinity with you.

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yes.

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So, um, I noticed that you were able to get the game early through your connections, and you put up a YouTube, right?

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You did, like, a little unboxing YouTube, because information on Disney Infinity's been kinda not around, really.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Like, the review embargo apparently didn't lift until today, or they didn't have early reviews or something.

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Maybe they were afraid the game wasn't gonna get good reviews, although it seems like it's doing alright from the minimal things I've seen today.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But, um, so you did this whole unboxing, you did some playing, and, uh, hilarious stuff going down on YouTube, right?

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Uh, yeah, just typical YouTube commenters, you know?

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yeah.

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Demanding, you need to tell me how you got that, or else I'm gonna report you to who?

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yeah, report it.

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
With the police.

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
He's playing this game before I have it!

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yeah, it's like, whatever, you know?

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I would've actually done some more, um, uh, like, actual, like, Let's Plays and stuff, but I just...

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I thought you did, I thought you were up on...

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Well, I did a stream on, uh, Twitch.

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yeah.

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You know, I did something that had audio problems at the beginning, because, you know.

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Dope.

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Well, it was a whole new setup, so, you know, I was trying to get it to work with my old TV and stuff, and this cable I have just didn't work correctly.

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So I ended up setting it up all differently, and then I was trying to hear audio, I was trying to split the audio going to the TV.

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So split it between the video capture card and my headset, but when I did that, it, because I needed an amp on it, when I did that, it just, there was no audio coming through at all.

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So tech issues.

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yeah, tech issues. So I ended up just listening through my computer, but, you know, the audio was lagged by a couple, like, a second or so.

61
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So it was just a little annoying.

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Well, not to, um, tap into your gaming leak too much, although I'm sure you've played plenty else besides Disney Infinity, but what did you think overall of Disney Infinity?

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's alright, um, because I hadn't really played, like, I didn't play Skylanders.

64
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Um, I checked out just, I, the beginning, I did a little, like, a couple of the tutorials, um, that walk you through some of the sandbox, or the toy box stuff.

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's okay, but you don't start off with a whole lot of pieces to build, you know, with the toy box stuff.

66
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Um, some of that you get through, like, these little power-up disc things that you can buy.

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Um, not a whole ton of that stuff. A lot of it's just kind of cosmetic, like, you know, it looks like Alice in Wonderland or Little Nemo.

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's just, it's really kind of eh.

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Um, there's, there's some pre-built stuff that you can look at, um, but a lot of it you have to play through the actual, they call them the playsets.

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yeah.

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
So, like, the story campaigns, I guess, for, you know, each of the characters.

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So I've been playing through Pirates of the Caribbean, which is alright.

73
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Um, it, I don't know, it's definitely a kid's game, so, you know, it's geared towards that.

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Well, I was gonna ask you, what did your young one think of it? Did you let him kind of watch, or?

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
He didn't really get the watch play, cause, you know, the only time I get the play is when he's gone to bed.

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yeah, and he might be a little, he might be a little too young, too.

77
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yeah, he-

78
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Like, at three, you don't really-

79
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
He doesn't really understand how to use controllers and stuff yet, but he liked the figures.

80
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
He, like, took all the cars figures and put them on this little table with his cars and stuff and was playing with them.

81
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Mm-hmm.

82
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Um, so, there's that. Um, and that's kind of how I got it, too, is cause, you know, I'd mentioned to, uh, you know, my friend at, you know, Disney, that, you know, my son was really into, like, you know, he loved Mater.

83
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I was trying to get a Mater figure is what I was trying to do, and they ended up just sending me everything to play with the Mater figures.

84
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So, the game, the cars play set, and Mater.

85
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So, what all, cause I'm having a hard time understanding, like, what all crap are they selling with this?

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Because with Skylanders, it's just the figures. That's really-

87
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Oh, no, in the Skylanders, it's not just the figures.

88
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Originally it was.

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Yeah, cause Skylanders, like, okay, so Skylanders, they have, you know, and they have a lot, and a lot of it is figures, but it's so crazy now, cause they have, like, for giants, they have the regular figures.

90
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:59,000
They have light core figures that light up when you put them on the thing. They have giant figures, and then with Swap Force, they're gonna have Swap Force figures with that.

91
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And then they have, like, adventure sets, and then they have battle sets that, you know, have figures, and they're, like, crap with it.

92
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Okay, so what all is there for Disney Infinity? Because now we've entered this world where they're not even really microtransactions, they are literally transactions.

93
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You're going into the store and buying something tangible.

94
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's physical DLC is basically what it is.

95
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
But what all is there? There's character statues, right?

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:34,000
There's characters, there's individual characters, they have character three packs, so they have a villains pack that has, uh, Davy Jones, Randy, and, uh, Syndrome, you know, from all three of the, uh, sets that are in the game.

97
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And then there's a sidekicks pack that has Mike, Mrs. Incredible, and, um, Captain Barboza.

98
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Okay, I don't even know all the packs, but you've got, you've got these characters, and then what? You've got, you've got the, the hidden discs.

99
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
We have the blind discs, or the blind packs of the power-up discs.

100
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And what do they do?

101
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Those are basically just, they have add-ons, like, little power-up add-ons for the characters, although, with the, I got two with that, and then I bought personally four because, you know, I haven't invested any money in it yet, so, you know, why not?

102
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Um, and I have yet to get any of the circular power-up discs. I've gotten all just the little, I don't know, hexagonal discs that they have.

103
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What do they do?

104
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Although I have the full, I have the full rare, so they, um.

105
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Wait, what do they do?

106
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:34,000
They unlock things in the game, so you have, like, um, it could be vehicles, like, uh, you know, Mickey's jalopy, or, you know, there's Abu, and stuff like that, or, like, guns, or, uh, cosmetic stuff, like, you know, different skins for your playset world.

107
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Because you said you had a Wreck-It Ralph one, right?

108
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yeah, it, it skins the background, like, you know, Wreck-It Ralph.

109
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Okay, so what's the difference between the characters, and then there's a thing called a playset that has the two characters. Is the playset, like, another?

110
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yeah, the playset's basically, like, a single-player campaign, if you kind of think of it. Or, well, it's a story campaign, so they have a Cars playset, and it comes with two cars with that.

111
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And then they've got the, um, what is it, the Lone Ranger playset that's got the two characters with that.

112
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But obviously, you don't have to buy all that. You can, you know, just pick what you want, because, like, you know, I have no interest in the Lone Ranger.

113
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Yeah, but surely the game incentivizes this stuff somehow.

114
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I think you get, well, the incentive, I think, is you, like, you would with, um, LittleBigPlanet would be a perfect example.

115
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Um, when you buy the add-ons for LittleBigPlanet, like DLC, you get more pieces that you can use in building your own levels. So that's the incentive, I guess.

116
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's kind of like LittleBigPlanet.

117
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Sort of.

118
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Except without the LittleBigPlanet itself.

119
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Well, you have, like, the Metal Gear stuff you can download, and the Muppets stuff you can download, but, I mean, I don't know, it's just different.

120
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's very much like LittleBigPlanet. It's like LittleBigPlanet crossed with the Lego games. It's, you know, the way I see it. It's very much like that.

121
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So, it's alright. I mean, they do, like I said, they do kind of prompt you to, like, you know, try to get you the purchase stuff.

122
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
But, I mean, Skylanders did the exact same thing, and it doesn't, I didn't run into it too much.

123
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:06,000
That's the trickiest part, though, because, especially when it's for kids, because, you know, if you have a six or seven year old that is about the right age to be doing this stuff,

124
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
you know, they're going to hit these roadblocks, and, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, I have to have it. Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy.

125
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Well, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy.

126
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
They don't have to give in to it. I mean, that's the thing.

127
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yeah, of course they're going to try it. That's like TV commercials, though. Daddy, Daddy, I want whatever's on the TV, you know.

128
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I gotta have this, you know. So, I mean, there's that, but it's not, I don't think it's a huge...

129
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You're ruining my life if you don't buy it.

130
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Like, because I played...

131
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm gonna just die.

132
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I tried both Lightning McQueen and Mater in, like, the Cars game, and it didn't seem like that they played too different. They played pretty much exactly the same.

133
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Okay.

134
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So, I don't think it's just a huge difference. Although, it was kind of funny to watch Mater, you know.

135
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So, maybe the place, you really need the play sets, and they come with characters, but maybe you don't need to buy all these extra characters.

136
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Yeah, you probably don't need to buy all these extra characters, and the places come with two characters, so it's kind of nice, like, if you wanted to co-op, like, if you have kids and stuff, and, you know, it has two characters in there.

137
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I just, you know, other than, you know, the characters that are, you know, in these play sets, there's not a whole ton else that you might want.

138
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I mean, maybe if you wanted to co-op in, like, the regular game, you probably would want to pick up at least maybe the sidekicks pack or something, so that way you have an extra set of characters you can play through each one of the play sets.

139
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Makes sense.

140
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:31,000
But, I mean, it's, you don't have to do all that stuff, and a lot of the stuff you do unlock things as you go through the game, and on top of just the toy box mode, there is a lot of customization within, like, the actual game.

141
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Like, in the Pirates of the Caribbean, so if you can pick up the actual people and throw them into the shop, you can customize what each character looks like, you can customize your ship and what the loadouts are and that and stuff, but a lot of it you have to buy with in-game money.

142
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So, like, I had, like, to upgrade my cans and stuff, I had to, you know, earn money, and it's a lot of grind to get that, but the ship combat's kinda cool.

143
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Yeah, they don't have a store you can just go into and spend 99 cents.

144
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
No, they don't have anything like that, but as far as I saw, so, yeah.

145
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Daddy, yeah, yeah, yeah, buy me! Buy me!

146
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I don't think they're gonna do anything like that, because I think that could be a big problem if, you know, all of a sudden kids racked up, you know, hundreds of dollars in online transactions.

147
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Alright, let's go to our chat room. I don't mean to neglect you folks, but you got a lot of good questions, I just wanted to let Loki get his thoughts out.

148
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And then I wanted to have a coughing fit, sorry.

149
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:29,000
We do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern on Sundays, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

150
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And we do have our chatters there at live.vognetwork.com, and let's see, some of the questions here.

151
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Tigerclaw says, do you guys think Disney Infinity could be huge this coming holiday season, given how successful Skylanders was? It could be bigger because of the Disney's name.

152
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Well, I think that's the idea, and I think a lot of, like, if this game flops, which I kinda don't think it will.

153
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I don't think it's gonna.

154
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:01,000
But if this game flops, like, Disney Interactive will close. I think that's kinda what's riding on this, for real, because they've invested a lot into this.

155
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I don't see how it could fail right now.

156
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I really don't see how it could fail either.

157
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:14,000
The figures are nice. I like the figures. Like, even if I didn't have the game and it just had the figures, I mean, the figures are nice. They'd be something I'd put up on my shelf. I mean, they look cool.

158
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I don't know. It has that going for it. And the game's not bad. And I like the whole, like, toy box mode in there. It's kinda cool where you can build your own things.

159
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:31,000
So there's that going for it. And really, like, the new Skylanders game is just kind of a very linear action game.

160
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And so, I just don't know. I don't think there's a whole lot of incentive to buy stuff for that.

161
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:43,000
E3VL wants to know what your YouTube channel is, where you had the unboxing, where he can leave nasty comment. No, I made that part up. But where can you leave that?

162
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It's just Loki O.L.R.

163
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's all one word?

164
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Yeah, just all one word.

165
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Let's see. Dartitsuya at live.vognetwork.com asks, you think the figures and discs and so forth will get to be like the pins at the Magic Kingdom? I think that's what Disney wants.

166
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Definitely. And they have rares in each one of the sets. I've got a full set and then some of the rares so far.

167
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
And I'm sure some of the Disney souvenir shops are already selling this.

168
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And they have exclusive rares. For example, they have Mike's car that's exclusive to Toys R Us right now. Toys R Us kind of does that thing. In fact, I'll actually give you some of these because I have duplicates.

169
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Woohoo! Well, I guess I'm gonna have to get the stupid game at some point. We'll see. I don't know. I was kind of trying to hold off.

170
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm gonna put my foot down and stomp and pout. I'm not gonna.

171
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Let's do a little bit of roleplay, DarkSakura. Let's do a little roleplay, okay? Let's assume that I'm your kid. Heaven help you. And that you just bought me the Disney Infinity Starter set, okay?

172
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
No, that would assume that I would have gotten you the Disney Infinity Starter set.

173
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
We're playing make-believe. We're playing make-believe. All right.

174
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yeah, but if I was being a parent, I wouldn't do it. Because I'm poor.

175
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Okay, then Uncle Loki was spoiling and bought it for me. Okay, so now I have it. All right, so here we go.

176
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Thank you, Uncle Loki!

177
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You're welcome.

178
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Mommy! Mommy, you have to buy me! Mommy, you have to buy me the cars! Mommy! Mommy, Mommy, Mommy! You have to buy it!

179
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Rob? Rob? Rob? Rob? I don't have to buy you shit. Go to your room.

180
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You little ingrate! Time out! Ten minutes in your room on time out and you're not allowed to play with any toys. You have to stare at the wall.

181
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
And then come back and tell me what you did wrong.

182
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I-O-I-O!

183
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Or you could go to the backyard and pick a Switch. That's what happened to me when I was a kid.

184
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
All right, let's see.

185
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I love you guys, chat.

186
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's live.vognotework.com. Let's see, other comments here. Back on a serious note.

187
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Black Wolf wants to know, how much story is included in the base game without buying anything else?

188
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You have the full thing for Parts of the Caribbean, The Incredibles, and Monsters U. So you have three playsets, basically.

189
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So it's like three little mini-adventures you get to play through.

190
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:09,000
They're pretty long. I mean, I've already played through about a few hours of Parts of the Caribbean. I'm not very far into it, so.

191
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
There's a lot there. A lot of content, I think.

192
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Tigerclaw wants to know, does the game actually end if you don't have all the figures? Can you just play the core game and finish it?

193
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
So you get the three little adventures.

194
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
No, the game doesn't end. You just play through everything.

195
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:35,000
There's additional missions, I think, in each game where if you have different characters you can do a little mini-game or mission or something.

196
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It definitely doesn't end. You can keep going through and playing things and unlocking stuff.

197
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Because some of the unlocks are random when you unlock things. One of them is a Tron costume for some little figure that's running around.

198
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Exactly. I wanted that, too.

199
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
That's why you bought the four things.

200
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,000
No, no. Even on the livestream, it's just like, Tron costume. Come on, come on, come on. I don't want that!

201
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Did she get a Cinderella carriage or something?

202
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
By the way, Rob, you should be really happy that I didn't break out my mom's accent.

203
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I did my momma impersonation.

204
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
We'll roleplay again sometime.

205
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Oh, girl.

206
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
But look at Jim Sally in our chatroom. Hi, Jim Sally. We haven't seen Jim Sally in a while. I hope he's doing well.

207
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Jim Sally has responsibilities.

208
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Yes. Jim Sally said, Rob's annoying kid impression is awesome. Thank you. Well, I was one of those annoying kids growing up, so there you go.

209
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'm just tapping into what I know.

210
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Anyhow, I think that's all I want to talk about Disney Infinity. Quickly, before we get into officially our gaming weeks, I guess I'm ruining it a little bit by talking about the beta that has a lot of people's attention captured this weekend.

211
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:49,000
There's actually really, there's two big betas going on right now. There's, and I'll talk about this later in the show, there's a Blizzard-related beta for their free-to-play game.

212
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,000
But there's also, that one is invite-only, and so only certain people are playing it right now in certain fan sites and so forth.

213
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:05,000
But there's an open beta going on for another game, Final Fantasy XIV, which is one I've been talking about a little bit on the show before.

214
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And we're going to talk about this by just straight up, the first version never happened. Bad figment of the imagination, not going to go talk about version one anymore.

215
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Because this is now the real Final Fantasy XIV.

216
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It almost seemed like the intro was like, we blew up that world, lol.

217
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Yeah, well he said he was inspired by World of Warcraft Cataclysm, the producer, so.

218
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:32,000
But Dark Soccer, you've been playing it, and I've been playing it. I literally, I literally played for 15 hours yesterday.

219
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
At it.

220
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
And, you know, well here's the thing.

221
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Ah, the good old days.

222
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I know, here's my justification. When was the last time I had a day like that? I couldn't tell you.

223
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Between rehearsals for local shows, between work-related stuff, between other, you know, I just have not had a day like that.

224
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
So it's really just what the doctor ordered, to sit and do nothing all day. It felt great.

225
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:03,000
The last time I did that, apart from when I had almost broken my ankle and was playing WoW for, what, 20 hours in a day, was Ragnarok Online back in the beta.

226
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I mean, seriously, when I was in the beta of that game for seven years.

227
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Oh, you haven't had like a console game come around lately that sucked you in like that?

228
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Well, when I had hand surgery, I was high on Vicodin, and played Blue Dragon, like, and almost finished the game.

229
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I think when Final Fantasy XIII first came out, I think I spent, oops, sorry, didn't mean to kick you.

230
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
PSO, good point, Brad.

231
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I think I played Final Fantasy XIII a heck of a lot. But anyway, the XIV beta's going on.

232
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You know, I'm hearing it's having its share of issues, that people are having problems when they zone, they get kicked out, and then they cannot log back in the game.

233
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Which actually, that happened to me once, but it resolved itself within 10 minutes. So I didn't really have the serious issue.

234
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:51,000
And besides full servers, once in a while, which seems to also go away after 15, 20 minutes, I'm not hearing of a lot of issues that my friends are having.

235
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
When I go over to like Reddit, or like forums, I see like, you would think the entire world's having problems, but I don't know.

236
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It sucks that people are getting locked out of this beta, but...

237
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Well, there was the Worldful thing today, and I actually went and made a character on the European server, on Shiva, just so I could see what the server lists looked like.

238
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
And there were maybe four servers that weren't blacked out.

239
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Well, the quote-unquote official server got changed at the last minute for Horde House 2.

240
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Midgarsemer is the server that we're actually playing on.

241
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:32,000
We were originally going to play on a different server, but it was so popular that they closed out new character creation, like only a couple hours after it opened, because everybody was going there.

242
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:41,000
So Shane and I had a quick discussion. It's like, alright, it's more important that we pick an open server that our friends can get on than necessarily picking a populated server.

243
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:50,000
So Midgarsemer is what we picked. Well, finally, it took a good 24 hours, but Midgarsemer filled up, too, now, and they had to actually open new worlds.

244
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
And unfortunately, people can only roll on the new worlds. They can't go to the worlds.

245
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:04,000
So I kind of think that part is a bit of a mess, that Square is going to have to figure out a solution, because why would you fucking play an MMO if you can't play it with your friends?

246
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
It gets really boring that way. I mean, we'll go make new friends, moron!

247
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Why did I stop playing WoW? Yeah, exactly. Why am I playing less and less WoW? Like, more and more people I know left.

248
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:24,000
You know, if we were, and I was actually saying something to that thing yesterday, I prefer playing Alliance to Horde, and unfortunately our Alliance guild just sort of dried up.

249
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Except for Grandpa. But you can't blame people for not having fun anymore and not enjoying the game. I mean, they left because for whatever reason they weren't having fun.

250
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I don't blame anybody, but that's why I left, because I had no one to play with that, and Pandas was kind of stupid.

251
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Pandas, as in the expansion, was, I hate the grind. Hate the grind.

252
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Well, you know, every expansion has its up and down. But anyway, so Final Fantasy XIV is going on, and despite those things, I hope they are able to institute, I think the world pass thing that they had in Final Fantasy XI actually worked out really well.

253
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Where, like, if you're friends on the server, they buy you a pass that you can use to get on. And it costs them a lot of gil, depending on how many people are already on the server.

254
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
You bought me mine? Yeah, but people will do it. People will do it.

255
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:20,000
So, anyway. Otherwise, I mean, the good news is, I'm just, God, the game is gorgeous. I love running instances with friends. There was myself, Shane, Captain Spike from Game Buoy, and TimTrip were all running.

256
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:32,000
We have the perfect layout of classes that the four of us can make a light party, and we did the beginner instances just back to back last night, and they're so fucking gorgeous. And having fun with it.

257
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Some people might criticize that the classes don't have enough abilities, and that healing is kind of like whack-a-mole because of it, but I kind of think if you're a really good healer, you can heal and DPS at the same time. It's really possible.

258
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I mean, you actually pretty much learn how to do that when you're settling your duties.

259
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:59,000
And for folks that liked Warcraft back in the very beginning, when it was minimal abilities, too, I think they might find something kind of fun in Final Fantasy XIV.

260
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:09,000
But I love it. I'm definitely buying the game when it comes out, and I will sub for at least a few months while I figure out, you know, am I going to cancel WoW to play this? Am I going to stick with this?

261
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I'm really curious to see what the end game is like, because I know a lot about Final Fantasy XIV from levels 0 to 20, because I've actually been in since the alpha, so I've done that grind like five times, 0 to 20.

262
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:32,000
And so I know a lot about it, but I don't know much about what the game is past that, and that kind of concerns me. But it could, I mean, it's only a concern. That doesn't mean it's going to be negative. I just don't know.

263
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And if the end game isn't exciting enough, it's not going to really keep me there once I get to 50.

264
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I will tell you one thing, though, is that, I mean, and you were online for a little bit of this when I went exploring in the level 30 area. It actually had a lot of really neat stuff.

265
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:59,000
There were some neat characters I've found, Costa del Sol, which you can't get to right now except by walking, because it's, the fairies are disabled, and Limsa Lominsa.

266
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Yeah, Limsa Lominsa.

267
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Limsa, that's hard to say.

268
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Just say Limsa.

269
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Which, by the way, is my favorite town so far.

270
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I love the leader of that town, the female Rogenan. She's great, and her voice acting I like the best.

271
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I'm super enjoying Arcanist. I mean, just because my carbo-glue is so cute.

272
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
It's a great class.

273
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:26,000
And I haven't had nearly the same problems I did with Thaumaturge, because Thaumaturge, well, I mean, they've also fixed the duties, but still.

274
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:36,000
But I had to say that just what I saw, there were some pretty encouraging things for stories. I think we're going to get more raid-like content and stuff like that.

275
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:49,000
It sounds like they're really going to be developing it and so forth, but if they fuck up some of these basics, like getting people who want to play together able to play together and in the same guild, if they fuck up these basics, it isn't going to matter how much they invest in the game in the end.

276
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:58,000
So I really hope, you know, but again, it's a beta. Y'all didn't pay for it this weekend, so this is the disclaimer to that.

277
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
And I know a lot of people are forming their opinions of the game based on this weekend, but it is what it is.

278
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Well, my plan for next weekend, because I've been taking it really slowly. I've been trying to sparse it out since I can't go past 20 this weekend.

279
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I'm at 14 right now and I figured that when I hit like 18, I was going to start trying weaving or something, you know, whenever.

280
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:26,000
But I've already decided that I'm probably going to be selling off some of my services so that I can afford to buy the game because it really is.

281
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I was excited. I really enjoy it. It has some of the elements I liked about Cataclysm that made me finally think WoW was fun.

282
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Because you remember how many times I started WoW and then just said, oh, boring, oh, boring, boring.

283
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:47,000
It had a lot of the fun. It had characters that made me, I laughed at my desk, I mean, especially with the moogles drinking all the wine.

284
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Did you see that bit?

285
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Yes, yes, I did.

286
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:55,000
It's so cute. Because I rolled a Lalafell this morning. A really cute little teeny Lalafell.

287
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I just, I have different things that make me laugh. I mean, the only things in WoW that really made me laugh were like the very meta stuff and the weird pop culture jokes.

288
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Like, you know, Harris Pilton and all that.

289
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Yeah. They actually, they did a little bit of pop culture jokes in 14, too, in the localization, which was a pleasant surprise.

290
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Like, one of the levels that you level up is Arcanist or Conjurer, one of them. The little achievement is called, just talk about Shaft.

291
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Yeah.

292
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Maybe it was mining. I don't know. But anyway, it's just funny.

293
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:36,000
But I've had a, well, you know, and the names of the quests have been funny. You know, I've really had a lot of fun.

294
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:43,000
And the other big thing for me is that I have really been enjoying having my friends on, you know, people to chat with.

295
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Yeah.

296
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And the fact that nobody had, you know what, I'd give you a hug for free, Jim Sally, but you have to come out here and get it.

297
00:25:51,000 --> 00:26:01,000
No, I'm doing logos for people. I'm working on a logo for a couple of people right now and making fabric art.

298
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Awesome.

299
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Yes.

300
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Well, good luck with all of that.

301
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Thank you. So I can game and pay for my habit.

302
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Pay for your obsession.

303
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
As I tap in my vein.

304
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
All right. I'm sure we'll get phone calls on Final Fantasy XIV later, but that's all we'll say on it for now.

305
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:21,000
If you do want to play with OLR people and generally VoG people, Horde House kind of snatched that and took that over.

306
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,000
We're all on the Midgarsemer server. So it will open up eventually, even if it's locked when you try to create a character.

307
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Check back in like 30 minutes, check back in an hour. And I'm sure this will be the case in early access as well.

308
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
It does open up and Midgarsemer is not supposed to be one of the super populated servers.

309
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
So you will be able to get in eventually. It just might be frustrating that you can't get in right away.

310
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:48,000
But all of us that were super eager about this game, we all got in and it's going to be too tough to move everybody at this point.

311
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
So we're going to stick it out on Midgarsemer.

312
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
So you can get more information on the Horde House, Twitter, twitter.com slash Horde House.

313
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,000
We do have a link shell set up right now called Horde House, but all a link shell is, is a fancy chat channel.

314
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Free companies are the guilds and we're going to set one of those up as soon as they open up.

315
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
And we're trying to think of a good name right now.

316
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
What we want to do is we want something where the acronym is VOG.

317
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
So it'll be something like, like Vanquishers of Garland or something.

318
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
You know, we want something that'll be VOG.

319
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Gilgamesh.

320
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Yeah.

321
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
That's very Final Fantasy like.

322
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Yeah, we're going to. So if you have some good ideas, throw them out there, especially Shane, because he'll be the one that puts it all together.

323
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I'm sure because he's going to.

324
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Verp of gastritis.

325
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
But yeah, we're looking at something where the abbreviation will be VOG.

326
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
So just to kind of tie it together. Be fun.

327
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
So. All right.

328
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Let's see. Codeman says in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

329
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Like I asked before, if you roll on that server when live, will you still be on that server?

330
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Yes, the characters are not supposed to delete between open beta and live at this point.

331
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
If there is a huge game breaking bug, they may still erase them.

332
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Although, although I don't know, because of all these issues people are having, maybe that'll be justification for them to erase them.

333
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I hope not.

334
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
But this is why everybody was very much about like they wanted to get on the server.

335
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
They want to get on because this is your real character now that you're going to have in the main game.

336
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
So we'll see. So.

337
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Bobby said very old gamers.

338
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
That would mostly be accurate. We'll see.

339
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
All right. Technus in chat says, if you can't think of a name, find a Latin phrase.

340
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,000
You know, you don't know how many Warcraft guilds that worked for.

341
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
And Final Fantasy 11 to be fair.

342
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
All right. Geeklet in our chat room says they might have to wipe the server to fix that dumb error.

343
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
That is a distinct possibility.

344
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
So we all have to kind of be prepared for that.

345
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,000
That's why I kind of, I leveled my, and we'll wrap up this discussion guys.

346
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I knew when we get to the other games.

347
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I leveled one of my jobs to like 18 and another one to 13 and then did some crafting stuff.

348
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
And so if they wiped them all, I would be kind of mad.

349
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,000
But at the end of the day, that's the reason why I stopped playing too and I'm not going to play anymore.

350
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I logged out and am getting my rest bar because if they do wipe it, then fine.

351
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
You know, I'll just, I'll deal with it.

352
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
That's kind of my logic too.

353
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Well, and there's the other thing too, is that I'm probably going to stick with just caster classes for a while because,

354
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:22,000
and I love this so much over some of the stuff they did in 11 is that your gear will carry over to multiple classes.

355
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
It's nice.

356
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Yeah. And I can keep using my leather gear in a, like as a gladiator or whatever, if I wanted to.

357
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
So I wouldn't have to, cause I sold all my old gear. Oops.

358
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
All right. Anyhow, let's talk about officially our gaming week.

359
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
So besides Disney infinity, besides Final Fantasy 14, what kind of games have you been playing this week?

360
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Is there anything else, Rob?

361
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
No. And clearly I'm playing Animal Crossing right now.

362
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
My village is open.

363
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
What if people want to add you, be your friend on 3DS so they can visit during the show?

364
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
How do they do that?

365
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Well, I'd have to add them back.

366
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:02,000
So, um, I might close and then reopen in part B so I can put out my friend code cause I don't memorize it.

367
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
So be here live, live.vognetwork.com Sunday nights.

368
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Yeah, that's how you get it. You have to be here live.

369
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Yeah, that's how you're going to get it.

370
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Um, unless, unless one of you guys, like I know Actideft has it.

371
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,000
See, I would point you to the friend code thread at vognetwork.com, but I know Jamie doesn't check it.

372
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I posted it.

373
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Oh, did you?

374
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I posted there.

375
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
So Rob, thank you for your assumptions. Geez.

376
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I never, I'm never happier to be wrong.

377
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I'm so insulted.

378
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Oh, get over it.

379
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
You know what? Okay.

380
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Um, I played some Mass Effect 3 because I am still working on trying to get a custom texture and not texture, a custom mesh to work,

381
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
but unfortunately it's not using any of the default textures in it.

382
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
And I hate using text mod with Mass Effect 3, so I'm just sort of like, bleh.

383
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Um, I am also, I've, what did I play? Oh yeah, I played more Fractal.

384
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I'm back to playing Fractal because that is my game that I play when my brain is too busy.

385
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Like if I have all these thoughts that I just want to get out of my head, I completely blank out and play Fractal.

386
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
It's such a good game.

387
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I've also, um, I got Dan DuckTales and I got myself a copy.

388
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I haven't touched it yet, but basically I've been watching Dan play through the whole thing and humming along with the music because it's so good.

389
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
And he found an 8-bit music mode, so he was super happy and playing through it with that.

390
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Um, I played some other stuff. What did I play?

391
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Oh yeah, this, well I went to Scandia this morning because we went to breakfast and then played mini golf, which, it's 102 today,

392
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
and it was already like 90 something at 11 this morning, so I was like, I'm not having any more of that.

393
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I've got a sunburn, but I went inside and, poor Scandia, I met a person who works there named Danny, who apparently owns two DX machines, several of them,

394
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,000
and a Pump It Up and a DDR and a Poppin' Music and has like the actual arcade cabinets. He showed me photos of them.

395
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I was like, I'm going to be friends with you.

396
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Actually it was really cool and he was fixing one of the machines that I lost some tokens to.

397
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
You know what's funny? I think I've heard of this guy. Somebody was telling me about-

398
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I'm on his Facebook now.

399
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Somebody was telling me about a friend, a friend of a friend or something here, who had a bunch of those cabinets in their house.

400
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Yeah, it's, um, I forget. He has an arcade in his garage.

401
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Yeah, that might have been him. So, but anyway, he was really nice.

402
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Apparently he's a legend around here.

403
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Well, he was a really nice guy. We chatted about games, we talked about pinball for a little while, and, um, yes, 2DX.

404
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Seanigan. It's Seanigan. That's what it was.

405
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Well, I just, he let me add him on Facebook, so it was really cool.

406
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Um, so anyway, uh, we, uh, I don't know, Misty. I didn't ask. I just saw pictures.

407
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Um, so anyway, uh, he fixed the machine that I was on and we, you know, chatted about-

408
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
The 2DX marquee, the big speaker setup, is on top of the ticket cage.

409
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Not the ticket cage, the, where you buy your, um, your mini golf stuff inside the arcade.

410
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Um, so sitting in a Raiden Fighters cabinet was actually a DonPachi, which I was like, it's a copy of DonPachi.

411
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,000
It's an arcade one, so I played it and the right side was broken, but the second side worked fine, and I played Guitar Hero.

412
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,000
And Dan played Crazy Taxi because some kid kept, uh, putting in, uh, tokens.

413
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Crazy money?

414
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Let's make some crazy money! Yeah.

415
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
So, um, hi Brad. Brad just arrived in Normandy.

416
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,000
So anyway, um, we, uh, you know, we're basically going around just playing all kinds of different games.

417
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
They had to pump it up. I didn't know that they'd gotten to pump it up.

418
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:39,000
But, uh, there were, I was a little dismayed. I mean, I shouldn't have been surprised.

419
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:47,000
They have no more pinball. Um, all the ticket games, of course, were in perfect condition, but the Tekken 5 had no monitor in it.

420
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:56,000
There was another game that had no monitor in it. The, um, X-Men vs. Street Fighter had, like, such bad, um, burn-in.

421
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
The monitor was, like, green. It was really in bad shape.

422
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Um, I played some Silent Scope. A little Dark Silhouette because that one was really the best of them.

423
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Um, then, uh, I really did play a lot of stuff this week, relatively.

424
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Uh, you've loaned me Kid Icarus Uprising, which I started and then had to put down because the cat threw up.

425
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
That's a shitty, that's a crappy reason to stop playing a game.

426
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
No, it's a barfy reason.

427
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Um, she threw up on Dan's chair. I was so mad.

428
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Alright.

429
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:34,000
She's such a brat. Um, so, yeah, uh, and I was gonna start, um, Birth by Sleep, but I barred it from my friend.

430
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I was like, I'm already playing too much. I just gave it back to her.

431
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Alright, is there anything else you actually played or is this all thought about playing?

432
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Well, no, it's, I started stuff.

433
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Oh, and Final Fantasy VII, but I just cannot play it with keyboards, so fuck it. I'm gonna find the controller somewhere.

434
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Get those trading cards somewhere. Oh, wait, Final Fantasy VII doesn't have trading cards, so.

435
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I don't even give a shit about the trading cards thing.

436
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I played Magic for five years. I'm kinda over card games.

437
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Alright, Loki, uh, how was your gaming week?

438
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Um, it didn't play a whole ton of stuff other than Disney Infinity and Saints Row IV.

439
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,000
So I played a lot of Saints Row IV in the last couple days here and it's, it's fun.

440
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Um, you know, definitely a lot different than Saints Row III with the whole superpower thing.

441
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Um, at the same time, some of the, you know, challenges that are in the game, the actual stuff you have to do to get some experience and stuff,

442
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:34,000
like driving a car for like a long distance and stuff, seems like it's gonna be kind of difficult to do that since you don't,

443
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:40,000
there's really no need to drive a car since you can run super fast and jump over buildings and fly.

444
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:46,000
So that's kind of the only annoying thing is that there's not really a point to the cars at all.

445
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Um, there was one little, I don't know if it's a glitch, but a design flaw, if I were to call it,

446
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:02,000
where when you're buying stuff at a store, if people happen to be attacking you, it will kick you out of the menu that you're in.

447
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:08,000
So like I was in Friendly Fire buying, I was actually messing with the dubstep gun, looking at all the different designs.

448
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Dubstep gun?

449
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Yeah, the dubstep gun.

450
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Does it wub wub?

451
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Yes it does. All the different designs that they had in there for that because they had different dubstep tracks that it would play,

452
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
and so I was cycling through those, and unfortunately, you know, that got my wanted level up a little bit,

453
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:30,000
and so I went back into the store and I was trying to cycle through to the next, you know, one, and it kept kicking me out of the menu.

454
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Now I'm like, what the hell is going on? Why am I getting kicked out of the menu?

455
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:39,000
So then I went back into it again and got kicked out of the menu again, and so then I saw that I was getting shot by a cop.

456
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
So it's kind of dumb that they had that.

457
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I understand that, yeah, you can't hide in stores anymore to drop your notoriety,

458
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
but at the very least they should pause the game when you're in a menu

459
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:58,000
because it's kind of dumb that you can't browse the menu while you're, you know, in the middle of a fight.

460
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I mean, I don't see why you would, why they should do that, but whatever, that's their choice.

461
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
So that was a little annoying.

462
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I did find a couple hidden weapons in the game.

463
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:15,000
They have the penetrator, the giant dildo bat hidden in the game.

464
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Oh no, it's back.

465
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
It's back, yes.

466
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Well, they also have a tentacle bat, and they also have an anal probe that has a tongue on it.

467
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
That's awesome.

468
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Wow.

469
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
And it makes licking motions when you're in it.

470
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
So that's kind of funny.

471
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
So they've got that, y'all need Jesus.

472
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,000
And then some of the, like, weapon skins they have in there are kind of dumb,

473
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
so I didn't really mess with a whole ton of that stuff.

474
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
But I have, like, a lot of the upgrades are kind of cool.

475
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I just, it felt like I don't really like the whole having to pick health pickups,

476
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
having to gather health pickups instead of having just a regenerating health,

477
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
which has been in the game forever, but they decided to switch it up.

478
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
It's not a huge deal, but it's kind of annoying.

479
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I'm trying to think of anyone else.

480
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
So far, the story's kind of fun.

481
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I haven't really played a whole bunch of the story missions yet, but it was funny.

482
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
There was moments that I was laughing out loud.

483
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I love the new, like, the third had, like, these wrestling moves you could do

484
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
if you hold down sprint and, you know, hit one of the attack buttons.

485
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Well, now they have, like, super powered attacks, and they're just goddamn ridiculous,

486
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
like, throwing people up there and just, like, stomping on their skull

487
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
and just ridiculous stuff in the game.

488
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
So I kind of dig that.

489
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
And then what else?

490
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
So I've been playing an Xbox 360.

491
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I just preloaded my Steam copy, so I'm looking forward to that.

492
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
So I'll be playing this for a while until Grand Theft Auto V comes out.

493
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
And then all bets are off.

494
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
It's just going to be Grand Theft Auto until I die.

495
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
We'll talk about Grand Theft Auto V and your excitement a little later in the show,

496
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
but anything else for your gaming week?

497
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
That was it.

498
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Okay.

499
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
The only game I'll talk about besides Final Fantasy XIV earlier

500
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
is another game that I played this week was DuckTales Remastered,

501
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
which Dark Soccer already brought up.

502
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I played it on Wii U, actually.

503
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I just decided, you know what, I'm going to take a leap of faith

504
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
and see what the Wii U version might have to offer

505
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
that the 360 and the PS3 ones wouldn't have with the second screen.

506
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,000
It did take me a little while to figure out that you can actually get the map

507
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
on the second screen while you're playing.

508
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,000
It's not just a carbon copy of the game, which is what it defaults to,

509
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
but the game doesn't really tell you how to do it.

510
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I kind of had to figure it out.

511
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
So the trick is, just in case anyone else gets it on Wii U,

512
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
when you pause the game like you would see the map normally,

513
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
hit the X button, and then the map will take up the whole bottom screen

514
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
and stay that way when you're playing, which is cool.

515
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Although, let's be real, DuckTales never really had complicated maps.

516
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
The only reason I needed it was because of all the little mini missions they put in.

517
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Sometimes you need to find all the coins or whatever.

518
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
It helps me be able to find everything.

519
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
And know where I've been and where I haven't.

520
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
That's kind of helpful.

521
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Did you notice that they did change a few things around?

522
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Oh, God, yes.

523
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
There's that new level in the beginning, and then they totally changed the end,

524
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
where in the NES game, you used to go back to Transylvania,

525
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
and that's where you would fight the last boss.

526
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
But in this one, they made a whole new level.

527
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Spoiler, sorry, but come on.

528
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
They made a new level, Mount Vesuvius, that you play instead,

529
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
which is kind of like inside a volcano, so it's very different

530
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
and much harder in difficulty than the base levels.

531
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:43,000
More spoiler alert, after the final boss, there's a Metroid-esque escape element.

532
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,000
That was definitely controller-throwing frustration.

533
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Luckily, I own a Wii U, so I wasn't about to throw that controller.

534
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
But thought about it.

535
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I heard plenty of screaming.

536
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Yeah, Alan could tell you all about it.

537
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
He was here when I was playing through it.

538
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
So that was fun.

539
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
So the game itself, when it was like the game modes, is great.

540
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
The soundtrack is amazing.

541
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
The graphics look great.

542
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I love the redone sprites.

543
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Cartoony has a great look.

544
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Honestly, my biggest problem with DuckTales,

545
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
and I really feel horrible saying this, but it was the voice acting,

546
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,000
and not the talent, because it's the original talent doing it,

547
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
and they're great, even though it's showing its age a little bit.

548
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I didn't mind that.

549
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
What I did mind is that it constantly interrupted the action

550
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
in what is supposed to be a fast game.

551
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
And although after you play through the whole thing once,

552
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
you can skip cut scenes later on,

553
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
it's still really annoying that you're going through the game

554
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
and then, oh, stop, cut scene.

555
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Oh, stop, cut scene.

556
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
And I get that if you have kids or whatever,

557
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
they're going to eat it up.

558
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
They're going to love it.

559
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
If you love the old 90s show, it's great.

560
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
You're going to love it.

561
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
But I don't know.

562
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I kind of got over it pretty quick,

563
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
and I just wanted to play the game,

564
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
and that experience kept getting interrupted every five seconds.

565
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
And that was one thing I loved about the original game.

566
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
It was this game you could really speed run

567
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,000
and beat the whole thing in not even an hour maybe if you're good.

568
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
So I don't know.

569
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I did not like that whole stop-and-go element,

570
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
and here's what really pissed me off.

571
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:25,000
The quality of the audio is atrocious.

572
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Was it?

573
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Not the music.

574
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
The music's great.

575
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
The voice acting audio quality, horrible.

576
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Scrooge sounds like he's coming through an iPhone.

577
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
It sounded really clear on the PC.

578
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
It might be a Wii U thing.

579
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,000
It could be, but I heard the same thing from somebody who played it on 360.

580
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
It's a console thing, man.

581
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Maybe it is a console thing.

582
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I don't know, but the quality of the sound itself was really bad,

583
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
especially the worst is when you're going through,

584
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
and he gets hit or whatever, and he'll go,

585
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
oh, ouch, things like that.

586
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
It gets drowned out by the music.

587
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
It sounds really out of place.

588
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
It gets really repetitive.

589
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
It's horrible.

590
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:09,000
So, yeah, not a fan of that.

591
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
So when I was actually playing the game DuckTales Remastered,

592
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I was having a great time.

593
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
I could have done without all the other crap, sorry to say.

594
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
There was one other thing I wanted to say about DuckTales.

595
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Oh, I will say this, and I know this has got to be unique to the Wii U.

596
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I kind of think it was a lazy port, which shouldn't be a surprise whatsoever,

597
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,000
but speaking of sound design, there was no...

598
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
They did not sync up the sound coming out of the Wii U game pad

599
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
and the sound coming out of the TV.

600
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
So if you're sitting in front of the TV and you're playing it on the game pad

601
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
and the volume's up in the TV, you definitely hear a delay in the audio,

602
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
and it's really annoying.

603
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
There's a delay in the audio coming out of the game pad versus the TV

604
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,000
and in the music, so it's like everything's just the slightest bit off.

605
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I had to mute the game pad.

606
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I cannot play the game with sound on the game pad.

607
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
So that's a little bit annoying, because the Nintendo games don't have that problem.

608
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
They're all synced up just fine.

609
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,000
So I think that's just a lazy port problem, but it is what it is.

610
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
You know, I mean, I'm just saying overall in terms of the voices,

611
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I didn't notice a problem at all on the PC.

612
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
So I might have to stream it when I'm playing through it

613
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
just to see if anything comes across.

614
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
It could also just be taste and maybe, you know,

615
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
not to say you don't have an ear for this dark soccer,

616
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
but having done audio editing for all these years doing the show,

617
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I just can hear it, and I go, my God, where did they take this guy?

618
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Because he sounds awful.

619
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
After the show, I'd like to hear yours, because I can tell you if there's a difference.

620
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Okay. Sounds good. We'll arrange that.

621
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Okey-dokey. That's it. That's all I wanted to say about my gaming week.

622
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Everything else I played was too brief and nothing really new.

623
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
So let's get into housekeeping so we can get into news.

624
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I want to talk about Dragon Con a little bit.

625
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
There's not going to be a show over Labor Day weekend.

626
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
I don't know if I should say this.

627
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
There may not be a show the week after either.

628
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I didn't get a chance to tell you yet why. I'll tell you off air.

629
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I will know next week, and it's something I can't control.

630
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,000
So I'll tell you off air why, but we'll talk about that later.

631
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Dark Sakura and Loki may put something else together.

632
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
We have to figure all that out because I got something dropped on me.

633
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
I will know next week for sure.

634
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
You definitely will not be here Labor Day.

635
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
And the reason why I won't be here Labor Day weekend is because

636
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
I'm going to be at Dragon Con, which I'm really excited about.

637
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I'm going to have a fun time. I'm sad Dark Sakura and Loki can't come with me,

638
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000
but I'll have fun for the three of us at Dragon Con.

639
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
And if you want to come see me at Dragon Con,

640
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:48,000
probably the best time to do that would be to come to the VOG Super Show panel,

641
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,000
which is going to be Saturday night at 5.30 as part of the podcasting track.

642
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
So definitely come see that. Saturday night at 5.30 is the VOG Super Show.

643
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Not just me, Bobby Black Wolf, Pod Culture.

644
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Travis Donovan's going to be there. One of the Critical Myth guys is there.

645
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I hope I'm not forgetting anybody.

646
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
So it'll be a whole bunch of us that do shows at VOG,

647
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,000
and possibly some surprises in store during that panel.

648
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
That's all I can say.

649
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Like magical plane tickets for me.

650
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Well, and you get a car, and you get a car. No, nothing like that.

651
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
If you miss me Saturday night, because, I don't know, there's something else going on,

652
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
a good time to find me would be Monday at 11.30.

653
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
There's a streaming podcast panel.

654
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Bobby's going to be a part of that, so I will be there just to support.

655
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
And, you know, me too. I do a streaming podcast.

656
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
So I'll be there. That would be your second chance to see me.

657
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
But then I fly out of town Monday night, so if you don't see me Monday at 11.30,

658
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
you probably missed me. Just saying.

659
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
So I will remind you of that next week during the last show before Dragon Con.

660
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Just saying.

661
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Otherwise, friend us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

662
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,000
We're also on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

663
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Let's go to our news tonight.

664
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Loki, why don't you start us off?

665
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Alright.

666
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:12,000
So, there's been a lot of changes for the Xbox One for sure since the original announcement.

667
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,000
They're trying to fix what people didn't like.

668
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
And so here's another notch to add to that.

669
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:28,000
The Xbox One will no longer require the Kinect to be plugged in in order for the system to work.

670
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
That's right. You can play with the system unconnected from the Kinect.

671
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:39,000
However, if you're going to play a game that requires the Kinect, then obviously you have to plug it in.

672
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:44,000
But they are still including it in the box.

673
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:53,000
And right now, it's not something that they're going to be putting in a separate SKU or something without the Kinect.

674
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
So it's still going to be $4.99.

675
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
It still has the Kinect in the box.

676
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Alright. And then the other thing.

677
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Xbox One controllers.

678
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,000
I know I'm interested in getting one just for PC at the very least.

679
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:12,000
You can get one for PC, but the drivers aren't coming out until 2014.

680
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:20,000
And basically, as we've stated, the Xbox One controller, although it looks similar in many ways, shares no underlying technology with the current Xbox 360.

681
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:30,000
New wireless protocol combined with the ability to work in wired mode and additional features like impulse triggers, means software has to be written and optimized for the PC.

682
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:38,000
However, this week there was a big announcement for Call of Duty showing off the multiplayer.

683
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
And the game was being played on PC with Xbox One controllers.

684
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:50,000
So those dumb fucks have the drivers, but they're making excuses so that if you really want to play with that controller, you better buy an Xbox One.

685
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Just playing devil's advocate, could they have been developed third party? Could it be a Joy to Key situation?

686
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:06,000
No, it's not because it was on a PC version of the game because they were able to go in the options and there was an enable gamepad option on there.

687
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Why would you purposely delay the release of the drivers?

688
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Because people then, oh I want to get the Xbox One experience with Call of Duty and Battlefield, I'm just going to buy the PC versions and I don't need to buy a next gen console for that.

689
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:29,000
So what they're trying to do is trying to get the sync in so all these people that really need to have that controller are going to buy, you know.

690
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:37,000
I would think you just pull, yank the 360 controllers off the market, well I guess you really can't do that when you're still selling the console.

691
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Because I was going to say, for the PC people, make that not an option, they have to get the Xbox One.

692
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:49,000
It's not a huge deal because I mean, all you're really getting is those impulse control, the impulse triggers or whatever, so I guess they have to build that in.

693
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:57,000
But it's still kind of stupid, I don't know why they would do that, but whatever, you know, that's their decision then I guess I just won't buy another controller.

694
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Not that I really need one anyways.

695
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Are you getting the one at launch at this point? I didn't think you were.

696
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I'm not planning on getting one at all at the moment.

697
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,000
And I'm still kind of on the fence with the PlayStation 4 just because of Grand Theft Auto 5.

698
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Just because the launch lineup is not that strong, I mean there's a kill zone which looks cool, but it's not really a game I'm interested in.

699
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Like I've played some of the other kill zone games and it's just not my thing.

700
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,000
If it was a Resistance game or something, that might be a whole different story because I'm a real big fan of Resistance.

701
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
But kill zone I'm not a huge fan of, Drive Club I'm kind of eh.

702
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,000
And NAC, I just really don't care about that.

703
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Infamous looks great, so I'd definitely pick up Infamous next year, but I still might.

704
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I still may pick one up just because I already have my pre-order in with Amazon.

705
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
We'll see, we'll see what they announce this week and stuff.

706
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Maybe they'll announce that there's a packing game or something like that.

707
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
That might sweeten the deal a little bit.

708
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:00,000
GameGuru also has a good point in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com when it comes to this Call of Duty ghosts and all this.

709
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
GameGuru says people could just stick with a 360 controller.

710
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
That's true, you could.

711
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:10,000
So that would seem really ridiculous that they would hold back the drivers for that reason you're saying.

712
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Because if somebody really wants to have a console experience on a PC or whatever,

713
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,000
If you really want to play controller on the PC, then just yeah, use the 360 controller.

714
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Exactly, but my point is, so they have the drivers available, so their reasoning behind it is,

715
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Oh, we have to develop new drivers is a bunch of bullshit because those drivers are available.

716
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:32,000
And yes, I can understand if it was running on an Xbox One dev kit that happened to be a PC.

717
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Okay, I understand that that's a little different, but this was a PC version of the game because they saw the PC options in there.

718
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,000
And, you know, maybe it's a PC version of the game that they're gonna port to the Xbox One.

719
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I have no fucking clue, but the drivers do exist in some form, whether it be developer only or whatever.

720
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,000
But it's not that hard to develop drivers for a controller. I mean, come on.

721
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Yeah, it wouldn't seem like it's that.

722
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,000
I would think if anything, I'm thinking probably you'd see a third party solution from some hackers.

723
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Is there gonna be a USB plugged in version?

724
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Well, that's the thing. The controller has a battery pack that you can put in there.

725
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:12,000
And when you plug it in, it shuts off the radio for the wireless. So it acts like a wired controller.

726
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
This is like a PlayStation 3 controller.

727
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Yeah. Okay. Sort of. Yeah.

728
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Sort of. Okay.

729
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:22,000
All right. Well, speaking of Xbox One, some changes with the launch of the Xbox One.

730
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:30,000
And that is certain countries kind of got screwed with the launch because Xbox One was originally going to launch in 21 different countries.

731
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:41,000
However, Microsoft in a blog post said that goal was too aggressive and that Xbox One will only be available in 13 territories this November.

732
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:47,000
So Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Sweden, Switzerland, you got screwed.

733
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
So you will get the console in 2014 instead.

734
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
You know what? Russia earned it.

735
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,000
That's a whole nother Oprah.

736
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Being dickish.

737
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Bad chip yields is what has that they can't make enough to cover all those countries.

738
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Maybe they're just trying to fortify their position in the countries that they know that they can do well in.

739
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
But it's still kind of lame.

740
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
I mean, I understand why they're doing it.

741
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:21,000
But at the same time, you know, especially like I would it's I'm surprised that they're not trying to make more headway in Japan.

742
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
They just like.

743
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Oh, they we've written it up. They have written off Japan.

744
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Literally, you know, for the Xbox 360.

745
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
We're definitely not going to try any harder.

746
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Maybe maybe I shouldn't say that because they are supposed to be doing Tokyo Game Show.

747
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,000
They're trying to build buzz somehow over there.

748
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
And who knows what they're keeping in their hat to show at Tokyo Game Show.

749
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:48,000
You know, that maybe would be something, you know, you never know what type of studio they pulled together to create a very, you know, Japanese RPG or something.

750
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Although I guess they tried that on 360 and it didn't totally pan out, although I loved Lost Odyssey.

751
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
That was a hugely neglected 360 game.

752
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
That is amazing if you love JRPGs.

753
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
But then Blue Dragon was kind of well, it had its fans.

754
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Jamie loved it. I thought it was.

755
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
I was high on Vicodin, Rob.

756
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,000
I mean, it was cool, you know, and I always like Toriyama's art style.

757
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
I mean, dude designed Chrono Trigger.

758
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,000
But anyway, my point is, you don't know what they're what rabbit they're going to pull out of their hat at Tokyo Game Show.

759
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,000
So maybe I shouldn't say they've written off Japan, but it sure feels like it sometimes.

760
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
IkumaJP says we don't care.

761
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:32,000
And well, and you guys clearly have shown that through the Xbox 360, which, you know, fair is fair.

762
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Anyhow, just quickly, these are the territories that will get Xbox One.

763
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Spain, United Kingdom, United States, New Zealand.

764
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I'm glad Germany's on there because that'd be really awkward to make an announcement.

765
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Hey, this console will be launching this year.

766
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Oh, wait. No, not for you guys.

767
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,000
All right. Anyhow, going on to Xbox One.

768
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Now, here's the thing that well, let's assume it wasn't coming out in Germany for whatever reason and might actually be OK.

769
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
And these countries that want one bad enough.

770
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Guess what? The Xbox One games are no longer going to be region locked.

771
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Sorry.

772
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
The Xbox One games will not be region locked.

773
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:24,000
So in an interview with Eurogamer, Xbox One, they said when the console launches this November, we will support the Xbox One in 13 markets.

774
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Xbox One may be used in all countries, including the non-launched markets.

775
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,000
In addition, Xbox One games are not region locked.

776
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Any Xbox One game purchases retail can be used in any country on any Xbox.

777
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,000
That was that was part of their original 180 flip thing that that was going to happen.

778
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Well, clarify that, you know, even with this change in the 13 lineups, if you live in one of the eight affected countries, you could get around it and still have a good experience with Xbox One.

779
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,000
So this is good, though.

780
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Yeah, I'm glad that I'm glad everybody's going region free.

781
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:07,000
I mean, this is the obvious answer. Who's still region locked? Only Nintendo at this point.

782
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Tis tusk.

783
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
And the sad thing was, they were sort of on region locked.

784
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Yeah, they were going that way.

785
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Yes, they're like, I think maybe the 3DS is because they couldn't really figure out their marketplace too well.

786
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:26,000
And so, you know, they didn't know how to, I guess, make the purchase in the region free or something.

787
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
And so because of that, that might be why it's locked down.

788
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
I don't know. Maybe because of piracy.

789
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,000
But it's whatever.

790
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
All right, well, lots and lots of Xbox One news this week.

791
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:47,000
And a lot of folks going, it's Xbox 180, Xbox reverse and course, which, you know, I am impressed that they are doing this.

792
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,000
And there's even more to come, I think. Well, no, I guess you...

793
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Was there more later? I thought we had one more Xbox story.

794
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Well, anyway, just by everything you're saying about, you know, the Kinect and the controllers and, you know, the region locking and all that stuff.

795
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,000
You know, Xbox is giving people what they wanted and it's kind of impressive.

796
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I thought originally after E3 it wasn't going to happen this fast.

797
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Let's not forget, Don Mattrick's not running things anymore either.

798
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
So there's definitely been a change in how things are being run.

799
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:23,000
And whether that's coming, you know, at his former level or a higher level, who knows.

800
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:32,000
So, yeah, and I'm not sure how much more they're going to really be able to do, like, especially with like the price and, you know, doing a SKU without Kinect to drop the price.

801
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:39,000
I don't think that's going to happen because the whole point of having Kinect in there is they want to make sure that all the developers are going to be utilizing it.

802
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:48,000
And if you take that out, then it's going to basically it's just going to make it pointless because you're going to have stuff not utilizing it.

803
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
But at the same time, though, I don't think they utilize it that well.

804
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,000
I mean, hell, all the games they showed at E3 didn't use Kinect.

805
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,000
I mean, they may have supported it, but they sure as hell didn't demonstrate Kinect.

806
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:08,000
The one thing I liked most about Kinect was the whole people calling each other to talk during TV shows, which I know is a really weird feature to like.

807
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:14,000
But I thought that was kind of cool and something I could actually see myself utilizing, depending on the show and depending on the person.

808
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:22,000
So I like that. And knowing that all the Xbox One users will have one will make it so that more there's more people available to call or whatever.

809
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Do you have an iPhone?

810
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Yes.

811
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Do you know people have an Android phone?

812
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Yes.

813
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
You know, those have Skype on them.

814
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
They do.

815
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
And they're free.

816
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000
There's something about having it right there on the TV, though. I don't know.

817
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:43,000
You know, you have a point, but the tablet stuff can be weird sometimes because the camera's, you know, pointing and I'm trying to watch a show, you know.

818
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
How many people do you actually FaceTime with?

819
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,000
No one.

820
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Yeah, there's like two people I ever call on FaceTime.

821
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,000
My mom.

822
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Yeah. Do you really?

823
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:58,000
When my mom got her iPhone, because it was given to her, she's like, I need to learn everything on this, so you better.

824
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I was like, Mom, do you know what FaceTime is?

825
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
What's that?

826
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
So we FaceTime from time to time.

827
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:11,000
I just, I mean, it sounds like a cool feature, but at the same time, it was like, hey, Twitter and Facebook sound like cool features on the Xbox 360.

828
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:17,000
I can check my Twitter feed and my Facebook, and then, no. It's just, it's not.

829
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:26,000
All right, Game Guru in Chat says, it is rather admirable that Microsoft is actually reversing their horrible, horrible idea, though they never should have had it in the first place.

830
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:38,000
I'll tell you what, though, having, you know, tried streaming this week and stuff, I am definitely looking forward to the console, you know, recording and streaming functionality of both consoles, so I think that's pretty awesome.

831
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:44,000
It's just, you know, I don't know, just anything to make it easier would be fantastic.

832
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
All right, let's move on to another article.

833
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,000
All right, well, I don't know how people are going to feel.

834
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:57,000
So for anyone who has been looking into Xenoblade Chronicles, of course, it's an exclusive at GameStop.

835
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Well, they are pretty much defending how much they're charging for it.

836
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Basically, it's 90 bucks, and when they were contacted, they said that they use feedback from their PowerUp members to see what titles they want to bring back.

837
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:22,000
And, you know, talking about Xenoblade Chronicles, and that they basically were saying that the price is competitive, it's based on market value, and people will pay it.

838
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:28,000
And then they say, and then they say, but our PowerUp Pro members always receive a 10% discount, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

839
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:34,000
So they're basically like, we can charge it, screw you, pretty much.

840
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,000
I mean, I don't work for GameStop, but I'm saying, that's what it sounds like.

841
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:45,000
You know what's funny is last week, we were talking about something else related to this whole thing, and I said, I even said in joking,

842
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
oh, the good news is all these copies of Xenoblade are going back to GameStop.

843
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:57,000
I did not realize that it was under this fucking, this outrageous pricing scheme that they're giving to us.

844
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
It's ridiculous.

845
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:09,000
I can understand that there's an actual shortage on the game and stuff, and that it's rare, and that maybe the, you know, I know eBay people might be charging more money for, you know, used copies of it because it's harder to find now.

846
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:16,000
But they fucking reprinted this shit, opened them up, and they're selling them as used, and like, look at all these rare copies.

847
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,000
For 90 bucks.

848
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Yes, for $90.

849
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:24,000
And all of a sudden, you know, all of a sudden, all of the stores happen to have copies of it.

850
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Yeah, that's very coincidental that all of a sudden, all the stores have copies, and they're used copies that happen to also still have unredeemed, was it Nintendo Club codes in there.

851
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Oh, that's so, so convenient.

852
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:53,000
I'm gonna say something that I'm probably gonna regret saying, but this is my honest-to-God reaction when I hear this stuff, and maybe this is just the, you know, I don't know, the Les Miserables revolution person in me or whatever.

853
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,000
But honest-to-God, Xenoblade is a, exactly, right?

854
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Xenoblade is a great game, and you should pirate it so you can play it.

855
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
That is what I'm gonna say.

856
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
You should pirate Xenoblade so you can play this game because it's great.

857
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,000
And it's, there's instructions on how to mod your Wii out there.

858
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:15,000
It was on a bunch of sites when the game was only out in the UK, but you know what?

859
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Nintendo restricting its release to only, you know, GameStop, and they no longer sell it on their shop.

860
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:25,000
If Nintendo was selling it on their shop, I'd say, oh great, you should definitely support it by going to buy this game on Nintendo.

861
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:32,000
But if this is what they're gonna let happen, Nintendo is letting this happen, you should go pirate the game.

862
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,000
And hey, here's a thought too, by the way.

863
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Look at what happens when you have one place that sells a game that everybody likes.

864
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Only one place.

865
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Hello? Microsoft, you know, was trying to do the same shit, what, not too long ago with the Xbox One,

866
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:54,000
that there was only gonna be one place that you'd be able to basically take back your games and stuff?

867
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
They're gonna limit who can actually sell those games?

868
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,000
You really think they're gonna come down in price, like Steam?

869
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Ha ha ha! That's very funny.

870
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Bobby in our chatroom says, I rented it via Gamefly.

871
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:12,000
That's a great solution. Probably a better one than I suggested, quite honestly.

872
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:17,000
But as much as you may think I'm terrible for what I said or whatever, I mean,

873
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
I don't think you're terrible.

874
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:24,000
The reality is, when you see stuff like this happen, that's why piracy is happening.

875
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Ninety dollars for this game that should not be this cra-

876
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:34,000
That one company is essentially controlling price fixing, they are price fixing this game.

877
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Yeah.

878
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
It's ridiculous.

879
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:41,000
You know what? There's limited copies out there, and if they want more copies,

880
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,000
they go print more copies of the game and they sell them.

881
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:50,000
But now, what they've done is they're going back and reprinting it, because you guys demanded it.

882
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
We're gonna reprint it.

883
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Yes, I don't think the fans demanded that you charge ninety dollars for it either.

884
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Do you know what they ought to do, is they ought to just release it on the Wii U download shop.

885
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Yeah.

886
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:09,000
And then I would say, go ye forth and download this game, it's great and you should play it.

887
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,000
That would be a great, that would be a great thing for them to do.

888
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:21,000
You know what though, it's the same thing that people were fessing at people for, for going out.

889
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:25,000
I mean, it's why Target and places like that were restricting the number of Wii's people could buy,

890
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:30,000
because they knew that they were a limited number, and they were gonna go on eBay and charge a bajillion for it,

891
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,000
which would, you know, hurt their chances later on of actually selling the system for retail price.

892
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Fifth Dream in chat says, oh it's a Wii game, who gives a fuck?

893
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Because honestly, it's great. It really is.

894
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
I give a fuck.

895
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Yeah, it's, you are missing out not playing it.

896
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:53,000
I think when I originally reviewed the game, I said it was, it's the greatest PlayStation 2 Japanese RPG you'll play on a Nintendo Wii.

897
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Cause that's kinda what it is, but it's, you know, just because it's on the Wii doesn't make it a bad game.

898
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Well, I still, I wouldn't pay 90 bucks for, I've paid 90 bucks for games, but usually they were new imports.

899
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Just think what'll happen if they ever print, you know, Mother 3 and bring it over here and it's a GameStop exclusive,

900
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:21,000
and then, oh hey, we sold out of our initial copies, oh you want that again? That'll be $150.

901
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Alright, before I say something else that's gonna get me in trouble, let's go on to another news story. Lowkey.

902
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Alright, so Sony's got some news that they're gonna be unveiling this week at Gamescom,

903
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:38,000
and that news is rumored to be their plans for, or the release plans for the PlayStation 4.

904
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,000
And those are gonna be shared on August 20th during their conference.

905
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:52,000
They're emphasizing that they're gonna have a, or I guess they're gonna have a brief announcement regarding the release plans for the PlayStation 4.

906
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,000
And also, I guess Microsoft's supposed to have some sort of announcement as well,

907
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:01,000
though they're saying that their conference is really short in emphasizing on developers and their games.

908
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Yeah, I think it's basically really short because that news that they were supposed to be unveiling about the, you know,

909
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Xbox One systems being dev kits and stuff like that, that already got leaked out.

910
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:15,000
So, they don't have anything to talk about anymore, so that's kind of unfortunate.

911
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:20,000
But, I'm interested to see what both parties have to say.

912
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Well, I'm also interested to see what release date they're gonna give the PlayStation 4. That's gonna come out this week, right?

913
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Probably November. Everything's November. I'd be surprised if it's October.

914
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
A lot of rumors pointing to October for some reason.

915
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
They're trying to get a jump.

916
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Originally, I thought October because there were some placeholder dates that I had from a third party that were the same day as other games,

917
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:51,000
but it ended up they were just copy pasta, their own information.

918
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:57,000
It's like, hey, your UPCs are the same too. You might want to change all that stuff.

919
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Are we expecting any other big, big news out of Gamescom this week from anybody else?

920
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,000
There might be some more game announcements from Microsoft.

921
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:09,000
I know everyone's expecting maybe like a Crackdown 3 or something like that.

922
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:15,000
Although, Saints Row 4 is coming out the same day, so there's your Crackdown 3.

923
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Crackdown 3 would be slightly interesting. If it was a launch-style, that would be even more interesting.

924
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,000
What's the free game on 360 now? Because Crackdown was the first half of the month, right?

925
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Dead Rising 2 and Dead Rising Case 0.

926
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Oh, I'm gonna have to pick that up.

927
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Yeah, I put it in my queue. I've been putting everything in my queue, except for that last Xbox Live Arcade game, because I don't give a shit about that.

928
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:44,000
But I've been just putting it all in my queue, but I don't know, they're okay.

929
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
It's just at the same time, it's not exactly like PlayStation Plus.

930
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:53,000
I did put Hitman Absolution. The problem, and this just goes back to the whole digital download thing,

931
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:59,000
it's a 17-gig download for Hitman, because it's PlayStation 3.

932
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Sure, yeah, it's a Blu-ray disc.

933
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:09,000
And my network timed out in the middle of the download, because it was a few hours, even though I have pretty fast internet.

934
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Do you have PlayStation Plus, because you're downloading the game, can't you just trigger it to start downloading,

935
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:18,000
and then turn off your PlayStation and let it download overnight when it does the...

936
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Because any outstanding downloads will download overnight.

937
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Yeah, I could. I just downloaded most of it. I'm sure it would resume it, but it's just, you know...

938
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,000
It's annoying. I just wanted it on my queue. I'm probably not gonna actually play that right away.

939
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:35,000
All right, well, something we may hear about at Gamescom, although probably not, it'll probably come out later,

940
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:41,000
but there's some of these rumors about the Sony PlayStation 4 and a TV service that they're apparently building.

941
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Now, we kind of knew, like, they were getting, you know, into some TV things from the earlier press conference,

942
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
but, you know, now it's really starting to gel together what this might actually be,

943
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,000
and it looks like it's gonna be some type of paid TV service.

944
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,000
I would have thought it would have been an enhancement to PlayStation Plus.

945
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Maybe it still is.

946
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,000
God, I hope. If it's free TV and PlayStation Plus, fuck yeah.

947
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,000
You would think that they would sweeten the pot with that, but I don't know, maybe not.

948
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:11,000
But anyway, it's according to our report in the Wall Street Journal, because Sony made a big deal with Viacom.

949
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Viacom is a huge media company, what, they own CBS, don't they?

950
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:24,000
And Paramount and all these companies, to carry Viacom cable channels on an internet-based service for Sony products.

951
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,000
So you will be able to get Viacom cable channels, which is MTV and that stuff, right?

952
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:33,000
MTV Comedy Central, VH1, I don't remember what else they have.

953
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:41,000
So, assumably, you will be able to get these channels through your PlayStation 3 and essentially bypass your cable box.

954
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,000
You know what?

955
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
I don't see how the cable companies are gonna let that fly.

956
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:53,000
It's Viacom, though. Viacom, you know, they're higher up than the cable companies, so I can see how they can let that fly.

957
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:59,000
It's just interesting to me. Well, I mean, we've seen throughout this whole mess of, what is it, Time Warner and CBS,

958
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,000
that cable companies will block, you know, whatever they want.

959
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:06,000
So I'm kind of surprised that they're gonna be able to get away with this.

960
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Yeah, but they can block it on their own, like, as far as, you know, negotiating with, you know, other companies.

961
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,000
They can block it on their own service, but they can't really block it off the internet.

962
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:19,000
There's so many people that are ditching cable TV in favor of Netflix and Hulu.

963
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Yeah, we'll just start raising internet prices.

964
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Yeah, you're right. Probably. Probably.

965
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,000
It's costing us a lot more to expand our network.

966
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Brandon, we gotta put these bandwidth caps on, because bandwidth is super expensive.

967
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,000
But also keep in mind how many people do you know who have ditched their landline for their cell phone.

968
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
True.

969
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,000
So it's more the same thing.

970
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
True, and AT&T's still kicking, right?

971
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Yeah.

972
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,000
They're still putting out that blazing fast DSL.

973
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,000
I'm sorry. No, that's not.

974
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Sony also to do on-demand programming and cable channels online.

975
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:59,000
There'll be a recommended programming feature that will be influenced by content providers and an algorithm of what you've been watching.

976
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
So, interesting.

977
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,000
June 26th, it should be noted. My birthday.

978
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Sony renewed a trademark for PlayStation TV, likely to be the final name of this.

979
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,000
So who knows who might see more on this at Gamescom.

980
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Even though they just inked this deal the other day, Apple is notorious for inking deals the night before they make an announcement.

981
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:27,000
So you could see something, but it may be a rabbit in their hat they keep till later when we have more of what that's really gonna be.

982
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:32,000
I am really curious to see how Comcast, Time Warner, reacts to this.

983
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Be interesting.

984
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Gameguru in chat says Viacom doesn't care. They're the guys who own CBS.

985
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Oh yeah, Viacom is probably really excited about this because fuck Time Warner at this point.

986
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:54,000
If they can get CBS on PlayStation boxes, I mean, this is a dream for them if Sony's giving them what they want.

987
01:11:54,000 --> 01:12:01,000
I mean, this is a huge piece in their favor as far as Viacom's concerned.

988
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Yeah, you're just bypassing the whole, you know, because now you can get your, you know, you bypass everything.

989
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Now, an interesting point, I've seen this on Twitters and so forth, so this is worth discussing.

990
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:19,000
BlackWolf says TV, TV, TV, TV. Microsoft talks TV equals, Microsoft doesn't know what they're doing, how lame.

991
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Sony talks TV equals, this is awesome.

992
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Okay, well there's a little difference between having an IPTV service that you have going through your game console

993
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:35,000
and plugging in a video in through your goddamn console just to, you know, you can watch TV on the Xbox One.

994
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:41,000
You can watch TV on your TV. Basically, they're saying, hey look, we have this wonderful feature that has been featured on

995
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:49,000
almost all devices since a VCR where you have a video in and then you can watch TV on your device.

996
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:56,000
All they're doing, what functionality are they really adding to my, so I basically still need a cable box.

997
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:01,000
It's just my cable box is now running through my Xbox One. That's my problem.

998
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:05,000
It was like, hey, here's this brand new TV service that Microsoft's putting out.

999
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:11,000
You can access it through, you know, the Xbox 360 or the Xbox One. You don't need a cable box.

1000
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,000
That's a little different. That's my problem.

1001
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:19,000
That and their unveil of the console, they focus strictly on a lot of the entertainment things,

1002
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:23,000
which people are like, come on, I want to know about games because this is a gaming console type thing.

1003
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:30,000
I think too, it's not that I necessarily dislike what Microsoft is doing, and also to be fair,

1004
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:34,000
it's not like this news made me drop down the money to get a PlayStation 4.

1005
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:38,000
I had made that decision long before it, but when I hear about this enhanced value, of course I get excited.

1006
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:43,000
But it is all rumor. It may pan out to be nothing. And if it costs too much, I won't do it.

1007
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:49,000
And if Sony talks all about TV during their Gamescom, you know, announcements and stuff, that might be a little boring.

1008
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,000
And yeah, people would, I'd still rag on about that.

1009
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Like, okay, that's cool that you have this TV service coming, but I kind of want to know about your games.

1010
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Oh, unless they announce the tester season four. I can't wait. I can't wait.

1011
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Oh, Rob.

1012
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Dark Soccer, will you go on tester season four?

1013
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,000
No.

1014
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Because I remember we tried to get her to go on season three.

1015
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:12,000
No, they wouldn't want me anyway. I'm too bitchy.

1016
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,000
No, they would absolutely want you for being bitchy.

1017
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,000
I would lay the smack down on everybody and go, you know what?

1018
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:26,000
I remember when the only access we had to Sony and video games was when they made the Super Nintendo sound processor.

1019
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
And some limited games.

1020
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,000
And, well, you know how PlayStation started, right?

1021
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,000
It was supposed to be the whole CD expansion for Super Nintendo, right?

1022
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Indeed.

1023
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,000
All right. Anyhow, let's move on.

1024
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Dark Soccer, one more story before release dates.

1025
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:45,000
I was putting out my friend code. I'm putting myself out.

1026
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Well, some people may or may not be happy about this, but the games for Windows Live Marketplace is closing on August 22nd.

1027
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Which is pretty much next week.

1028
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:12,000
So, anyway, they put out an FAQ on Xbox.com so that for people who have purchased games on Windows Live and their DLC, they'll still be able to play them, but they won't be able to purchase additional content.

1029
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:18,000
And, basically, they're afraid that...

1030
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,000
There's people who are afraid that they're going to be pulling the games out of Steam as well.

1031
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,000
But, as far as that, I don't really see anything about that.

1032
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,000
They said that the games that are on Steam are still going to be on Steam.

1033
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:31,000
It's just that the Microsoft points are going bye-bye, you know, which we already knew.

1034
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:37,000
I think it's just because they're putting everything on their Windows Marketplace now and no point in having two different Marketplaces.

1035
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:41,000
They're putting everything out on their Inconvenience Marketplace.

1036
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Oh my God, you know, the games for Windows Marketplace, my only Marketplace I buy games, said no one ever.

1037
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Exactly. It's just, for the people who have bought things through there, they're really inconveniencing their consumers.

1038
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,000
There was a free game you got when you signed up for games for Windows Live that had achievements in it.

1039
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:04,000
I remember that's why I got it.

1040
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Tinker or something like that was the game.

1041
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Oh, Rob.

1042
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
I don't remember.

1043
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Some have achievements in like Solitaire now.

1044
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:20,000
And, I mean, it's kind of a big thing. I mean, yeah, they're definitely working on getting all their stuff ready for the X-Bone.

1045
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:26,000
But, in the end, nobody could see me shrug, but that's all I can say is shrug.

1046
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:34,000
And I shed another tear for my Microsoft Game Room, which was a part of games for Windows Live.

1047
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:41,000
So, if you have that, my assumption is that you won't be able to buy the packs anymore because that was all integrated through games for Windows Live.

1048
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Although, shit, that game's pretty much long gone if you don't have what you wanted out of that.

1049
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
I haven't gotten a single thing on that.

1050
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,000
I actually had a lot. I had like 15 games.

1051
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Why do you think I was so mad when they pulled the plug on it too soon?

1052
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Anyway.

1053
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and out with the old, in with the new, I suppose.

1054
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Yes. This week's actually quite a bit of stuff coming out.

1055
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:10,000
It's kind of a little bit of a kickoff for the fourth quarter, which is creeping up earlier every year.

1056
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:16,000
So, this week, Saints Row IV on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

1057
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Blacklist on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii U, and PC.

1058
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:33,000
We also have The Walking Dead Complete First Season on the Vita, and it has the additional DLC in there as well.

1059
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:39,000
New Super Luigi U for the Wii U, and that's the physical disc version of that.

1060
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Also, the Bureau XCOM Declassified on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

1061
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:54,000
And this isn't a game, but I still think it's interesting.

1062
01:17:54,000 --> 01:18:00,000
The Game Stick, the second Android console, is finally making its way out.

1063
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,000
So, they're going to have that and the dock as well available for that.

1064
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
And then $79.99.

1065
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Ooh, undercutting the Ouya.

1066
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Yeah.

1067
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Alright, we'll see how that goes.

1068
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:17,000
On the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan, Disorder 6 in regular and limited edition.

1069
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Dungeons & Dragons Mysteria is out this week as well, which we've talked about before on the show.

1070
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,000
The disc release, even though there's the download release too.

1071
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Medal of Honor Warfighter gets a price reduction as it moves into the best hits.

1072
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:37,000
And also out this week, Super Robot Taisen OG Saga, Maso Kishin 3, Pride of Justice comes out on the PlayStation 3.

1073
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:43,000
On the Xbox 360, because yes, there are still a few things here and there on the 360 in Japan.

1074
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Disorder 6 in its regular and limited edition.

1075
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:50,000
And Medal of Honor Warfighter gets that same price reduction on the 360 as well.

1076
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Moving to the handhelds on the PlayStation Vita this week, Super Robot Taisen OG Saga.

1077
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:59,000
That same game I mentioned before is out on the Vita as well.

1078
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Conception 2, Sichise no Michibiki to Mazuru no Akumu comes out this week as well.

1079
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
I want to know what this is about. Let's see.

1080
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Conception 2...

1081
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Sichise 7 World something.

1082
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Trying to see what kind of game it is.

1083
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Looks like it might be like a tactical RPG-ish type of thing.

1084
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
I've seen that design somewhere.

1085
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Yeah.

1086
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Let me look at the name again.

1087
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Sure.

1088
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Well, here's the box art if you want to see it.

1089
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Well, yeah, but I can't. That's 7 something.

1090
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,000
God damn it.

1091
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
This is great radio. There it is. Here it is.

1092
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:39,000
7th World something and I don't know.

1093
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Well, there you go.

1094
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Akumu, translate for us, please. We love you.

1095
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Help. Alright. Quickly, quickly.

1096
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Akumu-san is our hero.

1097
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:56,000
On the Wii U this week. Yes, the Wii U sees a release in the Wonderful 101, which is out in Japan on August the 24th, which I believe is the same day it's out here, right?

1098
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
That's very soon.

1099
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:08,000
And lastly on the 3DS, that same Conception 2 game, as well as Nanami to Ishio ni Gabuko English Jotsatsu no Kutsu comes out.

1100
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Oh, I think that's an English teacher.

1101
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Which I'm assuming is up. Yeah.

1102
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Let's learn English with cute anime girls.

1103
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
No, learn with Nanami.

1104
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Oh.

1105
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Hold on. Go back to the title.

1106
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Well, Nanami is missing her belly button on her...

1107
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
No, she has her belly button. We can see it.

1108
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,000
On her shirt.

1109
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Yeah, it's like a study with Nanami.

1110
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:30,000
And Nanami also is showing a little cleavage.

1111
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:35,000
He said you need to link that other game to chat so that Akumu-san can translate for us.

1112
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Alright, I will work on that while you travel to the UK.

1113
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:49,000
I wish. On the 20th, Disney Infinity for Damn Near Everything. On the 22nd, we have Skullgirls for PC. I want that game.

1114
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Splinter Cell Blacklist for Wii U. On the 23rd, Saints Row 4, X-Com, X-Com, X-Com, no.

1115
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:01,000
The Wonderful 101, which would be my reason for getting a Wii U, and Splinter Cell Blacklist.

1116
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Rob, if you get Wonderful 101, I'm just gonna move into your living room.

1117
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:08,000
They have a demo available on Wii U. I've downloaded it, but I've not played it yet.

1118
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
I need to see it.

1119
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Well, maybe after, well, I gotta go get Alan, so maybe during the week.

1120
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Wonderful.

1121
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,000
You better do it for him out of town.

1122
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Alan can walk.

1123
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Hard, hard, hard, hard.

1124
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
If he's listening, he's gonna cut you.

1125
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Alan, I was joking. Don't cut me.

1126
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.

1127
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
But first, Loki.

1128
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Loki? Hello?

1129
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Sorry, I was listening to a Nero song.

1130
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Anyways.

1131
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Wait, no. What is more important than this show?

1132
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Nero song?

1133
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Let's talk Call of Duty. Actually, I did watch the Call of Duty multiplayer preview thing that they did.

1134
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
It looks kinda cool.

1135
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:55,000
It was interesting. They did some new stuff with it.

1136
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Like, for example, they have now more character creation in there.

1137
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:07,000
You can actually customize the way your character looks, and the big thing is that they added female soldiers in the game now.

1138
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Big deal.

1139
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:18,000
One of the other things, though, that they mentioned that they're gonna basically allow you to take your profiles and your DLC from current gen to next gen.

1140
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Now, the profile thing is not a huge deal because that's kinda linked with your Call of Duty elite stuff, so that's kinda cross-platform as it is.

1141
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
But the DLC thing's kinda neat.

1142
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:34,000
So basically, if you buy a season pass or whatever on Xbox 360, you'll be able to take it to Xbox One.

1143
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Same with the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4.

1144
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,000
And that's not just limited to Call of Duty as well.

1145
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:44,000
It's also something that Battlefield 4 will have as well.

1146
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:56,000
So you can do a one-time transfer between the Xbox 360 and Xbox One and PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 for your stats, unlocks, ranks, award assignments, and that kind of thing.

1147
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:09,000
It's kinda lame, though, that it's a one-time deal for Battlefield 4, because what if I have an Xbox 360 at my work and an Xbox One at home and stuff, and I wanna play on both?

1148
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Why limit that? I don't know why, but that's something that they're supporting.

1149
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:24,000
And if I guess the Xbox One's saying they're supporting the season pass guarantee, that this is gonna apply for a lot of different things, including, well, they had mentioned Call of Duty Ghosts and Battlefield 4.

1150
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:30,000
I'm wondering if it's other games as well. They're gonna have some sort of tie in there.

1151
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Do you think a lot of people will be using this, or do you think people will just kinda already be upgrading or not?

1152
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:45,000
As much as I go, oh, yay, this is a neat idea, I kinda think to myself, well, God, you have to buy the games twice? How many people are really gonna do that?

1153
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:54,000
There might be some people that'll do that. I think what's gonna basically be is if, you know, say I wanna buy Call of Duty this year, and I'm not buying a next-gen system,

1154
01:23:54,000 --> 01:24:02,000
and then next year, I wanna, okay, we'll say mid next year, I wanna buy a PlayStation 4 or something like that.

1155
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:12,000
If I buy it on PlayStation 3, I can buy the season pass, like I'll do that, buy the season pass, and then, you know, I buy my new system, and I now have to buy the season pass again.

1156
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:20,000
I don't understand why it's such a big deal in the first place, because they do a lot of cross-buy stuff already on the PlayStation Network.

1157
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:26,000
I mean, I think this would be more news for Microsoft, because they don't really do any of that cross-buy stuff.

1158
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:41,000
So, I don't know. I guess it's a cool feature, but it's something that I think should be kind of expected, instead of having to buy the content more than once.

1159
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:46,000
But, whatever, I mean, I guess that's cool if they're doing that.

1160
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,000
I guess we live in a day and age where they didn't have to.

1161
01:24:49,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Yeah, it's one of those things now, and I was just gonna check here real quick to see if we have a story later on about, uh, yeah, I guess we do later on.

1162
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:14,000
But, you know, a lot of this nowadays, they're talking about features that, I mean, necessarily, they're already there, but you may not be completely familiar with them, or you may have forgotten that they have them there, and now they're new.

1163
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Yeah, it's like, you know, this whole, uh, what was it with the Xbox? There was just something recently.

1164
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
There was something coming up in Part B.

1165
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Yeah, I guess. No, no, it wasn't that. It wasn't that one. It was, um, the game sharing thing. Remember we talked about it last week?

1166
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Oh, yeah. Yes, you ranted about that last week.

1167
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Yes, that's not a new thing, but it's something that a lot of people don't really think about, or maybe, you know, they can spin it in a way that makes it a feature.

1168
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,000
It might be better on Xbox One, to be fair.

1169
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:45,000
It is, with the whole, you know, live sharing. It's kind of cool, so, but, I don't know.

1170
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Alright.

1171
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:55,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, bar.

1172
01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:10,000
This would be awesome if it's actually happening, no idea, but, uh, there's a thing going on in Japan this week called the Pokemon Game Show, and during this event, Nintendo actually teased, potentially, don't get your hopes up, but a Pokemon title for the Wii U in 3D.

1173
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Which would be weird, because there's never been a straight-up Pokemon, like, main franchise game on the consoles. They've always been the handhelds. Now, there's been tons of spin-off stuff.

1174
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Yeah, like the Rumble stuff.

1175
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Yeah, exactly, but, uh, you know, Pinball, and, well, no, I guess Pinball was on the handhelds, too, but wasn't there, um-

1176
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Pokemon Snap.

1177
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Yeah, Pokemon Snap, and then there was the GameCube Coliseum.

1178
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,000
They also have those weird-

1179
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,000
That was fun.

1180
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,000
They also have the weird spin-off games, the Poke Park games that have been on the Wii.

1181
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Well, what happened in this video is that, uh, you're playing on the main- it was playing on the main screen, it had a CG Pikachu, leading Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander in a Game Boy world, but at the end of the trailer, uh, there was a 3D Wii U Pokemon title that showed Lucario going face-to-face with Blaziken in a futuristic city.

1182
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:06,000
And I- I did think to myself, I was like, you know, if Nintendo wanted to turn the Wii U around real quick, real quick, here's a way to do it.

1183
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Pokemon's prints money.

1184
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:18,000
I think that they- I think it's- I think it's gonna be another, like, Coliseum title or something. I don't think it's gonna be anything like a mainstream Pokemon game.

1185
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:30,000
And, you know, and I said before, with the whole Skylanders and Disney Infinity stuff, I'm like, it's really only- and I know that Nintendo is doing it in some capacity, but if that's successful, or whatever, it could just get even bigger.

1186
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Like, I know with the- the rumble- the download thing where you can only get the figures at GameStop or whatever, it does feel in some way like getting the foot in the water.

1187
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Figures are gonna be $90 now, by the way.

1188
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,000
They're scarce.

1189
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:48,000
And you can't- you can't download the figure on the internet, so I don't know what to tell you if you get screwed on those.

1190
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Technically, that's not entirely true.

1191
01:27:52,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Because there are apps, and they have this with Skylanders already, there are apps where people have recorded the RFID, you know, the near-field communication stuff, and you can actually simulate that with your phone.

1192
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:08,000
You just put your phone on, you know, the communication thing, and you can play as that stuff.

1193
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:14,000
In fact, I- I don't think my phone supports that, but that'd be kind of interesting to check out with Disney Infinity.

1194
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
That might be a way to get around buying figures.

1195
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:20,000
It's a strange form of piracy.

1196
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Uh, it's like... I don't know what you can call that.

1197
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:32,000
You know what? We need- we need to travel back to a time when there wasn't these fucking figures they had to buy to give the whole experience to the game.

1198
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,000
It's all about patches.

1199
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:38,000
No, there was no patches back then either. If the game was fucked, it was fucked.

1200
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Games back then went through a process called testing, which I think is sometimes skipped now.

1201
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,000
As is the case of Disney-

1202
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
There was a seal of approval, goddammit.

1203
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:51,000
As is the case of Disney Infinity on PlayStation 3, if Twitter is any indication.

1204
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,000
Yeah.

1205
01:28:53,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Anyhow, DarkSakura, why don't you step into the gaming vault and take us back to a time when games didn't have all this shit?

1206
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Uh, by the way, I did just beat Find Me.

1207
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Oh, congrats. Did I slay the final boss?

1208
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Actually, a wandering hero did.

1209
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:13,000
But you almost did it. It was one hit point off, so Rob-

1210
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Story of my life. Somebody comes in and snatches all my glory.

1211
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,000
This is-

1212
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Story of my life.

1213
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
The game is Guilty Gear X.

1214
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:28,000
And the reason why I picked Guilty Gear X over Guilty Gear was, I mean, the original is because I think more people played X.

1215
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,000
You don't have to give a reason.

1216
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:32,000
I can give a reason if I- Rob! Rob!

1217
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Uh oh, this is battle music. This is the music DarkSakura kicked my butt to.

1218
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:45,000
I have a story about this, by the way. Guilty Gear X, which was, um, I had it on Dreamcast.

1219
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:50,000
And it's supposed to take place a few weeks after the first game.

1220
01:29:51,000 --> 01:30:07,000
There's a new Commander Gear. Basically, it takes everything that was good about the, uh, about the, uh, original one on PlayStation and just pumps it up a few more notches.

1221
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:11,000
It's got better graphics, of course, because it was on the Dreamcast.

1222
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,000
It's got great music. It's really, really fun.

1223
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:20,000
And also, it was, like, one of the last cosplays I did. I cosplayed Biken, and my husband did not like it because of the cleavage.

1224
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:26,000
So, moving forward, so yeah, the Dreamcast one had a limited, uh, release.

1225
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:31,000
It came with a special mini CD, um, that had different artworks that you could view on the PC.

1226
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Um, there was a Type A, Type B, and Type C.

1227
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:39,000
And, um, it had different images printed on the GD-ROM disk instead.

1228
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:44,000
As far as the characters in it, it has, uh, a bunch of people from the first game.

1229
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:51,000
It had Soul Bad Guy, which is funny because Soul Bad Guy was actually voiced by the, uh, creator of the series.

1230
01:30:52,000 --> 01:31:04,000
And, uh, it had, uh, you know, Mei, Biken, the Kaikisuke, Potemkin, Chip Zanuff, Milia Rage, Zatoone, Axolot, and Testament.

1231
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Um, it had new characters like Jim, Kurado, uh, Kurado Berry, Johnny, Anji, Mito, Venom, Dizzy, and Robo Key.

1232
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:24,000
So, it was, um, a really fun fighting game. I mean, I have, I actually have the Guilty Gear petite on WonderSwan, by the way, which was also super fun.

1233
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:31,000
But I've enjoyed every game in the series, but I'd have to say that I didn't really enjoy the series until this one came out.

1234
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:41,000
As far as other versions came out, there was X+, that was an enhanced version that had two extra characters that came out on the PS2, um, in Japan only.

1235
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:54,000
And, uh, then, um, that was on November 29th, and then there was basically just a bare bones port of the Dreamcast one that didn't have any of the extra stuff from the Japanese version that came out in the US and Europe.

1236
01:31:54,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Um, the two new characters were, uh, Cliff Anderson and Justice, uh, had different game modes, it had, uh, just all kinds of different moves, it was really neat, and more in the story mode and password mode.

1237
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Uh, the advanced version came out on GBA, and it was basically the arcade version, and it had all of the characters except for Robo Key.

1238
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:23,000
But it had, but, uh, it was just different stuff.

1239
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:35,000
There was version 1.5 as well that had some of the stuff from Guilty Gear XX, um, there was Petit, which is the one I mentioned earlier, the WonderSwan color version, which was pretty fun.

1240
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:40,000
I mean, it was actually super cutesy Guilty Gear, it's all I can say, and I've beaten that several times.

1241
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Petit 2 came out, and it also, um, had all of the arcade characters except for Bike and Dizzy and Robo Key.

1242
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Um, it had Fanny coming back, I have to laugh every time I say that because that's also slang for girl bits.

1243
01:32:54,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Um, it was really, it was really cute. The one I owned though was Petit, and then there was Club and Raid of Arms, but honestly, the Dreamcast one, awesome.

1244
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:21,000
And now the story about this, back in the day when we used to rip our Dreamcast games, um, we actually found out the hard way, this is the game that we, that my friend Julie learned to, and you remember Julie, learned how to rip

1245
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,000
No, I forgot her.

1246
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Everyone's forgotten her because

1247
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
She's a figment of my imagination.

1248
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:37,000
You know what, she means well to me, I haven't heard from her in ages. So, anyway, um, Julie was trying to figure out how to rip, um, Dreamcast games, and this was the game she tried on, so we had many, many copies of the soundtrack.

1249
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Many copies of the soundtrack.

1250
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:44,000
And learned quite a bit about the data that went to, uh, GB-ROM.

1251
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Or, I should say, uh, uh, GD-ROM, the Giga Disc.

1252
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:56,000
So, great soundtrack, great game, great characters, lots of cosplay fun.

1253
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Alright.

1254
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:01,000
I, you know, still have my Biken costume, except for the claw which belonged to Evan.

1255
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Cosplay memories.

1256
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Cosplay memories.

1257
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:12,000
You know what, I got the craziest arm cramp doing the Biken costume, because Biken's missing an arm.

1258
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:22,000
So I had to, I had this huge sleeve that was all torn and ratted up, you know, because she's missing an arm and the sleeve's all ratted, and she has a claw that hangs out of it.

1259
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:32,000
So I had to walk around with my hand on my shoulder, and this hook thing around my, uh, strapped to my arm hanging down with the chain and everything.

1260
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:40,000
And, oh my god, I had the worst cramp, and I ended up just having to think of another way to tuck it into the sleeve because it was a pain to cosplay.

1261
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,000
But it was a fun costume.

1262
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Guilty Gear X.

1263
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Alright.

1264
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:51,000
It doesn't, it doesn't feel like the game is that old, but I guess it is, it's over ten years old.

1265
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Well, the first Guilty Gear, you know, was PlayStation.

1266
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Alright.

1267
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Well, uh, that's gonna do it for this half of Orange Launch Radio, but don't go anywhere, we got plenty more show coming up, uh, including some rapid fire news.

1268
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:09,000
The Fugal Question of the Week, emails, and, uh, your phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1269
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:12,000
When we come back with all more Orange Launch Radio.

1270
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Hi, welcome back everybody to Orange Launch Radio.

1271
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:29,000
We are live on this Sunday evening, August the 18th, 2013, with the 516th episode of our program.

1274
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Especially, you know, it's a long show, so I know some of you dedicate a lot of time to, uh, listen throughout the week, so we appreciate it.

1275
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Hope we're helping you get through your workday or your commute, or wherever you choose to listen to this program.

1276
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Rob, I have a request.

1277
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,000
Okay.

1278
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
When we're officially into Final Fantasy Land.

1279
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Okay.

1280
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
You need to make a version of Sassy Pants.

1281
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
I thought about naming my character that, but, uh...

1282
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Lil Poundcake is cute, though.

1283
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Yeah, well, I named my character in Final Fantasy XIV, Lil Poundcake, and she's a little...

1284
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:15,000
I always, I still want to say Tarutarus, because that's the word in Final Fantasy XI, but I guess they're...

1285
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,000
Lelafell, or Falafel.

1286
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:19,000
I call her Falafels. She's a little falafel.

1287
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
And, uh, yeah, Lil Poundcake.

1288
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
And, somebody actually asked me in the show...

1289
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,000
Oh, no, it was you.

1290
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,000
It was me, because I was asking everybody.

1291
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Yeah, you're like, where'd the inspiration for your name come from? Because there are, like, a diverse amount of...

1292
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,000
My favorite was Sprinkles Galore.

1293
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Yeah.

1294
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,000
And, uh, Seymour Gylove.

1295
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Uh, there was a character I saw called Fap Fap.

1296
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:39,000
I saw Fap Fap. And, uh, Captain Obvious.

1297
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
I bet you did, you dirty hoe.

1298
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,000
You know what, I saw Captain Obvious.

1299
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Yeah.

1300
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:50,000
And, I also saw, um, what was the other one there? I saw Ianto Jones, and I said, okay, Torchwood, and they're like, yeah, big Torchwood fans. Cool.

1301
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:56,000
But, you were like, where's, what's the inspiration for your name? And, like, you know, some are named after, like, philosophers, or an anime, or whatever.

1302
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:59,000
And, I'm like, uh, my name comes from RuPaul's Drag Race.

1303
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:04,000
I was actually super surprised that I got the names I got, though.

1304
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Yeah. Well, it's, when there's first name and last name, it's much easier to get the names.

1305
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Yeah, but I was going for specific Homestuck characters.

1306
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,000
Yeah.

1307
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:16,000
So, I was like, why not? Because I was making a cat girl, and I wanted to name her after one of the cat trolls.

1308
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:22,000
I was, uh, being asked in chat during the break at Live.VogueNetwork.com by, uh, SailorVenus, who's in our chat tonight. Hello.

1309
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:31,000
Uh, what, uh, Warcraft characters I was playing these days. And, to be honest, I, I haven't really been tapped into WoW as much lately, because I kind of got distracted with single player games.

1310
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:34,000
I went through my whole MOBA phase, which I'm still in a little bit.

1311
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,000
Sassy is the best.

1312
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Well, yes, I do have my paladin. But, like, SailorVenus asked me, what's your main main, what's your main main character?

1313
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:50,000
And I'm like, I kind of have, I have ADD character at this point. I used to raid with my monk, so I guess that's my main.

1314
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Was it Gordita?

1315
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
She would be the best geared. No, uh, Calmain.

1316
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Calmain.

1317
01:37:55,000 --> 01:38:04,000
But I had my priest before that. I had Chakwas, my priest, who I raided with. I have, uh, Sassy on alliance, who I did get to 90, and I did some five mans with.

1318
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
And I've geared her that way, but I haven't really done any raids.

1319
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:10,000
I've, I've got your, your Rissa close to being raid ready.

1320
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:16,000
But now, I also have, see, the character I was playing the most, like, two months ago was Chocolena, my hunter, who's PVP.

1321
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:19,000
So, cause I, I had my PVP phase.

1322
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
I think it's hard to PVP on a hunter, though.

1323
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Well, that was the fun of it.

1324
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:27,000
You know what, PVP is the whole reason why I never finish Children's Week.

1325
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Oh, yeah, it can be- Stupid PVP.

1326
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:34,000
You really, like, honestly, if you're gonna do PVP, just turn off chat. It'll make your life easier.

1327
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Alright, anyhow, we could talk MMOs all night, and I do on Wednesday nights on a show called Hoard House, 7 o'clock Pacific.

1328
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Pluggity pluggity. And for the record, I didn't get Nepeta, I got Mulan.

1329
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:50,000
What unique context. Remember how I talked about the, uh, podcast and, and Stitcher listeners earlier?

1330
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Queen Simia, in chat, asked if I got Nepeta Lajon, which I didn't. I got Mulan, which is the one I wanted.

1331
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,000
There you go. Alright.

1332
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
But Nepeta's cute, but I wanted Mulan.

1333
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Let's go into, uh, rapid fire news tonight, and some other gaming news we're gonna go over quickly.

1334
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Alright. So, let's, uh, let's talk a little bit about discounts.

1335
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:17,000
Um, the Vita is actually dropping in price, apparently. Actually, it's not apparently, it's gonna happen.

1336
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Um, but this is something else. Uh, during Gamescom, I guess, they're probably gonna make this announcement as well.

1337
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:33,000
But, uh, I guess the launch versions of the system, the 3G Vita launch bundle, and also the Wi-Fi version are dropping down to $200.

1338
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:42,000
And, um, also at the same time, they're going to be dropping the price of, uh, the Greatest Hits games, I guess, for $15 a piece, and that's for PlayStation 3.

1339
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Um, the other thing, too, which I don't think is on here and hasn't been announced yet.

1340
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:57,000
That also includes new bundles that happen to be coming out, the new starter bundles, which, um, you know, there is one that happens to be coming out on Tuesday for The Walking Dead.

1341
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Just saying. So, um, you can get those for $200 now.

1342
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Also for $200, and this is allegedly a rumor, but it's not, uh, there is a 12 gigabyte PlayStation 3 coming to North America.

1343
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Now, I know what you're thinking. 12 gigabytes? That's awfully small. That's flash storage that they have on there, but you will be able to add a hard drive to it as well.

1344
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:26,000
So, it's a good place if you wanna, if you're planning on adding your own hard drive anyways, might as well not spend any more money than you have to.

1345
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:30,000
And 12 gigabytes would be enough to install Grand Theft Auto 5, I'm just saying.

1346
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
Which is apparently all a person needs, right?

1347
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,000
That's really all a person needs, yeah.

1348
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:38,000
You know what? You just need to talk to Dan, because he's all kinds of happy about that game.

1349
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:46,000
It is gonna encompass a lot of my time. That's all I'm saying. Anyways, uh, Fantasia!

1350
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Coming soon to VOG, the Grand Theft Auto 5 show, because it's all Loki's ever gonna be able to talk about.

1351
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
They already have a Grand Theft Auto 5 show.

1352
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Grand Theft Auto 5, GTA 5 o'clock, and it's a UK show, and it's great.

1353
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Good for them, that's great.

1354
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:59,000
They are fantastic.

1355
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,000
That's awesome.

1356
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:07,000
But hey, you know, since I will be spending most of my time online, I could probably guess Sun Horde House.

1357
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,000
You sure could!

1358
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Since, you know, Horde House was a Warcraft only show, but now it isn't, it's all online games.

1359
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:16,000
So yes, you could guess on Horde House to talk Grand Theft Auto 5 online.

1360
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,000
Yes.

1361
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Because lord knows none of us will be playing it.

1362
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:22,000
And you're really doing yourself a disservice.

1363
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:25,000
I'm kidding, I'm super curious. But anyway.

1364
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:29,000
It's not all about murdering people, you can play golf, and do yoga.

1365
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Oh, yay! Yoga! Oh man, yoga's my favorite thing in Final Fantasy XIV, I don't know about you.

1366
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:40,000
And that golfing in Warcraft, that's the reason to plunk down the money right there.

1367
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
You know what.

1368
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Alright. Fantasia, Music Evolved, new game coming from Harmonix, and they also have some more original pieces coming to the game,

1369
01:41:54,000 --> 01:42:04,000
including some works from, I guess, Inan Zur, and he did some music in Fallout, Fallout 3.

1370
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:19,000
And he's going to be doing, I guess, some original versions of, or different takes on, I guess, Vivaldi, Four Seasons, Night on the Bald Mountain, stuff like that.

1371
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Also, I guess he's arranged the orchestral mix of Queens Bohemian Rhapsody in the game.

1372
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
That sounds interesting.

1373
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:32,000
And of course, that's coming out sometime in 2014 on both Xbox platforms.

1374
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:37,000
And this is a little strange, but...

1375
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:48,000
So, they have, I guess this is going to be one of those announcements at Gamescom, but PlayStation Vita Pets coming to the Vita.

1376
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:55,000
It's like Nintendogs. If the dogs talked, they talk. It's weird.

1377
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Here's that killer app that's going to sell a million Vitas.

1378
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:02,000
It's weird that they're talking. I just, the whole point...

1379
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:03,000
I don't want you to talk.

1380
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Exactly. And they talk like that generic after school TV, kids Disney show or something like that that's really annoying and grinding on your brain.

1381
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:24,000
It would really only be awesome if you could take your PlayStation Pets and import them into Tokyo Jungle. That would be awesome.

1382
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:25,000
That could be pretty cool.

1383
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:28,000
See? You and I need to start a game studio.

1384
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,000
Tokyo Jungle.

1385
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
Dark Soccer could come visit once in a while.

1386
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Starts off like Nintendogs and then it gets really dark.

1387
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Now that I like.

1388
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:40,000
It's like Battle Royale for dogs and cats.

1389
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:44,000
No, but then you talk pet cruelty and I'm like, no, we can't have that.

1390
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:45,000
No, it's not pet cruelty.

1391
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Oh, come on. You're the one who named your horse Politary and beat her.

1392
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:50,000
That was different.

1393
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,000
In Derby Owners Club.

1394
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:52,000
That was different.

1395
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,000
I should do like games.

1396
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,000
You named your horse Glue.

1397
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,000
I have in my cube.

1398
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
I did name my horse Glue.

1399
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:08,000
I have my, I have in my cubicle at work. There's a poster that I, it was, it's a little, I don't even know where it's from, but it basically shows how to create battle hamsters.

1400
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:14,000
And it's basically a hamster that you tape, you duct tape a knife to and then they fight it out.

1401
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,000
But that would be fun.

1402
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:18,000
As long as it's over the top, then that's fine.

1403
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:21,000
Like, you know, like, remember Bungie Ferret Tossing?

1404
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:22,000
That, that game is hilarious.

1405
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:23,000
That one's over the top.

1406
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:24,000
There's another game.

1407
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:30,000
And once again, the name is escaping me that has like dogs with tank cannons on them.

1408
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:36,000
And I don't remember what it was called, but it's something that it's got a few games in the series and it was on PlayStation 2 and stuff.

1409
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:44,000
They had, it's like, literally they have like dogs with tank cannons on, like giant tank cannons.

1410
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Not just a clever name.

1411
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Artillery. It's, it's ridiculous.

1412
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Dogs with guns.

1413
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:48,000
That's like worms.

1414
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,000
You know what?

1415
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:50,000
That's worms.

1416
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,000
Actually, you remember, okay, going back to WoW for just a second.

1417
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Yeah.

1418
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
That one little, where was it?

1419
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:58,000
It was in wherever the Taran area is up on top of a plateau.

1420
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Thunder Bluff, right?

1421
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:04,000
Was it, was it there or was it somewhere closer to human lands where there were the-

1422
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,000
There's Metal Saga, by the way.

1423
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Where there were the hamsters and the rabbits that would suddenly, you know, have knives.

1424
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1425
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,000
And shit.

1426
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:13,000
Yeah.

1427
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
I just hung out there for hours just watching them.

1428
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Because, oh, I was bored.

1429
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:20,000
But anyway, but like you follow one of them around and you can actually watch them transform.

1430
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:23,000
But like there was the rabbit with combat knife and the hamster with the Uzi.

1431
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:24,000
All right.

1432
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Y'all and your animal fighting issues.

1433
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:27,000
No, no, no.

1434
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:28,000
See, this is what I'm telling you.

1435
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:29,000
That was awesome.

1436
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
See, that's from Metal Saga right there.

1437
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Okay, I have to play this.

1438
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,000
I gotta move on.

1439
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:36,000
I want Ashiba Inu with bazooka.

1440
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Moving on, moving on.

1441
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:41,000
That's what Call of Duty ghost scenes right there.

1442
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
Dogs with giant bazookas.

1443
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:44,000
All right.

1444
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:45,000
I'd play it.

1445
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:49,000
I don't know how many of you guys have checked this out, but there's the Humble Origin bundle,

1446
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:50,000
which is available from the-

1447
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:51,000
What?

1448
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
Yeah, the Humble bundle has the Humble Origin bundle.

1449
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:56,000
And I know a lot of people are like, ew, origin.

1450
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:59,000
But the cool thing is, well, A, it's for charity.

1451
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
And all of the money is going to charity.

1452
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:02,000
So no money goes to EA.

1453
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
So what games are in there that I already own?

1454
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:05,000
Okay, here it is.

1455
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:10,000
If you pay a dollar or more, you get Dead Space, Burnout Paradise, The Ultimate Box,

1456
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Crysis 2 Maximum Edition, Mirror's Edge, Dead Space 3, and Medal of Honor.

1457
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:17,000
If you pay more than the average, which will be about five bucks,

1458
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:22,000
Battlefield 3 and The Sims 3 plus the starter pack are included.

1459
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:26,000
Any of those games that are available on Steam will let you get Steam keys.

1460
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:31,000
So I believe the only games you have to have Origin installed for are Dead Space 3

1461
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
and then the two bonus games, Battlefield 3 and The Sims.

1462
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
I do want to play Dead Space 3.

1463
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
So, well, you can go get it for like a dollar.

1464
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
I've already got, though, a bunch of those other games.

1465
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:40,000
And it goes to charity.

1466
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,000
It's charity.

1467
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:46,000
Yeah, and since you've already installed Origin, so you're already kind of, you know, tainted anyways,

1468
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,000
then you can go ahead and, you know-

1469
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Might as well, right?

1470
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:52,000
I took my pills.

1471
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:56,000
See, I, on the other hand, I only, uh, I paid the full amount,

1472
01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:00,000
because I like Battlefield 3, but I just haven't played it yet.

1473
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
So I like the idea of it.

1474
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:05,000
I just, uh, not installing Origin, though.

1475
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:11,000
But I, mainly I paid more than the average, because, you know, they always add in extra games towards the end of the week.

1476
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
So I'm curious to see what those are.

1477
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
And I wanted Mirror's Edge and Burnout.

1478
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Burnout Paradise, dude, that is the, come on.

1479
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:23,000
It's at least a dollar you can pay for one of the best racing games this generation.

1480
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
I was going to say, the charities are great.

1481
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
Like, you have Human Rights Campaign.

1482
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
You can just have all of your money go to that.

1483
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:35,000
American Cancer Society, Sacramento, or San Francisco AIDS Foundation, American Red Cross, WotC.

1484
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
I mean, this is great.

1485
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:38,000
Very cool.

1486
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:41,000
So, um, yeah, I mean, it's for charity.

1487
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:46,000
So hate on Origin all you want, but it's pretty hard to get mad at this.

1488
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:50,000
Although, I've already got the three of those games.

1489
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:55,000
Maybe I'm just being the Grinch, but you have to wonder, you have to wonder,

1490
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:58,000
are they just trying to get Origin put on more computers?

1491
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Yeah.

1492
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:02,000
Yep, because then they're going to say, look how many people have Origin.

1493
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:06,000
Origin's a successful service. Look how many people have Origin.

1494
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:10,000
I hate going there, because at the end of the day this is a great thing,

1495
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
but it's just that you can't help but wonder.

1496
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
And you know people are talking about it.

1497
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:17,000
I'm super close to patching my Mass Effect 3 so I don't have to go through Origin.

1498
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:21,000
I almost bought the Deep Silver bundle, but the problem is I bought the THQ bundle,

1499
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
and that had a lot of the games that were in the Deep Silver bundle.

1500
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:24,000
That's very true.

1501
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:30,000
So I was like, eh, I just can't see myself buying yet another copy of Saints Row the Third.

1502
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Brad from Paw Culture says, with these bundles I always put all my fundage towards the charities.

1503
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:36,000
That's at live.vognore.com.

1504
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Yes, you can decide how your money is split.

1505
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:42,000
The cool thing about this one is that since EA is not getting any of the money,

1506
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:46,000
usually the indie developers, you can give them a chunk of the pot and by default they get some.

1507
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:51,000
But this time it's all charities and what they call the Humble Bundle tip.

1508
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Yeah.

1509
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Alright, and apparently I leveled up during that segment.

1510
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Well, that was also Dan texting me, and I usually have my phone turned off.

1511
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
So now everyone knows what my text sound is.

1512
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,000
There you go.

1513
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:07,000
Alright, a StarCraft MMO, and I think this is something they were actually creating in the StarCraft II engine, fan created,

1514
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:11,000
but like World of StarCraft or whatever, but it got kind of smacked down.

1515
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
But now it's on Kickstarter.

1516
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:17,000
StarCraft Universe, which was originally World of StarCraft,

1517
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:21,000
it will allow players to create a character and log into an alternate history StarCraft.

1518
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:24,000
The Zerg and Protoss hybrids are around.

1519
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:27,000
I guess Blizzard does bless this project now.

1520
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:31,000
So StarCraft Universe, they can make this in the StarCraft II engine.

1521
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
It just can't be called World of StarCraft.

1522
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:34,000
That was the deal.

1523
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,000
I remember they changed something.

1524
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:39,000
So they won $80,000 that they're getting on Kickstarter, and here's why.

1525
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:45,000
This is for the creator Ryan Winsen and the people he's working with to get additional pylons

1526
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:50,000
and focus solely on creating the game and getting it out there in 2014 for an open beta,

1527
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:53,000
which I'm assuming means I want to be able to quit my job and do this full time

1528
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
and actually get it out in a timely manner.

1529
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
That's what I'm reading.

1530
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:58,000
That sounds about right, yeah.

1531
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:04,000
There are stretch goals and other rewards, a Zerg character class if they make $100,000, and so on and so on.

1532
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Let me see where they're at right now.

1533
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:09,000
Just kind of curious for an update here on this Sunday evening.

1534
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:13,000
They've got 22 days to go, and they've almost made half their money.

1535
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
They're at $36,000, so not bad.

1536
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:18,000
They're ahead of the curve a little bit if they can keep that going,

1537
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:21,000
although I think most Kickstarters, the earlier the better.

1538
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
So, good luck.

1539
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:27,000
I'm surprised Blizzard's kind of letting them do that,

1540
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:31,000
because aren't they raising money based off of StarCraft IP in a way?

1541
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:34,000
I'm sure they've got some kind of deal worked out.

1542
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:38,000
I guess, and I guess at the end of the day it's all promo for StarCraft II, so.

1543
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Yeah.

1544
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:46,000
Anyhow, speaking of Blizzard, another beta that launched this weekend that has a lot of people's attention is Hearthstone.

1545
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
The Hearthstone closed beta.

1546
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:51,000
This is Blizzard's free-to-play little card game that they've got.

1547
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:54,000
It went into a closed beta this weekend.

1548
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Some folks from the opt-in pool, some press and some fansites all in the beta,

1549
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:02,000
checking out Hearthstone this weekend, and there's no NDA for it,

1550
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:06,000
so people everywhere are streaming their plays and so forth, which is cool.

1551
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
I want to check this game out at some point.

1552
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:11,000
I'm especially excited that it's supposed to be on tablets or whatever,

1553
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:14,000
and a lot of people that are playing it saying it's very easy to play.

1554
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:17,000
I do think it's very interesting timing on Blizzard's part,

1555
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:22,000
and I don't think it's any coincidence at all that the Hearthstone beta started out of nowhere this weekend,

1556
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:28,000
when a lot of World of Warcraft and hardcore Blizzard fans I think were a little bored waiting for patch 5.4.

1557
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Let me go try this other open beta that's going on right now.

1558
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:36,000
I'm going to go try this Final Fantasy XIV.

1559
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:40,000
So Blizzard releases this to their most vocal people,

1560
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:44,000
people that are some heavy influencers in the community and so forth,

1561
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:47,000
and suddenly none of them care about Final Fantasy XIV anymore.

1562
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
They're all playing this.

1563
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:53,000
That's a smart move on Blizzard's part, but I will say this,

1564
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:56,000
and I'll expand a little bit on this on Horde House, but I can't help myself.

1565
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
I have to say something now.

1566
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:02,000
Because of this, I've seen some people shading Final Fantasy XIV a little bit,

1567
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:05,000
and I'm just going to say, don't shade a game you haven't played.

1568
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
That's ignorant.

1569
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:11,000
One of these is a free-to-play trading card game that's going to be on tablets.

1570
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:16,000
The other one of these is a very intricate MMO that's going to be on PlayStation 3.

1571
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,000
They're not alike in any way, shape, or form.

1572
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:20,000
NPC.

1573
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,000
Huh?

1574
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:22,000
NPC.

1575
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:23,000
Yes, NPC.

1576
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:26,000
What are you so threatened by, y'all?

1577
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
What's so threatening?

1578
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:32,000
Because people like to be right, and people like their thing to be better.

1579
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:36,000
Yes, and that's kind of like blind fandom, and it's a little bit ridiculous, people.

1580
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:37,000
Come on.

1581
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,000
So, anyway.

1582
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
I'm going to give you all a piece of advice.

1583
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:43,000
You can like item A and also like item B.

1584
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Oh, I can like Lady Gaga and Katy Perry?

1585
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:47,000
No.

1586
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
I can like Supernatural and Doctor Who.

1587
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:50,000
What?

1588
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
I can like the current Doctor Who and the classic Doctor Who.

1589
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:53,000
What?

1590
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:54,000
I know, right?

1591
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Since you're a foreign Grand Theft Auto 5?

1592
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:56,000
No.

1593
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:58,000
Rob.

1594
01:52:58,000 --> 01:52:59,000
What?

1595
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
I can play Dragon Age 2 and the Mass Effect series.

1596
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
PlayStation and Xbox?

1597
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Xbox?

1598
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,000
What?

1599
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:06,000
No.

1600
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:07,000
You have to.

1601
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:08,000
Loki, that's just cross.

1602
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:09,000
You have to buy one or the other.

1603
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Hey, guess what?

1604
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:14,000
I have both and a Wii.

1605
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:17,000
My God, people.

1606
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:18,000
I know.

1607
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
Cats and dogs living together.

1608
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:21,000
Mass hysteria.

1609
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
I love that line.

1610
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:28,000
Anyway, I look forward to playing this beta at some point whenever I, you know, get my

1611
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:29,000
little access.

1612
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
By the way, I do have to make a little tangent.

1613
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:34,200
And I forgot to mention I was playing Dragon Age 2 because I actually stopped Final Fantasy

1614
01:53:34,200 --> 01:53:36,000
XIV to play Dragon Age 2.

1615
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:41,000
I totally missed one part where I could, to start the romance with Fenris.

1616
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:49,000
So I totally cheated and did the debug mode so I could just change all the romance options.

1617
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:52,000
And Becky's husband said, so you gave him roofies?

1618
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:55,000
I was like, okay, that's pretty funny.

1619
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:56,000
All right.

1620
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
Dark Sakura, you have some rapid fire news for us.

1621
01:53:58,000 --> 01:53:59,000
I do.

1622
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:04,000
And one of them is about Shin Megami Tensei, if I can actually get to Safari.

1623
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:07,000
There is a UK release date.

1624
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:13,000
It is going to be, that's actually Shin Megami Tensei, Devil Summoner, Soul Hackers.

1625
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:19,000
The European release date is going to be on September, moved from September 13th to September

1626
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:20,000
20th.

1627
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:27,000
And it's going to be available digitally on the 3DS eShop on the following week on the

1628
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:28,000
25th of September.

1629
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:31,000
So that is the official release date for that.

1630
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
Sorry guys in the UK.

1631
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:37,000
We also have a date for Castle of Illusion remaster in the UK.

1632
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:40,000
It's going to be September 4th and it will be 10 pounds.

1633
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:43,000
So I would love to hear what people say.

1634
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:49,000
Now, of course, it's going to be available for pre-order on August 21st on PlayStation

1635
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:52,000
Network for the Mega Drive emulator.

1636
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:56,000
And last but not least, we have Castlevania Mirror of Fate HD.

1637
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:01,000
It has a list date that's on Play Asia.

1638
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:06,000
And it says it's going to be for PS3 and Xbox 360.

1639
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:11,000
And saying that the collection will have the first Lords of Shadow, all the DLC, and an

1640
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:15,000
exclusive demo of Lords of Shadow 2 and will be out in October.

1641
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:21,000
Yeah, it's going to be part of the Lords of Shadow collection thing since Lords of Shadow

1642
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:24,000
2 got delayed to next year.

1643
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:35,000
Also, Brazil's games rating board had for December 2012, I'm sorry, in December 2012

1644
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Mirror of Fate was on the Brazil rating board.

1645
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:45,000
And they're also saying that there's going to be a PC and Wii U one, but there's nothing

1646
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
listed on Play Asia.

1647
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:50,000
So that's it.

1648
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:51,000
All right.

1649
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:56,000
It's sad that actually that's like almost the only game.

1650
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:59,000
I mean, Konami has hardly any games coming out.

1651
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
Pro Evo and this.

1652
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
I mean, that's it.

1653
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:04,000
And the next year.

1654
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
Metal Gear Solid 5.

1655
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
Yeah, Metal Gear Solid 5.

1656
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:12,000
But I mean, shit, they're releasing stuff less often than Capcom is nowadays.

1657
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
Don't they have a lot of like kiddie stuff though?

1658
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
They're all mobile now.

1659
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:19,000
But they don't have a lot of kiddie licenses anymore.

1660
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
No DDR anymore.

1661
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:24,000
No, not even Karaoke Revolution anymore.

1662
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:25,000
All right.

1663
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Let's get to the foogle question of the week.

1664
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:38,000
Every week we ask our Facebook and our Google Plus communities a question.

1665
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:42,000
You take those two words, you slam them together, you get foogle.

1666
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:43,000
Here's the question.

1667
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:47,000
There's rumors out there that Sony is making some moves to launch an online TV service

1668
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:48,000
on the PlayStation 4.

1669
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:51,000
Certainly similar TV integrative features are a part of the Xbox One as well.

1670
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:55,000
How important is the integration of television into your video game console?

1671
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:58,000
Is this sort of service something you are interested in?

1672
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:01,000
Or do you think Sony and Microsoft should focus less on these online TV networks

1673
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
and more on the games?

1674
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
Redertainment on Google Plus says,

1675
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:10,000
I gave up having a centralized box for my entertainment when I hooked up my Nest to my VCR.

1676
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:15,000
My current entertainment system is essentially a series of individual components working together

1677
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:18,000
that I upgrade as my will and resources allow me to do so.

1678
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:22,000
Having one centralized box for everything would wreck the general aesthetic

1679
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:27,000
of the altar that I worship in front of for several hours each day.

1680
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:28,000
Act Def says,

1681
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:31,000
For me it's truly something I don't care that much about

1682
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:34,000
since most of the services they offer only work in some countries.

1683
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
It's as good as Plus though.

1684
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
E3VL says,

1685
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:43,000
I'm not much of a TV guy so if it's part of PlayStation Plus I may check it out if I have spare time.

1686
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Definitely not going to pay extra for the service unless it has enough quality content

1687
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:51,000
to replace my Netflix subscription at the same or lower cost.

1688
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Joe C says,

1689
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:58,000
I live in the UK so it's probably of no consequence to me as these services are non-existent,

1690
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
severely limited over here.

1691
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:03,000
I don't like too many services competing with each other though.

1692
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:07,000
I don't want to subscribe to them all so I always feel as though I'm missing out.

1693
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:08,000
That's a good point.

1694
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:11,000
Like sometimes you have to feel like you have to do Hulu and Netflix

1695
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
and everybody wants a little piece of that.

1696
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:14,000
And Techie Q says,

1697
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:15,000
Bring it on.

1698
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:20,000
It's a small but big step into breaking the traditional TV cable model.

1699
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Those are the answers on Google Plus.

1700
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
Some of them I had to shorten them all

1701
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
because I want to try to get in a lot of people tonight

1702
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
and we still have a lot more answers here over on Facebook

1703
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
so I'm going to try to shorten some of these.

1704
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
So I'm sorry if I don't read your full answer

1705
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:36,000
but I'm going to encourage everybody to go over to facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio

1706
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
and our Google Plus page Orange Lounge Radio

1707
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
and read the full answers themselves.

1708
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:41,000
Critical Myth says,

1709
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:46,000
It's not that important to me given that I have several other options currently

1710
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
that I'm very comfortable with.

1711
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Renee, our friend from Koopa Club says,

1712
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:54,000
You know it's not really that important to me to have my television services

1713
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
integrated into my video game console.

1714
01:58:56,000 --> 01:59:00,000
I understand the concept of wanting to encapsulate everything into one unit

1715
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:05,000
or box if you will to just have one place to go for all your entertainment needs.

1716
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:06,000
Lauren Z says,

1717
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:09,000
What if we had a gaming console that actually focused on gaming?

1718
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
I know, I know, it's an odd concept but just think about it.

1719
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:12,000
It could work, right?

1720
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
No? Okay.

1721
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:15,000
Raginator says,

1722
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:18,000
If this was a year or two ago I would have said that it's very important

1723
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:24,000
but nowadays I'd probably say that it's not at all important.

1724
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
Shane says,

1725
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:30,000
They already do that stuff for me as they all play Hulu and Netflix.

1726
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
Cable TV is for chumps.

1727
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:35,000
Patty E says,

1728
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:38,000
I get a gaming system for games.

1729
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:41,000
I enjoy the fact that I can stream video from something like Netflix or Hulu

1730
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
or directly from my computer,

1731
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:47,000
but that does not at all contribute to why I want the system.

1732
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
Marcello L says,

1733
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
All these TV features are nice,

1734
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:55,000
but really I buy a PlayStation 4 or Xbox One for games.

1735
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:58,000
Now if the games had a feature that tied to the channel you are watching or show,

1736
01:59:58,000 --> 01:59:59,000
that would be interesting.

1737
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
Still not buying an Xbox One.

1738
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
Daniel S says,

1739
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
I don't watch TV so this won't really affect me.

1740
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
I mean the wife will use it so whatever.

1741
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
I just find it funny because if this is true,

1742
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
Sony will get compliments for adding on to their system,

1743
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:14,000
but when Microsoft makes changes to be more like Sony,

1744
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:15,000
they get slammed.

1745
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:16,000
The console war is a fun show.

1746
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:19,000
So kind of bringing up a point that was brought up by a chatter earlier.

1747
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:20,000
Mason D says,

1748
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:23,000
I think they need to spend more time making use of the peripherals that they put out.

1749
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Think of if Yu-Gi-Oh! with the PlayStation Eye.

1750
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:28,000
Mason says,

1751
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:31,000
You know, Sony, stop putting out all this shit and then not supporting it.

1752
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
Interesting.

1753
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
For the Fallen Dreams answers and says,

1754
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:40,000
While most gamers would agree that the focus should be towards games, excuse me,

1755
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:44,000
you can't deny the popularity of consoles for multimedia for more casual users.

1756
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:49,000
My father, for instance, saw the PlayStation 3 as the cheapest Blu-ray Netflix player at the time

1757
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
and uses it solely for that.

1758
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
If there's a market for it, companies will follow suit.

1759
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:57,000
It's easier to hook up a console in your living room than it is a desktop or laptop.

1760
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:00,000
That's definitely an audience I'm sure these TV things are going for,

1761
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:05,000
is people that are using their PlayStation 3 as their Blu-ray device.

1762
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:08,000
So, yeah, I'm sure there's a lot of people like that.

1763
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:09,000
SHA100Matt says,

1764
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:14,000
The thought of having additional entertainment options on top of my gaming platform is definitely a good plus,

1765
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:19,000
although the gamer side of me thinks that they should spend their time investing in additional gaming enhancements.

1766
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
Galley89 says,

1767
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
It makes no difference to me as I don't have cable.

1768
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
I would be interested in an a la carte service, though.

1769
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:26,000
Geeklet says,

1770
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:29,000
It's always handy, but I don't think it's really a decision maker.

1771
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
I'm fine with a console just playing games.

1772
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
And lastly, Mike B says,

1773
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:41,000
The future is no TV as we know it, only on demand, and pay for what you want to watch without commercials.

1774
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:42,000
You know what?

1775
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:47,000
Quickly, those are some abbreviated comments from Facebook and Google Plus.

1776
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
Check out the full answers on those respective pages.

1777
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:50,000
Yes, Jamie?

1778
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:54,000
I'm just saying, a lot of people are repeating pretty much what's already going on in a lot of homes.

1779
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:55,000
It definitely goes on in mine.

1780
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:58,000
We have a computer hooked up to our TV.

1781
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:01,000
So anything that we want to watch, it's either stuff we've downloaded.

1782
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:05,000
We use Hulu Plus and we have Netflix.

1783
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
Anything that we want to watch, it's all there.

1784
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:11,000
Becky got rid of her cable so that she could use Amazon Prime.

1785
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
She's really been happy with Amazon Prime.

1786
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
She gets shows for Julia in that way.

1787
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:20,000
So I'm just saying, it's kind of like what I was saying before with the whole people going to cell phone.

1788
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:28,000
People are abandoning their traditional cable and TV services for getting what they want, when they want.

1789
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:34,000
I think as much as Mike B kind of took us out there with the whole there's only going to be on demand,

1790
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:38,000
my mind kind of goes there, but I actually don't think that's true.

1791
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:43,000
Because yes, I think a lot of TV as we know it today will go that way,

1792
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
and a lot of the expanded cable channels and so forth.

1793
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:49,000
But keep in mind, there's one thing that on demand can't do, and that's live.

1794
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:53,000
The live experience can't be duplicated in an on demand service.

1795
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:57,000
The live experience can be, you know, we can go a different direction with it,

1796
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:00,000
such as things like One Vs. 100 and so forth,

1797
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:05,000
but I think there's always going to be a place out there for things like cable news.

1798
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:11,000
Things like American Idol, which whether you watch it or not, it's still a very highly rated show.

1799
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:14,000
And all those talent shows, you know, The Voice and things, those are still live shows.

1800
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:19,000
I think in a way, broadcast TV may experience a bit of a renaissance,

1801
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:23,000
where it goes back to, in the beginning of television, it was all live stuff.

1802
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:28,000
But what I think is going to happen more with that is news might go on a subscription service.

1803
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:36,000
Or take the path that BBC News has done, where you can go on the website for any of their news.

1804
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:39,000
They also have live stream radio.

1805
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Where, like, I caught all kinds of new music just by listening to, what is it, Radio 4?

1806
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
VOG Network's the only radio you need.

1807
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:53,000
But I'm saying, you know, we're even with, how about all the crap that went down in Texas?

1808
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:59,000
We had live streaming going on from the assembly room.

1809
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:04,000
We had the freaking internet catch the Texas Assembly, breaking the law.

1810
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:11,000
Live? I watched the whole thing. I was like, where's my popcorn? I'm just watching this.

1811
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:18,000
But I mean, news in and of itself, you've got your people who are still going to listen to your biased sources.

1812
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:21,000
You know, like your Fox News or your CNN or all of that, you know.

1813
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:25,000
But you also have a great deal more people who are looking outside of those sources,

1814
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:30,000
who are probably getting pretty fed up with having, you know, their world events spoon fed to them,

1815
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:33,000
and want to actually see what's going on. They're looking to those other sources.

1816
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:37,000
Another good catch from our chat room, something that you couldn't get on demand,

1817
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:40,000
Jim Sally in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,

1818
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:45,000
Sports need to be live. Football and baseball will keep traditional TV around forever.

1819
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:48,000
ESPN's going to go to a subscription service.

1820
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:52,000
Well, they kind of have subscription services like the NFL Direct and all that, and the NHL.

1821
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:55,000
Well, that's probably what they're going to go towards.

1822
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:56,000
We'll see.

1823
02:04:56,000 --> 02:05:00,000
You know, you want your ESPN. Well, you have the ESPN streaming service,

1824
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:03,000
where you pay X amount and you get all the sports you want.

1825
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:09,000
You get so many sports as you start, you know, sprouting the colors of your favorite team out of your skin or something.

1826
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:10,000
All right.

1827
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
You turn into a buccaneer.

1828
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:17,000
All right. We're going to move on from our frugal question of the week, but good answers, you guys. Good answers.

1829
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:22,000
All right. Let's get back into the news, and I know Loki's been dying to talk about this next story all night long.

1830
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
Of course, I was.

1831
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:33,000
Yes, Grand Theft Auto V finally had their big unveil of their online portion of the game.

1832
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:39,000
It's actually going to be called Grand Theft Auto Online, and it's all sorts of awesome.

1833
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:44,000
What's interesting, though, is it's actually kind of its own separate thing.

1834
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:49,000
It launches October 1st, if you buy a copy of Grand Theft Auto V.

1835
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:56,000
And thankfully, they're doing that because it gives me two weeks to play the game before I have to worry about trying to hog online.

1836
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
But you get to create your own character.

1837
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:01,000
You earn money in the game, and you can customize your character.

1838
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
You can buy property in the game.

1839
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
You can insure your cars.

1840
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:06,000
You can buy cars.

1841
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:11,000
It's so deep as far as the detail in the game.

1842
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
They have it where you can play the stock market.

1843
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:18,000
For example, you can invest money in a car company, and you go and destroy those cars out in the street,

1844
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:21,000
and then they have to make more cars, and therefore your stock goes up.

1845
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:22,000
You know, kind of stuff like that.

1846
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:28,000
You can pull off heists with your friends, do all sorts of other unstructured activities,

1847
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:32,000
plus they also have the regular deathmatch and all that fun stuff in there as well.

1848
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:35,000
Lots of interesting details coming out.

1849
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:41,000
Some of them actually were from the GTA 5 O'Clock story.

1850
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:45,000
Basically saying, well, first off, it's GTA Online.

1851
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:49,000
It's not actually part of Grand Theft Auto 5, although it's going to start off with San Andreas,

1852
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:52,000
but it will expand beyond that.

1853
02:06:52,000 --> 02:07:00,000
So they're planning on adding more area other than Los Santos and San Andreas to play in.

1854
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:06,000
Also saying that, you know, there's voice chat.

1855
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
You can actually talk in the game.

1856
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:15,000
Your character will move its mouth, matching your dialogue.

1857
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:20,000
It will lip sync, and the AI characters in the game will react to the urgency in your voice.

1858
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:24,000
So like if you said, get on the fucking floor!

1859
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:25,000
They will get on the fucking floor.

1860
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:26,000
You know, that type of shit.

1861
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
But if you go, get on the floor.

1862
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:29,000
Get on the floor.

1863
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:30,000
Then they'll start dancing.

1864
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:31,000
Yeah, exactly.

1865
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:32,000
Or they'll strip.

1866
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:35,000
Get on the floor now.

1867
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:40,000
Basically, lots of interesting stuff in there.

1868
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:41,000
It's a little different.

1869
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:46,000
It's not necessarily an MMO, because you can play up to 16 players in there at a time,

1870
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
but you can play with other people.

1871
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
So you can play with your friends and stuff like that.

1872
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
You can invite random people in there.

1873
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:53,000
Is this mediocre?

1874
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:54,000
Pretty massive?

1875
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
It's going to be pretty massive, I think.

1876
02:07:56,000 --> 02:08:00,000
And plus, you know, they're saying that there's also a...

1877
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:01,000
This is cool.

1878
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
There's sort of like a spectator mode in it.

1879
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:08,000
For example, if your friends have a high wanted level or whatever,

1880
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
and they're getting chased down by the police,

1881
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
you can sit back in your apartment and watch on the TV,

1882
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
and it'll show it like a newscast,

1883
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
watching your friends getting chased by the police.

1884
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:17,000
That's pretty sweet.

1885
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:18,000
I'm sorry.

1886
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:21,000
So if you get in a white Bronco and drive away, I can watch it on the TV?

1887
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:22,000
Yeah, you can do that.

1888
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:23,000
That's awesome.

1889
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:31,000
And what's also cool, though, is you can jump straight into your multiplayer by...

1890
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
They've got the character select in the bottom of the screen

1891
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:34,000
that you use your directional pad for,

1892
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:37,000
and one of those characters that will unlock in there,

1893
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:40,000
there'll be a countdown until it gets to October 1st,

1894
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:41,000
is your multiplayer character.

1895
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:45,000
So you can actually jump into multiplayer that quickly.

1896
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:46,000
I don't know.

1897
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:49,000
I think I'm just going to be spending a whole lot of time in this game

1898
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:53,000
because I've been looking forward to this since Grand Theft Auto IV came out.

1899
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:54,000
And you've literally said,

1900
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:57,000
you know, I don't think I'm getting the new consoles.

1901
02:08:57,000 --> 02:09:01,000
I'm not getting Final Fantasy XIV because my life will get eaten up by this.

1902
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
Yes, and that's the thing.

1903
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:07,000
I see myself playing a lot more of this than, say, Killzone or something.

1904
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:12,000
Yeah, if I get a console, of course I'm going to check out a game with it and stuff,

1905
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:17,000
but it was kind of the same thing when I got all three consoles last time.

1906
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:21,000
It was like, oh, cool, I got a PlayStation 3 and a Wii,

1907
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:24,000
and I played those for a little bit, but I always went back to my Xbox 360

1908
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
and were playing games on that.

1909
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:29,000
You can't play a ton of different consoles at the same time.

1910
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:35,000
I only have a finite amount of time to play games.

1911
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:41,000
And so I'm probably going to dedicate most of my time to this.

1912
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:45,000
And even Call of Duty and stuff, I'm like, you know, Call of Duty is kind of pretty awesome.

1913
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:48,000
I may get that just because we don't have anything to play at work

1914
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:51,000
because you can't really play online at work because our firewall is shit

1915
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
and we don't have a lot of bandwidth.

1916
02:09:53,000 --> 02:10:00,000
But, you know, if it wasn't for that, if we had access to Live and stuff,

1917
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
I probably wouldn't get Call of Duty either.

1918
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
And I'm still not sure if I will get Call of Duty.

1919
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:09,000
I probably will get Call of Duty, but yeah, it's just I'm going to be mostly at home.

1920
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:12,000
I'm going to be playing mainly Grand Theft Auto 5.

1921
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
You know what I was just thinking?

1922
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:20,000
With that lip syncing thing, we are going to have a ton of machinima.

1923
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
Well, they already have that in EverQuest too, remember?

1924
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:25,000
They have that option, so it's definitely possible.

1925
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:28,000
It'll be interesting to see.

1926
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:34,000
And shit, if you can pull this stuff off with, and I'm assuming it's not Kinect,

1927
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:38,000
why the fuck do you need Kinect for most of those voice command games anyway?

1928
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
That's what I'm always wondering.

1929
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
Bang, bang, bang, bang.

1930
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
Grenade, grenade.

1931
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
Why do you need Kinect for that?

1932
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
Oh, I know, because you have to still Kinect.

1933
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
You have to make a reason for it.

1934
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:55,000
All right, well, more Xbox One confirmations and so forth coming out this week.

1935
02:10:55,000 --> 02:11:01,000
One thing that was coming out from General Manager of Console Development Leo Del Castillo

1936
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:07,000
in an interview with Gizmodo said that the Xbox One will automatically detect if it's overheating

1937
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:10,000
and will make adjustments to cool itself down.

1938
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:13,000
This is, I guess, something that also happens with PCs.

1939
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:18,000
They can dial back the power of the box considerably, forcing the system into a low power state

1940
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
to correct any issues.

1941
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:25,000
So the way they designed the box, they don't want to actually intend it to ever have to go to maximum speed

1942
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:28,000
under normal environmental conditions, but there is overhead.

1943
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:31,000
So we'll allow the fan to go all the way up to its maximum speed,

1944
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:35,000
and if that solves the condition without the user having to do anything.

1945
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:41,000
My assumption is that is to curb the three light special that affected most 360s

1946
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:45,000
because the system was overheating, which, granted, they corrected later on,

1947
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
which I thought was through a method similar to this.

1948
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:50,000
Maybe Loki knows more about that. I don't know.

1949
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:57,000
They had a thing on the, well, it was when it got really hot that that fan would kick up to 100%.

1950
02:11:57,000 --> 02:12:00,000
So they did have something like that, but usually at that point it's like,

1951
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:04,000
eh, your system's kind of toasty right now.

1952
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:10,000
So I don't know. It's not new, but the whole throttling the voltage down

1953
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:13,000
and actually clocking the system down is kind of new.

1954
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:18,000
And once again, it just reads as though they're talking.

1955
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:23,000
It's like, okay, we've got to tell some, but let people know that it's not going to red ring.

1956
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:28,000
I mean, even though their systems haven't been red ringing since the old...

1957
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
It still haunts them a bit.

1958
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
Well, yeah, of course it would.

1959
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:33,000
As it should.

1960
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:37,000
I was so traumatized when my Xbox stopped working and these three lights showed up.

1961
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:42,000
Well, I think some things you have to consider when you're going to get an Xbox One is,

1962
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
will Microsoft fuck up the hardware again?

1963
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:45,000
First world problems.

1964
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:46,000
Just saying.

1965
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:49,000
All right. Moving on. DarkSakura.

1966
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
Me? Why do I have to?

1967
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:54,000
Okay, how about something for Minecraft fans?

1968
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:57,000
Well, not really Minecraft fans, but people who like first person shooters

1969
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:00,000
where you kill zombies.

1970
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:04,000
Or actually you shoot undead cop zombies.

1971
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:10,000
Notch put out a browser based zombie first person shooter game that's called Shambles.

1972
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:20,000
And it was originally made for the 70 FPS, which was basically creators making a first person shooter in seven days.

1973
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:25,000
And this one, basically, you have to collect yellow orbs that are dropped by dead zombies.

1974
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:29,000
And the only way you get guns and ambos is to kill dead cops.

1975
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:32,000
Well, I mean, is to get them from dead cops.

1976
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:37,000
And the only way that you get health is to get first aid drops that are left by dead civilians.

1977
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:40,000
So they're already dead, so I guess shooting them is okay.

1978
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:45,000
However, you get shot at if you open fire on them, so it's really kind of a weird thing.

1979
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
I don't know. Have you heard of this?

1980
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:51,000
I just saw that he did a game jam game.

1981
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
It was a FPS game jam game.

1982
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
It was a seven day week long thing.

1983
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:58,000
Yeah, it sounded interesting. I haven't played it.

1984
02:13:58,000 --> 02:13:59,000
It's browser based.

1985
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
Well, I'm kind of interested because he did it in Unity.

1986
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
And so, you know, that's what I'm working with right now.

1987
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:06,000
So it'd be kind of interesting to check it out.

1988
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:09,000
I like the style of his graphics.

1989
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:15,000
It is kind of 90s FPS with the pre-rendered hand.

1990
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:19,000
Oh, yeah, they're all very pixelated.

1991
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
That's pretty sweet.

1992
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:24,000
With, you know, shadowed out backgrounds and everything.

1993
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:28,000
It's pretty interesting. I just like that the zombies are just green.

1994
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:33,000
I'm surprised he didn't go with Minecraft zombies because that would have been even funnier.

1995
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
Yeah, but that would be expected.

1996
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
I like expected from him.

1997
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:47,000
So, something else regarding Notch.

1998
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:51,000
That one game, what was it? I don't remember what the hell it was called.

1999
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:52,000
Oh, I love that one game.

2000
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:53,000
The OX-10C.

2001
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
I played it that time with these people.

2002
02:14:55,000 --> 02:15:00,000
His space game that was supposed to be kind of a, not a sequel to Minecraft,

2003
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:04,000
but still sandbox-ish and procedurally generated.

2004
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:10,000
But anyways, he has decided to go ahead and stop development on it.

2005
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
Basically shelving it.

2006
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:16,000
This is due to kind of a creative block they had with the game.

2007
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:24,000
However, he was saying though that there are some fans that are actually interested in carrying on into the project.

2008
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:31,000
Basically saying that they're not using any of his old code or his name or anything.

2009
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:40,000
That they're going to just kind of, I guess based on what he had, sort of create a new game.

2010
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:46,000
Not really with the story and stuff, but just kind of a new concept with the original idea.

2011
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:48,000
I don't know.

2012
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:57,000
Which the original idea did sound kind of neat, so I was a little sad to see it go, but if he doesn't want to do it, it is what it is.

2013
02:15:57,000 --> 02:16:00,000
Yeah, I mean that's fine I guess to be inspired by them.

2014
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:04,000
They're saying they're calling it Project Trillic for now.

2015
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:14,000
And no idea what exactly they're going to be doing with it other than they're saying that they're not planning on selling it once it's released.

2016
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:19,000
But, I don't know, it would be interesting to see.

2017
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:26,000
I still didn't really understand what the whole game was about other than I know that you could create your own ship and then you could visit planets and stuff.

2018
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:34,000
I don't know, it wasn't Minecraft, but it was some sort of crafting into it and you can program stuff.

2019
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:42,000
I don't know, it was just very high concept, but I didn't really understand how it would play I guess.

2020
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:48,000
And now I never will because it's not going to work.

2021
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
It will come from somebody else now.

2022
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:56,000
Alright, well let's talk about another Kickstarter project because this is where a lot of studios are getting funding now.

2023
02:16:56,000 --> 02:17:02,000
But this is an interesting project of note because this involves Japanese developers turning to Kickstarter.

2024
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:07,000
One of them involved is the legendary Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Imatsu.

2025
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:15,000
What they're launching on Kickstarter is called Project Phoenix and it is an indie JRPG that is trying to be developed.

2026
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:21,000
The group behind it is Creative Intelligence Arts, it's a Tokyo-based company.

2027
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:27,000
And they do also Eminent Symphony Orchestra that does video game and anime arrangement stuff.

2028
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Hiroaki Yura will be the director and producer on Project Phoenix whereas Imatsu will score the title.

2029
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:41,000
It's not strictly Japanese developers because LA Noire game designer Vaughn Smith is supposed to be a part of it.

2030
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:52,000
But also fantasy novelist Yoko Inoki, concept artist in Final Fantasy Kiyoshi Arai, sound engineer John Kurlander who worked on Lord of the Rings and Elder Scrolls V Skyrim.

2031
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:55,000
So they kind of have this team together, but now they just need the money to pay them.

2032
02:17:55,000 --> 02:18:01,000
So they say this will be a JRPG with squad-based real-time strategy game design.

2033
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:05,000
It's going to be for Windows PC, Mac, and Linux via Steam.

2034
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:10,000
And they're hoping to also launch maybe some type of different limited version for iOS and Android.

2035
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:14,000
Possibly a PlayStation 4 port if the group gets enough funding.

2036
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:22,000
Well they got their funding pretty quick. They wanted $100,000 to do this with 23 days to go, five times that amount.

2037
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:25,000
They have over half a million in their Kickstarter for this right now.

2038
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
I got lost when they said it was a real-time strategy.

2039
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:30,000
A squad-based RTS game, but yeah.

2040
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:31,000
That just is not fun.

2041
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
No Uematsu will do the music.

2042
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
I'll take the soundtrack, but I won't play the game.

2043
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:41,000
So let's see some of the stretch goals. Double the amount of character in Monster Models, and Uematsu will do more music.

2044
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:47,000
So they've hit that goal. They're going to fight inside the Kraken if they make a million.

2045
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000
I don't know what that even means.

2046
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:55,000
But alright. Congrats to those guys for getting their funding. I hope the game's great.

2047
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:56,000
Huzzah!

2048
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
You got to make a game that Jamie wants to play.

2049
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:02,000
Yeah, make it a standard RPG with lots of shooting.

2050
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:05,000
Go to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

2051
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:09,000
Dark Tetsuya says, hey, we're at least guaranteed an epic soundtrack on this.

2052
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:10,000
That is true.

2053
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:11,000
Heck yeah.

2054
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:17,000
A game I mentioned in the first half that I'm going to mention again because it was so horrifically underlooked.

2055
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:25,000
Lost Odyssey had an amazing soundtrack as well, and I believe Uematsu did a lot of the music for that game.

2056
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
Didn't he?

2057
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
To the Google Cave!

2058
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:30,000
I believe he did.

2059
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:35,000
I think he did because Mistwalker, he was a part of that, wasn't he? Or I should say is.

2060
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
But the music sounds right.

2061
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:42,000
I'm looking it up real quick. Yes, he did do the music.

2062
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:47,000
I just had that moment of shit.

2063
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:51,000
He did do the music, right?

2064
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:58,000
Anyhow, let's get into this music that means it is time for the mailbag.

2065
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:06,000
Mailbag at orangelaundrydo.com is the place where you can send us emails.

2066
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:10,000
Dark Soccer will dive into the mailbag and hopefully pull out some letters worth reading.

2067
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:11,000
Deleting a spam.

2068
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
It's been really bad.

2069
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:16,000
I'm going to tell you guys, we will be changing that address soon.

2070
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:21,000
Actually, we need to start using Gmail service for our mail project.

2071
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
But you have to pay for that now, so...

2072
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:24,000
Nah.

2073
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
We'll talk off air.

2074
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:30,000
Anyway, I'll start with a short one.

2075
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:33,000
This is from Nark.

2076
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:44,000
Since you had such a fun time playing Team Fortress 2, I thought I'd put in a plug for a Team Fortress 2 light game that's still in beta but definitely ready for prime time loadout.

2077
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
Keep up the fun, casting Nark.

2078
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
I've heard of loadout.

2079
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
And we need to do another Epic Team Fortress 2 night.

2080
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:53,000
People ask me, like, well, when do people actually play on the server?

2081
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:56,000
It's there for you guys to get together.

2082
02:20:56,000 --> 02:21:00,000
Talk on Twitter and the forums and so forth and make something happen.

2083
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:06,000
I myself, um, maybe will be there tonight, but I don't want to promise that.

2084
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:09,000
So, um, probably during the week next week.

2085
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:10,000
There'll be a night.

2086
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
We just need to have a set-aside night.

2087
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
Maybe after Hoard House on Wednesday or something.

2088
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
Next email?

2089
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:17,000
Yep.

2090
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
I downloaded DuckTales on the PSN.

2091
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:24,000
It plays fine, but I can't help but think the game probably looks better in the original 8-bit.

2092
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:27,000
Since you guys played the original, how does it compare?

2093
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
By the way, I love the animation in the vaults. It made me smile.

2094
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
And that's from Rababa.

2095
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:34,000
I haven't played the original in a very long time.

2096
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
But from what I remember...

2097
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:37,000
Well, I think, you know...

2098
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:38,000
It's 8-bit.

2099
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:41,000
I think I touched on a lot of this at the top of the show.

2100
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:44,000
They did change some of the mechanics, and there's the new levels and stuff.

2101
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:48,000
And when you're actually playing the game, the gameplay feels pretty good.

2102
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:51,000
But there's all these cutscenes that were not...

2103
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:55,000
I mean, the original did have cutscenes, but they weren't the same.

2104
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
The poses are the same.

2105
02:21:57,000 --> 02:22:02,000
I mean, I thought that the new animation frames really harkened back to the original.

2106
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
I did love the way it looked.

2107
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
Yeah, it's really pretty.

2108
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:10,000
You know what warmed my heart in such a lovely way?

2109
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
Is hearing June 4A.

2110
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
And I didn't mean to rhyme, but it did.

2111
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:15,000
No, that was...

2112
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:16,000
I love her so much!

2113
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:21,000
I hate bagging on the sound, because I don't want to make it sound like it's the actor's fault.

2114
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:24,000
It is not, and I'm so happy they got back together, but it's just...

2115
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:29,000
I really need to hear the console one, because it sounded fine on Dan's computer.

2116
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:30,000
Well, anyway...

2117
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
It could have been his speakers. I don't know.

2118
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:33,000
So I think I got...

2119
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:37,000
Rababa, if I missed something, shoot us another email. I'll clarify.

2120
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
Now the jungle music is stuck in my head.

2121
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
Why not the moon music? That's the best music.

2122
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:45,000
Because the fortune cookie will explain it.

2123
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:49,000
The fortune cookie will explain it.

2124
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:51,000
Next email.

2125
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:52,000
Hi, O.L.R.

2126
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:56,000
With all the various policy reversals being done for the Xbone,

2127
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:59,000
you've got people around the net saying,

2128
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:02,000
Alright haters, Microsoft heard you, now will you get the Xbox?

2129
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:05,000
Dumb fanboys will, of course, and come up with stupid shit like,

2130
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:10,000
The power brick is huge, and I believe there are lesser known points that should be brought to light.

2131
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:13,000
Please feel free to correct me and offer counterpoints.

2132
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
By the way, this is coming from the Nasty Canasta.

2133
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:17,000
One of my favorite names.

2134
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:18,000
I know.

2135
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:23,000
First, I cannot help but think about the security breach that unfortunately affected Rab.

2136
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:27,000
Yes, Sony had their breach too, and when you consider everything that happened between Sony and Microsoft,

2137
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
it's like trying to figure out the lesser of two evils.

2138
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:35,000
But Microsoft tried to keep things under the rug and didn't seem like they were taking things seriously,

2139
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:36,000
which is utter bullshit.

2140
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:43,000
Rob, would you please briefly recap what you went through so I can point people to this episode about the incident?

2141
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
No, go through the archive. No, I'm kidding.

2142
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:52,000
So, yeah, even though the Sony service was hacked some time ago, we all know how that went down,

2143
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:55,000
I don't know anybody who lost money on the Playstation.

2144
02:23:55,000 --> 02:24:01,000
Not that that excuses what happened, because that was horrible, but I didn't actually lose money.

2145
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:08,000
But what did happen is that somebody else signed into my account and bought a bunch of stuff,

2146
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
bought those FIFA, like FIFA gold packs, something like that.

2147
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:16,000
They ran up, I don't even remember how much it was at this point, I want to say it was about $100, ran up.

2148
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:17,000
No, it wasn't like...

2149
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:20,000
It wasn't astronomical, but it was certainly enough where I missed it.

2150
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:21,000
It was something recoverable.

2151
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:32,000
Yeah, but they had taken this money, and I was always convinced, and I've never not been convinced of this,

2152
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:38,000
that the link was between EA and EA's online services, because it seems like everybody who was losing money

2153
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:42,000
was losing it to some sort of EA game, be it FIFA or something else, that they were going in and getting the money

2154
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:48,000
and linking my account to their pre-origin EA online service.

2155
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:52,000
Somebody linked my account to one of those, and so I had to call Microsoft.

2156
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:58,000
They took care of it and did what they had to do, but there was a couple days I was out that money,

2157
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:02,000
and it was really infuriating, kind of violating.

2158
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:06,000
And when that happened to you, the first thing I did was sign up for that EA account thing so that I could...

2159
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:10,000
Yes, because I told all the listeners, I said, if you sign up for that, then they can't do it for you.

2160
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:11,000
Exactly.

2161
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
So I remember doing that.

2162
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:20,000
But lots of people I know, like people who hadn't even touched their Xbox in forever were getting hacked like that.

2163
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:28,000
And everybody would say, oh, well, Rob, you're stupid, you fell for one of those fishing sites or somewhere,

2164
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:33,000
and I'm just kind of sitting here going, I'm not going to sit here and say, that would never happen to me,

2165
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:39,000
because I'm not going to be that full of myself that I can't think I might make a mistake once in a while.

2166
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:43,000
But I think it says something when people who haven't even used their Xboxes in so long

2167
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:48,000
and would have no interest in going to any website online were also having their money taken.

2168
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:53,000
And I kind of always, when Microsoft came out and said, oh, everybody's just getting phished.

2169
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000
That's the problem. We have a real phishing problem.

2170
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:58,000
I'm kind of sitting here going, bullshit, bullshit.

2171
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
And that kind of pissed me off.

2172
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:04,000
And have I forgiven them for it?

2173
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
I guess. It's been a long time.

2174
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
Have I forgotten? Hell no.

2175
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:13,000
And I try very hard not to save my credit card information or any of that anymore.

2176
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:16,000
Well, there's always lessons to be learned from any experience.

2177
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
Moving on.

2178
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:21,000
Second, putting free apps behind the gold paywall.

2179
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:27,000
I outright refuse to support a service that requires you to pay to use a program freely available elsewhere.

2180
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:31,000
No matter what features and perks are available, you should not have to pay and continue paying Microsoft

2181
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
just so you can watch Netflix or Hulu.

2182
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
That's why I have my computer.

2183
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:40,000
Lastly, Microsoft has a muddy reputation when it comes to indie developers.

2184
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:45,000
In the past, we've had indies like Team Meat and Phil Fish comments on how Microsoft poorly treated them

2185
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:49,000
when it came to handling advertising and patches on the Xbox marketplace.

2186
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:53,000
And while the recent change to self-publishing is good, we have Retro City Rampage creator,

2187
02:26:53,000 --> 02:27:02,000
Brian, I can never pronounce his name, Provinciano, stating to develop that Microsoft's indie development program

2188
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:09,000
is not on par with what other companies offer and there are strings attached with the change to self-publishing.

2189
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:16,000
Hearing all this makes me assume that the once digital-only offerings won't be as numerous as the PS4s.

2190
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
That's a nasty canasta.

2191
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:22,000
And just checking, no more email. That's it.

2192
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:25,000
So...

2193
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:29,000
Sorry, I got distracted with a private message, but there was something else in that email I wanted to reply to

2194
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:34,000
and I read it before the show. Can you recap the last two points?

2195
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:35,000
I closed it.

2196
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:41,000
One of them was about how poorly they treat the indie developers and how they're strings attached

2197
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:44,000
and they're not very user-friendly and not receptive.

2198
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:47,000
And then... Oh, thank you.

2199
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:51,000
The stuff being behind the gold paywall. Yeah, that's stupid.

2200
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
I don't know what else to say.

2201
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
That is going to make the decision.

2202
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:07,000
I would point at the Facebook commenter earlier who said the dad bought the PlayStation 3 just for the Blu-ray and the Netflix Hulu.

2203
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:13,000
If they have to buy an extra subscription, you're not going to sell an Xbox One to that individual.

2204
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:17,000
So, especially when you can do Netflix online for free.

2205
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:23,000
Granted, yes, you pay the subscription, but I'm talking about the viewer itself is on any Internet Explorer window for free.

2206
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:26,000
Microsoft probably shouldn't gate that shit.

2207
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:35,000
As far as the indie developers go, you know, Microsoft could make it right and they are moving in that direction.

2208
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:41,000
Even though Team Meat and Phil Fish are some of the louder indie developers out there, they're not the only ones.

2209
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:44,000
And, you know, Microsoft could, let's be real,

2210
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:50,000
Microsoft could throw a ton of money at other indies to get exclusives and make it right, so to speak.

2211
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:58,000
So, I really don't know what that's going to look like until we see what the release calendar looks like.

2212
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:04,000
But I want to say, didn't we talk about last week that they have talked about that the store is going to kind of intermix everything?

2213
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:08,000
The indies and big games and all that are all going to be mixed together.

2214
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:13,000
So, I mean, it does sound like they are trying to take steps to be better than they are now.

2215
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:18,000
So, I think Microsoft does realize they done fucked up and they're going in the other direction.

2216
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:21,000
And I think Microsoft should be giving some credit for that.

2217
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:31,000
I mean, they are giving all these bitches what they wanted, you know, at the sacrifice of potentially moving gaming in this new vision or this new direction, whether it be right or wrong.

2218
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:37,000
You know, they're going back to what works for people now.

2219
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:43,000
So, I kind of don't want to keep dogging them for doing that.

2220
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:51,000
Now, it is really going to be about the games and that $100 price difference between the two systems, which you never know.

2221
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:58,000
We could still hear that whole, now they may remove it, who knows, or take a loss to drop the price if they're that desperate enough.

2222
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:01,000
I don't know. I kind of don't think that will happen.

2223
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:07,000
But here's what I could see them doing, you know, as kind of a helping thing is bundling software with it.

2224
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:13,000
Bundling software or including a year of gold would be a huge thing too.

2225
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
That would be a super easy thing.

2226
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
It still wouldn't be enough for some people.

2227
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:21,000
It wouldn't, but it would definitely sweeten the pot and make it a lot more attractive.

2228
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:32,000
It's just like the Wii U needs to drop their fucking price already and all they have to do is remove the basic set and make the deluxe set the only set and make it the basic price.

2229
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:43,000
I think what they're planning on doing with the Wii U, I think they're playing it cool right now because they're wanting to see how the new software, these big titles that they have coming out, are what the uptick is going to be with that.

2230
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:46,000
Because if that does it alone, then they don't need to drop the price.

2231
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:49,000
If that doesn't do it, then they may drop the price.

2232
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:52,000
I think that's what they're waiting on is to see how it does it.

2233
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:57,000
But the longer you wait, the more it's going to suffer.

2234
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:03,000
Anyhow, that's it. I think I've said enough in response to that email.

2235
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:07,000
So mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com if you want to email us in the future.

2236
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:11,000
Let's move on, although we are going to look into changing that this week.

2237
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:14,000
So this might be the last week of that, but you can send it there for now and be safe.

2238
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
Mailbag at Orangelaunchradio.com.

2239
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
I don't think we'll be getting rid of it immediately.

2240
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:23,000
No, but having a break coming up with Labor Day would be a great time to change it too.

2241
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:26,000
Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week. It's that time.

2242
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
No, we should change it to your ass.

2243
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:31,000
So you can email your ass at Orangelaunchradio.com.

2244
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:32,000
Don't get crazy.

2245
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:51,000
I have an FU. It's to every fucking thing.

2246
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:59,000
Well, not everything, but a lot of stuff. I'm just, I'm still kind of fucked off over that whole job thing.

2247
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:04,000
But then again, I don't want to work for bigots, so I'm of two minds.

2248
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:12,000
And FU to Bubba Gump Shrimp Company, because I had your delicious fish and chips and it murdered me.

2249
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:17,000
I was sick for days after that and eat nothing but almond butter and honey.

2250
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:20,000
Which is true. I ate nothing but almond butter and honey for two days.

2251
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
And grapes. Grapes are good.

2252
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:27,000
But just, a big pile of fuckery is abounding and I'm getting sick of it.

2253
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:35,000
It needs to be, someone needs to take out the leaf blower thing and blow it out of my life.

2254
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:38,000
I'm done. So sick of this shit.

2255
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:40,000
Loki?

2256
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:53,000
FU to, well, to my work because once again, one of our reps left and they're not hiring another person to take that person's spot.

2257
02:32:53,000 --> 02:33:02,000
And so then I have a ton more work I have to do and a lot more accounts I have to handle and no additional compensation.

2258
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:03,000
Convince them to hire me.

2259
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:06,000
Nope, they're not going to hire anybody, so not going to happen.

2260
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:07,000
I'll drug them.

2261
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
It's not going to happen.

2262
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:16,000
And then also FU to, whoever it is in my neighborhood that's firing off mortars in the middle of the night.

2263
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:19,000
It's like, wow, it's like, what the hell are you doing?

2264
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:24,000
It's not fucking fourth of July. Why are you firing off mortars at like one in the morning?

2265
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:27,000
People. What are you going to do?

2266
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
Because people are invading.

2267
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:34,000
My FU of the week goes to drama. I don't want none.

2268
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:40,000
And if you try to bring drama into my life, you will not be as big of a part of my life.

2269
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
So keep your trauma away from me.

2270
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
Thank you and good night.

2271
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:50,000
All right.

2272
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:51,000
All right.

2273
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:53,000
That's it.

2274
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:56,000
Let's talk a little bit more Nintendo.

2275
02:33:56,000 --> 02:34:04,000
They had a lawsuit that was brought against them for their infringement of a 3D display patent.

2276
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:08,000
And this is, of course, with the 3DS.

2277
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:19,000
And they have, though, managed to reduce the, I guess, a reduction of what they were going to have to pay.

2278
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:23,000
So now it's down to thirty point two million dollars.

2279
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:36,000
And they're saying that also possibly there says maybe even being able to reduce it to even less than that.

2280
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:40,000
So I don't know.

2281
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:43,000
It sounds like maybe the evidence.

2282
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:51,000
They were saying that is, I guess, unsupported by the evidence presented at the trial.

2283
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:57,000
So maybe they were having a hard case and, you know, saying that they violated rights or not.

2284
02:34:57,000 --> 02:35:07,000
But either way, though, less money having to be awarded means that they can print more of those 90 dollar copies of Xenoblade Chronicles.

2285
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:12,000
All right.

2286
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:15,000
One more story for you guys, and then we're going to open up the Skype line.

2287
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:20,000
One eight seven seven game O.L.R., our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

2288
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:24,000
Again, that's one eight seven seven game O.L.R., Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

2289
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:27,000
But we have to talk about this, our last story for tonight.

2290
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:30,000
More erotic Oculus Rift games.

2291
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:33,000
This is what we really want the Oculus Rift for.

2292
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:37,000
This is the future right here is porn, porn, porn.

2293
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:52,000
So anyway, let's see, 3D Heaven is one that's being worked on, apparently, which is a detailed full body 3D scans, which would be like, I guess, a nude model that you can just kind of look at.

2294
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:56,000
Look at our boobies, look all around and look at our boobies everywhere.

2295
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
Try to reach out and touch the boobies.

2296
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:02,000
They give you like, depending on how you bend your head and stuff.

2297
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:06,000
Damn!

2298
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
Let's see what else there is here.

2299
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:11,000
ThryX Games Chat House 3D.

2300
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:16,000
It's real time chat client software called Chat House 3D.

2301
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:23,000
And I guess it's like a voyeur mode or whatever and you can, I guess, chat with babes and maybe they'll take their top off.

2302
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,000
I don't know.

2303
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:29,000
But whatever, it's all in the real, real vision, the Oculus Rift.

2304
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:36,000
3DX Chat is a multiplayer erotic game that is supposed to have Oculus Rift support.

2305
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:39,000
It's called the first 3D sex game with Oculus Rift support.

2306
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:44,000
There's also added support for the V-Stroker adult accessory.

2307
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:47,000
Do you have a V-Stroker, Loki?

2308
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,000
No, I do not have a V-Stroker.

2309
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:50,000
Why don't you Google that?

2310
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
And sadly enough, I know what that is.

2311
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
Is it like a flashlight? Really, what is it?

2312
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:57,000
It is like a flashlight thing, but it actually, it's USB powered.

2313
02:36:57,000 --> 02:37:02,000
Vrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.

2314
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
Eh.

2315
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
It's your handle, never get tired.

2316
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:10,000
It's masturbation for the lazy.

2317
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:13,000
Move my hand back for it, that's just too much work.

2318
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:17,000
I got a hand cramp, somebody get me my V-Stroker.

2319
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
Mom! V-Stroker!

2320
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:25,000
Okie dokie.

2321
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:27,000
Mommy I have to have the V-Stroker.

2322
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:33,000
Shut up Rob, you're 35.

2323
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:35,000
Jim Sully wants one, whatever it is.

2324
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:37,000
They don't make them in Canada.

2325
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
Ok, I have to digress in a second.

2326
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:45,000
Because they have something in Canada on the app store that I wish we had here.

2327
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:46,000
Alright.

2328
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
It's where you can be a parking attendant.

2329
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:53,000
And take pictures of people who park badly, record their license plate number.

2330
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:57,000
And then you get whatever their parking violation fee is, you get like up to 40% of it.

2331
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:58,000
That's fucking awesome.

2332
02:37:58,000 --> 02:37:59,000
Oh my god!

2333
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:00,000
We need this here!

2334
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:01,000
We need this here immediately!

2335
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:02,000
I know right?

2336
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
I posted it on Facebook a while back.

2337
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,000
Yeah but there would be so many complaints.

2338
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:07,000
Who cares?

2339
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:10,000
It's America and I can park bad if I want.

2340
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:13,000
I'll sue you because you misreported me.

2341
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:14,000
Yeah but that's the thing though.

2342
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,000
You moved my car when I wasn't looking.

2343
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:20,000
And the other thing that Canada has is Canada's worst driver, just saying.

2344
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:21,000
That shows awesome.

2345
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,000
There was an America's worst driver you know.

2346
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
It lasted one season because it fucked it up.

2347
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:29,000
Well do you know who won America's worst driver?

2348
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:31,000
The guy who started GamerX.

2349
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:32,000
Really?

2350
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:33,000
That's funny.

2351
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:34,000
As long as he's not driving.

2352
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:37,000
In one of those weird it's a small world kind of things.

2353
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:41,000
But for the record Canada's worst driver is awesome because it's actually educational.

2354
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:45,000
I haven't seen either one.

2355
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:46,000
Oh my god it's so good.

2356
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:47,000
Alright.

2357
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
It's like the only reality show I like.

2358
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:50,000
Alright.

2359
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:53,000
Let's see.

2360
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:55,000
Was that it?

2361
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
Yeah that's it for the Oculus Rift games.

2362
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:58,000
That's enough.

2363
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,000
We learned what a Vstroker is thanks to this so.

2364
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,000
Alright we are going to go to the Skype line.

2365
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,000
1877 Game OLR.

2366
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLaunchRadio.

2367
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,000
The phones are open for business.

2368
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:09,000
So give us a call.

2369
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
Meanwhile I'll get to Twitter topics in a minute here.

2370
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:14,000
But I wanted to check with Loki if there's any last minute stories.

2371
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:15,000
Not really.

2372
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:19,000
I thought honestly it was kind of a slow week.

2373
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,000
But let's see.

2374
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:26,000
Yeah there's not a whole lot going on this week.

2375
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:29,000
I don't know.

2376
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
We can talk more about Grand Theft Auto 5.

2377
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,000
Hey you want to talk about Grand Theft Auto 5?

2378
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:36,000
Acute Games.

2379
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
They've got a new visualizer that's coming to the PS3.

2380
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:43,000
So you can get something other than the rotating globe.

2381
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:45,000
Alright you're saved by phone calls on the Skype line.

2382
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:47,000
So let's go to the Skype line.

2383
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
1877 Game OLR.

2384
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLaunchRadio.

2385
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:52,000
But we do have a call.

2386
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:53,000
Hi you're on OrangeLaunchRadio.

2387
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:54,000
Who's this?

2388
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:55,000
It's Ranma.

2389
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:56,000
Hey Ranma.

2390
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:57,000
How you doing?

2391
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:58,000
I'm doing good.

2392
02:39:58,000 --> 02:39:59,000
How about you?

2393
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:03,000
I'm enlightened now that I know what a Vstroker is.

2394
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:04,000
What's up?

2395
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:05,000
Not too much.

2396
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:08,000
I just wanted to say a couple things about last week's podcast.

2397
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
I believe it was.

2398
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,000
Because I was kind of on the road at the time so.

2399
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:15,000
Oh right you're coming back from one of your many conventions.

2400
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:18,000
Yes I am such the convention whore.

2401
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:20,000
You really are but that's why we love you.

2402
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:23,000
Well do you have a, are you now immune to all the confunks?

2403
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:26,000
No.

2404
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:32,000
We'll never be immune to the confunk, the con plague, or con anything.

2405
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:37,000
There was a special breed of it though that was out around final May 2001 called the Dorbola.

2406
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:40,000
People in TBR Freak remember that.

2407
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:45,000
What's on your mind regarding last week's show?

2408
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:50,000
Well I just want to say Rob, I really appreciate what you said about GamerX.

2409
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:59,000
Because a lot of what you said reminds me of some of the conversations I've had with cosplayers, con goers at anime conventions.

2410
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:08,000
Because a lot of what you were talking about you kind of find there because of like similar fans of anime, different genres and so forth.

2411
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:13,000
You know to kind of get together and like understand and like relate to what it is.

2412
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:16,000
No they all get together and bash the homestucks.

2413
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:24,000
Let's not because if we're going to go that direction nobody's getting on this skype line so let's not.

2414
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:25,000
Yeah.

2415
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:33,000
But anyway you're right so kind of how like having a safe place for you know like minded individuals absolutely.

2416
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,000
Yep yep definitely.

2417
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:38,000
So that's kind of is that the thrill that you get at anime conventions?

2418
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:48,000
Part of it yeah because I mean I ain't going to lie ever since I had this VOG shirt my desire to cosplay has kind of cut down a lot.

2419
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:54,000
I still cosplay mostly for like meetups and stuff but I just like wearing a shirt that has who I'm representing and who I am.

2420
02:41:54,000 --> 02:42:02,000
And I'm taking pictures and handing out cards you know it's like well this is where I want to be and I'm happy where I am.

2421
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:07,000
You know that's funny because I was thinking like oh I got to cosplay for I got to cosplay for Dragon Con.

2422
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:13,000
I got to think of a cosplay like I can't let Travis out I can't let Travis outshine me even though he totally will with that awesome costume.

2423
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:18,000
I got to figure out what I'm going to do but then I'm like well I should just wear my VOG shirt honestly.

2424
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:19,000
Rob.

2425
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:20,000
What?

2426
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:25,000
No no no you and I are fighting someone with a sewing machine and we're making your damn Joker costume.

2427
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:27,000
Yeah in two weeks good luck.

2428
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:31,000
Hey Evan and I made my Baiken costume in three days.

2429
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:32,000
Fair enough.

2430
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:37,000
Well come on Rob you could be we can send you a Black Mage costume.

2431
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:40,000
I did like that costume that was a lot of fun.

2432
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:43,000
But I do have an idea for a perfect costume for you.

2433
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:51,000
You should go to Dragon Con dressed as Jesus with a rainbow sash and just walk around with a glass of water.

2434
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:54,000
Wouldn't that be a glass of wine?

2435
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:58,000
Exactly.

2436
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:05,000
I don't want to offend people though and you know going to the deep south you know although Dragon Con is a certain crowd.

2437
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
You're not going to offend them.

2438
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:14,000
I have gone to conventions where people in the center where people have dressed up as Jesus walking around with the little Arby's logo above their head.

2439
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,000
Rob should be Buddy Christ.

2440
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:18,000
Better.

2441
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:25,000
The most hilarious thing I thought about doing because I don't here's the thing I don't want to have to keep shaving my fucking beard off for costumes.

2442
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:30,000
So whatever I dress up as I really want to have a mustache and beard so I thought about maybe doing Tingle.

2443
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:35,000
But I don't want to have to.

2444
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:40,000
I don't know I don't know I don't want I don't necessarily want pictures of me like that on the internet.

2445
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:41,000
Joker's cool.

2446
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:43,000
Joker I'll have pictures of me as Joker on the internet.

2447
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:46,000
You know what I think you should do if you did the Joker costume?

2448
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:49,000
You should do the first Mass Effect uniform.

2449
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:50,000
Sure.

2450
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:51,000
Because that one I think is a cool one.

2451
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:54,000
Yeah.

2452
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:59,000
Brad from Pod Culture says that wouldn't bother anyone and Blackwell says my friend cosplayed as Buddy Christ.

2453
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:03,000
I underestimate the crowd at Dragon Con clearly.

2454
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:05,000
Maybe just wear a bathrobe and be the dude.

2455
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:08,000
I want to be offended at Dragon Con.

2456
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:10,000
I really hope cosplay pushes the envelope.

2457
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:11,000
I know I know I know.

2458
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:15,000
We get you leather undies and you can go like Final Fantasy 11 outfit.

2459
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:16,000
No.

2460
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:17,000
No.

2461
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:18,000
No.

2462
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:19,000
And let me check my iPad.

2463
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:20,000
No.

2464
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:26,000
Well if we're going the route of leather we can just smoke this hard gay razor Ramon.

2465
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:28,000
But Rob would have to shave for that.

2466
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:35,000
I don't think I like where this conversation's going so you need to change the topic or get the hell off the phone.

2467
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:38,000
We'll find you something good.

2468
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:39,000
Alright.

2469
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:41,000
Okay alright well changing topics I'm getting out of here.

2470
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:42,000
Alright.

2471
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:46,000
Well in case you haven't heard I am officially a college graduate.

2472
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:47,000
Congratulations.

2473
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:48,000
Mazel tov.

2474
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:49,000
Thank you.

2475
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:55,000
And in regards to that in one of my classes we had to do a term paper about an invention.

2476
02:44:55,000 --> 02:45:02,000
So and it was like minimum of five pages so I sat there after drinking thinking about it and pushing myself.

2477
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:07,000
I pretty much shat out an eight page term paper on the history of the Nintendo Entertainment System.

2478
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:08,000
Nice.

2479
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:11,000
That's awesome.

2480
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:12,000
Awesome.

2481
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:19,000
So I have to say by the way because I'm coming up on another degree this semester just because I've changed my major so many times.

2482
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:21,000

02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:22,000

2484
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:25,000

You can tell I'm talking about Phantasy Star.

2565
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:30,000
It's Canada it's what you do on a horse farm.

2566
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:33,000
So Phantasy Star yes on Sega.

2567
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:37,000
Good memories?

2568
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:41,000
Yeah when I was there was a rough time in my life when I was about 12 years old 11 12

2569
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:46,000
my parents split up and I'd have to go see my dad every two weeks and it kind of sucked

2570
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:50,000
but every two weeks I went to go see him I would get to go to the one store in town that

2571
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:53,000
rented Sega games because there's only one store in town that rented them and sure enough

2572
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:59,000
one day I got there and I found Phantasy Star it was a four mega cartridge or something

2573
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:02,000
it was called it was the only one they had right it was a big deal if you get the four

2574
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:08,000
mega cartridge and I picked up this weirdo Japanese RPG game and I wasn't really into

2575
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:10,000
them because I was only 12 or it wasn't really a cool thing to do.

2576
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:11,000
Right.

2577
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:14,000
But I brought it home and I played it all weekend and I was like astonished at how awesome

2578
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:18,000
it was man I got my spoiler alert I got my little mirror shield and I shined it and

2579
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:21,000
fucking reduced his face and suck that bitch and she all turned to stone and shit I was

2580
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:25,000
like this is the fucking greatest game ever and it was one of the first do you remember

2581
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:28,000
that shit man Odin gets the mirror shield and only Odin can hold it.

2582
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:32,000
I remember this shit man trust me this is a big deal in my life so listen I'm telling

2583
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:36,000
you right now Rob from me to you okay listen it was the first game that you could first

2584
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:41,000

2585
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:46,000
old shitty blowing them cartridges and you could save it so I saved my game to the first

2586
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:49,000
spot and I put a note remember when they used to have game manuals I put a sticky note on

2608
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:31,000
left me her phone number and her address in the fucking game manual wow can you imagine

2609
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:35,000
telling your 12 year old girl your fucking phone number and address inside of a game

2610
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:41,000
nowadays can you fucking imagine that shit again this is 1990 fucking 2 right 1992 did

2611
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:47,000
you call the number because I'm thinking 65 year old man no dude I called the number

2612
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:51,000
and it was a fucking 12 year old girl that lived like maybe five six blocks it was far

2613
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:56,000
from my house but we would hang out for every two weeks for like maybe six months afterwards

2614
02:51:56,000 --> 02:52:00,000
and we would play the game for like I don't know an hour or two and then we would play

2615
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:06,000
another game and you were 12 wait a minute well we wouldn't do anything more than you

2616
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:14,000
would expect wait a minute so you had the fantasy star hookup those games hold on are

2617
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:18,000
you telling me are you and we are supposed to believe we're supposed to believe and all

2618
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:24,000
these chatters are gonna believe that fantasy star got you to first base yeah exactly it

2619
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:29,000
got me to first base we were only 12 but I kissed her I would kiss her a little bit and

2620
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:33,000
then we would play the game she'd be like no you should buy you should buy the fangs

2621
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:37,000
for the cat and we don't have to buy the staff for the old man because he's stuck so

2622
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:42,000
I'd be like Noah's the fucking man he saved us and of course fuck Noah buy the get the

jewels for the get the collared jewels for the we fucking have these little arguments

2624
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:51,000
for like oh at least six months until summertime came and then she took off for like what oh

2625
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:55,000
so we beat the game like three times together guy it was awesome we just kept playing that

2626
02:52:55,000 --> 02:53:00,000
same game so that's how it ends she just what that that's how it ends she just disappeared
