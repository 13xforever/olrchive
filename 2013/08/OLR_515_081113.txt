Orange Lounge Radio
Hello everybody out there on the internet
And welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice
It is Orange Lounge Radio
Episode number 515 for this, August 11th, 2013
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here to talk about video games
Gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, gaming lulz, gaming...
Insert whatever here
With my co-hosts, say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers
Hey how you doing?
I'm unemployed again
I'm sorry to hear it, that's...
I feel better about it once the situation became clearer to me
I see, so it was one of those, maybe we are better off seeing other people
Let's just put it this way, I don't want to work for a hypocritical conservative Christian company
That ruins other people's businesses
Well it is important to, you know, work for an employer that you can kind of get behind their values and all that stuff
They had a really good environment there but once I found out a bit more about them
I really started to feel very uncomfortable
I was like, what's that sticker on your car? What's that equal mean?
Oh it's for the human rights campaign, I support gay rights
Oh! Next day, fired
That's pretty much how it went
I'm not laughing at you, I'm just laughing at the awkwardness of that
It was quite awkward, that and also actually requesting the major Jewish holidays off that morning
And they said, oh we made the decision this morning, you're just not a good fit
Oh dear
So I'm not actually openly accusing them of anything, I'm just saying that those are the circumstances
Well you can just work for vognetwork.com full time
You know what, if it paid me I would be really happy
Except, oh yeah, there's that, sorry about that, we don't have a budget
Oopsies
Alright, say hello as well to Techmaster Loki
You there, Loki?
Yeah
What are you doing over there, Loki?
I was pulling up my stories
Oh, I see, trying to get prepared
Now that's a little late, that's alright
How you doing, what's new?
Not much, just, I was watching some
What was it, a...
Mugen fighting thing
Yeah, I think it's coming up later in the show, right?
Yeah, so
Alright
It was pretty funny
A little obsession of yours through the past week or so?
Nah, just the last couple days
Way to kill some time
Yeah, so any big personal news you might want to share with listeners tonight?
Yeah, I guess
So, we're having another child
Congrats
In January
That's amazing, how many weeks along does that make, Nelly?
16, 17
I guessed it on a show this morning
And one of the hosts announced that his wife's expecting
So that's babies everywhere!
Yeah
For the record, I'm not pregnant
Not yet, careful what you wish for
No, I'm gonna time against my biological clock
I'm gonna sabotage that motherfucker
I'm selling my ovaries
How much could you get for those?
Actually about 10 grand each
Alright, in all seriousness, Loki, congratulations to you and Mrs. Loki
Thank you
Good luck with all that
Having another kid, it's gonna be a busy, busy household
Yep
And there are some congrats being shown in our chat room
We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network
vognetwork.com
Again, that's vognetwork.com
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 Eastern on Sundays
Lots of great podcasts for you to participate with
And geeky content, including articles, audiobook reviews
And movie reviews and movie rankings
And lots of other fun stuff coming soon
VOG is gonna have a big presence at Dragon Con
And I'm very excited about that
My first time in Atlanta
So I hope to see some of you guys there
Also joining us on the show tonight
We have a guest here
A frequent guest of the show
It probably helps that, you know, the show's at his house too
Everybody say hello to Alan Alchemy
Hello
How you doing Alan?
I'm great
You're great
I just want to make sure we can hear you tonight
So how have you been lately?
I've been alright
Yeah?
Decided to finally guest on the show again after like a year
Gracing us with your presence
It's appreciated
Alright, what's new with you personally?
Not much
Yeah?
Usually when I'm either working, I work swing shift
So I'll listen to OLR from work
Or when I'm not working and you guys are all here doing the show
I'll kind of just play video games in the office
Or fold laundry or just be domestic
Yeah
So I decided I'd sit in on the show tonight
Okay
Well, I know we're gonna talk about your gaming week a little bit later
But like in general, what kind of games have you been catching up on lately?
Most of the stuff, if it has a Steam trading card thing in it
Then I've checked it out either a little bit
Or you know that trick?
If you don't want to play the game, you can just let it run
And then go take a shower, go watch TV and come back and have your cards drop
So you got sucked into this whole Steam trading card thing too
Yes
Like I did
What's the allure of it?
It's just, it appeals to my sort of OCD completionist
You know
Yeah
And the thing is, is you can earn each badge like five times
So once you earn, once you go like, yeah, I got all the cards
Clarity badge, okay, now do it again
Steam's like, do it again
Spend some, put some money in your wallet, buy the cards
I am eligible for the booster packs for like I think 13 or 14 games
And I still have about maybe 15, 16 more that I still need to play to get the things to drop
Not a single booster pack yet
Yeah, I've not gotten anything either
But then again, I haven't really been playing much
I got my second one yesterday
Yeah, I'm pressed like a panini, I hate you
I have a foil card for Saints Row the Third
Oh nice, you can sell those for a little more money
I forgot who I was talking to but someone needed all three of the only cards that I had
So I'm just like, here take them
Wait, how did you get a foil card if you haven't gotten any booster packs?
I get, it was one of my randoms that guy
Really? Oh, I didn't know that
Those will drop, yeah
Oh, okay, well that's never happened to me
So that's something you have up on me
There you go
There you go
See, the problem is I don't know where to buy and sell those cards
I don't know where that's
It's the community marketplace
Yeah, I have no idea how to get through that
Oh, it's easy, it's, oh, believe me, they make it easy
We can show you
It's really a brilliant thing if you make about it
And it totally plays to people like Alan, and myself admittedly
Who have that OCD need to collect something
Why?
Cause you can
Because
Since we were playing earlier this week I thought I might actually have to get a hat
And so
Well, let's talk about some of the things that, you know, we were off last week because I was away at GamerX
So let's, I want to talk about GamerX, but I want to talk about the other stuff that's gone on in the past couple weeks
One is that, I don't know how it happened
Christopher
Was it Christopher? I guess Christopher did kind of start
Wasn't he doing like a review or something?
Yes, he wanted to review it for Horde House
And to be fair, that was ActDeaf kind of poking at him
Which he's been kind of poking all of us for a while going, hey, play Team Fortress 2
Hey, play Team Fortress 2
And then Phil from Koopa Club I think got in on that a little bit
Hey, play Team Fortress 2
Play it, do it, do it
And finally Extro was like, fine, is it free?
Yes, I'll try it
And so we all played one night on, I guess ActDeaf has this server, abandoned server he knew of
So a bunch of us played on there and loved it
We had so much fun, like it was just so much fun just sitting there blowing people up
And it was great because you don't have to worry that you're not good enough
Or that people are going to yell
It was just a lot of like-minded people having a good time just shooting the shit out of each other
And I was like, oh, I got to get us a server
We need our own server
We need a VoG server for this
We have a Minecraft server sometimes
Why can't we have a Team Fortress 2 server?
As a trial run
Yeah
Test it out
So I remembered I had like $100 sitting in a PayPal account somewhere I hadn't used
So I was like, alright
Oh, just a random $100 sitting aside
All my money
When he pointed it out, I was like, that must be nice
Well, you know what though? It's the modern day equivalent of burying it in your backyard
And I was like, you know you haven't been earning interest on that in a year and a half, it's been stuck in there
Well, you know what? It came in awfully handy this week, didn't it?
So I bought us a Team Fortress 2 server
Actually, the server was only like $20
So I got that, it's like a 12 person server
And all of the information is available on our website, VoGnetwork.com
Look at the forums and you can check out the information that's in the video games forum
All the info you need about the server is there
You might need a little help with the password
But let me just remind you guys, we used to have a little mascot, a little ferret on the show
That's on my bedside table sitting on Duffy's head
Yes, DarkSakura abducted it
It doesn't work anymore
And no, I do not have the hero's cap, I need it
Just in case you need that information when you look at the post
And it is password protected, but if you ever check it out
Like in your Steam client, you see a bunch of jerks on there with screen names that you don't recognize
You should let Rob know and he can spin the password to something else
Absolutely, because we want it to be the welcoming environment for people that are like
I want to play Team Fortress 2, but I don't know anybody and I'm not very good at shooters
No one is really good at Team Fortress 2
It's too fast, it makes me feel old because I was the soldier class with the shotgun
And I was in the same room with someone, strafing
I couldn't hit someone with the shotgun
And they killed me, I was like, I have a shotgun in your face, I can't hit you
I feel a little silly that I'm just now getting into this game that's like, what, five years old?
It came out with Orange Box, right?
I think I played it a little bit on Orange Box on 360, but it's not even the same like now on PC
It just feels so different
I should probably play that, but I've had other things on my plate
You also might get your little sicky-sick
I feel like it plays most like OG Quake to me
Although it's more cartoony
Which, duh, it makes sense
I mean, Team Fortress 1 was a Quake mod
The speed of it reminds me of Unreal Tournament
Which I loved
Oh yeah, that's true
Definitely some more games throughout the week
Alan and I would love to play tonight, but we have errands to run after the show
But that might not stop other people from playing after the show
Active in our chatroom says Team Fortress 2 is around seven years old
Oh my gosh, really? Holy moly
Alright, speaking of other games and things
Dark Soccer, well, I guess it's bugging out right now
But you were trying to open your Animal Crossing town for the first time
I had three people in there and the connection crashed
So I'm gonna open it one more time, but if it does it again
I'm gonna have to leave it closed for the rest of the show
Because our primary concern is keeping our bandwidth open
Yeah, it is, that is, so we don't want to
But it would be fun if you want to go visit Jamie
You got the VOG pattern, right?
I did, but it won't let me put it on, so I think I just have to recreate it
Well, Bobby's pattern's probably better anyway, so
Go get the one from his town
But no, I actually can't use something that I got from somebody else
I'll have to make it myself
Dope
It's fine
Alright, so there's that Animal Crossing going on
And then Minecraft coming back at some point, right Loki?
Yeah, I want to get around to it
Alright, so we want to know what other games should VOG have a server for?
We'll look into it if you have a serious request
Something that we ought to check out, let us know
Free to play is really good too
That's what makes Team Fortress 2 so great
Because it's free to play
And people even make a little money off it, right?
Getting the item drops and crafting and all that
I mean, not anything to write home about
But, you know, something to buy trading cards with, right?
Alright, so we missed the show last week
Because I was at GamerX
And Alan was there with me
Yay
Which was great
And if you haven't heard about GamerX
Although I'm pretty sure I've talked about it ad nauseam on the show
GamerX was a Kickstarter backed convention
To really just be a safe place for GLBT gamers
But it's really important to know
The con was not only for GLBT gamers
And I think I went on this tangent
It might have been on Horde House
But it always pissed me off when I heard people going
Well, where's our straight gamer convention?
Why can't we have a straight gaming convention?
And I'm like, well, okay
That's what YowieCon is for girls
When y'all are getting disowned by your parents
And getting lost past in states that affect your lifestyle
And people are bullying you
And calling you names on Xbox Live
Then you can have your little convention
But otherwise it's a 365 day a year convention
The point was not to be like
Gaze only and everybody else get out
It was to be a safe environment
Just like I described the Team Fortress 2 server
Is a safe environment for people
Who are bad at Team Fortress 2
It's creating a safe place
Where people are not gonna be screaming
FAG FAG N-word N-word
It's like, bro
When you play Halo and you have to turn off
Everyone else's mics because you get sick and tired
Of being called a breeder a hundred times a match
Then come talk to us
We'll talk about a straight convention
I don't think that's happening
The bullying is bad enough with gay, lesbian, and bisexual
And then throw transgender into it
It was very eye-opening in some of those panels
To hear what transgendered people go through
In games and so forth
It was really eye-opening
I had a marvelous time at the convention
It was honestly something I kind of never thought I would see
So it made me just very happy to be there
I did have some small reservations
It was a first-time con
And so there were some first-time con issues
But I want to just make sure I am crystal clear
It was really good for a first-year con
Beyond really good
My minor issues were
One, the space was too damn small
Although the Hotel Kabuki in San Francisco is lovely
And I loved that it was in Japantown
So all that stuff was nearby
It was just a clusterfuck of people downstairs
I actually had a panic attack from claustrophobia
That has never happened in my life
But because the lines were spiraling around
And there were a few exits
You were in a basement
I just suddenly pictured
What happens if this place gets caught on fire?
And I literally had the whole high blood pressure
And all that stuff
I had to get out of there
So thankfully I did
Once you could make it into a room
Whether it was the exposition room
Or the gaming room
Or a panel room
You were fine
But the people waiting in line
Plus the through traffic
Because people got to get from point A to point B
They don't give a shit about a panel
Waiting in line if they're not interested in the panel
And the hallways for that
Were only maybe two or three people wide
And the ceilings were really low
Like only 10 or 11 feet
So it was really just claustrophobic and gloomy
Which you know what?
I'm sure when they looked at the space originally
And kind of had their thought
What it was going to be in their head
What a terrible problem to have
That your con is too popular
So next year
They have said it's coming back next year
And I'm pretty sure they said
They are looking into a bigger space
Although I don't know if that necessarily meant
They were looking at a different space
I kind of got the feeling that they might just spread it out more
I don't know
We'll see
The Hotel Kabuki has hosted different cons before
And what they count on I think
Is that a lot of that traffic is going to start going into the Kintetsu Mall
To go shopping at Kinokuniya
Or go get crepes or whatever
Maybe they'll spread it out across different hotels
And Japan Video really likes it
Because they do a lot of business during that
Oh yeah
It was great
The environment was great
The Japanese street fair was going on
The overflow for the con
Was always in that mall
So yeah it was already kind of a part of the circuit
So my other bit of creative feedback
Would be that Alan and I went to the Friday night party
Which was for the VIP Kickstarter folks
Because yeah I did kickstart a bit of money into this
Because I really wanted to see it happen
So we went to the Friday VIP party
Which was fine
Music talent was great
Let's say that
Music talent was great
I know some of VX JasonXV's friends were
They had a Chiptunes DJ
That sounds cool
Yeah they were really good
But the host of the evening was Pandora Box
And she was a contestant on RuPaul's Drag Race
Full disclosure I loved her
Rooted for her all through that season
Ditto
And I've even
On the fun little side project
RuPaul's Drag Race podcast I did with the Game Buoy guys
I even defended her many times
And I do love her and follow her on Facebook
But maybe Alan you can describe this better than I can
What the issue was with Pandora
Well you know it's supposed to be an inclusive convention
A lot of people had aired concerns online
That it was just going to be a bunch of white gay dudes
Because that's what San Francisco is really
And we were going to shut out the BLT portion of the convention
So she gets up there
And within like a minute she's talking about
There are lesbians play video games?
Ew I don't like vagina
And everyone's laughing
Once I was born and fell out of one I was done
And it's like okay gay men don't like pussy
That's your joke
Which is like really insulting
I hate when I hear my peers say it
It's like really?
Yeah and then she was kind of going after the nerd thing too
Like oh yay we're having this convention
You guys can get out of your basement for the first time in a year
And I'm just kind of like
I don't know I'm torn because I understand
I understand drag queens are supposed to be bitchy
Like that's their whole thing
You know so I should just like kind of roll my eyes and do whatever
It's like a big roast
Haha nerds in basement that's the first time I've ever heard that joke
Exactly yeah that's totally original
I was just kind of like
Dude you are like the first thing
At the first con
Of this first great thing
And that's what you're going to do with it?
And everyone in that room had donated
I'm sorry it was 100 bucks right?
Yeah something like that
So I was just a little bit like
And then she started talking about Grindr
Nerds are introverts here all on Grindr right now
And it's like they'd probably be on Grindr anyway
Haha you're on Grindr bitch
Haha
So I don't know I just was kind of
I was over her
It wasn't the best
I wasn't a fan of her I didn't like go home and unfollow her on Facebook
Or something I was so mad
But I was just like that was a little lazy
Her cosplay was good
That I'm sure her team put together for her
She didn't know what the fuck she was wearing
Shade
Well alright enough negative
Because honestly lots of positive
You know I was just in my basement in Animal Crossing
Haha we did a panel there
Podcast Cross Zone and had a lot of fun
And I just want to give a shout out
And big hearts to the guys
From Koopa Club
From Game Bar
From GameBui.org
Which I'm sure everybody was reciting that URL
At the end of the day after that panel
To Fox Van Allen from Wow Insider
And the Techlicious
Is that the one he writes for? I look really stupid right now
I forget which one he writes for but
He was a great moderator
And the other folks that came
To the panel
I was really worried no one was going to show up y'all
And we had a relatively full room
A few MTC's but not a lot
And had a great time
And I was telling jokes, people were laughing
We were having fun with it
And yes that panel should be up soon
Koopa Club is going to put it on their feed
So I'll let y'all know when it's up
And because it was the last panel scheduled for that room
We got, or you guys rather, got to run long
So that was good
Yeah that was good
And we had a great time
That was really the highlight for me
Getting to do what I love to do
You know, I want to go next year
Oh yeah
Because I was actually trying to think of
Next year is my 20 year high school reunion
Oh my gosh
Shoot me in the face already
But I want to do one con next year
Assuming I don't move to Washington
So I was actually thinking of making that my con next year
Although I have another friend
That's definitely trying to get me back to Fonamy
For Homestuck cosplay
Oh geez
You know what, I wasn't gonna do it at all
Until she's like, we need to do this
And it's better when you have two people
I was like, fine, I'll make a costume
I was actually gonna suggest GamerX look into the
San Jose Convention Center, I mean yes
I know that's not the heart of San Francisco
But San Jose is still the Bay Area
It's easy to get to
They need to check the one that YowieCon is at
Which is right outside Burlingame
Where I
Right by the airport, right?
Yeah, and it was a really good venue for the convention
YowieCon is still relatively small
And it was perfectly accommodating
To everything, especially having
Electronic glass toys in
The dealer's room
And then they had JunkieSpot there
So I think that, you know, they need to
Did they have a dealer's room?
Yes, it was small, like everything for first year con
It was very small, and some tables
I'd like to talk to the organizer actually
He's a pretty approachable guy
So if you can give me that information
Wink wink, nudge nudge
Yeah, I'd definitely be going next year
I had a good time
Yeah, we didn't do Sunday
Because we ended up taking a bunch of people
Up to our friend's place above the Castro
And drinking until 3 AM
And we got trashed
That was the best thing we did
But it was just great to have everybody in one place
It's like, who drank all this tequila?
You did, it's 3 AM
Oh shit, so yeah
Jonko from Koopa Club and I were doing shots of Fireball
And you guys know how I am after one drink
I think I had like four shots of Fireball
But being in an enclosed space with all those people
Plus the alcohol lowering your immune system
Con crud
Yeah, and exhaustion
Don't forget that, that's a big one after Clue two weeks ago
Con crud hit Rob hard
I have been sick since
Somehow I didn't really come down with it
Until Tuesday
I was really sick, I'm still getting over it
Like you might be able to hear it in my voice
Yeah, I've been sick since Tuesday
If you listen to Hoard House on Wednesday
I'm really out of it
Yeah, I'm still trying to recover from that
Not fun, but I better not get that
When I go to Dragon Con
You remember my advice
And do not drink soda at a con
Drink nothing but tea
SSJ 100 Matt in our chat room says
On a scale of one to grandpa, how drunk was everyone?
Every single person
Was drinking except for
Xtaphir, I believe
From what you're describing, on a scale of one to grandpa
You were on girl
The slag kick was driving
So he didn't drink anything
Oh yeah, that's right, he didn't drink either
And Brad from Pod Culture in our chat room
At live.vognetwork.com is saying
Yay, Fireball, and more Fireball is coming to Dragon Con
Here we go
There is something I'm making, Rob, that you should try
If you like the Fireball
I'm making ginger rum
With actual ginger and actual cinnamon
I wish it could come to Dragon Con
Well, you know what, if someone's got money
I actually do have places to stay
If you are
If you are going to be in Atlanta
Join us at Dragon Con
I don't know if we have the final details on the panel yet
But I'm sure Bobby will be spreading that all over the internet
As soon as we know
I think it's tentatively Sunday night
Around the time that OLR would usually be
Which does mean we are not going to have a show again
Labor Day weekend
I apologize because that's two shows in about a month's span
That we're going to be missing
Enough, got to do it
So, it's Labor Day weekend
I think a lot of you guys will be doing various things
Conventions of your own and so forth
Any last words on GamerX, Alan, before we get into our gaming weeks?
Nothing, that was it
Okay, Loki, do you have something to say?
Labor Day weekend, Saints Row IV
All day and all night
Alright, let's talk about our gaming weeks
The types of video games that you've been playing this week
I actually think we'll let Alan start tonight, our guest
Alan, how's your gaming week?
So we're going to spend an hour on this segment
I've been playing everything
Speed it up
Really quickly, back in March and April
I was trying to play Dead Space 1
Because of the hype around Dead Space 3
It was too scary, I chickened out, I haven't touched it since then
Necromorphs are terrifying
And it's claustrophobic and it was very scary
I also played and beat GTA IV
The main game with Niko
Twice, I beat it
And then I ran through and beat it again
I haven't done the expansions yet
More recently, because of the Steam Trading Card stuff
I've played
McPixel
McPixel's awesome
I burnt out on it kind of fast
Because I was trying to get 100% on everything
Where you have to find all the jokes
All of the things that you can click wrong
Basically, there's a bomb
It's just one screen, one room
There's a bomb somewhere
You have 20 seconds to click stuff to figure out how to defuse the bomb
It's kind of like WarioWare
It's very quick-paced
Once you fail, you move on to the next one
And it's just trial and error
So yeah, that was a lot of fun
It's really neat
I got 100% on the first couple stages
And then burnt out on it
I played
Revenge of the Titans
Which is a tower defense game
Which I played for the Steam Trading Cards
I don't like tower defense
So once I saw that's what it was
I was like, okay, I'm not playing this
Past the hour and a half it's going to take me to get
My little Steam goodies
The longest time I've ever played a tower defense game
Is Plants vs. Zombies
Which is a great game, but I just don't care
It's kind of like Bobby with first person shooters
I understand the strategy behind them
I just don't care
And then the game that I really want to talk about
Is Hotline Miami
Which is phenomenal and I'm really kind of irritated
That I haven't played it since
It came out in October and I'm just now discovering it
I got it, I haven't played it yet
It's sitting in my library
And I don't have it installed
Oh, I do have it installed, sweet
But I haven't played it
The music is phenomenal
The creators of the game were inspired by that movie
Drive with Ryan Gosling
Awesome
Which is kind of like a noir, neon
New 80s feel to it
And I think they even thank the director of that movie
In the credits
It's ultra violent
I'm not too great about it
Aside from the flawless soundtrack
Drive was scored by Kravinsky
Who is this French electro producer
They have a bunch of similar artists
Doing the soundtrack
With a completely Polish name
So yeah, the soundtrack
Look it up on YouTube, it's phenomenal
I think we're going to play two of the songs
From Hotline Miami during the break
Yes, but that would only be for the live listeners
Also to say though, if people do want to see
The game in action, Classic Game Room reviewed it
Not too long ago
And he does a really good review
It shows plenty of the gameplay
If I have time tonight, maybe I should do some live stream
Because I haven't played it yet at all
So that might be a fun one
It's a fast game
It's also very hard
It took me a while to figure out the learning curve
What the hell you're supposed to do
What's in chat
I'm laughing because Fifth Dream in our chatroom
says, oh look, I have Hotline Miami in Steam
Who knew?
I've done that
If you bought Humble Bundle 8, you got it
And one great thing about it
It is ultra-violent
But even just the title screen
And the music that plays
There is something disturbing
And really eerie about that game
That they nailed
There's a part halfway through the game
Where the player character starts to hallucinate
And you start seeing dead people at the 7-Eleven
Or in his apartment that aren't really there
There's a song that plays in your apartment
At the start of each mission
I'm uncomfortable playing this
And it's not because of the violence
Which does get a little out of control at times
But the creators for such a
It looks like a Super NES game
Basically
Really captured
It's a very unsettling game
And it's really amazing in that sense
And I think that's
I played some Team Fortress 2
With the gang
And no Mass Effect 2 or 3
I kind of burn out on that
Not for good
But I have my third and fourth Shepherd
And I'm like, I'll finish their careers later
Torchlight 2, I've been playing a lot of that
You enjoying Torchlight 2?
I've hit a plateau
Where I'm on an overworld map
That I keep dying on
Like I just get steamrolled
Because I'm playing it on veteran
Which is kind of like the hard mode
Not elite or super insane
I was doing fine, I kept quaffing my health potions
I was keeping up, but this one map
Trying to get to the other side of it
Where the quest marker is, I just get destroyed
So I need to
There's no way to grind really, because monsters don't respawn
I'm going to have to do some co-op sometime
It'll be fun
Alright, well if that's it for your gaming week
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
Totally not playing Animal Crossing
Right this second, right?
Screw that game, no I'm kidding
I'm totally playing Animal Crossing right now
Yeah, Misty's in there, Deft is in there
We did have Fifth Dream earlier
I don't know if Fifth Dream returned
Look out for Misty, she'll hit you with a bug now
When you're not looking
Well I told everyone they can have my pears
It just saved me some perfect pears
But yeah, playing Animal Crossing
You know
I am actually back to Mass Effect 3
Because I am taking my modding practice
Another step further
Someone put out a hair mod
Where you can use Brooks' hair
Instead of Allers, which actually makes Allers look decent
But
There's another
Hair mesh out there
That I actually finally got
To replace the standard Chacwas hair with this one
But I can't get it to run without
Crashing my game because I need to get the
Right texture for the hair working
Even though I think the cute texture would actually
Work just fine with it, but I'm thinking out loud
So yeah, I'm still playing with it
But I finally figured out how to do mesh replacements
So that's one thing
I am
I'm actually
Going to probably start livestreaming again
My playthrough of Mass Effect 3
Just so I can
Finish
The missions I was on
Because I'm like halfway through the game right now
And a couple people asked me, so I might do it
I also
Am playing Borderlands 2
With Dan
Because Dan's like, you're going to like it, it's going to be fun
You won't get that sick
I had a headache by the time I was done
But I wasn't like frighteningly
Nauseous like I usually am with
FPS's
Which yeah, for any new listener, just because we
Get new listeners every few weeks or so
You
Well, you get sick from
Playing first person shooters because of the motion
Stuff right? I honestly think that the sickness
I was getting was
With low res
Polygon
Because the game that's always done it to me worst
Was Goldeneye on
The Nintendo 64
And the early 3D
First person shooters
I've noticed that I'll get a little sick with like
With Portal 2 for a while
And then I was fine
And I'm having the same adjustment curve with
Borderlands 2 so I think I might be
Getting over some of that
I still can't use my
3DS and I think they
No, someone just left
I still can't play the 3D mode on my 3DS
I'm trying to catch a bug
Or something so I can gauge the distance
But
I'm
Also playing
Back to
Playing some Drunken Robot
Pornography which is awesome
That's the Jumping Flash
The Jumping Flash with guns
And dying really quickly that's
Really freaking hard game, yeah that game's awesome
And
I
Oh no wonder that was Act F that
Left to go get cherries to sell at my retail
Stay focused girl
And also thank you for loaning
Me Kid Icarus because I've really wanted
To try it, yeah no worries just watch the hand cramping
It's a little crazy
Try to put it on a flat surface to play
If you can
Well going actually back to that I'm actually
Thinking about
Starting Bayonetta
That's a fun game, yeah I loved
It and I didn't get too far in it but
Since I've started drawing again
I haven't had the problem as
Quickly with my hand cramping I mean it still
Does it like especially if I
It actually does it more if I'm writing
Than if I'm drawing
So but I've actually sat down with the controller
I started Final Fantasy 7
Which is almost impossible to play with the damn keyboard
So I'm probably gonna be
I use a 360 controller
Yeah we've got that and Dan's
Been playing
A lot of really
Weird Nintendo knockoffs
On a Sega Genesis emulator
It's been hilarious
And he actually just went through
The Ballad of Gay Tony again
Which is really really good for
GTA I actually really like the story
So
Between the two of us we've actually
Had a pretty bustling gaming
Week, despite being
You know working full time and then
Finding out hoops they don't like
When you're open minded
Anything else for your gaming week?
Ummm
I know there's
Another game but I can't think of it off the top of my head
Alright we'll jump in later we'll come back to you
Loki how about you?
See I played a bit
Of Team Fortress 2 this week
And
What else oh Saints Row the 3rd
I went through I was just trying to finish up some more
Achievements on the Steam version
And I went ahead and
Finished off all the
Vehicle
What was it
The car theft stuff
Saints book vehicle stuff
Where you have to go collect all the vehicles
And hijack them and stuff
So I did all that and now I have to finish up
Like some of the other stuff in the Saints book stuff
One of which is
The achievement of playing
With both sexes so I have
Now a female character that I created
Just to get that achievement
Because I've been playing mostly my male character
And so I need to get
Two hours out of the way on that
To get the achievement and then
Ummm
Mostly just trying to get
Some of the other stuff that
I've missed there
What else did I play
I tried playing some F-Zero GX in Dolphin
Just to see how well that worked
I figured because Dolphin's been out for a long time
That I should be able to run that game and
And Dolphin's an emulator
For Wii and GameCube games
And it
Ran like shit so
Oh well
Well remember it takes a lot more CPU power to emulate
You know
That actually reminded me
I've been trying to get
Planet Harriers working
Haven't been able to yet
And then what else did I do this week
Little bit of Call of Duty
Modern Warfare 3 still
Just because
And ummm
I pre-purchased
My Saints Row 4 on Steam
When's that out? That's out what two weeks?
It's out a week from Tuesday
Oh wow
Have you done the character creator?
Not yet
Originally on PC I was going to import
My character
But
Because my game is modded
It won't let me upload my character to their server
Yet they're going to somehow
Fix that soon
That they're going to allow you to upload your modded characters
Just because the problem was they have
Slider mods
I don't really have that on mine
But they have slider mods and stuff
And that can really screw up characters
If you mod a character and then someone downloads that modded character
Without having that stuff done
So
They don't have that yet but they're going to allow that soon
But
I was going to import that character
So I have one for my Xbox
I'm just going to import that into 4
Because I didn't really need to mess with it yet
But it looked fun
And I've been working on my game that I'm making
So that's it
Good luck with that project
I'll try to be quick with my gaming week because I honestly
Haven't played a lot of new stuff
I've been doing the card collecting thing
We're kind of in a lull in gaming right now
Before the storm really picks up
I'm really pumped for the release of Final Fantasy 14
Realm Reborn
That open beta starts a week from
Friday, or last Friday
So it's only days away at this point
There's a character creator out for 14 by the way
Which is also a benchmark
So if you're curious about 14 at all
You can download that and check it out
It's free of course
See how that works and play with the character creator there
And see what your character would look like in game
And the graphics engine that's really good for that game
So
I was messing around with that
Also Team Fortress 2
Visiting some older stuff in Steam
There's a question I actually played through
Probably further than I did on 360 when it first came out
It's a great little game
And it looks better on the PC than it did on 360
I played that for about 20-30 minutes
It was like okay this is neat
And then I alt tabbed it and went AFK
It's fun, I like that, it's a good game
And then I've also still been playing the MOBAs
I can't remember if I talked about this on the last show
I think I did a little bit
But I started getting into League of Legends
And Dota 2, kind of both of them
I don't know, there's things I like about Dota 2
And there's things I like about League of Legends
So I'm kind of juggling them both right now
Which when you're trying to learn them is really confusing
But there's these Dota 2
Championships going on right now
Which you can actually watch, but what I like about it
Is that it's not necessarily just like this Twitch thing
Or something where you're watching a livestream
But you can actually watch in the game client
Like while the people are playing
And I thought that was kind of neat
And apparently if you pony up some cash which goes into the pot
You can get in-game items as well with that
So that's kind of neat
Okay, well, and you know
Valve is pretty proud of Dota 2
I'm pretty sure, so yeah
So I've been playing that
I've also been playing League of Legends
Dota 2 I'm still mostly in the single player
Tutorial stuff, like doing the bot matches
And all that, but League of Legends
I am playing a lot of co-op versus bots
I'm not playing player versus player yet
Because I feel like I still suck
And I have a lot to learn
Also, I'm playing League of Legends
I'm playing League of Legends
I still suck and I have a lot to learn
Although the last match I played
Last night I think it was
Actually boosted my confidence quite a bit
Which is funny because we lost
A match against beginner bots
But I was the only person
Out of the five to get any kills
And I actually had like a streak going
That actually kind of boosted my confidence
I was like, alright, I do know what I'm doing
Compared to these four other people
So how bad could it be going into a
Player versus player match
So everybody pray for me
As I go into that
But that's pretty much my gaming week
So, we will start to move into news
But I do always like to take a minute for housekeeping
Again, we will have no show over
Labor Day weekend, but that's still a few weeks away
Because I will be in Atlanta at Dragon Con
Which I hope you will come by
And say hi at the VoG panel
Which will be Sunday night at Dragon Con
If you're there
Also, you can friend us on Twitter
Twitter.com slash O-L-R and Facebook
Twitter.com slash Orange Lounge Radio
Be our friend
Let's get into the news
It's also been a bit of a slow news week
But we still got a few things we want to point out
That's going on
So, Loki, why don't you start us off
Alright, so, let's talk a little bit about
Amazon and
Yet another company getting on the
Android game console bandwagon
So, Amazon
I guess is playing on
It's sort of a rumor right now
That they're developing a console
I'm assuming it's going to support the Amazon
Marketplace
As far as details beyond that
No idea what it's going to be
But basically
There's still rumors that Google's
Developing their own console
So
I don't know
We'll see
They're saying that maybe we'll see it
Around Black Friday
But
It's funny, the more and more I hear
About other companies coming out with their own consoles
And the specs
And the features sound better
The less and less I like my Ouya
Well, and it's also one of those things where it's like
Good God, what kind of
What did Ouya do?
Now I'm worried that everybody wants a piece of that
Because the Kickstarter was so successful
It's like we're seeing all of these clones
And I'm like, surely
We see the end of this coming
Where all this crap saturates
The market, and then none of them do well
I don't think it's necessarily that they're going to
Saturate the market, it's just going to be
It's, I mean, you can
Kind of compare that to tablets
Oh my God, there's so many tablets out there that
Saturate the market, and none of them are going to do well
You know, I think that's what's going to end up happening
When you get all these individual marketplaces
Because you have
Ouya, which is on its own
Marketplace, and Amazon, which is its own
Marketplace
And the Mad Catz one though
Is on just a regular
Google Play Marketplace
So that might be okay
I would assume that the Google one
Would be on the Google Play Marketplace
So it's just when you start
Segmenting the Marketplace like that
That's when you run into problems
I mean, it's great for indie developers
That want to, I guess, get their game out
Because now they can put it on all these
Marketplaces because, I mean, porting your game
From Android to
The Amazon Marketplace
Basically just putting it on the Marketplace
Because they're pretty much the same
And then also spec wise
Some of these newer consoles
Are going to be a lot better spec wise
Than the Ouya
The Ouya may have done
Okay as far as Kickstarter goes
But the way they've been handling everything
Oh, Game Stick was the other one
That's another Marketplace, it's its own thing
And then there was the other one that was streaming
Games, I don't know
There's a ton of different options out there
And at the end of the day
They're all kind of offering similar things
There's not a lot of exclusive stuff
That differentiates one from the next
And
The experience isn't all that great
At least for the Ouya right now
Because that's the only one that's actually to market
So far
I don't know
I think this question is a bit of an ahh
But other people are asking it
So I'll ask it too
Do Sony and Nintendo have anything to be worried about
With these consoles, why?
Yeah, no
I don't think they have anything to be worried about right now
But the way things are going right now
Is everything kind of trending towards
People being, especially a lot of these companies
Being interested in indie
Developers
And
Definitely trying to
Get indie developers on their platform
Because that seems to be where a lot of the interest
And innovation is nowadays
And so you have these indie platforms
Out there like the Ouya
It may not be a very powerful platform
But it's an independent platform
So far, I mean it's still closed
But you gotta have some sort of
Restrictions in place so there's not rampant piracy
Because as far as I'm aware right now
I don't think you can really pirate Ouya games
Although I haven't rooted my Ouya yet
Soon
So I don't really know how it really
Treats that, but
I think that's kind of been the draw
Is there's all these indie games
I think that if a company like
Amazon or even Mad Cats
Or Google come out
With their own, well we know
Mad Cats is, but if they come out with their own
Device, I think it's going to be
A better piece of hardware
And as far as the customer service
And the way everything's handled is going to be a better
Device anyways because they have experience
With developing
Things and actually being able to market it
And have the platform, they're much bigger
Than a start up company like Ouya
Or PlayStick for example
So I think it's promising
But I'd have to see what their specs are going to be
I mean hell, Amazon
Making a console wouldn't be that
Crazy considering they have their own
Tablets so
Why not? I can see that happening
Alright
Well, we'll see if there's any truth to this
I think the one thing too I want to throw out there
Is that it would be interesting with Amazon because
They do have all the things that are tied to Amazon Prime
Such as, you know, their version of Netflix
Which, you know, big deal
All those boxes will play the streaming
Video things, but it could be interesting as well
What kind of like special things they might
Offer that would be exclusive to their
Console, you know, keep in mind they have
The Kindle stuff too, they have
The movie marketplace
Where you can buy things, it would be interesting
To see if there might be any synergy
There. But the price even
Of their tablets is coming down so much that
Like, I would think it'd be
In their best interest not necessarily to
Come out with a console but to maybe come out with
Something that you can play your
Games on your tablet and then
You can stream them to your TV
You know, even almost like that Google
The Chromecast thing
Or, you know, and have a controller
And stuff so then that way you can take it
On the go and you can play with it at
Home and stuff. How I really wish
The, you know, Wii U was kind of handled where you
Could, you know, that'd be awesome to have your games
Loaded on like a compact
Not a compact flash but like, you know, some sort of
You know, flash memory
Or something like that and then that way
You can play them on the go instead of having
It stream from your console, of course, you know
It's not gonna work hardware wise but
It would still be kinda cool if you could
Do that as easily and I know that was
Something that they wanted to do with like the Vita
Even where, you know, you play your
Vita version of MLB
Or you play your PS3 version of
MLB and then you flip it over to
The, you know, Vita and you take it on
On the road and that kind of stuff. I think
That would be really cool but
I don't know, we'll have to see. I mean right now it's just
A rumor and I mean hell
Apple, I mean that's been
A rumor for the longest time that Apple's gonna do something
With Apple TV or something that turned that into
A console so
I don't know, I don't, it's
All these different options though
That are not necessarily
Like the major console manufacturers
Are good options I think for indies
So, and even now, even with
The way they're kind of, you know
Opening it up a little bit for indies
Especially like the Xbox One and the PlayStation
4 and stuff, it's just
It's a good time to be indie I guess
Alright, well let's
Move on to some more news
This company isn't necessarily indie
But people sure love their games and
To the point where people will go
To great lengths to figure out where the
Heck this company might be going and
It's Valve and it's about
An upcoming project that's been spotted
Left 4 Dead 3
Now this is a little more than
You know, well since they did 1 and 2
A 3's gotta happen at some point, but here's what happened
Apparently a Valve
Studio tour was given
To some folks who actually
Got a snapshot of somebody's
Computer that actually had references
To, well it's like a change log
Of everything that's been going on
It had references to Source 2
Which we know has been a thing, Valve's openly said
They're working on Source
Pretty surprised, but L4D3
Was also there
So, you know, it's something
That's happening, could that be the first
Game to use Source 2
Who knows, and not
Unfortunately Half-Life 3, I don't know
But apparently
More thoughts come out after it
That say, hey, this is actually something that
Is happening, so
Alan, I'm sure
You've been following this a bit, what do you think?
Well the Source engine, which was
Designed and made for Half-Life 2 originally
Which is 2003-2004
Anything that Valve
Has put out that's not Dota
Is on Source, Team Fortress 2
Portal, Half-Life 2
Episode 2, it's all the modified
Original Source engine
If Source 2 is done
To the point where they can release L4D3
On it, even if it takes another 3 years
If that, like, this is the product
This is the Source 2 engine running, that means
Half-Life 3, they have
An API that they're going to build the game on top of
So now, announce it
Or should you just give up hope?
Mark Laidlaw, who I
Tweeted with a couple weeks ago
He posted a vine of him in an elevator
And he was kind of hovering his finger
Over the 3 button
Hovering, then the last second he pushes L
For lobby, like he won't push 3
And I was like, ugh, like a dagger in my heart
Wasn't there something else too, where it was like
He said something about playing Pikmin 3 and you tweeted him
Like, what's it like?
Yeah, he was like, Pikmin 3 is really good
And I was like, so Mark, what's it like to play a sequel
With a 3 in it, what's that like?
And he favorited it and then said
Oh, we're all slaves to Nintendo
Valve hearts Nintendo confirmed
Yeah
I love Twitter for things like that
That's why Twitter rules
I do find it funny that people are looking forward
To L4D3 considering that there was a
Boycott campaign for L4D2
If you remember that
Oh, right, because it came out so soon after the first one
Its street date was almost a year after
L4D1
But that was, of course, 3, 4, 5 years ago
So now 3 has had enough time to
Simmer
Tigerkaw in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says
What if Valve is like Half-Life 3
Exclusive on Xbox One and PlayStation 4
Since both consoles have PC hardware
Gabe would never let that happen
Gabe would have to be pushed down a flight of stairs
Portal 2 was on PlayStation 3
Well, I guess it was on Xbox too, but it was way better on PlayStation 3
With the Steam integration and all that
It was way better on Steam
That's true
I would also think too, honestly, if Steam's got this
Steam bot, and I said this on the show before
I said if they want to sell a million of those
Steam boxes, make Half-Life 3
A timed exclusive to those Steam boxes
And watch that shit sell
I mean, that's all they'd have to do
Right?
Alright, anyhow, let's move on, more news
DarkSakura
You know how we all complain about GameStop
The evil G
As we have been calling it
Basically, the federal judge
In Camden, New Jersey said
Uh, yeah, you can sue them, go for it
Basically saying that
The games that were being sold
There did not fully
Advertise
That there might be other costs
Involved, like for online passes
Which, honestly
I think the lawsuit
Is a little bit on the frivolous side
Because it is common sense
However, to quote a
Deadpool meme
Common sense, so rare it's a super power
Yeah
So, because these people lack common sense
And other people agree
That they shouldn't have to have common sense
GameStop is being sued
Well, I mean, if someone's grandma
Wants to get, you know, 8 year old Timmy
Modern Warfare 3
And she's trying to get herself a deal
And buys it
And she gives it to him
Thinking that it's new
Or he thinks it's new and it's used and now he can't play online
She didn't know, there wasn't a sticker on it
Right, so
It's for people buying games that don't play games
But it's still though
It's technically
I mean, this is a decision for the publishers
Technically the game is complete
You can play the game
And sometimes even a portion of the multiplayer
But, you know, it's additional DLC
That you need to purchase
You know
I mean, even though it's kind of sad
Is when they did this lawsuit
That now it's already fixed
The problem is already gone
So, I don't think
That they should be
I don't think it's GameStop's decision
I don't think they should have to be
Responsible for something the publisher does
Which is ironic
Because EA has now said
That they're doing away with online pass
It's very attractive too
So any of those games that you buy
They're gone
But unfortunately it doesn't really change
In the world of a lawsuit
Because there was a window of time when it was the case
I want to say, if I remember correctly
I think these are the same guys that were suing
Subway and actually won
For the footlongs
Did they win? I thought that hadn't been decided yet
Oh, okay, I wasn't sure
But for the footlongs being 11 inches
Which, come on
The foot is fucking 12 inches
That also raises the red flag
A little bit, though
Okay, now we're talking about a serial lawsuit
Type of individual
You always kind of have to raise your eyebrow
With that, like, potentially
Abusing the system
I
I think that it's something
That, yeah, it's good to have on your label
But, in the end
And
I think
People are looking for excuses
To sue
The moment somebody is the slightest
Bit put off
That the first thought
Is sue
And I think that
It would have
Been better
Better handled by sending a
Letter of complaint to the company
I don't know if they did that
I haven't seen anything about that in the article
But, um
But they should have
Instead of, you know, just suing the company
The right step would have been
Contacting the company and say
Hey, this wasn't on the label
We weren't aware of this
What can you do? If they don't
Respond, then the next logical
Step would be
Better business bureau
Then the next logical step
May be a lawsuit if they are that
Pleased, but in the end
I
I really think jumping right to that
Conclusion is frivolous
You know, it is also stupid too because
Even says right here, it's one of the guys
Bought, you know, Need for Speed
Hot Pursuit
And, um
He tried to play it online and then it says
He was hit with an extra fee of $15
No, he was told to purchase DLC
It was $15. At that point, if he doesn't like that
He should have returned it back to the store
Which he could do within seven days
I don't understand
That might be GameStop's way out of this too
I don't understand, you know, why
And no one was forcing him to do that
You know, if anything
If you want to get into it, if anything
I think people should be suing fucking EA
For having to pay those online passes
And then them shutting the servers down
That would be a little bit more
Worth merit
I mean, even now, it's just kind of like
Okay, well, they're done with that
But I don't think GameStop's really
Should be the blame of that stuff
You're buying a used copy
A used copy is not the same as a new copy
It's gonna, you know
Anything that you buy used is not gonna be
Of the same quality as a new thing
So, I think this is gonna be thrown out
I think that they're gonna
They're not gonna win it
I actually think they're gonna win
We'll see
Didn't we kind of predict that this might happen
When we first heard about the online pass
That the consumers would not be educated on it
And that this kind of thing would happen
I'm almost positive it had to be said
I mean, there's two phrases
That are gonna be going out of
I think common parlance, you know, soon
One of them is, you know
The buyer beware
And the other one's going to be shoppers remorse
Or buyers remorse
Because you can just sue now if you're remorseful over your purchase
Dungeonbuster in our chatroom says
There are people that still have trouble interpreting
ESRB ratings
That's true, maybe the consumer's not gonna learn this stuff anytime soon
That's why they need to rate them like they do movies
Yeah, I agree with that
I only think the ESRB is so
Confusing because it seems pretty
It says what an E for everyone
I don't understand how that's confusing
It's not to you and me
At what point though, I mean
I was actually dealing with my library
Accounts and stuff and we're talking about Final Fantasy
XIV, you know
They're ordering it thinking it's a game
That they can rent out or loan out to
Their customers even though
On our internal website
That they order off of, there's a big
Fucking banner
It's bold and there's
Yellow behind it that says
Will not work
MMO, cost money to play
Not recommended for
Renting out
People are stupid and they see Final Fantasy
I didn't know
What more can you fucking do
To tell these people
Or inform them
Even the ESRB, they tweak their shit
So that it would be more clear
There's nothing you can do
To get it through these people
Parents and stuff, they just don't give a shit
No amount of changing your logos
Sometimes parents just don't understand
Sometimes just parents don't give a shit
Or consumers don't give a shit
And they're whatever
They're not gonna learn
What it is
I hate to say it, my mother is a prime example of this
And actually there are
Psychological studies going behind this
People get comfortable with a certain idea
And anything that
Supports their idea, even if it is
Wrong, gives them
Basically a happy
Chemical response
That's why there's a lot of stupid Republicans out there
Wow
Well that's why Rush Limbaugh exists then
But it goes either way
The moment that something
Is said that's
Contrary to this idea
That is imprinted into their minds
It of course forms an opposite
Response, the first instinct
Is not to listen to it, is to dismiss it
Even if it might save them
Money in the long run, and then when they go back
To suffer the consequences of it
Of course, oh well nobody told me that's because
You have a selective fucking memory
Alright
Um
I wanted to go to another comment in our chatroom at
Live.vognetwork.com from ShadowNextGen
Who says, there was some good GameStop news
This week too
I'm assuming that's the reprinting of Xenoblade
Right? Oh yeah
That came across my Twitter, that has to be it
Yeah that has to be the good GameStop news
Someone, and I'm sorry if you're in chat and I just blanked on who it was
But someone on my Twitter feed posted
Xenoblade Chronicles
Used
And it was 80 bucks
Used from GameStop and if they're reprinting
It they have to redo that used
I had no idea that the printing was that limited
And it should just be GameStop exclusive
It's weird that they're reprinting it too
When the Wii isn't really being pushed right now
It's supposed to be all about the Wii U
You can play it in the Wii U though right?
Well of course you can, but I wonder if the prices drop
Maybe it's like $20 at this point
It would make a really good
Thing to have on Wii U
Please
Them dropping the price of something that's going
For $90 right now
And it's exclusive to them, yeah I'm sure
They're totally motivated from competition
To drop that price
Like hell they are
It's probably going to come back at 60 bucks
Alright let's move on with some more news
Loki
Alright so there was a couple
Bits of information from
Microsoft this week about
Things
Including Xbox Live family packs
They are going away
Obviously since we already knew that
And they're going to be converted into individual
Gold accounts on August
27th
That's probably around the same time
The new dashboard update is going to come out
And we're going to have some other things tied in with that
One of the reasons why they're doing this
Is because the
Xbox One
For example is going to allow you to share
Your gold membership, sort of
Basically the way they're going to do it
Is you have
Your console
Only one person or one
Live account on that console
Needs to have live gold
So say I have my family
And each one of them has an Xbox Live account
I only need to have gold
For everybody to play online
Regardless of which account is signed in
And then also the same thing
Like if I go to my friend's house
And sign into my account
They can also play on Xbox Live with me
While I'm over there
Then they came out and started talking about
This digital game sharing thing
Which made people think, oh my god they brought back
The digital game thing that they were talking about
Before and it was so fucking awesome
Which we never saw and we had no idea what it really was
So first off
They came out and they
Phrased it kind of like that, hey we're bringing
The digital game sharing thing back
You're going to be able to do that
The problem is, it isn't fucking new
This is the same shit that you can do right now
On the Xbox 360
It's basically, I buy a game online
For example, say I bought
I don't know, an Xbox Live arcade game
Say I bought a
Super Street Fighter 2 or something like that
And I have it on my console
I've downloaded it
It's good to go, I can play it
Anybody that's in my family
Or anybody else, any other account on
My console can play that as well
If I go over to Rob's
And download the game
Sign into my account
And download the game on his console
We can play it
Full version, as long as I'm signed in
But as soon as I leave, it's going to revert back
To the demo version
It's exactly the same fucking shit that happens right now
And they fucking marketed it as some brand new
Fucking thing, and guess what
A bunch of the fucking unwashed masses
Xbox fanboys or whatever
Holy shit
Game set match, fucking takeover
You're so fucking stupid
You don't even realize
How stupid you are
To be fair
Cool, this game sharing thing
It's the same shit you have now
And you're like, oh my god
I'm going to buy an Xbox One now because it's so amazing
You're so stupid
And that's why they're going to be able to sell those consoles
Because you're so fucking stupid
You're so fucking stupid
And I love it because I was complaining about that shit on Twitter
And some random fucking idiot that works on a
Microsoft store is like, no that's not how it was
This is brand new information
I'm like, you're a fucking idiot
You sell this shit and you don't even fucking know what you're talking about
You dumbass
Alright?
Except I said that in my head
I'm not going to waste my time doing that
He was all red in the face just going, okay
You couldn't fit it in 140 paces
Oh, I showed so much restraint
I was going to film a YouTube video and all that shit
I was going to like, oh hey
What the hell, it's black magic
My 360 turned into an Xbox One
To be fair
Just to play devil's advocate a little bit to your rant
Loki
One of the things that Xbox One is offering
That Xbox 360 didn't offer is the whole game streaming
Where you can start playing the game right away
Without the mega long installation
So, I mean, doesn't that kind of
Yes, while this isn't a new thing
Doesn't it really enhance
Because it wouldn't be practical
For me to like, say, bring Mass Effect over to your house
And we have to
Or, excuse me, go over to your house
To install my digital copy of Mass Effect
Or whatever and wait for it to download 7 gigs
Before we play it
Because Xbox One will be able to play it right away
So that does kind of enhance it a little bit
Right?
Well, yeah, because it would have just been ridiculous
If you had to do that
As it is, I mean, I know
Hopefully they're going to treat the recovering profiles
A lot easier because
Now you have to download your profile
And it takes a while
And then you'd have to download the game
And all that stuff
It's just kind of ridiculous
Of course, I mean, they're going to try to market it
And how amazing this is
Of course they're going to do that
Because they want to make themselves look good
So, why not?
ActDeaf in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says
It's been a while since we've had a Loki rage that hard
And TigerClaw says
Loki ranting and shouting at the Microsoft employee
Probably would have been like that video of the lady
Shouting at an Apple store
I seriously thought about doing that
But just to prove myself right
It's not worth it
On someone like that that's randomly going through
And commenting on everybody's story
And I went and read through his stuff
And I'm like, nah, it's not even worth it
He's drank so much of the Microsoft Kool-Aid
That there's no getting through this guy
I'm not even going to waste my time
Do you really think the Xbox One is going to be that bad though?
Because I kind of think they've gone back
On everything they need to
The only thing that makes the Xbox One
At this point is the fact that it's $100 more
And has that required Kinect
But it's kind of one of those things where it's like
Inevitably, a year and a half after it launches
There will be some type of price drop
I will get an Xbox One eventually
I'm not saying that the Xbox One is bad
I'm just calling out bullshit marketing
That's all I'm calling out
If Sony did the exact same thing
If Sony came out and said
Hey, let's talk about how awesome
Cloud sharing is
This is a brand new feature that we're bringing to the PlayStation 4
It's never been done before
I'd call them out and be like, fuck you
This has been something that's been available already
Something like that
Nintendo started talking about something ridiculous
I find it fascinating that they would come out and say that
But it makes sense
Of course they're going to want to do that
And the game sharing thing
Yeah, it's cool
I can sign into my account and play the games I have bought
That's not really sharing
That's more like I'm going to a friend's house and watching a movie
That I brought with me or something
Any comment from Alan or Dark Soccer on this before we move on?
I like rants
Like I said in chat
If they create some sort of
Mobile mode or travel mode
For your account when you sign in
It makes the process faster
That'd be nice
But like Loki said, it's still the same shit we have now
I hate importing my profile
To a different Xbox
It takes like 10 minutes
And you have to do it again
When you come back home, you have to reimport your profile
That's awful
Going forward
This is probably going to tie in with Xbox One
Live accounts
Because you're connecting to their service
It's probably just going to exist in the cloud
You're just going to be signing in like you would sign in on a website
And you're never going to have to download that profile
Because it's all on the cloud
So that's
Probably going to improve
You're not going to have that
My 10 meg profile
For some reason
If I'm downloading any other 10 meg file
Anywhere
It would be like instantaneous
But oh no, for some reason
I'm operating at 24 4
Or 28 8 or whatever
Going back to the 90s
Let me bandwidth
In the interest of time, I'm going to move on
I want to talk a little bit about Nintendo
Because Nintendo put out one of their Nintendo Directs this week
Where they talked about
Clarified a few things going on for the rest of the year
For the record, I think those are a brilliant idea
They're working out really well
The great thing is they kind of come out of nowhere
People are already saying
Get ready, y'all
Apple is going to do something on September 10
God, that's so far away
So far away?
It's less than a month
That's still a long ways away
Compared to Nintendo
There's going to be a Nintendo Direct day after tomorrow
Get up early and watch it
I'm just saying
They had the Nintendo Direct
There's no real big bombshells
But just a few things
First off, Sonic Lost World will be coming out October 22
They were talking about some kind of functionality
Between 3DS and Wii U
That sounded interesting
Art Academy Sketchpad for Wii U
Some details there
Kind of looks like you'll be able to post your drawings
Into Miiverse
Which as Miiverse grows
Looks like some people are doing some crazy shit in there too
I think there's a version of it already
Downloadable
A little mini version of it
Luigi was confirmed
As a new Super Smash Brothers character
I was kind of like
Isn't that kind of a given?
I kind of already thought he was
Is he going to have crazy leg jumping?
Did he in the other ones?
I was thinking
They need to announce
Mecha Luigi or Demon Deaf Luigi
Where he's a super uber one
Or Waluigi
Waluigi's awesome
I have another Nintendo exclusive
The next Zelda game is going to have canon in it
Oh my god
Alright
Moving on
Some other things announced in the Nintendo Direct
Rayman Legends Wii U will have Mario and Luigi costumes
Now they're not going to actually be Mario and Luigi
But it's like Rayman wearing the red suspenders and all that
I still found it interesting
Despite all the drawings
I kind of think that's one of those games nowadays
For any Nintendo made
Game that's like oh we gotta have some reference to Mario in it
Gotta have it
Even I remember like was it Need for Speed
Most Wandered or something
It had cars based off of the Mario Kart cars or something
It's just
It's neat I guess
But when you do it in every single game
When there's an homage to Mario in every goddamn game
That's third party
What are we going to get in Assassin's Creed
Are we going to have a Mario hat in Assassin's Creed
Watch Dogs
Are you going to have a Mario hat in Watch Dogs
I mean come on
They showed us some more footage
From Wind Waker HD and A Link Between Worlds
And I am so here for A Link Between Worlds
That's like my most anticipated 3DS title right now
Pretty interesting
Little virtual console tidbit
A game they're going to put out on the 3DS eShop
Summer Carnival 92
Wrecka
Wrecka? Oh my god that game's awesome
It's so rare too
I might have done Wrecka
It's a neat game
For a NES game
And they actually acknowledge this shit is rare
And now everybody's going to be able to play it
So that was kind of neat
Some other things they announced for virtual console on 3DS
Donkey Kong, Wario Land 3
Super Mario Bros. 3
And Tecmo Bowl
In the Nintendo archive
I think a lot of that stuff is already on the Wii
Virtual console save maybe Wario Land 3
Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright
Ace Attorney that was confirmed for the US
A lot of people hoping that would get it localized
It will be in 2014
And then kind of their big thing they said at the end
Was that they were putting out a new
Application in the Wii U called
Animal Crossing Plaza
And I actually did download this and check it out
It's basically, it's another way of looking at
Miiverse basically
But it is kind of cute because you have all the little
Animals walking around the screen and you can
Click on an animal
And you can actually see Miiverse posts about that
Specific animal
Also it interfaces with
Your game card
So you can actually take the SD card out of your
3DS, put it in your Wii U
And get your screenshots again on Miiverse
Which, interesting
I don't know
It was a weird little last tease
But I kind of like that they're trying to push
The boundaries of Miiverse with some different things
But for me I'm going to be honest
It was one of those things I downloaded it once
But I was like, huh, neat
Then I turned it off and I probably won't ever run it again
But
For those that are really into sharing the creative
Stuff they've done in Animal Crossing it might be kind of cool
So those are some of the highlights
Of the Nintendo Direct
So please look forward to all those games
Coming out soon
Dark Sakura, before we get to release dates, what do you have for us?
Well we do have a demo
That's finally on the Wii U
Wii U eShop
Wii U Wii U eShop
It's been on the
American Wii U
eShop as well
Wonderful 101
Which I watched the trailer for
Last night
Actually this kind of makes me want
A Wii U again
Tank Tank Tank was kind of a tank
But
It's free now
This though, it was done by
Hideki Kiyama
Who did Beautiful Joe
It looks like the same feel
That Beautiful Joe had, which was a fun
Series of games
So I really
Really am excited about this one
It just looks really fun
And it had sort of that Sentai feel
To it, you know
I like Sentai
So I think this might be
The convincing factor
Even Dan was sort of like, ooh that looks cool
There are a lot of people pretty excited about this game
So I need to download the demo, I keep forgetting
I gotta screw that up
I would do that right now, but I need the bandwidth
For the show
Remind me to do that later
Have you seen anything about Wonderful 101?
A lot of people on my Twitter are really excited for it
Yeah, but we're friends with a lot of Nintendo fanboys
Bless their hearts
Bless their hearts, alright
To register participation
For this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio
At vognetwork.com
Use the passphrase, kidney
Let's move on to some release dates
Travel around the world and see what games are coming out
To a store near you very soon
The Angry Birds Trilogy
On Wii and Wii U this week
Because they didn't get them the last time around
Payday 2
On Playstation 3 and Xbox 360
Phineas and Ferb
Quest for Cool Stuff
Oh my god, Phineas and Ferb
Xbox 360, Wii, Wii U
3DS and DS
And one week from today
Disney Infinity
PlayStation 3, Xbox 360
Wii, Wii U
And 3DS as well
A whole fucking ton of characters
Any idea
What platform I should get it on
Because, you know
Like Alan said, we're Twitter friends
With a lot of Nintendo fanboys
So I'm kind of leaning towards Wii U for that reason
So I can play with them, but then I'm like
Oh god, but then I think about things like Injustice
Where the, you know, online was kind of out
Wii 360
I was thinking PlayStation 3
If you have a Wii U
Then the tablet acts as the ARFID chip reader
Does it though? Because I thought that
Wasn't being implemented until a patch later on
Although they are talking about the Pokemon Rumble
Because in Skylanders
No, it's not
But it's going to
It's going to happen for that
But it's definitely not going to happen for Infinity
Because there's too much shit that goes on that portal
There's like a bunch of things
No way that would happen
I know with Skylanders you need that little
Crystal thing
That you put the thing on
But if you have a Wii U
If you have a Wii U, just put the action figure
On your tablet and it's like, okay, I read it
You have this character now
It's one of those features, like the IR port on the 3DS
Or like the DS or whatever
That they're never going to fucking use
Except for that Pokemon game
But you could tap your credit card on it and use that
Don't kid yourself
That'll be a thing
When they announced the Pokemon Rumble
I was like, why didn't they announce
A new Pokemon Snap with amazing
AR
Tablet camera support
I kind of wish that my son was older
So that he would be appreciative of this stuff
I can get him a Mater
The problem is though, to get the
Cars playset, it's like 40 bucks
For the Cars playset
$13 for the Mater
And then Disney Infinity is another like
$75
No, I'm not spending $120
That's estimated
On this stuff
Just to have a playable Mater
Besides Saint's Row 4
That's all that's bad
Teaching to play Saint's Row
Hell yeah
Alright, well this is where I would usually do the
Japanese release dates, but guess what
There's nothing until August 22nd
Isn't it a holiday right now?
I think it is, so you have things on the 22nd
To look forward to, like Disorder 6
Dungeons and Dragons Mysteria
We talked about that before
But those are all on the 22nd
So I'll touch on them again next week, but for now
It's an empty week in Japan
I did want to mention, because I was talking about
Angry Birds this earlier, my son plays Angry Birds
Actually, he can kind of
Do it, he 3-starred a level the other day
Oh, good job
Wow, that's pretty cool
It's a little hard for him to do it on the phone
That's the only game he plays so far
But hey, I'll take anything
You gotta start somewhere
Alright, well since I don't have Japanese releases, how about the UK?
We have, coming out
We have DuckTales Remastered on the 13th
Which actually, I bought that for Dan
The day I got fired
Which I shouldn't have spent money on
But I thought I had a job
He came up and said
My girl loves me
She got me DuckTales
Aww, I'm gonna barf
How much he's gonna love you when you buy him Strider
I know, right?
Also coming out is
Europa Universalis 4
And then Payday 2
On PC
On the 14th, also
DuckTales Remastered for PS3
Alright, just a few more news stories
For you guys in the classic game of the week
And I was a little surprised with Dark Soccer's
Pick this week
Just because it's one of those games
Where you're like, oh yeah
You gotta do that at some point
I've come across
Quite a few that are like, you haven't done that yet?
Mandatory selection
Alright, Loki
Alright
Let's see
Kinda going back to some of the changes
That are gonna be happening with the
Xbox 360, Xbox Live, all that stuff
As previously mentioned
Before, they are getting
Rid of Microsoft Points
And are gonna be converting over to
Real currency
And this is supposed to be happening sometime in the 4th quarter
October-ish
Well, it's actually gonna take place at the end of
August, they're gonna convert your
Funds over to real money
But they're gonna release new cards I believe in October
And they're gonna come in different
Nominations of
50 bucks, 25 dollars
30 dollars, which is actually 3
10 dollar cards, and 15 dollars
So those are gonna be available
Around October-ish
And your
Microsoft Point cards will still work
Until they say they won't
And the only little
Bit of small fine print that you have
About the points that you have on your
Account, they must be spent by
June of 2015
So they are giving you 2 years
Instead of 1 year now, but I mean honestly
You shouldn't really have that much money sitting on your account
It means I have to use the
Card I got for my birthday
Well, not necessarily
I mean you can, you just don't
Yeah, you have 2 years
I mean come on, you should be able to spend
It in that time
You got enough time
My digital copy of Grand Theft Auto 5
Buy more rock band songs, you know that's what she's gonna do
I got the email blast about this
From Microsoft, and the way the email
Made it sound like it was happening
Now, it just said
With an upcoming Xbox
System update
This will take effect, it didn't actually have any dates in it
Well the system update from what I'm gathering
Because they like to do every single system update
Because they do a new band wave
Before a major game release
So the next system update I'm betting is gonna be right before
Grand Theft Auto 5
And that would be the beginning of September
And that's when they've mentioned they're gonna convert
Everything over, so it would make sense
And they're doing a beta right now for it
So it's probably very soon
Yeah, probably end of August
Alright
Well I don't know how many of y'all are fans of the
EverQuest series, but there was quite a bit of news
About EverQuest coming out this week
Some expansions for
EverQuest and EverQuest 2
EverQuest getting a new expansion called
Call of the Forsaken
Guess what number expansion it is for the EverQuest game
Guess what number?
One, 37 in a row
Close, it is the
20th expansion for EverQuest
Can you imagine? How many has World of Warcraft had?
4? 5?
5. 5. Is it?
Yeah, 5. So hopefully a 6
Burning Crusade
Wrath of the Lich King
Cataclysm, Pandaria is a 4
Woah, Pandas. It's a 4
Because Vanilla doesn't count as a suspension
But we all know a 5th is coming
You know, at Blizzcon this year
How many people have they lost now?
It's going down
They were 7.7 as of the last courthouse
Yeah, we'll see
But 7.7 is still way more than any other MMO
So we'll see
Well, I don't know
We could get into a longer discussion on this
About how League of Legends has a heck of a lot of people playing that
But it's not really measured the same way
But anyway, that's another discussion
Back to EverQuest, Call of the Forsaken
Is the 20th expansion
Where you will face off against the Dragon Lady
Lendenaria
And return peace to the world of Norrath
As the way these things go
Two shared bank slots
A new heroic adventure system
New gear, new raids
EverQuest 2 is getting its 10th expansion
Tears of Vashon
A new channeler class coming in with that
I think one thing that caught a lot of people's attention
However, is the news on EverQuest Next
EverQuest Next
Was shown just a little tidbits
And a website up
But EverQuest Next will have destructible environments
And it's not like a total sandbox
Like playground
There will be restrictions on what you can
And what you can't destroy
But what I thought about this
There's this whole other kind of section to it
Where people will be able to build their own stuff
And maybe sell it
Like a little transaction place
And EverQuest Next is going to be a free thing
I felt like a little bit of Minecraft inspiration here
And a lot of the screenshots look really good
And I was like, okay
Being able to craft in-game and then sell it
Depending on whether it has a real money aspect
Or what
That's very Second Life
Landmark is the name of what I was thinking of
You can construct a structure on a plot of land
That you claim in the world
And then you can sell it in the Player Studios marketplace
For use in EverQuest Next
So
That's very Second Life
Who's going to build the gigantic penis first?
I guess
I'm assuming these things have to be screened
Oh Rob, not everybody's into penis
Okay
Then boobies
Anyhow, also
It should be mentioned that there's also
An iOS and Android app
Happening called EverQuest Worlds
Quests and minigames that will
Tie into lore content and rewards
In the EverQuest franchise
That app is free and available now
If you're an EverQuest fan, there's a lot going on
Right now
Pretty cool
Teto13811 in our chat says
EverQuest meets Minecraft
Which is kind of cool
I like the idea of that
Let's see
Trying to see if anybody else is talking about it
At
Live.vognetwork.com
I see some comments on the Microsoft point card thing
Tigerclaw says
What's going to happen, I think, is Microsoft will replace
Those points card with the ones similar to PlayStation Network
Where you can buy a $20 or $50 card
Yeah, I think that's pretty much exactly what's happening
Yeah
That comment might have come in before you read that
Alright, anyhow
That does it for the news
For part A
But we can't wrap this up
Until we take a trip down memory lane
It's a segment we call the classic game of the week
Where Dark Sakura is going to step into the gaming vault
And find a game that she thinks, hey
Listen
And play this game
I see what you did there
Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week
Classic game of the week is Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time
I told you guys, right?
Like, I mean, she has to do it eventually, right?
That's a really obscure deep cut, Dark Sakura
Right
Okay, then we'll do Panorama Cotton again
Jeez, Rammoral Dragon
You can't do the same game twice
Even though you totally did it once
You know what, Rob, you know what, you know what, you know what
What?
So, I had to pick this music to start off with
Anyway, the Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time
Also known in Japan as
Zeru no Densetsu Toki no Ocarina
Is, um
The Nintendo 64 Zelda option
The very first one that came out
It came out in Japan on November 21st, 1998
And North America November 23rd
And in Europe December 11th, same year
It was originally developed for the
Nintendo 64 Double D
And it came out in Japan on November 21st, 1998
And North America November 23rd
And in Europe December 11th, same year
Originally developed for the Nintendo 64 Double D
But instead came out on
Excuse me
But instead came out for
The, uh
Nintendo 64
So, um
You play as Link, you go through Hyrule
You have a, you know, completely open world
I mean, for as small as it was
It was an open world
And you had to do several different things
You time traveled, you had to solve different puzzles
It's a Zelda game
But it was the first of its type
I really think
It was, it had a really good story
It was really in depth
It had some very weird stuff going on in it
But it didn't have that stupid moon
And it didn't have Tingle
So, it was a lot better than Majora's Mask
Rude
I know
Also, um, the Guinness Book of World Records
Said that Ocarina of Time was the highest rated
Game ever reviewed
And, uh
Also for 2008 and 2010
So, it gets a lot of love
Um, there was also, um
Some re-releases
One of them was the Ocarina of Time Master Quest
That had, uh
The dungeons redone with new puzzles
And then the collector's edition
Which was a port for, uh
GameCube, which
We have that
I've actually got the gold cartridge for
Nintendo 64, which has some fun glitches
In it
You can do some, uh
Different fun stuff
So, anyway, um, like I said
Roleplay game, uh, had different elements
Has a Z-targeting
That, uh, basically lets you
Lock onto another item
So that you can focus on it
And kill it easier
That game did give me some different perspective issues
But, you know, you also do
Quest for the NPC, so it has a slightly
MMO quality to it
Um, you know, just that RPG element
And so, basically, you have to get the Master Sword
Kill Ganon, save Zelda
The end, which is typical
Uh
Basically with this game
It had, like I said
Some various ports, re-releases
It was re-released, um
On the GameCube as an emulated ROM
And it also had that, uh
Master Quest with it
And it was part of the Legend of Zelda Collector's Edition
Um
It also, uh
The Japanese version was called
Toki no Ocarina GC Ura
Um
Let's see
It also, uh, we had other, uh, versions
That came out with, uh
A GBA re-release of A Link to the Past
You could buy it on Virtual Console
Basically, it was available
Bless you
Um
It was available, you know, for a while
Now, like I said, there was a 64 double D version
That was planned
Not as Zelda, but, um
It was supposed to expand the game outside of the cartridge limits
And that's where that Master Quest came from
Which is why the Japanese version
Was called Ura
Uh, we have the game on the 3DS
Which is
The game
And, uh
They probably have a
Well, like it's saying here, they've actually fixed up
Quite a few things that were wrong with it
Um, the audio was, of course, done by Koji Kondo
Rob's playing my favorite music in the game right now
The, uh
Get it out of the valley
I have a special love of, uh
Classical guitar
Um, so anyway, yeah
The game is like one of the
Most loved Nintendo games of all time
It's definitely, I would say
Probably one of the best that ever came out
On the Nintendo 64
So we're just looking at an instant classic
When it came out, especially given
How pretty it was when it came out
And, now this is something that's
Actually important to me
And I even remember this, because this was actually
The first time I heard of Philip Glass
They compared a lot of Koji Kondo's music
In this to Philip Glass
And, basically
Um
This composer came into
Discussion recently
In, uh, helping people with
Autistic meltdowns overcome them
By listening to minimalist music
And I, it made me think
That back, you know, when I was, you know
Playing through this game, if ever I found
Myself in, uh
A situation where I felt
Overwhelmed, I'd go listen to Zelda music
And calm down, the same way I listened to Philip Glass
And calm down, so I thought it was very
Interesting that that stylistic
Uh, comparison was drawn between the music
And that I react to both of them in the same way
So it was pretty cool
This was the game that made me
Go out and buy an N64
Unpopular opinion time, but I
Played Mario 64 for about 30 minutes
And I'm like, this is confusing and weird, I don't like it
This is muddy as shit
I was at, I was the age
Where being a fanboy came to you very easily
I was what, what year was this?
97?
Yeah, I've been like 18 or 19, yeah
Yeah, or 19 or 20, so yeah, being a fanboy came
Very naturally to me, um, but for this
I was like, okay, this 3D is amazing
And I bought Ocarina of Time
With an N64, bought them both, took them up
Up to the counter at Electronics Boutique
And, um, I bought other N64 games
Like Ogre Battle 64
Paper Mario, never played them
Bought them, never played them, I played Ocarina
Beat it, never touched my N64 again
See, my Rabid fanboy thing
Which, you know, to some extent
Still kind of holds to this day, is
I really resented the transition to 3D
And I just always preferred A Link to the Past
And I think I still do to this day
I just, you know, and I understand why this game has this
I don't think this is a bad game
So get off my back
It's not my thing
I had a really hard time adjusting to the 3D
Just like with me, you know, my unpopular opinion
I guess, is that
I liked Wind Waker better than
Ocarina of Time
The visuals just
Turned me off so much from the game
That maybe I just didn't give it a chance
But I just don't care
I mean, I liked Wind Waker
I really honestly wish it carried on with that kind of visual style
Because imagine recreating
A Link to the Past in that style
Where it's full 3D
That'd be fucking amazing
And at one point, spoiler, in Wind Waker
You kind of see what that might have been like
And I was just like
Why don't they do that?
Why didn't they do something like that?
I would be cool to see them do like
A remake of Ocarina of Time
Like HD, you know
Actually, not just up res everything
But recreate the game
Redo all the 3D visuals
What if they did it in the style of Twilight Princess?
See, I didn't really play Twilight Princess
I bought it, and I didn't really
Twilight Princess was finally when I came around to accept the 3D Zelda
Twilight Princess was great
There's a part in this game, Ocarina of Time
That did make me a little emotional too at that age
I was very sad
The green girl, the little forest girl
Who has a crush on Link
Sorry, yeah
When you are older and you have to find the seven sages
That are going to banish Ganon
She's one of them, and there's this scene where now
She has to go off and she's never going to see Link again
And he's older and she's the same age
And you can kind of tell that she has a thing for him
I just was very like
I teared up at that
She was a very sad character for me
But how many of us that played the game
Screamed at the owl when you accidentally made him start over?
Yeah, yeah
Spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam
Did you hear what I said? No
You're like, exit, exit, exit
Shit
So yeah, Saria, that was it
I knew it was something like that
So yeah, Ocarina of Time
It was a great game
I think some people underappreciated it
But it was the one
That bridged the gap from
The old era to the new
And for me
There was just so much stuff in it
I loved the Gerudo
I loved going around
And the one level that I really hated doing though
Was the cave
That was all spirally
That was kind of a pain in the butt
There was also the water dungeon or the ice dungeon
And Zelda is notorious for having ice dungeons
Where you're like, fuck
The water dungeon was actually really fun to me
But it was also probably one of the only levels in that game
That made me actually sick
So yeah, Ocarina of Time
Alright
And I'll even say that to this day
The best way I like to play it
Is busting out the 64
Popping in that gold cartridge
I'm getting my link on
Alright
There it is folks, your classic game of the week
Legend of Zelda
The Ocarina of Time
One of the true true classes
Considered by some to be the greatest game of all time
So there you go
The Guinness Book of World Records said something about it
Alright
We got plenty more Orange Launch Radio to come
After a quick break
We're going to do some rapid fire news of course
We're going to talk about some of the game recording stuff
For Xbox One and PlayStation 4
Little clarifications coming out on that this week
And Nintendo fighting piracy
Yet again we'll talk more about that
And some rumors about the PlayStation Vita
That's right, the Vita, it's not gone
So we got news on all of that
When we come back after a quick break with more
Of Orange Lounge Radio
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio
Episode number 515
Already in progress
Tonight is August 11th of 2013
And having a pretty busy show here
Back after a week off of course
We weren't here last week unfortunately
But getting back in full swing
Talking about games such as Hotline Miami
Which the live listeners heard a couple tracks from the
Soundtrack
I like that, I hadn't heard any of the music yet
I like the second song a lot more than the first
But that was really good
I like that
Good choice Alan
Alright
Before we get into some rapid fire news
I just kind of wanted to plug a couple appearances
On other podcasts because I've kind of been on a roll lately
I don't know what it's about but
I will take it because I love
Guesting on other shows and supporting
Independent broadcasting and podcasting
In general so I just wanted to throw out a couple
Plugs
One of them is a new project for our friends over
At popcolts.com
You remember Tiara
And you might know Dan Shadow, I think they've both been on the show
At one point or another and some other friends
All did this thing called Order of the Chocobo
Which was a Google hangout, it was actually a video thing
That was fun, we had to make
A list, it was kind of like listless
But not really, making the definitive
List of the top 10 Final Fantasy
Characters
I was very humbled by what a civil discussion it was
I was expecting hair pulling
And chair throwing and I was very happy
With the way the list turned out so check that out
Popcolts.com has the archive of that available
Also just today
I taped a spot for a podcast
Called Game On
Epic Slam Press Edition and that's a part of
MMORPG.com
Real quick show, it's only about 30-45 minutes
But they were kind enough to have me on today
Good guys over there so I believe
That will be up on Monday so check that out
I get to talk a bit about Final Fantasy 14
And you guys all know I have the other show Horde House
So I got to speak a little bit about some MMOs
They were talking about Rift and some of the other changes
Going on at Triumph so that was pretty exciting
I guess I should give another
Plug because I don't know if I remembered it to mention it
Two weeks ago but on the last
Gamebuoy.org show
Which was about music games
I was on that show and that's up on their feed now
And it might be getting
Bumped by the time you hear this by their
Most recent show they did today
Which I think they did about GamerX
But look for the show on their feed about music games
We had a great time, it was like a three hour show
So it would have been a great way to fill
The time last week with no OLR
So check that out
I'm having fun guessing on other podcasts
I'm always happy to guest on other shows
I know Loki and Dark Sakura also willing as well
Be sure to hit us all up on Twitter
If you want to know our individual Twitter accounts
Best way to get ahold of me on Twitter
Twitter.com slash S-K-I-E
That's Skye but S-K-I-E
Dark Sakura?
Like I check Twitter
It's Dark Sakura
It's the best way to get ahold of me
I'm always happy to guest on other shows
I'm always happy to guest on other shows
Dark Sakura
It's the best way to get ahold of me
D-A-R-K-S-A-K-U-R-A
Or you can message me through Tumblr
I was going to say the tumbles
I tumble a lot more
It's Kurotsubasa
K-U-R-O-U-T-S-U-B-A-S-A
Just think Blackwing
If you message me on
The Twitter I will eventually see it
And Loki, I don't know what's the best way
For them to get you, Twitter?
Twitter is fine
K-U-R-O-U-T-S-U-B-A-S-A
Twitter is fine
Alright, well let's get into some
Rapid fire news and talk about what else
Is going on in the gaming world this week
Loki, why don't you start us off
This isn't the first time games tried something like this
Where they put up a really expensive
Ridiculous bundle for
An upcoming game, I think they did something like that
For Formula One
I think it was Formula One 2012
Where they actually had a Formula One
Car as part of the bundle
But this is the Saints Row IV
The super dangerous
WOD WOD edition
AKA the million dollar pack
It is exactly one million dollars
There is only one available
And it includes the following
Saints Row IV, the Commander in Chief edition
A Virgin Galactic space flight
A full size replica of the dubstep gun
A hostage rescue experience
Plastic surgery
Spy training day
A personal shopper
A capsule wardrobe
From all the Saints Row stuff
Seven nights at the top
Royale suite
In Dubai
And a partridge in a pear tree
A week for two at the Jefferson Hotel
In Washington D.C.
A first class flight to Washington D.C.
In Dubai
Lamborghini
A new Toyota Prius Plus
A year's insurance
And a year's supercar membership
One million dollars
Which apparently is not a very good deal
But my thing is though
It's one million dollars
And they couldn't even bother to
Throw in the season pass DLC
I mean really
This reminds me of how
Like in WoW there are players with
Phenomenal amounts of money
That they didn't buy from a gold farmer
That they just have in every expansion
Blizzard has to put in some mount
Or some treasure thing that costs like
Gold for like the alchemy mount
You have too much gold
Make this thing
That's what this is but in real life
You have too much money
Here's a money sink for you
Just reminded me of what I should have done
In WoW before I left
That was by the Time Dragon thing
I think this is one of those stupid things
That generates blog headlines
Across the internet and oh look
It worked
Whatever
You know what if I had a million dollars
You know what I would do
I would just buy the Bugatti and leave it alone
Honestly though it's not really worth it
I think they've had a few sites that have actually
Broken down cost wise
And it ends up being about $600,000 worth of product
So you're kind of overspending
But if you have a million dollars to drop on a game
Then you probably don't give a shit about money
And you know
Bill Gates I'm looking at you come on you're a
Real fan right? Honestly if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a house
And pay my bills
But if you had so much money
Like millions of dollars
This is for the 1%
If I magically became the 1%
I think my brain would explode
I would know what to do
If you're so rich you have no idea how much money
Exactly you have because the stock market
Fluctuates so much each day then this is for you
When you're so rich you don't know how much money you have
If I had a million dollars I'd invest
And make a million more
Just saying
If I had just one million dollars I'm not going to buy
A fucking game with it I mean that's stupid
If I had lots and lots of money
Like billions of dollars
Then yes I would drop a million dollars on a fucking game
Because no one thought that they would purchase it
And I'd be like ha I fucking purchased it
Next story
So this is kind of cool news
For the Oculus Rift
They're actually
They have a new
Chief Technical Officer
And that's coming from
John Carmack
The co-founder of id
Of course big fan of VR
And now
Going to be a part of the team to make the Oculus Rift
Awesome
So neat
We'll have to see what that comes
What's going to come out of that
And then last but not least
The thing that's been kind of taking up a few days
Of my time at least not entirely
It's this website called Salty Bet
It's really
I don't know it's kind of funny
It's basically a website
That you go and you sign up
And you get fake money
You bet on PC
Controlled Mugen fights
And for those that don't know what Mugen is
It is a basically create your own
Fighting game type thing
And so there's characters from Street Fighter
From all the different fighting series
You can possibly imagine and a bunch of other made up stuff
So you get like
For example in this screenshot here
It's the same battle between Popeye and Ash
From the Evil Dead versus
Duck Dodgers
And Spawn
Just like weird shit like that
If it's a character that had a sprite made of it
During the Genesis slash SNES
Era then that sprite has probably been
Imported into Mugen and made a character
I watched a fight that took place versus
A Dragon Ball Z character and
Fat Albert
Hey hey hey
I watched one earlier today
Popeye versus some other random
Street Fighter character and Pop
Not Popeye, Ronald McDonald
Versus some random Street Fighter character
Piccolo
And Ronald McDonald just kicked the shit out of
Piccolo
Because he's such an overpowered character that
Someone created because they're like
Ronald McDonald is a fighting character
But yeah it's kind of fun
Saltybet.com
You sign up you get 400 fake dollars
And then you go and you bet
I want to watch a Daisy
Fight for that hidden eye
Eye beam attack that Mugen
Daisy has
From Mario Kart
I'd have to
I'd have to see that but yeah it's funny
And they've got like it's just this
Twitch stream that they have and
You bet stuff and you can even they have a
Chat window and stuff on there you can
Check stuff out but like there's like people with a ton
Of money like I'm like how many fucking hours are you
Spending on this thing? It's ridiculous
And I always bet on the losers
Apparently because it's like
How do you pick you know who's gonna win
Between like some
Random anime chick and this
This weird screen cap of a
Football or you know a soccer player
Or something like that it's conversations you had
When you were 10 I bet
That Superman would lose a fight against that one
Battletoad like I mean that's what
Mugen is basically once I tried
To like find Mugen and install it
And get some character packs I couldn't figure
Out where the hell this thing is like it's buried
On some Japanese forum somewhere I just
Tried to Google download Mugen play
Mugen for example I'm gonna tell you something
I have a disc from 7 years ago
A CD from 7 years ago that has an
Install of Mugen on it I don't know who these
Characters I mean I know who one of these characters
Is but I don't know who both these characters is but right now
Are you salty betting during the show?
No right now they have it's it's Fox
McCloud versus Hawkage I guess
He's from looks like Naruto
Um so
Hakage?
Hakage I guess yes I can't I can't
Fucking read Japanese today
Hakage so it's Fox McCloud versus
Hakage and Fox McCloud yes Fox McCloud
Is definitely favored
To win so but uh yeah
Just an example of some of the matchups you see
Right there I don't know I had it on the other
Day while I was doing other things and they thought
It was funny all right let's move
On now earlier in the show
I was yelled out
Yelled at in private message by
My good pal Shane Alinko
When I said that I was most
Looking forward to on the 3DS the
Link Between Two Worlds
Zelda remake because he said how dare you
Pokemon X and Y still isn't out
So fine here you go Shane
Here's a Pokemon X and Y story
For me to butcher and it's
About something you were expressing to me earlier this week
Mega Evolutions
That's right the Pokemon company
Unveiled more information
On Mega Evolutions
Such as Mewtwo
Can undergo this change during battle
But the effects would only last for the duration of the battle
In order for this to happen
Pokemon has to hold a mega stone
Item but there are
Different ones unique to different creatures
In order to get these abilities
There were also new screens and there was a new
Trailer that was released for this
That talks about how to use this
What is this super training is also
A thing where you can increase a Pokemon's
Base stats by playing mini games
Such as a soccer style game
And core training workouts as well
That will allow your Pokemon to slowly improve
Their stats on their own
I want to hear more about the fashion shoots and all that
Kind of crap that they're going to have in the game
And when this story was announced all of the
Pokemon theory crafters and min-maxers
Simultaneously got a boner and an aneurysm
Act Deaf
Says Digimon will sue
Pokemon min-maxers
Are crazy
It's one of the reasons I can't
Get into Pokemon as much as some
People like Shane is that there's
There's too fucking much
Like it's just like oh my god
It's like I gotta do this and then I gotta get these
Items and I gotta min-max this and I gotta do
A fucking fashion shoot on the side like
God damn
You know what? I was fine with
151 Pokemon
I was fine with taking their pictures in Snap
Yeah that was fun
The rest of this shit is too much
You know okay I did get some free plushies
At E3 which I gave to Julie
But you know what?
Shane does have a career
The new bunny Pokemon is super cute by the way
He's super derpy and I love it
I wanna see the derpiness
Although I do like when people do
Memes with the old
That looks like a derp
Isn't he adorable though?
What is up with those ears?
He's kind of like the
What's the one they have all the memes about?
Psyduck?
The beaver
The beaver looking one
Bidoof
Squirtle help I'm on fire
LOL Bidoof
Squirtle I'm dying
I haven't seen this
Alright
I just like the Diglett memes
Far too much Pokemon content for one show
Shut it down
Hearthstone is Blizzard's free to play
Card game
It's gonna be in beta soon
And they're saying it's not really
But it's not far away either
I'm not sure what the hell that's supposed to mean
But they're saying here's the quote about it
We're not days away from launching
The beta but we're not months away
Either
At the Hearthstone announcement we committed into going to beta testing
Before the summer was over
And the team has been pulling out all the stops to make that happen
Well if you think about it summer isn't really over
Until September 21st
So there's still a little bit of time
But one can hope it will be there
Before the end of August
For Saints Row 4
Even I'm excited about this game honestly
I gotta get it at some point
The soundtrack list has been revealed
109 tracks in this game
Good lord
I am not gonna read all 109 songs
Off of this list
But I will just point out
Especially because there's a lot of classical songs
Since they have the classical station
But I will point out I was very excited to see
Hadaway What Is Love is in the game
And apparently it's one of those songs that's used at a key moment
Opposites Attract
Do the safety dance
Montel Jordan
This is how we do it
I just laughed because Oh Shit is in it
Lump by Pussa
Oh Shit is in it
Obviously the mix station is gonna be the best
Saints Row 4 soundtrack
More information there
DarkSakura
What do you got?
Well I have some stuff
First of all there is a Tomb Raider
Sequel that has been confirmed
By the Square CEO
Well at least the American slash
European Phil Rogers
CEO
Basically they're also gonna be doing
A comic book that
Is a bridge between the games
And I knew about this because Gail Simone
Actually said something about it and you know I follow her Tumblr
She
Sorta let that slip early
So I'm looking forward to that
Cause I have liked what I've played so far
With Tomb Raider I just need to play more of it
Or as we call it here at OLR
Girl
Lara Croft's
Incredible no good
Very bad day
Whatever that book was called
And then there is a fan
Petition out for Smash Brothers
And they want to make
Reggie Fils-Aime a playable character
Yep you can sign
The Nintendo and that he
Uses Nintendo controllers and characters
To his advantage as attacks
And
They are basically
Encouraging Twitter users to
Basically message Masahiro Sakurai
To
Have Reggie in the game
I think that would be awesome
He has to have
You remember Norimaro in
Marvel Super Heroes
He was the Japanese
He was only the Japanese version
The comedian who was wearing the boys uniform
He could do a version like that for Reggie
With the big head that's like super
Exaggerated features and everything
His jaw should be an attack
I kind of agree with Fifth Dream in our chat room
At live.vognetwork.com
LOL fan petition
Yeah but it would be funny
And weirder things have happened
By the way Tekken X Street Fighter
Is still in development
They haven't given up and it should be
Better than Street Fighter X Tekken
Was
I hate this way
These stupid
Well let me say this from Stan in our chat room
Because I like this comment too
I thought Stan Lee would have been cool in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3
Yes
Yes
So they're looking though
With this to build a bigger community
For the fighting game fans
By combining not just putting the Tekken fans
And the Street Fighter fans together
But really making it one big whole community
So we'll see
If it's better than the Capcom attempt
Then I'll be happy
Ta-da
Alright there it is your rapid fire news
Let's get to the foogle question of the week
Every week we ask a question of our Facebook
And Google Plus communities
But this week was a little different
Because unfortunately due to some of the other podcasts
I was doing and being sick
And having to get Jamie tonight
Because she's without a car
My battery died
I was not able to prep the show in a timely manner
So I was like alright well we're not going to have enough time
To get decent replies tonight
So let's mix it up a little bit
And do a segment instead
That we have not done on Orange Lounge Radio
In a very very long time
It's a segment we call
Ask Orange Lounge
God
Let's ask Orange Lounge
Some stupid question
What will we find out this week
On Orange Lounge Radio
I bet a lot of people
Didn't know I usually sing the theme
And now they're happy that we don't do this segment
A lot anymore
Made up every time
Can you believe it? I'm a regular Wayne Brady over here
Alright let's start with
Facebook
Red the Haze starts us off tonight
What is a man?
A miserable little pile of secrets
Weren't you paying attention?
Yes
Rob himself says
Why is there no Loki and Dan show?
That would be epic
Why isn't there a Loki and Dan show?
You guys should just look at each other and yell for an hour
It'll be fun
I would leave the house
You wouldn't see me while the whole thing was going on
We wouldn't yell at each other we'd probably agree a lot
Actually yell in unison
It would be the two dudes up in the balcony from the Muppet show
That would be awesome
That would be awesome
You need to channel that
I'm going to make the suggestion to Dan then
That you do the Grumpy Guy show
Alright, Jose Osumu-Rigaro wants to know
What's the one game you thought you wouldn't enjoy
But you ended up loving
I only asked because I thought I wasn't going to enjoy
Hitman Absolution nearly as much as I am
The one game you thought you wouldn't enjoy
But you ended up loving
Easy for me, Mass Effect
I'd have to say
That was one for me too
And Borderlands 2 actually
I like it
Alan, anything you can think of?
I'm blanking, I'm sorry
That's alright, Loki, anything?
Minecraft
Ronnie B says if you could design your own game for the Oculus Rift
What would it be like?
It would be like F-Zero
If I had to do one
It would be
It would be
I don't know
I was going to try to think of something really pervy
to say
It would be like Superhero Dress Up
There's plenty of perv content already on Oculus Rift
Anybody else? Alan?
A game like Rez
What was that Fireworks game that was a launch game for the PS2?
Phantom Vision
Something like that
Phantom Vision is a fun game
Pretty rave
Drug induced game on the Oculus Rift
Ragenator says
Train A is traveling south
from Butte, Montana at 78 miles an hour
Train B is traveling east to Pax East
with Cliffy B as a passenger
How much bacon can Loki eat in one sitting
without getting explosive bacon grease diarrhea?
That's disgusting
He's not doing that in our apartment
I don't
get explosive diarrhea from bacon
It just ends up getting so heavy
It depends on how hungry I am
And how crispy the bacon is
That is what it comes down to
How crispy the bacon is
If it's all fatty and greasy
You can't eat very much of it
If it's really crispy then you can eat a ton of it
If it's not very crispy that means it's well lubricated
You guys are disgusting
We didn't ask the question
That's true
It's Ragenator's fault
Ragenator you're banned
Get something to slap him with in the chat room
I apologize for the Facebook noises
I still haven't disabled it
Bobby Blackwolf
Asking the heavy hitting question here
With all of the heavy topics
That are discussed on OLR throughout the years
There are many questions that one could ask
The Lounge of Orange
Some are philosophical, some are personal
Others are about the best ways to roast a ferret
However there is one question
And one question only
That dictates the future of gaming
And the revelry of gaming's past
Why the beep can you not accept
That Chrono Trigger and Earthbound are better
Than Super Metroid
Because you're wrong
What is actually a rhetorical question
Because the only acceptable answer is
You speak the truth Bobby
And now I accept your conclusion as fact
It has been written on the internet
And lo it is true
Well
First of all it's pronounced gif
Second of all no
I've actually prepared an answer
Oh really
For this
So here's my answer
Drum roll please
One more please
Because fuck you
That's why
Thank you and good night
Do do do do do do do
No I just
Okay look
There's something about the fact
That Super Metroid is something that you can
Play in like you know one sitting
And really kind of do like the speed runs
And collect all the items
I love the music in Super Metroid
And I don't know
How to put my finger on it
I just fucking love that game
And really they don't make Metroid games like it anymore
It's just
But they do make Castlevania games like it
They do they do
And I don't hate Chrono Trigger
And I especially don't hate Earthbound
In fact I got Earthbound on Wii U Virtual Console
And it's fun
You know what I found the other day?
Earthbound the cartridge
Dan and I were actually playing through Super Mario World
I asked the other game I forgot to say it was playing
Was to cheer me up Dan and I
Drank wine and played Super Mario World
Alright three hour show and look how many questions I gotta get through
Alright
Tim Tripp wants to know why not Zoidberg?
What?
Why not Zoidberg? You're laughing over there Logan
Is that Futurama?
Because he sheds his skin
And he's gross
That show got cancelled anyway
Didn't it?
It got cancelled again
Stan H wants to know if you were in a Final Fantasy game
What would be your job class?
I want to do a summoner because I want to summon
Cute little creatures to do my bidding
I'd be Realm
Where I would draw everything that I want into existence
And have them beat the shit out of everybody
Here's a horde of cute ponies
Stop
Alan?
I'd be Sebastian because he was super hot and built
I liked, I don't remember what the class was
In Final Fantasy 6
It was Edgar, I think he was like an engineer
Or something like that, because he had a fucking chainsaw
And that's awesome
And he had a railgun
Jeremy, our buddy from Koopa Club wants to know
Do you even lift?
No
How much can you bench DarkSakura?
Who's raising her hand?
I actually don't bench, I do deadlifts
And I'm up to 60 pounds now
Wow
That doesn't mean anything
It's 2013
Well I mean, but for the most part
For any
For people who don't know, I actually
Am working into powerlifting because I can't do heavy
Cardio because of bad joints
God damn it, Codeman, stop setting off my Facebook
But I actually
Do deadlifts and
I'm going to be starting bench pressing and doing
Other powerlifting, so that was a good question
I do live lifts
Like 30 pounds, or 35 pounds
Of live person that I lift up
On a daily basis
I'm going to lift this question and throw it out of the show
Alright, Renee
Also from Koopa Club wants to know
What's your favorite crepe?
Oh my god, those crepes at the
Cute little place in Japantown
There's this picture of me on Twitter
With a spike from Game Buoy
And look at the crepes
Zoom in on the crepes in that picture because they're adorable
They're crepes that are so cute you almost feel bad
For wanting to eat it, but you eat it anyway
I will say though, as far as savory crepes go
There's a place here in Sacramento
Called Crepeville
They have this curry crepe that's really good
Danielle's crepes
In Sacramento, I was pointing out to you on the way here
Very, very good
Chicken crepes
Degenerate Johnny says, since Rob often asks
This question to every guest on OLR
I'd like to know your answers to the question
What is your favorite game of all time?
Note, if you can't immediately name one game
The closest thing would be your favorite game
As addressed earlier in this segment
Super Metroid
Guardian Legend
Valkyrie Profile
Grand Theft Auto V
Did you see the
How to basic video for how to install
Grand Theft Auto V?
Then I watched all of his
In fact, we were watching it at lunch
I was showing my son
Those videos and he's like
What's he doing?
Alright
Fifth Dream says
For each member of the cast, if you could listen
To only one album
For the rest of your lives
What would you pick?
Ooh, this is hard
One album for the rest of your lives
What would you pick?
Anyone?
Okay, Loki? Well, just because I was listening to it
For about a couple months already
So, Onomatoguchi
Endless Fantasy
Okay
I'm not sure
I think I know how I want to answer this
But I'm not sure
Okay, it would be between
I can't narrow it down to one
It would be between Tragic Kingdom by No Doubt
Or
LCD Sound Systems
Actually, I think it's going to be
LCD Sound Systems' second album, Sound of Silver
That would be my album
Either it would be
Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill
Or Echo Image's CompuPhonic
No, ABBA?
ABBA Gold? ABBA Gold, I know
I know, but it's only one album
Only one
For me, I'd probably have to say Pearl Jam's 10
Because honestly, that is one of the few albums
I can listen to all the way through
Or maybe
God, what was that? Beatles album
Because now I can see it in my head
And I know the name of it
Revolver, Rubber Soul
Thank you
I knew it was one of the R ones
But I used to own
Actually, I do, again, own a copy of Rubber Soul
And it's my favorite Beatles album to this day
Those were the transitional albums where they went from
doing bubblegum pop to the really weird
metaphorical stuff
Rubber Soul and Revolver
both were such good albums
Now we have people in the chat room
giving their answers
I like Teto's answer, Throwing Copper
Metallica's Black Album was really good
Fifth Dream, The Cure with Wish
Ooh, another good one
You know what I would pick for an album?
My iTunes library
Depends how long I've been alive
I mean, if we're talking like, you know, I've been alive
for hundreds of years and probably Christmas speed
so I'd kill myself
Alright
Let's move on. Gamergirl says
If Animal Crossing New Leaf really
existed, what animal would you
be and why?
I wanna go last
I'd be human. Because I'm the main character
And I'm the fucking mayor
So fuck all of your
animals. I am not gonna be
a nice dog
like, um, what's his face in my
town. I'm gonna hit Ed
over the face with a bug net
kick that bitch out of my town
and run it for money
Alan, you be the gay unicorn
I'd be a
gazelle
Loki
Poacher
Which one's poacher?
A poacher
as in a hunter that kills the animals
No
Uh, and my answer is
I would be Tom Nook. Now give me my money
Fuck no, I have a gun
Alright
I'm glad none of us said
Sahara
Because Sahara really likes carpet
Is that the one
Is that the one that's like a boy in the
Japanese version? Gracie
I would be Gracie, let's be real
Sahara is the, uh, the wallpaper
and carpet merchant who comes
and redoes your house with the most god awful
ugly shit ever that you pay three thousand bills for
Alright, we got four more on Facebook to get through
here. Uh, DJ Melvis
our good pal says, it's you
versus the Grin Reaper in a
duel for your life. You must
choose three different games. One
8-bit console game, one 16-bit
console game, and one arcade game
open choice, to have a score
battle or timed run against
him. What you bring into the
duel? You gotta throw down with the
Grin Reaper an 8-bit game, a 16-bit
game, and an arcade game. What you
bring into the duel? Ooh, this
is a toughie. I know what my time run would be
Okay I would actually break it into Super Mario
Brothers, the very, the first one
I shouldn't say that about Mario 2 because
I'm really fast on speed runs for that game
My score one would actually
be Kirby's Avalanche
on Super Nintendo. Ooh, okay
My arcade one would probably be
the first Killer Instinct. Wow
I was really good at it. Dang, you didn't even
get prepped on that question in advance. Anybody
else want to take a stab at this? I don't even know
Anything that I was super awesome at when I was
like 12 I'm out of practice with so I'd be
screwed if that was the duel
Um,
gosh
Tetris
Uh, 8-bit game
I would pick
E.T. because I was actually fairly decent
at that. You're going way before 8-bits
That's like a 2-bit game
Tetris is your 8-bit game
Master System or
Tetris? Yeah
And then what's Super Nintendo?
I have lots of points
Um,
Kirby's
Superstar
I dominate that game, arcade game
Uh,
Klax
Alright, um
For me, arcade game, easy
DDR. Even though I'm not the best
at it, I can take on most people even in my old
age. Death does have to deal with those heavy robes
That's right, so uh, DDR, we're gonna throw down
in that. 8-bit game
Um, oh
god, uh, anticipation
And I get to be the heels
And uh, 16-bit
game
You know, you think I would say
Super Metroid, but I think I'm actually gonna go with
like, I'm gonna go with Tetris Attack
Because it was basically Pokemon Puzzle League and I was pretty good
at that. Loki. Uh
Dance Dance Revolution, Super Mario
Kart, and
8-bit
That's kinda tough
Um
Mario is missing
What did I play a lot, fuck I didn't even play that
What the fuck did I play a lot of
Um
Contra? No, that's still pretty
fucking hard. Sky Shark was fun
Um, have I done Sky Shark?
I don't think so
Look it up. I don't know, fuck
Duck Hunt, I don't know
That's hand-eye coordination
I should be really good at that, so
Alright, let's move on
Edgar R asks, which video game had
the worst ending?
Mass Effect 3, Mass Effect 3, Mass Effect 3
No, because they
actually fixed it and made it semi-decent
even if it wasn't great
Like, go back to like, you know
Ghouls and Ghosts, you know, where it was like
Congratulation
Or it was like Ghosts and Goblins, excuse me
Or, hey you win
you have to do it all again
Oh god, what games
had really crappy endings
Um
I don't know
I mean, unless there's like the ones where you die
at the end or some shit
Super controversial
Final Fantasy 7, because shit
was not finished
If Final Fantasy 7 had come out in the age of
the internet, it would have been a Mass Effect 3
debacle, it really would have
I probably would actually say the
original state of endings for Mass Effect 3
I did go back and watch them
I'm very glad I
waited to beat the games when the extended
cut came out
Although, I do have to say that I really
hate that
Happy Ending mod, it just is not good
Oh no, no
It doesn't even suit it
Alright, Jon R says
Chrono Trigger greater than Metroid less than
Secret of Evermore, why fight it Rob
we're all right, even Bobby for once
The only reason I read that and entertained it was the for once part, because teehee
Alright, Dartetsuya asks
Remember OLR presents
The Hunt, based on Loki's
favorite novel, Ready Player One
Can we find a way to do that again?
Maybe expand it beyond classic games to include
more geeky stuff so more of our VOG peeps
can participate, that was kind of like
a relay race type of thing
using classic games, right?
Some modern games, yeah it would be fun to do again
It would be really cool if we could, you know, because
our website VOG Network is a social game after all
Not to volunteer Bobby for projects
because I know he's got his plate full already
but maybe in 2014 that could be some
type of thing we look at doing
It would be fun, yeah I'd be down for it
By that time maybe the movie will come out
Who knows, who knows
I think it would be great, especially if we could tie it into
a charity thing, like everybody has to
pony up ten bucks to participate
and like, you know, half the pot goes to
a prize maybe and the other half goes to charity
or it all goes to a charity of
the participant's choosing or something like that, I think it would be a really
great thing
Or it goes to the dark sakura and needs a job fund
That's not a registered
charity
Alright
Oh my gosh
I was going to see if there were any more questions
We're going to keep a couple more times
Where are we?
Okay, one more on
Facebook
Code Man wants to know if you were to cosplay
what would you cosplay as?
Well a lot of us have cosplay
What happens I cosplay as?
What would you cosplay as now?
Actually I can tell you what my next cosplay is going to be
My friend Chadi
who I think you might have met
She wanted, we did a stupid
online quiz for Homestuck about what would
your god tier be so we were going to just do our god tier
outfits
Which mine would be the self of heart
I need to cosplay as Joker
because I got the red beard to pull it off
so I would think
that would be a character I'd resemble pretty well
that I could cosplay
I found tutorials
Talk to me later
Low key
Alan, any interest in cosplaying?
What would you cosplay as?
Um
I don't know
Low key
There you go
Um
I guess I would cosplay
Actually it's funny
There's only two things that I kind of wanted to
cosplay just because it both involves
building cool things
Some sort of giant mech thing
Although then I'd have to learn how to walk on stilts and that sounds dangerous
Or get one of those
costumes that's like the
really realistic looking
raptor dinosaur thing
Because it'd be fun to run around with that shit
I just want that costume
It's pretty sweet
I have a better answer
A replacement answer
Gender swapped ooh la la
That would actually be really cool
I would cosplay as one of the other characters
You have like orange vinyl bell bottoms
That's amazing
Travis over on Google Plus
The lone Google Plus respondent says
Hey Robin gang just finished Tomb Raider
And was going to start on Deus Ex Human Revolution
Was wondering what you all thought about each game
Loved Tomb Raider
Didn't get a chance to play Deus Ex Human Revolution
You should download it quickly because it is
free on the PlayStation Network right now
Oh is it?
Thanks for the tip
And Hitman is one they just added too
I watched, I think it was TimTrip was playing Hitman
The new one and it looked pretty neat
It looked like a game I would be terrible at
And Jet Set Radio is on there free as well
Good lord
I was downloading Hitman today
I'm playing Dota 2 right now
I suck at it but I like it
I know you Rob have been playing it
What do you think about the learning curve of the game
Are you having as much trouble as me?
Keep up the good work love you guys
Thank you Travis
Yes I am having as much trouble as you
You just have to jump in there and do it
I think that's the only way
The good news is Dota 2 has a very robust
tutorial system
Don't be afraid to do the single lane match
I really learned
I do not like playing melee classes
But I like playing
ranged classes
One of the ones I really liked was The Lich
Because it's basically a parody of
Arnold Schwarzenegger and Batman and Robin
Chill out
Everybody freeze
The Lich is like that in Dota 2
This is my new favorite character
So check that out
Alright there it is
The end of Ask Orange Lounge
But lots of good questions
How could we not do that
Alright let's do some stories
Mailbag a few of the week coming up
Twitter topics and the skype line
But we have some news first
Ok so there's a quick comparison
Because we've gotten some information about
The DVR function
Of those
Different next gen consoles
So first off
Game DVR
For the Xbox One
There was a Q&A section
I had to laugh
So IGN did this
Ask Microsoft
An AMA thing that they have on
Reddit and stuff
Except that none of the people that
You know
I'm bringing you a handful of Ask Microsoft
Anything answers each Monday at 2pm
Blah blah blah
But the people that
Participated on IGN didn't get the fucking
Answer any of those questions
It was all shit from IGN
Probably you know
Stuff that Microsoft said
Ok here's what we're gonna give you answers for
So anyways so one of those things
About you know
The game capture stuff they're saying
Well fours of five clips capture 1080p
And 60 frames per second and you know
Where can game DVR clips be uploaded to
And they're saying game DVR clips
Capture beautiful 720p
30 frames per second
Video and I believe it's up to
Five minutes if that was correct
One of the things that kind of sucks
Though is you have to have Xbox Live Gold
In order to use that feature
So they're locking it behind a paywall
And of course
In typical simly fashion
As of late
They responded back on Twitter
And this is from
Shuhei Yoshida
Basically
Saying that hey guess what
The Playstation 4
DVR function will record
Up to 15 minutes of gameplay
In the background and won't be
Behind a paywall you do not need Playstation
Plus in order to access
The game recordings or streaming functionality
So
Cool
I honestly don't think this is that big a deal
It's not a huge deal
I mean especially since you know if you're gonna be
Capturing video and stuff you probably
Want to upload it but there
You probably have your own set of equipment too
If you're really serious about it
I understand that but the thing was is they were
Basically saying well it's behind a paywall because
You know you need to upload it to the cloud
Or something like that but if you're uploading a clip
To YouTube
I don't understand I guess this is what it's doing
It's capturing a video and it's uploading it to the cloud
And then you edit it in the cloud then it gets forward to the YouTube
It just seems like a really unnecessary process
But whatever
I mean
I think a lot of people are gonna be getting the Xbox
One probably already have
Xbox Live Gold or
Will be getting gold and also
Now that you only have to have one account per family
That has gold if you're gaming on one system
That's not a huge deal but
Still though it does kind of suck that there's
Yet another feature behind a paywall
Alright well Bungie has a
New game coming out soon Destiny and of course
Bungie was best known as the makers of the
Halo series for quite some time
And you know Halo isn't
Always a game known for its best online
Behavior and not only do you have the language
That people use on things like Xbox Live
But then of course you know teabagging
Corpses and everything else that people do
So Chris Butcher
Who is a Bungie technical director was asked
In an interview with Edge about
How are you gonna address
Some of these aggressive behaviors people have
And he's mentioning that the developers
Are talking about positive social behavior
Rewarding in these games
If you look back at online multiplayer
Gaming for the last 10 years the dominant
Thread has been adolescent males shooting each
Other in the face and squatting on each other's
Corpses at least they acknowledge it
That emerges from design decisions
The community gets attracted towards that
And that is popular to a lot of other people
And so it tends to exclude others
What they're trying to do is they want to exclude
Certain in game gestures
And have the mapping of in game gestures
Like waving and dancing to encourage
More collaboration and friendliness
Less posturing and aggression
Here's the other quote
You give people these tools that encourage
Them to interact positively with each other
And then if someone is interacting negatively
With you well they can't ruin your
Experience now they can just dance on your corpse
I know it seems a little bit naive
To me for a company that's you know did just
That's just like trying to like say hey we're
Giving you a game where you can draw things but we're gonna
Band the dicks it's not gonna happen
You're just not just
Like if you if all you leave
In is a little waving emote people
Are gonna figure out how to fist each other
Using the terrain
That's what's gonna happen
Come on
But we'll see
You underestimate their ability to
Create lewd gestures
But I do think rewarding good behavior is a good thing
League of Legends does it and it feels pretty good
When I get the little karma point after a match
Because I was friendly to people
I really wish WoW would implement a similar system
So you know yeah it would be cool if they would reward
The good behavior in Destiny but we'll see
Where if someone gets killed by somebody else
And they try to squad on them they get launched into space
It would be funny
That would be awesome
And then people would do it on purpose to see what happens
That would be kind of like a rad mod like you should be able to
Carry around like little enhancements and one of them
Could be like a time bomb
On your corpse so somebody tries to teabag you
It sets off the bomb and they go flying that would be funny
Anyway
Dark Sakura
Well in other news
Apart from teabagging and exploding into space
There's an ad
That Target put out
That shows the PS Vita
Going for 200 bucks
And
Basically there hasn't been
Like a big announcement on anything like that
Sony didn't say anything
But it's in a Target ad and they have to get it from somewhere
Basically this was
Shown on
Blu-ray forums
With them all being marked down to $199.99
At Target beginning August 18th
To August 24th
But there's been no confirmation
I mean this could have just been some sort of
Photoshopping deal
But looking at
The image
You can see bleed through from the other side
For the ads on the other side
Which is a lot
More effort to put into photoshopping
Than most people will do
Also considering where it's coming from
The Blu-ray forums they're just looking at Blu-ray
Discounts and stuff like that
Focusing on
Gaming consoles
I think if anything
They're probably trying to clear out some inventory
Move some of that product because they've been sitting on it for a while
Yeah
The first thing that I do when I see stuff like this
Is make sure that it's not a Photoshop job
Also
There is a message
From the article itself
Saying that Inside Gaming Daily
Reported speculation about
Doing a $500
Vita PS4 bundle
Yeah I don't think they'd do that
Like I said, speculation
But it would kind of go in if they did decrease
The cost of the PS Vita
Then that would make it easier
To bundle with the system
For $499?
Is that what they were saying?
Well they were saying
Yeah $500 bundle
But again
If you've got the system going up for $399
And then you threw in a $100 Vita
And it competes with
Basically the
Xbone
You're actually getting a better deal
With the Playstation
It better come with a Lamborghini
And a Virgin Galactic space flight
And a trip to Dubai
Maybe not
I would rather have a system with a handheld system
Than have to deal with the stupid Kinect bullshit
Just saying
It'd be nice if it was true
I don't know if I'd want a $100
Space flight
That sounds kind of dangerous
So Nintendo is fighting piracy
And this is actually more of like
Legit piracy
This is coming from
A website
Wait wait wait
What is legit piracy?
Like making physical goods
Like
Duplicating physical goods
For example
They filed a lawsuit against
Hackyourconsole.com
Other than selling the R4 device
And similar things
They also happen to sell hard drives
That are preloaded with 200 Wii games
Hmm that sounds a
Bit bad
That's pretty clear cut there
They've lawsuit against them
And most likely
They're probably going to win
That's pretty clear cut
If they were just selling the R4 devices
I'd say that they may have
A little bit of a fight ahead of them
But selling actual
You know
Hard drives that are full
Of
Games that's kind of bad
Alright
Well I don't know what else to say about that
I mean if you're doing some bad stuff
You're going to get shut down eventually
There's really no arguing that right?
Yeah it looks like actually they've removed
The modded Wii consoles off their site
All right well
Moving on to talk about
Street Fighter 5
Nothing's been announced
Don't get too excited
After all we still have Ultra Street Fighter 4
To get through
There's at least a dozen more adjectives they can slap on to 4
Well you're going to have
Alina, Rolento, Hugo
Poison and who knows who else
Coming to Ultra Street Fighter 4
But here's the thing
According to one of the producers at Capcom
Jackie Ayano says that
Users do not need to worry because
The characters will definitely not be just copy and pasted
For Street Fighter X Tekken
If we did that they would undoubtedly be the strongest characters
In the game so
These characters will be redone for Ultra Street Fighter 4
But what happens next?
Well
It took 6 years to go from Street Fighter 2
To Street Fighter 3
And 9 years to go from Street Fighter 3 to Street Fighter 4
So it would probably take us until
The year 2018
Before Street Fighter 5 comes out
So yes no Street Fighter 5 until 2018
But look forward to
Insert adjective here Street Fighter 4
Each and every year until then
Single adjective please
In 2018 I'll be turning 40
And that makes me sad
And you'll be 42
40 also
Not 42
But at least we'll have Street Fighter 5
At our birthday party to celebrate
You can both be quiet
I have 3 years for that shit
That's right you forgot 40
And amazing
Anyhow can you believe we started
This show and I was what like
23 or having my 24th birthday
And
Now we're getting old as the show's getting old
We'll probably still be doing OLR
Hey kids
50 come hey kids come
Listen to our super cool show about games
Oh but then again all you guys
I tried to play this Kinect shit and broke
My hip all you guys listening you're all
Getting older too so
We do have listeners that are older than us
Yeah you guys will all be like 30
My 30's are awesome
For the record
Alright let's get to the mailbag
Speaking of our listeners we love to hear from our listeners
I mean yeah we do
Shut up of course we do we love to hear from our listeners
Every week and you can
Email us mailbag at
Plowandtrader.com
DarkSakura will be peer pressured into reading her
Favorite emails here on the show
Read the emails
God dang Rob
Hi all Ragenator here
Here's a last second short random question
What is the worst game each of you have played
And what qualifies said games as being the worst
I can tell you one that was so bad
That Dan and I took it back to a
Botbuster and requested a refund
That was like some
wrestling game it was thunder like WCW
Thunder
This is when we were on a really big wrestling kick
And it was just bad
We were like what the hell is this
And also Spice World
Fusion Frenzy 2 is the worst
Game in recent memory that I've played
It was so fucking bad
Yaris
That was gonna be my answer
Me too me too
Alright that's it
So short
God this is long
With links to YouTube that I am not
Going to address because first of all
Can't watch YouTube on my iPad
Thank you
You can watch YouTube on your iPad
Yes I can but not during the show
Alright just to be clear
Stop it
Greetings OLR
First off I hope you guys enjoyed your week off
I might have if I still had a job
I know we can all use one
Anyway I thought I'd share some thoughts about
Phil Fish's recent childish outburst
First of all I'm greatly disappointed that you
Guys improperly present Marcus
Beer's complaint
At least to me he seemed more angry than Phil Fish
And Jonathan Blow were acting
As though being asked questions
Was some sort of unreasonable burden
In case you haven't linked
I'd certainly love to see what Phil Fish
And Jonathan Blow said to Game Informer leading up
To this however with only Marcus's
Initial rant and Fish's immature response
It just looks like a lot of grief could have
Been saved with more
Boilerplate non-committal response
Which leads me to my position
Phil Fish cancelled Fez 2 and is
Leaving the game industry just because a few people
Called out his condescending nonsense
Seriously?
I'm some
Insignificant twit in Miami who gets
Worse every time he sends an email to the show
Saying something someone doesn't like
But do you see me pitching my skirt and running away?
No
The only reason I haven't sent an email lately
Is because I've not had anything to say before this
You ask me Marcus is 100% right on this
If you don't have anything to say
Or you're looking for a confirmation
You can say so
You can give a rote
We do not comment on rumors and speculation
If you like
However unless you're going to do a massive TV and radio advertisement
Carpet bombing
It's not a good idea to treat the press like
They're the worst thing that's ever existed
If they're not asking anything personal
Or trying to create controversy for page hits
Then treat them with the measure of respect
That you want them to treat you
Or more importantly your game
Honestly I hope the press takes
Marcus Spears advice
I hope Blow and Fish
Have trouble for the rest of their careers
Finding press who want to endure
Their nonsensical whining
Because that's the only thing that hostile
That hostile assholes deserve
Unfortunately I know that Fish will come back
To kickstarter for Fez 2
And get his goal times a billion
Because most gamers stop thinking for themselves
When words like innovation and independent
Are thrown about
This is of course while many other developers
In the air know struggle to gain any attention at all
There truly is no justice in the world
Anyway
Quick question now, thank you
I had a quick question unrelated to this nonsense
Recently Giant Bomb had a quick look
Of Dynasty Warriors 8
In which the only bit of information that could be gleaned
They looked at it was that the Xbox 360 version
Was a poorly done port
Why was there so little information
For such a long video
Because Jeff and Vinny were devoted to hammering
The hit X joke into the ground
And whining about how they hated the series as a whole
Anyway I've never played
A Musou game before and was mainly
Scared off of them as it seems many of the media
Outlets I frequent have the same attitude
Of dismissing the games at first glance
Then you need to re-destruct
Doid and Jim Sterling
See some people
Sorry to interrupt but some people
Are here for that and I think either you're
Kind of like a fan of those types of games
Some people get great pleasure
Out of button mashing X and kill kill kill
Die die die
See that's the thing with reviewers
You can't just take some anonymous reviewers
Opinion for it, you gotta look at what they like
And if they like similar games
That you like then that's the reviewer
You follow as far as whether
You may like something that
If they like that genre of game
Then yes that would probably be
One that you wanna, if they say it's truly bad
Then you know
I get really stressed out and irritated too
When I hear these big media outlets
Talking about things that they don't know a lick about
Like you know I think a great example
Going back to X-Play
When they talked about how Beatmania on the Playstation 2
Was a rip off of Guitar Hero
I was like um
Um no
But then I have to remember
I don't really give a shit what X-Play thinks
You know and I don't really base my decisions
Off that show
So I have to find the reviewer that best matches me
And you say a lot
With your voice when you tune out
Yeah but if you don't look at multiple sources
You may miss something
I'm not saying focus necessarily on just one
But you do have to kinda
You have to find those that kinda mesh well with your taste
I think like Loki said
I don't know much about these Jim Sterling reviews
But it sounds like if he's more of a fan of these
It's counter balanced to what you saw happen over on
There's more in the email
There's a lot more in the email
However I read a blog defending the series
And this was on Giant Bomb
And was immediately struck by the passionate defense of the series
And the blogger's reactions for loving it as he does
Intrigued by the case he made
I picked up Warriors Orochi 3 Hyper
For Wii U
As a sort of test for how I'd feel
I ended up enjoying the game immensely
And have since picked up Dynasty Warriors 8 for the PS3
And the original Warriors Orochi for 360
In addition to importing the PS3 version
Of Dynasty Warriors 7 Empires
I think about this now
Against the current backdrop of people passionately tearing
Apart reviewers for having a less than positive
Opinion of Dragon's Crown to the point where
Atlas had to defend controversial reviews
By the way
My problem with Dragon Crown is just
The
I love and hate the art style in that game
And that's really what I hate
Did you see the minigame where the girl's chained up
And you can touch her and she squirms?
Yeah, I hate that
Anyway, going onward
While I don't like the game either
After having played it
I can safely assume that were I on the fence
Controversial ranting
We're seeing now would not have driven me
To try the way the game
The way the impassioned
Immature defense of Dynasty Warriors
I mentioned earlier had moved me
With that in mind, here's my inquiry
I thought it was a short question
Okay
I'm sorry RossoUT
I actually really like your emails because of how well
Written they are and just how well you lay out
Your ideas
You know what, I do appreciate that
He does come back when he's got something to say
Yes
With that in mind, here's my inquiry
Uh oh, I need to make sure I don't get out of chat
Okay
First, why does defending
Something often turn into attacks on disagreeing
Reviewers despite it being counterproductive
To the apparent goal of winning
Over the indecisive
Well to go on that first, I mean look at freaking politics
Oh god yes
I think that's more human, that's not something specific to gaming
That's human nature
Yeah that's human nature, my way or the highway
And as I mentioned in part A, people actually do get a positive
Chemical response from having other people agree with them
And by presenting
Their own information
It is
I think it's a dopamine response
Where if you, people actually feel better
Attacking something that's outside
It feels good to be validated and affirmated
Get out
I understand
But for some people they actually take that
Aggression side of it and get kind of an adrenaline
Rush off of it
You know, you get into that
Especially the more passionate you feel about something
You stop really caring about what other people think
Your idea or nothing
And you do get an emotional rush out of it
So it really is just basic
Biochemistry and psychology
Anybody else?
Want to expand?
Nah go ahead because I know there's at least a couple more
Second, have you ever been moved by an
Unpopular games defenders to give said game
A chance?
Mass Effect
Yeah Mass Effect is a good example
And it wasn't unpopular but a lot of people
I wasn't going to give it a chance
Well at the time, remember we got into it right when
Mass Effect 3 had first come out
There was all that ending wank
So I don't know about the unpopular part
Well god even just this week
I gave Team Fortress 2 a try
I didn't think I'd like it but Act Deaf was like
No you gotta try, you gotta try
I think it's a massively unpopular game
Yeah that's true, I guess Team Fortress isn't really unpopular either
Well god, what about the music games
We used to play for years
I don't think those cracked into the mainstream
Well and I actually liked Kraken DJ
For a while, I thought that was fun
And a lot of people were like yeah
Um
I know that there were others because um
Like some of the weirder treasure
Games that people were kind of poo pooing on
I thought were great, you know like, I liked Chameleon
Twist, I liked uh
Mischief Makers, those were fun games
You know, anything?
Okay, anyway keep up the good work
Guys, I look forward to your response
Regards, we're all still UT
Alrighty, two more to go
Alright, dearest denizens of
Podcastopia
So I got a summons for jury duty
For next week, I'm sorry
I didn't know on what day this week
I will have to drag my happy ass out of bed
To be at the courthouse at 8am to do my civic duty
But I do know that day is
Not Monday, this gives me at least one
Day to download a game off PSN
To play on my Vita
What should I get? Preferably
I'd like something that won't make a lot of noise
But will require me to make a lot of
Movements that look vaguely threatening to old people
Stay black, redertainment
Trainer
Uh
Gaming during jury duty is
There is going to be long periods of waiting
You know what?
You know the Sacramento courthouse that make you turn off all your devices
What? When you're in
Oh, when you're in the room, when you're in the
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but I mean like while you're waiting
In the jury hall, while you're waiting in the hallway
I have always spent more time
In the stupid jury selection
Than I have ever in the lines
So any suggestions
For Vita games that make you look
Vaguely spasmodic?
Not that don't involve Kinect
Katamari!
Um, Little Big Planet?
Maybe
Or I
I can't recommend this because
The game is bad, but a fighting game
Involves in there's
Cap Comics Tekken
So that'll be
Mashing the buttons and looking mean
Yeah
I definitely see looks of frustration
In playing that, so that makes sense
So we do have one last email
Hey OLR crew
AZHP here
I never asked, is it AZHP or AZHP?
I think it's AZHP
I thought the HP was Harry Potter
Okay
Last week I went to a convention
Co-founded by a good friend of mine called
GamerX
My girlfriend cosplayed as Zelda
Which as anime fans is the most mainstream
Game cosplay she had
I wanted to write in to say
She had a super positive experience
Even as a completely straight couple
Everyone who wanted a picture with her was super enthusiastic
And didn't give off the typical creeper vibe
That comes with most convention goers
When they said
I love your costume, it's amazing
She didn't feel like they were trying to hit on her
And genuinely enjoyed her costume
Even though we didn't go to many of the panels
And the dealer's hall was clearly geared toward
The LGBT crowd
The vibe we got from the convention was super positive
The game room was lots of fun
The Japanese version of Project Diva F
The Saturn version of Puzzle Bobble
And Typing of the Dead on Dreamcast
I was actually surprised
There weren't that many furries at the convention
Given that I know a lot of gamers are also
Furries
There were a couple, because they were even advertising a furry con
That's coming up, had one of the booths
So, you know, hey, whatever you like
As long as it's, you know, consensual
I unfortunately wasn't able to stay
Late enough to catch the podcast panel
I definitely regret
Missing my chance to say hi to Rob
Squinty face
Anyway, I definitely recommend people check it out
It's definitely a fun experience
Well, definitely, lots of definitelys there
Check it out again next year if it's in San Francisco again
Yours truly is HP
P.S. If you guys are interested
Here's a picture of the Zelda costume my girlfriend wore
I actually looked at the picture
And I saw her
Which must have been I saw you at some point
And I was like
Wow, that is fucking good
Feel free to link in the chat
I helped make the harp
So it was cool hearing people compliment it at the convention
So I'm pulling it up
Very nice
Yeah, it was very good
Yeah, if you can put that in chat
I'm sure the chatters would like to see that
Very well done
I saw her in the gaming room
Playing one of the dancing games
Alright, well I'm gonna copy this
If I didn't actually close the window
Alright, that's it for
Emails tonight, right?
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
We're almost to 9 o'clock
So let's try to jam through the rest of this pretty quick
Because I do want to get in some calls
So we're gonna go to the FUs
Of the week
Dark Sakura
I was debating whether or not
I wanted to say their name on air
But I'm going to
FU to Bonnie Plumbing Heating and Air
For giving indications
Of being the type of hypocritical conservative Christians
That I personally do not like
Allegedly
Loki
Oh, and my battery
FU to my car
I'm not really sure what it's doing
But whenever I turn all the way to the right
My radio shuts off
That's weird
That's a little creepy
FU to this fucking con plague
I've been carrying since Tuesday
And FU to Extifer
Who allegedly gave it to me
Alan
FU to the associated dental issues
That someone can get when they're in their 30s
And also FU to the fact that I think
Sanrio chewed through
The microphone portion cable
Of my headset
Though it doesn't look chewed
It looks like someone just snipped it with scissors
Because you know how a headset has the green
And the red for the mic
It forks off like a snake stone at the very end
I wonder why she would have chewed that
It's weird
She's gonna have to buy a new headset
It's like 40 bucks that I don't have
Alright, there it is, you have to use the week
Loki
Alright, so more Xbox One news
This is once again
Something else that they've kind of changed their mind on
And that was the whole inclusion
Of a chat headset
With the Xbox One
Yes, the Xbox One
Day one edition will come with a chat headset
So it'll be very much like it was with the Xbox 360
Originally, they were planning not to include one of those
And you'd have to buy it separately
So, good to know
You're getting some more value for your $500
Hooray! I guess a lot of people are very excited about that
More value is good
And also hooray, I want to end on a positive note tonight
Because unfortunately a lot of times
We have to talk about, you know, gaming studios
That are closing
And people that are out of a job
But tonight we get to say hooray
In Vancouver, Namco Bandai is opening a new office
And it's gonna be dedicated to mobile and online titles
But about 30 people working there in Vancouver
Making these titles
No word of course on what those games are
But, yay
And since this is a Namco story
Can I say something real quick?
Please do
They're talking about this in chat
Pac-Man Champion Edition DX is coming to Steam
It's a DX Plus version
Out of respect for Dark Sakura
I will say I purchased early
I purchased in advance
I did not pre-purchase because that's not a thing
I purchased early the game
Oh, stop feeding her
Alan is perfectly right
If you purchase early
Because it's not gonna be playable until September 24th
And they took my $9.99
So if you purchase early you'll get
What I think is going to be a DLC pack
It's extra songs, extra maps
And you can play as the little Dig Dug avatar
I thought some of that was supposed to be part of it anyway
And a little race car avatar
Well it says Act Def in chat pasted the Steam link
And it'll say purchase now and you'll get all this crap
So, new Pac-Man or Pac-Man DX is such an amazing game
Yeah, it is a great Pac-Man game
It's coming to Steam
Alright, we're gonna open up the phones now
It's that time, 1877 Game OLR
Or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio
If you want to give us a call
And talk with us about anything we've talked about tonight
Or maybe you have something that we didn't cover
That you want to talk about
But, there it is
The phones are open
1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype
Orange Lounge Radio
I saw at least one tweet come through that I want to get to
Here quickly
Otherwise, do we have any last minute stories?
Loki, Dark Sakura?
Yeah, I can talk real quick about
They announced, well, I knew about them
They announced the characters for the second wave
Of Disney Infinity stuff
That's going to be starting in October
And those include such things as like the Wreck-It Ralph
Characters, so you get Wreck-It Ralph
They've got
What else here?
Of course, the Toy Story pack is going to be coming around
At the same time as the Buzz Lightyear
Jesse are going to be in the actual pack
And then Woody is going to be sold separately
They're going to have the Phineas and Furb
Or Phineas and Agent P
And then of course, like I said
Ralph, Vanellope
And then kind of some one-offs
They have Rapunzel from Tangled
Jack Skellington
And, um
Let me, I'm on Fantasia
We actually have a call on the line
You can probably hear the coffee in the background
We have a call on the line
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
Hello, it's Codeman
Hey Codeman, how you doing?
Sorry for the Facebook sounds, Rob
You better be
Do what?
Is that you coughing? Or is that the little one?
Oh no, she's asleep
Oh, okay, well what's up?
Oh no, I was just wanting to know if everyone's excited about August 13th
I am totally jazzed about Tuesday
And why?
Is this Disney Infinite?
Or what is it that you're excited about?
DuckTales, isn't it?
Oh, DuckTales
I am excited about that, yes
So excited I forgot the day
Well, and like, what I was
Just so fan, I mean, I was just
Amazed about, like, they brought back
Every single voice actor
Yes
That has ever played in the DuckTales series
And, and, I'm not
Quite sure how old
The voice actor is for Scrooge McDuck
He's in the, he's in his 90s, I know that
Yeah, the lady with the magic of the spell
Is old as hell too
Yeah, and like, I was just
Amazed at how the voice actually
Sounded in, like, the trailers and stuff
And I was like, it's
It's perfect, like, it's the same
Exact voice that was in
The, you know, the game back in the day
So I, you know, I'm really excited about that
I just wanted to call in and talk about that
Because I am just stoked
About this game, I haven't been so
Excited, well, except
For when Earthbound was released, but
But, I mean, I'm excited
So excited about the game
What platform? How do you guys feel about the game?
Yes, I will definitely be picking it up
But even I can't decide what platform
Do I get it on, because I could do
PC, I could do Wii U
Because, you know, it's kind of the newest thing out there
I could get PlayStation 3
Because, you know, trophies or whatever
Xbox 360s, where a lot of my friends will probably be
I don't know, I don't know what system to get it on
Have you decided?
Unfortunately, I don't think they're releasing it
For the Mac, so I can't get it on Steam
But I can, I think
I'm gonna be picking it up on the Wii U
Why is that?
Well, because, I don't know, it's just nostalgic
Of, like, it being on Nintendo
Like, when I used to play it when I was a kid
And so, like, I feel like I should play it on a
Nintendo console, it sounds stupid
No, not at all
I just feel like I should play it on a Nintendo console
Okay, fair enough, I think I might end up
Getting it on Wii U, because at least it does have the
Off-screen play, which, you know, as little
As it is, it is something the other
Platforms don't get, so, and I think
Xbox 360 is delayed anyway, so, I mean
Yeah, I think it's September
I could be wrong, but I think it's September
13th or 14th, but I could be wrong
I am, that's what I enjoy about the whole
Earthbound things, you know, because my wife
You know, she might want to watch Hulu
Or Netflix or something, and I could just sit here
On my Wii U tablet and play Earthbound
All night, so that was really cool
Oh, Nintendo wants you to sell some Wii U's
That's exactly what they want to hear
No, I love that about that console
You know, I picked up Metroid
You know, and all that stuff
And so I can just sit there on my tablet
And play that, so that's really cool
Excellent
Well, anything else you're looking forward to
Over these coming weeks?
Well, I mean, not really
I'm going to be playing the hell out of DuckTales
So that's probably the only thing
I'm going to be playing for a while
I've been playing Don't Starve
It has stolen my life
It literally has, I mean, that game
I don't know if you've played it yet
I haven't
Not yet, but tell the listeners more about it
For those that don't know, because you have been trying to
Get me in on this game
Well, Don't Starve is basically a roguelike game
I mean, you start out at day one
It is the title
I mean, you're basically trying to survive
And you just continue
On and on and on
And you go through all the seasons
You start out in the spring
Well, actually, I think you start in the summer
And then you go into the spring, and then you go into the winter
And then everything has everything to do with
Like, you have to build
Coats
To stay warm
You have to, you know, fires at night
So you don't die from creatures in the night
And all that stuff
You have sanity that you have to keep up
You have to constantly keep your belly full of food
And then you have to constantly keep your health up
So, I mean, it's such
A frustrating game, because you get
I think the other day I got to like
Day 34 or something in the winter
And I just ran out of food
Because nothing grows in the winter
And so then I died at day 34
And it just starts you
Back at day one with nothing
I mean, I haven't played a roguelike game in forever
So, I mean, it's just
It's very frustrating, but it's a very fun game
And I would suggest anybody
On Steam to buy it
And play the hell out of it
I think it's $14.99
And that's everything
And they update it constantly
With new places to go
In wormholes
And then there's like a
There's different worlds all throughout the game
So you can just continue going to different worlds
I mean, it's an amazing game
Well, I'm going to have to check that out at some point
It does sound pretty hot
And I live for roguelikes
I'm enjoying Rogue Legacy as well, by the way
Alright, well, Codeman, I'm going to let you go
Thanks for calling in. Do you have anything you need to plug?
Want to plug before we get out?
No, not really
I mean, we still have our podcast
We still do it from time to time
We've mostly moved to YouTube
We do Google Hangouts
But it's the YouTube.com
Backslash The Down For Maintenance podcast
Well, I think it's like the DFM podcast
But you can look us up on YouTube
And then I have a YouTube channel
But, I mean, it's really hard to remember
I mean, it's YouTube.com
Backslash C. Taylor 1785
Because YouTube won't let me change it
But, yeah, you should do more Let's Plays, Rob
You know, I was gifted by a kind listener
Another scary game called Paranormal
And that is up on the list of things I need to play, too
Holy crap, that game is fantastic
I hate it and love it all at the same time
I'm not sure if I'm looking forward to it
Alright, Codeman, I'm going to let you go, buddy
Alright, well, I'll talk to you guys later
Alright, take care
Alright, bye
Alright, and our phones are lighting up
We've got another call coming in right now
So let's go to the phones
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio
Who's this?
This is Shane
Hey, Shane, how you doing?
I'm hot, it's like really hot here right now
Isn't it like
You should come to California
Isn't it hotter there?
Yeah, probably
But not at night, so come here
Yeah, maybe
We're not Phoenix or anything, and it's a dry heat
Phoenix is terrible
It is terrible
What's up?
Pokemon
Oh, did you hear my little dedication to you earlier?
Yeah, I take some issues with that dedication
Why?
Well, first of all, you ended it too quick
Like, there's never enough time to talk about Pokemon
Like, okay, for example, my job today
I had a demo and I was demoing the new Mario and Luigi game
And all the people that showed up
Pretty much just wanted to talk Pokemon with me
Which I was fine with, that was fun
Way more fun than demoing a game
But, yeah, like, I don't like the thought that it should have stopped after 151 Pokemon
Sorry, Jamie
Just because, like, that would have been boring
You have to keep the series going
And if you only had those same 151 were, like, 15 years now
Or something like that since they first came out
That would have been terrible
So, yeah, we're at 649 plus whatever new ones are in here
But it's still really fun
And these mega evolutions, like the new trailer that was posted is awesome
And it reminds me of Power Rangers
So I am on board
Wait a minute
100% on board
Wait a minute, because the other night you said, I don't know
I know, but then they put a trailer that made it look like Power Rangers to me
And that is all you need to do
If there is more blue in the trailer and maybe some Taco Bell
Which I'm still kind of boycotting
Wait, you're boycotting Taco Bell?
Yes, they got rid of some stuff I liked
Uh-oh, that's right, they got rid of the volcano stuff, I forgot
Yeah, and I really liked that
We had this conversation the other night
Fifth Dream in our chat room with a question for Shane
Hey, they don't ask us questions anymore, they ask the caller's questions
Fifth Dream wants to know, Shane, did you watch any of the Pokemon Championships?
Yes, and I didn't want to
I was just really bored, I was like, okay, this will be fun
And that's my sarcastic voice
So I put it on, it was so fun
Like, it was really fun to watch
And I watched some of the finals today before work
And I was getting excited and there was no reason to
And I feel like it was when I liked basketball
When the NCAA tournament was going on
Like, I just got sucked in and it was amazing
Was it the Pokemon card game?
They had the card game later today, which I was at work for
So I couldn't watch that, it was the actual video games
Wow, and Nintendo let them stream it?
Well, because it's Nintendo sponsored
Me and my friend Danny, we want to go to next year's championships
It's in DC, this year was in Vancouver
But they get all sorts of cool stuff
They have all this merchandise
And things that you won't find anywhere else
Just at the World Championships
And like today, or yesterday, they announced a new mega evolution
And that they haven't put out anywhere else
And they announced that they're going to have a soundtrack out on iTunes
This November for X and Y, it's going to have 220 tracks
Good lord
Like, yeah, that's ridiculous
Oh my gosh
And I will have it day one
So, what's the countdown to X and Y at this point?
How many days left?
It's like, almost exactly two months
Tomorrow will be two months
But for me, I don't know, because I'll get it early
So, sucks to be everybody else
At least you have Final Fantasy XIV to hold you over, right?
Yes, yes
And I learned today, 100%
Because they put some sort of graph out
That if I get the PS3 collector's edition
Which I'm getting through Amazon, because I had gift cards
So it's fully paid off
And I apply it to my current PC account
I will be able to play on both
For the free 30 days
And because I'm an old player
My 30 days won't kick in until September 10th
So I'll have from the 24th of August till September 10th
Not paying anything
And then September 11th for the next 30 days for free as well
Hmm
There you go
And you get all that collector's edition crap that you don't need
Um, don't need?
That's rude
Well, what's in there that you need?
The book, the art book is going to be fantastic
The baby soundtrack
Because the other soundtrack is just way too expensive
And I don't have anything that can play it except for a PS3
Even though I want the little pet
And um
The box
Okay, it's the box
That's acceptable to say, right?
Like, because the box looks cool
Alright, fair enough
Yes, exactly
Alright, Shane, anything else before we let you go?
Um, everybody should watch that new trailer
It has like rock music that plays during it
And it's like remixed, I think, of a gym theme
And seriously, if it doesn't remind you of Power Rangers
Which is what I'm seeing from everybody's comments
Everywhere on the internet that I'm looking right now
You're crazy
Because the end with the five of them lined up
And their mega evolutions is totally Power Rangers
It's awesome
Alright, anything you want to plug while you're here on the show?
Um
Well, I just plugged Pokemon X and Y
And we talked about Final Fantasy XIV
Um
Yes, sure
Apparently, there's a really cool Konami game in Japan
Called Sound Vortex
And I've watched videos and it's awesome
Somebody, I guess, cracked it
So you can play on your PC
And there are websites now building controllers
For the Sound Vortex game that you can buy
That you'd be able to hook up to your PC and play it
And that game is so cool looking
You need to link me this
I need to get a link to Sound Vortex
Or for the controller
The controller is like $300 and some dollars
I can link you the gameplay
It's amazing
Alright, get on the case, Nancy Drew
Uh, my name is Shane
Alright, bye, Shane
Bye
1877 Game OLR
Our username on Skype is
OrangeLoungeRadio
Going to some tweets real quick
I'm going to do these pretty quick here because we're running kind of late tonight
Dark Tetsuya sends the show a tweet that says
Hey, just a note, the latest version of
Super Mario Crossover, or 3.0
Is now out and it's available at

Did they do a Kickstarter for that one?
No, they did a Kickstarter for their game that's not quite
That game, but it's
All the characters changed is slightly
Renamed and their own original levels
Got it, got it
Act F says
The King of Fighters XIII Steam Edition
Trailer was leaked in the Steam store
And removed
So King of Fighters XIII probably coming
To Steam at some point
TigerClaw sent us a tweet
Imagi Studios originally was going to make
A Legend of Zelda movie, check out the short movie
Pitch video and he linked us to YouTube
I actually did see this earlier in the week
And it did look pretty cool
Although there was no, I don't believe there was any voices
In it, but it did, it looked interesting
But you know, Nintendo
Is crazy possessive over their IPs
Ever since that Super Mario Brothers movie was a
Stink bomb, so I'm not
Surprised they didn't get to go forward with it
But it sure made a great little YouTube to look at
Did you guys see that at all?
The little concept, the Zelda pitch
No, it was neat
Alright, I'll give it one more minute
To see if anybody's going to call in, but if not
We'll close up shop, 1-877-GAME-OLR
Or our username on Skype is
OrangeLoungeRadio, anybody else
Have a last minute story for us tonight?
Well, actually
Not necessarily a story, but I'm going to
Start making my 3DS
Cases, and put them
Available to sell before too long
Is that an Etsy thing?
I might do it on Etsy, either that or Storenvy
I'm still deciding
And why would somebody want a 3DS case from Dark Sakura?
Because they are well made and protect your system
A lot better than this flip up in cases do
Fair enough, alright
We do have one more call coming in, this will probably be the last one
For tonight, so let's go to it
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
Hello
Hello
It's OrangeLoungeRadio
Hello
This is HeyacDeft
HeyacDeft, and we see you, it's a video call
Hi
Hello
Is that a My Little Pony?
No, it's a Pokemon
Oh, it's a Pokemon
Uh oh, Shane's going to kill me for that one too
You know, I need to get my plus and minus ones back from Julian
Send them to Shane
Which Pokemon is that?
It's the Pokemon Black and White
Legendary Rusharound
Oh, okay, alright
So you just call in tonight to show off your plushie?
Not really, I want to talk about
Pac-Man Z DX Plus
Ah, the game that
Alan was talking about earlier, right?
Yeah, I'm pretty excited about it
Because I'm a fan of
Pac-Man Z
I played the hell out of it
I even got in the
In the beginning
When it was released
I was in the top 40 scores
That game
Yeah, like I said, I played it a lot
Like, a freaking lot
So I'm pretty excited
To have
Or at least being able to play
DX because what I have
Seen about it, it seems pretty
Damn cool
And mostly
The reason
I haven't even
Been able to play it
It's because
It's not available in Mexico
For some reason
I don't know why
So I'm pretty stoked that it's coming to Steam
Even since the
Announcement
It was a few months ago
I don't remember when exactly
But I'm pretty excited
To see it now
Being able to
Purchase ahead
Not to say pre-purchase or pre-order
Hahahaha
You got everybody trained, DarkSagra
What?
He took great care to make
Sure he said purchase ahead
Yes, which is how it should be
Because it's wrong to put
Unnecessary prefix
Didn't you listen to George Carlin?
Geez, Rob
How dare I speak up
The only sad part is that
We have to wait at least
One month and a half
To be able to play it since it releases
On the 25th
So yeah, but
The extra content will be
Pretty good too
The Rally Access skin
The Dick Duck skin
There's even old school
Pac-Man skin
So that's gonna be pretty cool
I just love that this game is how old
And they're still supporting it
Like this was really a pleasant surprise
Because it was at the point where the game was
Plus, I mean I had it on 360 anyway
But now I have it on PlayStation
Because why not, it was free
So I picked it up there too to try and get some trophies
And now it's pretty cool to know that, oh okay
Now I can get this DLC
Which maybe that's the reason they were giving it away for free
Was to try and make a sale there
But, eh, it'll work
It'll work
Yeah, they sure have gotten a sale out of me
Alright
Well, anything else you're looking forward to this year?
Well, mostly this coming week
Like DuckTales
Like everyone else
I bet Codeman's happy to hear that
What system are you getting DuckTales on?
Most possibly Steam, but I'm still debating on it
Okay
Very cool
Alright, well Act F, we're gonna let you go so we can wrap up the show
But thank you and your little Pokemon there for calling in
Who's waving goodbye, adorable
Alright, bye Act F, thanks for the call
We love the video calls, take care
Alright, that's gonna do it
Shane never answered my question
I'm just gonna see if he wanted my giant Togepi
He probably turned the show off, so don't give it to him
But you know what?
Did I tell you how I got my giant Togepi?
I got held up at gunpoint
Working at GNC
Oh god, yeah, that's a horrible story
And I found $10 in the parking lot outside Toys R Us
And I went in
And I used it to buy myself a giant Togepi
The $20 Togepi
You earned it
And so my giant Togepi
Was like my comfort creature thing
And my Charmander pillow
Well we have to wrap up the show
Guys, it's about that time
We're running a little long tonight
And Alan and I still have errands to run after the show
So we're gonna wrap up the show
I wanna start with Alan tonight
Thank you very much for being here tonight
Really appreciate you being on the show
And lending your wit
And so forth, don't be a stranger
You only live here
So do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
Um
If I can get my headset replaced
I might start doing like an achievement run
In Half Life for Twitch TV
Fun!
You think it's time to go wireless?
I don't know, I've had bad experiences with wireless
Do you have like a Twitter you wanna plug?
Or anything you wanna plug if people wanna
Get your wit online? Because you are really funny
I actually am on Twitter a lot now
I finally got Twitter
How it works
I always just ignore it
Okay
It's very salacious
Alright
Loki, sorry we didn't get to all the last minute news
But we're trying to wrap up
It's been a long show, it's almost 9.30
Do you have any last minute thoughts for our listeners tonight?
Uh
No, not really
And I will say my final thought tonight
Is I better be over this damn cold tomorrow
Because I need to get back to work
I have a ton of work to catch up on for being sick
For two days
One plague can kiss my ass
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight
I want a house
And a job
Probably in that order
In that order
By the way
My cat is the cutest animal in the universe
Um, next to Sanrio, yes
Do you know what the next Pink Berry flavor's gonna be?
Peanut butter
No, that's out now
Butter pecan
Girl
You know what, they need to start paying advertising on this program
For us to keep talking about them
Alright, in all seriousness, thank you for staying with our show tonight
And listening to the show
After a week off, we really appreciate you sticking with us
And supporting independent broadcasting
And if for whatever reason
You listened to this entire show and you thought it was terrible
Hey, that's okay
Just all we ask is, find another great
Independent podcast producer and support that
Support all of our independent podcast friends
And if you do like Orange Lawn Tradio
And you did like what you hear
Help spread the word, tell a friend or five about the show
And spread the word about Orange Lawn Tradio
And help us grow our little family
In the meantime, we will be back next week
Same time and same place
To do it all over again
With DuckTales coming out this week
And Disney Infinity next Sunday
I'm sure there'll be plenty of new stuff to talk about
Oh, I'll probably have Saints Row by then
Final Fantasy XIV beta as well
There'll be lots and lots of stuff next week
Do join us again next week
You guys, thank you very much for tuning in
Have a wonderful week
Good night
Those of the staff of Orange Lawn Tradio
Or VOG Network
But you know they were all still true
See you next week
Thanks for watching!
