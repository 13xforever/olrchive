Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, June 16th, 2013, we discuss the highlights and lowlights of E3 with our listeners.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
One company sues another over Duke Nukem Forever.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
And could a free-to-play game from Nintendo be in the works?

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:38.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 508 for this June 16th, 2013.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
My name is Rob Roberts, here with you every week with my co-hosts.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
Say hello first off to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Thank you for the coffee, it's delicious.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
You're welcome. You caffeinated and ready to go?

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
Oh yes.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
This week's show tonight, also say hello to Tech Master Loki.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Hi.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Sorry to hear about the Minecraft server.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Eh.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
We'll get into that later.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.000
It was a huge week this week and we're not going to fuck around, we're just going to get right into it tonight.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.000
So, honestly, probably one of those huge historical moments in gaming this week.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Let's relive this moment real quick.

01:18.000 --> 01:31.000
In addition to creating an amazing library of new titles on PlayStation 4, we're equally focused on delivering what gamers want most without imposing restrictions or devaluing their PS4 purchases.

01:31.000 --> 01:38.000
For instance, PlayStation 4 won't impose any new restrictions on the use of PS4 gamers.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
Let's see how long that applause goes on.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Yep.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
That's not just the fanboys in the upper ring, that's the journalists too, who can't contain themselves.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Guess that's a good thing.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Oh, and...

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
We believe in the model that people embrace today with PlayStation 3 and continue to demand.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Just heard you there.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
When a gamer buys a PS4 disc, they have the rights to use that copy of the game.

02:15.000 --> 02:22.000
They can trade in the game at retail, sell it to another person, lend it to a friend, or keep it forever.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Bullet.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Bullet.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Bullet.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Bullet.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
That was...

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Wow.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
Some guy standing and cheering in there.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Sit down, fanboy.

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
Well, and don't forget over at the Microsoft area where they're watching, this enormous sound of...

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Which was a million pants moving.

02:48.000 --> 02:53.000
In addition, PlayStation 4 disc-based games don't need to be connected online to play.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
Or for any type of authentication.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
If you enjoy playing single-player games offline, PS4 won't require you to check in online periodically.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
And it won't stop working if you haven't authenticated within 24 hours.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Sick burn.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Bam.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
In the jugular.

03:32.000 --> 03:38.000
That was huge because that was a direct target response to Microsoft right there.

03:38.000 --> 03:46.000
In the 11 years I've been looking at the modern E3, when I say modern E3, I mean like when we've been able to watch the streaming things and all this.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
And the show is turning 11 next week.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
And all the years I've been watching E3 that closely, I have never seen anything like that.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
Where one company systematically takes down the policies of another.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Like, not since the...

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
I mean, I remember back in the Sega Nintendo days, things would get ugly.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
You know, Genesis does, Nintendo don't.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
And even the turbo graphics, you know.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Blast processing.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Does all this stuff.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
I mean, like, you know, they used to be at each other's throats a lot more.

04:08.000 --> 04:14.000
Not saying that in the modern era it's been civil, but everybody kind of stays off each other's toes.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
This...

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
This was huge.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
And then...

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
And then they're like, oh hey, you like this cake right here?

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
Well then I got some icing for you too.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
That's right, we're only gonna be $3.99.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
Dear Microsoft, these are your cornflakes. Watch as we piss in them.

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
So, like many of you out there, Dark Soccer and I were watching this together.

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
And honestly, during this part of the press conference, my jaw's on the floor because I did not expect...

04:40.000 --> 04:46.000
Well, like many of you, and we even said it on the show last week, we expected Sony to go down a similar path.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Never in my life have I been happier to be wrong.

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
I think I go on record saying that I didn't think that...

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
Don't make me dig up the archive of last week's show.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
I said I wasn't sure, but I didn't think they would.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Well, it is what it is.

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
They didn't go down that same path, and many would say they won E3 because of it.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
And never mind the negatives in Sony's press conference.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
I'm not trying to sound like a fanboy here.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
I will get to some of the positives of Microsoft's in a minute here, because yes, I do believe there are some positives.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
But as far as the Sony things go, never mind the whole...

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
By the way, PlayStation Plus, yeah, is the only way you're going to be able to play online multiplayer now.

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
I mean, it's glossed right by that. Nobody cares because they squashed the other thing.

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
Never mind barely a wink and a nod to the PlayStation Vita.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
It's the place for indie developers to be at.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
But no price cut to announce, nothing really else to announce this time.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
Never mind that whole thing.

05:42.000 --> 05:51.000
You know, Sony addressed the things that the people on the internet really wanted to hear the most about, and got everybody talking because of it.

05:51.000 --> 06:00.000
And actually what's kind of funny is I think, if I remember correctly, in between the whole talking about their policies and stuff like that, and the price point, wasn't there like,

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
Oh, by the way, here's Final Fantasy XV. Oh, and Kingdom Hearts III. You know, that type of thing.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.000
Yeah, and going to our chat room, I always have to acknowledge the live folks.

06:08.000 --> 06:16.000
We do tape live every Sunday night, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice Geeks Network, voggenetwork.com.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
We have our live chatters, Shadownextgen in chat saying,

06:19.000 --> 06:24.000
Sony did a masterful job of misleading people in that conference. I give Sony PR a huge amount of credit.

06:24.000 --> 06:29.000
Yeah, things like Kingdom Hearts III, Final Fantasy XV, again, Jaws on the floor.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
Those weren't exclusive games. We all know that now.

06:32.000 --> 06:40.000
And they never said they were exclusive games, but now we associate that with PlayStation 4, because those guys were on stage at the Sony press conference.

06:40.000 --> 06:46.000
And there's many, I think there are many people that are like, where they were meant to be played.

06:46.000 --> 06:55.000
Well, and in PlayStation Plus too is, you know, Rocio was saying $5 a month. It's actually cheaper than that, because it's $40, or $50 a year.

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
So, it's even cheaper than Xbox Live Gold.

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
Which, what would $50 get you on Gold?

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
It's about the same. It's close. It's about the same.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
How much is Gold per month? I thought it was more than that.

07:10.000 --> 07:16.000
To be fair, Microsoft tried to raise the bar at their own press conference by saying, we're going to start giving away games with an Xbox Gold subscription.

07:16.000 --> 07:24.000
Fable 3 is already up, and then they announced, what, Halo 3 and Assassin's Creed 2, which I know a lot of you guys are like, snore, I already own those games.

07:24.000 --> 07:30.000
Here's the thing, though, and it's only up until the Xbox One launches, though, not afterwards. So, it's kind of lame.

07:30.000 --> 07:40.000
I mean, it's cool if you're buying a 360 for, like, Grand Theft Auto 5 or something like that, and you get your one month free of Gold, and you can go download all these extra games. I mean, that's kind of cool.

07:41.000 --> 07:56.000
Here's the thing, too, is that what a way Sony has come from 2006, when they were the laughing stock of E3, right? Remember, $599 US dollars? Attack the crab's weak point for massive damage.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
They did make a joke about that.

07:58.000 --> 08:07.000
Oh, yeah, then the guy had that joke about that. And then, what does Sony do in their press conference? Attack Microsoft's weak points for massive damage. Literally. That's what happened.

08:07.000 --> 08:16.000
Yeah, I mean, I seriously thought when they announced that the price point was $499, you know, when Microsoft did that, it was kind of like, oh, here's Sony's press conference all over again, you know?

08:16.000 --> 08:34.000
And the biggest thing that really, in my opinion, even bigger than the press conference, sticking it to Microsoft, was that YouTube that instantly showed up, floating around with the two guys, what, Yoshida and the other guy from PlayStation, doing the tutorial on how to share used games.

08:34.000 --> 08:43.000
I don't see shade like that thrown outside of an episode of RuPaul's Drag Race. That was some massive shade on Sony's part. Bravo.

08:43.000 --> 08:50.000
Well, and then, of course, you know, it immediately was turned into a series of animated gifs for the internet.

08:50.000 --> 08:58.000
Oh, I'm sorry, just Tumblr has been hilarious all week, all because of seeing everything being repeated.

08:58.000 --> 09:10.000
Let's go back to Microsoft for a minute. Can anyone here at the table think about some positive, before we get into where did Microsoft screw up, let's get into some positives from Microsoft's press conference. What do you think are some positives out of this whole thing?

09:10.000 --> 09:27.000
They had some good games to show off. There are some exclusive games that look kind of cool, like, was it Sunset Overdrive looked pretty awesome. I mean, that looks like a pretty, it's basically, hey, this is the game right here that was supposed to be Fuse, but, you know, Fuse ended up being some generic third-person shooter.

09:27.000 --> 09:42.000
Now, this is the game that, you know, I guess, not Fuse, it was Overstrike, I think what it was. So, it was supposed to be Overstrike, but now it's this game, and it looks pretty sweet.

09:42.000 --> 09:58.000
It's like this very stylized, it reminded me a lot of that Unreal 4 demo, or I guess it's not demo, the actual game, Unreal 4 game, Fortnite, kind of reminded me of that, you know, versus, like, zombies and stuff, but very, you know, stylized.

09:59.000 --> 10:10.000
So, that looked cool. Dead Rising 3, I guess, looks alright. I'm not a huge fan of the shift in tone in the game to more serious. It's kind of, eh.

10:12.000 --> 10:23.000
I guess Mirror's Edge, but that wasn't necessarily at their conference, that was more of EA's, but Mirror's Edge, you know, looks awesome.

10:24.000 --> 10:37.000
And then, not really actually even part of their conference at all, but more clarification on their policy stuff, that 10 friend-sharing thing, where you can have different circles of friends, and basically, you know, I buy a copy of, like, 4 is a 5 or something like that,

10:37.000 --> 10:46.000
and I can play the game at the same time as one of my friends can play the game off of my library that I'm sharing. So, that's kind of cool, in that you can share a bunch of games, but at the same time, it's like,

10:47.000 --> 11:04.000
I thought the whole reason that you're having this stuff where you can't, you know, sell used, you know, easily, is to prevent used sales, but the same, you're basically encouraging people not to buy games, because you can just play, you know, if you have a thousand friends, each one has a library shared with you,

11:05.000 --> 11:20.000
you know, say you have 10 friends, and they have, you know, we're all sharing library of games, you know, or you have 10 different rings or circles or whatever, friends, you could basically be playing, like, all these games without having to buy them, you know, I don't know, it's kind of a weird strategy.

11:20.000 --> 11:31.000
I'm gonna say something nice about Microsoft that I actually might get a little bit of shit for, because I'm sure not everybody will agree with me, but I actually thought overall their exclusives looked better than the PlayStation 4 exclusives,

11:31.000 --> 11:42.000
yet I walked out of there still pre-ordering a PlayStation 4, because I think the third-party stuff that is on both systems, combined with everything we already got into last week about what I don't like about Microsoft's DRM.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
But what was exclusive, though, that they were showing off?

11:44.000 --> 11:59.000
On Microsoft, Killer Instinct, which I realize is getting its own bit, but I'm interested enough. Quantum Break looked great. The game that you just checked, the Sunset Overdrive looks really good.

11:59.000 --> 12:06.000
Halo 5, I know not everybody's into first-person shooters, but I do like Halo games, so I'm here for Halo.

12:07.000 --> 12:13.000
And there was one other one that's escaping me right now. Oh, the Crimson Dragon, the Panzer Dragoon sequel that they basically...

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Quiet Dragon.

12:14.000 --> 12:22.000
The one that they went back and just basically redid for Xbox One that they had announced at a previous press conference. I mean, there was a lot of good exclusives, whereas I look at Sony and I go,

12:23.000 --> 12:31.000
I'm not really into Infamous, and they all look okay. I'll play them, but I'm not as excited as I was for maybe the Xbox One exclusives.

12:31.000 --> 12:42.000
But what's really selling me is A, the fact that I will own my games on Sony and that whole takedown, and B, the third-party stuff is what I'm really here for,

12:42.000 --> 12:47.000
the Kingdom Hearts and a lot of this other stuff that is going to end up being on both consoles.

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
Final Fantasy XIV, I'll probably end up picking up on PlayStation 4 and so on and so on.

12:52.000 --> 13:02.000
So, let's talk about... Well, actually, I want to say two. I don't think the $4.99 price is as bad as everyone's making it out to be.

13:02.000 --> 13:17.000
Granted, Sony stuck it to them with the $3.99 price. I think they had a huge advantage by going second, that they probably had three or four PowerPoint slides ready to go with whatever would undercut Microsoft.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
And that's what they pulled out of their hat.

13:19.000 --> 13:30.000
I think also that the really big negative is that whole thing with it listening, especially with the whole NSA scandal going out right about now.

13:30.000 --> 13:36.000
Absolutely. We did touch on that a little bit last week, which still hasn't really been resolved. Loki?

13:36.000 --> 13:45.000
Well, I was going to say the one thing, speaking of having Kinect 2.0 or whatever bundled with the system, they didn't really show me any reason.

13:45.000 --> 13:52.000
In fact, they pretty much didn't show any games that utilized Kinect. I don't know if they had a trailer for Fantasia during their conference,

13:52.000 --> 14:00.000
but even the games that were supposed to be for Kinect originally, Rise, for example, is now a regular controlled game.

14:00.000 --> 14:06.000
That Crimson Dragon game, supposed to be a Kinect game, now it's just uses a regular controller.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
It's like all these games now are sidestepping the use of Kinect, yet they're saying,

14:10.000 --> 14:17.000
This is integral. You need to have Kinect in there for what reason? You're not using it in any of these games in a meaningful way.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
That's my problem with it.

14:19.000 --> 14:26.000
Let's talk about where Microsoft fucked up, because there's a couple key points that really is just fucking them up.

14:26.000 --> 14:30.000
And it's not even just the DRM thing. I mean, obviously that's one of them.

14:30.000 --> 14:38.000
But I think the big thing with that is that Microsoft honestly thinks they're trying to be progressive with this.

14:38.000 --> 14:43.000
There was a really great interview that came out about this, and the interview was with Phil Spencer,

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
who I think kind of knows a little better how to talk to the media and so forth.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
And he talks about this. He says, quote,

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
You want your library to move with you. You want your friends list to move with you.

14:52.000 --> 14:58.000
We think the investment in live that we've made over the last eight years has been really important to growing that capability.

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
And when you think your gaming library, associated with your identity, is an incredibly important thing,

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
we're going through that transition right now, and gamers will come along.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
Any other device that you own, your library is digital.

15:09.000 --> 15:15.000
Frankly, if you're on the PC or a Steam customer or an App Store customer on iOS devices,

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
this is how you think about your library of content.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
That's mistake number one Microsoft made.

15:20.000 --> 15:26.000
They believe their competition with this device is Apple, which is fair.

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
Apple's a huge dominating thing. Everybody wants a piece of that. Somebody wants to take them down.

15:30.000 --> 15:35.000
But while Microsoft had their eyes on Apple, and we're going to copy all these things people do,

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
because people eat this Apple shit up.

15:38.000 --> 15:44.000
While Microsoft had their eyes fixated on that, they failed to recognize what was coming up right behind them.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
Why did they fail to recognize what was coming up right behind them?

15:46.000 --> 15:53.000
Because my digital library of Xbox Live Arcade games is unable to move with me to the next system.

15:53.000 --> 15:58.000
It's stuck behind. Same with my current library of games. I can't move with the new system.

15:58.000 --> 16:04.000
Whereas on the PlayStation 4, once the Gaikai service launches, I will be able to move with my digital purchases.

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
Or at least some of them, and it will probably slowly roll out.

16:08.000 --> 16:15.000
Here's the other problem, and I believe this to be a way bigger deal than some of you may think,

16:15.000 --> 16:20.000
but I think Microsoft made a huge mistake getting rid of all their community outreach people,

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
which they did some time ago.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
Remember when they got rid of all the people that were doing the Xbox TV thing,

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
and they got rid of the Gamerscore blog, and they got rid of a lot of their community outreach people?

16:29.000 --> 16:33.000
Oops. Microsoft forgot how to talk to the community.

16:33.000 --> 16:38.000
Hence the embarrassment that's now on par with Sony's 2006 press conference,

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
when they forgot how to talk to the community.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
Luckily, Sony's got their mojo back. Maybe Microsoft will get it back in a couple years.

16:44.000 --> 16:48.000
But they screwed up with that. They don't know how to talk.

16:48.000 --> 16:53.000
Again, this is all boardroom decisions. This is what gamers want.

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
Gamers want iOS functionality in their console.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Hey, you have shitty internet?

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
iOS games are also 99 cents. Sorry, Loki.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
And if you have shitty internet, you buy a 360.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
That's our option for you, because the Xbox One needs to be connected.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Or if you're in another country.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
Yes, or another country. Here's the other great thing about that, too.

17:13.000 --> 17:18.000
He was like, well, you have to understand, you know, you're not going to buy a cell phone if you don't have cell service.

17:19.000 --> 17:28.000
The problem is, your device, it's not a device that, like, I don't buy internet so that my game console works.

17:28.000 --> 17:33.000
You know, a phone, you buy to access the phone network.

17:33.000 --> 17:39.000
This is a, you know, internet's used for your PC, for TV stuff, for your phone, for whatever.

17:39.000 --> 17:45.000
It's a multi, I mean, it's like saying, well, you don't, you know, it's like plugging into the wall and getting power for stuff.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
It's not just for one thing.

17:48.000 --> 17:55.000
So, saying that, oh, well, you know, perhaps if you have terrible internet, then you guess you don't need this new console.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
I just think it's kind of dumb to limit themselves like that.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
And many other ways that they're limiting themselves.

18:01.000 --> 18:07.000
Also, he comes out and sounds like a complete, or I forget who it was, Phil Spencer, I think, comes out and sounds like a complete jackass.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
You know, when he's like, I don't even know.

18:09.000 --> 18:16.000
You know, he was talking about like, you know, oh, you know, someone was telling me that their friend works on a, you know, nuclear sub and stuff.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
I don't even know what that means.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Actually, I was going to bring that up next.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
That was a huge faux pas on Microsoft's part.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
That was Don Mattrick actually that said that.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Don Mattrick, my man.

18:24.000 --> 18:32.000
And I predict he will be replaced within 365 days because somebody's going to take the fall for this crap and it's going to be him.

18:33.000 --> 18:38.000
He will be replaced within 365 days because somebody's going to take the fall for this and it's going to be him.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
And I'm sorry, Xbox fanboys.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
I know there's many of you saying, oh, it could still win.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
They could still win the holiday season.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
I honestly don't think so.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
They've already lost the holidays.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
It's too late to reverse course.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Corporations don't know how to talk off script.

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
It's going to take a miracle for Microsoft to pull out the holiday at this point.

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
Xbox fans, your biggest sticking point right now, honestly.

18:59.000 --> 19:06.000
A, ask a Nintendo fan how to deal with six months of bullshit coming from the internet because, you know, you can take comfort with them.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
But we'll get to Nintendo in a minute.

19:08.000 --> 19:17.000
And B, stick to the exclusives because that's the big thing that Microsoft has going for it right now is that you won't be able to play a lot of that stuff.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
Halo 5 is huge and you won't be able to play it anymore.

19:19.000 --> 19:23.000
Well, on top of that, too, like, you know, these retailers or whatever.

19:23.000 --> 19:32.000
Now that Sony is not following suit with the Xbox One, guess where they're pushing the customers that are preordering stuff.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Where their bigger margins are.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
PlayStation 4.

19:35.000 --> 19:39.000
So you have that working against them as well.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Unless, you know, they change their mind.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
But I think even a lot of people are like saying, hey, you know what?

19:44.000 --> 19:52.000
Even if they change their mind and, you know, you know, reverse their decision on this stuff, I'm still not going to support them because they took this stance in the first place.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
And what kind of bullshit are they trying to put us through?

19:55.000 --> 19:59.000
Shadow Next Gen in chat says the Internet is a vocal minority.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
They don't matter in the grand scheme of things.

20:01.000 --> 20:06.000
Okay, let's talk about my coworkers who have already decided they won't be buying an Xbox One.

20:06.000 --> 20:19.000
Or the random employee at Disneyland that saw we were coming from E3 that was talking to my friend and I about stuff and how he's been an Xbox fanboy all this time and does not plan to get an Xbox One.

20:19.000 --> 20:25.000
The Internet may be a vocal minority, but the little ripple starts here and the tidal wave can crash.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
Or relatives of mine who all they do is play Farmville, but they saw enough.

20:28.000 --> 20:32.000
The Internet is really not the minority you like to think it is.

20:32.000 --> 20:42.000
You may have more vocal people in the minority, but the majority of people who are in the consumer market are going to have access to the Internet and see this information.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
End of story.

20:43.000 --> 20:48.000
And here's something that came from one of those stupid courses.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
I'm sorry, I hate to say this, Rob, because I know this is what you do.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
But you know those little team building courses that you do at work?

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
One of them was called being an advocate.

20:57.000 --> 21:04.000
And for every one person that complains, there are eight other people who do not.

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
Who still have that same opinion, who will be swayed by the one that complains.

21:08.000 --> 21:18.000
And then RossDielUT in our chat room even points out, and I was going to bring this up, but this shit even got on Rachel Maddow's blog, who was bashing the fact that...

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
I love her.

21:19.000 --> 21:32.000
Well, despite however you feel about her with politics and everything, the fact that she is working for MSNBC, her show is on MSNBC, and she's basically bashing what was said about the whole fact that you won't be able to play it on a nuclear submarine.

21:32.000 --> 21:37.000
And the whole fact that basically the Xbox is giving the finger to the military and all this stuff.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
I mean, that was a huge faux pas.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
And don't forget about the other jokes.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
Yeah.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
Alright.

21:43.000 --> 21:54.000
One other thing I want to bring up that is a key failure on Microsoft's part, and if Microsoft can pull out the holiday, this is the only way they're going to be able to do it.

21:54.000 --> 21:58.000
And that is the fact that the Xbox One is married to Kinect.

21:58.000 --> 22:09.000
And it says a lot when not a single game at that press conference, not one of them, used Kinect.

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
I know there were some on the show floor with Just Dance 2014 and the Fantasia game.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
And some of the games that they did show did support it, but it wasn't shown.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
Exactly.

22:17.000 --> 22:23.000
So what's the big fucking deal about Kinect, and why is there going to be one force included with every single system?

22:23.000 --> 22:31.000
Because I'll bet you the way that PlayStation got the price of their console down to $399 is A, they're going to shaft you on memory storage, B...

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
500 gigabytes on the hard drive.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
On the $399 version?

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
Yep.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
There is only one version.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
It's $399.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
Really?

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
They're not going to try to put out a $499?

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
Nope.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
Wow.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
Okay, color me surprised.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
But they definitely are not including the PlayStation Eye and stuff.

22:46.000 --> 22:52.000
And on top of that, it is upgradeable, just like the PlayStation 3.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
But the Eye and all that stuff, nowhere to be seen.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
Eye is $60.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
Separate.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
Yeah.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
Even so, that's not enough to bump it up a whole hundred bucks.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
Yeah.

23:01.000 --> 23:09.000
So I think the only way that Microsoft is going to be able, especially with all this negative perception Kinect has right now in the backlash,

23:09.000 --> 23:17.000
I really think the only way Microsoft is going to be able to pull the holidays out is to drop the price of the console a hundred bucks, detach itself from Kinect.

23:17.000 --> 23:23.000
And now we can have a debate about are the exclusives worth the DRM restrictions and yada, yada, yada.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
I still don't know that that's going to be enough.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
For me, it still won't be, honestly.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
But you never know.

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
I mean, I think the internet is speaking loud and clear.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
The gamer fan base is upset.

23:34.000 --> 23:40.000
I don't think a corporation like Microsoft can move fast enough, but we'll see.

23:40.000 --> 23:46.000
Well, and on top of that, just in the general way they've disrespected their user base,

23:46.000 --> 23:52.000
I wouldn't give them my money until I could buy one second hand that would assure that they wouldn't get that money.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
And on top of that, a lot of the stuff that they were-

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
Might be a bit much.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
Well, you know what? No, I do that stuff. You know me.

23:57.000 --> 24:03.000
There were some games that they showed that were Xbox exclusive, and I'm not just talking about Xbox One,

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
both Xbox One and Xbox 360.

24:05.000 --> 24:10.000
Like, for example, the new Plants vs. Zombies game, which looks pretty sweet.

24:10.000 --> 24:14.000
Whatever. You know what? I don't care. It looks fantastic.

24:14.000 --> 24:19.000
And so that'll be one I want to pick up on Xbox 360 when it comes out later on.

24:19.000 --> 24:24.000
And Titanfall was another one that was, I think, Xbox One, Xbox 360 exclusive.

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
Hell, I have a 360. I'm going to be gaming on it for a long time, credit without a five.

24:28.000 --> 24:35.000
So I'm not worried about all these games coming out that, you know, may be only on the Xbox platforms,

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
because I have an Xbox platform. I'm just, you know-

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
I just- I'm not going to buy two next-gen consoles.

24:41.000 --> 24:48.000
And not necessarily because I just don't like- I mean, I don't really like the policies that they have with Xbox One,

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
but I can't afford two consoles right now like that.

24:50.000 --> 24:57.000
And I did- I bought all three this generation, and I play one of the three, so I'm not going to throw away my money like that.

24:57.000 --> 25:02.000
Just buy one, and then when they drop their price and release a Grand Theft Auto 6 or something like that,

25:02.000 --> 25:06.000
that's exclusive to Xbox One, which will never happen, but then we can talk about it.

25:06.000 --> 25:10.000
BloodJunk makes a good point that Titanfall is also on PC.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Yeah, but my laptop can't run that.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
But my computer can.

25:14.000 --> 25:17.000
Before we get into our gaming weeks and covering the rest of the news tonight,

25:17.000 --> 25:22.000
and ultimately getting to your calls at 1877 Game OLR and your further chat comments and so forth,

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
I don't- we've been very focused on Microsoft versus Sony, as a lot of people have.

25:25.000 --> 25:29.000
I don't want to ignore Nintendo, because obviously, you know, that's a console too,

25:29.000 --> 25:33.000
and they had their own set of expectations going into E3.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
How did we all feel about Nintendo?

25:35.000 --> 25:39.000
I'll start with Nintendo's biggest critic in the room. Loki, how did you feel about what Nintendo-

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
There was nothing surprising from them.

25:41.000 --> 25:45.000
Honestly, because all the stuff that we knew was coming, they basically announced.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
There wasn't anything like, oh, hey, I didn't see that.

25:47.000 --> 25:51.000
Okay, the only game I didn't know that was coming was a new Donkey Kong game,

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
and I was like, poof, who cares?

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
You know, we just had a Donkey Kong game come out.

25:55.000 --> 25:59.000
I don't really care. This looks exactly like the other one, except, oh, now we go and it's 3D,

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
and it goes into the background, and then who gives a shit?

26:01.000 --> 26:06.000
Mario Kart 8 looks nice, and, you know, the gimmick of, you know, the gravity thing looks cool,

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
and there's going to be some interesting tracks, but it doesn't look like it plays that different,

26:09.000 --> 26:14.000
so I'm not too excited about that, and usually Mario Kart sells me systems.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
I mean, I bought all the other Nintendo systems from Mario Kart,

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
but I just don't really care anymore about it.

26:20.000 --> 26:24.000
Smash Brothers looked kind of cool, and some of the new characters that they're announcing are kind of,

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
it's neat, I like how they're going with that.

26:27.000 --> 26:34.000
Bayonetta 2 just kind of, it was all right, but when's that coming out? No idea.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
Well, 2014, but that could be Christmas 2014.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
Originally, it was supposed to be 2013, so I don't know.

26:41.000 --> 26:46.000
Zelda Wind Waker HD just doesn't look like they've really done a lot to it.

26:46.000 --> 26:50.000
They didn't really add anything to it, other than, you know, now you can travel the seas faster.

26:50.000 --> 26:54.000
Well, and that Accel Shaded game looks a lot better on HD, but, you know.

26:54.000 --> 27:01.000
I'm still disappointed, though, that a system that plays Wii games isn't able to up-res those things.

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
Yeah, here's the thing about Nintendo for me.

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
You know, I'm a Wii U owner, and originally when I walked away from the Nintendo Direct,

27:08.000 --> 27:16.000
which was a mess in itself to watch, and I hope to hell Nintendo just streams with another partner next year,

27:16.000 --> 27:19.000
because the Ustream thing was embarrassing, how horrible that was to watch.

27:19.000 --> 27:23.000
But anyway, all that aside, when you really kind of looked at the news itself,

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
a lot of it was just kind of par.

27:25.000 --> 27:29.000
You know, I'm not like, I wasn't like, woo, Nintendo, like super excited.

27:29.000 --> 27:35.000
I mean, certainly the couple games that I was excited about, I'm really excited about.

27:35.000 --> 27:42.000
Mario Kart 8 looks killer. The new Mario 3D World, which, I don't get the 3D, not on a 3DS.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
But whatever, okay, whatever.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
And Cats.

27:44.000 --> 27:49.000
I forgive it, because it's got the floating princess and Luigi legs again, whatever. And Cats.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
And X looked good.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
Yeah, and so, you know, yeah, that's all stuff that's cool.

27:53.000 --> 27:57.000
And then I was kind of like, that's a lot of 2014 stuff.

27:57.000 --> 28:01.000
That's the thing that kind of concerned me about it, is that it's not that the games don't look good,

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
because they all do look really good, and, you know, hey, it's Nintendo.

28:03.000 --> 28:09.000
But I was kind of like, man, I kind of wanted Nintendo to really have a come-from-behind holiday,

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
and they're going to really kick some butt this holiday season.

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
And I'm kind of like, maybe they'll kick butt in 2014,

28:14.000 --> 28:17.000
because they didn't announce a price drop or anything to really move those consoles this season.

28:17.000 --> 28:22.000
They have the same fucking lineup they had, well, two years ago with the 3DS.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
A new Mario 3D Land and Mario Kart.

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
It's seriously, they're just repeating the steps.

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
So what, are we going to get a price drop? Same strategy as the 3DS.

28:30.000 --> 28:34.000
But those games are enough to make me want to go out and buy a Wii U, assuming I had the funds for it.

28:34.000 --> 28:38.000
Wait a second, that's actually exactly their strategy, because there's also another new Mario,

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
or, I'm sorry, new Luigi U game in August.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
Smash Brothers.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Yeah, but Smash Brothers is not until 2014.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
Yeah, but I don't care, that makes me want a Wii U.

28:45.000 --> 28:51.000
It's literally the exact same lineup as, like, 2011 for the 3DS on the Wii U.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
It's, like, exactly.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
And this is my I don't care face, I want one.

28:54.000 --> 28:58.000
I didn't get to finish my thought completely, and now people in chat are like, Rob, you're wrong.

28:58.000 --> 29:04.000
The thing is, is that even if Nintendo chooses not to drop the price of their console,

29:04.000 --> 29:07.000
which I don't think is the smartest decision, but okay, if they don't do it,

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
there's still the cheapest option out there at the holiday season.

29:10.000 --> 29:17.000
And I think there are a lot of families that aren't informed on this whole Microsoft versus Sony thing,

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
and are simply going to go for the cheapest option that the thing is for their kids.

29:20.000 --> 29:24.000
Because, you know, yes, the Mario games are going to speak to certain people and so forth.

29:25.000 --> 29:32.000
But, this is where I'm torn, because that argument should have worked last year.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
See, that's my problem.

29:34.000 --> 29:38.000
We had a Mario game last year, and the console still didn't sell.

29:38.000 --> 29:43.000
Okay, so we have a couple more this year, but we don't have anything else to really push it.

29:43.000 --> 29:49.000
So you're just telling me that more of the same is going to move more consoles.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
I'm not, I mean, I'm skeptical.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
And I'm not rooting against Nintendo.

29:54.000 --> 29:58.000
I really hate that all these publishers are abandoning Nintendo.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
I think they're being dicks about it.

30:00.000 --> 30:05.000
But, I want to see Nintendo do better, but I just kind of, I feel like,

30:05.000 --> 30:10.000
I didn't really get it from them how they're going to light a fire under the Wii U.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
That's what was frustrating for me.

30:17.000 --> 30:21.000
Let's see, going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
FrosteelUT says, Rob, Nintendo had a good holiday season.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
The problem is that after holiday it was dead.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
Well, I mean, that's a problem.

30:29.000 --> 30:34.000
And I would argue it didn't have a holiday season like Wii's or Xbox 360's when it launched.

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
It had a pretty decent launch, but the thing was that,

30:37.000 --> 30:41.000
yeah, there were no games for like three months after it came out,

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
and a lot of them were ports of older games.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
And we could very well see that kind of line up,

30:46.000 --> 30:49.000
although they're going to have Wii Fit U, big deal.

30:49.000 --> 30:55.000
And I don't even know what they're going to have for the first quarter of 2014.

30:55.000 --> 30:59.000
So, yeah, there is a lot of stuff that, who knows where this is,

30:59.000 --> 31:00.000
they're going to be coming out.

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
Koopakit Jeremy in chat says, third party games would sell more

31:03.000 --> 31:06.000
if they took the time to make the games comparable to PlayStation 3 and 360.

31:06.000 --> 31:10.000
Injustice is a good example. No DLC for Wii U owners.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
Actually, Mass Effect 3 was the same way.

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
Yeah, something's up there.

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
Like, is something fucked up with Nintendo Network

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
where DLC isn't as easy to do or something,

31:20.000 --> 31:24.000
because why do we keep seeing these subpar games that, you know,

31:24.000 --> 31:29.000
they launch and it's eh, and then they're like piss poorly supported after launch?

31:29.000 --> 31:33.000
Mass Effect 3 is a great example. It's not a better experience on Wii U.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
It had nothing to carry over on top of that.

31:35.000 --> 31:40.000
All the things that made playing 3 actually kind of mildly worthwhile

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
was carrying over your previous game data,

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
and it didn't even have a good version to do that.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
Anyway, I want to move on to the other stories and so forth,

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
but I do want to say, like, on a positive note for Nintendo,

31:49.000 --> 31:52.000
I think one other thing to keep in mind when I'm talking about that,

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
you know, I'm not seeing enough or whatever.

31:54.000 --> 31:58.000
One thing that should be noted is that one thing Nintendo has been doing right

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
is that they're doing more of those Nintendo directs,

32:00.000 --> 32:05.000
and they did already put out some surprises that would usually be an E3 thing, right?

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
The Zelda 3D on 3DS and so forth.

32:08.000 --> 32:12.000
3DS fucking rules right now. Like, as far as handhelds go,

32:12.000 --> 32:17.000
I mean, PlayStation is phoning in the Vita, 3DS is Amazeballs,

32:17.000 --> 32:21.000
Animal Crossing, Zelda, Smash Brothers.

32:21.000 --> 32:25.000
I mean, 3DS is fucking where it's at for handhelds right now if you're, like, a gamer.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
Like, that's one thing Nintendo ain't doing wrong.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
It just took them a long time to get there.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
But, you know, a lot of that stuff kind of came out before,

32:32.000 --> 32:37.000
so I'm hoping that maybe there's another Nintendo Direct in a month

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
that has some other stuff to get us excited.

32:39.000 --> 32:43.000
I know there's some news coming up later that maybe Nintendo hasn't played all their cards right now,

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
so that will be interesting to see play out.

32:47.000 --> 32:54.000
All right. Any other thoughts on the big three before we get into our gaming weeks quickly and gaming news and all that?

32:55.000 --> 33:01.000
Ubisoft. Like always, Ubisoft had a lot of cool stuff to show at their press conference,

33:01.000 --> 33:06.000
and I always kind of think that, you know, being able to take E3 each year,

33:06.000 --> 33:10.000
they showed off, what was it, The Crew, which looked pretty awesome,

33:10.000 --> 33:14.000
like an open world burnout type game, which is pretty sweet,

33:14.000 --> 33:18.000
and then they also had the new Tom Clancy game, Division,

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
or The Division, that looked pretty cool as well,

33:20.000 --> 33:24.000
like that MMO that ties in with, like, the iPad and stuff.

33:24.000 --> 33:27.000
So I thought that was really cool and want to check that out.

33:27.000 --> 33:31.000
Those games actually kind of seem like, okay, here's how we're going to use Next Gen.

33:31.000 --> 33:41.000
They kind of showed that versus Rise, which is like, cool, you made a knockoff of God of War. Awesome.

33:43.000 --> 33:48.000
Before we get into gaming weeks, let me ask this question with my big slash troll face,

33:48.000 --> 33:53.000
because this is definitely the question that cynical gamers everywhere are asking.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
I can't make a troll face. I tried.

33:55.000 --> 34:01.000
What do you think will sell more this holiday season, the Xbox One or the Wii U?

34:01.000 --> 34:06.000
What will sell more this holiday season, the Xbox One or the Wii U?

34:06.000 --> 34:13.000
If everybody had my brain, it would be the Wii U, but not everybody is an intelligent shopper.

34:13.000 --> 34:19.000
So I still pretty much think the Wii U is going to be a better seller.

34:19.000 --> 34:23.000
It's a tough question to ask or answer, just because not all the data is there,

34:23.000 --> 34:26.000
because there's also rumors that they're having trouble with chip yields.

34:26.000 --> 34:30.000
So you may end up with a shortage problem at launch.

34:30.000 --> 34:36.000
So, you know, to be honest, I think that the Xbox One will sell more than the Wii U.

34:36.000 --> 34:42.000
And why is that? Because you think something is, oh, but not PlayStation 4?

34:42.000 --> 34:45.000
PlayStation 4 will outsell both, all of them.

34:45.000 --> 34:51.000
I think, if anything, you can still have Xbox 360 selling more than the Xbox One,

34:51.000 --> 34:56.000
and probably the Wii U as well, just because, granted, that's out of five.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
No, they have a lot of exclusives for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

34:59.000 --> 35:04.000
And honestly, I don't see Wii U as next-gen. I'm sorry.

35:04.000 --> 35:09.000
It's still, graphically and performance-wise, it's on par with PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

35:09.000 --> 35:15.000
So it's just like, I don't know, in-between-gen or something, whatever you want to call it.

35:15.000 --> 35:22.000
I'm going to say Wii U sells more this holiday season because of households with children under 12,

35:22.000 --> 35:26.000
and the parents that will have the fond memories of Nintendo and so forth.

35:26.000 --> 35:30.000
And I think a lot of the hardcore gamers, I think a lot of them are going Sony.

35:30.000 --> 35:33.000
Sorry, Xbox fans, but what's that?

35:33.000 --> 35:39.000
But it doesn't really matter, though, because they don't need to buy a new system, though,

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
for these games that they're wanting to play.

35:41.000 --> 35:46.000
Everyone eats up Skylanders, and everybody is probably going to eat up Disney Infinity.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Those are both on Wii.

35:48.000 --> 35:55.000
You're going to have, I don't know, it's another Mario game.

35:55.000 --> 35:58.000
I mean, how many Mario games are we going to have come out already?

35:58.000 --> 36:04.000
I don't think it's that amazing that 3D Land is coming out.

36:04.000 --> 36:08.000
It looks kind of like a slightly better version of the 3DS one,

36:08.000 --> 36:11.000
and that's not a big, once again, not a big deal for me,

36:11.000 --> 36:14.000
because that was just like New Super Mario Brothers U.

36:14.000 --> 36:21.000
But here's the big reason, the other big reason why I think Wii U is going to go over better than Xbox One,

36:21.000 --> 36:25.000
and it's like you were saying, but this is apart from brand recognition,

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
you also do have a known quantity.

36:28.000 --> 36:34.000
Whereas they are making so many different changes with the X-Bone

36:34.000 --> 36:41.000
that I think that a lot of people are going to go towards something that they, as a consumer, can put more trust in.

36:41.000 --> 36:45.000
Well, let's see what the listeners think.

36:45.000 --> 36:50.000
Live.vognetwork.com and answer this live poll right now.

36:50.000 --> 36:53.000
What will sell more this holiday season?

36:53.000 --> 36:56.000
Your options are Wii U or Xbox One.

36:56.000 --> 36:59.000
Asking the questions of cynical gamers everywhere.

36:59.000 --> 37:04.000
What's going to sell out of the two underdogs going into this holiday?

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
Dreamcast.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
Wii U or Xbox One.

37:07.000 --> 37:11.000
Registered participants can vote on the site at live.vognetwork.com.

37:11.000 --> 37:15.000
If you're not a registered participant, you should do so, because it's free and we won't spam you.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
Super promise.

37:17.000 --> 37:21.000
Yeah, like I was saying, I don't hate Nintendo first party games,

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
but I just don't think any of them are system sellers.

37:23.000 --> 37:30.000
Like for example, if instead of the remake of Wind Waker, they had a brand new next gen Zelda game,

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
yeah, that might be something to sell people on the system.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
But a game that's basically an upgrade of a 3DS game,

37:36.000 --> 37:42.000
I don't think that it didn't really work too well for New Super Mario Brothers U,

37:42.000 --> 37:45.000
and I don't think it's going to work too well for New Luigi U.

37:45.000 --> 37:51.000
So why is a third Mario game that's just a platformer that doesn't really seem that different from what's already out there,

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
I don't think that's going to be a system seller, that's the thing.

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
Mario Kart or anything? It's Mario Kart.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
No 3DO Ikuma JP.

37:58.000 --> 38:03.000
Alright, we will get to the results of our live poll right after our gaming weeks.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
Let's try to keep them a little bit shorter tonight because we had a lot of E3 talk,

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
but Dark Soccer, what have you been tapped into this week?

38:08.000 --> 38:12.000
Well, we busted out the Atari 5200 for Atari Party coming up, getting everything working.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
So there was some Panko going on in my house, Rob.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.000
Nice.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
Thought you would have liked it.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
Loves it.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
And Super Pac-Man.

38:19.000 --> 38:22.000
We have Millipede because we have some prototype re-releases.

38:22.000 --> 38:28.000
I could not play Mass Effect 3 because I've been in the middle of upgrading all of my graphics in it so that it looks even more gorgeous,

38:28.000 --> 38:31.000
even if it's not the best story-wise.

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
I've been playing the first Mass Effect and I played it on the stream on Thursday,

38:34.000 --> 38:40.000
and I'm probably going to end up getting it beaten on the stream next Thursday, if I feel like it.

38:43.000 --> 38:46.000
Really? Oh yeah, Final Fantasy XIV.

38:46.000 --> 38:50.000
Because we had a beta weekend, and I have a Thaumaturge.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
Oh yeah, we can talk about that now, huh?

38:52.000 --> 38:55.000
Yeah, we can. We just can't say anything about the last beta.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.000
Well, I didn't play in this beta weekend, so I guess I can't really.

38:57.000 --> 39:02.000
I just got my invite for PlayStation 3, so I will have to download it.

39:04.000 --> 39:11.000
I think that, honestly, after as long as I played WoW, it has everything that I liked in Cataclysm,

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
because that's what got me playing WoW.

39:13.000 --> 39:20.000
And none of the utter grinding crap that's in the panda version.

39:20.000 --> 39:23.000
Panda area. Stupid pandas.

39:23.000 --> 39:26.000
Gummy bears, gummy bears. WoW gummy bear edition.

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
So I'm really enjoying it, and I like playing my catgirl.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Or my mikote, or whatever she's called.

39:31.000 --> 39:32.000
She's a catgirl.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.000
Mythra.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
No.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
Although they have the same animations.

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
It's so stupid that they change the name.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
They have the same animations.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.000
They're the same races.

39:41.000 --> 39:44.000
I think Lalafell is probably the cutest name for that race possible.

39:44.000 --> 39:48.000
And it's kind of funny finding gangster Lalafell in the town I started in.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
They're like, we're badass Lalafell.

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
There's this little Lalafell walking around looking all badass wearing a monocle.

39:53.000 --> 39:56.000
And then these two big hulking guys behind him.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
He's like, look at me, I'm a badass midget.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
It was pretty funny. So yeah.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.000
Loki.

40:02.000 --> 40:09.000
I played literally one session of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 this week.

40:09.000 --> 40:14.000
Because every other time I was just basically reading E3 news, all my coworkers were gone.

40:14.000 --> 40:17.000
So I didn't get to play with anybody.

40:17.000 --> 40:21.000
And I was working on 3D modeling in the meantime.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
So yeah, I didn't play anything.

40:23.000 --> 40:30.000
I did buy, though, the Serious Sam collection on Humble Bundle, the weekly sale.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.000
So I got that.

40:32.000 --> 40:35.000
Fuck, I never got a Humble Bundle 8 and it's done, huh?

40:35.000 --> 40:36.000
Yep.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.000
Shit.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
Oh well. That was my bad.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.000
Oh well.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
So, I mean, that was pretty cool.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
You don't just have to buy Humble Bundle 9, maybe they'll throw a name with it.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Yeah, it's true, it's true.

40:47.000 --> 40:51.000
So, I mean, I haven't ever played any of that series, but it looked cool.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
So I wanted to pick that up and I thought it was a good deal.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.000
What else?

40:56.000 --> 40:59.000
Bought PlayStation Plus for a year.

40:59.000 --> 41:04.000
Haven't redeemed it yet, though, but I'm looking forward to trying out the free games that are on there and stuff.

41:05.000 --> 41:08.000
Because I have a 500 gig hard drive to fill up with games that I haven't played yet.

41:08.000 --> 41:15.000
And a pre-ordered PlayStation 4, because I'm worried that I might not be able to get one if I don't.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
So, I did.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
Alright.

41:18.000 --> 41:23.000
Oh, and just to say, for those of us who are playing Final Fantasy XIV and want to join us on a beta weekend,

41:23.000 --> 41:26.000
we are on the North American Behemoth server.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.000
There you go.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.000
Do you have a link shell yet?

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
We don't have a link shell yet.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
We don't have a link shell yet.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.000
Okay, I will have to remember that.

41:31.000 --> 41:35.000
And you can only add friends if they're online at the same time, so I couldn't get anybody.

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
Remind me later to talk to you about Facebook things.

41:38.000 --> 41:41.000
Unless Shane Alinko happens to be listening, then you know what to do.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
Alright.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
As far as Loki's concerned.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Which I think I did see him in chat earlier.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
Okay, so my gaming week.

41:47.000 --> 41:53.000
So, even though Orange Lawn and Tradio, the world's longest weekly internet show about video games,

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
is not a recognized media outfit of E3,

41:55.000 --> 42:00.000
I went down to the show anyway just to, well, to get Bobby.

42:00.000 --> 42:03.000
And I did check out the Ouya booth, because it was open to all.

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
It was outside.

42:04.000 --> 42:05.000
So, what the heck?

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
I went to go check out the Ouya.

42:06.000 --> 42:10.000
Because I didn't get a whole lot of hands on time with Ouya when Loki brought it over, right?

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
So, I did get to check out a few new games on Ouya.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
One of the games I played was Soul Fjord.

42:14.000 --> 42:18.000
And funny enough, it's like the first game I walked up to and I'm like,

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
alright, so tell me about your game.

42:19.000 --> 42:22.000
And he's like, well, it's like a rhythm game.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
He goes, it's hard to explain.

42:23.000 --> 42:26.000
He's like, it's a rhythm game mixed with a roguelike.

42:26.000 --> 42:30.000
I'm like, this sounds like the perfect game right up my alley.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
I love dungeon crawlers and I love rhythm games.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
Tell me more, sir.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
So, he actually showed me the game.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
And yes, it is a rhythm game mixed with a roguelike.

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
It's like a dungeon crawler, but you attack to the beat of the music.

42:40.000 --> 42:44.000
And your little combos, like when you want to do a combo, you hold down the trigger.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
And little beat patterns show over your sword.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
So, you can kind of do the little patterns.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
And if you do it right, you do like an AoE attack.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.000
So, it was kind of cool.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
Yeah, it was cute.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
I liked it.

42:53.000 --> 42:54.000
So, I have my eye on that.

42:54.000 --> 42:57.000
Like, if I'm going to get a new AoE, which I might, depending on finances,

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
I would definitely pick up Solfjord.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
I like that.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
That was fun.

43:01.000 --> 43:06.000
He did say, if I heard the guy correctly, he said, though, it's going to be a difficult game.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
And if you die, you die.

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
It's like Dark Souls.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
You go all the way back to start.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
So, you know, that whole thing.

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
So, that'll be interesting to see what happens.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
Let's see.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
I saw another game called The Amazing Frog.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
This game was weird.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
What?

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
No, I want to know about this one because I've heard of it.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
It looked weird to me.

43:27.000 --> 43:32.000
And I'm going to admit, it's a game where you can tell the graphics on the Ouya are a little bit behind.

43:32.000 --> 43:36.000
Because the other two games, like Solfjord, looked like any other Xbox Live arcade game to me.

43:36.000 --> 43:37.000
It was, like, cartoony.

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
You know, it looked like that to me.

43:39.000 --> 43:44.000
I could tell The Amazing Frog was a little weaker graphically.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.000
But that's not the developer's fault.

43:45.000 --> 43:48.000
I hear the game has really loud boomboxes in it.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
I couldn't figure it out.

43:50.000 --> 43:53.000
Like, it's like this open world frog runner game.

43:53.000 --> 43:57.000
And all you can do with the controller is you jump and you fling.

43:57.000 --> 44:02.000
And it's like this big open playground and you can fling yourself on a trampoline and go flying.

44:02.000 --> 44:05.000
It is the type of open world shit you would eat right out the monkey.

44:05.000 --> 44:06.000
No, I've already played it before.

44:06.000 --> 44:10.000
So, it's basically like the insurance fraud mode in Saints Row.

44:10.000 --> 44:16.000
You basically run around and you try to hit a bunch of explosives and chain your frog to, you know,

44:16.000 --> 44:21.000
land in the air and knock shit over and you make cars explode and all that fun stuff.

44:21.000 --> 44:25.000
So, I wasn't sure I got the game in there, but as far as, like,

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
Well, it's still very early.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
Yeah, I'm kind of like giving these guys the benefit of the doubt.

44:28.000 --> 44:31.000
I'm like, alright, it's early. It's just a concept. We'll see. We'll see.

44:31.000 --> 44:34.000
Keep your eye on it. I'm not saying it's bad. I'm just saying.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
It's free right now.

44:35.000 --> 44:38.000
I didn't get it, but maybe I'll get it later.

44:38.000 --> 44:42.000
The other game I checked out, the third one I checked out, was called Chronoblade.

44:42.000 --> 44:45.000
And I looked at it because it looked like Diablo from afar.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Because it had, like, the little red and blue potions in the corner.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
You know, I'm like, oh, this is like a Diablo clone.

44:49.000 --> 44:52.000
So, I went to play it and it's apparently a free-to-play game.

44:52.000 --> 44:55.000
It's not just on Ouya. They have a web browser based thing that's in closed beta right now.

44:55.000 --> 44:58.000
Well, here's the thing. It looks like Diablo from a distance.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
It plays like the Ninja Turtles arcade game.

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
That's awesome.

45:01.000 --> 45:05.000
Like, to me, it was like a beat-em-up with, like, the jump and the punch and all that.

45:05.000 --> 45:09.000
And you could do, like, the special moves. And as you beat people up, you gain magic.

45:09.000 --> 45:13.000
So, that's what it felt like to me. And I was like, alright, this is.

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
And then the guy was kind enough to give me a closed beta key.

45:15.000 --> 45:18.000
So, I was like, I think I will be cashing that in. That looks like fun.

45:18.000 --> 45:22.000
You can get more information on that one at facebook.com slash Chronoblade Online.

45:22.000 --> 45:26.000
All one word. I imagine they're giving away a lot of those closed beta keys.

45:26.000 --> 45:30.000
Soulfjord.com was the other game. And I didn't get a website or anything for Amazing Frog.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
Sorry, but Google it. I'm sure you'll find it.

45:32.000 --> 45:38.000
Well, Soulfjord is the folks behind Quantum Conundrum and that kind of stuff.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
So, they make some pretty awesome games.

45:41.000 --> 45:48.000
So, there you go. I mean, other than that, lots of Animal Crossing, but not enough to even, like, pay off my second loan.

45:48.000 --> 45:52.000
Like, I just, there's too much. Street passing. I did a lot of street passing.

45:52.000 --> 45:56.000
I sat in the lobby at E3 while I waited for Bobby Blackwolf because he took his time.

45:56.000 --> 46:00.000
Which I understand. He was trying to get answers to questions and was fishing up a demo. He took his time.

46:00.000 --> 46:05.000
And I just street passed over and over. I literally got, like, 120 puzzle pieces over the weekend.

46:05.000 --> 46:12.000
I completed, like, two puzzles and, yeah, I'm only, like, 80 panels away from full completion.

46:12.000 --> 46:16.000
So, that made me excited. There you go.

46:16.000 --> 46:23.000
Dungeonbuster in chat at live.voggetetwork.com says, Uya didn't pay to be at E3, so they rented out a parking lot nearby and held their events there.

46:23.000 --> 46:28.000
Yeah, and the ESA rented a big truck and parked it right in front of the booth.

46:28.000 --> 46:29.000
That's kind of a dick move.

46:30.000 --> 46:34.000
It was kind of a dick move. Like, it wasn't that big a deal, honestly.

46:34.000 --> 46:43.000
The Uya thing was like, hey, we've got beer over here and some developer, like, I did not see the Uya being pushed.

46:43.000 --> 46:48.000
I saw developers making games on Uya being pushed. That's what I saw.

46:48.000 --> 46:52.000
I don't know what the ESA was so afraid of. That was kind of a dick move on their part.

46:52.000 --> 46:55.000
I did take a picture of the whole thing. Judge for yourself.

46:55.000 --> 47:01.000
E3.voggetetwork.com. It's the one booth I got to do. Go look at the Uya booth over there at E3.voggetetwork.com.

47:01.000 --> 47:06.000
And you should look at all the stuff there that Bobby collected. He answered a lot of your questions.

47:06.000 --> 47:09.000
Unfortunately, you know, sometimes there's going to be no comment or we're not going to talk about that.

47:09.000 --> 47:21.000
But a couple, there was at least more than a couple, like a handful of things, like Square Enix basically flat out saying how to get Kingdom Hearts on Xbox, if that's what you want, giving the answer that.

47:21.000 --> 47:29.000
A definitive price for the Disney Infinity figurines. All figured out thanks to you guys and your questions at E3.voggetetwork.com.

47:29.000 --> 47:35.000
And more. I could have told you that, though. Just saying.

47:35.000 --> 47:42.000
All right. To the results of the live poll. Here it is. The results of the live poll tonight. What will sell more this holiday season?

47:42.000 --> 47:50.000
We use 61.90% Xbox One 38.10. We'll call that 60-40. It's close enough to 60-40 split there.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
So it's not a blowout.

47:52.000 --> 48:00.000
It all depends on like what price drops on the Wii U side or even the Xbox One side. And if they reverse their policy, it's just there's a lot of time.

48:00.000 --> 48:09.000
Yeah, there is. I mean, yeah. And, you know, admittedly, that question was I said at the beginning, this is the troll face skeptic question.

48:09.000 --> 48:12.000
But I thought it was a fun one to ask. I hope you had fun answering it.

48:12.000 --> 48:19.000
Okay. Housekeeping. Twitter.com slash O.L.R. or Facebook. Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio.

48:19.000 --> 48:28.000
Next week on the program, June 23rd, 2013, our pal J.V. Mohn will be here to help us celebrate 11 years of OrangeLoungeRadio.

48:28.000 --> 48:34.000
And this is what's very interesting, too, is that June 23rd is the actual birthday. That doesn't happen every year.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
So every 11 years, you can expect it's a joke.

48:36.000 --> 48:44.000
Well, it's like every five or six years the way the leap years were. Yeah, but but this is one of the few times we actually get to celebrate a birthday on our birthday.

48:44.000 --> 48:48.000
Maybe I will have to convince somebody else to make murder brownies again.

48:48.000 --> 48:54.000
That would be fantastic. So we hope you guys will join us. We're not planning anything. I mean, you get to a certain age and you just kind of stop caring.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
No, you can't say that.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
I don't say you stop caring. I shouldn't say that. No, we are.

48:58.000 --> 49:03.000
No, no, no. How about I quote the amazing Wanda Sykes? The older I get, the less of a fuck I give.

49:03.000 --> 49:12.000
Kinda, kinda. But it's just one of those, you know, we don't need to have the whole self-serving, hooray, we're 11 show. We've done that before.

49:12.000 --> 49:15.000
10 was a big thing. It was, it was.

49:15.000 --> 49:19.000
It's great. Now I'm thinking of Patton Oswalt where he talks about what birthdays you're allowed to celebrate.

49:19.000 --> 49:24.000
Yeah, yeah. It's like you're 11, no one cares. When you're 13, you're a teenager. That one's big.

49:24.000 --> 49:30.000
So if you want to get us a cake, we'll eat it. That's that's what we're going to say about next week's show.

49:30.000 --> 49:33.000
Preferably, I like carrot cake. Just saying.

49:33.000 --> 49:36.000
Do we have confirmed our guest for two weeks now? Guest host in two weeks?

49:36.000 --> 49:37.000
I thought we did.

49:37.000 --> 49:38.000
I think we do.

49:38.000 --> 49:41.000
Because of another transaction that's occurring around that.

49:41.000 --> 49:47.000
Well, I'm just going to say I am fully expecting that in two weeks, first make slidekick from Game Buoy will be here live.

49:47.000 --> 49:48.000
Then that'll be a lot of fun.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
And if not, we're going to go get him.

49:50.000 --> 49:53.000
And I'm going to razz the crap out of him on his old show, Fabulous Flames.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
We're going to duct tape him to a buoy.

49:55.000 --> 49:56.000
Good times.

49:56.000 --> 49:57.000
And bring him along with us.

49:57.000 --> 50:03.000
Good times. All right. Tune in live every Sunday for the antics. Live.vognetwork.com.

50:03.000 --> 50:08.000
I'm hoping we can start lining up some interviews, too, now that E3 is over, because I definitely want to talk to some of these OUYA guys.

50:08.000 --> 50:15.000
And you know, whatever else we can get now that people are going to be really in that rush to get people to preorder for the holiday.

50:15.000 --> 50:21.000
Let's run down more news. Maybe some things you missed. Maybe not. Some clarifications. Setting people straight.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
Loki, why don't you start us off with the news?

50:23.000 --> 50:32.000
Well, Major Nelson was answering a bunch of questions. I think that he even did, like, a thing on NeoGaf where he was answering questions for people and stuff, posting on there.

50:32.000 --> 50:40.000
But there was one of the interviews. They were basically asking, you know, obviously, very obvious questions, you know, with the announcements that, you know, Sony made.

50:40.000 --> 50:44.000
Will this influence Microsoft and make them change what they're doing with the Xbox One?

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
And here's what basically he commented on.

50:46.000 --> 50:51.000
I don't think, I mean, we're really not going to change anything we've done with the Xbox One.

50:51.000 --> 50:56.000
We're very happy. Did you see the games on stage during the briefing? Did you see the exclusives?

50:56.000 --> 50:59.000
I mean, we're really proud of the system and the games that are coming out.

50:59.000 --> 51:04.000
When you look at it, games like Titanfall, have you gone through the Titanfall yet?

51:04.000 --> 51:09.000
Enough said. Conversation over. We're really happy what they showed on stage and what's showing here in the booth.

51:09.000 --> 51:12.000
So I think it's safe to say that we're confident where we're going.

51:12.000 --> 51:18.000
We're also confident that gamers are going to love our vision of the future and what we're going to offer for gaming.

51:18.000 --> 51:24.000
So basically, no, they're too stubborn to change their mind so far.

51:24.000 --> 51:31.000
But I mean, then again, I mean, he was only being asked that a few days after, you know, the announcement.

51:31.000 --> 51:38.000
And sales, I think sales figures, if they're trailing way behind, that could change things.

51:38.000 --> 51:45.000
You guys have to understand that corporations and the talking heads for corporations have to stick to talking points at big shows like this.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
And they have investors, remember?

51:47.000 --> 51:52.000
They are all trained on said talking points. They don't deviate from those talking points.

51:52.000 --> 51:56.000
And when they do it, that's why it's always news when somebody goes off the cusp.

51:56.000 --> 52:00.000
So, you know, they always stick to their talking points.

52:00.000 --> 52:04.000
By the way, I was checking to see if Major Nelson had replied to what I told him.

52:04.000 --> 52:07.000
I think he's got a lot of people telling things right now.

52:07.000 --> 52:11.000
So I thought there was an interesting comment in chat from Ross Steel UT.

52:11.000 --> 52:17.000
Major Nelson, the only community outreach guy left, and he only stayed because he's a good enough yes man.

52:17.000 --> 52:20.000
Does Microsoft need their Kevin Butler right now?

52:22.000 --> 52:30.000
Dude, if they brought Kevin Butler out on stage during that play scene, I think everyone would have about lost it.

52:30.000 --> 52:34.000
You know what I think would have been great for their presentation?

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
Bring hard gay out of retirement.

52:36.000 --> 52:40.000
Have them just go around humping everybody and going, woo!

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
That would have sold Xbox ones right there.

52:42.000 --> 52:43.000
Oh god, alright.

52:45.000 --> 52:52.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, cloud.

52:52.000 --> 52:57.000
I only mentioned this game briefly, like really briefly, but obviously it's kind of a big deal.

52:57.000 --> 53:01.000
You know, it's the game a lot of people were talking about before E3 is the big Microsoft announcement.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Killer Instinct.

53:03.000 --> 53:09.000
Killer Instinct was revealed at the Microsoft press briefing, and here's the whole thing.

53:09.000 --> 53:13.000
It came out afterwards that Killer Instinct is going to be free to play.

53:13.000 --> 53:17.000
But they're actually now saying that that might not actually be part of it.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
There's some clarifications coming out.

53:19.000 --> 53:28.000
The game has said that the game is going to be free to play, and when it launches on Xbox One, you can get Jago for free, and then you can buy all the other characters.

53:28.000 --> 53:34.000
However, what's not being said, the full game will also be available on its release.

53:34.000 --> 53:44.000
So if you don't want to do the whole nickel and dime model for only certain characters, then you can drop the, assumably, 60 bucks and get the whole thing unlocked at once.

53:44.000 --> 53:48.000
I actually think this model isn't as terrible as everyone says it is.

53:48.000 --> 53:51.000
Now that we have the clarification, you can still get the game out of the box.

53:51.000 --> 53:54.000
Yeah, it's basically a demo, but it's an upgradeable demo.

53:54.000 --> 53:58.000
You're in a pretty good situation if your favorite character is Jago.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
You know what it reminds me of?

54:00.000 --> 54:09.000
It reminds me of the Rock Band game on PSP, where you could download the demo, and you could download songs from the marketplace and play them in the demo.

54:09.000 --> 54:14.000
You never had to buy the full game unless you wanted the full game's song list.

54:14.000 --> 54:18.000
I don't know, it kinda reminds me of that, so, interesting.

54:18.000 --> 54:22.000
By the way, Double Helix also has unveiled Glacius as another character in the game.

54:22.000 --> 54:25.000
He will be playable at EVO 2013.

54:25.000 --> 54:29.000
There's also going to be 40 training lessons in the game to teach players about the game.

54:29.000 --> 54:41.000
It is a little disappointing that it's Double Helix, the folks behind the latest Silent Hill game, are making this game and not Rare, the company behind Very Awesome Games.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
KoopaKa Jeremy in chat says,

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Then why even focus on the free-to-play thing?

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
They should have made that clear right away.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
Like everything they've been saying, they need to be crystal clear.

54:50.000 --> 54:54.000
Here's a great example of what happens when somebody doesn't stick to talking points.

54:54.000 --> 55:00.000
Because I think somebody made a one-off comment about this to a press site.

55:00.000 --> 55:04.000
And here we go, gaming industry, copy-paste, copy-paste, copy-paste, copy-paste.

55:04.000 --> 55:08.000
It's free-to-play, free-to-play, free-to-play, free-to-play, based off one guy that went off the page.

55:08.000 --> 55:17.000
And that's why you didn't see Microsoft doing a backpedaling or an about-face at E3.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
There is not time to change the script.

55:19.000 --> 55:25.000
Well, that's an even bigger reason why, again, canceling all those Q&As and so forth.

55:25.000 --> 55:32.000
Also being pointed out in chat amongst the folks there that Rare is not making this game.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
Which is a little bit surprising.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
Somebody else is.

55:36.000 --> 55:39.000
It's the people that made Silent Hill Homecoming.

55:39.000 --> 55:42.000
Which wasn't a bad game.

55:42.000 --> 55:55.000
I mean, okay, I have a special warm, fuzzy place in my heart for Killer Instinct because of the same reason I have a warm, fuzzy place in my heart for World Cup Soccer 94.

55:55.000 --> 56:01.000
I mean, I played it, yeah, my first year of college. It was a big thing for me. It's what I spent all my time on.

56:02.000 --> 56:08.000
And this new version, while I'm mildly interested in it, it doesn't seem like it's going to be...

56:08.000 --> 56:14.000
It was about the only thing that they mentioned that made me perk up at all, and it was only for the nostalgia's sake.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
And I don't think they can really bank on that.

56:16.000 --> 56:22.000
Yeah, it's kind of one of those things where it's like, oh, I'd love to check it out if I was going to get an Xbox One, but I'm not going to right now.

56:22.000 --> 56:26.000
Maybe I'll get an Xbox One in a year, and I think that's what will end up happening.

56:26.000 --> 56:33.000
And to be fair, folks, I bought the 360 at launch, well, soon after launch, and I waited a year to get a PlayStation 3.

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
This is just that in reverse.

56:35.000 --> 56:40.000
On the topic of that, you know, they redesigned the 360 to look like the Xbox One, and I think it's fucking ugly.

56:40.000 --> 56:43.000
That console looks not good anymore.

56:43.000 --> 56:48.000
I think we've, and I've talked about this before, I think we focus way too much on the looks of consoles.

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
It's not that big a deal.

56:50.000 --> 56:55.000
Like, a lot of people were talking about the PlayStation 4 in its weird shape, and I'm just like, alright, so it's oddly shaped.

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
But here's the thing, though.

56:57.000 --> 57:01.000
I like that it's vertical or horizontal again, and you can put it wherever you want. That's cool.

57:01.000 --> 57:07.000
Yeah, here's the thing, though, is why would you redesign your current gen console to make it look like the Xbox One?

57:07.000 --> 57:12.000
That's going to be confusing now, because people are going to say, hey, I saw that console on TV.

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
Which console is it? It's one of the Xboxes.

57:14.000 --> 57:18.000
Oh, it's this one, and they get a 360, you know, because...

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
You don't think the name is right there on the front?

57:21.000 --> 57:31.000
No, they're going to see the 360 with the new branding say, oh, that looks fun, and whoever's going to be selling them the system is going to point out the more expensive, newest one.

57:33.000 --> 57:38.000
Anyhow. Yeah, the redesign is weird, but I'm kind of like, I just don't care.

57:38.000 --> 57:42.000
Like, there's so much more to worry about with these consoles than the look.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
And Rob, Betamax forever.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Whatever. Move on. Dark Saga.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Yeah, okay, I got other stuff.

57:48.000 --> 57:55.000
Now, this one, it's a little bit more falls into the conspiracy theory part of...

57:55.000 --> 58:00.000
I don't really know exactly how to think about it, but the first time I saw this article, it really made me raise my eyebrow.

58:00.000 --> 58:08.000
It's an article of a guy named Jason. I'm trying to see what his full name is.

58:09.000 --> 58:21.000
But he was basically at E3 taking photos of the Microsoft booth, or some of the gaming booths, and he took a picture of a laptop being hooked up.

58:21.000 --> 58:32.000
And he got pulled aside and was told to delete the photo, which he actually went back and redrew, of basically the games running off of laptops and PCs.

58:32.000 --> 58:42.000
Now, there was a big stink going on about this on the Game Facts board, which I was reading through, and they're saying, no, those can't be dev kits.

58:42.000 --> 58:55.000
They are running off of Nvidia cards, which, as far as I was aware, the Nvidia GTX cards, which, as far as I was aware, wasn't supposed to be incorporated into the final system.

58:55.000 --> 59:01.000
So they're saying that they weren't actually running off of the development PCs. These were running off of regular PCs.

59:02.000 --> 59:06.000
And they even had the games crash the PCs.

59:06.000 --> 59:13.000
Okay, that makes sense, because I was going to say, when you first brought this up, I'm like, alright, well, you know, having the consoles running off PCs isn't that big a deal.

59:13.000 --> 59:18.000
I remember when the 360 was first shown, it was the same thing. Whatever, that's not a big deal.

59:18.000 --> 59:22.000
But yeah, if you're talking about, they're like, really different, that's interesting.

59:23.000 --> 59:32.000
I don't know, I kind of, I'm going to be honest, I think there is a real desire in the gaming community right now to just dogpile Microsoft.

59:32.000 --> 59:37.000
Let's kick the bastards while they're down for daring to fuck with my used games. Beat them up.

59:37.000 --> 59:42.000
But then again, Microsoft should have left that guy alone when he took the picture.

59:42.000 --> 59:45.000
Well, here's the other thing. That threat on Game Facts is gone.

59:45.000 --> 59:49.000
Well, I don't understand how they could say, you better delete that photo. I'd be like, you better fuck off.

59:49.000 --> 59:56.000
Hold on, let me see if I can find it. Okay, a guard stood outside to keep me from freaking out and making a run for it.

59:56.000 --> 01:00:01.000
A couple Microsoft PR folks came in, large four smiles on their faces, they just wanted to talk to me.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:06.000
And then going, they made a big point of telling me they were not telling me to delete the photos.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:13.000
That's because they really couldn't, since they never said what could or couldn't be photos, but they also didn't want me to leave that little room with those photos.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Share.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:21.000
That's the news story here. Microsoft made a big deal out of something that shouldn't have been a big deal.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Now, here's just two more lines.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:30.000
It was weird they were clearly unhappy and concerned, even though they insisted that laptop was just controlling looping video,

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:35.000
which it certainly may have been doing, which makes it even weirder that they were so upset at the photos.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Not being able to take their intense stares and restrained desire to yank the camera out of my hands any longer, I just deleted the photos.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Then they set me free.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.000
He redrew the, and I'm actually, I'm going to go ahead and link this article for everybody.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:53.000
It was on Gizmodo, actually the Australian Gizmodo site.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.000
But I'm going to link it in the chatroom because it really is worth giving a good read over.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000
And he drew a copy of the photo.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:09.000
It doesn't seem like it would be anything, but what makes it most suspicious is that they made a big stink out of it.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:15.000
You know, if they had just said, oh, whatever, you know, it's sort of like when you tell the little kid they can't have something,

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:19.000
and then the kid thinks that that's something big and that they're going to sneak and get it.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:24.000
It's that same type of thing. It makes it a bigger deal than what, you know, if it wasn't a big deal,

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.000
why are they trying to restrain this guy and browbeat him into deleting a photo?

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000
I bet you the PS4s are running off PCs too.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Well, yeah, all the dev kits are PCs.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:40.000
But if these aren't exactly the dev kits, if they are trying to run it off of a more beefed up system, then we have a problem.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Especially if they're saying that they're being run off of the system hardware.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:49.000
It's a huge risk too, because if the game that comes out doesn't match what was played at E3,

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000
the people that played at E3 are going to call it out.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000
It was Colonial Marines all over again.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.000
But it's Gearbox not making the game, so they're okay, right?

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
I don't know.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Anyhow, let's move on.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Alright, so, hey, you want that Xbox One?

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Well, you better be living in certain regions of the world, because it only supports a few different countries.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:23.000
So at launch, if you're living in a good portion of Asia, well, you're fucked.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:48.000
So basically, the only places, countries that you can access Xbox Live at launch are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and the US.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
No Japan.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000
No Japan.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Even though the first developer up, Japanese developer, and I think the only Japanese developer that showed up at E3's press conference, which I also found interesting.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:08.000
I found it very interesting who was at what press conference. Did you notice there was no EA at Sony's conference?

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:14.000
And that they were showing the 2K sports game instead. I just thought it was interesting. Just put it out there. I thought it was very interesting.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
I think it's noteworthy.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Noted.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Noted, yeah.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Alright. What do you think though about the fact that they left Japan off? I mean, I think we all knew that Microsoft was going to write them off, but that, I mean a lot of great games come out of Japan.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
It's a little weird to me.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:42.000
But it seems like a lot of them, to me, it seems like they're willing to write off a lot of these people that would buy this console.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:49.000
They're willing to write off Japan as a whole, even though there are some people that did buy the Xbox 360. They're willing to write off people that don't have good internet.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:56.000
They're willing to write those people off. They're willing to write off, you know, people that are in the military. They have to write them off.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000
It's disrespect and being un-inclusive.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:12.000
They're just like, too bad. You can't conform to what we want. So, hey, you guys, and I heard the argument from fanboys saying, well, hey, they had broadband internet on the original Xbox. That was the only way. No dial-up.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:23.000
And people still bought it. Yeah, but you know what? It's a little different to, I don't know if it's an equal comparison because you can still play games offline with the original Xbox.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Well, I think IKUMA JP pretty much nailed it. We don't care now.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Well, it's just interesting to me because I realize, you know, and I see a lot of folks overall on chat are saying like, well, Microsoft gave up on Japan a long time ago, but I'm kind of like, okay.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Japan was ever really into Microsoft.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Well, but again, the first developer, first trailer to show up at the Microsoft thing, Japanese developers.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:56.000
What was the biggest response at a Sony's press conference beside the whole, you know, going for the jugular Microsoft policy? Two games developed by a Japanese studio.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:01.000
That happened to be coming to Microsoft system as well, but it wasn't really pointed out.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:08.000
I thought it was interesting. Noted. Make a note. That's all.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Anyhow. Well, this isn't from a Japanese developer, but it certainly got a lot of people excited anyway.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:24.000
It's a new Mirror's Edge game and, you know, a lot of people had a sad when it didn't show up at, you know, Microsoft's thing or whatever.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:30.000
But then it showed up later, yay, at EA's press conference that a new Mirror's Edge game is in the works.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:36.000
It is a reboot, actually, of the franchise, which, you know, is weird because there was only one game, so they're rebooting the one game.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:40.000
But that's all right, you know. It's going to be open world this time.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:47.000
And a nice little letter posted on the official Mirror's Edge site from DICE senior producer Sarah Jansen.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:53.000
We introduced Mirror's Edge and Faith to gamers five years ago, and we've waited for the right moment to reunite them.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Thanks to the Frostbite engine, which a whole shit ton of those EA games are all running on.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.000
That's like EA's bread and butter right now, is that Frostbite engine, if you think about it.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:10.000
And a new generation of platforms. We are now able to deliver a richer world the players will be able to explore with a new level of freedom in both movement and action.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.000
And a lot of people very excited about this. And, yeah, I'm curious, too.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:23.000
You know, I didn't, like, love the first game, but I definitely respected it, and I'm looking forward to this reimagining of Mirror's Edge.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
I am glad that it's multi-platform.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Mm-hmm, me too.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Very cool. Moving on, Dark Sakura and then release dates.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Well, we have, you know, we sort of made a mention of this, I think, a little bit earlier, but we like Minecraft, don't we?

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:45.000
I used to hate Minecraft. Now I love it. I don't play it on Xbox, which now I'm glad that I don't.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Yeah, you definitely don't play it on the VoG network server anymore.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Well, I did, but it wasn't always connecting.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Well, here is a really crappy thing for all of you Xbox Minecraft fans. Your save's not going to carry over to the Xbone.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Oops!

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Yeah, I'm not surprised.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:13.000
I'm getting the sense that it's, even though they're both Minecraft, they're still, like, separate games. That's kind of the sense I'm getting from this, you know?

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.000
They said that they were discussing it, but I don't think it's going to happen.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:26.000
You know, they really do seem to be trying to put this wedge of separation in between the 360 and the bone.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:35.000
I just don't really see that as an issue, just because it's just like, if you were to have, I don't know.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:45.000
It would be hard because those features that are on the original version of Minecraft, like your worlds and stuff, are going to be locked into a certain size and stuff.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:51.000
When you're putting in basically a redone engine, even though it is the same game, it's just not going to transfer over.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Just start anew. I mean, seriously, it's not that big a deal. I don't know. But, you know, once again, I think it's a whole dog-pile mentality.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.000
But there are people who put a lot of time and effort into their crap on Minecraft.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Yeah, I mean, a game like Minecraft, I'm actually like, you know, a lot of people have created these huge things, and maybe Minecraft on Xbox One will fix some of the things.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Like, you know, you're not going to have the limits on the world size like 360. Yeah, maybe it's going to fix some of these things, but it would be nice if people could transfer their time and effort over.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:29.000
I've seen people put a lot of effort into building some of the same monumental, ginormous creations on Xbox as they have to doing on a PC.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000
And it's a shame not to be able to carry that over.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:39.000
I think part of what makes this noteworthy is that it shouldn't be that fucking hard. It's Minecraft. It's not that.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000
It's a Java game.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:49.000
I know. It's not. I'm like, you know, I'm not belittling what a huge impact Minecraft has been on gaming and the heavy hitter that it is as far as the game is concerned.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:54.000
But it doesn't seem like to me that it should be that big a fucking deal to transfer a save file over.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.000
I don't think it should be at all.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Yeah.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Well, especially, is there any sort of cloud saving on Xbox? I haven't touched my Xbox in forever.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.000
There is.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
So they've got a cloud saving feature.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.000
You're right.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Why shouldn't they be able to transfer things over via cloud?

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Because it's a sad cloud.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
It's not a happy little cloud.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000
It's a rain cloud.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:17.000
It's a sad cloud that rains shit.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Speaking of the cloud, Brad from Pod Culture says,

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Rob, I wonder how that DCU for the PS4 will tie in with the PS3 version or even if it will.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Check Bobby's answers at e3.vognetwork.com because I believe he came back.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Was it you or somebody else had asked a question very similar to that.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:44.000
And I believe the response was it is that you will be able to log in and it's the same just with new textures

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.000
and, you know, everything you would expect from going up to the PlayStation 4.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.000
It sounded like the right answer, actually.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
I'll split it that way.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.000
I think everything did transfer over.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Yeah.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.000
All right.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Let's travel around the world and check out some games that are coming out a lot sooner than what we saw at e3.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Not a whole lot this week.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Actually, some Vita stuff.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Jak and Daxter Collection coming out on the Vita.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Also this week, Muramasa Rebirth coming out on Vita as well.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:22.000
And then Game & Wario one week from today.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Nice.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Something for the Wii U.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Yeah.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Great.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Have you checked out The Last of Us yet?

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
I am hearing such amazing, amazing things about that game.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000
I really want to check it out.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
I just don't care.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000
I mean, I don't know.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
I just I don't really.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.000
I'm not.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.000
No.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Are you sure you're not going to be like like I originally was with Mass Effect where it's like, I'm not going to like this game.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.000
I'm not going to like this game.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.000
And then I play the game like the story is so fucking good, though.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:55.000
It's just I don't really want to I don't want to start another game right now.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.000
I'll tell you what, though.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Fair enough.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000
What?

01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.000
This is a completely off topic here.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
So Bobby got the information from it.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:07.000
The Earth Defense Force 2025 is fucking coming out next year in 2014.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:11.000
So, you know, that means you got to import the fucking version that's coming out in Japan in July.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Good.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Good job, Bobby.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.000
I'm ruining Loki's day.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.000
But as they mentioned, there are some digging.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
The PlayStation 4 will be region free.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.000
And here's the weird thing, though.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:26.000
It's region free, both disc based game and digital games.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.000
So that's not true.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:35.000
I think right now on the PlayStation three, I think you can only buy stuff from certain regions, but apparently you can buy.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:42.000
I don't know if you have to create another account like in that region, but that'd be kind of cool if I can buy like Japanese games or something.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Bobby Blackwell's in our chat room right now at live dog network dot com.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.000
Wanting you to know he took a picture of the banner just for you, Loki.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.000
It's all right.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
They're going to be coming to our game summit in the end of July.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:57.000
And I, you know, our rep over, you know, Phillips, say, justify, justify, justify.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
She knows I'm a huge fan.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.000
And it was last year.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Got some fly swatters based on insect Armageddon stuff.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.000
So that's why I saw the play through insect Armageddon.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
I got on one of those humble bundles or whatever.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.000
So.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.000
All right.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Let's talk about release dates in Japan and on the PlayStation three this week, a new dual shock controller in a gray color.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Also, The Last of Us making its way to Japan both on June 20th.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:27.000
If for whatever reason, The Last of Us is not up your alley, try Dyson Ryaku.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
I'm sorry, I said that wrong. Dyson Ryaku.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Daitoua Kobushi.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Tora Tora Tora Wara Kishuniseko Seri.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Yes, that is the full name of the game.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Regular and luxury editions.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000
You might have caught from the Tora Tora Tora in there.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.000
It is a plane fight type game.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.000
There you go.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
I like that it's called a luxury edition.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000
That makes it seem regular and luxury.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000
It's luxurious.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Does it come wrapped in silk on the Xbox 360?

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:00.000
I will still cover releases on 360 in Japan as long as they're there.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Batman Arkham Twin Pack, a repackaging,

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:08.000
assumably of the two Batman games for Japanese audiences there.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:13.000
That's probably like a price drop type of thing on the PlayStation Vita this week.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Quite a bit.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000
FIFA 13 World Class Soccer gets a price reduction.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:21.000
I'm sorry, Winning Post 7 2013 comes out this week.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Also a new game.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Kami Jaigen Idol Neptune PP in limited and regular editions.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.000
And I think this looks like some type of,

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.000
like it might be a music game.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
I can't tell.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:41.000
I think it's like a pop idol game.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000
Jamie, help me.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Do you recognize anything from these screenshots here?

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Like what type of game this might be?

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
This seems to be the most telling one.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
You see the little things with the patterns on them.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.000
And it seems like maybe it's...

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
I've never, I don't know this one.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:53.000
I don't know.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.000
All right.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Sorry.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.000
Maybe somebody in chat does.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000
What was the name again?

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Kami Jaigen Idol Neptune PP.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
No, I don't know that one.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Maybe Akuma JP or somebody in chat will know.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.000
God Something Idol.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.000
I don't know.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:08.000
This is American Idol.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
No Nicki Minaj in that game.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
I did mention, I think that,

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
I mentioned this on Twitter actually,

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:18.000
cause Nintendo does some weird stuff with their,

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
their item numbers for their games.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
And what was it for a new Luigi U?

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.000
It was PPRS is their item number.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:29.000
That's the best.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.000
So...

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Sorry, Akuma is asking for a link.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000
So I just gave it to him.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Let me quickly do the other countries.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Sorry, Jamie.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.000
I know you were ready to go there,

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
but I don't want to neglect the Wii U.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:39.000
I was just going to comment on that game.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Oh, okay.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.000
That you asked Akuma JP.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Oh, okay.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
So on the Wii U this week, nothing,

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
but you do have F1 Race Stars powered up edition

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.000
to look forward to next week.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000
So there you go.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
And lastly, on the 3DS this week,

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Kuma Tomo and Ninja Jajamaru-kun Sakurahime

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Tokaryu no Himitsu comes out from Hamster this week

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
on the Nintendo 3DS.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.000
So I remember I asked you about like,

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:10.000
you know, the lack of F0 at, you know, E3 this year.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Are you at least excited that, you know,

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:17.000
kind of Mario Kart 8 is sort of F0?

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Mm-hmm.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Slow 0?

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Before we get to the UK releases,

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.000
some comments and chat on that game.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Queen Simea says,

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Age of the Gods Idol Neptune?

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.000
And AlphaKananogram says,

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Sky, I think it's related to that Neptunia video game system

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.000
slash company-based girls but idol game.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
That actually seems like a very lot.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
That seems like a much better thought out response

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.000
than what I said.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000
So we'll go with that until Akuma JP can translate for us.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.000
All right.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Dark Sakura, what about the UK?

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Two games.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Neverwinter on PC and New Super Luigi Brothers U.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
When you first said Neverwinter,

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.000
I thought about Neverwinter Nights.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.000
So did I.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.000
And I looked at it and it's like, no.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.000
And I'm like, oh wait, no,

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
there's that free-to-play Neverwinter that actually,

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.000
I get emails on that all the time.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.000
That's it.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.000
It looks exciting.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:01.000
That is truly it.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.000
No.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Sorry UK friends.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.000
All right.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Just a couple more stories for you guys

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
in the classic game of the week.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Loki.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:13.000
All right.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
So let's see.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:20.000
I guess with the Xbox 360,

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
a lot of people aren't really happy about the fact

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.000
that they kind of put their video services behind a paywall.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Well, with the PlayStation 4,

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
that's not going to be the case.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
They're not going to kind of,

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
if you want to watch Netflix or something like that,

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.000
you don't have to have PlayStation Plus to do that.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.000
You can actually just view all of their video services,

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Netflix, Hulu, et cetera.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
So that's kind of nice that they're doing that.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
And free-to-play games, I guess,

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
aren't going to require PlayStation Plus,

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:54.000
but that's up to the publisher whether they do that or not.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:57.000
So there's still a chance that they might.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
I think that's kind of cool that they're doing that.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000
I think it's another selling point over Xbox One.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.000
I hate to be one of those people dog-piling on Microsoft,

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
but it is what it is, guys.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Sony offering that for free does make that PlayStation 4

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:17.000
a slightly more attractive living room box for some people.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Again, the Xbox One integrated Skype thing is neat.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.000
It's not $500 neat for me, but it's neat.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Something PS4 doesn't have, I guess.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Moving on to some sad news out of E3 for a lot of people,

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
and this is a boo at Sony.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.000
So for those of you that are about to call me a Sony fanboy

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
after tonight's episode, nope.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Here's a negative for Sony and a big, hearty boo to Sony for this.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Jack Trenton talking to Game Trailers saying

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:53.000
The Last Guardian is, quote, on hiatus.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Further quote, we got so many projects out there from so many great teams.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Projects never ultimately go away.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
So The Last Guardian is certainly not going away,

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.000
but it's on hiatus right now.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.000
A lot of back and forth with this game, you know.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Lita a while ago said that the game was still in development,

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
but, you know, now it's not.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
I heard that it was still in development, too.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.000
They were just like, it was kind of confusing.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.000
You know, this is just the new Final Fantasy versus XIII.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Or better yet, it's the new Duke Nukem Forever.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:25.000
They're putting it out for PlayStation 4.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
I think that's exactly what's happening,

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
is it's going to be a PlayStation 4 title,

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
and it's just taking its little time.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
Maybe next year.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Maybe next year.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
But in the meantime, instead of looking forward,

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:40.000
let's look back to a more classic time in video games history

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:45.000
with a segment we call The Classic Game of the Week.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Dark Soccer is going to reach into the gaming vault

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
and find a game that she thinks, hey, you ungrateful children

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:52.000
should be playing this game immediately.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Right now, break out your Neo Geo.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
You got a good one this week, Dark Soccer.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.000
What is the classic game?

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
I have to do my quote from the anime of this,

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.000
because the dub was so awful.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Feel the storm, it's coming.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Yeah, Dan actually quotes that all the time,

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
because my husband is a dork.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
It's from Fatal Fury.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Fatal Fury was the series that pretty much led into King of Fighters, you know.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:22.000
In fact, the first Fatal Fury was called Garo Densetsu, the King of Fighters.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:26.000
So the very first game, well, as it came out over here, actually,

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
it was Fatal Fury, King of Fighters.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:34.000
It came out for the arcade, of course, for Neo Geo CD, Mega Drive.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:38.000
It came out on the Sharp computer, the SNES, the PS2, Virtual Console.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.000
It's been on everything.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:45.000
And of course, it spawned its better known sequels, Fatal Fury 2 and Fatal Fury Special.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.000
There was also Fatal Fury 3, Road to the Final Victory,

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.000
a Real Bout Fatal Fury, Real Bout Fatal Fury Special,

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Real Bout Fatal Fury to the newcomers.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.000
There was a Real Bout Garo Densetsu Special,

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Dominated Mind, Fatal Fury Wild Ambition, Fatal Fury First Contact,

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:05.000
and Garo Mark of the Wolves, which is probably my favorite in the series,

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
because it was pretty badass.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:13.000
So anyway, with these games, the big mechanic that these fighting games brought in is that,

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
well, for the first one, you could only play three characters.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:18.000
You had Terry Bogard, you had Andy Bogard, and Joe Higashi,

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:24.000
who had to fight against some of the bad guys coming up in their way.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:31.000
The thing about this one is that it had sort of this multi-plane type of setting,

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:37.000
where you could dodge moves by jumping from the foreground to the background and vice versa.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:46.000
And as these evolved in later versions, it even had, I think it was on Fatal Fury 3?

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Yeah, it was. Fatal Fury 3, you could actually throw your enemies into the back platform

01:20:53.000 --> 01:21:00.000
or into the front, running directly pretty much into the crowd as a special ending move.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:05.000
I remember in the aquarium level, you could throw somebody into the aquarium,

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:09.000
and they'd just crack the glass and slump to the floor.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:16.000
So yeah, it was a really neat series, and like I said, it gave us the King of Fighters series,

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:22.000
which I'm sure as a lot of people know is probably one of my favorite fighting game series altogether.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:28.000
I myself have two of them on Neo Geo, which if you can play them on the Neo Geo, just do that,

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:33.000
because that is the way to play any type of SNK game.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:39.000
As far as the series goes, it actually had a sister series that was called Art of Fighting,

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:46.000
that was set in exactly the same universe, so it was why a lot of the characters crossed over.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Quick question, was World Heroes in that same universe?

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:53.000
I do not think World Heroes was, because none of the characters in World Heroes showed up in King of Fighters.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Okay, I thought there was another series where they started showing up in King of Fighters,

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:57.000
but I guess that wasn't World Heroes, was it?

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:02.000
Because as I started combining those universes, keep in mind that they threw in the Ikari Warriors universe.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Oh, yeah.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
They threw in Psycho Soldier.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:09.000
I kind of lost track of this. I like Fatal Fury a lot, actually, at the time.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Not so much the original, although I understand why it's worthy of the Classic Game of the Week,

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
but more like Special probably was my big one.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Fatal Fury Special was, I think, the one that I saw in the arcades most.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:25.000
But, I mean, it gave us my Shiranui and her boobs.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Which, such a big outcry about the character, I thought she was hilarious.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:38.000
She also was probably my favorite to play in that game next to Kim Kap Wan later on.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
Kim Kap Wan was my favorite.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Yeah, because, well, although if you're really good with Joe Higashi, you could apparently just smack anybody down because it was awesome.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Although I've seen a perfect playthrough, actually, I think this is an example of a perfect playthrough with Andy Bogard.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Really, all of the characters, in my opinion, were so well-balanced that if you knew them inside and out, you could really destroy anybody in this game.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:10.000
I mean, yeah, you had your good masher characters.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
I mean, yeah, I think that Mai was a masher character.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Yuri was a masher character.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:21.000
I mean, she has a lot of charge moves, but Yuri was a major masher character, especially with her flying butt powers.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:35.000
But for the most part, you know, it gave us such a huge list of characters, too, that, like I said, carried over into King of Fighters.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Like, even Ryo Sakazaki was in two of the Fatal Fury games, who was an Art of Fighting character.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:55.000
On top of that, this is the game that also, I mean, basically leading into Art of Fighting gave us one of our first big multi-game crossovers.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Which, I mean, now we have a versus series now, I think pretty much because of Fatal Fury and it leading into the King of Fighters series.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:15.000
You know, King of Fury, King of Fighters was pretty much Art of Fighting and Fatal Fury mixed with a few other SNK games.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.000
But that was our first big versus thing and led us into...

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Yeah, Capcom versus SNK 2, which wouldn't have been possible without these games, is probably like my favorite 2D fighter ever, which I'm sure a lot of people feel that way.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:30.000
And a lot of people want to say that it's, you know, the X-Men versus Street Fighter and all that.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:38.000
No, no, no, no. It started with KOF. I really think it started with KOF, which, like I said, came from Fatal Fury.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:46.000
And even in the Fatal Fury universe with Art of Fighting, Art of Fighting led to everybody's favorite joke character, Dan Hibiki.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Because it was a combination, his dad was supposed to be like a parody of Mr. Karate.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:58.000
And then he was, what was it, Robert Garcia and Ryo combined.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Tung-Fu-Ruu was so badass. I'm looking at the video right now where this guy is fighting Tung-Fu-Ruu. That guy was awesome.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:09.000
You know who else I was pretty good with? Duck King. Just because he was so hilarious.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:16.000
But yeah, and I'm not going to go into any more about the gameplay, because honestly, King of...

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:22.000
I'm not going to go back to King of Fighters. Fatal Fury was pretty generic as far as you have punches, you have special moves,

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:28.000
you have super moves. In the later games you built up meters, you had combos, you had all of the same stuff.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:41.000
But this one, the thing that really set it apart was that multi-plane fighting and the fact that it gave birth to an entire lineage of fighting games right after that.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:48.000
So I'm going to go for the whole Fatal Fury series just because of what came from it.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:55.000
And again, my favorite in the series is Garo Densetsu because I like playing as a rock coward.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.000
Classic Game of the Week.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:57.000
And Blue Mary.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Classic Game of the Week. Fatal Fury for the Neo Geo. Great pick.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:05.000
Again, another one of those picks you go, how many weeks have you done a Classic Game of the Week?

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:08.000
About 300 weeks now and somehow this never came up before?

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:11.000
How many different games have we had that happen with?

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.000
Daytona.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.000
Daytona.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.000
It's always funny. It's always funny.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:19.000
You didn't do Fatal Fury Special or Fatal Fury 2 one week?

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.000
I looked.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.000
Wow. Alright.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Then again, I didn't look under Garo Densetsu but I figured that if anyone was putting it down there they would have done either.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
The Wiki people are pretty good about that.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Alright, we've got plenty more to come in Part B tonight.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Fugu Question of the Week and more news, even stuff that's not just E3.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Your emails and yes, your phone calls when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Orange Lounge Radio

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Hi there, this is Elliott B and you're participating with Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:03.000
And I want to use my voice to tell you that Donkey Kong Country 2 is the best game ever released on the Super Nintendo.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:09.000
It has musical apes, fighting reptilian pirates, what more could you ask for?

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.000
Oh, I don't know, maybe a new Metroid instead, just saying.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Just saying, throwing it out there, no.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Thank you very much to Elliott for leaving that bumper.

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
I really appreciate it there.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.000
If you want to leave a bumper for us, more information available on our forum.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:28.000
The VOG Network forums, vognetwork.com and just look for the word forums at the top of the screen.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.000
It's not that hard to find.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:32.000
I appreciate Elliott taking the time to leave that for us.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:39.000
And yeah, it kind of reminds me to say something I didn't say in the first part of the show about the Donkey Kong reveal.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Which I realize has people like Elliott probably very excited.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:51.000
For me, I was like, I just bought a Donkey Kong game on 3DS literally weeks ago and now they're announcing another.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Now I realize the one on 3DS is a little different, but I was kind of like, I feel like Donkey Kong Overload.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:58.000
I could have gone for a new Metroid.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:04.000
It doesn't look that different, aside from, oh now the barrels will shoot you into the background.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:07.000
It's not exactly just 2D.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:10.000
To be fair though, those games are rock solid platformers.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:15.000
They're super fun and that's where I think that success is going to be in.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.000
No, I don't doubt it will be successful.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.000
TigerConChat says, Rob, actually I want a new Star Fox.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.000
That would be good.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
And not that adventure is bullshit either, but that would be good.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
A new Star Fox would be good.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
But nothing would top a new F-Zero.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:35.000
Maybe after this Mario Kart 8 thing, which does look good, maybe we can get that as our racing game for 2014.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
A man can dream.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:38.000
A man can dream.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:41.000
I also want to make sure we say at some point tonight a Happy Father's Day.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:46.000
I know we were busy talking about E3 in the beginning there, but let us not forget it is Father's Day.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:49.000
So Happy Father's Day to all the father or fatherly figures out there.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Especially our own Loki.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:57.000
Is Josh at the age where he can kind of recognize Father's Day yet?

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.000
No.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.000
And wish you a happy one?

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.000
No.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Not quite?

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:02.000
No.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Alright.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Well, maybe next time.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:09.000
If my BFF is listening, then tell Chris I said Happy Father's Day.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000
There you go.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:13.000
And tell Julian to clean his room to be nice.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:18.000
I'll wish Alan a Happy Father's Day because Sanrio the kitty is very well taken care of.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:21.000
And he sends me videos when I'm out of town and everything.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Even though she was very antisocial.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Big floof ball.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:27.000
I still need to get a good picture of her to put on the interwebs.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Well, is Alan ever going to come over here and talk to me about what he thought about E3 and all this stuff?

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Oh, we finally had the comment in chat, by the way.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Who that is? My baby daddy.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Yay, putting him on the spot.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Hi, Alan. Long time, no talk.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Hello.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.000
Welcome to the show.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Thank you.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Do you have anything you want to plug while you're here?

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:46.000
Everyone's saying that Microsoft killed Sony.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Or sorry, Sony killed Microsoft at E3, but more like Microsoft killed themselves and then Sony just showed up with pizza and a bag of weed.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Why y'all mad and sad? We got good shit here.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.000
I asked you if you had anything you wanted to plug and that was your answer.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:06.000
It was essentially pizza and weed, but that's alright.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:10.000
What? I don't run any shows. What would I plug?

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:16.000
You listen to other people's shows more than you listen to mine. Do you want to plug The Nerdist?

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:19.000
You know what? I'm all for the Alan show. Alan needs his own show.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:22.000
Alan does need his own show, but he's a little shy. Would you do your own show, Alan?

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.000
No.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:28.000
See? He wouldn't do it. He just walks on here, gives his witty commentary, and then leaves.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Any other observations about this year's E3?

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:39.000
There's a lot of really bad misinformation about the Xbox One, and I kind of feel bad for Microsoft even though they've brought it on themselves

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:43.000
because all the made-up shit about their console is completely believable, even if it's not true.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Oh, like the whole it's only launching in 21 states thing?

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Well, there's the 21 country IP address thing, but no, there was that post about if your account is banned,

01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:00.000
all of your licenses, even if it's attached to a physical disk, are deactivated, which is not true,

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:07.000
but that super fits into what they're legitimately doing, that it's super easy to believe something like that.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:10.000
It's everybody dogpiling on Microsoft. Let's kick them while they're down.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:14.000
How dare they implement these DRMs? Kick, kick, punch, punch.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Yeah, at the end of the console cycle that they're not going to shut off the servers, but that's years away.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Yeah, and I didn't know either. I just found this out yesterday.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:31.000
The 24-hour ping to make sure that your shit works, the internet connectivity.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:38.000
If you're playing your game at a friend's house under your account, it pings once an hour because it's not your console.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
It's a mess.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:47.000
And just so you know, Alan at live.vognetwork.com, let's see, rostielut agrees with you in part.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
Sony really only needed to show up.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Misty says, I approve of an Alan show.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:56.000
SSU100Matt says, Alan has plenty of drop the mic moments.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:59.000
Because I'm the best.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:03.000
Drop. All right, anything else quickly before we say bye and get into rapid fire news?

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
Sanrio is shy.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Yeah, she is. She's a good kitty though.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:11.000
All right, let's get into rapid fire news, Loki.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:21.000
All right. So, one of the things that they talked about during the Microsoft press conference is that they're going to be getting rid of the Microsoft points.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:26.000
So, how's that going to work now that I have Microsoft points? How's that going to convert?

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Well, they're just going to convert it over. They're going to take your space bucks and make them into actual bucks.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:37.000
So, in North America, 80 points or less to the dollar will exchange to that dollar.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:49.000
However, there is one little bullet point on there or asterisk, I guess, that when they do convert those into actual dollars, they must be spent within a year.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:56.000
Otherwise, you lose them, which is bullshit if you ask me.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:01.000
But then be the, you know, terms, I guess.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
That's kind of bullshit, I agree.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:11.000
But hopefully I didn't have enough left in my account where, you know, I'll buy one Xbox Live Arcade game and that's it.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:18.000
I still got 20 bucks because I tried buying a game for 20 bucks and it took money off my credit card instead of using the points that I already had.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Thank you.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:30.000
It's funny as I got two points cards for my birthday and I've only used one of them so that I could play stuff on rock band so that I could sing Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:31.000
Thank you.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:39.000
So now I think I'm just going to buy all the Mass Effect gear for my character, even though I don't touch it on the Xbox.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:50.000
Alright, another cool announcement is Twitch was saying that, you know, because they have a partnership with the Xbox One where it's going to be integrated in there so you can stream the Twitch.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:34:03.000
But it's also got this software development kit that actually will allow anybody to integrate it into their consoles to broadcast from any platform, including PlayStation 4 if they really wanted to.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
Wasn't the Ouya supposed to be getting a Twitch thing too?

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Ouya already has, it's a Twitch viewer. Basically it's an app that you can view Twitch streams on.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Ouya is probably not powerful enough to broadcast, I'm sorry.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:16.000
No.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:25.000
That's actually what I was thinking of because I think of the Twitch 360 app, I think of a viewer only, and I keep forgetting that this new console generation, oh no, it will broadcast as well.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:31.000
I don't think, yeah, I don't think it has enough power to do that, so whatever.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:36.000
But yeah, it's going to be cool that they can integrate this into a bunch of stuff.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:44.000
So I think it's very possible that we'll see that coming to, you know, the PlayStation 4 because they have Ustream and that's kind of like...

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:54.000
I think a little competition is healthy though, even though I don't particularly care for the way Ustream, I think the Nintendo Press, or Nintendo Direct through Ustream kind of says it all about Ustream.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:58.000
I think a little competition is healthy. I'd like to see more options than just Twitch out there.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Yeah.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:05.000
And last but not least, of course, they were talking about Summer of Arcade.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:12.000
It's coming August 7th and will include such titles as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Also a remake or reboot, if you will, of Flashback, the old 1992 classic.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:21.000
Brother is a Tale of Two Sons.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:26.000
And Charlie Murder, which is being done by the guys that did the Dishwasher game.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
So that should be good.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:37.000
And of course, no word if they're still doing that deal where you buy all the games and get money back type thing, any pricing.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:38.000
Or free games.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Or free games, so we'll have to wait.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:45.000
Alright, I got some news real quick. One of them about the game Ultima Forever.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Don't get too excited, it's not really a PC game, it's that iOS game, the Ultima iOS game that's being made.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:54.000
Some of the currency was really balanced this week.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:36:00.000
It's out in Canada because their EA tends to beta a lot of this type of stuff in Canada and then they release it in the US.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:05.000
How does that make our Canadian listeners feel that they're beta testers for this?

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Well, whatever, at least you're getting to play it.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:11.000
But they did some really big change with some of the currency prices.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:20.000
Apparently, in the game you have to repair items and it used to cost like 60 keys to repair certain items, so they've lowered that to like 8 to 10.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:25.000
And increasing storage space in your stash was lowered and so on and so on.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:30.000
So they're trying to not make it so crazy, I guess, where you're going to feel like you're forced to buy things.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:37.000
However, the highest quality chests, they went up in price as part of this balancing, so I guess not everything was a win.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:42.000
Interesting talk out there about the new Zelda game.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Look, we all know there's going to be a new Zelda game.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:49.000
It will probably be the big thing that Nintendo shows in 2014.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:52.000
But the producer of the series said something interesting this week.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:57.000
Eiji Aonuma said this week that he's a big fan of Skyrim.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:00.000
And this is very interesting.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:05.000
So he was asked if he was looking at any other titles for inspiration for the new Zelda game.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
He said, Skyrim.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:11.000
Obviously, I play other games and I'm curious what Zelda fans like about the Skyrim experience.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Maybe there are some Zelda fans who are looking for something similar out of a Zelda game.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:17.000
But I don't look at the technology that made these games possible.

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
I don't look at what's happening in the game, but how it made me feel.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:24.000
What in the game moved me and how I can bring out those same emotions to players who play my games.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:28.000
My intent isn't to copy them, but those are the things that stay with you as a player.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:31.000
It's not what you see about the game that makes you feel...

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Excuse me.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:37.000
It's not what you see, but how the game makes you feel that makes you feel closer to the experience.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:40.000
It's more about the feeling and expression of emotions in the game.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:43.000
And I do take that into consideration when working on my own projects.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:48.000
So, could Link be taking the arrow to the knee in the next installment?

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Alright, no. Obviously, it's not...

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:50.000
I think open world is what they're...

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Well, actually, most of the games are open world, so...

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Yeah, I'm thinking, too, like, you know, maybe a lot of the...

01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:00.000
In Skyrim, you tend to really be able to interact with everything.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
Maybe that's part of it, too.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Maybe building more side quests. I don't know. It could be interesting.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:08.000
I always thought, you know how in Wind Waker, how there...

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:09.000
Well, spoiler.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:12.000
There's a portion of it where you go under the sea.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
And you see, under the sea.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
You see the 3D world that's down there.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:19.000
And I'm like, why wasn't this Wind Waker?

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
Because that would have been amazing.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:25.000
So, I'm hoping that it's something like that, but, you know, better graphics.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:33.000
Did they maybe include that in the remake of Wind Waker HD?

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Life under the sea is better than anything they got up there.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:49.000
To seaweed is always greener.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
Everything looks better in HD.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:52.000
You dream of...

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:53.000
Alright, forget it.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
Also, something else about Nintendo.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
Retro is actually coming out.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Funny, we had that discussion earlier in the show.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Retro saying that it was hard to decide between Metroid and Donkey Kong.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
You made the wrong choice. Just saying.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:09.000
I'm just kidding. Alright, Donkey Kong fans, put your torches down.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Put your torches down.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:15.000
I think that was just kind of an off-the-cusp comment that Michael Kelbaugh,

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
who's the president and CEO of Retro Studios,

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:22.000
told the official Nintendo magazine via Twitter between the two.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:26.000
I'm sure the Metroid game will happen sometime this generation.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
It's just not right now.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:31.000
Also, what I found interesting about the new Super Mario 3D world,

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
I think what a lot of people are very excited about is that

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:36.000
the Mario and Luigi characters that are in the game

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:40.000
play like they do in Super Mario 2 on the NES.

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
And if you think about it, we haven't really seen a game

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:46.000
implement the characterization of those characters since that game.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
You know, with Peach floating and all that.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
So that was really cool that they brought that back.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Well, Peach wasn't originally planned as a playable character in Mario 3D World.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Because you know in the last few games, it's been Mario, Luigi, and the two totes.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:00.000
Because female protagonists do not sell games.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
Really?

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:06.000
Obviously, he said that with his tongue firmly planted in cheek.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:11.000
Well, you know, Nintendo got a lot of kudos this week for announcing

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
some really awesome female characters.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Not just Peach, but the Wii Fit Trainer as a character in Super Smash Bros.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:21.000
I thought that was cool, and I'm glad that there were no rape jokes

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
during their presentation of Smash Bros.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
That's a whole other Oprah.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
Alright, anyhow.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:30.000
And he's referring to what happened to the Microsoft thing if you didn't know.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Anyhow, a comment from Yoshiaki Koizumi said,

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:39.000
quote, I think she adds a lot of the sense of completion

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
when you get in multiplayer.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
You can have different people choosing different characters

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
based on their personality or whoever they like.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:48.000
And Princess Peach is just really a lot of fun to play.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:51.000
But yeah, Peach was not originally a playable character in the game.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Which means the plot isn't that they're rescuing her for a change.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:59.000
So that's good, I think.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
And hell, I like playing as Princess Peach.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
That float ability is badass.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:07.000
She's kind of actually like way better than the others

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:08.000
because of that ability.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
But maybe this game will be more balanced than Mario 2 was.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
We'll see.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:13.000
Dark Sakura.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
Oh, my iPad just completely crashed on me.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.000
Give me a second.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:17.000
Oh, hooray.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:18.000
I know.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:21.000
All that porn, you know, Rob.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
It's crashing our show.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:26.000
So coming out is going to be Pac-Man Museum Collection.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:31.000
It's going to be on various different digital releases.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:37.000
It's supposed to include the Championship Edition and Pac-Man Battle Royale.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:42.000
And it's going to be on Xbox Live Arcade, PSN, PC, 3DS, and the Wii U eShop.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:45.000
So that is going to be super awesome cool.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:49.000
Which is funny because I was playing Super Pac-Man just the other day.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:53.000
And then also a trademark in the US is Contra Run and Gun.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:42:01.000
It's a – well, they did tease a new Contra at E3 in 2011.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
But now we actually have a trademark to go with it.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:12.000
And last but not least, the inspiration for our Neil before VOG logo that went a while back.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
Which not a lot of people got, unfortunately.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:15.000
It was our teaser.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
But maybe now that there's a movie out, which I want to see.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.000
You want to see the new movie, The Man of Steel?

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.000
I want to see that.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Becky went and saw it today and said it was okay, but the end of it took forever.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:23.000
Hmm, interesting.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:26.000
So anyway – oh, thank you, Geico ad for running.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:33.000
Anyway, so for Injustice Gods Among Us, a new character is going to be added and it is Zod.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Neil before Zod, son of Jor-El.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Which better be said in the movie.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
He better freaking – yeah.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
I don't want spoilers in chat.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
I will slap you with a trout if you spoil.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
If you spoil, we spank.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
All right.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Let's get to the foogle question of the week.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:56.000
Every week we ask a question on our Facebook and Google Plus communities.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:01.000
Slam it together and you get foogle.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
This week's question was all about E3.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
Because, you know, that's what every show wants to know.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
What did you think about E3, right?

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:10.000
But we put a little twist on it.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:15.000
Because, you know, everybody's talking about the freaking consoles and the whole, you know,

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
everything we talked about in the first 30 minutes of the show tonight.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:21.000
So I want to say, what were you excited about that maybe other people missed?

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
So that was the question.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
We'd like to know your thoughts on E3, but with a twist.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:28.000
You can't talk about the big press conferences or the new consoles.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:31.000
I know, I know, but there will be plenty of other time on tonight's show to talk about all that.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:36.000
We're looking for what you were excited to hear about that maybe slipped off someone else's radar

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:42.000
amongst all the Sony versus Microsoft press conference with a side of Nintendo Direct chatter.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:43.000
So let's get to some of the answers.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:46.000
I'll start with Google Plus tonight, because I haven't been starting with them a lot lately,

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
so I want to show them some love.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:52.000
ActDeft on Google Plus says, well, this technically counts as one of the big announcements,

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:55.000
but I'm hyped to see a new Mirror's Edge in the works.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:56.000
I'll let it slide.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:01.000
Hopefully the wait won't be as long and the game will be great as the first one, if not more.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
Deft, I'm going to say 2014.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:06.000
It's definitely not, they're not talking like it's 2013 game.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
It's not 2013.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:11.000
Flaco Jones says, I was excited to see gameplay from the enemy within.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:15.000
If they keep to their word and go back to the roots of what makes survival horror great,

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
then it should be an awesome experience.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
Yeah, that was a comment from Bethesda coming through.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:25.000
One of the first things on the E3.MOG network experience was that they are going back to survival horror roots

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:26.000
with the enemy within.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:29.000
I heard that it's supposed to be really, really gross.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:32.000
Yay, gross games, except not really.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:37.000
I don't like gross games, but I know there are other people that are into the gross games, so enjoy it.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Going to some of the responses on Facebook.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:47.000
James S says, I feel like the game Killer is Dead might be the one that a lot of people didn't see anything on,

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:50.000
but it's definitely a current gen title that people should be checking out.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:56.000
It looks pretty damn awesome and it's one of the very few current gen titles that are coming out during the remainder of this year.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Also, Dark Souls 2, need I say more?

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Sadly, I don't think it's going to do very well because it comes out right at the same time as Splinter Cell

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:09.000
and Saints Row and Madden and...

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
I think there's an audience for it.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:17.000
As long as we can still get that mod on the PC version that instead of whenever you get you died,

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
when you die it goes, thanks Obama.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
Have you heard about that hack?

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:22.000
What?

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:25.000
You know the thanks Obama meme, right?

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:30.000
Well, somebody made a hack for Dark Souls where every time you die,

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:35.000
instead of it coming up saying you died in the big dramatic text, it comes up and says, thanks Obama.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
It's funny.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
It's funny.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:44.000
All right, Clerical Error 404, one of the peeps from Koopa Club.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:48.000
By the way, I'm supposed to be going on that show in the near future, so stay tuned for that.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:53.000
The Clerical Error 404 says, there were a number of games that were announced that I was excited to hear about.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:57.000
Mirrors Edge 2, Super Mario 3D World, because you can play as Peach in the cat suits,

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:02.000
Super Smash Brothers for the 3DS version and the additional characters, Kingdom Hearts 3, duh.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:06.000
I wasn't happy with the announcement of the direction that Metroid is planning to take,

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:11.000
basically expanding on the characters of the universe and making a gallery of other bounty hunters besides Samus.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:14.000
And why no new 2D cel-shaded Castlevania?

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
I know a pipe dream, but still.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
All right.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Haseo Sumeruwagawa says, Mirrors Edge 2, my boyfriend and I are so excited,

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:27.000
but I'm also excited for Kingdom Hearts 3 and Final Fantasy XIV and XV.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:33.000
Burr says, I'm a bit excited about what I saw of the new Sonic game, Lost World.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:38.000
I know I'm probably in for a letdown, but Sonic Generations was a bit of a surprise, so this could be too.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Mason D, I love this answer. This is so win.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:46.000
The thing most out of E3, Miyamoto likes In-N-Out Burger, confirmed,

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:50.000
with the picture of Miyamoto at the In-N-Out truck that was in the parking lot at E3.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:54.000
I kept seeing that popping up all over Facebook. It was hilarious.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
That is great, though.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:59.000
Ronnie B says, The Mirrors Edge reboot is all I care about.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:04.000
I think it's extremely impressive EA of all companies managed to seemingly keep everything in its original format.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:08.000
I hope they don't nickel and dime the game to death, though, otherwise it looks impressive like the first.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:12.000
I hope the music is equally respected. A lot of love for that new Mirrors Edge game.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
The trailer music was awesome.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:18.000
Clover N says, The Metal Gear Solid V trailer looks absolutely amazing.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:23.000
I hope the controls, for the most part, don't stray too far from the controls of the past Metal Gear Solid games.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:27.000
That was a hell of a way to start off the Microsoft conference.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:32.000
Say what you will about what went down there, but that was a great kickoff.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:39.000
Rageinator says, I was excited to hear about Killer Instinct, one of my favorite fighter series from back in the day, being brought back from the dead.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:45.000
I was also kind of hoping for some major E3 flubs that would become memes akin to Sony's 2006 presser.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Well, I think there were some. Nuclear subs, anybody?

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:55.000
Matt J says, While I haven't read too much about it, I'm currently most excited for Deus Ex The Fall.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Haters can say what they want, but I think it's an interesting chapter in the Deus Ex game series.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:02.000
In case you don't know, Deus Ex The Fall is an iOS Android title.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:05.000
It's a sequel to the Deus Ex novel, Icarus Effect.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:08.000
A lot of folks are bitching because it's a mobile title, not a console or PC title.

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:11.000
However, I find it looks interesting and potentially a fun game.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:18.000
I'm a die-hard Deus Ex fan and excited by the prospect of a mobile, on-the-go game, something not easily done with the other titles.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:22.000
I'm willing to at least give it a shot, unlike most folks who refuse to even acknowledge it.

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:29.000
You know, a lot of people have a smartphone, and they might say they're not going to play it all they want, but then when it's like 99 cents, they're like, ooh, gimme.

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:37.000
Tigerclaw says, I'm pretty excited about New Super Mario 3D World, Mario in a catsuit, but Princess Peach would look cuter in the catsuit in my opinion.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:45.000
She does look cute, but the keyword is cute, and not, like, oversexed, which I think is a good thing. Right, Jamie?

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:48.000
Yes, it's actually, it looks like those little pajamas.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:49.000
It's tasteful.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:50.000
Yes it is, it's adorable too.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:56.000
By the way, I saw somebody at E3 in a Pikachu footy pajama thing, head to toe.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:57.000
Yeah.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:04.000
And I'm kinda like, alright dude, you go on with your bad self, but then I'm kinda like, why do people dress up for E3 like that?

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:05.000
It's not the place for that.

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:06.000
It's not the place for that.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
It's not Tokyo Game Show.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:09.000
No.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:10.000
Or actually it would be Comiket.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:11.000
And it's not PAX.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
But anyway, that's a whole nother episode.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:18.000
I'm also looking forward to Mario Kart 8. Too bad we'll have to wait to 2014 for those two.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:23.000
The new game on Mad Max would be interesting, even though there has already been a Mad Max game on the NES.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:28.000
This one being made by the developers of Just Cause. I remember the Mad Max game on the NES.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:31.000
That's, uh, boy oh boy.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:40.000
Anyway, Gamer Girl says, mostly excited for, I know it's not PS4 exclusive, but Final Fantasy Realm Reborn, Lightning Returns, and the new Kingdom Hearts.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
I think you're a Square Enix fangirl.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:51.000
Andy R. says, I listened to last week's OLR after Monday and hearing all the ragging on, well if Microsoft's doing it then Sony must be doing it too, was really amusing to me.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:54.000
Sorry Loki, I'll admit I chuckled at your cynicism a few times.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:57.000
Before the pressers I was worried too though, so I can't be too hard on you.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:00.000
That aside, I was rather impressed with Destiny.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:04.000
I don't care for MMOs or FPSs, but the gameplay shown looked really fun.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:09.000
And though we were all, although we all knew a new Smash Brothers was coming, I was pretty excited to buy the reveal.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:12.000
That and Bayonetta 2 might convince me to buy a Wii U.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:18.000
Shane replied, saying nothing but Final Fantasy XIV about 14 times, copy pasted.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
It's beautiful.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:24.000
And then Let's Have Tea, I always love that name, good to hear from you Let's Have Tea.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:30.000
Let's Have Tea says, your thoughts on the Xbox One family sharing feature and if you guys have even heard of it.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:35.000
It's probably the best feature of the Xbox One and a feature that Microsoft keeps seeming to forget to mention.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Now Let's Have Tea, as much as I love your name, I said no talking about the pressers.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:42.000
But yes, I do believe we did mention that earlier in the show, right Loki?

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:43.000
Yeah.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:44.000
So, there you go.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:50.000
And yes, it does sound interesting, it's just that it's not worth the DRM trade off, that's my opinion.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:51.000
And I'm sticking to it.

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:56.000
Those are your answers at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and Google Plus.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
Search for Orange Lounge Radio.

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
There you go.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
That's the FUGO Question of the Week.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:03.000
Some more news for you guys.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:07.000
Mailbag, FUs of the Week, Twitter, Skype, all coming up in a little bit.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:08.000
Loki.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:09.000
Who reads the mail anyway?

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:10.000
You do.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:11.000
Get ready for it.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:12.000
Okay.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Alright, so Gearbox is facing a lawsuit, and now it's not over aliens, colonial marines, but it's Duke Nukem Forever.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:31.000
Apparently, Gearbox, of course, you know, after the resumed development of Duke Nukem Forever,

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:45.000
kind of failed to give the, I guess, was it the payoff, a 2.9 million dollar loan that 3D Realms owed, I guess, to an unnamed company.

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:56.000
And apparently also there are some royalties that were due as well, and they just haven't taken care of that yet.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:07.000
And apparently, according to the Gearbox VP of Marketing, Steve Gibson,

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:16.000
the reality is Apogee and 3D Realms receive the full benefit of its bargain, Gearbox in fulfillment of its commitments.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:20.000
I don't know if you've fulfilled your commitments because the game is kind of crap, but whatever.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
I guess, finished game.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:30.000
EnRish 3DR saved 3DR from its debts and rescued 3DR from its litigation surrounding failed dozens.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:42.000
So I guess the way it sounds like that they think that because they kind of paid off their debts that they don't get any sort of kickback from Duke Nukem Forever.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:45.000
Although, I can't imagine it would be that big because I don't think it sold that well.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
But yeah, court case.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:56.000
It's always sad when they're fighting over a game that really wasn't worth fighting over in the end.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
But money's money, right?

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:06.000
Well, I mean, it was really weird with Aliens, Clone-O, Marines, and 3D Realms and stuff,

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:12.000
because I remember they were talking about misappropriation of money with Aliens, Clone-O, Marines, and going to Borderlands 2.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:21.000
I'm wondering if anything similar happened with the royalties for Duke Nukem Forever and going to Borderlands 2 as well.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:27.000
Alright, well, Loki, I know you cared about this because you were asking some questions about it at E3.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:30.000
I didn't see it at E3, but I think Bobby got a quick look at it.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:34.000
It's Mad Catz's Android console. It's just called Mojo now.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:37.000
It's not Project Mojo or any of that anymore. It's called Mojo.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:44.000
And unlike Ouya or what have you, Mojo will run stock Android and connects to the Google Play Store, just like any other smartphone or tablet.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:50.000
So all you need for a game to be playable on Mojo is that it has to come out for Android.

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:53.000
And you can tie the Mojo device to your Google Play account.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:59.000
So essentially, this is just literally an Android box for your TV. Literally.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Yeah, and what's kind of cool about it, though, is it does support games that don't support controllers.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:13.000
So you can map your controls on the system. They also have emulation for touch controls using a mouse.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:21.000
You can plug in a mouse and keyboard, or you can just use the analog sticks to emulate touch controls as well.

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:26.000
And then you can also map all your controls for whatever game on there.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
I mean, that's pretty awesome that you can do that.

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:31.000
And on the show floor, it was running on a Tegra 3 processor.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:40.000
It had HDMI output at 1080p, two USB inputs, 16 gigs of onboard storage that you can expand with Mini SD, Bluetooth Classic, Bluetooth Smart.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:43.000
And they're saying, though, this is all subject to change.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Yeah, and I like how they have the two different Bluetooth protocols there, too, because right now they support the classic Bluetooth stuff.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:59.000
But they also have the new Bluetooth 4.0 stuff where it's going to drop the latency down to very little, and it's going to make it pretty good for gaming.

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:07.000
And I'm wondering if they will increase or put a better processor in there, but Tegra 3 still, though, that means it's pretty cheap.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:14.000
It runs on Tegra 3, and that's going to be, you know, that's 100 bucks, so probably looking around that price range.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:21.000
And it's nice so that it supports Android apps, just generic Android apps, because, you know, probably a lot of people have that stuff.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:26.000
It's going to be a very interesting little counter to the Ouya. We'll see what happens.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:27.000
Yeah.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:28.000
Moving on.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:36.000
Yes, we have some Nintendo news. Actually, something come, I can never pronounce his last name right, Reggie Fils-Aime, right?

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:37.000
Yeah, Fils-Aime.

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
That's exactly it, okay. Very French.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:48.000
He basically has gone on record saying that he has the key to limiting used game sales, and that's making better games.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:54.000
Making games that people are going to want to replay, making them, like, here's a quote from him.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:58.000
He says, the consumer wants to keep playing Mario Kart. The consumer wants to keep playing New Super Mario Brothers.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
They want to keep playing Pikmin.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:08.000
So we see that the trade-in frequency on Nintendo content is much less than the industry average, much, much less.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:12.000
And, you know, I have to look at it in terms of my own collection.

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:18.000
We really do get, when we trade anything in, it's almost always something that was on the 360.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:25.000
Most of our PS3 games and our Wii games actually still have a lot of replayability. We still play our GameCube games.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:28.000
So, yeah, I actually really do agree.

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:35.000
You know, you may be thinking that these are really simplistic games, but they do have high replayability value.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:42.000
Like, for example, out of your collection, Rob, what do you say that you've played the most of?

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
Out of all?

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:47.000
What games do you always find yourself going back to play?

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:48.000
MMOs.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:51.000
Well, okay. Besides MMOs. Those don't count.

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:56.000
Games with the solid multi-, things that I can play with my friends. I mean, that usually is MMOs.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:01.000
But, like, Mass Effect 3 was a good example because the multiplayer mode added a lot of life to that game.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
It did a whole lot with that one.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:09.000
But I think the thing, too, is that, like, okay, for example, any time that we have a party at my house, what happens?

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
We bust out Rock Band.

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:12.000
Good point, yeah.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
It's the big thing that has the replayability.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:20.000
It used to be back in the day we'd bust out Smash Brothers or Mario Party or Mario Kart.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
We'd bring out a racing game that we could four screen.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Something that, you know, you could kind of screw with your friends and not feel bad about it because it was cute.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:31.000
Solid multiplayer goes a long way in a game's life.

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:36.000
And I'm not necessarily talking about just online, but, like, you know, having that old standby.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:40.000
What was the first thing, though, that everybody else was saying, though, when Animal Crossing came out?

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
Give me your friend code. I need your village code.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
Yeah, right.

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
I need a peach. Who's got a peach?

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
Come over to shake your trees.

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:56.000
I think the whole strength that Nintendo games have like this is that instead of just having your friends list, you're building a community around the IP.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:59.000
And I think that that also adds to their replayability.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:03.000
And, yeah, you do see a lot fewer Nintendo games traded in.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:07.000
The street passing on Animal Crossing is so smart, too, because I love looking at other people's homes.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
Yeah.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:13.000
I also, by the way, was enjoying the Sahara quotes.

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
I can't wait till I get my coffee.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
All right.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
I love that, though.

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:22.000
Just make better games. You want people to stop selling them? Make them better.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
Well, and it's simple.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:27.000
I mean, I'll tell you this even.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:31.000
I go back and play SNES games all the time.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:35.000
I mean, we're all kind of in that boat where we're classic gamers, too.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:45.000
But I like to go back and play older games that I think are just still fun.

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:48.000
I mean, we've even gone back and had Bomberman parties.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:51.000
I mean, who doesn't like a good game of Bomberman?

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:56.000
It's a game that's pretty much lasted through the years.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:59:00.000
It's solid. And that's what I think Nintendo's focusing on is making solid games.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
So, anyway.

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:06.000
Queen Simia in our chat room is, I think, singing about Peaches, saying,

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:09.000
Really love your Peaches. Want to shake your tree?

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:12.000
I can't help it. Suddenly I'm thinking of the Teaches of Peaches.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
It's a song.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
It's the lyric from a song.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:21.000
I know, but now I'm thinking of Peaches, the dirty, dirty musician from Canada who sings all the, you know.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:24.000
Or now I'm thinking of the presidents of the United States.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:27.000
What else is in the Teaches of Peaches?

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:30.000
Oh, millions of Peaches.

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:34.000
I don't know. You can't go wrong with the Joker, so.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:37.000
All right, save us from the Peach talk, Logie.

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
Really? We have to do that? No.

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:40.000
Okay.

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
We can talk Princess Peach.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
Okay.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:50.000
So, one of the theories, and definitely a theory I had, you know, with a whole, you know, a lot of people suspected,

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:59.000
EA getting rid of their online pass just before the announcement of the Xbox One and its features.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:10.000
EA, though, saying that, hey, even though PlayStation 4 came out and revealed that they're not going to be kind of following suit with the Xbox One,

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:14.000
they are still not going to bring back the online pass.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:20.000
And also set, you know, of course reaffirmed that, you know, getting rid of the online pass was not because of the Xbox One.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
They say that it just wasn't working out for them.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
And I don't know the belief from it.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:28.000
I kind of, on one hand, want to just say, I don't buy it.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:32.000
Because I think that they were kind of banking on both systems doing that.

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:37.000
But at the same time, maybe they have figured out that they're just making a lot more money from DLC.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:43.000
And instead of making it harder for people to, you know, or less desirable for people to buy their games, you know,

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:48.000
whether it be buying it new or buying used and have them pay an online pass,

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:53.000
just make it easier for people to buy games and then just have a ton of DLC.

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:59.000
You know, I don't know if necessarily nickelene and diamond, but they've attempted to do that with, you know, like Dead Space 3 and stuff.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:02.000
So maybe that's where they're kind of seeing it.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:07.000
And I think that kind of makes sense also with the Xbox One and their game sharing,

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
is that's where they're probably going to try to make a lot of their money,

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:14.000
is since you're not buying copies of the games and you're going to get a lot less sales now because of that,

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:17.000
that DLC is going to be more profitable.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:21.000
I know you all love it when we keep bringing this game up, but Mass Effect 3 really did it great.

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:28.000
I mean, there's not just the free DLC, but, you know, then there's the, all the story DLC was so good, you know.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
Well, especially with the big apology.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:36.000
To be fair, it was probably better in Mass Effect 2 overall, but I mean, still a good example of DLC done right.

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:42.000
None of it flat out sucked. You can't sit there and go to the DLC. Well, maybe like the armor packs.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
There were things that you could complain about later.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:45.000
Yeah.

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:50.000
Like, really? Is that what happens in Omega? I'm sorry, did I mention a particular one? Sorry.

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:56.000
Although I did completely find the Citadel DLC absolutely hilarious. Just saying.

02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:05.000
And then, of course, they're saying that now they're working on this gamer first use game policy for next gen.

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:13.000
Basically, I don't know what exactly that means. Gamers first and customer first.

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:19.000
Does that mean that there are going to be no restrictions at all, or are they going to try something else?

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:34.000
I don't know. I'm guessing that it's not this idea. Although, I think it's made it, you know, definitely the response to the Xbox One DRM and, you know, limiting use game sales and online passings.

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:43.000
I definitely think that publishers are aware of the perception of that, and I think they will maybe think twice about implementing that in the future.

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:54.000
Especially if Sony's not doing it anymore, and EA's not doing it anymore, who's really left? Warner Games and Ubisoft. That's it.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:59.000
Ubisoft has their whole little tie-in service to Uplay. They can invest in that.

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:03.000
It's still, though, they have, that could still be free, but right now they're still passing.

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:10.000
THQs can't do it anymore because they're out of business, and Deep Silver is not continuing with that, I think. I'm pretty sure they're not, because they didn't with Metro.

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:14.000
So, it's kind of on its way out already.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:24.000
Alright, before we get to the next story, a very interesting breaking news that a lot of our chatters are talking about is a tweet that just showed up from Bobby.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:33.000
My house just got struck by lightning. That's why he disappeared from chat. Most of my electronics are fried. I'm fine.

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:34.000
Holy crap.

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:43.000
But Bobby seems like the type that would have had a surge protector on everything. He was telling me to get the power source for the computer when all that stuff went down with one of the live shows.

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:47.000
But a surge protector isn't a cure-all, trust me.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
Well, I hope everything's okay. I hope when he's...

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
I've had a hard drive melted that was hooked to a surge protector.

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:59.000
Yeah, I'm hoping when he says fried that he means like they're just, you know, all they need is a quick little fix or something, but that's...

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:04.000
Seeing that Bobby does a lot with electronics, especially the VOG, that's a big deal.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:07.000
Well, just stay in touch with us and let us know what we need to do if he can hear.

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:11.000
What's up with lightning and taking out people that do like tech blog stuff?

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
Because usually they're connected.

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:16.000
Ours Technica, you know, the guy actually got hit by lightning.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:19.000
Because they can't stop cranking out lightning video games.

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:25.000
Well, when I was living with my ex-remate, and this is, you know, back in the days of dial-up,

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:36.000
but we still had a surge protector on both the power supply and on the cable, the internet cable,

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:44.000
and still with a direct shot from lightning to her antenna, we fried her hard drive. And the modem.

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:47.000
It's really good that he didn't have, you know, an Xbox One connected at this time,

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:51.000
because literally a lightning strike would turn it into a killing death machine.

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:55.000
So, you know, it's a good thing that we're still months away.

02:04:55.000 --> 02:05:01.000
Well, I hope everything's alright, because I know his day job relies on electronics and all that.

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:05.000
Yeah, I agree with VX JasonXV who said hopefully you just meant that figuratively.

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:09.000
Yeah, I hope so too. I hope so too. We'll find out soon.

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:15.000
Moving on, let me get back to the gaming news we had on deck tonight.

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:22.000
Nintendo could be releasing a free-to-play game. I know. It would be within the fiscal year,

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:28.000
which would end on March 2014. It was during an analyst briefing at E3 that this was announced.

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:32.000
So this is something that's actually happening. It's not a Mario game, it's not a Pokemon game.

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:36.000
But it could be an already existing franchise to a brand new IP.

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:41.000
Now, Destructoid had an interesting theory that it could be an Advance Wars game,

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:46.000
because that would seem to fit in very well. I mean, it makes a lot of sense for what could show up on the Wii U,

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:49.000
and would work with the free-to-play model generally well.

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:56.000
Even though a lot of people associate free-to-play with shit games, there's some free-to-play games that are pretty cool.

02:05:56.000 --> 02:06:00.000
What about, like, if it's an MMO, they could be Dragon Quest X?

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:05.000
No, because that would involve Square Enix. This is a Nintendo thing.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
Nintendo would not have announced a Square Enix game like that.

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
They could be publishing it over here.

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:12.000
I love your thought, but no. Just no.

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:20.000
I would love to be wrong about that. I would love to, but I kind of doubt it.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:25.000
Alright, let's get to the mailbag. I don't doubt that you guys send us emails every week.

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
And we answer the emails here on the program.

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:32.000
Yeah, yeah.

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:35.000
I'm sure it's been filling up a little bit after E3.

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:36.000
Well, we have four.

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:36.500
Okay.

02:06:36.500 --> 02:06:38.000
Four legit. Four legit.

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
The first one comes from Robert M.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:45.000
Right now, MCPE is my only Minecraft.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
Excuse me, not counting the Lego set.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:51.000
Because it's much more convenient for me during commuting and breaks.

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:58.000
Unfortunately, Realms won't be of much use to me at home, since the app freezes when I open it connected to my home Wi-Fi.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:05.000
This does not seem to affect other apps, and I can't access local multiplayer with no issue on other Wi-Fi.

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:07.000
Sorry.

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:11.000
I don't expect anyone to be able to tech support on this, just odd.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:17.000
Setting fireplace in log cabin with Neather, rack flame, poor outcome.

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
That says haiku.

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
No. Cute.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:22.000
Yeah.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:23.000
So yeah.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:27.000
Well, I'm not sure why the issue is with your local Wi-Fi.

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:38.000
Although, oddly enough, there's certain apps that I have that require a connection that won't necessarily work on my Wi-Fi, but they'll work on the 3G and they'll work elsewhere.

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:43.000
Maybe the problem is related to why the station keeps fucking dropping while we're trying to do a show.

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
Maybe we have the same provider. I don't know.

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
Howdy sentient creatures.

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:52.000
After listening to episode 507, I have two thoughts.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
First of all, a haiku.

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:57.000
I was right, but I didn't want to be right.

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
Damn, The Last Guardian.

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:02.000
Second, I have a holiday-style greeting for E3.

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:05.000
Happy hyperbolic statement period.

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
Stay black, redertainment trainer.

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:10.000
Alright.

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
Sometimes it's painful to be right.

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:16.000
This is from Sam.

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
And the message is, happy E3, OLR crew.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:25.000
One game I failed to see from Ubisoft this E3 is Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Patriots.

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:29.000
Do you think the game has been renamed and re-revealed as Tom Clancy's The Division?

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:31.000
I wouldn't think-

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:32.000
No, no.

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:35.000
Do you think Ubisoft has more than one team on Tom Clancy games?

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:36.000
Yeah, I think so.

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:37.000
Well, yeah, they definitely do.

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:38.000
I wouldn't be surprised.

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:41.000
I don't think- no, it's not even- doesn't even look similar at all.

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:44.000
It's probably just something- they have Blacklist coming out now.

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:49.000
I think it's probably being made now for next gen, and so it's just, you know-

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:50.000
Bump back a little bit.

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:51.000
Yeah, I think so.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:52.000
Fair enough.

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:55.000
Sorry, I was answering your question.

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:56.000
I'm with Loki.

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:57.000
It could be quarter four next year.

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
That makes sense, I think.

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
So I was answering your question in chat.

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:05.000
I happened to mention that my ex-roommate from college got struck by lightning.

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
Came in smelling that buzzy smell.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:09.000
Ew.

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:10.000
With her hair sticking up.

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:11.000
Ew.

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:12.000
And she just said,

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
I got struck by lightning.

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
And I was like, Meglet, are you okay?

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:17.000
Her name was Meg, we called her Meglet.

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
I was like, are you okay?

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
Yeah, I'm gonna lay down.

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
And she didn't get up the rest of the day.

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:24.000
I kept checking on her.

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
She got up and she was just fine.

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:30.000
You have a lot of weird stories.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:33.000
And then she said it was the second time in her life she'd been struck by lightning.

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
Go buy a lottery ticket, Meglet.

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:36.000
Seriously.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
I just asked Bobby if it took out the fence.

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:42.000
You're such an asshole.

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:45.000
He probably lost some of his computers and stuff.

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
You're like, did I hit the fence?

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:48.000
Bobby, I'm sorry for laughing.

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
It makes me a horrible human being.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
I've been in your place.

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:55.000
His kitties were at the boarding thing.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
He can't pick them up until Monday.

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
So the cats aren't affected, just so you guys know.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:00.000
That's important.

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:01.000
Yay for the kitties.

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
Think of the kitties.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:04.000
Last email, Rob.

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
And this one is a poem.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
Written by Degenerate Johnny.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
Shall I read it?

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:11.000
Yes.

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
Once again, E3 has lived up to its name.

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
The event has proven it's still relevant.

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:18.000
Gamers rejoiced at the sight of upcoming titles.

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:22.000
And judging from the drool puddles, E3 is also salivant.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:26.000
Microsoft promises a year of excitement.

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
One full of fun features and games.

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
Unfortunately, some of them seem to be disappointing.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:33.000
Especially the ones that suffer drops in sound and frames.

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:36.000
Indeed, Microsoft did not address the hard issues.

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
It seems this year they're rolling the dice.

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:43.000
Without explanation of online benefits, $500 is too steep of a price.

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
Sony's conference was impressive.

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
It was full of exciting announcements and games.

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:50.000
With the announcement of no restrictions on used titles.

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:53.000
It almost made up for Sony's previous shames.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:56.000
Indeed, Jack Tretton was on Cloud 9.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
You can see it on his face.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
The chanting of Sony's name was most telling.

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:03.000
The PS4 will start ahead in the console race.

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
It's like generation 6 all over again.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
Sony will come out on top real fast.

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:10.000
Wii U started with no games just like the GameCube.

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
But will X-Bone go the way of the Dreamcast?

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:16.000
The excitement and energy never stops at E3.

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
It's an event full of comedy and tragedy.

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:21.000
All I can say is that I can't wait for this holiday season.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:25.000
And I'm sure the same can be said for the O.L. Army.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:29.000
Wishing a tubular E3 to all gamers and fathers.

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
Degenerate Johnny.

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
I think I cried a little.

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:36.000
That was a very clever little poem.

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:37.000
Thank you.

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:38.000
Good job.

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
It should be posted on our forums.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:43.000
So there's an update from Bobby.

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
I know this is not gaming news.

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:48.000
But obviously we care about Bobby and want him to be alright.

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:52.000
As of right now, it looks like I lost all my routers and switches.

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:56.000
My audio receiver, my 360, and my Wii U.

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
Ooh.

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
Wow.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:03.000
Are Acts of God under warranty?

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
I don't know.

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
Hopefully he's got insurance or something.

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
There's got to be a homeowner's insurance.

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:16.000
Yeah, most homeowner's insurance will have some type of personal property.

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:17.000
Christ.

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:18.000
If it's not just dwelling.

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:24.000
If not for some reason, anyone from Microsoft or Nintendo listening that can help them out?

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
One thing I can tell you is that...

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:30.000
Oh, God, I wonder if that was his special 360.

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:34.000
I don't want to say too much, but he had a very special 360.

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
I hope that wasn't it.

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:41.000
I can tell you that most insurances in the South, as far as I'm aware,

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:44.000
definitely have some sort of hard weather coverage.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
It's required, so...

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:50.000
VXJ's next V says Acts of God are explicitly not covered by warranty.

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:54.000
I would still hope, though, that there would be some type of...

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
I think homeowner's insurance would cover something like that.

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
Homeowner's insurance or something, yeah.

02:12:58.000 --> 02:12:59.000
Lordy.

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
Yeah.

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:02.000
Alrighty.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
I've been in that position. I feel that pain.

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:08.000
People underestimate the weather, especially back east.

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
Right?

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
Alright, is that it for the mailbag?

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:13.000
Yes, it is.

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:17.000
Alright, mailbag at orangelandtrader.com.

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:20.000
Another reason I keep reporting on what's going on with Bobby,

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:23.000
he may not be back to do a show next week.

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:26.000
Not confirmed yet. Just let him make that announcement.

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:29.000
Watch his Twitter, because clearly his cell phone still works.

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:32.000
Bobby will be calling us and doing it on Skype.

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:35.000
He's more than welcome to. We'll be here.

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:40.000
Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week.

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:41.000
How appropriate.

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:42.000
Absolutely timed.

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
Well then, first off...

02:13:44.000 --> 02:14:02.000
First off, I think an FU from all of us to Lightning.

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:07.000
I would like to go ahead though and give, especially Brad in the chat room,

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
but people have already been bringing it up.

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:12.000
Already thinking of ways to help Bobby replace his stuff.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:15.000
We seriously have the best listeners in the universe.

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:16.000
We do. You know what?

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
And actually this is one of the things Bobby and I were talking about,

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
is that, you know, at the Voice Geek Network,

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
we don't have the biggest audience.

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:27.000
And that's okay, because I seriously think we have the most loyal audience.

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:28.000
We do.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:31.000
And we are so fortunate to have that. You guys are amazing.

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:35.000
We have people listening to us that not just give of their time to listen,

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000
they give of themselves.

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:40.000
And we'd like to give back to you as much as we can.

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:49.000
It's like, I don't need 10,000 listeners if we have 100 awesome, loyal listeners.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
You know what I mean? Like, it means so much more.

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:54.000
And how many of our listeners are we actually, like, totally good friends with now?

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:55.000
Yeah, I know.

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:58.000
I probably don't need five 360s either.

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
You probably don't, sir.

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
I could probably lend him or give him one.

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
Well, we'll see. Hopefully he's got insurance. We'll find out.

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:05.000
He's probably trying...

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
I have banned ones. That doesn't do you any well.

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:10.000
He's probably trying to process a lot right now, so let's give him a little space,

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:13.000
and then I'm sure he'll be able to clear up what's up.

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:16.000
I can lend him an NES. No.

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:22.000
But yeah, my FU for today goes towards people who drive like assholes.

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:27.000
And I'm not just talking about, you know, speeding a little bit here or not signaling.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:34.000
I'm talking about the BMW driver that I saw cut off a Lexus just because the Lexus had managed to get...

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:39.000
They closed off one lane where they're doing that construction back on Eastern.

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:47.000
And so the Lexus just happened to pull ahead of where the BMW had tried to get up in the front

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:50.000
and cut that person off, but the Lexus was just a better driver.

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:58.000
And so the BMW driver swerves around and cuts off the BMW driver as soon as there's two lanes again.

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:02.000
And I swear that was almost a Miranda.

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:08.000
Yeah, Mako drivers. Fuck them. No. That would be me. I drive the Mako horribly.

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:15.000
And then I think that I've got a sore throat.

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:19.000
And FU to not having a job. I need one of those.

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:24.000
Everybody that I've ever sent applications to, hire me, because I'm a really good person.

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
I will work hard for you.

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:29.000
That, and I'm really good with InDesign.

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
Loki?

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:40.000
Fuck you to FPSbox.com, our previous host of the Minecraft server for the VoG network.

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:48.000
And basically, I guess it got sold off or something happened, and basically the website's running in autopilot.

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:51.000
So when the servers go down, nobody answers support.

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:56.000
There's no phone anymore. There's no email. Nobody cares.

02:16:56.000 --> 02:17:01.000
And so actually, taking a look at some of the servers that are online, most of them are down right now.

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:07.000
And what sucks is the FTP portion of it's down as well, so I can't, I have backups of the server.

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:12.000
I can make backups, but I can't access any of them, because they're on the FTP server.

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:15.000
And there's something, it's something with the authentication.

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:18.000
It keeps saying that I have the wrong password, even though I don't.

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:25.000
And it doesn't matter, so you can't reset it either, because the reset password thing's broken, so.

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:29.000
Yeah, I'll just have to start anew if we're actually gonna do it.

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:32.000
And who knows, we haven't been getting a lot of people on there anyways.

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:35.000
Might as well just save myself ten bucks a month.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:41.000
I may change my mind. There's other hosts out there that'll actually let me upload my own JAR files,

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:47.000
which I wanted to do in the first place, so that we could have cool things like airplanes and cars and guns.

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
I totally want a gun.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:51.000
They have Mass Effect guns too.

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:57.000
You know what, I totally just redid my little sprite to look like my Minecraft person to look like Shepard.

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:03.000
Alright, I'm just gonna give an F.U. to traffic as well, because some bitch cut me off today on the freeway,

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000
and it's like, when you're going 80 miles an hour, don't be cutting people off.

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:06.000
Did she drive a BMW?

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:09.000
No, but I did see a couple asshole BMW drivers.

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:12.000
I'm not saying that all BMW drivers are assholes, but I'm just saying, I see a lot of them.

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:16.000
I'm starting to agree with Jeremy Clarkson, by the way. BMW drivers.

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
Otherwise, I had a pretty good week, I can't complain.

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
Although, Matt is a good BMW driver.

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:25.000
F.U. to Disneyland for me missing it so much.

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
F.U. to awkward moments.

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:29.000
Awkward?

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:33.000
I'll say that too. Oh yeah, very awkward moment, I'll have to tell you off air, it's not appropriate for on air.

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:34.000
There's nothing to do with the show.

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:37.000
Well, how about also F.U.'s to elusive ties?

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:45.000
Alright, let's move on with a couple more stories, and then we'll get to Skypline.

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:55.000
Alright, so the new thing for Xbox One, of course, they're talking about their system for achievements and stuff.

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:56.000
It's going to be a little bit different.

02:18:56.000 --> 02:19:01.000
Which, by the way, I gotta add, this is one thing we didn't talk about at the press conference.

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:07.000
They have the day one edition that gives you DLC that is an achievement.

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:09.000
So that's kind of lame.

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:15.000
I'm sure it's just stupid, like, you know, we were, you know, we bought it day one type thing.

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000
But that's still lame.

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:22.000
But anyways, so the challenges, I guess they're saying that it's going to be a little bit different than achievements.

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:23.000
It's alongside it.

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:31.000
It may not necessarily be, it may be like time limited, so you may have a certain amount of time to do a certain challenge in a game.

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
It may actually be tied to multiple games.

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:41.000
It could be tied to some community based thing, like, you know, playing X amount of hours of Halo or something like that during lunch.

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:45.000
Remember they did something like that, I think with Halo 4, it gave you some discounts and stuff.

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:49.000
And everybody that participated got some stuff.

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:52.000
I want to say, I think it was Halo, maybe Halo Reach.

02:19:53.000 --> 02:20:06.000
And then they're saying that also Xbox One video and music apps can also use achievements to reward people that would seek peak content to early access or subscription extensions.

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
So it's interesting that they're going to be doing all that stuff.

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:14.000
It sounds interesting that they're kind of revamping their achievement system.

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:19.000
I didn't think they would change what wasn't super broken.

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:28.000
I knew there were a few things here and there that they were talking about, like the whole achievements that they could build on the fly as memes come out for the game and so forth.

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:34.000
Doesn't Nintendo call them challenges, by the way, on StreetPass?

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:35.000
I don't know.

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:37.000
Just curious.

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:44.000
Alright, before we get to your calls tonight, one more story tonight, and it's to kind of put the wrap on all the E3 stories tonight.

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:51.000
E3 this year, 48,200 attendees. That's an increase of 2,500 from the prior year.

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
Bite my tongue, bite my tongue, bite my tongue.

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:58.000
Forty million dollars in revenue brought to the city of Los Angeles from that.

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:03.000
Next year's E3, June 10th through the 12th, also at the LA Convention Center.

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:11.000
But what will be interesting about next year's show, this isn't in the news story, but if you've been paying attention, there will be no more West Hall.

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:14.000
That's what they're tearing down to make Farmer's Field.

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:19.000
So it will be interesting to see, which is the football stadium for the football team that LA doesn't have yet.

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:20.000
Hello, Kensha Hall.

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:24.000
I don't know. Yeah, does that mean Kensha Hall is used next year?

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:31.000
Or the rumor is they're going to build, well it's not a rumor, but they're going to build an expansion on the other side of the street.

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:34.000
But when will that be done is anyone's guess.

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
Buy my Ouya parking lot.

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000
Who knows, who knows. But there you go.

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:43.000
There was a question I didn't get to ask about E3 this year.

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:44.000
Sure.

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
Is if they were still handing out balls.

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:49.000
Like they did every year.

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:54.000
Because that used to be the only time I would ever get balls.

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:56.000
So, just saying.

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:01.000
And Bobby says his podcast gear is fine.

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:02.000
Yay!

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:03.000
So he should be there.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:04.000
Huzzah!

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:08.000
The audio receiver is for my surround sound, so it sounds like his living room got fucked up most of all.

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:09.000
That's what it sounds like.

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:12.000
He could probably have my audio receiver too because I don't use that either.

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:16.000
Everybody's all nice around. I just got to say, you guys rule.

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:26.000
I have like a surround sound system that we don't use anymore because Josh is asleep when we watch TV and so we don't need a blast surround sound anymore.

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:31.000
Alright, I haven't even given out the damn number and already the Skype line lighting up.

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:37.000
1877 Game O-L-R, or user name on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, but you'll have to wait for this guy.

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:39.000
Who's on the line here?

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:40.000
You're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:42.000
OrangeLoungeRadio?

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
I thought I was calling Best Buy to pre-order my PlayStation 4.

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
Sure, just give me your credit card number.

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:51.000
I don't think so, Tim.

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:53.000
What's up, buddy?

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
Not too much, not too much.

02:22:56.000 --> 02:23:02.000
I just want to say that I have to thank Sony.

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:08.000
I mean, their presser made me feel like what it was like to be an actual gamer.

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:10.000
That's how it hit home for me.

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:14.000
You know, there was a very interesting comment left on the VoG network.

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:18.000
I think it was Flaco Jones who said it on last week's show at VoGnetwork.com.

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:21.000
He said last week's show was kind of Doom and Gloom.

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:22.000
What was that?

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:23.000
Macabre?

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:24.000
He said it was very...

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:25.000
Morbid?

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:26.000
Morbid kind of episode.

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:30.000
Because, yeah, we were playing the funeral march to the Xbox stuff and all that.

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:34.000
I was sitting here going, this is a sad fucking day to be a gamer.

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:38.000
But at the Sony press conference when they hit bullet after bullet after bullet, it was like...

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:42.000
Celebrate good times, come on.

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:46.000
If everyone was on board with the Xbox One stuff,

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:49.000
then I wasn't really that excited about the next gen.

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
I was like, okay, what am I going to do now?

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:55.000
And now that they came out with that, I was like, cool, I can be excited about these games now.

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:58.000
Very much so.

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:01.000
I mean, I was so excited after seeing the Kingdom Hearts 3 trailer.

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:04.000
I'm playing through Kingdom Hearts 1 right now.

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:10.000
Is the internet as a whole being too fanboy with this?

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:16.000
Are we being too blinded by Sony's tackling of Microsoft?

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:19.000
Are we not seeing the big picture here?

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:23.000
Are we refusing to acknowledge that Microsoft may actually have some good ideas?

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:26.000
That maybe Sony doesn't have the good exclusives?

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:27.000
What do you think?

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
Do you think we are being too fanboy?

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
Yes and no.

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:38.000
Coming from the cosplay fandom, anime fandom, I'll say this much.

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:47.000
You take something away, the fans will never forgive you no matter how well you fix it.

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:50.000
If Microsoft say that, oh, we're not going to do the DRM thing.

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:54.000
The fans will still look at Microsoft and be like, it doesn't matter.

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:57.000
You gone and done fucked up.

02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:05.000
It's no different from when the anime companies were jumping on the whole streaming and shutting down the fan suburbs.

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:08.000
We're like, we're good companies. We're giving you the stuff that you want.

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:13.000
But then the fans are like, you shut down my favorite fan suburbs. Why should I buy from you?

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:20.000
I think just a more direct comparison would be Sony really fucked up in 2006 and now they're back.

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:23.000
It's not even necessarily just now they're back.

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:27.000
They slowly were getting their groove back over the past few years.

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:32.000
But I think Microsoft made some really bad personnel decisions in the past few years and it's starting to show.

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:33.000
Sorry about it.

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:38.000
And you're absolutely right. I'm looking at the breakdown of the consoles.

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:44.000
I read the article how the cost of the PS4 is about $325.

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:51.000
If the PS4 and Xbox One are similar in hardware and if that's the case,

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:57.000
then you're actually paying an extra hundred bucks for Kinect, something that somebody may not even want.

02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:03.000
I think that's one of Microsoft's huge mistakes is clinging to that Kinect.

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:08.000
And I think that's one of the two big, big mistakes they made.

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:12.000
And to point out, I've actually gone on record saying that I don't want to Kinect.

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:19.000
I mean, I wanted to Kinect at first because I wanted to do Para Para games, but it doesn't really mean anything to me anymore.

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:20.000
I don't care.

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:29.000
Exactly. And I was saying to people when Xbox One, everyone was talking about the designs, I'm like, what are you talking about?

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:33.000
I've had an Xbox One sitting in my living room for about a year and a half.

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:38.000
It's called the Verizon Files DVR box. They look exactly the same.

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:41.000
All right, Rama, anything else before we let you go?

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:44.000
Yeah, for Ucchan.

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:45.000
Ooh, what?

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:49.000
Well, I know you miss your Coke Black, but I want to try to ship this out to you.

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:56.000
Here in New York, they have what's called Manhattan Special. It's cola and espresso as a soft drink.

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
I need this in my life.

02:26:58.000 --> 02:26:59.000
So good.

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:00.000
I need this in my life.

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
Rama, I'm going to let you go. Take care, buddy.

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:03.000
All right, you too, bro.

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:04.000
All right, bye.

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:05.000
Bye.

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:10.000
1877 game OLR. Our user's name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, but let's go to the phones.

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:13.000
Hey, it's Bobby.

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
Hey, Bobby. How you doing?

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:16.000
Hi, Bobby.

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:17.000
Little shook up.

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:18.000
Little shook up.

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:21.000
Yeah, okay, what happened?

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:27.000
I'm sitting there listening to OLR, and I hear a huge, really loud clap over my head.

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:35.000
And all my lights flicker, and I'm like, okay, that was close.

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:41.000
And then I notice that my brand new Netgear router is not on anymore.

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:46.000
And then I look over to my right, and my brand new Netgear 8-port switch is not on anymore.

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:52.000
And then I go upstairs, and my brand new Netgear 8-port switch that's upstairs is not on anymore.

02:27:52.000 --> 02:28:01.000
And then I start looking around, and I try to, you know, assume the worst, and I try to turn on my TV and my receiver.

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:07.000
The TV comes on, but it's at the setup screen, and my audio receiver doesn't come on at all.

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:11.000
The red light on my Wii U is no longer on.

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
The PS3's red light was on.

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:16.000
The 360 didn't turn on when I pressed it.

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:24.000
And, let's see, I've come upstairs, my old 32-inch Trinitron TV for my retro games, that doesn't work anymore.

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
And the PS2 up here is dead.

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:34.000
Well, I guess the first question I asked, do you have homeowners insurance or something that will hopefully replace some of this?

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:39.000
I absolutely do. I haven't pulled it out to see if it covers this, but I'm sure it does.

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:46.000
You might check also with the 360 and the Wii U, maybe just the replacement power supply might be all it needs for that.

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:47.000
Yeah.

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:53.000
And I think that we've actually got spares for those, because we've inherited dead systems from Dan's days at GameCrazy.

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:58.000
Well, and that just goes to show, Bobby, within literally two minutes of your tweet going up,

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:04.000
everybody in the VOG Network chat room was like, let's take up a collection, let's donate, let's send,

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:09.000
I've got an extra 360, I can send him if he needs it. I think it goes a long way.

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:13.000
And I was mentioning to the live listeners, I know you didn't hear this, because lightning,

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:19.000
it's one of the things you and I were talking about in the car when we were driving to Anaheim the other night,

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:25.000
was that we may not have the biggest audience here at the Voice of the East Network, but we have the most loyal.

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:28.000
And we are so fucking thankful for that. You guys are amazing.

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:29.000
Yeah.

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:36.000
But my computers are fine, they stayed up, my two monitors, I even checked my old classic box, it came right back up.

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:43.000
So it seems like it hits certain floors of your house more than others, because it's probably a circuit.

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:44.000
Yeah.

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:50.000
Yeah, well, I mean, it hit, I mean, because the router, but my router is down next to my computer.

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:56.000
And so it hits some things. Everything's on surge protectors, but this was, you know, they don't protect every surge,

02:29:56.000 --> 02:30:03.000
and this one must have been pretty direct. And, but yeah, it kind of hit different things, like my GameCube still works,

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
and it's sitting right next to my PS2.

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
Well.

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:12.000
But that TV doesn't work too well anymore, so I think something inside the TV got fried.

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:19.000
Take some time to process, call the insurance company on Monday, see what, you know, steps you have to take.

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:25.000
And if there's anything you need, you know you've got the three of us, you've got 61 people in chat right now,

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:29.000
and I know every single one of them is willing to help, and then add on to that the podcast listeners,

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:34.000
the other folks at VoGnetwork.com. We'll get you through this.

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:35.000
Yeah.

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.000
It just sucks. It sucks.

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:40.000
Yeah, I've spent a lot of money this past week.

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:44.000
Yeah, he did. He did, folks. Disneyland ain't cheap, you guys.

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:50.000
But, most important, you're okay. The cats were still in kitty daycare due to your trip.

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:54.000
They don't open again until Monday, so your cats are okay, and you're okay.

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:55.000
Yep.

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:57.000
Most important, everything else is just stuff.

02:30:57.000 --> 02:31:00.000
Weren't we saying that Nintendo goes last?

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:03.000
I haven't checked on my classic consoles yet, so.

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:06.000
It's just stuff. It's just stuff.

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:07.000
Yeah.

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.000
Well, I'm sure I've got spare Nintendos if you need one.

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:13.000
I know, I know. Well, everybody's here willing to help, Bobby.

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:17.000
Otherwise, anything else you want to say, turning it over to you.

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:22.000
You're open forum for you. I don't want to rush you out of here, if you have anything else you want to say.

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:26.000
Not really. I just figured I'd fill people in.

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:27.000
Well, we do.

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:28.000
Somebody send me a chat log.

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:35.000
We do appreciate the update. I think mine logs, but if not, I'm sure somebody in chat will have you covered.

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:36.000
Okay, cool.

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:37.000
All right.

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:38.000
All right.

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:45.000
Keep us posted via Twitter. I know a lot of folks here at VOG Network follow you on Twitter, twitter.com slash bobbyblackwolf,

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:51.000
and will be a great way to get the updates on how it goes with the insurance company and all that throughout the week.

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:52.000
All right.

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:53.000
All right.

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:54.000
Bye, guys.

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:57.000
All right. Take care, buddy. Bye bye.

02:31:57.000 --> 02:32:00.000
I don't know what else to tell them right now.

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:01.000
I've been there.

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:02.000
Yeah.

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:10.000
So, which is actually kind of funny because that same storm that I fried my roommate's hard drive in,

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:16.000
one of my friends lost their Genesis, but their Super Nintendo worked.

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
And they were both on the same circuit.

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:19.000
All right.

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:25.000
I'm going to need a dick or a fart joke, please, to help cheer us up a little bit here and lighten the mood a little bit.

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:26.000
But let's try this call.

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:27.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:30.000
Who's this?

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:33.000
Hi, this is Haseo Tsumurugawa.

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:34.000
Hi.

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:35.000
Hello.

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:36.000
You said Haseo Tsumurugawa?

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:37.000
Yeah.

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:38.000
Hey, what's up?

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:39.000
I don't know if I've heard you call in before.

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:40.000
What's on your mind, buddy?

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:43.000
Actually, I've called in like two or three times.

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:44.000
Oh.

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:45.000
Yeah, Rob.

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:46.000
I forgot.

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:51.000
I don't remember a video call except I think I'm seeing a statue on your cam.

02:32:51.000 --> 02:33:01.000
Actually, I chose that statue for a reason because the VoG network has earned good karma and had the hero shift to hero.

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:04.000
It's the statue from Infamous 2.

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:05.000
Oh, okay.

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
It's a little dark in your room or something.

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:08.000
It's a little fuzzy coming through.

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:09.000
It's hard to make out.

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:10.000
But I get it.

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:11.000
I get it now.

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000
Crappy PlayStation way.

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000
So, what's up, buddy?

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:22.000
Actually, I was going to talk about the whole virtual E3 booth that Sony was doing this week or whatever.

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:23.000
Oh, okay.

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:24.000
Yeah.

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:25.000
I didn't have a chance to really check that out.

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:26.000
Tell me about that.

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:38.000
It was actually pretty interesting because they booth pretty much everything major that's coming out like Infamous 2nd Son, Assassin's Creed IV, and all that stuff.

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:41.000
And they had like little quests and whatnot.

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:48.000
You could earn a free month of Music Unlimited, PlayStation Plus, all those lovely things.

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
That's pretty cool.

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:53.000
Yeah, I heard about the free month of PlayStation Plus on home.

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:54.000
That's pretty awesome.

02:33:54.000 --> 02:34:08.000
The best thing actually about it was it told me about Tekken Revolution, even though Tekken Revolution kind of sucked because it's one of those Facebook type-y games.

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:09.000
Oh, yeah.

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:10.000
That free-to-play Tekken game.

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000
Free-to-play Tekken game we were talking about last week.

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:13.000
I forgot.

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:14.000
Yeah, it was supposed to come out.

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:15.000
That's too bad.

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:23.000
Yeah, my boyfriend was playing it because, you know, he wanted to play a new game and I said, well, why don't you try Tekken?

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:27.000
He got about four or five fights into it and then it stopped.

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:30.000
So, that's kind of sad.

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:31.000
Womp womp.

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:37.000
That was like me exploring, what was that god-awful MMO that's on PlayStation 3?

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:38.000
Free Realms?

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:39.000
Free.

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:42.000
God, what a stinker.

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:45.000
That's unfortunate.

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:57.000
So, I'm assuming if you actually do all the stuff in PlayStation Home and all that, you've been a little bit of a Sony fanboy or I shouldn't say the word fanboy because that has a negative connotation.

02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:59.000
Actually, Sony fanboy is on my senior shirt.

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:00.000
Okay, then fine.

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:01.000
Sony fanboy.

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:04.000
So, you must have been eating this shit up at E3.

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:09.000
You must have just been like, this is the day I've been waiting for.

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:12.000
Xbox fans can go eat it today.

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:16.000
How are you feeling after Sony's press conference?

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:27.000
I actually feel really good because mostly Sony got the rights to, you know, Air, Final Fantasy XIV, XV, which is actually versus XIII.

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:32.000
And pretty much all the good stuff Square Enix is putting out.

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:37.000
And the last 25 minutes, it was pretty much Sony saying, suck it, Microsoft.

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:41.000
Yeah, it was pretty interesting.

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:44.000
So, no hope on you getting an Xbox One?

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
Absolutely not.

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:50.000
I have internet troubles and I do not.

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:58.000
Now, okay, since you said you're a Sony fanboy, I said earlier in the show, you know, I think Xbox's exclusives actually look a little better.

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:04.000
Even though I ended up ordering a PlayStation 4 because the overall picture, I think, is better for PlayStation 4.

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:08.000
And I'll get the Xbox One later when they sort out all their bullshit.

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:18.000
But what I want to ask you is, explain to me why I'm wrong.

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:30.000
Actually, I haven't really seen any exclusives for Xbox One that really, you know, kind of, I'd say, jump out at me as far as that goes.

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:38.000
But, I mean, the exclusives for PlayStation 4 are superior in a sense.

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:43.000
I mean, you know, you got...

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000
I can't really think of any right now.

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:49.000
Yeah, I'm not really convinced right now.

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:53.000
I'm just giving you a hard time. I'm putting you on the spot. It ain't easy. It ain't easy.

02:36:53.000 --> 02:37:01.000
Well, assuming you're buying a PlayStation 4 on day one, what are you most looking forward to? The Square Enix games or...?

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:15.000
The Square Enix games and Infamous Second Son because, spoiler alert, the end of the second one is kind of states why there's a whole new character and storyline and all that.

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:21.000
Fair enough. All right, well, anything else you want to get off your chest before we let you go?

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000
Mirrors Edge 2 looks pretty.

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000
Mirrors Edge 2 does look pretty. I think we can agree on that.

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000
All right, thanks so much for the call, buddy.

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000
Absolutely no problem.

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.000
Take care. Have a good one.

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:35.000
1877 Game OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:41.000
What the heck? We're getting call after call tonight. Lots of people wanted to comment on E3. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000
Hey, this. I'm Deft.

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:44.000
Hey, Agdeft.

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:45.000
Hi, Agdeft.

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:46.000
How are you doing?

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:47.000
Pretty good.

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:49.000
What's on your mind, buddy?

02:37:49.000 --> 02:38:00.000
Well, something that not many people are talking about Sony and Microsoft, that they're both doing, and it's pretty great in my opinion,

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:15.000
is that you only need to buy one subscription to PlayStation Plus and to Xbox One to everyone in the console or in your house to enjoy it.

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:23.000
Oh, so meaning that if you just have to have the one account and then you can have all the TVs in your house,

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:26.000
because I'm assuming they would all go back to the same IP at the end of the day,

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:32.000
can all kind of use that central account to do Netflix and all that.

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:42.000
Yeah, it's something that I find pretty useful because in my household, me and my brother do have each one on Xbox.

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:48.000
So we do have, like, I am the only one that has a gold account.

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:56.000
So in the future, if we decide either to get a PS4 or an Xbox One in this case,

02:38:56.000 --> 02:39:03.000
it's pretty good that we only need to buy one subscription to enjoy the gold or Plus benefits.

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000
Loki's wearing a question mark on his face right now.

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:08.000
I'm not sure if that's actually, if it's just going to be on the console or not,

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:14.000
because I know, like, if I have live gold on one of my accounts, like an account on my 360,

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:19.000
I can play multiplayer on that, but if I have a second account that's not live gold,

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:25.000
you know, I still can't play online with that. I have to have a separate live gold account for that.

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:29.000
And I know they have the family plans and got rid of it. I think it's just for one console.

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:34.000
Basically, one console, any of the accounts that are on there, you can play live on,

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:38.000
because it's tied to the console, not necessarily to your account.

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:42.000
I mean, it's still tied to your account, but it's also tied to that console.

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:47.000
Same with how the PlayStation 3, well, PlayStation 3 was, you know, free online,

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:51.000
but pretty much you can have as many PlayStation Network accounts as you wanted,

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000
but I think they would kind of do it in a similar way.

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:57.000
I'm not sure if, I could be wrong because I haven't really read the details on it yet,

02:39:57.000 --> 02:40:02.000
but I don't think that they're having it where, like, I buy Xbox Live gold or whatever,

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:06.000
and, you know, a sibling of mine has a separate console.

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:09.000
We can both play them live at the same time. I don't think it works that way.

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:13.000
Because otherwise, you know, what's to say if they're doing that 10 friend thing or whatever,

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:18.000
that I buy gold and then everybody else plays for free. I mean, I just don't think they're going to do that.

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:25.000
Yeah, I do think it's also just one console, but it's still pretty good,

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:31.000
because even right now, you have to buy a subscription for each account you have.

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:38.000
So with that, even if you cannot share it with another console, even in the same household,

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:47.000
having just buying one subscription instead of two or even three in some cases, it's pretty good.

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:51.000
Let me ask you this question, Akdeft, on kind of a little bit of a random tangent,

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:56.000
but obviously you call into the show quite a bit, and you're kind of known as our friendly neighborhood Mexican,

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:59.000
and you give a lot of perspective from living in Mexico,

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:02.000
and sometimes our perspectives are a little shifted here in the US,

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:06.000
because a lot of this stuff is really tailored for us here in the US, you know,

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:12.000
and to some extent, Britain and the immediate UK territories like Germany, France, Spain, and so on,

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:19.000
and Japan as well. How do these systems look from your perspective in Mexico?

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000
Is Xbox One launching in Mexico?

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:28.000
Yeah, the Xbox One is launching in Mexico. Don't know if it's launching in November,

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:38.000
but it has a retail price. They're already launching pre-orders, and it's around 8,500 pesos,

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:43.000
which is around 600 or 700 dollars, I think.

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.000
Okay, and how does PlayStation 4 look?

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:53.000
And PlayStation 4 also seems that they're launching in November. I'm not sure at all,

02:41:53.000 --> 02:42:02.000
but it looks like it, though it's launching for 1,000 pesos less, which is 7,500 pesos,

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:10.000
and dollars would be, I think, around 550 and 600 dollars.

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:15.000
So you're paying a premium similar to what our friends over across the Atlantic pay,

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:19.000
because in the European territories, it's a little bit higher as well.

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:24.000
Well, I mean, is this something, you've mentioned, you've crossed into America before

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:27.000
to sometimes buy things at a cheaper price with this stuff.

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:30.000
Is this something you're thinking about doing with the consoles, or no,

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:33.000
because you want to be able to play the download stuff, or?

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:42.000
Maybe I will, because at least Microsoft, something that has done in the past, even with the 360,

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:52.000
is that it has most of the digital content on par with the US, at least most of it.

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:58.000
Though the Xbox One doesn't look as appealing as the PS4 right now,

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:02.000
because the Xbox TV stuff won't work here.

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:08.000
At least not at launch, and I don't think it will work even in the first year.

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:13.000
So that is a feature that won't be used here,

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:19.000
and so the console will probably mostly be used as a gaming console,

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.000
and it's way too expensive.

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:25.000
Though, on the other hand, a Wii U costs the same.

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:29.000
And if you're going to live in Mexico, you've got to be able to watch the telenovelas,

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:32.000
because that, those are the bomb.

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:37.000
No way, it's all about lucha libre. Forget the drama, I like watching the wrestlers.

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:44.000
No, well it used to be all about sabarogicante, but that's gone now, if I am not mistaken.

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000
They finally pulled that.

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:51.000
So telenovelas, they show some of them here, and they're great.

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:54.000
I like watching the wrestlers, they are absolutely fun.

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:58.000
I have a spicy telenovela, so no comments.

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:02.000
Alright, ActDeaf, thank you so much for the perspective, we appreciate it.

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:04.000
Have a good one, okay?

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:05.000
You too, thanks for having me.

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:07.000
No problem, any time, bye.

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:11.000
1877 GameOLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:14.000
You know what's interesting, I didn't even ask ActDeaf about Nintendo at all,

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:16.000
and he's such a big Kirby fan.

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:19.000
I know he must have been squeaking at the Kirby in the Smash Brothers trailer.

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:22.000
I mean, duh, Kirby's going to be in a Smash Brothers game,

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:24.000
but I'm sure he was excited to see that.

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:27.000
I think we can squeeze in one more call, if somebody wants to try and get it.

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:30.000
It was just lighting up a minute ago, so we'll try to squeeze in one more.

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:33.000
We're just after 9 o'clock, but we've got a little bit of a late start tonight,

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:36.000
and we had a really awkward beginning here live,

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:40.000
which I'm going to edit out all that dead air for the podcast, sorry, but it was weird.

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:42.000
Alright, we've got at least one more call coming in, so let's try to take it.

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:44.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.000
Hey, this is Tiki.

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:47.000
Hey, what's up?

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:54.000
Hey, not much. I just want to say one thing and ask a question for Doc Sakura.

02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:55.000
Oh?

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:56.000
Okay.

02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:59.000
Sony 1E3, that's it for me.

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:05.000
That's it, huh? There's nothing, there's nothing, no convincing you otherwise.

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000
Sony 1E3, huh?

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:12.000
Like, the way that Microsoft handled their DRM, they treat you like you're a criminal,

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:15.000
and that's, no, there's no way.

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:19.000
They're alienating their audience, plain and simple.

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:22.000
Alright, what's your question for Doc Sakura, and then I'm going to throw you a curveball.

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:26.000
Okay, um, I saw, like, the trailer for...

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:33.000
He likes the trailer for, you just cut out, The Joys of Live Radio.

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:41.000
Okay, um, I saw the trailer for Final Fantasy XIV, Realm Reborn, on the PS3.

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:44.000
What's the game play like on the, since you're in the closed beta?

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:50.000
I'm not playing it on PS3, I'm playing it on PC, and it's pretty much standard, you know, Momofare.

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:57.000
It's, uh, you know, what I like about the combat in the game is that you don't have to stop to loot,

02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:59.000
it will automatically auto-loot.

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:07.000
Um, you actually get to choose, I mean, well, they've sort of incorporated this in Mists of Pandaria lately,

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:13.000
is actually getting, um, items from doing quests that are for your class specifically,

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:16.000
as opposed to getting just everybody's stuff.

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:23.000
Um, I'd like, um, the server that we're on is pretty crowded, I'll go ahead and say that right now,

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:24.000
I don't like that so much.

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:31.000
But, um, it's really fun, the game is smooth, even if you have a little bit of slowdown,

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:37.000
it's not like a really horrible lag, you don't find yourself being stuck anywhere, if that makes sense.

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:44.000
And, uh, the whole fate system, I enjoy that, basically you have these big group battles that give you extra experience.

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:50.000
There's really just a lot of positive to be said about it, and on top of that, it looks like, you know,

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:58.000
whereas even with the current graphical updates on World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy XIV looks like a new game.

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:02.000
It looks and plays like a new game.

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:08.000
The gameplay from it looks like, kinda looks like a, on par with Guild Wars 2 graphically.

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:13.000
I would say so, and on top of that, you know, keep in mind the last time I played Final Fantasy XI,

02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:18.000
was in its original sort of play style with your group dynamics.

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:22.000
The group dynamics in this are a lot different, I think I like it a lot better.

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:27.000
Is it still like our Grand Fest, like it is in XI in the beginning?

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:29.000
I haven't noticed any problems grinding.

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:30.000
Okay.

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:33.000
Yeah, I'm enjoying it, I'm enjoying it a lot.

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:39.000
Actually, I hate being under NDA for saying stuff about the last beta,

02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:44.000
but the improvements that they're making are noticeable and very good.

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:46.000
It's gonna be a really rich game when it boots.

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:51.000
I might try it out on my first MMO on the PS3.

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:55.000
Well, I can't speak for how it plays on the PS3,

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:59.000
because I play on a PC just because of the problems with my hands,

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:04.000
but I enjoy it, that's all I can say, I like it.

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:06.000
Shane would vouch for it.

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:08.000
Yes he will, yes he will.

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:12.000
Shane would probably jump up and down on a trampoline saying how much he likes it, but you know.

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:16.000
Alright, here's the curveball I wanted to throw at you before you guys got on Final Fantasy XIV.

02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:18.000
No, no, this is important, because this is for a lot of people,

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:24.000
because everybody's turned E3 into Sony versus Microsoft, Sony versus Microsoft, da-da-da-da-da.

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:26.000
Where does Nintendo sit with you?

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:27.000
That's my curveball.

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.000
Where does Nintendo sit right now?

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:34.000
Funny you should ask that, I actually watched the Nintendo Direct the day of,

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:37.000
on that day that they streamed it,

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:43.000
and what my general overall feeling for that is,

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:47.000
2014 is the year that we, for me.

02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:51.000
So, in other words, it's kind of one of my earlier tweets I'd put out there was like,

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:56.000
boy, Nintendo's sure setting up a great season for 2014, too bad about this year.

02:48:56.000 --> 02:49:01.000
Yeah, it's like there's nothing really that catches my eye, this year at all.

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:04.000
There's the Mario game, the Mario 3D game looks great,

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:09.000
but I mean, the Donkey Kong game, again, Donkey Kong's a solid platformer,

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:14.000
but I think that's the problem, you've got two platformers with Mario and Donkey Kong.

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:20.000
Yeah, I kind of wish they'd gone a different direction, but they could have done a lot worse.

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:27.000
I guess there's nothing hardcore for me to play, that's why I like playing.

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:31.000
So platformers are the party games.

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:33.000
Alright buddy, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show,

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:35.000
but do you have any other final thoughts?

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:37.000
No, that's it.

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:39.000
Alright, thank you, have a good one.

02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:40.000
You too.

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:41.000
Alright, bye-bye.

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:43.000
Alright, that's going to do it for the Skypline tonight,

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:45.000
I'm sorry to those of you that didn't get through tonight,

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:47.000
but I do have this very important update.

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:50.000
According to Tigerclaw, and I went to the wiki to verify it,

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:52.000
Sabado Higante is still on the air.

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:56.000
I thought they were canceling it in 2011 or 2012,

02:49:56.000 --> 02:50:00.000
but no, it celebrated its 50th anniversary on October 27th, 2012.

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:08.000
They have some new co-hosts, but maybe they just stopped carrying it here locally or something,

02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:09.000
but that would seem weird.

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:13.000
I think a show that's as old as that, it wouldn't stop.

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:16.000
I guess I'm just not watching enough Mexican TV,

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:19.000
but for what it's worth, I don't watch enough American TV either,

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.000
so at least that's equal.

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:23.000
Alright, well there's your very important update.

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:24.000
Thank you to the chatters.

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:27.000
Alright, that's it for the Skypline tonight.

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:29.000
I got to get to some of these tweets we were getting,

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:31.000
because we were getting some good tweets.

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:36.000
And Loki, I always like to put a call out for last minute stories if you have anything.

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:43.000
Yeah, real quick, I was going to mention that, well, it's kind of funny,

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:46.000
we talk about porn a lot on this show,

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:53.000
and one of the things that they're looking to bring to the Oculus Rift, porn.

02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:59.000
And it's actually being done by this startup studio.

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:05.000
The game's called Wicked Paradise, and they're getting funding for it right now,

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:11.000
but they're trying to make, I guess, a game that will get people horny.

02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:13.000
Genuinely horny.

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:15.000
Wow.

02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:18.000
Yeah, so they've got information on that.

02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:21.000
So I thought that was kind of funny.

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:25.000
And then I forgot to mention in the releases this week,

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:32.000
a new Luigi U is going to be on the eShop this week.

02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:37.000
Yeah, when I heard about that, I was like, oh, yeah, that is real soon.

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:39.000
So, pretty neat.

02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:42.000
Let me get to some of the tweets here real quick.

02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:48.000
sj100matt tweeted us about comedian Lewis Black talking about Xbox One and Google Glass on the Daily Show.

02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:50.000
I have seen that YouTube floating around.

02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:53.000
Because I was out of town, I haven't watched it yet.

02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:57.000
DarkSakura, some folks saying it should be maybe a fortune cookie in a future week.

02:51:57.000 --> 02:51:59.000
Because I know you do like Lewis Black, so check that out.

02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:01.000
Yeah, I love Lewis Black.

02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:08.000
Let's see, we got a tweet here from Ionotropic who notices that storm is heading his way.

02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:10.000
The one that got Bobby.

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:12.000
So stay safe.

02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:14.000
Unplug stuff if you want.

02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:20.000
Let's see, DarkTetsuya says Bemani may be dead in the States, but it lives on in Japan.

02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:24.000
BeatMania 2DX21's Spada is on location test.

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:26.000
And they said they weren't doing it anymore.

02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:31.000
Please tell me that somebody is saying this is Spada.

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:33.000
Please tell me that's a joke.

02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:34.000
Somebody?

02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:36.000
Alright, fair enough.

02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:41.000
Let's see, Act F tweeting us that Pacman CEDX is coming to Steam.

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:45.000
I did not know. That's kind of cool. I think that would be a fun game to play on PC.

02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:49.000
Is that part of that PC? No, I guess it's a separate thing.

02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:55.000
Tigerclaw tweeting us, Sega launching a new Sonic the Hedgehog series titled Sonic Boom.

02:52:55.000 --> 02:53:01.000
It's by the creators of My Little Pony Friendship is Magic. Oh God. Oh man.

02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:02.000
Don't care anymore.

02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:07.000
That's some fandom skill. You gotta give it at least a chance. You gotta try at least one episode, DarkSakura.

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:08.000
You gotta try it before you know it's really-

02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:09.000
I did. It was stupid.

02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:12.000
No, I'm not talking about My Little Pony. I'm talking about Sonic Boom.

02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:14.000
Oh, maybe.

02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:17.000
That does- Are we sure that's legit? Are we sure that's legit?

02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:21.000
Because that does sound a little bit fan wanky. I'm just saying. I'm just saying. Alright.

02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:29.000
And lastly, Rama tweeting us a story about Tekken producer Katsuhiro Harada missing.

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:36.000
But actually, I think this was on our show roll last week but got bumped because of all the Microsoft news that was happening.

02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:42.000
I want to say there was a late-breaking update that he kind of just ran away for a little bit.

02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:45.000
But he's fine. He's safe. Don't worry. He's okay.

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:46.000
What about the other dude?

02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:47.000
Which one?

02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:52.000
The guy that was Knuckles Dasa was?

02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:56.000
We haven't heard an update on him. I don't think. Thank you for asking.

02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:04.000
I'm gonna look. I don't know. I haven't heard.

02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:07.000
That's too bad.

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:10.000
Oh well.

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:17.000
I'm actually trying to find real quick where that Facebook is that might have an update.

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:22.000
Live radio, guys, while I try to find this.

02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:25.000
Trying to see if there's anything-

02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:27.000
We're talking about Mexican wrestling now.

02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:28.000
Really?

02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:29.000
What the hell?

02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:30.000
There it is.

02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:39.000
Unfortunately, I'm looking at- and the website is, if you want more information on this, findknuckles.com.

02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:46.000
And they say that they're still out searching as often as they can when weather permits over the past week.

02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:50.000
They went out to Bowen Island. These are some places around Vancouver and so forth.

02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:52.000
So unfortunately, it sounds like he's still missing.

02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:59.000
So guys, especially if you're in the Pacific Northwest, and that goes double if you're in the Vancouver area, please check out findknuckles.com.

02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:04.000
It's gonna redirect you to a Facebook page, but just trying to get the latest on that.

02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:09.000
Boy oh boy.

02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:17.000
Let me see if I have any other tweet stories here.

02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:22.000
I don't think so, but I'm giving private messages.

02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:27.000
I'm getting told to take Sonic Boom with a grain of salt.

02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:33.000
Stay tuned for Anime Jam Session for all the latest on that. They'll tell you what is going on there.

02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:36.000
People are welcome to like what they like.

02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:37.000
That's right.

02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:39.000
I don't have to like it.

02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:41.000
I got sent this story here.

02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:46.000
Microsoft looking into playing games offline on Xbox One.

02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:47.000
Oh, sure they are.

02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:53.000
That was the one that, if I remember correctly, this is the one that's from the NeoGaf thing where someone had proposed,

02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:56.000
hey, you can have it so that it's optional so that, you know.

02:55:56.000 --> 02:56:01.000
Oh, the Major Nelson thing where he tweeted or whatever saying, yes, we could do that.

02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:03.000
It's possible. I think that's what this is.

02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:05.000
Here's the thing with this story.

02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:08.000
Anything is, there's gonna be a lot of discussions after E3.

02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:15.000
You know, Microsoft, Microsoft really thought they were doing the right thing here.

02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:20.000
You know, and I think that's one thing I might have neglected to say in the beginning, so if, you know, I missed that, then I'm sorry.

02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:26.000
But Microsoft, I think in their minds, as twisted as it is, is trying to do the right thing.

02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:34.000
And go back to what I said earlier about they think that people want an Apple-like device, not necessarily the same thing they saw with 360.

02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:41.000
And that's the huge difference you heard in their press conferences was that, you know, when Jack Trenton was there stabbing Microsoft in the jugular,

02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:45.000
he said, we know that gamers like it just the way they are.

02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:49.000
When you hear what Microsoft is saying, no, gamers want something different.

02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:53.000
So in their mind, whether they're right or wrong, they're doing the right thing here.

02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:58.000
So a lot can change.

02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:05.000
I kind of think it's too late to reverse course and backpedal for this holiday season, and I think they're gonna pay for it, but you never know.

02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:07.000
A lot can happen. We'll see what happens.

02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:10.000
But I think it goes without saying anything is possible.

02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:16.000
But don't expect anything next week, because there's gonna be a lot of board meetings and a lot of conferences that happen

02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:20.000
and a lot of consulting that happens over the next and focus groups.

02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:24.000
I would say you're not going to hear anything for about three months,

02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:28.000
although they need to get something out a lot sooner if they want to get more preorders to the holiday season.

02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:34.000
But technically they could do it right up until the day it's out and still sell a lot of them.

02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:37.000
We'll see. Anything's possible.

02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:45.000
OK, I'm just looking at stuff in the chat at live.vognetwork.com.

02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:47.000
The chat room is all over the place.

02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:48.000
Yeah, all over the place.

02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:53.000
Akuma JP says, an Apple-like device. Xbox One looks like my grandpa's VCR.

02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:55.000
Betamax!

02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:59.000
Shadow Next Gen says, Microsoft could do something at PAX Prime since it's in their backyard.

02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:03.000
You know, Bobby and I were talking about that a little bit in the car or at Disneyland. I wanted to.

02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:05.000
We had some time together talking about all this stuff.

02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:16.000
And yeah, actually that was brought up that PAX Prime would be a very good place to make your case directly to the gamers

02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:19.000
that you seem to have ruffled feathers with.

02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:21.000
It's going to be a very interesting PAX Prime.

02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:23.000
Too bad we're all going to Dragon Con.

02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:32.000
We'll be following everything on Twitter and news and all that stuff as it goes on.

02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:38.000
Alright, that's it. We're about to the end of the show. It's been a very, very busy night tonight.

02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:44.000
So I think it's about time we wrap up and take it back to the other shows here, The Voice Geeks Network

02:58:44.000 --> 02:58:47.000
and our big 11th birthday show next week.

02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:51.000
Any other last minute stories before we get to that?

02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:53.000
Nope.

02:58:54.000 --> 02:59:06.000
There's a small thing. There's some people being suspended from eSports or whatever for some Dota 2 match fixing.

02:59:06.000 --> 02:59:11.000
I guess it's allegedly that one team bet against themselves and threw the match.

02:59:11.000 --> 02:59:15.000
Apparently. And now they're banned.

02:59:15.000 --> 02:59:17.000
Some people.

02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:21.000
All for about a $100 bet.

02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:23.000
Well, cheating's cheating.

02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:27.000
Alright, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:32.000
Hey, if you enjoyed the show tonight and if you disagree with us wholeheartedly,

02:59:32.000 --> 02:59:34.000
thank you for sticking with it for three hours.

02:59:34.000 --> 02:59:41.000
But if you think we're not being fair to Microsoft or maybe being too fair to Microsoft or Sony or Nintendo,

02:59:41.000 --> 02:59:43.000
send us your feedback.

02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:46.000
It is a show where every gamer has a voice and we're interested in what you have to say.

02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:49.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is our email address.

02:59:49.000 --> 02:59:52.000
Or you can also reach out to us on Twitter at Twitter.com slash O-L-R

02:59:52.000 --> 02:59:56.000
or post on our Facebook page at Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:59:56.000 --> 03:00:00.000
We do read all of it even if we don't always respond to it right away.

03:00:00.000 --> 03:00:06.000
And we thank you guys for your support and especially with all the bullshit that's going on

03:00:06.000 --> 03:00:10.000
with Bobby's house getting hit by lightning right now which really sucks.

03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:16.000
The way you guys are really banding together in chat just really shows why this network is an amazing place

03:00:16.000 --> 03:00:20.000
and I'm really happy to have you all as a part of it going into next week's birthday show.

03:00:20.000 --> 03:00:22.000
I think that's a great thing to keep in mind.

03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:25.000
We will be back to do it all again next week with our 11th birthday.

03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:30.000
JV Mohn will be here in the house in the East Coast representing New York City peeps.

03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:32.000
I really need to get back to New York City.

03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:34.000
I want to go.

03:00:34.000 --> 03:00:35.000
I know.

03:00:35.000 --> 03:00:37.000
I haven't been since I was a senior in high school.

03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:38.000
I haven't been in a while either.

03:00:38.000 --> 03:00:42.000
But anyway, let's go around and get everybody's final thought before we wrap up tonight.

03:00:42.000 --> 03:00:48.000
My final thought tonight is I need to download and play Marvel Heroes this week

03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:50.000
because I keep hearing about it and I keep forgetting to play it.

03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:52.000
So I will play it this week.

03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:53.000
Yes, I know, DarkSakura.

03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:55.000
But I want to give it a try for myself.

03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:57.000
Loki, your final thought tonight?

03:00:57.000 --> 03:00:58.000
Hopefully my...

03:00:58.000 --> 03:01:04.000
I've got these, what is it, Ethernet Overpower adapters that I'm getting

03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:08.000
so that I can hook up my PlayStation 3 to the front room TV

03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:12.000
instead of having to have to drag a 50-foot Ethernet cable into that room

03:01:12.000 --> 03:01:17.000
because remember, I have a launched 20-gig system that doesn't have Wi-Fi.

03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:18.000
Yeah.

03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:21.000
So hopefully that will come soon so I can do that.

03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:25.000
And I need to download and install and play Final Fantasy XIV.

03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:29.000
Lastly and certainly not leastly, DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?

03:01:29.000 --> 03:01:31.000
The sore throat.

03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:32.000
Aw.

03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:36.000
It started during the mailbag and I will try not to breathe on anybody just in case.

03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:39.000
You need another cup of coffee or a lozenge?

03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:40.000
I'd like a lozenge.

03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:41.000
Or both.

03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:42.000
Sadly, I don't have any.

03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:45.000
But I could totally do Jewish mother voice now.

03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:46.000
All right.

03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:47.000
That does it.

03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:49.000
Thank you guys again for downloading us and supporting independent podcasting.

03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:52.000
If you like what you heard, tell a friend or two about the show.

03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:53.000
Help spread the word.

03:01:53.000 --> 03:01:58.000
Help grow our amazing family here at the Voice of Geeks Network, Orange Lounge Radio.

03:01:58.000 --> 03:02:00.000
And we'll be back to do it all again next week.

03:02:00.000 --> 03:02:01.000
Thank you guys very much.

03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:02.000
See ya.

03:02:30.000 --> 03:02:32.000
See you next week.

03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:02.000
All right.

03:03:02.000 --> 03:03:03.000
No.

03:03:03.000 --> 03:03:04.000
Be quiet.

03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:05.000
Be quiet.

03:03:05.000 --> 03:03:06.000
I wasn't ready for you.

03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:08.000
I guess that thing was looping.

03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:11.000
We gotta get to our fortune cookie message of the day.

03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:15.000
I've had such a long day today.

03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:17.000
Oh my gosh.

03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:19.000
That was a busy show tonight, you guys.

03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:21.000
Thank you guys for all the kind words.

03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:22.000
Early bedtime for Rob.

03:03:22.000 --> 03:03:25.000
It wasn't a super funny show, but I felt the discussion was good.

03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:27.000
It can't always be dick and fart jokes.

03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:28.000
We had a lot of fun.

03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:29.000
It can't always be dick and fart jokes.

03:03:29.000 --> 03:03:30.000
We had a lot happen.

03:03:30.000 --> 03:03:31.000
Yeah.

03:03:31.000 --> 03:03:32.000
So thank you guys.

03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:33.000
You guys really contributed to that.

03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:34.000
All right.

03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:35.000
Let's get to the fortune cookie message of the day, guys.

03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:38.000
And then we'll be back to wrap it all up.
