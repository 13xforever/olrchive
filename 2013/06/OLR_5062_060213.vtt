Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, June 2, 2013, One Country has a strong statement about the Xbox One.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Blizzard postpones its next MMO.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
And could legendary buried game cartridges in the desert soon be unearthed?

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.000 --> 00:47.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 506, 2nd Mix, J-Append for this June 2, 2013.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
I'll explain the title in a minute here.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
But welcome back to the show everybody, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers?

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
Can we call this one a go-to mix instead?

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Whatever you want it to be.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Can we have true kiss destination?

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
No.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Club append!

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
They weren't that good, let's be real.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Well, if their career didn't last that long.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Dreams come true lasted longer than them.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Also say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Hi.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Hi, how you doing, Loki?

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Pretty good.

01:11.000 --> 01:21.000
Excellent. And of course, my name is Rob Roberts and we do join you live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of the Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Alright, so last week was a little weird.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
We weren't actually here live on Sunday.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
We did a special show earlier in the week which we called episode number 506.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
But then it was brought to my attention.

01:31.000 --> 01:39.000
You're gonna ruin all the like tracking of the classic game of the week and all these segments you usually do if you give a special episode a regular episode number.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
So, I broke it.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
Just put a blank in there. How damn hard is that?

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Give it a letter.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
It's fine.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
It's episode R.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
We'll just have 506, 2nd Mix.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
It's a do-over. We'll do it live.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
Because it's not an episode unless I'm here, let's face it.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
So, episode 2 was not an episode?

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
No, it wasn't. That was when I was sleeping in the Harry Potter room at the Gay Frat House.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
Alright, so last week you were in Alabama, right?

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Yes.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
And you were taking care of mostly some family stuff.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Yes.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
But you did get to hang out with like you met like at least one OLR listener, right?

02:15.000 --> 02:22.000
I got to hang out with Jammer Jay who I have known for quite some time and there's a little bit of background.

02:22.000 --> 02:29.000
About 10 years ago we met up and played DDR together and I got his games and I think I got him like dinner.

02:29.000 --> 02:37.000
So, this time he paid for my games and got me dinner and took me to McGuire's in Pensacola and I got shit-faced.

02:38.000 --> 02:45.000
I drank, okay, McGuire's is like a small microbrewery and they do their own stouts and porters.

02:45.000 --> 02:51.000
I had a good porter, but then they served me this drink called an Irish Wake that's very green and served in a mason jar and I consumed it.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
And I was very dizzy the rest of the ride.

02:53.000 --> 03:02.000
And then I got a sunburn in the shape, well my tan line is in the shape of a seatbelt because we were riding in a convertible and I stopped caring about the sun.

03:02.000 --> 03:12.000
So, but we did go to Pace, Florida and play a lot of DDR and played some Addams Family pinball at another arcade at the Pensacola beach.

03:12.000 --> 03:21.000
And then I ran into, I spent some time with my mama's son and papa's son and their roommates Kristen and Bobby, a different Bobby of course.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
And I got to see Derek who is one of my very good friends.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
And all these people none of our listeners know.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
And my good friend Donovan who, they're both fixtures at Dragon Con, you may run into them.

03:32.000 --> 03:37.000
And I got to see my very good friend Jen, she picked me up when my flight was changed from Gulfport to Mobile.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
Do not get me started on American Airlines because fuck them.

03:40.000 --> 03:45.000
I heard about your drama going, I'm on an airplane tomorrow and you have me a little worried.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Are you doing American?

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
No.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Good, fuck them.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
Well who owns US Air now, that's United right?

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
I don't know, yeah I rode United back and I had no problem.

03:55.000 --> 04:00.000
They even had a movie and they had snack boxes that had Nutella in them.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
So fuck you American Airlines, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
At least they're refunding me 75 bucks in toiletries and clothes that I had to buy.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
Guess what I found at Goodwill in Alabama, in Daphne, Alabama.

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
I found a Charlie the Unicorn shirt that says sparkle, sparkle, sparkle, sparkle on it.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
I don't care if I can wear it or not.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
Is there a hot topic in Alabama that could have come from?

04:22.000 --> 04:29.000
Well we had Gadzooks I think, but at any rate I bought a Charlie the Unicorn shirt at a Goodwill in Daphne, Alabama.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Nice.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
So.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Shine the non-believer.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
Anyhow, just a special note for our live listeners.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
We're aware that there's some errors where it's cutting in and out.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
It's nothing on our end. We're not doing anything out of the ordinary.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
There's no torrents or anything like that.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
So we're going to chalk this up to our amazing internet service provider.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
But we just got to keep on right on taping for the sake of the podcast.

04:51.000 --> 04:57.000
If you do get dumped from the stream, just click pause and play again if you're at live.vognetwork.com.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
And it should reconnect right away as soon as we come back.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Unfortunately I don't know what to do about it.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
The joys of live radio.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
I might have upset the cosmic balance by my sewing.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Possibly.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
I'm doing matronly things.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Can you sew the internet back together?

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Uh, no.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Get a really big needle.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
I have really tiny needles.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
And I keep poking myself in the thumb.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
That's not going to work.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Alright, so you missed our Xbone special.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Excuse me, our XB1 special.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
All the stuff about the Xbox One.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
Did you hear anything about Xbox One?

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
Yes, and fuck all of it.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
Not getting it. No.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Well, now wait a minute, DarkSakura.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
And I think I said this on the show.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
Isn't it too early to make up your mind on this?

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
Right now, going by what I have, fuck them.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
And why so strongly?

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
Because I don't want to have a microphone and or a camera on all the damn time.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
The whole used games thing, fuck them.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
The whole downloading games, fuck them even more.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
If I'm going to download a game, it's going to be on my PC.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
Or, you know, if I buy another PC, guess what?

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
My games will transfer.

05:58.000 --> 06:05.000
Okay, well to be fair, to play devil's advocate, what's the difference between getting a digital copy on your PC that you can't sell back and a digital...

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
Because I can upgrade my video card.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
I can upgrade everything on my PC and make everything look amazing.

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
So in a way, you're saying a PC is pretty much guaranteed to be backwards compatible, no matter what.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Pretty much.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
Where's the X... Okay, I guess that's fair because the Xbox 360, anything you downloaded...

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
I've been playing Loom.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
You're just old school like that.

06:28.000 --> 06:40.000
If I can play Loom, thanks to Steam, if I can play all kinds of old PC, if I can play text-based games, if I can play Oregon Trail on my PC, I have no problem.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
Going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
Of course, again, we do tape live every Sunday night right after Bobby Black Wolf.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
It's 6 Pacific 9 Eastern on Sundays.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
Gamergirl says, thank you Dark Sakura. Clap, clap.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
That's exactly why I don't want one either.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
Koopa Kid Jeremy says, I think it's too early to decide that it's not for you.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
I kind of agree.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
Could anything at E3 end up swaying your mind?

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
That's what I'm curious about.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
What if they come out and say, the big rumor is Killer Instinct.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
It's going to be one of the games.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
What if one of these 15 games is like, OMG, you gotta have.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
What if there's a Homestuck game, Jamie?

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
What if there's a Homestuck game?

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
Well, I know for a fact already that I don't think it's, well, I think it's going to be PC anyway.

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
What if, what if, what if Mass Effect 4 is an Xbox One exclusive?

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
It's not.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
It's already going to be running on PC.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
What if, Jamie? What if?

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
I don't know that that would be enough because fuck EA.

07:30.000 --> 07:43.000
Now, keep in mind, as I've said before, I reserve judgment for more information, but as it stands right now, fuck them.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
And the horse they rode in on.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
So they need to make some big clarifications.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Yes, they do. Or big changes.

07:49.000 --> 07:56.000
They need to realize, because I think that they say statements like this and when they see people going, oh no, they go, oh shit.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Time to change it.

07:58.000 --> 08:04.000
Which is kind of where Sony might be at right now because there's really nothing out there that has said the PlayStation 4 is not going to do the exact same thing.

08:04.000 --> 08:11.000
But I think Sony is very much kind of watching this whole thing. They're kind of like sitting up there with their little opera glasses, looking at what's happening on the stage.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
You know, like what is happening to Microsoft?

08:14.000 --> 08:19.000
To tell SSJ100 Matt, is Dan getting it? We're, I think, kind of on the same boat right now.

08:19.000 --> 08:24.000
And keep in mind, you know, we aren't really the console gamers that we used to be.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
Did I tell you that my mom gave me an Atari PC game?

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
We don't own the system, so actually I was looking for one.

08:30.000 --> 08:35.000
But, I mean, other than that, you know, we're not the big console gamers we used to be.

08:35.000 --> 08:40.000
Dan's really into sim racing. He's been, you know, hooking up his PC.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
I think that for him it's going to be more of the next Gran Turismo game.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
Of course, it's just going to be PS3, but he's going to probably stick Sony.

08:47.000 --> 08:54.000
You know, especially, you know, if they say something that's going to counter all of the crap that Microsoft is saying.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
So, it was sort of a wait and see kind of thing.

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
Alright, well, I'm going to check in with you again after E3 and see if anything that has happened may have changed your mind.

09:02.000 --> 09:07.000
Oh, and to tell RageNator about Fuck Activision, I did quit WoW before I went to Alabama.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
Now that everybody is reuniting in our guild.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
Two people came back to WoW, Jamie. Two people. It's not everybody.

09:14.000 --> 09:19.000
Well, we better do, like, an old raid or something before my account expires.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
I thought your account already expired.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
No, I've got a couple days left on it. I'll find out when it expires.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
There you go.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
And then let me do, like, Ice Crown Citadel.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
You should go to Karazhan and get the pets.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
I want pets.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
There's new pets in Karazhan.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
Stop it.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Just saying.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Stop it. I stopped paying for it.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Wow, crack. Wow, crack.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
I did delete the beta, so that did free up a lot of space.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
But then I filled it up with, like, more games on Steam.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Isn't that how it always goes?

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Shut up.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
I just cleared off 100 gigs from my hard drive.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
God damn it. Steam sale. God damn it. Humble Bundle. God damn it.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
You don't have to install all of them.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Yes, you do.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
No, I don't have them all installed. I have a bunch.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
I actually have, like, the majority of them not installed.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
How dare you? I don't know when I might want to play.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
You just never know.

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
And I can never uninstall something, because the minute I uninstall it, what happens?

10:09.000 --> 10:14.000
An entire call. Gran Turismo 6 has already been stated to be for PS3.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
All right, anyhow.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Keep me strong. Tie me to the mast.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
I will hear the song, but I shall not succumb.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
This is my finger. Well, I've got a needle in my hand.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
This is my finger raised at Activision and Blizzard.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Sit and spin, motherfuckers.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Or pay for my account.

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
Oh, boy. You're just... Is there anything in gaming you do like this week?

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
I started playing Mass Effect again.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
And guess what, Rob?

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
God, I... I just can't. I can't.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
Like she won't get an Xbox One if it's Mass Effect 4.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
Right, exactly. It totally answers my earlier question.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Totally answers my... Who is she? Fucking kidding, all right?

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Who is she?

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
No!

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Oh, I can resist playing another Mass Effect game.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Nope. LOL. Nope.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
The minute... The minute Garris in HD...

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
There will not be a Garris in...

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Okay, here's...

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
They already said Mass Effect 4 is a different story.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Okay, here we go. Here we go, guys. Here we go.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
Okay, this is the first OLR comic strip I need somebody to draw, okay?

11:12.000 --> 11:17.000
You can bite my ass along with Activision Lizard and EA.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Here it is. Here it is. First panel.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
Dark Sakura holding a microphone saying,

11:21.000 --> 11:26.000
I will not buy an Xbox One. Fuck them. Fuck them and their stupid asses.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
No.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
Okay, ready? Second panel is a picture of the E3 press conference

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
where EA and Microsoft are holding hands on a stage saying,

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
Mass Effect Garris Edition Xbox One exclusive.

11:38.000 --> 11:42.000
And then the third panel is Dark Sakura walking into a Best Buy

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
with a balloon that says, LOL NOPE.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Probably.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
LOL NOPE.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Okay, okay, okay.

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
Well, first of all, I'm fairly certain that with a franchise like that,

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
they will not make it an exclusive.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
They won't. This is just fan-waking.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
I'm only saying this to get you ruffled and it's working.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
You know what?

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
You are about to earn yourself the mother of all girl.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
Just saying.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
Okay, this is this.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
And to go ahead and put the blanket thing out there.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
Yes, I will get Mass Effect 4 because I love the universe.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
I don't care how shitty the story is.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
I don't care how sparkly the turd is.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
I love the turd.

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
I will buy the sparkly turd because I am a fangirl.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
There's her little quote for the next show intro.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
I love the turd.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
All right.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
You know what?

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
I have pointy things.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
You see all these little pins?

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
Yes, and you too can get points at vognetwork.com.

12:45.000 --> 12:50.000
That's vognetwork.com where we announced earlier this evening on Bobby Black Wolf Show.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
All sorts of new loot now available on the site

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
and an awesome new feature for covering conventions.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
There's a video to explain it all to you,

12:57.000 --> 13:02.000
but in a nutshell, you will be able to direct our very own network,

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
Bobby Black Wolf representative, Bobby Black Wolf.

13:05.000 --> 13:10.000
He will be at E3 answering your questions as you direct him on the show floor.

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
It's all explained for you at e3.vognetwork.com.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Check it out.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Let's get into how was your gaming week,

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
and we'll talk about the types of video games you've been playing this week.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Dark Soccer, why don't you start us off?

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
Lul, Mass Effect.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
Of course.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
No, no, no. Guess what?

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
I bought Dramamine so that I can do the makeup missions.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
God, I'm awful.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
I have ginger pills and Dramamine.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
You bought drugs so you can play Mass Effect.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Yes.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
Because last time I played...

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
Okay, last time I had a nice two-hour session of getting side missions out of the way,

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
and I literally had to stop playing after...

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
Stop it.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
Do not YouTube me, Rob.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Rob.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Have you ever played...

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Don't watch what I'm doing over here.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
Keep talking.

13:55.000 --> 14:02.000
So I decided that I didn't want to get motion sick again,

14:02.000 --> 14:07.000
so I have plenty of things to keep me from getting sick to my stomach,

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
hopefully, just because I get super motion sick on Mako missions.

14:11.000 --> 14:15.000
I also downloaded a bunch of...

14:15.000 --> 14:21.000
It's called the ultimate high-res mod or something for the first Mass Effect

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
that has made my game look absolutely freaking gorgeous.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
Like, pretty.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
And so I have been...

14:28.000 --> 14:33.000
I'm still on the stupid first mission right after a dumbass gets shot,

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
which we all know who dumbass is.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Jenkins, sorry.

14:37.000 --> 14:41.000
So I am right after that part in my game,

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
and it kind of doesn't like all the mods,

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
but I don't care because it makes my game pretty.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
And I play DDR.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
So again, to clarify, you bought drugs so you could play a drug.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
No.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
I had the gender on.

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
Like I'm walking on sunshine.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Have you ever played Mass Effect?

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
Like I'm walking on sunshine.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
No.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
And for the record, anyone who's a fan of the first Mass Effect

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
that is interested in this mod, talk to me.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
So I played a lot of DDR.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
My calves hurt for the next two days.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
And my skin did.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
Oh no, I stretched.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
I was doing yoga in an arcade, okay?

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
But it was very fun.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
And so if you go to the one and only DDR machine

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
in all of Pace, Florida,

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
and you see D-Sakura explanation point,

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
that is me.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
On two whole songs.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
Two.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Until they reset the leaderboard at night.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
Shut up.

15:44.000 --> 15:49.000
But I was feeling old, so I passed Superstar and it made me good.

15:50.000 --> 15:57.000
So yeah, I also played a lot of Midway Arcade

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
for tickets on my iPad.

15:59.000 --> 16:03.000
Oh, I was like, the classic Midway games, like Joust and stuff.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Well yeah, but I was playing pool.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
I could not stop playing stupid pool.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
If you just want tickets in that game, just play the skeeball.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
You can just go like this, fling fling fling fling fling fling fling tickets.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
You play one game of pool and you get 200 points.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
Even if you scratch it on your first one, you still get 75 points.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
I didn't know that.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
So yeah.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
So I was like, pool, pool.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
I was so mind numbingly bored.

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
Because like, people sleep.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
It's like, I was still like, okay.

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
I actually managed to get off of West Coast time

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
because of the 40 hours I stayed awake due to

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
nine hour layovers, another three hour layover,

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
flight delays, waiting on my luggage.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
Then lying to my face about where my luggage was,

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
when I laid down on my grandmother's bed,

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
for a moment I was like, oh, the bed's kind of crooked.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
And then it was daylight.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
So my time completely reset while I was there.

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
So I, but my, still my night owl thing was like,

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
it's eight o'clock and I'm not out doing stuff.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
This is not me.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
So it was very bizarre.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
So yeah, I played a lot of Midway Arcade and Blazing Star.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Because I have Blazing Star on my iPad

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
and that game is awesome.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
The end.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
The end.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Loki, how about you?

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
Let's see.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Well, this week I played More Saints Row the Third,

17:26.000 --> 17:30.000
just trying to finish up my last few achievements on there.

17:30.000 --> 17:36.000
And then also played a bit of TrackMania.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
We tried to do VOG Gaming Night on that

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
and it just wasn't having, it was weird

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
I did everything correctly.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
Like one person was able to join my game,

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
everybody else was not able to join my game.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
And then we decided, hey, let's play on a third party server.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
So we just picked a server at random

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
that we were able to connect to.

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
And then it just like had the weirdest fucking tracks ever.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
Just these giant maze tracks

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
that were impossible to figure out where the hell you were supposed to go.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
It was ridiculous.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
But we had a little bit of fun.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
And then I played a little bit of Cave Story Plus.

18:12.000 --> 18:18.000
And I'll say play a very little bit of Call of Duty

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
because everyone was flaking the entire week.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
So that's pretty much it.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
My gaming week.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
Over the Memorial Day weekend I was staying with Captain Spike and Tim

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
who were on a previous episode a few weeks ago

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
at their Memorial Day soiree.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
And so we played a few video games.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
We watched them play Trivial Pursuit on the Xbox.

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
Which was kind of frustrating how long that game was going on

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
because you know it's Trivial Pursuit and LOL.

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
And we went out to GameStop one day randomly

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
to go find a cheap game to play.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
And we ended up buying Wheel of Fortune.

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
I should say Spike ended up buying Wheel of Fortune on the Xbox 360.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
And many lulls ensued.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
What can I say about it?

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
I'm like, you know exactly what you're going to get

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
with a game like Wheel of Fortune.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
Because you've seen the game show at some point in your life, yes?

19:07.000 --> 19:10.000
Although I have to admit the characters are a little bit derpy

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
and some of the unlocks are a little bit silly.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
But for 20 bucks, hey!

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
It provided a little bit of entertainment.

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
And some really, really hilarious instances where we were solving puzzles incorrectly

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
and throwing each other off and so forth.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
So that was fun.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
As far as other stuff I've been playing during the week,

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
I was keeping it retro.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
And thanks to some conversations I was having on Twitter

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
with not just Spike but Jeremy from Koopa Club

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
and some of the other people I talk with on Twitter,

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
I was reminded that Mario 2 came out on Virtual Console for Wii U.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
And I was like, oh, I had that on the Wii,

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
so I should just spend the dollar or whatever to upgrade it and play it.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
And not only did I play it, I played it from start to finish.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
Granted, I cheated and I used warps.

19:49.000 --> 19:54.000
But I used only Luigi the whole way through the game.

19:54.000 --> 19:59.000
In my nod to Year of Luigi, I beat Mario 2 using only Luigi.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
And I'm going to tell you what.

20:01.000 --> 20:05.000
Those ice stages that you have to play even when you warp suck with Luigi.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Yes, they do.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
Because I'm used to using the princess to just float through those little,

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
not the shy guys, what do you call the flying ones with the pitchfork?

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
I don't remember their names.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
The flurries? No, the flurries are the guys on the ground.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
Yeah, the little dudes on the ground that look like little jiggly cuffs.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
I don't remember what they're called. I call them bastards.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Yeah, they're little fuckers.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
So the little fuckers are flying in the air and the princess is easy.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
You just float in between them.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
But not so easy when you're Luigi.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
But I did it. I did it.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
When I beat the game and that was fun.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
So yeah, I was keeping it retro this week.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
I got to say, there's something about Wii U Virtual Console

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
and I'm totally having to eat my words from what I said earlier on this program

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
about a year ago when I was like,

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
Wii U Virtual Console is going to be stupid.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
Why would I pay money to upgrade and dah dah dah.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
It's just a better experience and I can't put my finger on it.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
I don't know if it's the HDMI.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
I don't know if it's the sound from the tablet

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
and the sound from the speakers at the same time.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
I don't know, but it is a better experience.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
So, oops, I was wrong.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
It happens.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
So yeah, I was having fun with Mario 2 on Virtual Console

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
and then I was playing Warcraft because, you know, I'm...

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
Addict.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
Well, I hit 90 with my Hunter, my Blood Elf Hunter.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
My PVP character.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
If you get sassy to 90...

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
Sassy is 87.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
In a row? No.

21:19.000 --> 21:24.000
When you get sassy to 90, I will re-up WoW for one month.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Just to play with sassy.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
Because I like the braids. They float.

21:29.000 --> 21:32.000
Jeremy is coaching me in chat, I guess, saying,

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
You warped. I said I warped.

21:35.000 --> 21:38.000
My next goal is to do it without warping,

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
but unfortunately I'm on a work trip this week

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
and then I have all the E3 stuff.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Oh, I'm not going to E3. There's other stuff going on.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.000
So it's going to be a little while before I can get through the game without warping.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
But that's on the list.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Except for the fact that Animal Crossing comes out Sunday

21:51.000 --> 21:55.000
and then the list will be shot because, yay, Animal Crossing.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Alright.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
It actually comes out on Fri-

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
I thought it was Sunday. Yeah.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Nintendo games are usually Sunday.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
Last of Us is coming out on a Friday.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
Oh, is it this Friday?

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
Next Friday.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
The E3 Friday? Wow.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
I don't know why. Interesting.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
Well, if no other big games are coming out, then why not?

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
Most of America doesn't go to E3, so it doesn't really matter.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
Why a Friday street day? Just put it on Tuesday.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Why not? Just in time for the weekend.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
Why do movies sometimes open on Wednesday?

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
They just- they do.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Rob. What?

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
Do you sometimes just wonder why?

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Do you ever feel not so fresh?

22:32.000 --> 22:35.000
First of all, I am incredibly crescent fresh.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
And second of all, the answer to why?

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Because.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
And then deal with it.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
See if that works with a six year old, by the way.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
With the floating sunglasses.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Did you tell the child to deal with it and then have sunglasses land on your face?

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
No, but I'm going to do that next time.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
That's hilarious to see Julian's reaction.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
Alright, housekeeping.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Visit our Twitter.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
We are on Facebook as well.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio and on the Google Plus.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
And of course, you want to visit our network.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Vog Network dot com.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Home to lots of great geeky podcasts

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
and geeky content, including video game reviews.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
I know Act F just reviewed

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Dust and Elysian Tail

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
was on the

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
site this week.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
And of course, as I mentioned before,

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
lots of exciting stuff going on for E3.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
So check out E3 dot vog network dot com.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
We will be the second site that you check.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Not the first, we'll be the second.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
And that's okay. We're number two.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Silver medal for VOG.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
It'll be great.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Let's get into some news.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Speaking of Xbox One and all that.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Lots of clarifications since our last show.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Yes, Logie?

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
A little bit. This isn't really much of a clarification

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
other than just bragging.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Saying that they're investing one billion dollars

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
ONE BILLION DOLLARS

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
into the

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
putting games on the Xbox One.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
So I'm assuming a lot of that

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
has to do with the 15 exclusives

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
that they, I guess, paid for.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
And will be coming out the first year.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
And then

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
didn't really hint at a whole lot

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
of what's coming other than

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
we know there's a Rare game coming.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
And apparently Black Tusk Studios

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
is working on something.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
Yeah.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Microsoft Studios

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
is obviously working on stuff.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
We know that there's going to be a new Forza.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Remedy's got that Quantum Break game.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
And EA's got some stuff.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Not necessarily exclusive, but

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
features that are somewhat

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
exclusive, I guess. I don't know.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
So yeah.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
They're spending quite a bit of money on that stuff.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Of course, we're going to have to

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
figure out what that is.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Maybe one of these announcements

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
has to do with a bunch of these

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
domains that they're registering, including

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
domains pertaining to a title called

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Halo Spartan Assault.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Which doesn't sound

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
like a

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
you know, it almost sounds like

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
an arcade game or something. Like a

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
spin-off.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
So, I guess we'll have to wait

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
and see. Could it be maybe an upgrade

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
or something? I'm hoping

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
it's not that. Remember, wasn't

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
there supposed to be like a

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Kinect-powered

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
game or something like that?

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
Remember, they were doing that with Gears of War,

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
I remember. Maybe it's like a Kinect

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Halo game or something.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
I don't know.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Joy, I can flail around and choose

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
weapons. Didn't one of the Halo

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
games like ODST or something incorporate Kinect?

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Like, you could shout

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
grenade and it was your grenade? No, that was the

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Halo Combat Evolved HD

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
thing. Oh yeah, that one.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Combat Evolved Anniversary.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Where you can shout grenade. There was a lot

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
of Halo games. I'm sorry, can you shout grenade

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
faster than you can press a button? No.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
No, you cannot. And that's

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
assuming that the Kinect hears you and understands

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
what you asked for. It would only be useful

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
as if what you're yelling is, how do I throw a grenade?

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
It just does it.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Oh hey, it worked! How do I throw

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
a grenade? Anyway.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
Win!

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Speaking of

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
the Kinect being able to hear you,

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
one of the controversial things, of course, we

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
got into during last week's show, I

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
expressed that this concerns me a little bit.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
DarkSakura certainly expressed earlier this

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
concerns her a bit. And you

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
know who else is concerned? Germany.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Well, anyway, the

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
German Federal Commissioner for Data Protection

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
and Freedom of Information. I did

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
not know that such a position existed in Germany,

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
but I guess it makes sense.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Certainly you want to make sure that

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
everything is regulated

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
when it comes to those exchanges,

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
but to a fault.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Anyhow, he calls it the

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Xbox One Kinect

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
monitoring device.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
That's because it is. It is.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
And he goes on to say,

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
under the heading game device, this is through

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
a translation that he mentioned

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
with the website

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Spiegel.de, but this is through

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
a translation, under the heading

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
game device, Microsoft

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
pushes a monitoring device in the market.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
The Xbox continuously records

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
all sorts of personal information about me.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Reaction rates, my learning

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
or emotional states, these are then

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
processed on an external server and

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
possibly even passed on to third parties.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Whether they will ever be deleted,

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
the person cannot influence.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
It absolutely is.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
It's what it is. It's marketing

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
metrics is what it is. They're going to be

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
listening to

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
stuff that you're talking about, and they're going to

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
advertise to you. They're going to target advertising.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
And it's just like on Facebook

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
where they try to target advertising,

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
but they're going to also make sure that

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
hey, are you paying attention to

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
those ads? What ads are

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
interesting you? That kind of stuff.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
So they're going into greater detail. And that information

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
is worth a ton

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
of money. So on top of

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
them making money off the console

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
and live and all that stuff and advertising

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
on the front page even though

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
you're paying for an online service,

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
they're going to be selling your marketing data

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
for a ton of money because they can do

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
that. That's why you're getting achievements for watching TV.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
It's because you're watching the ads.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Because they're getting all that ad data.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Well, in Microsoft's

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
defense, kind of the counter to this

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
was from Microsoft corporate vice

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
president Phil Harrison. And if that

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
name sounds familiar, it's because he used to work for a

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
different video game company, but now he works for Microsoft.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
And he was talking to Eurogamer about

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
privacy concerns, and he said that Microsoft

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
is a quote, leader in the world of

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
privacy. Continuing, we aren't

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
using Kinect to snoop on anybody at

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
all. We listen for the word

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
box on, then switch on the machine.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
But we don't transmit personal data

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
in any way, shape or form

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
that could be

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
personally identifiable to you

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
unless you explicitly opt into

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
that. What's interesting about that is

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
that basically he's saying it is there.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
You just have to opt into it, right?

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
And I remember their excuse was, well, but you can

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
turn the console off. You can

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
power the console off.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
Unplug it.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
So it sounds to me like Microsoft is

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
going to have to really clarify this. And it's

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
a valid concern about this. You know, when I got into

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
this last week is that I don't want no

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Xbox filming me when I'm running around in my underwear

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
trying to get coffee in the morning or whatever.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
You know, I don't need that. You know?

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Who knows? Who knows what might be said

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
when I yell to Allen in the other

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
room and suddenly I'm calling dark

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
soccer on Kinect and things are awkward.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
You know what I mean?

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
All I gotta say is you're going to be

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
getting a lot of targeted Pinkberry advertisements.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
And

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
and Keurig.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Right? Pinkberry and Keurig. Right?

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
I'll be there with you.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Except for the Keurig part.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
You said to buy enough of it.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Just saying if I ever get the console, I'm just

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
talking about pornography whenever I'm in front of it.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Here's what I was thinking about

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
though with the Xbox One

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
is that if I get one, which you know

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
I'm still on the fence. I don't feel

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
as strongly as Jamie does, what she said

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
earlier in the show, but I kind of have

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
very similar concerns to what she already said.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
To me it's very similar to how I

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
felt with the Wii U. It's like, okay

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
that's cool. Do I feel like buying one

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
right now? No. I don't feel like buying one.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
But I like that my Wii U is off.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
You know what I mean? And if I wanted

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
to cover the little camera on the

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
little device, or I can just

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
flip it to the wall or whatever, and it still works

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
just fine. You know? No worries. Right?

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
So

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
here's my thing is that I think

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Microsoft needs to clarify some of this.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
And I think they will, but

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
in a way, if it's just left at what

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Phil Harrison is saying, he's basically

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
saying, what? Don't you trust us?

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
We're a leader in privacy information.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Don't you trust us? What are you talking about? No one got hacked

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
before. Money wasn't stolen.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Fact, guys. Fact.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
You want me to trust a company that

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
fact sold a bunch of

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
broken Xboxes that would break after

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
several days of

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
use. My Xbox

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
360 Red Ring two days after I bought

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
it. That is a fact. Fact.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
I had money stolen from my Xbox

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Live account by a hacker, and to this day,

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Microsoft will not acknowledge that there was

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
a breach, and instead they deflect

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
blame on the user. That is a fact.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
And you want me to trust you?

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
You need to be a little

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
bit more transparent with what's

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
going on. That's the reality.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
And if I want to turn that fucker off,

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
then I should be able to turn it off.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Period. It should not require

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
that thing to be on for any reason.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Here's my other question.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
What if I just unplug

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
the fucking thing so it doesn't have a power

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
source? What if I just unplug

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
it when I don't want to use it?

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Is that going to cause it to malfunction?

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Because I could just put it on a switch

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
and have a little on-off switch.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
No, you don't even have to do that.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
It's just like the PlayStation 3

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
where there's a power

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
switch on the back of the console, and you

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
can flip it off.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
But they're just saying, though, if you're going to leave

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
it in standby mode or whatever, that the

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
microphone's going to be always listening to you so that

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
you can say, on, and it

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
will turn the Xbox on. You know what? I read

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
1984.

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
Hey, did we leave the Xbox

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
on? Ah, fuck. It's turned on

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
again.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Rama in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
says, say what you will about Microsoft,

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
but they handled the security breach a hell of a lot

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
better than Sony.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
Yes and no.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Sony at least admitted there was a problem.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
I didn't actually have any money

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
stolen from my Sony and

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
that whole thing. Nobody hacked into that or stole

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
anything. And Sony did

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
have to give a lot away

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
with that and the whole, you know, free games

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
and everything. I'm not saying that makes

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
it right. What happened with Sony was

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
not cool and was something

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
they needed to have their feet to the fire held to.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
But I kind of feel like

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
that was done and they paid for that

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
in the court of public opinion. I'm not

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
so sure Microsoft ever had to pay for that.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
But they're gonna pay for this in the court of public opinion.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
And you're starting to see it in, you know,

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
what Germany is. I mean, this is much

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
bigger news than you guys think. Germany

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
is freaking crazy when it comes to privacy laws.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Which I don't think anybody

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
here is gonna really have a problem with, right? Germany

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
is a leader in some regards in that,

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
when it comes to the privacy. So,

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
you know, if it's gonna come to the point where

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
like, yo, the Xbox will not be sold in Germany

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
unless they allow you to turn it off.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
That's gonna cause a policy change.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
It's gonna have to.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
I think it's stupid anyways to have, cause

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
let's just, I understand that the interface

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
stuff uses the Kinect.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Whoopdy shit. Do I really wanna, do I need

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
to use that? I mean, is that really

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
something that I need to use? I mean,

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
why even bother with it?

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
Just have it where you can unplug it and

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
if it's a game that requires Kinect,

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
and I mean, requires it, not like

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
shouting grenade

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
or some bullshit like that. But if it requires

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Kinect, then have it plug in. That way

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
they can still program the games, cause they know

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
that there's gonna be a Kinect there, you just

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
plug it in. But, you know, the whole thing

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
is, if it's not gonna work with the

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Kinect, what if the Kinect, you know, what if

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
a cat knocks the Kinect

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
off your shelf and it breaks?

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Fuck, now you can't play your console because

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
your stupid Kinect that you weren't using anyways

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
for stuff is just,

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
it's broken. Alright, in the interest

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
of time, I'm gonna, go ahead,

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
final thought. Wasn't it also

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
Germany that sorta had Nintendo by the balls

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
for legalities? Yes, it was the, uh,

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
the whole, did the whole zombie you

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
sell late at night thing, wasn't that a

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Germany rooted thing? Yeah. So, and

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
we saw how, you know, they had to work out

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
a deal to get that to go, so I think

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
that whatever comes out

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
of Germany, if it doesn't, if it doesn't

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
fly legally on the international

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
stage, they're gonna have to make changes.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Alright, regardless, admittedly,

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
we are making a lot of

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
opinions here based on

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
cloudy information, so Microsoft,

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
I look to you to clear up some of this cloudiness at

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
E3, and we will reformulate our opinions

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
at that time if need be, but this just

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
shows there are questions that have to be answered.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
Let's hope Microsoft answers them in a week.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
We'll know, well, a week and a half, and a week and a

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
half, we'll know. Hopefully, this

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
will all be over, and it'll all be just a

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
dream. It'll be like that one

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
season of Dallas. Anyway, DarkSakura. Well,

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
speaking of international stage, the Xbox

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
One is going to be region locked.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
So, everything that comes out

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
must match the region, and this

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
is something Microsoft told Digital Trends.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
We've already

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
pretty much seen this anyway.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
It's not a big surprise,

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
but they are going to

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
keep everything to country-specific

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
guidelines

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
before they're cleared to sail.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
I think before

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
they were saying that it was up to the developer

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
or the publisher

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
or whatever they wanted it to be region locked or not.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
A lot of games for the Xbox,

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
they don't go advertising, but a lot of them

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
are region-free.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
It's just that not everything

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
is, and a lot of them are not,

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
but it's kind of a mix,

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
whereas everything on the PlayStation 3 is

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
region-free.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
So, I think if they leave it how it is,

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
then that's fine, but I'm not surprised.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
If it is up to the studio,

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
that's one thing, but

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
the quote here says,

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
must match.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
It's very...

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
Here's where I'm at with this.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
I hear this, and I'm like,

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
yet again, it's something that's a little unclear,

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
and it's a little disappointing, but sadly,

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
I can't go, Microsoft,

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
I totally blame you for doing this, because

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
it's a real unfortunate trend.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
The only thing we saw that really bucked the trend

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
recently was the PlayStation 3.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
The original DS was region-free?

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Yes.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
All the handheld systems up to the 3DS were region-free,

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
and then the PS3 was

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
region-free as well.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
So, I can't fault Microsoft alone for this,

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
but it is worth saying, and we've said it many times

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
on this show, being that this show started

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
out of a very Japanese-centric video game,

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
a bunch of games,

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
including BeatMania,

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
and Dance Dance Revolution,

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
and all that.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
I think there's going to come a time when companies

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
need to realize,

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
gaming companies tear down

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
this wall!

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
Why do we keep separating?

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
We are a global community.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
I mean, yeah, we're becoming more and more

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
an economy. There's a lot of people here who would like

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
to play some of the shit that's out in Japan.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
There's a lot of people in Europe that would like to play some of the stuff

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
that comes out here. It's like, when are we going to get

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
a global console? Why does everything

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
still have to be separated?

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
I know you're all sitting there

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
answering the question for me, that

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
it has to do with licensing, especially when you get into

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
those music-based games. A lot of it is licensed by

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
region. But I'm just saying,

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
the internet has got to force

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
some of our ways of thinking in this,

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
to modernize. And we need to globalize

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
some of this stuff a little more and make more

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
games region-free, because

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
I'm going to be open and honest.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Region locks on the PlayStation 1

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
is what drove me to piracy.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
I don't think there's really a whole ton of

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
region locking on

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
IOS games or anything like that.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
I mean, let's be honest

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
here. There's not all these IOS games

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
that have great

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
soundtracks and high development

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
costs, that type of thing. But there are a few.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
And I know there are some music games

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
out there that

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
aren't region locked, so

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
why can they get away with it

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
when the consoles can't?

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Well, this is what I think.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
If you leave everything completely

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
region-free, and then just

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
impose import taxes,

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
it's the same thing I've sort of suggested

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
being done for companies that outsource.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Tax the crap out of them so that

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
they'd be more inclined to keep jobs

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
over here. But other than that,

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
if a company is going to have

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
say that everything's

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
region-free, will then

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
make it a little bit more expensive to import.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Have an import, you know.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Well, I always thought it was really cool that

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
there was a handful of games

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
on the 360 that were Japanese

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
where they didn't bother to translate them.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Like Death Smiles? Yeah, they just put them up

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
on the marketplace like, if you want to pay 40 bucks for it,

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
here you go. Yay!

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
We bought that Death Smiles Special

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Edition, which was pretty much

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
the exact same. Yeah.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
I wish more game companies did

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
that stuff. Well, they just did that.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
They had a new Dawn of Apache game that

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
came out, Slide.io.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
Well, I mean, if they are going to

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
region-lock the Xbox One or whatever,

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
I hope we see more stuff like that. But I just think

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
region-locking is kind of a dated

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
thing.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Anyway, more news.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Yeah.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
So, let's see. Let's talk

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
a little bit about Sony.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
I can get away from Microsoft here.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Sony is going to be

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
forcing all publishers and developers

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
to have their titles that are going to be

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
on the PlayStation 4 compatible with remote play

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
on the Vita.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
I think that's kind of cool, actually.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
More reasons than via Vita.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
It's a smart

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
little jab at Nintendo

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
and the fact that a lot of the whole

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Wii U is the whole off-screen

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
play, Nintendo won't be able to

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
claim exclusivity

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
to that anymore.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
Although, granted, the Vita is a

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
separate device, it's probably going to cost you more

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
to do it via the PS4.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
It's a

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
logical movement of the

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
chess piece, if you will.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
But it's even better, though, than just off-screen

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
play with the Wii U because if you're in a

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
Wi-Fi hotspot somewhere else,

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
and I'm assuming that this is all going to be streamed

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
through their Gaikai stuff now,

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
you're going to be able to play your games

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
away from home.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
Oh, interesting. I didn't even think of that.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
I was just assuming it would be very

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
and I didn't even think it would necessarily

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
be Wi-Fi, but that's very

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
interesting.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
I think it's just going to be wherever you are.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
That would be kind of cool.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
That would be really cool if it would work, but if you have an

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
internet connection like what we have here trying to do the show,

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
it might drop out.

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
LOL game over.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
As a concept,

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
back in the days of Neo Geo where you had the memory card

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
where you could play on the arcade and then take it

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
home if you had the system, wouldn't

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
it sort of be almost the same thing?

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
Especially if you

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
incorporated the share function?

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Actually, Jamie, now that I think about it,

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
the PS3 and the PSP,

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
yes, PSP, do this today.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
We talked about this on the show, how this is a

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
horribly underlooked feature

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
of these consoles, but if I'm

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
at a friend's house on their

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
Wi-Fi, if I have my PlayStation 3

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
set to listen for it, I can power

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
on my PlayStation 3 from my

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
friend's house and over the Wi-Fi,

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
navigate my PlayStation 3.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
All this technology is there right now.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
It's just that it's slow as shit

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
and you can't play games through it.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
You can only do things like watch movies

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
and even then they're going to be a little bit shotty.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Maybe music would work.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
But look at where the technology is going to be in two years.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Exactly. Now that Sony has Gaikai, what if

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
PlayStation 4, and Loki, I think you hit the nail on the

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
head, what if the PlayStation 4 is a

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Gaikai box and they're leveraging that technology

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
to oomph that up a lot?

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
We're already looking

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
into these

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
massive

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
advancements in

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
communication regardless.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
They're already working on quantum communication.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
What's

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
to say that in five, ten years

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
this is going to be the norm?

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
It's always harder to look ahead in a way

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
because honestly, think back to when

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
we were like nine and ten years old.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
We'll even go a little

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
later. I know

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
a lot of our listeners are younger, something that maybe a lot

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
of you guys remember. So think to the time

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
that was like 1990, 91 or so

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
when the Super Nintendo was big.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
And the Super Nintendo was first coming out.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
When you first saw that Mode 7 for the first time

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
it's like, oh my

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
god, I'm really flying.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
This shit is real.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Or Star Fox.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Right? Stunt Race.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
That shit was amazing and we were like

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
this is real on my TV.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
This is the future.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
And who would have thought

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
anything like Bluray

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
would exist 25 years

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
from then, which is where we are now.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
And that it would be replacing, you know,

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
all of us back in the day who said laserdisc

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
was the future, we were right.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
All of that came from laserdisc

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
technology. In a way.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
Yeah, but digital encoding.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Who knew that we would be replacing all of

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
our TVs? Who knew we wouldn't have to change

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
sides? Who knew

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
who knew that the government

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
would come in and say

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
everybody must switch from analog to

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
digital. Like, we are going to switch as a country

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
from analog to digital signals for TV.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
Like, that's just, you know, you don't know.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Who knows where we're going to be in 25 years?

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
Who knew? It's exciting and scary.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
Back when I was playing kangaroo

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
on the Atari 2600

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
that I would be playing Mass Effect today.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
Who knew

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
three years ago on this show

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
when you were like, I don't want to play that game.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
It's like a stupid shoot about, I don't want to play

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
that. More like

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
dumb effect. I don't want to

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
romance the blue chick.

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
Which I did once just so I could dump her.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Which is hilarious.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Just saying.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
Alright. Anyhow.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Well, in about 25

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
years, that might be the time when you can

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
actually play Blizzard's next MMO.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
They've been working on a new game

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
that's called Titan, but that's a

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
code name. That is not the final name of the game.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
That's just the code name internally. But it

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
came out this week from a site named VentureBeat

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
that there had been some big changes

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
with Titan. Blizzard internally

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
has postponed this game. There were

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
100 people working on the project, but this has

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
been reduced to 30. The other

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
folks had been put to work on other games.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Titan never had a release

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
date. It was never really confirmed by Blizzard.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
But again, rumor and

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
all this, you know, speak is

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
saying that now the game will not be ready

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
until 2016. Well now,

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
usually I would just say whatever

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
it's a rumor, you know, I

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
don't know what to think about this. But

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
the network Xam, which

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
runs some popular World of Warcraft

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
sites like Wowhead, if you've played Wow, you probably

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
know that site, wowhead.com. Oh, Wowhead.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
They reached out to Blizzard

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
and Blizzard actually said,

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
quote, we've always had a

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
highly iterative development process and the

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
unannounced MMO is no exception.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
We've come to a point where we need to make some large

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
design and technology changes to the game.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
We're using this opportunity to shift some of

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
our resources to assist with other projects, while

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
the core team adapts our technology

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
and tools to accommodate these new

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
changes. Note that we haven't announced any

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
dates for the MMO.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
They kind of confirmed it

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
by saying that, which is really weird.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Like, you just would not expect Blizzard to

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
be that transparent, but they said

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
that. So,

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
but if you kind of look at what they're saying,

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
they're holding the game back to make technology

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
changes. That says to me, this thing

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
has been in development so long that

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
now it's looking old. It's been in

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
development Duke Nukem forever long.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
In a way. I mean, I don't think it's been in

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
development Diablo 3 long, but it's getting

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
there. This thing's been in development for quite

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
a while. Now, granted, I

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
for one can't get upset about a game I

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
know literally nothing about. I mean,

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
it's exciting to know that Blizzard is working on

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
some secret unannounced project,

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
but I'm very happy to hear that nobody was laid

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
off. And if they shifted these

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
people to other resources, that just means

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
their other shit will get done faster, like

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Hearthstone, the next WoW expansion might be

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
that much better for it. Maybe this

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
Blizzard Dota clone

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
that's All-Stars Blizzard characters,

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
maybe that will be that much better and will

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
actually come out sometime soon. Maybe we'll see that at

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
BlizzCon. Who knows? But,

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
so I can't say I'm going to get upset about this news,

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
especially hearing that they're going to shift the resources elsewhere,

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
but, you know,

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
it's a little bit, you kind of want to go,

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
I wish I could see what Blizzard's going to do that's like,

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
that's not Warcraft.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
And granted, this could be World of Warcraft 2.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
It could be.

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
Oh no, it took

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
Ragnarok Online long enough to get to a sequel.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
I sort of think, I don't know, Tinfoil Hat

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
maybe, but I sort of think that the

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
next WoW expansion is going to finally

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
give that big graphical upgrade that's

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
going to modernize it, and they're not going to need

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
a World of Warcraft 2. Like, I just,

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
I just don't see Blizzard trying to make that happen

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
because it doesn't always happen so well for other

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
MMOs. But, then again,

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
Guild Wars and Guild Wars 2, coexisting

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
fine. Final Fantasy 11,

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
Final Fantasy XIV Reborn,

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
too soon to tell, but

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
looks promising.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
Final Fantasy XIV, sorry,

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
pretty. Yeah, no, I know.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
Cannot wait. Well, that's the importance of technology.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
So, alright, anyhow,

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
one more story and then release dates. Dark Sakura.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
Well, in other news,

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
and, god, what a disgusting ad

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
on this page.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
Um, there,

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
okay, who remembers the rumor,

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
the big urban legend, about

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
a bajillion Atari

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
2600 ET cartridges

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
being buried.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
I've definitely heard that, but they were melted

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
down before they were buried.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
That's what I heard, and I think that's important to know.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
Well, um, there is an

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
Ontario-based production company

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
called Fuel that

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
has signed a deal with

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
the, uh, basically,

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
it's a town in New Mexico,

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
I'm gonna ruin this, Alamogordo?

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Alamogordo. Alamogordo, thank you.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
Where the landfill

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
that supposedly, not just

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
E3 cartridges, but a ton of

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
Atari prototypes, prototype games,

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
prototype systems, anything that

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
was in development that they ended up not releasing

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
going into this dump. And the city

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
has given this production

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
company permission

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
to go digging through the dump.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
They're going huge dumpster diving

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
in a landfill. This is digging

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
up a dead body

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
to see what the real cause of death was.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
This is what this is.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
To do a DNA test.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
To give history to the urban legend,

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
they basically believed, and it wasn't melted down,

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
that they were crushed.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
And loaded into, um,

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
semis and then buried.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Um,

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
but the, uh,

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
basically the mayor of there is saying

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
that they, uh, want people to find out

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
about the town because of the

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
landfill.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
They're hoping it's good PR for the town.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
So now it's a tourist thing. We have a bunch of shit games

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
in the dumpster back here.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
Although, you know what, if they're prototypes

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
and stuff too though, that's the real gold mine.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
Well, and you know that, um,

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
there are people who have, I'm saying,

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
escaped with prototypes

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
just in jest.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
But you find a lot of 5200

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
prototypes, um,

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
online for sale. Where people have

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
gotten legit ROM dumps

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
and reconstituted

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
them for sale.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Our copy of Millipede for 5200

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
was, um, a, uh,

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
prototype.

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
But they crushed these, I mean, I had always heard they melted them down

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
but crushed makes a lot more sense.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
You put them in the trash compactor and they crush down. They did that so that

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
looters wouldn't dig them up and try to sell them.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
So, I mean, but then,

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
what's the point? You're gonna dig up

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
literally garbage that doesn't work.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
It's 25 years old. Those things,

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
if a board is sitting outside a case that long

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
it's not gonna work. But if a memory chip

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
happens to have been compressed within

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
Good luck. I know, but

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
but the whole thing is that

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
the

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
there's a chance that it exists.

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
And people who

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
especially big

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
video game history buffs, Atari

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
fans, they're gonna drop

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
you know, the opportunity

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
to take, to see if there is

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
anything salvageable. Uh, Dungeon

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
Buster in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
ET sucks. Dungeon Buster in the chatroom

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
at live.vognetwork.com says, I hope

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
that doesn't turn into another Capone's vault.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
Will Geraldo Rivera be there when they

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
unearth the big massive ET cartridges?

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
Will he be there, live?

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
Does he have a career still?

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
No? So yes,

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
he will be.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
He didn't, didn't the angry

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
video game nerd, like that was like the

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
basis of his movie was going to the dump to find

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
if the game exists. I

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
don't even know. I never saw it.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
All right. Well, if we're done with the Atari story, I want

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
to go back real quick to the Titan thing because Technus

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com made a very

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
good point about this. I want to throw this out there.

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
Technus says, I would speculate that

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
Bungie beat them to the punch with

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
Destiny and they needed to reset

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
after Activision picked up Bungie.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
That's a really good theory

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
because again, rumors and

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
whisperings and you know, who knows

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
how much we can lend to this, but I did

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
hear that Titan was quite a bit like what

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
Destiny sounds like it's going to be. That

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
it was less of a shooter per se,

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
but that a lot of the same stuff they're talking

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
about implementing with

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
Destiny was supposed to be the types of stuff they

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
were doing with Titan too. You know,

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
take with a gigantic grain of salt.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
Take with an entire can of salt actually.

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
Take with all the salt in the ocean. Salt lick.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
Salt lick.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
There you go. I have to

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
quote Queen Semia in chat. They find Hafa

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
under the pile. Plot twist.

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
Masked Bishop with some strong

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
opinions on Realm Reborn.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
By the way, Final Fantasy XIV Realm

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
Reborn will succeed. If you think

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Square Enix will let the Final Fantasy franchise

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
fail, you're sadly mistaken.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
Final Fantasy XIV Realm

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
Reborn will be the next game changer.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
I'll say this much, it's

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
impressive that they, I mean,

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
the second half of what he said at least

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
is true because Square

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
Enix put a lot of money to

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
basically redo the fucking game

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
from scratch. And you can see it.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
You can really tell.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
It's going to be interesting. Free to play

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
Final Fantasy XI. Come on.

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
Wouldn't that be something?

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
We'll see. Alright, let's check out

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
some games that will be coming out a little bit

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
sooner than Final Fantasy XV

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
or whatever else

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
we're thinking about here. Release dates.

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
Alright, so this week we've got PlayStation 3

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
or on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Remember

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
me? Coming out from Capcom.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
Receiving kind of mixed reviews, but

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
whatever. Animal

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
Crossing on the 3DS or

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
Animal Crossing New Leaf

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
on the 3DS because there's

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
one single new leaf

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
in the game and the rest is all the same as the last

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
one.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
The Skyrim,

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
Elder Scrolls V Skyrim Legendary Edition

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
kind of re-released the game with the

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
DLC on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
and PC.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
And at long

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
last, if you don't have the

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
internet and you

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
want to play Minecraft, Minecraft

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
on the Xbox 360, the Xbox

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
360 version is coming out as a

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
disc version. That might be a

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
good one for the Xbox 360 in the kid's

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
room that's not hooked up to the internet.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
I could see that being a plus because Minecraft

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
is a pretty friendly kid's game. It is an awesome

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
game. So,

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
there's that. And that's

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
pretty much it this week.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
Alright, coming out

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
in Japan on the PlayStation 3

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
Galgun gets a price reduction into the

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
best series. Haha, yeah. And there's

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
another game called

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
Narawatera Gakuen

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
Gekijoban Anime

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
and Complete Setting Book Hybrid

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
Disc. So I think this is actually the

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
anime and like a game

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
based on the anime all on one disc.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
That is my, because you see this happening more

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
and more in Japan where you get

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
like the bundled Blu-ray that

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
has a game and a movie or at least, you know

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
two separate Blu-rays or whatever

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
in a bundle collection. On the

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Xbox 360, Halo Origin Pack

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
this week in Japan for all

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
you Halo fans in Origin. Also, Minecraft

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
Xbox 360 edition, the standalone game

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
is out in Japan as well. And a new

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
camouflage 360 wireless controller

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
in Japan. I guess this is to go with the Halo

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
Origin Pack. Which by the way

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
quickly while it's on my mind

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
do you think Microsoft at E3

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
is going to have anything to kind of throw something

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
at Japan to try and make it

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
work there? I don't think they're going to try.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
Really? Yeah. I thought I read somewhere that

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
they did say they are committed to Japan but

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
that could have just been smoke up my ass. I don't know. I think it's smoke

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
up their ass. They'll release a game with

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
a pillow and a clock. It's just

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
I think the market's so small there

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
now. It's just, I don't know

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
they're just more focused on the larger market.

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
Microsoft's market is small but

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
certainly there's, handhelds

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
is really what it seems to be about.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
Nothing of note on the

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
PlayStation Vita this week.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
Looking at, oh I already did

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
Xbox 360. Way to go.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
Seeing if there's anything on the Wii U. Actually yes,

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
Rabbids Land is supposed to be out in Japan this week.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
The game that got delayed here

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
supposedly coming out in Japan.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
No, Rabbids Land was a launch title

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
for the Wii U. Oh, I'm thinking of the

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
other Rabbids game. Yeah, you're thinking of Rayman

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
Legends. My bad. My bad.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
Let's see, on the

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
3DS in Japan this week

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
nothing of note.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
On the PSP this week

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
God Eater Burst gets a price

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
reduction. So lots of price

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
reductions this week but really not a lot of new games

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
until we get to about June 20th.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Seems to be when the next batch of big games comes out.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
Really

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
nothing to say on Nintendo 3DS either.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
Japan gets Donkey Kong Returns 3D

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
next week on the 13th

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
and a metallic red DS to go with that.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
I did pick up Donkey Kong Country Returns by the way

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
for my DS. Haven't really played enough of it yet

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
to review it though. On my plane

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
ride this week I plan to play some more of it so

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
I'll let you know. Did I tell you we might finally

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
be getting 3DSes? Oh no,

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
that's great. Because there's gonna be

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
like a new massive

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
uh

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
I know Apollo Justice is in it.

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
I'm trying to remember. Oh, Phoenix Wright.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
Phoenix Wright, thank you.

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
A new game coming out and Fire Emblem

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
and then I want

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
Animal Crossing.

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
Alright, how about the UK? What's coming out over there?

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
Some stuff. On the 3rd we have

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
Gunpoint for PC

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
and Scrolls for PC and Mac

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
and on 7th we have Remember Me

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
PC, Xbox 360, PS3 and that would be it.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
To register participation for this week's

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
episode of Orange Lounge Radio at

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
vognetwork.com, use the passphrase

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
OVEN.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
Just a couple more stories for you guys than the classic

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
game of the week, but first, Loki.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
Um, so this is kind of

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
I guess

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
the best news that could come out of the situation

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
because we know that this is only alluding to

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
worse things to come

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
on the next gen consoles

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
but EA is eliminating, they

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
already went ahead and said that they're not gonna have

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
the online pass in any future games

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
and now they're going back and retroactively

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
taking away the online pass

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
from all the old games as well

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
so the online pass now is free

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
so if you wanna, you know

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
play a used EA game

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
that had the online pass, you buy the game

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
and then you activate

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
the online pass for free. So that's

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
nice.

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
There's just something about this.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
As we just continue

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
online pass for our new EA titles

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
we're also in the process of eliminating it from our

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
existing EA titles. We heard the feedback

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
from players and decided to do away with

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
the online pass altogether.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Yeah.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
I don't trust them. I totally

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
believe that you, oh what we're doing

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
is wrong. You know what?

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
I don't know what it is. I don't know what it is

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
and maybe I am just being

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
a jerk, but it's like one of those things where it's like

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
are you sure that when you download the free

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
thing it doesn't say, uh, but you

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
are giving us your soul? Like are you sure there's

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
nothing in there like that? I just

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
worry. I'm sorry but

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
I know better.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
It's just, it's

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
so much bullshit. I just don't

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
believe any of that crap.

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
I roll my eyes.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
We've made too much money

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
America and the world and

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
we're just gonna stop making

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
extra money now because we have all the money that

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
we need to run those servers now so we don't need

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
any of your online passes anymore because

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
servers all of a sudden got cheaper to run.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
No, I'm sorry. That's

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
this is a company that makes

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
money. They're not gonna say, hey, we

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
hate money all of a sudden. Right?

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
No. There's just something I don't

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
trust.

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
Call me a conspiracy

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
there. Or maybe, you know, if

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
I take this as an actual

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
legit sign, maybe it's them trying to get away from the

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
business tactics of the former CEO.

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
Now you're being

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
nice. I know. I've decided to

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
play angels advocate.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
Or it could be

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
in-game purchases

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
in Dead Space 3

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
in future games.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
But if

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
I want to put it at a non-conspiracy

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
theory point of view, even though

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
I trust EA as far as

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
I can pick up the entire building and

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
nudge it,

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
maybe

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
it is trying to separate themselves from former business

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
practice. Or it's trying to get people to

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
install Origin, which I will not fucking

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
do.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Tigerclaw with a theory in chat at

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
live.vognetware.com says, EA removes

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
the online pass

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
so people can play the used

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
games online. And then a few months later,

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
EA shuts down the online servers to those games.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
Actually,

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
that is kind of funny. But here's the thing

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
with some of these games. They're

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
not online games.

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
That was the thing that was

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
kind of the funny part about the online pass. Remember

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
like, Dragon Age Origins,

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
Dragon Age 2.

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
Mass Effect 2 had that Cerberus pass, and it wasn't

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
really, you didn't play online.

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
It was DLC.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
My hope is that with all of this

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
that it means I won't have to fucking be online

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
for my DLC in Mass Effect 3 to load.

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
Because I paid for a lot of it.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
Okay, I'm a

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
consumer whore, I don't care.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
And how.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Yeah, mister, I'm gonna

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
buy Mass Effect 3 trilogy and

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
run it on Xbox and PC.

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
You know what, you're worse than me, okay?

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
Okay, well,

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
maybe I play more than you do.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
I play other games too, though.

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
You're seriously like my dealer, you and

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
Shane. I blame you

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
for everything that happens in my life.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Shane is worse. And I haven't started on

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Persona, so.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Don't resist. I will resist.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
My will is strong.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
My will is titanium. By the way, there's now

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
music from Persona 4 in rotation at

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
I just put some in today.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
You know what, I actually kind of

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
I'm playing too much shit already.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Alright.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Going to one more story here.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
This actually came up last week, but

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
it's too good for us to skip completely on our

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
show. We've gotta mention it. Actually, maybe

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
it, I don't, when did this finish? I think it

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
finished like on Saturday or Sunday

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
of last week. But anyhow, here's the

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
deal. So, did you guys ever check out the

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
iPhone and Android game? Curiosity!

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
What's in the cube?

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
It's Peter Molyneux's dick

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
in a box. Remember this game where you

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
tap the little cube? If this was last week, this

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
was me not having much in the way of internet

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
access, except for Tumblr.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Finally, what was in the box

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
was revealed. Some dude opened

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
the box. You win nothing!

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
You're so stupid!

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Well, here's what's

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
amazing. The guy who won is an

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
18 year old guy, Brian Henderson. He

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
lives in Edinburgh. And he

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
won. And the great thing about

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
it, he ended up tweeting or saying in an

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
interview, I don't remember where it was, but he said,

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
yeah, I just downloaded the game an hour

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
before I won it.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
So, what was in

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
the goddamn cube? See, I would have

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
played to the very end, too, if I had remembered

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
that it was ending, but I was just like, eh, I don't fucking

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
care. Here's, guess what was in the

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
goddamn cube. I'm sure many of you have heard, but here's

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
what was in the cube.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
You, again, now 22Cans

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
is, they did Curiosity. Their next

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
project is like a populous reimagining

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
called Goddess. Well,

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Brian will be

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
the god in Goddess.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
At the

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Stardust. No.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
But he will be, he will be in...

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
You don't know shit.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
I can't believe this.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Some new kid from the

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
street won this. You don't

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
know shit.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
You are a whore, darlin'.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
A show where we can fall into

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
showgirls' quotes is a good show.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
That game is called Goddess, and it just

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
makes me think of showgirls. Sorry, Nomi Malone.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
That's right. Nomi Malone from

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Edinburgh.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
I'm sorry to this kid. This poor kid didn't ask

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
for this, so I'm very sorry.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
But I'm gonna make the joke anyway. I'm doing the hand

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
flashies in my head.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Nomi Malone

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
from Edinburgh opened the

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
cube and will get to be the god

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
in Goddess.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
And apparently,

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
not only will he be the god, but he will

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
have a hand in creating the rules that will

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
govern the game. So it's

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
his rules, or get out, and Brian

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
gets to share in the revenue

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
generated by Goddess. But they're saying

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
in one year, he could be

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
pushed down a flight of stairs

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
and a new Goddess

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
could emerge.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Here's the thing.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
When did this

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
whole thing, this cube

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
thing launched, like what, seven months

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
ago, right? Didn't Goddess

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
get kick-started midway through

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
this project? Kick-started? Yeah, that's

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
my new verb. Didn't it get kick-started?

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Where would it be kick-started? Kick-started.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Cause the website is kick-starter.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Not kick-start. Alright.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Are you gonna kick-start my heart? No.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
So Goddess got

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
kick-started halfway through

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
the run of

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
cube. What if it hadn't gone

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
through? Then what would have been

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
in the cube?

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
I got you!

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
You are making this shit

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
up as you go along, Peter Molyneux.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
I got you!

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Shrugner's box

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
or whatever, it's basically...

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
There's a dead cat who's not dead.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Yeah, so it's Goddess, but

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
not Goddess. We won't

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
know, because it was Goddess in the box

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
and not Goddess dead

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
having eaten the poison.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
You know what it would have been?

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
It would have been a dog.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
He would have adopted a dog for you. It would have been

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
life-changing.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
A dog. Or,

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
guess what?

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
I've got this

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
boy named Milo, and you're going to

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
adopt him.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Having kids is gonna

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
change your life.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Milo will change your life.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Milo needs

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
his diaper changed every five seconds

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
and you'll want to die.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Alright, well we reached out to Peter Molyneux

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
for comment on Goddess, and this is what

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
he had to say.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Must be weird not having anybody come on you.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
What does that even mean?

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
What does that

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
even mean?

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
That was a quote from

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Showgirls, get it? Alright. I will give you the

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
best Fable game ever made.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
It's Fable

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Fable the Journey. It uses

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Kinect. It's fantastic. It's not on

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
rails. It's not on rails.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Oh, shit. Alright, let's go. Hey, I'll tell you what.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
You know what? I've been inside the box if

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
perhaps Peter Molyneux wasn't backing this

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
and it was the Steam Box.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Hats! Would have been fucking hats.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Lots of hats. Hats, hats, hats.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Let's travel.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Let's travel back. Do we have like a

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
gif?

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
I think

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
it's funny that we both grunted at him

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
at the same time.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
I don't care what he said.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
It is gif. I do not care.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
I disavow him. Anyway, wouldn't it be

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
awesome if they had like an animated gif?

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
They had like, you know, the Matrix thing

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
where all these hats come in. We're gonna need hats.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Woof.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Okay, Rob, you sounded like

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Grover slash Yoda.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Near

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
far.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Let's travel back to a time.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
When gaming was

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
so much simpler. When you know what

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Elizabeth Berkley was Jessie Spano

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
and you hadn't seen her boobies yet. It's a much

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
simpler time. It's the classic game

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
of the week. Dark

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Sonic R.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Yes, it is Sonic R. I have finally

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
decided to do fucking Sonic R.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
So.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Sonic R

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
was done by Traveler's Tales

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
and Sonic Team and it came

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
out on the Sega Saturn

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
and Windows.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
It was out for Windows, which actually,

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
if you've got a decent graphics card, the Windows version

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
actually looks a lot better and plays better.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
It came out in the US on October 31,

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
1997 and then

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
later it came out in

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Europe, Australia, and Japan all at the same time

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
and was re-released for PlayStation 2

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
and the GameCube as part of

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
the Sonic Gems collection.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
It is basically

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
the last of the

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
two, I'm sorry, the third Sonic

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
racing game and the last of

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
two games that was done by Traveler's Tales

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
and Sonic Team. So basically, it's a huge

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
foot race. That's what the game is.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
And it's single or

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
multiplayer. You can race.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
You have ten different Sonic characters

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
and

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
you know, you can pick

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
up like, you have to collect

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
rings on the way to open up different parts of

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
the race track. You also

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
can get like

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
different shields like what's

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
in Sonic 3. Like you can actually get a lightning

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
shield that attracts rings to you.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
And you

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
have different areas

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
that are sort of based off of

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
various places

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
in the different Sonic games. Like you have a place

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
that looks like the Green Hill Zone and a place that looks like

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
the Chemical Plant. You

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
have those item panels like I was talking about

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
that give you different abilities

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
as you go. Like you can run on water

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
or attract rings. And

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
then you get Sonic Tokens and

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Chaos Emeralds. And the Chaos Emeralds

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
help you unlock secret characters.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
You also have different kinds of weather.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
You have clear, you have rain, you have snow.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
But the snow does

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
make the water free so you can run over

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
it instead of being slowed

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
down by it. And

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
you have a time attack mode to see basically

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
who has the fastest time. So

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
the characters in this one

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
is you are, let's see,

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
you have Sonic and he has double jump.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
He's also the fastest. Tails

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
actually has the ability to fly. Knuckles

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
can glide.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
And then you have Amy

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Rose who actually drives a car. And she

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
can hover over water and gets extra

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
speed boost. For

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
your secret characters you have

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Robotnik, also known as Eggman.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
He has a hovercraft

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
and can resist terrain. You have

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Metal Sonic. You have

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
a Tails doll and you have

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Metal Knuckles. You have

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Egg Robo and Super

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Sonic. So basically when you have all the Chaos

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Emeralds you can play as Super Sonic and you just

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
sort of float over everything.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
The game actually

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
came out after Sonic 3D Blast

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
when Sega was working with Traveler's

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Tails on a different Sonic game.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
And they had also

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
been working on a 3D graphics

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
engine that they didn't really have anything

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
for so they decided to work with Sonic Team to make

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
the game. Pretty much just

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
everything that came together.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
So there's actually even

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
a Sonic R that came out on the

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Tiger handheld system.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Of course like I said

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
there was the Sega Saturn version that actually

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
had some really bad problems with draw distance

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
and clipping.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
But the PC version

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
let you use better rendering

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
and 3D acceleration and you

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
could adjust the draw distance. So basically like

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
today you could have no draw distance

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
at all in the game. It would be gorgeous.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
The music was done by Richard

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Jacques of Sega Europe

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
who also did the music

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
for Sonic 3D Blast.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
And he

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
basically worked with Yuji Naka

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
to

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
basically design the musical

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
feel of the game.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
And that's where we got the Super Sonic Racing.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
And then the

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
singer in this one, now this I didn't know, her name

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
is TJ Davis and she did

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
all of the singing in it at

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Yuji Naka's request.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
So basically

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
it was done by a London

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
studio. The music came out of

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
London.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
I think it's a fun game. It's sort of

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
not like the world's best

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Sonic game. But it's a really

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
fun game. And from that we also

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
got

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
well there were two games that came out before

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
Sonic R. There was Sonic Drift and Sonic Drift 2

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
for Game Gear. And then

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
after that we've gotten Sonic Riders

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
we've gotten Sonic Riders

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Zero Gravity, Sonic Free Riders,

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing,

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
and the Transformed version as well.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Those are all pretty much born out of the Sonic R

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
franchise. And

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
of course the music is

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
you know, pretty much the big

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
iconic thing about it. It's not the most

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
gorgeous game. But it's super fun.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Like we said

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
we say a system is only as good as the games

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
that are on it. But the games are also

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
can be

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
absolutely amazing without

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
having to look, you know, absolutely gorgeous.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
You know what I mean? And this is one of

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
those that falls into that

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
category. So my game

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
of the week is Sonic R.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
This is one of those games that to me just made

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
sense. Like Sonic in a racing game.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Why did it take so long?

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Kinda right.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
And it did have some good music.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
Super Sonic Racing was in Sonic R,

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Tiger Hall.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Alright. There it is, your classic game of the week

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Sonic R.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Good pick.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Have you done every single Sonic game yet? You gotta be getting close.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
I've done a few of them.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
But keep in mind there's a bunch of crap out there

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
in the Sonic franchise.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
I would get

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Sonic herpes or something.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Alright. We're gonna take a break and when we

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
come back there is still more news to come in the

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Fugu question of the week. Oh and to tell what up G?

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Same music in Japan.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
All out of the London studio. So there's none of this

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
whole one soundtrack? No there's not.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Just making sure. Good. At least we can all agree on something.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Okay. Plenty more

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
to come when Orange Lounge Radio returns

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
with this episode number 506

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Second Mix J Append Part B

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
right after this.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
Hola.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
This is your friendly neighborhood Mexican

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Acta. And you're participating with

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Orange Lounge Radio. The show where

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
every gamer has a voice.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
And I want to use my voice to tell you that

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Kirby does not suck.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Well, literally he does suck.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
But not fear of the blue.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Anyways, play more Kirby.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
I'll see you in the next video.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Bye.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
That's right. Play more Kirby.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
They have that whole Wii U virtual console thing going on

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
right now. I was tempted to get the

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Kirby golf

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
was it Kirby's Dream Course that they had at Super

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Nintendo? It was like the miniature golf game.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
I think it was awesome.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Good times. There you go.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
You too can leave a bumper.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Go to vognetwork.com and check out the

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
forums for Orange Lounge Radio and more information

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
on there if you want to use your voice

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
to tell the gaming world something. Maybe

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
you want them to play less Kirby.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
You can tell us that in a future bumper.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
That was the last one that I had in the queue by the way.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
So you're going to start hearing repeats if I don't

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
get any new ones for the next show. Just saying.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
That's my little threat. Just saying.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
Alright.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
During the break tonight, before we get into rapid fire

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
news, I noticed some of the chatters were talking about

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Civ 5. And I don't know how this got brought up

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
but apparently the Mass Effect mods

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
for Civ 5. I thought

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
I mentioned this on the show before. Yes, they exist

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
and they're awesome.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Fun fact.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
You once said that about Mass

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Effects.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Here's something.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
I have never

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
liked that type of game.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
I didn't even...

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
I admit that...

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
What game is it I'm thinking of now?

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Not Populous.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Well, I didn't like Populous either.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
SimCity?

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Are we? Uh oh.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
I thought I hit all the buttons.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
I just happened to look over and saw that we were

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
muted so all of this conversation that's

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
happening...

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Professional radio folks.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
You know what?

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Rob was giving me crap for not

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
wanting to play Civ even though there's

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
a Mass Effect mod. And I

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
was telling him how I did not like

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
Civ. I don't

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
like SimCity.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
I do not like SimCoaster.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Although I do like watching the coasters

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
that people have made on SimCoaster.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
I don't like SimPark.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
I like the Sims, but really I like building

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
houses and dressing them up.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
And murdering them. What about SimAnt?

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
I don't like SimAnt either.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
I loved SimAnt. That game was amazing.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
I do like semantics.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Ha ha ha.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
But what's the game I'm thinking of? It's not Populous.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
It's where you're the avatar

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
of the god and you go and you

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
fight demons and you build the town

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
and make them worship you and shit.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Actraiser? Thank you, Actraiser. I don't even

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
really care for Actraiser that much.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Get out. Let me finish.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
I like watching other people play

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Actraiser. I get pissed

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
off. So I

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
don't have the patience for Actraiser.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Two things about Actraiser. A. The soundtrack.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Is great. B.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
When that angel flies around you can see his butt.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
It was butt.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
And this is how Rob first learned. No.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
It was butt on the Super Nintendo.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
So it made you giggle a little bit. You know butt.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
It was butt.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
You know what? Butt.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Ha ha ha. That's what.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
No. From now on it's said chicken but it's angel butt.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Guess what? Angel butt.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Alright. Let's go around

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
and talk about rapidly what's

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
happening in the world of gaming. Some quick stories.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Rapid fire news.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
This may be a bit of a spoiler but

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
we think

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
maybe Mirrors Edge 2 might be coming to the

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Xbox One. Apparently there was

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
first off a listing on

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
an Italian. The German and

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Italian storefronts for Amazon.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
And those are removed.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Listing it was for the Xbox One.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
And then

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
on EA's own website

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
in the help

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
section. Their help center.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Had a page for Mirrors Edge 2 and now

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
it's gone. So

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
makes me think that maybe

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
that's going to be one of the announcements.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Perhaps.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
I guess we'll find out. Yes please.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
And then

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
of course Prey 2

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
has been in development forever.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
And now apparently

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
it's going to be under development by

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Arkane Austin which was

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
the studio behind Dishonored.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
So that sounds good because Dishonored wasn't that bad.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
And yeah

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
they don't have any. They have no

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
information to share but

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
that's the rumor at least.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
That hasn't been cancelled.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
And last but not least

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
um

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
El Shaddai. I don't know if

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
you guys remember that game. It's kind of an

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
artsy action game from

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Ignition. Well now

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
the rights

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
have been transferred to the creator.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
So now there's going to be

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
well El Shaddai is now

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
back in the creators

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
I guess portfolio

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
as far as the rights go and maybe

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
that means it's going to open up opportunity

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
for more games. You know what's making me cry right now?

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Every time

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
anyone talks about that game I hear Amy Grant.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Baby baby.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
No no no because she

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
when she was like heavy heavy into

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
her Christian singing mode she did a song called

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
El Shaddai.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Keep in mind I was raised Baptist.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Ok here's the thing. The references

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
on this show are getting more and more obscure.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Ok well the full title

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
was El Shaddai the Ascension of the Metatron

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
so it's you know. Did she do a song

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
called Metatron? No

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
but I just finished watching the season

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Supernatural and there's Metatron in it.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Lordy.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
So let's

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
see. Metatron.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Yeah.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
And sorry

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Brad I adore you to death.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
It was a decent song but her Hebrew

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
was awful.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Alright moving on. I'm

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
shocked that so many people know that

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Amy Grant song. I only remember

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
baby baby

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
something something lyrics.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
There's one song that she did that I really

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
like and that was the duet she did with Vince Gill

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
who she married. Just saying.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
What ever happened to her? She's still

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
recording and still married to Vince Gill.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
She's still recording?

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Yeah I actually

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
believe it or not the only

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
side I could get working was Wikipedia.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
And

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
I

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
was reading up about

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
actually Vince Gill but it linked to

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Amy Grant so I was like.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Isn't that amazing how on Wikipedia

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
you could just. She married him.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
She's married to Vince Gill. I believe you.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Mom was watching that Oklahoma relief

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
thing and Vince Gill was on it so we looked at Vince Gill

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
and it led to Amy Grant.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
She's back to doing super

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Christian stuff.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
And singing with Vince.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Jamie

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Jamie.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Oh.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
Oh.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Oh.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
For the record she does have

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
a gorgeous voice.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
I remember

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
I got

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
I remember I got dragged

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
to this to an Amy Grant concert

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
at the

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
state fair. I got dragged

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
to one of those and it was just

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
not fun.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Did you sing along? No I didn't.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
I'm not a fan of Amy Grant.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
I like I recognize that song but I don't know any

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
of her other songs. Hey you know what

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
you know the only show that I

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
the only concert I've been taken to at a fair

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
against my will was Michael

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Damien. I think literally that is the

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
only concert I have seen at the

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
state fair is the Amy Grant one.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
And I don't remember who opened it. It was another

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
Christian artist. You haven't been to see where

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
now. No I said you haven't been to

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
see where now this year

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
I see where now it's a

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
hundred and some degrees outside. I don't

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
go outside for anybody. He can come to my house

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
Jamie

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
Jamie. I mean I went to

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Fresno to see where now.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
So all right.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Moving on back. Oh we were a video game show.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
I didn't realize

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
one thing you could pick up and you could sing baby

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
baby while you're downloading it in the queue is the

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Humble Indie Bundle 8. That's right

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
the Humble Indie Bundle 8 is here and

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
it has games such as Thomas was

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Alone, Awesomenauts, Little Inferno

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Dear Esther and Capsized

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
and if you pay more than the average purchase

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
price. I don't know what it is right at this moment. It's probably

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
like six or seven bucks. You will

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
also get Hotline Miami and

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Proteus. Now I'm just going to guess

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Did you say Proteus? No

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Proteus. Damn.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Not like I don't already have five copies

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
of Proteus. Now here's the thing. If this

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
goes anything like the former bundles did

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
somewhere in the last week they're going to say

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
by the way we're throwing in these Humble Bundle 7

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
games as well. So look out for it.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
I'm actually going to pay for this for one game.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
What game? Hotline Miami. Yeah

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
I hear it's really fun. Because it's blood

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
everywhere and you can shoot like Dobermans

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
in the face. I'm going to get this just because

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
I like indie games and I've pretty

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
much gotten every other indie bundle. I already got it.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Did you? Have you checked out any

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
of the games yet? No. They'll just sit there

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
in my Steam library. I have

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
now in my Steam library 126

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
games. And that's not all of them

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
because I haven't bothered to put all of the

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Sonic the Hedgehog games in.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
I only because I bought the Sonic collection with

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
every single Sonic the Hedgehog game that's on PC.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
And I only put in Sonic and

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Sega All-Stars Racing and Sonic Generations.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
I didn't bother to put the rest of the ones. Okay. Sonic

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Generations is a damn good game. They also

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
have well you saw I don't know if you saw they have a mod

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
that actually it's Sonic

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
it converts it to

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
the other Sonic 3D game

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
that they had. I don't remember.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
I see Tiger Claw in the chat room saying

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Hotline Miami has a good soundtrack

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
and the good news is you will also be

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
able to get the soundtracks with these games.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
DRM free downloads, Steam keys,

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Windows, Mac and Linux versions.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
For the record. For the record.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Whatever games that I don't

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
keep out of this I'm more than happy to share with

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
some of our listeners. And

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
and and

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
I should mention that they also

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
have a Humble Weekly Bundle

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
that's going on right now that's all the Telltale

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
series. Oh yeah I saw that too. Which I also

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
bought. That's a great deal.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Walking Dead, Sam & Max

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Walking Dead alone is worth it

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
if you don't already have it. Yeah if you pay more than average

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
it's Walking Dead. You get Sam & Max

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Also great. You know Back to the

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Future. Great.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Puzzle Agent which I've never played

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Waltzing Gromit.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Poker Night the Inventory

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
and

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Jurassic Park?

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
No Jurassic Park.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Probably because of licensing.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Anyhow, apparently

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
earlier this week Eve Online and Dust

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
514 which is the game that ties into it

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
they were taken down. CCP actually

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
took them down due to a significant and

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
sustained DDoS attack.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
That's a Distributed Denial of Service attack.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
That was according to Eve Online's

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Facebook. Don't know who

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
tried to do it or why but

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
yeah the whole game went down so look

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
at stupid kids ruining everybody's

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
fun. Stop DDoSing

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
MMOs and kicking everybody

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
off. This is trying to have a good time. By the way

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
speaking of DDoS attacks, Bobby asked me to

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
relay the following along.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Should we lose the stream at some point

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
during the show tonight? Don't hit F5

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
to refresh the entire page because when you all

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
do it at once it's like a little mini DDoS

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
attack because we're not on the servers

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
as big as Eve Online or Dust 514.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
We're running off a tin can

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
that has some computer chips

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
in it because that's what we paid for you know because

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
we don't have a lot of money at VoG. So when you all

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
refresh it at once it's like a little DDoS attack

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
that could cause everything to break further. So please

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
all you have to do, it's right by

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
the little player, you just hit pause,

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
unpause, pause, unpause.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
There you go. And that will not

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
do a DDoS attack on our little

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
website.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
If you are a

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Vita owner you'll be excited to know that

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Flower is coming to the Vita.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
This is awesome. I love Flower.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
I played it on the Playstation 3 but I would

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
say it's the best racing game

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
I've played in a long time even though

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
you would not think of Flower as a racing

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
game. It's really great.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Flower is going to be on the Vita. It will be one

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
of the Indiecade games coming

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
to E3.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
It was one of the few games that used that tilt

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
control inside the Dualshot controller.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
It will obviously use that

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
on the Vita because it has a touch screen

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
and all that fun stuff.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Cool. Check that out

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
on the Vita.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Next up, Dark Sakura.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Hold on, I'm saying that I only care about R-Type.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
What, in the

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
chat room? Talking about Irem games.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Oh, okay, I'm sorry. Because R-Type is freaking

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
great. Okay, tell me that R-Type

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
does not have the best first stage music

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
of almost any game ever.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
If you said it doesn't then you're lying.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
So,

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
you don't know Jack

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
is going to be on Ouya

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
on June 11th and

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
the Jackpad app

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
will make your phone a controller.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
So, folks who have

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Ouya's and an

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Android phone or an

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
iOS will get to have a

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
controller out of their phone.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
Yay.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Aren't you special.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Square Enix registered

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Final Fantasy Agito.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Which is something that we heard at E3

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
what, five years ago? Six years ago?

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Eventually.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
Because they were supposed to do

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Final Fantasy Agito 13.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
So, now they've got

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Final Fantasy Agito.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Hooray. There you go. Perfect question for Bobby

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Blackwell. So, where's versus 13?

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Oh, a question for the screen.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Well, here's the thing

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
is that either that's going to be

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
answered once E3 starts.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
I kind of think it's a game that has to

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
show up in one way or another. Whether it's true

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
that they moved it to 15 or what.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
I kind of think you'll have something on that well

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
before the show starts. But, let's say

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
they do announce Final Fantasy

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
versus 13 and you want to know

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
is lightning in it? You know, or something

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
that they don't say. I don't know. You could go

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
ask that question. Well, remember the

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
Agito 13 turned into

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
the zero one.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
I do. I'm happy it's

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
hopefully. Which I wish we would have gotten a

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
release over here because everyone tells me it's

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
sick as anything. Well, maybe this is

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
a sign. I hope.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
And then last but never least

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
for fans of the game Tookitori 2

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
which is on Wii U

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
it's getting a Steam release date. It's going to be

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
out today.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
Already. July 2nd.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
As announced by

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
developer Two Tribes.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
And in the PC version is a Steam

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
workshop integration and achievements.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
So, there's also

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
a level editor that was

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
promised for Wii U and

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
well, they don't have that yet.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Wii! Nintendo and online?

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
It's coming soon, trademark

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
patent pending. You know what else

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
is coming soon? Hey, you know what though

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
at this point? If the Xbox

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
One connect is going to watch me poop

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
then like give me the Wii U

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
and it's outdated technology

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
alright?

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
You know what? I'm just

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
going to go home and hook up the turbo duo

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
and play me some freaking Dracula X

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
and not worry about my system

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
watching me in my pajamas.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
The end.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
Instead of ceiling cat

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
is watching you masturbate. It'll be Xbox One

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
Bill Gates is watching you masturbate.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Alright, let's go to the FUGO question

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
of the week. Which thank heavens

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
tonight is not about masturbation.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Where's my theme music?

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Everything is broken tonight. I ate it.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Who ate my theme music?

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
The uh

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
connected while it was watching you poop.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
No, seriously guys

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
I don't have my theme music. Help me feel time.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Doo doo doo doo doo

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
No, not by singing.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
You don't want to hear me sing anyway.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
I want that game

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Ikuma. Tell, tell, go

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
to Square Enix and tell them to give it to me.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Tell them to give me the

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
zero. I wants it.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Can't you just import it?

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
So what exactly is the downside for

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
I don't think I can read it.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Not voting on Steam Greenlight

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
titles. I never understood that. Like

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
You don't get your little mini

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
achievement. Well it's like if you

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
don't vote for them then

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
you know, so what? So you

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
thumbs up them and then you don't buy it.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
They're not holding you to the fire to like

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
oh well you said you'd purchase this game

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
why aren't you purchasing this game?

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
And I actually want to wonder if

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
the chat room actually missed what I said that

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
Agito 13 was zero.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Because that's what I said right? Yeah, yeah.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Okay. Making sure people are paying attention.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Alright. Anyhow I would love to

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
answer Loki's question but

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
I found music.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Take Facebook and Google

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
and smash them together you get FUGL.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
And our way to interact with our fan communities

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
every week with the FUGL question of

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
the week. Now we didn't talk about

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
this story earlier in the show so I'll mention it now.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
A little known side quest in

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Final Fantasy 9 came to light via

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
an uploaded YouTube. Apparently some guide

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
in Japan that had been out for years but was

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
always untranslated. Somebody found

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
it and found that there was this extra quest in the game.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Well anyhow, although

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
I'm not going to get into all the details on Final Fantasy 9

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
because it sounds complicated.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
This had us thinking about rediscovering things

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
in classic games. Have you ever

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
revisited an old game years after

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
its release to find something new?

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Go back and complete it at 100%?

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
What classic game did you revisit after

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
many years? Not necessarily to play it

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
for the first time but to try and discover

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
new things inside it.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
So let's check out what some of our

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
folks on Facebook thought.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
We'll start with Jeremy Jay who answered

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
I discovered a trick in Super Metroid

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
five or six years after playing

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
it for the first time. You can call

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
the Dragon boss with your

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
grappling beam.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Pretty neat stuff. I guess it's common knowledge

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
to many but I had no idea.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
And he linked us a little to YouTube. You know there's

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
a lot of ways you can kind of trick that

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
game. You can do like wall jumps and

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
get past places you're not supposed to. There's lots

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
of little ways you can kind of like trick it and beat

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
the system so that's one of the really cool

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
that's what makes part of what makes

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Super Metroid the best

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
ever. No that's

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
where you could get to the top of the castle by

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
doing the double jump and get your final star

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
in Super Mario 64

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
just saying. Alright

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
anyway Tiara responds

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
and says I've actually been

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
replaying Final Fantasy 9 for the past several

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
weeks and I never knew about this side quest until

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
I stumbled upon the info while

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
looking for Chocobo hot and cold treasure

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
locations. So you're

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
going to be one of the first to see it.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
DarkTetsuya says up until a couple

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
sorry for the Facebook noise but I'm actually on

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Facebook trying to read these answers.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
DarkTetsuya says up until a couple years ago

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
I'd never beaten the fabled second quest

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
in The Legend of Zelda on NES. Trust

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
me when I say it is harder than the first

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
quest. Really? That is true.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
Well a lot of people go back

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
and beat retro games. Well

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
and for the record for anyone who wants to do

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
it without beating

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
the game first just type in Zelda for your name.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
That is true. Also Zelda is another one of those

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
games where you don't have to have every item. You

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
can get around some of this stuff. Like you could

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
get through the whole game with a wooden sword I think.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Don't forget to walk head first into

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
walls because you never know which one is invisible.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
You never know. Alright

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
let's see.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
Andy R. replied and said I replayed Okami

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
earlier this year thanks to the HD-ification

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
version and I found a lot of things

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
I didn't find the first time. Things such as

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
the hidden spider bosses or some of the advanced

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
forms of the brush techniques. Also

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
knowing what happens in the story before I

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
started made me more cognizant of the foreshadowing

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
I missed the first time I played the game

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
which was kind of cool.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Mary B. replied

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
with another Final Fantasy answer. Final Fantasy 8

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
learned how to crazy attack with

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Squall's 2 hour or whatever it was

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
and that it was stronger than his summit. Did they

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
have 2 hour abilities in Final Fantasy 8 or was that

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
your Final Fantasy 11 addiction talking

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
after getting stuck on Bahamut.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
I had to come back to a save down at Bahamut

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
after not playing for months. Final Fantasy

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
X and X-2 just for fun because I liked

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
them so much. Use strategy guide to get 100%

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
though.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Ragenator said well at least prior to my PS3

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
being stolen I regularly went back and played

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
older classics. The closest thing to

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
discovering something new was in terms

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
of tactics for situations where I got stuck

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
in the past. And Degenerate Johnny

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
says a couple years ago I decided to hook up my

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Genesis to test and see if it still worked after

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
all this time. It did surprisingly.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
I did

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
excuse me. I decided to fulfill

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
my nostalgic urge to play the original Mortal

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
Kombat. Unfortunately I forgot

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
the blood code. There are some things you

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
just forget as a gamer. I couldn't tell you

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
that I could remember it. Game facts.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
I knew fatalities not sure

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
all were possible without the blood code

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
so I tried it out with Kano.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
To my surprise Kano managed to do his finishing move.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
However instead of a heart he pulled

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
out an organ that was dark colored. I

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
can only assume that he pulled out his opponent's

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
liver.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
It's an evil thing. It must be destroyed. Even with

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
no blood code Mortal Kombat surprised me

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
with the amount of gore it was still able to show

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
on the consoles.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
Alright going over to Google Plus

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
and some of the answers

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
there.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
Are there no answers on Google Plus? Oh no there's

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
two. Sorry. Google Plus changed

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
and now I can't find things. Alright. Redertainment

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
says I remember me and my best friend as a

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
kid trying and failing to beat Mega Man

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
2 on the NES. No matter how many

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
different times or many different ways we tried to beat

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
the game we could never get past one particular

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
part in Dr. Wily's fortress at the end.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
It wasn't until I was older

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
bought the Mega Man collection on PS2

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
and had access to online walkthroughs that I

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
finally got the item you needed in order

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
to proceed past that one particular part.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
When I finally beat that game it felt like

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
I was giving my 8 year old self a figurative

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
high five. Not a literal high five

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
because that would break the space time continuum.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
And lastly Travis H

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
on Google Plus says I have found myself

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
overjoyed with the amount of PS1 and PSP

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
games I can replay on my Vita.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
I'm right now in the middle of playing Wild Arms

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
trying to complete it to its fullest

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
and find things that I missed the first time

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
around. It is very refreshing to go back

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
at an older age and enjoy the simple things

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
as the dialogue and some humor

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
you may not have got when you were younger.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Talk about a good soundtrack by the way.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Will anything

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
work during tonight's show?

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Now Alan is breaking things in the kitchen.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
I thought it was because I mentioned Wild Arms because that game

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
is hot.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
Oh my gosh. Alright. There you go.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Thank you to the folks that

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
answered the Facebook question of the week and the Google Plus

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
question of the week. Answer

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
in a future week. I want to say quickly though

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
about that last answer was very similar to one of the

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
Facebook answers and a couple things we were hearing

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
is that these HD remakes

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
really seem to get people to go back and play them

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
again. And I kind of find that to

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
be true too. Is that when the things get

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
re-released it's like a reason for me to go back.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Like it's why I had never tried

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
to beat Mario 2 with just one character before.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
So that was something I kind of did that was new this week.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Try doing it with Toad.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
The desert levels would be

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
manageable. I actually only used

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Toad in the desert levels for the most part but I did

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
now this was keep in mind when I was a

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
kid I did a full playthrough with Toad.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
And you would be surprised

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
at the number of coins you get.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
I was playing the stupid bonus game for ages.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Because he had

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
a faster dig.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
SSG100 Matt to the rescue in the chat room.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
A, B, A, C, A, B, B.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
That was the blood code.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
There you go Degenerajani. A, B, A, C, A, B, B.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Abacab.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
Alright.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
That does it.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Let's go into some more news.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
And then of course the mailbag and the FUs of the week.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Loki!

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Alright, so hey guess what?

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
Even though they haven't released their first

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
game yet, the next

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
Kickstarter for Double Fine

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
has been launched.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
It's a brand new game called

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Massive Chalice and it's

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
kind of a cross between like

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
a feudal fantasy

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
tactical strategy game

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
with like this weird

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
I guess

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
they're saying there's like permanent death in the game

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
so you have to create new

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
characters by breeding them I guess.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
So um

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
yeah.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
That's going to be coming I guess.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
And it looks interesting.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
They're most likely going to hit their goals since

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
they're at 677,500

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
right now and

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
their goal is 725,000

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
and they've got 24 days to go.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
So most likely they are going to

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
make it.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
So yeah.

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
I don't know.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Looks interesting.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
It's being headed up I guess by the guy that did

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Iron Brigade.

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Bradner.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Speaking of Kickstarter stuff by the way

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
the Zelda Kickstarter we had

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
that guy on the show a couple weeks ago didn't make it.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Didn't make it. Bummer.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
He says he has some other plans though

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
and good luck to him with Plan B.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
I think you got to have a Plan B when you go

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
into this Kickstarter thing because I think

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
it's like going

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
viral you know.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
And like these ad agencies will

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
hire people saying we need you to make a viral

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
ad but sometimes it just

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
either it's going to catch or it's

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
not and it's not that it's necessarily bad

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
it just sometimes it happens and sometimes

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
it doesn't. Now when you're double fine

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
and you have that name recognition well this

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
you know the money is going to come to him pretty easy

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
but you know unfortunately

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
for the Zelda movie

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
and all that it just didn't catch on

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
for whatever reason and that's going to happen sometimes

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
so good luck

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
to him with whatever he decides

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
to do with his Plan B.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
That makes me quite sad.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
Yeah it's unfortunate. Very unfortunate. I had put in some money

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
but I got it back

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
or I should say they never charged it because that's what happens

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
they don't charge it until it goes through.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Alright.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Going to some news for the 3DS

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
the 3D Sonic that I

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
remember we talked about was rumored

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
a couple weeks ago. Apparently it is something

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
that's happening because the Australian Classification

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
Board issued ratings.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
You got to love when the ratings board spoils games.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Well not only did they roll out a

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
3D Sonic the Hedgehog rating but they

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
also rolled out a 3D Altered

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
Beast rating.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Apparently 3D Space Harrier

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
3D Super Hang-On

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
these are all out in Japan already

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
but the fact that they're rated in Australia means

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
they're probably coming around to the rest of the world too.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
Which by the way if I am right

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
and they're the same as the Sega Ages

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
what was it

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
I imported like 3 of them. I had the Fantasy

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
Star, the Fantasy

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
Zone and Space Harrier. They're really good.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
If it's in the same line.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
Well these will be 3D.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
I'm all about Space Harrier

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
3D Super Hang-On yeah Sonic yeah Altered Beast

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
look Altered Beast is one of those games

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
that everybody

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
remembers that and like in people's memories

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
it's awesome but like I played through the game

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
not that long ago. It sucks.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
Like Altered Beast sucks. I'm sorry

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
to say it. It is not aged well

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
whatsoever. When I was 12

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
that game was the shit. When I'm 34

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
not so much. We needed a Marble

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
Madness. We do need a Marble Madness.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
That wasn't Sega. I don't care though.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
It would be awesome. Wasn't it Williams

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
or Midway?

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
It was Atari. Yeah Atari.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Which their arcade division got

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
snapped up by Midway I believe. I think that's what

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
I'm thinking of. Which in turn

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
got snapped up by Warner.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
The game's great if you've got a track ball to play it with.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Well I could

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
do something with the touch pad

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
who knows. Alright

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Dark Sakura what do you have for us?

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
Well as soon as I can get it up. There we go.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
developer. We like them don't

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
we because they gave us that wonderful

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
series back didn't they?

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
It's Black Forest Games. They've announced

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
another game called Ravensdale

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
that's a four player co-op

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
side scrolling platform shooter

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
set in a medieval oil rig city.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Looking

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
at the screen capture here it's

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
pretty grimy. Very

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
oily looking.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
They wanted it to be an

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
action RPG

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
but publishers were saying that Steampunk

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
doesn't sell so that's why

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
they are

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
it looks like they've changed

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
the method of this. I don't know has anyone else

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
heard anything about this?

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
No not this particular

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
game. No.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
Well their likelihood saying that we're

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
going to see a kickstarter in

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
about a month or two. Since they're

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
not finding a publisher they're going to go

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
the Giana Sisters route. But I mean

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
if judging by Giana Sisters it's probably

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
going to be good. So

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
they got a good track record.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
Yes yes I still need to play that

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
Twisted Dreams. It's one of those games that's like in my queue

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
waiting to play but I loved the

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
Commodore 64 one even though yes it was

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
kind of the Mario Brothers rip off but

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
soundtrack is part of what I remember most

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
fondly but. It's pretty good. I

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
have it downloaded but I played

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
it like once and then I

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
went back to Saints Row the Third.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
I did not like Saints Row the Third.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
What's wrong with you?

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
I just

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
didn't like how the game started off.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
It's so funny. I laughed and

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
laughed. Did you get to the part where they're skydiving out of the plane?

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
You got to at least get that far

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
because I died. It was so funny.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
I just found I didn't like the

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
control that's all.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
Alright I didn't like Mass Effect the first time I

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
played it just saying. Alright

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
Loki what do you have for us?

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
So there's some more announcements coming from

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
Japan for the Wii U.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
First off the Wii U is now going to be

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
available in white for the 32 gigabyte

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
premium set. That's starting

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
July 13th and

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
I guess it will be available in black and white

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
since they already have the black to begin with.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
And then of course they're going to be

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
I guess

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
doing some sort of

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
and I'm surprised it's taken so god damn

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
long for this but they're doing

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
well first they have a larger

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
capacity battery for the

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
Wii U gamepad so it's going to

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
be 2500 maw

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
instead of 1500 maw

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
which will I guess equal to

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
5-8 hours of

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
you know gameplay as opposed

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
to 3-5 and then on top of that

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
they're having official

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Wii remote

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
charge

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
battery packs for it.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
Like woah

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
how many years after the Wii

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
and they finally got around to

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
putting out battery packs for it because

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
hey those Wii remotes

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
eat batteries like you know

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
I thought this was a Wii U battery pack.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
No they have a Wii U battery pack and they also

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
have battery packs for the Wii.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
I didn't realize that was a separate thing. It's crazy.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
They're doing that and they even have like a little

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
charger that goes along with it. Now

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
it's a little late to the game considering

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
that Nyko and you know I think

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
Dream Gear have had battery packs for the

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
longest time for

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
it but it's interesting to see

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
something official from them

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
and yeah

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
so those will be coming soon

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
because they're only in Japan right now.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
Until they announce something at E3

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
this week where these are coming

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
with a price drop.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
Maybe, maybe, I don't know

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
might be thinking

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
too positively.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
We'll see.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
This game looks very cool.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
I'm going to play some of the YouTube here in the

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
background so you can hear some of the music

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
but it's a game called

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
Crypt of the Necrodancer.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
It is a roguelike

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
game which is you know like a

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
dungeon crawler like if you think way, way, way back

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
to the old terminal

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
game Rogue but it's mixed with a

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
music game.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
It's a hardcore rhythm based

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
roguelike.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Notable game composers Danny B

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
and Alec Holowaka

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
or excuse me Holowka are

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
working with Crypt of the Necrodancer

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
which I think is awesome and you can also load

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
your own MP3s into the game if you want although

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
I don't know how well that will work but there you go.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
That looks

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
awesome and you can check that out at

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Necrodancer.com

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Very cool.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
I like both those types of games

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
that's like a game made for Rob.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
Dungeon Crawler meets DDR

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
love it.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
I just need my dance pad. Alright

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
let's get to our mailbag

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
every week you guys send us emails

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
and Dark Soccer reads some of her favorites here on

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
the show. In fact she's got a couple

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
weeks to catch up on with no

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
official show last week and so forth

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
so uh

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
unfortunately she was trying to sell. No one of my

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
stitches came out it actually broke when

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
I flipped the foot inside out so

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
I was trying to fix it real quick. I thought I had time

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
before mailbag. Oh well.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
So a freaking ton of mail

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
and a lot of it's

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
in Mandarin Chinese so let's

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
skip all those. That was the spam.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
That was the spam. Except for the stuff

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
in French which I could actually read but I don't really

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
care about beeps that much. Spam-der-in.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
Womp womp.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
So this

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
comes from Ra-ba-ba-ba-ba.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
I noticed

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
the Curiosity game from 22Cans

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
is approaching the center. Well there's

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
a countdown on each cube and I believe it was

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
at 13 when I wrote this on Monday. I made

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
my final cynical conclusions about it. Of course

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
we've already done a big reveal. But I like

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
reading this stuff.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
It appears the cubes do not get smaller

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
as you get closer to the center. It isn't

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
fun not even as bubble wrap. It gets boring

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
easily and after I toyed with it once or twice

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
I'm content to just see it end.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
The payoff at the end will be disappointing.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
The life changing promise is way too

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
large a nebulous. I love the word nebulous

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
by the way. I hope the center is

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
remember to drink your Ovaltine.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
Stay pound zero zero zero zero

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
zero zero Ra-ba-ba. Of course

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
you know what that is.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
Stay black.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
You've been listening. Okay.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
No you haven't. We have another one from Ra-ba-ba-ba.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
You guys asked for

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
our reaction to the Xbox One so here's mine.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
First when listening to the May 19th episode

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
I read up on the Xbox One so the podcast

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
was full of unintentional dramatic irony.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
It was fun to hear

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
after the reveal. That said my original

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
reaction on the name is that it

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
was literally the last name I'd consider for the new

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Xbox. Then I realized simply

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
Xbox was literally the last name

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
I expected so they chose the pen's

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
ultimate name of all I could come up

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
with. Overall the name is

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
pretty good as it conveys multiple

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
meanings, is easy to remember and understandable

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
unlike Wii and Wii U which sound dumb even

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
repulsive. The conveyed no

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
obvious meaning

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
I don't expect a lot of debate

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
over what a terrible name one is.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Does it have good games?

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
At this point I don't really care.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
All I know is that there aren't many

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
good games coming out for any system at the moment.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
They'll stop making games for

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
PS4 and Xbox

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
360 very soon and the new

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
consoles will be my only choice for new

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
games on console. Used games

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
if I can't trade or give used

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
games away I will probably not buy discs at all.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
I also believe this is how

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
EA will implement Game Pass.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
The game DVR is interesting.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
It requires online to share so I suspect

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
this will be an exclusive gold

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
feature. I also

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
expect that certain games will not be allowed on this

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
feature, even gasp not allow

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
certain parts to be recorded. That's all

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
I'll bug you with today.

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
This

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
comes from Elliot B.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
It's the

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
Oculus Rift report.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Dear OLR, this week I was

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
lucky enough to get some hands on time with the most exciting

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
hardware release of the year.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
No, not the PS4 or Xbox One. I'm of course talking

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
about the Oculus Rift.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
For those who don't know, the Rift is a VR headset with

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
low latency head tracking providing an

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
immersive 3D experience, in theory at least.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
While the reality doesn't

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
quite yet live up to the hype, it's still an

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
impressive device, even for a prototype.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
Oculus have got the basics

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
down pat.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
The headset is easy to set up, weighs nothing

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
and lag is unnoticeable.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
Unfortunately there is still a pretty major issue

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
standing between the Rift and the mainstream

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
success. Movement with standard

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
FPS controls produce instant

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
motion sickness. Even the peaceful

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
Italian Villa demo is

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
nauseating, let alone a fast paced shooter.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
DarkSucker, you have been warned. Thank you.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
My thinking is that

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
rather than adapting existing games for the

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
Rift, devs will need to keep in mind its weaknesses

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
as well as strengths.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Still experiencing the Rift for the first

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
time is a breathtaking experience, even

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
despite its teething problems.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
To be any more than a novelty,

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
it now needs some equally breathtaking

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
custom built games. Yours virtually,

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
Elliot B.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
Thank you Elliot. Good lord everybody, why are you

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
writing me novels?

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
Dear OLR, I would like to take this moment

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
to thank Microsoft from the bottom of my heart

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
for the Xbox One announcement. The amount of money

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
I'll be saving by skipping their draconian

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
unattractive Kinect mandatory disaster

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
is enormous. You know

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
it's funny I was worried about skipping this generation

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
because I was afraid the PS4 was going to blow

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
major chunks. How I even bought

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
a Wii U out of that fear.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
Instead it seems Microsoft is going

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
into the junior year slump that seems

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
to happen with any successful console

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
manufacturer. Seriously,

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
first it was Nintendo with the

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
64, then Sony with the PS3.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
Now Microsoft with the Xbox One, by the way

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
lamest name ever. We're getting

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
quite a bit of

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
mixed

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
The PS3 though, it

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
started off like a great comedy

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
of errors, but after a couple years it got

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
better and better. It grew into itself. It did.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
It fits its big boy pants.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Nintendo 64 had its moments.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
You know, I wouldn't call Nintendo 64

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
a flop. Pokemon Snap.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
Among

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
well, Mario 64, some in

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
Ocarina of Time, some considered to be the greatest games

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
ever made, so it had that too.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
Well, and

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
even Treasure did a couple of games

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
for it, and we know what we think of Treasure.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
Okay.

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
This isn't to say

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
I'll be completely sitting out on gaming

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
hardware this generation. Obviously I have

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
my Wii U, and actually already

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
have a bunch of games for it, and I'll be picking up the

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
Retron 5 and Ouya when they're commercially available.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
Also, since Sony doesn't appear

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
to be restricting news games or mandating

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
internet connections, the PS4 seems to be

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
a viable option, unless something

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
disastrous turns up at E3.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
Honestly, if Sony isn't looking

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
at the Xbox One and saying, this is

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
what we don't do, I'll be surprised.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
However, I can say with absolute certainty

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
that I've got more than

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
enough ga- you know, that was the first typo I found.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
You said then

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
and so then?

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
No, I was just thinking I was impressed, so

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
good on you.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
More than enough gaming ready to go

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
for the next five or so years, and that

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
doesn't include GOG or humble

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
bundles. However,

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
almost as troubling as the DRM encumbrance

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
on the Xbox One is

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Microsoft's continued commitment

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
of trying to pimp the Xbox to people

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
who don't give a crap about video games.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Does Microsoft not understand

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
that there are cheaper alternatives for those who want

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
set-top boxes? Seriously,

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
media centers like Boxee and Apple TV

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
are $80 to $100,

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
and modern Blu-ray players are having

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
more and more of those features put into them

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
for about the same price or less.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
That's ignoring the obvious

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
plug a cheap PC into your television

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
through HDMI option. I

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
shit you guys not, I can do the whole

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
Netflix, YouTube, multimedia thing on my

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
Blu-ray player, my PS3, my Nexus

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
7 tablet, and my PC, and

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
most of those options are also on my Wii U.

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
Microsoft goes full bore with the

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
living room takeover thing at

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
their own peril while I hesitate to wish

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
them ill. I do hope they're awakened soon.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
Failing that, however,

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
I'm good to go. Emulators on Ouya,

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
retro goodness on the RetroN5,

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
and modern gaming on the Wii U, and potentially

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
a future on the PS4, and Japanese

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
developers will likely be able to go right

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
back to ignoring Microsoft, and all is right with the world.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Anyway, there's my thoughts

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
on the Xbox One. Have I mentioned it's a stupid

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
name? I have. Don't care.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
It's a stupid name. Seriously, it's worse than

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
Wii. Regards, we're all still UT.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
Thank you for the best written email

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
I have ever read in my entire life

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
except for your one type O.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
It's T-H-A-N,

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
not T-H-E-N, and also... That is

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
totally a lie. Well written. Shut up, Rob.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
No offense. Mr. KickStarter'd.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
No offense to the emailer.

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
No. Well, you know it's my job to

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
completely fuck up everyone's grammar.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
I think maybe it's a little bit overly

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
cynical, but I

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
will give until E3. Let's

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
see what happens.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
So, you know, and just like

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
Bobby said in the chatroom at live.vognetwork.com,

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Sony never

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
said they weren't doing any of that.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
They just never answered the question.

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
True dat. So,

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
we'll see. They're not gonna

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
be able to dodge it much longer. One foot.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
I have one scalemate foot.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
In your behind.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
Kick. In your angel butt.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
Okay, this comes from

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
Jay, who I was hanging out with, and just

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
let me hop back into the chat long enough to keep from getting

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
logged out. Sure. Okay.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
This email

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
comes from Jay, Jammer Jay,

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
who I was hanging out with on

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
last Monday. Oh, is it gossip all about your

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
experiences? No, it's not. It's pictures of

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
me being sunburned.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
This is

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
the highlight of my gaming week was

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
playing DDR with the legendary DarkSakura.

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
Yes, I know. Anyway.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
She did a fine job for getting back into

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
DDR. I think it's time for Sky and Loki to brush

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
off the rest and join her back into DDR.

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
I played

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
at Roseville Golf Land a couple months ago.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
I think when Spike and Tim

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
that showed that Spike and Tim were here. We've gone to

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
Golf Land earlier in the week. I have a pile of tokens

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
which they don't even use anymore.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
It's all like a card. Maybe you could

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
trade them in. I don't know. I mean, I don't think

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
they'll do that. Well, they had to

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
for a certain time. Okay.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
My summer advice for gamers. Be sure to have

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
light sunscreen if planning to be out in the sun

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
a bit. Oh, why? Yeah,

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
because

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
the thing is I'm not supposed to wear sunblock at all

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
because I have a

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
I don't make enough

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
vitamin D normally so I didn't wear any.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
And then I forgot what humidity

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
and sunlight really does and I'm

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
still peeling.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
Anyways, it was nice seeing you again, DarkSakura.

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
Thank you. It was good to see you too.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
And I look forward to meeting up with Sky and Loki for

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
California DDR one day. Well, we would love to

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
have you out here and you are more than welcome

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
to crash at my place.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
And

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
last email.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Hello all. Just thought I

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
would drop a line to say hello to the gang.

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
I am in the middle of reading an amazing

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
book called Ready Player One, which we've discussed

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
on the show by Ernest Cline.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
I know I'm a little late to the party

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
since the book has been out about two years now

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
but it's so good.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
So much gaming culture and influence as well

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
as a lot of great pop culture

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
references from the 80s and 90s.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
I have two questions. To anyone who has read it

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
what did you think? No spoilers.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
Which I think we've discussed in depth.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
I haven't read it yet. I'm going to be borrowing it from Becky I think.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Okay, good. I still haven't read it.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
I still need to read Catching

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
Fire y'all before the movie's

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
out. So I got a long

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
book queue. You don't need to watch them

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
or watch the book, read

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
the book to watch the movie. Yeah, but

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
like when I, see reading the book makes

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
the movie better because when I went to see

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
The Hunger Games, like every time they

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
change something from the book it was like

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
and then Alan would know that that was

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
something that changed in the book because he could hear me huffing.

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
So

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
the fact that you got pissed off that they

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
changed things in the book made it better? Yes, it made

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
it a more interactive experience.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
Who won The Hunger Games? I did.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
You know what?

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
It's kind of funny doing that with Battle Royale

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
now that I've read the book.

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
And seeing how the movie is just complete

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
blood fest and not really political.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
It's very different. The manga is great though.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
So anyway,

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
I'm only

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
halfway through and my second question

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
is to Loki. When you were doing that

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
challenge a while back, this was the book

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
you were doing it for, wasn't it?

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
Yes. Anyone who

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
hasn't read the book, stop what you were doing

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
after the OLR show of course and go pick it

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
up on Kindle or your local bookstore.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
You will not be disappointed. Keep up

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
the great work you three make my Monday at

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
office a lot less miserable. Your friend

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
Travis. Ah, you make our Sunday mail bag

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
a lot less miserable. It's our Travis H. You make our Sunday

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
mail bag a lot less miserable. Thank you

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
Travis. Thank you.

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
And you know there's pictures that

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
Jay sent but I think they're the same

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
ones that he put up on Facebook.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
And they're not wanting to look.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
Yeah, my butt playing DDR.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
Your butt on a DDR machine.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
LOL. See.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
I'm not showing any of you in the chat room

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
because no.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
Alright, well as long as you have fun. That's what DDR is about.

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
Because I'm the diva, that's why.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
Speaking of diva moments

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
it's time to get into that segment we do here

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
every week on the show where we get a little bit angry.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
All this is bad.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
Here is justice.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
Here is punishment.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
Here.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
This is fucked up.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
F you

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
to

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
smoking in

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
your house.

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
And making

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
all of my clothes

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
smell like smoke.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
And then on top of

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
okay this is me going into some family

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
shit. Okay.

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
My mom smokes in the house.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
Her husband smokes in the house.

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
While my grandmother has vasculitis.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
And I was reading about

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
just how badly second hand smoke

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
can aggravate vasculitis.

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
Can aggravate a lot.

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
Exactly. And then my mom's like

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
my mom has asthma and she's saying that my shampoo

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
is aggravating her asthma. No it was not.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
Your smoking is aggravating your damn asthma.

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
When I smoked

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
I would always go, which was a long time ago

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
but I would always go outside.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
Most smokers I knew would do that.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Especially in this state.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
Like it's illegal to smoke anywhere that's not outside.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
And most outdoor places are also banned

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
at this point in time.

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
They actually banned it in Daphne. I had the most

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
pleasant experience in a waffle house

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
that I've ever had in my life.

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
Because you couldn't smoke inside.

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
You could actually smell your food. It was amazing.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
Also I love you Daphne

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
Waffle House. Your peanut butter

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
waffles are so freaking

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
good. And even though you're kind of

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
racist assholes. Blue Bell Ice Cream.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
I love your ice cream too.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
Thank you for the banana pudding ice cream.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
And also FU2

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
Attention Horse. Three hour show

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
Jamie. Three hour show. I'm done. Alright.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
Loki. Fuck you to hot.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
Right? Because it's gonna get

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
hot. Alright. It was like

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
95 today or something

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
and next week it's 105. Fuck that.

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
Nope. I like the winter.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
Winter. It's cold. You put more layers on.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
You can only take off so many layers

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
in the summer. It's gonna rain.

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
No. It's gonna be hot.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
Alright. That's it?

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
My FU of the Week just goes to the whole

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
like when it rains it pours syndrome.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
I have a lot of good things going on right now.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
I can't really complain. Like there's nothing I'm doing

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
where I'm like argh I'm so angry about this.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
But it's just like. Did Robbie

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
bite off more than he could chew? I don't know.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
But it's actually one of those things where I'm like

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
ok. When I have some

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
days off next week. I have some time to

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
catch up on some things. Then I can

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
go have fun in LA.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
Even though I'll have to be driving down there by myself.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
But one of my friends is gonna be meeting me there

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
and that makes everything a lot better. And then I'm meeting

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
another one of my friends there. It makes it a lot better so.

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
But just lots of stuff going

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
on right now. So when it rains

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
it pours. Argh.

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
But it'll be good. It's like

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
one of those things. You're like really

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
upset about it. But then like when it's actually happening

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
you're like I have the best life.

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
Ok.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
Let's get to a couple more news stories for you guys.

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
And then Twitter topics at

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
at 1877 game olr

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
or our username on skype orange lounge radio.

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
Not just yet though. Couple more stories.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
Yes unfortunately we got some depressing stories.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
The first being that

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
unfortunately there was a tragic event that happened

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
this week. One of the

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
engineers for the oculus

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
oculus rift

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
Andrew Scott Reese was

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
killed in a

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
basically

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
a hit and run during a

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
police chase. He was

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
crossing the street in a crosswalk and got hit

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
by a car that the police were chasing.

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
And killed.

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
That's awful. That sucks. Especially

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
after we just had an email. Yeah after that email

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
and everything. It's crazy. I mean what's really

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
horrible about that is just like you know dude was crossing

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
the street. And

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
Didn't it happen to

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
Gumpay. Fuck I can't remember his name.

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
He did Metroid. I think he

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
died in a car accident.

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
I thought he was getting out of a car and got hit.

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
Yeah yeah yeah that sounds familiar.

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
It's on Wikipedia somewhere.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
But yeah it was really sad.

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
And it's just you know obviously people

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
car accidents happen every day and we lose

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
great people. And pedestrians get hit every day

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
unfortunately and we lose great people.

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
It just really sucks that

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
A this was such a great you know young mind

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
that was inventing these things that everybody wanted

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
to play. And B

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
preventable. This guy

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
this guy was not at fault. He wasn't

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
like he wasn't crossing the street in a drug induced

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
stupor or something. You know

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
he was hit by a guy who was running from the

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
police. Totally preventable.

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
Like it's awful.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
It's awful.

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
But what can

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
you do. When it's

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
time to go. You're gonna go.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
You know.

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
But at the same time

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
it's important not

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
to. Well

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
yeah you can't live in here.

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
I'm just saying

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
it's important to remember the basics

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
that you learned in elementary school.

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
You got to look both ways before you cross the street.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
And because I'm sorry but

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
you know and not to say that he's at fault

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
because it's tragic but

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
if there's a police chase going

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
and there's cars with sirens coming

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
your way you can hear those sirens and

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
you know you

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
always want to look especially when I'm driving

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
and stuff even though there's a green light I'm always

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
looking you know you always I give it a couple

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
seconds before I go because there's always

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
someone that's not paying attention that's going to run the light.

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
So you got to be defensive and always kind of

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
keep your eye out even though it may be green or something.

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
I remember actually it was funny the last time I

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
went to E3 even

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
a bus ran out of control

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
and smashed into a Walgreens

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
right through the crosswalk because

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
it turned too fast or something like that.

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
And you know

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
someone could have gotten hurt.

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
Thankfully there was someone that was in the way

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
but they managed to get into the

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
Walgreens before the bus

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
hit but you just have to be careful.

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
Alright so here's the deal

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
with Gunpei Yokoi and if you don't know

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
that name he's the guy who produced he worked for

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
Nintendo for a long time producer of

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
Kid Icarus and Metroid which is huge

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
right there designed Rob the robot

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
designed the Game Boy

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
so you all know that one. Yes he designed the Virtual

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
Boy 2 for which you know there was a lot

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
of shame that came with that and he left Nintendo

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
but they say that he had always

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
planned to leave Nintendo at a certain age

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
Virtual Boy was not the reason for that.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
Well unfortunately in 1997

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
he was in a fender

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
bender accident where he rear

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
ended a truck he got out of the car

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
to inspect the damage because you know the same thing happens

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
here right you take the pictures send the insurance company all that

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
stuff right and the passing car said

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
Yeah I remembered

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
it was something like that. Similar-ish

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
yeah it's very tragic.

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
Yeah and Yokoi I

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
knew it was a Yoke but I didn't remember

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
Yeah

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
Alright well

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
I hope I really really hope

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
this story doesn't have a sad ending but

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
you know somebody in

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
the gaming community is missing right now

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
and his name I'm hoping

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
if the internet is doing its job correctly

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
then you all already know this and I'm telling you something

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
obvious but in case you don't know

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
David Dredger is currently missing

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
and he goes by Knuckles Dawson online

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
he went missing

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
over last weekend

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
so unfortunately it's been about a week now

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
and he was missing in the Vancouver area

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
his bike and helmet were

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
found in Stanley Park

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
but before he left he closed his Twitter account

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
his Xbox Live account

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
reportedly he left his wallet, computer

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
and phone at home

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
and there's really just

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
not a lot of information unfortunately

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
they have been assembling groups in Vancouver

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
to try and find him

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
unfortunately no luck yet

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
I think they were going to search the

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
waters area next

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
I mean don't know he could have

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
leave the country somehow

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
essentially and who knows

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
where he could have gone

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
hopefully he is safe and sound

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
somewhere

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
for whatever reason

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
just got away

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
but I highly doubt

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
he would be listening to this podcast

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
but if by some strange

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
string of luck he was

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000
a lot of folks miss you dude

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
please

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
call your family

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
a lot of people are out looking for this guy

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
and they really miss him

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
so if you are in the Vancouver area

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
even I would say honestly

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
if you are in the Pacific Northwest

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
honestly he could be anywhere at this point

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
it's not that hard to get on a plane

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
go somewhere else

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
or get in a car and go somewhere

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
he could be in the US who knows

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
findknuckles.com is the place to go

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
findknuckles.com

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
this guy by the way you might have seen

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
his work in the gaming community before

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
he was pretty well known because he got

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
the one achievement a day on the 360

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
for like he did something like 3 years

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
so he was really big in the Xbox achievements community

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
and I know I heard his name before

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
he was working with other indie podcasts

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
I know he did stuff with Rooster Teeth

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
so

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
I hope they find him

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
and I hope all is well

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
ok that was two

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
really horrible stories back to back

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
I'm sorry we have to end on that note

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
but we want to do our due diligence

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
I could find some puppies and kittens

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
we need like a kitten playing video

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
play the baby monkey writing backwards on a pig

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
song

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
ok hold on

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
it's literally called baby monkey writing backwards on a pig

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
this will make us feel a little better

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
that will make us feel better

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
yes it will

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
baby monkey

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
baby monkey

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
we use this song and sing to Midna

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000
we make up our own lyrics about Midna

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
baby monkey

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
baby monkey

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
I do feel a little better

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
backwards on a pig

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000

while we're working on that?

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
there's a kickstarter for some sort of

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000
vest

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
haptic device or something

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
that they're trying to get off the ground

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
it's supposed to be the as close as it gets

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
kickstarter and it's

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
like this thing that's supposed to tie in with first person shooters

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
and stuff like that to make it more immersive

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000
where you actually feel like the

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
you know bullets are hitting you

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
and stuff it's weird though they had

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
that's a little creepy just saying

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
they had something like that before it had like a

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
bass speaker almost built

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
into it I want to say I forgot what they

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
called it but it was

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
I think it was tied into

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
either your audio

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
or maybe like the

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
rumble on your controller

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
or something like that for like the playstation 2 and

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
xbox it's probably audio

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
if it's going to be tying in with that stuff but

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
they had that

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
yeah they're looking to get $900,000

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
to create that thing

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
alright let's go to the phones we're getting some calls

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
so let's go to it hi you're on orange tones radio who's this

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
hi this is raginator

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
hey raginator we see you

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
we're like a connect we're watching you

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
don't do anything dirty

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
no I'm just showing you

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
oh that

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
makes me feel better it's a kitty

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
put it back on the cat

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
I don't want to see you I want to see the cat

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
thank you much better

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
what's kitty's name

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
Anakin Rorschach

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
oh that's a good name alright

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
hopefully that will be better than the Anakin

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
that was in episodes 1 through 3 what's on your mind tonight

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
not a whole lot

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
just

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
kind of a generic

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
question for tonight

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
is there

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
any upcoming

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
games that have been announced

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
that you're possibly looking for

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
or forwards to

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
and not only that

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
but it's a secondary question

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
if you have

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
like a wish list

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
or something that you would love

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
to see on steam

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
like if it was

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
you see on steam right now

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
you want to throw down money

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
for that game and say buy it

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
like anything

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
or are you talking about ports from consoles

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
or something like that

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
either or whatever direction

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
you would like to take the question

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
well I would point you to the OLR dream

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
games page on the OLR wiki

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
because things like what they

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
play dot com snap those still have not

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000
come to fruition and I think we'd like to see

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
some of those but on a serious

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
note things that are on console

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
that I would like to see on steam

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
I think it would be nice if maybe some things

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
that are already out on PC would get

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
integrated into steam a little more like

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
you know I loves me some World of Warcraft

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
might be kind of fun to integrate that and I could

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
talk you know but Blizzard wants to do their

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
own thing with battle net so I understand why that doesn't

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
happen so

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
but as far as like console things

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
on steam I could be a total

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
fanboy and say like Mario which

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
also wouldn't happen but then again

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
on the keyboard it wouldn't be the same experience

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
so I don't know I'd have to

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
think about that one you guys anything that jumps

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
to your mind we'll come back to your other question though anything

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
that jumps to your mind something that isn't on steam that ought

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
to be

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
yeah there's so many things

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
that I can come up with

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
too many to list and especially in this

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
show well let me check in with

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
Dark Soccer and Loki I want SNES collections

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
SNES collections like Genesis

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
collections exactly why not no

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
even better TurboGrafx

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
I want the revamped Dracula

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
X alien crush HD

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
oh my god right that would be our dev

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
no I want to see the whole crush series

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
like up through Jackie crush okay

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
all right Loki Minecraft

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
you just want Minecraft in

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
steam make sense it'd be cool I run my

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
Minecraft through steam I guess

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
you can be done all right

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
let's let's get to the meteor question that rage nator

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
asks what are you personally looking forward to

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
this year if anything let me guess

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
Loki Saints Row 4 Grand Theft Auto 5

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
oh and oh

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
yeah come on yes both

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
is that it

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
and Earth Defense Force 2025

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
okay and the new Call of Duty

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
um for me the

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
Kingdom Hearts 1.5 remix is something

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
I'm definitely looking forward to Final Fantasy 14

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
Realm Reborn so I know I'm sounding like a

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
total Square Enix fanboy but it is

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
what it is Disney Infinity

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
although I'm totally expecting that game

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
to be a flop that whole collectible

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
figurine thing I have to admit

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
I'm like if I'm gonna get into a Skylanders

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
game it's gonna be this one you know

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
I'm cautiously optimistic I actually do have to tell

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
you something Julian does not have

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
any Skylanders games but he has toys

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
that he plays with

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
there are people that collect Disney

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
commemorative plates they will

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
buy this game people will buy this game

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
it's not gonna it's not gonna

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
matter it's not gonna flop uh I'm

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
still holding hope that Phantasy Star Online 2

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
will make it out this year at some point although

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
I'm losing hope but we'll see E3 is kinda the

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
make or break for that um

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000
I kinda wanna see the South Park

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
Stick of Truth game too

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
the toilet humor potty

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
humor guy in me wants to see that uh

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
Pokemon X and Y believe it or not I'm

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
loving what it looks like the revamp battle system

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
is gonna be or not system but the graphics

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
and everything and how they're making everything 3D

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
it looks it looks really cool I don't

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
usually get into the Pokemon games quite as much as

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
other people I know like Shane but

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
uh if there's gonna be one that's gonna win

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
me over it'll probably be X and Y

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
how about you Spazinator

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
what do you want this year what can't you wait for?

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
uh well stuff

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
that would probably run on my

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
uh uh KPS

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
computer probably

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
Magic 2014

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
of course

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
yeah well

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
that's probably one of the few upcoming

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
games that will run on my

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
computer for sure

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
some of the other stuff like

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
GTA 5 I know for games

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
sure it won't run on my computer

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
uh if I were to go replace

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
my consoles I may go get

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
that but

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
it's not really within my budget right now

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
but uh

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
the short answer is just the next

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
Magic the gallery so

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
fair enough you know what there's sometimes those reliable

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
series and we're always waiting for the next entry in them

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
some people only get Madden

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
every single year and if you know if

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
if the DDR game if we were like you know

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
10 years ago I would have said oh whatever new

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
DDR game is coming out this year that's what I'm looking forward to

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
but you know times have changed alright

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
uh Raginator I'm gonna let you go so we can get more calls

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000
but take care buddy okay?

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
yep you too take care bye

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000
oh and uh bye to Anakin as well if you hear that

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000
uh 1877 game OLR

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
uh we didn't get a lot

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
of twitter topics tonight but I will read this one

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
from Tigerclaw because this does look interesting

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
I didn't know about this uh that

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
Tigerclaw tweets us the Tetris creator

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
Alexey Pajitnov

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
I totally said that wrong I haven't heard that guy's

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
name in a long time but uh he created

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
Tetris and he came out with a new

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
mobile phone game this is where

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
everybody's going IOS it's a

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
IOS game called Marbly

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
it's the first title he's ever designed

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
exclusively for a mobile device

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
and that you play with colored balls

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
hence the name Marbly

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
what are they blue

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
okay someone had to go the five

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
year old ride why are you giggling over there when I mentioned

to me now

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
your chest is impressive

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
keep it on for the rest of this call please

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
you guys are cheating me I'll see you on video

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
I know well you've heard

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
how many times the stream has gone down tonight

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
we can't afford the upload who is

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
this for the listeners

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
this is Ospher hi Ospher how you doing

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
pretty good

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
you mentioned earlier about how you were really

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
getting into the Wii U Virtual Console

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
and earlier this week

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
I took advantage of that deal that

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
what is that like 32 cents

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
Super Metroid or whatever

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
if you live in a state that taxes those online

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
purchases yes 32 cents but

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
somehow in California we get away with

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
a measly 30 cents for Super Metroid

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
dang

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
holy crap I know I saved two

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
cents

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
I uh

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
I also went I got a

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
Mega Man X because

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
I don't know like a lot of people

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
seem to really be into the series I've never

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
played Mega Man X before but I've played like

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
you poor thing now's a

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
great time to catch up

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
yeah it seems pretty good

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
like I'm pretty bad at Mega Man

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
games in general too but like had a little fun

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
thing I like the dashing and stuff like that

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
well a lot of Mega Man games

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
are really freaking hard too

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
so it's you know you say I'm not that good

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
at Mega Man games nobody is

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
that good at Mega Man games but you learn

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
you learn you get better at them

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
yeah I was actually really mad earlier because I was

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
like fighting some mini boss

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
against I can't remember the robot

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
names like some electrical guy and

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
I couldn't even beat the freaking mini boss like I was

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
like getting so angry and then I

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
fight the actual boss I'm like wow that was the easiest thing

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
I've ever done

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
what did you think of Super Metroid?

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
um well I actually own it on

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
Super Nintendo so I've played it before

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
yeah yeah there you go

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
but you're very

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
you're very well thought out

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
and it being your favorite game ever because it is

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
pretty amazing

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
that is the right answer sir

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
I will side with you in your whole

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
Chrono Trigger debate that I think Super Metroid

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
is a far better game than Chrono Trigger

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
oh it's comparing

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
apples and oranges though I don't care how many

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
times you have five to cite tonight you get a gold

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
star for that comment

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
if you're comparing RPGs

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
Chrono Trigger is up at the top next to

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
Final Fantasy 6 but

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
action games

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
okay okay Jamie in the

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
RPG department I will say that I

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
like Chrono Cross better than Chrono Trigger

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
but if we're sticking to just SNES

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
just SNES?

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
Final Fantasy 6 vs Chrono Trigger

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
I think is the great SNES debate

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
okay well for me then that would be

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
Super Mario RPG

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
good answer actually good answer

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
fair answer fair answer

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
also you mentioned um this shirt

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
earlier yes you can tell because

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
it's like backwards but it's the Symphony of the

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
Goddesses shirt it's not backwards on our end

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
it's not backwards on our end I guess the camera flips

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
properly yeah that's weird yeah we see it

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
yeah on my

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
end it is backwards so I'm like

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
I don't know that's weird that's weird

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
but have you guys made it out to see Symphony

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
of the Goddesses yet? no but I want

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
to but you know what I said earlier about

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
a lot of stuff going on

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
yeah I think um

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
I was at Sunshine

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
I think you mentioned something about it coming back

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
to California soon I believe I

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
heard it's going to be in Oakland or somewhere

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
in the East Bay soon and

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
I honestly think it was

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
like early June it's probably

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
when I'm in LA

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
just my luck

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000

all your listeners should go drink coffee that's what they should do

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
alright

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
I do not judge because I am

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
and we're not those kind of people

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
everybody's and until we totally are

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
ray stevens wasn't it was it I think so

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
I don't know you know it's funny I told

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
when I was on the way back uh to

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
gulf port to get on the plane I

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
texted dan from pascagoula

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
so he asked if there were squirrels going berserk

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
cause that was another ray steven song

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
you guys are such

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
nerds so alright

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
let's go to another call

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
this is the legend of zaku here

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
three video calls in a row

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
look at that what's up zaku

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
uh nothing much just trying to

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
stay dry high and dry right now

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
with all this thunder outside

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
I heard it's raining out there on the east coast

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
oh cause that's probably all the unfortunate

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
tornado weather that was in the midwest probably making

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
its way over there right is that yeah I've already

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
heard a few rumbles ugh

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
which by the way I hope

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
everybody's I know code man lives

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
in oklahoma so I checked in with him earlier in the week

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
I don't know I don't know who else of our listenership

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
is in that area affected by the tornadoes but

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
I hope y'all are okay I hope your stuff's hooked

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
up to surge protectors too well code man

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
was on oh my god he's got a shirt I want

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
I freaking love

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
dream theater oh my god

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
dream theater's

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
freaking awesome

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
alright zaku I surely you

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
did not just call in tonight to get complimented by

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
dark soccer although I wouldn't blame you if you did

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
what's on your mind tonight

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
well I guess well

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
to put it bluntly

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
I think we're approaching

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
the next video game crash

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
now call me cynical

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
but if you look at the rumblings

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
of how microsoft

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
uh announced to the world

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
about the xbox one how

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
they're basically

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
you can't you're not getting a straight answer

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
from them regarding used games

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
it's contradicting each answer is contradicting

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
one another kind of like

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
the like heisenberg's

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
rule of uncertainty

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
it's uncertainty principle where if you study

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
something long enough

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
it's properties change

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
dynamically

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
so it keeps shifting around

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
so there's no in other words

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
you're still left with

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
so many unopened questions and

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
and it's getting to the

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
point where we don't own things

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
anymore it's kind of like the steam

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
model being pigeonholed

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
into the console

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
even though it's not

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
the appropriate medium

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
wait do you blame steam for

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
what xbox let's say worst

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
case scenario is true with xbox one

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
do you blame steam for that do you think

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
that everybody's looking at steam going

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
well they get away with digital downloads

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
well I mean it's expected

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
that a console which

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
for lack of a better

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
word it's just like you know

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
it's a dumb computer it only

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
does certain functions

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
yeah but you know what it does great is connect

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
to online games right Loki that's

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
one thing it does very well

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
yeah anyway sorry

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
well okay

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
but I mean it's like

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
it's expected that all the

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
media for a video named

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
console is physical

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
it's like it's tangible even

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
though they do exist

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
as game downloads

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
and that's already accepted

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
and you know as

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
a standard where you only own

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
the license to that particular

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
digital copy

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
but if you buy something tangible

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
wouldn't you expect that the first

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
sale doctrine would apply to it

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
but I'm thinking Microsoft

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
is thinking about a little

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
decision where the folks

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
from Autodesk

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
come in

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
Zaku stop talking

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
alright I gotta ask you this

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
because I wanna play devil's

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
advocate and this is important because you say that

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
you know we expect something tangible

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
I'm not gonna disagree with you I like

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
having the tangibleness I've been very

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
disappointed that manuals are going away

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
and instead we're eating these inserts

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
these inserts that say go to our website

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
like that really ticks me off

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
but hold on devil's advocate

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
is that at one point in this industry

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
it was cartridges, cartridges

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
cartridges, Atari 26 cartridges, NES

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
cartridges, Super NES cartridges and then all of a

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
sudden disc and there were some people

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
that would say cartridges for life

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
and Nintendo was one of those people and they paid

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
for it on the N64

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
yes that is true however even

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
with the disc era starting with playstation

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
you know and anything

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
slightly earlier than that

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
you're able to lend it out

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
to anybody, to your friends

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
now all of a sudden Microsoft wants

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
to impose like you know paying for that game

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
all over again I mean

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
when you buy something you're

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
presuming it's pretty

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
much common presumption that

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
you pretty much own

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
it you're able to do what you want

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
to lend it out but

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
in this case for the Xbox One

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
it's a much tighter grip

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
it's equity, it's equity on what

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
you value

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
like this huge wall of

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
DVDs I'll never watch they at least have

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
equity I could get 50 cents at

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
a dimple or something

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
which is a local chain that buys

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
these things

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
compared to those discs it's like a house

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
you buy a house and then you sell it

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
for hopefully more money later on it's like a car

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
you buy it and then hopefully you can sell it

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
later on and I know a lot of people are saying

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
a video game is different than a car but

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
until now our games

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
have had equity and now

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
we're saying we might lose that and that is

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
not good when you're asking me to pay

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
$60 for a game that will be

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
worth zero when I try to resell it

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
more importantly it's

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
collusion between not only the

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
game developers

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
the manufacturers

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
they're colluding with GameStop

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
to find a way

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
like maybe

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
well I mean from what I'm hearing

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
it's you have to

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
it's rumor

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
it's an exchange so to speak

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
it's almost similar to how the Yankees

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
basically opted out of

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
StubHub to create their own ticket exchange

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
because up until

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
last year me and my girl were able to get

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
like you know

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
home tickets for really good

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
seats at below face value

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
and I think this is what's happening

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
they're taking the same

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
approach where they want to cut out any other middle

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
man and basically set

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
their own terms and set their own

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
prices for certain games

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
holy crap I just saw lightning in the background

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
that was crazy did you guys see that?

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
like totally flashed in his window there

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
sorry

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
this is why we don't do a video show

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
I get too distracted there's something shiny

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
behind you there's something shiny

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
okay look Zaku I gotta wrap

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
this up for time but I do want to say this about the

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
video game crash I do feel like

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
sometimes as cynical gamers

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
we do sit here with every console generation

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
and go the game crash the game crash the game crash

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
I don't think the video game industry is going to

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
crash necessarily

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
but hold on

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
I feel there is a very real possibility

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
that both the PlayStation 4

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
and the Xbox One

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
and hell the Wii U as well there's a very

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
real possibility all three of them

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
fail and they could call that

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
a video game crash but you know who the winner

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
is in that situation the current generation

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
because people still have those

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
consoles

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
well yeah that too and then mobile which

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
never had those which those nations were

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
were never a

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
a mood point to begin with I mean

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
there were never an issue to begin

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
with I mean all digital

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
everything on mobile is pretty much

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
digital so it's

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
the same rules that apply to PC

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
and you

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
know if it turns out that

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
Sony is basically pulling the same tricks

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
as Microsoft and

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
God help them if they find

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
a way to spin it really well better than

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
what Microsoft was able to then

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
yeah there might be a crash

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
long overdue it might even happen

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
a lot sooner if they flop

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
at the end of the year or early next

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
yeah people will still clutch

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
to their existing 360s

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
and PS3s like myself

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
I hope it's not an all out

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
crash because I know a lot of people in the industry

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
that would be affected

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
as I said it might not

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
I may have exaggerated when saying

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
crash without like adding context and scope

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
it will be a crash

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
with like traditional consoles

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
mobile and any other casual

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
aspects of gaming will

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
be unscathed

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
because they appeal to a broader audience

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
alright

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
Zaku I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
but thank you for your opinion take care

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
bye you too

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
don't get hit by lightning

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
I love when we get like really

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
in depth discussion like that though

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
yeah Zaku doesn't you know

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
love Zaku or hate him when he gets on his

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
train where he won't let me talk

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
but he's very passionate

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
and I love that I love all your guys' passion

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
that's what this show is all about all you guys

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
and I love Utada Hikaru's passion

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
I do it's a good song

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
thank you guys for putting up with our

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
internet up and down fuckery tonight

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
we really appreciate it

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
we'll be back next week next week is the big pre

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
E3 show that is the week to lock in

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
our predictions and guess what guys

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
you know we gotta use this as an excuse

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
to bring back listless and the thing we

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000
most want to happen want to see happen

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
so be thinking about it now

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
we'll be back one week from tonight to do

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
all that but in the meantime it's time to

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000
end tonight's show

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000
I just wanted to let you know that there was a mention of a

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
very old joke when I was hanging out with

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
Jammer Jay oh god

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000
Pantsless Rage of course of course alright look

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.000
Loki any other last minute stories before

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000
we wrap it up and say print

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000
yeah Shadow Warrior you remember it's

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000
being remade well the classic is available

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
free on Steam forever

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
so go play it and then finally

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
the Super Mario Brothers movie

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
has celebrated its 20th

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
anniversary

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
so that's it

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
alright

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
oh and one other thing

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
one other thing that Steam does better than

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
you know the Xbox One

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
the Alan Wake series on

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
the Xbox 360

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
right now is $20

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
$4 on Steam

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
that's why people don't mind DRM

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
you can get a series of games for

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
$4 or the Humble Bundle where you can get

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
the entire franchise

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
like 20 games

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
for 5 bucks

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
alright

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
that is going to do it there for

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000

now we can go around and get everybody's final thought

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
so my final thought tonight

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
I'll start is that it's time to check

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
in for my airline because I want a good seat

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
AC's not working, boo

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
the AC's working here

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
in my house, boo

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
oh, you want to stay here tonight?

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
no, not working well I guess

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
oh, that's still terrible

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
well if the little one gets too warm you and Nellie are welcome to bring him over

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
to my house, it's not gonna be that hot tonight

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
where Midna will nibble his toes

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
get that thing fixed before it gets really bad

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
be thankful you're not going to Phoenix

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
tomorrow then in that case

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
Dark Saga, your final thought tonight

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
I have done two feet

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
and am attaching the major parts of the body

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
of my scale mate

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
and when I am done with him

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
hopefully, because I never sleep so it might be tonight

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000
I will post pictures up

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000
are they happy feet?

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
they're kind of deflated

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
because they have no stuffing

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
but I could put them on my fingers

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
and pretend they're real feet

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
see, look, real feet

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
you need a little picture of that for

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
I am scale mate feet

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
I think I am going to name my scale mate

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
sir no stuffing

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
or something

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
alright, I'll name him Stouffer

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
ok, that's it, we're done

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000

we're an indie show, we don't have big money to be

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
selling ads, we don't have the type of

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
listener base that's going to give us a quarter of a million dollars

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
on Kickstarter, all we have is word of mouth

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
