0	19920	Today, June 9th, 2013, Microsoft's controversial announcements could change the industry forever.
19920	25040	Zinga layoffs affect a developer they recently acquired, and E3 is next week and we're making
25040	32400	our predictions for the big show.
32400	35560	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
35560	37640	where every gamer has a voice.
37640	44960	It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 507 for this June 9th of 2013.
44960	49240	My name is Rob Roberts, joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
49240	50240	Greetings and salutations.
50240	53100	And I hope you're doing well, Ms. Summers.
53100	54100	I am.
54100	55100	I'm good.
55100	56100	I'm caffeinated.
56100	57100	Thank you, Rob.
57100	58100	Good to hear.
58100	59100	And also joining us tonight, Techmaster Loki.
59100	63900	Yes, definitely working in that Techmaster moniker this week.
63900	64900	How so?
64900	65900	Quickly.
65900	66900	I had to fix my laptop.
66900	67900	Oh, yeah.
67900	68900	Hard drive crash.
68900	71820	Yeah, I've been following your tweets, your Twitters, and all the hard drive drama.
71820	75620	But now it works pretty much like it did before.
75620	77620	All it needed was a little reformat.
77620	81540	All the non-essential stuff's not working, like some of these touch buttons up the top
81540	87020	here that I never use, or, you know, the icon's different now for the volume up and
87020	88020	down.
88020	89020	But, eh, whatever.
89020	90020	All right.
90020	91020	Big week this week.
91020	92780	E3, obviously, coming up.
92780	95180	Unfortunately, none of us attending this year.
95180	99160	Bobby Blackwolf from The Voice of Geeks Network at vognetwork.com, he is attending.
99160	103860	And if you haven't already checked it out, do check out the interactive coverage of E3,
103860	109140	presented in an all-new way at the voice of geeksnetwork of e3.vognetwork.com, or at least
109140	110140	we think it's an all-new way.
110140	111140	The internet's a big place.
112140	113140	Probably.
113140	114140	But very cool.
114140	115140	I haven't seen it.
115140	118780	Bobby will be on the show later to tell us a little more about that and participate with
118780	123340	us on something else, but I will table that until Part B. It's obviously a very big show
123340	124340	tonight.
124340	125980	There is a lot going on in the gaming world.
125980	129340	Usually we do a kickoff topic, but I think tonight we need to address the pink elephant
129340	130800	in the room.
130800	132100	Let's get into it, Loki.
132100	140540	So after the whole, well, I guess the promise was after the Xbox One press event thing that
140580	147100	they did back in May, that there was going to be some answers about, or clarification
147100	155300	I guess, on the big hot topics that they were getting grilled on after the event, basically.
155300	158540	What is the deal with the online connectivity?
158540	160620	How often do I need to connect to the internet?
160620	163580	How is the used game thing going to work?
163580	169220	And what's up with the Kinect having to be online all the time, or attached to your system
169220	170540	at all times of work?
170540	174540	So on Friday, I think it was Friday, was it Friday?
174540	175540	Yeah, the 6th.
175540	178140	On Friday, no, that was Thursday.
178140	186180	Anyways, on the 6th, they released a three page document, if you will, called Xbox One
186180	193260	Details on Connectivity, Licensing, and Privacy Features.
193260	197300	So let's just go through each one, shall we?
197300	204580	First, Xbox One, a modern connected device.
204580	210100	And to kind of spoil everything, none of this stuff is actually sounding any good.
210100	216060	It's pretty much just reinforcing what we already have heard, that they said, oh, we'll
216060	217060	make change.
217060	221300	So the Xbox One will deliver new benefits for gamers that are only possible with a system
221300	223620	designed from the ground up to be ready and connected.
223620	225740	Here are a few examples.
225740	228100	First generation games powered by the cloud.
228100	234860	So you'll be able to use the cloud servers to make your game more powerful or something.
234860	236940	Your Xbox One is always ready.
236940	240260	It's designed to run with, I guess, a low powered state.
240260	243260	OK, let's get to the good part.
243260	249780	Network technologies and network requirements, here we go.
249780	255720	For an optimal experience, we recommend a broadband connection of 1.5 megabits.
255720	264280	And also, in areas where, I guess, an ethernet connection is not available, you can connect
264280	266240	using mobile broadband.
266240	267480	Lucky you.
267480	271940	And also, while a persistent connection is not required, the Xbox One is designed to
271940	277480	verify if the system application or game updates are needed, and to see if you have acquired
277480	284160	new games, resold or traded in games, or have given a game to a friend.
284160	288960	Games that are designed to take advantage of the cloud system may require a connection.
288960	293360	And then, of course, with Xbox One, you can game offline for up to 24 hours on your primary
293360	298400	console or one hour if you're logged into a separate console accessing your library.
298400	304720	Offline gaming is not possible after these prescribed times until you reestablish a connection,
304720	308380	but you can still, oh, oh, and this is the best part, but guess what?
308380	313600	You can still watch live TV, enjoy your Blu-ray and DVD movies.
313640	315280	Oh, thank you, Xbox One.
315280	318960	I can still enjoy TV that you are connected to.
325200	329960	Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to mourn the loss of the gaming industry.
329960	331160	Rest in peace.
331160	333440	All right, let's get to the next thing here.
333440	340840	All right, so next, how game licensing will work on the Xbox One.
340880	344360	And I'm glad that they have to tell me how it's gonna work.
344360	349160	Okay, so basically, you buy the games the way you want, disc or digital, and you'll
349160	353000	be able to buy them through traditional retailers or online through Xbox Live.
353000	356560	And it says, disc will continue to be a great way to install your game quickly.
356560	360520	Yes, to install, not play off of install.
360520	365440	You can access your entire games library from any Xbox One, no discs required.
365440	369840	Because after all, you're signing in and accessing the games that you have installed to your
369840	372680	system or the cloud or whatever it is.
372680	376560	You can share access with your games to everyone inside your home.
376560	380480	Your friends, family, and your guests and acquaintances get unlimited access to all
380480	381480	your games.
381480	385400	Anyone can play your games on your console regardless of whether you're logged in or
385400	386840	their relationship to you.
386840	393400	In other words, a feature that's been available on console gaming since the beginning of time.
393400	398440	That yes, if I bring a friend over, that they can play on the Xbox One without it going,
399040	400040	Who are you?
400040	404840	What are you doing trying to touch my controller and play this game?
404840	407120	Get your hands off my controller.
407120	410000	I need an adult.
410000	417080	You can share access, let's see, give your family access to your entire games library
417080	418080	anytime, anywhere.
418080	419700	Now this is kind of weird.
419700	423640	The Xbox One, I guess, they're going to have a way where up to 10 people of your family
423640	429920	or whoever you're seeing as your family can log in and play from your shared games library
429920	431600	on any Xbox One.
431600	437480	So if I buy a copy of say, Forza Motorsports or something like that, someone else can go
437480	442720	to a friend's house or whatever or from their own location and play that copy of Forza as
442720	443720	well.
443720	446560	But only one person can play at a time.
446560	447560	And not at launch.
447560	450000	None of this is available at launch.
450000	451880	All the good stuff, all the pros, not at launch.
451920	453640	I don't know if that's available at launch.
453640	455720	It doesn't say.
455720	459440	Trade in and resell your disc based games.
459440	460440	Okay.
460440	465960	It says today some gamers choose to sell their old disc based games back for cash and credit.
465960	472560	We've designed the Xbox One so game publishers can enable you to trade in your games at participating
472560	473560	retailers.
473560	475400	So it's an optional feature.
475400	478560	So no eBay, gone.
478560	480740	No flea markets, gone.
480740	482740	No garage sales, gone.
482740	486360	Authorized retailers only if the publisher allows it.
486360	489420	It's now not my choice on what I'm going to do with my game.
489420	492940	It's now Microsoft's choice or the publisher's choice on what I'm going to do with my game.
492940	493940	But we don't own it.
493940	494940	We're licensing it.
494940	495940	That's right.
495940	498460	It was never ours to begin with.
498460	501460	I don't sign a form when I'm playing these games.
501460	504460	Although I'm sure you're going to have to agree to it when you install your game.
504460	505460	Oh sure.
505460	510340	Press A to agree to the 500 page terms and conditions or you won't be able to play anything.
510340	511740	Because things are brick.
511740	517360	Let's see, Microsoft does not charge a platform fee to retailers, publishers, or consumers
517360	520880	for enabling transfer of these games.
520880	524660	Which I don't know, it kind of goes against what I've heard and what we've been hearing
524660	525660	rumors wise.
525660	527820	But maybe it's not Microsoft charging them.
527820	529140	Maybe it's the publisher's charging these guys.
529140	530340	I don't really know.
530340	531940	Whatever that doesn't.
531940	533500	All right.
533500	537020	So what are the key points out of this whole thing because we got to get to the bottom
537020	538020	line here.
538020	539020	Well a couple more.
539020	540020	Okay.
540860	542940	They're going to allow you to give your games to a friend.
542940	547460	So you can enable your disc based game, give it to a friend basically.
547460	548940	There's no fees.
548940	552220	But there's two requirements in order to transfer this to your friend.
552220	558860	They have to be on your friend's list for 30 days and you can only give the game once.
558860	563020	Once it's been transferred to them, I don't think that they can give it back to someone
563020	564020	else.
564020	565660	Now I don't know if that's clarified.
565660	567580	So no wishing for more wishes?
567580	568580	Yes.
568580	569580	Okay.
569660	573340	If it is where you can give it to somebody, you know, the friend's list thing is kind
573340	576900	of annoying, but like say you can give it to them and then they can give it to somebody
576900	582220	else, you know, that's not so bad, but it's still annoying.
582220	583220	You know what?
583220	585100	I will give credit where credit is due.
585100	589020	It sounds like Microsoft's trying to implement the Kindle book borrowing thing, which just
589020	593420	sounds a lot like, and I'm like, all right, that's cool because I know I lent out a lot
593420	594420	of video games.
594420	595420	I never get back.
595420	596420	So that's interesting.
596420	601420	It can be handled all digitally, but, um, you know, what am I having to give up?
601420	602860	What's the minus for this plus?
602860	603860	Right?
603860	604860	Yeah.
604860	605860	Okay.
605860	606860	And last but not least, I'll just breeze through this.
606860	607860	The connect stuff.
607860	612200	Um, they say you're in control of where the connect can see in here because I guess you
612200	614580	get to adjust your privacy settings or something.
614580	618860	So the system will navigate you through key privacy options like automatic or manual sign
618860	622260	in privacy settings and clear notification how data is used.
622260	624540	Wait, how is data being used?
624540	627980	So I'm assuming this thing is just going to be listening for, you know, advertising
627980	628980	purposes and stuff.
628980	634460	If they hear a lot of wank, a lot of porn, you're in control of what the connect or of
634460	637860	the connect sensor, um, sensing on, off or paused.
637860	643620	Um, you can turn off your Xbox one and um, you know, if they say it's only listening
643620	648340	for a single voice command of Xbox on, but come on, I'm sorry.
648340	653140	Uh, you're in control of your personal data and you can use other inputs to control your
653140	655460	games TV and entertainment experiences.
655460	658420	So once again, why do I need to connect, you know, attached to this thing?
658420	662700	If I can control it with a controller, it doesn't make it's, I'm going to be honest
662700	667560	and I'm not trying to be that snarky kid on Twitter, but I, I, I'm, this is really kind
667560	672580	of like a, it's a vague answer that they kind of gave to this like, so, so what does it
672580	675060	have to be on or not?
675060	679340	Well there's, it's basically, it has to be connected to your system, but I think you
679340	683860	can point it at the wall, you can turn your system off or something and then it won't
683860	684860	be listening.
684860	689100	Just don't underestimate the value of, of privacy and all that.
689100	691820	And this is really badly timed for Microsoft.
691820	695900	I mean, again, there's a lot of news that there's a lot of, there's a lot of news out
695900	696900	there right now.
696900	697900	I'm not trying to get political.
697900	701300	I'm not going to take the show there, but there's a lot of news right now about privacy
701300	703540	and Microsoft's names involved.
703540	704540	Exactly.
704540	710220	So this is not a good time to be requiring anything with that connect, just saying.
710220	712700	And they're, they're saying that they, you know, some of the examples, of course they've
712700	717180	mentioned before, a fitness game can measure your heart rate, give you feedback about your
717180	722020	exercise routine or whatever, be able to tell if you're a communist, a card game could allow
722020	726500	you to bluff your virtual opponent using your facial expressions.
726500	730100	But once again, you know, the connect could allow you to scan in your objects and use
730100	732020	them in real games.
732020	733020	That never happens.
733020	734020	So who knows?
734500	735500	Okay, so that's it.
735500	736500	That's basically the information.
736500	742620	Um, well, uh, here's the thing you ever seen that show Shark Tank, you ever watched that
742620	743620	show?
743620	744620	Yeah.
744620	745620	Yeah.
745620	746620	Here's the premise of the show.
746620	748540	These guys pitched their ideas to all these big executives.
748540	750860	Like Mark Cuban's one of the executives that sits there.
750860	753660	It's actually, as far as reality TV goes, it's one of the better shows.
753660	756300	Cause it's, it's a little more like these guys are real business makers and you kind
756300	760780	of see, like, I dunno, there, there's less of the pompousness that comes with the Donald
760780	764540	Trump business show and there's a little more like, you know, reality, I guess for
764540	765640	lack of a better term.
765640	769740	But anyway, the whole kitsch kitchens, there's, they're pitching their ideas and you know,
769740	773700	maybe it's a lady who's got a new idea for something for that women could have at their
773700	774700	weddings or a guy.
774700	779640	I just seem to remember an episode where a guy, uh, was selling man candles because that
779640	782700	ended up being a thing at like Yankee Canada, one of those later on.
782700	783700	Yeah, like mandels.
783700	787980	Well, anyway, the whole pitch is that as you're given these ideas, if one of the executive
787980	791700	says I'm out, that's their sign that they are not going to put a bid.
791700	795580	And if all four of them say I'm out, the guy loses, walks away, doesn't get the financing
795580	796580	they want.
796580	800540	And I got to admit after listening to this, this, this whole detail thing that's, that's
800540	803020	gone on this week, I'm kind of sitting in that chair.
803020	807600	And when I'm hearing about the whole, here's the minuses, here's a plus in the game trading
807600	808600	and all that.
808600	811940	But here's all these minuses that suddenly these $60 games may not be worth anything
811940	812940	anymore.
812940	814900	I do not have, that's what I hate the most.
814900	817860	I no longer have the power to sell this game on eBay.
817860	821340	If I want to do it, I have to go to a GameStop or a comparable store.
821340	822520	Are you kidding me?
822520	823740	That's not what I want.
823740	826980	And that's the point where I said, I'm out.
826980	830820	And on top of that, the plus is like, Oh, you can loan it to your friend.
830820	835740	Something I can do already right now with all these fucking restrictions and why, why
835740	838200	do I even, and that's the thing.
838200	841980	It's so sad that this has to happen because I want to be excited about this new console.
841980	846620	I wanted to be excited about the games that they're coming out with, but I'm sorry.
846620	849780	Even if there's like a new crackdown game or whatever, the big awesome game they're
849780	853860	going to show is all this stuff is just like right in front of me and it's like, well,
853860	857060	that sounds cool, but nope.
857060	860100	To me, it's very much like how I treat origin.
860100	862060	Battlefield 3 looks fucking amazing.
862060	863620	I really want to play that game.
863620	867340	I'm not installing origin, so therefore I'm not going to play the game.
867340	868340	That's it.
868340	869340	I mean, it's unfortunate.
869340	873820	These games look awesome, but all this stuff stands in my way, so I'm not going to do it.
873820	879420	For me, a lot of it is kind of about control and I feel like what's happening this console
879420	884940	generation that I just don't fucking like is that the publishers are trying to take
884940	890700	all these things away from me that I used to get as the investor in the game.
890700	891900	You know what I mean?
891900	896860	Like I used to be able to sell the used games and, you know, trade the games I wanted to
896860	898340	and they could put in the disc or whatever.
898340	902020	Like the publishers have been slowly thinking of ways to take that away and I just don't
902020	903020	like it.
903020	909940	I understand the cost of developing a game is super expensive and all that, but the line's
909940	910940	got to be drawn somewhere.
910940	912580	It doesn't have to be super expensive.
912580	917980	They decided to go big and, you know, big and bold, I guess, for their games.
917980	918980	It doesn't have to be.
918980	921220	Indie games that come out are still just as good.
921220	923020	How much does it cost to develop Minecraft?
923020	927340	Granted, it's not as visually stunning as something else, but it doesn't have to be
927340	928340	visually stunning.
928340	929340	It just has to be fun.
929340	930340	It has to be fun to play.
930340	931740	That's all it has to be.
931740	932980	Let me go to the chatroom.
932980	937260	Lots and lots of folks chatting on this and I don't want to ignore you guys, live.vognetwork.com
937260	941020	where we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern
941020	945300	right after the Bobby Black Wolf show as the Voice of the Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
945300	948980	YYR in chat starting us off tonight saying, Rob, this is the way the industry wants to
948980	949980	move.
949980	953380	I understand that, that this is the way the industry wants to move, but I have a right
953380	957180	to say I'm not moving with it and I think we all have that right.
957180	960180	Well, the industries don't determine what the consumers do.
960180	962780	The consumers determine what the industry should do.
962780	967260	I want to make, well, I want to make an analogy to where I think this is all going, but actually
967260	971020	first I want to address because I see numerous people in chat rooms saying, well, that's
971020	972020	it.
972020	978220	PS4 is for me this generation, but Monday hasn't happened yet, at least as of the taping
978220	979220	of the show.
979220	982300	I realized, you know, by the time some of you were hearing this on the podcast, Monday
982300	983580	may have already happened.
983580	989300	We don't really know where Sony's at and some of the signs point to they're going down a
989300	990300	similar path.
990300	992740	I think they are, but I don't think it's definitely, well, it's definitely not going to be part
992740	994060	of their presentation.
994060	998700	It's going to be people grilling them on it again and, I mean, look at all the stuff that's
998700	1004340	happened before, you know, before all this, this, this whole three page thing came out,
1004340	1010380	there was reports going Microsoft canceled their after, you know, conference Q&A session.
1010380	1012900	They canceled their one-on-one interviews.
1012900	1016060	They just don't want to talk to people and then they put this stuff out and that's it.
1016060	1021860	They're just leaving it at that, but on top of all this, so you first off the whole game
1021860	1024620	sharing thing with your family and stuff.
1024620	1027940	Don't assume for one second that they're not going to expect each one of those people to
1027940	1033100	have live, you know, a paid subscription to live in order for that to happen.
1033100	1036380	And so why am I having to pay money for this console?
1036380	1042740	Pay money for live and like, it's like I had to pay for the privilege to be like fucked
1042740	1047180	over because you want to start, you're feeling greedy or something that you feel like we're
1047180	1048900	just not giving you enough money.
1048940	1054340	I also just don't like the fact that the Xbox has to talk to the servers once every 24 hours
1054340	1058580	because you know, it's not that I have a problem with it in theory or on paper.
1058580	1060660	Like you know, I do, I play a lot of MMOs.
1060660	1062980	Of course those talk to the servers.
1062980	1068720	I'm not so much caring about it in principle, but the reality is what's going to happen
1068720	1072820	when those servers go down because they will go down and history has shown that this is
1072820	1073820	what happens.
1073820	1077560	PlayStation network down for months due to a hack attack.
1077560	1080860	You don't think there's kiddies out there that want to hack this new network the minute
1080860	1084240	it goes up because they're angry too.
1084240	1087520	Xbox live goes down for a day or two at a time.
1087520	1090240	Granted, a lot of that is about maintenance, whatever.
1090240	1091600	But then we see things happen.
1091600	1093200	Diablo three, we can handle it.
1093200	1094200	We can handle it.
1094200	1096160	Crash, boom, error 37.
1096160	1097500	Sim city by EA.
1097500	1098500	We can handle it.
1098500	1099500	We can handle it.
1099500	1100500	Crash, boom.
1100500	1101500	It all goes down.
1101500	1105200	Xbox will go down.
1105200	1107120	What happens then?
1107120	1111480	You're not going to be able to convince me otherwise because history has shown it will
1111480	1113760	go down and what is going to happen.
1113760	1119920	Wank there is, there is no server on the face of the earth that has not, you know, that
1119920	1122960	has not gone down for any period of time.
1122960	1126920	I mean, I know they're saying that it's going to have a ton of, you know, they're going
1126920	1129720	to have a ton of servers or virtual servers or whatever, but they're going to have to
1129720	1131120	perform maintenance on these things.
1131120	1136360	It's got to go down for maintenance for a certain amount of time.
1136360	1138920	I mean, it's just, it's going to lock people out at some point.
1138920	1140760	Can we go back to PlayStation four though?
1140760	1145240	Because I do think there's a distinct possibility, at least some of this is going to be true
1145240	1147080	about Sony system as well.
1147080	1148080	Yeah.
1148080	1151800	Um, and to which parts not sure, but it seems like maybe the game registration, especially
1151800	1156320	in you, you, you told me before the show, you're banking a lot on EA's online pass and
1156320	1161360	their reason to get rid of that is because they've got the buy in from Sony and Microsoft
1161360	1163720	and they've given the finger to Nintendo essentially.
1163720	1164720	They won't.
1164720	1165720	Nintendo is nothing to them.
1165760	1167520	It's a very minimalist, minimal amount of copy.
1167520	1168520	They're belittling it.
1168520	1169520	Yeah.
1169520	1170880	So they, they just don't care about that right now.
1170880	1175520	But I think they wouldn't have gone all in if they didn't know that it was a guarantee
1175520	1180300	from both parties, both public or both, uh, console manufacturers.
1180300	1186440	And honestly, I just have a hot, especially we have to see how similar it is.
1186440	1191440	If it's very similar, I'm, there's some serious antitrust, you know, concerns there because
1191440	1195720	it's like, what are these guys just sit down and make, decide, Hey, we're going to do this.
1195720	1197760	This is how we're going to do this system.
1197760	1201380	And you know, we're going to both be on board and we're going to both benefit from it because
1201380	1202840	they're going to have no choice.
1202840	1205400	You know, we're going to get rid of options for them.
1205400	1210380	But I like, you know, even though there's all this negative information, I have to wait
1210380	1214680	until when the console come out before I can make my decision because they could very well,
1214680	1217320	hopefully, you know, say, fuck you guys.
1217320	1220800	You know, you know, seriously to EA.
1221480	1222840	What are they going to do?
1222840	1227400	They got to, you kind of get some balls here because what's Microsoft can do.
1227400	1230240	They can say, fuck you EA, what are you going to do?
1230240	1231800	Not publish games on our console.
1231800	1234240	And if Microsoft and Sony does that, what are they going to do?
1234240	1235480	Publish PC only?
1235480	1240440	I mean, they're not, they have to kind of agree on some sort of partnership here.
1240440	1247200	It's just, I mean, if Sony, let's just say in a perfect world, Sony would, you know, say,
1247200	1249200	okay, listen, we're not going to put up with this bullshit.
1249200	1252720	We're just going to keep things kind of the way they are right now.
1252720	1254800	And they could totally have this in the bag.
1254800	1255800	Easy, easy.
1255800	1261200	This generation could come out on top and just totally rule everything.
1261200	1263200	But I have a feeling that's not the case.
1263200	1267680	I don't think Microsoft would take a risk like that without, you know, knowing that
1267680	1269120	both parties are going to do that.
1269120	1272800	But yet there, you know, there's going to be some little differences in policy because
1272800	1277040	for instance, we heard last week about how Sony is mandating that there be off screen
1277040	1279280	play or whatever for PlayStation Vita.
1279280	1281840	So there are going to be little twists in the rules.
1281840	1289600	So you know, maybe, maybe, maybe Microsoft implemented, just, just theorizing a tinfoil
1289600	1295360	hat here, maybe Microsoft invented the whole game sharing Amazon Kindle thing to try and
1295360	1299880	put a little positive in a negative that they agreed to with Sony.
1299880	1301360	And maybe Sony is not going to have that.
1301360	1305520	Maybe Sony's, Sony's only got the negative and their positive is the PlayStation Vita
1305520	1306520	play.
1306520	1310960	You know, that kind of where one where we're trying to see who can come up with the best
1310960	1312920	silver lining to the shitty situation.
1312920	1313920	But see, that's the thing.
1313920	1319040	It's like, like I've, there's some people on Twitter and stuff and saying, hey, well,
1319040	1321000	the 10 game sharing thing is kind of cool.
1321000	1324280	I can share my games with someone else cause then I can cost average, you know, the games
1324280	1325280	I'm buying.
1325280	1329960	I'm like, but, but so what you can do that anyways, just, you know, you loan your games
1329960	1331200	to your friends if you really want to.
1331200	1336000	I just don't, I don't want to look, just say, well, at least they have this.
1336000	1340280	Okay, well that's good, but no, they're taking away all this stuff from us.
1340280	1341280	I'm sorry.
1341280	1344920	I'll just stick with what I've got right now and if I have to, I'll just go PC because
1344920	1350320	at least there there's flexibility with, I know, I know there's DRM with steam, but there's
1350320	1352120	also mods with steam.
1352120	1353900	There's also all sorts of customization.
1353900	1355600	There's indie games.
1355600	1358000	There's just insane sales on stuff.
1358000	1363040	I can honestly say yes, I use steam, but I have, I'm, I really think I maybe, maybe
1363040	1366960	ever bought one game, one game in the years I've owned steam.
1366960	1372520	I've bought one game full retail price and that would have been Civ five, a PC only game.
1372520	1374480	I never have.
1374480	1379400	And even when I could have gotten a, yeah, then it was stupid origin bullshit.
1379400	1384360	But when I bought mass effect three, for example, yeah, I bought it new, but I went and price
1384360	1387920	matched somewhere, so I didn't pay full price for it and didn't go through origin.
1387920	1388920	Oh yeah.
1388920	1391720	If they, if Microsoft were to announce at the end of their press conference, by the
1391720	1397600	way, uh, we're going to be lowering the price of games from $60 to $30 I I'm in, I'm back
1397600	1402600	in because if that's the plus that the games are now going to cost half as much, you know,
1402600	1406960	so okay, you know, I'll be back in, in a heartbeat.
1406960	1407960	It's not going to happen.
1407960	1410040	It's not going to happen because here's, what's going to happen.
1410040	1411040	Here's what it is.
1411040	1414360	You think that you're going to get better prices because now the stuff, now they're
1414360	1417100	getting rid of the used market, so to speak.
1417100	1420660	It's not going to happen because on PC you have multiple storefronts that are competing
1420660	1425000	with each other and yeah, it may be all steam DRM and stuff, but they're having sales all
1425000	1429120	across the board with Microsoft going this route.
1429120	1432920	Not only are you going to be limited where you can trade your game in, so right there
1432920	1437320	you're not going to get a really good deal as far as trading value goes because, Hey,
1437320	1439920	we're also going to go, we're your only options.
1439920	1443880	So your trading value is going to fucking suck to begin with and on top of that, you
1443880	1446120	think they're really going to mark down prices of games.
1446120	1450880	Hell, there's games on their Xbox games on demand service right now that are still way
1450880	1453460	above what you can actually get them in a disk space format.
1453460	1456200	So no, you're kidding yourself.
1456200	1457680	A couple of great comments in our chat room.
1457680	1461840	I want to get to Ahamkara in our chat says, I noticed Japan is not porting some of their
1461840	1466000	best games out of the country offer good games to themselves for cheap or free and don't
1466000	1467000	seem to care.
1467000	1471280	Funny how Microsoft is giving them the finger now by focusing on TV for Xbox one and not
1471280	1472720	caring about Japan as well.
1472720	1477280	Well, I mean, we've all kind of sat here going, well, clearly Microsoft's written off Japan,
1477280	1483120	but if Sony were to adopt these similar measures, how would that impact Japanese gaming culture?
1483120	1484120	Are Japanese game?
1484120	1486720	I mean, I honestly don't know.
1486720	1492040	Are Japanese gamers as willing to buy into all this?
1492080	1496600	I think that it's not necessarily going to work because from what, just from what I've
1496600	1500320	seen and of course we need somebody who lives there to confirm this.
1500320	1505960	There's a big culture around having collectibles being, you know, one of the campers to get
1505960	1510720	the game the first day, like the big lines around the Capcom store for whenever a Monster
1510720	1512480	Hunter game comes out.
1512480	1513920	It's a different type of culture.
1513920	1520940	Like, you know, we may have a few, maybe a few people standing in line for a new system
1520940	1526740	release or for having like maybe one super special game, you know, like the Madden ones,
1526740	1530060	but it's nowhere near the crazy levels that it happens in Japan.
1530060	1531060	Right.
1531060	1535580	You know, and then like, for example, I mean, I keep bringing up my stupid Cardcaptor Sakura
1535580	1536580	Dreamcast game.
1536580	1541820	It had a pillow pillowcase and a clock and a fork and a spoon and a dish.
1541820	1542820	Yes.
1542820	1547900	But I mean, and there was, um, a Sakura Taisen game that came out in the same type of bundle,
1548420	1552860	but I mean, there's lots of crazy-ass special editions that come out and people like their packaging.
1552860	1556780	Akuma JP, like clockwork, shows up in chat when you said, we need somebody from Japan
1556780	1561780	to be listening, but he just turned the station on, uh, we're talking about the, um, uh, Microsoft
1561780	1564200	Xbox one DRM restrictions.
1564200	1568300	And I was just kind of wondering if Sony's going down that same route, how, how does
1568300	1570020	that impact Japanese gaming culture?
1570020	1572820	Are the Japanese going to be as willing to buy into some of these restrictions?
1572820	1575100	I still think there's going to be physical packaging.
1575100	1581480	There's still going to be copies you can buy and sell because there is, I mean, there's
1581480	1584780	a big part of the economy around that and there's a big part of the culture around that
1584780	1589640	as I mean, you even see like a few people over here who like to get their import special
1589640	1590640	editions and everything.
1590640	1591640	All right.
1591640	1592640	One more comment.
1592640	1593640	I want to get here from chat.
1593640	1595540	And then I do kind of want to move on with the show because we have a lot of news to
1595540	1598800	cover in this pre E3 week, and I know we're going to get back to this topic during phone
1598800	1599800	calls tonight.
1599800	1602620	Uh, but I want to get this comment here from Koopa kid.
1602620	1608140	He says, thankfully, Nintendo isn't smart enough with online to be, to even be able
1608140	1610260	to implement these types of features.
1610260	1613700	You know, this is something I've kind of referenced in past episodes on the show when we were
1613700	1618500	all worried about this is that could Nintendo end up as the, you know, they're the right
1618500	1622300	now they're the dog in the corner chasing its tail, looking a little silly and everybody's
1622300	1623740	like, what a weird dog.
1623740	1627040	But now all of a sudden it's like, it's, it's the most attractive puppy in the room and
1627040	1628860	everybody might want to adopt it.
1628860	1636180	How is, has Nintendo's failure to embrace online, which granted probably is what drove
1636180	1637180	EA.
1637180	1642360	Does that suddenly make them the most attractive option to Japanese gamers, to people like
1642360	1648060	me that feel like I'm, I'm now for the, I don't want all these Draconia measures.
1648060	1655620	Honestly I would, if, if they put an Xbox, actually as I've been calling it the X bone
1655620	1659720	in front of me versus a Wii U, given me money and said, pick one to buy.
1659720	1661740	You can, you can buy one.
1661740	1664680	I would go for the Wii U. End of story.
1664680	1667480	I don't even care if it's just a glorified Wii.
1667480	1671760	I would pick that over the X bone because well, let's face it, I already have an Xbox
1671760	1672760	360.
1672760	1675000	I already have all this other stuff I can play.
1675000	1680240	If I had to pick one, it'd be the Wii U because I wouldn't have to be limited.
1680240	1681240	Loki do you have a thought?
1681240	1683200	Cause then I'm going to ask Jamie a very tough question.
1683700	1688820	Um, no, I still don't want a Wii U and the other reason it goes back to what the original
1688820	1691980	reason why I don't want a Wii U cause there's nothing I want to play on it and I don't really
1691980	1693420	consider a next gen console.
1693420	1697780	I mean, honestly, the stuff you're going to see on the Wii U, especially coming out of
1697780	1702380	new games is stuff that's going to be ported to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation three already.
1702380	1706700	I don't need to buy another console for games I can play on my console that I already have.
1706700	1710260	Now the only advantage I see, and it's been kind of, I've been thinking about more cause
1710320	1715200	my wife has been really hogging the TV, is that off, off screen or the, uh, you know,
1715200	1719160	second screenplay stuff is kind of cool because I do want to play console games a lot of times
1719160	1720720	and my wife wants to watch TV.
1720720	1724320	So you know, that is the only positive, but once again, it's, I don't want to buy a new
1724320	1728200	console just for that because I have my laptop, I can play on my laptop if really willing
1728200	1729200	to.
1729200	1734640	So it's just, no one's holding a gun to my head to force me to buy a new console.
1734640	1735640	I don't have to.
1735640	1740380	So I, you know, really, you know, if that's the thought process that they're going in
1740380	1744020	with it saying, well, you know, that's why EA can get rid of, you know, their online
1744020	1747380	passes because hey, they've got to buy another console at some point.
1747380	1750540	No, I don't, I don't have to do anything.
1750540	1751540	That's the thing.
1751540	1753120	I don't have to follow what you want me to do.
1753120	1757740	And don't think for one second that no one's going to figure out a way to put some sort
1757740	1762760	of device in between your console and the internet to fucking spoof that authentication
1762760	1763760	server.
1763760	1764980	I kind of think that's what's going to happen too.
1764980	1766200	The gamers going to hack, right?
1766200	1767200	It's going to happen.
1767200	1768200	They will.
1768200	1769200	And this will be a focus.
1769200	1773480	YYR in chat says all these draconian restrictions aren't going to send most gamers to, aren't
1773480	1777700	going to send most gamers to Wii U, the Nintendo fans will already buy one and everyone else
1777700	1779660	will just not buy a console.
1779660	1783640	I think if anything, I think people will still buy one next gen console, even though they
1783640	1787400	hate everything because they're like, well, I got to play Killer Instinct or I got to
1787400	1788400	play whatever.
1788400	1792540	You know, I always try to gauge this if, you know, in trying to, in the years I've been
1792540	1797340	doing the show and the commentary and everything, I find that the best insight comes from non-gamers
1797340	1798500	truly.
1798500	1803460	If I want to really get a feel for where people, where, you know, the America's head is really
1803460	1807180	at, I'm not going to look for it on Twitter, sorry guys, I'm not going to look for it with
1807180	1811100	you because we're a very unique, you know, smaller sort of subset fan base.
1811100	1815300	And I look to general people, people that don't consider themselves gamers.
1815300	1819200	And you know, this week I was on a work trip in Phoenix and I was with a couple of coworkers
1819200	1821340	and the subject of video games came up just randomly.
1821340	1824340	I think, I think somebody had asked about my podcast and I was talking about it kind
1824340	1828700	of casually and he mentioned, yeah, oh yeah, I really like Assassin's Creed and yeah, I
1828700	1833540	heard about that Xbox one, but I heard it's not going to play any of the used stuff.
1833540	1834540	I don't think I want to get one.
1834540	1836380	It sounds like it's too restrictive.
1836380	1839500	And I'm kind of just thinking in the back of my head, I'm like, I wonder if there's
1839500	1843300	a lot of people that, you know, when they just kind of hear what a friend of a friend
1843300	1846760	says to them, they're going to run with that.
1846760	1848340	You know what I mean?
1848340	1849820	Gamers will buy the console.
1849820	1851540	There'll be something on it.
1851540	1853300	There's always going to be the people there.
1853300	1854860	There will be PlayStation fours that sell.
1854860	1856540	There will be Xbox ones that sell.
1856540	1859980	Will they sell more than Wii U?
1859980	1863620	You know, I don't know, you know, the best time to buy an Xbox one's going to be the
1863620	1867780	end of the generation when they do eventually shut down those authentication servers.
1867780	1873340	And let's assume that they go the, you know, steam route and they unlock it so that you
1873340	1876480	don't have to call in every 24 hours, you know, it just works.
1876480	1879880	Or they can be fucking dicks and say, well, fuck, no, your shit's going to work now.
1879880	1884160	So let me ask Jamie the difficult question, then we'll move into our gaming week.
1884160	1885160	Okay.
1885160	1886160	All right.
1886160	1887680	And I opened this up to the chatters as well.
1887680	1891960	For the 11 years this month that we've been doing orange launch radio, we've always had
1891960	1894540	a mantra on this show 11 years.
1894540	1898080	And we're actually having a show on June 23rd this year, which is the birthday.
1898080	1900840	So anyway, that's only what, like three weeks away.
1900840	1901840	Holy crap.
1901840	1902840	I'd lost count.
1902840	1903840	Our 11th birthday is coming up y'all.
1903840	1904840	Okay.
1905200	1908880	So for the 11 years on this program, we've had a mantra on this show about gaming.
1908880	1913880	And that is a system is only as good as the games that are on it, but Microsoft's about
1913880	1917920	to unveil 15 exclusives, which might include some of the things we've been clamoring for
1917920	1922280	for a long time, killer instinct, you know, perhaps that Banjo Kazooie thing.
1922280	1923280	I don't know.
1923280	1929400	I'm going to fanboy wank here, but now because of all these things that the system is doing,
1929400	1933600	I'm coming back to question, is that mantra still true?
1933600	1943160	I think we may have to evolve it.
1943160	1947880	Because we've got a system now that's doing things that systems didn't do in the past.
1947880	1953720	We have a new restriction being placed on how they're trying to change how the system
1953720	1955520	works.
1955520	1963640	And so with that, I believe I'm trying to think of how to phrase this.
1963640	1971200	I think that the games themselves should speak for themselves, but they have to be made accessible.
1971200	1976080	If you don't have access to the game, it does you no good.
1976080	1984280	If it's not going to give you a way to play the game, that's I hope I'm making it's a
1984280	1985280	tough question.
1985280	1990280	It's tough to phrase, but I just kind of feel like the golden rule of gaming may finally
1990280	1994400	have shown a blemish this week.
1994400	1999240	I think that to be able to appreciate the game being on the system, you have to have
1999240	2001760	a system that's going to allow you to enjoy it.
2001760	2002760	Does that make sense?
2002760	2003760	Sure.
2003760	2006900	So like for it has to work.
2006900	2010680	It has to like for the Nintendo, you put the cartridge in the system and you know, it's
2010680	2011680	going to work.
2011680	2014320	Even if you blow on the cartridge 100 times, you know, it has to just work right.
2014320	2016760	But now we're calling into question, is this really going to work?
2016760	2020800	I have to quote Queen Simia, sprinkles on a turd don't make it any more tasty.
2020800	2025260	Um, cause actually, actually that's pretty much how it is.
2025260	2029760	I think that, Oh God, it's hard for me to say.
2029760	2030760	Okay.
2030760	2035220	Let me, let me try this from clerical error 404 in chat, uh, at live.vognetwork.com clerical
2035220	2040160	error 404 says, I think the mantra needs to evolve in that it needs to have the games,
2040160	2044640	but also the versatility, the more games that are accessible by more people and potential
2044640	2045720	players.
2045720	2046720	Power to the players.
2046720	2047720	Right.
2047720	2048720	Agreed.
2048720	2054160	Uh, the evil G there, but here's, here's really where my thought is on this one.
2054160	2058960	And I hope this makes sense because I've been trying to, the thoughts clear in my head,
2058960	2062320	but it's kind of hard to bring into words.
2062320	2066000	A system is only as good as the games that are accessible on it.
2066000	2067000	Preach.
2067000	2068000	Okay.
2068000	2069900	But I'm using, I'm using example here.
2069900	2072140	Back in the day, like I'm going to use symphony of the night.
2072140	2073140	Okay.
2073140	2074140	For Saturn and for PlayStation.
2074140	2075700	Cause I've got them both.
2075700	2078220	I liked the Saturn version better.
2078220	2083360	It was accessible to me at the time because I could import it, but other people, but say
2083360	2088500	that I had no means of importing the game and all I had was a $20 copy that I bought
2088500	2092780	used at GameStop because you could buy the music GameStop, Ooh.
2092780	2096180	Well then I would say, well, of course I like the PlayStation version because I haven't
2096180	2097660	been able to play it on the Saturn.
2097660	2099900	I have no basis of comparison.
2099900	2107980	So say that you've got this system here that you don't want to invest in because of its
2107980	2109260	practices around the game.
2109260	2113420	Say the PS4 comes out and it's fully open and everything's nice and lovely and the same
2113420	2114420	games come out for it.
2114420	2117700	You're still going to go with the one that's more accessible to you because that's what
2117700	2118700	you have.
2118700	2121460	You have no basis of comparison saying X version is better.
2121460	2123820	Isn't necessarily fair because you can't compare it.
2123820	2127380	Is that the reason why I tend to buy games on the PlayStation three over the Xbox three
2127380	2131660	60 for the mere simple fact that I like the controller better?
2131660	2135980	Yeah, I mean that's really the same.
2135980	2136980	Not always.
2136980	2140060	Cause sometimes, sometimes, but then I go, if I want to play the game online with friends,
2140060	2143380	I go to the three 60 because it's got the better network.
2143380	2144380	Thank you.
2144380	2145380	Clerical error.
2145380	2146380	Four Oh four.
2146380	2147380	This is a set.
2147380	2150220	I learned as you for preferring the Saturn version just because I really like playing
2150220	2151220	as Maria.
2151220	2152220	Okay.
2152220	2153220	All right.
2153620	2160860	The whole point is, is that the games being good to play is also determined by the other
2160860	2163220	factors that go into actually playing the game itself.
2163220	2166700	Like for you, the controller, like for me, I love playing Saturn games because the dual
2166700	2173940	analog controller does not hurt my hand even to this day, but playing, um, like I'm better
2173940	2174940	with RPG.
2174940	2178500	Like I like playing RPGs better now because I get to move my hand.
2178500	2182940	I don't have to keep moving my thumb around and, you know, pulling up my, uh, my scar
2182940	2185620	on my hand, all the scar tissue I've got.
2185620	2191700	So it's really going to be a matter of how you play it as well as the content itself.
2191700	2196780	And if it's not allowing you to access that content, then why bother?
2196780	2197780	All right.
2197780	2198780	Well, it's a complicated issue.
2198780	2202020	Any, any quick last words, Loki, you want to get in before we move on here?
2202020	2207900	No, it's just, I just disappointed that the news came out now and not after, because I
2207940	2213060	wish I could be a little bit excited about what Microsoft showing, but you sound like
2213060	2217220	a tweet I made earlier this week that every year I'm so excited about E3 and like, Yay,
2217220	2218220	new games.
2218220	2219220	Yay.
2219220	2221820	This year I really have a sense of dread about E3 this year.
2221820	2224380	It's about how am I getting fucked over this year?
2224380	2230380	Like, and I'm sorry to sound like that jaded gamers hate everything.com guy, but I'm not
2230380	2231460	going to lie to you.
2231460	2235700	That's where I'm at right now, whether I'm overreacting or not.
2236700	2242340	No, it's a lot of money you're asking me to drop on a console where it's not even really
2242340	2246780	my console.
2246780	2250900	At some point I got to put my foot down and say, I love video games, but no, I'm done.
2250900	2254440	Here's another question too, is how is the, how are they even going to enable this with
2254440	2256780	like the first sale doctrine and stuff?
2256780	2261180	Cause you know, I, I just don't know if they're going to say, well, you're licensing stuff
2261180	2262180	from us now.
2262180	2264380	Well, I don't know if they're going to be able to.
2264460	2268500	I think that that could, you could, well, considering how Sue happy everything is, I
2268500	2272780	think we could very well see that this is going to be a lawsuit within a year or so.
2272780	2275140	I forgot to make my analogy, so I'll make it quick.
2275140	2276140	Oh, I thought you did.
2276140	2277140	No, I didn't.
2277140	2278540	I make a lot of crazy analogies.
2278540	2280420	There's one I was sitting on all week.
2280420	2282620	Who remembers Divx?
2282620	2283620	Oh my God.
2283620	2288340	And I'm not talking about the codec on your computer that lets you watch movies and things
2288340	2289340	like that.
2289340	2293060	I'm talking about when there was actually a Divx player at circuit city, but it always
2293060	2298380	had to be connected online because you could rent the movies at the store and the thing
2298380	2299740	ended up flopping.
2299740	2302100	Why did the Divx flop?
2302100	2303420	Because of all the restrictions on it.
2303420	2308100	There weren't any games on it or any, no, there weren't any, uh, movies for it.
2308100	2310940	Well, there was, there was the same movies that were on DVD and laser disc.
2310940	2314780	Well, for the people who don't know what Divx is, just think of the little mascot from penny
2314780	2315780	arcade.
2315780	2319580	They have that little Divx player character that that's a Divx machine.
2319580	2324180	And I'm sorry, but right now what I'm hearing at X-Box one sounds very Divx to me.
2324180	2332180	And I think people rejected Divx because they wanted to own their shit and they didn't want
2332180	2335980	to have to keep dialing this server that was daddy Steven Spielberg, who was a co-owner
2335980	2337580	in this daddy Steven Spielberg.
2337580	2342380	May I watch this movie?
2342380	2345340	People want to have control in the end.
2345340	2346340	Yeah.
2346340	2349100	Game guru and chat Divx, the disc player that killed circuit city.
2349100	2350100	Absolutely.
2350100	2352020	It brought down an entire chain with it.
2352020	2355980	Don't think that the Divx didn't have a lasting negative impact on circuit city.
2355980	2362500	Well, and also, also keep in mind there, um, I just completely lost my train of thought.
2362500	2368620	No, it was, um, the fact that you still have people today that even though we've got iTunes
2368620	2372120	and we have all this digital distribution, there's still people who like to physically
2372120	2376980	go out and buy a disc who will prefer to buy their music on CD.
2376980	2378940	There's quite a few people in chat agreeing with you.
2378940	2379940	Yes.
2379940	2380940	Yeah.
2380940	2382500	I mean, I'm not necessarily one of them, but anyway.
2382500	2383500	All right.
2383500	2385140	Lots of passion behind this topic.
2385140	2388620	I'm sure we'll hear more about it during our phone call segment later, as well as the mailbag
2388620	2391180	mailbag at orange launch radio.com.
2391180	2393180	It's going to be a very interesting answer it.
2393180	2394180	I'm kidding.
2394180	2396060	It's going to be a very interesting E3 week.
2396060	2397060	That's all I have to say.
2397060	2401340	I, I, I'm really looking forward to next week's show when Sony will have to put it out on
2401340	2403540	the table because they didn't cancel their media stuff.
2403540	2404540	Right.
2404540	2406120	So they're going to have to answer this question.
2406120	2409340	And finally, we'll have a clearer picture to what things are going to look like come
2409340	2410620	this fall.
2410620	2413960	In the meantime, quickly, guys, how was your gaming week?
2413960	2416720	We always start off the show, haha, with how was your gaming week?
2416720	2417720	Dark soccer.
2417720	2418720	Start?
2418720	2427520	Um, well, I, after my kind of poo pooing on Star Trek online, I saw there was a new expansion.
2427520	2431240	So I decided to give it a try again and it's actually fun.
2431240	2432960	The legacy of Romulus expansion.
2432960	2437560	I mean, I just started off a character, but I had a really good time doing it and I really
2437560	2442620	liked what it added to the, uh, as I'm calling it, the main timeline lore.
2442620	2443820	It was really good.
2443820	2449300	So I've actually been enjoying that and they kind of set the skill trees back to how they
2449300	2450640	used to be.
2450640	2452320	Not necessarily exactly the same.
2452320	2460240	And I kind of respect my Vice Admiral incorrectly, but still they, they did a lot of really cool
2460240	2461240	stuff.
2461320	2464560	Actually, I'll tell you what was funny because I was just running around on my Vice Admiral
2464560	2469200	because I have her pretty much, uh, permanently parked at a deep space nine.
2469200	2474000	They put Morin in Quark's bar and like as a big DS nine fan, that made me stupendously
2474000	2479760	happy and like it even had him like quote telling a story, even though he never talks,
2479760	2483320	it just sort of did a fade out and then shaking his head for Lornely and everything.
2483320	2484520	It was pretty funny.
2484520	2486280	Um, I did start Marvel heroes.
2486280	2487640	I do not care for it.
2487640	2493940	It reminded me a bit of playing, um, Marvel Ultimate Alliance without the fun part of
2493940	2496280	having other people to play with.
2496280	2497280	And the fact that...
2497280	2500400	Interesting because you're the first one I've heard say something negative about it.
2500400	2501880	I mean, everybody has their opinion.
2501880	2502880	I just, uh, interesting.
2502880	2506960	I'm not saying it wasn't fun and yeah, it's free to play, but if I wanted, but if I wanted
2506960	2513400	another character, I pretty much have to buy, um, 20 bucks worth of points for one character.
2513400	2518320	Or if I bought $40 worth of points, that would get me, you know, maybe three characters.
2518320	2522400	And the one that I really wanted to play, she had a Sprite for it, but she wasn't accessible
2522400	2529240	to buy because as I've made no, uh, no secret of this, my favorite Marvel character is Jessica
2529240	2530240	Jones because she's bad-ass.
2530240	2534940	Um, so anyway, I played through the whole first mission as Scarlet Witch and it was
2534940	2541360	just like a not quite as fun version of Marvel Ultimate Alliance and I would rather play
2541360	2543160	Marvel Ultimate Alliance.
2543160	2544160	I'm going to check.
2544160	2545640	I want to check out this Marvel Heroes game.
2545640	2550280	I just, I was busy this past week, so I didn't get a chance to check it out, but I want to...
2550280	2551280	It wasn't bad.
2551280	2556240	I'm going to say it wasn't bad, but it wasn't enough to make me want to spend any amount
2556240	2557240	of money on it.
2557240	2559320	I mean, I might play it a little bit more.
2559320	2560400	I've got Scarlet Witch.
2560400	2561400	She's pretty cool.
2561400	2565160	I almost picked Hawkeye because, you know, Hawkeye, but I went for her.
2565160	2566800	You just wanted to stare at his booty.
2566800	2568500	No, I'm, you know what?
2568500	2569760	That's objectification, Robin.
2569760	2571760	I take exception to that.
2571760	2574960	Um, but, uh, it was all right.
2574960	2575960	It was all right.
2575960	2579280	And as a male, I am totally okay with the objectification of Hawkeye.
2579280	2580280	Just saying.
2580280	2582200	Well, if it's Jeremy Renner, then yeah.
2582200	2588400	Um, no, but at any rate, um, I also, I, as I have said, I am back to play Mass Effect,
2588400	2589960	the first one.
2589960	2592480	Um, Dramamine does not work, Rob.
2592480	2597060	And I will tell you why I actually had Dramamine is because I got it from my trip to Alabama
2597060	2600560	and I decided to take Dramamine for my first Mako mission.
2600560	2601560	And it did not help.
2601560	2605400	I was nauseous in five seconds.
2605400	2609200	And then, um, yes, Claire, Claire, it's because it's Jeremy Renner.
2609200	2618840	I think he's pretty, um, and intelligent, and intelligent, um, but, uh, uh, what was
2618840	2619840	I saying?
2619840	2620840	Oh yeah.
2620840	2623360	Um, so I actually, uh, I have a high res mod.
2623360	2629040	Well, it's really, you have to sort of manually mod your INI files yourself and then use text
2629040	2631860	mod for the high resolution textures.
2631860	2637960	And I figured out that why my game kept shutting down is because it didn't have, um, uh, there's
2637960	2643800	like a little program you can run to make it accept, um, higher, uh, memory usage, which
2643800	2648000	I mean, I've got a card that, you know, gives me two extra gig of VRAM, so I don't know
2648000	2656400	what's going on, but I ended up, uh, getting that working and, uh, it was, uh, it was pretty
2656400	2657400	good.
2657400	2662000	And I actually, I can tell you this, that I don't get as sick as I did with some of
2662000	2664080	the higher res textures.
2664080	2669160	So I'm pretty much just running through the game and trying to get all the stuff I missed.
2669160	2672740	I'm actually also doing a different background than what I used to do because I always used
2672740	2678760	to do either a colonist or a spacer, but I would always do soul survivor and now I'm
2678760	2682780	doing a war hero, which is, it kind of changes up a few things, you know, you don't have
2682780	2688540	to deal with the hyperventilating, uh, slave girl and you'd still deal with a major asshole.
2688540	2691020	I'm sorry, Admiral asshole.
2691020	2695660	Um, the only thing I do, and I will give this as a flat warning for anyone who uses the
2695660	2701220	texture replacement is it does mess up anyone wearing the dress blues because it will change
2701220	2704420	a texture to white and the hands to white, which is really bizarre.
2704420	2706700	But other than that, it's, it's super nice.
2706700	2708900	Everything looks beautiful.
2708900	2714640	And um, God, I was playing something else too, and I don't remember what it was.
2714640	2716060	I don't remember what it was.
2716060	2717340	We'll come back to you if you think of it.
2717340	2720100	Oh, Dan is really irritated with grid two.
2720100	2721100	Why?
2721100	2724740	Because he says that it does, that the collision detection in that game is just really shit.
2724740	2725740	I haven't played it.
2725740	2727140	Well, you know, he has that driving.
2727140	2729020	Oh no, I know he loves his driving rig.
2729020	2730660	He's he's a, he's a manly man.
2730660	2731660	Yeah.
2731660	2732660	All right.
2732660	2733660	Loki, how was your gaming week?
2733660	2737580	Uh, unfortunately I did not play, I don't think anything actually.
2737580	2743820	Uh, I, yeah, it's just, uh, the boss has been out all week, so they haven't played any
2743820	2747660	Call of Duty and uh, I didn't really play anything in the video.
2747660	2751060	I was working on my laptop for most of the week and then my laptop broke, so then I had
2751060	2752060	to fix my laptop.
2752060	2753300	So I've been busy with that.
2753300	2758380	So um, yeah, I did buy the, uh, the serious Sam bundle thing that they have on the humble
2758380	2759380	bundle weekly thing.
2759380	2760540	So that was kind of cool.
2760540	2767180	So we'll play some of that soon and um, just watch the Watch Dogs trailer for E3, the E3
2767180	2768180	trailer.
2768180	2769180	It looks fantastic.
2769180	2770180	I can't wait for that game.
2770180	2771180	Hmm.
2771180	2772180	So that just released tonight?
2772180	2773180	Uh, it leaked out.
2773180	2774180	Yeah.
2774180	2775180	Nice.
2775180	2776180	All right.
2776180	2777180	Anything else?
2777180	2778180	Uh, that is it.
2778180	2780180	Uh, I'm only really going to talk about one new game.
2780180	2784500	Uh, I, uh, was in Phoenix for a lot of the week for the day job, so that kind of kept
2784500	2789420	me away from most of my games besides iPad and portable games I've talked a lot about
2789420	2790420	on the show.
2790420	2794820	My random game to play on the airplane, thank heavens for the Game Boy Advance games and
2794820	2800900	the NES games and all that on the 3DS for the early adopters, Mario Kart Game Boy Advance.
2800900	2804860	I don't know why it actually is one of the weaker Mario Kart games, just control wise
2804860	2808860	and everything, but, uh, I just, just, I was like, I want to unlock the special cup.
2808860	2809860	So I did it.
2809860	2813820	Anyway, uh, the real game I've been playing a bit of at least the past couple of days
2813820	2816020	is Animal Crossing New Leaf.
2816020	2819580	It's the 3D version of Animal Crossing that just came out.
2819580	2821580	Um, what can I say?
2821580	2823020	It's Animal Crossing.
2823060	2826540	Some of the differences though, uh, I noticed that they put a lot of the stores that used
2826540	2831420	to be sprinkled throughout your town, not really the mall thing like the Wii did, but
2831420	2836060	there's a other side of the tracks now, like a main street where all the, like the nooks,
2836060	2841820	the Abel sisters, the, uh, Tom Nook, who's the, now the realtor, cause he gave the convenience
2841820	2845820	store to his kids and, uh, some other stuff is, uh, all that stuff's on the other side
2845820	2846820	of the tracks.
2846820	2847820	The museums there too.
2847820	2851060	So it's kind of neat to have kind of everything in that one place that really opens up your
2851100	2854700	town to have a little bit more of your design when it comes to the trees and the flowers
2854700	2855700	and all that.
2855700	2860380	Um, all the online experience is pretty much similar to what I noticed in the previous
2860380	2861380	games.
2861380	2863300	You open up your train gates and people can come visit.
2863300	2866020	In fact, I should open mine up and see if anyone comes to visit.
2866020	2869900	Uh, and then you can, uh, close them when you're ready for people to get out.
2869900	2872380	Uh, so a lot of that hasn't changed.
2872380	2877340	Um, but I know they brought the island back and there's a lot more fruits available thanks
2877340	2878340	to the island.
2878340	2882940	Um, some of the other things I noticed is that the story is a lot different because
2882940	2883940	now you're the mayor.
2883940	2888820	Uh, so you have an assistant, Isabella, who kind of helps you, or I'm assuming everybody
2888820	2889820	has the same one.
2889820	2890820	I don't even know.
2890820	2893780	Uh, but she kind of helps you through some of the earlier stages of the game.
2893780	2898320	And yes, it is still about paying off bell debt, but you know, animal crossing kind of
2898320	2900120	still remains that game.
2900120	2903520	It's kind of like the Facebook game that you don't have to have a lot of deep shame to
2903520	2907540	play cause you know, it doesn't have all that like click to invite all your friends.
2907540	2911780	But um, it's just kind of fun to grow your little neighborhood and interact with the
2911780	2912780	people.
2912780	2916180	And then the online element, uh, provides a lot of fun with that.
2916180	2921320	And it's 35 bucks since it's a handheld game, not 60 like a lot of console games cost.
2921320	2923220	So I think that's priced pretty good.
2923220	2927180	Sometimes you just want to do a little bit of fishing, donate it to the museum, make
2927180	2928180	some bells.
2928180	2931460	It seems like a lot of people I know are getting animal crossing and that's, I think the real
2931460	2936540	fun in it is just, you know, trading the fruits and writing nasty letters to somebody else's
2936540	2940940	villagers and hoping they don't get too mad at what you're saying and all that.
2940940	2944860	So, um, yeah, I'm happy with my purchase of animal crossing, but, uh, I think most people
2944860	2946820	kind of know already what to expect with this.
2946820	2949740	Don't expect like a, a total reinvention of the franchise.
2949740	2954340	Um, but I wouldn't say it's as simple as, Ooh, now you can sit on a bench too.
2954340	2955580	There's a little more to it than that.
2955580	2957580	They, they did a little more design with it.
2957580	2962280	Um, it feels like a different game, especially if you put like the original GameCube game
2962280	2963540	next to this game.
2963540	2966740	You can really see how this series has evolved.
2966740	2967740	All right.
2967740	2972140	Uh, anyhow, let's get into a quick housekeeping.
2972140	2979020	Um, I mentioned this earlier in the show, but do keep an eye on this week, e3.vognetwork.com.
2979020	2982340	It is our interactive E3 experience at the voice of geeks network.
2982340	2987900	That's going to be led by a VOG networks, Bobby Black Wolf, who will be on the, uh,
2987900	2990140	the show floor at E3.
2990140	2994920	And he will be getting answers to your questions because once Bobby's, you know, done these
2994920	2999660	appointments and played some of the games, he wants to see what you guys want to hear
2999660	3000660	about.
3000660	3004660	But, uh, you know, all we ask, don't ask the obvious things that are already in the press
3004660	3010940	releases and don't ask about this stinking Xbox used game thing because, you know, we
3010940	3015380	all know they're not going to comment further on it, but you know, maybe there's a game
3015380	3020420	that you're not hearing enough about because all this new gen stuff is hogging the spotlight.
3020420	3022340	Maybe there's something else you want to hear more about.
3022340	3027540	You have a question about, maybe you're a very passionate fan of, I don't know, tech
3027540	3030660	in and you want to hear more information about to, although I don't think Namco Bandai has
3030660	3031660	a booth.
3031660	3035020	I don't remember, but you know, whatever it is, you want to hear more about it.
3035020	3039460	Uh, go take a look at e3.vognetwork.com and has all the information you need.
3039460	3043540	Question submissions open up after the Sony press conference tomorrow when we're really
3043540	3045660	going to know where things stand.
3045660	3046660	Okay.
3046660	3050420	Um, we'll hear from Bobby Black Wolf on that a little more later because we are going to
3050420	3051980	have a list list later tonight.
3051980	3057300	Uh, the thing we most want to see happen at e3 2013 that'll be in part B later in the
3057300	3058300	show.
3058300	3061820	But first let's run through through some gaming news and Loki start us off.
3061820	3062820	All right.
3062820	3067220	So there is a rumor going around that, um, GameStop is discontinuing the Wii U basic
3067220	3070220	after June 18th.
3070220	3076500	And um, basically, you know, the rumor comes from that they've been getting it like there's
3076500	3081220	an internal email saying that they're going to be, um, sending back all the, you know,
3081220	3083520	basic units and that kind of stuff.
3083520	3089200	Also um, Nintendo's followed up with this saying that there's current, a current misperception
3089200	3093660	about the Wii U hardware to clarify Nintendo is working with its retail partners to simply
3093660	3099700	rebalance the stock of white eight gigabyte systems and black 32 gigabyte Wii U models
3099700	3100700	in the market.
3100700	3103540	Consumers looking for either model will continue to find them available.
3103540	3105940	It doesn't make any sense to me, but okay.
3105940	3112240	Um, then of course there's a follow up to that where, um, another retailer was saying
3112240	3117780	that they received an email, um, that they're going to be recalling all the eight gigabyte
3117780	3118780	systems.
3118780	3123540	I think if anything, this has to do with the fact that they're talking about, um, putting
3123540	3128100	out a white, you know, um, made three, two gigabyte system.
3128100	3131380	I'm wondering if they're just going to get rid of the eight gigabyte system altogether
3131380	3133900	because maybe that's not as popular.
3133900	3139220	Um, I know a lot of people that buy Wii U's at least, you know, as far as my customers
3139220	3140900	are concerned, not a lot of them.
3140900	3142300	Who's buying the basics?
3142300	3143300	Not a lot of people.
3143300	3144580	They want the pack in game.
3144580	3146460	They want the stuff that comes with the deluxe.
3146460	3149660	I wouldn't be, I wouldn't blame Nintendo at all if they're phasing the basics out of the
3149660	3150660	market.
3150660	3156540	And I think if the 18, the 18th coincides well with, you know, being after E3, so maybe
3156540	3158920	we'll get an announcement and that's my fingers.
3158920	3162220	My re my real hope is that they're getting rid of the basics because they're going to
3162220	3166260	drop the price of the deluxe is down to where the basics are.
3166260	3171260	That would be phenomenal news and what a great opportunity for Nintendo to kick their competition
3171260	3177100	in the balls while all this other talk about, you know, the usage restrictions and all this
3177100	3179180	is going on.
3179180	3183100	Nintendo could really strike them in the jugular and you might still hate everything that Nintendo
3183100	3186620	has to offer, but you got to recognize that there's going to be a lot of people that are
3186620	3191140	here for Mario Kart and, and Mario and all this wouldn't be that hard for them to refurbish
3191140	3195780	all those old systems to pop that eight gigabyte storage chip off there and put three gigabyte
3195780	3196900	chip there in place.
3196900	3197900	Yeah.
3197900	3198900	So it wouldn't be that hard.
3198900	3203340	Some could very well could happen.
3203340	3206940	Alan alchemy in our chat room at live.vog network.com says eight gigabytes is just an
3206940	3212260	embarrassingly insufficient amount of memory by today's standards, period budget console
3212260	3214100	or no.
3214100	3215100	That's very true.
3215100	3216220	It's not a lot.
3216220	3221700	So Nintendo has got to catch up, but don't catch up too much to what else is going on
3221700	3222700	in the world.
3222700	3228820	Uh, moving on to other news out of E3, uh, Square Enix mentioning what they're going
3228820	3231420	to be showing at their E3 booth.
3231420	3235460	Sometimes things get left off of this, but, uh, you know, I'll, I'll, uh, say what there
3235460	3236460	is so far.
3236460	3242620	Kingdom hearts, 1.5 remix on PlayStation three final fantasy 14, a realm reborn, uh, which
3242620	3243620	makes sense.
3243620	3246900	Cause I believe beta three starts next week comes out in August.
3246900	3247900	Yeah.
3247900	3248900	So they're, they're counting down there.
3248900	3250820	They've also changed restrictions on the beta stuff.
3250820	3251820	Yes.
3251820	3252820	NDA is lifted.
3252820	3256900	So, but still no, um, you're not allowed to say anything on the previous betas.
3256900	3257900	Okay.
3257900	3262520	Well, all I got to tell you is next OLR, no live streaming next OLR.
3262520	3263520	We got a lot to say.
3263560	3268880	Realm reborn, uh, lightning returns final fantasy 13 being shown off, which I believe
3268880	3272960	also a release date got spotted on a banner and it's February 14.
3272960	3273960	Yeah.
3273960	3279000	Uh, final fantasy 10 and 10, two HD remaster for the Vita and PlayStation three deus X
3279000	3283520	human revolution director's cut for Wii U and thief.
3283520	3285560	Another big title on its way.
3285560	3290080	Now, um, there are rumors that there could be something additional there as well.
3290080	3297240	Apparently the future of final fantasy being teased for Tuesday, June 11th, nine AM, uh,
3297240	3303720	rumors and rumblings suggesting it's final fantasy 15, uh, whether that is what 13 verses
3303720	3309600	has been put through a remodel and that's now 15 or maybe this news is just 13 verses.
3309600	3313360	No, it's going to be something new for the PlayStation four and the, probably the Xbox
3313360	3317240	one, because remember the PlayStation four of it, they showed the same fucking trailer
3317240	3322540	that they had before and they're like, and we'll have more to announce that E3, you know,
3322540	3325440	so it's, it's going to be something new for next gen.
3325440	3327760	It's probably going to be using their new engine that they have.
3327760	3328760	It is sad to me though.
3328760	3332360	The dragon quest 10 just probably isn't going to happen over here, is it?
3332360	3336280	I was kind of hoping that maybe they would announce Saturday three, but that maybe they
3336280	3337760	were just going to solely back Wii U.
3337760	3344320	I really wish they would try with dragon quest 10, but let's try the dragon quest series
3344320	3345680	does have a following.
3345680	3346680	It sure does.
3346680	3351440	And sure, the following is bigger in Japan, but to write it off here, I don't know.
3351440	3353200	Maybe dragon quest nine didn't sell well enough.
3353200	3357920	I also remember they had dragon quests, uh, monsters or whatever that are the one that
3357920	3358920	they came out over here.
3358920	3359920	That was the Wii game.
3359920	3365480	That was first person that did not do well, so all right, moving on.
3365480	3366480	Quest swords.
3366480	3367480	That's what it was.
3367480	3368480	Yeah.
3368480	3369480	Well this, this is purely rumor.
3369480	3370480	Okay.
3370480	3371480	So I'm just going to go ahead and spit it out there.
3371480	3372920	Allegedly stuff.
3373440	3379780	Um, there is a rumor going around that Microsoft has been paying off, uh, third party developers
3379780	3386320	not to show off anything for PlayStation four either on stage or at their booths that Microsoft
3386320	3389480	has resorted to paying them off for this.
3389480	3394760	Now I don't know if this is true or not, but the, um, the report came from a source on
3394760	3399800	Neogaf that's done a lot of true.
3399800	3402400	Here is your nice big salt lick.
3402400	3403400	Exactly.
3403400	3404400	To go with this.
3404400	3405400	Exactly.
3405400	3410360	But it did come from someone who in the past has been reliable.
3410360	3417840	Well this now, this would put way in the column of maybe Sony isn't in the same camp as Microsoft
3417840	3421720	because otherwise it's, what are you so afraid of Microsoft?
3421720	3427080	Well, the whole point is that the theory is that if this is really what's going on, the
3427080	3429520	Microsoft is trying to give the illusion that they're going to have more games available
3429520	3431080	than the PS4 will.
3431640	3432960	Which would make them look more attractive.
3432960	3437440	And it's not that Microsoft and Sony haven't bought, you know, struck at each other financially
3437440	3438440	before.
3438440	3441520	I mean, what, uh, Microsoft got a lot of DLC agreements.
3441520	3445880	Uh, Sony got the whole, uh, valve tie in portal.
3445880	3449120	Like everybody bought portal two on PlayStation three because everything, well, not everybody,
3449120	3453720	but a lot of people did because of, you know, their agreements with valve and steam integration,
3453720	3454720	which was really good.
3454720	3455720	I got mine on steam.
3455720	3456720	Yeah.
3456720	3457720	Well, you got, you bought it.
3457720	3458720	It was a gift, but still.
3458720	3459720	Well, you bought it on PS3 and you got it on both.
3459720	3460720	No, I didn't.
3461360	3464080	You did, but I mean, I didn't care about it on PS3 at all.
3464080	3467000	I got it on, on windows.
3467000	3470880	So paying for exclusives and paying off for stuff like that, that's not really, but it's
3470880	3474640	just in light of everything else going on in the gaming industry is what makes a lot
3474640	3481440	of people kind of leech onto this news is, Ooh, yeah, well, and it could just be something
3481440	3487100	that was thrown out there for the purpose of, uh, you know, making Microsoft look bad
3487100	3488100	too.
3488100	3494460	But at the same time, they don't need a Neo GAF thread to do that.
3494460	3500100	I don't know that at this point that I would put anything past, past them right now, especially
3500100	3503620	since this type of shit goes on all the time in the corporate world.
3503620	3508060	So saying, but isn't it weird how Microsoft and Sony would have had to agree to this thing.
3508060	3511020	And then now they strike at each other in corporate warfare and these other ways.
3511020	3515140	It's really, it's kind of sick in some ways.
3515140	3516580	Welcome to corporate America.
3516580	3519580	Well, welcome to the world corporation.
3519580	3525740	I know, I know, I know, but I'm saying it's business and in the end what people, what
3525740	3529740	companies most care about is their bottom line and they will do what they can to increase
3529740	3530740	it.
3530740	3531740	End of story.
3531740	3532740	Loki.
3532740	3533740	All right.
3533740	3538600	Um, so let's see, let's talk a little bit about plants versus zombies.
3538600	3543280	And um, you may remember they had an announcement for plants versus zombies too.
3543280	3544280	It's about time.
3544420	3549520	Well now there's some actual, uh, banners being spotted at E3 showing plants versus
3549520	3551760	zombies garden warfare.
3551760	3553040	I am excited.
3553040	3556360	Which is, um, rumors to be true.
3556360	3560480	I think they were saying that it's a multiplayer first person shooter game.
3560480	3564920	So I am no longer excited.
3564920	3567560	Well, there's still the plants versus zombies too.
3567560	3569000	I'm excited about that.
3569000	3570000	The first person shooter?
3570000	3571000	No.
3571000	3572000	Yeah.
3572000	3577160	I remember, I remember actually hearing about that before, so it'll be interesting to see
3577160	3578320	what that's like.
3578320	3582480	I'm thinking maybe a little bit like that Batman, um, what was it?
3582480	3592280	The uh, the uh, Batman game that they had on the Xbox live arcade, uh, Gotham imposter
3592280	3597120	or yeah, that one, Oh, the Gotham kids or something like that.
3597120	3598120	I don't like it.
3598120	3599120	Yeah.
3599120	3601120	It's like, uh, somebody in chattel yell it out.
3601120	3602120	I don't remember.
3602120	3603120	Anyways.
3603120	3605440	Um, Oh, neat.
3605440	3611840	I guess we'll have to, you know, hear about it on, uh, during E3 or EA's press conference.
3611840	3613380	I guess they're going to have that on Monday.
3613380	3616240	So I'm watching all of those.
3616240	3617240	That'd be fantastic.
3617240	3618240	And yeah, me too.
3618240	3620200	You want to hear something kind of funny off topic here a little bit.
3620200	3623040	Um, I was looking on new gap just a second here.
3623040	3627120	Um, they put out a reminder that there was this thing that leaked last year.
3627120	3629360	Remember about their kind of a game plan.
3629360	3630360	Yeah.
3630400	3637120	And, uh, the, the actual marketing position that they had on, uh, their, you know, for
3637120	3640600	2013 is this one box input one.
3640600	3645320	So that, that's the same slogan that they have at E3 now.
3645320	3649080	So playing a little bit more to maybe that was legitimate.
3649080	3650080	Yeah.
3650080	3651080	Huh?
3651080	3654680	It's always nice when those rumors end up being true a year after the fact, right.
3654680	3659280	In retrospect, Oh, we could have known all along if we would just believe this one rumor.
3659520	3661720	Well, it still shows through 2015.
3661720	3665320	So, you know, I guess we'll have to see, you know, what that's all about.
3665320	3668520	Uh, Akuma JP in our chat room with a very interesting comparison.
3668520	3672680	We were talking earlier, the whole corporate warfare with, um, Sony and Microsoft Akuma
3672680	3676800	JP in our chat says, look at Apple and Samsung.
3676800	3681040	That's another good comparison because those two, they have to work together for some things,
3681040	3685200	but then they're at each other's throats with courts and lawsuits and everything.
3685200	3687520	It's, um, fascinating how that all works.
3687520	3688520	Okay.
3688560	3693440	Here's if, if that member of that whole thing, uh, the, you know, PDF that came out last
3693440	3694440	year.
3694440	3701080	So here's what the next game plan then would be for to Zilla glasses, digital glasses that
3701080	3704200	allow you to see 3d objects in your living room.
3704200	3705920	That's augmented reality stuff.
3705920	3710920	So that's going to be next year, apparently according to the roadmap.
3710920	3712200	What about the alumina room?
3712200	3714760	When's that supposed to be a thing next year too, I think.
3714760	3715760	Hmm.
3715760	3716760	Hmm.
3716760	3717760	Interesting.
3718000	3719000	All right.
3719000	3722640	Um, moving on, I talked earlier in the show about animal crossing and I know one reason
3722640	3725480	everybody loved the game cube version of animal crossing.
3725480	3730160	And some people arguably say it's their favorite is because it had all the classic NES games
3730160	3731160	in it.
3731160	3735480	Remember how you could play punch out and clue clue land and all these Nintendo games
3735480	3736480	in animal crossing.
3736480	3742880	Well, this will probably be a bit of a duh, but in an interview with the Katsuya Eguchi,
3742880	3747920	um, he basically, and this is an interview, uh, that he had out there, he said that please
3747920	3752800	consider it's not happening ever again in regards to virtual console at the time of
3752800	3756800	animal crossing on the game cube, we didn't have a virtual console system.
3756800	3760720	We thought the playing games inside of a game is kind of funny and we wanted to do it, but
3760720	3763840	now there's a virtual console where you can play classic games.
3763840	3766360	So we don't think we'll be doing that in future titles.
3766360	3770600	So kind of confirmation that, yeah, they're not going to bring those NES games back in
3770600	3774200	the other systems and it's really virtual console's fault because they can make money
3774200	3775800	selling those games separately.
3775800	3779320	However, part of the reason I want to bring this up is because when I was reading this
3779320	3785040	article on destructoid.com who ran with this article, I really liked an idea that was proposed.
3785040	3788760	Now I wanted to kind of put this out there by the author of destructoid.com who said,
3788760	3793000	uh, there's more that could be done to appease those looking for retro flavor in a new animal
3793000	3794340	crossing adventure.
3794340	3799720	A nice compromise would be to include some special eight bit animal crossing themed games
3799720	3801400	in the next entry of the series.
3801400	3806120	Um, in the game cube title, tortimer might give you a fake NES game called super tortimer
3806120	3807680	on April 1st.
3807680	3811760	What if super tortimer were playable, a little 10 minute long platformer starring a turtle
3811760	3817000	mayor and maybe a few other fake but fun lo-fi NES on animal crossing mini games.
3817000	3818480	And I'm like, I love that idea.
3818480	3821020	That's a fantastic, fantastic idea.
3821020	3824640	Like what, you know, just silly little flash games to be collectible.
3824640	3827520	I think that would be a great thing for the series granted, you know, it's going to be
3827520	3832060	a lot of development costs and somebody's got to design all that design as a contest.
3832060	3833360	You have a bunch of indie dev.
3833360	3835460	I was just a crowdsource the fucker.
3835460	3840320	You just have a bunch of indie devs just creating a bit shit for it and you could even market
3840320	3842600	that as a reason to buy the game, but I don't know.
3842600	3846040	I just don't see Nintendo as somebody who would, uh, crowdsource like that.
3846040	3847040	You know what I mean?
3847040	3849480	But yeah, that would be awesome.
3849480	3850480	Too bad.
3850480	3853840	Oh, you know, Nintendo, if you're thinking about that Wii U version of animal crossing,
3853840	3857480	here's a, Oh, Oh, this could, this could really bring a lot of people back.
3858320	3863760	Or just, you know, maybe just give us, you know, those NES games.
3863760	3868960	Cause come on, you've already made your money back and then like, who the fuck's going to
3868960	3870360	buy clue clue land.
3870360	3871360	Let's be real.
3871360	3872360	It wasn't that good.
3872360	3874880	Donkey Kong math or who's going to buy that shit.
3874880	3876280	Come on.
3876280	3880320	Um, what you would buy donkey Kong math.
3880320	3885320	No, but I have picked up a copy of clue clue land when I saw it at the store.
3885320	3886320	You're a nerd though.
3886320	3887320	Shut up.
3887320	3888320	I have memories of clue clue land.
3888320	3889320	Don't, don't judge me.
3889320	3893320	Uh, while I are in chat says, but I do have to buy a third party hack this to unlock them
3893320	3894320	all this time.
3894320	3895320	Um, yeah.
3895320	3899320	Cause remember super Mario brothers and Zelda were in the original animal crossing, but
3899320	3901320	you couldn't get them without a code.
3901320	3903320	Like they were never actually given out.
3903320	3909320	You had to get, you had to code them to do it, uh, or, or use the link from Hyrule website
3909320	3912320	that was big back in the day where everybody had the same character name.
3912320	3914320	So you could just gift yourself all this stuff.
3914320	3915320	Pretty funny.
3915320	3918320	Um, what else do I want to say with that?
3918320	3922320	Uh, Oh, here's one other thing I would say is that if they do these whole like little
3922320	3927320	flash games that they put inside animal crossing, they could almost one up virtual console.
3927320	3933320	And like, how about little achievements within animal crossing and leaderboards within animal
3933320	3934320	crossing.
3934320	3939320	Suddenly animal crossing is what we all thought PlayStation home was going to be.
3940320	3941320	Think about it.
3941320	3942320	Womp, womp.
3942320	3943320	All right.
3943320	3944320	Anyway.
3944320	3950320	Well, how about, uh, something that's a little bit happier, Rob?
3950320	3951320	Okay.
3951320	3954320	Um, how about something that has nothing to do with Nintendo?
3954320	3957320	I don't know if that's going to be happier this week.
3957320	3961320	Nintendo is kind of my, my safe room.
3961320	3963320	Nintendo is my safe word this week.
3963320	3968320	Remember if it gets a little bit too hard for you, just say PlayStation.
3968320	3977320	Uh, this actually has to do with, um, an exclusive for PS3 that will be, uh, launching on Tuesday.
3977320	3979320	Tekken revolution is going to be on PS3.
3979320	3981320	It will be free to play.
3981320	3985320	And you know, me and my Tekken, I worked for Namco.
3985320	3989320	I remember Tekken three and trying to predict who the next character would be.
3989320	3990320	So I have to say that.
3990320	3992320	And trying to predict who the next character would be.
3992320	3996320	So I have special, special love of, of anything Tekken.
3996320	3999320	Especially anything that has a Jin Kazama in it.
3999320	4001320	Yeah, but isn't this just going to be the dumb trading card game?
4001320	4002320	You know what?
4002320	4008320	It says, um, that, uh, basically it's going to be, I'm trying to see what it says.
4008320	4011320	It's going to be, uh, yes.
4011320	4017320	Being, um, referred to as a new version of Tekken card tournament, which you know, it's funny.
4017320	4020320	I even had the stupid Tekken card game on the wondrous one.
4020320	4023320	So I will go to links to play anything Tekken.
4023320	4025320	So I'm just saying, don't judge me.
4025320	4026320	At least this one's free.
4026320	4028320	Yeah. I like free.
4028320	4030320	Who doesn't?
4030320	4031320	Especially cause I'm broke.
4031320	4034320	Well, if you hate free and you want to buy something this week.
4034320	4035320	Get the X bone.
4035320	4039320	If you hate freedom, buy an Xbox one.
4039320	4043320	No, uh, seriously, what is coming out this week around the world?
4043320	4044320	US first Loki.
4044320	4045320	Nothing really.
4045320	4048320	Um, well one game, the last of us on Friday.
4048320	4049320	On Friday.
4049320	4051320	Arguably a big fucking game.
4051320	4054320	Yeah. Great reviews, but Friday?
4054320	4055320	What?
4055320	4058320	Well, you know, got to get down on Friday.
4058320	4060320	I guess, you know, they want to make sure.
4060320	4062320	Got to get down to Disneyland.
4062320	4067320	Want to make sure that it isn't released on Tuesday with all that, you know, E3 news getting, you know, lost in the shuffle there.
4067320	4068320	So, all right.
4068320	4071320	Well, traveling to Japan and seeing if there's anything additional this week.
4072320	4074320	Um, not so much on the PlayStation 3.
4074320	4076320	PlayStation 3 is looking pretty empty this week.
4076320	4077320	Xbox 360.
4077320	4078320	You'd be surprised.
4078320	4080320	There is a game on Xbox 360 this week.
4080320	4084320	It's called Giga Force and Esketos Wonder Pack.
4084320	4087320	I don't know if that's just like the combination, like a combination two for one thing.
4087320	4089320	Yeah, it is definitely a two for one pack.
4089320	4090320	I'm looking at the box art.
4090320	4093320	These look to be 3D spacey shooter games.
4093320	4095320	Like, uh, mechs.
4095320	4097320	Oh, it's, is this?
4097320	4099320	Oh, it's got classic games in there too.
4099320	4100320	I see.
4100320	4102320	Judgment, Silver Sword, Cardinal Sins.
4102320	4107320	If you're a SHMUP fan, this might be the compilation for you.
4107320	4109320	That is out on the Xbox 360 this week.
4109320	4113320	Is it just me or does Xbox 360 get so many SHMUPs over in Japan?
4113320	4115320	Like, it's the SHMUP console.
4115320	4116320	Oh, that's good to know.
4116320	4120320	Yeah, but especially, uh, bullet hell games?
4120320	4121320	Please.
4123320	4124320	Uh, looking at the other systems.
4124320	4126320	Sadly, not a lot this week.
4126320	4129320	3DS is really the only other thing that's seeing some releases.
4129320	4132320	Donkey Kong Returns makes its way to Japan this week.
4132320	4136320	And, uh, there's a Nintendo metallic red 3DS to match.
4136320	4139320	Also, one other game from Square Enix this week.
4139320	4144320	Chusoku Henkai Gyro Zetter, Albatross no Tsubasa comes out this week.
4144320	4145320	And this is...
4145320	4147320	Wings of the Albatross?
4147320	4152320	Yes, it looks like another mech fighting game slash role playing game type thing.
4152320	4158320	Aren't Albatrosses usually associated with bad modical things?
4158320	4162320	Maybe they're mechs that swim, Dark Sakura. I don't know.
4162320	4164320	I don't think Albatrosses can swim.
4164320	4167320	I think they just die and hang around your neck.
4169320	4174320	Speaking of dying and hanging around your neck, I'm done with the Japanese game releases this week.
4174320	4176320	Well, we have a few things for the UK.
4176320	4180320	On the 11th, we have Tekken Revolution, as I brought up earlier.
4180320	4183320	On the 12th, we have Xenoclash on the Xbox 360.
4183320	4188320	And on the 14th, Animal Crossing 3DS, Chemical Spillage Simulation for PC,
4188320	4192320	which actually just sounds hilarious without knowing anything about it.
4192320	4194320	And then The Last of Us on PS3.
4195320	4196320	That's it.
4197320	4200320	Stick a fork in it, speaking of dead things.
4201320	4203320	Okay, um, let's see.
4204320	4208320	There is some interesting controversy with this game, Vampire Smile,
4208320	4214320	which was one of those, well, it originally started off as the Dishwasher,
4214320	4219320	one of the first Xbox indie games that they showed off.
4219320	4223320	Actually, I think while they were introducing indie games,
4223320	4226320	or what did it used to be called? Community games? Way back in the day?
4226320	4231320	Anyway, so the sequel to Dishwasher, the Vampire Smile, was coming to PC.
4232320	4238320	But originally, the first way it came to the PC was a hacker,
4238320	4241320	I guess a developer, Barbarus.
4241320	4245320	He really wanted to see the game come to PC, so he cracked a version of it
4245320	4247320	and uploaded it, I guess, to the internet.
4247320	4250320	And so he kind of ported it to PC.
4250320	4255320	Well now, it's actually coming officially to PC as well,
4255320	4259320	because they weren't too happy with the fact that he cracked the game and stuff.
4261320	4265320	So, new Director's Cut is going to have some enhancements to the game and some more...
4265320	4267320	That's not a good precedent to set, though.
4267320	4271320	Like, you know, hack our game and we'll put it on the console you want.
4271320	4274320	They didn't remember, was it Sonic Generations?
4274320	4276320	They had the Sonic...
4277320	4280320	The hell is the crappy one with the werehog?
4280320	4283320	They had all the daylight missions from that game.
4283320	4286320	Ask this one. I don't know, I can't tell all those Sonic games apart.
4286320	4287320	She can.
4287320	4289320	Which Sonic game? Sonic Unleashed, I think it was.
4289320	4290320	I hadn't played that one.
4290320	4296320	Yeah, Sonic Unleashed, they had the daytime levels from that ported over to Sonic Generations for the PC,
4296320	4298320	because it never came out on PC.
4298320	4301320	I do have Sonic Generations and I haven't even played it yet.
4303320	4308320	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,
4308320	4311320	use the passphrase, TICKET.
4311320	4315320	To answer a code, man, I don't acknowledge that in my universe.
4315320	4319320	What? Acknowledge what? Don't have a one-sided conversation here.
4319320	4320320	Kiefer Sutherland.
4320320	4322320	Hey, that's coming up later in the show. Stop spoiling things.
4322320	4323320	I know.
4323320	4324320	Stop spoiling it.
4324320	4325320	I still don't like thinking about it.
4325320	4326320	Spoiler. Alright.
4326320	4328320	You know what, Rob?
4328320	4331320	What? No spoilers here. This is news.
4331320	4335320	This is about Starcraft 2. I will admit this is the one Blizzard franchise I don't play a lot of.
4335320	4338320	I owned the very first game, I didn't bother with the expansion.
4338320	4341320	But, apparently, I may not need it.
4341320	4345320	Because there's a new system in Starcraft 2 that Blizzard did this week called spawning.
4345320	4350320	And I thought that meant maybe a new enemy unit. Isn't that what zergs do? They spawn a lot of zergs.
4350320	4357320	But, anyway, what happens is you get free access to gameplay features when somebody who doesn't own a certain version of the game
4357320	4359320	parties with someone who did.
4359320	4364320	So, in other words, when you go into multiplayer, you play the most current version of the game owned by at least one person at the party.
4364320	4369320	So, if you have the free starter edition, but you come play with me and I have Starcraft 2 basic edition,
4369320	4372320	we're now both playing Starcraft 2 basic edition.
4372320	4377320	So, that's kind of cool. That's like DS1 cartridge play or something like that.
4377320	4381320	If I party up with somebody playing Heart of the Swarm, we both get to play Heart of the Swarm.
4381320	4386320	It's been rolling out globally since June 4th when this was announced.
4386320	4392320	I don't know what regions do and don't have it at this time, but this is something that is planned for everybody.
4392320	4395320	So, that's kind of awesome, actually.
4395320	4400320	Because if you have a core group of four friends that you just want to do nothing but play Starcraft with,
4400320	4403320	maybe one of you is a big Starcraft nerd, but the others aren't so much,
4403320	4409320	one person buys the game, everybody mooches off it, and you just don't play otherwise.
4409320	4411320	That's kind of cool.
4411320	4412320	Yes.
4412320	4415320	It's almost like if you had a game and then you load it to their friends,
4415320	4419320	and then they got really excited about the game and bought the sequel and it came out at launch.
4419320	4421320	Oh, we can't have that.
4421320	4424320	We can't. We can't do that. It cuts into developer money.
4424320	4426320	To be fair, although I love your tongue-in-cheek point there,
4426320	4431320	let's not forget Starcraft 2 does require an always-online connection just because that's the nature of the game.
4431320	4436320	You're right, because the PC marketplace is completely different than the console marketplace.
4436320	4439320	Because they don't require an online connection there either.
4439320	4444320	Can we go back to a time when there wasn't any of this always-online bullshit?
4446320	4449320	Although I will say, I do love my MMOs. I do love me my MMOs.
4449320	4452320	However, I also love classic games, and that's why every week on the show,
4452320	4455320	DarkSakura jumps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,
4455320	4460320	hey, kids, play this game or I'm going to cut you.
4460320	4464320	I cut you off with my razor-sharp wit.
4464320	4467320	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week this week?
4467320	4469320	Star Gladiator.
4469320	4475320	Or as it was called over here, Star Gladiator Episode 1 Final Crusade.
4475320	4478320	Yeah, Episode 1 Final Crusade. What's up with that?
4478320	4481320	Okay, so anyway, it came out in 1996.
4481320	4486320	It was a 3D fighting game done by Capcom for the PlayStation.
4486320	4491320	Well, actually for the ZN1 arcade, which was basically a glorified PlayStation.
4491320	4496320	It was their first polygon fighting game.
4496320	4502320	It actually came out before Street Fighter EX, so this was kind of a big thing for them.
4502320	4508320	It was a pretty neat little game, I mean, as far as a 3D fighter goes.
4508320	4516320	It didn't use the six button thing. It used a four button configuration.
4516320	4521320	It was a lot like how the Soul Edge and Soul Calibur games went.
4521320	4526320	You had a 3D plane. You could do ring outs. It was that type of game.
4526320	4532320	It wasn't really anything that was special as far as 3D fighting games at the time,
4532320	4535320	but the fact that it was Capcom's first makes it notable.
4535320	4540320	It also had these things called plasma reverses that are guard moves
4540320	4545320	that you have to release at a particular point in time in the battle,
4545320	4549320	where it will enable you to deflect an incoming move and stun them
4549320	4553320	so that you could actually attack in reverse.
4553320	4559320	It also does extra damage as well.
4559320	4565320	It also had a combo system so that you could basically just pummel people to death.
4565320	4571320	In the arcade mode, it was ten fights, and depending on who you chose as your character,
4571320	4575320	you had a specific set of opponents that you would fight.
4575320	4577320	It was actually a pretty good game.
4577320	4580320	You see some notable characters in there that showed up in other Capcom games,
4580320	4584320	like Hayato showed up in Marvel vs. Capcom 2,
4584320	4591320	and he had an appearance in Tatunoko vs. Capcom in the Tekkaman Blade ending,
4591320	4594320	which actually kind of made me giddy at the time.
4594320	4601320	And there was Jun, who was also in the background stages of Gem Fighter,
4601320	4605320	and in Capcom vs. SNK 2,
4605320	4610320	and in one of the wind poses of Hayato in Marvel vs. Capcom 2.
4610320	4614320	And she was also in Hawkeye's ending in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3
4614320	4617320	as a member of the West Coast Avengers, which, actually, that was pretty crazy,
4617320	4619320	because I beat that game with him.
4619320	4627320	There was Saturn Dyer, Gamoth, Gogri, Franco, Garrett, Vector, Rim Gal,
4627320	4629320	who was Jun's dad.
4629320	4633320	There's a bunch of people in the game, anyway.
4633320	4642320	It was a really neat game in that it used both English and Japanese voice acting
4642320	4645320	for the characters.
4645320	4654320	And it also spawned a Dreamcast game that was called Plasma Sword,
4654320	4658320	Nightmare of Bliss, which is actually me finding my Dreamcast copies,
4658320	4661320	what made me think of the PlayStation version.
4661320	4663320	But it was a really neat game.
4663320	4673320	I mean, for all of the stuff that it did, it may not seem a big deal today,
4673320	4675320	but when it came out, I thought it was a really cool game.
4675320	4681320	So, Star Gladiator, you win Classic Game of the Week.
4681320	4685320	I have to admit, I didn't know a lot about this game until I'm kind of watching the,
4685320	4687320	as with a lot of these classic games you pick.
4687320	4689320	I didn't know a lot about this one, but I'm watching it and I'm like,
4689320	4691320	wow, this looked pretty good for a PlayStation 1 game.
4691320	4694320	It looks a little more Dreamcast level to me.
4694320	4696320	Is it late PS1?
4696320	4698320	I'd say it was late PS1.
4698320	4705320	But you should see Star Gladiator was actually a really fun little fighter.
4705320	4709320	It had its issues just about with any PlayStation 1 game at the time,
4709320	4714320	but you should really see Plasma Sword because that was really fun, too.
4714320	4717320	This character here, June, I really like her, too.
4717320	4718320	With the chakram?
4718320	4721320	Yeah, well, she reminds me of that chicken Soul Calibur, Tina, I think it is,
4721320	4724320	with a similar feel, the big disc.
4724320	4729320	And actually, that's who I played this game most with was June.
4729320	4733320	But you should, one of these days we'll have to hook up the Dreamcast
4733320	4734320	and I'll bring over Plasma Sword.
4734320	4735320	I have a Dreamcast.
4735320	4736320	So do I.
4736320	4737320	In fact.
4737320	4739320	But I have Plasma Sword and I will bring it over.
4739320	4742320	This is why I need to get game streaming on my TV
4742320	4746320	because we need to do some classic NES game streaming through the Dreamcast emulation.
4746320	4747320	Good times.
4747320	4749320	That would be wrong, but funny.
4749320	4752320	All right, there it is, the classic game of the week, Star Gladiator.
4752320	4753320	Star Gladiator.
4753320	4757320	Oh, actually, I need to point out, Cleric Player 404 did remind me.
4757320	4760320	She's using the combo attack of Chun-Li and Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo.
4760320	4761320	Who was?
4761320	4762320	June.
4762320	4763320	Really?
4763320	4764320	Yes.
4764320	4765320	I don't remember that.
4765320	4766320	Well, there were cosplay.
4766320	4768320	I mean, not that I believe you, but I'm just...
4768320	4770320	There were costume combos, remember?
4770320	4772320	Where people would dress up as different...
4772320	4774320	Oh, yeah.
4774320	4778320	And like, I think one of Ibuki's was like the Miko costume
4778320	4783320	and Sakura had a bunch of different ones and one of Chun-Li's was June.
4783320	4784320	All right.
4784320	4786320	From Star Gladiator.
4786320	4787320	All right.
4787320	4788320	Very cool.
4788320	4792320	All right, we got plenty more show to go here.
4792320	4795320	Coming up with Part B tonight, we have a list list coming up tonight.
4795320	4797320	Few surprises in store with list list tonight.
4797320	4798320	That's all I'm going to say.
4798320	4800320	You are definitely going to want to be here live for this.
4800320	4802320	Sorry to the podcasters in advance.
4802320	4804320	Very cool live feature tonight.
4804320	4806320	And the Fugu question of the week as well.
4806320	4809320	And rapid fire news, the mailbag, FUs of the Week,
4809320	4814320	and your calls at 1-877-GAMO-LR and username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
4814320	4817320	All when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4826320	4827320	Hi there.
4827320	4830320	This is Flaco Jones and you're participating with Orange Lounge Radio,
4830320	4832320	the show where every gamer has a voice.
4832320	4835320	And I want to use my voice to tell you you should all play Ni No Kuni.
4835320	4836320	It's great.
4836320	4838320	Rob, you should beat Ni No Kuni.
4838320	4840320	And now that I said it in the bumper, you have to beat Ni No Kuni
4840320	4842320	or you have to play this bumper forever.
4843320	4846320	Looks like I'm playing the bumper forever because I still haven't beat Ni No Kuni.
4846320	4848320	You can lend me your copy then.
4848320	4849320	You want to hear a true story?
4849320	4851320	I came in the other day, Ni No Kuni.
4851320	4852320	I came back from Phoenix.
4852320	4854320	My copy of Ni No Kuni is on the floor and I'm like,
4854320	4855320	oh, it's on the floor.
4855320	4858320	That means Alan must have picked it up and started playing it at some point, right?
4858320	4860320	And he said, oh, no, I used it to put kitty treats on.
4862320	4863320	Can I borrow it, though?
4863320	4866320	Yeah, if you're actually going to play it, then yes.
4866320	4867320	I will.
4867320	4868320	Okay, I think you'll like it, actually.
4868320	4869320	So, yes, you may borrow it.
4869320	4870320	I'm fun employed.
4870320	4872320	I think Flaco would approve of that.
4872320	4874320	Yes, we did recycle a message this week.
4874320	4876320	That means we could use some new bumpers.
4876320	4880320	I did get one today, to be fair, so I'll put that in for next week.
4880320	4885320	But if you want to submit a bumper as well, you can get all the information at the Voice Geeks Network,
4885320	4886320	voggenetwork.com.
4886320	4888320	Click on forums and look at the OLR forum.
4888320	4892320	It's right there at the top in a sticky thread how you can get your voice in a bumper on the show.
4892320	4895320	And you can tell the listeners whatever you want, within reason.
4895320	4900320	I even did one in not that great Japanese, but thanks to Kuma JP for correcting my grammar.
4900320	4905320	Oh, I'm talking about the ones that, not the ones that play on the network, but the ones that bring us back here.
4905320	4907320	But I'm planning on actually doing one.
4907320	4908320	But you're on the show.
4909320	4910320	I can do a bumper.
4910320	4911320	No, you can't.
4911320	4912320	Yes, I can.
4912320	4913320	Do a bumper for Bobby's show.
4913320	4914320	I'll do one for Bobby.
4914320	4918320	I'll do one for Bobby that says, hey, listen to this show, dammit.
4918320	4923320	Hey, hey, listen, hey, listen, hey, listen.
4923320	4925320	But I have to make it high-pitched.
4925320	4926320	Hey, listen.
4926320	4931320	Anyhow, plenty more to come here on this half of Orange Lounge Radio.
4931320	4933320	But first, some rapid-fire news.
4933320	4936320	Let's take care of a lot of news this week in rapid-fire news.
4936320	4942320	Yes, so it sort of leaked out, and then it got announced, Halo Spartan Assault.
4942320	4951320	It's coming out for all your favorite gaming platforms, including Windows 8 PCs, tablets, and phones.
4953320	4955320	And those are Windows 8 devices, by the way.
4955320	4958320	Windows Phone, Surface tablets.
4959320	4967320	Yeah, and apparently it's going to be set between Halo 3 and 4, and is a twin-six shooter.
4967320	4971320	So, totally the title you're looking for.
4971320	4977320	There's some free-to-play games coming to the PlayStation 4.
4977320	4983320	PlanetSide 2 and DC Universe Online have both been confirmed for the PlayStation 4,
4983320	4986320	although I'm not surprised because it's Sony Online, so you know.
4986320	4988320	Those are Sony Online games.
4988320	4992320	But somewhere I hear Brad from PodCulture squeeing about the DC Universe Online.
4992320	4993320	Just call it a hunch.
4993320	4994320	Yeah.
4994320	4995320	If his internet's back up.
4995320	4997320	So, those will both be coming out.
4997320	5002320	And also, Warframe is going to be coming as well as a free-to-play title.
5002320	5005320	And, yeah.
5005320	5011320	So, I guess we're going to see a lot of free-to-play games on PlayStation 4, so that could be good or bad.
5011320	5012320	I don't know.
5012320	5013320	Free-to-play is not...
5014320	5016320	I like that business model, so we'll see.
5017320	5018320	You like free?
5018320	5020320	I like free, yeah.
5020320	5021320	It's awesome.
5021320	5024320	Do you think there will be a lot of free games on Xbox One?
5026320	5027320	I think there's got to be some.
5027320	5029320	That's the world we live in now.
5030320	5033320	I'm just wondering if there's going to be any MMOs on Xbox One,
5033320	5038320	because remember, there wasn't really much on, you know, the Xbox 360,
5038320	5039320	aside from Final Fantasy.
5039320	5044320	And I guess, you know, there's some pay-to-play MMOs, you know, like the Defiance and stuff,
5044320	5049320	but none like actual traditional MMOs beyond Final Fantasy XI.
5049320	5050320	Don't know.
5050320	5051320	So, it'll be interesting.
5051320	5056320	And last but not least, new Harmonix title was announced last week,
5056320	5060320	and that was Fantasia Music Evolved.
5060320	5065320	And I saw the trailer, and I'm like, that has very little to do with Fantasia.
5065320	5066320	Here's the thing.
5066320	5069320	I love Harmonix. I love Disney.
5069320	5070320	Do we get Elephants and Tutus?
5071320	5075320	Maybe, actually. I love Harmonix. I love Disney. I hate Bruno Mars.
5075320	5077320	Why was that in the trailer?
5077320	5078320	But, but, but.
5078320	5079320	Why?
5079320	5081320	But, they're going to have pop music.
5081320	5082320	They're also going to have-
5082320	5083320	That's not Fantasia.
5084320	5087320	But they're also going to have the classical music as well.
5087320	5090320	And Bohemian Rhapsody is going to be in it.
5090320	5092320	Anything with Queen is instantly better, yeah.
5092320	5095320	Queen is one of the artists, you know, confirmed.
5095320	5098320	Instant fantasticness. Just add Freddie Mercury.
5098320	5101320	Here's the tracks announced so far.
5101320	5103320	Does it make him a Disney Queen?
5103320	5108320	So, Bohemian Rhapsody, Kimbra Settle Down.
5108320	5109320	I don't know what that is.
5109320	5110320	Have you-
5110320	5111320	Fun Some Nights.
5111320	5114320	Hold on. Just in case Dark Soccer hadn't seen this yet,
5114320	5117320	I'm playing this in studio, the little teaser trailer for this.
5117320	5118320	Let me skip ahead a little bit.
5121320	5124320	So, basically, it's Sorcerer Mickey mode.
5124320	5126320	Yeah, it's like your, like, Sorcerer Mickey,
5126320	5129320	but it doesn't really, like, tell you what the game is.
5129320	5130320	Like, where's the game here?
5130320	5133320	I'm left to think it's Rhythm Party.
5133320	5136320	It, yeah. It looks like Rhythm Party.
5136320	5139320	Which I said Rhythm Party should have just been a retail release
5139320	5141320	with all the tracks, but whatever.
5141320	5145320	You know what? I don't care, because I don't really like connect games.
5145320	5148320	The thing that's kind of unique, I guess, about it, supposedly,
5148320	5151320	is you can control, like, the tempo of the song,
5151320	5154320	and, like, it changes depending on, like, stuff you do, I guess.
5154320	5156320	So that's gonna be kind of neat.
5156320	5159320	One of the tracks in there, was it AVI-
5159320	5160320	What was it?
5160320	5161320	Black Wolf in chat says,
5161320	5163320	Game trailers actually showed gameplay.
5163320	5164320	It's Elite Beat agents connect.
5164320	5166320	Oh, so it's Rhythm Party.
5166320	5167320	Like I said.
5168320	5170320	And you see this face that no one in the chat room can see?
5170320	5172320	This is my no one curface.
5172320	5176320	I'm willing to give it a shot just because I really love harmonics,
5176320	5178320	and they always put out quality.
5178320	5180320	I love harmonics, but I hate connect games.
5182320	5183320	Fair.
5184320	5187320	And Levels is also one of the songs in there,
5187320	5190320	which, if I remember correctly, I think that's-
5190320	5191320	Let's see here.
5193320	5196320	If I wanted to get up and dance, I'd take a Zumba class.
5196320	5198320	Oh, yeah. Actually, I do like Levels.
5198320	5203320	Levels is awesome because that was one of the songs that was in Forza Horizon,
5203320	5206320	one of my favorite ones on the dubstep thing.
5206320	5208320	So I'm digging it.
5208320	5209320	You know, I think it'd be kind of cool.
5209320	5211320	Harmonics, can't go wrong with them, so.
5211320	5213320	Bobby gave me a link to this, and I hadn't seen it.
5213320	5216320	So, where's the actual gameplay?
5217320	5219320	I just hear a dude talking.
5219320	5220320	Let's see gameplay.
5222320	5224320	Is that Under the Sea?
5226320	5227320	Down where it's wetter.
5227320	5228320	Under the sea.
5228320	5230320	Oh, see, there it is.
5231320	5232320	I guess.
5234320	5236320	Okay, so this is not Rhythm Party.
5239320	5240320	Huh.
5245320	5246320	Alright.
5246320	5247320	It's like-
5247320	5248320	Curious.
5248320	5249320	Put out a demo.
5249320	5250320	It seems like a game that-
5250320	5252320	I want a new Para Para Paradise, then I would play my Kinect.
5252320	5253320	You know what?
5253320	5255320	You know what they really needed to have?
5255320	5258320	Is they need to have Q games and fucking Harmonics come together
5258320	5261320	and do a new Child of Eden type of game,
5261320	5263320	because Child of Eden was fucking awesome.
5263320	5264320	It was pretty good.
5264320	5266320	ClericalEra404 in our chat quickly wants to know,
5266320	5268320	DarkSakura, why do you hate Kinect games?
5268320	5270320	Because usually they show you what you're doing
5270320	5272320	and I don't like to watch myself.
5275320	5277320	Uh, you can sometimes turn camera off.
5277320	5279320	Yeah, if I can turn the camera off, I have no problem with it.
5279320	5282320	Oh, I would have just thought you just don't like the whole flailing around.
5282320	5283320	That's just-
5283320	5286320	Well, I don't mind flailing around as long as nobody else is over.
5286320	5287320	I mean-
5287320	5290320	I was gonna say, to be fair, the original Kinect game's
5290320	5292320	not exactly very accurate a lot of times.
5292320	5294320	Yeah, that was that too.
5294320	5296320	I mean, the only fun I've ever had playing a Kinect game
5296320	5299320	was doing Para Para on Dance Masters,
5299320	5303320	which is why that's still the only Kinect game I will play.
5303320	5305320	Alright, let me move on with some other news.
5305320	5308320	Maybe DarkSakura instead would rather play Injustice.
5308320	5311320	I know she loves DC Universe, but-
5311320	5313320	Do I like DC Universe?
5313320	5316320	No, but apparently Injustice is pretty good.
5316320	5319320	Somebody said Injustice is the best thing going on in DC Universe right now.
5319320	5321320	It was a freaking stupid looking game.
5321320	5324320	Well, there's Mortal Kombat crossover coming to Injustice,
5324320	5326320	which I'm sure will surprise nobody.
5326320	5330320	Scorpion will be the next playable character in Injustice Gods Among Us DLC,
5330320	5334320	400 Microsoft points or $5, but none for Wii U buy.
5334320	5335320	Why?
5335320	5336320	Why not?
5336320	5339320	Why not? Because they have a whole bunch of other DC superheroes
5339320	5341320	that they could put in the game.
5341320	5342320	Scorpion's a superhero.
5342320	5344320	No, he's not. Now he's like fucking-
5344320	5345320	I'm just trolling.
5345320	5348320	It's like, oh hey, it's Scorpion, but I can't do any of my bloody moves
5348320	5350320	because it's fucking teen rated.
5351320	5355320	That's what happened with the whole Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe.
5355320	5359320	Oh, sorry, I can't behead Batman because it's fucking teen rated.
5359320	5362320	I don't know, whatever. It sounds lame.
5362320	5365320	I honestly did not find the game fun. The end.
5365320	5368320	Also, information on the new Voice of Snake,
5368320	5372320	because a certain co-host of mine didn't ruin this earlier in the show,
5372320	5376320	but Kiefer Sutherland confirmed as the voice of Snake in Metal Gear Solid 5,
5376320	5378320	not David Hayter.
5378320	5383320	Now, I think this was just like buzz earlier.
5383320	5386320	We didn't have confirmation, but now that it's in the trailer,
5386320	5387320	because the Konami whole thing,
5387320	5388320	which we haven't even brought up in the show yet,
5388320	5391320	but Konami had their whole little movie thing come up,
5391320	5392320	and this was part of it.
5392320	5393320	Yeah.
5393320	5396320	So, that's that.
5396320	5400320	So, that to me sounds like the whole situation where, you know,
5400320	5403320	it's the How I Met Your Mother situation where you have,
5403320	5405320	you know, Bob Saget as the narrator.
5405320	5406320	He's supposed to be the father.
5406320	5409320	But yeah, his voice isn't obviously going to change, you know,
5409320	5412320	over the default Ted Mosley voice that, you know, the characters.
5412320	5414320	So, it's just different.
5414320	5415320	All right.
5415320	5417320	And I wonder if we'll ever get a movie,
5417320	5421320	if we'll have, you know, Kiefer Sutherland playing Snake.
5421320	5425320	EA, hopefully giving some final clarity to some of the shady things
5425320	5427320	they've said about the Wii U in the past,
5427320	5430320	courtesy of EA president Frank Gebaux.
5430320	5431320	Now, I'm going to admit,
5431320	5433320	I think we brought up something similar to this last week,
5433320	5435320	but this is coming from EA president of labels.
5435320	5436320	This is somebody else.
5436320	5439320	Quote, we have a good partnership with Nintendo.
5439320	5441320	We released four games on the platform over the last year.
5441320	5444320	We're pretty proud of Need for Speed and Madden and FIFA and Mass Effect.
5444320	5448320	We have guys that are looking at the Wii U and the studio system right now
5448320	5449320	as an opportunity to the future,
5449320	5453320	but we have no publicly announced Wii U games that we're going to release this fall.
5453320	5457320	That does leave the door open to say something at E3, but don't hold your breath.
5457320	5458320	No, they have nothing coming.
5458320	5459320	Don't hold your breath.
5459320	5460320	There's nothing.
5460320	5462320	We're really excited about the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4,
5462320	5464320	and that's a pretty big endeavor in and of itself.
5464320	5465320	I wonder why.
5465320	5468320	We have four titles out on the Wii U that are active right now,
5468320	5471320	so looking at how things unfold, that's where our focus is right now.
5471320	5473320	Gen 3 is an awesome platform.
5473320	5476320	It has a huge audience, it has a lot of capability,
5476320	5478320	and we're going to continue to publish games on Gen 3
5478320	5480320	for as long as there is an audience there.
5480320	5484320	We have a tendency as a company to support the last gen platforms for many, many years.
5484320	5487320	I can tell you we have products planned for next year, the year after that,
5487320	5489320	and the year after that for Gen 3 for sure.
5489320	5493320	Well, yeah, because they keep pumping out Madden sequels and stuff like that
5493320	5499320	on PlayStation 2 and Xbox up to way past the console's life cycles and stuff,
5499320	5503320	but it doesn't necessarily mean you're going to see big games on there.
5503320	5508320	The honest, blunt way I could say this is that third-party games
5508320	5511320	aren't really what a lot of people go to Nintendo for anyway.
5511320	5513320	I mean, they'll help, of course.
5513320	5517320	I mean, certainly the Sega partnership with Sonic, which is so weird.
5517320	5520320	It's not weird.
5520320	5524320	No, I mean, to the nine-year-old gamer in me when it was Nintendo versus Sega,
5524320	5526320	that is still something I have to be used to.
5526320	5528320	They've done this the last few years with Sonic Colors.
5528320	5531320	They've had a bunch of exclusive Sonic games on the Wii,
5531320	5533320	and they haven't been that great.
5533320	5535320	It's not that weird, but anyway.
5535320	5538320	But it'll have Mario Kart, it'll have Zelda,
5538320	5541320	and there's going to be a lot of people here for that.
5541320	5543320	So, Dark Soccer.
5543320	5547320	I'm sorry, I was just getting out my DC hate out of my system.
5548320	5550320	Can't we all just get along?
5550320	5552320	No, Marvel all the way.
5552320	5556320	Hey, listen, if it's any consolation, Deadpool comes out in a couple weeks anyway.
5556320	5558320	I know! I'm so happy.
5558320	5560320	So happy.
5560320	5562320	So happy. Anyway.
5562320	5565320	Well, how about some other really quick news, okay?
5565320	5567320	Diablo 3.
5567320	5575320	We've seen an announcement before that it's going to be on the PS3 and PS4.
5575320	5577320	They are also bringing it out on Xbox 360,
5577320	5580320	but have no plans to bring it out for any other system.
5580320	5583320	Which is a polite fuck you to Xbone.
5583320	5586320	As I'm still going to call it forever.
5586320	5591320	Honestly, a lot of us have been playing it on PC already, so who cares?
5591320	5594320	And then, this makes me really happy.
5594320	5600320	Is that Hatsune Miku Project Diva F is going to be coming out in North America in August,
5600320	5603320	and I'm gonna get it.
5604320	5607320	There's a demo on June 11th.
5607320	5613320	And I'm so excited because I love the Project Diva games.
5613320	5617320	And then, last but not least, Metal Gear Rising Revengeance.
5617320	5621320	If anyone likes stories about Raiden, well, you get to play more Raiden
5621320	5623320	because it's going to be on PC.
5623320	5624320	The end.
5624320	5628320	They're also bringing, I think, the original Lords of Shadows to PC as well,
5628320	5631320	so that would be interesting.
5631320	5634320	Alright, let's go to the FUGL Question of the Week.
5634320	5641320	Every week, we ask a question of our Facebook and Google communities.
5641320	5644320	You put it together and it's FUGL.
5644320	5649320	We had a fun idea for this week because, you know, E3 really kicks off tomorrow.
5649320	5653320	The show floor doesn't open until Tuesday, but there's a shit ton of press conferences tomorrow.
5653320	5656320	And so, everybody's going to be talking about this tomorrow.
5656320	5658320	So, we thought we would go to Facebook and Google and ask,
5658320	5662320	it's that time of year to ask everyone, what's your E3 predictions?
5662320	5666320	However, we at OLR, we like to do things a little differently and maybe a little bit silly.
5666320	5670320	So, we only want your E3 predictions in a haiku format.
5670320	5674320	That would be five, seven, five, remember?
5674320	5678320	Guess, OLR me, what will occur at E3?
5678320	5680320	Games of win or fail?
5680320	5683320	That was my haiku to the listeners.
5683320	5686320	Loki, you look so impressed.
5687320	5689320	All right, here we go. Some haikus.
5689320	5693320	The Dark Sakura, I want you to count the syllables and tell me who failed.
5693320	5694320	For the record, Rob?
5694320	5695320	There are some fails in here.
5695320	5696320	For the record, Rob?
5696320	5699320	The plural of haiku is haiku.
5699320	5701320	Haikuzis.
5701320	5704320	The haikuza.
5704320	5706320	Let's go to the haikuza.
5706320	5708320	Haikuzersies.
5708320	5711320	You know what? Bite me.
5711320	5714320	Haikugaggle. All right.
5714320	5717320	And all in good fun about those of you that failed, by the way.
5717320	5724320	Edgar R. says, Call of Duty Ghost, Dogs of War, X-Bone exclusive.
5724320	5727320	I think Dogs of War, that's wrong.
5727320	5730320	That's not a haiku, you lose.
5730320	5731320	You lose.
5731320	5735320	It's also already confirmed as an exclusive to the Xbox One.
5735320	5737320	All right. I appreciate the effort.
5737320	5739320	Porkchop, since this entry.
5739320	5745320	I don't really mind as long as they don't release more shit EA games.
5745320	5747320	Bravo.
5747320	5749320	Tiara.
5749320	5754320	All I really care is about, excuse me, I fucked that up, sorry.
5754320	5757320	All I really care about is Dragon Age 3.
5757320	5759320	I love BioWare.
5759320	5762320	No, she loves Anders.
5762320	5765320	She loves her pounce a lot.
5765320	5767320	So she gets a fail for lying.
5767320	5768320	No.
5769320	5770320	All right.
5770320	5773320	Honestly, that's about...
5773320	5775320	She named her cats her pounce a lot.
5775320	5777320	All right. This is from Mason D.
5777320	5779320	Want more Pokemon?
5779320	5781320	Pokemon versus for Wii U.
5781320	5783320	Pokemon get hype.
5783320	5787320	With a big white smiley face underneath that, no less.
5787320	5790320	Blood Drunk submits the following.
5790320	5792320	That's a great name.
5792320	5794320	Blood Drunk.
5794320	5796320	I don't know if Blood Drunk is a newer listener,
5796320	5798320	but I've noticed his name on the VoG leaderboard.
5798320	5800320	So he is a big participant.
5800320	5803320	So a win to you no matter how good or bad your haiku is.
5803320	5805320	Here we go. From Blood Drunk.
5805320	5808320	Connect watches you fap.
5808320	5810320	I think that's six syllables.
5810320	5812320	Connect watches you fap.
5812320	5814320	Six syllables. That's all right. We still like his name.
5814320	5816320	Connect watches you fap.
5816320	5818320	LOL PS4 DRM.
5818320	5820320	Nintendo shows games.
5820320	5822320	All right.
5822320	5824320	Not quite a haiku, but hey.
5824320	5826320	Close enough.
5826320	5828320	It's a haiku-ga.
5828320	5830320	It's a haiku-ger.
5830320	5832320	Degenerate Johnny submits the following.
5832320	5834320	Predicting prices.
5834320	5836320	Xbox. Five bills.
5836320	5838320	Four with subs.
5838320	5840320	Sony 450.
5840320	5842320	Good way to put your predictions in.
5842320	5844320	I think he might be high balling it a little bit,
5844320	5846320	but we'll see.
5846320	5848320	Haseo Sumeruagawa submits the following.
5848320	5850320	Xbox One fucks up.
5850320	5852320	Nintendo might steal the show.
5852320	5854320	PS4 ooh pretty.
5856320	5858320	That was six syllables.
5858320	5860320	That's all right.
5860320	5862320	Liam C submits the following.
5862320	5864320	The Last Guardian.
5864320	5866320	A brand new Uncharted game.
5866320	5868320	Connect flops badly.
5868320	5870320	Good.
5870320	5872320	Code Man says,
5872320	5874320	What will E3 bring?
5874320	5876320	Nintendo surprise maybe?
5876320	5878320	Will has sports.
5878320	5880320	One just got sent to me, which I have to read.
5880320	5882320	Okay. From who?
5882320	5884320	From clerical error 404.
5884320	5886320	Sony has less trust.
5886320	5888320	Nintendo rules us all.
5888320	5890320	But it all ends well.
5890320	5892320	We'll see.
5892320	5894320	We'll see. All right.
5894320	5896320	E to the three.
5896320	5898320	That's four syllables.
5898320	5900320	You lose.
5900320	5902320	No, why can't people count?
5902320	5904320	E to the three.
5904320	5906320	Oh, they didn't.
5906320	5908320	Oh, they done screwed up.
5908320	5910320	He could do E fucking 3-0.
5910320	5912320	All right.
5912320	5914320	Captain Spike.
5914320	5916320	Here's Captain Spike's submission.
5916320	5918320	Yay, Spike. We love Spike.
5918320	5920320	He's full of win no matter if his haiku is fail or not.
5920320	5922320	Here it is.
5922320	5924320	Nintendo no show.
5924320	5926320	Sony and MS hate us all.
5926320	5928320	The worst E3 ever.
5928320	5930320	Worst E3 ever.
5930320	5932320	I love Spike.
5932320	5934320	Here's Hitstun.
5934320	5936320	Next gen consoles?
5936320	5938320	Meh. Nothing PS3
5938320	5940320	can't do.
5940320	5942320	Game of Show? DuckTales.
5942320	5944320	Ooh.
5944320	5946320	That's a good one. That's my favorite one so far, I think.
5946320	5948320	Did you watch the last trailer
5948320	5950320	they put out?
5950320	5952320	It's the side-by-side.
5952320	5954320	Oh, no, I didn't see that one.
5954320	5956320	They did one comparing the old DuckTales to the new one.
5956320	5958320	Somebody on Tumblr posted it
5958320	5960320	a while back. I'll see if I can't find it
5960320	5962320	but it was pretty neat.
5962320	5964320	Alright, here's SSJ100 Matt Sentry.
5964320	5966320	Anticipation.
5966320	5968320	Elated disappointment.
5968320	5970320	Gamers are winners.
5970320	5972320	Wouldn't that be losers
5972320	5974320	if we're disappointed, though?
5974320	5976320	And I got excited because when he said anticipation
5976320	5978320	it made me think, oh, maybe that's the Rare franchise
5978320	5980320	they're bringing back. Because y'all know
5980320	5982320	I could give two fucks about Killer Instinct
5982320	5984320	or Banjo-Kazooie
5984320	5986320	when Rare could remake Anticipation.
5986320	5988320	Just saying.
5988320	5990320	You know you want to play as the ice cream cone again
5990320	5992320	bouncing around the board.
5992320	5994320	I want ice cream right now.
5994320	5996320	This is from Steven M.
5996320	5998320	What about another cameo?
5998320	6000320	Hell no. Alright, Steven M says
6000320	6002320	like, I had to think about what the fuck game
6002320	6004320	is he talking about? Oh, god.
6004320	6006320	Alright, Steven M.
6006320	6008320	Must be online Xbox.
6008320	6010320	Wii U will die.
6010320	6012320	We finally get Last Guardian.
6012320	6014320	I think you did 557.
6014320	6016320	Andy R.
6016320	6018320	Especially since you
6018320	6020320	gave them how to do a haiku.
6020320	6022320	I put right there, as a
6022320	6024320	reminder, a haiku is 575.
6024320	6026320	We can't read.
6026320	6028320	What's the syllable?
6028320	6030320	We love our listeners.
6030320	6032320	We're just giving you shit.
6032320	6034320	I give everybody shit.
6034320	6036320	We just want to educate you all this week on haikuses.
6036320	6038320	Yeah, study some damn literature.
6038320	6040320	Fuck.
6040320	6042320	Was that a haiku?
6042320	6044320	No, not quite.
6044320	6046320	Alright, Andy R.
6046320	6048320	I'll make one though if you like.
6048320	6050320	You think of one while I read the rest of these.
6050320	6052320	Alright, Andy R says
6052320	6054320	I don't really know.
6054320	6056320	A giant enemy crab?
6056320	6058320	Ridge Racer 2.
6058320	6060320	Ridge Racer 2 is
6060320	6062320	four syllables.
6062320	6064320	Andy, you're killing me.
6064320	6066320	That would have been great for 2006.
6066320	6068320	Alright, lots of answers
6068320	6070320	on Google Plus. We have five
6070320	6072320	answers on Google Plus. I didn't even know there were
6072320	6074320	that many people using it.
6074320	6076320	Oh, come on, come on.
6076320	6078320	ActDeaf says what I want this year
6078320	6080320	is to see really good games
6080320	6082320	and vog to hit big.
6082320	6084320	Somebody kissing a little
6084320	6086320	vog behind in that response.
6086320	6088320	Love it. Thank you, ActDeaf.
6088320	6090320	Flaco Jones says
6090320	6092320	Xbox and Sony, their DRM
6092320	6094320	kills gaming. What's a Nintendo?
6094320	6096320	Okay, I got one.
6096320	6098320	Let me make sure I have it right.
6098320	6100320	We'll do yours last.
6100320	6102320	Forget it.
6102320	6104320	Go. Use the internet.
6104320	6106320	There are haiku examples.
6108320	6110320	There are haiku examples.
6110320	6112320	Okay.
6112320	6114320	Really use Google.
6114320	6116320	Okay.
6116320	6118320	Fuck. Alright, Technus
6118320	6120320	says
6120320	6122320	use some fucking Google.
6122320	6124320	Alright.
6124320	6126320	Technus says people still complain.
6126320	6128320	Rare shows next gen battle
6128320	6130320	toads. Why you still hating?
6130320	6132320	You never
6132320	6134320	know. Retertainment
6134320	6136320	says, oh, it's a double haiku.
6136320	6138320	Ooh. Retertainment's always
6138320	6140320	got to fucking show everybody up. Alright.
6140320	6142320	Here we go. That's okay. I love it. Alright. Retertainment
6142320	6144320	says gamers hate everything.
6144320	6146320	Everything will receive
6146320	6148320	scorn. Twitter will explode.
6148320	6150320	Good one. Gamers will
6150320	6152320	not see a wanted not
6152320	6154320	seen project. The Last Guardian.
6154320	6156320	We got it.
6156320	6158320	Since he did two, we got another one from
6158320	6160320	clerical error. Alright. Let me read this last one
6160320	6162320	from Google Plus. From Travis H.
6162320	6164320	Sony is epic. Xbone
6164320	6166320	will be eaten up. Long live
6166320	6168320	PlayStation.
6168320	6170320	We'll see how that press conference goes.
6170320	6172320	I'm approaching it with cautious optimism
6172320	6174320	Travis. Cautious optimism.
6174320	6176320	Alright. Last but not least.
6176320	6178320	Nintendo has props, but Sony has
6178320	6180320	some issues. I guess we should wait.
6180320	6182320	That one was good.
6182320	6184320	YYR in chat.
6184320	6186320	Can't you people
6186320	6188320	count? You have offended Jamie.
6188320	6190320	Study some damn books.
6190320	6192320	You win the internet
6192320	6194320	YYR. Xbox One console.
6194320	6196320	TV, TV, TV, sports.
6196320	6198320	What's wrong? Deal with it.
6198320	6200320	That's good.
6200320	6202320	Did you do that one by yourself? I just did that one. I love it.
6202320	6204320	I love it.
6204320	6206320	After I posted the question. Use that Mensa thing for something.
6206320	6208320	There you go.
6208320	6210320	Jamie came to me tonight.
6210320	6212320	She said you should make every week be
6212320	6214320	a haiku.
6214320	6216320	Alright.
6216320	6218320	Alright. And SSJ100
6218320	6220320	Matt bringing some clarity.
6220320	6222320	Anticipation because gamers are anticipating
6222320	6224320	a lot for E3. Elated disappointment
6224320	6226320	because people will be either happy or disappointed.
6226320	6228320	Gamers are winners because no matter what
6228320	6230320	gamers win because we have all these
6230320	6232320	new games to play.
6232320	6234320	Okay. Okay. Alright.
6234320	6236320	Anyhow, I know we gave some of you a bad time, but
6236320	6238320	that was a really fun topic. So thank you everybody for
6238320	6240320	trying. I love you YYR.
6240320	6242320	Alright.
6242320	6244320	Do I need to give you two a moment?
6244320	6246320	No. I don't love you in that way.
6246320	6248320	Alright.
6248320	6250320	Just a few more stories and then list list tonight.
6250320	6252320	But first, Loki.
6252320	6254320	Alright. Code Manner's reminding me that
6254320	6256320	I need to play more Borderlands 2.
6256320	6258320	Because I haven't touched it on PC yet.
6258320	6260320	Even though I finished the game
6260320	6262320	three times on 360.
6262320	6264320	So yes, unfortunately
6264320	6266320	there was some massive lay-offs
6266320	6268320	at Zynga. Also
6268320	6270320	including the closure
6270320	6272320	of OMG Pop.
6272320	6274320	And
6274320	6276320	so they closed the office there.
6276320	6278320	Also they closed
6278320	6280320	the Zynga office
6280320	6282320	in Los Angeles,
6282320	6284320	Dallas, and New York.
6286320	6288320	And I know there was lay-offs I think
6288320	6290320	in all of their offices. I think about
6290320	6292320	five hundred and
6292320	6294320	like
6294320	6296320	five twenty or five forty
6296320	6298320	or something like that.
6298320	6300320	People were laid off.
6300320	6302320	Actually I was reaching out to one of my friends
6302320	6304320	who is a concept artist
6304320	6306320	over at Zynga
6306320	6308320	in San Francisco. I think she's pretty high up
6308320	6310320	though.
6310320	6312320	I don't think she's affected by it.
6312320	6314320	Yeah, that kind of sucks.
6314320	6316320	And of course a lot of
6316320	6318320	horror stories coming out about
6318320	6320320	how things were run and stuff like that.
6320320	6322320	And how they were talking about
6322320	6324320	the terms they use
6324320	6326320	for cloning things. Like
6326320	6328320	taking games like Tiny Tower
6328320	6330320	and turning them into Dream Heights or whatever.
6332320	6334320	I don't know. It's kind of sick to me.
6336320	6338320	So maybe this is the beginning
6338320	6340320	of the end. This is surely
6340320	6342320	not too good for them.
6344320	6346320	Well, I mean I don't
6346320	6348320	like to poke fun or tease
6348320	6350320	or you know
6350320	6352320	celebrate layoffs. Especially
6352320	6354320	like Loki says. He has
6354320	6356320	friends that are at Zynga and so forth.
6356320	6358320	We always knew Zynga had a really
6358320	6360320	questionable business model. And I think
6360320	6362320	people bought into
6362320	6364320	that way too fast. And Zynga
6364320	6366320	expanded way too fast over
6366320	6368320	Farmville. And I think it just goes to show
6368320	6370320	Farmville was kind of a one hit wonder.
6370320	6372320	I hate to say.
6372320	6374320	Some would argue with me that there were other Facebook
6374320	6376320	games and blah, blah, blah.
6376320	6378320	Well, it's like this. When the news came out about them
6378320	6380320	copying games. I mean that was just
6380320	6382320	shitty. Aha had good albums
6382320	6384320	and good music. But the only
6384320	6386320	song anyone ever cared about
6386320	6388320	was Take On Me. That is
6388320	6390320	quite possibly the best possible comparison
6390320	6392320	somebody could have made in this scenario. Because
6392320	6394320	remember I had that thing of Dan
6394320	6396320	singing the lyrics to the
6396320	6398320	synth part with one hit wonder
6398320	6400320	instead of the...
6400320	6402320	By the way before I get to the next news story
6402320	6404320	I just got a text message. And I'll let you
6404320	6406320	guess where this is from Dark Soccer. Are you ready?
6406320	6408320	Alright here's the text message
6408320	6410320	I just got. Haiku game
6410320	6412320	is weak. Sometimes we
6412320	6414320	just can't even. DarkSakura
6414320	6416320	mad. Girl.
6416320	6418320	It's from Allen. I know.
6418320	6420320	I thought that was
6420320	6422320	good. Alright. Let's see
6422320	6424320	going into some
6424320	6426320	news about the Ouya.
6426320	6428320	And some more games coming to the Ouya.
6428320	6430320	Specifically Sonic the Hedgehog 4 and
6430320	6432320	Sonic CD. I'm not surprised.
6432320	6434320	They're going to be coming to the Ouya.
6434320	6436320	You can side load those right now and
6436320	6438320	they work just fine.
6438320	6440320	So why not try to make some money off of it right?
6440320	6442320	Exactly. I got a Moga
6442320	6444320	version. I got my controller free of Sonic CD
6444320	6446320	that plays just fine. Well I mean still
6446320	6448320	though it's Sega support for the Ouya so that's
6448320	6450320	kind of cool. How about some Phantasy Star online?
6450320	6452320	Alright. Maybe that's wishful thinking.
6452320	6454320	They're coming out on June 27th in the
6454320	6456320	Ouya store. $7 each. This is Sonic
6456320	6458320	the Hedgehog 4 episode 1
6458320	6460320	episode 2 and Sonic CD.
6460320	6462320	No idea if the Ouya version will
6462320	6464320	include fun for Sonic the Hedgehog 4.
6464320	6466320	Because unfortunately that was missing in the
6466320	6468320	earlier versions. Anybody?
6468320	6470320	Alright.
6470320	6472320	The Ouya ports they say are optimized
6472320	6474320	for the console's Tegra 3
6474320	6476320	processor and free trial
6476320	6478320	versions will be available.
6478320	6480320	Sega of America director of mobile business
6480320	6482320	David Zemke, interesting where this is coming
6482320	6484320	from, was praising Ouya's
6484320	6486320	quote disruptive technology and
6486320	6488320	quote they want to see what these technologies
6488320	6490320	can do and be a part of it from the beginning.
6490320	6492320	We're always looking for
6492320	6494320	other titles and there may be some future titles
6494320	6496320	that we'd like to bring over. For us
6496320	6498320	we're always trying to bring the best
6498320	6500320	gaming experience to the right platforms.
6500320	6502320	It's a delicate mix of how
6502320	6504320	and when to do it.
6504320	6506320	Hmm. That's right after the launch
6506320	6508320	of the Ouya by the way which is June 25th.
6508320	6510320	The day before my birthday y'all.
6510320	6512320	Just saying. Alright.
6512320	6514320	Anyhow.
6514320	6516320	Dark
6516320	6518320	Sakura, one more story and then we'll get into list list tonight.
6518320	6520320	Sorry we were just having a discussion about
6520320	6522320	Turian Smut.
6522320	6524320	Of course. No not really.
6524320	6526320	Something from
6526320	6528320	Double Fine, the game Massive
6528320	6530320	Chalice that
6530320	6532320	basically as they were
6532320	6534320	saying that there was going to be
6534320	6536320	a gay relationship in the game that
6536320	6538320	had been taken out and
6538320	6540320	now the project leader feels shitty because
6540320	6542320	people on Kickstarter say no we want it.
6542320	6544320	So he's putting it in.
6544320	6546320	I guess it had been the intention
6546320	6548320	but it just sort of was taken out.
6548320	6550320	And so now they are putting everything
6550320	6552320	back in and making sure that
6552320	6554320	the people paying for it get what they want.
6554320	6556320	So it's already passed
6556320	6558320	it's $725,000
6558320	6560320	goal. It's at
6560320	6562320	$857,569
6562320	6564320	and it has 20 days to go until
6564320	6566320	the deadline.
6566320	6568320	Nope. Less than that now.
6568320	6570320	18 days? Yeah.
6570320	6572320	Hmm. As of today.
6572320	6574320	Interesting.
6574320	6576320	All that from feedback.
6576320	6578320	That's what you want. We're putting it back in.
6578320	6580320	That's kind of cool though because that makes it seem like
6580320	6582320	Kickstarter really is a place for
6582320	6584320	not to say
6584320	6586320	they're investors or whatever because
6586320	6588320	Kickstarter is the backing or whatever but that they get a
6588320	6590320	say that these people really had a say.
6590320	6592320	Well yeah. I mean if you look
6592320	6594320	at it this way it is probably the
6594320	6596320	best type of board meeting you can ever
6596320	6598320	expect because you've got
6598320	6600320	real time feedback going in.
6600320	6602320	Alright. So I think it's good.
6602320	6604320	Something that you would consider backing or a game
6604320	6606320	that you might think you're going to buy or?
6606320	6608320	I told you what I'm waiting for for my first
6608320	6610320	my first backing.
6610320	6612320	No. What? Well unless he's
6612320	6614320	already put it up I'm waiting for
6614320	6616320	the
6616320	6618320	understanding video games.
6618320	6620320	I don't remember. Can you refresh
6620320	6622320	my memory about this? The seg stewing?
6622320	6624320	Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
6624320	6626320	There was
6626320	6628320	another name it was though.
6628320	6630320	But yeah he hasn't put it up yet.
6630320	6632320	I'm going to give my
6632320	6634320	Kickstarter cherry to seg.
6634320	6636320	Love, love, love, love.
6636320	6638320	That's a fair place to
6638320	6640320	give your Kickstarter cherry.
6640320	6642320	Alright.
6642320	6644320	I'm trying to get this
6644320	6646320	well we're going to do Listless now
6646320	6648320	except I'm having a little problem with the
6648320	6650320	connection.
6650320	6652320	Let's see if we can get it there.
6652320	6654320	We're going to call an old friend of ours here at Orange
6654320	6656320	Lounge Radio to help us out with Listless tonight
6656320	6658320	and hopefully the internet will hold up.
6658320	6660320	But I think we're connected now. Are you there
6660320	6662320	old friend? Hello. Hey
6662320	6664320	Bobby Blackwolf how you doing?
6664320	6666320	I'm doing good. Rob called you old.
6666320	6668320	Shouldn't he be like old chum?
6668320	6670320	Yes. Oh I'm not Adam
6670320	6672320	West in Batman okay. How you
6672320	6674320	doing Bobby? I'm doing good. I've been
6674320	6676320	playing Animal Crossing since I got off the
6676320	6678320	air. Finally have time to get into that huh? What do you think
6678320	6680320	so far? It's Animal Crossing.
6680320	6682320	I'm very sad
6682320	6684320	because everybody else has this and I don't even
6684320	6686320	have a 3DS so whatever.
6686320	6688320	No because
6688320	6690320	I don't have a job so we're not buying
6690320	6692320	one. You have to have a J-O-B
6692320	6694320	to have a 3DS.
6694320	6696320	You're going to need to get on MTurk.
6696320	6698320	I've even already been in someone else's town
6698320	6700320	so my fruit collection is growing.
6700320	6702320	Wow. Nice I need to go open my
6702320	6704320	gates. But anyhow I wanted
6704320	6706320	to make sure you had a chance. You know
6706320	6708320	our Listless topic tonight is about E3
6708320	6710320	and we're going to get into that in a minute. But I
6710320	6712320	wanted a chance for the listeners to hear
6712320	6714320	from you because you've worked
6714320	6716320	you know in case our listeners
6716320	6718320	don't know you've worked very hard on the
6718320	6720320	voice of geeks network. The whole thing is really
6720320	6722320	done from the ground up. I mean
6722320	6724320	yeah the template was
6724320	6726320	something we bought but even
6726320	6728320	Dark Sakura heavily modified that template graphically.
6728320	6730320	You have done a lot of programming
6730320	6732320	for the whole VoG game and everything
6732320	6734320	that you announced with E3.Vognetwork.com
6734320	6736320	right? Right
6736320	6738320	and I mean yeah the website I mean
6738320	6740320	PHPBB is the forum software and that
6740320	6742320	handles like the user registration
6742320	6744320	and that's it. Everything else
6744320	6746320	started with a blank
6746320	6748320	file. For any
6748320	6750320	Unix geeks out there I wrote it all in VI
6750320	6752320	so and
6752320	6754320	you know if you don't know what VI is that's
6754320	6756320	fine but if you do know what VI is
6756320	6758320	you kind of know what that means
6758320	6760320	that's like a more hardcore notepad.
6760320	6762320	Yeah I could never use VI
6762320	6764320	I was always about was it Pico or Pine?
6764320	6766320	One was the email. I used Pico.
6766320	6768320	Pine was the mail.
6768320	6770320	Yeah one was email and one was
6770320	6772320	shows you my knowledge of Unix I
6772320	6774320	haven't used it in a while but
6774320	6776320	you coded away in VI this new
6776320	6778320	E3.Vognetwork.com what
6778320	6780320	are you hoping comes of this?
6780320	6782320	I don't know
6782320	6784320	this is me saying
6784320	6786320	this is an idea I have
6786320	6788320	I wonder if it'll work and in the past
6788320	6790320	I've had these ideas and they didn't work and
6790320	6792320	then two years later everybody's doing them
6792320	6794320	so we'll see if this is another one of
6794320	6796320	those. We'll see so be sure to check
6796320	6798320	it out guys if you haven't seen it yet
6798320	6800320	vognetwork.com especially those
6800320	6802320	of you listening on the podcast
6802320	6804320	everything will open up on Monday night for
6804320	6806320	the question and answer but tonight live
6806320	6808320	you can at least watch the video
6808320	6810320	and learn everything you're going to need to know
6810320	6812320	for when everything goes live
6812320	6814320	with the question asking.
6814320	6816320	I've already been given the blacklist
6816320	6818320	against asking anything about Hello Kitty
6818320	6820320	games so I'm not going to do that.
6820320	6822320	Fair enough.
6822320	6824320	Alright so
6824320	6826320	you're leaving for E3 tomorrow right?
6826320	6828320	Correct tomorrow morning.
6828320	6830320	What's your very first appointment?
6830320	6832320	Um
6832320	6834320	Bethesda I think
6834320	6836320	Yeah I think it's Bethesda
6836320	6838320	it's at 2 o'clock that way I can get there
6838320	6840320	and see things from noon to 2
6840320	6842320	and kind of get my way to land but I think
6842320	6844320	Bethesda at 2.
6844320	6846320	I know we're about to get into the list list here about
6846320	6848320	thing I most want to happen at E3 2013
6848320	6850320	but seriously off the record
6850320	6852320	what are you personally looking forward
6852320	6854320	to getting your hands on yourself and checking out?
6854320	6856320	Um
6856320	6858320	this is my standard answer
6858320	6860320	and everybody calls it a cop out but I don't care.
6860320	6862320	Oh no I know what you're going to say and I think it's a great answer.
6862320	6864320	It's the game I
6864320	6866320	haven't heard of yet
6866320	6868320	and it's always been that like it was
6868320	6870320	you know Scribblenauts
6870320	6872320	is usually you know the
6872320	6874320	thing I go back to. Nobody
6874320	6876320	had heard of Scribblenauts I never heard of it
6876320	6878320	and it was in the back corner of
6878320	6880320	one of the halls because Warner Brothers
6880320	6882320	had like their booth kind of near a wall
6882320	6884320	and they had this on the side
6884320	6886320	facing that back wall
6886320	6888320	and I went and saw it
6888320	6890320	at the very end it was the last thing I
6890320	6892320	saw on Thursday because somebody else said
6892320	6894320	there's a game called Scribblenauts you should go check it out
6894320	6896320	and it's hidden in the back corner and that was my game of show
6896320	6898320	which pissed off
6898320	6900320	people because you know I should be giving it to a
6900320	6902320	graphically good game and not a DS title
6902320	6904320	at the time and so it's
6904320	6906320	finding those gems
6906320	6908320	you know like that's how
6908320	6910320	I found Katamari Damacy
6910320	6912320	which is the same kind of thing
6912320	6914320	so it's the game I haven't heard of yet
6914320	6916320	I think that is a fantastic answer
6916320	6918320	and I look forward to hearing what that game is
6918320	6920320	when I come see you in person on Thursday
6920320	6922320	at least they'll let me see the Ouya booth
6922320	6924320	alright yeah you're going to get to do
6924320	6926320	the Ouya booth because I don't you know
6926320	6928320	I'm probably not going to get to go in there
6928320	6930320	because I don't want to leave the show floors
6930320	6932320	that's fine unless they like keep it open
6932320	6934320	later and then I'll pop in
6934320	6936320	that's all you dude I'll do the b-roll
6936320	6938320	alright anyway
6938320	6940320	all seriousness though we are going to play
6940320	6942320	Listless here but there's one other reason
6942320	6944320	I have you here tonight and there's been
6944320	6946320	a theme here at VOG Network the past couple weeks
6946320	6948320	and that is that the game is always changing
6948320	6950320	and the game is changing again
6950320	6952320	tonight isn't it Bobby
6952320	6954320	that's right what is new what did you do
6954320	6956320	for us this week
6956320	6958320	I hope you're logged into the site
6958320	6960320	everybody because you no longer
6960320	6962320	have to learn how to private message
6962320	6964320	Rob to play Listless
6964320	6966320	if you've ever done any of the live
6966320	6968320	polls here on VOG
6968320	6970320	then you kind of
6970320	6972320	know where to look
6972320	6974320	that's where you're going to want to look
6974320	6976320	so with that it's time to start
6976320	6978320	some Listless
6980320	6982320	as a reminder for everybody
6982320	6984320	the way Listless works is that
6984320	6986320	we are going to give
6986320	6988320	three answers each host
6988320	6990320	and our special guest Bobby Blackwolf three answers
6990320	6992320	that we believe best meet the
6992320	6994320	criteria of the list and tonight's
6994320	6996320	topic thing I most want to happen
6996320	6998320	at E3 2013
6998320	7000320	and once everything is up on the list
7000320	7002320	then we will go around and this is what has
7002320	7004320	to happen we have to strike the items that are
7004320	7006320	not worthy of the list it's a very
7006320	7008320	difficult painful process
7008320	7010320	but it must be done remember there is
7010320	7012320	a new rule that is still in play however
7012320	7014320	and that is that when a host has two
7014320	7016320	items eliminated from the list the third
7016320	7018320	gets immunity so a person's list
7018320	7020320	cannot be completely decimated
7020320	7022320	alright here it is the topic thing
7022320	7024320	I most want to happen at
7024320	7026320	E3 2013
7026320	7028320	let's put it up on the board
7028320	7030320	at live.vognetwork.com
7030320	7032320	for those of you that are logged in right
7032320	7034320	now you will start to see the board
7034320	7036320	and our answers as we
7036320	7038320	fill it in hopefully right
7038320	7040320	Bobby that's also part of the reason you're on the line
7040320	7042320	yes alright I made
7042320	7044320	it live what's that
7044320	7046320	I'm keeping a watch on it oh there it is
7046320	7048320	it just popped up I see it on my screen
7048320	7050320	alright here it is the thing I most want to happen
7050320	7052320	at E3 2013
7052320	7054320	so Bobby you're our guest
7054320	7056320	why don't you start us off tonight what is the number three thing
7056320	7058320	you most want to see happen
7058320	7060320	at E3 2013
7060320	7062320	so I'm going to go kind of with an easy
7062320	7064320	answer at first because I'm still having trouble
7064320	7066320	figuring out number one and number two so chat help me out
7066320	7068320	oh yeah if you
7068320	7070320	have an answer you want to submit for inclusion on the list
7070320	7072320	shout them out live.vognetwork.com
7072320	7074320	but I'm
7074320	7076320	going to say the easy answer
7076320	7078320	a new F-Zero
7078320	7080320	you know
7080320	7082320	I think that's a very
7082320	7084320	good safe answer
7084320	7086320	and I think that is one that can't possibly
7086320	7088320	get eliminated no matter what happens
7088320	7090320	of course that's always famous last words
7090320	7092320	yeah thanks for doing that answer
7092320	7094320	alright let's put it up on the board
7094320	7096320	Bobby locks in a new F-Zero
7096320	7098320	alright Dark Sakura
7098320	7100320	what is the number three thing that you want to see happen
7100320	7102320	at E3 2013
7102320	7104320	like it's probably it won't happen
7104320	7106320	but I would love to have Sega announce
7106320	7108320	that they're back in the console business
7108320	7110320	it won't happen
7110320	7112320	but it's what I want
7112320	7114320	right Sega
7114320	7116320	is back in the console business
7116320	7118320	let's put it up on the board Dreamcast 2
7120320	7122320	they should call it the
7122320	7124320	Sega Utopia
7124320	7126320	the Sega Utopia okay
7126320	7128320	my turn for a number three answer
7128320	7130320	I'm going to say
7130320	7132320	I'm going to have
7132320	7134320	to figure out how to fit this in the board but
7134320	7136320	my number three answer is
7136320	7138320	the Microsoft server crashes
7138320	7140320	at the show causing all the
7140320	7142320	Xbox ones to stop playing games
7142320	7144320	after Wednesday
7144320	7146320	because you know every 24 hours
7146320	7148320	it's got to check in right
7148320	7150320	so the Microsoft
7150320	7152320	server crashes for 24 hours
7152320	7154320	I guess that's how I'll shorten it
7160320	7162320	alright putting that up on the board right now
7162320	7164320	boy Bobby would be very sad
7164320	7166320	Bobby wouldn't you be sad if like
7166320	7168320	you didn't get to play an Xbox one and then
7168320	7170320	all of a sudden the servers crash for 24 hours
7174320	7176320	but then I'd laugh
7176320	7178320	alright Loki
7178320	7180320	your number three answer
7180320	7182320	just because I want to get this out of the way
7182320	7184320	Microsoft
7184320	7186320	and Sony go back on their plans
7186320	7188320	for DRM it's days
7188320	7190320	the way it is now
7190320	7192320	I love how you threw in
7192320	7194320	and Sony when we don't really know you
7194320	7196320	oh we know
7196320	7198320	let's be honest
7198320	7200320	no one's keying themselves
7200320	7202320	alright fair enough let's put that up on the board
7202320	7204320	Loki says MS and Sony go back
7204320	7206320	on their DRM plans
7206320	7208320	alright Bobby we're to you for your number two
7208320	7210320	answer tonight for listless
7210320	7212320	thing you most want to see happen at E3 2013
7212320	7214320	I want to see E3
7214320	7216320	announce that Kensha Hall
7216320	7218320	will be returning next year
7218320	7220320	dammit you stole mine
7220320	7222320	oh really
7222320	7224320	you had that on your list uh oh
7224320	7226320	these things happen you better check the chat room
7226320	7228320	Bobby just threw that up on the board E3 announces the return
7228320	7230320	of Kensha Hall

7232320	7234320	that goes with that I don't know
7234320	7236320	we'll see alright Dark Sakura
7236320	7238320	what's your number two answer
7238320	7240320	Sony uses Final Fantasy
7240320	7242320	7 to display an engine without
7242320	7244320	a release of Final Fantasy 7 remake
7244320	7246320	so
7246320	7248320	so basically they're gonna repeat what they did with
7248320	7250320	uh uh PlayStation 3
7250320	7252320	and show a Final Fantasy tech demo that never happens
7252320	7254320	Final Fantasy tech demo that never results in a game
7254320	7256320	that'd be awesome
7256320	7258320	if it was a new Final Fantasy engine
7258320	7260320	hey
7260320	7262320	yeah it looks like Advent Children
7262320	7264320	nope never gonna get it alright I'm gonna put this
7264320	7266320	up on the board Final Fantasy 7 PS4
7266320	7268320	tech demo that never is a real game
7268320	7270320	yes I think that should fit within the
7270320	7272320	confines of our shiny new board
7272320	7274320	live.vognetwork.com

7512320	7514320	recap before we get to the very difficult
7514320	7516320	part a new F-Zero
7516320	7518320	Sega is back in the console
7518320	7520320	business Microsoft server crashes

7546320	7548320	tonight so unfortunately it's
7548320	7550320	getting crowded up here so unfortunately it's
7550320	7552320	time to ask which of these is not
7552320	7554320	worthy of the list
7554320	7556320	Bobby Black Wolf I know you don't want to do it
7556320	7558320	but you're going to have to make one of us mad by eliminating
7558320	7560320	something off the list what's it going to be
7560320	7562320	Porn to Miiverse
7562320	7564320	Bobby you're
7564320	7566320	killing me why are you getting rid of porn
7566320	7568320	though
7568320	7570320	because
7570320	7572320	because the Wii U is
7572320	7574320	a wholesome system
7574320	7576320	think of the children
7576320	7578320	it has been stricken from the list
7578320	7580320	Porn to Miiverse is gone
7580320	7582320	alright who's
7582320	7584320	next Dark Sakura
7584320	7586320	there's the various answers which
7586320	7588320	one of these is not worthy of
7588320	7590320	the list
7590320	7592320	tough one
7592320	7594320	there's a lot of good answers up here
7594320	7596320	yeah there are
7596320	7598320	I'm
7598320	7600320	probably going to have to axe
7600320	7602320	the
7602320	7604320	Microsoft and Sony going back because
7604320	7606320	I don't think Microsoft is
7606320	7608320	going to
7608320	7610320	eliminating it because you're just like it's not happening
7610320	7612320	and we still don't know
7612320	7614320	what Sony's going to say you might want it
7614320	7616320	it's all speculation but you just alright
7616320	7618320	it has been stricken from the list
7618320	7620320	as sad as that is going to make some of you but I
7620320	7622320	understand alright my turn to strike
7622320	7624320	something from the list oh gosh
7624320	7626320	these are all actually really good
7628320	7630320	I don't know
7632320	7634320	I hate to do this
7634320	7636320	Loki but I'm removing Super Mario
7636320	7638320	RPG 2 before you get mad
7638320	7640320	at me people it's
7640320	7642320	the same reason Dark Sakura got rid of hers
7642320	7644320	it's not fucking happening so
7644320	7646320	let's not even get our hopes up
7646320	7648320	so Super Mario
7648320	7650320	RPG 2 I'm sorry but it has been removed
7650320	7652320	from the list but the good news is
7652320	7654320	GTA or Saints Row MMO gets immunity
7654320	7656320	going into the final removal which is yours
7656320	7658320	Loki well that's fantastic news
7658320	7660320	and since it's not really going to happen either
7660320	7662320	new Mass Effect announcement

7664320	7666320	hey if they got the first

7878320	7880320	yes

7882320	7884320	is the place to send us emails dark soccer
7884320	7886320	is gonna dive in head first and
7886320	7888320	find some emails that she thinks are
7888320	7890320	worthy of reading on the show tonight
7890320	7892320	first email
7892320	7894320	it's also subject line is
7894320	7896320	now they've done it
7896320	7898320	I looked up hubris the other day to make sure it meant
7898320	7900320	what I thought it did Microsoft definitely
7900320	7902320	has an overabundance of hubris
7902320	7904320	they revealed Xbox
7904320	7906320	one and the consumers on the internet
7906320	7908320	made assumptions then Microsoft denied
7908320	7910320	the rumors but last Thursday confirmed all
7910320	7912320	the rumors to be true and the
7912320	7914320	consumers are not happy see major Nelson's
7914320	7916320	blog comments to see the shit storm
7916320	7918320	the xbox one seems to be defying
7918320	7920320	the consumers
7920320	7922320	I'm sorry the consumers who use the internet
7922320	7924320	oh wait those are the target demographic
7924320	7926320	it's really stupid business wise
7926320	7928320	to ignore your customer base and punish them
7928320	7930320	in the process I hope they change
7930320	7932320	and that comes from Rababa
7932320	7934320	agreed
7934320	7936320	I'm gonna apologize can you summarize that for me cause Alan
7936320	7938320	just got home and I was talking to him
7938320	7940320	um basically Microsoft denying the rumors then
7940320	7942320	confirming the rumors and a big shit storm
7942320	7944320	yeah what's up with that they totally did
7944320	7946320	say no it's but then they were also
7946320	7948320	saying like at one point what like
7948320	7950320	it was gonna be $60 for the license
7950320	7952320	or something I don't
7952320	7954320	sometimes the left hand isn't talking to the right hand is it
7954320	7956320	well and I'll repeat this line
7956320	7958320	it's really stupid business wise to ignore your
7958320	7960320	customer base and punish them in the process
7960320	7962320	so that was from Rababa
7962320	7964320	well thank you Rababa
7964320	7966320	very very good points and the last
7966320	7968320	demo cause we only had two
7968320	7970320	unless you want me to read all of the Russian porn
7970320	7972320	and the French porn and god are we
7972320	7974320	still getting those no well you
7974320	7976320	took care of all of those but well apparently we're not
7976320	7978320	getting me verse porn thanks to Bobby
7978320	7980320	really of course you get Russian porn
7980320	7982320	I get all sorts of like
7982320	7984320	porn emails I'm like I don't know why
7984320	7986320	I don't sign up for porn
7986320	7988320	no one signs up for porn
7988320	7990320	porn happens
7990320	7992320	okay this is another one
7992320	7994320	from Rababa
7994320	7996320	you should probably avoid my other emails for reading
7996320	7998320	too late this is about
7998320	8000320	the Xbox how it games letter I
8000320	8002320	slash we got via email
8002320	8004320	here is one quote feature
8004320	8006320	your games keep playing even
8006320	8008320	when you're not just because you're not playing
8008320	8010320	doesn't mean your games have to stop
8010320	8012320	with living games technology and the power of the
8012320	8014320	cloud game worlds are persistent
8014320	8016320	so the things you do in a game will
8016320	8018320	stay that way wait the living
8018320	8020320	games continue to play without you like an MMO
8020320	8022320	which is the opposite of things
8022320	8024320	you do in the game will stay that way
8024320	8026320	we call that technology save files
8026320	8028320	thank you Rababa

8364320	8366320	alright just a couple more news stories
8366320	8368320	for you guys and then we're going to get to the Twitter
8368320	8370320	topics and our Skype line at
8370320	8372320	1877 Game OLR or our username
8372320	8374320	on Skype OrangeLoungeRadio but first
8374320	8376320	Loki
8376320	8378320	Minecraft is getting some updates on the
8378320	8380320	portable version or the Pocket
8380320	8382320	Edition including
8382320	8384320	Alpha Realms support and if you remember
8384320	8386320	correctly Minecraft Realms is that new
8386320	8388320	Mojang
8388320	8390320	run private servers basically
8390320	8392320	and it will support
8392320	8394320	online play for up to 10 players
8394320	8396320	simultaneously within a single
8396320	8398320	world and allow you to collaborate on
8398320	8400320	projects and stuff like that and the
8400320	8402320	alpha version is free
8402320	8404320	and I guess it will be an optional paid
8404320	8406320	service later on also they've
8406320	8408320	added eggs, milk, cake
8408320	8410320	and fire to the game
8410320	8412320	you know so that you can
8412320	8414320	you can make cake
8414320	8416320	so
8416320	8418320	glad to see that the
8418320	8420320	Android version is getting some updates
8420320	8422320	I wish that I know one of the things that they're working
8422320	8424320	on and I don't think it's happened yet is controller
8424320	8426320	support for that because if that's the case then I
8426320	8428320	can sideload that onto my Ouya and play with the
8428320	8430320	controller and it would be fantastic
8430320	8432320	and oh god
8432320	8434320	dammit I knew there were some I forgot nephews of the week
8434320	8436320	but I'll mention it real quickly since they're talking about Minecraft
8436320	8438320	what the hell the fucking vog network
8438320	8440320	Minecraft server host
8440320	8442320	is absolute shit
8442320	8444320	and it's been down for five days now
8444320	8446320	and I've sent you a bunch
8446320	8448320	of support tickets to them
8448320	8450320	no fucking response back
8450320	8452320	but they sure as hell took out the money
8452320	8454320	out of my account this weekend
8454320	8456320	to pay for it so I'm looking
8456320	8458320	there's three magic words
8458320	8460320	that will get action
8460320	8462320	Better Business Bureau
8462320	8464320	so I'm gonna be
8464320	8466320	I'm gonna either switch the server to a new
8466320	8468320	host or I'm just gonna shut it down
8468320	8470320	because no one's really playing on it
8470320	8472320	you know I tried to log into it this week
8472320	8474320	I played last week
8474320	8476320	but it's just not a lot of people on there
8476320	8478320	so it's you know even though it's ten bucks a month
8478320	8480320	it's just you know
8480320	8482320	I'll give you five dollars
8482320	8484320	no one plays, it goes down
8484320	8486320	alright
8486320	8488320	one more news story for you guys
8488320	8490320	and I think this is appropriate
8490320	8492320	as a final news story tonight
8492320	8494320	and I know Dark Soccer will be excited about this
8494320	8496320	what?
8496320	8498320	this is a game that was announced by The Game Atlier
8498320	8500320	they developed a game called Sunflowers
8500320	8502320	well they have announced
8502320	8504320	a little arcade style
8504320	8506320	cute em up
8506320	8508320	it's called Flying Hamster HD
8508320	8510320	and it's coming to the Playstation Vita
8510320	8512320	on June 11th
8512320	8514320	well that doesn't mean no good
8514320	8516320	well and they have announced
8516320	8518320	they have announced that this game is inspired by
8518320	8520320	and this is why Dark Soccer is excited
8520320	8522320	it's inspired by Konami's Parodius series
8522320	8524320	here's some gameplay
8524320	8526320	a little Flying Hamster
8526320	8528320	oh that's awesome
8528320	8530320	and if you want to play it though
8530320	8532320	oh nice
8534320	8536320	I like the little Egyptian penguin
8536320	8538320	super cute
8538320	8540320	I wanna fight the hell
8540320	8542320	so this is super cute
8542320	8544320	it is cute
8544320	8546320	and you gotta love somebody who says they're inspired by Parodius right?
8546320	8548320	Parodius is like one of the best games ever
8548320	8550320	online leaderboards
8550320	8552320	unlockable trophies
8552320	8554320	and all that fun stuff
8554320	8556320	on the Playstation Network
8556320	8558320	the game is also on the Playstation mini service
8558320	8560320	the original
8560320	8562320	Flying Hamster is on the minis
8562320	8564320	so that's pretty cool
8564320	8566320	it has fat mermaids
8566320	8568320	that's also a great little indie
8568320	8570320	you might not have noticed that otherwise title
8570320	8572320	so I'm really glad we're getting a little bit of a spotlight on that
8572320	8574320	very cool
8574320	8576320	so Dark Soccer is thinking about getting a Vita for that
8576320	8578320	no I'm not
8578320	8580320	it's downloaded on your iPad
8580320	8582320	alright, I think it's about time to open up the Skypline
8582320	8584320	because I'm sorry, nothing is Pentaro
8584320	8586320	let's open up the Skypline
8586320	8588320	1-877-GAME-OLR

8598320	8600320	but bonus points if you do
8600320	8602320	maybe you have something to say
8602320	8604320	about all this Xbox One business
8604320	8606320	I'm sure some of our regular callers have an opinion
8606320	8608320	or three, or five, or ten
8608320	8610320	on what we talked about at the very beginning of the show
8610320	8612320	or maybe there's something else completely different we've missed
8612320	8614320	we wanna hear from you guys
8614320	8616320	on GameOLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio
8616320	8618320	and look at that
8618320	8620320	it's already ringing
8620320	8622320	already got calls coming in tonight, let's go to it
8622320	8624320	hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
8624320	8626320	it's a sobered up Rama
8626320	8628320	I'm sorry to hear that
8628320	8630320	how are you otherwise, Rama?
8630320	8632320	I'm doing pretty good, how about y'all out there in California?
8632320	8634320	hot!
8634320	8636320	actually, today was better
8636320	8638320	I had chocolate, and I'm happy
8638320	8640320	yeah, I've calmed down a little bit
8640320	8642320	yesterday was 110, tomorrow is going to be 80
8642320	8644320	go fig
8644320	8646320	yep
8646320	8648320	well, what's new with you, Rama, why'd you call in tonight?
8648320	8650320	a couple of things, but
8650320	8652320	before I get into it, um, hey, Ookchan
8652320	8654320	huh
8654320	8656320	looks like at Otacon this year we may be
8656320	8658320	bringing Rama one half back
8658320	8660320	yay!
8660320	8662320	yes, a few of us are doing a quick impromptu
8662320	8664320	group photo
8664320	8666320	well, send me a copy of it
8666320	8668320	definitely, too bad I can't come with my spatula
8668320	8670320	well, and if we have to
8670320	8672320	we'll pack you in a box
8672320	8674320	I wish I could go, I really do
8674320	8676320	but unfortunately, money, blah blah
8676320	8678320	okay, okay
8678320	8680320	okay, this is the real reason
8680320	8682320	why I called
8682320	8684320	number one, I understand what everyone
8684320	8686320	says about the Xbox One, but
8686320	8688320	truth be told, it's still
8688320	8690320	going to sell, because they're going to have
8690320	8692320	these top tier titles
8692320	8694320	and you have to forget
8694320	8696320	half the gamers in
8696320	8698320	video gaming fandom are lemmings
8698320	8700320	they will say one thing
8700320	8702320	and then after the presentation you see all these
8702320	8704320	games, it'll be like, shut up and take
8704320	8706320	my money
8706320	8708320	couldn't you say the same thing about Nintendo's
8708320	8710320	Wii U, though?
8710320	8712320	yes, I can say that about every single gaming console
8712320	8714320	but then what happens after
8714320	8716320	that? The Nintendo fanboys have bought
8716320	8718320	the Wii U and they're still calling it a failure
8718320	8720320	you know, I still think the jury's
8720320	8722320	out on that to give it another holiday season
8722320	8724320	before we, you know,
8724320	8726320	build its coffin, but
8726320	8728320	uh,
8728320	8730320	I don't know, why do you think
8730320	8732320	that is?
8734320	8736320	It's the way people
8736320	8738320	think, and I'm kind of reminded
8738320	8740320	from back in the days of everybody was
8740320	8742320	importing the DDR in the Beatmania
8742320	8744320	game to then when Konami started bringing over
8744320	8746320	DDR and people
8746320	8748320	got pissed at certain titles were not
8748320	8750320	in the US releases, they were like, I'm not going
8750320	8752320	to buy it, the game comes out, they
8752320	8754320	buy it anyway to support
8754320	8756320	their fandom. As for these next-gen
8756320	8758320	consoles, one of the reasons why people are going to
8758320	8760320	buy them is to support the console, they think it's going
8760320	8762320	to work. To be fair, buddy,
8762320	8764320	you're talking about a $40 game versus a
8764320	8766320	$500 console, potentially, potentially.
8766320	8768320	I know, but it's how some people
8768320	8770320	think, and that's kind of scary.
8770320	8772320	Yeah. And
8772320	8774320	with the fact that Microsoft's bringing up
8774320	8776320	so many servers, I don't think
8776320	8778320	there's going to be that big of an issue of server downtime.
8778320	8780320	You don't?
8780320	8782320	I don't think so.
8782320	8784320	I don't think Blizzard or EA thought so either.
8784320	8786320	That's my worry.
8786320	8788320	Well, maybe
8788320	8790320	I don't know how many servers
8790320	8792320	other manufacturers have, but I have this feeling
8792320	8794320	Microsoft's going to have like the most, and they said
8794320	8796320	straight up, they're going to bring up all these
8796320	8798320	servers ahead of time. So I'm guessing
8798320	8800320	some of the mistakes with EA and Blizzard
8800320	8802320	were doing with servers, so who
8802320	8804320	knows? So where's your head
8804320	8806320	out with Xbox One after all of
8806320	8808320	this?
8808320	8810320	I said before, shut up and take my money
8810320	8812320	for a PS4, but you know what? I'm going
8812320	8814320	to wait until after the presentations and see what
8814320	8816320	everybody has to say, and then make my decision.
8816320	8818320	Based off games are most
8818320	8820320	important?
8820320	8822320	Not really. It's like games,
8822320	8824320	technology, functionality, a little bit of everything.
8824320	8826320	Let me ask you one more
8826320	8828320	question, because I know you're a long time listener to this
8828320	8830320	show. Were you here at the very beginning of the show, or did you come in
8830320	8832320	late tonight? I was here at the very beginning of the
8832320	8834320	show. Okay. I wouldn't judge you if you were late,
8834320	8836320	but I just want to know, earlier in the show I asked
8836320	8838320	Dark Sakura about the golden rule of gaming,
8838320	8840320	and we kind of came to a consensus that
8840320	8842320	perhaps the golden rule of gaming, a system
8842320	8844320	is only as good as the games that are on it, could be
8844320	8846320	evolving. What do you think?
8846320	8848320	I think
8848320	8850320	so too, because
8850320	8852320	that golden rule is the reason why I got
8852320	8854320	a 360 before the PS3.
8854320	8856320	Because people are going to argue,
8856320	8858320	why did you get that next gen console?
8858320	8860320	All these cool games
8860320	8862320	were on that one, and the answer is, well,
8862320	8864320	those games are not games
8864320	8866320	I would particularly like to play.
8866320	8868320	The games that I've played and I've enjoyed
8868320	8870320	are on this console. This console is going to
8870320	8872320	offer these games I am interested in,
8872320	8874320	which is why I'm going to buy it.
8874320	8876320	YYR
8876320	8878320	in our chat saying, having to start all over
8878320	8880320	will make the new consoles even more expensive.
8880320	8882320	New controllers, new accessories, new
8882320	8884320	games, this is going to be expensive.
8884320	8886320	If the consoles are $500 or so, the
8886320	8888320	real cost will be a few hundred more than that.
8888320	8890320	I don't think it's a given that they'll buy it.
8890320	8892320	Well,
8892320	8894320	I still remember when I was
8894320	8896320	working at Staples, I looked outside
8896320	8898320	the long line of people across the street at
8898320	8900320	Circuit City for the
8900320	8902320	$500 and $600 PlayStation 3.
8902320	8904320	That's true, there'll be an audience
8904320	8906320	somewhere, but will it be big enough?
8906320	8908320	That's the question. Alright, Brahma, I gotta
8908320	8910320	let you go to get more calls, but any other thoughts before I let you go?
8910320	8912320	Yeah,
8912320	8914320	I'm sorry, but this is the thing. I don't know if
8914320	8916320	you heard, but GameStop had a
8916320	8918320	special this week on Injustice
8918320	8920320	Gods Among Men.
8920320	8922320	You mean Gods Among Us, but yes.
8922320	8924320	$10, one hour
8924320	8926320	sale only. So many people
8926320	8928320	flooded the site to try to buy it
8928320	8930320	online. What I found out about this,
8930320	8932320	I went and I printed out the
8932320	8934320	paper. When I got out of class, I
8934320	8936320	went down to Best Buy, and I
8936320	8938320	got them to price match a $60
8938320	8940320	game for $10
8940320	8942320	that happened about two and a half
8942320	8944320	hours after the sale ended. Nice work.
8946320	8948320	Did you enjoy the game?
8948320	8950320	Yes, it's one of the few games where I
8950320	8952320	actually enjoyed it because I was playing it
8952320	8954320	more for the story than anything else.
8954320	8956320	As coming from someone who
8956320	8958320	does not believe in paying
8958320	8960320	retail price for a game unless you can
8960320	8962320	get it to knock down, I honestly
8962320	8964320	say the game
8964320	8966320	is worth $50
8966320	8968320	at least. I can't see myself
8968320	8970320	paying $59. I see myself paying
8970320	8972320	$49 or maybe $54, but
8972320	8974320	full retail, no. It is a
8974320	8976320	tricky line once you break that $50 barrier.
8976320	8978320	It's something psychological about it, but
8978320	8980320	we could do a whole other episode on that.
8980320	8982320	But I should let you go for now, Rama.
8982320	8984320	Everybody listen to Anime Jam Session.
8984320	8986320	You got it. We'll be talking
8986320	8988320	about Denver Comic Con and Anime Next on Tuesday.
8988320	8990320	Wow, you guys got a busy show. Alright, have a good
8990320	8992320	one, buddy. You too. Bye.
8992320	8994320	Alright.
8994320	8996320	That's right. Even though we've been talking a lot
8996320	8998320	on this show about E3, there's
8998320	9000320	lots of other nerd shows at the Voice of Geeks Network
9000320	9002320	talking about other stuff. So there's anime conventions going on.
9002320	9004320	I'm sure somebody's going to be talking about
9004320	9006320	Apple stuff on Monday, so
9006320	9008320	stay tuned for that and all the great
9008320	9010320	shows on the Voice of Geeks Network at vognetwork.com
9010320	9012320	Let's go to the phones
9012320	9014320	which are lighting up and take another call.
9014320	9016320	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
9016320	9018320	This
9018320	9020320	is YYR. I just
9020320	9022320	called to drop this rhyme.
9022320	9024320	Haha, I'm a troll.
9028320	9030320	We're going to have to have
9030320	9032320	haiku call night at some point, and
9032320	9034320	everybody will have to do that.
9034320	9036320	Well played, my friend. Well played.
9036320	9038320	I'm tipping my hat to you. You just can't
9038320	9040320	see it.
9040320	9042320	Rob's hat is invisible and intangible.
9042320	9044320	Actually, that's really the only reason I called
9044320	9046320	it. That's right. Well, since I have
9046320	9048320	a captive audience, how is
9048320	9050320	bungee ferret tossing going?
9050320	9052320	Haha.
9052320	9054320	It's beer money. Beer money is great
9054320	9056320	because it buys beer.
9056320	9058320	But I don't think
9058320	9060320	you've seen the last of bungee ferret tossing.
9060320	9062320	I'm
9062320	9064320	deep in other projects right now
9064320	9066320	such as ports to
9066320	9068320	the smartphones and tablets I
9068320	9070320	like to complain about, but
9070320	9072320	I think at some point I would love
9072320	9074320	to revisit that universe, yes.
9074320	9076320	Wow, okay. Very cool.
9076320	9078320	What do you think about the way
9078320	9080320	there's been a lot of news about Xbox One
9080320	9082320	is kind of shafting indies or whatever.
9082320	9084320	I mean, as somebody who developed
9084320	9086320	quite a bit, you did several games, not just
9086320	9088320	bungee ferret tossing, but I know you had Snake 360
9088320	9090320	and Falling. You did a few games for
9090320	9092320	the XNA
9092320	9094320	or Xbox Live
9094320	9096320	indie games. What do you think about all this news
9096320	9098320	about Xbox One?
9098320	9100320	Well, I mean, as far as
9100320	9102320	indie games in general
9102320	9104320	specifically, Microsoft
9104320	9106320	already said they're not going to allow anyone to
9106320	9108320	self-publish on one
9108320	9110320	at first. And
9110320	9112320	I think that's a game changer
9112320	9114320	especially when Sony has
9114320	9116320	come out and said, yes, if you want to self-publish
9116320	9118320	come to us. PS4
9118320	9120320	will be happy to
9120320	9122320	host your self-published game.
9122320	9124320	And of course Nintendo is
9124320	9126320	welcoming
9126320	9128320	self-publishing on
9128320	9130320	Wii U as well to some degree.
9130320	9132320	I think you still need a business address
9132320	9134320	to be a developer for a Nintendo platform.
9134320	9136320	But besides that
9136320	9138320	yeah,
9138320	9140320	it seems that
9140320	9142320	Microsoft
9142320	9144320	is going to be the least indie-friendly
9144320	9146320	next-gen console out of the
9146320	9148320	gate. So with that
9148320	9150320	in mind, I think that
9150320	9152320	depending on how much indie games
9152320	9154320	influence
9154320	9156320	the next console generation
9156320	9158320	that may not matter at all or it may
9158320	9160320	matter a lot. It's all going to
9160320	9162320	depend on how big of a blip
9162320	9164320	on the radar indie games are
9164320	9166320	over the next console gen.
9166320	9168320	Before I let you go
9168320	9170320	It's crazy.
9170320	9172320	It's absolutely crazy.
9172320	9174320	And I think
9174320	9176320	all eyes are going to be on Sony
9176320	9178320	at that after-conference
9178320	9180320	presser.
9180320	9182320	Is PS4 going to be like
9182320	9184320	this? Is it going to be like that?
9184320	9186320	Is it going to allow us to do this?
9186320	9188320	And the answers given there are really going to make
9188320	9190320	a big difference as far as how people
9190320	9192320	perceive not just the
9192320	9194320	Xbox One, but all of the new
9194320	9196320	consoles, really.
9196320	9198320	I mean, literally, tomorrow
9198320	9200320	12 hours away is a huge
9200320	9202320	day in gaming.
9202320	9204320	One of the biggest ever.
9204320	9206320	I'll be on the edge
9206320	9208320	of my seat and I know probably
9208320	9210320	all of us will be to some
9210320	9212320	extent, yes.
9212320	9214320	I don't know, I'm going to take a nap.
9214320	9216320	Before I let you go, buddy,
9216320	9218320	I always kind of like to ask this. I know you just
9218320	9220320	called in to give a haiku and here we are with an interview,
9220320	9222320	but outside of developing
9222320	9224320	your own stuff, what games are you playing?
9224320	9226320	What are you enjoying playing lately?
9226320	9228320	I've been playing a lot of Tekken
9228320	9230320	lately. I actually
9230320	9232320	bought the Wii U version just
9232320	9234320	out of curiosity and
9234320	9236320	I can say
9236320	9238320	Tekken Ball, I don't know
9238320	9240320	who remembers the Tekken Ball
9240320	9242320	minigame in Tekken 3.
9242320	9244320	Totally do.
9244320	9246320	Yeah, they basically
9246320	9248320	updated it graphically and now
9248320	9250320	you can actually select
9250320	9252320	different balls to use and
9252320	9254320	the difference is basically in how
9254320	9256320	fast they move, how
9256320	9258320	quickly they charge up damage.
9258320	9260320	So it's a little bit more customizable
9260320	9262320	than it was before and of course you can use
9262320	9264320	tag teams, which is for
9264320	9266320	Tekken Ball, mostly useless, but
9266320	9268320	it's fun anyway.
9268320	9270320	So that is pretty much
9270320	9272320	the major addition to
9272320	9274320	the Tekken on Wii U.
9274320	9276320	The mushroom battle that
9276320	9278320	everyone made such a big deal about and looks like
9278320	9280320	so much fun in videos, it's really not all
9280320	9282320	it's cracked up to be.
9282320	9284320	I mean, it's fun
9284320	9286320	for like five minutes, but after the
9286320	9288320	novelty wears off, because basically
9288320	9290320	it's like the poison mushrooms
9290320	9292320	that shrink you
9292320	9294320	and the super mushrooms that
9294320	9296320	grow you, the poison mushrooms
9296320	9298320	also hurt you and
9298320	9300320	the damage is really high to begin
9300320	9302320	with, so it's like
9302320	9304320	you get a couple mushrooms and already
9304320	9306320	one more hit and you're dead.
9306320	9308320	So it's over way too quickly and
9308320	9310320	you can't play it online and you
9310320	9312320	can't use tag teams and it's
9312320	9314320	just not that great.
9314320	9316320	And also online, not too many people
9316320	9318320	playing for reasons that you could probably
9318320	9320320	guess, but other than that
9320320	9322320	it's the same game.
9322320	9324320	Alright, well I haven't
9324320	9326320	played a lot of Tekken in a while, so maybe I should
9326320	9328320	maybe I should rent
9328320	9330320	Tekken on Nintendo Wii U since my Wii
9330320	9332320	will allow me to do that.
9332320	9334320	The actual last one that I
9334320	9336320	bought was Tekken 4. I am warning you though
9336320	9338320	Tekken has gotten extremely complex
9338320	9340320	over the years, so
9340320	9342320	the learning curve is as steep now
9342320	9344320	as it ever was, or possibly
9344320	9346320	steeper. So as long as you're okay with that
9346320	9348320	you know, enjoy. Enjoy your
9348320	9350320	rental that you can actually do.
9350320	9352320	Alright, well alright, take care buddy, I'm gonna
9352320	9354320	let you go to see if we can get one more call, but
9354320	9356320	enjoy all the E3 stuff this week and
9356320	9358320	we'll talk to you later.
9358320	9360320	Well we'll either enjoy it or not enjoy it,
9360320	9362320	one of those. That's true, this is the first
9362320	9364320	Alright, you too.
9364320	9366320	This is the first year where
9366320	9368320	we can't necessarily say we're gonna enjoy it, are we?
9368320	9370320	Alright, 1877 game
9370320	9372320	OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio
9372320	9374320	We got time for about one more call here
9374320	9376320	Any last minute stories
9376320	9378320	while we're waiting for calls?
9378320	9380320	Yes, actually I do have one.
9380320	9382320	It's a hack that was done
9382320	9384320	for New Super Mario Brothers
9384320	9386320	on the Wii
9386320	9388320	and it's just been released. It's a total
9388320	9390320	conversion for the game called Newer Super Mario
9390320	9392320	Brothers. 120 all new
9392320	9394320	levels, remixed and original
9394320	9396320	graphics to the game, themes
9396320	9398320	and music, classic
9398320	9400320	power-ups, also
9400320	9402320	new bosses and that kind of stuff
9402320	9404320	and you can get it if you have a
9404320	9406320	homebrew-enabled Wii.
9406320	9408320	There's no piracy or hardware mods
9408320	9410320	needed, so
9410320	9412320	I believe it's just a save
9412320	9414320	file that you put on there
9414320	9416320	and you can download that at
9416320	9418320	NewerTeam.com
9418320	9420320	That's where you can find that.
9422320	9424320	Is that it? I'm trying to pull up
9424320	9426320	Twitter here. I've been looking at the
9426320	9428320	Xbox 720 checkpoint
9428320	9430320	thing that came out last year. Remember the whole
9430320	9432320	leak about VR and stuff
9432320	9434320	and a lot of it sounds exactly
9434320	9436320	what they're talking about right now, so who knows?
9436320	9438320	Next year maybe we might see some sort of Xbox
9438320	9440320	glasses or something.
9440320	9442320	Straight up even to the
9444320	9446320	slogan
9446320	9448320	that makes no fucking sense.
9448320	9450320	Next Generation Entertainment, one box
9450320	9452320	input one.
9452320	9454320	Like why
9454320	9456320	would you even do that?
9456320	9458320	I don't know.
9458320	9460320	Alright.
9460320	9462320	Let's take another call.
9462320	9464320	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
9466320	9468320	Hi, this is Raginator.
9468320	9470320	Hey Raginator. I was going to say I didn't see the
9470320	9472320	cam come on at first. There it is. What's up
9472320	9474320	Raginator?
9474320	9476320	Just a quick question.
9476320	9478320	It's kind of a loaded one.
9478320	9480320	You kind of touched
9480320	9482320	on something I'll be briefly
9482320	9484320	earlier during the show.
9484320	9486320	Rare is
9486320	9488320	kind of hinted that
9488320	9490320	they're working on something and everyone's
9490320	9492320	speculating their
9492320	9494320	necessity to all franchise.
9494320	9496320	Most people seem to think
9496320	9498320	it's going to be either Conquer or
9498320	9500320	Kill Instinct. What are
9500320	9502320	your thoughts on that?
9502320	9504320	Well
9504320	9506320	we had a screenshot that was leaked
9506320	9508320	but again
9508320	9510320	it's one of those anybody could have with a
9510320	9512320	Photoshop. Oh did they prove it fake?
9512320	9514320	Yeah. Proved it fake?
9514320	9516320	You're talking about the one that had like Banjo-Kazooie
9516320	9518320	Yeah it was fake because they had
9518320	9520320	that Microsoft
9520320	9522320	game. The Halo
9522320	9524320	Spartan
9524320	9526320	Assault or whatever but the logo was different.
9526320	9528320	And it's because that stuff that
9528320	9530320	they got on there was either
9530320	9532320	wishful thinking and trademarks that they had
9532320	9534320	already done.
9534320	9536320	It wasn't anything new. It was fake.
9536320	9538320	So it's not
9538320	9540320	it's not going to be Banjo-Kazooie. I don't think it would be
9540320	9542320	Banjo-Kazooie anyways because it wouldn't be that big a deal.
9542320	9544320	It would be just kind of like ehhhh
9544320	9546320	whatever because they had a new Banjo game and it was
9546320	9548320	just it was alright but
9548320	9550320	I'm going to go with the easy answer
9550320	9552320	and say Killer Instinct based off
9552320	9554320	the whole trademark dispute that they
9554320	9556320	got settled. There wouldn't have
9556320	9558320	been a reason to do that otherwise I don't think
9558320	9560320	if they didn't want to keep that door open for some reason.
9560320	9562320	And I think they know that's what
9562320	9564320	everybody wants and
9564320	9566320	especially with where they're going with all this
9566320	9568320	DRM debacle
9568320	9570320	it's going to take a franchise like that
9570320	9572320	to make people
9572320	9574320	what's it going to take for you to sell your morals
9574320	9576320	up the river? Essentially.
9576320	9578320	And I mean
9578320	9580320	honestly if Xbox could come out
9580320	9582320	and say you know what we're going to have
9582320	9584320	we're going to have Rob's Fantasy games
9584320	9586320	Mass Effect 4
9586320	9588320	The Guardian Legend 2 and the things I
9588320	9590320	want to see it's going to be hard for me
9590320	9592320	to even go God I fucking
9592320	9594320	hate what they're doing but I really really really
9594320	9596320	want these games it's going to be hard it's easy for
9596320	9598320	me to sit here now and go I don't
9598320	9600320	need Halo 5
9600320	9602320	I don't need a new Killer Instinct
9602320	9604320	I don't need some of
9604320	9606320	this other stuff they're talking about because
9606320	9608320	I can kind of be satisfied with Playstation 4
9608320	9610320	Well and technically we don't need any of it
9610320	9612320	we need air and water
9612320	9614320	No I need Guardian Legend 2
9614320	9616320	Jamie I need it. Rob
9616320	9618320	I need it. Rob. I need it!
9618320	9620320	Intervention! What about you Jamie?
9620320	9622320	What? A rare franchise
9622320	9624320	that's coming back
9624320	9626320	Killer Instinct?
9626320	9628320	How about you Raginator?
9628320	9630320	Well I
9630320	9632320	would love to see another Killer
9632320	9634320	Instinct. God only knows
9634320	9636320	I played the Jesus out
9636320	9638320	of the
9638320	9640320	SNES port
9640320	9642320	along with the
9642320	9644320	N64 game
9644320	9646320	but I'm a little concerned because
9646320	9648320	you know
9648320	9650320	the history has shown that
9650320	9652320	both first priorities and
9652320	9654320	third priorities tend to
9654320	9656320	really
9656320	9658320	go overboard
9658320	9660320	screw with
9660320	9662320	a proven formula
9662320	9664320	and
9664320	9666320	when
9666320	9668320	they screw with
9668320	9670320	a given formula that's proven
9670320	9672320	to be a winner
9672320	9674320	a lot of people tend to revolve
9674320	9676320	Case is a point
9676320	9678320	Capcom screwed with
9678320	9680320	you know
9680320	9682320	the Final Fight with
9682320	9684320	Streetwise for the PS2
9684320	9686320	turned the 2D
9686320	9688320	brawler into a 3D brawler
9688320	9690320	that didn't do too well
9690320	9692320	they also
9692320	9694320	screwed with Street Fighter
9694320	9696320	and came out with the
9696320	9698320	EX series
9698320	9700320	didn't do too well
9700320	9702320	and of course there was
9702320	9704320	a whole
9704320	9706320	more common port on the
9706320	9708320	SNES which
9708320	9710320	still gets kind of
9710320	9712320	paid today
9712320	9714320	In defense of the Street Fighter
9714320	9716320	EX series EX3 was pretty good
9716320	9718320	I want to say with Capcom too since you brought up
9718320	9720320	Mega Man I think there's a very strong possibility
9720320	9722320	Mega Man fans will finally have something
9722320	9724320	to celebrate this week I don't know if that'll
9724320	9726320	just be a little victory or something but I just
9726320	9728320	think the timing is right
9728320	9730320	for Capcom to unveil what
9730320	9732320	they're going to do with Mega Man since they pretty much
9732320	9734320	said they're not killing them off
9734320	9736320	so whether that be a
9736320	9738320	reboot of Legends 3 or whatever
9738320	9740320	Mega Man 11 for god's
9740320	9742320	sake whatever they're doing I think next week
9742320	9744320	is very good for that but
9744320	9746320	you know that's an easy thing to predict
9746320	9748320	but we'll see if it actually happens
9748320	9750320	Well ultimately
9750320	9752320	if they do make a
9752320	9754320	killer receipt
9754320	9756320	I would love to see it
9756320	9758320	just don't screw it up
9758320	9760320	make minor tweaks here and there
9760320	9762320	maybe add new characters
9762320	9764320	maybe a mechanic
9764320	9766320	here or there
9766320	9768320	but don't go radically changing
9768320	9770320	the game to the point where
9770320	9772320	it's basically
9772320	9774320	a totally different game
9774320	9776320	it's only related to
9776320	9778320	previous games by name only
9778320	9780320	Alright
9780320	9782320	Well Raginator before I let you go here tonight I
9782320	9784320	noticed that you also submitted a tweet to us
9784320	9786320	at twitter.com slash o-l-r so
9786320	9788320	allow me to read
9788320	9790320	Random question
9790320	9792320	when playing Gyruss how many warps are there
9792320	9794320	to Uranus? I'm not going to say it
9794320	9796320	the other way. I asked because I just
9796320	9798320	wanted to type Uranus
9798320	9800320	well there you go and now I read it
9800320	9802320	there on air so congratulations
9802320	9804320	and if I remember right it would be 3 warps
9804320	9806320	to Neptune and then 3 more
9806320	9808320	to Uranus
9808320	9810320	6 warps
9810320	9812320	to Uranus Raginator
9812320	9814320	Yeah I know it's
9814320	9816320	I came up with something
9816320	9818320	It's alright, so's the show
9818320	9820320	so's the show Raginator
9820320	9822320	Alright have a good one buddy
9822320	9824320	Alright bye
9824320	9826320	I feel like that's like
9826320	9828320	wishing people a Merry Christmas
9828320	9830320	or Happy Hanukkah
9830320	9832320	I feel like you should wish video gamers a Happy E3
9832320	9834320	even when E3 is going to be bad news
9834320	9836320	like it's just like people fight
9836320	9838320	May you not be as disappointed
9838320	9840320	this year as you were last
9840320	9842320	What should like Happy E3
9842320	9844320	Merry E3
9844320	9846320	You're E3, what should the
9846320	9848320	greeting be to other gamers
9848320	9850320	this time of year?
9850320	9852320	Dark Soccer you're
9852320	9854320	Here's a hanky
9854320	9856320	You're our linguist
9856320	9858320	What should the greeting be to other gamers?
9858320	9860320	Blessed E3
9860320	9862320	That might be a little too much
9862320	9864320	Blessed E3
9864320	9866320	How about
9866320	9868320	How about Wink Free E3
9868320	9870320	Alright maybe I'll
9870320	9872320	throw that question to the chatters and see what they come up with
9872320	9874320	but for now I am going to close the Skype line
9874320	9876320	if you do have further thoughts on any of tonight's topics
9876320	9878320	Mailbag out
9878320	9880320	OrangeLaunchRadio.com
9880320	9882320	or Twitter.com slash O-L-R
9882320	9884320	So a screenshot leaked
9884320	9886320	from a brand new unannounced game
9886320	9888320	Oh
9888320	9890320	It's assumed, well we kind of assumed it was coming
9890320	9892320	Just Dance
9892320	9894320	the new Just Dance game
9894320	9896320	It's going to have the Ghostbusters theme in it because they have a screenshot
9896320	9898320	where people are dressed up like Ghostbusters
9898320	9900320	That's in Just Dance 4
9900320	9902320	Isn't it?
9902320	9904320	You sure about that?
9906320	9908320	Rob is up going to look by the way
9912320	9914320	Now in the chatroom by the way
9914320	9916320	we have a call for a new
9916320	9918320	Rival Schools series
9918320	9920320	Okay what are you looking at?
9920320	9922320	Just Dance 4
9922320	9924320	He's reading
9924320	9926320	It's going to take us a while because Rob's reading
9926320	9928320	Just kidding
9928320	9930320	I'm sorry Y-Y-R
9930320	9932320	I can't click YouTube
9932320	9934320	Maybe not
9934320	9936320	It's official because it's actually on
9936320	9938320	Xbox's website
9938320	9940320	So if you go to Xbox's Just Dance 2014
9940320	9942320	and they've got
9942320	9944320	Well I mean what a duh
9944320	9946320	They're going to do a new Just Dance game
9946320	9948320	I mean come on these games sell like crazy
9948320	9950320	and it's not a bad game
9950320	9952320	They have a guy that looks like Beetlejuice in here
9952320	9954320	What?
9954320	9956320	I mean that looks like Beetlejuice
9956320	9958320	I'm assuming that maybe that's
9958320	9960320	A ghost
9960320	9962320	Alright as far as the E3
9962320	9964320	greetings in our chatroom Misty says
9964320	9966320	Happy E3 I would think
9966320	9968320	Let's keep it simple why over think it
9968320	9970320	Maybe be Happy E3 Happy E3
9970320	9972320	Happy E3 I like that
9972320	9974320	Alright a couple of tweets from TigerClaw
9974320	9976320	I apologize
9976320	9978320	I don't think you read this one yet but I know it was in the
9978320	9980320	list of stories we just didn't get to it tonight
9980320	9982320	TigerClaw talking about
9982320	9984320	Mad Catz readying an Android console
9984320	9986320	of their own. Is this like an Ouya
9986320	9988320	type response? No they are yeah
9988320	9990320	It's not like the Ouya
9990320	9992320	Actually I like the idea
9992320	9994320	a lot better than the Ouya
9994320	9996320	It's basically going to be a console that plays
9996320	9998320	Android games. It has the Google Play
9998320	10000320	Store and it plays any Android game
10000320	10002320	and you can actually map buttons
10002320	10004320	onto stuff
10004320	10006320	So games that don't support touch or whatever
10006320	10008320	you can use a mouse with them
10008320	10010320	or do support touch
10010320	10012320	you can use a mouse or you can use analog sticks
10012320	10014320	to emulate touch
10014320	10016320	but
10016320	10018320	the fact that it doesn't require any special
10018320	10020320	games it's just the games that you have
10020320	10022320	or the games that you buy for like a dollar
10022320	10024320	or free or whatever so I like that
10024320	10026320	and their controller looks nice too
10026320	10028320	it looks like an Xbox 360 controller
10028320	10030320	actually it looks exactly like their
10030320	10032320	their Xbox 360 controller
10032320	10034320	their
10034320	10036320	MLG controller
10036320	10038320	it looks exactly like that
10038320	10040320	and one other tweet from TigerClaw tonight about
10040320	10042320	Interplay getting an IP from THQ
10042320	10044320	for $7,500
10044320	10046320	that's how much they
10046320	10048320	paid for FreeSpace
10048320	10050320	that's a good deal
10050320	10052320	that's a great deal
10052320	10054320	Interstellar Combat series that was developed by
10054320	10056320	Volition and published by Interplay
10056320	10058320	it's back in Interplay's library
10058320	10060320	after getting it back from THQ
10060320	10062320	so there you go
10062320	10064320	Interplay by the way it should be noted
10064320	10066320	they never did lose the rights to sell
10066320	10068320	Descent FreeSpace and FreeSpace 2
10068320	10070320	there you go
10070320	10072320	I want another Descent that is awesome
10072320	10074320	that required more buttons than
10074320	10076320	the other Descent games
10076320	10078320	that would be awesome
10078320	10080320	that required telekinesis to play
10080320	10082320	alright well thank you guys very much for your tweets
10082320	10084320	at twitter.com slash o-l-r
10084320	10086320	lots of great stuff tonight but
10086320	10088320	it's about that time we gotta wrap up the show
10088320	10090320	and get everybody's final thought
10090320	10092320	and all that
10092320	10094320	we have a consensus in the chat room, Rival Schools is awesome
10094320	10096320	Rival Schools is awesome
10096320	10098320	we'll put that on your list list, too late
10098320	10100320	well, okay, you know what
10102320	10104320	I actually, when I had
10104320	10106320	a lot more disposable income I paid
10106320	10108320	99 bucks to import
10108320	10110320	the Justice Gakuen Evolution
10110320	10112320	and I played the hell out of it
10112320	10114320	for days, but it's like
10114320	10116320	every time they would bring out
10116320	10118320	like one of the games for home they'd take out
10118320	10120320	something from the Japanese version that made it awesome
10120320	10122320	like the board game mode
10122320	10124320	in Project Justice
10124320	10126320	after you played through the board game
10126320	10128320	your custom character
10128320	10130320	that you played the board game with would have stats
10130320	10132320	based on how you played the game
10132320	10134320	and they just took that out
10134320	10136320	well guys
10136320	10138320	before I let you go tonight I just want to say
10138320	10140320	happy three and let's hope that
10140320	10142320	let's hope the news isn't too terrible
10142320	10144320	let's hope there's a lot of good surprises and things
10144320	10146320	that we will be excited about
10146320	10148320	I will be here during the day tomorrow
10148320	10150320	during the press conferences and I'll be around Tuesday too
10150320	10152320	I will make a point to be in chat
10152320	10154320	if you want some folks to talk
10154320	10156320	about the conferences, you want a live
10156320	10158320	blog, not really live blogging
10158320	10160320	because I kind of think everybody's
10160320	10162320	kind of watching it, but more like live discussion
10162320	10164320	if you want to talk about what's going on
10164320	10166320	at E3 with some like-minded individuals
10166320	10168320	I urge you to be at live.vognetwork.com
10168320	10170320	I'll be there during the big press conferences
10170320	10172320	tomorrow and we can talk
10172320	10174320	about it and kind of discuss
10174320	10176320	are you going to be there too?
10176320	10178320	Yes, because my boss is gone
10178320	10180320	so I don't have to really work that
10180320	10182320	it's all work related anyways, come on
10182320	10184320	I'll be there at least for Microsoft and Sony
10184320	10186320	but in the middle of the day Dark Soccer and I might go on a friend date
10186320	10188320	to take care of some stuff around town
10188320	10190320	YYR left another haiku
10190320	10192320	Happy E3 guys, look forward to
10192320	10194320	no prices and no dates either
10194320	10196320	I think we'll get those tomorrow
10196320	10198320	I think we'll get prices and dates tomorrow
10198320	10200320	I don't know
10200320	10202320	It would be a first if we did, because remember
10202320	10204320	what was the infamous thing a few years ago from Sony
10204320	10206320	$599 US dollars
10206320	10208320	$599, so I think we will get it
10208320	10210320	I'll wake up tomorrow
10210320	10212320	to care about the press releases
10212320	10214320	to get in chat as well
10214320	10216320	I've already got my popcorn
10216320	10218320	it's just stale, but I already have my popcorn
10218320	10220320	I want to go to Popcornopolis
10220320	10222320	If you want a place to just chat with some other folks
10222320	10224320	and kind of just
10224320	10226320	get some live
10226320	10228320	banter going on what's going on at E3
10228320	10230320	join us and chat
10230320	10232320	live.vognetwork.com
10232320	10234320	You never know, Bobby might pop in on a plane for all we know
10234320	10236320	from his plane, we'll see
10236320	10238320	Check out E3.vognetwork.com
10238320	10240320	I'm really excited about what this week
10240320	10242320	is going to bring and it's going to be
10242320	10244320	a great week
10244320	10246320	I guess that's it
10246320	10248320	We'll be back next week to do it all over
10248320	10250320	again as we lead up to our 11th anniversary
10250320	10252320	on June 23rd
10252320	10254320	It's time to go around and get everybody's final thought
10254320	10256320	Dark Sakura, we'll start with you tonight
10256320	10258320	your final thought
10258320	10260320	I wish I hadn't eaten all that chocolate so quickly
10260320	10262320	And my final thought tonight
10262320	10264320	is no regrets, I did eat it that quickly
10264320	10266320	and it was good
10266320	10268320	Loki, your final thought tonight
10268320	10270320	I'm looking forward to this week, I'm always excited about
10270320	10272320	E3 stuff, just disappointed that I don't get to play
10272320	10274320	and also I'm not going to be able to make it out to Best Buy
10274320	10276320	and Wednesday to play the Wii U games
10276320	10278320	because it's not a weird time, it's like a 4 o'clock
10278320	10280320	like if it was in the middle of the day I could sneak out
10280320	10282320	and do that, but the middle of the day one's on
10282320	10284320	Saturday and I'm just, I'm not going to drive
10284320	10286320	all the way to Elk Grove
10286320	10288320	No, then I'm not going to drive down the Elk Grove
10288320	10290320	to play New Super League
10290320	10292320	What if our local listeners wanted to meet you?
10293320	10295320	Eh, it's not worth it, seriously
10295320	10297320	Alright, fair enough
10297320	10299320	Thank you guys for listening to

10307320	10309320	Tell a friend or two about the show
10309320	10311320	Help us spread the word, because we don't get a big
10311320	10313320	booth at E3 to help spread the word
10313320	10315320	or any big fancy advertising budget
10315320	10317320	Any advertising you do see
10317320	10319320	comes out of our own pockets
10319320	10321320	So please, help spread the word

10351320	10353320	You may not necessarily reflect
10353320	10355320	those of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio
