13670	26776	Tonight, June 9, 2013, Microsoft's controversial announcements could change the industry forever, Zynga layoffs affect a developer they recently acquired, and E3 is next week, and we're making our predictions for the big show.
32455	37537	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37617	43259	It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 507 for this June 9th of 2013.
44940	46060	My name is Rob Roberts.
46141	48902	Joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
49222	50702	Greetings and salutations.
50802	51883	And I hope you're doing well, Ms.
51903	52163	Summers.
53237	53597	I am.
53917	54197	Good.
54498	55258	I'm caffeinated.
55278	55818	Thank you, Rob.
56038	56498	Good to hear.
56578	58759	And also joining us tonight, Tech Master Loki.
59260	63641	Yes, definitely working in that Tech Master moniker this week.
63861	64342	How so?
64462	64802	Quickly.
64922	65942	I had to fix my laptop.
66523	66803	Oh, yeah.
66823	67503	Hard drive crash.
67563	71845	Yeah, I've been following your tweets, your Twitters, and all the hard drive drama.
71865	74806	But now it works pretty much like it did before.
75086	76927	All it needed was a little reformatting.
77367	89444	Yeah, all the non-essential stuff's not working, like some of these touch buttons up the top here that I never use, or the icon's different now for the volume up and down, but eh, whatever.
89524	92227	Big week this week, E3 obviously coming up.
92828	94731	Unfortunately, none of us attending this year.
95171	97933	Bobby Blackwolf from the Voice Geeks Network at vognetwork.com.
98013	98753	He is attending.
99113	108839	And if you haven't already checked it out, do check out the interactive coverage of E3 presented in an all-new way at the Voice Geeks Network at e3.vognetwork.com.
108859	110100	Or at least we think it's an all-new way.
110120	110980	The internet's a big place.
112321	112781	Probably.
113241	114322	I haven't seen it.
130689	131529	Let's get into it, Loki.
132069	153914	So, after the whole... Well, I guess the promise was, after the Xbox One press event thing that they did back in May, that there was going to be some answers about, or clarification, I guess, on the big hot topics that they were getting grilled on after the event, basically.
155194	157876	What is the deal with, you know, the online connectivity?
157896	160198	You know, how often do I need to connect to the internet?
160558	162419	How is the used game thing going to work?
162839	169984	You know, and, you know, what's up with the Kinect having to be online all the time or attached to your system at all times of work?
170465	173647	So, on Friday, I think it was Friday.
173827	174307	Was it Friday?
174487	175128	Yeah, the 6th.
175628	177750	On Friday, no, it was Thursday.
179130	190056	On the sixth, they released a three-page document called Xbox One, Details on Connectivity, Licensing, and Privacy Features.
190636	195339	Let's go through each one, shall we?
200086	203113	Xbox One, a modern connected device.
204435	209887	And to kind of spoil everything, none of this stuff is actually sounding any good.
210007	211330	It's pretty much just...
213557	223467	The Xbox One will deliver new benefits for gamers that are only possible with a system designed from the ground up to be ready and connected.
223527	224548	Here are a few examples.
233092	234373	Make your game more powerful or something.
234753	236535	Your Xbox One is always ready.
236835	239096	It's designed to run, I guess, low power state.
241078	242339	Okay, let's get to the good part.
242979	248583	Network technologies and network requirements.
249123	249544	Here we go.
249724	254207	For an optimal experience, we recommend a broadband connection of 1.5 megabits.
255608	260031	And also, if in areas where, I guess...
261652	263533	An Ethernet connection is not available.
263573	265594	You can connect using mobile broadband.
266215	266735	Lucky you.
267415	283103	And also, while a persistent connection is not required, the Xbox One is designed to verify if the system application or game updates are needed and to see if you have acquired new games, resold or traded in games, or have given a game to a friend.
283964	287866	Games that are designed to take advantage of the cloud system may require a connection.
288906	297948	And then, of course, with Xbox One, you can game offline for up to 24 hours on your primary console or one hour if you're logged into a separate console accessing your library.
298128	304190	Offline gaming is not possible after these prescribed times until you reestablish a connection.
304670	307290	But you can still... Oh, oh, and this is the best part.
307551	308251	But guess what?
308351	313512	You can still watch live TV, enjoy your Blu-ray and DVD movies.
313732	315274	Oh, thank you, Xbox One!
315334	318798	I can still enjoy TV that you are connected to.
325225	329409	Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to mourn the loss of the gaming industry.
330050	330751	Rest in peace.
331191	332953	Alright, let's get to the next thing here.
333494	334595	Alright, so, um...
336863	340444	Next, how game licensing will work on the Xbox One.
340924	343605	And I'm glad that they have to tell me how it's going to work.
344425	352386	Okay, so basically you buy the games the way you want, disc or digital, and you'll be able to buy them through traditional retailers or online through Xbox Live.
353027	356447	And it says, discs will continue to be a great way to install your game quickly.
356587	359008	Yes, to install, not play off of install.
360549	371334	You can access your entire games library from any Xbox One, no discs required.
372614	376036	You can share access with your games to everyone inside your home.
376456	381018	Your friends, family, guests, and acquaintances get unlimited access to all your games.
381198	384720	Anyone can play your games on your console regardless of whether you are logged in
385340	386421	or their relationship to you.
386801	391663	In other words, a feature that's been available on console gaming since the beginning of time.
393244	399587	That yes, if I bring a friend over, that they can play on the Xbox One without it going, hey, who are you?
400028	402369	What are you doing trying to touch my controller and play this game?
404750	406471	Get your hands off my controller.
407291	408152	I need an adult.
409675	418084	Um, you could share access, oh, let's see, uh, give your family access to your entire games library anytime, anywhere.
418124	419105	Now, this is kind of weird.
419665	425872	The Xbox One, I guess, they're going to have a way where up to ten people of your family, or whoever you're saying is your family...
426312	431133	can log in and play from your shared games library on any Xbox One.
431553	443035	So if I buy a copy of, say, Forza Motorsports or something like that, someone else can go to a friend's house or whatever or from their own location and play that copy of Forza as well.
443455	446336	But only one person can play at a time.
446516	447056	And not at launch.
447616	449696	None of this is available at launch.
449876	451756	All the good stuff, all the pros, not at launch.
451936	453057	I don't know if that's available at launch.
453997	454337	Doesn't say.
455438	459863	Trade in and resell your disc-based games.
460804	465850	Today, some gamers choose to sell their old disc-based games back for cash and credit.
465950	472979	We've designed the Xbox Ones so game publishers can enable you to trade in your games at participating retailers.
473499	475119	So it's an optional feature.
475340	478060	So no eBay, gone.
478560	480261	No flea markets, gone.
480721	482441	No garage sales, gone.
482902	485842	Authorized retailers only if the publisher allows it.
486302	489203	It's now not my choice on what I'm going to do with my game.
489343	493004	It's now Microsoft's choice or the publisher's choice on what I'm going to do with my game.
493024	493404	But we don't own it.
493424	494144	We're licensing it.
494284	494645	That's right.
494665	496085	It was never ours to begin with.
498545	504116	I don't sign a form when I'm playing these games, although I'm sure you're going to have to agree to it when you install your game.
504176	504737	Oh, sure.
505018	509947	Press A to agree to the 500-page terms and conditions, or you won't be able to play anything.
510288	510929	This thing's a brick.
512015	519541	Let's see, Microsoft does not charge a platform fee to retailers, publishers, or consumers for enabling transfer of these games.
520742	529849	Which, I don't know, kind of goes against what I've heard, what we've been hearing rumors-wise, but maybe it's not Microsoft charging them, maybe it's the publishers charging these guys, I don't really know.
530289	531270	Whatever, that doesn't...
532651	532911	All right.
533472	535113	So what are the key points out of this whole thing?
535133	537775	Because we got to get to the bottom line here.
537995	538596	Well, a couple more.
538636	538876	Okay.
538996	540637	All right.
540797	542839	They're going to allow you to give your games to a friend.
542919	545521	So you can enable your disc-based game.
546222	547362	You give it to a friend, basically.
547382	548103	There's no fees.
548904	551526	But there's two requirements in order to transfer this to your friend.
552206	567086	they have to be on your friends list for 30 days and you can only give it you can only give the game once once it's been transferred to them I don't think that they can give it back to someone else now I don't know if that's clarified if there is so no wishing for more wishes
567466	581076	Yes, but I mean, if it is where you can give it to somebody, you know, the friends listening is kind of annoying, but like say you can give it to them and then they can give it to somebody else, you know, that's not so bad, but it's still annoying.
582156	582617	You know what?
582757	584998	I will give credit where credit is due.
585098	589982	It sounds like Microsoft's trying to implement the Kindle book borrowing thing, which just sounds a lot like.
590482	592223	And I'm like, all right, that's cool.
592243	594663	Because I know I lend out a lot of video games I never get back.
594783	596324	So that's interesting.
596344	597564	They can be handled all digitally.
598085	600685	But, you know, what am I having to give up?
601306	603306	What's the minus for this plus, right?
603426	603626	Yeah.
603826	604006	Okay.
604046	605487	And last but not least, I'll just breeze through this.
605507	606227	The Kinect stuff.
607308	609508	They say you're in control of what the Kinect can see and hear.
610389	614430	Because I guess you get to adjust your privacy settings or something.
614450	614590	Yeah.
614990	621712	So the system will navigate you through key privacy options like automatic or manual sign-in, privacy settings, and clear notification of how data is used.
622693	624133	Wait, how is data being used?
624513	628775	So I'm assuming this thing is just going to be listening for advertising purposes and stuff.
629435	631856	If they hear a lot of wank, a lot of porn.
632426	637728	You're in control of the Kinect sensor sensing on, off, or pause.
638388	640229	You can turn off your Xbox One.
642530	647712	They say it's only listening for a single voice command of Xbox On, but come on.
647912	648372	I'm sorry.
648733	655315	You're in control of your personal data, and you can use other inputs to control your games, TV, and entertainment experiences.
655435	656796	So once again, why do I need the Kinect?
659629	671456	I'm gonna be honest, and I'm not trying to be that snarky kid on Twitter, but this is really kind of like a vague answer that they kind of gave to this.
671556	673858	So does it have to be on or not?
674980	681282	Well, it's basically, it has to be connected to your system, but I think you can... Point it at the wall and cover the mic?
681302	684443	You can turn your system off or something and it won't be listening.
684643	688964	Just don't underestimate the value of privacy and all that.
689044	691845	And this is really badly timed for Microsoft.
691885	694486	I mean, again... There's a lot of news that's great.
694806	696446	There's a lot of news out there right now.
696466	697526	I'm not trying to get political.
697546	698487	I'm not going to take the show there.
698587	701087	But there's a lot of news right now about privacy.
701988	703148	Microsoft's name's involved.
703408	704109	Exactly.
704249	709072	So this is not a good time to be requiring anything with that connect.
709392	709972	Just saying.
710153	718638	And they're saying that some of the examples, of course, they've mentioned before, a fitness game can measure your heart rate, give you feedback about your exercise routine or whatever.
718978	720900	You'll be able to tell if you're a communist.
720980	725202	A card game could allow you to bluff your virtual opponent using your facial expressions.
726443	731231	But once again, the Kinect could allow you to scan in your objects and use them in real games.
731932	733254	That never happens, so who knows.
733514	734656	But yeah, okay, so that's it.
734716	735898	That's basically the information.
737461	740142	Well, here's the thing.
740182	741762	You ever seen that show Shark Tank?
741942	742763	You ever watch that show?
743783	745644	Here's the premise of the show.
745684	748465	These guys pitch their ideas to all these big executives.
748485	750506	Like Mark Cuban's one of the executives that sits there.
750806	765212	It's actually, as far as reality TV goes, it's one of the better shows because it's a little more like these guys are real business makers and you kind of see, like, I don't know, there's less of the pompousness that comes with the Donald Trump business show and there's a little more, like, you know, reality, I guess, for lack of a better term.
765592	766053	DarkSakura.com
783732	791658	Well, anyway, the whole pitch is that as you're given these ideas, if one of the executives says, I'm out, that's their sign that they are not going to put a bid.
791698	796021	And if all four of them say, I'm out, the guy loses, walks away, doesn't get the financing they want.
796461	802865	And I got to admit, after listening to this whole detail thing that's gone on this week, I'm kind of sitting in that chair.
802985	812232	And when I'm hearing about the whole, here's the minuses, here's a plus in the game trading and all that, but here's all these minuses that suddenly these $60 games may not be worth anything anymore.
812252	812432	But...
812692	814574	I do not have... That's what I hate the most.
815134	817576	I no longer have the power to sell this game on eBay.
817857	821259	If I want to do it, I have to go to a GameStop or a comparable store.
821339	822080	Are you kidding me?
822380	823341	That's not what I want.
823681	825663	And that's the point where I said, I'm out.
826724	830487	And on top of that, the plus is like, oh, you can loan it to your friend.
830647	833830	Something I can do already right now with all these fucking restrictions.
835713	837995	Why do I even... And that's the thing.
838115	842118	It's so sad that this has to happen because I want to be excited about this new console.
842138	845240	I want to be excited about the games that they're coming out with.
845320	852625	But I'm sorry, even if there's like a new Crackdown game or whatever the big awesome game they're going to show us, all this stuff is just like right in front of me.
852645	855707	And it's like, well, that sounds cool, but nope.
857008	859190	To me, it's very much like how I treat Origin.
859890	861752	Battlefield 3 looks fucking amazing.
862193	863454	I really want to play that game.
863695	866378	I'm not installing Origin, so therefore I'm not going to play the game.
867098	867579	That's it.
867719	869041	I mean, it's unfortunate.
869061	873506	These games look awesome, but all this stuff stands in my way, so I'm not going to do it.
873746	876409	For me, a lot of it is kind of about control.
876589	877030	Control.
877270	898398	and I feel like what's happening this console generation that I just don't fucking like is that the publishers are trying to take all these things away from me that I used to get as the investor in the game you know what I mean like I used to be able to sell the used games and you know trade the games I wanted to and they could put in the disc or whatever like
898718	902499	The publishers have been slowly thinking of ways to take that away, and I just don't like it.
902579	910902	And look, I understand the cost of developing a game is super expensive and all that, but the line's gotta be drawn somewhere.
910922	912503	It doesn't have to be super expensive.
912543	917865	They decide to go big and, you know, big and bold, I guess, for their games.
917985	918785	It doesn't have to be.
918905	920886	Indie games that come out are still just as good.
921186	922887	How much did it cost to develop Minecraft?
922987	925728	Granted, it's not as visually stunning as something else, but
926608	927930	It doesn't have to be visually stunning.
927950	928810	It just has to be fun.
928971	929992	It has to be fun to play.
930032	931113	That's all it has to be.
950392	955136	I understand that, that this is the way the industry wants to move, but I have a right to say I'm not moving with it.
955456	956877	And I think we all have that right.
957197	960119	Well, the industries don't determine what the consumers do.
960139	962641	The consumers determine what the industry should do.
963362	971248	Well, I want to make an analogy to where I think this is all going, but actually first I want to address, because I see numerous people in chat rooms saying, well, that's it.
971328	973089	PS4 is for me this generation.
973609	973949	But...
974770	975610	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
997138	1018633	and I mean look at all the stuff that's happened you know before all this this this whole three-page thing came out there was reports going Microsoft canceled their after you know conference Q&A session they canceled their one-on-one interviews they just don't want to talk to people then they put this stuff out and that's it they're just leaving it at that but on top of all this
1019854	1032579	So, first off, the whole game sharing thing with your family and stuff, don't assume for one second that they're not going to expect each one of those people to have live, you know, a paid subscription to live in order for that to happen.
1033859	1037581	So why am I having to pay money for this console, pay money for live?
1038581	1055070	and like it's like I have to pay for the privilege to be like fucked over because you want to start you're feeling greedy or something that you feel like we're just not giving you enough money I also just don't like the fact that the Xbox has to talk to the servers once every 24 hours because you know
1055470	1058332	It's not that I have a problem with it in theory or on paper.
1058492	1060573	Like, you know, I play a lot of MMOs.
1060693	1062214	Of course those talk to the servers.
1063114	1069898	I'm not so much caring about it in principle, but the reality is what's going to happen when those servers go down?
1070038	1071199	Because they will go down.
1071499	1073420	And history has shown that this is what happens.
1073720	1077142	PlayStation Network down for months due to a hack attack.
1077502	1082665	You don't think there's kiddies out there that want to hack this new network the minute it goes up because they're angry too?
1083545	1084506	What happens then?
1107048	1109029	You're not going to be able to convince me otherwise.
1109870	1113092	Because history has shown it will go down and what is going to happen.
1113713	1114814	Wank.
1114934	1122919	There is no server on the face of the earth that has not gone down for any period of time.
1122979	1130945	I mean, I know they're saying that it's going to have a ton of servers or virtual servers or whatever, but they're going to have to perform maintenance on these things.
1131065	1134327	It's got to go down for maintenance for a certain amount of time.
1134848	1134928	Um...
1136440	1138763	I mean, it's just... It's gonna lock people out at some point.
1138823	1140525	Can we go back to PlayStation 4, though?
1140565	1146632	Because I do think there's a distinct possibility at least some of this is gonna be true about Sony's system as well.
1146932	1147132	Yeah.
1147713	1149655	And to which parts, not sure.
1149715	1153400	But it seems like maybe the game registration, especially... And you told me before the show...
1153800	1154120	and DarkSakura.
1171659	1179422	I think they wouldn't have gone all in if they didn't know that it was a guarantee from both console manufacturers.
1180162	1186344	And honestly, we have to see how similar it is.
1186404	1193466	If it's very similar, there's some serious antitrust concerns there because these guys just sit down and make...
1193986	1195610	Decide, hey, we're going to do this.
1195670	1198155	This is how we're going to do this system.
1198195	1199537	We're going to both be on board.
1199557	1202563	We're going to both benefit from it because they're going to have no choice.
1203044	1205168	We're going to get rid of options for them.
1207310	1222446	I... Like, you know, even though there's all this negative information, I have to wait until when the consoles come out before I can make my decision, because they could very well, hopefully, you know, say, fuck you guys, you know... Seriously, to EA, okay, what are they gonna do?
1222867	1224949	They gotta kind of get some balls here, because...
1226351	1227112	What's Microsoft gonna do?
1227432	1228914	They can say, fuck you, EA.
1229716	1230196	What are you gonna do?
1230277	1231699	Not publish games on our console?
1231959	1234222	And if Microsoft and Sony does that, what are they gonna do?
1234323	1235384	Publish PC only?
1235564	1237047	I mean, they're not.
1237087	1240071	They have to kind of agree on some sort of partnership here.
1240592	1240973	It's just...
1242914	1249155	I mean, if Sony, let's just say in a perfect world, Sony would say, okay, listen, we're not going to put up with this bullshit.
1249175	1252076	We're just going to keep things kind of the way they are right now.
1252676	1254996	And they could totally have this in the bag easy.
1255677	1261058	Easy this generation could come out on top and just totally rule everything.
1261118	1263198	But I have a feeling that's not the case.
1263238	1268879	I don't think Microsoft would take a risk like that without knowing that both parties are going to do that.
1269079	1283860	but yet you know there's going to be some little differences in policy because for instance we heard last week about how Sony is mandating that there be off screen play or whatever for PlayStation Vita so there are going to be little twists in the rules so maybe
1285322	1290043	Maybe Microsoft implemented, just theorizing, tinfoil hat here.
1290423	1299725	Maybe Microsoft invented the whole game sharing, Amazon Kindle thing to try and put a little positive in a negative that they agreed to with Sony.
1299825	1301166	And maybe Sony's not going to have that.
1301206	1303166	Maybe Sony's only got the negative.
1303466	1305627	And their positive is the PlayStation Vita Play.
1305647	1306767	Do you think there might be some of that?
1307267	1308088	Thanks for watching!
1326080	1349487	but so what you can do that anyways just you know you loan your games to your friends if you really want to I just don't I don't want to like just say well at least they have this okay well that's good but no they're taking away all this stuff from us I'm sorry I'll just stick with what I've got right now and if I have to I'll just go PC because at least there there's flexibility with I know I know there's DRM with Steam but
1350047	1351767	There's also mods with Steam.
1352008	1353768	There's also all sorts of customization.
1353808	1354668	There's indie games.
1355168	1358029	There's just insane sales on stuff.
1358269	1364810	I can honestly say, yes, I use Steam, but I really think I maybe ever bought one game.
1365330	1371232	One game in the years I've owned Steam, I've bought one game full retail price, and that would have been Civ V. You know what?
1371432	1372252	A PC-only game.
1372614	1373134	I never have.
1374395	1378959	And even when I could have gotten... Yeah, the stupid Origin bullshit.
1379339	1381801	But when I bought Mass Effect 3, for example.
1381981	1387845	Yeah, I bought it new, but I went and price matched somewhere so I didn't pay full price for it and didn't go through Origin.
1388286	1388686	Oh, yeah.
1388846	1394230	If Microsoft were to announce at the end of their press conference, by the way, we're going to be lowering the price of games from $60 to $30.
1394270	1394290	I...
1396872	1397212	I'm in.
1397352	1397933	I'm back in.
1398133	1403495	Because if that's the plus, that the games are now going to cost half as much, you know, so okay.
1403515	1405356	They have to have an incentive to make people win.
1405416	1406656	I'll be back in in a heartbeat.
1406917	1407597	It's not going to happen.
1407777	1408617	It's not going to happen.
1408637	1410618	Because here's what it is.
1410978	1416261	You think that you're going to get better prices because now they're getting rid of the used market, so to speak.
1417021	1421343	It's not going to happen because on PC you have multiple storefronts that are competing with each other.
1421403	1425685	And yeah, it may be all Steam DRM and stuff, but they're having sales all across the board.
1426045	1438270	With Microsoft going this route, not only are you going to be limited where you can trade your game in, so right there you're not going to get a really good deal as far as trading value goes because hey, where else are you going to go?
1438690	1439810	We're your only option.
1439890	1442551	So your trading value is going to fucking suck to begin with.
1443072	1445813	And on top of that, you think they're really going to mark down prices of games?
1446093	1446253	Hell,
1446553	1453377	There's games on their Xbox games on demand service right now that are still way above what you can actually get them in a disk space format.
1453417	1456159	So, no, you're kidding yourself.
1456279	1458301	A couple great comments in our chat room I want to get to.
1458761	1466586	Ahamkara in our chat says, I noticed Japan is not porting some of their best games out of the country, offer good games to themselves for cheap or free, and don't seem to care.
1466986	1472670	Funny how Microsoft is giving them the finger now by focusing on TV for Xbox One and not caring about Japan as well.
1473070	1476614	Well, I mean, we've all kind of sat here going, well, clearly Microsoft's written off Japan.
1477095	1482962	But if Sony were to adopt these similar measures, how would that impact Japanese gaming culture?
1483122	1485585	Are Japanese gamers... I mean, I honestly don't know.
1486746	1489469	Are Japanese gamers as willing to buy into all this?
1489589	1491552	I think... Go ahead.
1492176	1511667	I think that it's not necessarily going to work because from what I've seen, and of course we need somebody who lives there to confirm this, there's a big culture around having collectibles being one of the campers to get the game the first day, like the big lines around the Capcom store for whenever a Monster Hunter game comes out.
1512367	1513968	It's a different type of culture.
1514349	1529862	We may have a few people standing in line for a new system release or for having maybe one super special game, like the Madden ones, but it's nowhere near the crazy levels that it happens in Japan.
1530042	1530222	Right.
1530622	1536345	You know, and then, like, for example, I mean, I keep bringing up my stupid Cardcaptor Sakura Dreamcast game.
1536885	1540487	It had a pillow, pillowcase, and a clock, and a fork, and a spoon.
1540507	1540867	And a dish.
1541147	1542167	And a dish, yes.
1542868	1547650	But, I mean, and there was a Sakura Taisen game that came out in the same type of bundle.
1548370	1552752	But, I mean, there's lots of crazy-ass special editions that come out, and people like their packaging.
1552992	1558634	Akuma JP like clockwork shows up in chat when you said we need somebody from Japan to be listening, but he just turned the station on.
1559134	1563515	We're talking about the Microsoft Xbox One DRM restrictions.
1564095	1567076	And I was just kind of wondering if Sony's going down that same route.
1567756	1570037	How does that impact Japanese gaming culture?
1570057	1572738	Are the Japanese going to be as willing to buy into some of these restrictions?
1572898	1574821	I still think there's going to be physical packaging.
1575041	1579006	There's still going to be copies you can buy and sell.
1579647	1585675	Because there's a big part of the economy around that and there's a big part of the culture around that.
1586076	1590662	You even see a few people over here who like to get their import special editions and everything.
1591107	1599491	Alright, one more comment I want to get here from chat, and then I do kind of want to move on with the show, because we have a lot of news to cover in this pre-E3 week, and I know we're going to get back to this topic during phone calls tonight.
1600311	1609855	But I want to get this comment here from Koopa Kid Jeremy says, Thankfully, Nintendo isn't smart enough with online to even be able to implement these types of features.
1610236	1617339	You know, this is something I've kind of referenced in past episodes on the show when we were all worried about this, is that could Nintendo end up as the...
1618399	1646224	right now they're the dog in the corner chasing its tail looking a little silly and everybody's like what a weird dog but now all of a sudden it's like it's the most attractive puppy in the room and everybody might want to adopt it has Nintendo's failure to embrace online which granted probably is what drove EA does that suddenly make them the most attractive option to Japanese gamers to people like me that feel like I'm out I don't want all these
1646724	1647704	and Draconia Measures.
1648004	1659648	Honestly, I would... If they put an Xbox... Actually, as I've been calling it, the Xbox in front of me versus a Wii U, giving me money and said, pick one to buy.
1660208	1661108	You can buy one.
1661808	1662649	I would go for the Wii U.
1663849	1664931	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1680074	1680795	Loki, do you have a thought?
1680815	1682697	Because then I'm going to ask Jamie a very tough question.
1682937	1683998	No, Lord.
1684558	1691285	No, I still don't want a Wii U. And the reason it goes back to the original reason why I don't want a Wii U is because there's nothing I want to play on it.
1691405	1693867	And I don't really consider it a next-gen console.
1694247	1701775	I mean, honestly, the stuff you're going to see on the Wii U, especially coming out of new games, is stuff that's going to be ported to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 already.
1702455	1706257	I don't need to buy another console for games that I can play on my console that I already have.
1706658	1728711	Now, the only advantage I see, and it's been kind of, I've been thinking about it more because my wife has been really hogging the TV, is that off-screen, or the, you know, second screenplay stuff is kind of cool, because I do want to play console games a lot of times, and my wife wants to watch TV, so, you know, that is the only positive, but once again, it's, I don't want to buy a new console just for that, because I have my laptop, I can play on my laptop if I'm really willing to, so...
1731753	1734635	No one's holding a gun to my head to force me to buy a new console.
1734695	1735435	I don't have to.
1736236	1747203	If that's the thought process that they're going in with it, saying, well, that's why EA can get rid of their online passes because, hey, they've got to buy another console at some point.
1747924	1748404	No, I don't.
1748584	1749805	I don't have to do anything.
1750405	1750866	That's the thing.
1750926	1752608	I don't have to follow what you want me to do.
1753049	1763122	And don't think for one second that no one's going to figure out a way to put some sort of device in between your console and the internet to fucking spoof that authentication server.
1763142	1764764	I kind of think that's what's going to happen too.
1764804	1765745	Hackers going to hack, right?
1766118	1787781	it's gonna happen they will and this will be a focus uh YYR in chat says all these draconian restrictions aren't going to send most gamers to aren't going to send most gamers to Wii U the Nintendo fans will already buy one and everyone else will just not buy a console I think if anything I think people will still buy a next gen console even though they hate everything because they're like well I gotta play Killer Instinct or I gotta play whatever
1788382	1790524	I always try to gauge this.
1790664	1797992	In the years I've been doing this show and the commentary and everything, I find that the best insight comes from non-gamers, truly.
1798512	1805139	If I want to really get a feel for where America's head is really at, I'm not going to look for it on Twitter.
1805499	1810645	Sorry, guys, I'm not going to look for it with you because we're a very unique, smaller sort of subset fan base.
1811065	1814826	and I look to general people, people that don't consider themselves gamers.
1815246	1821348	And you know, this week I was on a work trip in Phoenix and I was with a couple co-workers and the subject of video games came up just randomly.
1821388	1830150	I think somebody had asked about my podcast and I was talking about it kind of casually and he mentioned, yeah, oh yeah, I really like Assassin's Creed and yeah, I heard about that Xbox One but...
1831805	1833547	I heard it's not going to play any of the used stuff.
1833587	1834507	I don't think I want to get one.
1834547	1835708	It sounds like it's too restrictive.
1836349	1846616	And I'm kind of just thinking in the back of my head, I'm like, I wonder if there's a lot of people that when they just kind of hear what a friend of a friend says to them, they're going to run with that.
1846736	1847237	You know what I mean?
1848017	1849478	Gamers will buy the console.
1849759	1852200	There'll be something on it.
1852221	1854802	There will be PlayStation 4s that sell.
1854822	1856123	There will be Xbox Ones that sell.
1856424	1858045	Will they sell more than Wii U?
1858065	1858105	No.
1860363	1860904	I don't know.
1861224	1875213	You know the best time to buy an Xbox One is going to be the end of the generation when they do eventually shut down those authentication servers and let's assume that they go the Steam route and they unlock it so that you don't have to call in every 24 hours.
1875593	1876153	It just works.
1876473	1879255	Or they can be fucking dicks and say, well, fuck, none of your shit is going to work now.
1880956	1883920	Let me ask Jamie the difficult question, then we'll move into our gaming week.
1884120	1884381	Okay.
1884661	1884941	All right.
1885082	1886884	And I open this up to the chatters as well.
1887645	1893973	For the 11 years this month that we've been doing Orange Lounge Radio, we've always had a mantra on this show.
1894053	1894374	11 years.
1894514	1896937	And we're actually having a show on June 23rd this year, which is the birthday.
1896977	1897257	Oh, wow.
1897958	1899139	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1912975	1918756	but Microsoft's about to unveil 15 exclusives which might include some of the things we've been clamoring for for a long time.
1918816	1922297	Killer Instinct, perhaps that Banjo-Kazooie thing.
1922337	1922637	I don't know.
1922917	1924697	I'm going to fanboy wank here.
1925397	1933019	But now because of all these things that the system is doing, I'm coming back to question, is that mantra still true?
1936679	1939980	I think we may have to evolve it.
1942791	1947194	because we've got a system now that's doing things that systems didn't do in the past.
1947854	1953918	We have a new restriction being placed on how they're trying to change how the system works.
1955499	1963584	And so with that, I believe, I'm trying to think of how to phrase this.
1963764	1970288	I think that the games themselves should speak for themselves, but they have to be made accessible.
1971198	1974121	If you don't have access to the game, it does you no good.
1976062	1983829	If it's not going to give you a way to play the game that's... I hope I'm making sense of this.
1984169	1985691	It's a tough question I just unloaded on you.
1985731	1986631	It's tough to phrase.
1987072	1991896	But I just kind of feel like the golden rule of gaming may finally have shown a blemish this week.
1994486	2001095	I think that to be able to appreciate the game being on the system, you have to have a system that's going to allow you to enjoy it.
2001695	2002416	Does that make sense?
2002577	2002777	Sure.
2002797	2004779	It has to work.
2006894	2011135	It has to, like, for the Nintendo, you put the cartridge in the system and you know it's gonna work.
2011195	2014196	Even if you blow on the cartridge a hundred times, you know, it has to just work, right?
2014236	2016737	But now we're calling into question, is this really gonna work?
2017037	2020158	I have to quote Queen Semia, sprinkles on a turd don't make it any more tasty.
2020178	2024559	Because actually, that's pretty much how it is.
2025380	2026260	I think that...
2028782	2029683	Ugh, God, it's hard for me to say.
2029703	2029903	Okay.
2030243	2032546	Let me try this from ClericalEra404 in chat.
2033727	2044858	At live.vognetwork.com, ClericalEra404 says, I think the mantra needs to evolve in that it needs to have the games, but also the versatility, the more games that are accessible by more people and potential players.
2045538	2046860	Power to the players, right?
2047220	2047520	Agreed.
2049022	2049803	The evil G there.
2050664	2050784	But...
2051744	2065332	here's really where my thought is on this one and I hope this makes sense because I've been trying to the thoughts clear in my head but it's kind of hard to bring into words a system is only as good as the games that are accessible on it
2066417	2066697	Preach.
2067278	2067518	Okay.
2068098	2069719	But I'm using an example here.
2069799	2073902	Back in the day, I'm going to use Symphony of the Night for Saturn and for PlayStation.
2074443	2075143	Because I've got them both.
2075924	2077145	I like the Saturn version better.
2078225	2081067	It was accessible to me at the time because I could import it.
2082508	2091918	Other people, but say that I had no means of importing the game and all I had was a $20 copy that I bought used at GameStop because you could buy them used at GameStop.
2092699	2097704	Well then I would say, well of course I like the PlayStation version because I haven't been able to play it on the Saturn.
2097804	2099245	I have no basis of comparison.
2099886	2104390	So say that you've got this system here that you don't want to...
2105912	2109175	Invest in because of its practices around the game.
2109435	2118103	Say the PS4 comes out and it's fully open and everything's nice and lovely and the same games come out for it, you're still going to go with the one that's more accessible to you because that's what you have.
2118143	2119564	You have no basis of comparison.
2119944	2123748	Saying X version is better isn't necessarily fair because you can't compare it.
2123848	2130654	Is that the reason why I tend to buy games on the PlayStation 3 over the Xbox 360 for the mere simple fact that I like the controller better?
2134366	2135748	I mean, that's really the same thing.
2135889	2136810	Not always.
2137591	2142920	But then I go, if I want to play the game online with friends, I go to the 360 because it's got the better network.
2143280	2144743	Thank you, ClericalEra404.
2144763	2148429	As said, I loves you for preferring the Saturn version.
2148857	2151378	Just because I really like playing as Maria, okay?
2151638	2152179	All right, all right.
2152239	2164045	But anyway, the whole point is that the games being good to play is also determined by the other factors that go into actually playing the game itself, like for you, the controller.
2164545	2170070	Like, for me, I love playing Saturn games because the dual analog controller does not hurt my hand, even to this day.
2170810	2178476	But playing, like, I'm better with RPG, like, I like playing RPGs better now because I get to move my hand.
2178516	2183581	I don't have to keep moving my thumb around and, you know, pulling at my scar on my hand.
2184461	2185461	All the scar tissue I've got.
2185561	2191183	So it's really going to be a matter of how you play it as well as the content itself.
2191663	2195884	And if it's not allowing you to access that content, then why bother?
2196765	2197065	All right.
2197365	2198365	Well, it's a complex issue.
2198665	2201086	Any quick last words, Loki, you want to get in before we move on here?
2202984	2217895	No, it's just, I'm just disappointed that this news came out now and not after, because I wish I could be a little bit excited about what Microsoft's showing, but once again... You sound like a tweet I made earlier this week that every year I'm so excited about E3 and like, yay, new games, yay.
2218335	2221277	This year, I really have a sense of dread about E3.
2221437	2224239	This year, it's about, how am I getting fucked over this year?
2224619	2229242	Like, and I'm sorry to sound like that jaded gamershateeverything.com guy, but...
2230143	2232687	I'm not gonna lie to you, that's where I'm at right now.
2233308	2238195	Whether I'm overreacting or not, it's a lot of money.
2238355	2243223	You're asking me to drop on a console where it's not even really my console.
2246747	2250729	At some point, I've got to put my foot down and say, I love video games, but no, I'm done.
2250809	2251890	Here's another question, too.
2251950	2256613	How are they even going to enable this with the first sale doctrine and stuff?
2258374	2261976	I just don't know if they're going to say, well, you're licensing stuff from us now.
2263076	2266558	I don't know if they're going to be able to.
2266919	2272502	Considering how sue-happy everything is, I think we could very well see that this is going to be a lawsuit within a year or so.
2272822	2275024	I forgot to make my analogy, so I'll make it quick.
2275184	2275804	Oh, I thought you did.
2276105	2276705	No, I didn't.
2277105	2278346	I make a lot of crazy analogies.
2278386	2279868	There was one I was sitting on all week.
2280348	2281569	Who remembers DivX?
2282710	2283310	Oh my God.
2283330	2285032	When they had the DivX players?
2285052	2288614	I'm not talking about the codec on your computer that lets you watch movies and things like that.
2288654	2291357	I'm talking about when there was actually a DivX player at Circuit City.
2291917	2299483	But it always had to be connected online because you could rent the movies at the store and the thing ended up flopping.
2299723	2300844	Why did the DivX flop?
2301906	2303167	because of all the restrictions on it.
2303367	2304708	There weren't any games on it.
2306090	2308031	No, there weren't any movies for it.
2308071	2310913	Well, there was the same movies that were on DVD and Laserdisc.
2311294	2315317	And for the people who don't know what DivX is, just think of the little mascot from Penny Arcade.
2315737	2317519	They have that little DivX player character.
2318500	2319340	That's a DivX machine.
2319540	2324124	And I'm sorry, but right now what I'm hearing out of Xbox One sounds very DivX to me.
2325225	2328748	People rejected DivX because they wanted to own their shit.
2331590	2336292	And they didn't want to have to keep dialing this server that was Daddy Steven Spielberg, who was a co-owner in this.
2336532	2338553	Daddy Steven Spielberg, may I watch this movie?
2339193	2339413	Mm-hmm.
2342154	2345015	People want to have control in the end.
2345295	2345435	Yeah.
2345695	2346535	GameGuru in chat.
2346575	2348636	DivX, the disc player that killed Circuit City.
2348796	2349396	Absolutely.
2349697	2351777	It brought down an entire chain with it.
2351837	2355699	Don't think that the DivX didn't have a lasting negative impact on Circuit City.
2356019	2358860	Well, and also keep in mind, there...
2360956	2362257	I just completely lost my train of thought.
2362457	2376786	No, it was the fact that you still have people today that even though we've got iTunes and we have all this digital distribution, there's still people who like to physically go out and buy a disc, who will prefer to buy their music on CD.
2376866	2378927	There's quite a few people in chat agreeing with you, yes.
2379087	2379287	Yeah.
2379708	2381749	I mean, I'm not necessarily one of them, but...
2382233	2382473	Anyway.
2383153	2383373	All right.
2383634	2385114	Lots of passion behind this topic.
2385194	2388395	I'm sure we'll hear more about it during our phone call segment later, as well as the mailbag.
2388735	2390856	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
2391156	2392457	It's going to be a very interesting E3 week.
2392477	2393077	Rob will answer it.
2393237	2393597	I'm kidding.
2394277	2395938	It's going to be a very interesting E3 week.
2395958	2396598	That's all I have to say.
2397438	2403521	I'm really looking forward to next week's show when Sony will have to put it out on the table because they didn't cancel their media stuff, right?
2403981	2405781	So they're going to have to answer this question.
2406081	2409963	And finally, we'll have a clearer picture to what things are going to look like come this fall.
2410563	2411144	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2435203	2437244	But I had a really good time doing it.
2437264	2442086	And I really liked what it added to the, as I'm calling it, the main timeline lore.
2442646	2443507	It was really good.
2443787	2445388	So I've actually been enjoying that.
2445448	2449850	And they kind of set the skill trees back to how they used to be.
2450550	2460538	Not necessarily exactly the same, and I kind of respect my Vice Admiral incorrectly, but still, they did a lot of really cool stuff.
2460978	2468744	And actually, I'll tell you what was funny, because I was just running around on my Vice Admiral, because I have her pretty much permanently parked at Deep Space Nine.
2469184	2474368	They put Morn in Quark's bar, and like, as a big DS9 fan, that made me stupendously happy.
2475728	2479709	It even had him quote telling a story even though he never talks.
2479749	2483410	It just sort of did a fade out and him shaking his head forlornly and everything.
2483450	2484070	It was pretty funny.
2484970	2486250	I did start Marvel Heroes.
2486370	2487370	I do not care for it.
2487631	2495232	It reminded me a bit of playing Marvel Ultimate Alliance without the fun part of having other people to play with.
2496092	2499813	Interesting because you're the first one I've heard say something negative about it.
2500473	2502815	I mean, everybody has their opinion, it's just interesting.
2502935	2524969	I'm not saying it wasn't fun, and yeah, it's free to play, but if I wanted another character, I pretty much have to buy 20 bucks worth of points for one character, or if I bought $40 worth of points, that would get me, you know, maybe three characters, and the one that I really wanted to play, she had a sprite for it, but she wasn't accessible to buy, because as I've made no...
2526838	2530501	No secret of this, my favorite Marvel character is Jessica Jones because she's badass.
2531501	2542829	So anyway, I played through the whole first mission as Scarlet Witch and it was just like a not quite as fun version of Marvel Ultimate Alliance and I would rather play Marvel Ultimate Alliance.
2543271	2570822	I'm gonna check I want to check out this Marvel Heroes game I just I was busy this past week so I didn't get a chance to check it out but it wasn't bad I'm gonna say it wasn't bad but it wasn't enough to make me want to spend any amount of money on it I mean I might play it a little bit more I've got Scarlet Witch she's pretty cool I almost picked Hawkeye because you know Hawkeye but I went for her you just wanted to stare at his booty no I'm you know what that's objectification Robin I take exception to that
2571763	2579598	um but uh it was all right it was all right and as a male I am totally okay with the objectification of Hawkeye just saying
2580486	2581347	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
2605306	2616017	and then um yes Claire Claire it's because it's Jeremy Renner and I think he's pretty um and intelligent and intelligent um but uh
2618637	2619158	What was I saying?
2619218	2619838	Oh, yeah.
2620239	2623081	So I actually, I have a high-res mod.
2623701	2630966	Well, it's really, you have to sort of manually mod your INI files yourself and then use text mod for the high-resolution textures.
2631807	2643155	And I figured out that why my game kept shutting down is because I didn't have this, there's like a little program you can run to make it accept higher memory usage.
2643175	2643515	Yeah.
2643715	2648666	Which, I mean, I've got a card that, you know, gives me two extra gig of VRAM, so I don't know what's going on.
2649247	2652835	But I ended up getting that working, and...
2654648	2656749	It was pretty good.
2657209	2663131	And I actually, I can tell you this, that I don't get as sick as I did with some of the higher res textures.
2664012	2668994	So I'm pretty much just running through the game and trying to get all the stuff I missed.
2669334	2680238	I'm actually also doing a different background than what I used to do, because I always used to do either a colonist or a spacer, but I would always do Soul Survivor, and now I'm doing a war hero, which is...
2680678	2681398	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2708771	2712643	and um god I was playing something else too and I don't remember what it was
2714710	2715750	I don't remember what it was.
2715990	2717071	We'll come back to you if you think of it.
2717251	2719191	Oh, Dan is really irritated with Grid 2.
2720031	2720191	Why?
2720791	2724492	Because he says that the collision detection in that game is just really shit.
2724792	2725393	I haven't played it.
2725693	2727213	Well, you know, he has that driving rig.
2727233	2727833	Oh, no, I know.
2727913	2729473	He loves his driving rig.
2729754	2730414	He's a manly man.
2730894	2731134	Yeah.
2731294	2732714	All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?
2733534	2737555	Unfortunately, I did not play, I don't think, anything, actually.
2737895	2738256	Wow.
2738816	2740116	Yeah, it's just...
2741983	2766488	Boss has been out all week, so they haven't played any Call of Duty, and I didn't really play anything in the week, I was working on my laptop for most of the week, and then my laptop broke, so then I had to fix my laptop, so I've been busy with that, so yeah, I did buy the Serious Sam bundle thing that they have on the Humble Bundle Weekly thing, so that's kind of cool, so hopefully I'll play some of that soon, and just watch the Watch Dogs trailer for E3, the E3 trailer in
2767728	2768609	Looks fantastic.
2768669	2769450	I can't wait for that game.
2770431	2771632	Did that just release tonight?
2772313	2772933	It leaked out, yeah.
2774763	2775163	Anything else?
2776684	2777664	That is it.
2778404	2780024	I'm only really going to talk about one new game.
2780765	2788347	I was in Phoenix for a lot of the week for the day job, so that kind of kept me away from most of my games besides iPad and portable games.
2788707	2789927	I've talked a lot about on the show.
2790287	2792448	My random game to play on the airplane.
2792628	2798109	Thank heavens for the Game Boy Advance games and the NES games and all that on the 3DS for the early adopters.
2798689	2800390	Mario Kart Game Boy Advance.
2800990	2809333	I don't know why, it actually is one of the weaker Mario Kart games, just control wise and everything, but I was like, I want to unlock the special cup, so I did it.
2809774	2815756	Anyway, the real game I've been playing a bit of at least the past couple days is Animal Crossing New Leaf.
2815956	2819718	It's the 3D version of Animal Crossing that just came out.
2820758	2821358	What can I say?
2821518	2822519	It's Animal Crossing.
2822939	2827882	Some of the differences, though, I noticed that they put a lot of the stores that used to be sprinkled throughout your town.
2828322	2842510	Not really the mall thing like the Wii did, but there's other side of the tracks now, like a Main Street, where all the Nooks, the Able Sisters, Tom Nook, who's now the realtor because he gave the convenience store to his kids.
2843150	2865764	and some other stuff is all that stuff's on the other side of the tracks the museum's there too so it's kind of neat to have kind of everything in that one place that really opens up your town to have a little bit more of your design when it comes to the trees and the flowers and all that all the online experience is pretty much similar to what I noticed in the previous games you open up your train gates and people can come visit in fact I should open mine up and see if anyone comes to visit
2866484	2890133	and then you can close them when you're ready for people to get out so a lot of that hasn't changed but I know they brought the island back and there's a lot more fruits available thanks to the island some of the other things I noticed is that the story is a lot different because now you're the mayor so you have an assistant Isabella who kind of helps you or I'm assuming everybody has the same one I don't even know
2890513	2891354	Thank you for watching!
2907416	2912179	But it's just kind of fun to grow your little neighborhood and interact with the people.
2912559	2915581	And then the online element provides a lot of fun with that.
2916021	2920964	And it's $35 since it's a handheld game, not $60 like a lot of console games cost.
2921284	2922785	So I think that's priced pretty good.
2922925	2927748	Sometimes you just want to do a little bit of fishing, donate it to the museum, make some bells.
2928188	2928788	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2957563	2957844	DarkSakura
2969773	2972016	Let's get into quick housekeeping.
2972997	2978503	I mentioned this earlier in the show, but do keep an eye on this week, e3.vognetwork.com.
2979003	2987132	It is our interactive E3 experience at the Voice of Geeks Network that's going to be led by VOG Network's Bobby Blackwolf, who will be on the show.
2988193	2992876	Show Floor at E3 and he will be getting answers to your questions.
2993456	3000100	Because once Bobby's done these appointments and played some of the games, he wants to see what you guys want to hear about.
3000440	3012766	But all we ask, don't ask the obvious things that are already in the press releases and don't ask about this stinking Xbox used game thing because we all know they're not going to comment further on it.
3013126	3013327	But
3014187	3014888	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3032328	3061691	but you know whatever it is you want to hear more about it uh go take a look at e3.vognetwork.com it has all the information you need question submissions open up after the Sony press conference tomorrow when we're really going to know where things stand okay um we'll hear from Bobby Blackwolf on that a little more later because we are going to have a list list later tonight uh the thing we most want to see happen at E3 2013 that'll be in part b later in the show but first let's run through some gaming news and Loki start us off
3062131	3069099	Alright, so there's a rumor going around that GameStop is discontinuing the Wii U Basic after June 18th.
3070040	3082755	And basically, the rumor comes from that they've been getting, like there's an internal email saying that they're going to be sending back all the basic units and that kind of stuff.
3083335	3090338	Also, Nintendo has followed up with this, saying that there's a current misperception about the Wii U hardware.
3090378	3100302	To clarify, Nintendo is working with its retail partners to simply rebalance the stock of white 8GB systems and black 32GB Wii U models in the market.
3100342	3103643	Consumers looking for either model will continue to find them available.
3104183	3105744	That doesn't make any sense to me, but okay.
3106644	3117892	Then, of course, there's a follow-up to that where another retailer was saying that they received an email that they're going to be recalling all the 8GB systems.
3118393	3128120	I think, if anything, this has to do with the fact that they're talking about putting out a white 3GB, 2GB system.
3128160	3131983	I'm wondering if they're just going to get rid of the 8GB system altogether because...
3132583	3133864	Maybe that's not as popular.
3134745	3139848	I know a lot of people that buy Wii U's, at least as far as my customers are concerned.
3140909	3141950	Who's buying the basics?
3142250	3142950	Not a lot of people.
3142970	3144171	They want the pack-in game.
3144552	3147113	They want the stuff that comes with the deluxe.
3147133	3149775	I wouldn't blame Nintendo at all if they're phasing the basics out of the market.
3149795	3157741	I think the 18th coincides well with being after E3, so maybe an announcement in the new
3157921	3158622	That's my fingers.
3158922	3165547	My real hope is that they're getting rid of the basics because they're going to drop the price of the deluxes down to where the basics are.
3166127	3167709	That would be phenomenal news.
3168009	3177756	And what a great opportunity for Nintendo to kick their competition in the balls while all this other talk about the usage restrictions and all this is going on.
3178817	3201436	Nintendo could really strike them in the jugular and you might still hate everything that Nintendo has to offer but you gotta recognize that there's gonna be a lot of people that are here for Mario Kart and 3D Mario and all this stuff it wouldn't be that hard for them to refurbish all those old systems to pop that 8 gigabyte storage chip off there and put a 3 gigabyte chip there in place so it wouldn't be that hard very well could happen
3203414	3211216	Alan Alchemy in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, 8 gigabytes is just an embarrassingly insufficient amount of memory by today's standards, period.
3211576	3212797	Budget console or no?
3213957	3214657	That's very true.
3214697	3215278	It's not a lot.
3216178	3218518	So Nintendo's got to catch up.
3218538	3222179	But don't catch up too much to what else is going on in the world.
3223160	3229902	Moving on to other news out of E3, Square Enix mentioning what they're going to be showing at their E3 booth.
3231062	3236043	Sometimes things get left off of this, but I'll say what there is so far.
3236423	3245605	Kingdom Hearts 1.5 Remix on PlayStation 3, Final Fantasy XIV A Realm Reborn, which makes sense because I believe Beta 3 starts next week.
3245625	3246725	Well, it comes out in August.
3246845	3248525	Yeah, so they're counting down there.
3248685	3250886	They've also changed restrictions on the beta stuff.
3251046	3252806	Yes, NDA is lifted.
3252926	3256547	But still, you're not allowed to say anything on the previous betas.
3257253	3263799	Final Fantasy X and X-2 HD Remaster for the Vita and PlayStation 3 Deus Ex Human Revolution Director's Cut for Wii U
3282076	3285077	and Thief, another big title on its way.
3285517	3289679	Now, there are rumors that there could be something additional there as well.
3290059	3296161	Apparently, the future of Final Fantasy being teased for Tuesday, June 11th, 9 a.m.
3297102	3299563	Rumors and rumblings suggesting it's Final Fantasy XV.
3300863	3327539	uh whether that is what 13 versus has been put through a remodel and that's now 15 or maybe this news is just 13 versus no it's gonna be something new for the playstation 4 and the probably the xbox one because remember the playstation 4 of it they showed the same fucking trailer that they had before and they're like and we'll have more to announce 33 you know so it's it's gonna be something new for next gen it's probably gonna be using their new engine that they have
3327739	3331924	It is sad to me though that Dragon Quest X just probably isn't going to happen over here, is it?
3332485	3342076	I was kind of hoping that maybe they would announce that at E3, that maybe they were just going to solely back Wii U. I really wish they would try with Dragon Quest X, but...
3343297	3344158	Dragon Quest 9 Dragon Quest 9
3364793	3365274	Alright, moving on.
3365334	3366394	Quest Swords, that's what it was.
3366595	3368856	Well, this is purely rumor, okay?
3368956	3370918	So I'm just going to go ahead and spit it out there.
3370998	3371899	Allegedly stuff.
3374141	3385029	There is a rumor going around that Microsoft has been paying off third-party developers not to show off anything for PlayStation 4 either on stage or at their booths.
3385710	3388392	That Microsoft has resorted to paying them off for this.
3389457	3398597	Now, I don't know if this is true or not, but the report came from a source on NeoGAF that's done a lot of true research.
3399707	3403871	Here is your nice big salt lick to go with this.
3404072	3404592	Exactly.
3405193	3409077	But it did come from someone who in the past has been reliable.
3410258	3421390	Well, now this would put weight in the column of maybe Sony isn't in the same camp as Microsoft because otherwise it's, what are you so afraid of, Microsoft?
3421792	3430696	Well, the whole point is that the theory is that if this is really what's going on, that Microsoft is trying to give the illusion that they're going to have more games available than the PS4 will.
3431597	3432837	Which would make them look more attractive.
3432877	3437840	And it's not that Microsoft and Sony haven't struck at each other financially before.
3437920	3438420	I mean, what?
3438720	3441782	Microsoft got a lot of DLC agreements.
3442462	3466480	Sony got the whole Valve tie-in portal like everybody bought Portal 2 on PlayStation 3 because everything well not everybody but a lot of people did because of you know their agreements with Valve and the Steam integration which was really good I got mine on Steam yeah well you got you bought it it was a gift but still well you bought it on PS3 and you got it on both no I didn't no no I you did but I mean I didn't care about it on PS3 at all I got it on on Windows yeah
3466980	3476262	So paying for exclusives and paying off for stuff like that, that's not really... But it's just in light of everything else going on in the gaming industry is what makes a lot of people kind of leech onto this news.
3476342	3478083	Yeah.
3479123	3487305	Well, and it could just be something that was thrown out there for the purpose of, you know, making Microsoft look bad too.
3488025	3493947	But at the same time... They don't need a NeoGAF thread to do that.
3494622	3512992	I don't know that at this point that I would put anything past past them right now especially since this type of shit goes on all the time in the corporate world so saying but isn't it weird how Microsoft and Sony would have had to agree to this thing and then now they strike at each other in corporate warfare in these other ways it's really it's kind of sick
3514233	3514874	in some ways.
3514894	3515975	Welcome to corporate America.
3517357	3518638	Welcome to the world corporation.
3518678	3519539	It's not just America, honey.
3519639	3520620	I know, I know, I know.
3521161	3523203	But I'm saying it's business.
3523904	3527307	And in the end, what companies most care about is their bottom line.
3528028	3529830	And they will do what they can to increase it.
3531271	3531672	End of story.
3532433	3532633	Loki.
3533783	3538247	Alright, so let's see, let's talk a little bit about Plants vs. Zombies.
3538487	3544011	And you may remember they had an announcement for Plants vs. Zombies 2, it's about time.
3544371	3551116	Well now there's some actual banners being spotted at E3 showing Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare.
3551877	3552457	I am excited.
3552898	3559423	Which is, rumors to be true, I think they were saying that it's a multiplayer first person shooter game.
3560423	3560744	So...
3563675	3564695	I am no longer excited.
3565435	3566936	Well, there's still the Plants vs. Zombies 2.
3568016	3570037	I'm excited about that, but first person shooter, no.
3570897	3578039	Yeah, so I remember actually hearing about that before, so it'll be interesting to see what that's like.
3578379	3582580	I'm thinking maybe a little bit like that Batman, what was it, the...
3585733	3590336	The Batman game that they had on Xbox Live Arcade.
3591517	3592457	Gotham Impostor.
3593418	3593578	Yeah.
3594839	3595179	That one.
3595640	3597321	Oh, the Gotham Kids or something like that.
3597341	3600943	Yeah, it's like... Somebody in chat will yell it out.
3601003	3603545	Yeah, I don't remember.
3604525	3605005	Oh, neat.
3605586	3611810	I guess we'll have to hear about it during EA's press conference.
3611870	3613491	I guess they're going to have that on Monday, so...
3615114	3616094	I'm watching all of those.
3616114	3617015	That would be fantastic.
3617035	3617775	Yeah, me too.
3618035	3620155	You want to hear something kind of funny off topic here a little bit?
3620555	3622436	I was looking on NeoGAF just a second here.
3623536	3627057	They put out a reminder that there was this thing that leaked last year.
3627077	3629018	Remember about their kind of game plan?
3629278	3629498	Yeah.
3630158	3637220	And the actual marketing position that they had for 2013 is this one box input one.
3637240	3637280	So...
3642601	3643522	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3665716	3682548	Akuma JP in our chat room with a very interesting comparison we were talking earlier the whole corporate warfare with Sony and Microsoft Akuma JP in our chat says look at Apple and Samsung that's another good comparison because those two they have to work together for some things but then they're at each other's throats
3683428	3685069	with courts and lawsuits and everything.
3685129	3687170	It's fascinating how that all works.
3687791	3693514	Okay, so here's, if you remember that whole thing, the PDF that came out last year.
3693554	3695695	So here's what the next game plan then would be.
3697336	3703199	Fortezella glasses, digital glasses that allow you to see 3D objects in your living room.
3703980	3705701	That's augmented reality stuff.
3705901	3709283	So that's going to be next year, apparently, according to their road map.
3710856	3711837	What about the Illumina Room?
3712137	3713219	When's that supposed to be a thing?
3713259	3714059	Next year too, I think.
3716242	3716562	Interesting.
3717904	3719445	Alright, moving on.
3719505	3730477	I talked earlier in the show about Animal Crossing and I know one reason everybody loved the GameCube version of Animal Crossing and some people arguably say it's their favorite is because it had all the classic NES games in it.
3730797	3736441	Remember how you could play Punch Out and Clue Clue Land and all these Nintendo games in Animal Crossing?
3736822	3751293	Well, this will probably be a bit of a duh, but in an interview with Katsuya Eguchi, he basically, and this is an interview that he had out there, he said that please consider it's not happening ever again in regards to Virtual Console.
3751793	3756358	At the time of Animal Crossing on the GameCube, we didn't have a virtual console system.
3756758	3760261	We thought that playing games inside of a game is kind of funny, and we wanted to do it.
3760622	3765887	But now there's a virtual console where you can play classic games, so we don't think we'll be doing that in future titles.
3766287	3775456	So, kind of confirmation that, yeah, they're not going to bring those NES games back in the other systems, and it's really virtual console's fault because they can make money selling those games separately.
3775896	3784938	However, part of the reason I wanted to bring this up is because when I was reading this article on Destructoid.com, who ran with this article, I really liked an idea that was proposed.
3784978	3793921	And I wanted to kind of put this out there by the author at Destructoid.com, who said, "...there's more that could be done to appease those looking for retro flavor in a new Animal Crossing adventure.
3794441	3799262	A nice compromise would be to include some special 8-bit Animal Crossing-themed games."
3799702	3801102	in the next entry of the series.
3801963	3807184	In the GameCube title, Tortimer might give you a fake NES game called Super Tortimer on April 1st.
3807584	3809265	What if Super Tortimer were playable?
3809645	3816587	A little 10 minute long platformer starring a turtle mare and maybe a few other fake but fun lo-fi NES on Animal Crossing minigames.
3816947	3818127	And I'm like, I love that idea.
3818327	3819088	That's a fantastic idea.
3819108	3820208	That's a fantastic idea.
3820888	3824309	Like, you know, just silly little flash games to be collectible.
3824689	3826110	I think that would be a great thing for the series.
3826390	3830352	Granted, you know, it's going to be a lot of development costs and somebody's got to design all that.
3830992	3831992	Design it as a contest.
3832032	3833333	You have a bunch of indie devs.
3833353	3835293	I was just going to say, crowdsource the fucker.
3835413	3842016	You just have a bunch of indie devs just creating 8-bit shit for it and you could even market that as a reason to buy the game.
3842196	3842616	But I don't know.
3842656	3845977	I just don't see Nintendo as somebody who would crowdsource like that.
3845997	3846638	You know what I mean?
3848058	3877271	but yeah that would be awesome it's too bad oh you know Nintendo if you're thinking about that Wii U version of Animal Crossing here's a oh oh this could this could really bring a lot of people back or just you know maybe just give us you know those NES games because come on you've already made your money back and then like who the fuck's gonna buy Clue Clue Land let's be real it wasn't that good or Donkey Kong Math or yeah who's gonna buy that shit come on um
3878703	3880927	I have memories of Clu Clu Land, don't judge me
3892183	3917483	YYR in chat says but I do have to buy a third party hack disc to unlock them all this time yeah because remember Super Mario Brothers and Zelda were in the original Animal Crossing but you couldn't get them without a code like they were never actually given out you had to code them to do it or use the link from Hyrule website that was big back in the day where everybody had the same character name so you could just gift yourself all this stuff pretty funny
3919684	3946014	what else do I want to say with that oh here's one other thing I would say is that if they do these whole like little flash games that they put inside Animal Crossing they could almost one up virtual console and like how about little achievements within Animal Crossing and leaderboards within Animal Crossing suddenly Animal Crossing is what we all thought PlayStation Home was going to be think about it womp womp
3947230	3948311	Alright, anyway.
3949813	3953757	Well, how about something that's a little bit happier, Rob?
3954017	3955398	Okay.
3955879	3957540	How about something that has nothing to do with Nintendo?
3958641	3960423	I don't know if that's going to be happier this week.
3961865	3964027	Nintendo's kind of my safe room.
3965088	3966489	Nintendo is my safe word this week.
3966509	3969552	Remember, if it gets a little bit too hard for you, just say...
3970638	3980767	I want my Wii U This actually has to do with an exclusive for PS3 that will be launching on Tuesday
3981400	3983722	Tekken Revolution is going to be on PS3.
3983782	3985264	It will be free to play.
3986045	3987286	And you know me and my Tekken.
3988047	3989028	I worked for Namco.
3989488	3993031	I remember Tekken 3 and trying to predict who the next character would be.
3993091	3996555	So I have special, special love of anything Tekken.
3997516	3999538	Especially anything that has Gene Kazama in it.
3999558	4001680	Yeah, but isn't this just going to be the dumb trading card game?
4002014	4002514	You know what?
4003595	4009439	It says that basically it's going to be... I'm trying to see what it says it's going to be.
4009459	4015443	Yeah, it's being referred to as a new version of Tekken card tournament.
4016644	4017624	Which, you know what's funny?
4017725	4020546	I even had the stupid Tekken card game on the Wonderswan.
4021387	4023588	So I will go to Lynx to play anything Tekken.
4023829	4024449	So I'm just saying.
4024929	4025370	Don't judge me.
4025390	4026230	At least this one's free.
4026470	4026711	Yeah.
4027171	4027871	I like free.
4029452	4029893	Who doesn't?
4030673	4031774	Especially because I'm broke.
4032114	4035736	Well, if you hate free and you want to buy something this week... Get the X-Bone!
4037377	4039419	If you hate freedom, buy an Xbox One.
4040259	4043261	No, seriously, what is coming out this week around the world?
4043421	4044522	US first, Loki.
4044802	4045742	Nothing, really.
4046203	4047183	Well, one game.
4047443	4048764	The Last of Us on Friday.
4049425	4050105	On Friday.
4050325	4052246	Arguably a big fucking game.
4052306	4054668	Yeah, great reviews, but Friday?
4055168	4055508	What?
4056709	4058250	Well, you know, gotta get down on Friday.
4059599	4062601	I guess, you know, they want to make sure... Gotta get down to Disneyland!
4062621	4067984	I want to make sure that it doesn't release on Tuesday with all that E3 news getting lost in the shuffle there.
4068104	4072306	Alright, well, traveling to Japan and seeing if there's anything additional this week.
4072747	4074047	Not so much on the PlayStation 3.
4074348	4076169	PlayStation 3 is looking pretty empty this week.
4076689	4078830	Xbox 360, you'd be surprised.
4078850	4080511	There is a game on Xbox 360 this week.
4080551	4082292	It's called Ginga Force and...
4082812	4084234	Eschatos Wonder Pack.
4084574	4087716	I don't know if that's just like a combination two-for-one thing.
4087877	4089378	Yeah, it is definitely a two-for-one pack.
4089398	4090299	I'm looking at the box art.
4090699	4096744	These look to be 3D spacey shooter games, like mechs.
4097765	4099626	Oh, it's got classic games in there, too.
4100007	4100327	I see.
4100667	4102489	Judgment, Silver Sword, Cardinal Sins.
4102789	4107173	If you're a shmup fan, this might be the compilation for you.
4107273	4108354	That is out on the Xbox 360 this week.
4109875	4113218	It's just me or does Xbox 360 get so many shmups over in Japan?
4113298	4115400	It's the shmup console.
4115460	4116080	Oh, that's good to know.
4116221	4120264	Yeah, but especially bullet hell games?
4120784	4121145	Please.
4123767	4127070	Looking at the other systems, sadly not a lot this week.
4127090	4129412	3DS is really the only other thing that's seeing some releases.
4129472	4136398	Donkey Kong Returns makes its way to Japan this week and there's a Nintendo Metallic Red 3DS to match.
4136918	4144821	Also, one other game from Square Enix this week, Chusoku Henkai Jairozetter, Albatross no Tsubasa, comes out this week.
4145401	4146801	Wings of the Albatross?
4147722	4152183	Yes, it looks like another mech fighting game slash role-playing game type thing.
4152802	4159005	Aren't albatrosses usually associated with bad nautical things?
4159145	4162046	Maybe they're mechs that swim, DarkSakura.
4162186	4162667	I don't know.
4162687	4164127	I don't think albatrosses can swim.
4165508	4167489	I think they just die and hang around your neck.
4169490	4174192	Speaking of dying and hanging around your neck, I'm done with Japanese game releases this week.
4174943	4176504	Well, we have a few things for the UK.
4176704	4180347	On the 11th, we have Tekken Revolution, as I brought up earlier.
4181068	4183650	On the 12th, we have Xenoclash on the Xbox 360.
4183770	4185731	And on the 14th, Animal Crossing 3DS.
4186492	4192196	Chemical spillage simulation for PC, which actually just sounds hilarious without knowing anything about it.
4192336	4193897	And then The Last of Us on PS3.
4195839	4196279	That's it.
4198301	4200002	Stick a fork in it, speaking of dead things.
4202080	4203662	Okay, let's see.
4205064	4217822	There is some interesting controversy with this game, Vampire Smile, which was one of those... It originally started off as the dishwasher, one of the first Xbox...
4218783	4220384	Indie games that they showed off.
4220444	4224867	Actually, I think while they were introducing indie games or what they used to be called?
4224927	4225527	Community games?
4226068	4226708	Way back in the day?
4227008	4231711	Anyway, so the sequel, The Dishwasher, The Vampire Smile, was coming to PC.
4233672	4241077	But originally, the first way it came to the PC was a hacker, I guess a developer, Barbarous,
4241717	4247982	He really wanted to see the game come to PC, so he cracked the version of it and uploaded it, I guess, to the internet.
4248622	4250824	And so he kind of ported it to PC.
4250924	4259690	Well now, it's actually coming officially to PC as well, because they weren't too happy with the fact that he cracked the game and stuff.
4262038	4264960	New Director's Cut is going to have some enhancements to the game.
4265620	4268382	That's not a good precedent to set, though.
4268562	4271004	Hack our game and we'll put it on the console you want.
4271384	4279689	I remember with Sonic Generations, they had the Sonic... What the hell was the crappy one with the werehog?
4281223	4283724	They had all the daylight missions from that game.
4283804	4284424	Ask this one.
4284464	4284824	I don't know.
4284844	4286604	I can't tell all those Sonic games apart.
4286644	4287024	She can.
4287044	4287604	Which Sonic game?
4287624	4288845	Sonic Unleashed, I think it was.
4289025	4289805	I didn't play that one.
4290625	4298226	Sonic Unleashed, they had the daytime levels from that ported over to Sonic Generations for the PC because it never came out on PC.
4299167	4301727	I do have Sonic Generations and I haven't even played it yet.
4304148	4310989	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com use the passphrase TICKET
4312082	4315044	To answer a code man, I don't acknowledge that in my universe.
4315885	4316105	What?
4316906	4317506	Acknowledge what?
4317546	4319168	Don't have a one-sided conversation here.
4319448	4320289	Kiefer Sutherland.
4320489	4321670	Hey, that's coming up later in the show.
4321690	4321850	I know.
4321870	4322611	Stop spoiling things.
4323211	4323912	Stop spoiling it.
4324192	4325153	I still don't like thinking about it.
4325173	4325613	Spoiler.
4326154	4326434	Alright.
4327174	4327795	You know what, Rob?
4328591	4329452	Spawning
4345829	4348670	and I thought that meant maybe like a new enemy unit.
4348930	4349810	Isn't that what Zergs do?
4349850	4350811	They spawn a lot of Zergs.
4351091	4359093	But anyway, what happens, you get free access to gameplay features when somebody who doesn't own a certain version of the game parties with someone who did.
4359493	4365015	So in other words, when you go into multiplayer, you play the most current version of the game owned by at least one person in the party.
4365055	4372397	So if you have the free starter edition, but you come play with me and I have StarCraft II Basic Edition, we're now both playing StarCraft II Basic Edition.
4372757	4373438	So that's kind of cool.
4373458	4373798	That's like...
4374918	4377120	DS One Cartridge Play or something like that.
4377540	4381344	If I party up with somebody playing Heart of the Swarm, we both get to play Heart of the Swarm.
4382465	4386909	It's been rolling out globally since June 4th when this was announced.
4387629	4392694	I don't know what regions do and don't have it at this time, but this is something that is planned for everybody.
4393054	4393594	So that's some...
4394375	4408788	that's kind of awesome actually because if you if you have like a core group of four friends that you just want to do nothing but play Starcraft with maybe one of you is a big Starcraft nerd but the others aren't so much one person buys the game everybody mooches off it and you just don't play otherwise
4410387	4411048	That's kind of cool.
4412129	4412349	Yes.
4412989	4419355	It's almost like if you had a game and then you load it to their friends and then they got really excited about the game and bought the sequel when it came out at launch.
4420456	4421217	Oh, we can't have that.
4421277	4422418	We can't do that.
4422478	4424039	It cuts into developer money.
4424240	4431526	To be fair, although I love your tongue-in-cheek point there, let's not forget StarCraft II does require an always online connection just because that's the nature of the game.
4431566	4435890	You're right, because the PC marketplace is completely different than the console marketplace.
4437131	4437411	DarkSakura.com
4461536	4464998	I cut you all with my razor sharp wit.
4465358	4468160	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week this week?
4468400	4469620	Star Gladiator.
4471201	4475504	Or as it was called over here, Star Gladiator Episode 1, Final Crusade.
4475924	4477645	Yeah, Episode 1, Final Crusade.
4477685	4478425	What's up with that?
4478625	4478845	Okay.
4479386	4480526	So anyway, it came out in 1996.
4481347	4485949	It was a 3D fighting game done by Capcom for the PlayStation.
4486349	4490312	Well, actually for the ZN1 arcade, which was basically a glorified PlayStation.
4491673	4494395	It was their first polygon fighting game.
4496878	4501062	It actually came out before Street Fighter EX, so this was kind of a big thing for them.
4503204	4507628	It was a pretty neat little game, I mean, as far as a 3D fighter goes.
4508729	4508809	It...
4510711	4521382	It didn't use the six button thing, it used a four button configuration that was a lot like how the Soul Edge and Soul Calibur games went.
4522222	4526026	You had a 3D plane, you could do ring outs, it was that type of game.
4526166	4530371	So it wasn't really anything that was special.
4531016	4535157	as far as 3D fighting games at the time, but the fact that it was Capcom's first makes it notable.
4536978	4552562	It also had these things called plasma reverses that are guard moves that you have to release at a particular point in time in the battle where it will enable you to deflect an incoming move and stun them so that you could actually attack in reverse.
4553862	4557243	And it also does extra damage as well.
4559944	4573720	It also had a combo system so that you could basically just pommel people to death and then in the arcade mode it was ten fights and depending on who you chose as your character you had a specific set of opponents that you would fight.
4576122	4577463	So it was actually a pretty good game.
4577483	4593758	You see some notable characters in there that showed up in other Capcom games, like Hayato showed up in Marvel vs. Capcom 2, and he had an appearance in Tatsunoko vs. Capcom in the Tekken Man Blade ending, which actually kind of made me giddy at the time.
4594859	4618640	and there was June who was also in the background stages of Gem Fighter and in Capcom vs. SNK 2 and in one of the wind poses of Hayato in Marvel vs. Capcom 2 and she was also in Hawkeye's ending in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 as a member of the West Coast Avengers which actually that was pretty crazy because I beat my game with him.
4619841	4634148	There was Saturn Dyer, Gammoth Gogri, Franco Garrett, Vector Rimgal, who was June's dad, Zelkin Diskay Krogan, there's a bunch of people in the game anyway.
4636509	4644493	It was a really neat game in that it used both English and Japanese voice acting for the characters.
4647414	4661320	It also spawned a Dreamcast game that was called Plasma Sword Nightmare of Blissin, which is... Actually, me finding my Dreamcast copy is what made me think of the PlayStation version.
4661640	4663241	But it was a really neat game.
4663421	4675547	I mean, for all of the stuff that it did, it may not seem a big deal today, but when it came out, I thought it was a really cool game.
4676027	4676187	So...
4677873	4678473	Star Gladiator.
4679613	4681014	You win Classic Games of the Week.
4681794	4691476	I have to admit, I didn't know a lot about this game until I'm kind of watching the... As with a lot of these classic games you pick, I didn't know a lot about this one, but I'm watching it and I'm like, wow, this looks pretty good for a PlayStation 1 game.
4691576	4691817	Yeah.
4691917	4694357	It looks a little more Dreamcast level to me.
4695297	4696938	Is it late PS1?
4697078	4698358	I'd say it was late PS1.
4698838	4705120	But you should see Star Gladiator was actually a really fun little fighter.
4705840	4709703	It had its issues, I mean, just about with any PlayStation 1 game at a time.
4710343	4714767	But you should really see Plasma Sword, because that was really fun, too.
4714887	4717529	This character here, June, I really like her, too.
4717609	4718369	With the chakram?
4718550	4722933	Yeah, well, she reminds me of that Chicken Soul Calibartina, I think it is, with a similar deal.
4722953	4723133	Yeah.
4723493	4724374	The big disc, yeah.
4726665	4729629	And actually, that's who I played this game most with, was Jean.
4730391	4734537	But you should, one of these days we'll have to hook up the Dreamcast and I'll bring over Plasma Sword.
4735018	4735719	I have a Dreamcast.
4736320	4739445	So do I. But I have Plasma Sword and I will bring it over.
4740478	4746821	This is why I need to get game streaming on my TV, because we need to do some classic NES game streaming through the Dreamcast emulation.
4747142	4747582	Good times.
4747622	4748983	That would be wrong, but funny.
4749323	4752525	All right, there it is, the classic game of the week, Star Gladiator.
4752665	4753605	Star Gladiator.
4754266	4760469	Oh, actually, I need to point out, ClericalHero404 did remind me, she's using a combo attack of Chun-Li and Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo.
4760869	4761209	Who was?
4761870	4762110	June.
4762330	4762650	Really?
4762850	4763030	Yes.
4763210	4763811	I don't remember that.
4764331	4765952	Well, there were cosplay...
4767086	4768307	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4789544	4792726	Alright, we got plenty more show to go here.
4793086	4794306	Coming up with Part B tonight.
4794326	4795667	We have a list list coming up tonight.
4795947	4797928	A few surprises in store with list lists tonight.
4797948	4798548	That's all I'm going to say.
4798588	4800289	You are definitely going to want to be here live for this.
4800909	4802410	Sorry to the podcasters in advance.
4802790	4804191	Very cool live feature tonight.
4804651	4806752	And the Fugle Question of the Week as well.
4807012	4814335	And Rapid Fire News, the Mailbag FUs of the Week, and your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR and username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
4814495	4817757	All when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4826823	4832468	Hi there, this is Flaco Jones, and you're participating with Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.
4833229	4835751	And I want to use my voice to tell you, you should all play Ni No Kuni.
4836052	4836412	It's great.
4836952	4838394	Rob, you should beat Ni No Kuni.
4838554	4842297	And now that I've said it in a bumper, you have to beat Ni No Kuni, or you have to play this bumper forever.
4844127	4844768	Thanks for watching!
4864444	4866465	Yeah, if you're actually going to play it, then yes.
4866865	4867145	I will.
4867365	4867626	Okay.
4867826	4868926	I think you'll like it, actually.
4869326	4870127	So yes, you may borrow it.
4870147	4870867	I'm fun employed.
4871147	4872248	I think Flaco would approve of that.
4872588	4874909	Yes, we did recycle a message this week.
4875129	4876390	That means we could use some new bumpers.
4876750	4880371	I did get one today, to be fair, so I'll put that in for next week.
4880612	4886814	But if you want to submit a bumper as well, you can get all the information at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
4886854	4887695	Click on Forums.
4888075	4889139	and look at the ULR forum.
4889179	4895199	It's right there at the top in a sticky thread how you can get your voice in a bumper on the show and you can tell the listeners whatever you want within reason.
4895535	4901140	I even did one in not that great Japanese, but thanks to Kuma JP for correcting my grammar.
4901340	4905563	Oh, I'm talking about the ones that, not the ones that play on the network, but the ones that bring us back here.
4905583	4907424	But I'm planning on actually doing one.
4908045	4908826	But you're on the show.
4909946	4910647	I can do a bumper.
4910667	4910947	No, you can't.
4911207	4911888	Yes, I can.
4912188	4913369	Do a bumper for Bobby's show.
4913409	4914210	I'll do one for Bobby.
4914970	4918413	I'll do one for Bobby that says, Hey, listen to this show, damn it.
4919054	4919454	Hey, listen.
4919494	4920495	Hey, listen.
4920655	4921696	Hey, listen.
4921836	4922757	Hey, listen.
4923497	4925198	But I'd have to make it high-pitched.
4925298	4925998	Hey, listen!
4926959	4931321	Anyhow, plenty more to come here on this half of Orange Lounge Radio.
4931781	4933121	But first, some rapid-fire news.
4933282	4936643	Let's take care of a lot of news this week in rapid-fire news.
4937063	4941025	Yeah, so it sort of leaked out, and then it got announced.
4941305	4951670	Halo Spartan Assault is coming out for all your favorite gaming platforms, including Windows 8 PCs, tablets, and phones.
4953863	4955924	and those are Windows 8 devices by the way.
4956524	4958666	Windows phone, Surface tablets.
4960387	4967430	Yeah, and apparently it's gonna be set between Halo 3 and 4 and is a twin-stick shooter.
4969980	4971581	Totally the title you were looking for.
4972881	4977583	There's some free-to-play games coming to the PlayStation 4.
4978684	4983206	Planetside 2 and DC Universe Online have both been confirmed for the PlayStation 4.
4984246	4986367	Although I'm not surprised because it's Sony Online.
4987428	4988588	Those are Sony Online games.
4988728	4992950	But somewhere I hear Brad from PodCulture squeeing about the DC Universe Online.
4993010	4993790	Just call it a hunch.
4994410	4995351	If his internet's back up.
4995931	5018463	so those will both be coming out and also Warframe is gonna be coming as well as a free-to-play title and yeah so I guess we're gonna see a lot of free-to-play games on PlayStation 4 so that could be good or bad I don't know free-to-play is not I like that business model so we'll see you like free?
5018803	5024086	I like free yeah it's awesome do you think there'll be a lot of free games on Xbox One?
5026408	5027328	I think there's got to be some.
5027528	5028709	That's the world we live in now.
5030509	5033290	I'm just wondering if there's going to be any MMOs on Xbox One.
5033310	5039831	Because remember, there wasn't really much on the Xbox 360 aside from Final Fantasy.
5039871	5044832	And I guess there's some pay to play MMOs, like the Defiance and stuff.
5044892	5049553	But none like actual traditional MMOs beyond Final Fantasy XI.
5049874	5050174	Don't know.
5050634	5051394	So it'll be interesting.
5052174	5066211	and last but not least new Harmonix title was announced last week and that was Fantasia Music Evolved and I saw the trailer and I'm like that has very little to do with Fantasia here's the thing
5067012	5067932	I love harmonics.
5068733	5069533	I love Disney.
5069553	5070674	Do we get elephants and tutus?
5072214	5072594	Maybe.
5072834	5074035	Actually, I love harmonics.
5074175	5074815	I love Disney.
5074955	5075976	I hate Bruno Mars.
5076336	5078117	Why was that in the trailer?
5078297	5078637	Why?
5079197	5081098	But they're going to have pop music.
5081838	5083599	They're also going to have... That's not Fantasia.
5084472	5087254	But they're also going to have the classical music as well.
5087914	5091016	And Bohemian Rhapsody is going to be in it.
5091076	5093177	Anything with Queen is instantly better.
5093337	5095018	Queen is one of the artists.
5096019	5097420	Instant fantasticness.
5097460	5098581	Just add Freddie Mercury.
5098641	5102123	Here's the tracks announced so far.
5102143	5103203	Does that make him a Disney queen?
5104444	5111094	So, Bohemian Rhapsody, Kimbra Settle Down, I don't know what that is, Fun Some Nights.
5111254	5117663	Hold on, just in case DarkSakura hadn't seen this yet, I'm playing this in studio, the little teaser trailer for this.
5117683	5119546	Let me skip ahead a little bit.
5122074	5124436	So basically it's Sorcerer Mickey mode.
5125197	5129741	Yeah, it's like you're Sorcerer Mickey, but it doesn't really tell you what the game is.
5129902	5130642	Where's the game here?
5131103	5133024	I'm left to think it's Rhythm Party.
5134526	5136207	Yeah, it looks like Rhythm Party.
5136748	5141833	Which I said Rhythm Party should have just been a retail release with all the tracks, but whatever.
5142301	5142701	You know what?
5142862	5145284	I don't care, because I don't really like Kinect games.
5146225	5155113	The thing that's kind of unique, I guess, about it, supposedly, is you can control the tempo of the song, and it changes depending on stuff you do, I guess.
5155553	5156974	So that's going to be kind of neat.
5157074	5159777	One of the tracks in there was it, AVI, what was it?
5161142	5182531	Black Wolf in chat says game trailers actually showed gameplay it's Elite Beat Agents Connect oh so it's Rhythm Party like I said and you see this face that no one in the chat room can see this is my no one Kerr face I'm willing to give it a shot just because I really love Harmonix and they always put out quality I love Harmonix but I hate Kinect games fair
5184682	5190964	and Levels is also one of the songs in there, which if I remember correctly, I think that's... Let's see here.
5193465	5195906	If I wanted to get up and dance, I'd take a Zumba class.
5197226	5197767	Oh, yeah.
5197867	5198747	Actually, I do like Levels.
5198807	5205449	Levels is awesome because that was one of the songs that was in Forza Horizon, one of my favorite ones on the dubstep thing.
5205469	5205690	Oh, yeah.
5207885	5208947	I'm digging it.
5208987	5209888	I think it'd be kind of cool.
5209948	5211570	Harmonix, can't go wrong with them.
5212151	5214134	Bobby gave me a link to this and I hadn't seen it.
5215135	5216817	Where's the actual gameplay?
5218079	5219401	I just hear a dude talking.
5219421	5220542	I want to see gameplay.
5223146	5224107	Is that under the sea?
5224127	5225668	Down where it's wetter under the sea.
5225708	5226389	Oh, see, there it is.
5226489	5226729	I guess.
5226809	5228331	Okay, so this is not a rhythm party.
5228371	5228471	Huh.
5228491	5228731	Hmm.
5228771	5228912	Hmm.
5243726	5246067	All right.
5246207	5247568	It's like curious.
5248669	5249209	Put out a demo.
5249269	5251931	It seems like a game that you... I want a new Para Para Paradise.
5251991	5252971	Then I would play my Kinect.
5253011	5253531	You know what?
5253932	5255753	You know what they really needed to have?
5256033	5261356	Is they needed to have Q games and fucking Harmonix come together and do like a new like Child of Eden type of game.
5261376	5263157	Because Child of Eden was fucking awesome.
5263257	5263857	It was pretty good.
5264358	5268600	ClericalEra404 in our chat quickly wants to know, DarkSakura, why do you hate Kinect games?
5269086	5272405	Because usually they show you what you're doing and I don't like to watch myself.
5276308	5277748	You can sometimes turn camera off.
5277809	5280209	Yeah, if I can turn the camera off, I have no problem with it.
5280349	5283150	Oh, I would have just thought you just don't like the whole flailing around.
5283170	5286311	Well, I don't mind flailing around as long as nobody else is over.
5287131	5293272	I was going to say, to be fair, the original Kinect games, not exactly very accurate a lot of times.
5293632	5294373	That was that, too.
5294533	5303775	I mean, the only fun I've ever had playing a Kinect game was doing Parapara on Dance Masters, which is why that's still the only Kinect game I will play.
5304795	5306116	Alright, let me move on with some other news.
5306437	5309419	Maybe DarkSakura instead would rather play Injustice.
5309539	5311461	I know she loves DC Universe.
5312562	5313763	Do I like DC Universe?
5314384	5314724	No.
5315845	5317366	But apparently Injustice is pretty good.
5317426	5320529	Somebody said Injustice is the best thing going on in DC Universe right now.
5320609	5320909	DarkSakura.com
5335766	5335946	Why?
5336126	5336467	Why not?
5336747	5337067	Don't care.
5337087	5337408	Why not?
5337488	5341831	Because they have a whole bunch of other DC superheroes that they could put in the game.
5341851	5342992	Scorpion's a superhero.
5343012	5343693	No, he's not.
5343753	5351159	No, he's like fucking, it's like, oh, hey, it's Scorpion, but I can't do any of my bloody moves because it's fucking teen rated.
5351660	5355643	You know, that's what happened with the whole Mortal Kombat versus DC universe.
5355783	5359106	Oh, sorry, I can't behead Batman because it's fucking teen rated.
5359947	5360768	I don't know, whatever.
5360788	5361889	It sounds lame.
5362710	5364332	I honestly did not find the game fun.
5364572	5364853	The end.
5366114	5378572	Also, information on the new voice of Snake, because you know, a certain co-host of mine didn't ruin this earlier in the show, but Kiefer Sutherland confirmed as the voice of Snake in Metal Gear Solid 5, not David Hader.
5379073	5384017	Now, I think this was just like buzz earlier.
5384277	5392784	We didn't have confirmation, but now that it's in the trailer, because the Konami whole thing, which we haven't even brought up in the show yet, but Konami had their whole little movie thing come up, and this was part of it.
5393444	5395806	So, that's that.
5397387	5413622	So, that to me sounds like the whole situation where, you know, it's the How I Met Your Mother situation where you have, you know, Bob Saget as the narrator, he's supposed to be the father, but yeah, his voice isn't obviously going to change, you know, over the default Ted Mosley voice that, you know, the characters have.
5414282	5414883	It's just different.
5416204	5416464	All right.
5416764	5421328	And I wonder if we ever get a movie, if we'll have, you know, Kiefer Sutherland playing Snake.
5422309	5430416	EA, hopefully giving some final clarity to some of the shady things they've said about the Wii U in the past, courtesy of EA president Frank Gabow.
5430796	5435600	Now, I'm going to admit, I think we brought up something similar to this last week, but this is coming from EA president of labels.
5435620	5436401	This is somebody else.
5437181	5438523	No, they have nothing coming.
5438543	5439163	There's nothing coming.
5460080	5465124	We're really excited about the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4, and that's a pretty big endeavor in and of itself.
5465324	5465804	I wonder why.
5466285	5472209	We have four titles out on the Wii U that are active right now, so looking at how things unfold, that's where our focus is right now.
5472730	5474391	Gen 3 is an awesome platform.
5474431	5480416	It has a huge audience, has a lot of capability, and we're going to continue to publish games on Gen 3 for as long as there is an audience there.
5480796	5484319	We have a tendency as a company to support the last gen platforms for many, many years.
5484719	5489583	I can tell you we have products planned for next year, the year after that, and the year after that for Gen 3 for sure.
5491003	5517751	well yeah because they keep pumping out Madden sequels and stuff like that on like PlayStation 2 and Xbox up to like way past the console's life cycles and stuff but it doesn't necessarily mean you're gonna see like big games on there the honest blunt way I could say this is that third party games aren't really what a lot of people go to Nintendo for anyway I mean they'll help of course I mean certainly the Sega partnership with Sonic which is so weird
5518411	5521632	DarkSakura I'm sorry, I was just getting out my DC hate out of my system
5549693	5550854	Can't we all just get along?
5551194	5552335	No, Marvel all the way.
5552495	5556177	Hey, listen, if it's any consolation, Deadpool comes out in a couple weeks anyway.
5556357	5557178	I know!
5557358	5559239	I'm so happy.
5561240	5561721	So happy.
5562061	5565123	Anyway, well, how about some other really quick news, okay?
5566087	5566807	Diablo 3.
5568408	5575571	We've seen an announcement before that it's going to be on the PS3 and PS4.
5575691	5585234	They're also bringing it out on Xbox 360, but have no plans to bring it out for any other system, which is a polite fuck you to Xbone, as I'm still going to call it forever.
5586835	5590897	Honestly, a lot of us have been playing it on PC already, so who cares?
5591997	5616712	and then this makes me really happy is that Hatsune Miku Project Diva F is going to be coming out in North America in August and I'm gonna get it there's a demo on June 11th and so excited because I love the Project Diva games and then last but not least Metal Gear Rising Revengeance
5617572	5623014	If anyone likes stories about Raiden, well, you get to play more Raiden because it's going to be on PC.
5623874	5624254	The end.
5624354	5630157	They're also bringing, I think, the original Lords of Shadows to PC as well, so that'll be interesting.
5632097	5633958	All right, let's go to the Fugle Question of the Week.
5634898	5640200	Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and Google communities.
5641380	5642621	You put it together and it's Fugle!
5644947	5649230	We had a fun idea for this week because, you know, E3 really kicks off tomorrow.
5649510	5653232	The show floor doesn't open until Tuesday, but there's a shit ton of press conferences tomorrow.
5653912	5655673	And so everybody's going to be talking about this tomorrow.
5656073	5658735	So we thought we would go to Facebook and Google and ask.
5658795	5662137	It's that time of year to ask everyone, what's your E3 predictions?
5662935	5666478	However, we at OLR, we like to do things a little differently and maybe a little bit silly.
5667058	5670601	So we only want your E3 predictions in a haiku format.
5671201	5673863	That would be five, seven, five, remember?
5674684	5677926	Guess, OL Army, what will occur at E3?
5678406	5680027	Games of win or fail?
5680508	5682209	That was my haiku to the listeners.
5683570	5684791	Loki, you look so impressed.
5686107	5687027	That wasn't bad, actually.
5687187	5687807	Alright, here we go.
5688188	5688888	Some haikus.
5689128	5692809	Now, DarkSakura, I want you to count the syllables and tell me who failed.
5692909	5694269	For the record, Rob?
5694309	5695389	There are some fails in here.
5695509	5696370	For the record, Rob?
5696810	5698350	The plural of haiku is haiku.
5699630	5700371	Haikuzis.
5701771	5702491	The haikuza.
5704091	5705372	Let's go to the haikuza.
5706272	5707092	Haikuzerzis.
5708152	5709333	You know what?
5709353	5709633	Bite me.
5711553	5712494	Haiku gaggle.
5712674	5712954	All right.
5715097	5718120	And all in good fun about those of you that fail, by the way.
5718280	5724166	Edgar R. says, Call of Duty Ghost, Dogs of War, X-Bone exclusive.
5725547	5726828	I think Dogs of War.
5726948	5727569	That's wrong.
5727669	5729271	That's not a haiku.
5729311	5729851	You lose.
5731054	5735596	It's also already confirmed that as an exclusive to the Xbox One.
5736897	5737857	I appreciate the effort.
5737897	5739858	Porkchop sends this entry.
5740398	5745560	I don't really mind as long as they don't release more shit EA games.
5746420	5747061	Bravo!
5748981	5749562	Tiara.
5750682	5754204	All I really care is about... Excuse me, I fucked that up.
5754224	5754424	Sorry.
5754704	5757605	All I really care about is Dragon Age 3.
5758846	5759886	I love Bioware.
5761388	5762928	No, she loves Anders.
5764329	5765529	She loves Sir Pounce a lot.
5765709	5767289	So she gets a fail for lying.
5767649	5767989	No.
5769350	5769650	All right.
5770090	5774971	Honestly, that's about... She named her cat Sir Pounce a lot.
5775211	5779231	All right, this is from Mason D. Want more Pokemon?
5779651	5783312	Pokemon versus for Wii U. Pokemon get hype.
5784132	5786673	With a big white smiley face underneath that, no less.
5788346	5790128	Blood Drunk submits the following.
5790168	5791129	That's a great name.
5792910	5793571	Blood Drunk.
5794892	5798295	I don't know if Blood Drunk is a newer listener, but I've noticed his name on the VOG leaderboard.
5798355	5800217	So he is a big participant.
5800277	5803940	So a win to you, no matter how good or bad your haiku is.
5803980	5804321	Here we go.
5804661	5805302	From Blood Drunk.
5806002	5807664	Connect watches you fap.
5808982	5810023	I think that's six syllables.
5810243	5811904	Connect watches you fap.
5812105	5812665	Six syllables.
5813105	5813506	That's all right.
5813846	5814627	We still like his name.
5814987	5816228	Connect watches you fap.
5817009	5818730	LOLPS4DRM.
5819310	5820331	Nintendo shows games?
5823334	5823594	All right.
5823734	5824895	Not quite a haiku, but hey.
5825275	5825675	Close enough.
5826396	5827137	It's a haikuga.
5828117	5828798	It's a haikuger.

5832121	5833382	Predicting prices.
5834202	5836864	Xbox, five bills, four with subs.
5837445	5837825	Sony, $450,000.
5840554	5842415	Good way to put your predictions in.
5843295	5845456	I think you might be highballing it a little bit, but we'll see.
5846376	5848357	Haseo Sumiwagawa submits the following.
5849077	5850657	Xbox One fucks up.
5851238	5853138	Nintendo might steal the show.
5853598	5855099	PS4, ooh pretty.
5857300	5858220	That was six syllables.
5858340	5858740	That's all right.
5859680	5861281	Liam C. submits the following.
5862041	5865502	The Last Guardian, a brand new Uncharted game.
5866002	5867283	Kinect flops badly.
5867923	5868023	Hmm.
5869136	5869356	Good.
5870517	5873018	Codeman says, what will E3 bring?
5873638	5875159	Nintendo surprise maybe?
5876019	5877780	Xbone will has sports.

5881761	5883102	From ClericalEra404.
5883242	5883562	All right.
5884663	5886223	Sony has less trust.
5886343	5888824	Nintendo rules us all, but it all ends well.
5890485	5890985	We'll see.
5892126	5892566	We'll see.
5892726	5893066	All right.
5893146	5894267	Ragenator says, E to the three.
5894287	5895167	E to the three.
5896052	5897293	That's four syllables.
5897573	5898314	You lose.
5898694	5899855	Why can't people count?
5901277	5902157	E to the three.
5902838	5903238	MS.
5903539	5904600	Oh, no, they didn't.

5906681	5907382	He could do E fucking three, yo.
5911511	5913412	All right, Captain Spike.

5915834	5916495	Yay, Spike.
5916575	5917235	We love Spike.
5917275	5919357	He's full of win, no matter if his haiku is fail or not.
5919397	5919697	Here it is.
5920258	5921599	Nintendo no show.
5922219	5924080	Sony and MS hate us all.
5924461	5925862	The worst E3 ever.
5929805	5930985	Worst E3 ever.
5932086	5932827	I love Spike.
5932947	5933747	Here's HitStun.
5934875	5944562	Next Gen Consoles, Meh, Nothing PS3 Can't Do, Game of Show, DuckTales That's a good one.
5944602	5945903	That's my favorite one so far, I think.
5946204	5948885	Did you watch the last trailer they put out?
5949906	5951507	Not since... It's the side-by-side.
5952208	5953269	Oh, no, I didn't see that one.
5953309	5956131	They did one comparing the old DuckTales to the new one.
5956951	5958753	Somebody on Tumblr posted it a while back.
5959093	5961455	I'll see if I can't find it and repost it, but it was pretty neat.
5962096	5963777	Alright, here's SSJ100 Matt Sentry.
5964557	5965658	Anticipation.
5966479	5967899	Elated disappointment.
5968640	5969800	Gamers are winners.
5970981	5973302	Wouldn't that be losers if we're disappointed, though?
5974383	5979246	And I got excited because when he said anticipation, it made me think, oh, maybe that's the Rare franchise they're bringing back.
5979526	5986610	Because y'all know I could give two fucks about Killer Instinct or Banjo-Kazooie when Rare could remake Anticipation.
5987250	5987731	Just saying.
5988731	5990993	You know you want to play as the ice cream cone again, bouncing around the board.
5991193	5991533	Just saying.
5992577	5993698	I want ice cream right now.
5993898	5996419	This is from Steven M. What about another cameo?
5997920	5998560	Hell no.
5998961	6003523	Alright, Steven M. says like I had to think about what the fuck game is he talking about?
6003643	6004283	Oh god.
6004704	6008045	Alright, Steven M. Must be online Xbox.
6008606	6009746	Wii U will die.
6010347	6012048	We finally get Last Guardian.
6012918	6013418	I think you did 557.
6013618	6020302	I like especially since you gave them how to do a haiku.
6020923	6023604	I put right there, as a reminder, a haiku is 575.
6023685	6025406	We can't read.
6025426	6027267	What's a syllable?
6029348	6030589	We love our listeners.
6030609	6032790	We're just giving you shit.
6032990	6034071	I give everybody shit.
6034111	6036412	We just want to educate you all this week on haikuses.
6036913	6038694	Yeah, study some damn literature.
6038714	6038794	Fuck.
6038854	6039174	Fuck.
6040789	6041590	Was that a haiku?
6044512	6046253	No, not quite.
6046333	6047394	I'll make one, though, if you like.
6047594	6047794	Yes.
6048254	6049955	You think of one while I read the rest of these.
6050096	6050376	All right.
6050556	6053258	Andy R. says, I don't really know.
6053898	6055339	A giant enemy crab?
6055960	6056700	Ridge Racer 2.
6058241	6060903	Ridge Racer 2 is four syllables.
6061623	6062824	Andy, you're killing me.
6063104	6063925	That would have been great for 2006.
6067469	6069992	What I want this year is to see really good games and VOG to hit big.
6083139	6086081	Somebody kissing a little VOG behind in that response.
6086202	6086502	Love it.
6086522	6087182	Thank you, Actdeft.
6087723	6090825	Flaco Jones says, Xbox and Sony.
6091345	6093106	Their DRM kills gaming.
6093567	6094487	What's a Nintendo?
6094868	6095508	Okay, I got one.
6095808	6096049	All right.
6096829	6097790	Let me make sure I have it right.
6098310	6099011	Well, let me read.
6099051	6099691	We'll do yours last.
6099831	6100612	We do the rest of these.
6100712	6101032	Forget it.
6101212	6101412	All right.
6102013	6102693	Okay, go.
6103314	6104174	Use the internet.
6104815	6106736	There are haiku examples.
6108097	6108297	Hold on.
6108358	6110119	There are haiku examples.
6110259	6110519	Okay.
6110539	6111800	Okay.
6112421	6113742	Really use Google.
6115183	6115563	Okay.
6117064	6117365	Fuck.
6117565	6117785	All right.
6117845	6121728	Technus says use some fucking Google.
6121888	6122448	Oh, no, it doesn't work.
6122468	6123549	All right.
6124410	6126611	Technus says people still complain.
6127091	6129113	Rare shows next gen Battletoads.
6129473	6130474	Why are you still hating?
6132293	6132793	Never know.
6133674	6136796	Redertainment says, oh, it's a double haiku.
6137437	6139739	Redertainment's always got to fucking show everybody up.
6139799	6140019	All right.
6140379	6140799	Here we go.
6140819	6141080	That's okay.
6141100	6141480	I love it.
6141640	6141860	All right.
6141880	6144562	Redertainment says, gamers hate everything.
6145203	6146884	Everything will receive scorn.
6147224	6148465	Twitter will explode.
6149166	6149526	Good one.
6149746	6153249	Gamers will not see a wanted not seen project.
6153629	6154650	The Last Guardian.
6155450	6155831	We got it.
6156771	6158733	Since he did two, we got another one from Clerical Error.
6159161	6160882	Alright, wait, let me read this last one from Google+.
6161442	6163602	From Travis H. Sony is epic.
6164183	6165643	Xbone will be eaten up.
6166043	6167303	Long live PlayStation.
6168864	6170344	We'll see how that press conference goes.
6170464	6172825	I'm approaching it with cautious optimism, Travis.
6173045	6173985	Cautious optimism.
6174646	6175986	Alright, last but not least.
6176126	6178807	Nintendo has props, but Sony has some issues.
6179007	6179787	I guess we should wait.
6181488	6182168	That one was good.
6183161	6202683	YYR in chat can't you people count you have offended Jamie study some damn books you win the internet YYR Xbox One console TV TV TV sports what's wrong deal with it that's good did you do that one by yourself I just did that I love it I love it
6204429	6214830	after I posted the question use that Mensa thing for something there you go Jamie came to me tonight she said you should make every week be a haiku because they're short alright
6217375	6219796	Alright, and SSJ100 Matt bringing some clarity.
6220396	6223116	Anticipation because gamers are anticipating a lot for E3.
6223356	6226217	Elated disappointment because people will be either happy or disappointed.
6226657	6231238	Gamers are winners because no matter what gamers win because we have all these new games to play.
6232198	6232478	Okay.
6232898	6233178	Okay.
6233878	6234138	Alright.
6234419	6237499	Anyhow, I know we gave some of you a bad time, but that was a really fun topic.
6237539	6238739	So thank you everybody for trying.
6238899	6239860	I love you, YYR.
6240300	6240560	Alright.
6242380	6243700	Do I need to give you two a moment?
6243760	6244441	Should I sit back?
6244461	6244621	No.
6244641	6245601	I don't love you in that way.
6245821	6246061	Alright.
6247796	6250197	Alright, just a few more stories and then listless tonight.
6250357	6251077	But first, Loki.
6252138	6252618	Alright.
6253278	6255839	Codeman is reminding me that I need to play more Borderlands 2.
6256360	6258060	Because I haven't touched it on PC yet.
6259141	6261842	Even though I finished the game like three times on 360.
6263563	6267064	So yes, unfortunately there was some massive layoffs at Zynga.
6268085	6272667	Also including the closure of OMG Pop.
6274088	6276611	And so they closed the office there.
6276891	6283859	Also, they closed the Zynga office in Los Angeles, Dallas, and New York.
6287038	6289519	I know there was layoffs in all of their offices.
6289539	6296761	I think about 520 or 540 or something like that.
6297601	6298461	People were laid off.
6298481	6300862	Actually, I was reaching out to one of my friends.
6301442	6307164	She's a concept artist and artist over at Zynga in San Francisco.
6307204	6308544	I think, though, she's pretty high up.
6308744	6310865	I don't think she's affected by it.
6311983	6312924	Yeah, that kind of sucks.
6314444	6330414	And, of course, a lot of horror stories coming out about how things were run and stuff like that and how they were talking about the terms they used for cloning things, like taking games like Tiny Tower and turning them into Dream Heights or whatever.
6333095	6333375	I don't know.
6333535	6334256	It's kind of sickening.
6337217	6338758	So maybe this is the beginning of the end.
6339519	6341720	This is surely not too good for them.
6345262	6355789	Well, I mean, I don't like to poke fun or tease or celebrate layoffs, especially like Loki says, he has friends that are at Zynga and so forth.
6355829	6359672	But I mean, we always knew Zynga had a really questionable business model.
6359792	6363775	And I think people bought into that way too fast.
6363835	6366877	And Zynga expanded way too fast over Farmville.
6367437	6371280	And I think it just goes to show Farmville was kind of a one-hit wonder, I hate to say.
6371940	6372480	I mean, I don't know.
6372520	6377122	Some would argue with me that, well, there were other Facebook's games and blah, blah, blah, blah, but... Well, it's like this.
6377522	6380923	When the news came out about them copying games, I mean, that was just shitty.
6381183	6387585	A-ha had good albums and good music, but the only song anyone ever cared about was Take On Me.
6388165	6391906	That is quite possibly the best possible comparison somebody could have made in this scenario.
6392046	6399109	Because, remember, I had that thing of Dan singing the lyrics to the synth part with One Hit Wonder instead of the...
6400544	6405988	By the way, before I get to the next news story, I just got a text message, and I'll let you guess where this is from, DarkSakura.
6406008	6406389	Are you ready?
6406849	6408890	All right, here's the text message I just got.
6409611	6411172	Haiku game is weak.
6411693	6413394	Sometimes we just can't even.
6413714	6414835	DarkSakura mad.
6416136	6416416	Girl.
6416776	6417317	It's from Alan.
6417457	6417717	I know.
6419979	6420559	I thought that was good.
6421000	6422401	All right, let's see.
6422421	6425223	Going into some news about the Ouya.
6426741	6427622	Sonic the Hedgehog 4, Sonic CD
6445658	6448861	Well, I mean, still, though, it's Sega support for the Ouya, so that's kind of cool.
6448901	6450183	How about some Phantasy Star Online?
6450203	6450603	Yeah, huh?
6450803	6451063	All right.
6451344	6452165	Maybe that's wishful thinking.
6452645	6455808	They're coming out on June 27th in the Ouya store, $7 each.
6455928	6460112	This is Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Episode 1, Episode 2, and Sonic CD.
6460533	6466959	No idea if the Ouya version will include fun for Sonic the Hedgehog 4, because unfortunately that was missing in the earlier versions.
6468020	6468280	Anybody?
6468580	6468801	All right.
6470302	6477664	The Ouya ports, they say, are optimized for the console's Tegra 3 processor and free trial versions will be available.
6478424	6490588	Sega of America director of mobile business, David Zemke, interesting where this is coming from, was praising Ouya's, quote, disruptive technology and, quote, they want to see what these technologies can do and be a part of it from the beginning.
6491028	6495349	We're always looking for other titles and there may be some future titles that we'd like to bring over.
6495709	6500271	For us, we're always trying to bring the best gaming experience to the right platforms.
6500611	6503213	It's a delicate mix of how and when to do it.
6504533	6504773	Hmm.
6505334	6508135	That's right after the launch of the OUYA, by the way, which is June 25th.
6508495	6510236	The day before my birthday, y'all.
6510256	6510976	Just saying.
6511537	6511817	All right.
6513478	6513858	Anyhow.
6516099	6518320	DarkSakura, one more story and then we'll get into Listless tonight.
6518620	6520861	Sorry, we were just having a discussion about Turian's mutt.
6522242	6522662	Of course.
6523463	6523983	No, not really.
6525364	6542298	Something from Double Fine, the game Massive Chalice, that basically, as they were saying that there was going to be a gay relationship in the game that had been taken out, and now the project leader feels shitty because people on Kickstarter say, no, we want it.
6542879	6543759	So he's putting it in.
6545112	6545432	As of today.
6575784	6576665	All that from feedback.
6577406	6578107	That's what you want.
6578147	6578887	We're putting it back in.
6579048	6588817	That's kind of cool though because that makes it seem like Kickstarter really is a place for like... Not to say they're investors or whatever because Kickstarter is with the backing or whatever but that they get a say.
6588918	6590359	That these people really had a say.
6590519	6590860	Well, yeah.
6591480	6599708	I mean, if you look at it this way, it is probably the best type of board meeting you can ever expect because you've got real-time feedback going in.
6600688	6600989	All right.
6601009	6601569	So I think it's good.
6602070	6605753	Is this something that you would consider backing or a game that you might think you're going to buy?
6606053	6609577	I told you what I'm waiting for for my first backing.
6610257	6610738	No, what?
6611598	6617684	Well, unless he's already put it up, I'm waiting for the understanding video games.
6619696	6620077	I don't remember.
6620097	6621178	Can you refresh my memory about this?
6621198	6621819	That Seg's doing?
6622840	6625483	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
6625563	6628006	I wanted... There was another name it was, though.
6628667	6629788	But yeah, he hasn't put it up yet.
6629848	6630629	But I think he's going to.
6630849	6633272	I'm going to give my Kickstarter cherry to Seg.
6635294	6636555	Love, love, love, love.
6637135	6639516	That's a fair place to give your Kickstarter, Terry.
6639676	6639896	Yeah.
6640376	6641617	All right.
6643038	6644378	I'm trying to get this.
6644699	6649261	Well, we're going to do listless now, except I'm having a little problem with the connection.
6650121	6651222	Let's see if we can get it there.
6652082	6658225	We're going to call an old friend of ours here at Orange Lounge Radio to help us out with Listless tonight, and hopefully the internet will hold up.
6658666	6659846	But I think we're connected now.
6659886	6660907	Are you there, old friend?
6661427	6661948	Hello.
6662128	6663789	Hey, Bobby Blackwolf, how you doing?
6664329	6665249	I'm doing good.
6665410	6666310	Rob called you old.
6666550	6668491	Shouldn't he be like old chum?
6668711	6671453	Yeah, I'm not Adam West in Batman, okay?
6672153	6672834	How you doing, Bobby?
6673494	6674034	I'm doing good.
6674054	6676556	I've been playing Animal Crossing since I got off the air.
6676696	6677857	Finally have time to get into that, huh?
6677877	6678537	What do you think so far?
6679629	6700649	it's Animal Crossing I'm very sad because everybody else has this and I don't even have a 3DS so whatever you gotta bug Dan no because I don't have a job so we're not buying one you have to have a J-O-B to have a 3DS you're gonna need to get on MTurk I've even already been in someone else's town so my fruit collection is growing wow
6701249	6702130	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6725729	6726670	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6746625	6748046	I used Pico.
6748126	6748306	Okay.
6767075	6768016	Pine was the male.
6768136	6769957	Yeah, one was email and one was Pico.
6770857	6772078	Shows you my knowledge of Unix.
6772178	6773219	I haven't used it in a while.
6773559	6777901	But you coded away in VI this new E3.VOGnetwork.com.
6777921	6779462	What are you hoping comes of this?
6781981	6782442	I don't know.
6783042	6786105	This is me saying, this is an idea I have.
6786545	6787526	I wonder if it'll work.
6787986	6791750	And in the past, I've had these ideas, and they didn't work, and then two years later, everybody's doing them.
6792330	6794572	So we'll see if this is another one of those.
6794912	6795333	We'll see.
6795593	6801818	So be sure to check it out, guys, if you haven't seen it yet, e3.vognetwork.com, especially those of you listening on the podcast.
6802519	6805221	Everything will open up on Monday night for the question and answer.
6805281	6808284	But tonight, live, you can at least watch the video.
6808784	6814070	and learn everything you're going to need to know for when everything goes live with the question asking.
6814331	6820117	I've already been given the blacklist against asking anything about Hello Kitty games, so I'm not going to do that.
6821339	6821819	Fair enough.
6822460	6822760	All right.
6824082	6826184	So you're leaving for E3 tomorrow, right?
6826845	6827125	Correct.
6827145	6827626	Tomorrow morning.
6827846	6828066	Yeah.
6828187	6829388	And what's your very first appointment?
6832425	6833366	Bethesda, I think.
6834507	6835408	Yeah, I think it's Bethesda.
6836128	6836889	It's at two o'clock.
6836909	6841594	That way I can get there and see things from noon to two and kind of get my way to land.
6841614	6843015	But I think, yeah, it's Bethesda at two.
6844036	6847800	I know we're about to get into the listless here about thing I most want to happen at E3 2013.
6848320	6854226	But seriously, off the record, what are you personally like looking forward to getting your hands on yourself and checking out?
6856417	6860498	This is my standard answer, and everybody calls it a cop-out, but I don't care.
6860699	6862479	Oh no, I know what you're going to say, and I think it's a great answer.
6863100	6865401	It's the game I haven't heard of yet.
6866497	6867238	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6887301	6887701	DarkSakura.com
6907472	6907973	Catamari Damacy
6922972	6924774	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6938431	6943056	All seriousness though, we are going to play listless here, but there's one other reason I have you here tonight.
6943536	6948240	And there's been a theme here at VOG Network the past couple weeks, and that is that the game is always changing.
6948801	6951584	And the game is changing again tonight, isn't it Bobby?
6952084	6952745	That's right.
6953065	6953686	What is new?
6953726	6956248	What did you do for us this week?
6956268	6957809	I hope you're logged into the site.
6958556	6964023	Everybody, because you no longer have to learn how to private message Rob to play listless.
6965064	6971151	If you've ever done any of the live polls here on VOG, then you kind of know where to look.
6972172	6973113	That's where you're going to want to look.
6973654	6973974	All right.
6974495	6977058	So with that, it's time to start some listless.
6980492	6981613	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6996790	6997891	at E3 2013.
6999112	7002714	And once everything is up on the list, then we will go around and this is what has to happen.
7002754	7005696	We have to strike the items that are not worthy of the list.
7006016	7009198	It's a very difficult, painful process, but it must be done.
7009578	7017263	Remember, there is a new rule that is still in play, however, and that is that when a host has two items eliminated from the list, the third gets immunity.
7017603	7019865	So a person's list cannot be completely decimated.
7020285	7021026	All right, here it is.
7021106	7024568	The topic, thing I most want to happen at E3 2013.
7026489	7036793	Let's put it up on the board at live.vognetwork.com For those of you that are logged in right now, you will start to see the board and our answers as we fill it in.
7037553	7038554	Hopefully, right Bobby?
7038594	7039974	That's also part of the reason you're on the line.
7040775	7041015	Yes.
7041895	7043155	Alright, I made it live.
7043556	7043876	What's that?
7044696	7045657	I'm keeping a watch on it.
7073888	7077669	But I'm going to say the easy answer, a new F-Zero.
7080150	7083912	You know, I think that's a very good, safe answer.
7084192	7087993	And I think that is one that can't possibly get eliminated no matter what happens.
7088374	7089854	Of course, that's always famous last words.
7090314	7091935	Yeah, thanks for dooming that answer.
7092936	7094277	Alright, let's put it up on the board.
7094337	7096318	Bobby locks in a new F-Zero.
7096458	7101580	Alright, DarkSakura, what is the number three thing that you want to see happen at E3 2013?
7102401	7107924	Like, it's probably, it won't happen, but I would love to have Sega announce that they're back in the console business.
7109004	7111645	It won't happen, but it's what I want.
7113006	7116548	Alright, Sega is back in the console business.
7116588	7117568	Let's put it up on the board.
7117628	7118109	Dreamcast 2?
7120635	7123637	They should call it the Sega Utopia.
7124758	7125619	The Sega Utopia.
7126019	7128381	Okay, my turn for a number three answer.
7129061	7143511	I'm going to say... I'm going to have to figure out how to fit this in the board, but my number three answer is the Microsoft server crashes at the show causing all the Xbox Ones to stop playing games after Wednesday.
7143531	7144212	Okay.
7144813	7147880	because you know every 24 hours it's got to check in, right?
7148782	7152230	So the Microsoft server crashes for 24 hours.
7152270	7153273	I guess that's how I'll shorten it.
7160508	7162029	All right, putting that up on the board right now.
7163209	7164750	Boy, Bobby would be very sad.
7165071	7170554	Bobby, wouldn't you be sad if you didn't get to play an Xbox One and then all of a sudden the servers crash for 24 hours?
7172115	7175637	Yeah, but then I'd laugh.
7175978	7176518	Then you'd laugh.
7176558	7176798	All right.
7177499	7178980	Loki, your number three answer.
7180001	7187475	Um, just because I want to get this out of the way, Microsoft and Sony go back on their plans for DRM.
7187535	7188897	It stays the way it is now.
7190555	7194056	I love how you threw in and Sony when we don't really know yet.
7194136	7194876	Oh, we know.
7196897	7197497	Let's be honest.
7197697	7198997	No one's kidding themselves.
7199157	7200818	Alright, fair enough.
7200838	7201698	Let's put that up on the board.
7201738	7205359	Loki says MS and Sony go back on their DRM plans.
7205739	7209640	Alright, Bobby, we're to you for your number two answer tonight for Listless.
7209700	7211961	Thing you most want to see happen at E3 2013.
7212821	7217462	I want to see E3 announce that Kensha Hall will be returning next year.
7218939	7219920	Damn it, you stole mine.
7221461	7221981	Oh, really?
7222081	7223042	You had that on your list.
7223162	7223422	Uh-oh.
7223542	7223882	I did.
7223902	7224503	These things happen.
7224523	7225543	You better check the chat room.
7225683	7226824	Bobby just threw that up on the board.
7226924	7229446	E3 announces the return of Kensha Hall.
7230706	7233168	And maybe a new ex-Tango that goes with that.
7233208	7233588	I don't know.
7234189	7234589	We'll see.
7235029	7237291	All right, DarkSakura, what's your number two answer?
7238812	7244015	Sony uses Final Fantasy VII to display an engine without a release of Final Fantasy VII Remake.
7245538	7252568	So basically they're going to repeat what they did with PlayStation 3 and show a Final Fantasy tech demo that never happens.
7252629	7254832	Final Fantasy tech demo that never results in a game.
7254852	7258878	That'd be awesome if it was in a new Final Fantasy engine.
7259659	7259879	Hey!
7259919	7262221	Yeah, it looks like Advent Children.
7262481	7263222	Nope, never gonna get it.
7263442	7264983	Alright, I'm gonna put this up on the board.
7265044	7268326	Final Fantasy VII PS4 tech demo that never is a real game.
7268667	7268907	Yes.
7268927	7272630	I think that should fit within the confines of our shiny new board.
7273230	7279155	Live.VogNetwork.com Again, if you are listening live on this Sunday night, be ready to participate because you're gonna vote through the site as well.
7279235	7283699	Live.VogNetwork.com I mean, granted, if Final Fantasy VII was remade, yeah, I'd play it.
7284900	7286081	But, let's be realistic.
7288431	7288931	My turn.
7289451	7290331	My number two answer.
7291052	7297755	Nintendo announces their plan to win the new generation of gaming by adding porn to Miiverse.
7299035	7299496	Why not?
7299556	7302057	The Miiverse porn channel.
7302937	7304278	No, it's WiiWiiverse.
7309380	7312146	Come on, that's how you win the console wars.
7312486	7314009	Alright, I'm gonna throw that up on the board.
7315693	7317256	Alright, Loki, your number two answer.
7318057	7319180	Super Mario RPG 2.
7322352	7325574	That'll never fucking happen, Loki.
7325694	7326214	Why, though?
7326374	7328175	It's such a fantastic game.
7328536	7331037	And I'm sorry, I understand that there are the Paper Mario games.
7331377	7333619	And granted, Super Paper Mario was actually a pretty fun game.
7333679	7335840	It was actually one of the games I liked the most on the Wii.
7336280	7338521	But I would just like a sequel.
7338721	7339962	You know, Square Enix, come on.
7340182	7340983	That would be awesome.
7341543	7343124	Alright, we'll throw that up on the board.
7343504	7345425	Alright, it's time for the number one answers.
7345485	7349708	Let's go around and collect them for the thing you most want to see happen at E3 2013.
7350668	7351769	Bobby Blackwolf, our guest.
7353314	7354194	So picture this.
7356736	7363739	Somehow, Valve does some kind of event, goes on their own stage, press conference.
7364940	7365800	Everybody's in there.
7366781	7368502	Gabe Newell walks out on stage.
7370443	7374985	Half-Life 3, available right now, drops the mic and walks off stage.
7377717	7378998	That would win E3.
7384284	7388269	I'm typing that up as Half-Life 3 announcement followed by mic drop.
7389770	7390211	Sound fair?
7391132	7391772	Release.
7392073	7393294	Oh, excuse me.
7393334	7393915	Excuse me.
7396826	7398067	DarkSakura, what's your number one answer?
7398187	7399928	The new Mass Effect announced with good writing
7425094	7427935	New Mass Effect announced, but with good writing.
7428415	7428855	There it is.
7428915	7431736	It's up on the board and I totally know which answer Bobby's going to strike.
7431916	7432416	You know what?
7432716	7436137	If Bobby touches it, I will get... Never mind.
7436197	7436997	I won't even say it.
7437957	7438357	All right.
7438577	7440118	You leave my Mass Effect alone.
7441638	7443218	It's a scientific process, DarkSakura.
7443498	7443758	All right.
7443898	7445119	My number one answer.
7445759	7447059	Take faith in this, DarkSakura.
7447079	7448960	I think you will be okay with this as a backup.
7449040	7452420	I know you will because my answer is... If Bobby doesn't get rid of it too.
7452640	7453041	He might.
7453361	7454181	My answer is...
7454921	7461850	The Guardian Legend 2 on Wii U. Technically, there was a Guardian Legend 2.
7462431	7463633	It's the one that we got in the US.
7464894	7465155	Shut up.
7465195	7465775	That was Guardic 2.
7466056	7466536	You shut up.
7467137	7467478	Fine.
7468584	7472087	Preferably WayForward would somehow be involved because they're really good at retro boots.
7472107	7474969	RageFader said Garrus gets his own game.
7475690	7478792	That would be like a Silent Scope Turian edition.
7480294	7484457	Alright, last but not least, Loki, one spot left on the board.
7484657	7486439	What are you going to put in the list tonight?
7489061	7491283	Grand Theft Auto or Saints Row Online.
7493484	7495325	An MMO for a sandbox game.
7495745	7496286	Yeah, I know.
7496306	7503771	I guess we already have... They have a free-to-play MMO right now.
7503871	7504771	ATB or whatever?
7504791	7506792	Yeah, ATB.
7506812	7507693	It's not the same.
7508774	7510795	A GTA or Saints Row MMO.
7511115	7511535	There it is.
7511956	7514838	Let's recap before we get to the very difficult part.
7515698	7540667	A new F-Zero Sega is back in the console business Microsoft server crashes for 24 hours Microsoft and Sony go back on their DRM plans E3 announces the return of Kensha Hall Final Fantasy VII PlayStation 4 tech demo that it never is a real game Porn to Miiverse Super Mario RPG 2 Half-Life 3 released followed by a mic drop New Mass Effect announced but with good writing The Guardian Legend 2 on Wii U
7541347	7544550	and Grand Theft Auto or Saints Row MMO.
7545031	7546852	That's a lot of answers tonight.
7547773	7553499	It's getting crowded up here, so unfortunately it's time to ask which of these is not worthy of the list.
7553999	7559284	Bobby Blackwolf, I know you don't want to do it, but you're going to have to make one of us mad by eliminating something off the list.
7559304	7559824	What's it going to be?
7560525	7561426	Porn to me-verse.
7563288	7565089	Oh, Bobby, you're killing me.
7565169	7566711	Why are you getting rid of porn, though?
7571043	7573464	Because... Because the Wii U is a wholesome system?
7573784	7574325	Think of the children.
7574345	7574645	That's right.
7574845	7575646	Think of the children.
7575866	7576426	All right.
7576907	7578428	It has been stricken from the list.
7578628	7580409	Porn to Me-verse is gone.
7581129	7581870	All right.
7582450	7582911	Who's next?
7582971	7583771	DarkSakura.
7584852	7586013	There's the various answers.
7586173	7588895	Which one of these is not worthy of the list?
7588915	7592257	Tough one.
7592637	7593718	There's a lot of good answers up here.
7594409	7597310	Yeah, there are.
7598090	7607932	I'm probably going to have to axe the Microsoft and Sony going back because I don't think Microsoft is going to.
7608052	7610393	You're eliminating it because you're just like, it's not happening.
7611473	7613293	And we still don't know what Sony's going to say.
7613593	7614574	You might want it to happen.
7614634	7615754	It's all speculation.
7615834	7616114	All right.
7616194	7617654	It has been stricken from the list.
7618274	7619835	As sad as that is going to make some of you.
7619875	7620495	But I understand.
7621195	7623137	Alright, my turn to strike something from the list.
7623858	7625659	Oh gosh, these are all actually really good.
7629383	7630003	I don't know.
7632706	7636669	I hate to do this, Loki, but I'm removing Super Mario RPG 2.
7637270	7642074	Before you get mad at me, people, it's the same reason DarkSakura got rid of hers.
7642515	7643696	It's not fucking happening.
7644116	7645798	So let's not even get our hopes up.
7647389	7650530	So Super Mario RPG 2, I'm sorry, but it has been removed from the list.
7650770	7656651	But the good news is GTA or Saints Row MMO gets immunity going into the final removal, which is yours, Loki.
7656891	7658411	Well, that's fantastic news.
7658591	7661392	And since it's not really going to happen either, new Mass Effect announcement.
7661492	7661652	Hey!
7661692	7664192	Because there's just not good writing in that series.
7665193	7668013	Hey, if they got the first game writing team, it would be good.
7668873	7672754	Oh, I'm sorry to say that it has been stricken from the list.
7673134	7674394	Sorry, Dark Sakura.
7674694	7677075	I guess while we're talking about things that will never happen...
7679833	7680695	Alright, there it is.
7680815	7685445	It is now your turn to vote for your number one and your number two answers.
7685465	7686427	Did EA pay you off?
7688680	7694082	But guys, no longer do you send your answers to me over private message.
7694182	7696962	Now there's a little button on the site that says your turn.
7697443	7699483	Select your first and second choices now.
7699503	7700683	It just popped up there in the corner.
7700964	7706325	And when you click answer, you will be able to answer right now and we will get the answers tabulated.
7706365	7712747	What you do first, you click on the answers and your first answer and your second answer and then you click the answer button.
7712947	7713787	Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
7714167	7716168	Run through that one more time, Bobby, because I'm a little slow.
7716707	7720229	So you'll click on one of my answers and you'll see it say one.
7720370	7722731	And then you'll click on one of my other answers and you'll see it say two.
7722771	7723652	And then you click answer.
7723672	7724172	All right.
7724212	7728335	So click on answer one and then answer two and then click answer.
7728895	7729075	All right.
7729095	7729936	What if they screw up?
7729996	7730937	Don't have five, right?
7731852	7761085	if the if but well once you click answer it's done like it's in but if you decided oh I didn't want that to be my number one you can click on it again and it takes it away oh okay good good to know all right there it is so um Bobby amazing work on the site I loved watching that all pop up as we were going and I bet you're breathing a sigh of relief seeing it actually work right yes awesome well I'll let you know if the votes come in here I'm wait oh there they go they're coming in oh nice oh it's even tabulates it for me Bobby I love it
7761530	7762753	You're welcome.
7762813	7763535	You the man, Bobby.
7764938	7765700	A coding god.
7765961	7770292	All right, well, Bobby, any other plugs like maybe for your show or something you want to get out here before I let you go?
7772030	7775233	No, E3.VOGnetwork.com Alright, sounds good.
7775453	7777735	Now how do I end this poll when it's done?
7777755	7779837	Do we just uncheck answerable?
7779917	7780578	Uncheck live.
7780818	7782139	Uncheck live and that gets rid of it.
7783020	7784681	I actually see a bug on this too.
7785201	7785602	Oh really?
7788504	7789045	What's happening?
7789265	7789985	Is the scoring wrong?
7790966	7792988	Well, you notice how it's
7794349	7794849	That's weird.
7795410	7796991	I know why it's doing it.
7797611	7798472	What's wrong, Bob?
7798572	7799412	Oh, it's not sorting it.
7799452	7800093	That's not a big deal.
7800373	7805316	Well, it is sorting it, but it's sorting it by the first number and not the entire number.
7806417	7806517	Oh.
7807197	7807538	I get it.
7807818	7809979	It's sorting it as a string instead of an integer.
7810059	7811040	That's coding terms.
7812660	7813781	Oh, I see what it's doing.
7813801	7814841	We can still count, though.
7814981	7816622	Yeah, I can count, Bobby, believe it or not.
7816982	7818063	All right.
7818083	7820444	Your last chance to vote, live.vognetwork.com.
7820504	7822725	Do I uncheck answerable as well or leave that?
7822765	7824526	No, because then you won't see the live answers.
7824566	7825226	Oh, that would be bad.
7825426	7825626	Okay.
7826146	7826987	You keep it answerable.
7827027	7827787	We uncheck live.
7827887	7828107	All right.
7828147	7828467	Sounds good.
7828487	7828668	All right.
7828688	7832269	We'll let you know the results shortly, but we want to give a few more moments for everybody to vote.
7832609	7834430	Once again, e3.vognetwork.com.
7834650	7837872	Thank you for playing listless with us tonight and kicking off the new generation of listless.
7838192	7838652	Appreciate it.
7839161	7840121	Thank you so much guys
7862848	7864549	Alright, we'll let you know the results here shortly.
7864669	7870454	Again, you can vote for about five more minutes at live.vognetwork.com in tonight's list list.
7871935	7872736	Let's go to the mailbag.
7873016	7876118	I guess now's a good time for us to... Do we gotta... Of course!
7876238	7876578	I know.
7876739	7877819	What, you don't like to hear from listeners?
7878880	7879180	Yes.
7880521	7884004	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send us emails.
7884044	7889448	DarkSakura's gonna dive in head first and find some emails that she thinks are worthy of reading on the show tonight.
7890809	7891309	First email.
7892711	7895173	It's also subject line is, now they've done it.
7896153	7899496	I looked up hubris the other day to make sure it meant what I thought it did.
7899636	7901937	Microsoft definitely has an overabundance of hubris.
7902778	7907061	They revealed Xbox One and the consumers on the internet made assumptions.
7907281	7911544	Then Microsoft denied the rumors, but last Thursday confirmed all the rumors to be true.
7912004	7913305	And the consumers are not happy.
7913405	7915887	See Major Nelson's blog comments to see the shitstorm.
7916647	7921650	The Xbox One seems to be defying the consumers who use the internet.
7922311	7924132	Oh wait, those are the target demographic.
7924692	7928735	It's really stupid business-wise to ignore your customer base and punish them in the process.
7928855	7929596	I hope they change.
7929956	7930917	And that comes from Robaba.
7932017	7932278	Agreed.
7933919	7934599	I'm going to apologize.
7934619	7935420	Can you summarize that for me?
7935440	7937221	Because Alan just got home and I was talking to him.
7937953	7941714	and basically Microsoft denying the rumors, then confirming the rumors and a big shitstorm.
7941954	7943054	Yeah, what's up with that?
7943154	7945055	They totally did, like, say no.
7945435	7950896	But then they were also saying, like, at one point, what, like, that it was going to be $60 for the license or something.
7951017	7954197	I don't... Sometimes the left hand isn't talking to the right hand, is it?
7954457	7956178	Well, and I'll repeat this line.
7956258	7960119	It's really stupid business-wise to ignore your customer base and punish them in the process.
7960922	7964063	I don't know why I don't sign up for porn No one signs up for porn, porn happens
7991078	7992999	Okay, this is another one from Rabababa.
7994000	7997222	You should probably avoid my other emails for reading out too late.
7997763	8002105	This is about the Xbox How It Games letter I slash we got via email.
8002566	8004307	Here is one quote feature.
8005067	8007109	Your games keep playing even when you're not.
8007509	8009870	Just because you're not playing doesn't mean your games have to stop.
8010250	8014252	With living games technology and the power of the cloud, game worlds are persistent.
8014733	8017154	So the things you do in a game will stay that way.
8017574	8023897	Wait, the living games continue to play without you like an MMO, which is the opposite of things you do in the game will stay that way.
8024297	8026058	We call that technology save files.
8028279	8028980	Thank you, Rababa.
8030000	8031321	Some good emails from Rababa tonight.
8031741	8032361	I like Rababa.
8032922	8033462	He's a good man.
8034142	8035463	Alright, that's it for emails tonight, huh?
8036283	8041826	I just came back into the chat room to see German Dungeon Transmidget Porn.
8042787	8044188	Do you guys know how to party or what?
8044748	8045608	I love the chat room.
8046589	8048750	Alright, last call for votes, guys.
8048770	8050211	Again, this is the last call for votes.
8050251	8055374	If you're participating with us, live.vognetwork.com The listless answers will be read after this.
8056475	8057255	The FUs of the week.
8057435	8058316	It's time to get angsty.
8058536	8058856	Why?
8059396	8061678	Cause E3's this week and none of us are going.
8062158	8063139	I get to go to the OUYA booth.
8064840	8068104	Ooh, lower your expectations, that's all I gotta say.
8080217	8083961	F you to me forgetting that I brought chocolate that's in the fridge and I'm gonna go get it now.
8085007	8088888	F you to just realizing that you're going to give me a bunch of chocolate.
8089489	8091429	Not that, like, I'm sad to have chocolate.
8091769	8092650	I waited for Alan.
8092870	8093830	Alan, chocolate.
8093910	8094290	All right.
8094330	8094630	Loki.
8100072	8108534	I have to do my laptop for the hard drive failing and then having, you know, these things that they put in place, like a recovery partition just not doing anything.
8108554	8113416	It got so bad that, like, Windows could read the hard drive because I was able to boot in the Windows and stuff.
8113836	8115616	But then it's like, oh, you want to fix that drive?
8115656	8117957	Well, I can't read that drive to fix it.
8118897	8119498	So that kind of sucked.
8119538	8121398	But at least I got a new hard drive in there.
8121678	8123939	That had to take out all of my JTAG, which I'm not using.
8124919	8126620	My Xbox of fame, unfortunately.
8126640	8126680	Um...
8128440	8145542	and then also F you to Steam actually just for this weekend because I was trying to I installed Steam on my new installation of Windows and it asked me hey I haven't played on this PC before you need to authenticate with us and then they wouldn't send me the email.
8146523	8148064	I'm like, what the hell?
8148344	8156767	It ended up being that their server was all fucked up this weekend, and so it was sending the email like two hours after you sent them the confirmation.
8157427	8160188	Normally it's like immediate, so whatever.
8161809	8162449	So I feel that.
8163409	8163729	All right.
8164370	8167691	My IP of the week, it goes to The Heat in Phoenix, Arizona.
8168431	8169512	I can only imagine.
8169572	8170273	Except for Grand Avenue.
8170293	8170473	Thank you.
8187592	8211786	Alice Cooper owns a bar there and I totally went there and it was amazing and I got to see his big unit or whatever that that that 22 no seriously it's like a 22 inch hot dog it was on man versus food or whatever I got to see somebody order that that was cool um otherwise F you to the fact like I can deal with 110 degree heat like I had to deal with that yesterday but at nine o'clock at night it cools off here in Arizona nope
8214969	8216131	So F you to the heat in Arizona.
8217613	8221478	And F you to the fact that I'm not really going to E3, but... Phoenix, right?
8221698	8223461	I mean, what's up with that?
8224102	8227166	Alright, I think it's time to read the results of this list.
8227186	8227807	What do you guys think?
8228227	8228427	Chocolate.
8228447	8228688	Chocolate.
8229127	8230248	That's right, I think chocolate too.
8230308	8230849	All right, here it is.
8231189	8236695	The results of tonight's list list at live.vognetwork.com.
8236755	8238677	If you didn't vote now, I'm sorry.
8239138	8239799	It is too late.
8241060	8244684	All right, so let's... Oh, son of a bitch.
8244784	8245405	It doesn't still show.
8245425	8246005	Oh, there's the table.
8246045	8246285	Phew.
8246306	8246466	Phew.
8246906	8248307	I was like, Bobby, I found a bug.
8248627	8249747	But it showed up again after a second.
8249787	8250688	Okay.
8250728	8251068	Here it is.
8251128	8252589	The answers for tonight's list list.
8253309	8254110	Number three.
8254510	8255050	And this is it.
8255510	8256351	This is what you want.
8256391	8257491	This is what will happen.
8258192	8259832	Well, what you really want to will happen.
8261730	8263151	Scientific Process, The End.
8263191	8264231	Number three answer.
8265352	8270394	The Microsoft server crashes for 24 hours and none of the games are playable after Wednesday.
8270595	8273916	Unfortunately, that's not possible because they're running off PCs anyway.
8274977	8275777	Stop being a realist.
8275857	8276137	All right.
8276558	8278499	Number two answer, Loki.
8279039	8279999	It should make you happy.
8280139	8282621	Grand Theft Auto or Saints Row MMO?
8282781	8283221	I wish.
8283441	8284482	Number two answer.
8285382	8292046	and the number one answer with over the number of points of number three and two combined.
8292106	8293967	I don't know if that's ever happened in Listless history.
8294467	8299970	The number one answer, Half-Life 3 released followed by a mic drop.
8300290	8301390	That would be fantastic.
8301670	8302831	You know everyone wants it.
8302871	8307712	I would love to see that in just like a really crappy just like stage that he has in like he built in his house.
8308012	8309412	He's just like not even a stage.
8309452	8311392	It's just like half.
8311592	8313093	I'm pushing a giant button.
8313293	8314073	Just have the button.
8314093	8317254	You know, he can lift up the button and the little case covering the button.
8317534	8320614	Hit the button and the little thing in the back says Half-Life 3 release.
8320814	8321734	Drops mic, leaves.
8322075	8322895	That's it.
8323055	8323555	Video done.
8324275	8324535	All right.
8324575	8325055	I love it.
8325536	8326196	It worked very well.
8326356	8328537	And, ooh, it even shows me how everybody voted.
8328877	8329518	Now I know.
8330238	8331159	Now we know who the traitors are.
8331179	8332159	Now I know who to judge.
8332179	8332399	All right.
8332419	8332879	I'm just kidding.
8333960	8335120	Did Loki vote for his own answer?
8335221	8335501	Let me see.
8335701	8336281	Yes, I did.
8336301	8338522	Of course.
8338742	8339903	You always vote for yourself.
8340723	8341003	All right.
8341644	8341984	There it is.
8342064	8343225	Again, just to recap.
8343585	8345886	Number three, the Microsoft server crashes for 24 hours.
8345966	8347867	Number two, Grand Theft Auto or Saints Row MMO.
8347907	8350728	Number one, Half-Life 3 released, followed by a mic drop.
8351509	8353110	Thank you and good night.
8354150	8356232	All right, and BlackWolf is celebrating in chat.
8356312	8357192	A winner is me.
8357773	8358834	I think he hacked the system.
8358874	8359474	Couldn't he have done that?
8359534	8361696	Couldn't he have hacked the system to give himself more points?
8361816	8362256	He may have.
8362757	8363077	He may have.
8363097	8363918	The game has been hacked.
8365178	8373745	All right, just a couple more news stories for you guys, and then we're going to get to the Twitter topics and our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8373785	8374606	But first, Loki.
8375186	8383631	So Minecraft is getting some updates on the portable version, or the pocket edition, including Alpha Realms support.
8383812	8390576	And if you remember correctly, Minecraft Realms is that new Mojang-run private servers, basically.
8391056	8391477	Cake?
8391697	8391837	Cake.
8391877	8391977	Cake.
8415572	8419714	So, I'm glad to see that the Android version is getting some updates.
8420015	8424817	I wish that, I know one of the things that they're working on, and I don't think it's happened yet, is controller support for that.
8425158	8429420	Because if that's the case, then I can sideload that onto my Ouya and play with the controller, and it'd be fantastic.
8430778	8432520	and oh, god damn it.
8432600	8433300	I knew there was something.
8433320	8436183	I forgot nephews of the week, but I'll mention it real quickly since we're talking about Minecraft.
8436423	8436843	What the hell?
8436883	8441828	The fucking VOG Network Minecraft server host is absolute shit.
8442268	8444270	And it's been down for five days now.
8444410	8447692	And I've sent a bunch of support tickets to them.
8448313	8449594	No fucking response back.
8449774	8450355	That's not cool.
8450435	8454959	But they sure as hell took out the money out of my account this weekend to pay for it.
8455399	8458862	So I'm looking... There's three magic words that will get...
8459202	8459442	Action.
8459482	8460083	Better Business Bureau.
8460103	8461044	Better Business Bureau.
8461584	8469110	So I'm going to be probably, I'm going to either switch the server to a new host or I'm just going to shut it down because no one's really playing on it.
8469130	8471152	You know, I tried to log into it this week.
8471792	8472373	Yeah, it's just.
8473013	8473674	I played last week.
8474714	8476076	But it's just not a lot of people on there.
8476196	8478938	So it's, you know, even though it's $10 a month, it's just, you know.
8479839	8480179	I'll give you $5.
8480959	8481440	That's all right.
8482160	8482601	No one plays.
8482621	8483722	It goes down.
8485203	8485443	All right.
8487088	8488049	Well, that doesn't mean no good.
8488069	8489510	Well, and they have announced...
8514076	8521417	They have announced that this game is inspired by, and this is why DarkSakura is excited, it's inspired by Konami's Parodius series.
8522478	8524878	Here's some gameplay, a little flying hamster.
8525398	8526418	Oh, that's awesome.
8526478	8529059	And if you want to play it, though, they do have flying hamsters.
8529079	8530599	The original game is on iOS.
8530999	8531359	Oh, nice.
8531379	8533139	So you can play that.
8534800	8536120	I like the little Egyptian penguin.
8536160	8536840	It's super cute.
8536880	8538740	I want to fight the owl.
8540301	8541261	So this is super cute.
8542262	8543023	It is cute.
8544404	8547165	And you gotta love somebody who says they're inspired by Parodius, right?
8547546	8549247	Parodius is like one of the best games ever.
8550327	8555411	Online leaderboards, unlockable trophies, and all that fun stuff on the PlayStation Network.
8555731	8558373	The game is also on the PlayStation Minis service.
8558393	8559133	Oh my god, Fat Mermaids.
8559674	8562856	The original Flying Hamster is on the Minis.
8562876	8563796	So that's pretty cool.
8563896	8564677	It has Fat Mermaids.
8565407	8573231	That's also a great little indie... You might not have noticed that otherwise title, so I'm really glad we're getting a little bit of a spotlight on that.
8573271	8573731	Very cool.
8574791	8576492	So DarkSakura's thinking about getting a Vita for that.
8576852	8577433	No, I'm not.
8578093	8579214	Just download it on your iPad.
8580174	8580454	All right.
8581415	8582695	I think it's about time to open up the Skype line.
8582715	8584136	Because, I'm sorry, nothing is Pentaro.
8585317	8586597	Let's open up the Skype line.
8586617	8590379	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8590439	8594061	It is time to get some calls here on this Sunday night.
8595322	8596943	We want to know, what are your E3 thoughts?
8597143	8599944	You don't have to give them in a haiku form, but bonus points if you do.
8601624	8603885	Maybe you have something to say about all this Xbox One business.
8604005	8610207	I'm sure some of our regular callers have an opinion or three or five or ten on what we talked about at the very beginning of the show.
8610307	8612068	Or maybe there's something else completely different we've missed.
8612668	8613508	We want to hear from you guys.
8613528	8617070	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8617630	8618050	And look at that.
8618570	8619390	It's already ringing.
8620411	8621711	Already got calls coming in tonight.
8621751	8622311	Let's go to it.
8622351	8623292	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8623312	8623672	Who's this?
8624508	8625768	I'd say sobered up Ranma.
8626389	8627469	I'm sorry to hear that.
8628489	8629629	How are you otherwise, Ranma?
8630470	8631390	I'm doing pretty good.
8631430	8633050	How about y'all out there in California?
8633170	8633510	Hot.
8634051	8636111	Actually, today was better.
8636151	8637352	I had chocolate, and I'm happy.
8637512	8638772	Yeah, I've calmed down a little bit.
8638812	8639312	Yesterday was 110.
8639832	8641313	Tomorrow's going to be 80.
8643433	8643813	Wow.
8643853	8644393	Go fig.
8644794	8645054	Yep.
8646234	8647234	Well, what's new with you, Ranma?
8647254	8648114	Why'd you call in tonight?
8648795	8652576	A couple of things, but before I get into it, hey, Ukchan.
8653356	8653776	Huh?
8654881	8657942	Looks like at Otakon this year we may be bringing Ranma 1.5 back.
8658502	8659062	Yay!
8659942	8663163	Yes, a few of us are doing like a quick impromptu group photo.
8663923	8664183	Hmm.
8664643	8666884	Well, send me a copy of it, definitely.
8666964	8668704	Too bad I can't come with my spatula.
8669784	8671605	Well, and if we have to, we'll pack you in a box.
8673045	8676646	I wish I could go, I really do, but unfortunately money, blah blah.
8678317	8679358	Okay, okay, okay.
8679838	8681299	This is a real reason why I called.
8682479	8692184	Number one, I understand what everyone says about the Xbox One, but truth be told, it's still going to sell because they're going to have these top-tier titles.
8692845	8698648	And you have to forget, half the gamers in the video gaming fandom are lemmings.
8698888	8704931	They will say one thing, and then after the presentation, you see all these games, it'll be like, shut up and take my money.
8706445	8709106	Couldn't you say the same thing about Nintendo's Wii U, though?
8709706	8712287	Yes, I could say that about every single gaming console.
8713327	8714627	But then what happens after that?
8715147	8718808	The Nintendo fanboys have bought the Wii U and they're still calling it a failure.
8719088	8725430	I still think the jury's out on that, given another holiday season before we build its coffin.
8725870	8729911	But I don't know.
8729951	8730712	Why do you think that is?
8735006	8737007	It's the way people think.
8737588	8742833	And I'm kind of reminded from back in the days of everybody was importing the DDR into Beatmania games.
8742853	8750940	Then when Konami started bringing over DDR and people got pissed that certain titles were not in the US releases, they were like, I'm not going to buy it.
8751200	8755324	The game comes out, they buy it anyway to support their fandom.
8755764	8760829	As for these next-gen consoles, one of the reasons why people are going to buy them is to support the console they think it's going to work.
8761670	8762511	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8780171	8780591	You don't?
8781451	8782151	I don't think so.
8782311	8784472	I don't think Blizzard or EA thought so either.
8784752	8785552	That's my worry.
8786172	8793434	Well, I don't know how many servers other manufacturers have, but I have this feeling Microsoft's going to have the most.
8793674	8797715	And they said straight up they're going to bring up all these servers ahead of time.
8797955	8801376	So I'm guessing some of the mistakes with EA and Blizzard we're doing with servers.
8801436	8802616	So who knows?
8803276	8806497	So where's your head at with Xbox One after all of this?
8808389	8812033	I said before, shut up and take my money for a PS4, but you know what?
8812113	8816458	I'm going to wait until after the presentations and see what everybody has to say and then make my decision.
8816758	8818841	Based off games are most important?
8820462	8820923	Not really.
8820943	8824627	It's like games, technology, functionality, a little bit of everything.
8825458	8828479	Let me ask you one more question, because I know you're a long-time listener of the show.
8828519	8830800	Were you here at the very beginning of the show, or did you come in late tonight?
8831361	8832581	I was here at the very beginning of the show.
8832661	8832861	Okay.
8833322	8845107	I wouldn't judge you if you were late, but I just want to know, earlier in the show I asked DarkSakura about the golden rule of gaming, and we kind of came to a consensus that perhaps the golden rule of gaming, a system that's only as good as the games that are on it, could be evolving.
8845847	8846368	What do you think?
8847348	8853814	I think so, too, because that golden rule is the reason why I got a 360 before the PS3.
8853834	8858338	Because people are going to argue, why did you get that next-gen console?
8859479	8861020	All these cool games are on that one.
8861300	8866364	And the answer is, well, those games are not games I would particularly like to play.
8866665	8869787	The games that I've played and I've enjoyed are on this console.
8869807	8873451	This console is going to offer these games I am interested in, which is why I'm going to buy it.
8875996	8876056	Hmm.
8876096	8876196	Hmm.
8892236	8902018	Well, I still remember when I was working at Staples, I looked outside the long line of people across the street at Circuit City for the $500 and $600 PlayStation 3.
8902058	8903458	That's true.
8903498	8906079	There'll be an audience somewhere, but will it be big enough?
8906159	8906839	That's the question.
8907499	8910459	Alright, Ranma, I gotta let you go to get more calls, but any other thoughts before I let you go?
8911840	8913440	Yeah, I'm sorry, but this is the thing.
8914000	8919121	I don't know if you heard, but GameStop had a special this week on Injustice Gods Among Men.
8920387	8921728	You mean Gods Among Us, but yes.
8922369	8922509	Yes.
8923069	8925431	$10, one hour sale only.
8925951	8929014	So many people flooded the site to try to buy it online.
8929194	8932776	What I found out about this, I went and I printed out the paper.
8933257	8943705	When I got out of class, I went down to Best Buy and I got them to price match a $60 game for $10 that happened about two and a half hours after the sale ended.
8943965	8944605	Nice work.
8947207	8948008	Did you enjoy the game?
8948601	8954445	Yes, it's one of the few games where I actually enjoyed it because I was playing it more for the story than anything else.
8955646	8962731	Asking for someone who does not believe in paying retail price for a game unless you can get it to knock down, I honestly say...
8963783	8967225	The game is worth $50 at least.
8967465	8968605	I can't see myself paying $59.
8969186	8971206	I see myself paying $49 or maybe $54.
8972127	8973668	But full retail, no.
8974008	8976489	It is a tricky line once you break that $50 barrier.
8976549	8977910	It's something psychological about it.
8978290	8980331	But we could do a whole other episode on that.
8980611	8982212	But I should let you go for now, Ranma.
8983112	8984553	Everybody listen to Anime Jam Session.
8985373	8985813	You got it.
8985933	8988594	We'll be talking about Denver Comic Con and Anime Next on Tuesday.
8988794	8989834	Wow, you guys got a busy show.
8989914	8990674	All right, have a good one, buddy.
8991134	8991374	You too.
8991754	8991914	Bye.
8992894	8993255	All right.
8994215	8994515	That's right.
8994775	9001136	Even though we've been talking a lot on this show about E3, there's lots of other nerd shows at the Voice of Geeks Network talking about other stuff.
9001156	9002196	So there's anime conventions going on.
9002216	9006097	I'm sure somebody's going to be talking about Apple stuff on Monday.
9006197	9010678	So stay tuned for that and all the great shows at the Voice of Geeks Network at vognetwork.com.
9012338	9014439	Let's go to the phones which are lighting up and take another call.
9014499	9015420	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9015440	9015760	Who's this?
9018241	9019621	This is YYR.
9020041	9021982	I just called to drop this rhyme.
9022202	9023482	Ha ha, I'm a troll.
9029645	9033846	We're going to have to have haiku call night at some point and everybody will have to do that.
9034346	9035547	Well played, my friend.
9035947	9036487	Well played.
9036547	9037808	I'm tipping my hat to you.
9037868	9038768	You just can't see it.
9040593	9042333	Because Rob's head is invisible and intangible.
9042353	9045534	Actually, that's really the only reason I called in.
9045714	9051795	Well, since I have a captive audience, how is Bungie Ferret Tossing going?
9052215	9052935	It's beer money.
9053456	9055456	Beer money is great because it buys beer.
9055776	9056496	That's right.
9057696	9060597	But I don't think you've seen the last of Bungie Ferret Tossing.
9062537	9065418	Deep in other projects right now, such as Ports 2,
9066795	9074038	The smartphones and tablets I like to complain about, but I think at some point I would love to revisit that universe, yes.
9074378	9076059	Wow, okay, very cool.
9077300	9082502	What do you think about the way, you know, there's been a lot of news about like Xbox One is kind of shafting indies or whatever.
9082622	9088925	I mean, as somebody who developed, you know, quite a bit, you did several games, not just Bungie Fair Tossing, but I know you had Snake 360 and Falling.
9089265	9090486	You know, you did a few games for the...
9092006	9094948	XNA, or Xbox Live Indie Games.
9095188	9096889	What do you think about all this news about Xbox One?
9098530	9108775	Well, I mean, as far as indie games in general, specifically, Microsoft already said they're not going to allow anyone to self-publish on one at first.
9110176	9117239	And I think that's a game changer, especially when Sony has come out and said, yes, if you want to self-publish, come to us.
9117800	9118300	PS4 will
9119182	9121925	will be happy to host your self-published game.
9122425	9130412	And, of course, Nintendo is welcoming self-publishing on Wii U as well to some degree.
9130452	9134535	I think you still need a business address to be a developer for a Nintendo platform.
9134636	9146666	But besides that, yeah, it seems that Microsoft is going to be the least indie-friendly next-gen console out of the gate.
9147583	9158927	So with that in mind, I think that, you know, depending on how much indie games influence the next console generation, that may not matter at all or it may matter a lot.
9159247	9165849	You know, it's all going to depend on how big of a blip on the radar indie games are over the next console gen.
9167590	9170291	Before I let you go... The rest of it, it's crazy.
9170511	9171571	It's absolutely crazy.
9173072	9173512	And I think...
9174469	9179210	All eyes are going to be on Sony at that after-conference presser.
9179710	9182711	You know, is PS4 going to be like this?
9182871	9183871	Is it going to be like that?
9183971	9185311	Is it going to allow us to do this?
9185451	9194873	And the answers given there are really going to make a big difference as far as how people perceive not just the Xbox One, but all of the new consoles, really.
9195133	9201755	Tomorrow, I mean literally tomorrow, what, 12 hours away is a huge day in gaming.
9202175	9202715	Huge.
9203175	9203935	One of the biggest ever.
9205815	9211037	I'll be on the edge of my seat, and I know probably all of us will be to some extent.
9212617	9212938	I don't know.
9212958	9214858	I'm going to take a nap.
9214898	9217599	Before I let you go, buddy, I always kind of like to ask this.
9217919	9220400	I know you just called in to give a haiku, and here we are with an interview.
9220440	9224261	But just outside of developing your own stuff, what games are you playing?
9224281	9225622	What are you enjoying playing lately?
9227217	9228898	I've been playing a lot of Tekken lately.
9229759	9233521	I actually bought the Wii U version just out of curiosity.
9234282	9241286	And I can say Tekken Ball, I don't know who remembers the Tekken Ball minigame in Tekken 3.
9241747	9242467	I love that game.
9242527	9243168	Totally do.
9244408	9251453	Yeah, they basically, you know, they updated it graphically and now you can actually select different balls to use.
9252194	9281326	and the difference is basically in how fast they move how quickly they charge up damage so it's a little bit more customizable than it was before and of course you can use tag teams which is for Tekken ball mostly useless but it's fun anyway so that is pretty much the major addition to the Tekken on Wii U the mushroom battle that everyone made such a big deal about and looks like so much fun in videos it's really not all it's cracked up to be
9282176	9300724	It's fun for like five minutes, but after the novelty wears off, because basically it's like the poison mushrooms that shrink you and the super mushrooms that grow you, the poison mushrooms also hurt you, and the damage is really high to begin with.
9301044	9305466	So it's like you get a couple mushrooms and already one more hit and you're dead.
9306167	9313758	So it's over way too quickly, and you can't play it online, and you can't use tag teams, and it's just, it's not that great.
9314619	9318845	And also, online, not too many people playing, for reasons that you could probably guess.
9319847	9321109	Other than that, it's the same game.
9323257	9331699	Well, I haven't played a lot of Tekken in a while, so maybe I should rent Tekken on Nintendo Wii U, since my Wii U will allow me to do that.
9332800	9335420	The actual last one that I bought was Tekken 4.
9335460	9336280	I am warning you, though.
9336320	9339181	Tekken has gotten extremely complex over the years.
9340081	9344403	The learning curve is as steep now as it ever was, or possibly steeper.
9345223	9349664	As long as you're okay with that, enjoy your rental that you can actually do.
9350676	9350957	All right.
9351217	9351558	Well, all right.
9351598	9351998	Take care, buddy.
9352018	9353660	I'm going to let you go to see if we can get one more call.
9353700	9357104	But enjoy all the E3 stuff this week, and we'll talk to you later.
9358186	9360328	Well, we'll either enjoy it or not enjoy it.
9360348	9360889	One of those.
9361270	9361810	That's true.
9361830	9362111	Take care.
9362171	9363072	Have fun.
9363252	9363492	All right.
9363512	9363933	You too.
9364233	9368539	Yeah, this is the first year where we can't necessarily say we're going to enjoy it, are we?
9369219	9372661	All right, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9372681	9374242	We got time for about one more call here.
9374922	9377483	Any last-minute stories while we're waiting for calls?
9377563	9377623	Yes.
9377643	9378544	And then we'll get to Twitter topics?
9378664	9379945	Yes, actually, I do have one.
9380165	9384627	It's a hack that was done for New Super Mario Bros.
9384827	9386108	on the Wii.
9386328	9387508	And it's just been released.
9387568	9390610	It's a total conversion for the game called Newer Super Mario Bros.,
9391891	9419231	120 all new levels remixed and original graphics to the game themes and music classic power-ups also new bosses and that kind of stuff and you can get it if you have a homebrew enabled Wii there's no piracy or hardware mods needed so I believe it's just a file like a save file that you put on there and you can download that at newerteam.com that's where you can find that hmm
9422179	9422539	Is that it?
9423300	9424580	I'm trying to pull up Twitter here.
9424860	9429743	I've been looking at the Xbox 720 checkpoint thing that came out last year.
9429763	9432104	Remember the whole leak about VR and stuff?
9432544	9435586	And a lot of it sounds exactly what they're talking about right now.
9435666	9436246	So who knows?
9436306	9439408	Next year maybe we might see some sort of Xbox glasses or something.
9440108	9447592	Because, I mean, straight up even to their slogan that makes no fucking sense.
9447752	9450333	Next generation entertainment, one box input one.
9454114	9455375	Why would you even do that?
9455395	9458817	I don't know.
9458897	9459257	All right.
9460358	9461058	Let's take another call.
9462139	9463200	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9463220	9463580	Who's this?
9466922	9468263	Hi, this is Raginator.
9468303	9469163	Hey, Raginator.
9469203	9471084	I was going to say I didn't see the cam come on at first.
9471144	9471485	There it is.
9471805	9472585	What's up, Raginator?
9474466	9476187	Just a quick question.
9476207	9477408	It's kind of a loaded one.
9479760	9484925	You kind of touched on something, albeit briefly, earlier during the show.
9485125	9493955	Rare has kind of hinted that they're working on something, and everyone's speculating that they're going to resuscitate an all-franchise.
9495096	9499521	Most people seem to think it's going to be either Conker or Killer Instinct.
9500181	9501603	What are your thoughts on that?
9503192	9510594	Um, well, we had a screenshot that was leaked, but I, you know, again, this is one of those anybody could have with a Photoshop.
9510854	9511815	Oh, did they prove it fake?
9512215	9512455	Yeah.
9513275	9514075	Proved it fake?
9514095	9516716	You're talking about the one that has... That had, like, Banjo-Kazooie and Halo 5.
9526852	9534080	And it's because that stuff that they got on there was either as wishful thinking and trademarks that they had already done.
9534361	9535502	It wasn't anything new.
9535742	9536303	It was fake.
9536383	9539587	So it's not going to be Banjo-Kazooie.
9539667	9542410	I don't think it would be Banjo-Kazooie anyways because it wouldn't be that big a deal.
9542430	9544152	It would be just kind of like, eh.
9544572	9568051	whatever because they had a new banjo game and it was just it was all right but I'm gonna go with the easy answer and say Killer Instinct based off the whole trademark dispute that they got settled um there wouldn't have been a reason to do that otherwise I don't think if they didn't want to keep that door open for some reason and I think they know that's what everybody wants and especially with where they're going with all this you know DRM debacle um
9568911	9597418	it's gonna take a franchise like that to make people you know what's it gonna take for you to sell your morals up the river essentially and it I mean honestly if Xbox could come out and say you know what we're gonna have we're gonna have Rob's fantasy games Mass Effect 4 the Guardian Legend 2 you know and the things I want to see it's gonna be hard for me to even go god I fucking hate what they're doing but I really really really want these games it's gonna be hard it's easy for me to sit here now and go
9597958	9599158	I don't need Halo 5.
9600179	9602219	I don't need a new Killer Instinct.
9602900	9607801	I don't need some of this other stuff they're talking about because I can kind of be satisfied with PlayStation 4.
9608401	9610382	Well, and technically, we don't need any of it.
9610482	9611682	We need air and water.
9612822	9614923	No, I need Guardian Legend 2, Jamie.
9615103	9615503	I need it.
9615863	9616143	Rob.
9616344	9616764	I need it.
9616964	9617204	Rob.
9617284	9617704	I need it!
9618264	9618784	Intervention!
9619484	9620165	What about you, Jamie?
9621145	9621385	What?
9621925	9622685	Rare franchise.
9623226	9623806	It's coming back.
9624626	9625386	Killer Instinct.
9626327	9627167	How about you, Ragenator?
9629362	9655735	Well, I would love to see another Killian State God only knows I played the Jesus out of the SNES port along with the N64 game but I'm a little concerned because now history has shown that both first priorities and third priorities tend to really
9656997	9673065	Goverbard screw with a proven formula, and when they screw with a given formula that's proven to be a winner, a lot of people tend to revolt.
9673785	9678228	Cases at point, Capcom is screwed with
9679836	9683998	You know, they had a final fight with Streetwise for PS2.
9684078	9688000	Turned a 2D brawler into a 3D brawler.
9688040	9689321	They didn't do too well.
9691547	9692648	Street Fighter EX3 was pretty good.
9716481	9723225	I want to say with Capcom too, since you brought up Mega Man, I think there's a very strong possibility Mega Man fans will finally have something to celebrate this week.
9723666	9731591	I don't know if that'll just be a little victory or something, but I just think the timing is right for Capcom to unveil what they're going to do with Mega Man.
9732051	9732731	I would love to see it.
9732911	9734272	Just don't screw it up.
9734292	9735712	Make minor tweaks here and there.
9735732	9735952	Maybe
9761753	9769812	and new characters, maybe a mechanic here or there, but don't go radically changing the game to the point where
9771144	9774145	It's basically a totally different game.
9774806	9777967	It's only related to previous games by name only.
9777987	9780568	I'm not going to say it the other way.
9795294	9797696	I asked because I just wanted to type Uranus.
9798056	9798936	Well, there you go.
9799156	9800677	And now I read it there on air.
9800777	9801878	So congratulations.
9801898	9807582	And if I remember right, it would be three warps to Neptune and then three more to Uranus.
9808837	9809057	Yeah.
9809417	9811438	Six warps to Uranus, Ragenator.
9812118	9814399	Yeah, I know it's corny.
9814819	9816179	I came up with something.
9816319	9817720	It's all right.
9817860	9819920	So is the show, Ragenator.
9819940	9820401	So is the show.
9820681	9821521	All right, have a good one, buddy.
9821681	9822081	Have a good E3.
9822101	9822941	All right, have a good one.
9823121	9823842	All right, bye.
9825522	9829883	I feel like that's like wishing people a Merry Christmas or Happy Hanukkah.
9829943	9834645	I feel like you should wish video gamers a happy E3, even when E3 is going to be bad news.
9835425	9836206	DarkSakura, you're our linguist.
9836226	9837647	What should the greeting be to other gamers?
9859684	9865499	Blessed E3 That might be a little too much Blessed E3 How about Blessed E3
9866912	9867893	How about WankFreeE3?
9867913	9872578	All right, maybe I'll throw that question to the chatters and see what they come up with.
9872878	9874660	But for now, I am going to close the Skype line.
9874680	9881907	If you do have further thoughts on any of tonight's topics, mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com or Twitter.com slash OLR.
9881927	9885951	So a screenshot leaked from a brand new unannounced game.
9886652	9886772	Oh.
9888093	9890556	Well, we kind of assumed it was coming.
9891376	9893177	Just Dance, the new Just Dance game.
9893577	9897519	It's gonna have the Ghostbusters theme in it because they have a screenshot where people are dressed up like Ghostbusters.
9899199	9900980	That's in Just Dance 4, isn't it?
9902020	9902660	You sure about that?
9906942	9908463	Rob is up going to look, by the way.
9912804	9917226	Now in the chat room, by the way, we have a call for a new Rival Schools series.
9917326	9918146	Okay, what are you looking at?
9919327	9919827	Just Dance 4?
9921601	9922161	He's reading.
9922942	9924823	It's going to take us a while because Rob's reading.
9925383	9925923	Just kidding.
9929865	9932006	Sorry, YYR, I can't click YouTube.
9932206	9932786	Maybe not.
9932927	9934067	I thought it was in this.
9934167	9937649	No, it's official because it's actually on Xbox's website.
9937769	9945132	So if you go to Xbox's Just Dance 2014 and they've got... Well, I mean, what a duh they're going to do a new Just Dance game.
9945152	9945713	I mean, come on.
9945753	9948114	These games sell like crazy and it's not a bad game.
9949813	9950274	DarkSakura.com
9961192	9961772	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9981145	9985128	Tiger Claw talking about Mad Catz readying an Android console of their own.
9985448	9987089	Is this like an Ouya type response?
9987109	9987709	No, we are, yeah.
9988450	9989750	It's not like the Ouya.
9990931	9993333	Actually, I like the idea a lot better than the Ouya.
9993893	9997315	It's basically going to be a console that plays Android games.
9997515	10003619	It has the Google Play Store, and it plays any Android game, and you can actually map buttons onto stuff.
10004219	10027997	so games that don't support touch or whatever you can use a mouse with them or do support touch you can use a mouse or you can use analog sticks to emulate touch but the fact that it doesn't require any special games it's just the games that you have or the games that you buy for like a dollar or free or whatever so I like that and their controller looks nice too it looks like an Xbox 360 controller
10028437	10035940	Actually, it looks exactly like their Xbox 360 controller, their MLG controller.
10036320	10037280	It looks exactly like that.
10038361	10043122	And one other tweet from Tigerclaw tonight about Interplay getting an IP from THQ for $7,500.
10045843	10048065	That's how much they paid for Free Space.
10048966	10049686	That's a good deal.
10049746	10050787	That's a great deal.
10051688	10055792	Interstellar Combat Series that was developed by Volition and published by Interplay.
10055872	10060415	It's back in Interplay's library after getting it back from THQ.
10060596	10061977	So there you go.
10062958	10067642	Interplay, by the way, it should be noted, they never did lose the rights to sell Descent Free Space and Free Space 2.
10068222	10069223	So there you go.
10069483	10076077	I want another Descent that is awesome that required more buttons than the other Descent games.
10076919	10077541	That would be awesome.
10077561	10079405	That required telekinesis to play.
10080083	10083805	All right, well, thank you guys very much for your tweets at twitter.com slash OLR.
10084165	10086947	Lots of great stuff tonight, but it's about that time.
10086967	10090929	We've got to wrap up the show and get everybody's final thought and all that.
10091069	10092410	We have a consensus in the chat room.
10092450	10092791	What's that?
10092991	10094031	Rival Schools is awesome.
10094371	10095552	Rival Schools is awesome.
10095892	10097153	You should have put that on your list list.
10097193	10097553	Too late.
10097934	10100055	Well, okay, you know what?
10102654	10109798	I actually, when I had a lot more disposable income, I paid 99 bucks to import the Justice Gakuen Evolution.
10110658	10112959	And I played the hell out of it for days.
10113059	10119843	But it's like, every time they would bring out, like one of the games for home, they'd take out something from the Japanese version that made it awesome.
10120283	10123145	Like the board game mode in Project Justice.
10124606	10131293	After you played through the board game, your custom character that you played the board game with would have stats based on how you played the game.
10132194	10133716	And they just took that out.
10135293	10142376	Well, guys, before I let you go tonight, I just want to say happy three, and let's hope the news isn't too terrible.
10142416	10145557	Let's hope there's a lot of good surprises and things that we will be excited about.
10146518	10150219	I will be here during the day tomorrow during the press conferences, and I'll be around Tuesday, too.
10150339	10151760	I will make a point to be in chat.
10152140	10156802	If you want some folks to talk about the conferences, you want a live blog post,
10157162	10162483	It's not really live blogging because I kind of think everybody's kind of watching it, but more like live discussion.
10162903	10168704	If you want to talk about what's going on at E3 with some like-minded individuals, I urge you to be at live.vognetwork.com.
10169084	10172905	I'll be there during the big preface conferences tomorrow, and we can talk about it.
10173545	10174545	I'll be there as well.
10175006	10175786	Are you going to be there too?
10175986	10179606	Yes, because my boss is gone, so I don't have to really work there.
10180147	10181667	It's all work-related anyways.
10181707	10182047	Come on.
10182327	10188992	I'll be there at least for Microsoft and Sony but in the middle of the day DarkSakura and I might go on a friend date to take care of some stuff around town.
10189072	10190053	YYR left another haiku.
10190253	10190534	Oh yeah?
10190774	10191815	Happy E3 guys.
10191855	10193816	Look forward to no prices and no dates either.
10194817	10195758	I think we'll get those tomorrow.
10196498	10197879	I think we'll get prices and dates tomorrow.
10198020	10198360	I don't know.
10199040	10199301	Hmm.
10199881	10204385	It would be a first if we did because remember what was the infamous thing a few years ago from Sony?
10204405	10205666	$599 US dollars.
10206166	10205666	$599.
10206406	10207867	So I think we will get it.
10207887	10209268	I'll try to wake up tomorrow.
10209288	10209509	Alright.
10209529	10209709	Alright.
10210209	10211450	to care about the press releases.
10211470	10212431	To get in chat as well.
10212611	10212711	Maybe.
10212791	10213572	So there you go.
10213612	10215574	I've already got my popcorn.
10215794	10218056	It's just stale, but I already have my popcorn.
10218076	10219357	I want to go to Popcornopolis.
10219677	10219917	All right.
10220197	10230726	So yeah, if you want a place to just chat with some other folks and kind of just get some live banter going on what's going on at E3, join us in chat, live.vognetwork.com.
10230746	10231107	You never know.
10231147	10234429	Bobby might hop in on a plane for all we know from his plane.
10234910	10235350	We'll see.
10235690	10235991	We'll see.
10237451	10259138	Check out E3.VOGnetwork.com I'm really excited about what this week is going to bring and it's going to be a great week I guess that's it We'll be back next week to do it all over again as we lead up to our 11th anniversary on June 23rd It's time to go around and get everybody's final thought DarkSakura, we'll start with you tonight, your final thought I wish I hadn't eaten all that chocolate so quickly
10260740	10263321	And my final thought tonight is no regrets.
10263481	10265361	I did eat it that quickly, and it was good.
10266042	10267162	Loki, your final thought tonight.
10267302	10268322	I'm looking forward to this week.
10268362	10270703	I think I'm always excited about E3 stuff.
10270743	10272103	Just disappointed I don't get to play it.
10272343	10276304	And also, I'm not going to be able to make it out to Best Buy on Wednesday to play the Wii U games.
10276324	10277325	Because it's at a weird time.
10277345	10278325	It's like at 4 o'clock.
10278605	10280846	Like, if it was in the middle of the day, I could sneak out and do that.
10280866	10284867	But the middle of the day one's on Saturday, and I'm not going to drive all the way to Elk Grove.
