14000	20000	Tonight, June 30th, 2013, Microsoft reportedly drops Xbox Live patching fees,

28000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
36000	38000	where every gamer has a voice.
38000	45000	It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 510, June the 30th of 2013.
45000	49000	My name is Rob Roberts and I am here to talk with you guys about video games
49000	53000	and gaming culture and gaming LOLs and gaming WTFs
53000	58000	with my co-host joining me as she has faithfully for the past 11 years.
58000	61000	Say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
61000	64000	Are you still sick 11 years later?
64000	68000	Hey, you know what, it's funny, my voice is getting a little bit better,
68000	70000	but I still have the cough, so.
70000	71000	Aww.
71000	72000	Ricola!
72000	75000	I'm living on a steady diet of Ricola, but you know what?
75000	77000	I've gone down a size.
77000	78000	Congratulations, I guess.
78000	80000	Thanks to my diet of Ricola.
80000	82000	That's not really the way you're supposed to do it, but you-
82000	83000	Well, that and fruit.
83000	84000	You look for the silver lining.
84000	86000	What are you, an Animal Crossing villager?
86000	87000	Yes, I live on pears.
87000	88000	Alright.
88000	89000	Pears and rainbow trout.
89000	93000	Also say hello to a man that lives on round table breadsticks.
93000	94000	Say hello to Loki.
94000	95000	Just today.
95000	96000	Just today.
96000	97000	How are you doing, Loki?
97000	98000	I'm doing alright.
98000	100000	So, for those that-
100000	101000	Loki has a bubonic plague.
101000	105000	Yeah, it's a good thing it's not a video show because if you guys could see Loki,
105000	108000	he's got like chicken pox on his hands or something.
108000	109000	Yeah, it's not really chicken pox.
109000	111000	I mean, I don't know what chicken pox looks like because I've never had it,
111000	117000	but it's an extreme- well, it's not extremely rare, but it's rare.
117000	119000	It's hand, foot, and mouth disease.
119000	121000	Usually something that, you know-
121000	123000	Is that where you keep putting your foot in your mouth?
123000	125000	Because you do that a lot on this show.
125000	126000	No, no.
126000	130000	Hand, foot, and mouth disease is like this virus that you get that starts off with a fever.
130000	134000	So, I had like 102 fever for like a whole 24 hour period.
134000	137000	That would not go down no matter what kind of medication I took.
137000	144000	And then you break out in a rash on your hands, your feet, and usually your mouth.
144000	146000	It could be- like, for me, it was on my face.
146000	149000	Not so much in my mouth, thank goodness.
149000	151000	A little bit at the back of my throat.
151000	158000	And then like one tip of my tongue, which I always get like a weird thing from like acidic food sometimes.
158000	159000	Gross.
159000	162000	But yeah, basically they act like blisters.
162000	166000	So, my hands look like they're all spotted in red and there's some that actually look like blisters.
166000	169000	And they were hurting quite a bit more earlier in the week.
169000	172000	Like, I couldn't really pick up things without hurting, you know.
172000	175000	But actually today's not bad. I don't feel anything.
175000	176000	So, you're getting better.
176000	177000	I'm getting better, yes.
177000	178000	Please don't be contagious.
178000	180000	No, I shouldn't be contagious.
180000	184000	The listers do not want to catch foot and mouth disease or whatever it is you have.
184000	185000	No, it's only contagious.
185000	190000	Like, it's mainly like, you know, if you're dealing with your children or something like that.
190000	194000	You can catch it from, you know, changing their diapers or something like that.
194000	196000	You can catch it from food.
196000	198000	She had baby butt disease.
198000	200000	If you share, like, I was sharing food.
200000	203000	Like, see, you probably wouldn't catch it if you ate some of this stuff.
203000	208000	Because, like, I was actually eating the same fork and, you know.
208000	209000	I wouldn't touch those breadsticks.
209000	211000	In fact, that whole area is getting Lysol'd as soon as you leave.
211000	212000	That's fine.
212000	216000	I wouldn't expect you to do anything different any other day.
216000	218000	We could set up a quarantine.
218000	220000	I think we've got some canvas somewhere.
220000	223000	Should we drape a plastic sheet over Loki?
223000	225000	God, no, it'll be even hotter than it is.
225000	226000	You'll be the Loki in the plastic bubble.
226000	229000	No, but other than that, you know, I've been just staying at home.
229000	235000	Just doing a lot of watching of instructional videos for, you know, Unity stuff.
235000	237000	Your programming stuff is moving on.
237000	241000	Yeah, I finished, well, I don't know if you'd call it finished.
241000	245000	I finished slash quit my C++ thing because I was just like,
245000	249000	listen, I don't really care about all this stuff that they're talking about.
250000	253000	When you work with Unity and stuff, it doesn't really apply.
253000	257000	Like, you know, some of the very low-level things they're teaching you in C++.
257000	259000	And sure, I'll go back to it someday.
259000	263000	But for right now, I just wanted a basic understanding of programming languages.
263000	264000	And that's what I got.
264000	269000	And now when they're showing Unity stuff, I can understand what they're doing.
269000	272000	I'm not like, what? What's he mean by that?
273000	275000	Well, I look forward to seeing whatever project,
275000	277000	especially the one you were telling me about before the show.
277000	278000	Sounds very ambitious.
279000	281000	It's like an OLR dream game in the future.
281000	283000	It's Peter Molyneaux crap.
284000	287000	Can you imagine if Peter Molyneaux had Loki's ideas?
287000	291000	Because this is where we're headed now, is that Loki's learning programming.
291000	294000	Loki's going to come up with these games. It's going to be crazy.
294000	296000	So, a couple quick things and then we'll get to our guests.
296000	298000	Because you have a guest here in the studio.
298000	302000	First off, I know much of the country is under a heatwave right now.
302000	306000	But it is hotter than Satan's taint here in Sacramento right now.
306000	309000	And just as sweaty. It's humid.
309000	313000	And we bitch here in Sacramento about the humidity when it's above zero.
313000	314000	This is not humid.
314000	316000	No, I know. It's not East Coast humid. I know that.
316000	318000	But it's bad for West Coast. It's bad.
320000	321000	That was one thing I was going to say.
321000	323000	And then I think I was going to say something gaming related.
323000	326000	But I forgot because I was thinking about how fucking hot it was.
326000	331000	So, I guess with that, speaking of Satan's taint, let's go introduce our guest.
331000	332000	No, I'm kidding.
332000	336000	Say hello everybody. Joining us live in studio tonight.
336000	339000	A good friend of mine. We go way back years and years.
339000	341000	And he hosts another show that you all should be listening to.
341000	345000	It's First Mate Slidekick from the GameBui.org podcast.
345000	346000	Ahoy.
346000	347000	How you doing?
347000	351000	Pretty well aside from the roasting like a chicken part.
351000	353000	Like a pig at a luau.
353000	355000	Yeah, it's pretty bad here in Sacramento right now.
355000	359000	You're visiting us for the weekend from where do you live usually?
359000	360000	The Bay Area.
360000	361000	Yeah.
361000	364000	Just the big nebula of the Bay.
364000	365000	Yes.
365000	367000	Awesome. Well, welcome.
367000	373000	So, Spike, your co-host at GameBui.org was here about, I think it was about, actually it was about two months ago at this point.
373000	374000	Yeah.
374000	378000	So, assuming we picked up any new listeners between now and then, tell us a little bit about GameBui.org.
378000	379000	What's your show all about?
379000	384000	Well, we're your port of call for gaming news and views that maybe aren't on your radar, but definitely should be.
384000	392000	What we kind of focus on are left of center news and genres that you might not hear on your typical gaming podcast.
392000	394000	So, we talk about JRPGs a lot.
394000	400000	We talk about different issues in gaming like gay issues and that sort of thing.
400000	404000	So, you try to talk about stuff before it's cool.
404000	406000	So, it's like a hipster podcast.
406000	418000	Not really, but we think it's important for people who are interested in this type of content and these sorts of games to have a place to go to hear the news.
418000	428000	Because we find all this stuff on all the big news sites, but with all the big news that happens, it sometimes gets lost.
428000	429000	Yeah, sure.
429000	432000	All this fuckery about the Xbox One.
432000	441000	That whole talk dominated E3 and I'm sure there's lots of great, and I use my quotey fingers, Kensha Hall games in memory of the hall that used to be there.
441000	452000	They kind of fall off the radar because everybody's too preoccupied with all this crap about Xbox versus Sony and Nintendo out of left field and all that.
452000	462000	Right, yeah. I mean, we talk about Xbox One and some of the bigger stuff too, but we just try to keep our fingers on the pulse of the stuff that you might not hear a lot about.
462000	464000	So, hopefully we can succeed with that.
464000	466000	And where can folks hear your show?
466000	475000	We're over at gamebuoy.org and you can get all of our episodes there and also links to all our social networks.
475000	480000	So, hopefully some of you OLR peeps will come and listen to us and say hi.
480000	484000	So, it's like Game Boy, but you have a U before the L, like a buoy.
484000	485000	A buoy, like a boat buoy.
485000	488000	Hence why you're pirates and first mates and all that.
488000	489000	We're pirates, yeah.
489000	492000	Sorry, the listeners are complaining that you're too quiet.
492000	494000	Wow, that's a first.
494000	496000	I know. Actually, no.
496000	500000	Well, especially since back when we were raiding, I'd have to turn you way down.
500000	501000	That's true.
501000	505000	And then I'd have to turn Rob even further down because Rob would be like,
505000	510000	Okay, everybody on the main tank, move. Tank, move.
510000	515000	I like to yell at people when I play, wow, I can't help it.
515000	517000	It's just the way I am.
517000	523000	So, you got some fans in the chatty room over at live.volganetwork.com because this show,
523000	528000	you know, the one that does all the mainstream stuff here where every gamer has a voice.
528000	531000	We read along with you guys in the chat room. You guys can participate.
531000	536000	Live.vognetwork.com, Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern,
536000	538000	right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
538000	541000	Although, sadly, he was not live tonight due to a last-minute technical glitch.
541000	546000	Those things happen, but poor Bobby's had a string of bad luck lately with the lightning and everything else.
546000	549000	So, our thoughts go out to him for like a good week.
549000	552000	Somebody needs to take Bobby Black Wolf on a cruise, y'all.
552000	554000	Somebody needs to put him on a cruise.
554000	556000	You know, he likes cruises. He's a cruiser guy.
557000	559000	That's not good luck at all. Come on.
559000	562000	Oh, yeah. With everything that happened with the carnival and everything.
562000	564000	Stay away from cruises.
564000	566000	He'll end up on the poop cruise. We don't want that.
566000	568000	Somebody needs to get him on a good cruise.
568000	573000	No, we just need to win the lottery, go to Georgia, and give him a big hug.
573000	575000	Alright. Let's see.
575000	578000	Going into our chat room at live.vognetwork.com,
578000	581000	Osfer says, I've been recently listening to Game Buoy. Happy face.
581000	582000	Aw, thanks, Osfer.
582000	586000	And Clerical Error 404 says, Game Buoy is great.
586000	588000	Aw, lots of love. Thank you.
588000	593000	He has to say that, though, because we're doing the stuff with Koopa Club and Game Bar and Gamer X.
593000	600000	No, I'm kidding. What a great bunch of guys all around the internet doing those podcasts. Good stuff.
600000	603000	Clerical Error 404 also suggests a cruise to Alaska.
603000	604000	Hi.
604000	609000	And Code Man says, I love Bobby. We all love Bobby here at the Voice Geese Network.
609000	612000	That's why we get pissed when all this bad shit keeps happening to him.
612000	615000	How about an open letter to bad shit?
615000	616000	Knock it off.
616000	618000	Stop it. Not love, O-L-R.
618000	619000	Yeah.
619000	627000	I thought of the other announcement I wanted to make real quick, and then I'll get back to John, or excuse me, First Mate Slidekick.
627000	628000	Ooh, I just said your real name.
628000	629000	Ooh.
629000	631000	And then we'll move on with the show.
631000	636000	Last week, some of y'all were listening live, and we were having some really bad cutout problems.
636000	639000	The stream kept dropping every 15 seconds.
639000	645000	Now, originally we blamed that on our service provider, but the blame may have been misplaced.
645000	651000	It turns out it was a router that we were using here in the house, which sucks because we just replaced a router a year ago.
651000	653000	But now the other one died.
653000	658000	We have a bridge router that we use in the living room here that moves it from the studio.
658000	661000	So now the show is plugged in directly into the studio router.
661000	663000	I'll try to save you the full networking spiel.
664000	667000	But the last half of last week's show streamed fine.
667000	670000	So I'm sorry to the live audience that was getting really frustrated last week.
670000	672000	Hopefully that will be the end of it.
672000	677000	If anything screws up now, it's this 108 degree weather fuckery's fault.
677000	679000	No, it's Comcast. It's always Comcast.
679000	681000	It's always Comcast, exactly.
681000	688000	You know, anytime there's extreme weather changes, Comcast has a big fart, and the sticky bits get left on the customer.
688000	690000	Ew.
690000	693000	Exactly. That's what everybody says when it happens. It's horrible.
693000	698000	Anyhow, back to First Mate Slidekicks, since I'm supposed to be talking to you.
698000	701000	What are some of the topics you've talked about on Game Buoy lately?
701000	710000	One thing I kind of like about your show is that since you do a central topic, you pick a lot of stuff that's not necessarily tied into the news.
710000	714000	Like your April Fool's show was all about tingle, right?
714000	716000	Yes, it was our tinglecast.
716000	723000	And you did another show about, I know you did an LGBT show. What was your most recent one?
723000	731000	The most recent one we did was, like the recent full episode was our E3 Blowout, which is a yearly theme now, second year.
731000	738000	Actually, a new thing that we've done on the site is introduce Game Buoy Micro, which are little tiny podcasts.
738000	743000	And by tiny, I mean like a half hour because our podcasts tend to run longer these days.
743000	746000	Hey, boy, you know you're on a three hour show tonight, right?
746000	750000	Maybe that's why we're getting so long on Game Buoy. We were just trying to be like, O-L-R.
750000	755000	Oh, stop. Well, you guys are always really supportive of the other indie shows, and I think that's great.
755000	759000	That's something I've always really tried to champion is that, you know, support each other.
759000	763000	Don't cut each other down because nobody wins in that situation.
763000	768000	So you guys are always really great about pimping stuff at the end of your show.
768000	771000	Since you did, I know one of the Micros you did because I actually listened to it.
771000	775000	You guys went and saw the Best Buy Nintendo E3 Blowout.
775000	777000	Yeah, we actually took some YouTube video as well.
777000	781000	How was that? Not to steal the thunder of your show, but give us the Cliff Notes version. How was it?
781000	786000	You know, it was kind of cool. You know, I feel like any time you go to a Nintendo event,
786000	791000	whether it's just camping out for a Wii or, you know, going to something like this,
791000	794000	that Nintendo crowds are usually pretty cool.
794000	799000	It was a really long wait, but to Nintendo's credit, they didn't cut it off right at, like, six or whatever.
799000	801000	How long was long?
801000	806000	We were in line for about five and a half hours. You know, we got to play one game, but I mean, for me it was worth it.
806000	808000	Just like the real E3.
808000	810000	Yeah, pretty much. Authentic experience.
810000	816000	That's what they were actually saying. The Nintendo representatives there were saying it's an authentic E3 experience,
816000	821000	but they give us pizza. P-I-Z-Z-A.
821000	824000	Did they give you whipped cream pouring like waterfalls?
824000	827000	No, they didn't. Unfortunately.
827000	829000	Cheap, cheap bastards.
829000	835000	But yeah, I thought it was really cool that they put it on and that they were so cooperative in that.
835000	838000	Best Buy, to their credit, was really cooperative, too.
838000	842000	They could have just been like, nope, it's five. Everyone who hasn't played yet doesn't get to play,
842000	850000	but they tried to get everyone to play what they wanted and they had little Mario Kart 8 flags to give you
850000	852000	just for waiting in lines. I mean, it was really cool.
852000	857000	I still think the best way, you know, approach to E3 was like Xbox.
857000	866000	Oh my god, Xbox. Yeah, 2005 or 2006, when they did that, were bringing E3 home and they had demos for games.
866000	870000	Same demos that were out there. I'm like, why don't they do that?
870000	875000	I don't understand why they can't do that now. I mean, I know a lot of that doesn't run on final hardware and stuff.
875000	882000	I think the reason why they don't is there's too many people that make their final judgement of the game based off the E3 demo
882000	886000	and it's too risky in that regard. I honestly think that's a big part of it.
886000	892000	Like, you know, E3 builds are usually really early on in the development and there's too many people that make their decision like,
892000	896000	oh, this game sucks based off the demo. Like, you know, demos carry a lot of weight.
896000	902000	Yeah, but these people, though, are the same dumb people that will buy a game based off of a review score from one outlet.
902000	907000	So, I mean, they're very fickle anyways, so I don't know why we should punish every-
907000	911000	Considering that, you know, it's gonna get a good review and they're like, well, I guess I'll buy it.
911000	915000	Oh, okay. You know, cause, you know, YGIN liked it or something.
915000	921000	Um, quickly, also about the Nintendo experience. What did you play? You got your hands on with, you didn't-
921000	923000	Spike did Mario Kart 8, you did the Mario-
923000	925000	I did Mario 3D World, yeah.
925000	928000	The Mario 3D fused with Super Mario 2 game.
929000	932000	Yeah, cats. Super Mario cats, that's why you need to know.
932000	943000	Super Mario cats, yeah. It was cool, I mean, it was kind of chaotic and I've actually, I think it was over on US Gamer, which is Jeremy Parrish's new outlet.
943000	950000	They were describing it as chaotic too, but I mean, like in a good way, so it was fun, you know.
950000	954000	Mario Party's chaotic if you play with me. Mario Party's always chaotic.
954000	956000	Everything is chaotic if they play with you, Rob.
956000	957000	Shut up!
957000	962000	Hey, I've been here 11 years, I have the right to say whatever I want to, so nah.
963000	964000	But did you have fun?
964000	965000	I did, I did.
966000	970000	Did you make your judgment on the entire game based off that demo?
970000	977000	You know, I mean, I kind of made my judgment on that game based on the Nintendo Direct, honestly, so, I mean-
977000	980000	You're like, it's Mario and Princess Floats, I'm in.
980000	989000	Pretty much, you know, I'm a shameless Nintendo fanboy, but you know, it was good to get a chance to play it and to be able to speak to that.
989000	997000	And you know, just being able to see the games that I didn't play, like watching Captain Spike play Mario Kart 8 and Wind Waker HD.
997000	1002000	Towards the end, people were starting to just get really, like, annoyed when people were like,
1002000	1009000	Oh, I want to play Wind Waker HD, because it's actually, what they did is they redid the original GameCube demo.
1009000	1015000	So you could either do the bird battle, boss battle, or run around Windfall Village.
1015000	1025000	And, you know, which is cool, but I mean, compared to doing two races on Mario Kart or two levels in 3D World, you know, it was just a little too long.
1025000	1034000	So, it looked gorgeous though, and Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze looked good, so, you know, it was cool to actually get a chance to see it.
1034000	1037000	You know, not just based on an E3 video, so.
1037000	1040000	Okay. It was worth it.
1040000	1044000	Going to the chat room for some comments at live.vognetwork.com.
1044000	1051000	Shadownextgen says, Gamers rush to decisions. A lot of them don't understand the concept of an alpha or beta build that will be buggy.
1052000	1059000	Yeah, there's a lot of people playing the Final Fantasy XIV online beta right now that are, you know, basically like, Oh, this is just a game trial, right?
1059000	1062000	And not really. There's a lot still missing.
1062000	1065000	We've already seen big changes from the last build to this one.
1065000	1066000	Oh, God, yes.
1066000	1076000	Ospfer says, I also did Mario 3D World at the Nintendo E3 experience. It was pretty fun playing the cat form. The dive mechanic is really awesomely integrated in some of the levels.
1076000	1077000	Yeah, I agree.
1078000	1079000	Very cool.
1079000	1085000	Okay, well, taking a step back and just kind of getting to know you as a gamer a little bit before we get into tonight's news.
1085000	1088000	I always ask the guests this. What's your favorite video game of all time?
1088000	1090000	That's always a really tough question to answer.
1090000	1093000	You can name a couple if you have to. One of your favorite video games.
1093000	1100000	You know, I have to say, if I'm going to just pick one favorite, it would probably be the original Legend of Zelda for NES.
1100000	1109000	Just because I grew up with that game, I know it inside and out. And that's the game that I can just put on the virtual console or whatever and play through in a weekend.
1109000	1118000	And I just know where everything is. I mean, not that familiarity, over familiarity is always good, but you know, it just it always feels like going home again.
1118000	1121000	What do you love about video games?
1122000	1133000	I don't know. You know, I just I like exploring worlds. I like being another character. I just kind of get lost in it. And that's I guess that's always appealed to me. I've always been a nerdy kid.
1133000	1140000	All right. I can identify with that. One other thing and then I'll move on. What possessed you to want to do a podcast?
1140000	1147000	You know, I've known Captain Spike for actually longer than I've known you. So yes, you have.
1147000	1149000	You guys have been besties for a long time.
1149000	1157000	Yeah, we we were just always talking about games and we just thought, you know, why not give it a try? We were inspired by y'all here at OLR.
1157000	1164000	So we just thought we'd give it a go. And we've been going for over a year at this point. So that's a great compliment, though.
1164000	1170000	So thank you. Like any time anybody says like, oh, I mean, you guys did it. So that helped me learn that like I could do it, too.
1170000	1177000	I'm always like that's that's like actually like a great compliment. So thank you. Of course. You guys rock. So you guys rock.
1177000	1185000	No, you know, you love fast here at OLR. All right. Not in this heat. Anything else you want to plug in?
1185000	1189000	Any other shows? Twitter, things like that you want to plug?
1189000	1195000	You know, they can find all of our social links on our website, game buoy dot org.
1195000	1201000	I guess I just would like to shout out to gamer X convention in San Francisco.
1202000	1210000	You know, it's for gamers of all genders and that sort of thing. You don't have to be gay to enjoy gamer.
1210000	1219000	That's true. And Rob and I and Captain Spike and our friends from Game Bar and Koopa Club are going to be doing a podcasting panels there.
1219000	1230000	So if you happen to be heading out there or you didn't really know about it and you think that sounds like a cool thing, you should go over to gamer connect dot org dot com.
1230000	1237000	Oh, I feel bad. I think the ticket pre-sale is going to be done real soon. Yeah. In a couple of weeks. And then the ticket price goes up at the door.
1237000	1241000	If you're in Northern California, really, California at all. You should come with us.
1241000	1246000	If I drive to Disneyland five times a year, ULA people can come up here for a weekend. The thing is, it's right in Japan town.
1246000	1252000	So even if you're like not super into the convention experience, but you kind of want to go, you know, just come hang with us.
1252000	1260000	Go to Japan town. San Francisco. There is plenty to do everywhere. And it's like always 68 degrees.
1260000	1268000	So I can escape this horrible heat wave. So I don't know about today, though, because, you know, today was the big doesn't matter.
1268000	1277000	It's cooler than actually 25 degrees cooler. I think it's been in the 70s. Oh, no. The 70s. Oh, my goodness. All right.
1277000	1282000	OK. Well, thank you. And of course, please continue commenting on tonight's news. Like, certainly here.
1282000	1287000	For the record, it's 68 degrees in San Francisco right now. Wow. For the all you and us.
1287000	1291000	Oh, but tomorrow it'll be 80 for all of you.
1291000	1299000	Let's go, grandpa, if you're listening. Kiss my butt. All right. Anyhow, let's move on into how was your gaming week?
1299000	1304000	We always like to start off the show with a little bit of what types of video games have you been playing this week in dark soccer?
1304000	1308000	I know you've had a big week in gaming. I played old stuff.
1308000	1314000	We hooked up the Super Nintendo last night for my friend Amanda's 30th birthday.
1314000	1325000	Happy birthday, Amanda. And we played Turtles in Time, which is the most awesome game ever.
1325000	1331000	And we had some Super Mario World, some rock and roll racing, which is funny.
1331000	1337000	My my friend's mom turned around and said, is that Black Sabbath coming from the Super Nintendo game?
1337000	1342000	Yes, ma'am, it was. And that was Blizzard before they were Blizzard.
1342000	1349000	Yeah, it was pre Blizzard and which led us to a discussion about the lost Vikings and how you can actually find them in WoW.
1349000	1356000	Yeah, in Alderman. And if you are Horde, though, you can kill them, which is pretty fun.
1356000	1371000	I was doing that when I was way past level. So I played a little bit of Final Fantasy 14 just because I only played a little because of all the stuff going on, especially with being sick and having to clean house and have the party.
1371000	1376000	I finally got to play Cards Against Humanity. It's not a video game, I know, but it's totally wrong.
1376000	1385000	All the nerds are playing it. And I got the best win ever. I should I might say it on air, but it's really horrible.
1385000	1397000	But I did say that it's like an M. Knight, whatever his name is. The plot twist was that Nickelback was really perpetually handicapped.
1397000	1399000	M. Knight Shyamalan. Yeah, whatever.
1399000	1402000	Shyamalan Dean Dong. That's what Dan calls him.
1402000	1412000	So we had the old school SNES stuff last night, and I have played some.
1412000	1417000	I played Mass Victory on Thursday for the live stream, but I only played for a little bit because I was just feeling rotten.
1417000	1419000	I mean, rotten.
1419000	1430000	Today was a very special day because thanks to the lovely generosity of our first mate here, I have 3DS.
1430000	1436000	And then thanks to my husband not wanting me to make puppy eyes and wine at him, I have Animal Crossing.
1436000	1440000	He also got himself the last Fire Emblem game for the DS.
1440000	1443000	So there's a little something in it for you both. That's good, though.
1443000	1450000	And we're probably going to sell my old DSi since we only need to have one of each system.
1450000	1459000	And we have my pink GBA. I have the clear pink one. We have the Nintendo SP, whatever they're called.
1459000	1461000	The one that was done up by the NES.
1461000	1469000	So usually it's like when the new stuff comes out, we'll have one each of us and then sell off one of the old ones.
1469000	1472000	But right now we're poor.
1473000	1478000	So I've been playing, what, six hours of Animal Crossing today.
1478000	1482000	And I've already made the down payment on my house and bought a phone booth.
1482000	1489000	And then one of my friends on Tumblr, who I have to say thank you to my name, Twin, if she's listening.
1489000	1494000	I got a Dave Strider shirt for anyone who's into Homestuck. It was really cool.
1494000	1499000	So my character's running around in it wearing pink glasses because ew, pink, but glasses.
1499000	1501000	So it's kind of a weird hipster.
1501000	1505000	That's a lot for just one day. You've probably done more in a day than I've done in the three weeks I've owned.
1505000	1511000	I have all the fruit now. I do not have a watering can and I do not have a slingshot yet.
1511000	1512000	You'll get it.
1512000	1514000	It better be tomorrow.
1515000	1517000	Don't forget to buy the fortune cookie every day.
1517000	1520000	Oh, shoot. Well, don't you have to have coins or something?
1520000	1525000	Yeah, you get those from walking around. So if you've been walking around with your 3DS today, you have coins.
1525000	1526000	Okay.
1527000	1528000	I'll go buy it.
1528000	1533000	It's so cute. DarkSakura's having to learn about her 3DS and how to add friends and all that stuff. It's fun.
1533000	1543000	And I played that MeFinder quest, shit, whatever, and the two of you I would expect would be Grade A adventurers, but you couldn't kill a ghost.
1543000	1545000	Nope, not until you StreetPass with us several times.
1545000	1551000	Yeah, it's actually based on how many times you StreetPass with a person. Up to, I think, seven times, I think is where it maxes out.
1551000	1555000	I thought you guys would just run amok through my game.
1555000	1558000	No, I'm just like, look at my pretty penguin hat. Isn't it awesome?
1558000	1559000	I love your penguin hat.
1559000	1561000	This is why I stopped playing Find Me because I don't need a better hat.
1561000	1564000	Rob, I honestly like Slykic's hat better.
1564000	1565000	Whatever.
1565000	1566000	The Mario hat.
1566000	1569000	I want to have a propeller hat because that would be awesome.
1569000	1575000	So yeah, Animal Crossing, that's going to be my life from here on out. I did name my town Normandy, like I said I would.
1575000	1576000	Congrats.
1576000	1580000	So either that, so either all of my townsfolk are going to call me Commander.
1580000	1581000	Uh-huh.
1581000	1585000	I mean, my character is Sakura because every Animal Crossing character I've ever had a Sakura.
1585000	1592000	Either that or they're all going to have like French words that would be like Merde or Ulala or Zoot.
1592000	1598000	Today, I made my crappy recreation of the VOG logo in my Animal Crossing town because we finished the custom signboard.
1598000	1602000	So right when you enter the town, you see now a big little VOG logo, my ghetto logo.
1602000	1606000	I have a goal for this game though, to find Dina.
1606000	1607000	You want to be reunited?
1607000	1610000	I want my lesbian back.
1610000	1612000	Ours is a love lung tonight.
1612000	1613000	She was an aardvark, right?
1613000	1615000	No, she wasn't. I don't think she was an aardvark.
1615000	1616000	I thought she was a duck.
1616000	1617000	Whatever.
1617000	1619000	No, Mallory was a duck.
1619000	1621000	There were several ducks, Rob.
1621000	1623000	I don't give a duck.
1623000	1625000	We have diversity.
1625000	1626000	Fine.
1626000	1629000	You and your only aardvarks can be lesbians.
1629000	1631000	Alright, moving on.
1631000	1634000	Loki, I know you haven't been playing Animal Crossing. What have you been playing?
1634000	1637000	I haven't been playing very much at all actually this week.
1638000	1645000	The two things I did play this week, one being Final Fantasy XIV, the beta.
1645000	1647000	I played about an hour of that.
1647000	1650000	I was actually going to play more, but then I just kept getting distracted.
1650000	1655000	I was supposed to play a little bit of Planet Cardine, but I forgot.
1655000	1657000	Hands hurt too much anyways to play anything.
1659000	1662000	Final Fantasy XIV, I leveled to 9.
1662000	1667000	I did my first instance battle thing as part of my storyline.
1667000	1669000	It was alright.
1669000	1674000	I keep running into those event things though.
1674000	1676000	I'll be just going somewhere and it's like,
1676000	1678000	Oh, you stumbled upon a fate.
1678000	1680000	Do shit.
1680000	1682000	I'm like, okay, I guess I will.
1682000	1686000	Then I get killed because I don't notice that my health is going down
1686000	1688000	because it's too much on the screen.
1688000	1690000	There's a tip I have for fates.
1690000	1694000	If you happen to find yourself overwhelmed, run through a big crowd of people.
1694000	1696000	The thing will not follow you.
1696000	1698000	Well, it wasn't that at all.
1698000	1700000	I didn't even notice it was doing a lot of damage to me.
1700000	1702000	It's because I just kept, you know, I'd get done with one
1702000	1705000	and immediately target the next thing and immediately go.
1705000	1710000	Also, many people don't realize the UI is completely customizable even on PS3.
1710000	1713000	If the health bars are not in a unique place for you, try to move them.
1713000	1715000	I should.
1715000	1720000	Then the other thing I played was a little bit of Excite Truck this morning
1720000	1724000	because we wanted to entertain Josh.
1724000	1729000	I was trying to get Mario Kart to work, but my disc wouldn't read in my Wii U,
1729000	1737000	which is weird because it did before and I was just not.
1737000	1741000	Then it's just like, okay, I guess we'll do Wii Play,
1741000	1743000	and then he couldn't understand Wii Play.
1743000	1749000	So we did Excite Truck, and he just kind of let it sit there and coast in a circle.
1749000	1751000	So that was kind of fun.
1751000	1753000	But I actually did get to play a couple of races and stuff.
1753000	1761000	Man, that game looks really basic now that you're not zooming through the landscape at a high rate of speed.
1761000	1763000	It's just very basic looking.
1763000	1766000	I'm like, wow, that is very simple.
1766000	1770000	But it's still one of the few games that utilizes the SD card for a very awesome reason,
1770000	1774000	custom sounds, because their music wasn't very good.
1774000	1776000	It's all right.
1776000	1778000	Let's see, what else?
1778000	1780000	A little bit of housekeeping.
1780000	1785000	Thanks to one of our old listeners of the show
1785000	1791000	and also one of the old players that used to play on the Minecraft server that we had,
1791000	1793000	LordGally.
1793000	1796000	He has actually provided or said, hey, you know what?
1796000	1798000	I have a server that not a lot of people play on.
1798000	1800000	You guys want to come play on our server?
1800000	1806000	So he gave me full access to the admin stuff for it, so we'll be able to set it up.
1806000	1811000	It's actually a lot more flexible than the old ones, so I can actually do all the kind of mods I wanted to do.
1811000	1815000	Well, somebody needs to build a shrine to LordGally first thing for that, because that's an awesome gesture.
1815000	1817000	Thank you, LordGally.
1817000	1820000	I have to check with him, because right now it's set to survival and stuff,
1820000	1825000	so I have to see if he wants to switch it off of that and put it on bucket and everything.
1825000	1829000	But now that I have all the tools to do that, I've just got to sit down and actually research what I want to do.
1829000	1834000	I wanted to put a Spoutcraft server on there, because Spout's pretty awesome,
1834000	1838000	because you can create all the custom shapes and stuff,
1838000	1841000	like other materials that are unique to the game.
1841000	1847000	So you could have new enemies, you could have planes, cars, guns, all sorts of crazy stuff.
1847000	1852000	So I'll see how hard that is and may do that, but it looks like it'll be a lot of fun,
1852000	1854000	and hopefully we'll get to play it again.
1854000	1857000	This man is bouncing off the walls in chat, he's very excited to hear that it's back.
1857000	1863000	So soon, I'll have the details in the Vaga Minecraft forum.
1863000	1866000	Slidekick, are you a Minecraft player? You ever tried that out?
1866000	1870000	I've actually never played Minecraft before, so I probably should.
1870000	1877000	It's different. It's a game, but it's more like Legos on the computer.
1877000	1879000	It's hard to explain.
1880000	1883000	It's clever. It's never really been a high priority for me,
1883000	1886000	but I should check it out, so give it a chance.
1886000	1890000	Okay, if that's it for Loki's Gaming Week, then I will move into my gaming week real quick.
1890000	1895000	I didn't have a lot to play. Honestly, I OD'd on Final Fantasy XIV this weekend during the beta.
1895000	1900000	I played damn near nonstop. I had a couple other things to do here locally,
1900000	1904000	but when I wasn't out and about, I was trying to stay out of the heat,
1904000	1906000	and I was playing the crap out of Final Fantasy XIV beta.
1907000	1915000	My Thaumaturge is level 16. I started with Thaumaturge and switched to Conjurer,
1915000	1919000	and my Conjurer is now 17, so I've got both those jobs going.
1919000	1923000	So is Conjurer the XIV version of a Summoner now?
1923000	1927000	No, that's going to be Arcanist, which isn't in the beta yet, so there's still stuff to add.
1927000	1933000	Arcanist will lead to Summoner and Scholar eventually,
1933000	1940000	and then Thaumaturge leads to Black Mage and Conjurer leads to White Mage.
1940000	1944000	But you don't ever get stuck with just one job.
1944000	1951000	It's not like the XI system of sub-jobs. It's Final Fantasy V's more system where you choose traits.
1951000	1959000	Because my Thaumaturge is level 16, when I play a Conjurer, I can have Thunder and Surecast from my Thaumaturge in my bar.
1959000	1966000	If I were to play a Gladiator, I could actually get weapon skills if they're compatible with my class.
1966000	1970000	But everybody should level a Conjurer to 2 to get a Cure.
1970000	1973000	You could have Cure with almost any class.
1973000	1975000	It makes a lot of stuff easier.
1975000	1981000	I've just been playing the crap out of Final Fantasy XIV. I love it a lot.
1981000	1986000	I think because in some ways it's still an MMO in its early stages.
1986000	1990000	We're not counting 1.0 at this point. I'm just throwing out 1.0.
1990000	1995000	In many ways, some of the combat I realized when I was healing a dungeon the other day,
1995000	1999000	I'm like, you know, this game doesn't really have the complexity of World of Warcraft.
1999000	2003000	All I'm doing is Cure, Cure, Cure, and occasionally I'm doing Medica, which is the group Cure.
2003000	2009000	Sometimes I'll get to nuke the mob, but I don't have the diversity that I have in World of Warcraft spells.
2009000	2013000	Granted, World of Warcraft wasn't always like that. World of Warcraft's five expansions in right now.
2013000	2018000	So it's going to take time for Final Fantasy XIV to build up to that, and I see the potential there.
2018000	2022000	But I love that the combat is so fast-paced, but it's Final Fantasy.
2022000	2032000	I like how you can utilize your terrain as well, because now that you can jump and stuff,
2032000	2040000	you can actually say, okay, I'm going to hop up on here and cast spells from up on top of here,
2040000	2046000	and the monster can't really get around to me. It doesn't work all the time with goblins and stuff,
2046000	2049000	but when they do the bomb toss or whatever, it'll show where the bomb's going to be,
2049000	2053000	and you can run around behind them and you don't take any damage, which is pretty sweet.
2053000	2057000	I actually liked that, too. That one duty I was having a problem with,
2057000	2061000	I ended up just sprinting and kiting him the whole time, but it was really neat.
2061000	2064000	It actually worked a lot better than it did him well.
2064000	2070000	The game is so fanservice-y, too, and it's beautiful. The lighting effects are so beautiful.
2070000	2075000	Have you played it on PC at all? It still looks pretty good on PS3, but my god,
2075000	2078000	some of the spell effects are like when you're casting in the water,
2078000	2083000	and the very first instance you go in is this blue ocean pirate-y thing.
2083000	2087000	I really hope this game goes free-to-play very fast, because I kind of want to play it.
2087000	2088000	Don't hold your breath.
2088000	2093000	I can tell you one thing. If you've got a high-end graphics card and you have everything bumped up all the way,
2093000	2096000	it's just, everything is there.
2096000	2101000	I thought I was going to have to get a new system, but there has been such a jump in performance
2101000	2106000	from the last beta to this beta. I'm like, oh my god, this game looks great on my not-so-great computer.
2106000	2107000	I'm so thrilled.
2107000	2109000	It really sets it to optimize to what you got.
2109000	2115000	Been loving Final Fantasy XIV. One of the other fanservice-y things I have to talk about,
2115000	2119000	the last boss in Tamtara Deepcroft, which is one of the instances,
2119000	2123000	it's a mage with a tentacle face, and I didn't catch it at first,
2123000	2128000	but Alan looks over and goes, dude, that's one of the mage mobs from Final Fantasy I.
2128000	2130000	And I'm like, oh my god, it is.
2130000	2132000	There's all these subtle fanservice things.
2132000	2134000	They changed something, by the way.
2134000	2138000	When you started off in Gridania, did you remake a character there?
2138000	2140000	No, I don't think so.
2140000	2143000	Your intro is different now from how it was in the last one.
2143000	2144000	You have moogles.
2144000	2146000	No, I started in Ulda this time.
2146000	2150000	Well, I went ahead and made another conjurer because I wanted to see if they added new quests.
2150000	2155000	And there's moogles, and it's really funny.
2155000	2156000	That's cute.
2156000	2161000	Techness in chat says, oh, and where's the VoG link shell for Final Fantasy XIV?
2161000	2163000	I accidentally rolled on one of the JP realms.
2163000	2167000	My assumption is that Horde House, being the online gaming show,
2167000	2170000	will kind of pick up the VoG link shell thing and create.
2170000	2174000	Right now we're on Behemoth, but that's subject to change for Beta 4.
2174000	2175000	We will let you know.
2175000	2176000	Behemoth is busy.
2176000	2179000	Yeah, Behemoth is busy, but we want to be on a busy server,
2179000	2181000	just because the first couple weeks might suck,
2181000	2184000	but later on, when the game starts thinning out,
2184000	2186000	you'll want to be on a busy server to find other people.
2186000	2189000	Have they announced what the month-to-month price is going to be yet?
2189000	2190000	15.
2190000	2192000	Is it really 15? I thought it was lower.
2192000	2194000	Well, if it's lower, then that's even better.
2194000	2197000	But I was under the impression it was going to be the 1495 thing.
2197000	2199000	I'm assuming somebody in chat will yell it out,
2199000	2202000	or if Shane Alinko is listening, he'll join shortly and yell it.
2202000	2204000	See, the thing is, I don't know.
2204000	2206000	I hate paying for an MMO month-to-month
2206000	2208000	because I want to play so much other stuff.
2208000	2210000	I feel locked into having to play that
2210000	2212000	to kind of get my money's worth each month,
2212000	2213000	and that's the thing.
2213000	2215000	That's why I quit Final Fantasy XI,
2215000	2218000	because I just wasn't playing it enough,
2218000	2220000	and I'm kind of afraid to get into something.
2220000	2222000	That's why free-to-play, or you buy the game
2222000	2225000	and then you can play whenever works well for me.
2225000	2228000	I like the game. I like it a lot better.
2228000	2231000	It seems to be a lot easier to level up and stuff
2231000	2236000	than XI, which is nice, but I don't know.
2236000	2238000	All right, so anyway, Final Fantasy XIV.
2238000	2240000	And then the other game I've played a lot of this week,
2240000	2243000	Marvel Heroes, the free-to-play MMO,
2243000	2245000	although it's a little more like Diablo.
2245000	2246000	Free my ass.
2246000	2249000	Yeah, well, it's got little transactions up the wazoo.
2249000	2250000	Little?
2250000	2253000	I started as Storm, of course, because I love Storm.
2253000	2256000	So I started playing as Storm, and then after I beat the first boss,
2256000	2258000	I got the Scarlet Witch token,
2258000	2260000	so I can play as Scarlet Witch now, too.
2260000	2261000	That's who I started with.
2261000	2264000	Yeah, so apparently all the characters will drop in the game.
2264000	2266000	It just might take forever.
2266000	2270000	But I'll give a cheap plug to this week's Hoard House,
2270000	2273000	because we had Mihail on this week,
2273000	2276000	and he talked about Marvel Heroes and a lot of League of Legends,
2276000	2279000	which I patched this week so I could play with Mihail
2279000	2282000	later this week when Final Fantasy XIV is not running.
2282000	2283000	HoardHouse.com.
2283000	2284000	It's not running this week?
2284000	2286000	Only on the weekends, right?
2286000	2288000	Yeah, Final Fantasy XIV is only running on the weekends,
2288000	2291000	but the rumor is there's going to be a longer stress test before Beta 4,
2291000	2292000	so we'll see.
2292000	2295000	Anyhow, Slidekick, First Mate Slidekick,
2295000	2296000	what have you been playing this week?
2296000	2298000	What's a week of gaming look like to you?
2298000	2301000	It's pretty much been all Animal Crossing.
2301000	2306000	It's funny because I picked it up actually at the Nintendo experience
2306000	2308000	because they had a display sitting out, so I was like,
2308000	2310000	oh, I probably should get it.
2310000	2313000	And for the first couple of days I only played a little bit,
2313000	2316000	but lately I've just been playing for hours at a time,
2316000	2317000	and I'm like, oh, I've got to sleep now.
2317000	2319000	I also played the shit out of Animal Crossing.
2319000	2322000	That one night we were doing the Google Hangout with everybody.
2322000	2323000	Good times.
2323000	2327000	Yeah, so I just built the upstairs to my house.
2327000	2330000	I've been going to the island a lot, catching bugs.
2330000	2340000	Oh, I got Reggie's house in my spot pass in the Happy Home model homes gallery,
2340000	2343000	so I've been buying a lot of stuff out of Reggie's house.
2343000	2345000	And when you look in his little profile card it says,
2345000	2348000	my body is ready, so yeah.
2348000	2350000	You know it was an intern that did it, people.
2350000	2351000	It's not Reggie's actual house.
2351000	2353000	An intern did it for him.
2353000	2357000	I did notice in some of the screenshots or whatever they were showing of the game
2357000	2362000	that they have a lot of cool niche Japanese arcade stuff you can get.
2362000	2364000	I don't know if they have a Japanese arcade set,
2364000	2368000	but they have a candy cab, claw machine,
2368000	2373000	and some actual table cabinets and stuff like that.
2373000	2374000	They look pretty sweet.
2374000	2377000	Not sweet enough for me to buy a 3DS for the game, but sweet enough.
2377000	2379000	I have a claw machine in my Animal Crossing house.
2379000	2380000	It's awesome.
2380000	2384000	Do you know what I loved in your town was the animal that had the chocolate fondue fountain.
2384000	2388000	That's what I wanted.
2388000	2390000	Who doesn't want a chocolate fondue fountain?
2390000	2391000	Let's be real.
2391000	2392000	And some macaroons.
2392000	2393000	Come on.
2393000	2394000	You know what?
2394000	2396000	The first thing that I bought wasn't making a down payment on my house.
2396000	2397000	I bought a phone booth.
2397000	2399000	Is that the thing that looks like a TARDIS but red?
2399000	2401000	It's the current British style phone booth.
2401000	2405000	One of those was for sale in my town the night of the Google Hangout.
2405000	2408000	Spike was like, open your gates right now.
2408000	2409000	I'm coming to town.
2409000	2413000	That just started this whole wave of Animal Crossing fuckery.
2413000	2417000	Except then he didn't take my virtual boy that I was saving for him.
2417000	2419000	He's a virtual boy fanatic.
2419000	2421000	I'll have to get it to him.
2421000	2422000	Now you're no longer friends.
2422000	2423000	What?
2423000	2428000	If they put in virtual boy games it would totally work with the lenticular.
2428000	2431000	Oh, like a 3DS virtual console thing?
2431000	2432000	Yeah.
2432000	2436000	I don't even know about virtual boy emulation if that's actually a thing.
2436000	2439000	I thought there were early rumors it was going to happen.
2439000	2445000	They just need to make Animal Crossing like the Nintendo version of PlayStation Home.
2445000	2446000	Done.
2446000	2449000	Well, rumors are it's going to go free to play at some point.
2449000	2450000	System seller right there.
2450000	2451000	Makes sense.
2451000	2452000	Anything else?
2452000	2453000	Slidekick?
2453000	2454000	No.
2454000	2456000	Actually just Animal Crossing this week.
2456000	2458000	I've been meaning to get around to some other stuff.
2458000	2460000	But I'm actually in the process of moving.
2460000	2463000	I've been trying to pack up my console games.
2463000	2465000	My 3DS is right here.
2465000	2469000	That's why I've been focusing on 3DS for the most part.
2469000	2472000	Not to give out your home address for all the stalkers.
2472000	2473000	But you're moving to Daly City, right?
2473000	2474000	Yes.
2474000	2476000	Which is just Alan's old digs.
2476000	2479000	Yeah, just Alan's old digs and just a quick bar right away from the city.
2479000	2480000	Yes.
2481000	2482000	Alright.
2482000	2486000	Good thing you missed this weekend because I hear it was crazy.
2486000	2488000	Oh yeah, with all the festivities.
2488000	2489000	Yes.
2489000	2491000	Lots of extra festivities.
2491000	2493000	Lots of stuff in the news to be festive about.
2493000	2495000	But we are going to move into gaming news.
2495000	2497000	But first I want to go over some housekeeping.
2497000	2499000	Of course I always like to plug our Twitter.
2499000	2501000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
2501000	2502000	And Facebook.
2502000	2504000	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2504000	2506000	And I was going to plug this during housekeeping.
2506000	2507000	We already mentioned it at the top of the show.
2507000	2508000	But I'll plug it again.
2508000	2509000	GamerX.
2509000	2510000	Catch me.
2510000	2514000	I'll be there live August 4th.
2514000	2515000	Saturday.
2515000	2516000	Question mark.
2516000	2517000	I think the third is the Saturday.
2517000	2518000	Yeah.
2518000	2519000	It's.
2519000	2520000	Oh yeah.
2520000	2521000	I keep thinking.
2521000	2522000	Friday's not an official day.
2522000	2523000	Friday's the VIP day.
2523000	2524000	Okay.
2524000	2526000	It's the third and it's at seven o'clock in one of the panel rooms.
2526000	2527000	It's podcast.
2527000	2528000	I thought it was six o'clock.
2528000	2530000	God, I'm so unprepared tonight.
2530000	2531000	Look.
2531000	2534000	You get there and you just look for podcast cross zone.
2534000	2536000	And you're going to go to it because it has the word podcast in it.
2536000	2541000	And that's where you're going to see me and Slidekick and all the kids from Koopa Club
2541000	2544000	and Spike and Game Bar.
2544000	2545000	And it's going to be fun.
2545000	2546000	Come up and say hello.
2546000	2547000	It will be great times.
2547000	2552000	And earlier today before the show, I was talking about cosplay because I think there is a costume
2552000	2553000	I can pull off.
2553000	2554000	That's that's tasteful.
2554000	2556000	You're going to pull off your costume?
2556000	2557000	No.
2557000	2558000	This is tasteful Slidekick.
2558000	2562000	He's going to do the gladiator armor from Final Fantasy 14.
2562000	2563000	Oh yeah.
2564000	2565000	Yes.
2565000	2566000	I'm going to wear the what is the sublegar?
2566000	2567000	The panties.
2567000	2568000	The leather mantis.
2568000	2569000	No.
2569000	2571000	You'd probably be very popular if you wore that.
2571000	2572000	Yeah.
2572000	2573000	No.
2573000	2574000	No.
2574000	2576000	They'll be like, OK, that guy does not have the body to wear something like that.
2576000	2577000	So.
2577000	2578000	All right.
2578000	2580000	So I will wear something that will keep me covered.
2580000	2581000	Thank you.
2581000	2585000	I just turned 35, you know, so I don't need to be showing on my wrinkles.
2585000	2586000	Such a press.
2586000	2587000	I know.
2587000	2588000	All right.
2588000	2592000	Anyhow, let's for real get into some of the gaming news this week.
2592000	2598000	This is the gaming news that may not be on your radar or it's pinging huge on your radar.
2598000	2599000	One or the other.
2599000	2600000	Right.
2600000	2601000	It's like.
2601000	2602000	Yeah.
2602000	2603000	All right.
2603000	2604000	Start us off.
2604000	2605000	All right.
2605000	2611000	So Index Corporation, the I think a pretty recent parent company of Atlas, they are having
2611000	2612000	some problems.
2612000	2621000	They are basically filing for civil rehabilitation and maybe selling off assets.
2621000	2624000	I'm assuming.
2624000	2628400	Basically saying that, you know, the index media or index digital media, Inc. and Atlas
2628400	2633000	brand are unaffected by the proceedings of, I guess, in Japan.
2633000	2636000	They are going to be carrying on their day to day activities.
2636000	2637000	Business as usual.
2637000	2643000	Shimagami Tensei 4 and Dragon's Crown are still scheduled for release in summer.
2643000	2648000	And they also have some other titles that they're publishing, including the movie tie
2648000	2652000	in for R.I.P.D. and I guess Daylight.
2652000	2653000	Oh, yeah.
2653000	2654000	Daylight.
2654000	2656000	I don't even remember what Daylight is.
2656000	2659000	Daylight is the like survival horror.
2659000	2664000	You're thrown in a haunted house, I think, with only a flashlight and the PlayStation
2664000	2668000	I record your scares so that like your friends can laugh at you.
2668000	2670000	That's kind of funny.
2670000	2671000	So, yeah.
2671000	2673000	So I don't know.
2673000	2675000	Maybe they're not in too much trouble.
2675000	2679000	It's hard to say with Atlas because Atlas, they kind of deal with a lot of niche properties.
2679000	2682000	So for, you know, money seems to be very tight.
2682000	2684000	Very small production runs.
2684000	2687000	Very small everything.
2687000	2688000	Budget.
2688000	2690000	So it's hard to say.
2690000	2692000	Yeah, I've seen a lot of people worried about them.
2692000	2695000	But I mean, Atlas is well loved enough that they'll find a home.
2695000	2698000	A lot of people think that Sony or Nintendo would snap them up.
2698000	2703000	But I would be wouldn't be surprised if like Gung Ho or somebody would snap them up.
2703000	2704000	Marvelous.
2704000	2707000	And a lot of people are afraid that EA might snap them up.
2707000	2714000	I would think it would be like more like a Marvelous or what else?
2714000	2718000	Access? I don't think it's too big to do that.
2718000	2722000	But I mean, those are kind of the three niche comp- or three companies that bring over
2722000	2725000	localized Japanese product nowadays.
2727000	2731000	I guess maybe there's the other one, too, that's a spinoff of-
2731000	2733000	What the fuck was it called?
2733000	2738000	There was another spinoff company, too, that does some localization.
2738000	2740000	Didn't XSeed just acquire somebody?
2740000	2742000	Yeah, XSeed's Marvelous USA now.
2742000	2744000	Oh, that's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2744000	2746000	They should snap up Atlas, too. That would be great.
2746000	2748000	Well, I don't think they're big enough.
2748000	2751000	I mean, XSeed's, I think, quite small compared to Atlas.
2751000	2754000	Atlas was kind of growing quite a bit.
2754000	2758000	I thought they were going to be branching out more into like Western development stuff as well.
2758000	2763000	Because they tried with Game of Thrones and they have a few Sherlock Holmes games and stuff.
2763000	2766000	But nothing's really taken off.
2766000	2768000	It's too bad because Game of Thrones could have been good.
2768000	2770000	Except it was a really bad game.
2770000	2773000	That PlayStation 3 game you're talking about, the horror game, sounds really good.
2773000	2775000	Sounds interesting.
2775000	2777000	Better than what they have?
2777000	2779000	Sony I thought had a PlayStation Move game.
2779000	2781000	Although I don't know if it's Move anymore.
2782000	2788000	What was it? That one, it was supposed to be like a teen horror genre type game.
2788000	2790000	I don't really know how that was going to work.
2790000	2792000	It's like a...
2792000	2794000	I don't even remember the title of it now.
2794000	2796000	Because it was that memorable.
2796000	2798000	Shadow neck Shannon in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says,
2798000	2800000	What if Microsoft bought Atlas?
2800000	2803000	They would have a lot of Japanese content on their platform then.
2805000	2809000	Well, that won't do them any good since they're not putting out the Xbox One in Japan at launch.
2809000	2814000	It would be an interesting, strategical move, but I think for Microsoft also a risky one.
2814000	2816000	You know what I mean?
2816000	2818000	Yeah.
2818000	2824000	I've heard a couple people say that could be a thing, but I don't think Microsoft really would do it.
2824000	2828000	I think a lot of Nintendo fanboys would just eat it up if Nintendo would do it though.
2828000	2833000	That only exists in fanboy imagination, I think.
2833000	2835000	But you never know.
2836000	2838000	Alright, well let's move on to another story.
2838000	2840000	And this is about Saints Row 4.
2840000	2842000	Oh, Loki's looking forward to this one.
2842000	2845000	Well, it's a good thing Loki doesn't live in Australia, or he might be waiting a little bit longer.
2845000	2848000	Oh, please. Like, Australia stopped me from getting this.
2848000	2851000	Yeah, right. And I'm sure there's a lot of people in Australia that are saying the same thing.
2851000	2861000	However, Saints Row 4 is now the first game to be refused classification in the country since Australia released their R18 Plus rating at the start of the year.
2861000	2863000	Which doesn't make any sense to me.
2863000	2869000	Yeah, I thought the whole reason the rating system was out was because when games wouldn't be classified before, they wouldn't be sold.
2869000	2871000	Like, I remember Mortal Kombat was in that category.
2871000	2876000	Yeah, because it was like an R up to 18 or something, or 17 or something.
2876000	2883000	Well, anyhow, Deep Silver is working on basically a fix for Saints Row 4, but just for that region.
2883000	2889000	They say they're going to remove the content that could cause offense without reducing the outlandish gameplay the Saints Row fans know and love.
2889000	2891000	I don't know how they're going to do that, but good luck.
2891000	2896000	There's going to be a mod immediately after it comes out that'll put it all right back.
2896000	2898000	Especially on PC.
2898000	2904000	How cute that Australia thinks it could regulate some of that, because on the internet this stuff will just come over instantly.
2904000	2906000	I just don't understand.
2906000	2908000	It just encourages piracy, too.
2908000	2911000	But did you hear the reason why it got...
2911000	2914000	I didn't hear the specific reason why, no. What was it?
2914000	2916000	They have an anal probe.
2916000	2917000	Oh.
2917000	2918000	Oh, no.
2918000	2919000	No.
2919000	2921000	See, I was wondering where they would take the dildo vat next.
2921000	2922000	No, no, no.
2922000	2923000	Yeah, they have an anal...
2923000	2924000	Does it have a big satellite?
2924000	2932000	It basically looks like a giant dildo with a sword hilt or something on it, and you can shove it up the ass of your enemies.
2932000	2935000	I'm like, this makes me want to buy the game even more.
2935000	2937000	I can't wait.
2937000	2939000	I got to find...
2939000	2941000	Yeah, you just finished talking there.
2941000	2947000	I'm going to find the exact description was hilarious.
2948000	2951000	Didn't an episode of South Park have the anal probe, though?
2951000	2954000	Wasn't that the first episode? Cartman gets an anal probe?
2954000	2955000	I think it was.
2955000	2957000	The moment he said anal probe, the whole,
2957000	2959000	I like to sing about the moon and the truth,
2959000	2961000	popped into my head in that episode.
2961000	2966000	Also, I guess games are getting hit left and right in Australia now.
2966000	2971000	State of Decay is another game that's been refused classification in Australia.
2971000	2975000	This was just not even that long after Word of Saints Row 4 happened.
2976000	2981000	Microsoft is evaluating the options with regards to the title's classification.
2981000	2988000	The Australian classification system plays an important role in ensuring that Australians can only access age-appropriate games and content.
2988000	2991000	That was one day after Saints Row 4.
2993000	2994000	Wow.
2995000	3000000	I kind of thought that this was supposed to stop all that censorship stuff, but I guess not.
3000000	3002000	Alright, let's see here.
3002000	3003000	Here we go.
3003000	3006000	This is the report, or from the report that they filed.
3006000	3011000	It says, the game includes a weapon referred to the applicant as an alien anal probe.
3011000	3014000	The applicant states that this weapon can be shoved into enemies' backsides.
3014000	3017000	The lower half of the weapon resembles a sword hilt.
3017000	3026000	The upper part contains prong-like appendages which circle around what appears to be a large dildo which runs down the center of the weapon.
3026000	3031000	When using this weapon, the player approaches a clothed victim from behind and thrusts the weapon between their legs
3031000	3036000	and then lifts them off the ground before pulling the trigger which launches the victim into the air.
3037000	3038000	Sold!
3039000	3041000	That's not a probe, that's more like a bottle rocket.
3041000	3042000	You're such a teenager.
3042000	3043000	That's an ass launcher.
3044000	3045000	An ass launcher?
3045000	3046000	Ass launcher.
3046000	3047000	Ass master!
3047000	3054000	Apparently after the probe has been inserted into the victim's anus, the area around their buttocks becomes pixelated,
3054000	3057000	highlighting that the aim of the weapon is to penetrate the victim's anus.
3057000	3061000	The weapon can be used during gameplay to enemy characters and civilians.
3063000	3066000	As long as they don't leave a blood trail, that would just be wrong.
3066000	3075000	Yeah, and also alien narcotics was the other reason why, I guess, smoking alien narcotics equips the players with superpowers.
3075000	3076000	Awesome.
3077000	3080000	Do they actually get superpowers or do they just think they have superpowers?
3080000	3081000	Who cares.
3082000	3085000	Alrighty then, let's move on with something else.
3085000	3087000	I don't want to be on this planet anymore.
3087000	3092000	Okay, well, a lot of people are not happy with Microsoft.
3092000	3097000	And among the people who are unhappy with Microsoft is the creator of Fez, Phil Fish.
3098000	3101000	Try saying Fez and Phil Fish together three times fast.
3101000	3102000	Fez, Phil Fish, Phil Fish, Phil Fish.
3102000	3103000	See?
3103000	3104000	Cubos.
3105000	3112000	But basically he's saying that Microsoft was doing nothing to help sell his game on Xbox Live Arcade.
3113000	3114000	He complained about it on Twitter.
3114000	3118000	He said Microsoft was our publisher on Xbox 360 and they did nothing.
3118000	3120000	No promotion, no festivals, not a single mention.
3122000	3128000	In a newsletter or conference, they put us up on their shitty dashboard and somehow fucked that up too.
3128000	3132000	They put us up on the game marketplace with no cover image.
3132000	3134000	The file was missing for a week.
3135000	3143000	So basically, there's also, he's also saying that Microsoft is charging developers $10,000 for patches and updates.
3145000	3153000	And there's a lot of crap going on between, with misinformation going from Microsoft,
3153000	3157000	not telling them about corruption within the file system or anything like that.
3157000	3161000	So basically, they're like, oh, we don't really care, indie developer.
3161000	3163000	We just want you to put your game up there.
3163000	3164000	We don't, we're not going to promote it.
3164000	3165000	Just put it there.
3165000	3166000	We're not going to put anybody behind you.
3167000	3170000	ActDeft in chat says, Phil Fish, I hate the guy, but he's right in this one.
3171000	3172000	Yeah.
3172000	3175000	I mean, yeah, because Microsoft doesn't let people self-publish to the indie.
3175000	3179000	I mean, they have XNA for self-publishing, although they're not going to be supporting that anymore.
3179000	3186000	And this is part of why people are mad because you can publish under Microsoft, but then, you know, there's all these other complaints.
3186000	3190000	Yeah, and Microsoft was charging $10,000 for them to put in a fix in corrupted files.
3190000	3193000	Yeah, Fez really got screwed by all that business.
3194000	3205000	And on top of that, Microsoft did confirm that they automatically charged developers for resubmissions of games was scrapped in April, is what they're saying.
3205000	3208000	But they never told any of the developers about that.
3208000	3212000	They said that the new policy was retroactive, but they never said anything.
3213000	3215000	Well, didn't you have more information on that, Loki?
3215000	3216000	Nope, I had exactly that information.
3216000	3222000	And of course, on top of that, you know, Phil Fish is still pissed off about the whole thing.
3222000	3229000	See, this is kind of funny, I think, because he was complaining that, oh, well, you know, I don't know if he had a patch or something.
3229000	3234000	First he put out a patch for the game, and it fucked up the game even more than the patch, you know, without the patch.
3234000	3240000	And so then they pulled the patch, I guess, and he couldn't resubmit the patch or something.
3240000	3243000	But now that it's free, why isn't he resubmitting the patch?
3244000	3247000	Perhaps by this point it's just done with the fuckery.
3247000	3255000	But if he had it done already, if he had that fixed patch done already, I'm assuming he still has the data, why can't he just resubmit it instead of being a complete douche?
3256000	3261000	I know, because he wants to sell Feds 2, which will be coming out to platforms other than Xbox One.
3261000	3270000	Unless it's seriously trying to distance himself from Microsoft, which I can see that, trying just to remove any association between your product and Microsoft.
3270000	3277000	I mean, especially, I mean, keep in mind the bottom line of development is money.
3278000	3284000	If he's trying to market a next game, it's a smart move to separate it from where it's already been screwed over.
3284000	3288000	Well, ShadowNextGen in our chat says, Sony was charging for updates too, I believe. It wasn't Microsoft.
3288000	3290000	I don't think they were charging that much.
3290000	3295000	I want to say I remember hearing something like that too, because I remember it was a big deal when Wii U first came out,
3295000	3299000	is that's why indies were embracing it, is because Nintendo wasn't charging.
3299000	3301000	And that was like a huge selling point.
3304000	3307000	I'm pretty sure, I mean, Sony has to have gotten rid of that since though.
3307000	3315000	They might have just done it a lot quieter than Microsoft did, because look at all those indies they lured to their E3 press conference.
3316000	3324000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, Earth.
3325000	3331000	Alright, well speaking of Microsoft, a very interesting patent revealed out of Microsoft.
3331000	3334000	It was a patent filed back in December of 2011.
3334000	3339000	This would have been around the time Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary or the Halo remake came out.
3340000	3345000	It was a patent for a video game that would, quote, have a plurality of game engines running concurrently.
3345000	3353000	And you might remember, the Halo Anniversary game lets you go between updated visuals and original Xbox back and forth.
3353000	3361000	Apparently, this is what the patent was out there for, is that it was for remakes of games where you could have original graphics and,
3361000	3367000	I thought this was interesting, leveraging player emotions tied to the original experience.
3367000	3373000	However, this may be lost as modern graphics may cause the gamers to lose that feeling of nostalgia.
3373000	3377000	So it was because of an emotional connection, which I guess I could see that.
3377000	3386000	I mean like, when I download some of the, there was a whole bunch of these games on Xbox Live Arcade when that first came out, like all the Konami remakes.
3386000	3389000	And you could play like Gyruss, you could play it with the original graphics or the HD graphics.
3389000	3396000	You have to play with the original graphics. I can't play with the new graphics because they're not that good and it's hard to see the bullets sometimes.
3396000	3401000	Well that's a different thing, that's not that you're nostalgic for the old graphics, it's just that you're really lame.
3401000	3402000	Maybe a little bit.
3402000	3408000	So, I don't know, sounds like you're smoking some alien narcotics here because I don't see the point.
3408000	3411000	Weren't we having that discussion though about voice acting today?
3411000	3412000	Oh, a little bit, yeah.
3412000	3421000	With Metal Gear, how they updated the voice acting, I mean it was all the same people, but they didn't put the same cheesiness into it, I guess.
3421000	3422000	I wonder if it's sort of along the same lines.
3422000	3435000	Well a lot of that happened with the Silent Hill HD remakes too, is that people are extremely partial to the original Silent Hill, but because of contracts and things like that, they couldn't reuse that dialogue in the HD remake, so they redid it.
3435000	3438000	The original Silent Hill 3 was a lot better.
3438000	3441000	Slidekick, are you emotionally tied to retro games?
3441000	3448000	You know what this actually made me think of is when they put out the Star Wars DVDs that had the original video.
3448000	3453000	I think it might have been like a laser disc transfer or something because that's all they had that wasn't destroyed at that point.
3453000	3454000	Which one?
3454000	3459000	The original Star Wars trilogy, they put out a DVD set that was like two discs.
3459000	3461000	Which I have that set.
3461000	3462000	Yeah, me too.
3462000	3464000	That were the theatrical releases.
3464000	3465000	Yes.
3465000	3468000	And those I think were redone off of film prints.
3468000	3469000	Oh, film prints, okay.
3469000	3472000	So like hand shot first on the laser disc?
3473000	3480000	I have a version of it. I have the THX remasters on laser disc, or yes indeed he shot first.
3480000	3493000	We call them the non fucked up remasters because they actually had the whole THX sound, they did all the cleanup, they had the extra, you know where you see the X's flying in the air instead of X wings flying in the air?
3493000	3498000	They had all of the corrections made but they didn't do any of the changes.
3498000	3501000	And I got it for 11 bucks.
3501000	3507000	That's a good point though that people are definitely tied to that emotionally because you bring up the new Star Wars with anybody.
3507000	3512000	Is there anybody out there, anybody that prefers Lucas's changes in the original trilogy? Anybody?
3512000	3515000	People with brain damage. I mean, I'm sorry.
3515000	3516000	Don't offend.
3516000	3517000	You know what?
3517000	3519000	Diversity, Dark Sakura.
3519000	3520000	You know what?
3520000	3521000	What?
3521000	3522000	Still wrong.
3522000	3526000	I don't think people are that nostalgic for Xbox One graphics to be honest.
3527000	3536000	They're redoing the game with, you know, I think it was like Halo 3 or Halo Reach's engine, which is not bad and definitely the graphics look way better.
3536000	3542000	I don't see the point of having to tax the system that much by running two copies of the game at the same time.
3542000	3546000	I think it's a little ridiculous because you either sell a copy of the game.
3546000	3554000	I mean, I wonder if they have the actual data of how many people actually play that game with the new graphics versus old graphics.
3554000	3560000	And then also a subset of that, how many people play the game with the new graphics and old graphics and use the Kinect to...
3560000	3562000	Old graphics, new graphics, old graphics, new graphics.
3562000	3564000	The same people that sit there and yell grenade to throw a grenade.
3564000	3570000	Grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade.
3570000	3574000	And you know, HD remasters seem to be pretty popular, so I mean, I don't know why.
3574000	3578000	But some of them are so good. Like, I am so there for the Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy X.
3578000	3579000	Oh, that looks gorgeous.
3579000	3585000	I'm just, I'm running up to the feeder bar. Gimme pellet, gimme pellet. Like, you know, some of that, you know, I'm a sucker for some of it.
3585000	3589000	You know who I wouldn't want to go up against, you know, using the Kinect and the Halo thing?
3589000	3594000	The guy that used to do the Micro Machines commercials because, my God, he would fucking own online.
3594000	3597000	I think he should be relieved that he's dead.
3597000	3598000	It doesn't matter.
3598000	3600000	And John Machida.
3600000	3603000	There's always, there's always a master and an apprentice, okay?
3603000	3606000	There's somebody out there that's, you know, gonna follow up.
3606000	3607000	For the record.
3607000	3610000	But if we don't have the proof that he's dead and he's not six feet under, then it's not the real thing.
3610000	3614000	For the record, he was also Blur in the Transformers movie, just saying.
3614000	3618000	Did any of you play Mega Man Powered Up for PSP?
3618000	3620000	It was the remake of Mega Man 1.
3620000	3621000	Yes.
3621000	3630000	It wasn't bad, but they replaced the original Mega Man 1 music, which, you know, one has good music, but I mean, it's not two or three.
3630000	3633000	The GameCube one, too, I think.
3633000	3634000	Oh, really?
3634000	3636000	I don't think it had the redunk, I can't remember.
3636000	3638000	It just had this cutesy music that I was like, no, no, no.
3638000	3640000	Yeah, it had, like, the new music in it, yeah.
3640000	3645000	It was just too cutesy, so I can understand the nostalgia thing at times, but, you know.
3645000	3646000	Alright.
3646000	3650000	Alright, let's move on with some more news.
3650000	3652000	Dark Soccer's got something for us, then we're gonna get to release dates.
3652000	3655000	I was trying to find out when John Machida died.
3655000	3656000	Oh, well.
3656000	3657000	Stories.
3657000	3658000	It was a while ago.
3658000	3659000	It was a while.
3659000	3660000	I hate to say it, it was a while ago.
3660000	3663000	I think it was sometime while I was still in high school, maybe?
3663000	3664000	I don't know.
3664000	3671000	Anyway, there is some good news for people who were gonna put some stock into the Xbox
3671000	3672000	One.
3672000	3676000	They've actually improved the memory performance for the console.
3676000	3684000	Basically, they, let me see if I can't find exactly the amount.
3684000	3691000	They've actually have now a 32 megabyte of embedded static RAM that's going to make up
3691000	3697000	the difference in processing speed between what was previously announced for the Xbox
3697000	3699000	One and the PlayStation 4.
3699000	3705000	But, meh, I don't know if it's still gonna be as good.
3705000	3711000	They're saying that right now, that 192 gigabytes a second is theoretically possible.
3711000	3713000	I know, what do you think?
3713000	3714000	32 megabytes of RAM?
3714000	3720000	Man, that console must be worth thousands of dollars, said somebody in the 90s.
3720000	3729000	Well, they're saying it's this embedded static RAM, which I think just means it's a new chip.
3729000	3735000	It just kinda sucks because launch games always are not gonna look as good as games later
3735000	3738000	in the console's lifespan.
3738000	3744000	Especially now that they're like, oh, right away we're shipping with more memory.
3744000	3748000	The games that are prepared for launch probably won't be able to take advantage of that, and
3748000	3749000	that kinda sucks.
3749000	3757000	Well, they were saying right now that their original calculations, just as a base calculation,
3757000	3764000	came up to 128 bytes per block multiplied by 800 megahertz, and that now that they've
3764000	3769000	been able to reasonably get in their simulations 133 gigabytes a second.
3769000	3773000	Alright, and I want no excuses if the Xbox One versions are inferior to the PlayStation
3773000	3774000	4 versions.
3774000	3775000	That's what I'm just saying.
3775000	3778000	Now that you're not gonna get your games online, we got more speed.
3778000	3779000	Hold on a second there.
3779000	3781000	You said you added 32 megs of RAM.
3781000	3784000	This should be night and day difference, right?
3784000	3786000	On my 486.
3786000	3795000	I honestly think this is a bunch of just, it's a bullet point to report on and no one
3795000	3796000	knows what the hell it means.
3796000	3800000	Why, if they're just gonna add this RAM, why can't the developers just go back and turn
3800000	3802000	up the graphics on level 3?
3802000	3804000	Don't they just take a big dial and turn up the graphics?
3804000	3805000	I guess they could.
3805000	3808000	What they're basically saying this means is that for some of the games that they showed
3808000	3813000	in E3 that kind of stuttered along, that it should improve performance dramatically.
3813000	3815000	I mean, I'm not sure what this 32 megabyte thing is gonna do.
3815000	3820000	I mean, it has to be something involved with another calculation, like maybe a buffer or
3820000	3821000	something, I don't know.
3821000	3824000	It's to save more pictures of you masturbating.
3824000	3825000	Wow.
3825000	3826000	On its Kinect.
3826000	3828000	It's the fat box one.
3828000	3834000	The 32 megabytes is basically just to put it in its actual, you know, so it runs off
3834000	3835000	an actual console.
3835000	3836000	Yeah.
3836000	3838000	Tigerclaw in chat says, yeah, he's right.
3838000	3843000	The first crop of games won't take full advantage of the hardware until, whoa, what the hell,
3843000	3847000	until, don't paste five lines at once when I'm trying to read.
3847000	3851000	Tigerclaw says, the first crop of games won't take full advantage of the hardware until
3851000	3855000	a year or so later when the developers finally figured out how to push the hardware to its
3855000	3856000	limits.
3856000	3857000	But that happens with every console.
3857000	3858000	What was that?
3858000	3859000	RAM or not?
3859000	3860000	What was that Rome game?
3860000	3861000	Rise.
3861000	3862000	Rise.
3862000	3864000	Rise from your wave.
3864000	3868000	Uh, they were saying that like it looks choppy right now and that like, you know, this might
3868000	3872000	smooth out some frame rates or something, but we'll see.
3872000	3873000	Wow.
3873000	3878000	A fifth dream in that big post he put says the Micro Machines guy is not dead.
3878000	3879000	Yes.
3879000	3882000	But seriously though, if he was in this, I swore he was dead too.
3882000	3885000	Well, I mean, I didn't like swear like, God, I hope he's dead.
3885000	3890000	He'd be dead within the first 15 seconds of that, you know, uh, Eddie Murphy movie 1000
3890000	3891000	kids.
3891000	3898000	So maybe, maybe I'm looking at the Wikipedia article and sure enough, Wiki says he ain't
3898000	3899000	dead.
3899000	3900000	Huh?
3900000	3901000	Well, that's good.
3901000	3902000	Then maybe I'm thinking of somebody else.
3902000	3904000	No, it was, it was, what's his name?
3904000	3905000	Um, Chris Lotta.
3905000	3906000	Hmm.
3906000	3909000	I was thinking of, well, he just needs to come back and do something.
3909000	3910000	Anything.
3910000	3911000	I don't care.
3911000	3912000	I need him talking in something.
3912000	3915240	Trailer TV movie.
3915240	3916240	It doesn't matter.
3916240	3917240	Yeah.
3917240	3918240	I was thinking of Chris Lotta.
3918480	3922320	At least that urban legend, I can understand someone falling for that cause I, I could
3922320	3925280	swear, I could swear like I've heard that that guy's dead too.
3925280	3928840	It's not like you came on here and said like the kid from the wonder years is Marilyn Manson.
3928840	3930720	Like people believe that.
3930720	3931720	Yeah.
3931720	3937240	It was Chris Lotta that died in 1994 and he was the voice of a Starscream and Cobra commander.
3937240	3938240	Oh, okay.
3938240	3942240	So I have the stupid transformers analogy in my head.
3942240	3944320	All right, look, uh, we're getting way off track.
3944320	3947280	So why don't we talk about some release dates, some video games that we could play this week
3947320	3949840	and get our mind off of dead celebrities.
3949840	3952720	There is not a much coming out this week.
3952720	3958320	It's basically just one 3DS game and it's Crash City Mayhem.
3958320	3962960	The only reason I think it's kind of cool for the 3DS is it's based off a really old
3962960	3969040	series called Runabout, which is on the Sega Dreamcast and PlayStation one or, you know,
3969040	3974480	if you played it over here in the United States, it was Felony 179, a racing game where the
3974480	3979160	whole point of the game was a crash in the shit and it was awesome and super glitchy.
3979160	3985000	I remember one time I took a full size bus, a tour bus, and I tried to go through the
3985000	3986600	train tunnel.
3986600	3989880	I don't even know how I got it in the train tunnel and I tried to turn around like, you
3989880	3993960	know, you do an awesome, the Austin Powers movie and it got stuck in there in such a
3993960	3998040	way that it started spinning like a helicopter until it got enough speed where it shot straight
3998040	3999040	up through the roof.
3999040	4000040	Hilarious.
4000040	4001040	Good times.
4001040	4002040	Yeah, that's it.
4002040	4003040	That's all that's coming out this week.
4003040	4004040	All right, well let's go over to Japan.
4004040	4008920	On July 4th in Japan on the PlayStation three, Loki's really excited.
4008920	4011680	Earth Defense Forces four is out.
4011680	4014160	I'm may have to import that.
4014160	4016440	It'll cost you $71 and 49.
4016440	4018000	I may have to import that.
4018000	4019000	Wow.
4019000	4020000	Alrighty.
4020000	4024240	Uh, you could also import for much cheaper, a smart headset three, which is also released
4024240	4026720	on the PlayStation three.
4026720	4027720	Who cares?
4027720	4028720	Right?
4028720	4030920	How about on the Xbox three 60 also earth defense forces four.
4030920	4035000	There's also a limited edition with gold membership for 86 99 I'm assuming that's like
4035000	4039000	Xbox live Japan cause you know who's paying for Xbox live over there.
4039000	4040000	Very few people.
4040000	4041000	I'm sure.
4041000	4043840	Um, nothing of note on the Vita this week.
4043840	4047160	I'm just looking at my other releases and nothing really on Wii U either.
4047160	4049760	Did you know they don't have new super Luigi until July 13th.
4049760	4052500	Oh, I bet that's the retail release though.
4052500	4054800	They probably have the download version, just not the retail release.
4054800	4056880	Well how about on the Nintendo three as three DS?
4056880	4058800	There's a couple of games there.
4058800	4064480	Uh, Toriko gourmet battle comes out as well as mommy Goma, happy sweets farm.
4064480	4065800	That sounds nice.
4065800	4069720	I want to see what, God, I hope it's not another game starring scantily clad characters.
4069720	4072280	Oh, it's the little seal cute thing.
4072280	4073280	Yes.
4073280	4076760	This stars a little seal cute thing and plushies of the little seal.
4076760	4077760	Oh God, these things are adorable.
4077760	4082060	It looks like they just kind of wither on the ground and they run a farm.
4082060	4085000	It's Farmville and they also make sushi rolls.
4085000	4086000	It's Farmville.
4086000	4087000	Rob, that's a sweet roll.
4087000	4088000	That's a sweet roll.
4088440	4089440	That's a Swiss cake.
4089440	4092680	Oh, it's a little Debbie roll with the strawberry.
4092680	4094840	It's called a Swiss cake.
4094840	4097120	Like I said, a little Debbie.
4097120	4099760	It's a strawberry shortcake.
4099760	4101640	I want them to localize that.
4101640	4103280	I want a fucking strawberry shortcake.
4103280	4104280	Damn.
4104280	4107260	You know, we have strawberry cheesecake ice cream at my house.
4107260	4109080	That would involve going to my house after the show.
4109080	4111000	That would involve no cause that would involve going outside.
4111000	4112920	I'm sorry to say.
4112920	4114280	That's it for Japanese releases.
4114280	4115280	Star Sakura.
4115280	4116280	How about the UK?
4116280	4117600	Stuff.
4117600	4120120	Stuff and things are coming out.
4120120	4124160	What we have on July 3rd is we have Limbo for iPad and iPhone.
4124160	4125160	Oh my God.
4125160	4127120	I need that on my phone.
4127120	4129120	Not really.
4129120	4130840	Mortal Kombat Complete Collection.
4130840	4132880	Sorry, Complete Edition.
4132880	4136360	They should have called it Complete Collection, but no, I see why because then they would
4136360	4137360	have been racist.
4137360	4138360	Yeah.
4138360	4139360	But that's on PC.
4139360	4140720	Well, you know what I mean.
4140720	4143480	Too many, too many.
4143480	4150760	Then we have a scourge outbreak on Xbox 360 and on July 4th we have Trackmania 2 Valley
4150760	4154200	and on the 5th we have Dark.
4154200	4155200	Sakura?
4155200	4156200	No.
4156200	4157200	Just Dark.
4157200	4158200	Sakura.
4158200	4160920	It's a vampire stealth action game.
4160920	4163640	I don't know why, but that made me think of Craig Ferguson.
4163640	4166760	Being published by Atlas because they publish Calypso games now.
4166760	4167760	Okay.
4167760	4172640	It made me think of Craig Ferguson talking about damp being a color.
4172640	4176320	Just a couple more news stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week, Loki.
4176320	4180000	Or don't.
4180000	4184560	So there's some cool stuff being added to Steam.
4184560	4188840	First off, the source software development kit now is including native support for the
4188840	4190080	Oculus Rift.
4190080	4197680	So if you have the dev kit, you got more games to play it on or at least hopefully soon.
4197680	4202040	So they're really embracing that and that's going to be kind of cool.
4202040	4206920	And then finally, the Steam trading cards, it's out of beta.
4206920	4209000	Now it's available to everybody.
4209000	4215120	So far it supports 30 games including Team Fortress 2, Faster Than Light, Grid 2, Monaco
4215120	4223840	Trying 2, Super Meat Boy, Counter Strike Global Offensive, Portal, Half Life, Don't
4223840	4225760	Starve and Borderlands 2.
4225760	4230520	Okay, so at the risk of sounding like a complete moron, can someone explain to me how the trading
4230520	4234560	card thing works because it's not based on achievements.
4234560	4237560	It's based on time playing the game.
4237560	4242440	So I think it might be on achievements, I think it's just based on time playing the
4242440	4243440	game.
4243440	4244440	You get so many.
4244440	4245440	I noticed I have a Steam level now too.
4245440	4248200	So you get XP and I think some of that's from the trading cards, right?
4248200	4251520	But I got a lot from participating in old sales and things like that.
4251520	4254280	Which by the way, July 4th is next week.
4254280	4255280	You know what that means.
4255280	4256600	Barbecue at my house.
4256600	4257600	Well, that and...
4257600	4258600	Hide your wallets.
4258600	4259600	Hide your wallets.
4259680	4260680	Hide your wife.
4260680	4261680	Hide your kids.
4261680	4263880	Because Steam sales is gonna happen.
4263880	4265200	I ain't got cash for that shit.
4265200	4266960	And they're slashing all the prices on up here.
4266960	4267960	See, here's the thing though.
4267960	4269400	I've already bought so much stuff.
4269400	4272880	I don't really know if there's much more I need.
4272880	4275440	All I need is that Civ 5 expansion.
4275440	4276880	That's all I need.
4276880	4277880	Everything else...
4277880	4278880	No, Rob.
4278880	4279880	You want it.
4279880	4280880	You need air.
4280880	4281880	No.
4281880	4282880	I fucking need it.
4282880	4283880	The new expansion?
4283880	4284880	Which expansion?
4284880	4285880	Will you die without it?
4285880	4289160	Yeah, you need me to get it because otherwise you will not want to be on this program with
4289720	4290720	Oh, we'll have Grumpy Dick Rob.
4290720	4293560	Are you talking about the new expansion coming out in July or the one that's...
4293560	4294560	The one that's like a couple weeks.
4294560	4296120	You know July is tomorrow, right?
4296120	4300560	I understand that, but you're talking about the one that's coming out in Brave New World.
4300560	4303480	It's not gonna be on the Steam sale, but it's something on Steam I need to get.
4303480	4304480	Yeah, Brave New World.
4304480	4308400	I don't remember if that's next week or if that's gonna be the week after next.
4308400	4310400	I think it's the 8th.
4310400	4313200	I think they're releasing it just in time for my boyfriend's birthday.
4313200	4317200	I think there's like all of two games on Steam right now I'm interested in.
4317240	4319240	One of them is that what Miami...
4319240	4320240	God, I can't ever...
4320240	4321240	Hotline Miami.
4321240	4322240	Hotline Miami.
4322240	4326640	Because I want to go around shooting people in bloody messes with weird synth music.
4326640	4328640	Should have gotten in on that with the Humble Bundle man.
4328640	4329640	I know.
4329640	4330640	Good prices there.
4330640	4332640	But I have bills.
4332640	4334640	Oh, bills.
4334640	4335640	All right.
4335640	4336640	Let's see.
4336640	4339640	I just had to do something like go to Alabama.
4339640	4340640	All right.
4340640	4341640	One more story for you guys here.
4341640	4344120	And this is a follow up to something we had talked about before.
4344120	4349480	Apparently Nintendo may have been easing up a bit on the whole Let's Play video thing.
4349480	4354160	Remember that they were really unpopular for a week there because they didn't shut down
4354160	4358960	Let's Play videos, but they're like, we're gonna take the money and use it for us if
4358960	4362440	you have a Let's Play video that features our newer games.
4362440	4369840	Well, a popular YouTuber who goes by Zach Scott at Zach Scott Games on YouTube apparently
4369840	4374280	was in an interview with a gaming website where he has returned to making Let's Play
4374280	4382040	videos because he heard that high profile Nintendo games were apparently no longer being
4382040	4383040	pulled by Nintendo.
4383040	4384040	Thank you.
4384040	4386120	Will you launch?
4386120	4387280	You think that's part of it?
4387280	4389280	No, no, no.
4389280	4393480	Since you mentioned analytics and stuff like that and getting paid on stuff, I just happened
4393480	4394960	to check my...
4394960	4397420	Well, here's the timing on this.
4397580	4402620	It's part of the revenue reports because on May 14th, his ad earnings ceased, but then
4402620	4405300	they started again on May 23rd.
4405300	4409500	So he made a leap of faith since he saw the revenue return and no other claims have been
4409500	4411100	made on his videos since.
4411100	4413500	So Nintendo may have given up as fast as they implemented it.
4413500	4416100	I mean, that's what, two weeks, if even?
4416100	4419940	You know, when we talked about this on Game Buoy, this kind of was an unpopular opinion
4419940	4426340	actually, but I just didn't really understand people actually making a living off of Let's
4426340	4427340	Plays.
4427340	4428340	It happens.
4428340	4432020	If it works for you, I guess more power to you, but you know.
4432020	4437460	Well, as I mentioned before, because I started monetizing some of my YouTube videos, just
4437460	4444980	honestly, I wasn't making anything off of them until now, but I only have one video
4444980	4451460	that has just about 8,000, 9,000 views on it and 36 bucks right there from just that.
4451460	4455200	So if you make a lot of videos and you're consistent about it and a lot of those Let's
4455200	4458880	Play videos get a lot more than just 8,000 views.
4458880	4465400	So you can make quite a bit of money, you know, and you probably in the wrong fucking
4465400	4466400	business.
4466400	4467400	This is the last episode.
4467400	4471400	Oh, LR, everybody was wonderful these last 11 years, but we're moving to YouTube next
4471400	4475500	week in our little five minute chunk segments, which will just be Loki and I arguing in dark
4475500	4476500	soccer crying.
4476500	4480760	Well, no, no, no, Dan and I were actually talking about doing this with our turbo graphics
4480760	4481760	games.
4481760	4482760	So it'd be fun.
4482760	4484080	So yeah, there's money that you made.
4484080	4488120	I mean, I'm not looking to make a living off of, you know, putting YouTube videos out
4488120	4494800	there, but 36, $36 I didn't have before 36 bucks to buy another.
4494800	4495800	That's half.
4495800	4498720	That's about halfway to the Earth Defense Force for.
4498720	4499720	There you go.
4499720	4500720	Absolutely.
4500720	4501720	Wow.
4501720	4504520	Well, you know, and I'm, I'm kind of actually slight kick.
4504520	4508880	I know you said that it was an unpopular opinion, but I, I think we talked about this on the
4508880	4509880	show originally.
4509880	4512520	I actually kind of voiced a very similar thing where I'm like, really, you, you can make
4512520	4513520	a living off this.
4513960	4518640	I mean, it's not, I mean, no shade to those that do very well with let's play videos.
4518640	4519800	I have a respect it.
4519800	4521080	It takes work to do this podcast.
4521080	4525040	It takes a lot of work to do is let's play videos, but you have to admit you do owe some
4525040	4528600	of the success to the game that you are featuring.
4528600	4529600	You know what I mean?
4529600	4530600	Yeah.
4530600	4533280	So if they want to come in and get a cut, but I think Nintendo just kind of did a Dick
4533280	4535160	move by cutting it all off.
4535160	4536160	You know what I mean?
4536160	4540200	Like there should have been some type of sharing, you know, the let's play content gets something,
4540200	4544080	Nintendo gets a little something, something too, or, you know, they get their own commercials
4544080	4547520	in there, you know, things like that, you know, but yeah, they, they need to take a
4547520	4551320	smaller cut, you know, like circumcision, not Lorena Bobbitt.
4551320	4556000	That is a great analogy.
4556000	4557000	Dude.
4557000	4559280	Oh, thanks.
4559280	4560280	I don't want your hands.
4560280	4562000	Don't fist bump him for that.
4562000	4563000	You know, I did.
4563000	4568440	I just, I didn't high five him because I don't, I hope you get the blister thing.
4568440	4571600	It's not here, Rob.
4571600	4580200	You can't get it from touching my hands.
4580200	4582160	Clearly you're not afraid of germs.
4582160	4583360	She starts handling my feces.
4583360	4589120	I can't make any promises.
4589120	4590120	Do you have a diaper fetish?
4590120	4591120	Loki?
4591120	4592120	No, I do not.
4592120	4593120	Oh, that's good.
4593120	4594120	That's good.
4594120	4595120	I thought that was just your dinner.
4595120	4596120	That smelled.
4596800	4602200	For the record, if you would pay attention, the more you expose yourself to germs, the
4602200	4603840	stronger your immune system gets.
4603840	4604840	It's very good chance.
4604840	4608400	If you were a kid that like went to preschool or something like that, you probably already
4608400	4611320	have had this and you probably, you won't catch it again.
4611320	4615000	So yeah, when you, there's like, for the most part, when kids have this, they don't even
4615000	4616520	develop the blisters.
4616520	4618240	They'll run a fever and have a sore throat.
4618240	4619240	Yeah.
4619240	4622460	Um, shadow next gen says, YouTube also has a policy where you can't monetize videos for
4622460	4624100	content you don't own.
4624100	4627880	So this whole thing is a bit confusing to me as to how it was allowed to happen in the
4627880	4628880	first place.
4628880	4634180	That's a comment from live.vognetwork.com and clerical error 404 follows this up with,
4634180	4637540	it's been about 15 years since I heard a Lorena Bobbitt reference.
4637540	4638540	You're welcome.
4638540	4642020	Keeping it, keeping it classy and old school here at OLR.
4642020	4643420	That's way too long.
4643420	4645180	Well, here's the thing.
4645180	4650700	I think that the whole YouTube policy originally was just to prevent people from, okay, some
4650700	4656500	dude makes a video and then I copy said video, put it up on my channel and monetize it.
4656500	4661900	Here's me humming along to, uh, this new movie that's out in theaters.
4661900	4672900	Um, uh, man of steel, uh, in me and it's my, my little, you know, that would be very bad.
4672900	4680380	I think, but anyway, I paid good money for this hue card and I own all the data on it.
4681380	4686700	I paid an entire $5 from the garage sale for this hue card.
4686700	4687700	I own it.
4687700	4688700	All right.
4688700	4690900	Dark soccer is clearly stepping into a time portal over there.
4690900	4691900	So you know what that means?
4691900	4696540	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4696540	4701180	Every week, dark soccer goes into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, Hey,
4701180	4708220	you kids and your YouTubing and making careers off of Mario, you, you know what you need
4708220	4709820	to go back to my day.
4710260	4715260	We used to pay $400 for a fricking Neo Geo game and we liked it.
4715260	4717940	And really weird games were really cool.
4717940	4718940	Yeah.
4718940	4720420	Well really weird games are kind of still cool.
4720420	4721420	Let's be real.
4721420	4722420	All right.
4722420	4723420	But this one was weird.
4723420	4724420	This one was weird and it's not Neo Geo.
4724420	4725420	It's a little newer than that.
4725420	4726420	Dark soccer.
4726420	4727420	What is the classic game of the week?
4727420	4729620	The classic game of the week is Mr. Mosquito.
4729620	4730620	It's weird.
4730620	4735180	I figured to go for a PS2 era, you know, finally moving up a little bit.
4735180	4738740	Mr. Mosquito was, it's Rina's room again.
4738740	4739740	Oops.
4739740	4740740	You need to skip up slides.
4740740	4741740	Go ahead.
4741740	4742740	Oh, okay.
4742740	4748100	Mr. Mosquito, which was actually spelled M-O-S-K-E-E-T-O in the PAL regions.
4748100	4755020	It also is known as KA in Japan, which just means mosquito, was put out by, well developed
4755020	4757780	by Zoom Inc for the PS2.
4757780	4763740	And it was released in Japan on June 21st, 2001 and the following March in everywhere
4763740	4764740	else.
4764740	4768100	And it was distributed by Eidos.
4768100	4776020	Basically, you play as a mosquito who has taken a residence in the Yamada family's house.
4776020	4783140	And it's, I wonder if they were voiced by the Japanese voice actors because the accents
4783140	4784140	are really thick.
4784140	4786820	I mean, they're legit accents too.
4786820	4793220	So anyway, you have to stock up on enough blood in the summer so that you will survive
4793220	4795860	through the winter ahead, which is funny because like don't mosquitoes only live for
4795860	4797500	like a week.
4797500	4804620	Anyway, so you have, you can collect these spheres to save extra blood and you have to
4804620	4809220	suck the blood from them while they're going about their everyday business, but you can
4809220	4812420	only get it from certain body parts at certain times.
4812420	4817580	Like this scene here with the girl on her bed, you can only suck it from like her upper
4817580	4818580	thigh.
4818580	4820420	He's getting a little close to the no-no spot.
4820420	4823460	So this is a little bit of a scandalous game.
4823460	4826860	He's actually close to the femoral artery.
4826860	4833220	Anyway, if he is swatted while sucking, then instant death occurs.
4833220	4839620	Basically, you have a stress meter, so you have to balance your suck with your stress.
4839620	4841940	Don't we all?
4841940	4847340	And then to calm them, basically they will try to battle you too, like a big boss battle,
4847340	4852220	like what we're watching right now in this video, where you have stress points that you
4852220	4859100	have to, I guess, sting them on or bite them on that are meant to calm them.
4859100	4864140	So it's like you're doing acupressure on them.
4864140	4865700	You're doing mosquito shiatsu.
4865700	4867340	There you go.
4867340	4869340	You can get smacked all over the room and it's really hilarious.
4869340	4870900	So you have different stages.
4870900	4876220	You can go through different parts of the house and you have different items, different
4876260	4879100	things to help you.
4879100	4887060	The fun thing about this game too is that your ending depends on how much sucking you did,
4887060	4892380	like how successful you were, because for the Yamada family, they're going to have their
4892380	4895220	family portrait taken at the end of the summer.
4895220	4900020	And it's like if you completed all the missions and everything, they're all puffed up and
4900020	4903020	swollen all over their faces and the picture is horrible.
4903020	4904740	And it's really funny.
4904740	4909140	The voice acting is actually super hilarious too.
4909140	4914220	As for the game, it was voted one of the top 10 weirdest games of all time in 2008 by Game
4914220	4923940	Informer and G4 put it on its list of weird games.
4923940	4929300	It was really weird, but Famitsu said it was the fifth best selling video game in Japan
4929300	4931100	during its release.
4931100	4939660	It sold 41,006 copies and it also got a release on PlayStation 2 the best.
4939660	4945740	And it led to a sequel in Japan on July 3rd, 2003 called KA 2 Let's Go Hawaii.
4945740	4949900	And that came out only, of course, like I said, in Japan and it's the Yamada family
4949900	4953540	again and they're going on vacation, has like new stuff going on.
4953540	4958780	I kind of want the sequel just because it like has extra stuff going on and you can
4958780	4960940	suck anywhere on them.
4960940	4964300	And a different relaxation system, so I think it would be fun.
4964300	4967140	But this game was just wrong and like you could do other stuff too.
4967140	4970620	Like you could distract the people in the room by like turning off the light switch
4970620	4973260	or changing the music or doing all this other stuff.
4973260	4975500	It's just bizarre, but it works.
4975500	4978940	It's a very strange game, but it's awesome.
4978940	4981420	Like it's you just you have to see it.
4981420	4985020	And like this week I wanted to pick games that were along the same vein of Incredible
4985020	4987660	Crisis because that game was fucked up.
4987660	4992580	And this game, I'd have to put it's fucked up in this level somewhere near Incredible
4992580	4993580	Crisis.
4993580	4994580	So.
4994580	4995580	All right.
4995580	4996580	KA.
4996580	4997580	There it is.
4997580	4998580	Your classic game of the week.
4998580	5000460	Mr. Mosquito on the PlayStation 2.
5000460	5001460	KA.
5001460	5002780	All right.
5002780	5004160	Very good pick tonight.
5004160	5005160	A little bit edumacational.
5005160	5006160	I know.
5006160	5007160	All right.
5007160	5008160	Don't go anywhere, guys.
5008160	5010940	We've got plenty more OLR to come tonight with more Slidekick.
5010940	5013140	The Frugal Question of the Week coming at you.
5013140	5016060	We're going to talk a little bit about Ouya and the Frugal Question of the Week as well
5016060	5017420	as some news.
5017420	5021260	And also we'll talk about the upcoming Moli Jam.
5021260	5022260	That's always hilarious.
5022260	5024380	So we're going to talk about that.
5024380	5027740	All that and more including your phone calls, the FUs of the Week, Twitter topics and all
5027740	5031540	that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
5031540	5032540	Hola.
5032540	5039140	This is your friendly neighborhood Mexican actor.
5039140	5050780	And you're participating with Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.
5050780	5054540	And I want to use my voice to tell you that Kirby does not suck.
5054540	5059740	Well, literally he does suck, but not fear of the people.
5059740	5062780	Anyways, play more Kirby.
5062780	5063780	Play more Kirby.
5063780	5064780	Do it now.
5064780	5065780	Well, not now.
5065780	5066780	Because you're trying to listen to OLR, but.
5066780	5067780	Poor guy, man.
5067780	5076540	I know we're here pitching.
5076540	5077540	That's like tomorrow, though.
5077540	5078540	By the way.
5078540	5080540	I did look up Phoenix.
5080540	5083540	Phoenix is at one hundred and sixteen.
5083540	5084540	On fire.
5084540	5085860	What about needles in Death Valley?
5085860	5091300	That's always the place to look at just like a hundred and twenty two.
5091300	5093620	Anyhow, that was a repeat bumper there.
5093620	5094980	That means we need more bumpers.
5094980	5098960	I mean, I'm sure Act Deft is happy to have his voice played on the show all the time,
5098960	5101380	as well as some of our other repeats we'll get into.
5101380	5106100	But Orange Lounge Radio, the place where Act Deft has a voice.
5106100	5110180	If you want to get your voice heard, go over to our forums at Vogue Network dot com, click
5110180	5112220	on forums and check out the Orange Lounge Radio forum.
5112220	5114460	The call for bumpers is there.
5114460	5115460	And it's very easy.
5115460	5118180	You can even Skype them in if you don't know it, like don't you don't have to put the music
5118180	5119180	together or anything like that.
5119180	5121820	All you got to do is give me give me your voice.
5121820	5123540	I'm like Ursula on The Little Mermaid.
5123540	5124700	That's all I want is your voice.
5124700	5126260	And Rob's going to put it to Eurobeat.
5126260	5127260	That's right.
5127260	5128980	I may put the next one to Eurobeat.
5128980	5129980	Be careful.
5129980	5130980	All right.
5130980	5131980	That would be awesome.
5131980	5136860	So before we get back into gaming news and rapid fire news, Slidekick, I realize there
5136860	5140460	was one game neither one of us brought up in our gaming weeks this week.
5140460	5143460	But before the show tonight, we played Press Your Luck.
5143460	5144460	We did.
5144460	5145460	We did.
5145460	5150220	And you sure love to rub it in how good a game show video games you are, huh?
5150220	5152940	I guess I just have a natural talent.
5152980	5155060	Do you practice Wheel of Fortune a lot as a kid?
5155060	5156060	No.
5156060	5157980	Well, I played a lot of Wheel of Fortune as a kid, but I mean.
5157980	5158980	Five thousand pass.
5158980	5161220	We've had a Wheel of Fortune winner on the show.
5161220	5162220	Yes, I know.
5162220	5163220	Yes.
5163220	5165140	I kind of think I need to actually go on Wheel of Fortune.
5165140	5169020	Our buddy Mel, who needs to come back to the show, by the way, actually won a car on Wheel
5169020	5170020	of Fortune like years.
5170020	5171020	It was during.
5171020	5172020	Wow.
5172020	5173020	His price is right.
5173020	5174020	No, it was on Wheel of Fortune.
5174020	5175020	It was on Wheel of Fortune.
5175020	5176020	Because he even put up the clip of him winning.
5176020	5177020	Yeah.
5177020	5181180	His Facebook cover photo is him solving the pumpkin pie or whatever his final thing was.
5181180	5184300	And I have been in that Camaro and it was a bitchin' Camaro.
5184300	5186860	I have a coworker that won a car on Price is Right.
5186860	5187860	Really?
5187860	5188860	Yeah.
5188860	5189860	He won the car and like a China cabinet.
5189860	5190860	Lord.
5190860	5193420	And the sucky thing they never tell you about winning prizes like that is that you have
5193420	5194420	to pay taxes.
5194420	5195940	All these game show winners.
5195940	5198420	Oh, Alan's here to lend his commentary.
5198420	5199740	Yes, Alan.
5199740	5201620	Talking about Price is Right, just remind me of something.
5201620	5203980	There's going to be an all Plinko episode in September.
5203980	5204980	What?
5204980	5205980	Yeah.
5205980	5206980	All Plinko.
5206980	5207980	August or September.
5207980	5208980	Google it.
5208980	5209980	If I'm working, I'm just going to quit and watch.
5210980	5211980	Viewing party.
5211980	5212980	Kidding.
5212980	5213980	Kidding.
5213980	5217540	I've never heard of a better reason to quit your job.
5217540	5221860	And you get Plinko and you get Plinko and you get Plinko for everyone.
5221860	5225740	I'm surprised it's taken them 35 years or something to think about Plinko.
5225740	5226740	If they want.
5226740	5233340	See, PopCap telling you if you're smart, you market that son of a bitch on that show right
5233340	5234340	there.
5234340	5235340	Right?
5235340	5236340	Pagle 2.
5236340	5237340	Plinko.
5237340	5239340	Robby, we're getting a little pressed during Press Your Luck, weren't you?
5239700	5242060	Well, I was getting very pressed during Press Your Luck.
5242060	5243060	How many whammies did you have?
5243060	5248540	I had three whammies in the first round and fucking, okay, so like I actually uploaded
5248540	5252860	to my Twitter, twitter.com slash SKIE, that's Sky, twitter.com slash Sky.
5252860	5257860	I've always liked more followers, but I actually posted a picture of this like slidekick.
5257860	5262060	I hate you so much because like it's me and I have three whammies and no money and he
5262060	5263060	has like no whammies.
5263060	5264060	He has like $7,000.
5264060	5267140	And I ended up with like over $50,000.
5267140	5270860	Were you like the unemployed man who memorized the patterns and just sat and watched it?
5270860	5271860	Yes, he was.
5271860	5272860	No, I just got lucky.
5272860	5273860	You know what happened to that guy, by the way?
5273860	5274860	He died.
5274860	5275860	No, besides that.
5275860	5276860	What?
5276860	5278940	He ended up in, he went on all the trips and everything and ended up investing the money
5278940	5282940	in like the scheme and he lost all of it.
5282940	5283940	Oh, poor guy.
5283940	5286740	If you come into money, be smart.
5286740	5288900	You know, you can have one of my two trips to Rio, Rob.
5288900	5289900	It's okay.
5289900	5290900	Shut up.
5290900	5291900	It wasn't real.
5291900	5295060	It wasn't real as the lengthy disclaimer when you boot up the game lets you know that the
5295060	5296300	prizes are not real.
5296300	5298140	It's not a contest.
5298140	5302820	If I can make money winning game show video games, I just quit my job and do that in a
5302820	5303820	let's plays.
5303820	5305940	You know what would be the best job ever?
5305940	5306940	You should be a sweeper.
5306940	5311180	You'd be one of those soccer moms that does nothing but enter sweepstakes for a living.
5311180	5312180	Oh, it's my dream.
5312180	5313180	Basically.
5313180	5314180	I'm kind of surprised.
5314180	5315180	Alan's really into couponing.
5315180	5317540	Alan, why aren't you into sweeping?
5317540	5320580	That should be your next hobby.
5320580	5321580	It says I'm not a 1950.
5321740	5324740	We can get you a string of pearls and an apron.
5324740	5325740	Okay.
5325740	5326740	That's a little bit awkward.
5326740	5327740	All right.
5327740	5328740	What were you going to say?
5328740	5329740	They're sorry.
5329740	5330740	I forgot.
5330740	5331740	Really cut you off.
5331740	5332740	I forgot.
5332740	5333740	It's for the best.
5333740	5334740	All right.
5334740	5335740	No whammies.
5335740	5336740	Stop.
5336740	5341660	Uh, dark Tetsuya says, I was just going to ask, are the patterns in the video game version
5341660	5342860	like the old game show?
5342860	5343860	No.
5343860	5344860	And they're a lot more randomized.
5344860	5345860	I highly doubt.
5345860	5347440	Slidekick had the time to memorize them.
5347440	5351100	It's if you hit X as fast as you can, you seem to never hit a whammy and slidekick figure
5351100	5352780	that out in about five seconds.
5352780	5359940	Well, one thing, one thing to is that after this guy basically broke the system, earning
5359940	5364180	all that money, um, they changed the patterns and added an extra randomizer.
5364180	5366060	So, Oh yeah.
5366060	5367340	He made them change the game show.
5367340	5368340	Yeah.
5368340	5373880	And basically they couldn't actually call him out on cheating because he did what anyone
5373880	5374880	could do.
5374880	5375880	Yeah, no, he didn't cheat.
5375880	5379020	They just told him he's not allowed to play again.
5379940	5381980	Uh, I w I, it's not my fault.
5381980	5384820	Slidekick was just pushing X as fast as he could and winning everything, but I was trying
5384820	5385820	to get all into it.
5385820	5387380	I was like, no whammies.
5387380	5390220	Don't you fucking give me a whammy because you know, I can swear in my own house.
5390220	5392660	Don't you fucking give me a whammy or I'm going to come back there and cut the power
5392660	5393660	cord.
5393660	5394660	You piece of shit.
5394660	5395660	No whammies.
5395660	5396660	Stop.
5396660	5397660	And then I did a whammy.
5397660	5399980	I'm going to take all your money.
5399980	5403880	At least it was 80s style pressure luck and not that shitty game show.
5403880	5406620	Like an uncensored game show on TV.
5406620	5410460	Not necessarily that they have to have all the TNA and stuff, but like I'm just saying,
5410460	5413300	you know, we're just like, fuck, God damn it.
5413300	5415960	You know, why did I say that?
5415960	5417780	That's like the wrong answer completely.
5417780	5420020	You know, this is motherfucking jeopardy.
5420020	5425340	And then you can also get like bonus points based on how well you're judged.
5425340	5430260	We're all the, we're all the, uh, trivia answers have to start with what the fuck, what the
5430260	5433740	fuck is, I don't care, Alex.
5433740	5435360	That makes me think of the price is right.
5435360	5439580	Where you, you're the really hard ones where you have to step on the floor to step out
5439580	5440580	the price of the car.
5440580	5443940	They always looked at their family members and they can just be like, I fucking hate
5443940	5444940	my family.
5444940	5445940	You're all fucking walking home.
5445940	5446940	Fuck you.
5446940	5448620	And like Drew Carey's all really uncomfortable.
5448620	5450500	Oh God.
5450500	5452620	All right.
5452620	5455140	Uh, moving on.
5455140	5456540	We're talking too long about game shows.
5456540	5457540	Actually.
5457540	5458540	You can never talk too long about game shows.
5458540	5459540	Okay.
5459540	5462420	Is that the pressure like game that I got you like ages ago?
5462420	5463420	The DVD game.
5463420	5464420	We'll have that.
5464420	5469180	Uh, I was going to say, I've talked about before how badly I need to go on a reality
5469180	5474820	game show and I don't think I could do survivor because if I didn't eat for 13 days, I would
5474820	5475940	be the biggest bitch.
5475940	5477260	I get voted out so fast.
5477260	5479540	If I didn't eat for one day, I'd be a bitch.
5479540	5480540	Let's be real.
5480540	5481900	I can't go on big brother.
5481900	5484380	No, you would be a big bitch if you didn't have Pinkberry near you.
5484380	5487700	I can't go on big brother anymore because I don't know if y'all are following this season,
5487700	5489380	but what a bunch of racists.
5489380	5492100	I mean, it's pretty sick in that house right now.
5492300	5496100	Paula Deen ain't got nothing on some of those people in the big brother house this season.
5496100	5502300	Uh, and then, um, so I was going to say there's a new show on ABC that's pretty fucking hilarious.
5502300	5507940	It's called who done it and it's like, it's like clue meets the mole, which by the way,
5507940	5510940	I know a lot of you judge reality TV shows and that's fine.
5510940	5516300	A lot of it needs to be judged, but the mole was the best reality game show they ever had.
5516300	5519340	I'm like, if you're going to try any reality TV, do the mole.
5519340	5522660	So somebody decided to adapt the mole into like a clue game called who done it.
5522660	5528300	But here's the great part is that at the end of the episode, whoever scored the lowest
5528300	5531100	on the quiz dies.
5531100	5533300	They become the victim in the next episode.
5533300	5536740	So the episode literally like the first episode aired, right?
5536740	5540860	And so the guy who lost and didn't get the case right and got the lowest on the quiz,
5540860	5544980	he runs out at the very end, somebody set him on fire and he falls into the pool dead
5544980	5548940	and he's all like, like it's, it's like, obviously it's all fake, it's makeup and all that stuff,
5548940	5552220	but all these people on Twitter were like, did they start killing people on TV?
5552220	5553220	What the fuck?
5553220	5554220	Ratings.
5554220	5555220	Oh my God.
5555220	5556220	Right.
5556220	5560440	But I was like, dude, he lost this game and he literally had to die in a fire.
5560440	5562260	That is amazing.
5562260	5563380	Like the dark soccer, right?
5563380	5567340	This game is the closest we're going to get to battle royale.
5567340	5569780	Happy hunger games.
5569780	5572660	They're supposed to be a hunger games game show on CW this year.
5572660	5578380	Yes, but it's not, it's not hunger games, but it's so fucking obviously a thirsty rip
5578380	5579580	off of the hunger games.
5579580	5582240	It's like, wait, let me your book.
5582240	5583240	What the hunger games?
5583240	5586540	It's on his Kindle.
5586540	5590060	This is why I hate Kindle shit.
5590060	5591060	All right.
5591060	5598540	There's a thing called the internet where it's probably there.
5598540	5601920	I like books where I can smell paper and ink.
5601920	5602920	What is the name?
5602920	5603920	And cry.
5603920	5605580	Somebody in chat has to know this show I'm talking about.
5605580	5606780	It's on the CW.
5606780	5611080	It's um, cause you know, the CW doesn't have anything except the whose line is it anyway?
5611080	5613620	Reboot starts on a couple of weeks.
5613620	5614620	Really soon.
5614620	5615620	I'll have to watch that.
5615620	5620820	And it has the lady who just Googled CW, a hunger game show.
5620820	5621820	It's called the hunt.
5621820	5622820	The hunt.
5622820	5626940	It's not the hunger games, the hunt.
5626940	5627940	It's just like it though.
5627940	5630320	I'll tell you the 10 years from now, battle royale.
5630320	5634960	The one I can't wait for on ABC is called the quest, which is supposed to be the amazing
5634960	5637320	race meets a LARP.
5637320	5638320	Oh my God.
5638320	5639320	That sounds awesome.
5639320	5640320	I would watch that one.
5640320	5642480	I was like, how do I get cast for this show?
5642480	5644800	Because I want to fuck, like I would want to fucking go on the quest.
5644800	5645800	It's like a LARP.
5645800	5646800	LARPers of the world unite.
5646800	5647800	It'd be amazing.
5647800	5649800	Anyway, it's like the producer.
5649800	5650800	I am.
5650800	5652440	I was a proud former LARPer.
5652440	5653440	It's the amazing.
5653440	5655760	Well, I did Rocky or a picture show, which is really close.
5655760	5656760	Okay.
5656760	5661080	It's, it's the amazing race producers and the Lord of the rings producers or something
5661080	5662080	like that.
5662080	5666240	It's when you go to a live action vampire game and you see the people actually rigged
5666240	5668840	up with the fake blood and everything, spraying it everywhere.
5668840	5669840	That's awesome.
5669840	5673160	I've seen the people throw the magic bags, the little bags that are supposed to be like,
5673160	5674160	I'm throwing.
5674160	5675160	I see you.
5675160	5678400	You can't see me.
5678400	5679400	Oh my God.
5679400	5680400	Oh my God.
5680400	5682720	We need to have an OL LARP.
5682720	5683720	No.
5683720	5687200	And for, for anyone who would pay money to charity, of course, a charity.
5687200	5690000	If we did an OL LARP, who would pay money?
5690000	5691000	I would.
5691000	5697040	For the record, what I did to Rob was I did the obfuscate thing, which is also stolen
5697040	5698040	by John Cena.
5698040	5702760	If you watch wrestling, wrestling reference, Bobby, ah, anyway, but he does the waving
5702760	5706080	his hand in his face and it's the, you can't see where I am type thing.
5706080	5710400	You know, Melody was just asking me how she could raise money for her team and training
5710400	5711920	thing that she's doing.
5711920	5714160	I will flarp OL LARP.
5714160	5715160	I love it.
5715160	5716160	Loki.
5716160	5717160	Are you going to do it?
5717160	5718160	Come on.
5718160	5719160	Sounds so ridiculous.
5719160	5724440	I'm so fucking excited.
5724440	5726720	All right, let's move on.
5726720	5727720	And Rob, what?
5727720	5729120	Here, here's the rule.
5729120	5730120	Okay.
5730120	5731120	Here's the rule.
5731120	5733520	We each pick a video game character and we have to cosplay.
5733520	5734520	Nope.
5734520	5735520	Nope.
5735520	5736520	Nope.
5736520	5737520	Nope.
5737520	5738520	You don't have to do tingling.
5738520	5739520	Nope.
5739520	5740520	You can do your sack boy.
5740520	5741520	You should walk around and sass sack boy.
5741520	5742520	Yeah.
5742520	5743520	Yeah.
5743520	5748400	We have to, we have to go out to Vacaville in the nut tree.
5748800	5751800	Play in the 112 degree.
5751800	5757040	No, for the, for the, for anyone who doesn't know he's on the ground, he's not moving behind
5757040	5760680	the nut tree is where the old Ren fairgrounds used to be.
5760680	5761680	That would be perfect.
5761680	5765620	You know where we used to do LARP, Rob, we used to do it in the courtyard at my college
5765620	5767800	of the university of South Alabama.
5767800	5771040	And because that's the only thing there is to do that's exciting in Alabama, it's still
5771040	5772040	going on.
5772040	5773040	Probably.
5773040	5775860	Act Def wants to know what does the F in flarp stand for?
5775860	5777820	You only know if you, if you like homestuck.
5777820	5779180	Oh God.
5779180	5780900	All right.
5780900	5783740	And of course, Raginator says, uh, Loki should LARP is tingle.
5783740	5784740	All right.
5784740	5785740	He won't.
5785740	5786740	All right.
5786740	5787740	Let's do some rapid fire news.
5787740	5791220	Cause we're 12 minutes into part B and haven't even touched rapid fire news yet.
5791220	5792220	They would slide kick.
5792220	5793220	This is all your fault.
5793220	5797420	It would be potentially cooler though than wearing that sack boy costume because that
5797420	5803100	day is like two or three layers of sweats in the summer.
5803100	5804100	Yeah.
5804620	5805620	That'll be fun.
5805620	5806620	All right.
5806620	5811620	Anyways, so Nordic games, you know, they've been acquiring and acquiring and acquiring,
5811620	5816220	you know, they bought up a bunch of the old THQ properties and now they're buying up some
5816220	5821860	of Atari's properties, including, uh, Desperados and silver.
5821860	5828140	Um, and you may remember Atari, you know, they've been selling off parts of their company.
5828140	5830540	So I wonder who's buying Marvin Mettis, seriously.
5830540	5837140	Um, and I guess they, um, I'm not sure what they're going to do with it, but you know,
5837140	5839500	make some Westerns, I guess.
5839500	5845420	I don't know, uh, silver I've not really, I'm not familiar with, but I guess that came
5845420	5851100	out, uh, was a action RPG in, uh, on the PC and Dreamcast back in 99.
5851100	5854060	So huh, interesting.
5854060	5859940	Um, Retro City Rampage, the PC version has been adding some new updates, including a
5860180	5862260	mod support, which is pretty sweet.
5862260	5867060	You can create your own vehicles and characters, fonts, color palettes, et cetera.
5867060	5873380	Uh, they have a new retro plus mode, which, uh, adds some more, um, you know, visual effects,
5873380	5878820	including soft shadows and doubling the number of colors on screen.
5878820	5885820	And um, also, I guess, uh, this is going to be coming, uh, on steam via automatic update
5885860	5890860	and then on good old games, uh, you have to log in and just redownload, I guess, grab
5890860	5892540	the 1.11 update.
5892540	5894920	Uh, so yeah, pretty cool.
5894920	5899460	And if you don't have this game already, it's most likely going to be on sale pretty soon.
5899460	5905620	I mean, it's already pretty treat, or pretty cheap, uh, 374, uh, was the recent cost of
5905620	5905740	that.
5905740	5909540	So it's probably going to be even cheaper during the steam sale, but it's an awesome
5909540	5909900	game.
5909900	5914160	So many like retro homages, it's just ridiculous.
5914160	5920280	And then last but not least, uh, Project Anarchy, a brand new, uh, mobile development
5920280	5922920	toolkit from Havok.
5922920	5925060	And uh, did I mention it's free?
5925060	5929760	So you'll be able to use it to create some pretty awesome 3D games and freely publish
5929760	5936760	on Android, iOS, uh, Tizen, I'm not sure what Tizen is, but, um, and I guess it also has
5938020	5942080	a provisional license to develop for, but not publish on Windows.
5942720	5943640	Okay.
5943640	5950240	Um, yeah, and I guess it will support, uh, I guess, uh, low level C++ access, Lua, Lua
5950240	5955320	scripting, debugging, and, uh, other fun stuff includes tutorials and sample projects as
5955320	5956360	well.
5956360	5961680	So, uh, if you want to check that out, um, I would imagine you just go to Havok's website
5961680	5962200	and it should be there.
5962200	5963480	What the hell is Tizen though?
5963480	5965880	I've never heard of Tizen.
5966040	5975040	It's like a operating system for some smartphones, tablets, and vehicle infotainment, smart TVs.
5975280	5978240	Something else to build a console out of.
5978240	5979440	I guess, yeah.
5979440	5983820	All right, well, uh, the potentials of this could have been Epic, but, uh, it was unearthed
5983820	5988400	an old ad from the Consumer Electronics Show from years ago, uh, was unearthed that showed
5988400	5992760	a advertisement for Square, you know, before they were Square Enix, uh, promoting upcoming
5992760	5996120	Final Fantasy games, which included Final Fantasy II.
5996120	5999320	Now I'm not, I'm not talking about the Super Nintendo, I'm talking about the Japanese Final
5999320	5999920	Fantasy II.
5999920	6002600	I'm going to refer to their Japanese numbers in this whole story.
6002600	6005880	Uh, Final Fantasy II was supposedly going to come out here at one point, but we all
6005880	6006680	knew that.
6006680	6010800	One of those big, like, Lost Levels website or whatever kind of chronicles what happened
6010800	6012680	with that game and it didn't come out.
6012680	6014200	But a lot of people didn't know this.
6014200	6018680	Final Fantasy III was apparently planned at one point, but it clearly didn't get very
6018680	6019760	far along.
6019760	6025280	There's even some mock-up box art that shows, um, uh, like the neptodragon possibly there,
6025280	6028080	some sea monsters clutching wood on a broken ship.
6028080	6031760	Now obviously we did end up getting Final Fantasy II and III years later.
6031760	6036720	Uh, Final Fantasy II came in the, um, Origins thing that was on PlayStation.
6036720	6039560	And Final Fantasy III I don't think could tell the DS game, right?
6039560	6041160	I don't think we got it before then.
6041160	6047360	So, uh, obviously there were translated ROMs and other types of hacks like that, but, uh,
6047360	6052600	it's, um, interesting to imagine what could have been with Final Fantasy II and III.
6052600	6054840	Let's be real, it would have been too hard.
6054840	6058800	Uh, here's another game that doesn't make any sense, but it sure is a lot of fun.
6058800	6059800	Kingdom Hearts.
6059800	6061420	That's a hilarious face.
6061420	6065880	Kingdom Hearts HD, uh, news coming out that the graphics are actually built from the ground
6065880	6066880	up.
6066880	6070040	Uh, some of the original assets from the 11-year-old game were lost.
6070040	6074360	So the graphics for Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix were recreated from the ground up on
6074360	6076440	the PlayStation 3.
6076440	6080080	That's really cool because, uh, god, I can't wait to play this game all over again.
6080080	6081080	It's so pretty.
6081080	6082080	Yeah.
6082080	6083080	I'm just like so excited about this.
6083080	6084920	So very cool.
6084920	6088760	I'm less excited about this, but it's not going to stop me from getting the game.
6088760	6094080	Uh, Final Fantasy X and X-II HD Remaster, apparently GameStop could be getting some
6094080	6096520	type of limited edition exclusive or something.
6096520	6101320	Uh, there's a flyer out there that was dated June 26th that talked about a free limited
6101320	6104880	edition upgrade if you pre-ordered the HD thing.
6104880	6110720	Uh, however, this is saying this could have been an error on, uh, GameStop's part because
6110720	6115440	they apparently removed said mention and Square Enix has not said anything about it and it's
6115440	6117400	not on GameStop.com.
6117400	6119560	So don't freak y'all.
6119560	6125200	It must be rep- reparations for the whole, uh, Deus Ex issue.
6125200	6126600	Yeah, that's right.
6126600	6129080	That wasn't that long ago, all things considered, huh?
6129080	6131080	Uh, anyhow, also, this is cool.
6131080	6134840	Well, a lot of people don't even realize there was a Game Gear Mega Man game and it
6134840	6135840	was out there.
6135840	6137000	It had some different bosses too.
6137000	6138000	I don't recall.
6138000	6141480	Or was it some of the, the ones from three, it only had like four bosses in it.
6141480	6145400	There was a whole series of different, uh, portable Mega Man games.
6145400	6150640	Like there's the Wonder Swan one and, um, there was one other that I can't remember,
6150640	6152200	but there was the Game Gear one.
6152200	6156520	Well, rumor is that the Game Gear version is on its way to the Nintendo 3DS eShop.
6156520	6159640	So there's something you might want to get on your new 3DS Dark Sakura.
6159680	6164680	Uh, it was developed by Freestyle and published by US Gold in 1995.
6164680	6167880	It was parts of four and five, they say mashed together.
6167880	6173320	Uh, apparently, uh, these carts go for $40 on eBay, but I would imagine this will cost
6173320	6174640	what five bucks on the eShops.
6174640	6176120	That'll be kind of interesting.
6176120	6178640	Well, $40 isn't that much.
6178640	6179640	Right.
6179640	6184120	Especially for a collector's game right now, by the way, all six original NES Mega Man
6184120	6188120	games, if you didn't know on the 3DS eShop, I think most of them are on the Wii U as well
6188120	6189120	at this point.
6189600	6193800	So, uh, plenty of places to get your Mega Man fix, just, you know, no new games.
6193800	6196840	I'm still hoping for Rockman and Bass.
6196840	6197840	You never know.
6197840	6198840	That would be happy.
6198840	6199840	All right.
6199840	6200840	Uh, Dark Sakura.
6200840	6209360	Well, we do have, um, well, Xbox One, um, as far as headsets, they have to be wired
6209360	6211520	and they're going to be sold separately.
6211520	6214160	They're not going to be packed in.
6214160	6220120	And, uh, they're basically, uh, saying that, uh, the only thing that you're getting with
6220120	6224000	it is going to be the Kinect sensor and the microphone in there, but no actual heads up.
6224000	6226800	So trying to screw us out of more money, huh?
6226800	6227800	Yeah.
6227800	6231720	It was sort of like that though, at the launch with, uh, the Xbox 360, only the premium set
6231720	6233600	had a headset.
6233600	6239800	Oh, not, not every, they're, they're basically saying that you can still talk to people,
6239800	6240800	but you can't have a headset.
6240800	6245480	Honestly, I don't like the, you know, standard headsets because I wear headphones.
6245480	6249240	So you can't wear two sets of headphones at the same time.
6249240	6253760	Well, I've tried, but I actually have, that's how I do it on my headset.
6253760	6259120	I tape a headset that I ripped apart and I just have the boom part of the microphone
6259120	6263400	on there and I tape it to the side of my headphones.
6263400	6264800	It works just fine.
6264800	6267480	I guess I could use Kinect, but then I'd be yelling across the room.
6267480	6268480	So that would be fun.
6268480	6274480	Well, in other news, and this has to do with the Wii U, the Super Smash Brothers release
6274480	6277480	may actually lose some characters.
6277480	6280880	They're saying that they're working on getting as many characters in it as they can, but
6280880	6284540	they may not have the full intended roster, although they will have, of course, the Wii
6284540	6288560	Fit Trainer fighting you with yoga.
6288560	6289560	And I love her.
6289560	6294840	Well, it's just like, if I knew that I could punch somebody with the warrior pose and have
6294840	6297240	them go across the room, I'd be doing that more often.
6297500	6300760	It's one of those things I never realized how much I loved the idea until it was announced
6300760	6302360	and I'm like, she should have been a character.
6302360	6303360	I love the memes.
6303360	6305440	Have you seen this already cosplay?
6305440	6306440	Of the Wii Fit Trainer?
6306440	6307440	Of the Wii Fit Trainer.
6307440	6308440	That's amazing.
6308440	6312040	And then, of course, the villager and our Mega Man.
6312040	6319080	I almost wonder if we'll see something like, not really like a ultimate Marvel versus Capcom,
6319080	6322520	you know, but like a DLC.
6322520	6323800	Ultimate Smash.
6323800	6326360	Ultimate Smash with like new characters or something.
6326840	6329800	Well, what they're saying here is that, I mean, the other big reason they may have to
6329800	6333520	cut people is time constraints, so they won't be able to bring everyone back.
6333520	6339080	But I mean, then again, there was like, what, Solid Snake before and Sonic and some Fire
6339080	6340560	Emblem characters that no one cared about.
6340560	6341560	I'm sorry.
6341560	6343560	That Dan cared about.
6343560	6344840	A lot of people care about.
6344840	6349080	Some people will miss them, but yeah, I think some of those more like, like I bet Captain
6349080	6350080	Falcon will be in there.
6350080	6351920	It was fun to play with Roy and Marth.
6351920	6356320	Or no, Star Fox will be in there, but like his little buddy, Falco Lombardi won't be
6356320	6357320	there.
6357320	6361600	You know, it'll be the more secondary characters in some of those games, like Lucas from Earthbound.
6361600	6362600	You mean like the pallets?
6362600	6365520	I know people who would probably throw a fit if Lucas wasn't in there, though.
6365520	6367200	I'll throw a fit if Ness isn't there.
6367200	6370800	Well, you know what, people throw fits for any reason, so, because gamers hate everything.
6370800	6374800	They may just get rid of like the pallet swap characters, you know, the ones that are basically
6374800	6376640	the same move set and everything, but it's just a different model.
6376640	6379440	As long as Zelda still has the Sheik transformation, I'll be happy.
6379440	6380440	Oh, I'm sure.
6380440	6381440	That's a must.
6381440	6385040	But they need to give, they need to put Daisy in there and have her have the back of her
6385040	6386040	head eye laser.
6387040	6389200	You know about the eyeball in the back of her head, right?
6389200	6390200	I heard about that, yeah.
6390200	6394880	Okay, in the original Smash Brothers, if you look at the Daisy trophy, if you happen to
6394880	6400640	scroll in super close to the back of her head, there's an eyeball in the back of her head.
6400640	6404880	And so now it's like this thing that like, you know what Mugen is, right?
6404880	6407200	The fighting game creator.
6407200	6411640	So for people who put Daisy in Mugen, they actually gave her a back of her head eyeball
6411640	6412640	laser.
6413240	6416880	It's the big, grandiose eyeball.
6416880	6417880	And I think it's hilarious.
6417880	6421680	And people have like tried to see, oh, well, it's not there in Mario Kart.
6421680	6423120	It doesn't matter.
6423120	6425760	She has a great big eye on the back of her head, like a tumor.
6425760	6426820	That's why her hair is so big.
6426820	6428920	It's full of secrets and eyeballs.
6428920	6429920	It's full of secrets.
6429920	6434080	You know, I'm going to use that for anybody else that, especially when my hair frizzes
6434080	6435080	out into fro mode.
6435080	6437840	I'm just going to say it's full of secrets.
6437840	6438840	You can thank Mean Girls.
6438840	6439840	Okay.
6439840	6442260	Well, I haven't seen that.
6442260	6443260	She should.
6443260	6444260	What?
6444260	6445260	Doesn't it have Sarah Michelle Gellar in it?
6445260	6446260	No.
6446260	6448940	It's Lindsay Lohan before she was on all the drugs.
6448940	6449940	And Rachel McAdams.
6449940	6450940	Is that her name?
6450940	6453460	What was the one that had Sarah Michelle Gellar in it?
6453460	6454460	Buffy?
6454460	6455460	Buffy?
6455460	6456460	No, she was in another movie.
6456460	6457460	Cruel Intentions.
6457460	6458460	Cruel Intentions.
6458460	6459460	That was it.
6459460	6460860	Because that movie had a song that I liked, but I've never seen it either.
6460860	6461860	Yeah.
6461860	6465060	That's the one where you can see Sarah Michelle are going, but I want to fuck.
6465060	6467060	Okay.
6467060	6470060	Were you volunteering?
6470860	6473580	Sarah Michelle Gellar is an attractive lady.
6473580	6476460	If you're Freddie Prinze Jr. then yes.
6476460	6478420	So anyway, you know what though?
6478420	6481820	She does not look as attractive as she did on Buffy because she's all boned thin again
6481820	6485420	now and not, you know, in good shape.
6485420	6486420	So anyway, okay.
6486420	6490900	Former King of Fighters developers are having some issues.
6490900	6498540	They were basically, they have an original 2D fighting game that they were looking to
6498540	6500420	have some development on.
6500420	6507500	It says that right now, and the game is called Yatagarasu, that they want to have it crowdfunded
6507500	6511020	so that they can release the character in the game.
6511020	6514000	And they're wanting it to be 10 playable characters at launch.
6514000	6518460	They have a funding goal of $68,000 right now and it's on Indiegogo and it can go up
6518460	6521860	if it needs to be, so.
6521860	6527260	If it's not sucky like the King of Fighters 12 was, then go for it.
6527260	6528260	All right.
6528980	6532260	I'm a little opinionated when it comes to bad King of Fighters games, Rob.
6532260	6533260	Are you?
6533260	6534260	I would have never guessed.
6534260	6535260	You know what, hush.
6535260	6538100	I figured it was appropriate though, considering you just did a King of Fighters, or well,
6538100	6539100	sorta.
6539100	6540100	Sorta.
6540100	6541100	Fatal Fury.
6541100	6542100	King of Fighters prequel-ish.
6542100	6544060	Yeah, I'm going to do Art of Fighting next week, ooh.
6544060	6545060	Are you really?
6545060	6546060	No.
6546060	6547500	I'm going to do World Heroes Jet.
6547500	6557500	Well, you know what I'm going to do is the FUGL Question of the Week right now.
6557500	6561740	Make Facebook and Google Plus, slam them together and you get one clusterfuck of a
6561740	6562860	social networking site.
6562860	6567140	You also get the word FUGL, which we ask a question every week of our Facebook and Google
6567140	6570820	fan communities, and we read some of the answers here on the show.
6570820	6572060	I might read them all tonight.
6572060	6573060	We'll see how I'm feeling.
6573060	6574060	I haven't looked.
6574060	6575060	How many are on Facebook?
6575060	6576060	There's not a ton.
6576060	6578900	All right, I can probably get through them all tonight.
6578900	6580220	Here we go.
6580220	6583420	The Ouya officially hit shelves this week.
6583420	6584420	Did you get one?
6584420	6586020	Why or why not?
6586020	6589580	What do you think about these mobile platform consoles, especially considering there are
6589580	6594700	more to come, such as Mojo and the rumors of an official Google Android console?
6594700	6595700	And GameStick.
6595700	6596700	Oh, yeah.
6596700	6598500	Well, I said and more.
6598500	6599500	All right.
6599500	6603320	Retertainment says, unless the Ouya is something that will make it so it's not so damn fucking
6603320	6606500	hot outside, I will not be buying one right now.
6606500	6609780	Maybe I'll buy an Ouya in the future when the outside world is not trying to cook me
6609780	6610780	alive.
6610780	6611780	Well, to be fair...
6611780	6612780	That answer wins.
6612780	6613780	We're done.
6613780	6618060	Well, to be fair, one thing I do like about the Ouya controller is the face plates are
6618060	6621980	made of metal, and so they're nice and cool on your hands.
6621980	6624260	All right, fine.
6624260	6625580	We'll read other answers then.
6625580	6626580	All right.
6626580	6632620	So moving to Evel, like E3vL, no, unless I see more exclusive content for the system.
6632620	6637940	Also, the Ouya seems to have had bad customer service as of late, having shipped their console
6637940	6642300	to retailers before providing all their Kickstarter backers with one first.
6642300	6648300	At least provide the backers with some store credit or free games instead of just apologizing.
6648300	6650380	We'll get into that in a little bit.
6650380	6652380	We're definitely going to be getting into that in a little bit.
6652380	6653380	All right.
6653380	6656700	Nietzsche says, between the reports of horrible controller input lag and poor performance
6656700	6659700	due to outdated hardware, I have no desire to get the Ouya.
6659700	6663340	It was a fun idea, but in my opinion, didn't work out.
6663340	6668780	Travis H says, Asus transformer tablet plus HDMI cable equals an Ouya I can take on the
6668780	6669780	go.
6669780	6673380	Honestly, the only thing that I think that piqued my interest about the Ouya is having
6673380	6678060	a system to throw emulators on, kind of like an all-in-one super nostalgia machine.
6678060	6680540	But I already have that with my tablet, so I'm out.
6680540	6681540	Wow.
6681540	6683020	Lots of hate for the Ouya on Google Plus.
6683020	6684660	Let's see if Facebook's any different.
6684660	6688700	Galley 89 says, nope, I don't see the need one, not for me at least.
6688700	6692620	Daniel S says, everything I hear about the Ouya is that it's a piece of crap, and putting
6692620	6697060	more Android-based platforms is exactly what they need because market confusion and dilution
6697060	6698060	is great.
6698220	6700860	I think there's a slash sark in there.
6700860	6705500	Clover Nikon says, my wife and I enjoy playing games on our Google Nexus 7-inch Android jellybean
6705500	6706580	tablet.
6706580	6710380	My wife playing Simpsons tap game, I play Star Wars pinball, my father-in-law playing
6710380	6712940	those pokey magic slot machine games when he borrows it.
6712940	6716860	If a shop here near me sold the Ouya, I would definitely buy one.
6716860	6718060	Well, there you go.
6718060	6721420	Finally, an answer we can say is a positive one.
6721420	6728020	Degenerate Johnny says, it all seems oxymoronic to have a stationary platform for mobile games.
6728020	6732140	Honestly, I don't very much care for mobile games, 3DS and Vita excluded.
6732140	6735820	They don't offer the same amount of excitement and enjoyment that the big three consoles
6735820	6736820	offer.
6736820	6739980	Console developers, including Valve, should take a lesson from the auto industry, and
6739980	6744740	this is my Michigan side talking, there can be only three, and that's currently Nintendo,
6744740	6746260	Sony, and Microsoft.
6746260	6751340	Otherwise you are doomed to walk the unfortunate path of the 3DO, Jaguar, and God rest its
6751340	6752660	soul, the Dreamcast.
6752660	6753660	Aww.
6753660	6754660	Aww.
6754660	6755660	That answer made me sad.
6755660	6760740	Yeah, but the difference between the 3DO and the Jaguar and the Dreamcast is that the
6760740	6762740	Dreamcast wasn't shit.
6762740	6763740	Word.
6763740	6769100	Also, the 80s called and would like to tell you that there is room for more than three
6769100	6771220	consoles, although then again, it might lead to another crash.
6771220	6774500	We had the whole home computing wars, but that's another episode of the show.
6774500	6776340	Actually, we talked about that a lot last week.
6776340	6781740	All right, Clerical Error 404 left a pretty long answer here, but since I like them, I'll
6781740	6782740	read it.
6782740	6784460	No, I did not get one.
6784460	6788460	It has clever ideas, offering digital copies of games to first demo and then decide to
6788460	6792820	upgrade to the full version, having an easy setup of plugging in an HDMI cable, a library
6792820	6797460	of 200 games and counting, being able to run emulators to play games from older systems,
6797460	6801420	almost a retro gamer's dream come true, but the old saying is true, that a system is only
6801420	6805980	as good as the software, and unfortunately so far it has been able to really wow, I'm
6805980	6809180	thinking it hasn't been able to really wow anyone yet.
6809180	6813180	I am cautiously optimistic of how the Ouya will thrive, so for now I must wait until
6813220	6815020	the purchase of it will be warranted.
6815020	6818940	As far as mobile platform consoles, this is another format that has a lot of potential
6818940	6823140	to be great, but the old adage is true here as well, just like with the Ouya, that a console
6823140	6824880	is only as strong as the software.
6824880	6828940	If they market it well and have some major developer support, it can definitely be something
6828940	6830860	to look forward to.
6830860	6834040	Code Man says, no, I don't have a justification for buying one.
6834040	6838100	It would just make my wife more addicted to Candy Crush, and I definitely don't need that,
6838100	6839100	lol.
6839100	6840100	Oh, God.
6840100	6842620	There's so much confusion with the platform, I think, to be honest.
6843420	6846180	And there's no Candy Crush on it, thank God.
6846180	6848820	First off, so what, the console runs Android.
6848820	6851860	It doesn't make it a fucking mobile console.
6851860	6852860	It's not.
6852860	6855220	It's an operating system that runs Android.
6855220	6858100	It's just like Android runs on some of those smart TVs.
6858100	6860820	Does it mean your TV is a fucking mobile console?
6860820	6861820	No it's not.
6861820	6863020	It's a TV.
6863020	6866220	So it's just an operating system that you're developing games for.
6866220	6870020	Yes, a lot of the first games that are coming over are going to be ports of games that are
6870020	6875220	on the Android Marketplace, because you're porting an Android game to Android with some
6875220	6878740	additional APKs in there, so of course it's going to be like that.
6878740	6883060	But that's the thing, it's the whole draw of this console is that it's an indie console.
6883060	6888100	Now, I'm not saying that there's everything that's positive about it, because yes, there's
6888100	6893460	issues with the controller being, well, especially the first backer controllers, which I'm going
6893460	6897660	through an issue right now where I'm trying to get mine replaced because the analog sticks
6897660	6899780	don't work correctly.
6899780	6901220	And that's on Ouya.
6901220	6902940	They need to fix that shit.
6902940	6909500	And you know, since we're getting into some topic about, you know, Ouya.
6909500	6911620	Alright, can I read the rest of the answers here?
6911620	6912620	Yes, go ahead.
6912620	6913620	You still want to yell at people.
6913620	6914620	No, no, go ahead.
6914620	6915620	I'll save that for a second.
6915620	6916620	Alright.
6916620	6919260	Dart Charger says, I have a MAME cabinet for my emulation needs, and everything else that
6919260	6923820	I want can be handled by my consoles or smartphones and tablets, and Ouya would be the epitome
6923820	6926580	of a superfluous purchase.
6927220	6930980	AZHP says, I didn't get one because I didn't realize it came out this week.
6930980	6933500	If there's no advertising, how can I know when it's coming out?
6933500	6935900	I might pick one up soon for emulation purposes, though.
6935900	6938660	And lastly, Osfer says, I'm just not interested.
6938660	6942400	The new consoles from the big three are the only ones that really have my attention.
6942400	6944820	That's all the answers from Facebook and Google.
6944820	6946700	Thanks to y'all for answering.
6946700	6949700	Join us on Facebook and Google Plus for next week's question.
6949700	6950700	Alright.
6950700	6952580	Slidekick, are you going to get an Ouya?
6952580	6959940	You know, I was actually a very early backer, and, you know, honestly, if I kind of saw
6959940	6963460	how it played out, I don't think I would have backed them.
6963460	6964460	Yeah.
6964460	6971340	I don't know, just between, you know, you heard about all the mess with E3 and how rude
6971340	6972340	they were.
6972340	6973340	Oh yeah, I was there.
6973340	6976180	I took a picture of the big truck parked in front of the booth.
6976180	6980300	That was, it wasn't even, and the Ouya thing at E3 was more of a developer showcase than
6980300	6981300	it was the console.
6981300	6982300	Yeah.
6983020	6987260	But, you know, I think what I never really thought about is that, you know, they're just
6987260	6993900	going to keep trying to do Ouya's like on a, you know, maybe not a yearly basis, but
6993900	6998420	you know, I just think that the precedent that it's setting like, oh, the new Ouya is
6998420	7001940	out now and it's better than last year's Ouya.
7001940	7005900	It's like, you know, I just don't know if that's a good precedent to set for gaming
7005900	7012460	consoles, even though it's not directly trying to compete with, you know, the big three.
7012460	7016380	But, you know, I just, I don't, I don't know.
7016380	7022420	I actually, mine did arrive and I've yet to unbox it, so I probably should at some point.
7022420	7023420	Wow.
7023420	7029100	But Captain Spike also backed on Kickstarter before I did and he hasn't received his yet.
7029100	7033580	So God, you know, I'll hook mine up eventually.
7033580	7035740	I hope that I don't have any controller issues.
7035740	7037980	When did yours arrive?
7037980	7043620	You know, it arrived in late April or May, so your controller's fucked.
7043620	7044620	Sorry.
7044620	7045620	Yeah.
7045620	7047100	It was late May is when they fixed that shit.
7047100	7048100	I am.
7048100	7049100	Yeah.
7049100	7050100	See, I didn't back this for that reason.
7050100	7051100	I just knew.
7051100	7052100	But it's all fixed now.
7052100	7053100	It's fixed now.
7053100	7054100	Yeah, but not for you.
7054100	7057300	Well, it's fixed if I don't use the new Ouya controller.
7057300	7062340	Thank God I can pair a PlayStation 3 controller to it, but the only thing is not all games.
7062340	7063580	You have to account for that.
7063580	7066140	So they have to program in those button mappings as well.
7066140	7069380	I can, you know, for a lot of things like emulators, I can play with the PlayStation
7069380	7070860	3 controller and it works great.
7070860	7072100	That's how I knew it was.
7072100	7074300	It was the controller, not the console.
7074300	7078860	You know, I'm going to get into it in just a second.
7078860	7079900	Some of the customer service things.
7079900	7080900	It's ridiculous.
7080900	7082940	Well, if why don't we go back into the gaming news?
7082940	7085580	Loki, why don't you start us off with a possibly related topic?
7085580	7086580	Let's talk about this.
7086580	7087580	This is great.
7087580	7088580	This is fantastic.
7088580	7091180	Right when they launched, there was two Kickstarter updates.
7091180	7094140	One was like, hey, we launched our console.
7094140	7096260	You know, we couldn't have done it without you.
7096260	7099740	To which there was a bunch of replies, hey, you fucktard, I haven't gotten my fucking
7099740	7101860	console yet that I backed last year.
7101860	7103060	Where the fuck is it?
7103060	7106780	And then Julie comes out and says, I'm pissed.
7106780	7111820	I'm so pissed that we haven't been able to get some of those consoles to you.
7111820	7116180	You know, I promised that we'd ship them all and I don't know what's going on.
7116180	7119500	We have people in, you know, Hong Kong, they're checking into it and stuff.
7119500	7120780	I'll tell you what's going on.
7120780	7126380	They shipped it via fucking DHL, DHL Global, first off.
7126380	7129780	So slow ass ship in the first place.
7129780	7135460	And then you had to pass off to, because it was their global logistics mail or something
7135460	7140260	like that, where they pass it off to the US Postal Service.
7140260	7142440	It takes so fucking long.
7142440	7144380	They didn't know what the hell was going on.
7144380	7146980	It basically said, oh, yeah, you're going to get an update and your tracking number
7146980	7149660	will become active within, you know, like a couple days.
7149660	7151100	It took like a week.
7151100	7152780	My tracking number was never active.
7152780	7154340	It just showed up one day.
7154340	7156640	You're lucky if that thing showed up in the first place.
7156640	7160580	And then on top of all that, you had the issues where, you know, you're getting bummed controllers
7160580	7163980	with the earlier backer editions, which I did.
7163980	7166700	And it's annoying because it doesn't work correctly.
7166700	7170300	And so I replied, I sent a ticket for it.
7170300	7174860	I'm like, hey, I need this shit fixed, you know, so I sent them a ticket.
7174860	7178700	And you know, I understand that they're a little busy with their console launch and
7178740	7179740	stuff like that.
7179740	7180740	I sent it on Tuesday.
7180740	7183100	They got back to me today.
7183100	7184740	And here's what their response was.
7184740	7189660	It's like, as we continue to evolve the, oh yeah, making constant improvements to our
7189660	7191460	product and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
7191460	7194580	You got a copy paste from an outsource customer service company.
7194580	7195580	I bet anything.
7195580	7196580	It's not even outsource.
7196580	7198080	It took so long.
7198080	7201940	And basically saying, you know, the goal is, you know, you should look into the fact and
7201940	7204100	see if you could solve your problem there.
7204100	7206120	I'm like, I have a fucking defective controller.
7206120	7208300	Your fact doesn't help me there.
7208300	7210100	It doesn't say anything.
7210100	7214500	So I sent a reply, I'm like, listen, I have a defective controller, I need to replace
7214500	7217660	this shit because you know what's going to happen if I can't get it replaced?
7217660	7219420	I'm going to go to the store.
7219420	7221220	I'm going to buy a controller.
7221220	7224860	I'm going to replace it with my controller and I'm going to return it is what I'm going
7224860	7225860	to do.
7225860	7228020	Oh, shame on you.
7228020	7230840	But that's kind of, it's clever.
7230840	7233100	I should not be supporting that.
7233100	7236800	Something similar to that, but not really.
7236800	7241680	When Sonic Spinball came out, I got it for, you know, full price and then Target had it
7241680	7244900	for like five or seven dollars less.
7244900	7250160	So I bought it at Target and returned it to Toys R Us.
7250160	7254280	So I mean, it's not really like repackaging it, but I felt I was like 10 and I felt like
7254280	7259760	I was like, ooh, what if they find out that this is actually from Toys R Us?
7259760	7260760	Defective allowance.
7260760	7261760	It's, it's all right.
7261760	7266520	They're usage defectives, but it's seriously, if they're not going to solve my problem because
7266520	7268640	they're claiming that they're too busy right now.
7268640	7273400	Well, I'm sorry, but you know, it's going to be hard for me to continue supporting your
7273400	7276800	console if you're not going to give me a controller that fucking worked.
7276800	7280200	Since I only have one controller anyways and your additional controllers is 60 fucking
7280200	7281200	dollars.
7281200	7282200	Nope.
7282200	7283200	Not going to buy those.
7283200	7284200	Sorry.
7284200	7288840	So you say most of the cost of the system is the one controller that doesn't work?
7288840	7289840	That's their claim.
7289840	7290840	But here's the thing.
7290840	7295240	It's like, I don't understand why, why the whole thing was a clusterfuck to begin with
7295240	7296480	and I know it's going to get better.
7296480	7298440	I actually haven't touched my console since May.
7298440	7300600	I did loan to a friend, a coworker.
7300600	7303760	He wanted to check it out for stuff and so he did my updates and everything.
7303760	7307600	I guess the interface is a lot nicer now, but you know, a lot of the things that they
7307600	7311340	promise, obviously they didn't come through with like one of the major ones.
7311340	7315040	This console can be, this console can be easily rooted.
7315040	7318180	You're going to be able to root it immediately once you get it.
7318180	7319240	Can't do that.
7319240	7320240	Can't do that at all.
7320240	7322040	Uh, you know, it's very hacker friendly.
7322040	7323480	It's no, it's not.
7323480	7324480	It's not hacker friendly.
7324520	7326520	Aside from the fact that you can sideload.
7326520	7331120	Why not channel this energy into a complaint with a better business bureau?
7331120	7333200	Because they're not going to do anything.
7333200	7338760	No, it's not that whether they do something or not, it's still going to, um, hurt their
7338760	7340400	reputation and prevent them from being able to do business.
7340400	7343160	I'm sure there's tons of people who have already done that just for their backers.
7343160	7345400	Or is that just an excuse not to do it?
7345400	7347200	It is an excuse not to do it because I just don't care.
7347200	7348680	I don't care enough.
7348680	7351320	It's a con- I mean, it's not like I, I dropped a ton of money.
7351320	7354120	It was a hundred dollars a year ago and I just don't care.
7354120	7357800	And that's why companies get away with this because people don't care.
7357800	7358800	He wants the internet rage.
7358800	7359800	He wants the internet rage.
7359800	7361720	I want my controller to work and that's it.
7361720	7362720	Then that's fine.
7362720	7366240	So write them about it and tell them you're going to file a complaint and see how long
7366240	7367240	it takes them to reply.
7367240	7368480	Cause trust me, they will reply.
7368480	7369480	They won't reply.
7369480	7370480	They just, seriously.
7370480	7375080	The moment you bring up the three, you know, the business, the better business bureau,
7375080	7379600	especially for any company that wants to continue to do business, they tend to jump on that.
7379600	7381480	Especially if they've got other people doing the same.
7381480	7382480	Well, fine.
7382480	7385880	The next time I send them an update, I'll say, I'll contact the better business bureau
7385880	7388600	and we'll see them do nothing because yeah.
7388600	7391760	Let me read some of the written word in our chat room at live.vognetware.com.
7391760	7396200	Burr says, even the positive reviews are like, I like mine, but I haven't bought a game for
7396200	7397200	it yet.
7397200	7398200	Just played the demos.
7398200	7402080	There is seriously, a lot of the games on there are free to play right now and everything
7402080	7403340	has a free version of it.
7403340	7406400	So yeah, a lot of it you don't need to necessarily buy.
7406400	7411480	Codeman says, this is just a huge shit on the people who backed.
7411480	7417680	It is really unexcusable that they, you know, they got limited supply of the stores because
7417680	7420340	they wanted to make sure they have that retail presence or whatever.
7420340	7425040	But at the same time, they've made a promise to everyone that backed them to, you know,
7425040	7426040	deliver on that.
7426040	7430520	And if they can't deliver to, you know, people that ordered their console, I'm sorry, back
7430520	7435360	their Kickstarter and got a free console, however the fuck you want to word that because
7435400	7439520	you're not technically ordering anything, but you know, whatever.
7439520	7442720	They made a promise and they couldn't even fulfill that.
7442720	7445960	And they kept, they didn't give any firm numbers to what was shipping.
7445960	7449680	They just did this really generic line graph thing.
7449680	7454160	And you know, at a point at the beginning of June or something, they're like, all consoles
7454160	7455160	have shipped.
7455160	7456160	Really?
7456160	7459480	They've all shipped because no one's gotten them yet.
7459480	7462160	So yeah, it was really weird.
7462160	7467380	So I would be willing to, I'm kind of curious to see what it's going to look like in three
7467380	7468380	months time.
7468380	7471760	You know, if they're going to have all of these, you know, if they're going to follow
7471760	7475360	through with everything that they promised about this console, cause right now, you know,
7475360	7478520	they said they have like how many developers, like 5,000 developers or something like that
7478520	7481280	for the Ouya and there's 200 games.
7481280	7482960	Are they counting like every console they sold?
7482960	7486400	Because technically every console they sell can be a software development kit that you
7486400	7488020	can develop a game for.
7488020	7491880	So are we counting those as like con, you know, developers?
7492600	7493600	All right.
7493600	7494800	Well, I got to move on.
7494800	7499400	I'm sure Loki could do an entire episode just about his hatred towards this whole thing.
7499400	7500400	Lesson learned.
7500400	7503080	Would you, would you back another console after what happened to this?
7503080	7509740	Yeah, I would, but it'd be, it would have to be, you know, a lot more, um, research
7509740	7510740	done into it.
7510740	7515640	Like, you know, not that like Google's going to, you know, put a Kickstarter out there
7515640	7520360	for a console, but you know, it would have to be like, if, you know, it would be, it
7520360	7521640	would be, it'd be different.
7521640	7526040	Like there's a different, like a console that's supposed to be, I keep seeing that
7526040	7530660	they're trying to pitch this guy is kind of doing this, Oh, it can do everything and stuff
7530660	7531720	that you can imagine.
7531720	7532720	It's amazing.
7532720	7536380	The Oton or whatever, it's like this autonomous console is basically supposed to procedurally
7536380	7538720	generate games.
7538720	7544760	And that sounds neat, I guess, but it's just like the stuff that he's promising is ridiculous.
7544760	7549640	And so like, it's just like, yeah, I'm not going to back in this, but he's playing it
7549640	7550640	in a Kickstarter.
7550640	7554720	So you'll probably see that at some point, uh, cause he tried to get in, unfortunately
7554720	7558980	it was, we had got in and then they started requiring that anything that's electronics
7558980	7562960	or something like that has to have an actual prototype, a physical prototype made, not
7562960	7564560	just a concept.
7564560	7566480	So that's the problem.
7566480	7571960	I think it would be reluctant to spend as much on Kickstarter anymore.
7571960	7576600	Usually I just put in about 15 to $20 for a game or something, but that was the first
7576600	7582880	big, uh, big Kickstarter amount that I put in and I don't think I'd be as likely to do
7582880	7583880	it anymore.
7583880	7586320	All right, well let's move on.
7586320	7590680	Um, speaking of people who aren't likely to do certain things anymore, uh, Bethesda, the
7590680	7595320	vice president of PR marketing, Pete Hines, uh, in an interesting statement with, I believe
7595320	7598960	it was Eurogamer talking about quote, we don't have Facebook stuff.
7598960	7600580	We don't have mobile stuff.
7600580	7603440	We feel like we really know who we are, what we're good at.
7603440	7606280	So, you know, you know, you don't see Skyrim mobile or anything like that.
7606280	7609600	A while ago it was social games that were all the rage and people were asking, why
7609600	7610600	aren't we doing Facebook?
7610600	7613560	That's not what we do and that's no longer a big deal.
7613560	7616180	So we didn't run after it and now we're not running away from it.
7616180	7619120	We're just going to kind of stick to what we feel is best.
7619120	7624280	By the way, it doesn't just extend to Facebook and mobile quote, we have nothing announced
7624280	7626560	in development for Wii U.
7626560	7628920	It's not something we've done anything for previously.
7628920	7631760	I don't even remember the last time we've done a Nintendo title.
7631760	7632760	I do.
7632760	7633760	What was it?
7633760	7636000	It was Brunswick bowling.
7636000	7637000	I'm serious.
7637000	7638280	That's what it was.
7638280	7639280	We don't have anything.
7639280	7642940	That was just everybody trying to run off of the popularity of Wii Sports of which bowling
7642940	7644560	was huge.
7644560	7648400	We don't have anything now whether or not we would in the future is to be determined.
7648400	7651880	As for why, I guess I'd rather not go into that.
7651880	7653840	Oh, well, shit.
7653840	7657880	Now we all have to sit here and make it up because he won't go into it.
7657880	7663280	So what it is just that the Wii U is a, they don't believe in it.
7663280	7666640	They don't think something like Skyrim is capable of running on Wii U?
7666640	7671280	I think it's just, once again, it's cost risk type thing.
7671280	7677240	The cost it's going to take to develop a game or port a game over to that platform versus
7677240	7681920	the amount of money you're going to make with the limited marketplace for it right now because
7681920	7684000	there's just not a lot of people that bought the console.
7684000	7685000	I think it's going to change.
7685000	7688080	You're going to hear a lot of people more willing to develop for it when there's more
7688080	7690020	people that bought the console.
7690020	7693860	So it's going to take another year or so with some of these first party games to drive
7693860	7696940	some console sales to get more third parties involved.
7696940	7703500	But if it doesn't work, if the third parties, or I should say the first party games don't
7703500	7708620	drive enough console sales, then yeah, you're going to hear a lot more of this.
7708620	7712980	I don't think it's a huge loss because there hasn't really been a Bethesda game since
7712980	7713980	Brunswick Bowling.
7713980	7719460	So it's not like, I don't know, it is kind of disappointing because you think that something
7719460	7724520	that's kind of graphically on par with a Playstation 3 and an Xbox 360 and yet you're
7724520	7728580	not getting these games that are on those platforms.
7728580	7730380	It's not helping them any.
7730380	7733540	Alright, let's shift gears here completely.
7733540	7736260	Dark Soccer, you have a very interesting story for us next.
7736260	7742920	Yes, I do, and I found it on Game Politics, which I love Game Politics.
7742920	7746300	You want to see what goes on in the world around video games.
7746300	7750140	It doesn't necessarily have to do with release dates, then that's the place to go.
7750140	7758300	But there was a conservative political website called the Daily Caller that said that a Texas
7758300	7764120	teenager was making a joke while playing League of Legends, and the joke was, and I'm going
7764120	7768780	to quote, oh yeah, I'm real messed up in the head, I'm going to shoot up a school full
7768780	7774140	of kids and eat their still beating hearts, followed by a JK and lol.
7774140	7781180	Well, there were people who took this seriously, actually a Canadian lady, who looked up the
7781180	7788040	teenager's address and noted where he lived and reported it to the police, and he's been
7788040	7789680	in jail ever since.
7789680	7795520	He actually spent his 19th birthday in jail, and if he's convicted, he's going to spend
7795520	7803320	up to eight years in prison, and this is basically for making a terrorist threat.
7803320	7808080	It just goes to show what this is, basically it's an ignorant kid.
7808080	7813160	His dad said he doesn't watch the news, he doesn't read up on any current events, he's
7813160	7815240	just a dumb kid making a threat.
7815240	7820380	I'm sorry, but if you're on the internet, how do you not hear about stuff, just hearing
7820380	7822520	about stuff that other people are talking about?
7822520	7830040	Even apart from that, there's people who will all the time say really horrible things, trying
7830040	7837680	to threaten somebody or exert their own personal dominance over somebody else.
7837680	7843140	There's actually a petition out, I hate change.org, just because when you sign any petition there,
7843140	7850480	you get a bajillion emails, and I hate it, but there is a petition up on change.org right
7850480	7856920	now to try to get him out of jail, which I don't know if it's going to work, but the
7856920	7862520	whole thing that this boils down to, and it's almost an epidemic when it comes to online
7862520	7869720	play, is that, and it's not just the whole terrorist threat type statements, because
7869720	7873540	they're saying that there's kids everywhere being gotten in trouble for this, but for
7873540	7878840	the ones who go, oh I'm going to rape you, and I'm sure they're not meaning they're going
7878840	7885740	to go out and take somebody against their will, it's a means of exerting dominance.
7885740	7890660	It's, you know, top of the one says, just relax and let it happen.
7890660	7891660	Oh god.
7891660	7893660	Rob, I am disgusted.
7893660	7897700	You know, like the whole, I'm just, the G-rated version of that.
7897700	7901620	Well, but on top of that, there's also ones going, well I'm just going to beat the shit
7901620	7906900	out of you, or, just with all the cyberbullying that's been in the recent, or the tits are
7906900	7907900	GTFOs.
7907900	7912180	A lot of people say stupid shit on the internet, what a shock.
7912180	7919140	But what we're looking into now is that people actually taking some of them seriously, where,
7919140	7925300	and I firmly believe that this kid was just being a stupid kid, you know, just saying
7925300	7929140	something that he thought was going to make himself sound a little, you know, more puffed
7929140	7931900	up and a little bit more of a badass.
7931900	7934300	You have eight years in prison.
7934300	7939300	Yeah, I mean, I would even think by now, even if they dropped the whole thing, he's fucking
7939300	7940300	learned his lesson.
7940500	7943380	Send the cops to his house to scare the shit out of him.
7943380	7947460	You know, like that's, that's how you learn your lesson.
7947460	7952660	You know, I would, if I had a way to do that with everyone who said anything that out of
7952660	7959860	context could remotely be taken as threatening, or any type of bragging of said threatening
7959860	7965820	action, I would do it in a heartbeat just to scare people, you know, to scare people
7965820	7970060	into behaving, even though it shouldn't take scaring people into behaving.
7970060	7973540	They should just fucking know how to behave like a human being.
7973540	7974780	That's asking a lot from people.
7974780	7978020	That's asking a lot, I know.
7978020	7981380	And I mean, and it goes without saying that when, you know, you put these people behind
7981380	7987340	a mask of anonymity, that they think that they've got fair, you know, fair game to say
7987340	7990620	anything that they want, that there's no repercussion.
7990620	7996100	In this case, the lady knew who he was and called on him.
7996100	8000220	You know, I actually, my point with this is that I would actually even express this as
8000220	8006620	a cautionary tale, you know, put it out there for any of these people who are going to be
8006620	8007620	douches online.
8007620	8009060	Not that our listeners would ever do that.
8009060	8017900	No, because our listeners are kind, intelligent, beautiful, handsome, non-bigoted, lovely people.
8017900	8020620	And if you are bigoted, don't tell me or I'll beat you up.
8020620	8021620	I'm kidding.
8021620	8023580	No, I wouldn't beat anybody up.
8023580	8026300	I would hear sirens heading towards your house, Jamie.
8026300	8027300	Wow.
8027300	8028460	Popo's coming for Jamie.
8028460	8029460	Whatever.
8029460	8030460	You know what?
8030460	8032740	I would just judge them really harshly.
8032740	8044140	But you know, you should never bring up something that you know is going to be triggering.
8044140	8047020	I hate to use the word, but something that's going to be triggering to somebody.
8047020	8051660	You know, there are people who lost family and friends in any number of terrorist attack.
8051660	8055300	I know people personally who have lost family members.
8055300	8058540	You know, it's a really awful thing.
8058540	8066020	And when you bring up something like that, when there is such a volatile environment
8066020	8072340	around that, just that concept, then you are really asking for a pile of shit.
8072340	8077420	I mean, I think like games included, but you know, just as everything moves more with more
8077420	8078420	online communication.
8078420	8083660	I mean, I think people just need to really be more mindful and like we need to educate
8083660	8086940	people of, you know, but I mean, again, that's asking a lot.
8086940	8091940	I'm going to quote my granddaddy and my granddaddy was a great guy from Bridgeport, Connecticut.
8091940	8092940	He was our Yankee.
8092940	8098240	When I grew up in the south, he always said, put brain in gear before mouth in motion.
8098240	8102580	His other catchphrase was don't be an instigator and an agitator.
8102580	8107320	But I mean, those are two really good pieces of advice.
8107320	8111580	You don't want to stir up the hornet's nest.
8111580	8115320	You have to gently remove it to where you don't get stung in the process or no one else
8115320	8116320	get hurt.
8116320	8117540	You know, it's the same thing.
8117540	8121160	And I think that with this kid, yeah, he doesn't deserve to be locked up, but he did deserve
8121160	8125360	to have a stern talking to at least to have some sort of repercussion.
8125360	8126360	Scared straight.
8126360	8127360	Exactly.
8127360	8128360	Or maybe scared gay.
8128360	8129360	I don't know.
8129360	8130360	Whatever.
8130360	8131360	Whatever.
8131360	8133240	You're the one who told me to go gaily forward.
8133240	8134240	OK.
8134240	8140920	Anyway, I think that in any of any of these cases, you know, yeah, they need to drop it
8140920	8141920	with the kid.
8141920	8143880	He's clearly learned his lesson.
8143880	8147440	But to everybody, just think before you speak.
8147440	8151440	And instead of reacting to something that someone has said or something that you've
8151440	8157960	seen or losing a game, boo hoo, go cry me a fucking river.
8157960	8159760	Don't react.
8159760	8161560	Think and act.
8161560	8162560	So the story.
8162560	8166840	I apologize after our press our luck game, slide kick for threatening to kill you and
8166840	8170160	leave your corpse out on the porch for the cause of love.
8170160	8172680	Can you say you're going to pee on my corpse, too?
8172680	8173920	Yeah, I probably did.
8173920	8177040	And I was going to hit you with a bug net repeatedly since you like Animal Crossing
8177040	8178040	so much.
8178040	8182160	So I hear the sirens again, they're coming back this way.
8182160	8183160	No.
8183160	8184160	All right.
8184160	8185160	I'm sorry.
8185160	8186160	I shouldn't joke about it.
8186160	8187160	I shouldn't laugh.
8187160	8192280	I just I would actually just still like to encourage our listeners to keep a level head.
8192280	8193360	Don't react.
8193360	8195320	Think and act.
8195320	8196420	That's my new catchphrase.
8196420	8202200	You should have a little McGruff, the crime dog saying you should make some YouTube gaming
8202200	8203200	PSAs.
8203200	8207320	Get gamey like like Jamie's gaming stern advice.
8207320	8212200	I almost said gamey like Wanda Sykes, knock it off.
8212200	8215220	And then, you know, what's going to happen is I'm going to get a ton of people commenting
8215220	8220760	on YouTube, you know, show me your boobs, get back in the kitchen, rape, blah, blah,
8220760	8221760	blah.
8222240	8225240	And then you have to just single out each and every one of them, trace their IPs and
8225240	8226400	send them a letter.
8226400	8231800	Back trace them through the Internet or just disable comments.
8231800	8232800	That's what I do.
8232800	8237400	But I've actually done that before where I got one of those stupid, you know, so and
8237400	8238400	so rape.
8238400	8240520	But it came through a source that I was able to track back as IP.
8240520	8241520	It was on a forum.
8241520	8243840	I think it was a DDR freak back in the day.
8243840	8247620	But I traced his IP back and found out where he lived and messaged him.
8247620	8248680	You live here and here.
8248680	8249960	I have your phone number.
8249960	8250960	What are you going to do about it?
8251160	8252160	Oh, please don't call me.
8252160	8253160	Please don't call me.
8253160	8255160	I'm going to call your mother.
8255160	8256160	No.
8256160	8259440	Well, I love all those people who say, oh, well, I just found your Facebook.
8259440	8261200	I'm posting it back where your mom can see it.
8261200	8262200	Yeah.
8262200	8264960	But then some trolls make it really successfully and it makes me very bitter.
8264960	8269240	I'm having a drink as I say that.
8269240	8274080	In some cases, it's when you remove that mask of anonymity that they really straighten up.
8274080	8275080	You know what I mean?
8275080	8279080	Degenerate Johnny in chat says, go to shit senders dot com and send them a cow pie.
8279080	8280080	That's a real thing.
8280200	8281200	Yes, it is.
8281200	8282200	But that's great.
8282200	8283200	That happens.
8283200	8284200	Spike, if you're listening.
8284200	8285200	Happy birthday.
8285200	8287560	Actually, you know what I want to do?
8287560	8290600	And I don't know if something like this exists because you know how there's like the National
8290600	8292280	Sex Offender Registry.
8292280	8294480	I want to do the Internet Offender Registry.
8294480	8296480	National Gaming Douchebag.
8296480	8297480	Yeah.
8297480	8301940	Well, you can do slander, slander, lawsuit, slander.
8301940	8308780	If you can do as so-and-so parks like an asshole dot com, then you can do shit people said
8308780	8311300	on the Internet dot com.
8311300	8313220	You know, I'm just saying.
8313220	8316740	Captain Spike is in chat, by the way, and says rude.
8316740	8319900	All right, moving on.
8319900	8321980	I'm sure we have lots of other thoughts on this.
8321980	8326460	I invite you guys to email us mailbag at Orange Lounge Radio dot com.
8326460	8330300	Although we are definitely going to change that email address in the coming weeks.
8330300	8331780	But for now, you can still use that.
8331780	8334300	There'll be plenty of announcement when we flip it over.
8334300	8336580	Mailbag at Orange Lounge Radio dot com.
8336580	8339300	Meanwhile, everyone's doing emails these days.
8339300	8340300	I love it.
8340300	8341300	What?
8341300	8345340	Well, Queen City is a National Doucheburg registry and Fifth Dream says dbag shaming
8345340	8347180	dot com.
8347180	8348380	I am all for that.
8348380	8349380	I would do it.
8349380	8350380	All right.
8350380	8355820	Let's we have to run it through Sweden so that we don't get low Q. We need something
8355820	8357860	a little less serious here.
8357860	8360780	All right.
8360780	8361780	Let's see here.
8362780	8368940	Molly Jam, part two, this this one's going to be a little different instead of basing
8368940	8375660	it off of the fake Peter Molyneux Twitter account and those kind of ideas.
8375660	8382100	These are based off of actual quotes from Peter Molyneux.
8382100	8385020	And it's weird.
8385020	8386140	It's really weird.
8386140	8388500	Can you read the one that was included in that article?
8388500	8390100	Yes, I can do that.
8390100	8394020	In fact, here is some of the stuff and I think a lot of this is going to be very dirty.
8394020	8395300	It's you Americans.
8395300	8397980	There's something about nipples you hate.
8397980	8403220	If this were Germany, we'd be romping around naked on stage here.
8403220	8404220	So that could become a game.
8404220	8408660	I feel like that would be a callback to the Atari days, you know, beat them and eat them.
8408660	8409660	Gross.
8409660	8410660	Like, OK, there you go.
8410660	8411660	I'm in the list.
8411660	8413840	I'm going to read off a couple of these for you.
8413840	8415660	These are potential games right here.
8415660	8419460	You can actually break someone's neck on some railing during combat.
8419460	8424300	It could be a spike on a fence or a solid brick wall and you get increased experience
8424300	8426540	for that as well.
8426540	8429380	Neckbreaker like it.
8429380	8430380	Let's see here.
8430380	8434620	We're we're explorers who have just discovered this new continent of emotion.
8434620	8435620	I'd actually play that.
8435620	8438620	It would probably be very cool.
8438620	8439620	Let's see.
8439620	8443220	I wish I had I had some time machine and could go back two weeks.
8443220	8446400	You live by your mistakes for sure.
8446400	8450680	When you rip your fingers on the screen, you tear the landscape apart with your physical
8450680	8451680	hands.
8451680	8453120	It just feels amazing, man.
8453120	8455600	It's feels amazing.
8455600	8457600	Let's see here.
8457600	8462000	They have 48 hours to make a game out of these quotes.
8462000	8463000	Yeah.
8463000	8464240	There's like 22 quotes here.
8464240	8466800	What about ripping the screen would have to be an iOS title?
8466800	8469720	I remember I remember hearing about this last year.
8469720	8474280	You can eliminate starvation or you can double it.
8474280	8479840	You can empty the treasury or you fill it with gold and rub it all over your body.
8479840	8481080	That game sounds hot.
8481080	8482080	Yeah.
8482080	8483600	Another Atari adult game.
8483600	8490760	Well, will the first female nudity give you a success or will it turn off an audience?
8490760	8492760	What is that going to be?
8492760	8493760	I can't wait.
8493760	8494760	I got to see that.
8494760	8495760	I'm not punishing you for button mashing.
8495760	8497920	I'm rewarding you for not button mashing them.
8497920	8502040	That's a really big distinction that could be a rhythm game.
8502040	8503040	All right.
8503040	8504040	Anyhow.
8504800	8505800	Show me the game.
8505800	8506800	Wait.
8506800	8507800	Last one though.
8507800	8508800	All right.
8508800	8509800	When you're doing it in multiplayer, it feels incredible.
8509800	8510800	I love that.
8510800	8511800	Oh.
8511800	8513880	So the theme is going to be adult games then.
8513880	8514880	Good times.
8514880	8515880	All right.
8515880	8519040	Well, maybe some of these games that come out of MolyJam could be pitched to Dave and
8519040	8521000	Buster's arcade or cage chain.
8521000	8522000	Oh, God.
8522000	8526000	You know, Dave and Buster's, of course, it used to be the annual site of my birthday
8526000	8529240	every year when I would play junk.
8529240	8530520	It stopped for some reason.
8530520	8532800	Yeah, because they got rid of BattleTech.
8533560	8539800	Well, anyhow, Dave and Buster's, along with Comedy Central, VH1, and MTV, that whole network
8539800	8543760	thing, is putting on this contest called The Next Big Game Search, and you can see this
8543760	8546040	at nextgame.cc.com.
8546040	8547700	You can fill out a form.
8547700	8552760	You can do its ideas, their pitches for a mobile app, larger than life arcade game,
8552760	8556120	or simply some improvements for an already classic game.
8556120	8559800	You'll be judged on originality, ease of play, family fun, it has to be suitable for people
8559800	8564120	of all ages, so some of those nudity games won't be eligible, gameplay experience, and
8564120	8566120	difficulty.
8566120	8572100	The prizes, the grand prize is Dave and Buster's Create Your Game and Free Games for Life.
8572100	8577060	First runner up, $5,000 in gameplay at Dave and Buster's, and second runner up gets $500
8577060	8578060	in gameplay.
8578060	8582160	The contest runs through July 15th, you have to be a resident of the U.S.
8582160	8586240	I'm telling you what, though, if you go and submit an OLR dream game and you win this
8586240	8593080	competition, patent pending, and you owe us a chunk of your winnings, just saying,
8593080	8596960	you're going to buy us a hell of a nice meal at Dave and Buster's, that's all I'm saying.
8596960	8599080	You can record a live from Dave and Buster's.
8599080	8601120	Yes, that's right.
8601120	8603640	We should go submit some of our favorite dream game ideas into this.
8603640	8604640	Just do them all.
8604640	8605640	Just do them all.
8605640	8607640	This would be fun.
8607640	8613240	Can you imagine if the winner, if the winning game out of this was WhatTheyPlay.com Snap
8613240	8614440	or Puzzle Sluts?
8614440	8618080	No, it has to be for all ages.
8618080	8621640	I don't think that the Roosevelt Dave and Buster's has the DDR anymore.
8621640	8622640	That's sad.
8622640	8624720	Answering Misty in chat room because she asked.
8624720	8628320	Besides that, the Roosevelt Dave and Buster's is the size of a closet.
8628320	8629320	No one goes there anyway.
8629320	8632640	Yeah, when you have a Dave and Buster's that's smaller than the Times Square Dave and Buster's,
8632640	8633640	it's a problem.
8633640	8635880	All right, let's go to the mailbag.
8635880	8641480	Every week you guys email us mailbag at orangelauntrader.com and we sift through the emails that are mixed
8641480	8645120	in with all the Asian spam that we get.
8645120	8646920	We have a lot of Asian spam this time.
8646920	8649640	Oh my god, and Russian spam and French spam.
8649640	8653080	It's like just when we thought the French spam and Russian spam was done with.
8653080	8655080	Zoot le porn.
8655080	8656080	All right, moving on.
8656080	8660280	Mailbag at orangelauntrader.com, DarkStalker.io Dive in the mailbag, pull out some emails.
8660280	8662280	Okay, hello guys.
8662280	8663280	Hello.
8663280	8665880	OOR the video game podcast where every gamer has a voice, right?
8665880	8669000	Well, I'm going to offer up mine to say girl please.
8669000	8671400	Ocarina of Time is not an overrated game.
8671400	8674760	It is as deserving of praise just as much as Link to the Past is.
8674760	8675760	Next email.
8675760	8676760	Hey, Rob.
8676760	8677760	Fine.
8677760	8683400	To quote a video game, sit your ass down in that chair and drink your goddamn tea.
8683400	8686920	Hearts, hearts, hearts, hearts.
8686920	8688520	It is, okay, blah, blah, blah.
8688520	8692160	The major thing that determines which you have an affinity for is the one you grew up
8692160	8693520	playing first.
8693520	8698560	Mine obviously was Ocarina, but I also grew up playing Link to the Past on Game Boy Advance.
8699360	8702760	I have many fond memories of playing through that game just as I do with Ocarina of Time,
8702760	8706680	but Ocarina moved me on a deeper level and made me into the gamer I am today.
8706680	8710400	For the record, I actually really like both of them about equally.
8710400	8712480	It depends on the mood I'm in.
8712480	8714440	Yeah, I really like them both.
8714440	8716160	I really like Majora's Mask too.
8716160	8722120	It's like I really love lasagna, but I also really, really like sushi.
8722120	8726560	I really like Link to the Past, and that's the end of that sentence.
8726560	8730160	This brings me to two questions about your opinions on Ocarina of Time, specifically
8730160	8731160	for Rob.
8731160	8732160	Thank God.
8732160	8733160	Rad.
8733160	8736120	One, you mentioned that you really like Twilight Princess.
8736120	8737760	Hell, I did too.
8737760	8743640	I caused a flood warning for all of Northeast Ohio with how much I came buckets over Link
8743640	8747960	turning into a wolf.
8747960	8748960	Okay.
8748960	8749960	Came buckets?
8749960	8750960	Whoa.
8750960	8752920	I thought I was thinking cried, but it's came buckets.
8752920	8753920	Sexy chat.
8753920	8754920	Sticky.
8755160	8759200	But why are you so fond of a game that took a lot of cues from Ocarina of Time?
8759200	8760200	Yeah, Rob.
8760200	8761200	Why?
8761200	8762200	Yeah, Rob.
8762200	8763200	Why?
8763200	8764200	Because.
8764200	8765200	Next question.
8765200	8768160	No, especially with all the waggle technology being new, and it was something that was a
8768160	8772600	little bit outside of Wii Sports, and I think also kind of getting to see the game with
8772600	8773600	more...
8773600	8777000	Like in Ocarina of Time, the 3D was still so early on, you had a lot of very blocky
8777000	8780160	textures and very solid colors and things.
8780160	8784800	And I realized at the time there were a lot of people that were very imaginative, and
8784800	8785800	it didn't matter.
8785800	8789480	But you have to remember there were a lot of us in my generation that grew up on the
8789480	8790480	2D games.
8790480	8793200	Like you say that Ocarina of Time was from your generation.
8793200	8796320	We were a little more stubborn when it came to getting into the 3D.
8796320	8799080	Like I was cool with Mario Kart.
8799080	8800960	I like Mario 64.
8800960	8804160	I don't think it deserves all the praise that it gets.
8804160	8806640	Are you an N64 hater?
8806640	8808080	I'm not an N64 hater.
8808080	8812200	So you're saying you didn't pee your pants when Star Fox came out?
8812200	8813480	When the first Star Fox came out?
8813480	8814480	No.
8814480	8815480	That was the shit when that came out.
8815480	8816480	But it was different.
8816480	8817480	But it was 3D.
8817480	8818480	It was different.
8818480	8819480	But it was still on rails.
8819480	8820480	It was different.
8820480	8822160	I can't explain it.
8822160	8827440	But Ocarina of Time, it wasn't quite HD Zelda, but it definitely felt like that next big
8827440	8835000	step that the Zelda series needed to take to make it so much more immersive.
8835000	8839080	Number two, a while back I remember you mentioning that you're not a big fan of Metroid Prime.
8839080	8842640	You didn't like the direction Nintendo took the series and that it just didn't have the
8842640	8845320	same feeling of the older games like Super Metroid.
8845320	8848760	Do you think that this has to do with why you didn't like Ocarina of Time and the fact
8848760	8851200	that both games were a shift to 3D?
8851200	8852200	Yes.
8852200	8855400	But I like Metroid Prime 3 for the record.
8855400	8860000	Did you just not like that change in which the game stayed as top-down Zelda or side-scrolling
8860000	8862480	Metroid games?
8862480	8867960	Yes and no because I still stand pretty hard for Zelda 2, which even Miyamoto himself has
8867960	8868960	issues with.
8868960	8869960	Yeah.
8869960	8870960	I don't like Zelda 2.
8871960	8874560	But I'll defend that game as pretty fucking awesome.
8874560	8875560	Dan will agree with you.
8875560	8876560	Just saying.
8876560	8877560	Yeah.
8877560	8881840	It's hard as hell, but beating that game when I was a kid, I'm not gonna be able to do that
8881840	8882840	again.
8882840	8883840	I've tried.
8883840	8885160	That's tough.
8885160	8887920	What do you think about Wind Waker?
8887920	8891400	I honestly didn't play enough of it.
8891400	8893280	I didn't play enough of it.
8893280	8895240	Dan beat Wind Waker and he really liked it.
8895240	8897000	I just couldn't get into it.
8897040	8900960	If I can borrow the HD one or get it on Gamefly or something, I'll give it another try.
8900960	8903360	Well, Rob, I can lend you mine.
8903360	8908280	Well, you know, there's the HD remake coming out on the US Play Store.
8908280	8910080	Oh, you and your HD.
8910080	8911080	Why not?
8911080	8915080	Thanks for reading and sorry for the slightly longer email, but I just got to defend my
8915080	8918880	first and favorite gaming love that is Ocarina of Time and that's from Ospher.
8918880	8921000	Well, every gamer has a voice even when they're-
8921000	8923840	And I don't need to know about you coming bucket.
8923840	8926160	Every gamer has a voice even when their opinions are not correct.
8926160	8927160	There's a PS.
8927160	8928160	Oh, that was Ospher?
8928160	8929160	Yeah.
8929160	8930160	I'm not surprised about the coming buckets.
8930160	8933480	Yeah, because Twilight Princess has, like, nevermind.
8933480	8936600	I actually just finished a playthrough of Ocarina of Time last night with one of my
8936600	8937600	close friends.
8937600	8941880	We took turns playing through the dungeons and reminiscing on how we grew up while playing
8941880	8942880	it as kids.
8942880	8944800	After the end credits, we were both pretty teary-eyed.
8944800	8947080	You know, so play it again.
8947080	8948080	You know what?
8948080	8954560	I actually not too long ago played through Ocarina on the GameCube redo disc.
8954560	8956800	You need to get the 3DS version.
8956800	8957800	It's really good.
8957800	8961080	I still wanted 40 bucks for it and they're charging a premium for it because it's out
8961080	8962080	of print now.
8962080	8963080	Oh.
8963080	8966600	Um, by the way, I just want to make sure this is very clear.
8966600	8968360	I don't hate Ocarina of Time.
8968360	8972400	I never have and I've never said that word on the show in regards to Ocarina of Time.
8972400	8977000	I just don't lavish all the praise upon it that many other people do.
8977000	8978000	I think it's a good game.
8978000	8979200	In fact, I think it's a great game.
8979200	8982280	I just don't think it's in my top 20.
8982280	8983520	Rob, you like it.
8983520	8985280	You just don't like like it.
8985280	8986280	Exactly.
8986280	8987280	You wouldn't date it.
8987280	8988440	I wouldn't eat it shield.
8988440	8990120	You'd go to Pinkberry with it, but you wouldn't date it.
8990120	8991120	Get it?
8991120	8992120	Because I don't like like it.
8992120	8993120	Ha ha ha ha ha.
8993120	8995120	That was a Zelda joke, people!
8995120	8996120	Awww.
8996120	8997120	Hey.
8997120	8998120	I try.
8998120	9000800	Mwah mwah mwah mwah.
9000800	9001800	Last email.
9001800	9004080	Um, this is from Sam.
9004080	9005080	Hi, Sam.
9005080	9006840	Hello, OLR crew.
9006840	9007840	I love the show.
9007840	9012160	If the devs stop making single player games, are we really any better off than we were
9012160	9013880	before Microsoft's change in plans?
9013880	9014880	What do you all think?
9014880	9016640	First of all, I don't think the single player games are going away.
9016640	9018120	No, single player games won't go away.
9018120	9020060	There will always be a demand for single player games.
9020060	9022040	There are always antisocial people.
9022040	9027440	However, I can see where this guy, unless Sam is for Samantha, could be guy or girl,
9027440	9038200	but I'm going to assume guy, where this individual, our lovely writer, where this individual is
9038200	9040880	getting this from, because it does seem like a lot of single player games that have come
9040880	9043320	out lately have a multiplayer mode suddenly in it.
9043320	9044320	What?
9044320	9045320	Just within the past few months.
9045320	9046320	Tomb Raider.
9046320	9047320	Tomb Raider.
9047320	9048320	Uncharted 3.
9048320	9049320	Last of Us.
9049320	9050320	Mass Effect 3.
9050320	9052800	Like all the Assassin's Creed ones, even though it's a little bit older.
9052800	9053800	Assassin's Creed 3.
9053800	9055760	They all have multiplayer modes in them.
9055760	9060160	Now, I don't think in any of these cases they've necessarily detracted from the single player
9060160	9063600	game, although some people kind of resented that you kind of had to play multiplayer to
9063600	9065200	get the edge in Mass Effect 3.
9065200	9066200	That's true.
9066200	9068600	But Mass Effect 3 multiplayer is great, so whatever.
9068600	9069600	Yeah, that's the thing.
9069600	9070600	That's the thing.
9070600	9071600	It's great.
9071600	9075000	It also gives the games more replay value, I guess you could say.
9075000	9076000	I still have yet to-
9076000	9079600	Although, for Mass Effect fans, replay value is going and making another Shepard.
9079600	9080600	Let's be real.
9080600	9081600	You know what?
9081600	9084600	Okay, and this is the funny thing.
9084600	9088280	I'm now on my third playthrough of the first game, because I'm braving the motion sickness.
9088280	9092040	I've beaten two and three 27 bajillion times.
9092040	9097760	The fun for that for me is making a new Shepard and completely hacking everything I can possibly
9097760	9100160	hack about the appearance.
9100160	9107160	I have one wearing Ashley's face like it's ripped off of her flesh as she died on Vermaier.
9107160	9108160	Wow.
9108160	9112480	And wearing Warren's outfit.
9112480	9114480	She has been referred to as Hobag Ashley.
9114480	9121480	So, in my discussion there, the original question was Xbox One something- I think you closed
9121480	9122480	the email, huh?
9122480	9123480	I did.
9123480	9128360	Do you think that single players are going away from the past?
9128360	9131520	I don't think it was necessarily going away, but I think it has something to do with as
9131520	9132920	they fade more and more.
9132920	9135760	Is Microsoft's decision a bad one?
9135760	9145760	Well, now that they- Well, I still think if Microsoft wanted to- Here's the thing.
9145760	9150320	If Microsoft wanted to try and push digital, then there's no reason they can't run two
9150320	9152160	separate license systems.
9152160	9155520	Your disk-based license and your digital-based license.
9155520	9158600	Why not enhance the digital license?
9158600	9161960	You know, Nintendo dipped their little pinky in the water when they said, well, if you
9161960	9166240	buy the game digitally, you'll get 5%- Was it 10% back in points, which you can trade
9166240	9167520	in for cards, right?
9167520	9172240	A little bit of- It's a tiny ass incentive, but it's some incentive to get the game online.
9172240	9174560	What if Microsoft said, okay, we're going to one up that.
9174560	9179240	So, when you digitally buy the game, here's the perk you get over getting it on disk,
9179400	9183120	is that you can now share this digital game with a friend.
9183120	9186920	You can loan it out to a friend across the country instantly.
9186920	9188200	That's the perk you get with it.
9188200	9190440	Why can't they run both licenses?
9190440	9191960	They can do it.
9191960	9194280	It will take time to develop and so on.
9194280	9200400	I think if Microsoft really wants to, for the Xbox 2, or whatever their next generation
9200400	9204360	system is called after this, assuming this box doesn't kill the company, but I don't
9204360	9213840	think it will, they could start getting people used to the idea of digital and why it's better.
9213840	9219120	As opposed to, nope, we're going to change the whole fucking thing right now.
9219120	9220640	We're turning your world upside down.
9220640	9226280	Yeah, even though I don't approve of a lot of what the Xbox One was trying to do, I do
9226280	9229840	think it's a shame that we didn't see how it could have developed.
9229840	9233160	The positive was never clearly communicated, only the negative.
9233160	9234920	Yeah, lesson learned, hopefully.
9236600	9238600	Anyhow, that was it for Mailbag, right?
9238600	9239240	That was.
9239240	9242600	Well then that means we get to the FUs of the week.
9242600	9245640	Every week here on this show, we let out a little angst.
9245640	9246120	Why?
9246120	9248680	Because we're just really angry people.
9263160	9271880	You know, I hate bringing up traffic, but this was really fucking stupid.
9271880	9277080	When I was driving over that same bridge, over across the American River, coming this
9277080	9285480	way to your place, Rob, someone was freaking tailgating me during all that road construction-wise.
9285480	9290760	With a cop, expecting me to speed, and I'm like, no.
9290760	9295000	And I know everybody and their twin goes 20 miles over the speed limit over that bridge,
9295000	9300120	but I was about to do it while there was a CHP parked off to the side.
9300120	9305640	Sorry, your convenience isn't worth me having a $300 ticket.
9305640	9306920	Loki?
9306920	9308920	Fuck you to hand, foot, and mouth disease.
9308920	9311800	I don't like having blisters on my hands and feet.
9311800	9313480	Or my mouth.
9313480	9315080	Slidekick, why don't you go next?
9315080	9321800	I want to say FU to the lady in the Target parking lot who gave me a very pressed look
9321800	9324520	when I was trying to leave.
9324520	9331320	I'm sorry that I delayed you 10 seconds getting to your car so you could go home and eat your
9331320	9332600	Panda Express.
9332600	9334360	I'm sure it just ruined your day.
9334360	9336120	That orange chicken just fucking-
9336120	9337160	She glared at me.
9337160	9338440	She's like, fine, go.
9338440	9340760	The orange chicken would not stay warm in this weather.
9340760	9345560	Oh, by the way, I'd like to add a thank you to you.
9345560	9346760	Aww.
9346760	9349240	Thank you so much for facilitating the crack.
9349800	9352840	And thank you for the Groupon for brunch.
9352840	9357080	Hey, hey, hey, no rainbow and sunshine shit in the FU segment.
9357080	9358120	You better watch it.
9358120	9358840	FU Rob.
9358840	9359960	Yeah, FU Rob.
9359960	9361080	Just kidding, I love you.
9361080	9361800	I-L-U.
9361800	9362520	FU both.
9362520	9363320	Here's my finger.
9364040	9365480	Should do an I-L-U section.
9367480	9369080	You want to do an I love yous of the week?
9369080	9370680	Wait, hold on, because I got to get my FU out.
9371560	9375800	Fuck you to this goddamn shitty fucking hateful heat.
9375800	9376920	Amen.
9376920	9378760	Tim TRP in chat agrees.
9378760	9379240	All right.
9379240	9380120	It is hateful.
9380120	9382520	That's a good word for a Rob, it's hateful.
9382520	9382840	Okay.
9382840	9384280	I'm sliding on the chair.
9384280	9384680	Okay.
9384680	9387560	It's time for the I-L-U's of the week.
9389320	9391320	Yes, I'm using the same music bumper twice.
9391320	9393240	It's the I-L-U's of the week.
9393240	9394440	I love you KBB.
9396280	9397240	Dark Sakura.
9398200	9400680	Thank you for the 3DS.
9400680	9401320	Slack kick.
9401320	9402920	You are my hero forever.
9403640	9406440	And I have Animal Crossing now.
9406440	9408680	Thank you because you facilitated it.
9408680	9410680	And I'm glad you enjoyed your sausage.
9412120	9414120	Oh, I always enjoy my sausage.
9414680	9421640	And I have to say I-L-U to Dark Sakura for the Groupon for brunch and for sharing her
9421640	9422520	French toast with me.
9422520	9423320	It was so good.
9423320	9429880	Oh, we should, Sam's should just be a sponsor for, you know.
9429880	9435320	And I'm going to give my I-L-U of the week to Alan because he's over there in the kitchen
9435320	9436520	clearly making dinner.
9437080	9438680	You can't hear the foil in the background.
9438680	9439800	Oh, being so domestic.
9439800	9441080	You've got an I-L-U, right?
9441080	9441640	Nope.
9441640	9446120	You know, you know, the quickest way to a man's heart is through his stomach.
9446120	9448200	So no, it's through the rib cage.
9449800	9452120	Loki, what's your I-L-U of the week?
9452120	9452840	I don't have one.
9452840	9453340	Sorry.
9454120	9454600	What?
9454600	9455640	You grumpy cat.
9455640	9458760	I love the fact it's really sweltering hot in here.
9458760	9459400	That's great.
9460520	9461400	There's nothing I can do.
9461400	9463240	You don't have I-L-U to breadsticks?
9463240	9465480	I-L-U to these five fans.
9465480	9470200	One, two, three, four, five.
9470200	9472200	And all your fans in the chat room.
9472920	9474840	Oh, all right.
9474840	9475560	Oops, sorry.
9476360	9477960	That was not meant to be followed by Holik.
9478920	9480680	Everything is meant to be followed by Holik.
9480680	9484200	All right, moving on.
9484200	9489480	Loki, if you could possibly do the next story.
9489480	9490280	Sure.
9490280	9498920	Okay, so unfortunately there was a little bit of an issue with the precursor games.
9499640	9503880	Apparently, writer, game designer, and artist Ken McColl,
9504920	9507960	he was arrested for possession of child pornography.
9507960	9511000	That's not good.
9512360	9514680	So, of course, no, that's definitely not good.
9514680	9518360	So, of course, you know, the company is now distancing themselves from,
9518360	9522440	you know, their co-founder, and he doesn't have anything to do now,
9522440	9527080	obviously, with Shadows of the Eternals, which, you know.
9527960	9532360	Every time I hear Shadow of the Eternal now, I just, I hear this as the theme song.
9532360	9541000	Yeah, as if Precursor needed any more bad press, honestly.
9541960	9542280	Right?
9543800	9545480	It's, yeah, that sucks.
9547000	9548440	Oh, well, what are you gonna do?
9548440	9551320	I mean, that's all you can do.
9551320	9554200	Well, for one, don't download child pornography.
9554200	9555320	That's not good.
9555320	9556200	That's gross.
9556920	9557960	It's beyond gross.
9559000	9561800	By the way, Rob, did you hear about the 12-year-old girl
9561800	9566920	who shamed a guy in her room janking off over her into leaving?
9566920	9567800	Ew!
9567800	9568600	What?
9568600	9570840	Yeah, it was, what was it?
9570840	9574920	It was, it was on the, um, I read it on, like, some news thing.
9574920	9577880	It was, like, a legit news thing where this 12-year-old girl says,
9577880	9579720	you need to be ashamed of yourself.
9579720	9580040	Leave.
9580680	9581240	And he did.
9582200	9584040	The internet's disgusting.
9584920	9586120	Disgusting place.
9586120	9588040	Well, no, this was a real life thing, but.
9588600	9589320	Well, it's just.
9590200	9590840	I have a story.
9590920	9591800	That was a weird tangent.
9591800	9593400	That was a very weird tangent.
9593400	9595000	Our soccer took the show to an awkward place.
9595000	9598600	People who are just awful people need to be ashamed of themselves.
9600760	9605240	All right, uh, moving on to, uh, a campaign about something that really
9605240	9609240	pisses people off about the Wii U, and that is region locking.
9609240	9612120	You know, I guess some of the fans out there are hoping, you know,
9612120	9617400	if Operation Rainfall worked and Microsoft ended up reversing Corus on a lot of their shit,
9617400	9621880	maybe, just maybe, we can get Nintendo to end region locking.
9621880	9625480	And they're taking to Twitter, you know, because Twitter is a very effective way of protesting.
9625480	9628680	Well, it worked for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
9628680	9632120	End region locking and Nintendo region free are some hashtags.
9633240	9638200	There's, um, let's see, some posts on Miiverse as well, which are actually kind of funny.
9638200	9640520	Like, I love some of these Miiverse posts.
9640520	9643800	I love the one of Monita with, uh, region free, please.
9643800	9644440	That's great.
9645080	9647960	And then like a picture of Reggie Fils-Aime, I guess that's supposed to be him.
9647960	9649880	My body is region free.
9649880	9654600	So it's kind of clever that they're, uh, taking to Miiverse to put some of their opinions.
9654600	9655480	It won't happen.
9655480	9656520	No, it probably won't happen.
9657080	9659320	You know, the thing is, is that Nintendo seems to be really,
9660920	9663960	they seem to be trying to bring over a lot of stuff that, you know,
9663960	9665400	maybe in the past they wouldn't have.
9665400	9669000	I mean, Fire Emblem is the thing that we can basically expect at this point,
9669000	9672600	but also like Bravely Default, you know, that was kind of uncertain,
9672600	9674520	but Nintendo is helping bring that over.
9674520	9679640	So even though it would be nice if the Wii U was region free,
9679640	9682920	I think that Nintendo is really trying to listen to gamers
9682920	9687560	and know that they want these games that are, that are over in Japan.
9688680	9689240	Let's hope.
9690280	9690680	All right.
9690680	9694520	Well, that brings us closer and closer to the end of the show,
9694520	9697640	but, uh, we are going to open up the Skype line right now
9697640	9699880	to get some of your voices here on the show.
9699880	9704040	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9704040	9704920	That's all one word.
9704920	9707160	We are taking your calls right now.
9707160	9708840	We'll get to some Twitter topics as well.
9708840	9710280	And also any last minute stories.
9710280	9713400	I don't know if Dark Soccer or Loki have anything they want to get out real quick.
9713400	9715160	I think I just have, I want to get out of the heat.
9716360	9720040	Sim City has a wonderful new piece of DLC for $9.
9720040	9721080	It's Zeppelin's.
9722200	9727960	You get, you get an airship and a hot air balloon park as an, uh, basic.
9728200	9729880	Is it piloted by a guy named Sid?
9729880	9730600	I don't know.
9730600	9735320	Hot air balloon park or an airship and an airship mass transit option.
9735320	9735880	$9.
9735880	9737480	That's all you get for $9.
9737480	9739560	Will it explode like the Hindenburg did?
9739560	9742280	I mean, I mean, not to be in poor taste, but.
9742280	9743080	Too soon, Rob.
9743080	9743560	Too soon.
9743560	9744840	Thanks to the power of cloud.
9744840	9747160	Part of Sim City is disasters, right?
9747800	9748200	Yeah.
9748200	9749640	Sim City was a disaster.
9751960	9752600	Oh boy.
9752600	9754520	It wouldn't be the same without the reporter.
9754520	9754840	All right.
9754840	9756920	Let's go to the phones because we do have calls coming in.
9756920	9757880	Hi, you're on orange songs radio.
9757880	9758280	Who's this?
9758920	9759400	Hello.
9760120	9760360	Hello.
9760360	9761320	It's code man.
9761320	9762040	Hey, code man.
9762040	9762520	How you doing?
9763160	9764440	I haven't called in in a while.
9764440	9765480	I was going to say a long time.
9765480	9765880	No talk.
9765880	9767080	What's on your mind, buddy?
9767080	9769880	Well, you know, it's, it's busy everywhere.
9770520	9773160	Real life is not allowed to get in the way of OLR.
9773160	9773480	Okay.
9773480	9774120	Thanks.
9774120	9774840	It never does.
9775880	9776680	Good answer.
9776680	9777560	What's up, buddy?
9778280	9783240	Um, no, I was just calling, um, about the whole YouTube thing earlier because,
9783240	9786440	you know, I, I'm your friendly neighborhood YouTuber, I guess.
9787000	9794280	Um, but, uh, they, they're actually starting to monetize for minutes watched now.
9794280	9800200	So like, it's not so much your video anymore as it is the minutes of like,
9800200	9801960	how long somebody watches your video.
9803720	9805880	So, so, I mean, it's, it's really, I don't know.
9805880	9811000	They keep changing it, but, um, to say something about, I believe square enix
9811000	9817160	or Squeenix as a lot of people say, um, is they did that for a really long time.
9817160	9820280	They would take, they wouldn't let anyone put any of their games up,
9820280	9823480	which I always see it as free advertisement for the company.
9823480	9826280	But I mean, you're playing their game.
9826280	9827080	People are watching it.
9827080	9829000	They say, Oh, you know, this is a really good game.
9829000	9829800	I want to buy it.
9829800	9832920	So then they go out and buy it and then that's free advertisement.
9832920	9836520	So to me, that's, I mean, that's the way, but I see, I see where everybody's
9836520	9839720	coming from, where, you know, you're playing this game, you're, you're
9839720	9845160	claiming it as your own video, but it's actually just your voice over
9845160	9847160	something else that somebody else made.
9847160	9852440	And I can understand that, but, but yeah, that's, I just want to call in
9852440	9854760	and, uh, kind of, cause I, cause I missed that whole conversation.
9854760	9859640	I had to go put the girl down to sleep, but, uh, but yeah, I just wanted to
9859640	9862280	kind of call in and talk about that a little bit.
9862280	9863000	No worries.
9863000	9865800	Um, you probably aren't surprised to hear that people make a living off
9865800	9867000	those let's play videos though.
9867000	9867500	Right?
9868220	9873100	Um, there's a lot of people, uh, out there, a lot of really, really big
9873100	9878860	YouTubers that make a huge, huge killing off of, uh, off of just doing
9878860	9882220	let's plays and doing, uh, Minecraft's real big right now.
9882220	9885260	Uh, there's, there's just tons of people out there making so much money
9885260	9886140	off of that.
9886140	9890780	And yeah, to an extent you make a lot of money, but I don't really think
9890780	9895420	unless, unless you partner with a third party, I don't really think, which
9895420	9897740	sometimes you kind of get screwed out of that money too.
9897740	9902780	So, you know, either way, if you, if you manage yourself correctly on
9902780	9907100	YouTube, I think you can make a good amount of money, but other than that,
9907100	9911260	I do it just to do it and, and, you know, to show people what I'm playing
9911260	9913020	and, you know, all that stuff.
9913020	9915180	I mean, I don't do it for the money obviously, cause I'm not making
9915180	9919900	anything from it, but, um, but it's just fun to do to me and I love video
9919900	9920940	editing and all that stuff.
9920940	9921980	So that's what it's got.
9921980	9923260	It's like podcasting.
9923260	9925660	And I've said this before on an earlier show, if you don't love it, what
9925660	9926860	the hell are you doing?
9926860	9927500	Well, exactly.
9927500	9931100	If you get into YouTube to make money, you're getting into the, you're
9931100	9932380	getting into the wrong reasons.
9932380	9935500	It's like those companies that are like, we need to hire an agency to make
9935500	9936620	a viral video.
9936620	9940300	Um, you don't force something to go viral that has to like happen, you
9940300	9940540	know?
9940540	9941100	Well, no.
9941100	9942540	Yeah, that's, that's totally true.
9942540	9944140	And you know, that's, that's great.
9944140	9949100	Oh, and I also wanted to say, I, you will have a, a buffer from, uh, from
9949100	9953180	a one-year-old, uh, well, actually from a, well, she'll be two probably
9953180	9957020	by the time that I make the buffer, but I got her to say orange today,
9957020	9959820	but, uh, she has to put all of them together.
9959820	9961900	I haven't got adorable.
9963100	9965740	So that's, that should be fantastic.
9965740	9966940	So excited to hear it.
9968060	9968380	All right.
9968380	9971260	Uh, yeah, that's, I think that's about it really.
9971260	9975900	Uh, so, I mean, yeah, I just, I was up late tonight, so I thought I'd
9975900	9977500	give you guys a call cause I haven't talked to you in a while.
9977900	9978940	Always good to hear from you.
9978940	9979100	Yeah.
9979100	9980380	Always good to hear from you.
9980380	9982140	Uh, you, it's, it's good to hear from you.
9982140	9985500	You take care and, uh, I hope everybody's doing well out there in Oklahoma.
9985500	9988620	I'm glad to see you've been okay throughout all the, I mean, here I am
9988620	9989660	bitching about the heat.
9989660	9990700	That was a bad pun.
9990700	9992380	At least I don't have what I didn't even.
9992380	9993180	He's okay.
9993180	9994540	Oh God, shut up.
9994540	9996940	At least I don't have these tornadoes running through my backyard.
9996940	10000300	So I'm, I'm glad to hear you're all right with all that.
10000300	10002060	We're getting the heat right now too.
10002060	10006540	We're, I think today we got probably a high of 101, which is not a whole, I
10006540	10011180	mean, it's not big here, but I mean, um, we're not getting tornadoes and
10011180	10012460	that's all that we care about.
10012460	10016940	Although I am getting a shelter put in, um, in September, I think.
10016940	10018620	So that's good.
10018620	10021740	All right, buddy, I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls, but, uh,
10021740	10022300	stay safe.
10023100	10023500	All right.
10023500	10027100	You guys keep, keep making the podcast for another 16 years.
10027100	10027660	How about that?
10027660	10028540	We'll try.
10028540	10028860	All right.
10029420	10029820	All right.
10029820	10030380	We'll see you.
10030380	10030620	All right.
10030620	10031580	Bye bye.
10032620	10033580	16 years.
10033580	10034780	I will be 50.
10034780	10036940	I don't know about that.
10036940	10037580	All right, we'll see.
10037580	10039260	All right, let's go to some more calls.
10039260	10040540	We have phones ringing tonight.
10040540	10041580	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
10041580	10041980	Who's this?
10042860	10044380	Uh, this is Zormay.
10044380	10045020	Zormay.
10045020	10045820	Hey, Zormay.
10045820	10047420	I don't think, have you called the show before?
10047420	10048300	I don't recognize your name.
10048300	10051820	Uh, yeah, I called a few times back in the day.
10051820	10052780	Oh, back in the day.
10052780	10053500	Well, welcome back.
10053500	10054380	What's on your mind, buddy?
10055260	10060700	Um, I know you guys are average gamers of, uh, Final Fantasy 11 and now that
10060700	10064300	Final Fantasy 14 has come out and it looks like it's going to be pretty good.
10064300	10065100	I've been playing it.
10065100	10065980	Have you guys?
10066620	10067340	Absolutely.
10067340	10068700	You might've missed the beginning of the show.
10068700	10070220	I was talking a bit about it.
10070220	10071100	Uh, that's all right.
10071100	10075020	We, we actually, all of us, except Slidekick, you haven't been able to play it, right?
10075020	10077740	No, not lately, but I did play in like an earlier phase.
10077740	10078060	Okay.
10078060	10078380	Yeah.
10078380	10078620	Yeah.
10078620	10079580	We've all been playing it.
10079580	10081340	I, I especially have been playing it.
10081340	10082540	I, I really love it.
10082540	10086700	Uh, I have, uh, two classes at 16 on my character that's going to get deleted in
10086700	10090700	a week anyway, but I'm having a lot of fun just exploring this gorgeous game.
10090700	10091980	That's very fan servicey.
10093100	10093660	No.
10093660	10097740	Did you, you said that the game is going to delete your, uh, your, uh, I don't
10097740	10098620	know if that's official.
10099260	10104620	Um, it's, it's out there that right now we're in what's called beta phase three
10104620	10107820	and they have said that they're going to wipe the characters at the end of beta
10107820	10108620	phase three.
10108620	10113340	We just don't know when the end is, but before the original official release of
10113340	10116940	the game, there is another character wipe slotted because there's going to be beta
10116940	10121500	phase four, which is open beta where everybody's going to get to play.
10121500	10126460	And they did say about beta phase four that they're going to try and, uh, let
10126460	10128380	those characters carry into the live game.
10128380	10131100	But they did clearly say so that people don't about it.
10131100	10134700	If it happens, another character wipe at the end of all the betas still may have
10134700	10135260	to occur.
10135260	10137820	So we may still be looking at two character wipes.
10137820	10141500	So don't get too attached to your character, but that's, I mean, considering
10141500	10144220	they haven't even opened up our arcanist as a job yet.
10144220	10148060	And I mean, you have to, I think have a 1.0 character or something.
10148060	10150940	I mean, consider we don't have all of that in there yet.
10150940	10151900	I'm okay with them.
10151900	10154300	I mean, it is a beta is a beta, not a demo.
10155420	10157100	Well, yeah, that's, that's the whole thing.
10157100	10162140	I think I've been enjoying playing different characters and it's been quite
10162140	10167820	fun because there's just so many different customizations and, um, that
10167820	10169580	whole, what do you think about the free company?
10169580	10173420	That's what I want because a lot of people see that you have link shells as
10173420	10175580	well, but there's no need for them because you're a free company.
10175580	10175740	Yeah.
10175740	10178940	I haven't been able to test that yet because I don't even really understand it
10178940	10182220	is that you have, uh, you have like the link shells or the little like sub
10182220	10185500	guilds, but then the free company is like your huge chat channel.
10185500	10185740	Right.
10185740	10188300	It's like you have big guilds and little guilds as a part of that.
10188300	10188620	Right.
10189420	10189740	Right.
10189740	10190380	It's so weird.
10190380	10196940	Basically like it's, it's like, you're able to go ahead and make, make a,
10196940	10200620	make a group of people a little bit more organized where you can have like
10200620	10205340	cadets and I'm not too sure, but like people are who are in your officers.
10205340	10208220	You have like cadets and you have like commanders or some sort of thing like
10208220	10213500	that and they can basically distribute money and gill and based off of like
10213500	10215100	their prestige inside the link shell.
10215100	10216620	I mean inside the free company.
10217180	10221660	I don't know exactly on too much detail about it, but it's more than just a
10221660	10223340	glorified link shell though.
10223340	10227020	My understanding, especially coming from World of Warcraft, which I've played
10227020	10231500	for a long time and I'm still continuing to play throughout Final Fantasy 14.
10231500	10235020	You had a lot of big guilds in World of Warcraft that had several rating
10235020	10235500	groups in it.
10235580	10239740	In fact, my own guild for a time that I was reading with had infamously to an
10239740	10242460	extent, two rating groups in it, raid group one and raid group two.
10242460	10244780	And that actually is what kind of drove that guild apart.
10244780	10247900	But you know, I would think that maybe with the free company set up, you would
10247900	10251100	still have like that, but then like each raid team would have its own little
10251100	10254220	link shell in it for, you know, raid nights and stuff like that.
10255500	10257100	It's interesting though, the way they're doing that.
10258140	10263980	Yeah, I do think is going to be great for organization because I don't know how,
10263980	10268140	well, I do know actually you, you, you played Final Fantasy 11, but you didn't
10268140	10271180	play it to extent where you were like in an end game.
10271180	10272780	No, I never got that far.
10272780	10276380	I played for years and never got a character past like 56.
10276380	10278700	I think it was the highest I ever got crazy.
10278700	10279020	All right.
10279020	10284540	So at the like, so if me, I had a couple of jobs, like it's level 75 and it was
10284540	10290940	kind of difficult, um, distributing, um, gill and prizes and, um, drops
10290940	10294140	throughout the several instances like dynamics and stuff like that.
10294140	10298620	So I think it'll make it a lot easier for people to just know and who is who
10298620	10299580	going forward.
10299580	10303340	I'm a little bit worried because of, it's a lot of jobs and you know, things
10303340	10308220	can get nerfed, like how Lancer got nerfed when Samurai Dragoon tend to go
10308220	10308860	out of hand.
10308860	10311500	I don't think you remember that with the Penta thrusts.
10311500	10312220	Yep, I do.
10312780	10313180	Yeah.
10313180	10315980	So it's, I don't know, I'm still waiting.
10315980	10317900	I mean, like, we'll see how things go.
10317980	10321020	I mean, uh, did you play the first one?
10321740	10323900	Yes, I did play 1.0.
10323900	10325580	I played at the very, very beginning.
10325580	10330220	I played the beta for 1.0 and then I played, uh, the very, very early version
10330220	10332940	or when it first came out and I hated it.
10332940	10337580	And, uh, I tried playing later, uh, after they opened it up and said, all
10337580	10339020	right, we're not charging a monthly fee anymore.
10339020	10341900	I want to say it was like January, February the next year.
10341900	10346060	And it was still like, it just, it wasn't, it was, it made me go back and
10346060	10347820	play 11 for a little bit.
10348700	10349340	Wow.
10349340	10351020	But, um, yeah, I felt the same way.
10351020	10354700	I mean, it was kind of weird the way the auction house wasn't available.
10354700	10360540	And, um, there was no, like, no directions.
10360540	10361180	Crazy.
10361180	10365020	But, um, okay, quickly, before I let you go, um, what, since you were a player
10365020	10368380	of 11 for so long, what do you think of 14 having come from 11?
10369020	10371100	Um, I'm, I'm excited.
10371100	10375740	Um, I'm taking my time, you know, because, you know, when I played for
10375740	10378620	the 11, I didn't really know what I was, I wanted to do.
10378620	10382140	I kind of had like a warrior and we found that we had lack of white mages.
10382140	10385340	So I had to go back and kind of like build up a white mage.
10385340	10389340	I'm playing like as many jobs as possible on several different servers
10389340	10392060	and just trying to get a basic understanding of the game.
10392620	10395100	I'm pretty sure, I'm pretty sure I want to be a scholar.
10395100	10397900	So I'm hoping Arcanist is open soon.
10397900	10398300	Oh God.
10398300	10401740	I'm hoping they open soon so I can see it before the real game goes live,
10401740	10402620	but we'll see.
10402620	10405100	But anyway, I have to let you go, but thank you so much for the call.
10405100	10405820	Good to hear from you.
10405820	10407900	And I'll, I'll always talk MMOs with people.
10408540	10409180	No problem.
10409180	10409740	Take care.
10409740	10410380	Take care, buddy.
10410380	10410880	Bye.
10411580	10412460	All right.
10412460	10412780	Good call.
10412780	10415900	I love hearing from people tonight is people we haven't heard from in a while
10415900	10417100	night, apparently.
10417820	10418380	All right.
10418380	10419420	You all right over there, Loki?
10419420	10420060	You're giggling.
10420060	10425900	I love these like battlefield three animated GIFs because it just, I kind of
10426540	10427040	played even.
10427740	10428460	Yes.
10428460	10431180	I want to play it even more because it looks so glitchy.
10431180	10436460	Sometimes like this guy snipes a jet, makes it blow up in front of his face
10436460	10437100	and nothing happens.
10437100	10441420	So a one eight seven seven game or a username on Skype, orange lounge radio,
10441420	10442140	all one word.
10442140	10443820	We'll try to squeeze in at least one more call.
10444460	10447820	I wanted to do a Twitter topic that came in here from a tiger claw,
10447820	10448700	send us a tweet.
10448700	10449340	What is it here?
10450300	10453260	Nintendo defends the rapid release of new Mario game.
10453260	10455500	Although our phone lines are lighting up our, I'll come back to this in a
10455580	10456780	minute for now.
10456780	10457820	Let's go to the Skype line.
10457820	10458860	Hi, you're on orange launch radio.
10458860	10459360	Who's this?
10460860	10461660	Hello.
10461660	10462160	Hello.
10462940	10466540	Oh, we have a, we have a CT and Gigi here.
10466540	10467260	Oh my gosh.
10467260	10468140	You guys are together.
10468140	10469820	It's a, it's a cam thing though.
10469820	10473100	Although all I see is like half of dark Tetsuya's head, but that's okay.
10473100	10473900	What's up you guys?
10475020	10476140	Oh, not a whole lot.
10476140	10478540	You know, just been hanging out, playing a lot of games.
10478540	10479040	Yeah.
10479660	10480540	Good times.
10480540	10481260	Like what games?
10481260	10483260	I got sucked into unepic.
10483260	10484940	That game is so fun.
10484940	10485500	Unepic.
10486060	10486560	Yeah.
10487100	10488460	Tell us a little bit about that one.
10489100	10490300	Um, it's pretty fun.
10490300	10491980	It's like a dungeon crawler.
10492700	10493740	Oh, okay.
10494460	10494940	Cool.
10494940	10497260	That's like a Metroidvania type thing.
10497260	10499260	Uh, I'm here for that.
10499260	10501340	Is that free or is that like?
10501340	10503580	Um, it's $7.99 on Steam.
10503580	10504380	Ooh, that's not bad.
10504940	10505580	All right.
10505580	10505980	Okay.
10505980	10507820	I'll, I'll have to write that one down.
10507820	10508380	Very cool.
10510300	10512460	So I'm looking at pictures actually.
10512460	10513580	It does look kind of neat.
10513580	10516700	It is very Castlevania like with big dragons.
10518060	10518300	Yeah.
10518300	10523420	And you can like level up your character with, with, um, each there's a bar at the top that
10523420	10525740	has like a level leveling system.
10525740	10531420	And with each level, you can put it into weapons or your, um, or, or yourself, like to get
10531420	10533980	more, um, stamina and whatnot.
10533980	10534860	It's pretty fun.
10534860	10535980	That looks super fun.
10535980	10537980	I think I am going to check that out.
10537980	10538620	That's awesome.
10539740	10540300	Yeah.
10540300	10541020	Very cool.
10541020	10544140	So did you guys just call in to get me sucked into a new game and make me spend $8?
10544860	10545100	Yeah.
10546540	10547340	Yeah.
10547340	10548140	Well, congrats.
10548940	10550860	We're like, we need to suck them into another game.
10550860	10551020	Yeah.
10551660	10551900	Yeah.
10551900	10555180	Cause I haven't been talking about how I've been playing Final Fantasy 14 literally all
10555180	10556140	weekend long.
10556140	10557580	Just updated League of Legends.
10557580	10557900	Oh yeah.
10557900	10559020	I got time for another one.
10559020	10559500	That's all right.
10559500	10560060	Bring it.
10560060	10560460	Jelly.
10560460	10564060	I want to get, I was trying to get into the beta, but I don't think I made it.
10564060	10564700	Good news.
10564700	10566140	Beta four is going to be open.
10566140	10567580	Anyone who wants to play can play it.
10568540	10570940	And then I heard about, um, the pricing system.
10570940	10574060	Is that already, have they already fixed it or?
10574060	10578220	Uh, you don't have to pay for it yet, but when the game goes live on August 27th, I
10578220	10581100	believe it's $12.95 a month is the lower tier.
10581100	10584060	And then like $14.95 for eight characters or something.
10584620	10585500	Don't quote me on that.
10586460	10587660	That seems pretty legit.
10587660	10591020	Like I think I can work that into my budget because I want that game so bad.
10591020	10591260	Yeah.
10591260	10591820	It's going to be fun.
10592380	10597820	Oh, cause I started playing, um, final fantasy back when seven came out.
10599260	10604460	So unfortunately I was never able to really play the online ones, but I've been a fan
10604460	10605580	ever since seven.
10607420	10609580	Well, there's a lot of fan service in 14.
10610700	10610940	Yeah.
10611900	10612380	All right.
10612380	10613260	Moogles.
10613260	10613580	All right.
10613580	10618060	Well you guys, you have fun and uh, go find another game for me to get addicted to.
10619500	10619900	All right.
10619900	10620700	Take care guys.
10622140	10622380	Bye.
10623100	10626300	Video calls are always fun, even though I can only see like half of each of their head,
10626300	10627580	but it worked.
10627580	10628080	All right.
10629020	10630860	Uh, one eight seven seven game.
10630860	10633100	All our username on Skype is orange lounge radio.
10633100	10633500	What do you say?
10633500	10635100	It's like, Hey, can we try to fit in one more call?
10635100	10635500	Yeah.
10635500	10638380	Someone new needs to call someone new.
10638380	10639420	Someone new.
10639420	10639740	We'll see.
10639740	10641740	We'll see what happens when I challenge you.
10642620	10643500	All right.
10643500	10645580	Listeners of OLR be somebody new.
10645580	10646140	Be quick.
10646140	10647820	Cause there's been a lot of people trying to get through.
10647820	10649900	That's why I'm going to allow one more call to squeeze in here.
10650380	10651100	Uh, let's see.
10651100	10654860	Oh, I was going to read the tiger claw tweet that said Nintendo defends the rapid release
10654860	10656380	of new Mario games.
10656380	10663020	Um, quote, who's this quote from Nintendo of America, senior director of corporate communications,
10663020	10663580	Mario game.
10663580	10667740	Uh, we think we're putting out the right number of Mario games based on what fans are asking
10667740	10671020	for based on what our own developers, creative visions are.
10671020	10674460	The key to that is as long as there's innovation occurring within the gameplay, as long as
10674460	10678300	there's new features, then marrying the characters and the IPs that people love is the right
10678300	10679740	call from our standpoint.
10679820	10681580	But the phone is ringing again, so let's go to it.
10681580	10681740	Hi.
10681740	10682620	You're on orange launch radio.
10682620	10683020	Who's this?
10683820	10684940	Uh, name and lights.
10684940	10686220	Name and lights.
10686220	10689500	Although it's ironic because your icon is just a solid black square.
10690780	10691500	It is.
10691500	10692860	Well, at least that's, that's what I'm seeing.
10692860	10693100	I don't know.
10693100	10695820	Maybe it's not supposed to be, but yeah, I do not see your name in lights.
10695820	10696700	That's supposed to be.
10696700	10697420	Oh, oops.
10697420	10697820	So well.
10697820	10697980	All right.
10697980	10698780	Well, what's on your mind?
10700220	10702540	This is the first time I've listened to the show live.
10703100	10705980	Well, I was going to say, I recognize your name, but I don't think you've ever called
10705980	10706780	well, dark soccer.
10706780	10707100	There you go.
10707100	10708060	You got your new person.
10708060	10708700	Yay.
10708700	10709180	All right.
10709660	10710540	Thank you.
10710540	10711740	Well, uh, what do you think?
10713180	10713980	Uh, interesting.
10714620	10714860	Okay.
10715420	10718860	I've been, I've been listening to the, uh, uh, orange loans for years.
10718860	10722940	Oh, well, and you, you just now were able to make it to a live show?
10722940	10724220	Usually busy on Sunday nights?
10724700	10726300	Uh, normally I'm sleeping.
10726300	10727660	This is flipping late for me.
10727660	10728460	Oh my gosh.
10728460	10729260	We have a lot of people.
10729260	10731100	Code man said earlier, he was staying up late.
10731100	10735580	I guess a lot of people maybe for the 4th of July week kind of have a lot less going
10735580	10735740	on.
10735740	10736140	I don't know.
10736700	10740060	You may remember me from a couple of the messages I sent you privately.
10740780	10741340	Perhaps.
10742540	10743900	My wife passed away.
10743900	10746060	Yes, yes, yes I do.
10746060	10746460	I do.
10746460	10746860	Of course.
10746860	10749660	I recognize that and I'm very sorry to hear that.
10749660	10751020	Yeah, we're Facebook buddies too.
10751020	10752220	Yeah, we're all Facebook friends.
10752220	10752540	Yeah.
10752540	10752700	Yeah.
10753260	10756860	So well, I just got back in the gaming again.
10756860	10757660	Yeah.
10757660	10758540	What have you been playing?
10760060	10760620	Warcraft.
10761820	10764460	Like, like old school Warcraft or World of Warcraft?
10764460	10765100	World of Warcraft.
10765100	10765820	World of Warcraft.
10765900	10767340	I'm in the Hoard House Guild.
10767340	10767660	Yeah, yeah.
10767660	10769900	No, I knew you were over there in the Hoard House Guild.
10769900	10773740	Thank you for being loyal to the Hoard House Guild because unfortunately a lot of people
10773740	10778220	have quit WoW for things like Final Fantasy XIV or League or whatever it is.
10778220	10779100	For real life.
10779100	10781340	I mean, I was off a month.
10781340	10781980	Yeah.
10781980	10783740	Well, understandably so, but.
10783740	10786940	I was actually sort of thinking about rebuilding my subscription except that.
10787580	10788700	Now you have Animal Crossing.
10788700	10789740	I have Animal Crossing.
10789740	10790060	Yeah.
10790060	10791740	What do you like to do in World of Warcraft?
10793100	10795500	Right now I'm leveling a new monk.
10795500	10795820	Nice.
10797340	10800780	I deleted the monk that I was, because my wife used to play.
10801980	10806060	And she wanted to play, but when she had the stroke, she couldn't see.
10807820	10817900	So I spent three solid weeks farming for the Vial of the Sands so I could fly her around.
10819500	10822940	And it literally took me forever.
10822940	10827580	Yeah, those things were a pain in the ass to get, but they're great for being able to.
10827580	10827740	Yeah.
10828460	10831980	And for those that don't know, because not everybody speaks Warcraft, the Vial of the
10831980	10837180	Sands is a mount that you can basically turn yourself into a dragon, but another player
10837180	10840300	can ride on your back to get your minds out of the gutter people.
10840300	10843260	They can ride on your back and you can fly them to places.
10843260	10843980	So it's really great.
10843980	10847900	It's like if you have a low level character, you're like, Oh, you need to get to Thunder
10847900	10850460	Bluff or a town that might be far for you to walk to.
10850460	10851260	Get on my back.
10851260	10851580	Let's go.
10851580	10857580	And it was 300 flying too, so if you had a lower level character, you could still take
10857580	10858940	him at what, epic speed, right?
10858940	10860060	Yeah, you could.
10860780	10868620	Yeah, so when I was off for five weeks taking care of her after the stroke, I upped my Warcraft
10868620	10873820	and the only thing I did was farm archaeology to get the recipe.
10874860	10879340	And she passed away three days after I got it.
10879820	10880620	Hmm.
10880620	10882140	But at least you got it.
10883420	10883900	Yeah, I did.
10883900	10887900	But I never had a chance for her to use it.
10887900	10888860	I'm sorry to hear that.
10890140	10891580	So I pretty much stopped.
10891580	10891900	Wow.
10891900	10897580	I deleted the monk that I leveled with her and it was tough to get back in.
10898300	10898540	Yeah.
10901100	10906460	Has getting in, I hate to dwell on what might be a difficult topic, but has this been a
10906540	10913420	way for you to kind of help get back into after such a tragedy as video games kind of
10913420	10918220	helped you a little bit in getting back into what might have been your routine before?
10919980	10928940	It took a while to get back into it because I was trying to play after she passed away,
10928940	10933820	but I just couldn't play more than a few minutes without getting irritatedly bored and just
10933820	10934780	shutting it off.
10934780	10935020	Yeah.
10935580	10938860	So I didn't up my account until very recently.
10941020	10943660	And I named a character after her.
10944620	10947580	It's a great way to memorialize somebody.
10947580	10949500	I know of other people that have done that in WoW.
10949500	10950220	Absolutely.
10950220	10955100	And I know that even the developers, you know, when people that they were close to that were
10955100	10958940	involved in the game, they've immortalized them in the game too.
10958940	10959260	Yes.
10959260	10961740	There's some really great memorial.
10962060	10967100	Usually this is more for people that were really part of the WoW community and heavy
10967100	10971420	raiders and stuff, but they have set up tributes.
10971420	10973260	Blizzard has kind of done that in the game.
10973260	10976780	And there's some really great compilations out there on YouTube.
10976780	10983180	I know somebody that had this for somebody that they were married to.
10983180	10988140	And yeah, really great when the companies kind of do that.
10988220	10994060	I mean, it just really emphasizes the community that an MMO game and what really makes those
10994060	10995980	games great is the community.
10995980	10999820	So yeah, it's been hard.
10999820	11004540	This has been the last couple of months have been ridiculously hard.
11004540	11004780	Right.
11005900	11006300	Of course.
11007260	11012620	I'm not even going to sit here and try to imagine, but you know, you got friends here
11012620	11018860	at OLR and at the voice against network and in out there on in Facebook land and on the
11018860	11021980	internet that are trying to help you through it.
11021980	11026060	I hope it's getting a little better every day.
11027340	11028140	Except for today.
11028700	11031100	Oh, I got my eviction notice today.
11031100	11031740	Oh, my God.
11035180	11036140	I don't know what to say.
11037500	11038220	Yeah.
11038220	11038540	Yeah.
11039340	11041580	I probably should start a support group.
11041660	11042940	Well, but I don't know.
11042940	11043100	Yeah.
11044300	11046940	I need bad news to stop happening to our listeners.
11046940	11049020	This is this is this is bad.
11051100	11057820	Gosh, I don't know what we can do to help, but I knew this was coming.
11057820	11061180	I knew when she passed away, I wasn't going to be able to afford the house that we have.
11061180	11065980	So what goes around comes around.
11065980	11067740	So I got the eviction notice.
11067740	11068460	It opened a beer.
11068460	11072220	When in doubt, when in doubt, why not?
11072780	11073820	All right, buddy.
11073820	11075020	Well, we're all thinking of you.
11075020	11077660	And good luck pulling through, pulling through, you know.
11078860	11080220	I mean, I love the show.
11080220	11081180	I love listening.
11081180	11083260	I love I love Hoard House.
11084140	11085660	I'm I'm an avid listener.
11085660	11088220	This is the first time I've actually had a chance to be up this late.
11089260	11091980	My buddy was helping me pack up some stuff tonight.
11091980	11093820	It's the only reason why I'm still up.
11093820	11094060	Sure.
11094700	11095500	He took off.
11095740	11099020	I just decided to turn the show on.
11099020	11103500	You know, I know you guys, you know, usually end around twelve, one o'clock Eastern time
11103500	11104940	because I am on the East Coast.
11106140	11109820	But, you know, I listen to you guys on a regular basis for years now.
11109820	11111900	I just never have a chance to listen live.
11111900	11113900	Well, I'm glad you could make it out tonight.
11113900	11116060	I just wish the circumstances have been a little better.
11116060	11118940	But, you know, you can send me a message anytime on Facebook.
11118940	11124060	Not not to be one of those like like super hippie mega happy people.
11124060	11129420	But, you know, I do believe very much so that when when one door closes, another opens,
11129420	11133100	like when I was laid off from my job several years ago, it was like the end of the world
11133100	11135500	to me and I was worried about a lot of things.
11135500	11139820	But I ended up getting a career I've been at for 12 years now since then.
11139820	11147180	I mean, I mean, I mean, not to get all preachy and everything when she was happiest ever
11147180	11147900	as a teacher.
11149420	11153900	She was teaching CNAs, which is certified nursing assistants.
11154380	11155740	She loved her job.
11156380	11157500	She was an RN.
11158860	11162140	You know, she was two credits away from being a bachelor's.
11162940	11169100	And, you know, when she lost that job because they changed the qualifications for the job,
11169100	11172540	I just simply told her that it's like, you know what, I'll support you.
11172540	11173740	I'll do whatever it takes.
11174700	11178540	Just, you know, go back to school, get your education
11178540	11181580	and get more education than the person that just fired you.
11184220	11185660	And that's what she was going to do.
11186540	11187020	She was...
11190220	11191340	Sorry, but...
11191340	11192460	No, I understand.
11195660	11196620	Cinco de Mayo.
11199340	11200780	She wanted to go back to the school.
11203500	11206140	Well, you're getting a lot of support from our chat room right now.
11206140	11208620	You know, act deaf saying if there's anything we can help you out with,
11208620	11210300	the VOG community is there to help you.
11211100	11213420	E-hugs all around from Degenerate Johnny.
11213420	11219980	And I know it's really tough.
11219980	11223100	She was supposed to start school on the 5th,
11224220	11230220	and I told her that the module wasn't going to open up on the 5th because it was a holiday.
11233980	11238460	She went to school on Monday and passed away on Tuesday.
11240300	11252220	Well, you're getting the world's biggest hug from our chat room right now for this,
11252220	11253660	you know, all over the place.
11253660	11261260	But how great that you were helping her to achieve this and, you know,
11261260	11263420	come out of the circumstance better.
11263420	11267180	And I know wherever she is right now, she's thanking you big time for it.
11268140	11271500	So getting a lot of really horrible two months.
11272140	11272940	I know.
11272940	11274940	I bet I was glad May was over with.
11274940	11277420	But June is just June's gone.
11277980	11279100	It is June.
11279100	11281180	Oh, it is July, isn't it?
11282460	11283180	Tomorrow.
11283180	11284540	Well, today for East Coast.
11285100	11289260	Yeah, it's just she went back to school one day.
11293580	11295740	But you helped her get back to school.
11295740	11296140	You did.
11297420	11299820	Well, all she wanted to do was become a teacher.
11301820	11302620	And you know what?
11302620	11306700	My mom was a teacher, so it's a great profession.
11306700	11307980	I'm actually a corporate trainer.
11307980	11309420	It's a great profession.
11309420	11310780	It's an admirable thing.
11310780	11312060	I love my job.
11312060	11312560	Absolutely.
11314140	11315980	Well, I'm going to let you go.
11315980	11316480	Sure.
11316860	11317180	All right.
11318140	11326700	I'll try to listen again live again when the dust settles and I'll stay in touch.
11326700	11326940	All right.
11326940	11328940	Please do stay on Facebook.
11328940	11329500	I will.
11329500	11329900	Okay.
11329900	11330220	All right.
11330220	11330780	You take care.
11330780	11331500	We're all thinking of you.
11331500	11331900	All right.
11331900	11332380	Bye bye.
11332380	11332880	Bye.
11333820	11334620	Oh, how's that?
11335900	11336780	Tough call.
11336780	11338540	I need someone to cut.
11339340	11339980	Quick, Loki.
11339980	11341020	I need a fart joke.
11341020	11342700	Quick, help me.
11343820	11344220	You know what?
11344220	11344940	Know what?
11344940	11348140	I have happy, happy because look at the chat room.
11348140	11349580	I mean, yeah, for real.
11349580	11350540	Seriously, for real.
11350540	11355340	And you know, there's even I'm sure a lot of people are like, wow, that was a heavy call.
11355340	11356540	And yes, it was a heavy call.
11356540	11360620	But when we say when we say we're there for people, we kind of like mean it and shit.
11360620	11361120	So.
11361580	11367580	And the biggest thing that me that I like to do for people is I like to find if there's
11367580	11372700	a tough situation, I like to find research, everything that has to do with it and offer
11372700	11377900	options because especially when you're in the middle of a situation, there's not always
11377900	11380540	things that occur to you when you're in that situation.
11381180	11386220	And like when Dan and I were, you know, you because, you know, when we got our notice
11386220	11393900	for the house that we were staying in rent free, we had to move like in a week and it
11393900	11397580	was people helping us and giving us options that opened the door for us, too.
11397580	11405020	So, yeah, any if you need to bounce any ideas, if you need just someone outside the situation
11405020	11407580	to help you see it clearly, let me know.
11407580	11408220	I'm happy to help.
11408700	11409820	I'm getting a little verklempt.
11409820	11411900	I have to admit it's not just the call.
11411900	11416220	I mean, but just just everything I'm seeing in chat right now is just amazing for Bobby
11416220	11417980	to be, you know, something.
11417980	11418480	Yeah.
11419660	11420780	There was a big net split.
11420780	11423020	So we just lost like a quarter of the chat room, unfortunately.
11423020	11424860	But, you know, yay, tech issues.
11425420	11425920	Hooray.
11427100	11428700	But what was I gonna say with that?
11429420	11430860	My train of thought is derailing.
11431260	11439340	This was going to say is that earlier you had that story about the kid who said the
11439340	11441260	stupid thing on the Internet and ended up in jail.
11441260	11444300	And we have a lot of these words going around the Internet sometime.
11444300	11446860	And I would never expect this of people listening to the show.
11446860	11451580	But I think one thing we need to keep in mind is that, you know, some people are playing
11451580	11457260	video games to kind of escape reality, such as the very difficult thing that he just shared
11457260	11461580	with us, which is not an easy thing to get on some radio show and talk about what happened.
11461580	11465020	So, you know, I commend him for being able to do that and keeping it together even as
11465020	11465660	much as he did.
11466540	11470780	But you never know who's going to be on the other end of that game you're playing in that
11470780	11473020	MMO or on that Xbox Live.
11473020	11476940	So, you know, have a little decency for each other.
11476940	11479020	And, you know, anyway.
11480620	11482860	Just think, do you want it being said to you?
11482860	11485420	And even more, do you want it being said to someone you care about?
11486140	11489980	So, because there's people who can take it, but they don't take it when it's somebody
11489980	11491340	that they care about.
11491340	11493420	So, yeah, just think about it that way.
11493980	11494380	All right.
11495500	11500300	Well, anyhow, do we have any other last minute stories to try and transition us back onto
11501100	11502940	the video game news we were talking about earlier?
11502940	11506860	I think, oh, yeah, I got through the Twitter topic, which was the only one that we got.
11507500	11514540	But they're selling an Earthbound Zero reproduction NES cart.
11516380	11522460	It's an English translated ROM of, you know, the game Mother.
11523020	11526140	And, of course, it never came out over here.
11526140	11531580	And I guess it's been, I don't know who's doing the reproduction of it or if it even
11531580	11531980	works.
11533580	11537260	Wasn't that the one that had the piracy enabled, though, that would let the piracy of the
11537260	11539580	anti-piracy thing that would like that was shut down the game?
11541660	11543180	Yeah, no, I know that would get harder.
11543260	11547340	But I thought Earthbound Zero even had the prototype ROM was infamous for having these
11547340	11548380	game breaking bugs in it.
11548380	11549980	But maybe the hackers fix that.
11549980	11550620	I don't remember.
11550620	11551500	It's been so long.
11551500	11552540	Hackers gonna hack.
11552540	11555420	It seems like it was so long ago that that all.
11557740	11561580	Yeah, I'm not sure if it actually does anything or if it's just a reproduction of the original.
11562460	11564380	I don't know what to say.
11564380	11567740	I never played Mother, but I always heard it was kind of a glitchy game to begin with,
11567740	11569180	like actual version.
11569900	11572380	Like, you mean the Earthbound that was on the SNES here?
11573340	11577660	Mother, Mother, I think because it wasn't finished, it was still glitchy.
11577660	11579420	Yes, absolutely.
11580140	11580540	All right.
11581500	11583500	Well, that does it for the Skype line tonight.
11583500	11584780	That does it for our Twitter topics.
11584780	11589740	I think that did it for the last minute stories as well, unless you have anything else to
11589740	11590620	surprise me with over there.
11591500	11593980	No, I know.
11594780	11595420	Okay.
11595420	11597020	I love all the Hello Kitty everywhere.
11597980	11600220	Yeah, you can thank Slidekick for some of that.
11600780	11602540	Slidekick, I want to thank you for being here.
11602540	11604300	Thank you so much for having me.
11604300	11608220	You know, I've been listening for years and I'm so glad that I finally was able to come
11608220	11609740	up and get on the show.
11609740	11610380	11 years.
11610380	11614700	You really and you really got to run the gauntlet of an OLR show tonight from the Dick and Fart
11614700	11616540	jokes and the stuff at the beginning.
11616540	11618380	It's just some real heavy stuff there at the end.
11618380	11622300	So it's like you got a whole two years worth of OLR emotions in one show.
11622300	11623340	So congratulations.
11623340	11624700	Every gamer has their voice here.
11624700	11625820	So thank you.
11625820	11627340	Yes, that's what we strive for.
11627340	11629340	So best of luck with your project.
11629340	11630060	Congratulations.
11630060	11631900	You've made it a year on gamebuoy.org.
11631900	11632400	Thank you.
11633020	11636860	And I look forward to sharing the stage with you at GamerX.
11636860	11637820	It'll be a lot of fun.
11637820	11638940	And it'll be my honor.
11638940	11640060	Everybody else.
11640060	11641020	Aw, shucks.
11641020	11642060	One more time with the plugs.
11642060	11643340	How can they find your fine show?
11643340	11648060	We're over at gamebuoy.org and you can find all our social links over there.
11648060	11649740	You can find us on iTunes.
11649740	11650860	It's game and buoy.
11650860	11652380	B-U-O-Y.
11652380	11659260	And I relinked your website on my Tumblr post.
11660140	11662220	When I did my pitch of the show today.
11662940	11664700	So you can also find it there.
11665580	11666540	We love OLR.
11666540	11668300	We love all our OLR listeners.
11668300	11671340	You know, we're usually in chat when OLR is going on.
11671340	11674460	So if you haven't checked us out yet, we'd love to hear from you.
11674460	11676780	And hope you enjoy what you hear.
11676780	11679820	We love indie podcasts, period.
11679820	11684940	I mean, I don't want to sound shady or anything, but do you think some of the corporate
11684940	11687500	cast out there could have done some of these calls we did tonight?
11687500	11688000	No.
11688880	11691280	You know, I have to do that's the difference, y'all.
11691280	11692480	That's the difference.
11692480	11697200	We might have to get Alan in here because Tim TRP in chat says we demand a fabulous
11697200	11698400	Flames reunion show.
11698400	11699120	Where's Alan?
11699920	11701680	Oh, I think he ran outside or something.
11702320	11702720	Damn.
11702720	11702960	All right.
11702960	11703520	I mean, the heat.
11704160	11704640	Yeah, maybe.
11704640	11707200	Maybe he's trying to figure out how to make it cooler in here.
11707200	11707520	All right.
11707520	11708240	Well, we do have.
11708240	11708880	Here he is.
11708880	11713440	Oh, Alan, when's the fabulous Flames reunion show, which definitely look that up on iTunes,
11713440	11713940	y'all.
11713940	11719300	It's one week after I'm in, I win $50 billion in the lottery.
11720260	11721300	We're going to win the lottery.
11721300	11721800	Yay.
11723540	11724040	All right.
11724660	11725220	That's it.
11725220	11728420	Alan, did you have a final thought for the listeners tonight before you run out?
11729300	11733060	I still think it may actually be a few degrees hotter outside than it is in here.
11733700	11734340	Sweet Jesus.
11734340	11734900	When am I?
11734900	11736580	When did I move to Phoenix?
11736580	11737080	All right.
11737620	11742100	You know what's happening, by the way, next Sunday for me, we're on the house hunt.
11742100	11743140	Oh, good luck.
11743140	11747380	Which may also, which may end up being a new dedicated studio.
11747380	11748340	That would be nice.
11748340	11749300	Not going to complain.
11749300	11749940	So.
11749940	11750440	All right.
11751220	11754580	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts so we can wrap up and head on out of here.
11754580	11756020	Again, Slidekick, thank you for being here.
11756020	11757940	Do you have an official final thought for our listeners tonight?
11759140	11760180	I want a burger.
11761380	11762100	Oh my God.
11762100	11762580	So do I.
11762580	11763460	I'm so hungry.
11763460	11764740	Burgers are pretty fucking good.
11764740	11765220	I gotta say.
11765220	11766740	I'm going to hit the drive-through on my way home.
11766740	11767240	All right.
11768340	11768900	Get it, girl.
11770260	11770420	Yeah.
11770420	11771940	You got 30 minutes to get to Pinkberry.
11771940	11772420	Ooh, girl.
11772420	11772980	All right.
11773540	11775140	Loki, uh, you're packing up.
11775140	11775860	You're ready to go.
11775860	11778900	Good luck with all your, uh, uh, disease and everything.
11778900	11780260	Hope you're cured by next week.
11780980	11784020	Make sure that you find those rats that gave you the bubonic plague.
11784900	11785460	Okay.
11785460	11785700	All right.
11785700	11786980	At least it's not herpes.
11786980	11788660	Uh, your final thought tonight.
11788660	11789620	And here's only with weather.
11789620	11790120	It's hot.
11792420	11796580	My final thought is that if you live in Northern California, you should make plans to come see
11796580	11800180	Clue at the Colonial Theater in Sacramento on July 27th.
11800180	11801220	I'm playing Colonel Mustard.
11801220	11801860	It'll be fun.
11801860	11802500	Yes, I do.
11802580	11803700	Did you finally find a tie?
11803700	11804420	I do others too.
11804420	11805300	I ordered one online.
11805300	11805620	Yes.
11805620	11809140	It's not perfect, but it's, it's, I had to get one that's a little more yellow than his
11809140	11810900	in the movie, but he is Colonel Mustard, right?
11810900	11813060	And he will be like under the screen.
11813060	11813860	Exactly.
11813860	11814740	That's what I figure.
11814740	11819780	And, and, uh, my director who happens to be the cohost of another show on this network
11819780	11820980	is like, you know what?
11821540	11823380	I'm at the point where just get it close.
11824180	11826580	And I can't, I can't blame her for that.
11826580	11826980	All right.
11826980	11829780	Um, last but not least, Dark Soccer, your final thoughts tonight?
11830740	11832820	I actually have an appetite tonight.
11832820	11836580	Like I had French toast this morning and I thought I wouldn't be hungry all day.
11836580	11837940	I'm actually hungry right now.
11837940	11838660	All right.
11838660	11840100	Get some Pinkberry girl.
11840100	11840420	All right.
11841380	11842420	That's it you guys.
11842420	11847460	Thank you very much for listening to Orange Lounge Radio and supporting independent podcasting.
11848660	11852340	It's much more than just some silly little radio show with a bunch of dick and fart jokes.

11854180	11856420	Have a wonderful night and we'll see you next time.
