13888	26437	Tonight, June 30, 2013, Microsoft reportedly drops Xbox Live patching fees, the Dave & Buster's chain is searching for the next big game, and Nintendo fans start a petition to end region locking on the Wii U.
32799	37621	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37701	43524	It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 510, June the 30th of 2013.
45264	57049	My name is Rob Roberts and I am here to talk with you guys about video games and gaming culture and gaming roles and gaming WTFs with my co-host, joining me as she has faithfully for the past 11 years,
58510	60231	Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
60551	60911	Bleh.
61812	62112	How are you?
62132	63673	Are you still sick 11 years later?
64033	64393	Hey.
65394	65914	You know what?
65994	66534	It's funny.
66795	70036	My voice is getting a little bit better, but I still have the cough, so.
70336	70497	Aw.
71017	71937	Ricola.
72598	74819	I'm living on a steady diet of Ricola, but you know what?
75699	76720	I've gone down a size.
77778	79960	Thanks to my diet of Ricola
97333	98194	I'm doing alright.
98354	101196	So, for those that... Loki has a bubonic plague.
101456	108021	Yeah, it's a good thing it's not a video show because if you guys could see Loki, he's got like chicken pox on his hands or something.
108441	109682	Yeah, it's not really chicken pox.
109742	117327	I mean, I don't know what chicken pox look like because I've never had it, but it's an extreme... Well, it's not extremely rare, but it's rare.
118328	119789	It's hand, foot, and mouth disease.
120049	124272	Usually something that, you know... Is that where you keep putting your foot in your mouth?
124292	125593	Because you do that a lot on this show.
126053	127493	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
148678	149560	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
161004	161644	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
180771	183855	The listeners do not want to catch foot and mouth disease or whatever it is you have.
183915	185177	No, it's only contagious.
185397	190044	It's mainly if you're dealing with your children or something like that.
190544	193829	You can catch it from changing their diapers or something like that.
193909	195071	You can catch it from...
196152	198093	She had baby butt disease
213598	215919	I wouldn't expect you to do anything different any other day.
216439	217980	We could set up a quarantine.
218000	220100	I think we've got some canvas somewhere.
220120	222741	Should we drape a plastic sheet over Loki?
223021	225522	You'll be the Loki in the plastic bubble.
226122	235125	But other than that, I've been just staying at home, just doing a lot of watching of instructional videos for Unity stuff.
235185	236546	Your programming stuff is...
237026	240407	Yeah, I finished, well, I don't know if you'd call it finished.
240827	248590	I finished slash quit my C++ thing because I was just like, listen, I don't really care about all this stuff that they're talking about.
248630	252891	And really, it doesn't, when you work with Unity and stuff, it doesn't really apply.
253431	270420	Like, you know, some of the very low-level things they're teaching you in C++, and sure, I'll go back to it someday, but for right now, I just wanted a basic understanding of, like, programming languages, and that's what I got, and that, you know, now when they're showing Unity stuff, I can understand what they're doing, and I'm not like, what?
270880	271801	What's he mean by that?
273682	277466	Well, I look forward to seeing whatever project, especially the one you were telling me about before the show.
277606	278447	Sounds very ambitious.
279288	281029	It's like an OLR dream game in the future.
281750	284212	It's Peter Molyneux crap.
284533	287496	Can you imagine if Peter Molyneux had Loki's ideas?
287796	289518	Because this is where we're headed now.
289838	291059	Loki's learning programming.
291480	292821	Loki's going to come up with these games.
292881	293642	It's going to be crazy.
294282	297624	So a couple quick things and then we'll get to our guests because we have a guest here in the studio.
298605	307850	First off, I know much of the country is under a heat wave right now, but it is hotter than Satan's taint here in Sacramento right now and just as sweaty.
307970	313633	Like it's humid and we bitch here in Sacramento about the humidity when it's like above zero.
313953	314313	No, I know.
314393	315434	It's not East Coast humid.
315454	318015	I know that, but it's bad for West Coast.
318056	318476	It's bad.
320417	321377	That was one thing I was going to say.
321397	326078	And then I think I was going to say something gaming related, but I forgot because I was thinking about how fucking hot it was.
326579	331740	So I guess with that, speaking of Satan's taint, let's go introduce our guest.
331780	332300	No, I'm kidding.
332981	333941	Say hello, everybody.
334061	337542	Joining us live in studio tonight, a good friend of mine.
337582	341644	We go way back years and years, and he hosts another show that you all should be listening to.
342044	345505	It's First Mate Slidekick from the GameBooey.org podcast.
345825	346325	Ahoi!
346565	347226	How you doing?
348006	350887	Pretty well, aside from the roasting like a chicken part.
350907	353068	More like a pig at a luau.
353328	355689	Yeah, it's pretty bad here in Sacramento, right?
355789	359671	You're visiting us for the weekend from, where do you live usually?
359731	360371	The Bay Area.
360591	360871	Yeah.
362592	364833	The big nebula of the Bay.
365453	365834	Awesome.
365854	366534	Well, welcome.
367474	373157	So Spike, your co-host at Gamebuoy.org was here about, I think it was about, actually it was about two months ago at this point.
373257	373577	Yeah.
373697	378259	So assuming we've picked up any new listeners between now and then, tell us a little bit about Gamebuoy.org.
378279	379339	What's your show all about?
379599	384001	Well, we're your port of call for gaming news and views that maybe aren't on your radar, but definitely should be.
384701	388003	What we kind of focus on are left of center news and...
388883	389484	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
406879	419072	Not really, but we think it's important for people who are interested in this type of content and these sorts of games to have a place to go to hear the news.
419973	428282	We find all this stuff on all the big news sites, but with all the big news that happens, it sometimes gets lost, so we try to...
428502	451629	Yeah, sure, like, all this fuckery about the Xbox One, I mean, that whole talk dominated E3, and I'm sure there's lots of great, and I use my quotey fingers, Kensha Hall games, in memory of the hall that used to be there, that kind of fall off the radar, because, you know, everybody's too preoccupied with all this crap about Xbox versus Sony and Nintendo out of left field and all that.
452210	464342	Right, yeah, and I mean, we talk about Xbox One and some of the bigger stuff, too, but, you know, we just try to keep our fingers on the pulse of the stuff that you might not hear a lot about, so hopefully we succeed with that.
464742	466364	And where can folks hear your show?
466624	475953	We're over at GameBooey.org, and you can get all of our episodes there, and also links to all our social networks, so...
477034	480696	Hopefully some of you, all our peeps, will come and listen to us and say hi.
480716	484738	So it's like Game Boy, but you have a U before the O, like a buoy.
484878	485899	Yeah, like a boat buoy.
485939	489261	Hence why you're pirates and first mates and all that.
489301	493183	Sorry, the listeners are complaining that you're too quiet, so I'm trying to turn you in.
493223	494023	Wow, that's a first.
495084	495324	I know.
495344	500247	Well, especially since back when we were raiding, I'd have to turn you way down.
500287	500847	That's true.
501247	503829	And then I'd have to turn Rob even further down, because...
504389	508871	Rob would be like, okay, everybody on the main... Tank, move!
509331	510092	Tank, move!
510772	512693	I like to yell at people when I play WoW.
512773	515034	I can't help it.
515214	516215	It's just the way I am.
517075	527280	So, you got some fans in the chatty room over at live.vognetwork.com because this show, you know, the one that does all the mainstream stuff here where every gamer has a voice.
527800	546964	uh we uh read along with you guys in the chat room you guys can participate live.vognetwork.com Sunday nights at six o'clock pacific nine o'clock eastern right after the Bobby Blackwolf show although sadly he was not live tonight due to a last minute technical glitch those things happen and but poor Bobby's had a string of bad luck lately with the lightning and everything else so uh
547424	572701	our thoughts go out to him for like a good week somebody needs to take Bobby Blackwolf on a cruise y'all somebody needs to put him on a cruise you know he likes cruises he's a cruiser guy he needs to that's not good luck at all come on oh yeah with everything that happened with the carnival and everything just stay away from cruises he'll end up on the poop cruise we don't want that somebody needs to get him on a good cruise no we just need to like win the lottery go to Georgia and give him a big hug
573055	573916	All right.
574036	574456	Let's see.
575617	580722	Going into our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, Osfer says, I've been recently listening to Game Buoy.
580822	581303	Happy face.
581323	582023	Aw, thanks, Osfer.
582344	585807	And ClericalError404 says, Game Buoy is great.
586458	587479	Aw, lots of love.
587539	588019	Thank you.
588260	594224	He has to say that, though, because we're doing the stuff with Koopa Club and Game Bar and Gamer X. No, I'm kidding.
594684	595184	I'm kidding.
595545	598507	What a great bunch of guys all around the internet doing those podcasts.
598767	599327	Good stuff.
600508	603270	ClericalEra404 also suggests a cruise to Alaska.
603410	604291	Hi!
604591	606893	And Codeman says, I love Bobby.
607513	609174	We all love Bobby here at the Voice Geeks Network.
609194	611676	That's why we get pissed when all this bad shit keeps happening to him.
612597	612677	Um...
613557	615099	How about an open letter to bad shit?
615760	616421	Knock it off.
616722	617302	Stop it.
617683	618704	Not love, OLR.
618844	620907	Yeah.
621107	627375	I thought of the other announcement I wanted to make real quick, and then I'll get back to John, or excuse me, First Mate Slidekick.
627435	628337	Ooh, I just said your real name.
628557	628857	Ooh.
629118	631421	And then we'll move on with the show.
631761	634182	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
654970	656611	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
678078	678559	and DarkSakura.
693539	697822	Anyhow, back to First Mate Slidekick since I'm supposed to be talking to you.
698743	701405	What are some of the topics you've talked about on Game Buoy lately?
701966	710312	One thing I kind of like about your show is that since you do a central topic, you pick a lot of stuff that's not necessarily tied into the news.
712073	714135	Your April Fool's show was all about Tingle, right?
714155	715756	Yes, it was our Tingle cast.
716276	722462	and what you did another show about I know you did an LGBT show you did what was your most recent one?
723163	740900	The most recent one we did was like the recent full episode was our E3 blowout which is a yearly thing now second year actually a new thing that we've done on the site is introduce Game Buoy Micro which are little tiny podcasts and by tiny I mean like a half hour because our podcast is
741340	742200	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
767972	774775	Since you did, I know one of the micros you did, because I actually listened to it, you guys went and saw the Best Buy Nintendo E3.
774795	776816	Yeah, we actually took some YouTube video as well.
777225	777645	How was that?
777685	780066	Not to steal the thunder of your show, but give us the Cliff Notes version.
780086	780446	How was it?
780746	782907	You know, it was kind of cool.
782927	793090	I feel like any time you go to a Nintendo event, whether it's just camping out for a Wii or going to something like this, Nintendo crowds are usually pretty cool.
793890	799012	It was a really long wait, but to Nintendo's credit, they didn't cut it off right at 6 or whatever.
799172	800212	How long was long?
801072	803534	We were in line for about five and a half hours.
804134	804995	We got to play one game.
805675	806796	Just like the real E3.
807537	808497	Yeah, pretty much.
808557	809558	Authentic experience.
809958	811219	That's what they were actually saying.
811499	815942	The Nintendo representatives there were saying it's an authentic E3 experience.
816543	817483	They give us pizza.
818544	824148	P-I-Z-Z-A Did they give you whipped cream pouring like waterfalls?
824188	824948	No, they didn't.
824968	826509	Cheap bastards.
828837	835363	But yeah, I thought it was really cool that they put it on and that they were so cooperative in that.
835403	837945	Best Buy, to their credit, was really cooperative too.
838426	839787	They could have just been like, nope, it's five.
840187	842249	Everyone who hasn't played yet doesn't get to play.
842289	851397	But they tried to get everyone to play what they wanted and they had little Mario Kart 8 flags to give you just for waiting in line.
851417	852218	So I mean, it was really cool.
852318	857303	I still think the best way, you know, approach to E3 was like Xbox.
857823	858824	I only got Xbox.
859205	868153	Yeah, 2005 or 2006 when they did that, we're bringing E3 home and they had like demos for games, like same demos that were out there.
868193	869694	I'm like, why don't they do that?
869715	872077	I don't understand why they can't do that now.
872117	875360	I mean, I know a lot of that doesn't run on like final hardware and stuff, but...
875740	884107	I think the reason why they don't is there's too many people that make their final judgment of the game based off the E3 demo, and it's too risky in that regard.
884968	887590	I honestly think that's a big part of it.
887931	895037	E3 builds are usually really early on in the development, and there's too many people that make their decision like, oh, this game sucks, based off the demo.
895097	896218	Demos carry a lot of weight.
896678	902320	Yeah, but these people, though, are the same dumb people that will buy a game based off of a review score from one outlet.
902420	907222	So, I mean, they're very fickle anyways, so I don't know why we should punish them.
907262	911624	Considering that, you know, it's going to get a good review and they're like, well, I guess I'll buy it.
911984	912504	Oh, okay.
912645	915046	You know, because, you know, iGen liked it or something.
917386	919047	Quickly, also about the Nintendo experience.
919067	919767	What did you play?
919807	922687	You got your hands on with... Spike did Mario Kart 8.
922747	925268	You did the Mario... I did Mario 3D World, yeah.
926168	928689	The Mario 3D fused with Super Mario 2 game.
929129	929409	Yeah.
929609	929969	Cats.
930789	931689	Super Mario Cats.
931709	932310	That's why you need to know.
932330	933830	Super Mario Cats, yeah.
934630	935470	It was cool.
935570	942612	I mean, it was kind of chaotic, and I've actually... I think it was over on US Gamer, which is Jeremy Parrish's new...
943152	943472	Outlet.
945194	948256	They were describing it as chaotic too, but I mean like in a good way.
948316	950078	So it was fun, you know.
950578	952580	Mario Party's chaotic if you play with me.
953221	954522	Mario Party's always chaotic.
954622	956443	Everything is chaotic if they play with you, Rob.
956463	956944	Shut up!
957164	957424	Hey.
958985	959866	I've been here 11 years.
959886	961127	I have the right to say whatever I want to.
963618	964278	But did you have fun?
964638	965339	I did, I did.
966659	969841	Did you make your judgment on the entire game based off that demo?
970901	980265	You know, I mean, I kind of made my judgment on that game based on the Nintendo Direct, honestly, so... You're like, it's Mario and Princess Floats, I'm in.
980765	989429	Pretty much, you know, I'm a shameless Nintendo fanboy, but, you know, it was good to get a chance to play it and to be able to, like, speak to that, and...
990109	997615	And just being able to see the games that I didn't play, like watching Captain Spike play Mario Kart 8 and Wind Waker HD.
998135	1007182	Towards the end, people were starting to just get really annoyed when people were like, oh, I want to play Wind Waker HD because it's actually what they did is they redid the...
1008163	1016290	Original GameCube demo, so you could either do the bird battle, boss battle, or run around Windfall Village.
1016310	1026037	Which is cool, but compared to doing two races on Mario Kart or two levels in 3D World, it was just a little too long.
1026998	1027799	It looked gorgeous, though.
1028339	1032282	Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze looked good.
1032443	1037046	It was cool to actually get a chance to see it, not just based on E3 videos, though.
1038027	1038267	Okay.
1039448	1040209	It was worth it.
1040909	1047174	Going to the chat room for some comments at live.vognetwork.com ShadowNextGen says, Gamers rush to decisions.
1047554	1051618	A lot of them don't understand the concept of an alpha or beta build that will be buggy.
1051978	1058983	Yeah, there's a lot of people playing the Final Fantasy XIV online beta right now that are basically like, oh, this is just a game trial, right?
1059824	1060845	And not really.
1060905	1061786	There's a lot still missing.
1061866	1065208	We've already seen big changes from the last build to this one.
1065268	1065869	Oh, God, yes.
1066769	1070733	Oscar says, I also did Mario 3D World at the Nintendo E3 experience.
1071033	1072834	It was pretty fun playing the cat form.
1072874	1076237	The dive mechanic is really awesomely integrated in some of the levels.
1076337	1076998	Yeah, I agree.
1078239	1078639	Very cool.
1079440	1084624	Okay, we'll take it a step back and just kind of getting to know you as a gamer a little bit before we get into tonight's news.
1085465	1086525	I always ask the guests this.
1086806	1088387	What's your favorite video game of all time?
1088587	1090488	That's always a really tough question to answer.
1090508	1091629	You can name a couple if you have to.
1092069	1094490	One of your favorite video games.
1094510	1100394	I have to say, if I'm going to just pick one favorite, it would probably be Original Legend of Zelda for NES.
1100434	1111040	Just because I grew up with that game, I know it inside and out, and that's the game that I can just put on a virtual console or whatever and play through in a weekend, and I just know where everything is.
1112100	1118104	Not that over-familiarity is always good, but it always feels like going home again.
1119554	1120735	What do you love about video games?
1120755	1123257	What possessed you to want to do a podcast?
1140971	1147415	You know, I've known Captain Spike for actually longer than I've known you, so... Yes, you have.
1148035	1149556	You guys have been besties for a long time.
1149576	1155159	Yeah, we were just always talking about games, and we just thought, you know, why not give it a try?
1155179	1163003	We were inspired by y'all here at OLR, so we just thought we'd give it a go, and we've been going for over a year at this point, so...
1163527	1165269	That's a great compliment, though, so thank you.
1165389	1170335	Like, anytime anybody says, like, oh, I mean, you guys did it, so that helped me learn that, like, I could do it, too.
1170395	1172717	I'm always like, that's, like, actually, like, a great compliment.
1173178	1173938	So, thank you.
1174179	1174599	Of course.
1175100	1175720	You guys rock.
1176361	1177362	Aw, you guys rock.
1177502	1178043	No, you.
1178423	1178964	No, you.
1179004	1179485	No, you.
1179905	1181607	All right, love fest here at OLR.
1181687	1181927	All right.
1182908	1183549	Not in this heat.
1184149	1185250	Anything else you want to plug?
1185530	1186571	Ew, sticky.
1186791	1190274	Any other shows, Twitter, things like that you want to plug?
1190294	1195258	You know, they can find all of our social links on our website, GameBooey.org.
1195578	1200942	I guess I just would like to shout out to Gamer X Convention in San Francisco.
1202063	1208108	You know, it's for gamers of all genders and that sort of thing.
1208148	1209989	You don't have to be gay to enjoy Gamer X.
1210069	1210529	That's true.
1210609	1218832	And Rob and I and Captain Spike and our friends from Game Bar and Koopa Club are going to be doing a podcasting panel there.
1218872	1228275	So if you happen to be heading out there or you didn't really know about it and you think that sounds like a cool thing, you should go over to gamerconnect.com.
1229415	1230256	DarkSakura.org.com
1251613	1252614	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1277471	1281492	Okay, well thank you and of course, please continue commenting on tonight's news slide kick.
1281512	1282372	That's why we're here.
1282612	1285472	For the record, it's 68 degrees in San Francisco right now.
1286073	1286473	Wow.
1286733	1287713	For all you in San Francisco.
1287753	1288613	Oh, but tomorrow it'll be 80.
1289893	1291474	For all of you in San Francisco.
1291614	1293534	Grandpa, if you're listening, kiss my butt.
1294014	1294334	All right.
1295414	1299615	Anyhow, let's move on into how was your gaming week?
1299655	1304336	We always like to start off the show with a little bit of what types of video games have you been playing this week in Dark Sakura?
1304356	1305536	I know you've had a big week in gaming.
1306356	1307237	I played old stuff.
1308918	1314142	We hooked up the Super Nintendo last night for my friend Amanda's 30th birthday.
1314483	1315383	Happy birthday, Amanda.
1316444	1320888	And we played Turtles in Time.
1321468	1322489	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1350848	1354831	And if you are whored, though, you can kill them, which is pretty fun.
1356312	1358393	I always liked doing that when I was way past level.
1359354	1370861	So I played a little bit of Final Fantasy XIV just because I only played a little because of all the stuff going on, especially with being sick and having to clean house and having a party.
1371782	1373283	I finally got to play Cards Against Humanity.
1373383	1375744	It's not a video game, I know, but it's totally wrong.
1376064	1376905	All the nerds are playing it.
1377125	1379606	And I got the best win ever.
1381507	1383908	I might say it on air, but it's really horrible.
1385088	1389810	But I did say that it's like an M. Night, whatever his name is.
1390330	1396213	The plot twist was that Nickelback was really the perpetually handicapped.
1397532	1398333	and Night Shyamalan.
1398493	1398954	Yeah, whatever.
1398994	1399895	Shyamalan Dean Dong.
1400356	1401197	That's what Dan calls him.
1401938	1409429	So we had the old school SNES stuff last night and I have played some...
1412234	1412634	Mass Effect 3 3DS
1430341	1435148	Thanks to my husband not wanting me to make puppy eyes and whine at him, I have Animal Crossing.
1436049	1440015	He also got himself the last Fire Emblem game for the DS.
1440235	1441838	So there's a little something in it for you both.
1442238	1443781	That's good, though.
1443801	1445724	We're probably going to sell my old DSi.
1447725	1449486	We only need to have one of each system.
1450246	1453328	We have my pink GBA.
1454308	1455569	I have the clear pink one.
1455609	1461732	We have the Nintendo SP, whatever they were called, the one that was done up by the NES.
1463013	1467895	Usually it's like when the new stuff comes out, we'll have one each of us and then sell off one of the old ones.
1469776	1470517	Right now we're poor.
1471864	1477228	Um, so, uh, I've been playing, what, six hours of Animal Crossing today.
1477869	1481391	And I've already, uh, made the down payment on my house and bought a phone booth.
1482532	1487796	And then, uh, one of my friends on Tumblr, who, uh, I have to say thank you to my name twin if she's listening.
1487816	1493560	Um, we, uh, I got a Dave Strider shirt for anyone who's into Homestuck.
1493600	1494160	It was really cool.
1494601	1498383	So my character's running around in it wearing pink glasses because, ew, pink, but glasses.
1499324	1500585	She looks kind of weird hipster.
1501291	1502291	That's a lot for just one day.
1502311	1504932	You've probably done more in a day than I've done in the three weeks I've owned this.
1504952	1505933	I have all the fruit now.
1506613	1511135	I do not have a watering can and I do not have a slingshot yet.
1511235	1511655	You'll get it.
1512235	1513356	It better be tomorrow.
1515416	1516857	Don't forget to buy the fortune cookie every day.
1518097	1518678	Oh, shoot.
1519118	1520638	Well, don't you have to have coins or something?
1520878	1522499	Yeah, you get those from walking around.
1522839	1524940	So if you've been walking around with your 3DS day, you have coins.
1525612	1529916	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1549372	1552015	Up to, I think, seven times, I think is where it maxes out.
1552095	1555319	I thought you guys would just run amok through my game.
1555399	1557382	No, I'm just like, look at my pretty penguin hat.
1557502	1558042	Isn't it awesome?
1558062	1558683	I love your penguin hat.
1558703	1561166	This is why I stopped playing Find Me, because I don't need a better hat.
1561466	1564330	Rob, I honestly like Slakic's hat better.
1564430	1564670	Whatever.
1564690	1565291	The Mario hat.
1565311	1565691	Whatever.
1566172	1568555	I want to have a propeller hat, because that would be awesome.
1570023	1572744	So yeah, Animal Crossing, that's going to be my life from here on out.
1573264	1575105	I did name my town Normandy, like I said I would.
1575125	1576125	Congrats.
1576165	1584408	So either that, so either all of my townsfolk are going to call me Commander, I mean my character Sakura, because every Animal Crossing character I've ever had is Sakura.
1584928	1590110	Either that, or they're all going to have like French words, they'll be like Merred or Ulala or...
1591230	1618964	or Zoot today I made my crappy recreation of the VOG logo in my Animal Crossing town because we finished the custom signboard so right when you enter the town you see now a big little VOG logo my ghetto logo I have a goal for this game though to find Dina you want to be reunited I want my lesbian back ours is a love long denied Dina was an aardvark I don't think she was an aardvark I thought she was a duck whatever no Mallory was a duck
1619355	1627548	There were several ducks, Rob I don't give a duck We have diversity You and your only aardvarks can be lesbians
1629972	1631373	Alright, moving on.
1631473	1633355	Loki, I know you haven't been playing Animal Crossing.
1633375	1634076	What have you been playing?
1634416	1636518	I haven't been playing very much at all, actually, this week.
1636538	1638579	Let's see.
1638779	1645005	The two things I did play this week, one being Final Fantasy XIV, the beta.
1645025	1647166	I played about an hour of that.
1647327	1649528	I was actually going to play more, but then I just kept getting distracted.
1650149	1654392	I was supposed to play LittleBigPlanet Karting, but I forgot.
1655413	1657155	Hands are too much anyways to play anything, so...
1659097	1659917	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1679376	1681658	I'm like, okay, I guess I will.
1682519	1687885	And then I get killed because I don't notice that my health is going down because it's too much on the screen.
1688405	1692570	There's a tip I have for fates if you happen to find yourself overwhelmed.
1693090	1694331	Run through a big crowd of people.
1694752	1695773	The thing will not follow you.
1696673	1697774	Well, it wasn't that at all.
1697814	1700136	I didn't even notice it was doing a lot of damage to me.
1700156	1705020	It's because I'd get done with one and immediately target the next thing and immediately go.
1705540	1709904	Also, many people don't realize the UI is completely customizable, even on PS3.
1710164	1713047	So if the health bars are not in a unique place for you, try to move them.
1713807	1714067	I should.
1715588	1723770	And then the other thing I played was a little bit of Excite Truck this morning because we wanted to entertain Josh.
1723870	1731052	And I was trying to get Mario Kart to work, but my disc wouldn't read in my Wii U, which is weird because it did before and now it's not.
1737074	1763270	and then so it's just like okay well I guess we'll do you know we play and then he couldn't understand we play so we did excite truck and he just kind of let it sit there and just coast in a circle so that was kind of fun but I actually did get to play a couple races and stuff and man that game looks really basic now that actually like you know now that you're not zooming through the landscape you know at a high rate of speed it's just very basic looking I'm like wow
1764758	1765119	S, Actdeft, Drew,
1780018	1792406	Thanks to one of our old listeners of the show and also one of the old players that used to play on the Minecraft server that we had, Lord Gally.
1793067	1797930	He has actually provided or said, hey, you know what, I have a server that not a lot of people play on.
1798590	1800571	You guys want to come play on our server?
1800631	1806333	So he gave me full access to the admin stuff for it, so we'll be able to set it up.
1806373	1811274	And it's actually a lot more flexible than the old one, so I can actually do all the kind of mods I want to do.
1811334	1815876	Well, somebody needs to build a shrine to Lord Gally first thing for that, because that's an awesome gesture.
1815916	1816636	Thank you, Lord Gally.
1816676	1824979	I have to check with him, because right now it's set to survival and stuff, so I have to see if he wants to switch it off of that and put it on bucket and everything, so...
1825619	1853546	but now that I have all the tools to do that I just got to sit down and actually research what I want to do I wanted to put a spout craft server on there because spouts pretty awesome because you can create all the custom shapes and stuff like other materials that are unique to the game so you can have new enemies you could have planes cars guns you know all sorts of crazy stuff so I'll see how hard that is and may do that but it looks like it'll be a lot of fun and hopefully we'll get to play it again
1853686	1855427	Codeman is bouncing off the walls in chat.
1855447	1856928	He's very excited to hear that it's back.
1857128	1862930	So soon, I'll have the details in the VOG Minecraft forum.
1863151	1865132	Slidekick, are you a Minecraft player?
1865172	1865892	You ever tried that out?
1866357	1869439	I've actually never played Minecraft before, so I probably should.
1870480	1872061	It's different.
1872281	1876444	It's a game, but it's more like Legos on the computer.
1877405	1878106	It's hard to explain.
1878446	1879326	I've watched people play it.
1879907	1880327	It's clever.
1880367	1883970	It's just never really been a high priority for me, but I should check it out.
1884970	1885411	Give it a chance.
1885751	1886071	Good times.
1886812	1890314	Okay, if that's it for Loki's Gaming Week, then I will move into my Gaming Week real quick.
1890394	1891395	I didn't have a lot to play.
1891515	1895017	Honestly, I OD'd on Final Fantasy XIV this weekend during the beta.
1895157	1897359	I played damn near nonstop.
1897819	1905584	I mean, I had a couple other things to do here locally, but when I wasn't out and about, I was trying to stay out of the heat and I was playing the crap out of Final Fantasy XIV beta.
1905624	1914951	For those that would understand that they've been playing the beta too, my Thaumaturge is level 16 and then my main... I started with Thaumaturge and I switched to Conjure.
1915831	1916811	And my Conjurer is now 17.
1917872	1919493	So I've got both those jobs going.
1919553	1923434	So is Conjurer like the 14 version of a Summoner now?
1923794	1926095	No, that's going to be Arcanist, which isn't in the beta yet.
1926195	1927596	So there's still stuff to add.
1927636	1932818	Arcanist will lead to Summoner and Scholar eventually.
1933238	1935559	And then Conjurer leads to Black Mage.
1935860	1936420	Or no, excuse me.
1936620	1936780	Whoop!
1937020	1966100	Thaumaturge leads to Black Mage Conjurer leads to White Mage but like you don't ever get stuck with just one job it's kind of more the final it's not like 11 system of sub jobs it's Final Fantasy 5 more system where you choose traits like because my Thaumaturge is level 16 when I play a Conjurer I can have Thunder and Surecast from my Thaumaturge in my bar so that's kind of like and like if I were to play a Gladiator or something I could actually get like maybe weapon skills if they're usable if they're compatible with my class but
1966340	1967300	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1990509	1999076	In many ways, some of the combat I realized when I was healing a dungeon the other night, I'm like, you know, this game doesn't really have the complexity of World of Warcraft.
1999316	2003379	All I'm doing is Cure, Cure, Cure, and occasionally I'm doing Medica, which is the group Cure.
2003840	2009064	And sometimes I'll get to nuke the mob, but I don't have the diversity that I have in World of Warcraft spells.
2009504	2011485	Now granted, World of Warcraft wasn't always like that.
2011525	2013307	World of Warcraft's five expansions in right now.
2013647	2022551	So it's going to take time for Final Fantasy XIV to build up to that, and I see the potential there, but I love that the combat is so fast-paced, but it's Final Fantasy.
2022631	2034137	I also like how the combat, well, you can kind of utilize your terrain as well, because now that you can jump and stuff, you can actually, you know, okay, I'm going to...
2034617	2042221	Hop up on here and, you know, shoot stuff from, you know, cast spells from up on top of here and the monster can't really get around to me.
2042301	2052826	Or, like, I found with, like, it doesn't work all the time with goblins and stuff, but when they do the bomb toss or whatever, it'll show where the bomb's going to be and you can run around behind them and you don't take any damage, which is pretty sweet.
2053467	2054447	I actually liked that, too.
2054507	2061791	Like, that one duty I was having a problem with, I ended up just sprinting and kiting him the whole time, but it was really neat.
2061811	2063392	It actually worked a lot better than it did in WoW.
2064366	2065807	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2094964	2096625	It's just... Everything is there.
2096745	2102687	I thought I was going to have to get a new system, but there has been such a jump in performance from the last beta to this beta.
2102747	2103468	I'm like, oh my god.
2103828	2106329	Like, this game looks great on my not-so-great computer.
2106449	2107289	I'm so thrilled.
2107349	2109330	It really sets it to optimize to what you have.
2109610	2110310	So, yeah.
2110710	2113251	Been loving Final Fantasy XIV.
2113552	2115552	Oh, one of the other fanservice-y things I have to talk about.
2115692	2118994	The last boss in Tamtara Deepcroft, which is one of the instances...
2119674	2137639	it's a it's a mage with a tentacle face and I didn't catch it at first but Alan looks over and goes dude that's one of the mage mobs from Final Fantasy 1 and I'm like oh my god it is like there's just all these little like subtle fan service things they change something by the way um when you start off in Gridania did you remake a character there
2139550	2140231	No, I don't think so.
2140331	2142935	Your intro is different now from how it was in the last one.
2142955	2143736	You have moogles.
2144336	2146239	No, I started an olda this time.
2146840	2149944	Well, I went ahead and made another conjurer because I wanted to see if they had a new quest.
2150845	2153609	And there's moogles.
2154129	2154930	And it's really funny.
2155251	2155671	That's cute.
2156832	2160834	Techness in chat says, Oh, and where's the VOG link shell for Final Fantasy 14?
2161255	2163496	I accidentally rolled on one of the JP realms.
2164156	2170099	My assumption is that Horde House being the online gaming show will kind of pick up the VOG link shell thing and create.
2170480	2174542	Right now we're on Behemoth, but that's subject to change for Beta 4.
2174782	2175622	We will let you know.
2175662	2176783	Behemoth is busier.
2176943	2177424	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2192344	2194065	If it's lower, then that's even better.
2194085	2197648	But I had the impression it was going to be the $14.95 thing.
2197848	2202511	I'm assuming somebody in chat will yell it out, or if Shane Alinko is listening, he'll join shortly and yell it.
2202571	2203772	See, the thing is, I don't know.
2203892	2208215	I hate paying for an MMO month-to-month because I want to play so much other stuff.
2208495	2212078	I feel locked into having to play that to kind of get my money's worth each month.
2212638	2233930	and that's the thing it's like that's why I quit Final Fantasy XI because I just wasn't playing it enough and I kind of afraid to get into something like that's why free to play or you buy the game and you can play whenever you know works well for me it's just I like the game I like it a lot better it seems to be a lot easier to level up and stuff than XI which is nice but
2235322	2235702	I don't know.
2236422	2237743	All right, so anyway, Final Fantasy XIV.
2237783	2244506	And then the other game I've played a lot of this week, Marvel Heroes, the free-to-play MMO, although it's a little more like Diablo.
2244746	2245386	Free my ass.
2246006	2248807	Yeah, well, it's got little transactions up the wazoo.
2248947	2250408	Little?
2250548	2252949	I started a storm, of course, because I love storm.
2253229	2259571	So I started playing a storm, and then after I beat the first boss, I got the Scarlet Witch token, so I can play a Scarlet Witch now, too.
2259591	2260112	That's kind of cool.
2260152	2260932	That's who I started with.
2261112	2264393	Yeah, so apparently all the characters will drop in the game.
2264413	2265714	It just might take forever.
2266354	2281141	But I'll give a cheap plug to this week's Horde House because we had Mihail on this week and he talked about Marvel Heroes and a lot of League of Legends, which I patched this week so I could play with Mihail later this week when Final Fantasy XIV is not running.
2282181	2282621	HordeHouse.com.
2282701	2283602	It's not running this week?
2284909	2285710	Only on the weekends, right?
2285730	2290679	Yeah, Final Fantasy XIV is only running on the weekends, but the rumor is there's going to be a longer stress test before Beta 4.
2291100	2291481	So we'll see.
2292495	2317670	anyhow uh slide kick first mate slide kick what have you been playing this week what's a week of gaming look like to you it's pretty much been all animal crossing uh you know it's funny because i picked it up actually at the nintendo experience because you know they had a display sitting out so i was like oh i probably should get it and for the first couple of days i only played a little bit but lately i've just been playing for like hours at a time and i'm like oh i've got to sleep now
2317970	2319511	I also played the shit out of Animal Crossing.
2319551	2322132	That one night we were doing the Google Hangout with everybody.
2322392	2322772	Good times.
2323012	2323412	Yeah.
2323912	2327654	So I just built the upstairs to my house.
2328074	2330615	I've been going to the island a lot, catching bugs.
2331755	2340378	Oh, I got Reggie's house in my spot pass in the Happy Home model homes gallery.
2340458	2342679	So I've been buying a lot of stuff out of Reggie's house.
2343400	2346181	And when you look in his little profile card, it says my body is ready.
2346261	2346441	So...
2347541	2350102	Yeah, you know it was an intern that did it, people.
2350242	2351842	It's not Reggie's actual house.
2351862	2352962	An intern did it for him.
2353582	2362644	I did notice in some of the screenshots or whatever they were showing of the game that they have a lot of cool niche Japanese arcade stuff you can get.
2362684	2372867	I don't know if they have a Japanese arcade set, but they have a candy cab, a claw machine, some actual table cabinets and stuff like that.
2373047	2373847	They look pretty sweet.
2374427	2377468	Not sweet enough for me to buy a 3DS for the game, but sweet enough.
2377548	2379228	I have a claw machine in my Animal Crossing house.
2379248	2379689	It's awesome.
2379929	2384130	Do you know what I loved in your town was the animal that had the chocolate fondue fountain.
2384330	2384970	That's what I want.
2388331	2389991	Who doesn't want a chocolate fondue fountain?
2390031	2390552	Let's be real.
2390712	2390892	Yeah.
2390952	2391612	And some McCroons.
2391812	2392072	Come on.
2392252	2392672	You know what?
2393072	2393612	Huh?
2393632	2396433	First thing that I bought wasn't making a down payment on my house.
2396573	2397193	I bought a phone booth.
2397814	2399314	Is that the thing that looks like a TARDIS but red?
2399716	2401737	It's the current British style phone booth.
2401797	2402057	Okay.
2402358	2402638	Yeah.
2402718	2405720	Like one of those was for sale in my town the night of the Google Hangout.
2406220	2408501	And Spike was like, open your gates right now.
2408521	2409081	I'm coming to town.
2409362	2413384	And that just started this whole like wave of Animal Crossing fuckery.
2413564	2414024	Yeah.
2414425	2417106	Except then he didn't take my virtual boy that I was saving for him.
2417246	2418807	He's a virtual boy fanatic.
2419868	2421389	So I'll have to get it to him.
2421429	2422709	Now you're no longer friends.
2423490	2427372	If they put in like virtual boy games, it would totally work with the lenticular game.
2428573	2430794	Oh, as like a 3DS Virtual Console thing?
2430814	2431035	Yeah.
2431475	2436098	Yeah, I don't even know about like Virtual Boy emulation, if that's actually a thing.
2436538	2438579	I thought there were early rumors it was going to happen.
2439119	2444663	They just need to make Animal Crossing like the Nintendo version of PlayStation Home.
2445864	2446184	Done.
2446344	2448645	Well, rumors are it's going to go free to play at some point.
2448665	2449666	System seller right there.
2449806	2450286	Makes sense.
2451027	2451367	All right.
2451947	2452388	Anything else?
2452588	2452948	Slide kick.
2453308	2455871	No, actually just Animal Crossing this week.
2455891	2459594	I've been meaning to get around to some other stuff, but I'm actually in the process of moving.
2459715	2462557	So I've been kind of trying to pack up my console games.
2462617	2464359	So I'm like, oh, my 3DS is right here.
2464459	2468844	So that's why I've kind of been focusing on 3DS for the most part.
2469364	2473067	Not to give out your home address for all the stalkers, but you're moving to Daily City, right?
2473167	2475528	Yes, which is Alan's old digs, kind of.
2475648	2478870	Yeah, just Alan's old digs and just a quick part right away from the city.
2478990	2479131	Yes.
2479151	2480051	Because you're having fun.
2480511	2480872	Mm-hmm.
2481012	2481432	All right.
2482893	2485655	Good thing you missed this weekend because I hear it was crazy.
2486907	2488548	Oh, yeah, with all the festivities.
2488608	2490789	Yes, lots of extra festivities.
2491309	2493490	Lots of stuff in the news to be festive about.
2494051	2495531	But we are going to move into gaming news.
2495871	2497712	But first, I want to go over some housekeeping.
2498132	2503835	Of course, I always like to plug our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, and Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2504135	2505756	And I was going to plug this during housekeeping.
2505796	2507897	We already mentioned it at the top of the show, but I'll plug it again.
2508477	2510698	GamerX, catch me.
2510818	2513300	I'll be there live August 4th.
2514480	2516162	Thank you for watching!
2530775	2545242	You get there and you just look for Podcast Cross Zone and you're going to go to it because it has the word podcast in it and that's where you're going to see me and Slag Kick and all the kids from Koopa Club and Spike and Game Bar and it's going to be fun.
2545722	2546222	Come up and say hello.
2546242	2547163	It will be great times.
2547443	2554666	And earlier today before the show, I was talking about cosplay because I think there is a costume I can pull off that's tasteful.
2554786	2555907	You're going to pull off your costume?
2556227	2558068	No, this is tasteful, Slag Kick.
2558368	2562270	He's going to do the gladiator armor from Final Fantasy XIV.
2563451	2564411	Oh, yeah.
2564512	2566132	So I'm going to wear the, what is it?
2566152	2567173	Subligar, the panties.
2567453	2568274	The leather mantis.
2568334	2568654	No.
2568954	2570995	You'd probably be very popular if you wore that.
2571055	2571556	Yeah, right.
2571676	2572616	No, no.
2572656	2576238	They'll be like, okay, that guy does not have the body to wear something like that.
2576338	2577539	So, all right.
2578700	2580441	So I will wear something that will keep me covered.
2580481	2580941	Thank you.
2581341	2584883	I just turned 35, you know, so I don't need to be showing all my wrinkles.
2585043	2585784	Such a press.
2586024	2586224	I know.
2586824	2592352	Alright, anyhow, let's for real get into some of the gaming news this week.
2593053	2599242	This is the gaming news that may not be on your radar, or it's pinging huge on your radar, one or the other, right?
2599403	2599823	Slidekick?
2599923	2600364	Yep.
2600664	2601546	Alright, start us off, Loki.
2602307	2612038	Alright, so Index Corporation, the, I think, pretty recent parent company of Atlas, they are having some problems.
2612178	2621609	They are basically filing for civil rehabilitation and maybe selling off assets, I'm assuming.
2622330	2624312	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2643268	2652433	and they also have some other titles that they're publishing including the movie tie-in for RIPD and I guess Daylight.
2652993	2653754	Oh yeah, Daylight.
2653774	2655955	I don't even remember what Daylight is.
2655995	2658917	Daylight is the survival horror.
2658997	2667541	You're thrown in a haunted house, I think, with only a flashlight and the PlayStation Eye records your scares so that your friends can laugh at you.
2668502	2669042	That's kind of funny.
2670443	2671043	So yeah, so
2672631	2672951	I don't know.
2673051	2675454	Maybe they're not in too much trouble.
2675794	2682480	It's hard to say with Atlas because Atlas, they kind of deal with a lot of niche properties, so money seems to be very tight.
2682740	2690247	Very small production runs, very small everything, budget, so it's hard to say if
2690467	2695672	Yeah, I've seen a lot of people worried about them, but I mean, Atlus is well-loved enough that they'll find a home.
2695692	2702658	A lot of people think that Sony or Nintendo would snap them up, but I wouldn't be surprised if, like, GungHo or somebody snapped them up.
2702678	2707142	I would think, like, Marvelous... And a lot of people are afraid that EA might snap them up.
2708163	2711366	I would think it would be more like Marvelous or...
2713508	2713889	What else?
2715731	2717893	Axis, I don't think it's too big to do that.
2718053	2724501	But those are kind of the three companies that bring over localized Japanese product nowadays.
2726943	2728124	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2746476	2747677	Well, I don't think they're big enough.
2747697	2751300	I mean, XSEED's, I think, quite small compared to Atlas.
2751380	2753902	Atlas was kind of growing quite a bit.
2753922	2757885	I thought they were going to be branching out more into, like, Western development stuff as well.
2757905	2762928	Because they tried, you know, with, like, Game of Thrones and they have a few Sherlock Holmes games and stuff.
2763549	2765570	But it's just nothing's really taken off.
2766150	2767732	Which is too bad, because Game of Thrones could have been good.
2768212	2768452	Yeah.
2768592	2769613	Except it was a really bad game.
2769873	2772774	That PlayStation 3 game you're talking about, the horror game, sounds really good.
2773954	2774574	Sounds interesting.
2774894	2776174	Better than what they have.
2776794	2780315	Sony had a PlayStation Move game, although I don't know if it's Move anymore.
2781955	2782335	What was it?
2782656	2788337	That one was supposed to be a teen horror genre type game.
2788417	2789777	I don't really know how that was going to work.
2790197	2793818	I don't even remember the title of it now.
2794118	2795298	Because it was that memorable.
2795920	2800201	Shadow Next Gen in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says, what if Microsoft bought Atlas?
2800521	2803002	They would have a lot of Japanese content on their platform then.
2804962	2809344	Well, that won't do them any good since they're not putting out the Xbox One in Japan at launch.
2809784	2814025	It would be an interesting strategical move, but I think for Microsoft also a risky one.
2814525	2814965	You know what I mean?
2816434	2817295	Yeah.
2818116	2823882	I've heard a couple people say that could be a thing, but I don't think Microsoft really would do it.
2824282	2827766	I think a lot of Nintendo fanboys would just eat it up if Nintendo would do it, though.
2828286	2830308	Yeah.
2830409	2833612	That kind of only exists in fanboy imagination, I think, but you never know.
2834853	2834953	So...
2835854	2839457	Alright, well let's move on to another story, and this is about Saints Row 4.
2839737	2841178	Oh, Loki's looking forward to this one.
2841918	2845081	Well, it's a good thing Loki doesn't live in Australia, or he might be waiting a little bit longer.
2845101	2847502	Oh, please, like an Australian, stop me from getting this.
2847622	2851265	Yeah, right, and I'm sure there's a lot of people in Australia that are saying the same thing.
2851345	2861132	However, Saints Row 4 is now the first game to be refused classification in the country since Australia released their R18 plus rating at the start of the year.
2861172	2862653	Which doesn't make any sense to me.
2862893	2864694	I don't know how they're going to do that, but good luck.
2891910	2895914	There's going to be a mod immediately after it comes out that'll put it all right back.
2896895	2897716	Especially on PC.
2898276	2898537	Yeah.
2899658	2904503	How cute that Australia thinks it could regulate some of that because on the internet this stuff will just come over instantly.
2904603	2905764	I just don't understand.
2906344	2907626	Just encourages piracy too.
2908086	2913892	But did you hear the reason why it got... I didn't hear the specific reason why, no.
2913952	2914432	What was it?
2914572	2915613	They have an anal probe.
2917514	2918555	Oh, no.
2918795	2921076	See, I was wondering where they would take the dildo vat next.
2921156	2921696	No, no, no.
2921716	2924197	Yeah, they have a... Does it have a big satellite?
2924357	2932260	It basically looks like a giant dildo with a sword hilt or something on it, and you can shove it up the ass of your enemies.
2932560	2935001	I'm like, this makes me want to buy the game even more.
2935561	2936322	I can't wait.
2937302	2940864	Like, I gotta find... Yeah, you just finished talking there.
2940884	2945947	I'm gonna find the exact description was hilarious.
2948069	2950991	Didn't an episode of South Park have the anal probe, though?
2951051	2952852	I mean, wasn't that the first episode?
2952872	2953712	Cartman gets an anal probe?
2953732	2954213	I think it was.
2954473	2961017	The moment he said anal probe, like, the whole, I like to sing about the moon and the trees popped into my head in that episode.
2961536	2965859	Alright, also, I guess games are getting hit left and right in Australia now.
2966820	2971023	State of Decay is another game that's been refused classification in Australia.
2971743	2974926	This was just not even that long after word of Saints Row 4 happened.
2975926	2980590	So this was Microsoft is evaluating the options with regards to the title's classification.
2981210	2987615	The Australian classification system plays an important role in ensuring that Australians can only access age-appropriate games and content.
2988175	2990317	So that was one day after Saints Row 4.
2993007	2997470	The game includes a weapon referred to the applicant as an alien anal probe.
2997490	3000452	The applicant states that this weapon can be shoved into enemies' backsides.
3014540	3014820	Sold!
3014840	3016181	That's not a probe.
3016201	3017261	That's more like a bottle rocket.
3017281	3018102	You're such a teenager.
3018122	3019202	That's an ass-launcher.
3044013	3062747	an ass launcher ass launcher ass master apparently after the probe has been inserted into the victim's anus the area around the buttocks becomes pixelated highlighting that the aim of the weapon is to penetrate the victim's anus the weapon can be used during gameplay to enemy characters and civilians so the weapon
3063607	3086862	as long as they don't leave a blood trail that would just be wrong and also alien narcotics was the other reason why I guess smoking alien narcotics equips the players with superpowers awesome do they actually get superpowers or do they just think they have superpowers who cares alrighty then let's move on with something else I don't want to be on this planet anymore
3087626	3091889	Okay, well, a lot of people are not happy with Microsoft.
3091989	3097093	And among the people who are unhappy with Microsoft is the creator of Fez, Phil Fish.
3098354	3101036	Try saying Fez and Phil Fish together three times fast.
3101076	3102597	Fez, Phil Fish, Phil Fish, Phil Fish.
3102657	3103037	See?
3103418	3105119	You lose.
3105539	3112304	But basically he's saying that Microsoft was doing nothing to help sell his game on Xbox Live Arcade.
3113405	3114566	He complained about it on Twitter.
3114586	3118207	He said Microsoft was our publisher on the Xbox 360 and they did nothing.
3118247	3120748	No promotion, no festivals, not a single mention.
3123029	3128231	In a newsletter or conference, they put us up on their shitty dashboard and somehow fucked that up too.
3129092	3132733	They put us up on the game marketplace with no cover image.
3132773	3134254	The file was missing for a week.
3135797	3144130	So basically, he's also saying that Microsoft has stopped charging developers $10,000 for patches and updates.
3145612	3149999	And there's a lot of crap going on between...
3151915	3166376	with misinformation going from Microsoft not telling them about corruption within the file system or anything like that so basically they're like oh we don't really care indie developer we just want you to put your game up there we're not going to promote it just put it there we're not going to put any money behind you
3167206	3170448	Actdeft in chat says, Phil Fish, I hate the guy, but he's right in this one.
3172029	3179334	I mean, yeah, because Microsoft doesn't let people self-publish to the... I mean, they have XNA for self-publishing, although they're not going to be supporting that anymore.
3179934	3185998	And this is part of why people are mad, because you can publish under Microsoft, but then, you know, there's all these other complaints.
3186018	3190401	Well, yeah, and Microsoft was charging $10,000 for them to put in a fix in corrupted files.
3190501	3193523	Yeah, Fez really got screwed by all that business.
3194156	3212539	and on top of that Microsoft did confirm that they automatically charged developers for resubmissions of games was scrapped in April is what they're saying but they never told any of the developers about that they said that the new policy was retroactive but they never said anything
3213288	3214769	Well, didn't you have more information on that, Loki?
3215169	3216630	Nope, I had exactly that information.
3216710	3222074	And, of course, on top of that, you know, Phil Fish is still pissed off about the whole thing.
3222334	3229679	See, this is kind of funny, I think, because he was complaining that, oh, well, you know, I don't know if he had a patch or something.
3229799	3234522	First, he put out a patch for the game, and it fucked up the game even more than without the patch.
3235083	3239866	And so then they pulled the patch, I guess, and he couldn't resubmit the patch or something.
3240446	3243168	But now that it's free, why isn't he resubmitting the patch?
3244969	3247189	Perhaps by this point it's just done with the fuckery.
3247409	3254872	But if he had it done already, if he had that fixed patch done already, I'm assuming he still has the data, why can't he just resubmit it instead of being a complete douche?
3256252	3261114	Oh, I know, because he wants to sell Feds 2, which will be coming out to platforms other than Xbox One.
3261414	3265095	Unless it's seriously trying to distance himself from Microsoft.
3265515	3270457	Which I can see that, trying just to remove any association between your product to Microsoft...
3271129	3276819	I mean, you keep in mind the bottom line of development is money.
3278582	3283671	If he's trying to market a next game, it's a smart move to separate it from where it's already been screwed over.
3284465	3287828	Well, Shadow Next Gen in our chat says Sony was charging for updates too, I believe.
3287869	3288689	It wasn't Microsoft specific.
3288709	3290251	I don't know if they were charging that much.
3291612	3299380	I want to say I remember hearing something like that too because I remember it was a big deal when Wii U first came out is that's why indies were embracing it is because Nintendo wasn't charging.
3299881	3301463	And that was like a huge selling point.
3301763	3302684	So, yeah.
3304318	3307420	I'm pretty sure Sony has to have gotten rid of that since, though.
3307861	3314966	They might have just done it a lot quieter than Microsoft did, because look at all those indies they lured to their E3 press conference.
3317268	3323952	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, EARTH.
3325433	3331157	Alright, well speaking of Microsoft, a very interesting patent revealed out of Microsoft.
3331417	3332938	It was a patent filed back in December of 2011.
3333278	3339022	This would have been around the time Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary or the Halo remake came out.
3340503	3345666	It was a patent for a video game that would, quote, have a plurality of game engines running concurrently.
3346006	3351329	And you might remember the Halo Anniversary game lets you go between updated visuals and original Xbox...
3352350	3353031	Back and forth.
3354191	3366961	Apparently, this is what the patent was out there for, is that it was for remakes of games where you could have original graphics and, I thought this was interesting, leveraging player emotions tied to the original experience.
3367401	3373165	However, this may be lost as modern graphics may cause the gamers to lose that feeling of nostalgia.
3373625	3375707	So it was because of an emotional connection.
3376127	3378208	I guess I could see that.
3378528	3385872	There was a whole bunch of these games on Xbox Live Arcade when that first came out, like all the Konami remakes.
3386253	3387293	You could play like Gyruss.
3387313	3389554	You could play it with the original graphics or the HD graphics.
3390095	3391796	You have to play with the original graphics.
3391816	3395918	I can't play with the new graphics because they're not that good and it's hard to see the bullets.
3396198	3397199	Well, that's a different thing.
3397219	3399120	That's not that you're nostalgic for the old graphics.
3399181	3401202	It's just the new ones are really lame.
3401302	3402143	Maybe a little bit.
3402223	3403724	So, I don't know.
3404024	3408348	Sounds like you're smoking some alien narcotics here because I don't see the point.
3408528	3410810	Weren't we having that discussion, though, about voice acting today?
3411530	3412271	Oh, a little bit, yeah.
3412291	3415654	With Metal Gear, how they updated the voice acting.
3415674	3421018	I mean, it was all the same people, but they didn't put the same cheesiness into it, I guess.
3421058	3422459	I wonder if it's sort of along the same lines.
3422813	3423273	SILENT HILL 3
3439338	3441840	Slidekick, are you emotionally tied to retro games?
3442460	3448264	You know what this actually made me think of is when they put out the Star Wars DVDs that had the original video.
3448284	3453087	I think it might have been like a laser disc transfer or something because that's all they had that wasn't destroyed at that point.
3453407	3453728	Which one?
3454208	3456389	The original Star Wars trilogy.
3456429	3458931	They put out a DVD set that was like two discs.
3459611	3461172	Which I have that set.
3461413	3462093	Yeah, me too.
3462153	3464375	That were the theatrical releases.
3464835	3465055	Yes.
3465375	3467897	And those I think were redone off of film prints.
3467917	3467977	Yes.
3468687	3469367	Oh, film prints, okay.
3469387	3471608	So like hand shot first on the Laserdisc?
3473688	3475169	I have a version of it.
3475289	3479810	I have the THX remasters on Laserdisc, where yes indeedy, he shot first.
3481230	3494274	We call them the non-fucked up remasters, because they actually had the whole THX sound, they did all the cleanup, they had the extra, you know where you see the X's flying in the air, instead of X-wings flying in the air?
3494294	3497875	They had all of the corrections made, but they didn't do any of the changes.
3499873	3518486	and I got it for 11 bucks that's a good point though that people are definitely tied to that emotionally because you bring up the new Star Wars with anybody is there anybody out there anybody that prefers Lucas's changes in the original trilogy anybody people with brain damage I mean I'm sorry don't offend you know what diversity DarkSakura
3519195	3519715	You know what?
3520076	3520296	What?
3520396	3521137	It's still wrong.
3521577	3525740	I don't think people are that nostalgic for Xbox One graphics, to be honest.
3525840	3536409	I mean, and if they're redoing the game with, you know, I think it was like Halo 3 or Halo Reaches Engine, which is not bad and definitely the graphics look way better.
3536749	3542454	I don't see the point of having to tax the system that much by running two copies of the game at the same time.
3542494	3544776	I think it's a little ridiculous because you either...
3545436	3546537	sell a copy of the game.
3546737	3553963	I mean, I wonder if they have the actual data of how many people actually play that game with the new graphics versus old graphics.
3554603	3562349	And then also a subset of that, how many people play the game with the new graphics and old graphics and use the Kinect to old graphics, new graphics, old graphics, new graphics.
3562409	3564851	The same people that sit there and yell grenade to throw a grenade.
3564871	3569835	Grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade.
3570896	3574118	And you know, HD remasters seem to be pretty popular, so I mean, I don't know why.
3574218	3575659	But some of them are so good.
3575699	3579642	Like, I am so there for the Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy X. Oh, that was gorgeous.
3579822	3582204	I'm running up to the feeder bar, give me pellet, give me pellet.
3582244	3585586	Like, you know, some of that, you know, I'm a sucker for some of it.
3585686	3589369	You know who I wouldn't want to go up against, you know, using the Kinect and the Halo thing?
3589569	3594432	The guy that used to do the Micro Machines commercials because, my God, he would fucking own online.
3594472	3596814	I think he should be relieved that he's dead.
3597174	3597934	It doesn't matter.
3598875	3600176	And John Machida.
3600489	3600970	Thanks for watching!
3615050	3617612	Did any of you play Mega Man Powered Up for PSP?
3618733	3620034	It was the remake of Mega Man 1.
3620734	3621214	Yes.
3621294	3625357	It wasn't bad, but they replaced the original Mega Man 1 music.
3625377	3627178	That's awful.
3627318	3629800	One has good music, but it's not 2 or 3.
3630020	3633422	The GameCube one, too, I think of.
3634183	3635744	I don't think it had the re-dunk.
3636064	3638626	They just had this cutesy music that I was like, I don't know.
3638646	3640127	Yeah, it had the new music in it.
3640407	3641368	It was just too cutesy.
3641408	3643909	I can understand the nostalgia thing at times.
3647912	3650153	Alright, let's move on with some more news.
3650493	3652814	DarkSakura's got something for us and then we're going to get to release dates.
3652894	3655316	I was trying to find out when John Machida died.
3655616	3655836	Oh well.
3656696	3657637	It was a while ago.
3657717	3659678	I hate to say it, it was a while ago.
3659938	3663060	I think it was sometime while I was still in high school, maybe?
3663720	3664080	I don't know.
3664461	3671467	Anyway, there is some good news for people who were going to put some stock into the Xbox One.
3672208	3674810	They've actually improved the memory performance for the console.
3675851	3681116	Basically, they... Let me see if I can't find exactly the amount.
3682177	3682277	Um...
3683968	3698598	They've actually have now a 32 megabyte of embedded static RAM that's going to make up the difference in processing speed between what was previously announced for the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4.
3699659	3703422	But I don't know if it's still going to be as good.
3704963	3710807	They're saying that right now that 192 gigabytes a second is theoretically possible.
3712483	3714304	32 megabytes of RAM.
3714344	3718867	Man, that console must be worth thousands of dollars, said somebody in the 90s.
3721528	3728372	Well, they're saying it's this embedded static RAM, which I think just means it's a new chip.
3729557	3737139	It just kind of sucks because launch games always are not going to look as good as games later in the console's lifespan.
3737399	3743381	Especially now that they're like, oh, right away we're shipping with more memory.
3743441	3748463	So the games that are prepared for launch probably won't be able to take advantage of that, and that kind of sucks.
3749039	3761682	Well, they were saying right now that their original calculations, just as a base calculation, came up to 128 bytes per block multiplied by 800 megahertz.
3762842	3767624	And that now that they've been able to reasonably get in their simulations 133 gigabytes a second, so...
3769164	3774189	Alright, then I want no excuses if the Xbox One versions are inferior to the PlayStation 4 versions.
3774469	3775390	That's all I'm just saying.
3775430	3778673	Now that you're not going to get your games online, we got more speed.
3779033	3779834	Hold on a second there.
3779854	3781536	You said you added 32 megs of RAM.
3782597	3784358	This should be night and day difference, right?
3785039	3785239	On my 486.
3785499	3785680	Ah.
3787601	3788642	Womp womp.
3788662	3789143	Womp womp.
3790725	3796454	I honestly think this is a bunch of just... It's a bullet point to report on and no one knows what the hell it means.
3797696	3801802	Why, if they're just going to add this RAM, why can't the developers just go back and turn up the graphics on level 3?
3801842	3804325	Don't they just take a big dial and turn up the graphics?
3805767	3812993	What they're basically saying this means is that for some of the games that they showed at E3 that kind of stuttered along, that it should improve performance dramatically.
3813033	3815735	I mean, I'm not sure what this 32 megabyte thing is going to do.
3815755	3821059	I mean, it has to be something involved with another calculation, like maybe a buffer or something.
3821099	3823761	It's to save more pictures of you masturbating.
3824002	3824682	Wow.
3824862	3825783	On its Kinect.
3826023	3827444	It's the fat box one.
3828906	3836192	The 32 megabytes is basically just to put it in its actual, so it runs off an actual console.
3836292	3838413	Tigerclaw in chat says, yeah, he's right.
3838493	3843257	The first crop of games won't take full advantage of the hardware until, whoa, what the hell?
3843337	3846840	Until, don't paste five lines at once when I'm trying to read.
3847381	3855447	Tigerclaw says, the first crop of games won't take full advantage of the hardware until like a year or so later when the developers finally figured out how to push the hardware to its limits.
3855768	3856849	But that happens with every console.
3857449	3861816	What was that Rome game?
3862337	3863599	Rise from York Wave.
3864621	3870591	They were saying that it looks choppy right now and that this might smooth out some frame rates or something, but we'll see.
3872808	3877472	Wow, a fifth dream in that big post he put says the Micro Machines guy is not dead.
3878012	3878372	Yes!
3879233	3881815	But seriously though, if he was in that... I could have swore he was dead.
3881855	3882996	I swore he was dead too.
3883176	3885218	Well, I mean, I didn't like swear like, God, I hope he's dead.
3885238	3890102	He'd be dead within the first 15 seconds of that, you know, Eddie Murphy movie, One Thousand Words.
3890742	3894205	So... Well, maybe, maybe not.
3894225	3897587	I'm looking at the Wikipedia article and sure enough, Wiki says he ain't dead.
3897607	3897808	Huh.
3897828	3898048	Huh.
3899397	3899917	Well, that's good.
3899957	3901618	Then maybe I'm thinking of somebody else.
3901999	3903860	No, it was... What was his name?
3904800	3905421	Chris Latta.
3906321	3906902	I was thinking of.
3907262	3909003	Well, he just needs to come back and do something.
3909123	3909443	Anything.
3909523	3909883	I don't care.
3909903	3911204	I need him talking in something.
3911804	3915807	Trailer, TV, movie, it doesn't matter.
3916605	3917846	I was thinking of Chris Latta.
3918306	3925249	At least that urban legend, I can understand someone falling for that because I could swear I've heard that that guy's dead too.
3925289	3928930	It's not like you came on here and said the kid from The Wonder Years is Marilyn Manson.
3929431	3930311	People believe that?
3931031	3936634	Yeah, it was Chris Latta that died in 1994 and he was the voice of Starscream in Cobra Commander.
3937434	3938394	Oh, okay.
3939455	3941956	I have the stupid Transformers analogy in my head.
3942352	3948995	All right, look, we're getting way off track, so why don't we talk about some release dates, some video games that we could play this week and get our mind off of dead celebrities.
3949696	3952557	There is not a much coming out this week.
3952657	3957240	It's basically just one 3DS game, and it's Crash City Mayhem.
3958280	3967685	The only reason I think it's kind of cool for the 3DS is it's based off a really old series called Runabout, which is on the Sega Dreamcast and PlayStation 1.
3968406	3976270	Or, you know, if you played it over here in the United States, it was Felony 179, a racing game where the whole point of the game was to crash in the shit.
3976450	3978672	And it was awesome and super glitchy.
3979212	3985856	I remember one time I took a full-size bus, a tour bus, and I tried to go through the train tunnel
3986656	3988316	I don't even know how I got it in the train tunnel.
3988577	3991997	And I tried to turn around like you know you do in the Austin Powers movie.
3992418	3998599	And it got stuck in there in such a way that it started spinning like a helicopter until it got enough speed where it shot straight up through the roof.
3999199	3999660	Hilarious.
3999900	4000320	Good times.
4000600	4000740	Yeah.
4001080	4001380	That's it.
4001460	4002340	That's all that's coming out this week.
4002600	4002820	All right.
4002840	4003881	Well, let's go over to Japan.
4003921	4008442	And on July 4th in Japan on the PlayStation 3, Loki's really excited.
4008482	4008702	Yes.
4009062	4011544	Earth Defense Forces 4 is out.
4011844	4013906	I may have to import that.
4014166	4015467	It'll cost you $71.49.
4016348	4018610	I may have to import that.
4019170	4025295	You could also import for much cheaper a Smart Headset 3, which is also released on the PlayStation 3.
4026716	4027557	Who cares, right?
4027637	4028998	How about on the Xbox 360?
4029198	4030338	Also, Earth Defense Forces 4.
4030839	4033841	There's also a limited edition with gold membership for $86.99.
4033961	4038464	I'm assuming that's like Xbox Live Japan, because you know who's paying for Xbox Live over there.
4038864	4040145	Very few people, I'm sure.
4041486	4043807	Nothing of note on the Vita this week.
4043888	4045148	I'm just looking at my other releases.
4045589	4047090	Yeah, nothing really on Wii U either.
4047130	4049811	Did you know they don't have new Super Luigi U until July 13th?
4050132	4051813	Oh, I bet that's the retail release, though.
4052473	4054495	They probably have the download version, just not the retail release.
4054756	4055997	Well, how about on the Nintendo 3DS?
4056337	4058479	There's a couple games there.
4059160	4063404	Toriko Gourmet Battle comes out, as well as Mame Goma Happy Sweets Farm.
4064285	4065667	That sounds nice.
4065867	4069630	I want to see... God, I hope it's not another game starring scantily clad characters.
4069791	4071893	Oh, it's the little seal cute thing!
4072529	4074710	Yes, that stars a little seal cute thing.
4074830	4076651	I love the plushies of the little seal.
4076791	4078012	Oh God, these things are adorable.
4078032	4079633	It looks like they just kind of wither on the ground.
4079653	4080513	They're so adorbs.
4080913	4081834	And they run a farm.
4081954	4084735	It's Farmville and they also make sushi rolls.
4086016	4086916	Rob, that's a sweet roll.
4087157	4088117	That's a sweet roll, my bad.
4088277	4089178	That's a Swiss cake.
4090118	4092239	Oh, it's a little Debbie roll with the strawberry.
4092639	4093660	It's called a Swiss cake.
4094730	4096171	Like I said, a little Debbie roll.
4097031	4098732	It's a strawberry shortcake.
4099852	4101473	I want them to localize that.
4101713	4103714	I want a fucking strawberry shortcake, damn.
4103874	4105715	You know we have strawberry cheesecake ice cream at my house.
4107196	4108977	Who's going to my house after the show?
4109077	4111618	No, because that would involve going outside, I'm sorry to say.
4112779	4114119	That's it for Japanese releases.
4114219	4115220	DarkSakura, how about the UK?
4115899	4116679	Some stuff.
4117600	4119021	Stuff and things are coming out.
4120041	4124363	What we have on July 3rd is we have Limbo for iPad and iPhone.
4124423	4126284	Oh my god, I need that on my phone.
4128305	4128645	Not really.
4129086	4130626	Mortal Kombat Complete Collection.
4131027	4132467	Sorry, Complete Edition.
4132848	4137150	They should have called it Complete Collection, but no, I see why, because then they would have been racist.
4138090	4138851	That's on PC.
4139111	4139951	Well, you know what I mean.
4140651	4141572	Too many, too many...
4143399	4152326	and we have a Scourge Outbreak on Xbox 360 and on July 4th we have Trackmania 2 Valley and on the 5th we have Dark.
4154108	4154568	Sakura?
4155049	4155989	No, just Dark.
4156490	4156990	Sakura.
4157371	4159092	It's a vampire stealth action game.
4160954	4163115	I don't know why but that made me think of Craig Ferguson.
4163496	4166418	Being published by Atlas because they publish Calypso games now.
4168140	4171362	It made me think of Craig Ferguson talking about damp being a color.
4172475	4175857	Just a couple more news stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week, Loki.
4176298	4177238	Or don't.
4179940	4183743	So there's some cool stuff being added to Steam.
4184283	4189707	First off, the Source Software Development Kit now is including native support for the Oculus Rift.
4190027	4196031	So if you have the dev kit, you got more games to play it on, or at least hopefully soon.
4197653	4200635	So they're really embracing that, and that's going to be kind of cool.
4200655	4200795	Cool.
4201755	4205318	And then finally, the Steam trading cards.
4205818	4206519	It's out of beta.
4206919	4207999	Now it's available to everybody.
4208280	4225131	So far it supports 30 games, including Team Fortress 2, Faster Than Light, Grid 2, Monaco, Trying 2, Super Meat Boy, Counter-Strike Global Offensive, Portal, Half-Life, Don't Starve, and Borderlands 2.
4225811	4231455	Okay, so at the risk of sounding like a complete moron, can someone explain to me how the trading card thing works?
4231535	4234357	Because it's not based on achievements.
4234537	4235878	It's based on time playing the game.
4236458	4237439	I know.
4237559	4240561	So, yeah, I think it might be on achievements.
4240921	4242742	I think it's just based on time playing the game.
4243242	4245204	I noticed I have a Steam level now, too.
4245304	4248185	So you get, like, XP, and I think some of that's from the trading cards, right?
4248205	4251187	But I got a lot from participating in old sales and things like that.
4251488	4254249	Which, by the way, July 4th is next week.
4254289	4255070	You know what that means.
4255390	4276444	Barbecue at my house Hide your wallets Hide your wife, hide your kids Cause steam sales is gonna happen I ain't got cash for that shit And they slashing all the prices on up here See, here's the thing though, I've already bought so much stuff I don't really know if there's much more I need All I need is that Civ 5 expansion That's all I need No, Rob, you want it
4279366	4280447	You need air.
4280847	4281688	No, I fucking need it.
4281708	4282548	The new expansion?
4282588	4283529	Which expansion?
4283569	4284710	Will you die without it?
4284770	4289733	Yeah, you need me to get it because otherwise you will not want to be on this program with me.
4289753	4290714	Oh, we'll have grumpy Nick Trump.
4290734	4294456	Are you talking about the new expansion coming out in July or the one that's... The one that's like a couple weeks.
4294496	4295797	You know July is tomorrow, right?
4296218	4300220	I understand that, but no, you're talking about the one that's coming out in... Brave New World.
4300520	4303502	It's not going to be on the Steam sale, but it's something on Steam I need to get.
4303542	4304163	Yeah, Brave New World.
4305526	4308388	Don't remember if that's next week or if that's going to be the week after next.
4308628	4309308	I think it's the 8th.
4309888	4313110	I think they're releasing it just in time for my boyfriend's birthday.
4313230	4315912	I think there's like all of two games on Steam right now I'm interested in.
4317012	4319113	And one of them is that Miami.
4319734	4320594	I can't ever remember.
4320634	4321374	Hotline Miami.
4321835	4326417	Because I want to go around shooting people in bloody messes with weird synth music.
4326517	4328638	Should have gotten in on that with the Humble Bundle, man.
4328718	4329719	I know, I know.
4329739	4330419	Good prices there.
4330739	4331700	But I have Bill's.
4334230	4334750	Oh, Bills.
4335451	4337492	All right, let's see.
4337512	4339313	I just had to do something like go to Alabama.
4339953	4343735	All right, one more story for you guys here, and this is a follow-up to something we had talked about before.
4344095	4349218	Apparently, Nintendo may have been easing up a bit on the whole Let's Play video thing.
4349238	4361944	Remember that they were really unpopular for a week there because they didn't shut down Let's Play videos, but they were like, we're going to take the money and use it for us if you have a Let's Play video that features our newer games.
4362404	4363905	Thank you, OuyaLaunch.
4386098	4386958	You think that's part of it?
4387218	4387839	No, no, no.
4389120	4397024	Since you mentioned analytics and stuff like that and getting paid on stuff, I just happened to check my... Well, here's the timing on this.
4397565	4404809	It's part of the revenue reports because on May 14th, his ad earnings ceased, but then they started again on May 23rd.
4405290	4410713	So he made a leap of faith since he saw the revenue return and no other claims have been made on his videos since.
4411073	4413555	So Nintendo may have given up as fast as they implemented it.
4413575	4414176	I mean, that's what?
4414396	4415437	Two weeks, if even?
4416097	4420581	You know, when we talked about this on Game Buoy, this kind of was an unpopular opinion, actually.
4420641	4426826	But I just didn't really understand people actually making a living off of Let's Plays.
4428007	4428668	It happens.
4428728	4430870	If it works for you, I guess more power to you.
4430930	4437515	Well, as I mentioned before, because I started monetizing some of my YouTube videos just...
4438836	4439157	and so on.
4463783	4465824	I'm in the wrong fucking business.
4466065	4468066	This is the last episode of OLR, everybody.
4468086	4476410	It was wonderful these last 11 years, but we're moving to YouTube next week in our little five-minute chunk segments, which will just be Loki and I arguing and DarkSakura crying.
4476790	4478091	Well, no, no, no.
4478491	4480893	Dan and I were actually talking about doing this with our TurboGrafx games.
4480913	4482373	It'll be fun.
4483034	4484094	Yeah, there's money to be made.
4484134	4488617	I mean, I'm not looking to make a living off of putting YouTube videos out there, but...
4490146	4492887	It's $36 I didn't have before.
4492907	4492887	$36?
4493007	4498290	That's about halfway to the Earth Defense Force 4.
4498630	4499331	There you go.
4500171	4500671	Absolutely.
4500711	4501031	Wow.
4501452	4511997	Well, you know, and I'm kind of actually, Slidekick, I know you said that it was an unpopular opinion, but I think when we talked about this on the show originally, I actually kind of voiced a very similar thing where I'm like, really?
4512277	4513157	You can make a living off this?
4513478	4513678	I mean...
4514418	4518640	I mean, no shade to those that do very well with Let's Play videos.
4518740	4519501	I have a respect.
4519821	4521202	It takes work to do this podcast.
4521242	4522823	It takes a lot of work to do those Let's Play videos.
4523183	4528305	But you have to admit you do owe some of the success to the game that you are featuring.
4528546	4528986	You know what I mean?
4529446	4529706	Yeah.
4529846	4535529	So, if they want to come in and get a cut... But I think Nintendo just kind of did a dick move by cutting it all off, you know what I mean?
4535829	4537910	Like, there should have been some type of sharing, you know?
4538210	4542091	The Let's Play content gets something, but Nintendo gets a little something-something too.
4542332	4545433	Or, you know, they get their own commercials in there, you know, things like that.
4545713	4548354	Yeah, they need to take a smaller cut, you know?
4548414	4550395	Like, circumcision, not Lorena Bobbitt.
4553216	4554277	What is wrong with you?
4554317	4556778	That is a great analogy.
4557579	4557819	Bump.
4558419	4558679	Thanks.
4559360	4560260	I don't want your hand disease.
4560300	4561861	Don't fist bump him for that.
4562141	4562521	I did.
4563042	4566684	I didn't high five him because I don't like... I hope you get the blister thing.
4566704	4568865	It's not going to happen.
4569185	4569926	Here, Rob.
4570426	4571687	Don't touch me.
4571727	4572867	Don't wash your hands.
4573207	4573568	Fine.
4574248	4576149	You can't get it from touching my hands.
4576950	4578570	I'm not afraid of germs.
4580148	4581957	Clearly you're not afraid of germs.
4582057	4584288	If she starts handling my feces, I can't make any promises.
4589107	4590607	Do you have a diaper fetish, Loki?
4590667	4591287	No, I do not.
4591367	4592008	Oh, that's good.
4592068	4592548	That's good.
4593408	4595568	I thought that was just your dinner that smelled.
4596769	4603650	For the record, if you would pay attention, the more you expose yourself to germs, the stronger your immune system gets.
4603670	4611152	And it's very good chance if you were a kid that went to preschool or something like that, you probably already have had this and you won't catch it again.
4612292	4615993	Yeah, for the most part, when kids have this, they don't even develop the blisters.
4616473	4617953	They'll run a fever and have a sore throat.
4618113	4618273	Yeah.
4618773	4623698	ShadowNextGen says, YouTube also has a policy where you can't monetize videos for content you don't own.
4624078	4628642	So this whole thing is a bit confusing to me as to how it was allowed to happen in the first place.
4628722	4630544	That's a comment from live.vognetwork.com.
4631284	4637109	And ClericalError404 follows this up with, it's been about 15 years since I heard a Lorena Bobbitt reference.
4637510	4638150	You're welcome.
4638410	4641633	Keep it classy and old school here at OLR.
4641974	4642874	That's way too long.
4642894	4643435	Yeah.
4644358	4645159	Well, here's the thing.
4645179	4656206	I think that the whole YouTube policy originally was just to prevent people from, okay, some dude makes a video and then I copy said video, put it up on my channel and monetize it.
4656287	4664392	Here's me humming along to this new movie that's out in theaters, Man of Steel.
4664412	4668575	Man of Steel, Man of Steel, Man of Steel.
4668955	4673359	And it's my little, you know, that would be very bad, I think.
4675801	4680064	I paid good money for this hue card and I own all the data on it.
4681686	4686310	I paid an entire $5 from the garage sale for this hue card.
4686870	4687351	I own it.
4687811	4691935	Alright, DarkSakura is clearly stepping into a time portal over there so you know what that means.
4692095	4695158	It's time for the classic game of the week.
4696477	4707642	Every week, DarkSakura goes into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey, you kids and your YouTubing and making careers off of Mario U, you know what?
4708123	4714626	You need to go back to my day when we used to pay $400 for a frickin' Neo Geo game and we liked it.
4715206	4717949	and really weird games were really cool.
4718009	4721212	Yeah, well, really weird games are kind of still cool, let's be real.
4721252	4722133	But this one was weird.
4722193	4724875	This one was weird, and it's not in the OTO, it's a little newer than that.
4725116	4726557	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
4726817	4728499	The classic game of the week is Mr. Mosquito.
4728519	4730040	It's weird.
4730180	4734465	I figured to go for a PS2 era, you know, finally moving up a little bit.
4735205	4738689	Mr. Mosquito was... This is Rina's room again.
4738949	4739069	Oops.
4739329	4740169	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4761276	4764078	and the following March in everywhere else.
4764639	4766440	And it was distributed by Eidos.
4768782	4774986	Basically, you play as a mosquito who has taken up residence in the Yamada family's house.
4776968	4783993	I wonder if they were voiced by the Japanese voice actors because the accents are really thick.
4784273	4786394	I mean, they're legit accents too, so...
4787515	4796502	Anyway, you have to stock up on enough blood in the summer so that you will survive through the winter ahead, which is funny because don't mosquitoes only live for like a week?
4797262	4803187	Anyway, so you can collect these spheres to save extra blood.
4803767	4825802	and you have to suck the blood from them while they're going about their everyday business but you can only get it from certain body parts at certain times like this scene here with the girl on her bed you can only suck it from her upper thigh he's getting a little close to the no-no spot so this is a little bit of a scandalous game he's actually close to the femoral artery
4827984	4833231	Anyway, if he is swatted while sucking, then instant death occurs.
4833271	4838017	Basically you have a stress meter so you have to balance your suck with your stress.
4839439	4840100	Don't we all?
4841866	4869359	and then to calm them basically they will try to battle you too like a big boss battle like what we're watching right now on this video where you have stress points that you have to I guess sting them on or bite them on that are meant to calm them so it's like you're doing acupressure on them you're doing mosquito shiatsu there you go you can get smacked all over the room and it's really hilarious
4869761	4871022	So you have different stages.
4871042	4873284	You can go through different parts of the house.
4873805	4877088	And you have different items, different things to help you.
4879530	4886216	The fun thing about this game too is that your ending depends on how much sucking you did.
4887122	4888263	Like how successful you were.
4888283	4894306	Because for the Yamada family, they're going to have their family portrait taken at the end of the summer.
4895547	4902291	And it's like if you completed all the missions and everything, they're all puffed up and swollen all over their faces and the picture's horrible.
4903312	4921091	and it's really funny the voice acting is actually super hilarious too um as for the game it was voted one of the top 10 weirdest games of all time in 2008 by Game Informer and um G4 put it on its list of weird games and uh
4923093	4930215	It was really weird, but Famitsu said it was the fifth best-selling video game in Japan during its release.
4931035	4933295	It sold 41,006 copies.
4935796	4942617	It also got a release on PlayStation 2 the best, and it led to a sequel in Japan on July 3, 2003 called K2 Let's Go Hawaii.
4945658	4946219	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4964256	4980525	but this game was just wrong and like you could do other stuff too like you could distract the people in the room by like turning off the light switch or changing the music or doing all this other stuff it's just bizarre but it works it's a very strange game but it's awesome like it's you just you have to see it
4981360	4994976	and like this week I wanted to pick games that were all in the same vein of Incredible Crisis because that game was fucked up and this game I'd have to put it's fucked upness level somewhere near Incredible Crisis so alright
4996532	4998053	There it is, your classic game of the week.
4998113	4999674	Mr. Mosquito on the PlayStation 2.
5001855	5003555	All right, very good pick tonight.
5004256	5005797	A little bit edumacational, too.
5006397	5007557	All right, don't go anywhere, guys.
5007577	5010559	We've got plenty more OLR to come tonight with more Slidekick.
5010939	5013020	The Fugle Question of the Week coming at you.
5013640	5016662	Going to talk a little bit about Ouya in the Fugle Question of the Week as well as some news.
5017262	5020623	And also we'll talk about the upcoming Moley Jam.
5021704	5022764	That's always hilarious.
5022965	5023785	So we're going to talk about that.
5024326	5030916	All that and more including your phone calls, CFUs of the week, Twitter topics and all that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
5042754	5050123	Hola, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican, Actdeft, and you're participating with Orange Noun Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.
5050723	5054307	And I want to use my voice to tell you that Kirby does not suck.
5055028	5058893	Well, literally he does suck, but not figuratively.
5059333	5060795	Anyways, play more Kirby!
5062674	5063494	Play more Kirby.
5063754	5064395	Do it now.
5064535	5069197	Well, not now, because you're trying to listen to LLR.
5069337	5070497	Poor guy, man.
5070517	5073659	We put forums in chat that it was like 112 degrees or something.
5074079	5074319	I know.
5074639	5075399	We're here bitching.
5076380	5077841	That's like tomorrow, though, by the way.
5078001	5079041	I did look up Phoenix.
5080342	5080882	Phoenix was at 116.
5080922	5084023	So Phoenix is like on fire.
5084163	5085664	What about Needles in Death Valley?
5085704	5087605	That's always the lousy place to look at.
5089005	5089446	Didn't we say 122?
5091761	5093522	Anyhow, that was a repeat bumper there.
5093562	5094904	That means we need more bumpers.

5112217	5115259	The call for bumpers is there, and it's very easy.
5115299	5116721	You can even Skype them in if you don't know.
5116781	5117081	Like, don't...
5117341	5118002	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5143439	5144059	We did.
5144139	5144660	We did.
5145180	5150023	And you sure love to rub it in how good at game show video games you are, huh?
5150443	5151864	I guess I just have a natural talent.
5152924	5155246	Do you practice Wheel of Fortune a lot as a kid?
5156006	5157607	Well, I played a lot of Wheel of Fortune as a kid.
5157627	5158427	5,000 paths.
5158467	5160909	We've had a Wheel of Fortune winner on the show.
5162139	5162879	Yes, I know, yes.
5162899	5164920	I kind of think I need to actually go on Wheel of Fortune.
5165160	5169903	Our buddy Mel, who needs to come back to the show, by the way, actually won a car on Wheel of Fortune like years ago.
5169923	5170023	Wow.
5170043	5171323	It was during Price is Right.
5171704	5172984	No, it was on Wheel of Fortune.
5173004	5173684	It was on Wheel of Fortune.
5173704	5175505	Because he even put up the clip of him winning.
5175885	5180908	Yeah, his Facebook cover photo is him solving the pumpkin pie or whatever his final thing was.
5181148	5183989	And I have been in that Camaro, and it was a bitchin' Camaro.
5184389	5186711	I have a co-worker that won a car on Price is Right.
5186751	5187011	Really?
5187211	5189752	Yeah, he won a car and like a China cabinet.
5190292	5193953	And the sucky thing they never tell you about winning prizes like that is that you have to pay taxes.
5194293	5195493	All these game show winners.
5196394	5198054	Oh, Alan's here to lend his commentary.
5198074	5198494	Yes, Alan.
5199554	5201275	Talking about prices right just reminded me of something.
5201515	5203815	There's going to be an all Plinko episode in September.
5204176	5204656	What?
5204756	5205476	Yeah, all Plinko.
5205956	5206756	August or September.
5206816	5207196	Google it.
5207396	5209257	If I'm working, I'm just going to quit and watch.
5211474	5211974	Viewing party.
5211994	5212814	Kidding, kidding.
5213435	5215555	I've never heard of a better reason to quit your job.
5217496	5219657	And you get Plinko, and you get Plinko.
5220497	5221558	Everyone gets a Plinko.
5221958	5225619	I'm surprised it's taken them 35 years or something to think about Plinko.
5225719	5233462	If they want, see, PopCap, telling you, if you're smart, you market that son of a bitch on that show right there.
5233962	5234322	Right?
5234542	5236063	Peggle 2, Plinko.
5237103	5239384	Rob, you were getting a little pressed during Press Your Luck, weren't you?
5239404	5241926	Well, I was getting very pressed during Press Your Luck.
5241986	5243106	How many whammies did you have?
5243226	5252411	I had three whammies in the first round and fucking... Okay, so I actually uploaded to my Twitter, twitter.com slash S-K-I-E, that's Sky, twitter.com slash Sky.
5253051	5255093	I've always liked more followers.
5255433	5258775	But I actually posted a picture that's like, Slidekick, I hate you so much.
5259055	5261857	Because it's me and I have three whammies and no money.
5261937	5263238	And he has no whammies.
5263258	5263678	He has like $7,000.
5264639	5266981	And I ended up with over $50,000.
5267161	5270783	Were you like the unemployed man who memorized the patterns and just sat and watched it?
5270803	5271444	Yes, he was.
5271484	5273045	You know what happened to that guy, by the way?
5273245	5273665	He died.
5273965	5274926	No, besides that.
5275106	5275766	What?
5276687	5280470	He went on all the trips and everything and ended up investing the money in this scheme.
5280490	5281310	Oh yeah, he lost it all.
5281330	5282631	And he lost all of it.
5282991	5283712	Oh, poor guy.
5283732	5285814	If you come into money, be smart.
5286735	5288958	You know, you can have one of my two trips to Rio, Rob.
5288978	5289278	It's okay.
5289318	5289799	Oh, shut up.
5289839	5290479	It wasn't real.
5290760	5296206	It wasn't real as the lengthy disclaimer when you boot up the game lets you know that the prizes are not real.
5296266	5297207	It's not a contest.
5298148	5303514	If I could make money winning game show video games, I'd just quit my job and do that in Let's Plays.
5304054	5305995	We could get you a string of pearls and an apron.
5325740	5326600	OK, that's a little bit awkward.
5326620	5327341	All right.
5327601	5330022	What were you going to say, DarkSakura, before I rudely cut you off?
5330042	5331062	I forgot.
5331883	5332623	It's for the best.
5332803	5333103	All right.
5333783	5334624	No whammies.
5335084	5335724	Stop.
5337785	5342927	DarkTetsuya says, I was just going to ask, are the patterns in the video game version like the old game show?
5343167	5343347	No.
5343407	5344608	They're a lot more randomized.
5344708	5347049	I highly doubt Slidekick had the time to memorize them.
5347769	5350430	If you hit X as fast as you can, you seem to never hit a whammy.
5350470	5352371	And Slidekick figured that out in about five seconds.
5353035	5354316	Well, one thing... Cheater.
5354456	5355377	One thing, too... Cheater!
5355657	5363985	...is that after this guy basically broke the system, earning all that money, they changed the patterns and added in an extra randomizer.
5364986	5367107	So... Oh, yeah, he made them change the game show.
5367248	5374294	Yeah, and basically, they couldn't actually call him out on cheating because he did what anyone could do.
5374494	5376115	Yeah, no, he didn't cheat.
5376135	5377997	They just told him he's not allowed to play again.
5378457	5378557	Um...
5380380	5381301	I'm gonna take all your money
5400287	5406255	I would love, like, an uncensored game show on TV.
5406535	5412002	Not necessarily that they have to have all the TNA and stuff, but, like, I'm just saying, you know, we're just like, fuck!
5412183	5413024	God damn it!
5413264	5413705	You know what I mean?
5414679	5415800	Why did I say that?
5415840	5417603	That's like the wrong answer completely.
5418143	5419865	This is motherfucking Jeopardy.
5419985	5423229	And then you also get bonus points based on how well you're judged.
5425251	5428916	Where all the trivia answers have to start with what the fuck.
5430077	5431919	What the fuck is I don't care, Alex?
5433681	5440390	That makes me think of The Price is Right where you're the really hard ones where you have to step on the floor to step out the price of the car.
5440450	5444455	They always look to their family members and they can just be like, I fucking hate my family.
5444475	5445776	You're all fucking walking home.
5446137	5446637	Fuck you.
5446678	5448400	And like Drew Carey's all really uncomfortable.
5452322	5462065	Oh god, alright Moving on, we're talking too long about game shows Actually you can never talk too long about game shows Is that the Press Your Luck game that I got you like ages ago?
5462085	5480012	Yes, the DVD game, I still have that I was gonna say I've talked about before how badly I need to go on a reality game show And I don't think I could do Survivor Because if I didn't eat for 13 days I would be the biggest bitch I would get voted out so fast If I didn't eat for one day I'd be a bitch, let's be real
5480832	5482013	I can't go on Big Brother.
5482133	5484395	No, you would be a big bitch if you didn't have Pinkberry near you.
5484515	5489138	I can't go on Big Brother anymore because I don't know if y'all are following this season, but what a bunch of racists.
5489538	5491599	I mean, it's pretty sick in that house right now.
5492300	5495722	Paula Deen ain't got nothing on some of those people in the Big Brother house this season.
5497803	5501846	So I was going to say there's a new show on ABC that's pretty fucking hilarious.
5502286	5503267	It's called Whodunit.
5503947	5530073	And it's like Clue meets The Mole Which by the way, I know a lot of you judge reality TV shows And that's fine, a lot of it needs to be judged But The Mole was the best reality game show they ever had I'm like, if you're gonna try any reality TV, do The Mole So somebody decided to adapt The Mole into a Clue game called Whodunit But here's the great part Is that at the end of the episode Whoever scored the lowest on the quiz dies
5531113	5536356	They become the victim in the next episode So the episode, literally, like the first episode aired, right?
5536697	5552086	And so the guy who lost and didn't get the case right and got the lowest on the quiz He runs out at the very end, somebody set him on fire and he falls into the pool dead And he's all like, obviously it's all fake, it's makeup and all that stuff But all these people on Twitter were like, did they start killing people on TV?
5552126	5552706	What the fuck?
5553207	5554748	Ratings, oh my god Right?
5555028	5556109	But I was like, dude
5556869	5560132	He lost this game and he literally had to die in a fire.
5560332	5561393	That is amazing.
5562193	5563735	Like, did DarkSakura write this game?
5563795	5565776	It's the closest we're going to get to Battle Royale.
5567317	5568278	Happy Hunger Games.
5569719	5572542	There's supposed to be a Hunger Games game show on CW this year.
5572722	5579387	Yes, but it's not Hunger Games, but it's so fucking obviously a thirsty ripoff of the Hunger Games.
5579507	5580768	It's like, what?
5580788	5581509	Wait, let me hear your book.
5582149	5582890	What, the Hunger Games?
5582950	5583771	It's on his Kindle.
5584411	5584551	Okay.
5586373	5589294	This is why I hate Kindle.
5589754	5590135	Shit.
5591595	5596418	There's a thing called the internet where it's probably there.
5598659	5603122	I like books where I can smell paper and ink and cry.
5603382	5605483	Somebody in chat has to know this show I'm talking about.
5605543	5608205	It's on the CW.
5608225	5612747	The CW doesn't have anything except the Whose Line Is It Anyway reboot starts in a couple weeks.
5613067	5613427	Really soon.
5614668	5615468	I'll have to watch that.
5616088	5617809	And it has the lady.
5618469	5620709	I just googled CW Hunger Games show.
5620769	5621530	It's called The Hunt.
5623210	5623610	The Hunt.
5624290	5625250	It's not The Hunger Games.
5625270	5625911	It's The Hunt.
5626891	5627731	It's just like it, though.
5627771	5629631	I tell you, 10 years from now, Battle Royale.
5630312	5636213	The one I can't wait for on ABC is called The Quest, which is supposed to be The Amazing Race meets a LARP.
5637429	5638730	Oh my god, that sounds awesome.
5638830	5639771	I would watch that one.
5640151	5642253	I was like, how do I get cast for this show?
5642333	5645596	Because I would want to fucking go on the quest as a LARP.
5645716	5646816	LARPers of the world unite.
5646837	5647937	It would be amazing.
5648037	5652501	Anyway, it's like the producer of... I was a proud former LARPer, so whatever.
5652541	5655724	It's the amazing... Well, I did Rocky Horror Picture Show, which is really close, okay?
5655744	5656184	Yeah.
5656204	5656324	It's...
5657805	5661268	The Amazing Race producers and the Lord of the Rings producers or something like that.
5661688	5662108	Making it.
5662268	5668653	It's when you go to a live action vampire game and you see the people actually rigged up with the fake blood and everything spraying it everywhere.
5668713	5669413	That's awesome.
5669974	5671755	I've seen the people throw the magic bags.
5671835	5674197	The little bags that are supposed to be like, I'm throwing ice at you.
5674937	5675558	You can't see me.
5678502	5681245	Oh my god, oh my god, we need to have an OLARP.
5683328	5686712	No, and for anyone... Who would pay money to charity, of course?
5686792	5687132	A charity.
5687192	5689635	If we did an OLARP, who would pay money?
5690156	5690456	I would.
5691698	5692118	I'm broke.
5692519	5698546	For the record, what I did to Rob was I did the Obfuscate thing, which is also stolen by John Cena if you watch wrestling.
5698906	5701069	Wrestling Reference Bobby, uh, anyway.
5701830	5705995	He does the waving his hand in his face and it's the you can't see where I am type thing.
5706035	5711381	You know, Melody was just asking me how she could raise money for her team and training thing that she's doing.
5712703	5712963	O.L.
5712983	5713304	Flarp.
5713504	5713724	O.L.
5713744	5713985	Larp.
5714265	5714665	I love it.
5715546	5716608	Loki, are you gonna do it?
5716708	5717168	Come on, Loki.
5717188	5718210	Sounds so ridiculous.
5718270	5718450	Yeah!
5723240	5724301	I'm so fucking excited.
5724381	5724681	Alright.
5725581	5726302	Let's move on.
5726682	5727042	And Rob?
5727262	5727482	What?
5728523	5729023	Here's the rule.
5729304	5730004	Okay, here's the rule.
5730064	5731465	We each pick a video game character.
5732385	5733526	And we have to cosplay.
5733886	5734627	Nope.
5734687	5735987	Nope.
5736448	5736568	Nope.
5736588	5737448	You don't have to do Tingle.
5737488	5738189	You can do your Sackboy.
5738209	5740030	You should walk around in Sackboy.
5740050	5742351	I already have a costume.
5742371	5743352	We'll do it when it's cold.
5743832	5744812	Yeah, yeah.
5745293	5747654	We have to go out to Vacaville and the Nut Tree.
5749775	5752796	and play in the 112 degree heat.
5752816	5753977	No, for anyone who doesn't know.
5753997	5754337	He's dead.
5754537	5755257	He's on the ground.
5755277	5756037	He's not moving.
5756658	5759699	Behind the nut tree is where the old Wren Fairgrounds used to be.
5760579	5761339	That would be perfect.
5761359	5762960	You know where we used to do LARP, Rob?
5763700	5767321	We used to do it in the courtyard at my college at the University of South Alabama.
5767742	5771903	And because that's the only thing there is to do that's exciting in Alabama, it's still going on probably.
5772383	5775404	Actdeft wants to know what does the F in FLARP stand for?
5775824	5777485	You only know if you like Homestuck.
5778417	5779118	Oh, God.
5779638	5779959	All right.
5780819	5783602	And, of course, Ragenator says Loki should LARP his tingle.
5783682	5784002	All right.
5784523	5784863	He won't.
5784943	5785223	All right.
5785323	5791129	Let's do some rapid-fire news because we're 12 minutes into Part B and haven't even touched rapid-fire news yet.
5791189	5792089	Thanks, Slag Kick.
5792109	5792890	This is all your fault.
5792930	5802499	It would be potentially cooler, though, than wearing that Zack Boy costume because that thing is like two or three layers of sweats in the summer.
5803320	5805361	Yeah, that'll be fun.
5806042	5806683	Alright, anyways.
5807143	5811407	So Nordic Games, they've been acquiring and acquiring and acquiring.
5811768	5821196	They bought up a bunch of the old THQ properties and now they're buying up some of Atari's properties including Desperados and Silver.
5822397	5827520	Um, and you may remember, Atari, you know, they've been selling off parts of their company.
5828060	5830001	So, I wonder who's buying Marvel Metas, seriously.
5830861	5838425	Um, and I guess they, um, I'm not sure what they're gonna do with it, but, you know, make some westerns, I guess?
5839645	5839966	I don't know.
5841666	5850451	Uh, Silver, I've not really, I'm not familiar with, but I guess that came out, um, was an action RPG in, uh, on the PC and Dreamcast back in 99, so...
5853245	5861849	Retro City Rampage has been adding some new updates, including mod support, which is pretty sweet.
5862249	5866731	You can create your own vehicles and characters, fonts, color palettes, etc.
5867571	5877495	They have a new Retro Plus mode, which adds some more visual effects, including soft shadows and doubling the number of colors on screen.
5878675	5891279	and also I guess this is going to be coming on Steam via automatic update and then on Good Old Games you have to log in and just re-download I guess grab the 1.11 update
5893300	5894441	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5914102	5921865	And then last but not least, Project Anarchy, a brand new mobile development toolkit from Havok.
5922785	5924745	And did I mention it's free?
5925005	5933328	So you'll be able to use it to create some pretty awesome 3D games and freely publish on Android, iOS, Tizen.
5934268	5935509	I'm not sure what Tizen is.
5936449	5941071	And I guess it also has a provisional license to develop for but not publish on Windows.
5942842	5944264	Okay.
5945765	5953133	Yeah, and I guess it will support low-level C++ access, Lua scripting, debugging, and other fun stuff.
5953153	5955596	It includes tutorials and sample projects as well.
5956557	5962263	So if you want to check that out, I would imagine you just go to Havoc's website, and it should be there.
5962283	5963544	What the hell is Tizen, though?
5963564	5964845	I've never heard of Tizen.
5965987	5975137	It's like an operating system for some smartphones, tablets, and vehicle infotainment, smart TVs.
5975277	5976879	I have not heard of that.
5976919	5978220	Something else to build a console out of.
5978480	5979141	I guess, yeah.
5979722	5986770	All right, well, the potentials of this could have been epic, but it was unearthed an old ad from the Consumer Electronics Show from years ago.
5987210	5988171	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6003148	6006389	Final Fantasy 2 was supposedly going to come out here at one point, but we all knew that.
6006650	6011992	One of those big Lost Levels website or whatever kind of chronicles what happened with that game, and it didn't come out.
6012532	6013932	But a lot of people didn't know this.
6014012	6019375	Final Fantasy 3 was apparently planned at one point, but it clearly didn't get very far along.
6019635	6027618	There's even some mock-up box art that shows the Nepto Dragon possibly there, some sea monsters clutching wood on a broken ship.
6027998	6028738	Final Fantasy 2 and 3
6054588	6055989	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6076169	6079910	That's really cool because, God, I can't wait to play this game all over again in HD.
6079950	6080310	So pretty.
6080410	6080690	Yeah.
6081270	6082750	I'm just, like, so excited about this.
6083050	6084851	So, very cool.
6085071	6088492	I'm less excited about this, but it's not going to stop me from getting the game.
6089112	6091812	Final Fantasy X and X-2 HD Remaster.
6091892	6096393	Apparently, GameStop could be getting some type of limited edition exclusive or something.
6096853	6104595	There's a flyer out there that was dated June 26 that talked about a free limited edition upgrade if you pre-ordered the HD thing.
6105295	6116987	However, this is saying this could have been an error on GameStop's part because they apparently removed said mention and Square Enix has not said anything about it and it's not on GameStop.com.
6117347	6119189	So don't freak, y'all.
6119570	6125355	It must be reparations for the whole Deus Ex issue.
6125375	6126557	Yeah, that's right.
6126577	6128318	That wasn't that long ago, all things considered.
6129479	6151814	Anyhow, also, this is cool, a lot of people don't even realize there was a Game Gear Mega Man game And it was out there, it had some different bosses too, I don't recall Or was it some of the ones from 3, it only had like 4 bosses in it There was a whole series of different portable Mega Man games Like there was the WonderSwan one, and there was one other that I can't remember But there was the Game Gear one
6153120	6155341	The Game Gear version is on its way to the Nintendo 3DS eShop.
6176212	6176492	DarkSakura
6200495	6210937	Well, we do have, well, Xbox One, as far as headsets, they have to be wired and they're going to be sold separately.
6211418	6212778	They're not going to be packed in.
6213998	6223680	And they're basically saying that the only thing that you're getting with it is going to be the Kinect sensor and the microphone in there, but no actual headset.
6223940	6226481	So, trying to screw us out of more money, huh?
6226989	6232935	Yeah, it was sort of like that, though, at the launch with the Xbox 360, only the premium set had a headset.
6232955	6234297	I don't know.
6235856	6240697	They're basically saying that you can still talk to people, but you can't have a headset.
6240757	6249039	Honestly, I don't like the standard headsets because I wear headphones, so you can't wear two sets of headphones at the same time.
6249559	6250459	Well, I've tried.
6251260	6253440	Actually, that's how I do it on my headset.
6253900	6261442	I tape a headset that I ripped apart, and I just have the boom part of the microphone on there, and I tape it to the side of my...
6262262	6263102	on my headphones.
6263403	6264183	It works just fine.
6264883	6268165	I guess I could use Kinect, but then I'd be yelling across the room, so that wouldn't be fun.
6269025	6273027	Well, in other news, and this has to do with the Wii U, the Super Smash Bros.
6274267	6276968	release may actually lose some characters.
6277389	6287093	They're saying that they're working on getting as many characters in it as they can, but they may not have the full intended roster, although they will have, of course, the Wii Fit trainer fighting you with yoga.
6288414	6289234	I love her.
6291132	6296755	Well, it's just like, if I knew that I could punch somebody with the warrior pose and have them go across the room, I'd be doing that more often.
6297155	6300797	It's one of those things I never realized how much I loved the idea until it was announced.
6300857	6302398	And I'm like, she should have been a character.
6302418	6303358	I love the memes.
6303418	6304459	Have you seen this already, cosplay?
6305419	6325750	of the Wii Fit Trainer of the Wii Fit Trainer that's amazing and then of course the Villager and our Mega Man I almost wonder if we'll see something like not really like a Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom you know but like a DLC Ultimate Smash Ultimate Smash with like new characters or something
6327023	6331686	Well, what they're saying here is that, I mean, the other big reason they may have to cut people is time constraints.
6332066	6333447	So they won't be able to bring everyone back.
6333487	6340530	But I mean, then again, there was like, what, Solid Snake before and Sonic and some Fire Emblem characters that no one cared about?
6340650	6341031	I'm sorry.
6342512	6343513	Dan cared about.
6343533	6344674	A lot of people care about.
6344734	6345976	Some people will miss them.
6346036	6353305	But yeah, I think some of those more like like I bet Captain Falcon will be in there with Roy and Mars or or no Star Fox will be in there.
6353325	6356649	But like his little buddy, like Falco won't won't be there.
6357299	6359760	It'll be the more secondary characters in some of those games.
6360140	6361520	Like Lucas from Earthbound.
6361540	6362640	You mean like the palettes?
6362680	6365561	I know people who would probably throw a fit if Lucas wasn't there.
6365681	6367181	I'll throw a fit if Ness isn't there.
6367281	6367801	Well, you know what?
6367821	6369342	People throw fits for any reason.
6369702	6370762	Because gamers hate everything.
6370842	6373742	Maybe just get rid of the palette swap characters.
6373762	6376543	You know, the ones that are basically the same moveset and everything.
6376603	6379344	As long as Zelda still has the chic transformation, I'll be happy.
6379424	6379964	Oh, I'm sure.
6380104	6380944	That's a must.
6381384	6385745	But they need to put Daisy in there and have the back of her head eye laser.
6387467	6389188	You know about the eyeball in the back of her head, right?
6389208	6390028	I heard about that, yeah.
6390068	6399351	Okay, in the original Smash Bros., if you look at the Daisy trophy, if you happen to scroll in super close to the back of her head, there's an eyeball in the back of her head.
6400592	6403933	And so now it's like this thing that like, you know what Mugen is, right?
6404853	6406914	The fighting game creator?
6407154	6411956	So for people who put Daisy in Mugen, they actually gave her a back of her head eyeball laser.
6412176	6412476	Wow.
6412496	6414917	Which is the big, grandiose eyeball laser.
6416970	6417811	I think it's hilarious.
6417851	6421533	And people have tried to say, oh, well, it's not there in Mario Kart.
6422314	6422914	It doesn't matter.
6423074	6425456	She has a great big eye on the back of her head like a tumor.
6425676	6426737	That's why her hair is so big.
6426777	6428558	It's full of secrets and eyeballs.
6428858	6429679	It's full of secrets.
6430199	6430459	You know what?
6430479	6435143	I'm going to use that for anybody else, especially when my hair frizzes out into fro mode.
6435623	6436864	I'm just going to say it's full of secrets.
6437824	6438745	You can thank Mean Girls.
6439906	6440206	Okay.
6440766	6441567	Well, I haven't seen that.
6442227	6442588	You should.
6442808	6443028	What?
6443048	6443128	What?
6443464	6444865	Doesn't it have Sarah Michelle Gellar in it?
6445086	6448589	No, it's Lindsay Lohan before she was on with the drugs.
6448849	6450551	And Rachel McAdams, is that her name?
6450731	6452653	What was the one that had Sarah Michelle Gellar in it?
6453413	6453794	Buffy?
6453934	6454294	Buffy?
6454314	6456076	No, she was in another movie.
6456096	6456796	Cruel Intentions.
6456816	6458118	Cruel Intentions, that was it.
6458778	6460760	That movie had a song that I liked, but I've never seen it either.
6460880	6463863	Yeah, that's the one where you can see Sarah Michelle going, but I wanna fuck.
6464824	6465064	Okay.
6468187	6469228	Were you volunteering?
6471963	6473544	Sarah Michelle Gellar is an attractive lady.
6473584	6475165	If you're Freddie Prinze Jr., then yes.
6476426	6478387	So anyway, you know what, though?
6478407	6482109	She does not look as attractive as she did on Buffy because she's all bone thin again now.
6482729	6484530	And not, you know, in good shape.
6485371	6485931	So anyway, okay.
6486271	6490033	Former King of Fighters developers are having some issues.
6490874	6496437	They were basically... They have an original 2D fighting game that they were...
6498254	6500335	Looking to have some development on.
6500435	6513583	It says that right now, and the game is called Yatagarasu, that they want to have it crowdfunded so that they can release the character in the game, and they're wanting it to be 10 playable characters at launch.
6513963	6519506	They have a funding goal of $68,000 right now, and it's on Indiegogo, and it can go up if it needs to be.
6521847	6524889	If it's not sucky like The King of Fighters 12 was, then go for it.
6527283	6529305	All right, I guess that does it for Rapid Fire News.
6529385	6532068	I'm a little opinionated when it comes to bad King of Fighters games, Rob.
6532268	6532568	Are you?
6532768	6533509	I would have never guessed.
6533709	6534150	You know what?
6534390	6538353	I figured it was appropriate, though, considering you just did a King of Fighters, or, well, sorta.
6538654	6538974	Sorta.
6539014	6539634	Fatal Fury.
6539715	6541416	King of Fighters prequel-ish.
6541716	6543858	Yeah, I'm going to do Art of Fighting next week, ew.
6544038	6544459	Are you really?
6544679	6544839	No.
6546240	6547622	I'm going to do World Heroes Jet.
6547762	6550144	Well, you know what I'm going to do is the Fugle Question of the Week right now.
6550484	6552186	It's Radio Fugle.
6557403	6562824	Take Facebook and Google+, slam them together, and you get one clusterfuck of a social networking site.
6562844	6570806	You also get the word foogle, which we ask a question every week of our Facebook and Google fan communities, and we read some of the answers here on the show.
6570986	6572106	I might read them all tonight.
6572146	6572946	We'll see how I'm feeling.
6572966	6573406	I haven't looked.
6573446	6574426	How many are on Facebook?
6576227	6577147	There's not a ton.
6577567	6578847	All right, I can probably get through them all tonight.
6578867	6579227	Here we go.
6580207	6582468	The Ouya officially hit shelves this week.
6583376	6584056	Did you get one?
6584677	6585377	Why or why not?
6585958	6594243	What do you think about these mobile platform consoles, especially considering there are more to come, such as Mojo and the rumors of an official Google Android console?
6594703	6595344	And GameSick.
6596224	6597845	Oh yeah, I said and more.
6598266	6606011	Alright, Red Entertainment says, unless the Ouya is something that'll make it so it's not so damn fucking hot outside, I will not be buying one right now.
6606391	6610156	Maybe I'll buy an Ouya in the future when the outside world is not trying to cook me alive.
6610556	6612338	Well, to be fair... That answer wins.
6612598	6612999	We're done.
6614040	6621589	Well, to be fair, one thing I do like about the Ouya controller is the face plates are made of metal, and so they're nice and cool on your hands.
6623592	6624113	Alright, fine.
6624173	6625414	We'll read other answers then.
6625994	6629177	Alright, so moving to Evil, E3VL.
6629657	6632279	No, unless I see more exclusive content for the system.
6632800	6641687	Also, the Ouya seems to have had bad customer service as of late, having shipped their console to retailers before providing all their Kickstarter backers with one first.
6642287	6647151	At least provide the backers with some store credit or free games instead of just apologizing.
6647712	6647892	Excellent.
6648232	6649454	We'll get into that in a little bit.
6649474	6652017	We're definitely going to be getting into that in a little bit.
6652197	6659326	Nietzsche says, Between the reports of horrible controller input lag and poor performance due to outdated hardware, I have no desire to get the Ouya.
6659686	6662429	It was a fun idea, but in my opinion, didn't work out.
6663270	6669136	Travis H says, Asus transformer tablet plus HDMI cable equals an Ouya I can take on the go.
6669616	6674921	Honestly, the only thing that I think that piqued my interest about the Ouya is having a system to throw emulators on.
6675301	6677703	Kind of like an all-in-one super nostalgia machine.
6677864	6679945	But I already have that with my tablet, so I'm out.
6680686	6682847	Wow, lots of hate for the Ouya on Google+.
6682887	6684128	Let's see if Facebook's any different.
6684688	6686870	Gally89 says, Nope, I don't see the need.
6686890	6688070	Juan, not for me at least.
6688711	6691892	Daniel S says, Everything I hear about the Ouya is that it's a piece of crap.
6692273	6697656	And putting more Android-based platforms is exactly what they need because market confusion and dilution is great.
6698396	6700117	I think there's a slash Sark in there.
6700797	6706040	Clover Nikon says, My wife and I enjoy playing games on our Google Nexus 7-inch Android Jelly Bean tablet.
6706560	6712803	My wife playing Simpsons Tap Game, I play Star Wars Pinball, and my father-in-law playing those Pokey Magic slot machine games when he borrows it.
6713223	6716725	If a shop here near me sold the Ouya, I would definitely buy one.
6717345	6717986	Well, there you go.
6718146	6720947	Finally, an answer we can say is a positive one.
6721407	6722388	Degenerate Johnny says,
6723641	6727803	says, it all seems oxymoronish to have a stationary platform for mobile games.
6728224	6731666	Honestly, I don't very much care for mobile games, 3DS and Vita excluded.
6732086	6736028	They don't offer the same amount of excitement and enjoyment that the big three consoles offer.
6736348	6745874	Console developers, including Valve, should take a lesson from the auto industry, and this is my Michigan side talking, there can be only three, and that's currently Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft.
6746194	6752518	Otherwise, you are doomed to walk the unfortunate path of the 3DO, Jaguar, and God rest its soul, the Dreamcast.
6752818	6752898	Aww.
6753498	6755579	Aw, that answer made me sad.
6755819	6761560	Yeah, but the difference between the 3DO and the Jaguar and the Dreamcast is that the Dreamcast wasn't shit.
6762740	6763141	Word.
6764061	6771083	Also, the 80s called and would like to tell you that there is room for more than three consoles, although then again it might lead to another crash.
6771203	6774363	We had the whole home computing wars, but that's another episode of the show.
6774763	6776084	Actually, we talked about that a lot last week.
6776564	6780405	Alright, ClericalEra404 left a pretty long answer here, but...
6780965	6782145	Since I like them, I'll read it.
6783306	6784286	No, I did not get one.
6784466	6797110	It has clever ideas, offering digital copies of games to first demo and then decide to upgrade to the full version, having an easy setup of plugging in an HDMI cable, a library of 200 games and counting, being able to run emulators to play games from older systems.
6797470	6799150	Almost a retro gamer's dream come true.
6799470	6802551	But the old saying is true that a system is only as good as the software.
6802851	6808553	And unfortunately, so far, it has been able to really wow... I'm thinking it hasn't been able to really wow anyone yet.
6809273	6809453	and more.
6830777	6833739	Code Man says, no, I don't have a justification for buying one.
6834019	6837881	It would just make my wife more addicted to Candy Crush, and I definitely don't need that.
6838062	6838462	LOL.
6839042	6841744	There's so much confusion with the platform, I think.
6842524	6845406	And there's no Candy Crush on it, thank God.
6845966	6847527	First off, okay, so what?
6847547	6848768	The console runs Android.
6848828	6850709	It doesn't make it a fucking mobile console.
6850930	6851030	It's...
6851790	6852210	It's not.
6852330	6854851	It's an operating system that runs Android.
6855151	6857992	It's just like Android runs on some of those smart TVs.
6858032	6860393	Does it mean your TV is a fucking mobile console?
6860793	6861493	No, it's not.
6861553	6862354	It's a TV.
6862954	6866095	So it's just an operating system that you're developing games for.
6866195	6876538	Yes, a lot of the first games that are coming over are going to be ports of games that are on the Android marketplace because you're porting an Android game to Android with some additional APKs in there.
6876598	6878119	So, of course, it's going to be like that.
6878620	6879884	But that's the thing.
6880125	6882393	The whole draw of this console is that it's an indie console.
6883024	6898858	Now, I'm not saying that there's everything that's positive about it, because yes, there's issues with the controller being, well, especially the first backer controllers, which I'm going through an issue right now where I'm trying to get mine replaced, because the analog sticks don't work correctly.
6899698	6900939	And that's on Ouya.
6901200	6902521	They need to fix that shit.
6902781	6909006	And, you know, since we're getting into some topic about, you know, Ouya...
6909827	6911610	Alright, can I read the rest of the answers here?
6911630	6911910	Yes, go ahead.
6911930	6912731	You still want to yell at people.
6912751	6913292	No, no, go ahead.
6913312	6914654	I'll save that for a second.
6914674	6914934	Alright.
6915235	6922124	DarkCharger says, I have a main cabinet for my emulation needs and everything else that I want can be handled by my consoles or smartphones and tablets.
6922545	6926390	An Ouya would be the epitome of a superfluous purchase.
6927431	6952309	AZHP says I didn't get one because I didn't realize it came out this week if there's no advertising how can I know when it's coming out I might pick one up soon for emulation purposes though and lastly Osfer says I'm just not interested the new consoles from the big three are the only ones that really have my attention that's all the answers from Facebook and Google thanks to y'all for answering join us on Facebook and Google Plus for next week's question alright slide kick you gonna get a new yeah
6952769	6956230	I was actually a very early backer.
6957551	6963372	Honestly, if I saw how it played out, I don't think I would have backed them.
6964313	6967274	I don't know.
6967434	6972075	You heard about all the mess with E3 and how rude they were.
6972715	6973195	I was there.
6973596	6976076	I took a picture of the big truck parked in front of the booth.
6976917	6981078	The Ouya thing at E3 was more of a developer showcase than it was the console.
6981718	6982018	Yeah.
6982058	6982539	It's too bad.
7000228	7001849	It's better than last year's Yu-Gi-Oh!
7001909	7006492	It's like, you know, I just don't know if that's a good precedent to set for gaming consoles.
7006992	7014736	Even though it's not directly trying to compete with the big three, but, you know, I just, I don't...
7015877	7016317	I don't know.
7016737	7022099	I actually, mine did arrive, and I've yet to unbox it, so I probably should at some point.
7022119	7022479	Oh, wow.
7023279	7028941	But Captain Spike also backed on Kickstarter before I did, and he hasn't received it yet.
7029201	7029741	Oh my god.
7030921	7033582	You know, I'll hook mine up eventually.
7033622	7035622	I hope that I don't have any controller issues.
7036203	7037223	When did yours arrive?
7037952	7041997	You know, it arrived in late April or May.
7042017	7043379	Oh, your controller's fucked.
7043499	7045101	Sorry.
7045141	7047124	It was late May is when they fixed that shit.
7048586	7050608	See, I didn't back this for that reason.
7050628	7051830	But it's all fixed now.
7051990	7052771	It's fixed now.
7052791	7053592	Yeah, but not for you.
7053973	7054193	Well...
7055194	7057116	It's fixed if I don't use the NUYA controller.
7057156	7065885	Thank God I can pair a PlayStation 3 controller to it, but the only thing is, not all games, you have to account for that, so they have to program in those button mappings as well.
7066285	7070529	I can, you know, for a lot of things, like emulators, I can play with the PlayStation 3 controller and it works great.
7070749	7073592	That's how I knew it was the controller, not the console.
7074253	7074433	You know,
7076113	7077454	I'm gonna get into it in just a second.
7078815	7079816	Some of the customer service things.
7079856	7080457	It's ridiculous.
7080557	7082959	Well, if... Why don't we go back into the gaming news?
7083039	7085501	Loki, why don't you start us off with a possibly related topic?
7085521	7086341	Let's talk about this.
7086381	7086882	This is great.
7086902	7087642	This is fantastic.
7087682	7090965	Right when they launched, there was two Kickstarter updates.
7091025	7092246	First there was one like, Hey!
7092306	7093687	We launched our console!
7094067	7095949	You know, we couldn't have done it without you.
7096249	7098511	To which there was a bunch of replies, Hey, you fucktard!
7098551	7101633	I haven't gotten my fucking console yet that I backed last year.
7101734	7102594	Where the fuck is it?
7102975	7103235	And then...
7103775	7106717	Julie comes out and says, I'm pissed!
7106937	7111339	I'm so pissed that we haven't been able to get some of those consoles to you.
7111719	7116101	You know, I promised that we'd ship them all, and I don't know what's going on.
7116121	7119323	We have people in, you know, Hong Kong that are checking into it and stuff.
7119543	7120683	I'll tell you what's going on.
7120723	7123185	You shipped it via fucking DHL.
7123785	7127647	DHL Global, first off, so slow-ass ship...
7128737	7138305	in the first place, and then you had to pass off to, because it was their global logistics mail or something like that, where they pass it off to the U.S.
7138385	7139286	Postal Service.
7140227	7142089	It takes so fucking long.
7142409	7144251	They didn't know what the hell was going on.
7144331	7146993	It basically said, oh, yeah, you're going to get an update on your tracking number.
7147013	7149195	It'll become active within a couple days.
7149595	7150836	It took a week.
7151096	7152718	My tracking number was never active.
7152798	7153879	It just showed up one day.
7154246	7156286	You were lucky if that thing showed up in the first place.
7156567	7163008	And then on top of all that, you had the issues where you were getting bummed controllers with the earlier backer additions, which I did.
7163808	7166389	And it's annoying because it doesn't work correctly.
7166649	7168009	And so I replied.
7168309	7170010	I sent a ticket for it.
7170050	7172250	I'm like, hey, I need this shit fixed.
7172770	7173851	So I sent them a ticket.
7174691	7179252	And I understand that they're a little busy with their console launch and stuff like that.
7179372	7180472	I sent it on Tuesday.
7180773	7182133	They got back to me today.
7182993	7184574	And here's what their response was.
7184694	7191297	It's like, as we continue to evolve the OUYA, making constant improvements to our product and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
7191417	7194558	You got a copy-paste from an outsourced customer service company.
7194598	7195058	I bet anything.
7195098	7196278	It's not even outsourced.
7196639	7197479	It took so long.
7197999	7204121	And basically saying, you know, the goal is you should look into the fact and see if you can solve your problem there.
7204141	7206042	I'm like, I have a fucking defective controller.
7206082	7207623	Your fact doesn't help me there.
7208263	7209424	It doesn't say anything.
7210044	7211905	So I sent a reply.
7211925	7213986	I'm like, listen, I have a defective controller.
7214006	7214967	I need to replace this shit.
7215387	7217608	Because you know what's going to happen if I can't get it replaced?
7217728	7218929	I'm going to go to the store.
7219449	7220590	I'm going to buy a controller.
7221290	7222811	I'm going to replace it with my controller.
7223051	7223872	And I'm going to return it.
7224452	7225713	That's a good idea.
7226333	7227734	Oh, shame on you.
7227914	7228895	But that's kind of...
7229915	7230816	It's clever.
7230976	7232637	I should not be supporting that.
7232657	7235740	I did something similar to that, but not really.
7236740	7249150	When Sonic Spinball came out, I got it for full price, and then Target had it for like $5 or $7 less, so I bought it at Target and returned it to Toys R Us.
7250131	7258918	So, I mean, it's not really like repackaging it, but I was like 10, and I felt like, ooh, what if they find out that this is actually from Toys R Us?
7259318	7260318	and Defective Allowments.
7260678	7261379	It's all right.
7261419	7280563	They're used to Defectives, but seriously, if they're not going to solve my problem because they're claiming that they're too busy right now, well, I'm sorry, but it's going to be hard for me to continue supporting your console if you're not going to give me a controller that fucking works since I only have one controller anyways and your additional controller is $60 fucking dollars.
7280763	7281803	Nope, not going to buy those.
7282404	7282724	Sorry.
7284284	7288027	So you're saying most of the cost of the system is the one controller that doesn't work?
7288687	7289388	That's their claim.
7289428	7290228	But here's the thing.
7290308	7294991	It's like I don't understand why the whole thing was a clusterfuck to begin with.
7295392	7296312	And I know it's going to get better.
7296352	7298293	And I actually haven't touched my console since May.
7298614	7300555	I did loan it to a friend, a co-worker.
7300595	7303437	He wanted to check it out for stuff, and so he did my updates and everything.
7303877	7305778	I guess the interface is a lot nicer now.
7305838	7309581	But a lot of the things that they promised, obviously, they didn't come through with.
7310021	7312843	One of the major ones, this console can be easily rooted.
7314925	7316786	You're going to be able to root it immediately once you get it.
7318027	7318548	Can't do that.
7319068	7319849	Can't do that at all.
7320650	7322111	It's very hacker friendly.
7322551	7323232	No, it's not.
7323412	7324393	It's not hacker friendly.
7324753	7326074	Aside from the fact that you can sideload.
7326515	7329838	Why not channel this energy into a complaint with the Better Business Bureau?
7330905	7332266	Because they're not going to do anything.
7332587	7332827	No.
7334088	7340714	It's not that whether they do something or not, it's still going to hurt their reputation and prevent them from being able to do business.
7340734	7343357	I'm sure there's tons of people who have already done that just for their backers.
7343377	7344498	Or is that just an excuse not to do it?
7345398	7347200	It is an excuse not to do it because I just don't care.
7347360	7348401	I don't care enough.
7348621	7351504	It's not like I dropped a ton of money.
7351544	7353666	It was $100 a year ago, and I just don't care.
7354827	7357751	And that's why companies get away with this because people don't care.
7357811	7358633	He wants to internet rage.
7358873	7361517	I want my controller to work and that's it.
7361597	7362358	Then that's fine.
7362758	7368366	So write them about it and tell them you're going to file a complaint and see how long it takes them to reply because trust me, they will reply.
7368487	7369107	They won't reply.
7370509	7370790	Seriously.
7371010	7381454	The moment you bring up the three, you know, the Better Business Bureau, especially for any company that wants to continue to do business, they tend to jump on that, especially if they've got other people doing the same.
7381474	7381874	Well, fine.
7381894	7388016	The next time I send them an update, I'll say I'll contact the Better Business Bureau and we'll see them do nothing because, you know.
7388556	7391737	Let me read some of the written word in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
7391797	7396619	Burr says, even the positive reviews are like, I like mine, but I haven't bought a game for it yet.
7396679	7397539	Just played the demos.
7398200	7405751	Seriously, a lot of the games on there are free to play right now, and everything has a free version of it, so yeah, a lot of it you don't need to necessarily buy.
7406332	7409477	Codeman says this is just a huge shit on the people who backed.
7411491	7425519	It is really inexcusable that they, you know, they got limited supply of the stores because they wanted to make sure they had that retail presence or whatever, but at the same time, they made a promise to everyone that backed them to, you know, deliver on that.
7425559	7438167	And if they can't deliver to, you know, people that ordered their console, I'm sorry, backed their Kickstarter and got a free console, however the fuck you want to word that, because you're not technically ordering anything, but, you know, whatever.
7439528	7442750	They made a promise and they couldn't even fulfill that.
7442810	7445932	They didn't give any firm numbers to what was shipping.
7445972	7449075	They just did this really generic line graph thing.
7449615	7454779	At a point at the beginning of June or something, they were like, all the consoles have shipped.
7455439	7455699	Really?
7455759	7458401	They've all shipped because no one's gotten them yet.
7459442	7462383	So, yeah, it was really weird.
7463764	7468067	I'm kind of curious to see what it's going to look like in three months' time.
7468687	7473830	If they're going to follow through with everything they promised about this console.
7473850	7474411	Because right now...
7475171	7475772	Thanks for watching!
7493096	7494677	Alright, well, I gotta move on.
7495158	7498641	I'm sure Loki could do an entire episode just about his hatred towards this whole thing.
7499381	7500502	Lesson learned.
7500622	7502924	Would you back another console after what happened to this?
7503204	7510490	Yeah, I would, but it would have to be a lot more research done into it.
7511111	7511932	That's how I feel, too.
7511972	7517996	Not that Google's gonna put a Kickstarter out there for a console, but it would have to be like if...
7519998	7521540	It would be different.
7522301	7527206	There's a different console that I keep seeing that they're trying to pitch.
7527266	7531650	This guy is kind of doing this, oh, it can do everything and stuff that you can't imagine.
7531690	7532271	It's amazing.
7532631	7537356	The Oton or whatever, it's like this autonomous console is basically supposed to procedurally generate games.
7538597	7565940	and that sounds neat I guess but it's just like the stuff that he's promising is ridiculous and so like it's just like yeah I'm not gonna back in any of this but he's planning on doing a Kickstarter so you'll probably see that at some point because he tried to get in unfortunately it was we got in and then they started requiring that anything that's electronics or something like that has to have an actual prototype a physical prototype made not just a concept so that's a problem
7566620	7571401	I think I would be reluctant to spend as much on Kickstarter anymore.
7571842	7583465	Usually I just put in about $15 to $20 for a game or something, but that was the first big Kickstarter amount that I put in, and I don't think I'd be as likely to do it anymore.
7584625	7585826	All right, well, let's move on.
7586927	7598857	Speaking of people who aren't likely to do certain things anymore, Bethesda, the vice president of PR and marketing, Pete Hines, in an interesting statement with, I believe it was Eurogamer, talking about, quote, We don't have Facebook stuff.
7598977	7600538	We don't have mobile stuff.
7600618	7603381	We feel like we really know who we are and what we're good at.
7603461	7605963	So, you know, you don't see Skyrim mobile or anything like that.
7606583	7610604	A while ago it was social games that were all the rage and people were asking, why aren't we doing Facebook?
7610884	7613445	That's not what we do and that's no longer a big deal.
7613565	7615885	So we didn't run after it and now we're not running away from it.
7616166	7618366	We're just going to kind of stick to what we feel is best.
7619146	7622567	By the way, it doesn't just extend to Facebook and mobile.
7622987	7628949	Quote, we have nothing announced in development for Wii U. It's not something we've done anything for previously.
7628989	7631690	I don't even remember the last time we've done a Nintendo title.
7631950	7632270	I do.
7632650	7633110	What was it?
7633590	7635411	It was Brunswick Bowling.
7636111	7637031	I'm serious.
7637051	7637851	That's what it was.
7638272	7639232	We don't have anything.
7639252	7643313	And that was just everybody trying to run off of the popularity of Wii Sports, of which bowling was huge.
7643353	7643733	It was.
7644554	7648155	We don't have anything now whether or not we would in the future is to be determined.
7648415	7651276	As for why, I guess I'd rather not go into that.
7653090	7657197	Oh, well, shit, now we all have to sit here and make it up, because he won't go into it.
7657858	7662966	So, what it is just that the Wii U is a... They don't believe in it?
7663286	7666171	They don't think something like Skyrim is capable of running on Wii U?
7666884	7670888	I think it's just, once again, it's cost-risk type thing.
7671309	7683821	The cost it's going to take to develop a game or port a game over to that platform versus the amount of money you're going to make with the limited marketplace for it right now because there's just not a lot of people that bought the console.
7684121	7685283	I think it's going to change.
7685303	7689226	You're going to hear a lot of people more willing to develop for it when there's more people that bought the console.
7689987	7708338	So it's going to take another year or so with some of these first party games to kind of drive some console sales to get more third parties involved, but if it doesn't work, if the third parties, or I should say the first party games don't drive enough console sales, then yeah, you're going to hear a lot more of this.
7708699	7715543	I don't think it's a huge loss because, I mean, what, there hasn't really been a Bethesda game, like I said, since Brunswick Bowling, so it's not like
7717728	7718688	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7736434	7741538	Yes, I do, and I found it on Game Politics, which I love Game Politics.
7742539	7749164	If you want to see what goes on in the world around video games, it doesn't necessarily have to do with release dates, then that's the place to go.
7750064	7761193	But there was a conservative political website called The Daily Caller that said that a Texas teenager was making a joke while playing League of Legends.
7761993	7779381	and the joke was and I'm going to quote oh yeah I'm real messed up in the head I'm going to shoot up a school full of kids and eat their still beating hearts followed by a JK and lol well there were people who took this seriously actually a Canadian lady
7779861	7800992	Who looked up the teenager's address and noted where he lived and reported it to the police And he's been in jail ever since He actually spent his 19th birthday in jail And if he's convicted, he's going to spend up to 8 years in prison And this is basically for making a terrorist threat
7803312	7806014	It just goes to show what this is.
7806414	7807636	Basically, it's an ignorant kid.
7808016	7812420	His dad said he doesn't watch the news, he doesn't read up on any current events.
7813101	7815182	He's just a dumb kid making a threat.
7815363	7819146	I'm sorry, but if you're on the internet, how do you not hear about stuff?
7820227	7822049	Hearing about stuff that other people are talking about.
7822149	7824091	Well, even apart from that, there's people...
7824691	7829554	Who will all the time say really horrible things.
7829634	7833876	You know, trying to threaten somebody or exert their own personal dominance over somebody else.
7834777	7839520	And there's actually a petition out.
7839560	7844763	I hate change.org just because when you sign any petition there, you get a bajillion emails.
7845243	7845923	And I hate it.
7846544	7853588	But there is a petition up on change.org right now to try to get him out of jail.
7854168	7855689	Which, I don't know if it's going to work.
7855829	7862991	But the whole thing that this boils down to, and it's sort of almost an epidemic when it comes to online play.
7863251	7864411	Yeah.
7864471	7869093	And it's not just the whole terrorist threat type statements.
7869153	7872794	Because they're saying that there's kids everywhere being gotten in trouble for this.
7873174	7876195	But for the ones who go, oh, I'm going to rape you.
7876775	7881656	And I'm sure they're not meaning they're going to go out and take somebody against their will.
7882096	7883637	It's a means of exerting dominance.
7884966	7889690	You know, it's, you know, a top of the ones says, you know, I will... Just relax and let it happen.
7891131	7891752	Oh, God.
7891792	7893413	Rob, I am disgusted.
7893433	7897537	But, you know, like the whole... I'm just the G-rated version of that.
7897637	7907726	Well, but on top of that, there's also ones going, well, I'm just going to beat the shit out of you or... I mean, just with all the cyberbullying that's been in the recent... Or the tits or GTFO.
7907846	7910328	A lot of people say stupid shit on the internet.
7910428	7911389	What a shock.
7911949	7917752	But what we're looking into now is that people actually taking some of them seriously.
7918832	7924395	And I firmly believe that this kid was just being a stupid kid.
7924915	7931599	Just saying something that he thought was going to make himself sound a little more puffed up and a little bit more of a badass.
7932719	7934080	You have eight years in prison.
7934761	7940006	Yeah, I mean, I would even think by now, even if they dropped the whole thing, he's fucking learned his lesson.
7940066	7943189	Yeah, send the cops to his house to scare the shit out of him.
7943369	7946873	You know, like, that's how you learn your lesson.
7948089	7969740	If I had a way to do that with everyone who said anything that out of context could remotely be taken as threatening or any type of bragging of said threatening action, I would do it in a heartbeat just to scare people into behaving even though it shouldn't take scaring people into behaving.
7970020	7972161	They should just fucking know how to behave like a human being.
7973061	7974642	That's asking a lot from people.
7974682	7975943	That's asking a lot, I know.
7977978	8001143	and I mean and it goes without saying that when you know you put these people behind a mask of anonymity that they think that they've got fair you know fair game to say anything that they want that there's no repercussion in this case the lady knew who he was and called on him you know I actually my point with this is that I would actually even express this as a cautionary tale
8002615	8007398	Put it out there for any of these people who are going to be douches online.
8007438	8008958	Not that our listeners would ever do that.
8008998	8013341	No, because our listeners are kind, intelligent, beautiful, handsome.
8014711	8017434	non-bigoted lovely people.
8017874	8020136	And if you are bigoted, don't tell me or I'll beat you up.
8020176	8020516	I'm kidding.
8022018	8023599	No, I wouldn't beat anybody up.
8023679	8026182	I think I hear sirens heading towards your house, Jamie.
8026502	8028363	A po-po is coming for Jamie.
8028404	8028824	Whatever.
8029124	8029464	You know what?
8029525	8031266	I would just judge them really harshly.
8032567	8040855	But, you know, you should never bring up something that you know is going to be
8043521	8044001	Triggering.
8044221	8047642	I hate to use the word, but something that's going to be triggering to somebody.
8047662	8051703	There are people who lost family and friends in any number of terrorist attacks.
8051783	8055364	I know people personally who have lost family members.
8056604	8058424	It's a really awful thing.
8058504	8071927	And when you bring up something like that, when there's such a volatile environment around just that concept, then you are really asking for a pile of shit.
8072463	8086954	I mean, I think, like, games included, but, you know, just as everything moves more with more online communication, I mean, I think people just need to really be more mindful, and, like, we need to, you know, educate people of, you know, but, I mean, again, that's asking a lot.
8086994	8091898	I'm going to quote my granddaddy, and my granddaddy was a great guy from, you know, Bridgeport, Connecticut.
8091938	8094260	He was our Yankee when I grew up in the South.
8094761	8097403	He always said, put brain and gear before mouth in motion.
8098183	8101586	His other catchphrase was, don't be an instigator and an agitator.
8103226	8106549	But, I mean, those are two really good pieces of advice.
8107269	8111052	You don't want to stir up the hornet's nest.
8111532	8115816	You have to gently remove it to where you don't get stung in the process or no one else get hurt.
8115936	8116937	You know, it's the same thing.
8117497	8123322	And I think that with this kid, yeah, he doesn't deserve to be locked up, but he did deserve to have a stern talking to, at least.
8123822	8125063	To have some sort of repercussion.
8125083	8125503	Scared straight.
8125804	8126324	Exactly.
8126764	8128285	Or maybe he's scared gay, I don't know.
8128926	8129747	Whatever, whatever.
8130447	8131928	You're the one who told me to go gaily forward.
8132768	8133048	Okay.
8133928	8141470	So anyway, I think that in any of these cases, yeah, they need to drop it with Kid.
8142251	8143431	He's clearly learned his lesson.
8143811	8146752	But to everybody, just think before you speak.
8147392	8155875	And instead of reacting to something that someone has said or something that you've seen or losing a game, boo-hoo, go cry me a fucking river.
8156335	8156535	Mm-hmm.
8157765	8159025	Don't react.
8159546	8160586	Think and act.
8161626	8162367	End of story.
8162467	8170150	I apologize after our press our luck game slide kick for threatening to kill you and leave your corpse out on the porch for the crows to pick at.
8170210	8172611	Didn't you say you were going to pee on my corpse too?
8172831	8174031	Yeah, I probably did.
8174091	8177613	And I was going to hit you with a bug net repeatedly since you like Animal Crossing so much.
8179404	8193748	I hear the sirens again, they're coming back this way I'm sorry, I shouldn't joke about that I would actually still like to encourage our listeners to keep a level head Don't react, think and act
8195202	8195982	That's my new catchphrase.
8196403	8199684	You should have a little McGruff the Crime Dog saying at the end of every episode.
8199704	8204687	You should make some YouTube gaming PSAs.
8204887	8207428	Like Jamie's Gaming Stern Advice.
8207648	8208909	I almost said gameys.
8208949	8211890	Like Wanda Sykes' Knock It Off.
8212151	8215952	And then you know what's going to happen is I'm going to get a ton of people commenting on YouTube.
8217722	8220925	Show Me Your Boobs, Get Back in the Kitchen, Rape, blah, blah, blah.
8220985	8226249	And so I'm going to have to just single out each and every one of them, trace their IPs, and send them a letter.
8226289	8229912	Backtrace them through the internet, through the cyber.
8230012	8231613	Or just disable comments.
8231693	8232294	That's what I do.
8232974	8237918	But I've actually done that before where I got one of those stupid, you know, so-and-so rape.
8238179	8240380	But it came through a source that I was able to track back as IP.
8240540	8241761	It was on a forum.
8242002	8243363	I think it was a DDR Freak back in the day.
8243823	8247306	I love all those people who say, oh, well, I just found your Facebook.
8247326	8250028	I'm posting it back where your mom can see it.
8250048	8252730	Yeah, but then some trolls make it really successfully and it makes me very bitter.
8252750	8253611	I'm having a drink as I say that.
8269258	8273920	In some cases, it's when you remove that mask of anonymity that they really straighten up.
8274020	8274540	You know what I mean?
8275041	8278682	Degenerate Johnny in chat says, go to shitsenders.com and send them a cow pie.
8278942	8279743	That's a real thing?
8280043	8280563	Yes, it is.
8280683	8281764	Oh my god, that's great.
8281784	8283825	Captain Spike, if you're listening, happy birthday.
8285166	8286587	Actually, you know what I want to do?
8287507	8291809	And I don't know if something like this exists, because you know how there's like the National Sex Offender Registry?
8292369	8293970	I want to do the Internet Offender Registry.
8294130	8297011	National Gaming Douchebag Registry?
8297151	8301413	Yeah, well, if you can do... Slander, slander, lawsuit, slander.
8301933	8309437	If you can do soandsoparkslikeanasshole.com, then you can do shitpeoplesaidontheinternet.com.
8311246	8312707	You know, I'm just saying.
8313187	8315668	Captain Spike is in chat, by the way, and says, rude.
8317928	8318249	All right.
8319169	8319809	Moving on.
8320249	8321890	I'm sure we have lots of other thoughts on this.
8322270	8326111	I invite you guys to email us, mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com.
8326452	8329993	Although we are definitely going to change that email address in the coming weeks.
8330153	8331733	But for now, you can still use that.
8331753	8333474	There'll be plenty of announcement when we flip it over.
8333954	8335675	Mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com.
8336455	8338937	Meanwhile... Everyone's doing emails these days.
8339397	8339897	I love it.
8340317	8340557	What?
8340938	8346120	Well, Queen City has a national douche burr registry, and Fifth Dream says dbagshaming.com.
8347321	8348402	I am all for that.
8348482	8349042	I would do it.
8350023	8350363	All right.
8351123	8356866	We have to run it through Sweden so that we don't get... Loki, we need something a little less serious here.
8357847	8358247	All right.
8360668	8361269	Let's see here.
8361329	8361489	So...
8363226	8365288	Molly Jam, Part 2.
8366970	8368011	This one's going to be a little different.
8368071	8380843	Instead of basing it off of the fake Peter Molyneux Twitter account and those kind of ideas, these are based off of actual quotes from Peter Molyneux.
8381984	8383646	And it's weird.
8384967	8385988	It's really weird.
8386088	8388190	Can you read the one that was included in that article?
8388948	8389809	Yes, I can do that.
8389849	8392032	In fact, here is some of the stuff.
8392052	8393715	And I think a lot of this is going to be very dirty.
8393955	8395077	It's you Americans.
8395197	8397520	There's something about nipples you hate.
8397981	8401766	If this were Germany, we'd be romping around naked on stage here.
8403208	8404109	So that could become a game.
8404395	8404895	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8426451	8427332	Neckbreaker!
8427752	8428873	I like it.
8429253	8429834	Let's see here.
8429954	8434457	We're explorers who have just discovered this new continent of emotion.
8434557	8435458	I'd actually play that.
8435478	8438800	It would probably be very cool.
8438841	8442844	I wish I had some time machine and could go back two weeks.
8443184	8444985	You live by your mistakes for sure.
8446306	8450770	When you rip your fingers on the screen, you tear the landscape apart with your physical hands.
8451170	8452671	It just feels amazing, man.
8453071	8454312	It feels amazing.
8455453	8456233	Let's see here.
8459675	8462016	They have 48 hours to make a game out of these quotes.
8462036	8464017	Yeah, there's like 22 quotes here.
8464037	8466559	The one about ripping the screen would have to be an iOS title.
8466899	8469300	I remember hearing about this last year.
8469720	8473782	You can eliminate starvation or you can double it.
8474262	8478004	You can empty the treasury or you can fill it with gold and rub it all over your body.
8479785	8480826	That game sounds hot.
8481346	8482867	Yeah, another Atari adult game.
8484607	8513307	will the first female nudity give you a success or will it turn off an audience what is that gonna be I gotta see that I'm not punishing you for button mashing I'm rewarding you for not button mashing and that's a really big distinction that could be a rhythm game alright anyhow show me the games when you're doing it in multiplayer it feels incredible I love that so the theme is gonna be adult games then
8513587	8514748	Good times.
8515429	8521014	All right, well, maybe some of these games that come out of Moley Jam could be pitched to Dave & Buster's Arcade Chain.
8521194	8521734	Oh, God.
8521815	8524237	You know, Dave & Buster's, of course, it's Chuck G's results.
8524257	8528641	It used to be the annual site of my birthday every year where I would play Chuck.
8529261	8530422	It stopped for some reason.
8530643	8533125	Yeah, because they got rid of Battletech.
8534186	8542971	Well, anyhow, Dave and Busters, along with Comedy Central, VH1, and MTV, that whole network thing, is putting on this contest called the Next Big Game Search.
8543171	8545632	And you can see this at nextgame.cc.com.

8580424	8581885	You have to be a resident of the U.S.
8582365	8583306	I'm telling you what, though.
8583326	8592570	If you go and submit an OLR Dream Game and you win this competition, patent pending, and you owe us a chunk of your winnings.
8592630	8593110	Just saying.
8593650	8596032	You're going to buy us a hell of a nice meal at Dave & Buster's.
8596072	8596752	That's all I'm saying.
8596932	8598653	You can record live from Dave & Buster's.
8599662	8600682	Yes, that's right.
8601082	8603263	We should go submit some of our favorite dream game ideas.
8603283	8603963	Just do them all.
8604343	8605083	Just do them all.
8606884	8607504	This will be fun.
8608944	8614666	Can you imagine if the winning game out of this was WhatTheyPlay.com, Snap, or Puzzle Sluts?
8614726	8615926	No, it has to be for all ages.
8618166	8621047	I don't think that the Roseville Dave & Buster's has the DDR anymore.
8621527	8621967	That's sad.
8622787	8624548	Answering Misty in chat room because she asked.
8625048	8627989	Besides that, the Roseville Dave & Buster's is the size of a closet.
8628329	8629029	No one goes there anyway.
8629329	8633250	Yeah, when you have a Dave & Buster's that's smaller than Times Square Dave & Buster's, it's a problem.
8633851	8635631	Alright, let's go to the mailbag.
8635751	8643614	Every week you guys email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we sift through the emails that are mixed in with all the Asian spam that we get.
8644934	8646835	and... We have a lot of Asian spam this time.
8646855	8648416	Oh my god, and Russian spam.
8648716	8649496	And French spam.
8649916	8653958	It's like, just when we thought the French spam and Russian spam was done with, now it's... Zoot le porn!
8654278	8655558	Alright, moving on.
8655819	8658820	Mailbag at orangeauntradio.com, DarkSakura, dive in the mailbag, pull out some emails.
8659100	8661161	Okay, um... Hello, guys.
8661601	8661941	Hello.
8663182	8665903	OLR, the video game podcast where every gamer has a voice, right?
8665943	8668184	Well, I'm gonna offer up mine to say, girl, please.
8669104	8671105	Ocarina of Time is not an overrated game.
8671405	8674166	It is as deserving of praise just as much as Link to the Past is.
8674486	8675388	Next email.
8675629	8676370	Hey, Rob.
8677352	8677713	Fine.
8678535	8682082	To quote a video game, sit your ass down in that chair and drink your goddamn tea.
8685236	8686177	Hearts, hearts, hearts, hearts.
8686937	8688037	It is, okay, blah, blah, blah.
8688077	8692920	Okay, the major thing that determines which you have an affinity for is the one you grew up playing first.
8693440	8698303	Mine obviously was Ocarina, but I also grew up playing A Link to the Past on Game Boy Advance.
8699283	8706227	I have many fond memories of playing through that game, just as I do with Ocarina of Time, but Ocarina moved me on a deeper level and made me into the gamer I am today.
8706647	8710329	For the record, I actually really like both of them about equally.
8710469	8711590	It depends on the mood I'm in.
8712631	8713932	Yeah, I really like them both.
8714612	8716213	I really like Majora's Mask too.
8716293	8721856	It's like, I really love lasagna, but I also really, really like sushi.
8722396	8726118	I really like Link to the Past, and that's the end of that sentence.
8726519	8730761	This brings me to two questions about your opinions on Ocarina of Time specifically for Rob.
8733483	8736224	1.
8734023	8736224	You mentioned that you really like Twilight Princess.
8736385	8737245	Hell, I did too.
8737866	8747852	I caused a flood warning for all of Northeast Ohio with how much I came buckets over Link turning into a wolf.
8748272	8749153	Came buckets?
8749713	8752615	I thought I was thinking cried, but it's came buckets.
8752735	8753436	Sexy chat.
8753576	8753916	Sticky.
8755117	8759180	But why are you so fond of a game that took a lot of cues from Ocarina of Time?
8759220	8760080	Yeah, Rob, why?
8760140	8760741	Yeah, Rob, why?
8761721	8763663	Because, next question.
8764444	8769607	No, especially with all the waggle technology being new and it was something that was a little bit outside of Wii Sports.
8770028	8775912	And I think also kind of getting to see the game with more, like, you know, in Ocarina of Time, the 3D was still so early on.
8775932	8780035	You had a lot of very blocky textures and very solid colors and, you know, things.
8780135	8785379	And I realized at the time there were a lot of people that were very imaginative and it didn't matter.
8785439	8787621	But you have to remember, there were a lot of us
8788061	8790142	and my generation that grew up on the 2D games.
8790182	8792664	Like you say that, you know, Ocarina of Time was from your generation.
8793144	8795925	We were a little more stubborn when it came to getting into the 3D.
8796206	8798447	Like I was cool with Mario Kart.
8799367	8800788	I like Mario 64.
8801088	8803490	I don't think it deserves all the praise that it gets.
8805031	8806191	Are you an N64 hater?
8806711	8807892	I'm not an N64 hater.
8807912	8811034	So you're saying you didn't pee your pants when Star Fox came out?
8812082	8813263	Ocarina of Time Ocarina of Time
8833809	8850564	Alright Number two, a while back I remember you mentioning that you're not a big fan of Metroid Prime You didn't like the direction Nintendo took the series and that it just didn't have the same feeling of the older games like Super Metroid Do you think that this has to do with why you didn't like Ocarina of Time and the fact that both games were a shift to 3D?
8850804	8860773	Yes, but I like Metroid Prime 3 for the record Did you just not like that change and wish the game stayed as top-down Zelda or side-scrolling Metroid games?
8862364	8868726	Yes and no, because I still stand pretty hard for Zelda 2, which even Miyamoto himself has issues with.
8869247	8870087	I don't like Zelda 2.
8870267	8874128	And that shifted back and forth, but I'll defend that game as pretty fucking awesome.
8874449	8876249	Dan will agree with you, just saying.
8877110	8882231	It's hard as hell, but beating that game when I was a kid, I'm not going to be able to do that again.
8882411	8882952	I've tried.
8883852	8884412	That's tough.
8885092	8886293	What do you think about Wind Waker?
8888027	8889748	I honestly didn't play enough of it.
8891748	8893309	I didn't play enough of it.
8893349	8895150	Dan beat Wind Waker and he really liked it.
8895390	8896730	I just couldn't get into it.
8896970	8900912	If I can borrow the HD one or get it on Gamefly or something, I'll give it another try.
8901012	8902612	Well, Rob, I can lend you mine.
8903352	8906634	Well, you know, there's the HD remake coming out on the Wii U. I'd like to try it.
8908454	8909555	Oh, you and your HD.
8910055	8910415	Why not?
8911331	8918131	Thanks for reading and sorry for the slightly longer email, but I just got to defend my first and favorite gaming love that is Ocarina of Time, and that's from Osfer.
8920101	8926226	And I don't need to know about you, Coming Bucket.
8926246	8926846	There's a PS.
8926946	8927707	Oh, that was Osfer?
8928047	8928247	Yeah.
8928448	8929929	I'm not surprised about the Coming Buckets.
8930269	8933332	Yeah, because Twilight Princess has, like, never mind.
8933352	8937235	I actually just finished a playthrough of Ocarina of Time last night with one of my close friends.
8937615	8942599	We took turns playing through the dungeons and reminiscing on how we grew up while playing it as kids.
8942900	8945021	After the end credits, we were both pretty teary-eyed.
8945041	8946363	You know, she played again.
8947043	8947444	You know what?
8947624	8954470	I actually, not too long ago, played through Ocarina on the GameCube Redo disc.
8954510	8956713	You need to get the 3DS version.
8956753	8957373	It's really good.
8957393	8961657	I still wanted $40 for it, and they're charging a premium for it because it's out of print now.
8962458	8962558	Oh.
8963959	8966361	By the way, I just want to make sure this is very clear.
8966642	8968063	I don't hate Ocarina of Time.
8968423	8972006	I never have, and I've never said that word on the show in regards to Ocarina of Time.
8972526	8976609	I just don't lavish all the praise upon it that many other people do.
8977090	8977990	I think it's a good game.
8978030	8979211	In fact, I think it's a great game.
8979331	8981853	I just don't think it's in my top 20.
8982054	8984756	Rob, you like it, you just don't like like it.
8984896	8985436	Exactly.
8986037	8986597	You wouldn't date it.
8986697	8987738	I wouldn't eat at S.H.I.E.L.D.
8988379	8990060	You'd go to Pinkberry with it, but you wouldn't date it.
8990080	8990260	Get it?
8990300	8991441	Because I don't like like it?
8993223	8997104	That was a Zelda joke, people!
8997345	8997745	I try.
9000546	9001226	Last email.
9002947	9004528	This is from Sam.
9004928	9005348	Hi, Sam.
9005949	9006829	Hello, OLR crew.
9006949	9007690	I love the show.
9008150	9013753	If the devs stop making single player games, are we really any better off than we were before Microsoft's change in plans?
9013813	9014453	What do you all think?
9014833	9016474	First of all, I don't think single player games are going away.
9016634	9017995	No, single player games won't go away.
9018055	9019976	There will always be a demand for single player games.
9019996	9021677	There are always antisocial people.
9021937	9028941	However, I can see where this guy, unless Sam is for Samantha, it could be guy or girl, but I'm going to assume guy.
9030262	9031222	Way to assume, Rob.
9031262	9032503	Where this individual...
9034584	9035385	Our lovely writer.
9036266	9036546	Yes.
9037087	9042933	Where this individual is getting this from, because it does seem like a lot of single player games that have come out lately have a multiplayer mode suddenly in it.
9042993	9043213	What?
9043453	9044835	Just within the past few months.
9045055	9045456	Tomb Raider.
9045476	9049580	Tomb Raider, Uncharted 3, Last of Us, Mass Effect 3.
9050561	9052583	All the Assassin's Creed ones, even though it's a little bit older.
9052803	9053524	Assassin's Creed 3.
9053784	9055386	They all have multiplayer modes in them.
9055746	9064774	Now, I don't think in any of these cases they've necessarily detracted from the single-player game, although some people kind of resented that you kind of had to play multiplayer to get the edge in Mass Effect 3.
9064834	9065835	That's true.
9065855	9068257	But Mass Effect 3 multiplayer is great.
9068537	9069378	Yeah, that's the thing.
9069698	9070058	That's the thing.
9070118	9070579	It's great.
9071019	9074983	You know, it also gives the games more replay value, I guess you could say.
9075143	9080047	I still have yet to... Although, for Mass Effect fans, replay value is going and making another Shepard, let's be real.
9080802	9081422	You know what?
9082182	9083403	Okay, and this is the funny thing.
9084723	9088224	I'm now on my third playthrough of the first game because I'm braving the motion sickness.
9088404	9091525	I've beaten two and three 27 bajillion times.
9092045	9098666	The fun for that for me is making a new Shepard and completely hacking everything I can possibly hack about the appearance.
9100287	9106548	I have one wearing Ashley's face like it's ripped off of her flesh as she died on Vermeier.
9107628	9108049	Wow.
9108769	9109929	And wearing Warren's outfit.
9112478	9113960	She's been referred to as Hobag Ashley.
9114500	9120106	So in my discussion there, the original question was Xbox One something.
9121147	9122148	Oh, you closed the email, huh?
9122308	9122689	I did.
9122709	9127574	Do you think that single players are going away?
9127614	9132739	I don't think it was necessarily going away, but I think it has something to do with as they fade more and more.
9132920	9134401	Is Microsoft's decision a bad one?
9134922	9135102	Um...
9137000	9144531	Well, I still think if Microsoft wanted to do... Here's the thing.
9145760	9155022	If Microsoft wanted to try and push digital, then there's no reason they can't run two separate license systems, your disk-based license and your digital-based license.
9155442	9157902	Why not enhance the digital license?
9158542	9167304	You know, Nintendo dipped their little pinky in the water when they said, well, if you buy the game digitally, you'll get 5%, what is it, 10% back in points, which you can trade in for cards, right?
9167604	9171805	A little bit of a tiny-ass incentive, but it's some incentive to get the game online.
9172145	9174386	What if Microsoft said, okay, we're going to one-up that.
9174706	9183091	So when you digitally buy the game, here's the perk you get over getting it on disc, is that you can now share this digital game with a friend.
9183111	9185572	You can loan it out to a friend across the country instantly.
9185893	9187914	That's the perk you get with it.
9187954	9190015	Like, why can't they run both licenses?
9190415	9191456	They can do it.
9191956	9193897	It will take time to develop and so on.
9194497	9197519	I think if Microsoft really wants to, for the Xbox...
9198259	9204864	S2 or whatever their next generation system is called after this, assuming this box doesn't kill the company, but I don't think it will.
9207286	9216894	They could start getting people used to the idea of digital and why it's better as opposed to, nope, we're going to change the whole fucking thing.
9217765	9220387	Right now, we're turning your world upside down.
9220787	9229753	Yeah, even though I don't approve of a lot of what the Xbox One was trying to do, I do think it's a shame that we didn't see how it could have developed.
9229793	9232835	The positive was never clearly communicated, only the negative.
9233196	9234636	Yeah, lesson learned, hopefully.
9236718	9238179	Anyhow, that was it for Mailbag, right?
9239519	9242565	That means we get to the FUs of the week.
9242705	9245571	Every week here on this show we let out a little angst.
9245711	9246072	Why?
9246172	9248536	Because we're just really angry people.
9264761	9269142	You know, I hate bringing up traffic, but this was really fucking stupid.
9271772	9288163	When I was driving over that same bridge over across the American River coming this way to your place, Rob, someone was freaking tailgating me while all that road construction was with a cop expecting me to speed.
9289024	9290645	And I'm like, no.
9290725	9299170	And I know everybody and their twin goes 20 miles over the speed limit over that bridge, but I wasn't about to do it while there was a CHP parked off to the side.
9300231	9305056	Sorry, your convenience isn't worth me having a $300 ticket.
9305777	9306037	Loki?
9307038	9308660	Fuck you to hand, foot, and mouth disease.
9309080	9310822	I don't like having blisters on my hands and feet.
9312003	9312484	Or my mouth.
9313665	9314145	Slide kick?
9314165	9314726	Why don't you go next?
9315465	9323947	I want to say F you to the lady in the Target parking lot who gave me a very pressed look when I was trying to leave.
9324687	9332249	I'm sorry that I delayed you like 10 seconds getting to your car so you could go home and eat your Panda Express.
9332769	9334169	I'm sure it just ruined your day.
9334509	9337250	That orange chicken just fucking... She glared at me.
9337330	9338530	She's like, fine, go.
9338590	9340771	The orange chicken would not stay warm in this weather.
9343024	9345666	Oh, by the way, I'd like to add a thank you to you.
9346607	9346767	Aww.
9346907	9349349	Thank you so much for facilitating the crack.
9349990	9352852	And thank you for the Groupon for brunch.
9352932	9353713	Hey, hey, hey.
9354313	9357215	No rainbow and sunshine shit in the FU segment.
9357235	9358176	You better watch it.
9358396	9359017	FU, Rob.
9359257	9360198	Yeah, FU, Rob.
9360218	9361099	Just kidding, I love you.
9361319	9361779	I-L-U.
9362059	9362680	F-U both.
9362720	9363501	Here's my finger.
9363961	9365662	You should do an I-L-U section.
9366603	9369245	You want to do an I-L-U's of the week?
9369285	9370766	Wait, hold on, because I've got to get my F-U out.
9371647	9375629	Fuck you to this goddamn shitty fucking hateful heat.
9376049	9376670	Amen!
9377070	9378451	TimTRP in chat agrees.
9379371	9380072	It is hateful.
9380332	9381572	That's a good word for a robot.
9381612	9382193	It's very hateful.
9382233	9384274	I'm sliding on the chair.
9384434	9387716	Okay, it's time for the ILUs of the week.
9389477	9391057	Yes, I'm using the same music bumper twice.
9391538	9393299	It's the ILUs of the week.
9393439	9394599	I love you, KBB.
9396460	9397401	Dark Sakura.
9398280	9400801	Thank you for the 3DS!
9400841	9403162	Slack kick, you are my hero forever.
9405163	9408424	And I have Animal Crossing now, thank you, because you facilitated it.
9409125	9410745	And I'm glad you enjoyed your sausage.
9412326	9414227	Oh, I always enjoy my sausage.
9414927	9422670	And I have to say ILU to DarkSakura for the Groupon, for brunch, and for sharing her French toast with me.
9422690	9423431	It was so good.
9426026	9442713	Sam's should be a sponsor and I'm going to give my ILU of the week to Alan because he's over there in the kitchen clearly making dinner you can't hear the foil in the background you've got an ILU right?
9443074	9452137	you know the quickest way to a man's heart is through his stomach no, it's through the rib cage Loki, what's your ILU of the week?
9452157	9453218	I don't have one, sorry
9454238	9454578	What?
9454758	9455858	You grumpy cat.
9455879	9458799	I love the fact that it's really sweltering hot in here.
9458879	9460660	It's great.
9460680	9461380	There's nothing I can do.
9461500	9463041	You don't have ILU to breadsticks?
9463441	9465481	ILU to these five fans.
9465781	9468122	One, two, three, four.
9469042	9469703	I made one up.
9469723	9470183	Five.
9470323	9472363	And all your fans in the chat room.
9474004	9474204	Aww.
9474624	9474904	Alright.
9474984	9475364	Oops.
9475384	9475664	Sorry.
9476565	9478025	That was not meant to be followed by holic.
9479091	9480791	Everything is meant to be followed by Holic.
9482892	9483972	Alright, moving on.
9484312	9489374	Loki, if you could possibly do the next story.
9489594	9489854	Sure.
9490434	9499016	Okay, so unfortunately there was a little bit of an issue with the precursor games.
9499797	9508019	Apparently, writer, game designer, and artist Ken McColl, he was arrested for possession of child pornography.
9510447	9513290	That's not good.
9513430	9514791	No, that's definitely not good.
9514951	9525962	Of course, the company is now distancing themselves from their co-founder, and he doesn't have anything to do now, obviously, with Shadows of the Eternals.
9528144	9532408	Every time I hear Shadow of the Eternal, now I hear this as the theme song.
9534722	9541128	Yeah, as if Precursor needed any more bad press, honestly.
9542109	9542449	Right?
9544431	9545612	Yeah, that sucks.
9547293	9548815	Oh well, what are you going to do?
9550509	9551430	That's all you can do.
9551450	9554313	Well, for one, don't download child pornography.
9554373	9555274	That's not good.
9555455	9556396	That's gross.
9557156	9558137	It's beyond gross.
9558178	9558778	You're nasty.
9559179	9566186	By the way, Rob, did you hear about the 12-year-old girl who shamed a guy in her room drinking off over her?
9566547	9566587	Ew!
9567928	9568269	What?
9568809	9571332	Yeah, it was kind of unpleasant.
9571412	9574576	It was on the, I read it on like some news thing.
9575236	9580162	It was like a legit news thing where this 12 year old girl says, you need to be ashamed of yourself, leave.
9580943	9581363	And he did.
9582424	9584206	The internet's disgusting.
9585067	9586269	Disgusting place.
9586289	9588171	Well, no, this was a real life thing, but.
9588823	9590586	DarkSakura.com
9600925	9608951	Alright, moving on to a campaign about something that really pisses people off about the Wii U, and that is region locking.
9609411	9622020	You know, I guess some of the fans out there are hoping, you know, if Operation Rainfall worked, and Microsoft ended up reversing course on a lot of their shit, maybe, just maybe, we can get Nintendo to end region locking.
9622040	9625262	And they're taking to Twitter, you know, because Twitter is a very effective way of protesting.
9625702	9628384	It worked for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
9628604	9656609	and region locking and Nintendo region free are some hashtags there's let's see some posts on Miiverse as well which are actually kind of funny like I love some of these Miiverse posts I love the one of Monita with region free please that's great and then like a picture of Reggie Fils-Aimé or I guess that's supposed to be him my body is region free so it's kind of clever that they're taking to Miiverse to put some of their opinions it won't happen no it probably won't happen
9657502	9665745	The thing is that Nintendo seems to be trying to bring over a lot of stuff that maybe in the past they wouldn't have.
9666165	9674868	Fire Emblem is a thing that we can basically expect at this point, but also Bravely Default, that was kind of uncertain, but Nintendo is helping bring that over.
9676168	9685351	Even though it would be nice if the Wii U was region-free, I think that Nintendo is really trying to listen to gamers and know that they want these games that are...
9686718	9690579	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9716488	9719155	SimCity has a wonderful new piece of DLC for $9.
9719335	9719816	It's Zeppelins.
9722389	9726752	You get an airship and a hot air balloon park.
9728393	9729814	Is it piloted by a guy named Sid?
9729834	9730495	I don't know.
9730775	9735178	Hot air balloon park and an airship mass transit option.
9735939	9735178	$9.
9735959	9736939	That's all you get for $9.
9737560	9739521	Will it explode like the Hindenburg did?
9739781	9741823	I mean, not to be in poor taste.
9741843	9743204	Too soon, Rob.
9743224	9743664	Too soon.
9743704	9745245	Thanks to the power of cloud processing.
9745265	9747267	Part of SimCity is disasters, right?
9748027	9749768	Yeah, SimCity was a disaster.
9749929	9750449	Yeah.
9752253	9752613	Oh boy.
9752633	9754474	It wouldn't be the same without the reporter.
9754714	9757035	All right, let's go to the phones because we do have calls coming in.
9757055	9757915	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
9757935	9758315	Who's this?
9759036	9759976	Hello.
9760336	9760636	Hello.
9760656	9761377	It's Codeman.
9761457	9762097	Hey, Codeman.
9762117	9762817	How you doing?
9763337	9764498	I haven't called in in a while.
9764518	9766018	I was going to say, long time no talk.
9766058	9766959	What's on your mind, buddy?
9767239	9770020	Well, you know, it's busy everywhere.
9770660	9773061	Real life is not allowed to get in the way of OLR.
9773081	9773901	Okay, thanks.
9774342	9775042	It never does.
9775282	9775742	Hardly.
9776002	9776562	Good answer.
9776862	9777583	What's on your mind, buddy?
9779143	9786547	No, I was just calling about the whole YouTube thing earlier because I'm your friendly neighborhood YouTuber, I guess.
9786567	9787487	Yes, you are.
9787987	9794090	But they're actually starting to monetize for minutes watched now.
9794450	9802014	So it's not so much your video anymore as it is the minutes of how long somebody watches your video.
9803878	9831489	so I mean it's really I don't know they keep changing it but to say something about I believe Square Enix or Squeenix as a lot of people say is they did that for a really long time they wouldn't let anyone put any of their games up which I always see it as free advertisement for the company but I mean you're playing their game people are watching it they say oh you know this is a really good game I want to buy it so then they go out and buy it and then
9831969	9833050	That's free advertisement.
9833070	9834752	So to me, that's the way.
9834792	9847205	But I see where everybody's coming from, where you're playing this game, you're claiming it as your own video, but it's actually just your voice over something else that somebody else made.
9847285	9848707	And I can understand that, but...
9851293	9854837	I just wanted to call in because I missed that whole conversation.
9854877	9859203	I had to go put the girl down to sleep.
9859243	9862227	I just wanted to call in and talk about that a little bit.
9862487	9863008	No worries.
9863448	9867353	You probably aren't surprised to hear that people make a living off those Let's Play videos though, right?
9868734	9882145	Um, there's a lot of people out there, a lot of really, really big YouTubers that make a huge, huge killing off of just doing Let's Plays and doing... Minecraft's real big right now.
9882665	9885867	There's just tons of people out there making so much money off of that.
9886608	9893733	And, yeah, to an extent, you make a lot of money, but I don't really think, unless you partner with a third party...
9894474	9897776	I don't really think, which sometimes you kind of get screwed out of that money too.
9897896	9905681	So, you know, either way, if you manage yourself correctly on YouTube, I think you can make a good amount of money.
9905761	9913206	But other than that, I do it just to do it and, you know, to show people what I'm playing and, you know, all that stuff.
9913246	9915908	I mean, I don't do it for the money, obviously, because I'm not making anything from it.
9915988	9919030	But it's just fun to do to me.
9919270	9921071	And I love video editing and all that stuff.
9921091	9921291	Yeah.
9921536	9926451	that's what's got it's like podcasting I've said this before on an earlier show if you don't love it what the hell are you doing
9927059	9927619	Well, exactly.
9927639	9932323	If you get into YouTube to make money, you're getting into the wrong reasons.
9932824	9936527	It's like those companies that are like, we need to hire an agency to make a viral video.
9937647	9939189	You don't force something to go viral.
9939209	9940650	That has to happen.
9940730	9941130	Well, no.
9941250	9942631	Yeah, that's totally true.
9943933	9944293	That's great.
9944373	9951679	Oh, and I also wanted to say, you will have a buffer from a one-year-old... Well, actually, from a...
9952179	9959963	Well, she'll be two probably by the time that I make the buffer, but I got her to say orange today, but she has to put all of them together.
9960023	9962064	I haven't got... Adorable!
9962644	9965826	Yeah, so that should be fantastic.
9966266	9967027	Excited to hear it.
9968227	9968527	All right.
9969368	9971349	Yeah, I think that's about it, really.
9972250	9977593	So, I mean, yeah, I was up late tonight, so I thought I'd give you guys a call because I haven't talked to you in a while.
9977613	9978734	I'm glad you did.
9979034	9980175	Yeah, always good to hear from you.
9981436	9982196	It's good to hear from you.
9982237	9985599	You take care, and I hope everybody's doing well out there in Oklahoma.
9985639	9989621	I'm glad to see you've been okay throughout all the – I mean, here I am bitching about the heat.
9989641	9990762	Rob, that was a bad pun.
9990842	9991943	At least I don't have – what?
9992083	9993184	I didn't even – Please, okay.
9993204	9993444	Okay.
9993584	9994265	God, shut up.
9994745	9999948	At least I don't have these tornadoes running through my backyard, so I'm glad to hear you're alright with all that.
10000449	10001930	We're getting the heat right now, too.
10002790	10012517	I think today we got probably a high of 101, which is not a whole... I mean, it's not big here, but I mean, we're not getting tornadoes, and that's all that we care about.
10012657	10018401	Although I am getting a shelter put in in September, I think, so... Phew, that's good.
10018861	10022384	Alright, buddy, I'm gonna let you go so we can get more calls, but stay safe.
10023340	10027101	All right, you guys, keep making the podcast for another 16 years.
10027301	10027742	How about that?
10027822	10028322	We'll try.
10028782	10029362	All right.
10029622	10030423	All right, we'll see you.
10030523	10030963	All right, bye.
10031523	10032683	Bye.
10032843	10034324	In 16 years, I will be 50.
10034584	10037085	I don't know about that.
10037145	10037665	All right, we'll see.
10037725	10039286	All right, let's go to some more calls.
10039726	10040686	Phone's ringing tonight.
10040726	10041647	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
10041667	10042007	Who's this?
10043307	10044127	This is Zorme.
10044528	10045168	Zorme.
10045248	10045788	Hey, Zorme.
10046008	10047549	I don't think... Have you called the show before?
10047689	10048329	I don't recognize your name.
10049471	10051693	I call him a few times back in the day.
10052033	10052854	Oh, back in the day.
10052914	10053675	Well, welcome back.
10053735	10054435	What's on your mind, buddy?
10056777	10062322	I know you guys are average gamers of Final Fantasy XI, and now that Final Fantasy XIV has come out...
10063348	10064389	It looks like it's going to be pretty good.
10064429	10065129	I've been playing it.
10065249	10066130	Have you guys?
10066891	10067491	Absolutely.
10067531	10068852	You might have missed the beginning of the show.
10068892	10070273	I was talking a bit about it.
10070833	10071214	That's all right.
10071574	10074916	We actually, all of us, except Slidekick, you haven't been able to play it, right?
10075236	10077738	No, not lately, but I did play in like an earlier phase.
10077958	10078198	Okay.
10078579	10079579	Yeah, we've all been playing it.
10080080	10081401	I especially have been playing it.
10081841	10082581	I really love it.
10083022	10091968	I have two classes at 16 on my character that's going to get deleted in a week anyway, but I'm having a lot of fun just exploring this gorgeous game that's very fanservice-y.
10093238	10097674	No, you said that they're going to delete your character.
10097755	10098678	I don't think that's official.
10100703	10108165	It's out there that right now we're in what's called Beta Phase 3, and they have said that they're going to wipe the characters at the end of Beta Phase 3.
10108785	10110686	We just don't know when the end is.
10111066	10121468	But before the official release of the game, there is another character wipe slotted because there's going to be Beta Phase 4, which is open beta, where everybody's going to get to play.
10121688	10124589	And they did say about Beta Phase 4 that they're going to try...
10125629	10154300	and let those characters carry into the live game but they did clearly say so that people don't bitch about it if it happens another character wipe at the end of all the betas still may have to occur so we may still be looking at two character wipes so don't get too attached to your character but that's I mean considering they haven't even opened up Arcanist as a job yet and I mean you have to I think have a 1.0 character or something I mean considering we don't have all of that in there yet I'm okay with them I mean it is a beta it is a beta not a demo
10155583	10157205	Well, yeah, that's the whole thing.
10157225	10165494	I think I've been enjoying playing different characters and it's been quite fun because there's just so many different customizations.
10166455	10169479	And that whole, what do you think about the free company?
10169699	10171401	That's what I want because a lot of people...
10172270	10175613	See that you have link shells as well, but there's no need for them because you have free company.
10175673	10178976	Yeah, I haven't been able to test that yet because I don't even really understand it.
10179676	10185822	You have the link shells or the little sub guilds, but then the free company is like your huge chat channel, right?
10185862	10188704	It's like you have big guilds and little guilds as a part of that, right?
10189585	10189845	Right.
10189985	10195050	It's basically like you're able to go ahead and
10196658	10208484	Make a group of people a little bit more organized where you can have like cadets and I'm not too sure, but like people who are in your officers, you have like cadets and you have like commanders, some sort of thing like that.
10208524	10211646	And they can basically distribute money and kill and.
10212677	10216739	based off of like their prestige inside the link shell, I mean inside the free company.
10217319	10223243	I don't know exactly on too much detail about it, but it's more than just a glorified link shell though.
10223463	10230707	My understanding, especially coming from World of Warcraft, which I've played for a long time and I'm still continuing to play even throughout Final Fantasy XIV,
10231647	10235610	You had a lot of big guilds in World of Warcraft that had several raiding groups in it.
10235670	10244517	In fact, my own guild for a time that I was raiding with had, infamously to an extent, two raiding groups in it, Raid Group 1 and Raid Group 2, and that actually is what kind of drove that guild apart.
10244937	10254344	But I would think that maybe with a free company set up, you would still have that, but then each raid team would have its own little link shell in it for raid nights and stuff like that.
10255645	10257146	It's interesting, though, the way they're doing that.
10258240	10265383	Yeah, I do think it's going to be great for organization, because I don't know how... Well, I do know, actually.
10265443	10271165	You played Final Fantasy XI, but you didn't play it to the extent where you were in an endgame.
10271325	10272886	No, I never got that far.
10272926	10275407	I played for years and never got a character past 56.
10275527	10277768	I think it was the highest I ever got.
10277788	10278408	It's crazy.
10280689	10287012	Me, I had a couple of jobs, like level 75, and it was kind of difficult distributing...
10288234	10294257	Skill and prizes and drops throughout the several instances like Dynamis and stuff like that.
10294317	10299540	So I think it'll make it a lot easier for people to just know who is who going forward.
10299800	10308925	I'm a little bit worried because it's a lot of jobs and things can get nerfed, like how Lancer got nerfed when Samurai Dragoon tend to go out of hand.
10309125	10311466	I don't think you remember that with the Pentathrust.
10311687	10312467	Yep, I do.
10312947	10313768	Yeah, so it's...
10314775	10315999	I don't know, I'm still waiting.
10316200	10317985	I mean, we'll see how things go.
10319993	10321094	Did you play the first one?
10321894	10322755	Yes, I did play 1.0.
10324115	10325656	I played at the very, very beginning.
10325676	10332580	I played the beta for 1.0, and then I played the very, very early version, or when it first came out, and I hated it.
10333280	10339184	And I tried playing later after they opened it up and said, all right, we're not charging a monthly fee anymore.
10339204	10341565	I want to say it was like January, February of the next year.
10342105	10348409	And it was still like it just wasn't – it made me go back and play 11 for a little bit.
10348849	10349069	Wow.
10349889	10351090	Yeah, I felt the same way.
10351110	10358813	I mean, it was kind of weird the way the auction house wasn't available, and there was no direction.
10358833	10359573	There's no chocobos.
10359613	10360333	There's no direction.
10360373	10361034	It's crazy.
10361354	10368416	But okay, quickly, before I let you go, since you were a player of XI for so long, what do you think of XIV, having come from XI?
10369317	10370997	I'm excited.
10371338	10377400	I'm taking my time, you know, because, you know, when I played XI, I didn't really know what I was
10377836	10382180	I'm playing as many jobs as possible on several different servers and just trying to get a basic understanding of the game.
10393519	10397962	I'm pretty sure I want to be a scholar, so I'm hoping Arcanist is open soon.
10398402	10402265	I'm hoping they open soon so I can see it before the real game goes live, but we'll see.
10402845	10405226	But anyway, I have to let you go, but thank you so much for the call.
10405286	10407928	Good to hear from you, and I'll always talk MMOs with people.
10408628	10409289	No problem.
10409349	10409749	Take care.
10409929	10410370	Take care, buddy.
10410530	10410730	Bye.
10411771	10412251	All right.
10412611	10412951	Good call.
10412971	10413912	I love hearing from people.
10414292	10417134	Tonight is people we haven't heard from in a while, apparently.
10418035	10418395	All right.
10418595	10419496	You all right over there, Loki?
10419576	10420076	You're giggling.
10420176	10428022	I love these Battlefield 3 animated GIFs because it just... I kind of want to play it even... GIF.
10428622	10431943	I want to play it even more because it looks so glitchy sometimes.
10432263	10438426	Like this guy snipes a jet and makes it blow up in front of his face and nothing happens.
10438446	10442247	1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
10442287	10443908	We'll try to squeeze in at least one more call.
10444688	10447389	I wanted to do a Twitter topic that came in here from Tigerclaw.
10447989	10448809	Sent us a tweet.
10448849	10449470	What is it here?
10450510	10453391	Nintendo defends the rapid release of new Mario games.
10453411	10454631	Although our phone lines are lighting up.
10454651	10455832	Alright, I'll come back to this in a minute.
10456192	10457892	For now, let's go to the Skype line.
10457932	10458873	Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio.
10458893	10459253	Who's this?
10460993	10461593	Hello.
10461793	10462593	Hello.
10463234	10463714	Oh, we have a web.
10463734	10464034	Hey, hey.
10464054	10464934	How's it going?
10464994	10465654	We have a web.
10465674	10466514	It's DT and Gigi here.
10466754	10468255	Oh my gosh, you guys are together.
10468315	10472956	It's a cam thing, though, although all I see is like half of Dark Tetsuya's head, but that's okay.
10473336	10473956	What's up, you guys?
10475316	10476276	Oh, not a whole lot.
10476316	10478437	You know, just been hanging out, playing a lot of games.
10478657	10478897	Yeah.
10478917	10478997	Yeah.
10479773	10480473	Good times.
10480693	10481173	Like what games?
10481213	10483294	Oh, I got sucked into Unepic.
10483414	10484554	That game was so fun.
10485134	10485635	Unepic?
10486135	10486435	Yeah.
10487275	10488475	Tell us a little bit about that one.
10489676	10490376	It's pretty fun.
10490416	10491996	It's like a dungeon crawler.
10493397	10493917	Oh, okay.
10494557	10494917	Cool.
10495017	10497118	It's actually like a Metroidvania type thing.
10498418	10499278	I'm here for that.
10499358	10502839	Is that free or is that like a Steam game?
10502979	10503580	It's $7.99 on Steam.
10503780	10504400	Oh, that's not bad.
10505080	10505420	All right.
10505740	10506060	Okay.
10506160	10507761	I'll have to write that one down.
10507921	10508401	Very cool.
10510376	10513338	So, I'm looking at pictures, actually, it does look kind of neat.
10513739	10516701	It is very Castlevania-like, with big dragons.
10518162	10533713	Yeah, and you can level up your character with each, there's a bar at the top that has a leveling system, and with each level you can put it into weapons or yourself to get more stamina and whatnot.
10534134	10534794	It's pretty fun.
10534954	10535895	That looks super fun.
10536195	10538037	I think I am going to check that out.
10538137	10538617	That's awesome.
10539835	10540235	Yeah.
10540375	10541076	Very cool.
10541176	10544057	So did you guys just call in to get me sucked into a new game and make me spend $8?
10544097	10544217	Yeah.
10544237	10544518	Yeah.
10547499	10548340	Well, congrats.
10548360	10549060	Yeah, that was a plan.
10549080	10550841	We're like, we need to suck him into another game.
10551001	10551301	Yeah.
10551821	10556024	Yeah, because I haven't been talking about how I've been playing Final Fantasy XIV literally all weekend long.
10556304	10557665	Just updated League of Legends.
10557745	10558025	Oh, yeah.
10558085	10559125	I got time for another one.
10559145	10559586	That's all right.
10559626	10561026	Bring it.
10561567	10563988	I was trying to get into the beta, but I don't think I made it.
10564228	10564748	Good news.
10564828	10566249	Beta 4 is going to be open.
10566309	10567650	Anyone who wants to play can play it.
10568749	10572211	And then I heard about the pricing system.
10572271	10573992	Have they already fixed it?
10574592	10584097	You don't have to pay for it yet, but when the game goes live on August 27th, I believe it's $12.95 a month is the lower tier and then like $14.95 for eight characters or something.
10584817	10585538	Don't quote me on that.
10586638	10587779	That seems pretty legit.
10587859	10590961	I think I can work that into my budget because I want that game so bad.
10591161	10591981	Yeah, it's going to be fun.
10592962	10597905	I started playing Final Fantasy back when VII came out.
10600246	10605150	Unfortunately, I was never able to really play the online ones, but I've been a fan ever since VII.
10607628	10609129	Well, there's a lot of fan service in 14.
10609189	10609309	No.
10609409	10612912	There's Moogles.
10613432	10618135	All right, well, you guys, you have fun, and go find another game for me to get addicted to.
10619656	10620777	All right, take care, guys.
10621377	10622218	All right, you too, bye.
10622278	10622638	Bye.
10623238	10627321	Video calls are always fun, even though I can only see like half of each of their head, but it worked.
10627721	10628062	All right.
10630803	10633245	1877GAMEOLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
10633265	10633886	What do you say it's like?
10633926	10635146	Hey, can we try to fit in one more call?
10635266	10635627	Yeah.
10635727	10637208	Someone new needs to call.
10637728	10638328	Someone new?
10638569	10639209	Someone new.
10639509	10639869	We'll see.
10639909	10640590	We'll see what happens.
10640930	10641951	I challenge you.
10642771	10643151	All right.
10643692	10645793	Listeners of OLR, be somebody new.
10645813	10647934	Be quick because there's been a lot of people trying to get through.
10647974	10649915	That's why I'm going to allow one more call to squeeze in here.
10650976	10651256	Let's see.
10651336	10655959	Oh, I was going to read the Tiger Claw tweet that said Nintendo defends the rapid release of new Mario games.
10658610	10660331	Quote, who's this quote from?
10660391	10683068	Nintendo of America Senior Director of Corporate Communications We think we're putting out the right number of Mario games based on what fans are asking for Based on what our own developers' creative visions are The key to that is as long as there's innovation occurring within the gameplay As long as there's new features Then marrying the characters and the IPs that people love is the right call from our standpoint But the phone is ringing again, so let's go to it Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
10684142	10685823	Uh, Name and Lights Name and Lights!
10686363	10691226	Although, it's ironic, because your icon is just a solid black square It is?
10691667	10698811	Well, at least that's what I'm seeing, I don't know, maybe it's not supposed to be But yeah, I do not see your name in lights That's not supposed to be Oh, oops, oh well Alright, well, what's on your mind?
10700492	10711839	This is the first time I've listened to the show live Well, I was gonna say, I recognize your name, but I don't think you've ever called Well, DarkSakura, there you go, you got your new person Yay, thank you Well, uh, what do you think?
10713674	10714054	Interesting.
10715255	10718576	I've been listening to the Orange Lawns for years.
10719036	10722897	Oh, well, and you just now were able to make it to a live show?
10723117	10725318	Usually busy on Sunday nights?
10725398	10726358	Normally I'm sleeping.
10726398	10727679	This is flipping late for me.
10727759	10728279	Oh my gosh.
10728579	10729339	We have a lot of people.
10729359	10731140	Codeman said earlier he was staying up late.
10731200	10735821	I guess a lot of people maybe for the 4th of July week kind of have a lot less going on.
10735861	10736241	I don't know.
10736861	10740102	You may remember me from a couple of the messages I sent you privately.
10740883	10741423	Perhaps.
10742655	10743656	My wife passed away.
10743676	10744737	Yes, that's right.
10744857	10746498	Oh, yes, yes, I do, I do.
10746618	10749420	Of course I recognize that, and I'm very sorry to hear that.
10749820	10751101	Because, yeah, we're Facebook buddies, too.
10751141	10752122	Yeah, we're all Facebook friends.
10752382	10752822	Yeah.
10753423	10756705	So, well... I just got back in the gaming again.
10757005	10757306	Yeah?
10757806	10758586	And what have you been playing?
10760168	10760668	Warcraft.
10761960	10764261	Like old school Warcraft or World of Warcraft?
10764601	10765501	World of Warcraft.
10765981	10767402	I'm in the Horde House Guild.
10767482	10767802	Yeah, yeah.
10767862	10769482	No, I knew you were over there in the Horde House Guild.
10770043	10778385	Thank you for being loyal to the Horde House Guild because unfortunately a lot of people have quit WoW for things like Final Fantasy XIV or League or whatever it is.
10778405	10778885	Or real life.
10779306	10781186	I mean... I was off a month.
10781466	10781746	Yeah.
10782146	10787008	Well, understandably so, but... I was actually sort of thinking about rebuilding my subscription except that
10787785	10788806	Now you have Animal Crossing.
10788866	10789847	I have Animal Crossing.
10790227	10793170	What would you like to do in World of Warcraft?
10793250	10795131	Right now I'm leveling a new monk.
10795632	10795972	Nice.
10797473	10800876	I deleted the monk that I was... Because my wife used to play.
10802357	10806281	And she wanted to play, but when she had the stroke she couldn't see.
10808002	10811105	So I spent three solid weeks...
10811846	10813067	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10838926	10840247	to get your minds out of the gutter, people.
10840528	10843370	They can ride on your back and, like, you can fly them to places.
10843410	10844071	So it's really great.
10844091	10850276	It's like if you have a low-level character, you're like, oh, you need to get to Thunder Bluff or a town that might be far for you to walk to.
10850656	10851277	Get on my back.
10851457	10852137	Let's go.
10852197	10853839	And it was 300 flying, too.
10854079	10855080	Yeah, yeah.
10855140	10858943	So if you had a lower-level character, you could still take him at, what, epic speed, right?
10859083	10859744	Yeah, yeah.
10859824	10860124	You could.
10860905	10865468	Yeah, so when I was off for five weeks taking care of her after the stroke...
10866949	10873854	I upped my warcraft, and the only thing I did was farm archaeology to get the recipe.
10874714	10874895	Right.
10875195	10879378	And she passed away three days after I got it.
10880859	10882240	But at least you got it.
10883580	10886342	Yeah, I did, but I never had a chance for her to use it.
10886542	10887243	Oh, no.
10887963	10889004	I'm sorry to hear that.
10890345	10892066	So I pretty much stopped WoW.
10892126	10894448	I deleted the monk that I leveled with her.
10895669	10895949	Mm-hmm.
10896434	10923904	and it was tough to get back in yeah has kind of getting in I mean I hate to dwell on what might be a difficult topic but has this been a way for you to kind of help get back into you know after such a tragedy as video games kind of helped you a little bit in getting back into what might have been your routine before it took a while to get back into it because
10925945	10934568	I was trying to play after she passed away, but I just couldn't play more than a few minutes without getting irritatedly bored and just shutting it off.
10935768	10938969	So I didn't up my account until very recently.
10941350	10943691	And I named a character after her.
10944651	10947632	That's a great way to memorialize somebody.
10947732	10949433	I know of other people that have done that in WoW.
10949633	10950093	Absolutely.
10950708	10958836	I know that even the developers, when people that they were close to that were involved in the game, they've immortalized them in the game too.
10959037	10961840	Yes, there's some really great memorial.
10961940	10968227	I mean, usually this is more for people that were really part of the WoW community and heavy raiders and stuff that...
10968647	10971529	But they have set up tributes.
10971590	10973351	Blizzard has kind of done that in the game.
10973391	10976574	And there's some really great compilations out there on YouTube.
10977034	10983119	I know somebody that had this for somebody that they were married to.
10983419	10988223	And yeah, really great when the companies kind of do that.
10988363	10995869	I mean, it just really emphasizes the community that an MMO game and what really makes those games great is the community.
10996110	10996370	Yeah.
10997822	10999643	Yeah, it's been hard.
11000003	11001504	Of course.
11001524	11004325	The last couple months have been ridiculously hard.
11004665	11004905	Right.
11006005	11006406	Of course.
11007466	11022532	I'm not even going to sit here and try to imagine, but you know you got friends here at OLR and at the Voice of Geeks Network and out there in Facebook land and on the internet that are trying to help you through it.
11022772	11026114	I hope it's getting a little better every day.
11027492	11028194	Except for today.
11029637	11031080	I got my eviction notice today.
11031240	11031861	Oh my god.
11035396	11036537	I don't know what to say.
11039738	11041339	Bobby should start a support group.
11042339	11047021	I need bad news to stop happening to our listeners.
11048302	11049102	This is bad.
11051203	11054504	Gosh, I don't know what we can do to help.
11057006	11057926	I knew this was coming.
11057946	11061247	I knew when she passed away I wasn't going to be able to afford the house that we have.
11061327	11062368	Sure, sure.
11064904	11066048	What goes around comes around.
11066088	11068436	So I got the eviction notice that opened a beer.
11070589	11072309	When in doubt, when in doubt, why not?
11072949	11073549	All right, buddy.
11073950	11077791	Well, we're all thinking of you, and good luck pulling through.
11078991	11080252	I mean, I love the show.
11080352	11081212	I love listening.
11081352	11083313	I love Horde House.
11084713	11085733	I'm an avid listener.
11085793	11088314	This is the first time I've actually had a chance to be up this late.
11089415	11091635	My buddy was helping me pack up some stuff tonight.
11092195	11093576	It's the only reason why I'm still up.
11094917	11095677	He took off.
11096758	11099420	I just decided to turn the show on.
11099460	11105044	I know you guys don't usually end around 12, 1 o'clock Eastern Time because I am on the East Coast.
11106305	11109968	But I listen to you guys on a regular basis for years now.
11110008	11111549	I just never have a chance to listen live.
11112042	11113043	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
11136121	11141404	I ended up getting a career I've been at for 12 years now.
11141524	11147927	Not to get all preachy and everything, she was happiest ever as a teacher.
11149628	11153870	She was teaching CNAs, which is Certified Nursing Assistants.
11154490	11155891	She loved her job.
11156511	11159312	She was an RN.
11159372	11162214	She was two credits away from being a bachelor's.
11163254	11172317	And, you know, when she lost that job because they changed the qualifications for the job, I just simply told her that it's like, you know what, I'll support you.
11172717	11173838	I'll do whatever it takes.
11174818	11181580	Just, you know, go back to school, get your education and get more education than the person that just fired you.
11184478	11185799	And that's what she was going to do.
11186660	11192605	She was... Sorry, but... No, I understand.
11195848	11196688	Cinco de Mayo.
11199531	11200832	She wanted to go back to the school.
11203717	11207258	She was supposed to start school on the 5th and I told her that the module wasn't going to open up on the 5th because it was a holiday Um
11234170	11238503	She went to school on Monday and passed away on Tuesday.
11248035	11253719	Well, you're getting the world's biggest hug from our chat room right now for this, you know, all over the place.
11253859	11263445	But how great that you were helping her to achieve this and, you know, come out of the circumstance better.
11263725	11267287	And I know wherever she is right now, she's thanking you big time for it.
11269548	11271550	It's been a really horrible two months.
11273651	11277574	I was glad May was over with, but June is just... June's gone.
11278194	11281236	It is July, isn't it?
11282597	11282958	Tomorrow.
11283338	11284659	Well, today for East Coast.
11285259	11289382	Yeah, it's just... She went back to school one day.
11293765	11295306	But you helped her get back to school.
11295887	11297868	You did.
11298228	11299850	All she wanted to do was become a teacher.
11302414	11302735	You know what?
11302755	11303656	My mom was a teacher.
11306018	11306779	It's a great profession.
11306839	11308000	I'm actually a corporate trainer.
11308641	11309521	It's a great profession.
11309581	11310923	It's an admirable thing.
11310963	11311643	I love my job.
11312324	11313185	Absolutely love my job.
11314306	11315928	Well, I'm going to let you go.
11316148	11316328	Sure.
11317229	11323055	I'll try to listen again live again when the dust settles.
11324716	11326358	And I'll stay in touch.
11326874	11327815	Alright, please do stay in touch.
11327835	11328635	Message me on Facebook.
11329156	11329396	I will.
11329656	11329836	Okay.
11330076	11330837	Alright, you take care.
11330957	11331678	We're all thinking of you.
11332058	11332338	Bye-bye.
11332538	11332738	Bye.
11334039	11334740	Ooh, how's that?
11336061	11336741	Tough call.
11336962	11340965	I need someone to cut... Quick, Loki, I need a fart joke.
11341105	11341405	Quick.
11342466	11343006	Help me.
11343987	11345388	You know what?
11345448	11346449	I have happy-happies.
11347150	11360892	because look at the chat room I mean yeah for real seriously for real and you know there's even I'm sure a lot of people are like wow that was a heavy call and yes it was a heavy call but when we say we're there for people we kind of like mean it and shit so
11361810	11376407	and you know the biggest thing that me that I like to do for people is I like to find if there's a tough situation I like to find research everything that has to do with it and offer options because especially when you're in the middle of a situation
11377308	11380610	There's not always things that occur to you when you're in that situation.
11381351	11391958	And when Dan and I were... Because you know when we got our notice for the house that we were staying in rent-free, we had to move in a week.
11393439	11397582	And it was people helping us and giving us options that opened the door for us, too.
11397682	11397842	So...
11399023	11407612	If you need to bounce any ideas, if you need just someone outside the situation to help you see it clearly, let me know.
11407692	11408233	I'm happy to help.
11408962	11410023	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
11434324	11435064	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
11450349	11465755	Some people are playing video games to kind of escape reality such as the very difficult thing that he just shared with us which is not an easy thing to get on some radio show and talk about what happened so you know I commend him for being able to do that and keeping it together even as much as he did.
11466655	11494522	but you never know who's going to be on the other end of that game you're playing in that MMO or on that Xbox Live so you know have a little decency for each other and you know anyway just think do you want it being said to you and even more do you want it being said to someone you care about so because there's people who can take it but they don't take it when it's somebody that they care about so just think about it that way alright
11495734	11502917	Well, anyhow, do we have any other last-minute stories to try and transition us back onto the video game news we were talking about earlier?
11503237	11507839	I think... Oh, yeah, I got through the Twitter topic, which was the only one that we got, but...
11510797	11514659	Uh, they're selling an Earthbound Zero Reproduction NES cart.
11515580	11516100	Gimme.
11516741	11522564	It's, uh, an English translated ROM of, uh, you know, the game Mother.
11523584	11525786	And, uh, of course it never came out over here.
11526526	11528287	And I guess it's being, um...
11529488	11532131	I don't know who's doing the reproduction of it or if it even works.
11533132	11533753	I don't know.
11533793	11539740	Wasn't that the one that had the anti-piracy thing that would shut down the game?
11539780	11540400	Earthbound.
11541942	11549771	Yeah, no, I know that would get harder, but I thought Earthbound Zero even had the prototype ROM was infamous for having these game-breaking bugs in it, but maybe the hackers fixed that.
11550211	11550712	I don't remember.
11550752	11551592	It's been so long.
11552653	11557997	It seems like it was so long ago that that all happened.
11558017	11561680	I'm not sure if it actually does anything or if it's just a reproduction of the original.
11562721	11564242	I don't know.
11564562	11568025	I never played Mother, but I always thought it was kind of a glitchy game to begin with.
11568645	11569206	Actual version.
11569800	11572503	Uh, like, you mean the Earthbound that was on the SNES here?
11572523	11573143	No, no, no.
11573563	11573864	Mother.
11573964	11575245	Mother Earthbound Zero.
11575265	11577967	I think because it wasn't finished, it was still glitchy, yes.
11579008	11579488	Absolutely.
11580329	11580649	Alright.
11581690	11583572	Well, um, that does it for the Skype line tonight.
11583692	11584873	That does it for our Twitter topics.
11584933	11590678	I think that did it for the, um, uh, last minute stories as well, unless you have anything else to surprise me with over there?
11591699	11591779	No?
11592739	11594040	I, um, no.
11595040	11595180	Okay.
11595621	11597041	I love all the Hello Kitty everywhere.
11598122	11600283	Yeah, you can thank Slidekick for some of that.
11601003	11602484	Slidekick, I want to thank you for being here.
11602724	11604144	Thank you so much for having me.
11604464	11609647	You know, I've been listening for years, and I'm so glad that I finally was able to come up and get on the show.
11609667	11610327	It'll take you 11 years.
11610927	11623251	and you really got to run the gauntlet of an OLR show tonight from the dick and fart jokes and the stuff at the beginning to some real heavy stuff there at the end so it's like you got a whole two years worth of OLR emotions in one show so congratulations.
11623271	11625051	We know every gamer has their voice here so.
11625531	11627132	Thank you, yes that's what we strive for.
11628293	11629474	Best of luck with your project.
11629494	11630135	Congratulations.
11630155	11631977	You've made it a year on Gamebuoy.org.
11631997	11633459	Thank you.
11634360	11636903	I look forward to sharing the stage with you at GamerX.
11636983	11637764	It'll be a lot of fun.
11638104	11638885	It'll be my honor.
11639085	11640967	Everybody else, aw, shucks.
11641268	11642229	One more time with the plugs.
11642269	11643290	How can they find your fine show?
11643550	11645071	GameBooey.org GameBooey.org GameBooey.org
11665720	11666681	We love OLR.
11666701	11668442	We love all our OLR listeners.
11668702	11671424	We're usually in chat when OLR is going on.
11671504	11676588	So if you haven't checked us out yet, we'd love to hear from you and hope you enjoy what you hear.
11677228	11679870	We love indie podcasts, period.
11680050	11687576	I mean, I don't want to sound shady or anything, but do you think some of the corporate casts out there could have done some of these calls we did tonight?
11687656	11687936	No.
11688857	11691418	That's the difference, y'all.
11691438	11692059	That's the difference.
11692691	11698396	We might have to get Alan in here because TimTRP in chat says we demand a Fabulous Flames reunion show.
11698516	11699236	Where's Alan?
11700157	11701938	Oh, I think he ran outside or something.
11702439	11702719	Damn.
11702879	11703700	Braving the heat.
11704560	11707042	Maybe he's trying to figure out how to make it cooler in here.
11707563	11708764	Here he is.
11709604	11711626	Alan, when's the Fabulous Flames reunion show?
11711886	11713788	Definitely look that up on iTunes, y'all.
11715529	11718371	It's one week after I win $50 billion in the lottery.
11720473	11721393	We're going to win the lottery.
11721454	11722174	Yay.
11723675	11723955	All right.
11724815	11725115	That's it.
11725475	11728517	Alan, did you have a final thought for the listeners tonight before you run out?
11729557	11733139	I still think it may actually be a few degrees hotter outside than it is in here.
11733872	11736274	Sweet Jesus, when did I move to Phoenix?
11737755	11740077	You know what's happening, by the way, next Sunday for me?
11740878	11741959	We are on the house hunt.
11742339	11742800	Oh, good luck.
11743340	11747324	Which may end up being a new dedicated studio.
11747564	11749265	That would be nice, I'm not going to complain.
11750246	11751107	Wish us luck.
11751387	11754410	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts so we can wrap up and head on out of here.
11754790	11756131	Again, Slykick, thank you for being here.
11756151	11757993	Do you have an official final thought for our listeners tonight?
11759374	11760235	I want a burger.
11761641	11763482	Oh my god, so do I. I'm so hungry.
11763522	11765423	Burgers are pretty fucking good, I gotta say.
11765443	11766784	I'm gonna hit the drive-thru on my way home.
11768444	11769025	Get it, girl.
11770405	11771846	Yeah, you got 30 minutes to get to Pinkberry.
11771906	11772406	Ooh, girl.
11773687	11775248	Loki, you're packing up.
11775268	11775948	You're ready to go.
11776028	11779009	Good luck with all your disease and everything.
11779109	11780270	Hope you're cured by next week.
11781150	11784032	Make sure that you find those rats that gave you the bubonic plague.
11785053	11803635	okay all right at least it's not herpes uh your final thought tonight and here's only with weather it's hot uh my final thought is that if you live in northern California you should make plans to come see Clue at the Colonial Theater in Sacramento on July 27th I'm playing Colonel Mustard it'll be fun yes I do other finally find a tie
11803735	11804535	DarkSakura, your final thoughts tonight?
11830971	11832512	I actually have an appetite tonight.
11833073	11836596	I had French toast this morning and I thought I wouldn't be hungry all day.
11836716	11837697	I'm actually hungry right now.
11838878	11840519	Get some pinkberry, girl.
