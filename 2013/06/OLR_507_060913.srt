1
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:26,776
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, June 9, 2013, Microsoft's controversial announcements could change the industry forever, Zynga layoffs affect a developer they recently acquired, and E3 is next week, and we're making our predictions for the big show.

2
00:00:32,455 --> 00:00:37,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:00:37,617 --> 00:00:43,259
[SPEAKER_04]: It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 507 for this June 9th of 2013.

4
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,060
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts.

5
00:00:46,141 --> 00:00:48,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

6
00:00:49,222 --> 00:00:50,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Greetings and salutations.

7
00:00:50,802 --> 00:00:51,883
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hope you're doing well, Ms.

8
00:00:51,903 --> 00:00:52,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Summers.

9
00:00:53,237 --> 00:00:53,597
[SPEAKER_10]: I am.

10
00:00:53,917 --> 00:00:54,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

11
00:00:54,498 --> 00:00:55,258
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm caffeinated.

12
00:00:55,278 --> 00:00:55,818
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Rob.

13
00:00:56,038 --> 00:00:56,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to hear.

14
00:00:56,578 --> 00:00:58,759
[SPEAKER_04]: And also joining us tonight, Tech Master Loki.

15
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:03,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, definitely working in that Tech Master moniker this week.

16
00:01:03,861 --> 00:01:04,342
[SPEAKER_04]: How so?

17
00:01:04,462 --> 00:01:04,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Quickly.

18
00:01:04,922 --> 00:01:05,942
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to fix my laptop.

19
00:01:06,523 --> 00:01:06,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

20
00:01:06,823 --> 00:01:07,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Hard drive crash.

21
00:01:07,563 --> 00:01:11,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've been following your tweets, your Twitters, and all the hard drive drama.

22
00:01:11,865 --> 00:01:14,806
[SPEAKER_03]: But now it works pretty much like it did before.

23
00:01:15,086 --> 00:01:16,927
[SPEAKER_03]: All it needed was a little reformatting.

24
00:01:17,367 --> 00:01:29,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, all the non-essential stuff's not working, like some of these touch buttons up the top here that I never use, or the icon's different now for the volume up and down, but eh, whatever.

25
00:01:29,524 --> 00:01:32,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Big week this week, E3 obviously coming up.

26
00:01:32,828 --> 00:01:34,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, none of us attending this year.

27
00:01:35,171 --> 00:01:37,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby Blackwolf from the Voice Geeks Network at vognetwork.com.

28
00:01:38,013 --> 00:01:38,753
[SPEAKER_04]: He is attending.

29
00:01:39,113 --> 00:01:48,839
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you haven't already checked it out, do check out the interactive coverage of E3 presented in an all-new way at the Voice Geeks Network at e3.vognetwork.com.

30
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Or at least we think it's an all-new way.

31
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,980
[SPEAKER_04]: The internet's a big place.

32
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:52,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably.

33
00:01:53,241 --> 00:01:54,322
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't seen it.

34
00:02:10,689 --> 00:02:11,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get into it, Loki.

35
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:33,914
[SPEAKER_03]: So, after the whole... Well, I guess the promise was, after the Xbox One press event thing that they did back in May, that there was going to be some answers about, or clarification, I guess, on the big hot topics that they were getting grilled on after the event, basically.

36
00:02:35,194 --> 00:02:37,876
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the deal with, you know, the online connectivity?

37
00:02:37,896 --> 00:02:40,198
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, how often do I need to connect to the internet?

38
00:02:40,558 --> 00:02:42,419
[SPEAKER_03]: How is the used game thing going to work?

39
00:02:42,839 --> 00:02:49,984
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and, you know, what's up with the Kinect having to be online all the time or attached to your system at all times of work?

40
00:02:50,465 --> 00:02:53,647
[SPEAKER_03]: So, on Friday, I think it was Friday.

41
00:02:53,827 --> 00:02:54,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it Friday?

42
00:02:54,487 --> 00:02:55,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the 6th.

43
00:02:55,628 --> 00:02:57,750
[SPEAKER_03]: On Friday, no, it was Thursday.

44
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:10,056
[SPEAKER_03]: On the sixth, they released a three-page document called Xbox One, Details on Connectivity, Licensing, and Privacy Features.

45
00:03:10,636 --> 00:03:15,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go through each one, shall we?

46
00:03:20,086 --> 00:03:23,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox One, a modern connected device.

47
00:03:24,435 --> 00:03:29,887
[SPEAKER_03]: And to kind of spoil everything, none of this stuff is actually sounding any good.

48
00:03:30,007 --> 00:03:31,330
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty much just...

49
00:03:33,557 --> 00:03:43,467
[SPEAKER_03]: The Xbox One will deliver new benefits for gamers that are only possible with a system designed from the ground up to be ready and connected.

50
00:03:43,527 --> 00:03:44,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Here are a few examples.

51
00:03:53,092 --> 00:03:54,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Make your game more powerful or something.

52
00:03:54,753 --> 00:03:56,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Your Xbox One is always ready.

53
00:03:56,835 --> 00:03:59,096
[SPEAKER_03]: It's designed to run, I guess, low power state.

54
00:04:01,078 --> 00:04:02,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, let's get to the good part.

55
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:08,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Network technologies and network requirements.

56
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:09,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.

57
00:04:09,724 --> 00:04:14,207
[SPEAKER_03]: For an optimal experience, we recommend a broadband connection of 1.5 megabits.

58
00:04:15,608 --> 00:04:20,031
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, if in areas where, I guess...

59
00:04:21,652 --> 00:04:23,533
[SPEAKER_03]: An Ethernet connection is not available.

60
00:04:23,573 --> 00:04:25,594
[SPEAKER_03]: You can connect using mobile broadband.

61
00:04:26,215 --> 00:04:26,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Lucky you.

62
00:04:27,415 --> 00:04:43,103
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, while a persistent connection is not required, the Xbox One is designed to verify if the system application or game updates are needed and to see if you have acquired new games, resold or traded in games, or have given a game to a friend.

63
00:04:43,964 --> 00:04:47,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Games that are designed to take advantage of the cloud system may require a connection.

64
00:04:48,906 --> 00:04:57,948
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, with Xbox One, you can game offline for up to 24 hours on your primary console or one hour if you're logged into a separate console accessing your library.

65
00:04:58,128 --> 00:05:04,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Offline gaming is not possible after these prescribed times until you reestablish a connection.

66
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:07,290
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can still... Oh, oh, and this is the best part.

67
00:05:07,551 --> 00:05:08,251
[SPEAKER_03]: But guess what?

68
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:13,512
[SPEAKER_03]: You can still watch live TV, enjoy your Blu-ray and DVD movies.

69
00:05:13,732 --> 00:05:15,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, thank you, Xbox One!

70
00:05:15,334 --> 00:05:18,798
[SPEAKER_03]: I can still enjoy TV that you are connected to.

71
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:29,409
[SPEAKER_10]: Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to mourn the loss of the gaming industry.

72
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:30,751
[SPEAKER_10]: Rest in peace.

73
00:05:31,191 --> 00:05:32,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's get to the next thing here.

74
00:05:33,494 --> 00:05:34,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so, um...

75
00:05:36,863 --> 00:05:40,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Next, how game licensing will work on the Xbox One.

76
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:43,605
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm glad that they have to tell me how it's going to work.

77
00:05:44,425 --> 00:05:52,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so basically you buy the games the way you want, disc or digital, and you'll be able to buy them through traditional retailers or online through Xbox Live.

78
00:05:53,027 --> 00:05:56,447
[SPEAKER_03]: And it says, discs will continue to be a great way to install your game quickly.

79
00:05:56,587 --> 00:05:59,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, to install, not play off of install.

80
00:06:00,549 --> 00:06:11,334
[SPEAKER_03]: You can access your entire games library from any Xbox One, no discs required.

81
00:06:12,614 --> 00:06:16,036
[SPEAKER_03]: You can share access with your games to everyone inside your home.

82
00:06:16,456 --> 00:06:21,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Your friends, family, guests, and acquaintances get unlimited access to all your games.

83
00:06:21,198 --> 00:06:24,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone can play your games on your console regardless of whether you are logged in

84
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,421
[SPEAKER_03]: or their relationship to you.

85
00:06:26,801 --> 00:06:31,663
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, a feature that's been available on console gaming since the beginning of time.

86
00:06:33,244 --> 00:06:39,587
[SPEAKER_03]: That yes, if I bring a friend over, that they can play on the Xbox One without it going, hey, who are you?

87
00:06:40,028 --> 00:06:42,369
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you doing trying to touch my controller and play this game?

88
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Get your hands off my controller.

89
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,152
[SPEAKER_03]: I need an adult.

90
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:58,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you could share access, oh, let's see, uh, give your family access to your entire games library anytime, anywhere.

91
00:06:58,124 --> 00:06:59,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this is kind of weird.

92
00:06:59,665 --> 00:07:05,872
[SPEAKER_03]: The Xbox One, I guess, they're going to have a way where up to ten people of your family, or whoever you're saying is your family...

93
00:07:06,312 --> 00:07:11,133
[SPEAKER_03]: can log in and play from your shared games library on any Xbox One.

94
00:07:11,553 --> 00:07:23,035
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I buy a copy of, say, Forza Motorsports or something like that, someone else can go to a friend's house or whatever or from their own location and play that copy of Forza as well.

95
00:07:23,455 --> 00:07:26,336
[SPEAKER_03]: But only one person can play at a time.

96
00:07:26,516 --> 00:07:27,056
[SPEAKER_04]: And not at launch.

97
00:07:27,616 --> 00:07:29,696
[SPEAKER_04]: None of this is available at launch.

98
00:07:29,876 --> 00:07:31,756
[SPEAKER_03]: All the good stuff, all the pros, not at launch.

99
00:07:31,936 --> 00:07:33,057
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that's available at launch.

100
00:07:33,997 --> 00:07:34,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't say.

101
00:07:35,438 --> 00:07:39,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Trade in and resell your disc-based games.

102
00:07:40,804 --> 00:07:45,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Today, some gamers choose to sell their old disc-based games back for cash and credit.

103
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:52,979
[SPEAKER_03]: We've designed the Xbox Ones so game publishers can enable you to trade in your games at participating retailers.

104
00:07:53,499 --> 00:07:55,119
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's an optional feature.

105
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,060
[SPEAKER_04]: So no eBay, gone.

106
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,261
[SPEAKER_04]: No flea markets, gone.

107
00:08:00,721 --> 00:08:02,441
[SPEAKER_04]: No garage sales, gone.

108
00:08:02,902 --> 00:08:05,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Authorized retailers only if the publisher allows it.

109
00:08:06,302 --> 00:08:09,203
[SPEAKER_04]: It's now not my choice on what I'm going to do with my game.

110
00:08:09,343 --> 00:08:13,004
[SPEAKER_04]: It's now Microsoft's choice or the publisher's choice on what I'm going to do with my game.

111
00:08:13,024 --> 00:08:13,404
[SPEAKER_10]: But we don't own it.

112
00:08:13,424 --> 00:08:14,144
[SPEAKER_10]: We're licensing it.

113
00:08:14,284 --> 00:08:14,645
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

114
00:08:14,665 --> 00:08:16,085
[SPEAKER_04]: It was never ours to begin with.

115
00:08:18,545 --> 00:08:24,116
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't sign a form when I'm playing these games, although I'm sure you're going to have to agree to it when you install your game.

116
00:08:24,176 --> 00:08:24,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sure.

117
00:08:25,018 --> 00:08:29,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Press A to agree to the 500-page terms and conditions, or you won't be able to play anything.

118
00:08:30,288 --> 00:08:30,929
[SPEAKER_04]: This thing's a brick.

119
00:08:32,015 --> 00:08:39,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, Microsoft does not charge a platform fee to retailers, publishers, or consumers for enabling transfer of these games.

120
00:08:40,742 --> 00:08:49,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, I don't know, kind of goes against what I've heard, what we've been hearing rumors-wise, but maybe it's not Microsoft charging them, maybe it's the publishers charging these guys, I don't really know.

121
00:08:50,289 --> 00:08:51,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever, that doesn't...

122
00:08:52,651 --> 00:08:52,911
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

123
00:08:53,472 --> 00:08:55,113
[SPEAKER_04]: So what are the key points out of this whole thing?

124
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:57,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we got to get to the bottom line here.

125
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:58,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, a couple more.

126
00:08:58,636 --> 00:08:58,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

127
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,637
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

128
00:09:00,797 --> 00:09:02,839
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to allow you to give your games to a friend.

129
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:05,521
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can enable your disc-based game.

130
00:09:06,222 --> 00:09:07,362
[SPEAKER_03]: You give it to a friend, basically.

131
00:09:07,382 --> 00:09:08,103
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no fees.

132
00:09:08,904 --> 00:09:11,526
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's two requirements in order to transfer this to your friend.

133
00:09:12,206 --> 00:09:27,086
[SPEAKER_03]: they have to be on your friends list for 30 days and you can only give it you can only give the game once once it's been transferred to them I don't think that they can give it back to someone else now I don't know if that's clarified if there is so no wishing for more wishes

134
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:41,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, but I mean, if it is where you can give it to somebody, you know, the friends listening is kind of annoying, but like say you can give it to them and then they can give it to somebody else, you know, that's not so bad, but it's still annoying.

135
00:09:42,156 --> 00:09:42,617
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

136
00:09:42,757 --> 00:09:44,998
[SPEAKER_04]: I will give credit where credit is due.

137
00:09:45,098 --> 00:09:49,982
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like Microsoft's trying to implement the Kindle book borrowing thing, which just sounds a lot like.

138
00:09:50,482 --> 00:09:52,223
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, all right, that's cool.

139
00:09:52,243 --> 00:09:54,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I know I lend out a lot of video games I never get back.

140
00:09:54,783 --> 00:09:56,324
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's interesting.

141
00:09:56,344 --> 00:09:57,564
[SPEAKER_04]: They can be handled all digitally.

142
00:09:58,085 --> 00:10:00,685
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, what am I having to give up?

143
00:10:01,306 --> 00:10:03,306
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the minus for this plus, right?

144
00:10:03,426 --> 00:10:03,626
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

145
00:10:03,826 --> 00:10:04,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

146
00:10:04,046 --> 00:10:05,487
[SPEAKER_03]: And last but not least, I'll just breeze through this.

147
00:10:05,507 --> 00:10:06,227
[SPEAKER_03]: The Kinect stuff.

148
00:10:07,308 --> 00:10:09,508
[SPEAKER_03]: They say you're in control of what the Kinect can see and hear.

149
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:14,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I guess you get to adjust your privacy settings or something.

150
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:14,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

151
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:21,712
[SPEAKER_03]: So the system will navigate you through key privacy options like automatic or manual sign-in, privacy settings, and clear notification of how data is used.

152
00:10:22,693 --> 00:10:24,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, how is data being used?

153
00:10:24,513 --> 00:10:28,775
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm assuming this thing is just going to be listening for advertising purposes and stuff.

154
00:10:29,435 --> 00:10:31,856
[SPEAKER_10]: If they hear a lot of wank, a lot of porn.

155
00:10:32,426 --> 00:10:37,728
[SPEAKER_03]: You're in control of the Kinect sensor sensing on, off, or pause.

156
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,229
[SPEAKER_03]: You can turn off your Xbox One.

157
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:47,712
[SPEAKER_03]: They say it's only listening for a single voice command of Xbox On, but come on.

158
00:10:47,912 --> 00:10:48,372
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

159
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:55,315
[SPEAKER_03]: You're in control of your personal data, and you can use other inputs to control your games, TV, and entertainment experiences.

160
00:10:55,435 --> 00:10:56,796
[SPEAKER_03]: So once again, why do I need the Kinect?

161
00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:11,456
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna be honest, and I'm not trying to be that snarky kid on Twitter, but this is really kind of like a vague answer that they kind of gave to this.

162
00:11:11,556 --> 00:11:13,858
[SPEAKER_04]: So does it have to be on or not?

163
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:21,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's basically, it has to be connected to your system, but I think you can... Point it at the wall and cover the mic?

164
00:11:21,302 --> 00:11:24,443
[SPEAKER_03]: You can turn your system off or something and it won't be listening.

165
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:28,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Just don't underestimate the value of privacy and all that.

166
00:11:29,044 --> 00:11:31,845
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is really badly timed for Microsoft.

167
00:11:31,885 --> 00:11:34,486
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, again... There's a lot of news that's great.

168
00:11:34,806 --> 00:11:36,446
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of news out there right now.

169
00:11:36,466 --> 00:11:37,526
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not trying to get political.

170
00:11:37,546 --> 00:11:38,487
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to take the show there.

171
00:11:38,587 --> 00:11:41,087
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's a lot of news right now about privacy.

172
00:11:41,988 --> 00:11:43,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Microsoft's name's involved.

173
00:11:43,408 --> 00:11:44,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

174
00:11:44,249 --> 00:11:49,072
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is not a good time to be requiring anything with that connect.

175
00:11:49,392 --> 00:11:49,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Just saying.

176
00:11:50,153 --> 00:11:58,638
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're saying that some of the examples, of course, they've mentioned before, a fitness game can measure your heart rate, give you feedback about your exercise routine or whatever.

177
00:11:58,978 --> 00:12:00,900
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll be able to tell if you're a communist.

178
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:05,202
[SPEAKER_03]: A card game could allow you to bluff your virtual opponent using your facial expressions.

179
00:12:06,443 --> 00:12:11,231
[SPEAKER_03]: But once again, the Kinect could allow you to scan in your objects and use them in real games.

180
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:13,254
[SPEAKER_03]: That never happens, so who knows.

181
00:12:13,514 --> 00:12:14,656
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, okay, so that's it.

182
00:12:14,716 --> 00:12:15,898
[SPEAKER_03]: That's basically the information.

183
00:12:17,461 --> 00:12:20,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's the thing.

184
00:12:20,182 --> 00:12:21,762
[SPEAKER_04]: You ever seen that show Shark Tank?

185
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:22,763
[SPEAKER_04]: You ever watch that show?

186
00:12:23,783 --> 00:12:25,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the premise of the show.

187
00:12:25,684 --> 00:12:28,465
[SPEAKER_04]: These guys pitch their ideas to all these big executives.

188
00:12:28,485 --> 00:12:30,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Mark Cuban's one of the executives that sits there.

189
00:12:30,806 --> 00:12:45,212
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually, as far as reality TV goes, it's one of the better shows because it's a little more like these guys are real business makers and you kind of see, like, I don't know, there's less of the pompousness that comes with the Donald Trump business show and there's a little more, like, you know, reality, I guess, for lack of a better term.

190
00:12:45,592 --> 00:12:46,053
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

191
00:13:03,732 --> 00:13:11,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, anyway, the whole pitch is that as you're given these ideas, if one of the executives says, I'm out, that's their sign that they are not going to put a bid.

192
00:13:11,698 --> 00:13:16,021
[SPEAKER_04]: And if all four of them say, I'm out, the guy loses, walks away, doesn't get the financing they want.

193
00:13:16,461 --> 00:13:22,865
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got to admit, after listening to this whole detail thing that's gone on this week, I'm kind of sitting in that chair.

194
00:13:22,985 --> 00:13:32,232
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I'm hearing about the whole, here's the minuses, here's a plus in the game trading and all that, but here's all these minuses that suddenly these $60 games may not be worth anything anymore.

195
00:13:32,252 --> 00:13:32,432
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

196
00:13:32,692 --> 00:13:34,574
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not have... That's what I hate the most.

197
00:13:35,134 --> 00:13:37,576
[SPEAKER_04]: I no longer have the power to sell this game on eBay.

198
00:13:37,857 --> 00:13:41,259
[SPEAKER_04]: If I want to do it, I have to go to a GameStop or a comparable store.

199
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:42,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you kidding me?

200
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,341
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not what I want.

201
00:13:43,681 --> 00:13:45,663
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the point where I said, I'm out.

202
00:13:46,724 --> 00:13:50,487
[SPEAKER_03]: And on top of that, the plus is like, oh, you can loan it to your friend.

203
00:13:50,647 --> 00:13:53,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Something I can do already right now with all these fucking restrictions.

204
00:13:55,713 --> 00:13:57,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do I even... And that's the thing.

205
00:13:58,115 --> 00:14:02,118
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so sad that this has to happen because I want to be excited about this new console.

206
00:14:02,138 --> 00:14:05,240
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to be excited about the games that they're coming out with.

207
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:12,625
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm sorry, even if there's like a new Crackdown game or whatever the big awesome game they're going to show us, all this stuff is just like right in front of me.

208
00:14:12,645 --> 00:14:15,707
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, well, that sounds cool, but nope.

209
00:14:17,008 --> 00:14:19,190
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, it's very much like how I treat Origin.

210
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Battlefield 3 looks fucking amazing.

211
00:14:22,193 --> 00:14:23,454
[SPEAKER_03]: I really want to play that game.

212
00:14:23,695 --> 00:14:26,378
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not installing Origin, so therefore I'm not going to play the game.

213
00:14:27,098 --> 00:14:27,579
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

214
00:14:27,719 --> 00:14:29,041
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's unfortunate.

215
00:14:29,061 --> 00:14:33,506
[SPEAKER_03]: These games look awesome, but all this stuff stands in my way, so I'm not going to do it.

216
00:14:33,746 --> 00:14:36,409
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, a lot of it is kind of about control.

217
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:37,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Control.

218
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:58,398
[SPEAKER_04]: and I feel like what's happening this console generation that I just don't fucking like is that the publishers are trying to take all these things away from me that I used to get as the investor in the game you know what I mean like I used to be able to sell the used games and you know trade the games I wanted to and they could put in the disc or whatever like

219
00:14:58,718 --> 00:15:02,499
[SPEAKER_04]: The publishers have been slowly thinking of ways to take that away, and I just don't like it.

220
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:10,902
[SPEAKER_04]: And look, I understand the cost of developing a game is super expensive and all that, but the line's gotta be drawn somewhere.

221
00:15:10,922 --> 00:15:12,503
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have to be super expensive.

222
00:15:12,543 --> 00:15:17,865
[SPEAKER_03]: They decide to go big and, you know, big and bold, I guess, for their games.

223
00:15:17,985 --> 00:15:18,785
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have to be.

224
00:15:18,905 --> 00:15:20,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Indie games that come out are still just as good.

225
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:22,887
[SPEAKER_03]: How much did it cost to develop Minecraft?

226
00:15:22,987 --> 00:15:25,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, it's not as visually stunning as something else, but

227
00:15:26,608 --> 00:15:27,930
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have to be visually stunning.

228
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:28,810
[SPEAKER_03]: It just has to be fun.

229
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:29,992
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to be fun to play.

230
00:15:30,032 --> 00:15:31,113
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all it has to be.

231
00:15:50,392 --> 00:15:55,136
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand that, that this is the way the industry wants to move, but I have a right to say I'm not moving with it.

232
00:15:55,456 --> 00:15:56,877
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we all have that right.

233
00:15:57,197 --> 00:16:00,119
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the industries don't determine what the consumers do.

234
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:02,641
[SPEAKER_10]: The consumers determine what the industry should do.

235
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:11,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I want to make an analogy to where I think this is all going, but actually first I want to address, because I see numerous people in chat rooms saying, well, that's it.

236
00:16:11,328 --> 00:16:13,089
[SPEAKER_04]: PS4 is for me this generation.

237
00:16:13,609 --> 00:16:13,949
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

238
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:15,610
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

239
00:16:37,138 --> 00:16:58,633
[SPEAKER_03]: and I mean look at all the stuff that's happened you know before all this this this whole three-page thing came out there was reports going Microsoft canceled their after you know conference Q&A session they canceled their one-on-one interviews they just don't want to talk to people then they put this stuff out and that's it they're just leaving it at that but on top of all this

240
00:16:59,854 --> 00:17:12,579
[SPEAKER_03]: So, first off, the whole game sharing thing with your family and stuff, don't assume for one second that they're not going to expect each one of those people to have live, you know, a paid subscription to live in order for that to happen.

241
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:17,581
[SPEAKER_03]: So why am I having to pay money for this console, pay money for live?

242
00:17:18,581 --> 00:17:35,070
[SPEAKER_03]: and like it's like I have to pay for the privilege to be like fucked over because you want to start you're feeling greedy or something that you feel like we're just not giving you enough money I also just don't like the fact that the Xbox has to talk to the servers once every 24 hours because you know

243
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:38,332
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that I have a problem with it in theory or on paper.

244
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:40,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, I play a lot of MMOs.

245
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:42,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course those talk to the servers.

246
00:17:43,114 --> 00:17:49,898
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not so much caring about it in principle, but the reality is what's going to happen when those servers go down?

247
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:51,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they will go down.

248
00:17:51,499 --> 00:17:53,420
[SPEAKER_04]: And history has shown that this is what happens.

249
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,142
[SPEAKER_04]: PlayStation Network down for months due to a hack attack.

250
00:17:57,502 --> 00:18:02,665
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't think there's kiddies out there that want to hack this new network the minute it goes up because they're angry too?

251
00:18:03,545 --> 00:18:04,506
[SPEAKER_04]: What happens then?

252
00:18:27,048 --> 00:18:29,029
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not going to be able to convince me otherwise.

253
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:33,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Because history has shown it will go down and what is going to happen.

254
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:34,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Wank.

255
00:18:34,934 --> 00:18:42,919
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no server on the face of the earth that has not gone down for any period of time.

256
00:18:42,979 --> 00:18:50,945
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know they're saying that it's going to have a ton of servers or virtual servers or whatever, but they're going to have to perform maintenance on these things.

257
00:18:51,065 --> 00:18:54,327
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got to go down for maintenance for a certain amount of time.

258
00:18:54,848 --> 00:18:54,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

259
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,763
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's just... It's gonna lock people out at some point.

260
00:18:58,823 --> 00:19:00,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we go back to PlayStation 4, though?

261
00:19:00,565 --> 00:19:06,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I do think there's a distinct possibility at least some of this is gonna be true about Sony's system as well.

262
00:19:06,932 --> 00:19:07,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

263
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:09,655
[SPEAKER_04]: And to which parts, not sure.

264
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:13,400
[SPEAKER_04]: But it seems like maybe the game registration, especially... And you told me before the show...

265
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,120
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.

266
00:19:31,659 --> 00:19:39,422
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they wouldn't have gone all in if they didn't know that it was a guarantee from both console manufacturers.

267
00:19:40,162 --> 00:19:46,344
[SPEAKER_03]: And honestly, we have to see how similar it is.

268
00:19:46,404 --> 00:19:53,466
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's very similar, there's some serious antitrust concerns there because these guys just sit down and make...

269
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:55,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Decide, hey, we're going to do this.

270
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:58,155
[SPEAKER_03]: This is how we're going to do this system.

271
00:19:58,195 --> 00:19:59,537
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to both be on board.

272
00:19:59,557 --> 00:20:02,563
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to both benefit from it because they're going to have no choice.

273
00:20:03,044 --> 00:20:05,168
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get rid of options for them.

274
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:22,446
[SPEAKER_03]: I... Like, you know, even though there's all this negative information, I have to wait until when the consoles come out before I can make my decision, because they could very well, hopefully, you know, say, fuck you guys, you know... Seriously, to EA, okay, what are they gonna do?

275
00:20:22,867 --> 00:20:24,949
[SPEAKER_03]: They gotta kind of get some balls here, because...

276
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:27,112
[SPEAKER_03]: What's Microsoft gonna do?

277
00:20:27,432 --> 00:20:28,914
[SPEAKER_03]: They can say, fuck you, EA.

278
00:20:29,716 --> 00:20:30,196
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you gonna do?

279
00:20:30,277 --> 00:20:31,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Not publish games on our console?

280
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:34,222
[SPEAKER_03]: And if Microsoft and Sony does that, what are they gonna do?

281
00:20:34,323 --> 00:20:35,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Publish PC only?

282
00:20:35,564 --> 00:20:37,047
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're not.

283
00:20:37,087 --> 00:20:40,071
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to kind of agree on some sort of partnership here.

284
00:20:40,592 --> 00:20:40,973
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just...

285
00:20:42,914 --> 00:20:49,155
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if Sony, let's just say in a perfect world, Sony would say, okay, listen, we're not going to put up with this bullshit.

286
00:20:49,175 --> 00:20:52,076
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just going to keep things kind of the way they are right now.

287
00:20:52,676 --> 00:20:54,996
[SPEAKER_03]: And they could totally have this in the bag easy.

288
00:20:55,677 --> 00:21:01,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Easy this generation could come out on top and just totally rule everything.

289
00:21:01,118 --> 00:21:03,198
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have a feeling that's not the case.

290
00:21:03,238 --> 00:21:08,879
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think Microsoft would take a risk like that without knowing that both parties are going to do that.

291
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:23,860
[SPEAKER_04]: but yet you know there's going to be some little differences in policy because for instance we heard last week about how Sony is mandating that there be off screen play or whatever for PlayStation Vita so there are going to be little twists in the rules so maybe

292
00:21:25,322 --> 00:21:30,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe Microsoft implemented, just theorizing, tinfoil hat here.

293
00:21:30,423 --> 00:21:39,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe Microsoft invented the whole game sharing, Amazon Kindle thing to try and put a little positive in a negative that they agreed to with Sony.

294
00:21:39,825 --> 00:21:41,166
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe Sony's not going to have that.

295
00:21:41,206 --> 00:21:43,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe Sony's only got the negative.

296
00:21:43,466 --> 00:21:45,627
[SPEAKER_04]: And their positive is the PlayStation Vita Play.

297
00:21:45,647 --> 00:21:46,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think there might be some of that?

298
00:21:47,267 --> 00:21:48,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

299
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:29,487
[SPEAKER_03]: but so what you can do that anyways just you know you loan your games to your friends if you really want to I just don't I don't want to like just say well at least they have this okay well that's good but no they're taking away all this stuff from us I'm sorry I'll just stick with what I've got right now and if I have to I'll just go PC because at least there there's flexibility with I know I know there's DRM with Steam but

300
00:22:30,047 --> 00:22:31,767
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also mods with Steam.

301
00:22:32,008 --> 00:22:33,768
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also all sorts of customization.

302
00:22:33,808 --> 00:22:34,668
[SPEAKER_03]: There's indie games.

303
00:22:35,168 --> 00:22:38,029
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just insane sales on stuff.

304
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:44,810
[SPEAKER_04]: I can honestly say, yes, I use Steam, but I really think I maybe ever bought one game.

305
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:51,232
[SPEAKER_04]: One game in the years I've owned Steam, I've bought one game full retail price, and that would have been Civ V. You know what?

306
00:22:51,432 --> 00:22:52,252
[SPEAKER_04]: A PC-only game.

307
00:22:52,614 --> 00:22:53,134
[SPEAKER_10]: I never have.

308
00:22:54,395 --> 00:22:58,959
[SPEAKER_10]: And even when I could have gotten... Yeah, the stupid Origin bullshit.

309
00:22:59,339 --> 00:23:01,801
[SPEAKER_10]: But when I bought Mass Effect 3, for example.

310
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:07,845
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I bought it new, but I went and price matched somewhere so I didn't pay full price for it and didn't go through Origin.

311
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:08,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

312
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:14,230
[SPEAKER_04]: If Microsoft were to announce at the end of their press conference, by the way, we're going to be lowering the price of games from $60 to $30.

313
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:14,290
[SPEAKER_04]: I...

314
00:23:16,872 --> 00:23:17,212
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in.

315
00:23:17,352 --> 00:23:17,933
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm back in.

316
00:23:18,133 --> 00:23:23,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if that's the plus, that the games are now going to cost half as much, you know, so okay.

317
00:23:23,515 --> 00:23:25,356
[SPEAKER_10]: They have to have an incentive to make people win.

318
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:26,656
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be back in in a heartbeat.

319
00:23:26,917 --> 00:23:27,597
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to happen.

320
00:23:27,777 --> 00:23:28,617
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to happen.

321
00:23:28,637 --> 00:23:30,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Because here's what it is.

322
00:23:30,978 --> 00:23:36,261
[SPEAKER_03]: You think that you're going to get better prices because now they're getting rid of the used market, so to speak.

323
00:23:37,021 --> 00:23:41,343
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to happen because on PC you have multiple storefronts that are competing with each other.

324
00:23:41,403 --> 00:23:45,685
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it may be all Steam DRM and stuff, but they're having sales all across the board.

325
00:23:46,045 --> 00:23:58,270
[SPEAKER_03]: With Microsoft going this route, not only are you going to be limited where you can trade your game in, so right there you're not going to get a really good deal as far as trading value goes because hey, where else are you going to go?

326
00:23:58,690 --> 00:23:59,810
[SPEAKER_03]: We're your only option.

327
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:02,551
[SPEAKER_03]: So your trading value is going to fucking suck to begin with.

328
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:05,813
[SPEAKER_03]: And on top of that, you think they're really going to mark down prices of games?

329
00:24:06,093 --> 00:24:06,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell,

330
00:24:06,553 --> 00:24:13,377
[SPEAKER_03]: There's games on their Xbox games on demand service right now that are still way above what you can actually get them in a disk space format.

331
00:24:13,417 --> 00:24:16,159
[SPEAKER_03]: So, no, you're kidding yourself.

332
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:18,301
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple great comments in our chat room I want to get to.

333
00:24:18,761 --> 00:24:26,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Ahamkara in our chat says, I noticed Japan is not porting some of their best games out of the country, offer good games to themselves for cheap or free, and don't seem to care.

334
00:24:26,986 --> 00:24:32,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Funny how Microsoft is giving them the finger now by focusing on TV for Xbox One and not caring about Japan as well.

335
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:36,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, we've all kind of sat here going, well, clearly Microsoft's written off Japan.

336
00:24:37,095 --> 00:24:42,962
[SPEAKER_04]: But if Sony were to adopt these similar measures, how would that impact Japanese gaming culture?

337
00:24:43,122 --> 00:24:45,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Are Japanese gamers... I mean, I honestly don't know.

338
00:24:46,746 --> 00:24:49,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Are Japanese gamers as willing to buy into all this?

339
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:51,552
[SPEAKER_04]: I think... Go ahead.

340
00:24:52,176 --> 00:25:11,667
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that it's not necessarily going to work because from what I've seen, and of course we need somebody who lives there to confirm this, there's a big culture around having collectibles being one of the campers to get the game the first day, like the big lines around the Capcom store for whenever a Monster Hunter game comes out.

341
00:25:12,367 --> 00:25:13,968
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a different type of culture.

342
00:25:14,349 --> 00:25:29,862
[SPEAKER_10]: We may have a few people standing in line for a new system release or for having maybe one super special game, like the Madden ones, but it's nowhere near the crazy levels that it happens in Japan.

343
00:25:30,042 --> 00:25:30,222
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

344
00:25:30,622 --> 00:25:36,345
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, and then, like, for example, I mean, I keep bringing up my stupid Cardcaptor Sakura Dreamcast game.

345
00:25:36,885 --> 00:25:40,487
[SPEAKER_10]: It had a pillow, pillowcase, and a clock, and a fork, and a spoon.

346
00:25:40,507 --> 00:25:40,867
[SPEAKER_10]: And a dish.

347
00:25:41,147 --> 00:25:42,167
[SPEAKER_10]: And a dish, yes.

348
00:25:42,868 --> 00:25:47,650
[SPEAKER_10]: But, I mean, and there was a Sakura Taisen game that came out in the same type of bundle.

349
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:52,752
[SPEAKER_10]: But, I mean, there's lots of crazy-ass special editions that come out, and people like their packaging.

350
00:25:52,992 --> 00:25:58,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Akuma JP like clockwork shows up in chat when you said we need somebody from Japan to be listening, but he just turned the station on.

351
00:25:59,134 --> 00:26:03,515
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about the Microsoft Xbox One DRM restrictions.

352
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:07,076
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just kind of wondering if Sony's going down that same route.

353
00:26:07,756 --> 00:26:10,037
[SPEAKER_04]: How does that impact Japanese gaming culture?

354
00:26:10,057 --> 00:26:12,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Are the Japanese going to be as willing to buy into some of these restrictions?

355
00:26:12,898 --> 00:26:14,821
[SPEAKER_10]: I still think there's going to be physical packaging.

356
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:19,006
[SPEAKER_10]: There's still going to be copies you can buy and sell.

357
00:26:19,647 --> 00:26:25,675
[SPEAKER_10]: Because there's a big part of the economy around that and there's a big part of the culture around that.

358
00:26:26,076 --> 00:26:30,662
[SPEAKER_10]: You even see a few people over here who like to get their import special editions and everything.

359
00:26:31,107 --> 00:26:39,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, one more comment I want to get here from chat, and then I do kind of want to move on with the show, because we have a lot of news to cover in this pre-E3 week, and I know we're going to get back to this topic during phone calls tonight.

360
00:26:40,311 --> 00:26:49,855
[SPEAKER_04]: But I want to get this comment here from Koopa Kid Jeremy says, Thankfully, Nintendo isn't smart enough with online to even be able to implement these types of features.

361
00:26:50,236 --> 00:26:57,339
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, this is something I've kind of referenced in past episodes on the show when we were all worried about this, is that could Nintendo end up as the...

362
00:26:58,399 --> 00:27:26,224
[SPEAKER_04]: right now they're the dog in the corner chasing its tail looking a little silly and everybody's like what a weird dog but now all of a sudden it's like it's the most attractive puppy in the room and everybody might want to adopt it has Nintendo's failure to embrace online which granted probably is what drove EA does that suddenly make them the most attractive option to Japanese gamers to people like me that feel like I'm out I don't want all these

363
00:27:26,724 --> 00:27:27,704
[SPEAKER_04]: and Draconia Measures.

364
00:27:28,004 --> 00:27:39,648
[SPEAKER_10]: Honestly, I would... If they put an Xbox... Actually, as I've been calling it, the Xbox in front of me versus a Wii U, giving me money and said, pick one to buy.

365
00:27:40,208 --> 00:27:41,108
[SPEAKER_10]: You can buy one.

366
00:27:41,808 --> 00:27:42,649
[SPEAKER_10]: I would go for the Wii U.

367
00:27:43,849 --> 00:27:44,931
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

368
00:28:00,074 --> 00:28:00,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, do you have a thought?

369
00:28:00,815 --> 00:28:02,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Because then I'm going to ask Jamie a very tough question.

370
00:28:02,937 --> 00:28:03,998
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Lord.

371
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:11,285
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I still don't want a Wii U. And the reason it goes back to the original reason why I don't want a Wii U is because there's nothing I want to play on it.

372
00:28:11,405 --> 00:28:13,867
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't really consider it a next-gen console.

373
00:28:14,247 --> 00:28:21,775
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, honestly, the stuff you're going to see on the Wii U, especially coming out of new games, is stuff that's going to be ported to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 already.

374
00:28:22,455 --> 00:28:26,257
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't need to buy another console for games that I can play on my console that I already have.

375
00:28:26,658 --> 00:28:48,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the only advantage I see, and it's been kind of, I've been thinking about it more because my wife has been really hogging the TV, is that off-screen, or the, you know, second screenplay stuff is kind of cool, because I do want to play console games a lot of times, and my wife wants to watch TV, so, you know, that is the only positive, but once again, it's, I don't want to buy a new console just for that, because I have my laptop, I can play on my laptop if I'm really willing to, so...

376
00:28:51,753 --> 00:28:54,635
[SPEAKER_03]: No one's holding a gun to my head to force me to buy a new console.

377
00:28:54,695 --> 00:28:55,435
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have to.

378
00:28:56,236 --> 00:29:07,203
[SPEAKER_03]: If that's the thought process that they're going in with it, saying, well, that's why EA can get rid of their online passes because, hey, they've got to buy another console at some point.

379
00:29:07,924 --> 00:29:08,404
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't.

380
00:29:08,584 --> 00:29:09,805
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have to do anything.

381
00:29:10,405 --> 00:29:10,866
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the thing.

382
00:29:10,926 --> 00:29:12,608
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have to follow what you want me to do.

383
00:29:13,049 --> 00:29:23,122
[SPEAKER_03]: And don't think for one second that no one's going to figure out a way to put some sort of device in between your console and the internet to fucking spoof that authentication server.

384
00:29:23,142 --> 00:29:24,764
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of think that's what's going to happen too.

385
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:25,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Hackers going to hack, right?

386
00:29:26,118 --> 00:29:47,781
[SPEAKER_04]: it's gonna happen they will and this will be a focus uh YYR in chat says all these draconian restrictions aren't going to send most gamers to aren't going to send most gamers to Wii U the Nintendo fans will already buy one and everyone else will just not buy a console I think if anything I think people will still buy a next gen console even though they hate everything because they're like well I gotta play Killer Instinct or I gotta play whatever

387
00:29:48,382 --> 00:29:50,524
[SPEAKER_04]: I always try to gauge this.

388
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:57,992
[SPEAKER_04]: In the years I've been doing this show and the commentary and everything, I find that the best insight comes from non-gamers, truly.

389
00:29:58,512 --> 00:30:05,139
[SPEAKER_04]: If I want to really get a feel for where America's head is really at, I'm not going to look for it on Twitter.

390
00:30:05,499 --> 00:30:10,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, guys, I'm not going to look for it with you because we're a very unique, smaller sort of subset fan base.

391
00:30:11,065 --> 00:30:14,826
[SPEAKER_04]: and I look to general people, people that don't consider themselves gamers.

392
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:21,348
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, this week I was on a work trip in Phoenix and I was with a couple co-workers and the subject of video games came up just randomly.

393
00:30:21,388 --> 00:30:30,150
[SPEAKER_04]: I think somebody had asked about my podcast and I was talking about it kind of casually and he mentioned, yeah, oh yeah, I really like Assassin's Creed and yeah, I heard about that Xbox One but...

394
00:30:31,805 --> 00:30:33,547
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard it's not going to play any of the used stuff.

395
00:30:33,587 --> 00:30:34,507
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I want to get one.

396
00:30:34,547 --> 00:30:35,708
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like it's too restrictive.

397
00:30:36,349 --> 00:30:46,616
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm kind of just thinking in the back of my head, I'm like, I wonder if there's a lot of people that when they just kind of hear what a friend of a friend says to them, they're going to run with that.

398
00:30:46,736 --> 00:30:47,237
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

399
00:30:48,017 --> 00:30:49,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Gamers will buy the console.

400
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:52,200
[SPEAKER_04]: There'll be something on it.

401
00:30:52,221 --> 00:30:54,802
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be PlayStation 4s that sell.

402
00:30:54,822 --> 00:30:56,123
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be Xbox Ones that sell.

403
00:30:56,424 --> 00:30:58,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Will they sell more than Wii U?

404
00:30:58,065 --> 00:30:58,105
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

405
00:31:00,363 --> 00:31:00,904
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

406
00:31:01,224 --> 00:31:15,213
[SPEAKER_03]: You know the best time to buy an Xbox One is going to be the end of the generation when they do eventually shut down those authentication servers and let's assume that they go the Steam route and they unlock it so that you don't have to call in every 24 hours.

407
00:31:15,593 --> 00:31:16,153
[SPEAKER_03]: It just works.

408
00:31:16,473 --> 00:31:19,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Or they can be fucking dicks and say, well, fuck, none of your shit is going to work now.

409
00:31:20,956 --> 00:31:23,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me ask Jamie the difficult question, then we'll move into our gaming week.

410
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:24,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

411
00:31:24,661 --> 00:31:24,941
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

412
00:31:25,082 --> 00:31:26,884
[SPEAKER_04]: And I open this up to the chatters as well.

413
00:31:27,645 --> 00:31:33,973
[SPEAKER_04]: For the 11 years this month that we've been doing Orange Lounge Radio, we've always had a mantra on this show.

414
00:31:34,053 --> 00:31:34,374
[SPEAKER_04]: 11 years.

415
00:31:34,514 --> 00:31:36,937
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're actually having a show on June 23rd this year, which is the birthday.

416
00:31:36,977 --> 00:31:37,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, wow.

417
00:31:37,958 --> 00:31:39,139
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

418
00:31:52,975 --> 00:31:58,756
[SPEAKER_04]: but Microsoft's about to unveil 15 exclusives which might include some of the things we've been clamoring for for a long time.

419
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:02,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Killer Instinct, perhaps that Banjo-Kazooie thing.

420
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:02,637
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

421
00:32:02,917 --> 00:32:04,697
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to fanboy wank here.

422
00:32:05,397 --> 00:32:13,019
[SPEAKER_04]: But now because of all these things that the system is doing, I'm coming back to question, is that mantra still true?

423
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:19,980
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we may have to evolve it.

424
00:32:22,791 --> 00:32:27,194
[SPEAKER_10]: because we've got a system now that's doing things that systems didn't do in the past.

425
00:32:27,854 --> 00:32:33,918
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a new restriction being placed on how they're trying to change how the system works.

426
00:32:35,499 --> 00:32:43,584
[SPEAKER_10]: And so with that, I believe, I'm trying to think of how to phrase this.

427
00:32:43,764 --> 00:32:50,288
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that the games themselves should speak for themselves, but they have to be made accessible.

428
00:32:51,198 --> 00:32:54,121
[SPEAKER_10]: If you don't have access to the game, it does you no good.

429
00:32:56,062 --> 00:33:03,829
[SPEAKER_10]: If it's not going to give you a way to play the game that's... I hope I'm making sense of this.

430
00:33:04,169 --> 00:33:05,691
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a tough question I just unloaded on you.

431
00:33:05,731 --> 00:33:06,631
[SPEAKER_10]: It's tough to phrase.

432
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:11,896
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just kind of feel like the golden rule of gaming may finally have shown a blemish this week.

433
00:33:14,486 --> 00:33:21,095
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that to be able to appreciate the game being on the system, you have to have a system that's going to allow you to enjoy it.

434
00:33:21,695 --> 00:33:22,416
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that make sense?

435
00:33:22,577 --> 00:33:22,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

436
00:33:22,797 --> 00:33:24,779
[SPEAKER_10]: It has to work.

437
00:33:26,894 --> 00:33:31,135
[SPEAKER_04]: It has to, like, for the Nintendo, you put the cartridge in the system and you know it's gonna work.

438
00:33:31,195 --> 00:33:34,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if you blow on the cartridge a hundred times, you know, it has to just work, right?

439
00:33:34,236 --> 00:33:36,737
[SPEAKER_04]: But now we're calling into question, is this really gonna work?

440
00:33:37,037 --> 00:33:40,158
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to quote Queen Semia, sprinkles on a turd don't make it any more tasty.

441
00:33:40,178 --> 00:33:44,559
[SPEAKER_10]: Because actually, that's pretty much how it is.

442
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,260
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that...

443
00:33:48,782 --> 00:33:49,683
[SPEAKER_10]: Ugh, God, it's hard for me to say.

444
00:33:49,703 --> 00:33:49,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

445
00:33:50,243 --> 00:33:52,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me try this from ClericalEra404 in chat.

446
00:33:53,727 --> 00:34:04,858
[SPEAKER_04]: At live.vognetwork.com, ClericalEra404 says, I think the mantra needs to evolve in that it needs to have the games, but also the versatility, the more games that are accessible by more people and potential players.

447
00:34:05,538 --> 00:34:06,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Power to the players, right?

448
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:07,520
[SPEAKER_10]: Agreed.

449
00:34:09,022 --> 00:34:09,803
[SPEAKER_10]: The evil G there.

450
00:34:10,664 --> 00:34:10,784
[SPEAKER_10]: But...

451
00:34:11,744 --> 00:34:25,332
[SPEAKER_10]: here's really where my thought is on this one and I hope this makes sense because I've been trying to the thoughts clear in my head but it's kind of hard to bring into words a system is only as good as the games that are accessible on it

452
00:34:26,417 --> 00:34:26,697
[SPEAKER_10]: Preach.

453
00:34:27,278 --> 00:34:27,518
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

454
00:34:28,098 --> 00:34:29,719
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm using an example here.

455
00:34:29,799 --> 00:34:33,902
[SPEAKER_10]: Back in the day, I'm going to use Symphony of the Night for Saturn and for PlayStation.

456
00:34:34,443 --> 00:34:35,143
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I've got them both.

457
00:34:35,924 --> 00:34:37,145
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the Saturn version better.

458
00:34:38,225 --> 00:34:41,067
[SPEAKER_10]: It was accessible to me at the time because I could import it.

459
00:34:42,508 --> 00:34:51,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Other people, but say that I had no means of importing the game and all I had was a $20 copy that I bought used at GameStop because you could buy them used at GameStop.

460
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:57,704
[SPEAKER_10]: Well then I would say, well of course I like the PlayStation version because I haven't been able to play it on the Saturn.

461
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:59,245
[SPEAKER_10]: I have no basis of comparison.

462
00:34:59,886 --> 00:35:04,390
[SPEAKER_10]: So say that you've got this system here that you don't want to...

463
00:35:05,912 --> 00:35:09,175
[SPEAKER_10]: Invest in because of its practices around the game.

464
00:35:09,435 --> 00:35:18,103
[SPEAKER_10]: Say the PS4 comes out and it's fully open and everything's nice and lovely and the same games come out for it, you're still going to go with the one that's more accessible to you because that's what you have.

465
00:35:18,143 --> 00:35:19,564
[SPEAKER_10]: You have no basis of comparison.

466
00:35:19,944 --> 00:35:23,748
[SPEAKER_10]: Saying X version is better isn't necessarily fair because you can't compare it.

467
00:35:23,848 --> 00:35:30,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the reason why I tend to buy games on the PlayStation 3 over the Xbox 360 for the mere simple fact that I like the controller better?

468
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:35,748
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's really the same thing.

469
00:35:35,889 --> 00:35:36,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Not always.

470
00:35:37,591 --> 00:35:42,920
[SPEAKER_04]: But then I go, if I want to play the game online with friends, I go to the 360 because it's got the better network.

471
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,743
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, ClericalEra404.

472
00:35:44,763 --> 00:35:48,429
[SPEAKER_10]: As said, I loves you for preferring the Saturn version.

473
00:35:48,857 --> 00:35:51,378
[SPEAKER_10]: Just because I really like playing as Maria, okay?

474
00:35:51,638 --> 00:35:52,179
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, all right.

475
00:35:52,239 --> 00:36:04,045
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyway, the whole point is that the games being good to play is also determined by the other factors that go into actually playing the game itself, like for you, the controller.

476
00:36:04,545 --> 00:36:10,070
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, for me, I love playing Saturn games because the dual analog controller does not hurt my hand, even to this day.

477
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:18,476
[SPEAKER_10]: But playing, like, I'm better with RPG, like, I like playing RPGs better now because I get to move my hand.

478
00:36:18,516 --> 00:36:23,581
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have to keep moving my thumb around and, you know, pulling at my scar on my hand.

479
00:36:24,461 --> 00:36:25,461
[SPEAKER_10]: All the scar tissue I've got.

480
00:36:25,561 --> 00:36:31,183
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's really going to be a matter of how you play it as well as the content itself.

481
00:36:31,663 --> 00:36:35,884
[SPEAKER_10]: And if it's not allowing you to access that content, then why bother?

482
00:36:36,765 --> 00:36:37,065
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

483
00:36:37,365 --> 00:36:38,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's a complex issue.

484
00:36:38,665 --> 00:36:41,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Any quick last words, Loki, you want to get in before we move on here?

485
00:36:42,984 --> 00:36:57,895
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's just, I'm just disappointed that this news came out now and not after, because I wish I could be a little bit excited about what Microsoft's showing, but once again... You sound like a tweet I made earlier this week that every year I'm so excited about E3 and like, yay, new games, yay.

486
00:36:58,335 --> 00:37:01,277
[SPEAKER_04]: This year, I really have a sense of dread about E3.

487
00:37:01,437 --> 00:37:04,239
[SPEAKER_04]: This year, it's about, how am I getting fucked over this year?

488
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:09,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, and I'm sorry to sound like that jaded gamershateeverything.com guy, but...

489
00:37:10,143 --> 00:37:12,687
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not gonna lie to you, that's where I'm at right now.

490
00:37:13,308 --> 00:37:18,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether I'm overreacting or not, it's a lot of money.

491
00:37:18,355 --> 00:37:23,223
[SPEAKER_04]: You're asking me to drop on a console where it's not even really my console.

492
00:37:26,747 --> 00:37:30,729
[SPEAKER_04]: At some point, I've got to put my foot down and say, I love video games, but no, I'm done.

493
00:37:30,809 --> 00:37:31,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's another question, too.

494
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:36,613
[SPEAKER_03]: How are they even going to enable this with the first sale doctrine and stuff?

495
00:37:38,374 --> 00:37:41,976
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't know if they're going to say, well, you're licensing stuff from us now.

496
00:37:43,076 --> 00:37:46,558
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if they're going to be able to.

497
00:37:46,919 --> 00:37:52,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Considering how sue-happy everything is, I think we could very well see that this is going to be a lawsuit within a year or so.

498
00:37:52,822 --> 00:37:55,024
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot to make my analogy, so I'll make it quick.

499
00:37:55,184 --> 00:37:55,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I thought you did.

500
00:37:56,105 --> 00:37:56,705
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I didn't.

501
00:37:57,105 --> 00:37:58,346
[SPEAKER_04]: I make a lot of crazy analogies.

502
00:37:58,386 --> 00:37:59,868
[SPEAKER_04]: There was one I was sitting on all week.

503
00:38:00,348 --> 00:38:01,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Who remembers DivX?

504
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:03,310
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my God.

505
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:05,032
[SPEAKER_10]: When they had the DivX players?

506
00:38:05,052 --> 00:38:08,614
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not talking about the codec on your computer that lets you watch movies and things like that.

507
00:38:08,654 --> 00:38:11,357
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about when there was actually a DivX player at Circuit City.

508
00:38:11,917 --> 00:38:19,483
[SPEAKER_04]: But it always had to be connected online because you could rent the movies at the store and the thing ended up flopping.

509
00:38:19,723 --> 00:38:20,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did the DivX flop?

510
00:38:21,906 --> 00:38:23,167
[SPEAKER_10]: because of all the restrictions on it.

511
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:24,708
[SPEAKER_03]: There weren't any games on it.

512
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:28,031
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there weren't any movies for it.

513
00:38:28,071 --> 00:38:30,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there was the same movies that were on DVD and Laserdisc.

514
00:38:31,294 --> 00:38:35,317
[SPEAKER_10]: And for the people who don't know what DivX is, just think of the little mascot from Penny Arcade.

515
00:38:35,737 --> 00:38:37,519
[SPEAKER_10]: They have that little DivX player character.

516
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,340
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a DivX machine.

517
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:44,124
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sorry, but right now what I'm hearing out of Xbox One sounds very DivX to me.

518
00:38:45,225 --> 00:38:48,748
[SPEAKER_04]: People rejected DivX because they wanted to own their shit.

519
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:56,292
[SPEAKER_04]: And they didn't want to have to keep dialing this server that was Daddy Steven Spielberg, who was a co-owner in this.

520
00:38:56,532 --> 00:38:58,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Daddy Steven Spielberg, may I watch this movie?

521
00:38:59,193 --> 00:38:59,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Mm-hmm.

522
00:39:02,154 --> 00:39:05,015
[SPEAKER_10]: People want to have control in the end.

523
00:39:05,295 --> 00:39:05,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

524
00:39:05,695 --> 00:39:06,535
[SPEAKER_04]: GameGuru in chat.

525
00:39:06,575 --> 00:39:08,636
[SPEAKER_04]: DivX, the disc player that killed Circuit City.

526
00:39:08,796 --> 00:39:09,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

527
00:39:09,697 --> 00:39:11,777
[SPEAKER_04]: It brought down an entire chain with it.

528
00:39:11,837 --> 00:39:15,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't think that the DivX didn't have a lasting negative impact on Circuit City.

529
00:39:16,019 --> 00:39:18,860
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, and also keep in mind, there...

530
00:39:20,956 --> 00:39:22,257
[SPEAKER_10]: I just completely lost my train of thought.

531
00:39:22,457 --> 00:39:36,786
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it was the fact that you still have people today that even though we've got iTunes and we have all this digital distribution, there's still people who like to physically go out and buy a disc, who will prefer to buy their music on CD.

532
00:39:36,866 --> 00:39:38,927
[SPEAKER_04]: There's quite a few people in chat agreeing with you, yes.

533
00:39:39,087 --> 00:39:39,287
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

534
00:39:39,708 --> 00:39:41,749
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I'm not necessarily one of them, but...

535
00:39:42,233 --> 00:39:42,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

536
00:39:43,153 --> 00:39:43,373
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

537
00:39:43,634 --> 00:39:45,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of passion behind this topic.

538
00:39:45,194 --> 00:39:48,395
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure we'll hear more about it during our phone call segment later, as well as the mailbag.

539
00:39:48,735 --> 00:39:50,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

540
00:39:51,156 --> 00:39:52,457
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a very interesting E3 week.

541
00:39:52,477 --> 00:39:53,077
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob will answer it.

542
00:39:53,237 --> 00:39:53,597
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm kidding.

543
00:39:54,277 --> 00:39:55,938
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a very interesting E3 week.

544
00:39:55,958 --> 00:39:56,598
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I have to say.

545
00:39:57,438 --> 00:40:03,521
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really looking forward to next week's show when Sony will have to put it out on the table because they didn't cancel their media stuff, right?

546
00:40:03,981 --> 00:40:05,781
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're going to have to answer this question.

547
00:40:06,081 --> 00:40:09,963
[SPEAKER_04]: And finally, we'll have a clearer picture to what things are going to look like come this fall.

548
00:40:10,563 --> 00:40:11,144
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

549
00:40:35,203 --> 00:40:37,244
[SPEAKER_10]: But I had a really good time doing it.

550
00:40:37,264 --> 00:40:42,086
[SPEAKER_10]: And I really liked what it added to the, as I'm calling it, the main timeline lore.

551
00:40:42,646 --> 00:40:43,507
[SPEAKER_10]: It was really good.

552
00:40:43,787 --> 00:40:45,388
[SPEAKER_10]: So I've actually been enjoying that.

553
00:40:45,448 --> 00:40:49,850
[SPEAKER_10]: And they kind of set the skill trees back to how they used to be.

554
00:40:50,550 --> 00:41:00,538
[SPEAKER_10]: Not necessarily exactly the same, and I kind of respect my Vice Admiral incorrectly, but still, they did a lot of really cool stuff.

555
00:41:00,978 --> 00:41:08,744
[SPEAKER_10]: And actually, I'll tell you what was funny, because I was just running around on my Vice Admiral, because I have her pretty much permanently parked at Deep Space Nine.

556
00:41:09,184 --> 00:41:14,368
[SPEAKER_10]: They put Morn in Quark's bar, and like, as a big DS9 fan, that made me stupendously happy.

557
00:41:15,728 --> 00:41:19,709
[SPEAKER_10]: It even had him quote telling a story even though he never talks.

558
00:41:19,749 --> 00:41:23,410
[SPEAKER_10]: It just sort of did a fade out and him shaking his head forlornly and everything.

559
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:24,070
[SPEAKER_10]: It was pretty funny.

560
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:26,250
[SPEAKER_10]: I did start Marvel Heroes.

561
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:27,370
[SPEAKER_10]: I do not care for it.

562
00:41:27,631 --> 00:41:35,232
[SPEAKER_10]: It reminded me a bit of playing Marvel Ultimate Alliance without the fun part of having other people to play with.

563
00:41:36,092 --> 00:41:39,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting because you're the first one I've heard say something negative about it.

564
00:41:40,473 --> 00:41:42,815
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, everybody has their opinion, it's just interesting.

565
00:41:42,935 --> 00:42:04,969
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not saying it wasn't fun, and yeah, it's free to play, but if I wanted another character, I pretty much have to buy 20 bucks worth of points for one character, or if I bought $40 worth of points, that would get me, you know, maybe three characters, and the one that I really wanted to play, she had a sprite for it, but she wasn't accessible to buy, because as I've made no...

566
00:42:06,838 --> 00:42:10,501
[SPEAKER_10]: No secret of this, my favorite Marvel character is Jessica Jones because she's badass.

567
00:42:11,501 --> 00:42:22,829
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyway, I played through the whole first mission as Scarlet Witch and it was just like a not quite as fun version of Marvel Ultimate Alliance and I would rather play Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

568
00:42:23,271 --> 00:42:50,822
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna check I want to check out this Marvel Heroes game I just I was busy this past week so I didn't get a chance to check it out but it wasn't bad I'm gonna say it wasn't bad but it wasn't enough to make me want to spend any amount of money on it I mean I might play it a little bit more I've got Scarlet Witch she's pretty cool I almost picked Hawkeye because you know Hawkeye but I went for her you just wanted to stare at his booty no I'm you know what that's objectification Robin I take exception to that

569
00:42:51,763 --> 00:42:59,598
[SPEAKER_10]: um but uh it was all right it was all right and as a male I am totally okay with the objectification of Hawkeye just saying

570
00:43:00,486 --> 00:43:01,347
[SPEAKER_10]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

571
00:43:25,306 --> 00:43:36,017
[SPEAKER_10]: and then um yes Claire Claire it's because it's Jeremy Renner and I think he's pretty um and intelligent and intelligent um but uh

572
00:43:38,637 --> 00:43:39,158
[SPEAKER_10]: What was I saying?

573
00:43:39,218 --> 00:43:39,838
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

574
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:43,081
[SPEAKER_10]: So I actually, I have a high-res mod.

575
00:43:43,701 --> 00:43:50,966
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's really, you have to sort of manually mod your INI files yourself and then use text mod for the high-resolution textures.

576
00:43:51,807 --> 00:44:03,155
[SPEAKER_10]: And I figured out that why my game kept shutting down is because I didn't have this, there's like a little program you can run to make it accept higher memory usage.

577
00:44:03,175 --> 00:44:03,515
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

578
00:44:03,715 --> 00:44:08,666
[SPEAKER_10]: Which, I mean, I've got a card that, you know, gives me two extra gig of VRAM, so I don't know what's going on.

579
00:44:09,247 --> 00:44:12,835
[SPEAKER_10]: But I ended up getting that working, and...

580
00:44:14,648 --> 00:44:16,749
[SPEAKER_10]: It was pretty good.

581
00:44:17,209 --> 00:44:23,131
[SPEAKER_10]: And I actually, I can tell you this, that I don't get as sick as I did with some of the higher res textures.

582
00:44:24,012 --> 00:44:28,994
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm pretty much just running through the game and trying to get all the stuff I missed.

583
00:44:29,334 --> 00:44:40,238
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm actually also doing a different background than what I used to do, because I always used to do either a colonist or a spacer, but I would always do Soul Survivor, and now I'm doing a war hero, which is...

584
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:41,398
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

585
00:45:08,771 --> 00:45:12,643
[SPEAKER_10]: and um god I was playing something else too and I don't remember what it was

586
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:15,750
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't remember what it was.

587
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:17,071
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll come back to you if you think of it.

588
00:45:17,251 --> 00:45:19,191
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Dan is really irritated with Grid 2.

589
00:45:20,031 --> 00:45:20,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

590
00:45:20,791 --> 00:45:24,492
[SPEAKER_10]: Because he says that the collision detection in that game is just really shit.

591
00:45:24,792 --> 00:45:25,393
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't played it.

592
00:45:25,693 --> 00:45:27,213
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know, he has that driving rig.

593
00:45:27,233 --> 00:45:27,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, I know.

594
00:45:27,913 --> 00:45:29,473
[SPEAKER_04]: He loves his driving rig.

595
00:45:29,754 --> 00:45:30,414
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a manly man.

596
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:31,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

597
00:45:31,294 --> 00:45:32,714
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?

598
00:45:33,534 --> 00:45:37,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, I did not play, I don't think, anything, actually.

599
00:45:37,895 --> 00:45:38,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

600
00:45:38,816 --> 00:45:40,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's just...

601
00:45:41,983 --> 00:46:06,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Boss has been out all week, so they haven't played any Call of Duty, and I didn't really play anything in the week, I was working on my laptop for most of the week, and then my laptop broke, so then I had to fix my laptop, so I've been busy with that, so yeah, I did buy the Serious Sam bundle thing that they have on the Humble Bundle Weekly thing, so that's kind of cool, so hopefully I'll play some of that soon, and just watch the Watch Dogs trailer for E3, the E3 trailer in

602
00:46:07,728 --> 00:46:08,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks fantastic.

603
00:46:08,669 --> 00:46:09,450
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait for that game.

604
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:11,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Did that just release tonight?

605
00:46:12,313 --> 00:46:12,933
[SPEAKER_03]: It leaked out, yeah.

606
00:46:14,763 --> 00:46:15,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else?

607
00:46:16,684 --> 00:46:17,664
[SPEAKER_04]: That is it.

608
00:46:18,404 --> 00:46:20,024
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm only really going to talk about one new game.

609
00:46:20,765 --> 00:46:28,347
[SPEAKER_04]: I was in Phoenix for a lot of the week for the day job, so that kind of kept me away from most of my games besides iPad and portable games.

610
00:46:28,707 --> 00:46:29,927
[SPEAKER_04]: I've talked a lot about on the show.

611
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,448
[SPEAKER_04]: My random game to play on the airplane.

612
00:46:32,628 --> 00:46:38,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank heavens for the Game Boy Advance games and the NES games and all that on the 3DS for the early adopters.

613
00:46:38,689 --> 00:46:40,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Mario Kart Game Boy Advance.

614
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:49,333
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why, it actually is one of the weaker Mario Kart games, just control wise and everything, but I was like, I want to unlock the special cup, so I did it.

615
00:46:49,774 --> 00:46:55,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, the real game I've been playing a bit of at least the past couple days is Animal Crossing New Leaf.

616
00:46:55,956 --> 00:46:59,718
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the 3D version of Animal Crossing that just came out.

617
00:47:00,758 --> 00:47:01,358
[SPEAKER_04]: What can I say?

618
00:47:01,518 --> 00:47:02,519
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Animal Crossing.

619
00:47:02,939 --> 00:47:07,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the differences, though, I noticed that they put a lot of the stores that used to be sprinkled throughout your town.

620
00:47:08,322 --> 00:47:22,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really the mall thing like the Wii did, but there's other side of the tracks now, like a Main Street, where all the Nooks, the Able Sisters, Tom Nook, who's now the realtor because he gave the convenience store to his kids.

621
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:45,764
[SPEAKER_04]: and some other stuff is all that stuff's on the other side of the tracks the museum's there too so it's kind of neat to have kind of everything in that one place that really opens up your town to have a little bit more of your design when it comes to the trees and the flowers and all that all the online experience is pretty much similar to what I noticed in the previous games you open up your train gates and people can come visit in fact I should open mine up and see if anyone comes to visit

622
00:47:46,484 --> 00:48:10,133
[SPEAKER_04]: and then you can close them when you're ready for people to get out so a lot of that hasn't changed but I know they brought the island back and there's a lot more fruits available thanks to the island some of the other things I noticed is that the story is a lot different because now you're the mayor so you have an assistant Isabella who kind of helps you or I'm assuming everybody has the same one I don't even know

623
00:48:10,513 --> 00:48:11,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

624
00:48:27,416 --> 00:48:32,179
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's just kind of fun to grow your little neighborhood and interact with the people.

625
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:35,581
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the online element provides a lot of fun with that.

626
00:48:36,021 --> 00:48:40,964
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's $35 since it's a handheld game, not $60 like a lot of console games cost.

627
00:48:41,284 --> 00:48:42,785
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that's priced pretty good.

628
00:48:42,925 --> 00:48:47,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes you just want to do a little bit of fishing, donate it to the museum, make some bells.

629
00:48:48,188 --> 00:48:48,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

630
00:49:17,563 --> 00:49:17,844
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

631
00:49:29,773 --> 00:49:32,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get into quick housekeeping.

632
00:49:32,997 --> 00:49:38,503
[SPEAKER_04]: I mentioned this earlier in the show, but do keep an eye on this week, e3.vognetwork.com.

633
00:49:39,003 --> 00:49:47,132
[SPEAKER_04]: It is our interactive E3 experience at the Voice of Geeks Network that's going to be led by VOG Network's Bobby Blackwolf, who will be on the show.

634
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:52,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Show Floor at E3 and he will be getting answers to your questions.

635
00:49:53,456 --> 00:50:00,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Because once Bobby's done these appointments and played some of the games, he wants to see what you guys want to hear about.

636
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:12,766
[SPEAKER_04]: But all we ask, don't ask the obvious things that are already in the press releases and don't ask about this stinking Xbox used game thing because we all know they're not going to comment further on it.

637
00:50:13,126 --> 00:50:13,327
[SPEAKER_04]: But

638
00:50:14,187 --> 00:50:14,888
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

639
00:50:32,328 --> 00:51:01,691
[SPEAKER_04]: but you know whatever it is you want to hear more about it uh go take a look at e3.vognetwork.com it has all the information you need question submissions open up after the Sony press conference tomorrow when we're really going to know where things stand okay um we'll hear from Bobby Blackwolf on that a little more later because we are going to have a list list later tonight uh the thing we most want to see happen at E3 2013 that'll be in part b later in the show but first let's run through some gaming news and Loki start us off

640
00:51:02,131 --> 00:51:09,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so there's a rumor going around that GameStop is discontinuing the Wii U Basic after June 18th.

641
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:22,755
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically, the rumor comes from that they've been getting, like there's an internal email saying that they're going to be sending back all the basic units and that kind of stuff.

642
00:51:23,335 --> 00:51:30,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, Nintendo has followed up with this, saying that there's a current misperception about the Wii U hardware.

643
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:40,302
[SPEAKER_03]: To clarify, Nintendo is working with its retail partners to simply rebalance the stock of white 8GB systems and black 32GB Wii U models in the market.

644
00:51:40,342 --> 00:51:43,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Consumers looking for either model will continue to find them available.

645
00:51:44,183 --> 00:51:45,744
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't make any sense to me, but okay.

646
00:51:46,644 --> 00:51:57,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Then, of course, there's a follow-up to that where another retailer was saying that they received an email that they're going to be recalling all the 8GB systems.

647
00:51:58,393 --> 00:52:08,120
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, if anything, this has to do with the fact that they're talking about putting out a white 3GB, 2GB system.

648
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,983
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering if they're just going to get rid of the 8GB system altogether because...

649
00:52:12,583 --> 00:52:13,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that's not as popular.

650
00:52:14,745 --> 00:52:19,848
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a lot of people that buy Wii U's, at least as far as my customers are concerned.

651
00:52:20,909 --> 00:52:21,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's buying the basics?

652
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:22,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a lot of people.

653
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:24,171
[SPEAKER_04]: They want the pack-in game.

654
00:52:24,552 --> 00:52:27,113
[SPEAKER_04]: They want the stuff that comes with the deluxe.

655
00:52:27,133 --> 00:52:29,775
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't blame Nintendo at all if they're phasing the basics out of the market.

656
00:52:29,795 --> 00:52:37,741
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the 18th coincides well with being after E3, so maybe an announcement in the new

657
00:52:37,921 --> 00:52:38,622
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my fingers.

658
00:52:38,922 --> 00:52:45,547
[SPEAKER_04]: My real hope is that they're getting rid of the basics because they're going to drop the price of the deluxes down to where the basics are.

659
00:52:46,127 --> 00:52:47,709
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be phenomenal news.

660
00:52:48,009 --> 00:52:57,756
[SPEAKER_04]: And what a great opportunity for Nintendo to kick their competition in the balls while all this other talk about the usage restrictions and all this is going on.

661
00:52:58,817 --> 00:53:21,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo could really strike them in the jugular and you might still hate everything that Nintendo has to offer but you gotta recognize that there's gonna be a lot of people that are here for Mario Kart and 3D Mario and all this stuff it wouldn't be that hard for them to refurbish all those old systems to pop that 8 gigabyte storage chip off there and put a 3 gigabyte chip there in place so it wouldn't be that hard very well could happen

662
00:53:23,414 --> 00:53:31,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan Alchemy in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, 8 gigabytes is just an embarrassingly insufficient amount of memory by today's standards, period.

663
00:53:31,576 --> 00:53:32,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Budget console or no?

664
00:53:33,957 --> 00:53:34,657
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very true.

665
00:53:34,697 --> 00:53:35,278
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a lot.

666
00:53:36,178 --> 00:53:38,518
[SPEAKER_04]: So Nintendo's got to catch up.

667
00:53:38,538 --> 00:53:42,179
[SPEAKER_04]: But don't catch up too much to what else is going on in the world.

668
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:49,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on to other news out of E3, Square Enix mentioning what they're going to be showing at their E3 booth.

669
00:53:51,062 --> 00:53:56,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes things get left off of this, but I'll say what there is so far.

670
00:53:56,423 --> 00:54:05,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Kingdom Hearts 1.5 Remix on PlayStation 3, Final Fantasy XIV A Realm Reborn, which makes sense because I believe Beta 3 starts next week.

671
00:54:05,625 --> 00:54:06,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it comes out in August.

672
00:54:06,845 --> 00:54:08,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so they're counting down there.

673
00:54:08,685 --> 00:54:10,886
[SPEAKER_08]: They've also changed restrictions on the beta stuff.

674
00:54:11,046 --> 00:54:12,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, NDA is lifted.

675
00:54:12,926 --> 00:54:16,547
[SPEAKER_10]: But still, you're not allowed to say anything on the previous betas.

676
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:23,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy X and X-2 HD Remaster for the Vita and PlayStation 3 Deus Ex Human Revolution Director's Cut for Wii U

677
00:54:42,076 --> 00:54:45,077
[SPEAKER_04]: and Thief, another big title on its way.

678
00:54:45,517 --> 00:54:49,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, there are rumors that there could be something additional there as well.

679
00:54:50,059 --> 00:54:56,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, the future of Final Fantasy being teased for Tuesday, June 11th, 9 a.m.

680
00:54:57,102 --> 00:54:59,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Rumors and rumblings suggesting it's Final Fantasy XV.

681
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:27,539
[SPEAKER_03]: uh whether that is what 13 versus has been put through a remodel and that's now 15 or maybe this news is just 13 versus no it's gonna be something new for the playstation 4 and the probably the xbox one because remember the playstation 4 of it they showed the same fucking trailer that they had before and they're like and we'll have more to announce 33 you know so it's it's gonna be something new for next gen it's probably gonna be using their new engine that they have

682
00:55:27,739 --> 00:55:31,924
[SPEAKER_04]: It is sad to me though that Dragon Quest X just probably isn't going to happen over here, is it?

683
00:55:32,485 --> 00:55:42,076
[SPEAKER_04]: I was kind of hoping that maybe they would announce that at E3, that maybe they were just going to solely back Wii U. I really wish they would try with Dragon Quest X, but...

684
00:55:43,297 --> 00:55:44,158
[SPEAKER_10]: Dragon Quest 9 Dragon Quest 9

685
00:56:04,793 --> 00:56:05,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, moving on.

686
00:56:05,334 --> 00:56:06,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Quest Swords, that's what it was.

687
00:56:06,595 --> 00:56:08,856
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, this is purely rumor, okay?

688
00:56:08,956 --> 00:56:10,918
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm just going to go ahead and spit it out there.

689
00:56:10,998 --> 00:56:11,899
[SPEAKER_10]: Allegedly stuff.

690
00:56:14,141 --> 00:56:25,029
[SPEAKER_10]: There is a rumor going around that Microsoft has been paying off third-party developers not to show off anything for PlayStation 4 either on stage or at their booths.

691
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:28,392
[SPEAKER_10]: That Microsoft has resorted to paying them off for this.

692
00:56:29,457 --> 00:56:38,597
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, I don't know if this is true or not, but the report came from a source on NeoGAF that's done a lot of true research.

693
00:56:39,707 --> 00:56:43,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Here is your nice big salt lick to go with this.

694
00:56:44,072 --> 00:56:44,592
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

695
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:49,077
[SPEAKER_10]: But it did come from someone who in the past has been reliable.

696
00:56:50,258 --> 00:57:01,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, now this would put weight in the column of maybe Sony isn't in the same camp as Microsoft because otherwise it's, what are you so afraid of, Microsoft?

697
00:57:01,792 --> 00:57:10,696
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the whole point is that the theory is that if this is really what's going on, that Microsoft is trying to give the illusion that they're going to have more games available than the PS4 will.

698
00:57:11,597 --> 00:57:12,837
[SPEAKER_10]: Which would make them look more attractive.

699
00:57:12,877 --> 00:57:17,840
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not that Microsoft and Sony haven't struck at each other financially before.

700
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:18,420
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, what?

701
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:21,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft got a lot of DLC agreements.

702
00:57:22,462 --> 00:57:46,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony got the whole Valve tie-in portal like everybody bought Portal 2 on PlayStation 3 because everything well not everybody but a lot of people did because of you know their agreements with Valve and the Steam integration which was really good I got mine on Steam yeah well you got you bought it it was a gift but still well you bought it on PS3 and you got it on both no I didn't no no I you did but I mean I didn't care about it on PS3 at all I got it on on Windows yeah

703
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:56,262
[SPEAKER_04]: So paying for exclusives and paying off for stuff like that, that's not really... But it's just in light of everything else going on in the gaming industry is what makes a lot of people kind of leech onto this news.

704
00:57:56,342 --> 00:57:58,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

705
00:57:59,123 --> 00:58:07,305
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, and it could just be something that was thrown out there for the purpose of, you know, making Microsoft look bad too.

706
00:58:08,025 --> 00:58:13,947
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time... They don't need a NeoGAF thread to do that.

707
00:58:14,622 --> 00:58:32,992
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know that at this point that I would put anything past past them right now especially since this type of shit goes on all the time in the corporate world so saying but isn't it weird how Microsoft and Sony would have had to agree to this thing and then now they strike at each other in corporate warfare in these other ways it's really it's kind of sick

708
00:58:34,233 --> 00:58:34,874
[SPEAKER_04]: in some ways.

709
00:58:34,894 --> 00:58:35,975
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome to corporate America.

710
00:58:37,357 --> 00:58:38,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the world corporation.

711
00:58:38,678 --> 00:58:39,539
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just America, honey.

712
00:58:39,639 --> 00:58:40,620
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, I know, I know.

713
00:58:41,161 --> 00:58:43,203
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm saying it's business.

714
00:58:43,904 --> 00:58:47,307
[SPEAKER_10]: And in the end, what companies most care about is their bottom line.

715
00:58:48,028 --> 00:58:49,830
[SPEAKER_10]: And they will do what they can to increase it.

716
00:58:51,271 --> 00:58:51,672
[SPEAKER_10]: End of story.

717
00:58:52,433 --> 00:58:52,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

718
00:58:53,783 --> 00:58:58,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so let's see, let's talk a little bit about Plants vs. Zombies.

719
00:58:58,487 --> 00:59:04,011
[SPEAKER_03]: And you may remember they had an announcement for Plants vs. Zombies 2, it's about time.

720
00:59:04,371 --> 00:59:11,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Well now there's some actual banners being spotted at E3 showing Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare.

721
00:59:11,877 --> 00:59:12,457
[SPEAKER_10]: I am excited.

722
00:59:12,898 --> 00:59:19,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is, rumors to be true, I think they were saying that it's a multiplayer first person shooter game.

723
00:59:20,423 --> 00:59:20,744
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

724
00:59:23,675 --> 00:59:24,695
[SPEAKER_10]: I am no longer excited.

725
00:59:25,435 --> 00:59:26,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's still the Plants vs. Zombies 2.

726
00:59:28,016 --> 00:59:30,037
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm excited about that, but first person shooter, no.

727
00:59:30,897 --> 00:59:38,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I remember actually hearing about that before, so it'll be interesting to see what that's like.

728
00:59:38,379 --> 00:59:42,580
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thinking maybe a little bit like that Batman, what was it, the...

729
00:59:45,733 --> 00:59:50,336
[SPEAKER_03]: The Batman game that they had on Xbox Live Arcade.

730
00:59:51,517 --> 00:59:52,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotham Impostor.

731
00:59:53,418 --> 00:59:53,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

732
00:59:54,839 --> 00:59:55,179
[SPEAKER_03]: That one.

733
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:57,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the Gotham Kids or something like that.

734
00:59:57,341 --> 01:00:00,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's like... Somebody in chat will yell it out.

735
01:00:01,003 --> 01:00:03,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't remember.

736
01:00:04,525 --> 01:00:05,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, neat.

737
01:00:05,586 --> 01:00:11,810
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we'll have to hear about it during EA's press conference.

738
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:13,491
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess they're going to have that on Monday, so...

739
01:00:15,114 --> 01:00:16,094
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm watching all of those.

740
01:00:16,114 --> 01:00:17,015
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be fantastic.

741
01:00:17,035 --> 01:00:17,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, me too.

742
01:00:18,035 --> 01:00:20,155
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to hear something kind of funny off topic here a little bit?

743
01:00:20,555 --> 01:00:22,436
[SPEAKER_03]: I was looking on NeoGAF just a second here.

744
01:00:23,536 --> 01:00:27,057
[SPEAKER_03]: They put out a reminder that there was this thing that leaked last year.

745
01:00:27,077 --> 01:00:29,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember about their kind of game plan?

746
01:00:29,278 --> 01:00:29,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

747
01:00:30,158 --> 01:00:37,220
[SPEAKER_03]: And the actual marketing position that they had for 2013 is this one box input one.

748
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:37,280
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

749
01:00:42,601 --> 01:00:43,522
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

750
01:01:05,716 --> 01:01:22,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Akuma JP in our chat room with a very interesting comparison we were talking earlier the whole corporate warfare with Sony and Microsoft Akuma JP in our chat says look at Apple and Samsung that's another good comparison because those two they have to work together for some things but then they're at each other's throats

751
01:01:23,428 --> 01:01:25,069
[SPEAKER_04]: with courts and lawsuits and everything.

752
01:01:25,129 --> 01:01:27,170
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fascinating how that all works.

753
01:01:27,791 --> 01:01:33,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so here's, if you remember that whole thing, the PDF that came out last year.

754
01:01:33,554 --> 01:01:35,695
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's what the next game plan then would be.

755
01:01:37,336 --> 01:01:43,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Fortezella glasses, digital glasses that allow you to see 3D objects in your living room.

756
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:45,701
[SPEAKER_03]: That's augmented reality stuff.

757
01:01:45,901 --> 01:01:49,283
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's going to be next year, apparently, according to their road map.

758
01:01:50,856 --> 01:01:51,837
[SPEAKER_04]: What about the Illumina Room?

759
01:01:52,137 --> 01:01:53,219
[SPEAKER_04]: When's that supposed to be a thing?

760
01:01:53,259 --> 01:01:54,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Next year too, I think.

761
01:01:56,242 --> 01:01:56,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

762
01:01:57,904 --> 01:01:59,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, moving on.

763
01:01:59,505 --> 01:02:10,477
[SPEAKER_04]: I talked earlier in the show about Animal Crossing and I know one reason everybody loved the GameCube version of Animal Crossing and some people arguably say it's their favorite is because it had all the classic NES games in it.

764
01:02:10,797 --> 01:02:16,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember how you could play Punch Out and Clue Clue Land and all these Nintendo games in Animal Crossing?

765
01:02:16,822 --> 01:02:31,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this will probably be a bit of a duh, but in an interview with Katsuya Eguchi, he basically, and this is an interview that he had out there, he said that please consider it's not happening ever again in regards to Virtual Console.

766
01:02:31,793 --> 01:02:36,358
[SPEAKER_04]: At the time of Animal Crossing on the GameCube, we didn't have a virtual console system.

767
01:02:36,758 --> 01:02:40,261
[SPEAKER_04]: We thought that playing games inside of a game is kind of funny, and we wanted to do it.

768
01:02:40,622 --> 01:02:45,887
[SPEAKER_04]: But now there's a virtual console where you can play classic games, so we don't think we'll be doing that in future titles.

769
01:02:46,287 --> 01:02:55,456
[SPEAKER_04]: So, kind of confirmation that, yeah, they're not going to bring those NES games back in the other systems, and it's really virtual console's fault because they can make money selling those games separately.

770
01:02:55,896 --> 01:03:04,938
[SPEAKER_04]: However, part of the reason I wanted to bring this up is because when I was reading this article on Destructoid.com, who ran with this article, I really liked an idea that was proposed.

771
01:03:04,978 --> 01:03:13,921
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wanted to kind of put this out there by the author at Destructoid.com, who said, "...there's more that could be done to appease those looking for retro flavor in a new Animal Crossing adventure.

772
01:03:14,441 --> 01:03:19,262
[SPEAKER_04]: A nice compromise would be to include some special 8-bit Animal Crossing-themed games."

773
01:03:19,702 --> 01:03:21,102
[SPEAKER_04]: in the next entry of the series.

774
01:03:21,963 --> 01:03:27,184
[SPEAKER_04]: In the GameCube title, Tortimer might give you a fake NES game called Super Tortimer on April 1st.

775
01:03:27,584 --> 01:03:29,265
[SPEAKER_04]: What if Super Tortimer were playable?

776
01:03:29,645 --> 01:03:36,587
[SPEAKER_04]: A little 10 minute long platformer starring a turtle mare and maybe a few other fake but fun lo-fi NES on Animal Crossing minigames.

777
01:03:36,947 --> 01:03:38,127
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, I love that idea.

778
01:03:38,327 --> 01:03:39,088
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a fantastic idea.

779
01:03:39,108 --> 01:03:40,208
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a fantastic idea.

780
01:03:40,888 --> 01:03:44,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, just silly little flash games to be collectible.

781
01:03:44,689 --> 01:03:46,110
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that would be a great thing for the series.

782
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:50,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Granted, you know, it's going to be a lot of development costs and somebody's got to design all that.

783
01:03:50,992 --> 01:03:51,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Design it as a contest.

784
01:03:52,032 --> 01:03:53,333
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a bunch of indie devs.

785
01:03:53,353 --> 01:03:55,293
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going to say, crowdsource the fucker.

786
01:03:55,413 --> 01:04:02,016
[SPEAKER_03]: You just have a bunch of indie devs just creating 8-bit shit for it and you could even market that as a reason to buy the game.

787
01:04:02,196 --> 01:04:02,616
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know.

788
01:04:02,656 --> 01:04:05,977
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't see Nintendo as somebody who would crowdsource like that.

789
01:04:05,997 --> 01:04:06,638
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

790
01:04:08,058 --> 01:04:37,271
[SPEAKER_04]: but yeah that would be awesome it's too bad oh you know Nintendo if you're thinking about that Wii U version of Animal Crossing here's a oh oh this could this could really bring a lot of people back or just you know maybe just give us you know those NES games because come on you've already made your money back and then like who the fuck's gonna buy Clue Clue Land let's be real it wasn't that good or Donkey Kong Math or yeah who's gonna buy that shit come on um

791
01:04:38,703 --> 01:04:40,927
[SPEAKER_04]: I have memories of Clu Clu Land, don't judge me

792
01:04:52,183 --> 01:05:17,483
[SPEAKER_04]: YYR in chat says but I do have to buy a third party hack disc to unlock them all this time yeah because remember Super Mario Brothers and Zelda were in the original Animal Crossing but you couldn't get them without a code like they were never actually given out you had to code them to do it or use the link from Hyrule website that was big back in the day where everybody had the same character name so you could just gift yourself all this stuff pretty funny

793
01:05:19,684 --> 01:05:46,014
[SPEAKER_04]: what else do I want to say with that oh here's one other thing I would say is that if they do these whole like little flash games that they put inside Animal Crossing they could almost one up virtual console and like how about little achievements within Animal Crossing and leaderboards within Animal Crossing suddenly Animal Crossing is what we all thought PlayStation Home was going to be think about it womp womp

794
01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:48,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyway.

795
01:05:49,813 --> 01:05:53,757
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, how about something that's a little bit happier, Rob?

796
01:05:54,017 --> 01:05:55,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

797
01:05:55,879 --> 01:05:57,540
[SPEAKER_10]: How about something that has nothing to do with Nintendo?

798
01:05:58,641 --> 01:06:00,423
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that's going to be happier this week.

799
01:06:01,865 --> 01:06:04,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo's kind of my safe room.

800
01:06:05,088 --> 01:06:06,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo is my safe word this week.

801
01:06:06,509 --> 01:06:09,552
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember, if it gets a little bit too hard for you, just say...

802
01:06:10,638 --> 01:06:20,767
[SPEAKER_10]: I want my Wii U This actually has to do with an exclusive for PS3 that will be launching on Tuesday

803
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,722
[SPEAKER_10]: Tekken Revolution is going to be on PS3.

804
01:06:23,782 --> 01:06:25,264
[SPEAKER_10]: It will be free to play.

805
01:06:26,045 --> 01:06:27,286
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know me and my Tekken.

806
01:06:28,047 --> 01:06:29,028
[SPEAKER_10]: I worked for Namco.

807
01:06:29,488 --> 01:06:33,031
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember Tekken 3 and trying to predict who the next character would be.

808
01:06:33,091 --> 01:06:36,555
[SPEAKER_10]: So I have special, special love of anything Tekken.

809
01:06:37,516 --> 01:06:39,538
[SPEAKER_10]: Especially anything that has Gene Kazama in it.

810
01:06:39,558 --> 01:06:41,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but isn't this just going to be the dumb trading card game?

811
01:06:42,014 --> 01:06:42,514
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

812
01:06:43,595 --> 01:06:49,439
[SPEAKER_10]: It says that basically it's going to be... I'm trying to see what it says it's going to be.

813
01:06:49,459 --> 01:06:55,443
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's being referred to as a new version of Tekken card tournament.

814
01:06:56,644 --> 01:06:57,624
[SPEAKER_10]: Which, you know what's funny?

815
01:06:57,725 --> 01:07:00,546
[SPEAKER_10]: I even had the stupid Tekken card game on the Wonderswan.

816
01:07:01,387 --> 01:07:03,588
[SPEAKER_10]: So I will go to Lynx to play anything Tekken.

817
01:07:03,829 --> 01:07:04,449
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm just saying.

818
01:07:04,929 --> 01:07:05,370
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't judge me.

819
01:07:05,390 --> 01:07:06,230
[SPEAKER_04]: At least this one's free.

820
01:07:06,470 --> 01:07:06,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

821
01:07:07,171 --> 01:07:07,871
[SPEAKER_04]: I like free.

822
01:07:09,452 --> 01:07:09,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Who doesn't?

823
01:07:10,673 --> 01:07:11,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially because I'm broke.

824
01:07:12,114 --> 01:07:15,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you hate free and you want to buy something this week... Get the X-Bone!

825
01:07:17,377 --> 01:07:19,419
[SPEAKER_04]: If you hate freedom, buy an Xbox One.

826
01:07:20,259 --> 01:07:23,261
[SPEAKER_04]: No, seriously, what is coming out this week around the world?

827
01:07:23,421 --> 01:07:24,522
[SPEAKER_04]: US first, Loki.

828
01:07:24,802 --> 01:07:25,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing, really.

829
01:07:26,203 --> 01:07:27,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, one game.

830
01:07:27,443 --> 01:07:28,764
[SPEAKER_03]: The Last of Us on Friday.

831
01:07:29,425 --> 01:07:30,105
[SPEAKER_03]: On Friday.

832
01:07:30,325 --> 01:07:32,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Arguably a big fucking game.

833
01:07:32,306 --> 01:07:34,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, great reviews, but Friday?

834
01:07:35,168 --> 01:07:35,508
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

835
01:07:36,709 --> 01:07:38,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, gotta get down on Friday.

836
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:42,601
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, you know, they want to make sure... Gotta get down to Disneyland!

837
01:07:42,621 --> 01:07:47,984
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to make sure that it doesn't release on Tuesday with all that E3 news getting lost in the shuffle there.

838
01:07:48,104 --> 01:07:52,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well, traveling to Japan and seeing if there's anything additional this week.

839
01:07:52,747 --> 01:07:54,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Not so much on the PlayStation 3.

840
01:07:54,348 --> 01:07:56,169
[SPEAKER_04]: PlayStation 3 is looking pretty empty this week.

841
01:07:56,689 --> 01:07:58,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox 360, you'd be surprised.

842
01:07:58,850 --> 01:08:00,511
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a game on Xbox 360 this week.

843
01:08:00,551 --> 01:08:02,292
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Ginga Force and...

844
01:08:02,812 --> 01:08:04,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Eschatos Wonder Pack.

845
01:08:04,574 --> 01:08:07,716
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that's just like a combination two-for-one thing.

846
01:08:07,877 --> 01:08:09,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it is definitely a two-for-one pack.

847
01:08:09,398 --> 01:08:10,299
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking at the box art.

848
01:08:10,699 --> 01:08:16,744
[SPEAKER_04]: These look to be 3D spacey shooter games, like mechs.

849
01:08:17,765 --> 01:08:19,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's got classic games in there, too.

850
01:08:20,007 --> 01:08:20,327
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.

851
01:08:20,667 --> 01:08:22,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Judgment, Silver Sword, Cardinal Sins.

852
01:08:22,789 --> 01:08:27,173
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a shmup fan, this might be the compilation for you.

853
01:08:27,273 --> 01:08:28,354
[SPEAKER_04]: That is out on the Xbox 360 this week.

854
01:08:29,875 --> 01:08:33,218
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just me or does Xbox 360 get so many shmups over in Japan?

855
01:08:33,298 --> 01:08:35,400
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the shmup console.

856
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:36,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's good to know.

857
01:08:36,221 --> 01:08:40,264
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but especially bullet hell games?

858
01:08:40,784 --> 01:08:41,145
[SPEAKER_10]: Please.

859
01:08:43,767 --> 01:08:47,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking at the other systems, sadly not a lot this week.

860
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:49,412
[SPEAKER_04]: 3DS is really the only other thing that's seeing some releases.

861
01:08:49,472 --> 01:08:56,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Donkey Kong Returns makes its way to Japan this week and there's a Nintendo Metallic Red 3DS to match.

862
01:08:56,918 --> 01:09:04,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, one other game from Square Enix this week, Chusoku Henkai Jairozetter, Albatross no Tsubasa, comes out this week.

863
01:09:05,401 --> 01:09:06,801
[SPEAKER_10]: Wings of the Albatross?

864
01:09:07,722 --> 01:09:12,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it looks like another mech fighting game slash role-playing game type thing.

865
01:09:12,802 --> 01:09:19,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Aren't albatrosses usually associated with bad nautical things?

866
01:09:19,145 --> 01:09:22,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they're mechs that swim, DarkSakura.

867
01:09:22,186 --> 01:09:22,667
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

868
01:09:22,687 --> 01:09:24,127
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think albatrosses can swim.

869
01:09:25,508 --> 01:09:27,489
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they just die and hang around your neck.

870
01:09:29,490 --> 01:09:34,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of dying and hanging around your neck, I'm done with Japanese game releases this week.

871
01:09:34,943 --> 01:09:36,504
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we have a few things for the UK.

872
01:09:36,704 --> 01:09:40,347
[SPEAKER_10]: On the 11th, we have Tekken Revolution, as I brought up earlier.

873
01:09:41,068 --> 01:09:43,650
[SPEAKER_10]: On the 12th, we have Xenoclash on the Xbox 360.

874
01:09:43,770 --> 01:09:45,731
[SPEAKER_10]: And on the 14th, Animal Crossing 3DS.

875
01:09:46,492 --> 01:09:52,196
[SPEAKER_10]: Chemical spillage simulation for PC, which actually just sounds hilarious without knowing anything about it.

876
01:09:52,336 --> 01:09:53,897
[SPEAKER_10]: And then The Last of Us on PS3.

877
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:56,279
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

878
01:09:58,301 --> 01:10:00,002
[SPEAKER_10]: Stick a fork in it, speaking of dead things.

879
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:03,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, let's see.

880
01:10:05,064 --> 01:10:17,822
[SPEAKER_03]: There is some interesting controversy with this game, Vampire Smile, which was one of those... It originally started off as the dishwasher, one of the first Xbox...

881
01:10:18,783 --> 01:10:20,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Indie games that they showed off.

882
01:10:20,444 --> 01:10:24,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I think while they were introducing indie games or what they used to be called?

883
01:10:24,927 --> 01:10:25,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Community games?

884
01:10:26,068 --> 01:10:26,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Way back in the day?

885
01:10:27,008 --> 01:10:31,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so the sequel, The Dishwasher, The Vampire Smile, was coming to PC.

886
01:10:33,672 --> 01:10:41,077
[SPEAKER_03]: But originally, the first way it came to the PC was a hacker, I guess a developer, Barbarous,

887
01:10:41,717 --> 01:10:47,982
[SPEAKER_03]: He really wanted to see the game come to PC, so he cracked the version of it and uploaded it, I guess, to the internet.

888
01:10:48,622 --> 01:10:50,824
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he kind of ported it to PC.

889
01:10:50,924 --> 01:10:59,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Well now, it's actually coming officially to PC as well, because they weren't too happy with the fact that he cracked the game and stuff.

890
01:11:02,038 --> 01:11:04,960
[SPEAKER_03]: New Director's Cut is going to have some enhancements to the game.

891
01:11:05,620 --> 01:11:08,382
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not a good precedent to set, though.

892
01:11:08,562 --> 01:11:11,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Hack our game and we'll put it on the console you want.

893
01:11:11,384 --> 01:11:19,689
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember with Sonic Generations, they had the Sonic... What the hell was the crappy one with the werehog?

894
01:11:21,223 --> 01:11:23,724
[SPEAKER_03]: They had all the daylight missions from that game.

895
01:11:23,804 --> 01:11:24,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Ask this one.

896
01:11:24,464 --> 01:11:24,824
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

897
01:11:24,844 --> 01:11:26,604
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't tell all those Sonic games apart.

898
01:11:26,644 --> 01:11:27,024
[SPEAKER_04]: She can.

899
01:11:27,044 --> 01:11:27,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Which Sonic game?

900
01:11:27,624 --> 01:11:28,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Sonic Unleashed, I think it was.

901
01:11:29,025 --> 01:11:29,805
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't play that one.

902
01:11:30,625 --> 01:11:38,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Sonic Unleashed, they had the daytime levels from that ported over to Sonic Generations for the PC because it never came out on PC.

903
01:11:39,167 --> 01:11:41,727
[SPEAKER_10]: I do have Sonic Generations and I haven't even played it yet.

904
01:11:44,148 --> 01:11:50,989
[SPEAKER_04]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com use the passphrase TICKET

905
01:11:52,082 --> 01:11:55,044
[SPEAKER_10]: To answer a code man, I don't acknowledge that in my universe.

906
01:11:55,885 --> 01:11:56,105
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

907
01:11:56,906 --> 01:11:57,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Acknowledge what?

908
01:11:57,546 --> 01:11:59,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't have a one-sided conversation here.

909
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:00,289
[SPEAKER_10]: Kiefer Sutherland.

910
01:12:00,489 --> 01:12:01,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, that's coming up later in the show.

911
01:12:01,690 --> 01:12:01,850
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

912
01:12:01,870 --> 01:12:02,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop spoiling things.

913
01:12:03,211 --> 01:12:03,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop spoiling it.

914
01:12:04,192 --> 01:12:05,153
[SPEAKER_10]: I still don't like thinking about it.

915
01:12:05,173 --> 01:12:05,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Spoiler.

916
01:12:06,154 --> 01:12:06,434
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

917
01:12:07,174 --> 01:12:07,795
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what, Rob?

918
01:12:08,591 --> 01:12:09,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Spawning

919
01:12:25,829 --> 01:12:28,670
[SPEAKER_04]: and I thought that meant maybe like a new enemy unit.

920
01:12:28,930 --> 01:12:29,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't that what Zergs do?

921
01:12:29,850 --> 01:12:30,811
[SPEAKER_04]: They spawn a lot of Zergs.

922
01:12:31,091 --> 01:12:39,093
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, what happens, you get free access to gameplay features when somebody who doesn't own a certain version of the game parties with someone who did.

923
01:12:39,493 --> 01:12:45,015
[SPEAKER_04]: So in other words, when you go into multiplayer, you play the most current version of the game owned by at least one person in the party.

924
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:52,397
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have the free starter edition, but you come play with me and I have StarCraft II Basic Edition, we're now both playing StarCraft II Basic Edition.

925
01:12:52,757 --> 01:12:53,438
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of cool.

926
01:12:53,458 --> 01:12:53,798
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like...

927
01:12:54,918 --> 01:12:57,120
[SPEAKER_04]: DS One Cartridge Play or something like that.

928
01:12:57,540 --> 01:13:01,344
[SPEAKER_04]: If I party up with somebody playing Heart of the Swarm, we both get to play Heart of the Swarm.

929
01:13:02,465 --> 01:13:06,909
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been rolling out globally since June 4th when this was announced.

930
01:13:07,629 --> 01:13:12,694
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what regions do and don't have it at this time, but this is something that is planned for everybody.

931
01:13:13,054 --> 01:13:13,594
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's some...

932
01:13:14,375 --> 01:13:28,788
[SPEAKER_04]: that's kind of awesome actually because if you if you have like a core group of four friends that you just want to do nothing but play Starcraft with maybe one of you is a big Starcraft nerd but the others aren't so much one person buys the game everybody mooches off it and you just don't play otherwise

933
01:13:30,387 --> 01:13:31,048
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of cool.

934
01:13:32,129 --> 01:13:32,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

935
01:13:32,989 --> 01:13:39,355
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost like if you had a game and then you load it to their friends and then they got really excited about the game and bought the sequel when it came out at launch.

936
01:13:40,456 --> 01:13:41,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we can't have that.

937
01:13:41,277 --> 01:13:42,418
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't do that.

938
01:13:42,478 --> 01:13:44,039
[SPEAKER_03]: It cuts into developer money.

939
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:51,526
[SPEAKER_04]: To be fair, although I love your tongue-in-cheek point there, let's not forget StarCraft II does require an always online connection just because that's the nature of the game.

940
01:13:51,566 --> 01:13:55,890
[SPEAKER_03]: You're right, because the PC marketplace is completely different than the console marketplace.

941
01:13:57,131 --> 01:13:57,411
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

942
01:14:21,536 --> 01:14:24,998
[SPEAKER_10]: I cut you all with my razor sharp wit.

943
01:14:25,358 --> 01:14:28,160
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week this week?

944
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:29,620
[SPEAKER_10]: Star Gladiator.

945
01:14:31,201 --> 01:14:35,504
[SPEAKER_10]: Or as it was called over here, Star Gladiator Episode 1, Final Crusade.

946
01:14:35,924 --> 01:14:37,645
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Episode 1, Final Crusade.

947
01:14:37,685 --> 01:14:38,425
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up with that?

948
01:14:38,625 --> 01:14:38,845
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

949
01:14:39,386 --> 01:14:40,526
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyway, it came out in 1996.

950
01:14:41,347 --> 01:14:45,949
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a 3D fighting game done by Capcom for the PlayStation.

951
01:14:46,349 --> 01:14:50,312
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, actually for the ZN1 arcade, which was basically a glorified PlayStation.

952
01:14:51,673 --> 01:14:54,395
[SPEAKER_10]: It was their first polygon fighting game.

953
01:14:56,878 --> 01:15:01,062
[SPEAKER_10]: It actually came out before Street Fighter EX, so this was kind of a big thing for them.

954
01:15:03,204 --> 01:15:07,628
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a pretty neat little game, I mean, as far as a 3D fighter goes.

955
01:15:08,729 --> 01:15:08,809
[SPEAKER_10]: It...

956
01:15:10,711 --> 01:15:21,382
[SPEAKER_10]: It didn't use the six button thing, it used a four button configuration that was a lot like how the Soul Edge and Soul Calibur games went.

957
01:15:22,222 --> 01:15:26,026
[SPEAKER_10]: You had a 3D plane, you could do ring outs, it was that type of game.

958
01:15:26,166 --> 01:15:30,371
[SPEAKER_10]: So it wasn't really anything that was special.

959
01:15:31,016 --> 01:15:35,157
[SPEAKER_10]: as far as 3D fighting games at the time, but the fact that it was Capcom's first makes it notable.

960
01:15:36,978 --> 01:15:52,562
[SPEAKER_10]: It also had these things called plasma reverses that are guard moves that you have to release at a particular point in time in the battle where it will enable you to deflect an incoming move and stun them so that you could actually attack in reverse.

961
01:15:53,862 --> 01:15:57,243
[SPEAKER_10]: And it also does extra damage as well.

962
01:15:59,944 --> 01:16:13,720
[SPEAKER_10]: It also had a combo system so that you could basically just pommel people to death and then in the arcade mode it was ten fights and depending on who you chose as your character you had a specific set of opponents that you would fight.

963
01:16:16,122 --> 01:16:17,463
[SPEAKER_10]: So it was actually a pretty good game.

964
01:16:17,483 --> 01:16:33,758
[SPEAKER_10]: You see some notable characters in there that showed up in other Capcom games, like Hayato showed up in Marvel vs. Capcom 2, and he had an appearance in Tatsunoko vs. Capcom in the Tekken Man Blade ending, which actually kind of made me giddy at the time.

965
01:16:34,859 --> 01:16:58,640
[SPEAKER_10]: and there was June who was also in the background stages of Gem Fighter and in Capcom vs. SNK 2 and in one of the wind poses of Hayato in Marvel vs. Capcom 2 and she was also in Hawkeye's ending in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 as a member of the West Coast Avengers which actually that was pretty crazy because I beat my game with him.

966
01:16:59,841 --> 01:17:14,148
[SPEAKER_10]: There was Saturn Dyer, Gammoth Gogri, Franco Garrett, Vector Rimgal, who was June's dad, Zelkin Diskay Krogan, there's a bunch of people in the game anyway.

967
01:17:16,509 --> 01:17:24,493
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a really neat game in that it used both English and Japanese voice acting for the characters.

968
01:17:27,414 --> 01:17:41,320
[SPEAKER_10]: It also spawned a Dreamcast game that was called Plasma Sword Nightmare of Blissin, which is... Actually, me finding my Dreamcast copy is what made me think of the PlayStation version.

969
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:43,241
[SPEAKER_10]: But it was a really neat game.

970
01:17:43,421 --> 01:17:55,547
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, for all of the stuff that it did, it may not seem a big deal today, but when it came out, I thought it was a really cool game.

971
01:17:56,027 --> 01:17:56,187
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

972
01:17:57,873 --> 01:17:58,473
[SPEAKER_10]: Star Gladiator.

973
01:17:59,613 --> 01:18:01,014
[SPEAKER_10]: You win Classic Games of the Week.

974
01:18:01,794 --> 01:18:11,476
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to admit, I didn't know a lot about this game until I'm kind of watching the... As with a lot of these classic games you pick, I didn't know a lot about this one, but I'm watching it and I'm like, wow, this looks pretty good for a PlayStation 1 game.

975
01:18:11,576 --> 01:18:11,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

976
01:18:11,917 --> 01:18:14,357
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks a little more Dreamcast level to me.

977
01:18:15,297 --> 01:18:16,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it late PS1?

978
01:18:17,078 --> 01:18:18,358
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd say it was late PS1.

979
01:18:18,838 --> 01:18:25,120
[SPEAKER_10]: But you should see Star Gladiator was actually a really fun little fighter.

980
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:29,703
[SPEAKER_10]: It had its issues, I mean, just about with any PlayStation 1 game at a time.

981
01:18:30,343 --> 01:18:34,767
[SPEAKER_10]: But you should really see Plasma Sword, because that was really fun, too.

982
01:18:34,887 --> 01:18:37,529
[SPEAKER_04]: This character here, June, I really like her, too.

983
01:18:37,609 --> 01:18:38,369
[SPEAKER_04]: With the chakram?

984
01:18:38,550 --> 01:18:42,933
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, she reminds me of that Chicken Soul Calibartina, I think it is, with a similar deal.

985
01:18:42,953 --> 01:18:43,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

986
01:18:43,493 --> 01:18:44,374
[SPEAKER_04]: The big disc, yeah.

987
01:18:46,665 --> 01:18:49,629
[SPEAKER_10]: And actually, that's who I played this game most with, was Jean.

988
01:18:50,391 --> 01:18:54,537
[SPEAKER_10]: But you should, one of these days we'll have to hook up the Dreamcast and I'll bring over Plasma Sword.

989
01:18:55,018 --> 01:18:55,719
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a Dreamcast.

990
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:59,445
[SPEAKER_10]: So do I. But I have Plasma Sword and I will bring it over.

991
01:19:00,478 --> 01:19:06,821
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why I need to get game streaming on my TV, because we need to do some classic NES game streaming through the Dreamcast emulation.

992
01:19:07,142 --> 01:19:07,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

993
01:19:07,622 --> 01:19:08,983
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be wrong, but funny.

994
01:19:09,323 --> 01:19:12,525
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, there it is, the classic game of the week, Star Gladiator.

995
01:19:12,665 --> 01:19:13,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Star Gladiator.

996
01:19:14,266 --> 01:19:20,469
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, actually, I need to point out, ClericalHero404 did remind me, she's using a combo attack of Chun-Li and Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo.

997
01:19:20,869 --> 01:19:21,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Who was?

998
01:19:21,870 --> 01:19:22,110
[SPEAKER_10]: June.

999
01:19:22,330 --> 01:19:22,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

1000
01:19:22,850 --> 01:19:23,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1001
01:19:23,210 --> 01:19:23,811
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember that.

1002
01:19:24,331 --> 01:19:25,952
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there were cosplay...

1003
01:19:27,086 --> 01:19:28,307
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1004
01:19:49,544 --> 01:19:52,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we got plenty more show to go here.

1005
01:19:53,086 --> 01:19:54,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming up with Part B tonight.

1006
01:19:54,326 --> 01:19:55,667
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a list list coming up tonight.

1007
01:19:55,947 --> 01:19:57,928
[SPEAKER_04]: A few surprises in store with list lists tonight.

1008
01:19:57,948 --> 01:19:58,548
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I'm going to say.

1009
01:19:58,588 --> 01:20:00,289
[SPEAKER_04]: You are definitely going to want to be here live for this.

1010
01:20:00,909 --> 01:20:02,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry to the podcasters in advance.

1011
01:20:02,790 --> 01:20:04,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool live feature tonight.

1012
01:20:04,651 --> 01:20:06,752
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Fugle Question of the Week as well.

1013
01:20:07,012 --> 01:20:14,335
[SPEAKER_04]: And Rapid Fire News, the Mailbag FUs of the Week, and your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR and username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1014
01:20:14,495 --> 01:20:17,757
[SPEAKER_04]: All when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1015
01:20:26,823 --> 01:20:32,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi there, this is Flaco Jones, and you're participating with Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.

1016
01:20:33,229 --> 01:20:35,751
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to use my voice to tell you, you should all play Ni No Kuni.

1017
01:20:36,052 --> 01:20:36,412
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great.

1018
01:20:36,952 --> 01:20:38,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, you should beat Ni No Kuni.

1019
01:20:38,554 --> 01:20:42,297
[SPEAKER_06]: And now that I've said it in a bumper, you have to beat Ni No Kuni, or you have to play this bumper forever.

1020
01:20:44,127 --> 01:20:44,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1021
01:21:04,444 --> 01:21:06,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, if you're actually going to play it, then yes.

1022
01:21:06,865 --> 01:21:07,145
[SPEAKER_04]: I will.

1023
01:21:07,365 --> 01:21:07,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1024
01:21:07,826 --> 01:21:08,926
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you'll like it, actually.

1025
01:21:09,326 --> 01:21:10,127
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, you may borrow it.

1026
01:21:10,147 --> 01:21:10,867
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm fun employed.

1027
01:21:11,147 --> 01:21:12,248
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Flaco would approve of that.

1028
01:21:12,588 --> 01:21:14,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we did recycle a message this week.

1029
01:21:15,129 --> 01:21:16,390
[SPEAKER_04]: That means we could use some new bumpers.

1030
01:21:16,750 --> 01:21:20,371
[SPEAKER_04]: I did get one today, to be fair, so I'll put that in for next week.

1031
01:21:20,612 --> 01:21:26,814
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you want to submit a bumper as well, you can get all the information at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

1032
01:21:26,854 --> 01:21:27,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Click on Forums.

1033
01:21:28,075 --> 01:21:29,139
[SPEAKER_04]: and look at the ULR forum.

1034
01:21:29,179 --> 01:21:35,199
[SPEAKER_04]: It's right there at the top in a sticky thread how you can get your voice in a bumper on the show and you can tell the listeners whatever you want within reason.

1035
01:21:35,535 --> 01:21:41,140
[SPEAKER_10]: I even did one in not that great Japanese, but thanks to Kuma JP for correcting my grammar.

1036
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:45,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm talking about the ones that, not the ones that play on the network, but the ones that bring us back here.

1037
01:21:45,583 --> 01:21:47,424
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm planning on actually doing one.

1038
01:21:48,045 --> 01:21:48,826
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're on the show.

1039
01:21:49,946 --> 01:21:50,647
[SPEAKER_10]: I can do a bumper.

1040
01:21:50,667 --> 01:21:50,947
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you can't.

1041
01:21:51,207 --> 01:21:51,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I can.

1042
01:21:52,188 --> 01:21:53,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Do a bumper for Bobby's show.

1043
01:21:53,409 --> 01:21:54,210
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll do one for Bobby.

1044
01:21:54,970 --> 01:21:58,413
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll do one for Bobby that says, Hey, listen to this show, damn it.

1045
01:21:59,054 --> 01:21:59,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, listen.

1046
01:21:59,494 --> 01:22:00,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, listen.

1047
01:22:00,655 --> 01:22:01,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, listen.

1048
01:22:01,836 --> 01:22:02,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, listen.

1049
01:22:03,497 --> 01:22:05,198
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'd have to make it high-pitched.

1050
01:22:05,298 --> 01:22:05,998
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, listen!

1051
01:22:06,959 --> 01:22:11,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, plenty more to come here on this half of Orange Lounge Radio.

1052
01:22:11,781 --> 01:22:13,121
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, some rapid-fire news.

1053
01:22:13,282 --> 01:22:16,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's take care of a lot of news this week in rapid-fire news.

1054
01:22:17,063 --> 01:22:21,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so it sort of leaked out, and then it got announced.

1055
01:22:21,305 --> 01:22:31,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Halo Spartan Assault is coming out for all your favorite gaming platforms, including Windows 8 PCs, tablets, and phones.

1056
01:22:33,863 --> 01:22:35,924
[SPEAKER_03]: and those are Windows 8 devices by the way.

1057
01:22:36,524 --> 01:22:38,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Windows phone, Surface tablets.

1058
01:22:40,387 --> 01:22:47,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and apparently it's gonna be set between Halo 3 and 4 and is a twin-stick shooter.

1059
01:22:49,980 --> 01:22:51,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally the title you were looking for.

1060
01:22:52,881 --> 01:22:57,583
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some free-to-play games coming to the PlayStation 4.

1061
01:22:58,684 --> 01:23:03,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Planetside 2 and DC Universe Online have both been confirmed for the PlayStation 4.

1062
01:23:04,246 --> 01:23:06,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I'm not surprised because it's Sony Online.

1063
01:23:07,428 --> 01:23:08,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are Sony Online games.

1064
01:23:08,728 --> 01:23:12,950
[SPEAKER_04]: But somewhere I hear Brad from PodCulture squeeing about the DC Universe Online.

1065
01:23:13,010 --> 01:23:13,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Just call it a hunch.

1066
01:23:14,410 --> 01:23:15,351
[SPEAKER_04]: If his internet's back up.

1067
01:23:15,931 --> 01:23:38,463
[SPEAKER_03]: so those will both be coming out and also Warframe is gonna be coming as well as a free-to-play title and yeah so I guess we're gonna see a lot of free-to-play games on PlayStation 4 so that could be good or bad I don't know free-to-play is not I like that business model so we'll see you like free?

1068
01:23:38,803 --> 01:23:44,086
[SPEAKER_03]: I like free yeah it's awesome do you think there'll be a lot of free games on Xbox One?

1069
01:23:46,408 --> 01:23:47,328
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's got to be some.

1070
01:23:47,528 --> 01:23:48,709
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the world we live in now.

1071
01:23:50,509 --> 01:23:53,290
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just wondering if there's going to be any MMOs on Xbox One.

1072
01:23:53,310 --> 01:23:59,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Because remember, there wasn't really much on the Xbox 360 aside from Final Fantasy.

1073
01:23:59,871 --> 01:24:04,832
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess there's some pay to play MMOs, like the Defiance and stuff.

1074
01:24:04,892 --> 01:24:09,553
[SPEAKER_03]: But none like actual traditional MMOs beyond Final Fantasy XI.

1075
01:24:09,874 --> 01:24:10,174
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't know.

1076
01:24:10,634 --> 01:24:11,394
[SPEAKER_03]: So it'll be interesting.

1077
01:24:12,174 --> 01:24:26,211
[SPEAKER_03]: and last but not least new Harmonix title was announced last week and that was Fantasia Music Evolved and I saw the trailer and I'm like that has very little to do with Fantasia here's the thing

1078
01:24:27,012 --> 01:24:27,932
[SPEAKER_04]: I love harmonics.

1079
01:24:28,733 --> 01:24:29,533
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Disney.

1080
01:24:29,553 --> 01:24:30,674
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we get elephants and tutus?

1081
01:24:32,214 --> 01:24:32,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

1082
01:24:32,834 --> 01:24:34,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I love harmonics.

1083
01:24:34,175 --> 01:24:34,815
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Disney.

1084
01:24:34,955 --> 01:24:35,976
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate Bruno Mars.

1085
01:24:36,336 --> 01:24:38,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Why was that in the trailer?

1086
01:24:38,297 --> 01:24:38,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

1087
01:24:39,197 --> 01:24:41,098
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're going to have pop music.

1088
01:24:41,838 --> 01:24:43,599
[SPEAKER_03]: They're also going to have... That's not Fantasia.

1089
01:24:44,472 --> 01:24:47,254
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're also going to have the classical music as well.

1090
01:24:47,914 --> 01:24:51,016
[SPEAKER_03]: And Bohemian Rhapsody is going to be in it.

1091
01:24:51,076 --> 01:24:53,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything with Queen is instantly better.

1092
01:24:53,337 --> 01:24:55,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Queen is one of the artists.

1093
01:24:56,019 --> 01:24:57,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Instant fantasticness.

1094
01:24:57,460 --> 01:24:58,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Just add Freddie Mercury.

1095
01:24:58,641 --> 01:25:02,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the tracks announced so far.

1096
01:25:02,143 --> 01:25:03,203
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that make him a Disney queen?

1097
01:25:04,444 --> 01:25:11,094
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Bohemian Rhapsody, Kimbra Settle Down, I don't know what that is, Fun Some Nights.

1098
01:25:11,254 --> 01:25:17,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on, just in case DarkSakura hadn't seen this yet, I'm playing this in studio, the little teaser trailer for this.

1099
01:25:17,683 --> 01:25:19,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me skip ahead a little bit.

1100
01:25:22,074 --> 01:25:24,436
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically it's Sorcerer Mickey mode.

1101
01:25:25,197 --> 01:25:29,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's like you're Sorcerer Mickey, but it doesn't really tell you what the game is.

1102
01:25:29,902 --> 01:25:30,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's the game here?

1103
01:25:31,103 --> 01:25:33,024
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm left to think it's Rhythm Party.

1104
01:25:34,526 --> 01:25:36,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it looks like Rhythm Party.

1105
01:25:36,748 --> 01:25:41,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I said Rhythm Party should have just been a retail release with all the tracks, but whatever.

1106
01:25:42,301 --> 01:25:42,701
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

1107
01:25:42,862 --> 01:25:45,284
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't care, because I don't really like Kinect games.

1108
01:25:46,225 --> 01:25:55,113
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing that's kind of unique, I guess, about it, supposedly, is you can control the tempo of the song, and it changes depending on stuff you do, I guess.

1109
01:25:55,553 --> 01:25:56,974
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's going to be kind of neat.

1110
01:25:57,074 --> 01:25:59,777
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the tracks in there was it, AVI, what was it?

1111
01:26:01,142 --> 01:26:22,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Black Wolf in chat says game trailers actually showed gameplay it's Elite Beat Agents Connect oh so it's Rhythm Party like I said and you see this face that no one in the chat room can see this is my no one Kerr face I'm willing to give it a shot just because I really love Harmonix and they always put out quality I love Harmonix but I hate Kinect games fair

1112
01:26:24,682 --> 01:26:30,964
[SPEAKER_03]: and Levels is also one of the songs in there, which if I remember correctly, I think that's... Let's see here.

1113
01:26:33,465 --> 01:26:35,906
[SPEAKER_10]: If I wanted to get up and dance, I'd take a Zumba class.

1114
01:26:37,226 --> 01:26:37,767
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

1115
01:26:37,867 --> 01:26:38,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I do like Levels.

1116
01:26:38,807 --> 01:26:45,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Levels is awesome because that was one of the songs that was in Forza Horizon, one of my favorite ones on the dubstep thing.

1117
01:26:45,469 --> 01:26:45,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

1118
01:26:47,885 --> 01:26:48,947
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm digging it.

1119
01:26:48,987 --> 01:26:49,888
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it'd be kind of cool.

1120
01:26:49,948 --> 01:26:51,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Harmonix, can't go wrong with them.

1121
01:26:52,151 --> 01:26:54,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby gave me a link to this and I hadn't seen it.

1122
01:26:55,135 --> 01:26:56,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's the actual gameplay?

1123
01:26:58,079 --> 01:26:59,401
[SPEAKER_04]: I just hear a dude talking.

1124
01:26:59,421 --> 01:27:00,542
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see gameplay.

1125
01:27:03,146 --> 01:27:04,107
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that under the sea?

1126
01:27:04,127 --> 01:27:05,668
[SPEAKER_13]: Down where it's wetter under the sea.

1127
01:27:05,708 --> 01:27:06,389
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, see, there it is.

1128
01:27:06,489 --> 01:27:06,729
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess.

1129
01:27:06,809 --> 01:27:08,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so this is not a rhythm party.

1130
01:27:08,371 --> 01:27:08,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh.

1131
01:27:08,491 --> 01:27:08,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

1132
01:27:08,771 --> 01:27:08,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

1133
01:27:23,726 --> 01:27:26,067
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1134
01:27:26,207 --> 01:27:27,568
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like curious.

1135
01:27:28,669 --> 01:27:29,209
[SPEAKER_10]: Put out a demo.

1136
01:27:29,269 --> 01:27:31,931
[SPEAKER_10]: It seems like a game that you... I want a new Para Para Paradise.

1137
01:27:31,991 --> 01:27:32,971
[SPEAKER_10]: Then I would play my Kinect.

1138
01:27:33,011 --> 01:27:33,531
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

1139
01:27:33,932 --> 01:27:35,753
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what they really needed to have?

1140
01:27:36,033 --> 01:27:41,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Is they needed to have Q games and fucking Harmonix come together and do like a new like Child of Eden type of game.

1141
01:27:41,376 --> 01:27:43,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Child of Eden was fucking awesome.

1142
01:27:43,257 --> 01:27:43,857
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty good.

1143
01:27:44,358 --> 01:27:48,600
[SPEAKER_04]: ClericalEra404 in our chat quickly wants to know, DarkSakura, why do you hate Kinect games?

1144
01:27:49,086 --> 01:27:52,405
[SPEAKER_10]: Because usually they show you what you're doing and I don't like to watch myself.

1145
01:27:56,308 --> 01:27:57,748
[SPEAKER_04]: You can sometimes turn camera off.

1146
01:27:57,809 --> 01:28:00,209
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, if I can turn the camera off, I have no problem with it.

1147
01:28:00,349 --> 01:28:03,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I would have just thought you just don't like the whole flailing around.

1148
01:28:03,170 --> 01:28:06,311
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I don't mind flailing around as long as nobody else is over.

1149
01:28:07,131 --> 01:28:13,272
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, to be fair, the original Kinect games, not exactly very accurate a lot of times.

1150
01:28:13,632 --> 01:28:14,373
[SPEAKER_10]: That was that, too.

1151
01:28:14,533 --> 01:28:23,775
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, the only fun I've ever had playing a Kinect game was doing Parapara on Dance Masters, which is why that's still the only Kinect game I will play.

1152
01:28:24,795 --> 01:28:26,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let me move on with some other news.

1153
01:28:26,437 --> 01:28:29,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe DarkSakura instead would rather play Injustice.

1154
01:28:29,539 --> 01:28:31,461
[SPEAKER_04]: I know she loves DC Universe.

1155
01:28:32,562 --> 01:28:33,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I like DC Universe?

1156
01:28:34,384 --> 01:28:34,724
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1157
01:28:35,845 --> 01:28:37,366
[SPEAKER_04]: But apparently Injustice is pretty good.

1158
01:28:37,426 --> 01:28:40,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody said Injustice is the best thing going on in DC Universe right now.

1159
01:28:40,609 --> 01:28:40,909
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.com

1160
01:28:55,766 --> 01:28:55,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

1161
01:28:56,126 --> 01:28:56,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?

1162
01:28:56,747 --> 01:28:57,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't care.

1163
01:28:57,087 --> 01:28:57,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

1164
01:28:57,488 --> 01:29:01,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they have a whole bunch of other DC superheroes that they could put in the game.

1165
01:29:01,851 --> 01:29:02,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Scorpion's a superhero.

1166
01:29:03,012 --> 01:29:03,693
[SPEAKER_03]: No, he's not.

1167
01:29:03,753 --> 01:29:11,159
[SPEAKER_03]: No, he's like fucking, it's like, oh, hey, it's Scorpion, but I can't do any of my bloody moves because it's fucking teen rated.

1168
01:29:11,660 --> 01:29:15,643
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's what happened with the whole Mortal Kombat versus DC universe.

1169
01:29:15,783 --> 01:29:19,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry, I can't behead Batman because it's fucking teen rated.

1170
01:29:19,947 --> 01:29:20,768
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, whatever.

1171
01:29:20,788 --> 01:29:21,889
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds lame.

1172
01:29:22,710 --> 01:29:24,332
[SPEAKER_10]: I honestly did not find the game fun.

1173
01:29:24,572 --> 01:29:24,853
[SPEAKER_10]: The end.

1174
01:29:26,114 --> 01:29:38,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, information on the new voice of Snake, because you know, a certain co-host of mine didn't ruin this earlier in the show, but Kiefer Sutherland confirmed as the voice of Snake in Metal Gear Solid 5, not David Hader.

1175
01:29:39,073 --> 01:29:44,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I think this was just like buzz earlier.

1176
01:29:44,277 --> 01:29:52,784
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't have confirmation, but now that it's in the trailer, because the Konami whole thing, which we haven't even brought up in the show yet, but Konami had their whole little movie thing come up, and this was part of it.

1177
01:29:53,444 --> 01:29:55,806
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that's that.

1178
01:29:57,387 --> 01:30:13,622
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that to me sounds like the whole situation where, you know, it's the How I Met Your Mother situation where you have, you know, Bob Saget as the narrator, he's supposed to be the father, but yeah, his voice isn't obviously going to change, you know, over the default Ted Mosley voice that, you know, the characters have.

1179
01:30:14,282 --> 01:30:14,883
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just different.

1180
01:30:16,204 --> 01:30:16,464
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1181
01:30:16,764 --> 01:30:21,328
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wonder if we ever get a movie, if we'll have, you know, Kiefer Sutherland playing Snake.

1182
01:30:22,309 --> 01:30:30,416
[SPEAKER_04]: EA, hopefully giving some final clarity to some of the shady things they've said about the Wii U in the past, courtesy of EA president Frank Gabow.

1183
01:30:30,796 --> 01:30:35,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I'm going to admit, I think we brought up something similar to this last week, but this is coming from EA president of labels.

1184
01:30:35,620 --> 01:30:36,401
[SPEAKER_04]: This is somebody else.

1185
01:30:37,181 --> 01:30:38,523
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they have nothing coming.

1186
01:30:38,543 --> 01:30:39,163
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing coming.

1187
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:05,124
[SPEAKER_04]: We're really excited about the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4, and that's a pretty big endeavor in and of itself.

1188
01:31:05,324 --> 01:31:05,804
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder why.

1189
01:31:06,285 --> 01:31:12,209
[SPEAKER_04]: We have four titles out on the Wii U that are active right now, so looking at how things unfold, that's where our focus is right now.

1190
01:31:12,730 --> 01:31:14,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Gen 3 is an awesome platform.

1191
01:31:14,431 --> 01:31:20,416
[SPEAKER_04]: It has a huge audience, has a lot of capability, and we're going to continue to publish games on Gen 3 for as long as there is an audience there.

1192
01:31:20,796 --> 01:31:24,319
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a tendency as a company to support the last gen platforms for many, many years.

1193
01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:29,583
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell you we have products planned for next year, the year after that, and the year after that for Gen 3 for sure.

1194
01:31:31,003 --> 01:31:57,751
[SPEAKER_03]: well yeah because they keep pumping out Madden sequels and stuff like that on like PlayStation 2 and Xbox up to like way past the console's life cycles and stuff but it doesn't necessarily mean you're gonna see like big games on there the honest blunt way I could say this is that third party games aren't really what a lot of people go to Nintendo for anyway I mean they'll help of course I mean certainly the Sega partnership with Sonic which is so weird

1195
01:31:58,411 --> 01:32:01,632
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura I'm sorry, I was just getting out my DC hate out of my system

1196
01:32:29,693 --> 01:32:30,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't we all just get along?

1197
01:32:31,194 --> 01:32:32,335
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Marvel all the way.

1198
01:32:32,495 --> 01:32:36,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, listen, if it's any consolation, Deadpool comes out in a couple weeks anyway.

1199
01:32:36,357 --> 01:32:37,178
[SPEAKER_10]: I know!

1200
01:32:37,358 --> 01:32:39,239
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm so happy.

1201
01:32:41,240 --> 01:32:41,721
[SPEAKER_10]: So happy.

1202
01:32:42,061 --> 01:32:45,123
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, well, how about some other really quick news, okay?

1203
01:32:46,087 --> 01:32:46,807
[SPEAKER_10]: Diablo 3.

1204
01:32:48,408 --> 01:32:55,571
[SPEAKER_10]: We've seen an announcement before that it's going to be on the PS3 and PS4.

1205
01:32:55,691 --> 01:33:05,234
[SPEAKER_10]: They're also bringing it out on Xbox 360, but have no plans to bring it out for any other system, which is a polite fuck you to Xbone, as I'm still going to call it forever.

1206
01:33:06,835 --> 01:33:10,897
[SPEAKER_10]: Honestly, a lot of us have been playing it on PC already, so who cares?

1207
01:33:11,997 --> 01:33:36,712
[SPEAKER_10]: and then this makes me really happy is that Hatsune Miku Project Diva F is going to be coming out in North America in August and I'm gonna get it there's a demo on June 11th and so excited because I love the Project Diva games and then last but not least Metal Gear Rising Revengeance

1208
01:33:37,572 --> 01:33:43,014
[SPEAKER_10]: If anyone likes stories about Raiden, well, you get to play more Raiden because it's going to be on PC.

1209
01:33:43,874 --> 01:33:44,254
[SPEAKER_10]: The end.

1210
01:33:44,354 --> 01:33:50,157
[SPEAKER_03]: They're also bringing, I think, the original Lords of Shadows to PC as well, so that'll be interesting.

1211
01:33:52,097 --> 01:33:53,958
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's go to the Fugle Question of the Week.

1212
01:33:54,898 --> 01:34:00,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and Google communities.

1213
01:34:01,380 --> 01:34:02,621
[SPEAKER_04]: You put it together and it's Fugle!

1214
01:34:04,947 --> 01:34:09,230
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a fun idea for this week because, you know, E3 really kicks off tomorrow.

1215
01:34:09,510 --> 01:34:13,232
[SPEAKER_04]: The show floor doesn't open until Tuesday, but there's a shit ton of press conferences tomorrow.

1216
01:34:13,912 --> 01:34:15,673
[SPEAKER_04]: And so everybody's going to be talking about this tomorrow.

1217
01:34:16,073 --> 01:34:18,735
[SPEAKER_04]: So we thought we would go to Facebook and Google and ask.

1218
01:34:18,795 --> 01:34:22,137
[SPEAKER_04]: It's that time of year to ask everyone, what's your E3 predictions?

1219
01:34:22,935 --> 01:34:26,478
[SPEAKER_04]: However, we at OLR, we like to do things a little differently and maybe a little bit silly.

1220
01:34:27,058 --> 01:34:30,601
[SPEAKER_04]: So we only want your E3 predictions in a haiku format.

1221
01:34:31,201 --> 01:34:33,863
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be five, seven, five, remember?

1222
01:34:34,684 --> 01:34:37,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Guess, OL Army, what will occur at E3?

1223
01:34:38,406 --> 01:34:40,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Games of win or fail?

1224
01:34:40,508 --> 01:34:42,209
[SPEAKER_04]: That was my haiku to the listeners.

1225
01:34:43,570 --> 01:34:44,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you look so impressed.

1226
01:34:46,107 --> 01:34:47,027
[SPEAKER_03]: That wasn't bad, actually.

1227
01:34:47,187 --> 01:34:47,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, here we go.

1228
01:34:48,188 --> 01:34:48,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Some haikus.

1229
01:34:49,128 --> 01:34:52,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, DarkSakura, I want you to count the syllables and tell me who failed.

1230
01:34:52,909 --> 01:34:54,269
[SPEAKER_04]: For the record, Rob?

1231
01:34:54,309 --> 01:34:55,389
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some fails in here.

1232
01:34:55,509 --> 01:34:56,370
[SPEAKER_10]: For the record, Rob?

1233
01:34:56,810 --> 01:34:58,350
[SPEAKER_10]: The plural of haiku is haiku.

1234
01:34:59,630 --> 01:35:00,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Haikuzis.

1235
01:35:01,771 --> 01:35:02,491
[SPEAKER_04]: The haikuza.

1236
01:35:04,091 --> 01:35:05,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to the haikuza.

1237
01:35:06,272 --> 01:35:07,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Haikuzerzis.

1238
01:35:08,152 --> 01:35:09,333
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

1239
01:35:09,353 --> 01:35:09,633
[SPEAKER_10]: Bite me.

1240
01:35:11,553 --> 01:35:12,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Haiku gaggle.

1241
01:35:12,674 --> 01:35:12,954
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1242
01:35:15,097 --> 01:35:18,120
[SPEAKER_04]: And all in good fun about those of you that fail, by the way.

1243
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:24,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Edgar R. says, Call of Duty Ghost, Dogs of War, X-Bone exclusive.

1244
01:35:25,547 --> 01:35:26,828
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Dogs of War.

1245
01:35:26,948 --> 01:35:27,569
[SPEAKER_04]: That's wrong.

1246
01:35:27,669 --> 01:35:29,271
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not a haiku.

1247
01:35:29,311 --> 01:35:29,851
[SPEAKER_10]: You lose.

1248
01:35:31,054 --> 01:35:35,596
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also already confirmed that as an exclusive to the Xbox One.

1249
01:35:36,897 --> 01:35:37,857
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate the effort.

1250
01:35:37,897 --> 01:35:39,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Porkchop sends this entry.

1251
01:35:40,398 --> 01:35:45,560
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really mind as long as they don't release more shit EA games.

1252
01:35:46,420 --> 01:35:47,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Bravo!

1253
01:35:48,981 --> 01:35:49,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Tiara.

1254
01:35:50,682 --> 01:35:54,204
[SPEAKER_04]: All I really care is about... Excuse me, I fucked that up.

1255
01:35:54,224 --> 01:35:54,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1256
01:35:54,704 --> 01:35:57,605
[SPEAKER_04]: All I really care about is Dragon Age 3.

1257
01:35:58,846 --> 01:35:59,886
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Bioware.

1258
01:36:01,388 --> 01:36:02,928
[SPEAKER_10]: No, she loves Anders.

1259
01:36:04,329 --> 01:36:05,529
[SPEAKER_10]: She loves Sir Pounce a lot.

1260
01:36:05,709 --> 01:36:07,289
[SPEAKER_04]: So she gets a fail for lying.

1261
01:36:07,649 --> 01:36:07,989
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1262
01:36:09,350 --> 01:36:09,650
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1263
01:36:10,090 --> 01:36:14,971
[SPEAKER_10]: Honestly, that's about... She named her cat Sir Pounce a lot.

1264
01:36:15,211 --> 01:36:19,231
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, this is from Mason D. Want more Pokemon?

1265
01:36:19,651 --> 01:36:23,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Pokemon versus for Wii U. Pokemon get hype.

1266
01:36:24,132 --> 01:36:26,673
[SPEAKER_10]: With a big white smiley face underneath that, no less.

1267
01:36:28,346 --> 01:36:30,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Blood Drunk submits the following.

1268
01:36:30,168 --> 01:36:31,129
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a great name.

1269
01:36:32,910 --> 01:36:33,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Blood Drunk.

1270
01:36:34,892 --> 01:36:38,295
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if Blood Drunk is a newer listener, but I've noticed his name on the VOG leaderboard.

1271
01:36:38,355 --> 01:36:40,217
[SPEAKER_04]: So he is a big participant.

1272
01:36:40,277 --> 01:36:43,940
[SPEAKER_04]: So a win to you, no matter how good or bad your haiku is.

1273
01:36:43,980 --> 01:36:44,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

1274
01:36:44,661 --> 01:36:45,302
[SPEAKER_04]: From Blood Drunk.

1275
01:36:46,002 --> 01:36:47,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Connect watches you fap.

1276
01:36:48,982 --> 01:36:50,023
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's six syllables.

1277
01:36:50,243 --> 01:36:51,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Connect watches you fap.

1278
01:36:52,105 --> 01:36:52,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Six syllables.

1279
01:36:53,105 --> 01:36:53,506
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right.

1280
01:36:53,846 --> 01:36:54,627
[SPEAKER_04]: We still like his name.

1281
01:36:54,987 --> 01:36:56,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Connect watches you fap.

1282
01:36:57,009 --> 01:36:58,730
[SPEAKER_04]: LOLPS4DRM.

1283
01:36:59,310 --> 01:37:00,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo shows games?

1284
01:37:03,334 --> 01:37:03,594
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1285
01:37:03,734 --> 01:37:04,895
[SPEAKER_10]: Not quite a haiku, but hey.

1286
01:37:05,275 --> 01:37:05,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Close enough.

1287
01:37:06,396 --> 01:37:07,137
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a haikuga.

1288
01:37:08,117 --> 01:37:08,798
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a haikuger.

1289
01:37:09,779 --> 01:37:12,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Degenerate Johnny submits the following.

1290
01:37:12,121 --> 01:37:13,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Predicting prices.

1291
01:37:14,202 --> 01:37:16,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox, five bills, four with subs.

1292
01:37:17,445 --> 01:37:17,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony, $450,000.

1293
01:37:20,554 --> 01:37:22,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Good way to put your predictions in.

1294
01:37:23,295 --> 01:37:25,456
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you might be highballing it a little bit, but we'll see.

1295
01:37:26,376 --> 01:37:28,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Haseo Sumiwagawa submits the following.

1296
01:37:29,077 --> 01:37:30,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox One fucks up.

1297
01:37:31,238 --> 01:37:33,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo might steal the show.

1298
01:37:33,598 --> 01:37:35,099
[SPEAKER_04]: PS4, ooh pretty.

1299
01:37:37,300 --> 01:37:38,220
[SPEAKER_04]: That was six syllables.

1300
01:37:38,340 --> 01:37:38,740
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right.

1301
01:37:39,680 --> 01:37:41,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Liam C. submits the following.

1302
01:37:42,041 --> 01:37:45,502
[SPEAKER_04]: The Last Guardian, a brand new Uncharted game.

1303
01:37:46,002 --> 01:37:47,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Kinect flops badly.

1304
01:37:47,923 --> 01:37:48,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

1305
01:37:49,136 --> 01:37:49,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

1306
01:37:50,517 --> 01:37:53,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Codeman says, what will E3 bring?

1307
01:37:53,638 --> 01:37:55,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo surprise maybe?

1308
01:37:56,019 --> 01:37:57,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbone will has sports.

1309
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:00,261
[SPEAKER_10]: This one just got sent to me, which I have to read.

1310
01:38:00,541 --> 01:38:00,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1311
01:38:01,121 --> 01:38:01,441
[SPEAKER_04]: From who?

1312
01:38:01,761 --> 01:38:03,102
[SPEAKER_10]: From ClericalEra404.

1313
01:38:03,242 --> 01:38:03,562
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1314
01:38:04,663 --> 01:38:06,223
[SPEAKER_10]: Sony has less trust.

1315
01:38:06,343 --> 01:38:08,824
[SPEAKER_10]: Nintendo rules us all, but it all ends well.

1316
01:38:10,485 --> 01:38:10,985
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1317
01:38:12,126 --> 01:38:12,566
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1318
01:38:12,726 --> 01:38:13,066
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1319
01:38:13,146 --> 01:38:14,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Ragenator says, E to the three.

1320
01:38:14,287 --> 01:38:15,167
[SPEAKER_04]: E to the three.

1321
01:38:16,052 --> 01:38:17,293
[SPEAKER_04]: That's four syllables.

1322
01:38:17,573 --> 01:38:18,314
[SPEAKER_04]: You lose.

1323
01:38:18,694 --> 01:38:19,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Why can't people count?

1324
01:38:21,277 --> 01:38:22,157
[SPEAKER_04]: E to the three.

1325
01:38:22,838 --> 01:38:23,238
[SPEAKER_04]: MS.

1326
01:38:23,539 --> 01:38:24,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, they didn't.

1327
01:38:25,120 --> 01:38:26,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they done screwed up.

1328
01:38:26,681 --> 01:38:27,382
[SPEAKER_10]: He could do E fucking three, yo.

1329
01:38:31,511 --> 01:38:33,412
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Captain Spike.

1330
01:38:34,253 --> 01:38:35,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's Captain Spike's submission.

1331
01:38:35,834 --> 01:38:36,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay, Spike.

1332
01:38:36,575 --> 01:38:37,235
[SPEAKER_04]: We love Spike.

1333
01:38:37,275 --> 01:38:39,357
[SPEAKER_04]: He's full of win, no matter if his haiku is fail or not.

1334
01:38:39,397 --> 01:38:39,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is.

1335
01:38:40,258 --> 01:38:41,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo no show.

1336
01:38:42,219 --> 01:38:44,080
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony and MS hate us all.

1337
01:38:44,461 --> 01:38:45,862
[SPEAKER_04]: The worst E3 ever.

1338
01:38:49,805 --> 01:38:50,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Worst E3 ever.

1339
01:38:52,086 --> 01:38:52,827
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Spike.

1340
01:38:52,947 --> 01:38:53,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's HitStun.

1341
01:38:54,875 --> 01:39:04,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Next Gen Consoles, Meh, Nothing PS3 Can't Do, Game of Show, DuckTales That's a good one.

1342
01:39:04,602 --> 01:39:05,903
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my favorite one so far, I think.

1343
01:39:06,204 --> 01:39:08,885
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you watch the last trailer they put out?

1344
01:39:09,906 --> 01:39:11,507
[SPEAKER_10]: Not since... It's the side-by-side.

1345
01:39:12,208 --> 01:39:13,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, I didn't see that one.

1346
01:39:13,309 --> 01:39:16,131
[SPEAKER_10]: They did one comparing the old DuckTales to the new one.

1347
01:39:16,951 --> 01:39:18,753
[SPEAKER_10]: Somebody on Tumblr posted it a while back.

1348
01:39:19,093 --> 01:39:21,455
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll see if I can't find it and repost it, but it was pretty neat.

1349
01:39:22,096 --> 01:39:23,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, here's SSJ100 Matt Sentry.

1350
01:39:24,557 --> 01:39:25,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Anticipation.

1351
01:39:26,479 --> 01:39:27,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Elated disappointment.

1352
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:29,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Gamers are winners.

1353
01:39:30,981 --> 01:39:33,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Wouldn't that be losers if we're disappointed, though?

1354
01:39:34,383 --> 01:39:39,246
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got excited because when he said anticipation, it made me think, oh, maybe that's the Rare franchise they're bringing back.

1355
01:39:39,526 --> 01:39:46,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Because y'all know I could give two fucks about Killer Instinct or Banjo-Kazooie when Rare could remake Anticipation.

1356
01:39:47,250 --> 01:39:47,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Just saying.

1357
01:39:48,731 --> 01:39:50,993
[SPEAKER_04]: You know you want to play as the ice cream cone again, bouncing around the board.

1358
01:39:51,193 --> 01:39:51,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Just saying.

1359
01:39:52,577 --> 01:39:53,698
[SPEAKER_10]: I want ice cream right now.

1360
01:39:53,898 --> 01:39:56,419
[SPEAKER_04]: This is from Steven M. What about another cameo?

1361
01:39:57,920 --> 01:39:58,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell no.

1362
01:39:58,961 --> 01:40:03,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Steven M. says like I had to think about what the fuck game is he talking about?

1363
01:40:03,643 --> 01:40:04,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh god.

1364
01:40:04,704 --> 01:40:08,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Steven M. Must be online Xbox.

1365
01:40:08,606 --> 01:40:09,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Wii U will die.

1366
01:40:10,347 --> 01:40:12,048
[SPEAKER_04]: We finally get Last Guardian.

1367
01:40:12,918 --> 01:40:13,418
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you did 557.

1368
01:40:13,618 --> 01:40:20,302
[SPEAKER_10]: I like especially since you gave them how to do a haiku.

1369
01:40:20,923 --> 01:40:23,604
[SPEAKER_04]: I put right there, as a reminder, a haiku is 575.

1370
01:40:23,685 --> 01:40:25,406
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't read.

1371
01:40:25,426 --> 01:40:27,267
[SPEAKER_04]: What's a syllable?

1372
01:40:29,348 --> 01:40:30,589
[SPEAKER_04]: We love our listeners.

1373
01:40:30,609 --> 01:40:32,790
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just giving you shit.

1374
01:40:32,990 --> 01:40:34,071
[SPEAKER_10]: I give everybody shit.

1375
01:40:34,111 --> 01:40:36,412
[SPEAKER_04]: We just want to educate you all this week on haikuses.

1376
01:40:36,913 --> 01:40:38,694
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, study some damn literature.

1377
01:40:38,714 --> 01:40:38,794
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck.

1378
01:40:38,854 --> 01:40:39,174
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck.

1379
01:40:40,789 --> 01:40:41,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that a haiku?

1380
01:40:44,512 --> 01:40:46,253
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not quite.

1381
01:40:46,333 --> 01:40:47,394
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll make one, though, if you like.

1382
01:40:47,594 --> 01:40:47,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1383
01:40:48,254 --> 01:40:49,955
[SPEAKER_04]: You think of one while I read the rest of these.

1384
01:40:50,096 --> 01:40:50,376
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1385
01:40:50,556 --> 01:40:53,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Andy R. says, I don't really know.

1386
01:40:53,898 --> 01:40:55,339
[SPEAKER_04]: A giant enemy crab?

1387
01:40:55,960 --> 01:40:56,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Ridge Racer 2.

1388
01:40:58,241 --> 01:41:00,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Ridge Racer 2 is four syllables.

1389
01:41:01,623 --> 01:41:02,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Andy, you're killing me.

1390
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:03,925
[SPEAKER_04]: That would have been great for 2006.

1391
01:41:07,469 --> 01:41:09,992
[SPEAKER_04]: What I want this year is to see really good games and VOG to hit big.

1392
01:41:23,139 --> 01:41:26,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody kissing a little VOG behind in that response.

1393
01:41:26,202 --> 01:41:26,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Love it.

1394
01:41:26,522 --> 01:41:27,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Actdeft.

1395
01:41:27,723 --> 01:41:30,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Flaco Jones says, Xbox and Sony.

1396
01:41:31,345 --> 01:41:33,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Their DRM kills gaming.

1397
01:41:33,567 --> 01:41:34,487
[SPEAKER_04]: What's a Nintendo?

1398
01:41:34,868 --> 01:41:35,508
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I got one.

1399
01:41:35,808 --> 01:41:36,049
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1400
01:41:36,829 --> 01:41:37,790
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me make sure I have it right.

1401
01:41:38,310 --> 01:41:39,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let me read.

1402
01:41:39,051 --> 01:41:39,691
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll do yours last.

1403
01:41:39,831 --> 01:41:40,612
[SPEAKER_04]: We do the rest of these.

1404
01:41:40,712 --> 01:41:41,032
[SPEAKER_10]: Forget it.

1405
01:41:41,212 --> 01:41:41,412
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1406
01:41:42,013 --> 01:41:42,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, go.

1407
01:41:43,314 --> 01:41:44,174
[SPEAKER_10]: Use the internet.

1408
01:41:44,815 --> 01:41:46,736
[SPEAKER_10]: There are haiku examples.

1409
01:41:48,097 --> 01:41:48,297
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on.

1410
01:41:48,358 --> 01:41:50,119
[SPEAKER_10]: There are haiku examples.

1411
01:41:50,259 --> 01:41:50,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1412
01:41:50,539 --> 01:41:51,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1413
01:41:52,421 --> 01:41:53,742
[SPEAKER_10]: Really use Google.

1414
01:41:55,183 --> 01:41:55,563
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1415
01:41:57,064 --> 01:41:57,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck.

1416
01:41:57,565 --> 01:41:57,785
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1417
01:41:57,845 --> 01:42:01,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Technus says use some fucking Google.

1418
01:42:01,888 --> 01:42:02,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, it doesn't work.

1419
01:42:02,468 --> 01:42:03,549
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1420
01:42:04,410 --> 01:42:06,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Technus says people still complain.

1421
01:42:07,091 --> 01:42:09,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Rare shows next gen Battletoads.

1422
01:42:09,473 --> 01:42:10,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you still hating?

1423
01:42:12,293 --> 01:42:12,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Never know.

1424
01:42:13,674 --> 01:42:16,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Redertainment says, oh, it's a double haiku.

1425
01:42:17,437 --> 01:42:19,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Redertainment's always got to fucking show everybody up.

1426
01:42:19,799 --> 01:42:20,019
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1427
01:42:20,379 --> 01:42:20,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

1428
01:42:20,819 --> 01:42:21,080
[SPEAKER_10]: That's okay.

1429
01:42:21,100 --> 01:42:21,480
[SPEAKER_10]: I love it.

1430
01:42:21,640 --> 01:42:21,860
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1431
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:24,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Redertainment says, gamers hate everything.

1432
01:42:25,203 --> 01:42:26,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything will receive scorn.

1433
01:42:27,224 --> 01:42:28,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Twitter will explode.

1434
01:42:29,166 --> 01:42:29,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Good one.

1435
01:42:29,746 --> 01:42:33,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Gamers will not see a wanted not seen project.

1436
01:42:33,629 --> 01:42:34,650
[SPEAKER_04]: The Last Guardian.

1437
01:42:35,450 --> 01:42:35,831
[SPEAKER_10]: We got it.

1438
01:42:36,771 --> 01:42:38,733
[SPEAKER_10]: Since he did two, we got another one from Clerical Error.

1439
01:42:39,161 --> 01:42:40,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, wait, let me read this last one from Google+.

1440
01:42:41,442 --> 01:42:43,602
[SPEAKER_04]: From Travis H. Sony is epic.

1441
01:42:44,183 --> 01:42:45,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbone will be eaten up.

1442
01:42:46,043 --> 01:42:47,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Long live PlayStation.

1443
01:42:48,864 --> 01:42:50,344
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see how that press conference goes.

1444
01:42:50,464 --> 01:42:52,825
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm approaching it with cautious optimism, Travis.

1445
01:42:53,045 --> 01:42:53,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Cautious optimism.

1446
01:42:54,646 --> 01:42:55,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, last but not least.

1447
01:42:56,126 --> 01:42:58,807
[SPEAKER_10]: Nintendo has props, but Sony has some issues.

1448
01:42:59,007 --> 01:42:59,787
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess we should wait.

1449
01:43:01,488 --> 01:43:02,168
[SPEAKER_10]: That one was good.

1450
01:43:03,161 --> 01:43:22,683
[SPEAKER_04]: YYR in chat can't you people count you have offended Jamie study some damn books you win the internet YYR Xbox One console TV TV TV sports what's wrong deal with it that's good did you do that one by yourself I just did that I love it I love it

1451
01:43:24,429 --> 01:43:34,830
[SPEAKER_04]: after I posted the question use that Mensa thing for something there you go Jamie came to me tonight she said you should make every week be a haiku because they're short alright

1452
01:43:37,375 --> 01:43:39,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, and SSJ100 Matt bringing some clarity.

1453
01:43:40,396 --> 01:43:43,116
[SPEAKER_04]: Anticipation because gamers are anticipating a lot for E3.

1454
01:43:43,356 --> 01:43:46,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Elated disappointment because people will be either happy or disappointed.

1455
01:43:46,657 --> 01:43:51,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Gamers are winners because no matter what gamers win because we have all these new games to play.

1456
01:43:52,198 --> 01:43:52,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1457
01:43:52,898 --> 01:43:53,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1458
01:43:53,878 --> 01:43:54,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1459
01:43:54,419 --> 01:43:57,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, I know we gave some of you a bad time, but that was a really fun topic.

1460
01:43:57,539 --> 01:43:58,739
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you everybody for trying.

1461
01:43:58,899 --> 01:43:59,860
[SPEAKER_10]: I love you, YYR.

1462
01:44:00,300 --> 01:44:00,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1463
01:44:02,380 --> 01:44:03,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I need to give you two a moment?

1464
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:04,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Should I sit back?

1465
01:44:04,461 --> 01:44:04,621
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1466
01:44:04,641 --> 01:44:05,601
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't love you in that way.

1467
01:44:05,821 --> 01:44:06,061
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

1468
01:44:07,796 --> 01:44:10,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, just a few more stories and then listless tonight.

1469
01:44:10,357 --> 01:44:11,077
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, Loki.

1470
01:44:12,138 --> 01:44:12,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1471
01:44:13,278 --> 01:44:15,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Codeman is reminding me that I need to play more Borderlands 2.

1472
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:18,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I haven't touched it on PC yet.

1473
01:44:19,141 --> 01:44:21,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though I finished the game like three times on 360.

1474
01:44:23,563 --> 01:44:27,064
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, unfortunately there was some massive layoffs at Zynga.

1475
01:44:28,085 --> 01:44:32,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Also including the closure of OMG Pop.

1476
01:44:34,088 --> 01:44:36,611
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they closed the office there.

1477
01:44:36,891 --> 01:44:43,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, they closed the Zynga office in Los Angeles, Dallas, and New York.

1478
01:44:47,038 --> 01:44:49,519
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there was layoffs in all of their offices.

1479
01:44:49,539 --> 01:44:56,761
[SPEAKER_03]: I think about 520 or 540 or something like that.

1480
01:44:57,601 --> 01:44:58,461
[SPEAKER_03]: People were laid off.

1481
01:44:58,481 --> 01:45:00,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I was reaching out to one of my friends.

1482
01:45:01,442 --> 01:45:07,164
[SPEAKER_03]: She's a concept artist and artist over at Zynga in San Francisco.

1483
01:45:07,204 --> 01:45:08,544
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, though, she's pretty high up.

1484
01:45:08,744 --> 01:45:10,865
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think she's affected by it.

1485
01:45:11,983 --> 01:45:12,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that kind of sucks.

1486
01:45:14,444 --> 01:45:30,414
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, a lot of horror stories coming out about how things were run and stuff like that and how they were talking about the terms they used for cloning things, like taking games like Tiny Tower and turning them into Dream Heights or whatever.

1487
01:45:33,095 --> 01:45:33,375
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1488
01:45:33,535 --> 01:45:34,256
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of sickening.

1489
01:45:37,217 --> 01:45:38,758
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe this is the beginning of the end.

1490
01:45:39,519 --> 01:45:41,720
[SPEAKER_03]: This is surely not too good for them.

1491
01:45:45,262 --> 01:45:55,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, I don't like to poke fun or tease or celebrate layoffs, especially like Loki says, he has friends that are at Zynga and so forth.

1492
01:45:55,829 --> 01:45:59,672
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, we always knew Zynga had a really questionable business model.

1493
01:45:59,792 --> 01:46:03,775
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think people bought into that way too fast.

1494
01:46:03,835 --> 01:46:06,877
[SPEAKER_04]: And Zynga expanded way too fast over Farmville.

1495
01:46:07,437 --> 01:46:11,280
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it just goes to show Farmville was kind of a one-hit wonder, I hate to say.

1496
01:46:11,940 --> 01:46:12,480
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know.

1497
01:46:12,520 --> 01:46:17,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Some would argue with me that, well, there were other Facebook's games and blah, blah, blah, blah, but... Well, it's like this.

1498
01:46:17,522 --> 01:46:20,923
[SPEAKER_04]: When the news came out about them copying games, I mean, that was just shitty.

1499
01:46:21,183 --> 01:46:27,585
[SPEAKER_10]: A-ha had good albums and good music, but the only song anyone ever cared about was Take On Me.

1500
01:46:28,165 --> 01:46:31,906
[SPEAKER_04]: That is quite possibly the best possible comparison somebody could have made in this scenario.

1501
01:46:32,046 --> 01:46:39,109
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, remember, I had that thing of Dan singing the lyrics to the synth part with One Hit Wonder instead of the...

1502
01:46:40,544 --> 01:46:45,988
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, before I get to the next news story, I just got a text message, and I'll let you guess where this is from, DarkSakura.

1503
01:46:46,008 --> 01:46:46,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you ready?

1504
01:46:46,849 --> 01:46:48,890
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, here's the text message I just got.

1505
01:46:49,611 --> 01:46:51,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Haiku game is weak.

1506
01:46:51,693 --> 01:46:53,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes we just can't even.

1507
01:46:53,714 --> 01:46:54,835
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura mad.

1508
01:46:56,136 --> 01:46:56,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Girl.

1509
01:46:56,776 --> 01:46:57,317
[SPEAKER_04]: It's from Alan.

1510
01:46:57,457 --> 01:46:57,717
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1511
01:46:59,979 --> 01:47:00,559
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that was good.

1512
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:02,401
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's see.

1513
01:47:02,421 --> 01:47:05,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Going into some news about the Ouya.

1514
01:47:06,741 --> 01:47:07,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Sonic the Hedgehog 4, Sonic CD

1515
01:47:25,658 --> 01:47:28,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, still, though, it's Sega support for the Ouya, so that's kind of cool.

1516
01:47:28,901 --> 01:47:30,183
[SPEAKER_04]: How about some Phantasy Star Online?

1517
01:47:30,203 --> 01:47:30,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, huh?

1518
01:47:30,803 --> 01:47:31,063
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1519
01:47:31,344 --> 01:47:32,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that's wishful thinking.

1520
01:47:32,645 --> 01:47:35,808
[SPEAKER_04]: They're coming out on June 27th in the Ouya store, $7 each.

1521
01:47:35,928 --> 01:47:40,112
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Episode 1, Episode 2, and Sonic CD.

1522
01:47:40,533 --> 01:47:46,959
[SPEAKER_04]: No idea if the Ouya version will include fun for Sonic the Hedgehog 4, because unfortunately that was missing in the earlier versions.

1523
01:47:48,020 --> 01:47:48,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody?

1524
01:47:48,580 --> 01:47:48,801
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1525
01:47:50,302 --> 01:47:57,664
[SPEAKER_04]: The Ouya ports, they say, are optimized for the console's Tegra 3 processor and free trial versions will be available.

1526
01:47:58,424 --> 01:48:10,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Sega of America director of mobile business, David Zemke, interesting where this is coming from, was praising Ouya's, quote, disruptive technology and, quote, they want to see what these technologies can do and be a part of it from the beginning.

1527
01:48:11,028 --> 01:48:15,349
[SPEAKER_04]: We're always looking for other titles and there may be some future titles that we'd like to bring over.

1528
01:48:15,709 --> 01:48:20,271
[SPEAKER_04]: For us, we're always trying to bring the best gaming experience to the right platforms.

1529
01:48:20,611 --> 01:48:23,213
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a delicate mix of how and when to do it.

1530
01:48:24,533 --> 01:48:24,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

1531
01:48:25,334 --> 01:48:28,135
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right after the launch of the OUYA, by the way, which is June 25th.

1532
01:48:28,495 --> 01:48:30,236
[SPEAKER_04]: The day before my birthday, y'all.

1533
01:48:30,256 --> 01:48:30,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Just saying.

1534
01:48:31,537 --> 01:48:31,817
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1535
01:48:33,478 --> 01:48:33,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

1536
01:48:36,099 --> 01:48:38,320
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, one more story and then we'll get into Listless tonight.

1537
01:48:38,620 --> 01:48:40,861
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, we were just having a discussion about Turian's mutt.

1538
01:48:42,242 --> 01:48:42,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.

1539
01:48:43,463 --> 01:48:43,983
[SPEAKER_10]: No, not really.

1540
01:48:45,364 --> 01:49:02,298
[SPEAKER_10]: Something from Double Fine, the game Massive Chalice, that basically, as they were saying that there was going to be a gay relationship in the game that had been taken out, and now the project leader feels shitty because people on Kickstarter say, no, we want it.

1541
01:49:02,879 --> 01:49:03,759
[SPEAKER_10]: So he's putting it in.

1542
01:49:05,112 --> 01:49:05,432
[SPEAKER_10]: As of today.

1543
01:49:35,784 --> 01:49:36,665
[SPEAKER_10]: All that from feedback.

1544
01:49:37,406 --> 01:49:38,107
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what you want.

1545
01:49:38,147 --> 01:49:38,887
[SPEAKER_10]: We're putting it back in.

1546
01:49:39,048 --> 01:49:48,817
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of cool though because that makes it seem like Kickstarter really is a place for like... Not to say they're investors or whatever because Kickstarter is with the backing or whatever but that they get a say.

1547
01:49:48,918 --> 01:49:50,359
[SPEAKER_04]: That these people really had a say.

1548
01:49:50,519 --> 01:49:50,860
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah.

1549
01:49:51,480 --> 01:49:59,708
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, if you look at it this way, it is probably the best type of board meeting you can ever expect because you've got real-time feedback going in.

1550
01:50:00,688 --> 01:50:00,989
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1551
01:50:01,009 --> 01:50:01,569
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think it's good.

1552
01:50:02,070 --> 01:50:05,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this something that you would consider backing or a game that you might think you're going to buy?

1553
01:50:06,053 --> 01:50:09,577
[SPEAKER_10]: I told you what I'm waiting for for my first backing.

1554
01:50:10,257 --> 01:50:10,738
[SPEAKER_04]: No, what?

1555
01:50:11,598 --> 01:50:17,684
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, unless he's already put it up, I'm waiting for the understanding video games.

1556
01:50:19,696 --> 01:50:20,077
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember.

1557
01:50:20,097 --> 01:50:21,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you refresh my memory about this?

1558
01:50:21,198 --> 01:50:21,819
[SPEAKER_10]: That Seg's doing?

1559
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:25,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1560
01:50:25,563 --> 01:50:28,006
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted... There was another name it was, though.

1561
01:50:28,667 --> 01:50:29,788
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, he hasn't put it up yet.

1562
01:50:29,848 --> 01:50:30,629
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think he's going to.

1563
01:50:30,849 --> 01:50:33,272
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to give my Kickstarter cherry to Seg.

1564
01:50:35,294 --> 01:50:36,555
[SPEAKER_10]: Love, love, love, love.

1565
01:50:37,135 --> 01:50:39,516
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a fair place to give your Kickstarter, Terry.

1566
01:50:39,676 --> 01:50:39,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1567
01:50:40,376 --> 01:50:41,617
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1568
01:50:43,038 --> 01:50:44,378
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to get this.

1569
01:50:44,699 --> 01:50:49,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're going to do listless now, except I'm having a little problem with the connection.

1570
01:50:50,121 --> 01:50:51,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see if we can get it there.

1571
01:50:52,082 --> 01:50:58,225
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to call an old friend of ours here at Orange Lounge Radio to help us out with Listless tonight, and hopefully the internet will hold up.

1572
01:50:58,666 --> 01:50:59,846
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think we're connected now.

1573
01:50:59,886 --> 01:51:00,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you there, old friend?

1574
01:51:01,427 --> 01:51:01,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

1575
01:51:02,128 --> 01:51:03,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Bobby Blackwolf, how you doing?

1576
01:51:04,329 --> 01:51:05,249
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing good.

1577
01:51:05,410 --> 01:51:06,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob called you old.

1578
01:51:06,550 --> 01:51:08,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Shouldn't he be like old chum?

1579
01:51:08,711 --> 01:51:11,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm not Adam West in Batman, okay?

1580
01:51:12,153 --> 01:51:12,834
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing, Bobby?

1581
01:51:13,494 --> 01:51:14,034
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing good.

1582
01:51:14,054 --> 01:51:16,556
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been playing Animal Crossing since I got off the air.

1583
01:51:16,696 --> 01:51:17,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally have time to get into that, huh?

1584
01:51:17,877 --> 01:51:18,537
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think so far?

1585
01:51:19,629 --> 01:51:40,649
[SPEAKER_10]: it's Animal Crossing I'm very sad because everybody else has this and I don't even have a 3DS so whatever you gotta bug Dan no because I don't have a job so we're not buying one you have to have a J-O-B to have a 3DS you're gonna need to get on MTurk I've even already been in someone else's town so my fruit collection is growing wow

1586
01:51:41,249 --> 01:51:42,130
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1587
01:52:05,729 --> 01:52:06,670
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1588
01:52:26,625 --> 01:52:28,046
[SPEAKER_05]: I used Pico.

1589
01:52:28,126 --> 01:52:28,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1590
01:52:47,075 --> 01:52:48,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Pine was the male.

1591
01:52:48,136 --> 01:52:49,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, one was email and one was Pico.

1592
01:52:50,857 --> 01:52:52,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Shows you my knowledge of Unix.

1593
01:52:52,178 --> 01:52:53,219
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't used it in a while.

1594
01:52:53,559 --> 01:52:57,901
[SPEAKER_04]: But you coded away in VI this new E3.VOGnetwork.com.

1595
01:52:57,921 --> 01:52:59,462
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you hoping comes of this?

1596
01:53:01,981 --> 01:53:02,442
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1597
01:53:03,042 --> 01:53:06,105
[SPEAKER_05]: This is me saying, this is an idea I have.

1598
01:53:06,545 --> 01:53:07,526
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if it'll work.

1599
01:53:07,986 --> 01:53:11,750
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the past, I've had these ideas, and they didn't work, and then two years later, everybody's doing them.

1600
01:53:12,330 --> 01:53:14,572
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see if this is another one of those.

1601
01:53:14,912 --> 01:53:15,333
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1602
01:53:15,593 --> 01:53:21,818
[SPEAKER_04]: So be sure to check it out, guys, if you haven't seen it yet, e3.vognetwork.com, especially those of you listening on the podcast.

1603
01:53:22,519 --> 01:53:25,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything will open up on Monday night for the question and answer.

1604
01:53:25,281 --> 01:53:28,284
[SPEAKER_04]: But tonight, live, you can at least watch the video.

1605
01:53:28,784 --> 01:53:34,070
[SPEAKER_04]: and learn everything you're going to need to know for when everything goes live with the question asking.

1606
01:53:34,331 --> 01:53:40,117
[SPEAKER_03]: I've already been given the blacklist against asking anything about Hello Kitty games, so I'm not going to do that.

1607
01:53:41,339 --> 01:53:41,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair enough.

1608
01:53:42,460 --> 01:53:42,760
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1609
01:53:44,082 --> 01:53:46,184
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're leaving for E3 tomorrow, right?

1610
01:53:46,845 --> 01:53:47,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

1611
01:53:47,145 --> 01:53:47,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Tomorrow morning.

1612
01:53:47,846 --> 01:53:48,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1613
01:53:48,187 --> 01:53:49,388
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's your very first appointment?

1614
01:53:52,425 --> 01:53:53,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Bethesda, I think.

1615
01:53:54,507 --> 01:53:55,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think it's Bethesda.

1616
01:53:56,128 --> 01:53:56,889
[SPEAKER_05]: It's at two o'clock.

1617
01:53:56,909 --> 01:54:01,594
[SPEAKER_05]: That way I can get there and see things from noon to two and kind of get my way to land.

1618
01:54:01,614 --> 01:54:03,015
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think, yeah, it's Bethesda at two.

1619
01:54:04,036 --> 01:54:07,800
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we're about to get into the listless here about thing I most want to happen at E3 2013.

1620
01:54:08,320 --> 01:54:14,226
[SPEAKER_04]: But seriously, off the record, what are you personally like looking forward to getting your hands on yourself and checking out?

1621
01:54:16,417 --> 01:54:20,498
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my standard answer, and everybody calls it a cop-out, but I don't care.

1622
01:54:20,699 --> 01:54:22,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no, I know what you're going to say, and I think it's a great answer.

1623
01:54:23,100 --> 01:54:25,401
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the game I haven't heard of yet.

1624
01:54:26,497 --> 01:54:27,238
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1625
01:54:47,301 --> 01:54:47,701
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura.com

1626
01:55:07,472 --> 01:55:07,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Catamari Damacy

1627
01:55:22,972 --> 01:55:24,774
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1628
01:55:38,431 --> 01:55:43,056
[SPEAKER_04]: All seriousness though, we are going to play listless here, but there's one other reason I have you here tonight.

1629
01:55:43,536 --> 01:55:48,240
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's been a theme here at VOG Network the past couple weeks, and that is that the game is always changing.

1630
01:55:48,801 --> 01:55:51,584
[SPEAKER_04]: And the game is changing again tonight, isn't it Bobby?

1631
01:55:52,084 --> 01:55:52,745
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1632
01:55:53,065 --> 01:55:53,686
[SPEAKER_04]: What is new?

1633
01:55:53,726 --> 01:55:56,248
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you do for us this week?

1634
01:55:56,268 --> 01:55:57,809
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you're logged into the site.

1635
01:55:58,556 --> 01:56:04,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody, because you no longer have to learn how to private message Rob to play listless.

1636
01:56:05,064 --> 01:56:11,151
[SPEAKER_05]: If you've ever done any of the live polls here on VOG, then you kind of know where to look.

1637
01:56:12,172 --> 01:56:13,113
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where you're going to want to look.

1638
01:56:13,654 --> 01:56:13,974
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1639
01:56:14,495 --> 01:56:17,058
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that, it's time to start some listless.

1640
01:56:20,492 --> 01:56:21,613
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1641
01:56:36,790 --> 01:56:37,891
[SPEAKER_04]: at E3 2013.

1642
01:56:39,112 --> 01:56:42,714
[SPEAKER_04]: And once everything is up on the list, then we will go around and this is what has to happen.

1643
01:56:42,754 --> 01:56:45,696
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to strike the items that are not worthy of the list.

1644
01:56:46,016 --> 01:56:49,198
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very difficult, painful process, but it must be done.

1645
01:56:49,578 --> 01:56:57,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, there is a new rule that is still in play, however, and that is that when a host has two items eliminated from the list, the third gets immunity.

1646
01:56:57,603 --> 01:56:59,865
[SPEAKER_04]: So a person's list cannot be completely decimated.

1647
01:57:00,285 --> 01:57:01,026
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, here it is.

1648
01:57:01,106 --> 01:57:04,568
[SPEAKER_04]: The topic, thing I most want to happen at E3 2013.

1649
01:57:06,489 --> 01:57:16,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's put it up on the board at live.vognetwork.com For those of you that are logged in right now, you will start to see the board and our answers as we fill it in.

1650
01:57:17,553 --> 01:57:18,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully, right Bobby?

1651
01:57:18,594 --> 01:57:19,974
[SPEAKER_04]: That's also part of the reason you're on the line.

1652
01:57:20,775 --> 01:57:21,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1653
01:57:21,895 --> 01:57:23,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I made it live.

1654
01:57:23,556 --> 01:57:23,876
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

1655
01:57:24,696 --> 01:57:25,657
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm keeping a watch on it.

1656
01:57:53,888 --> 01:57:57,669
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm going to say the easy answer, a new F-Zero.

1657
01:58:00,150 --> 01:58:03,912
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think that's a very good, safe answer.

1658
01:58:04,192 --> 01:58:07,993
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that is one that can't possibly get eliminated no matter what happens.

1659
01:58:08,374 --> 01:58:09,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, that's always famous last words.

1660
01:58:10,314 --> 01:58:11,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thanks for dooming that answer.

1661
01:58:12,936 --> 01:58:14,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's put it up on the board.

1662
01:58:14,337 --> 01:58:16,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby locks in a new F-Zero.

1663
01:58:16,458 --> 01:58:21,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, DarkSakura, what is the number three thing that you want to see happen at E3 2013?

1664
01:58:22,401 --> 01:58:27,924
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, it's probably, it won't happen, but I would love to have Sega announce that they're back in the console business.

1665
01:58:29,004 --> 01:58:31,645
[SPEAKER_10]: It won't happen, but it's what I want.

1666
01:58:33,006 --> 01:58:36,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Sega is back in the console business.

1667
01:58:36,588 --> 01:58:37,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's put it up on the board.

1668
01:58:37,628 --> 01:58:38,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Dreamcast 2?

1669
01:58:40,635 --> 01:58:43,637
[SPEAKER_08]: They should call it the Sega Utopia.

1670
01:58:44,758 --> 01:58:45,619
[SPEAKER_04]: The Sega Utopia.

1671
01:58:46,019 --> 01:58:48,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, my turn for a number three answer.

1672
01:58:49,061 --> 01:59:03,511
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to say... I'm going to have to figure out how to fit this in the board, but my number three answer is the Microsoft server crashes at the show causing all the Xbox Ones to stop playing games after Wednesday.

1673
01:59:03,531 --> 01:59:04,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1674
01:59:04,813 --> 01:59:07,880
[SPEAKER_04]: because you know every 24 hours it's got to check in, right?

1675
01:59:08,782 --> 01:59:12,230
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Microsoft server crashes for 24 hours.

1676
01:59:12,270 --> 01:59:13,273
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's how I'll shorten it.

1677
01:59:20,508 --> 01:59:22,029
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, putting that up on the board right now.

1678
01:59:23,209 --> 01:59:24,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Boy, Bobby would be very sad.

1679
01:59:25,071 --> 01:59:30,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby, wouldn't you be sad if you didn't get to play an Xbox One and then all of a sudden the servers crash for 24 hours?

1680
01:59:32,115 --> 01:59:35,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but then I'd laugh.

1681
01:59:35,978 --> 01:59:36,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you'd laugh.

1682
01:59:36,558 --> 01:59:36,798
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1683
01:59:37,499 --> 01:59:38,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, your number three answer.

1684
01:59:40,001 --> 01:59:47,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, just because I want to get this out of the way, Microsoft and Sony go back on their plans for DRM.

1685
01:59:47,535 --> 01:59:48,897
[SPEAKER_03]: It stays the way it is now.

1686
01:59:50,555 --> 01:59:54,056
[SPEAKER_04]: I love how you threw in and Sony when we don't really know yet.

1687
01:59:54,136 --> 01:59:54,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we know.

1688
01:59:56,897 --> 01:59:57,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's be honest.

1689
01:59:57,697 --> 01:59:58,997
[SPEAKER_04]: No one's kidding themselves.

1690
01:59:59,157 --> 02:00:00,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, fair enough.

1691
02:00:00,838 --> 02:00:01,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's put that up on the board.

1692
02:00:01,738 --> 02:00:05,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki says MS and Sony go back on their DRM plans.

1693
02:00:05,739 --> 02:00:09,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Bobby, we're to you for your number two answer tonight for Listless.

1694
02:00:09,700 --> 02:00:11,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Thing you most want to see happen at E3 2013.

1695
02:00:12,821 --> 02:00:17,462
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see E3 announce that Kensha Hall will be returning next year.

1696
02:00:18,939 --> 02:00:19,920
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn it, you stole mine.

1697
02:00:21,461 --> 02:00:21,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, really?

1698
02:00:22,081 --> 02:00:23,042
[SPEAKER_04]: You had that on your list.

1699
02:00:23,162 --> 02:00:23,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-oh.

1700
02:00:23,542 --> 02:00:23,882
[SPEAKER_04]: I did.

1701
02:00:23,902 --> 02:00:24,503
[SPEAKER_04]: These things happen.

1702
02:00:24,523 --> 02:00:25,543
[SPEAKER_04]: You better check the chat room.

1703
02:00:25,683 --> 02:00:26,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby just threw that up on the board.

1704
02:00:26,924 --> 02:00:29,446
[SPEAKER_04]: E3 announces the return of Kensha Hall.

1705
02:00:30,706 --> 02:00:33,168
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe a new ex-Tango that goes with that.

1706
02:00:33,208 --> 02:00:33,588
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1707
02:00:34,189 --> 02:00:34,589
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1708
02:00:35,029 --> 02:00:37,291
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, DarkSakura, what's your number two answer?

1709
02:00:38,812 --> 02:00:44,015
[SPEAKER_10]: Sony uses Final Fantasy VII to display an engine without a release of Final Fantasy VII Remake.

1710
02:00:45,538 --> 02:00:52,568
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically they're going to repeat what they did with PlayStation 3 and show a Final Fantasy tech demo that never happens.

1711
02:00:52,629 --> 02:00:54,832
[SPEAKER_10]: Final Fantasy tech demo that never results in a game.

1712
02:00:54,852 --> 02:00:58,878
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be awesome if it was in a new Final Fantasy engine.

1713
02:00:59,659 --> 02:00:59,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey!

1714
02:00:59,919 --> 02:01:02,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it looks like Advent Children.

1715
02:01:02,481 --> 02:01:03,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope, never gonna get it.

1716
02:01:03,442 --> 02:01:04,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I'm gonna put this up on the board.

1717
02:01:05,044 --> 02:01:08,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy VII PS4 tech demo that never is a real game.

1718
02:01:08,667 --> 02:01:08,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1719
02:01:08,927 --> 02:01:12,630
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that should fit within the confines of our shiny new board.

1720
02:01:13,230 --> 02:01:19,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Live.VogNetwork.com Again, if you are listening live on this Sunday night, be ready to participate because you're gonna vote through the site as well.

1721
02:01:19,235 --> 02:01:23,699
[SPEAKER_10]: Live.VogNetwork.com I mean, granted, if Final Fantasy VII was remade, yeah, I'd play it.

1722
02:01:24,900 --> 02:01:26,081
[SPEAKER_10]: But, let's be realistic.

1723
02:01:28,431 --> 02:01:28,931
[SPEAKER_04]: My turn.

1724
02:01:29,451 --> 02:01:30,331
[SPEAKER_04]: My number two answer.

1725
02:01:31,052 --> 02:01:37,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo announces their plan to win the new generation of gaming by adding porn to Miiverse.

1726
02:01:39,035 --> 02:01:39,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?

1727
02:01:39,556 --> 02:01:42,057
[SPEAKER_04]: The Miiverse porn channel.

1728
02:01:42,937 --> 02:01:44,278
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's WiiWiiverse.

1729
02:01:49,380 --> 02:01:52,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, that's how you win the console wars.

1730
02:01:52,486 --> 02:01:54,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I'm gonna throw that up on the board.

1731
02:01:55,693 --> 02:01:57,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Loki, your number two answer.

1732
02:01:58,057 --> 02:01:59,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Super Mario RPG 2.

1733
02:02:02,352 --> 02:02:05,574
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll never fucking happen, Loki.

1734
02:02:05,694 --> 02:02:06,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Why, though?

1735
02:02:06,374 --> 02:02:08,175
[SPEAKER_03]: It's such a fantastic game.

1736
02:02:08,536 --> 02:02:11,037
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sorry, I understand that there are the Paper Mario games.

1737
02:02:11,377 --> 02:02:13,619
[SPEAKER_03]: And granted, Super Paper Mario was actually a pretty fun game.

1738
02:02:13,679 --> 02:02:15,840
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually one of the games I liked the most on the Wii.

1739
02:02:16,280 --> 02:02:18,521
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would just like a sequel.

1740
02:02:18,721 --> 02:02:19,962
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Square Enix, come on.

1741
02:02:20,182 --> 02:02:20,983
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be awesome.

1742
02:02:21,543 --> 02:02:23,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we'll throw that up on the board.

1743
02:02:23,504 --> 02:02:25,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, it's time for the number one answers.

1744
02:02:25,485 --> 02:02:29,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go around and collect them for the thing you most want to see happen at E3 2013.

1745
02:02:30,668 --> 02:02:31,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby Blackwolf, our guest.

1746
02:02:33,314 --> 02:02:34,194
[SPEAKER_05]: So picture this.

1747
02:02:36,736 --> 02:02:43,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Somehow, Valve does some kind of event, goes on their own stage, press conference.

1748
02:02:44,940 --> 02:02:45,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's in there.

1749
02:02:46,781 --> 02:02:48,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Gabe Newell walks out on stage.

1750
02:02:50,443 --> 02:02:54,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Half-Life 3, available right now, drops the mic and walks off stage.

1751
02:02:57,717 --> 02:02:58,998
[SPEAKER_10]: That would win E3.

1752
02:03:04,284 --> 02:03:08,269
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm typing that up as Half-Life 3 announcement followed by mic drop.

1753
02:03:09,770 --> 02:03:10,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Sound fair?

1754
02:03:11,132 --> 02:03:11,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Release.

1755
02:03:12,073 --> 02:03:13,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, excuse me.

1756
02:03:13,334 --> 02:03:13,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me.

1757
02:03:16,826 --> 02:03:18,067
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what's your number one answer?

1758
02:03:18,187 --> 02:03:19,928
[SPEAKER_04]: The new Mass Effect announced with good writing

1759
02:03:45,094 --> 02:03:47,935
[SPEAKER_04]: New Mass Effect announced, but with good writing.

1760
02:03:48,415 --> 02:03:48,855
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is.

1761
02:03:48,915 --> 02:03:51,736
[SPEAKER_04]: It's up on the board and I totally know which answer Bobby's going to strike.

1762
02:03:51,916 --> 02:03:52,416
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

1763
02:03:52,716 --> 02:03:56,137
[SPEAKER_10]: If Bobby touches it, I will get... Never mind.

1764
02:03:56,197 --> 02:03:56,997
[SPEAKER_10]: I won't even say it.

1765
02:03:57,957 --> 02:03:58,357
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1766
02:03:58,577 --> 02:04:00,118
[SPEAKER_10]: You leave my Mass Effect alone.

1767
02:04:01,638 --> 02:04:03,218
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a scientific process, DarkSakura.

1768
02:04:03,498 --> 02:04:03,758
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1769
02:04:03,898 --> 02:04:05,119
[SPEAKER_04]: My number one answer.

1770
02:04:05,759 --> 02:04:07,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Take faith in this, DarkSakura.

1771
02:04:07,079 --> 02:04:08,960
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you will be okay with this as a backup.

1772
02:04:09,040 --> 02:04:12,420
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you will because my answer is... If Bobby doesn't get rid of it too.

1773
02:04:12,640 --> 02:04:13,041
[SPEAKER_04]: He might.

1774
02:04:13,361 --> 02:04:14,181
[SPEAKER_04]: My answer is...

1775
02:04:14,921 --> 02:04:21,850
[SPEAKER_04]: The Guardian Legend 2 on Wii U. Technically, there was a Guardian Legend 2.

1776
02:04:22,431 --> 02:04:23,633
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the one that we got in the US.

1777
02:04:24,894 --> 02:04:25,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

1778
02:04:25,195 --> 02:04:25,775
[SPEAKER_04]: That was Guardic 2.

1779
02:04:26,056 --> 02:04:26,536
[SPEAKER_04]: You shut up.

1780
02:04:27,137 --> 02:04:27,478
[SPEAKER_10]: Fine.

1781
02:04:28,584 --> 02:04:32,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Preferably WayForward would somehow be involved because they're really good at retro boots.

1782
02:04:32,107 --> 02:04:34,969
[SPEAKER_10]: RageFader said Garrus gets his own game.

1783
02:04:35,690 --> 02:04:38,792
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be like a Silent Scope Turian edition.

1784
02:04:40,294 --> 02:04:44,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, last but not least, Loki, one spot left on the board.

1785
02:04:44,657 --> 02:04:46,439
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you going to put in the list tonight?

1786
02:04:49,061 --> 02:04:51,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Grand Theft Auto or Saints Row Online.

1787
02:04:53,484 --> 02:04:55,325
[SPEAKER_03]: An MMO for a sandbox game.

1788
02:04:55,745 --> 02:04:56,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know.

1789
02:04:56,306 --> 02:05:03,771
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we already have... They have a free-to-play MMO right now.

1790
02:05:03,871 --> 02:05:04,771
[SPEAKER_04]: ATB or whatever?

1791
02:05:04,791 --> 02:05:06,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, ATB.

1792
02:05:06,812 --> 02:05:07,693
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the same.

1793
02:05:08,774 --> 02:05:10,795
[SPEAKER_04]: A GTA or Saints Row MMO.

1794
02:05:11,115 --> 02:05:11,535
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is.

1795
02:05:11,956 --> 02:05:14,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's recap before we get to the very difficult part.

1796
02:05:15,698 --> 02:05:40,667
[SPEAKER_04]: A new F-Zero Sega is back in the console business Microsoft server crashes for 24 hours Microsoft and Sony go back on their DRM plans E3 announces the return of Kensha Hall Final Fantasy VII PlayStation 4 tech demo that it never is a real game Porn to Miiverse Super Mario RPG 2 Half-Life 3 released followed by a mic drop New Mass Effect announced but with good writing The Guardian Legend 2 on Wii U

1797
02:05:41,347 --> 02:05:44,550
[SPEAKER_04]: and Grand Theft Auto or Saints Row MMO.

1798
02:05:45,031 --> 02:05:46,852
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a lot of answers tonight.

1799
02:05:47,773 --> 02:05:53,499
[SPEAKER_04]: It's getting crowded up here, so unfortunately it's time to ask which of these is not worthy of the list.

1800
02:05:53,999 --> 02:05:59,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby Blackwolf, I know you don't want to do it, but you're going to have to make one of us mad by eliminating something off the list.

1801
02:05:59,304 --> 02:05:59,824
[SPEAKER_04]: What's it going to be?

1802
02:06:00,525 --> 02:06:01,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Porn to me-verse.

1803
02:06:03,288 --> 02:06:05,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Bobby, you're killing me.

1804
02:06:05,169 --> 02:06:06,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you getting rid of porn, though?

1805
02:06:11,043 --> 02:06:13,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Because... Because the Wii U is a wholesome system?

1806
02:06:13,784 --> 02:06:14,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Think of the children.

1807
02:06:14,345 --> 02:06:14,645
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

1808
02:06:14,845 --> 02:06:15,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Think of the children.

1809
02:06:15,866 --> 02:06:16,426
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1810
02:06:16,907 --> 02:06:18,428
[SPEAKER_04]: It has been stricken from the list.

1811
02:06:18,628 --> 02:06:20,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Porn to Me-verse is gone.

1812
02:06:21,129 --> 02:06:21,870
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1813
02:06:22,450 --> 02:06:22,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's next?

1814
02:06:22,971 --> 02:06:23,771
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

1815
02:06:24,852 --> 02:06:26,013
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the various answers.

1816
02:06:26,173 --> 02:06:28,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Which one of these is not worthy of the list?

1817
02:06:28,915 --> 02:06:32,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Tough one.

1818
02:06:32,637 --> 02:06:33,718
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of good answers up here.

1819
02:06:34,409 --> 02:06:37,310
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, there are.

1820
02:06:38,090 --> 02:06:47,932
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm probably going to have to axe the Microsoft and Sony going back because I don't think Microsoft is going to.

1821
02:06:48,052 --> 02:06:50,393
[SPEAKER_04]: You're eliminating it because you're just like, it's not happening.

1822
02:06:51,473 --> 02:06:53,293
[SPEAKER_10]: And we still don't know what Sony's going to say.

1823
02:06:53,593 --> 02:06:54,574
[SPEAKER_04]: You might want it to happen.

1824
02:06:54,634 --> 02:06:55,754
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all speculation.

1825
02:06:55,834 --> 02:06:56,114
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1826
02:06:56,194 --> 02:06:57,654
[SPEAKER_04]: It has been stricken from the list.

1827
02:06:58,274 --> 02:06:59,835
[SPEAKER_04]: As sad as that is going to make some of you.

1828
02:06:59,875 --> 02:07:00,495
[SPEAKER_04]: But I understand.

1829
02:07:01,195 --> 02:07:03,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, my turn to strike something from the list.

1830
02:07:03,858 --> 02:07:05,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh gosh, these are all actually really good.

1831
02:07:09,383 --> 02:07:10,003
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1832
02:07:12,706 --> 02:07:16,669
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate to do this, Loki, but I'm removing Super Mario RPG 2.

1833
02:07:17,270 --> 02:07:22,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Before you get mad at me, people, it's the same reason DarkSakura got rid of hers.

1834
02:07:22,515 --> 02:07:23,696
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not fucking happening.

1835
02:07:24,116 --> 02:07:25,798
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's not even get our hopes up.

1836
02:07:27,389 --> 02:07:30,530
[SPEAKER_04]: So Super Mario RPG 2, I'm sorry, but it has been removed from the list.

1837
02:07:30,770 --> 02:07:36,651
[SPEAKER_04]: But the good news is GTA or Saints Row MMO gets immunity going into the final removal, which is yours, Loki.

1838
02:07:36,891 --> 02:07:38,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's fantastic news.

1839
02:07:38,591 --> 02:07:41,392
[SPEAKER_03]: And since it's not really going to happen either, new Mass Effect announcement.

1840
02:07:41,492 --> 02:07:41,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey!

1841
02:07:41,692 --> 02:07:44,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's just not good writing in that series.

1842
02:07:45,193 --> 02:07:48,013
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, if they got the first game writing team, it would be good.

1843
02:07:48,873 --> 02:07:52,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry to say that it has been stricken from the list.

1844
02:07:53,134 --> 02:07:54,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, Dark Sakura.

1845
02:07:54,694 --> 02:07:57,075
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess while we're talking about things that will never happen...

1846
02:07:59,833 --> 02:08:00,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, there it is.

1847
02:08:00,815 --> 02:08:05,445
[SPEAKER_04]: It is now your turn to vote for your number one and your number two answers.

1848
02:08:05,465 --> 02:08:06,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Did EA pay you off?

1849
02:08:08,680 --> 02:08:14,082
[SPEAKER_04]: But guys, no longer do you send your answers to me over private message.

1850
02:08:14,182 --> 02:08:16,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Now there's a little button on the site that says your turn.

1851
02:08:17,443 --> 02:08:19,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Select your first and second choices now.

1852
02:08:19,503 --> 02:08:20,683
[SPEAKER_04]: It just popped up there in the corner.

1853
02:08:20,964 --> 02:08:26,325
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you click answer, you will be able to answer right now and we will get the answers tabulated.

1854
02:08:26,365 --> 02:08:32,747
[SPEAKER_05]: What you do first, you click on the answers and your first answer and your second answer and then you click the answer button.

1855
02:08:32,947 --> 02:08:33,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1856
02:08:34,167 --> 02:08:36,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Run through that one more time, Bobby, because I'm a little slow.

1857
02:08:36,707 --> 02:08:40,229
[SPEAKER_05]: So you'll click on one of my answers and you'll see it say one.

1858
02:08:40,370 --> 02:08:42,731
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you'll click on one of my other answers and you'll see it say two.

1859
02:08:42,771 --> 02:08:43,652
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you click answer.

1860
02:08:43,672 --> 02:08:44,172
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1861
02:08:44,212 --> 02:08:48,335
[SPEAKER_04]: So click on answer one and then answer two and then click answer.

1862
02:08:48,895 --> 02:08:49,075
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1863
02:08:49,095 --> 02:08:49,936
[SPEAKER_04]: What if they screw up?

1864
02:08:49,996 --> 02:08:50,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't have five, right?

1865
02:08:51,852 --> 02:09:21,085
[SPEAKER_04]: if the if but well once you click answer it's done like it's in but if you decided oh I didn't want that to be my number one you can click on it again and it takes it away oh okay good good to know all right there it is so um Bobby amazing work on the site I loved watching that all pop up as we were going and I bet you're breathing a sigh of relief seeing it actually work right yes awesome well I'll let you know if the votes come in here I'm wait oh there they go they're coming in oh nice oh it's even tabulates it for me Bobby I love it

1866
02:09:21,530 --> 02:09:22,753
[SPEAKER_04]: You're welcome.

1867
02:09:22,813 --> 02:09:23,535
[SPEAKER_04]: You the man, Bobby.

1868
02:09:24,938 --> 02:09:25,700
[SPEAKER_04]: A coding god.

1869
02:09:25,961 --> 02:09:30,292
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, Bobby, any other plugs like maybe for your show or something you want to get out here before I let you go?

1870
02:09:32,030 --> 02:09:35,233
[SPEAKER_04]: No, E3.VOGnetwork.com Alright, sounds good.

1871
02:09:35,453 --> 02:09:37,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Now how do I end this poll when it's done?

1872
02:09:37,755 --> 02:09:39,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we just uncheck answerable?

1873
02:09:39,917 --> 02:09:40,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Uncheck live.

1874
02:09:40,818 --> 02:09:42,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Uncheck live and that gets rid of it.

1875
02:09:43,020 --> 02:09:44,681
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually see a bug on this too.

1876
02:09:45,201 --> 02:09:45,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh really?

1877
02:09:48,504 --> 02:09:49,045
[SPEAKER_04]: What's happening?

1878
02:09:49,265 --> 02:09:49,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the scoring wrong?

1879
02:09:50,966 --> 02:09:52,988
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you notice how it's

1880
02:09:54,349 --> 02:09:54,849
[SPEAKER_05]: That's weird.

1881
02:09:55,410 --> 02:09:56,991
[SPEAKER_05]: I know why it's doing it.

1882
02:09:57,611 --> 02:09:58,472
[SPEAKER_04]: What's wrong, Bob?

1883
02:09:58,572 --> 02:09:59,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's not sorting it.

1884
02:09:59,452 --> 02:10:00,093
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not a big deal.

1885
02:10:00,373 --> 02:10:05,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it is sorting it, but it's sorting it by the first number and not the entire number.

1886
02:10:06,417 --> 02:10:06,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

1887
02:10:07,197 --> 02:10:07,538
[SPEAKER_05]: I get it.

1888
02:10:07,818 --> 02:10:09,979
[SPEAKER_05]: It's sorting it as a string instead of an integer.

1889
02:10:10,059 --> 02:10:11,040
[SPEAKER_04]: That's coding terms.

1890
02:10:12,660 --> 02:10:13,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I see what it's doing.

1891
02:10:13,801 --> 02:10:14,841
[SPEAKER_09]: We can still count, though.

1892
02:10:14,981 --> 02:10:16,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I can count, Bobby, believe it or not.

1893
02:10:16,982 --> 02:10:18,063
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1894
02:10:18,083 --> 02:10:20,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Your last chance to vote, live.vognetwork.com.

1895
02:10:20,504 --> 02:10:22,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I uncheck answerable as well or leave that?

1896
02:10:22,765 --> 02:10:24,526
[SPEAKER_05]: No, because then you won't see the live answers.

1897
02:10:24,566 --> 02:10:25,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that would be bad.

1898
02:10:25,426 --> 02:10:25,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1899
02:10:26,146 --> 02:10:26,987
[SPEAKER_05]: You keep it answerable.

1900
02:10:27,027 --> 02:10:27,787
[SPEAKER_05]: We uncheck live.

1901
02:10:27,887 --> 02:10:28,107
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1902
02:10:28,147 --> 02:10:28,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds good.

1903
02:10:28,487 --> 02:10:28,668
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1904
02:10:28,688 --> 02:10:32,269
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll let you know the results shortly, but we want to give a few more moments for everybody to vote.

1905
02:10:32,609 --> 02:10:34,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Once again, e3.vognetwork.com.

1906
02:10:34,650 --> 02:10:37,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for playing listless with us tonight and kicking off the new generation of listless.

1907
02:10:38,192 --> 02:10:38,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate it.

1908
02:10:39,161 --> 02:10:40,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much guys

1909
02:11:02,848 --> 02:11:04,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we'll let you know the results here shortly.

1910
02:11:04,669 --> 02:11:10,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, you can vote for about five more minutes at live.vognetwork.com in tonight's list list.

1911
02:11:11,935 --> 02:11:12,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to the mailbag.

1912
02:11:13,016 --> 02:11:16,118
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess now's a good time for us to... Do we gotta... Of course!

1913
02:11:16,238 --> 02:11:16,578
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1914
02:11:16,739 --> 02:11:17,819
[SPEAKER_04]: What, you don't like to hear from listeners?

1915
02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:19,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1916
02:11:20,521 --> 02:11:24,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send us emails.

1917
02:11:24,044 --> 02:11:29,448
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura's gonna dive in head first and find some emails that she thinks are worthy of reading on the show tonight.

1918
02:11:30,809 --> 02:11:31,309
[SPEAKER_10]: First email.

1919
02:11:32,711 --> 02:11:35,173
[SPEAKER_10]: It's also subject line is, now they've done it.

1920
02:11:36,153 --> 02:11:39,496
[SPEAKER_10]: I looked up hubris the other day to make sure it meant what I thought it did.

1921
02:11:39,636 --> 02:11:41,937
[SPEAKER_10]: Microsoft definitely has an overabundance of hubris.

1922
02:11:42,778 --> 02:11:47,061
[SPEAKER_10]: They revealed Xbox One and the consumers on the internet made assumptions.

1923
02:11:47,281 --> 02:11:51,544
[SPEAKER_10]: Then Microsoft denied the rumors, but last Thursday confirmed all the rumors to be true.

1924
02:11:52,004 --> 02:11:53,305
[SPEAKER_10]: And the consumers are not happy.

1925
02:11:53,405 --> 02:11:55,887
[SPEAKER_10]: See Major Nelson's blog comments to see the shitstorm.

1926
02:11:56,647 --> 02:12:01,650
[SPEAKER_10]: The Xbox One seems to be defying the consumers who use the internet.

1927
02:12:02,311 --> 02:12:04,132
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh wait, those are the target demographic.

1928
02:12:04,692 --> 02:12:08,735
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really stupid business-wise to ignore your customer base and punish them in the process.

1929
02:12:08,855 --> 02:12:09,596
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope they change.

1930
02:12:09,956 --> 02:12:10,917
[SPEAKER_10]: And that comes from Robaba.

1931
02:12:12,017 --> 02:12:12,278
[SPEAKER_10]: Agreed.

1932
02:12:13,919 --> 02:12:14,599
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to apologize.

1933
02:12:14,619 --> 02:12:15,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you summarize that for me?

1934
02:12:15,440 --> 02:12:17,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Alan just got home and I was talking to him.

1935
02:12:17,953 --> 02:12:21,714
[SPEAKER_10]: and basically Microsoft denying the rumors, then confirming the rumors and a big shitstorm.

1936
02:12:21,954 --> 02:12:23,054
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, what's up with that?

1937
02:12:23,154 --> 02:12:25,055
[SPEAKER_04]: They totally did, like, say no.

1938
02:12:25,435 --> 02:12:30,896
[SPEAKER_04]: But then they were also saying, like, at one point, what, like, that it was going to be $60 for the license or something.

1939
02:12:31,017 --> 02:12:34,197
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't... Sometimes the left hand isn't talking to the right hand, is it?

1940
02:12:34,457 --> 02:12:36,178
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, and I'll repeat this line.

1941
02:12:36,258 --> 02:12:40,119
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really stupid business-wise to ignore your customer base and punish them in the process.

1942
02:12:40,922 --> 02:12:44,063
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why I don't sign up for porn No one signs up for porn, porn happens

1943
02:13:11,078 --> 02:13:12,999
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, this is another one from Rabababa.

1944
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:17,222
[SPEAKER_10]: You should probably avoid my other emails for reading out too late.

1945
02:13:17,763 --> 02:13:22,105
[SPEAKER_10]: This is about the Xbox How It Games letter I slash we got via email.

1946
02:13:22,566 --> 02:13:24,307
[SPEAKER_10]: Here is one quote feature.

1947
02:13:25,067 --> 02:13:27,109
[SPEAKER_10]: Your games keep playing even when you're not.

1948
02:13:27,509 --> 02:13:29,870
[SPEAKER_10]: Just because you're not playing doesn't mean your games have to stop.

1949
02:13:30,250 --> 02:13:34,252
[SPEAKER_10]: With living games technology and the power of the cloud, game worlds are persistent.

1950
02:13:34,733 --> 02:13:37,154
[SPEAKER_10]: So the things you do in a game will stay that way.

1951
02:13:37,574 --> 02:13:43,897
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait, the living games continue to play without you like an MMO, which is the opposite of things you do in the game will stay that way.

1952
02:13:44,297 --> 02:13:46,058
[SPEAKER_10]: We call that technology save files.

1953
02:13:48,279 --> 02:13:48,980
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Rababa.

1954
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:51,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Some good emails from Rababa tonight.

1955
02:13:51,741 --> 02:13:52,361
[SPEAKER_10]: I like Rababa.

1956
02:13:52,922 --> 02:13:53,462
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a good man.

1957
02:13:54,142 --> 02:13:55,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's it for emails tonight, huh?

1958
02:13:56,283 --> 02:14:01,826
[SPEAKER_10]: I just came back into the chat room to see German Dungeon Transmidget Porn.

1959
02:14:02,787 --> 02:14:04,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you guys know how to party or what?

1960
02:14:04,748 --> 02:14:05,608
[SPEAKER_10]: I love the chat room.

1961
02:14:06,589 --> 02:14:08,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, last call for votes, guys.

1962
02:14:08,770 --> 02:14:10,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, this is the last call for votes.

1963
02:14:10,251 --> 02:14:15,374
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're participating with us, live.vognetwork.com The listless answers will be read after this.

1964
02:14:16,475 --> 02:14:17,255
[SPEAKER_04]: The FUs of the week.

1965
02:14:17,435 --> 02:14:18,316
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time to get angsty.

1966
02:14:18,536 --> 02:14:18,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

1967
02:14:19,396 --> 02:14:21,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause E3's this week and none of us are going.

1968
02:14:22,158 --> 02:14:23,139
[SPEAKER_04]: I get to go to the OUYA booth.

1969
02:14:24,840 --> 02:14:28,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, lower your expectations, that's all I gotta say.

1970
02:14:40,217 --> 02:14:43,961
[SPEAKER_10]: F you to me forgetting that I brought chocolate that's in the fridge and I'm gonna go get it now.

1971
02:14:45,007 --> 02:14:48,888
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to just realizing that you're going to give me a bunch of chocolate.

1972
02:14:49,489 --> 02:14:51,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that, like, I'm sad to have chocolate.

1973
02:14:51,769 --> 02:14:52,650
[SPEAKER_09]: I waited for Alan.

1974
02:14:52,870 --> 02:14:53,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Alan, chocolate.

1975
02:14:53,910 --> 02:14:54,290
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1976
02:14:54,330 --> 02:14:54,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki.

1977
02:15:00,072 --> 02:15:08,534
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to do my laptop for the hard drive failing and then having, you know, these things that they put in place, like a recovery partition just not doing anything.

1978
02:15:08,554 --> 02:15:13,416
[SPEAKER_03]: It got so bad that, like, Windows could read the hard drive because I was able to boot in the Windows and stuff.

1979
02:15:13,836 --> 02:15:15,616
[SPEAKER_03]: But then it's like, oh, you want to fix that drive?

1980
02:15:15,656 --> 02:15:17,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I can't read that drive to fix it.

1981
02:15:18,897 --> 02:15:19,498
[SPEAKER_03]: So that kind of sucked.

1982
02:15:19,538 --> 02:15:21,398
[SPEAKER_03]: But at least I got a new hard drive in there.

1983
02:15:21,678 --> 02:15:23,939
[SPEAKER_03]: That had to take out all of my JTAG, which I'm not using.

1984
02:15:24,919 --> 02:15:26,620
[SPEAKER_03]: My Xbox of fame, unfortunately.

1985
02:15:26,640 --> 02:15:26,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1986
02:15:28,440 --> 02:15:45,542
[SPEAKER_03]: and then also F you to Steam actually just for this weekend because I was trying to I installed Steam on my new installation of Windows and it asked me hey I haven't played on this PC before you need to authenticate with us and then they wouldn't send me the email.

1987
02:15:46,523 --> 02:15:48,064
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, what the hell?

1988
02:15:48,344 --> 02:15:56,767
[SPEAKER_03]: It ended up being that their server was all fucked up this weekend, and so it was sending the email like two hours after you sent them the confirmation.

1989
02:15:57,427 --> 02:16:00,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Normally it's like immediate, so whatever.

1990
02:16:01,809 --> 02:16:02,449
[SPEAKER_04]: So I feel that.

1991
02:16:03,409 --> 02:16:03,729
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1992
02:16:04,370 --> 02:16:07,691
[SPEAKER_04]: My IP of the week, it goes to The Heat in Phoenix, Arizona.

1993
02:16:08,431 --> 02:16:09,512
[SPEAKER_04]: I can only imagine.

1994
02:16:09,572 --> 02:16:10,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Except for Grand Avenue.

1995
02:16:10,293 --> 02:16:10,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1996
02:16:27,592 --> 02:16:51,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Alice Cooper owns a bar there and I totally went there and it was amazing and I got to see his big unit or whatever that that that 22 no seriously it's like a 22 inch hot dog it was on man versus food or whatever I got to see somebody order that that was cool um otherwise F you to the fact like I can deal with 110 degree heat like I had to deal with that yesterday but at nine o'clock at night it cools off here in Arizona nope

1997
02:16:54,969 --> 02:16:56,131
[SPEAKER_04]: So F you to the heat in Arizona.

1998
02:16:57,613 --> 02:17:01,478
[SPEAKER_04]: And F you to the fact that I'm not really going to E3, but... Phoenix, right?

1999
02:17:01,698 --> 02:17:03,461
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, what's up with that?

2000
02:17:04,102 --> 02:17:07,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I think it's time to read the results of this list.

2001
02:17:07,186 --> 02:17:07,807

[SPEAKER_04]: That's right, I think chocolate too.

2008
02:17:19,138 --> 02:17:19,799
[SPEAKER_04]: It is too late.

[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so let's... Oh, son of a bitch.

2010

02:17:25,425 --> 02:17:26,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there's the table.

2012
02:17:26,045 --> 02:17:26,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Phew.

[SPEAKER_04]: Phew.

2014
02:17:26,906 --> 02:17:28,307
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, Bobby, I found a bug.

2015
02:17:28,627 --> 02:17:29,747
[SPEAKER_04]: But it showed up again after a second.

2016
02:17:29,787 --> 02:17:30,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2017
02:17:30,728 --> 02:17:31,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is.

2018
02:17:31,128 --> 02:17:32,589
[SPEAKER_04]: The answers for tonight's list list.

2019
02:17:33,309 --> 02:17:34,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Number three.

2020
02:17:34,510 --> 02:17:35,050
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is it.

2021
02:17:35,510 --> 02:17:36,351
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what you want.

2022
02:17:36,391 --> 02:17:37,491
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what will happen.

2023
02:17:38,192 --> 02:17:39,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what you really want to will happen.

2024
02:17:41,730 --> 02:17:43,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Scientific Process, The End.

2025
02:17:43,191 --> 02:17:44,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Number three answer.

2026
02:17:45,352 --> 02:17:50,394
[SPEAKER_04]: The Microsoft server crashes for 24 hours and none of the games are playable after Wednesday.

2027
02:17:50,595 --> 02:17:53,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, that's not possible because they're running off PCs anyway.

2028
02:17:54,977 --> 02:17:55,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop being a realist.

2029
02:17:55,857 --> 02:17:56,137
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2030
02:17:56,558 --> 02:17:58,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Number two answer, Loki.

2031
02:17:59,039 --> 02:17:59,999
[SPEAKER_04]: It should make you happy.

2032
02:18:00,139 --> 02:18:02,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Grand Theft Auto or Saints Row MMO?

2033
02:18:02,781 --> 02:18:03,221
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish.

2034
02:18:03,441 --> 02:18:04,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Number two answer.

2035
02:18:05,382 --> 02:18:12,046
[SPEAKER_04]: and the number one answer with over the number of points of number three and two combined.

2036
02:18:12,106 --> 02:18:13,967
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that's ever happened in Listless history.

2037
02:18:14,467 --> 02:18:19,970
[SPEAKER_04]: The number one answer, Half-Life 3 released followed by a mic drop.

2038
02:18:20,290 --> 02:18:21,390
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be fantastic.

2039
02:18:21,670 --> 02:18:22,831
[SPEAKER_10]: You know everyone wants it.

2040
02:18:22,871 --> 02:18:27,712
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to see that in just like a really crappy just like stage that he has in like he built in his house.

2041
02:18:28,012 --> 02:18:29,412
[SPEAKER_03]: He's just like not even a stage.

2042
02:18:29,452 --> 02:18:31,392
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like half.

2043
02:18:31,592 --> 02:18:33,093
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pushing a giant button.

2044
02:18:33,293 --> 02:18:34,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Just have the button.

2045
02:18:34,093 --> 02:18:37,254
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, he can lift up the button and the little case covering the button.

2046
02:18:37,534 --> 02:18:40,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Hit the button and the little thing in the back says Half-Life 3 release.

2047
02:18:40,814 --> 02:18:41,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Drops mic, leaves.

2048
02:18:42,075 --> 02:18:42,895
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

2049
02:18:43,055 --> 02:18:43,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Video done.

2050
02:18:44,275 --> 02:18:44,535
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2051
02:18:44,575 --> 02:18:45,055
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.

2052
02:18:45,536 --> 02:18:46,196
[SPEAKER_04]: It worked very well.

2053
02:18:46,356 --> 02:18:48,537
[SPEAKER_04]: And, ooh, it even shows me how everybody voted.

2054
02:18:48,877 --> 02:18:49,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I know.

2055
02:18:50,238 --> 02:18:51,159
[SPEAKER_10]: Now we know who the traitors are.

2056
02:18:51,179 --> 02:18:52,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I know who to judge.

2057
02:18:52,179 --> 02:18:52,399
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2058
02:18:52,419 --> 02:18:52,879
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding.

2059
02:18:53,960 --> 02:18:55,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Did Loki vote for his own answer?

2060
02:18:55,221 --> 02:18:55,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see.

2061
02:18:55,701 --> 02:18:56,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I did.

2062
02:18:56,301 --> 02:18:58,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.

2063
02:18:58,742 --> 02:18:59,903
[SPEAKER_03]: You always vote for yourself.

2064
02:19:00,723 --> 02:19:01,003
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2065
02:19:01,644 --> 02:19:01,984
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is.

2066
02:19:02,064 --> 02:19:03,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, just to recap.

2067
02:19:03,585 --> 02:19:05,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Number three, the Microsoft server crashes for 24 hours.

2068
02:19:05,966 --> 02:19:07,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Number two, Grand Theft Auto or Saints Row MMO.

2069
02:19:07,907 --> 02:19:10,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Number one, Half-Life 3 released, followed by a mic drop.

2070
02:19:11,509 --> 02:19:13,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you and good night.

2071
02:19:14,150 --> 02:19:16,232
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, and BlackWolf is celebrating in chat.

2072
02:19:16,312 --> 02:19:17,192
[SPEAKER_04]: A winner is me.

2073
02:19:17,773 --> 02:19:18,834
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he hacked the system.

2074
02:19:18,874 --> 02:19:19,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Couldn't he have done that?

2075
02:19:19,534 --> 02:19:21,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Couldn't he have hacked the system to give himself more points?

2076
02:19:21,816 --> 02:19:22,256
[SPEAKER_04]: He may have.

2077
02:19:22,757 --> 02:19:23,077
[SPEAKER_04]: He may have.

2078
02:19:23,097 --> 02:19:23,918
[SPEAKER_04]: The game has been hacked.

2079
02:19:25,178 --> 02:19:33,745
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, just a couple more news stories for you guys, and then we're going to get to the Twitter topics and our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2080
02:19:33,785 --> 02:19:34,606
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, Loki.

2081
02:19:35,186 --> 02:19:43,631
[SPEAKER_03]: So Minecraft is getting some updates on the portable version, or the pocket edition, including Alpha Realms support.

2082
02:19:43,812 --> 02:19:50,576
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you remember correctly, Minecraft Realms is that new Mojang-run private servers, basically.

2083
02:19:51,056 --> 02:19:51,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Cake?

2084
02:19:51,697 --> 02:19:51,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Cake.

2085
02:19:51,877 --> 02:19:51,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Cake.

2086
02:20:15,572 --> 02:20:19,714
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'm glad to see that the Android version is getting some updates.

2087
02:20:20,015 --> 02:20:24,817
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish that, I know one of the things that they're working on, and I don't think it's happened yet, is controller support for that.

2088
02:20:25,158 --> 02:20:29,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if that's the case, then I can sideload that onto my Ouya and play with the controller, and it'd be fantastic.

2089
02:20:30,778 --> 02:20:32,520
[SPEAKER_03]: and oh, god damn it.

2090
02:20:32,600 --> 02:20:33,300
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew there was something.

2091
02:20:33,320 --> 02:20:36,183
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot nephews of the week, but I'll mention it real quickly since we're talking about Minecraft.

2092
02:20:36,423 --> 02:20:36,843
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell?

2093
02:20:36,883 --> 02:20:41,828
[SPEAKER_03]: The fucking VOG Network Minecraft server host is absolute shit.

2094
02:20:42,268 --> 02:20:44,270
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been down for five days now.

2095
02:20:44,410 --> 02:20:47,692
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've sent a bunch of support tickets to them.

2096
02:20:48,313 --> 02:20:49,594
[SPEAKER_03]: No fucking response back.

2097
02:20:49,774 --> 02:20:50,355
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not cool.

2098
02:20:50,435 --> 02:20:54,959
[SPEAKER_03]: But they sure as hell took out the money out of my account this weekend to pay for it.

2099
02:20:55,399 --> 02:20:58,862
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm looking... There's three magic words that will get...

2100
02:20:59,202 --> 02:20:59,442
[SPEAKER_10]: Action.

2101
02:20:59,482 --> 02:21:00,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Better Business Bureau.

2102
02:21:00,103 --> 02:21:01,044
[SPEAKER_10]: Better Business Bureau.

2103
02:21:01,584 --> 02:21:09,110
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to be probably, I'm going to either switch the server to a new host or I'm just going to shut it down because no one's really playing on it.

2104
02:21:09,130 --> 02:21:11,152
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I tried to log into it this week.

2105
02:21:11,792 --> 02:21:12,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's just.

2106
02:21:13,013 --> 02:21:13,674
[SPEAKER_10]: I played last week.

2107
02:21:14,714 --> 02:21:16,076
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's just not a lot of people on there.

2108
02:21:16,196 --> 02:21:18,938
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's, you know, even though it's $10 a month, it's just, you know.

2109
02:21:19,839 --> 02:21:20,179
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll give you $5.

2110
02:21:20,959 --> 02:21:21,440
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all right.

2111
02:21:22,160 --> 02:21:22,601
[SPEAKER_03]: No one plays.

2112
02:21:22,621 --> 02:21:23,722
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes down.

2113
02:21:25,203 --> 02:21:25,443
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2114
02:21:27,088 --> 02:21:28,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that doesn't mean no good.

2115
02:21:28,069 --> 02:21:29,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and they have announced...

2116
02:21:54,076 --> 02:22:01,417
[SPEAKER_04]: They have announced that this game is inspired by, and this is why DarkSakura is excited, it's inspired by Konami's Parodius series.

2117
02:22:02,478 --> 02:22:04,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's some gameplay, a little flying hamster.

2118
02:22:05,398 --> 02:22:06,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's awesome.

2119
02:22:06,478 --> 02:22:09,059
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want to play it, though, they do have flying hamsters.

2120
02:22:09,079 --> 02:22:10,599
[SPEAKER_03]: The original game is on iOS.

2121
02:22:10,999 --> 02:22:11,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, nice.

2122
02:22:11,379 --> 02:22:13,139
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can play that.

2123
02:22:14,800 --> 02:22:16,120
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the little Egyptian penguin.

2124
02:22:16,160 --> 02:22:16,840
[SPEAKER_04]: It's super cute.

2125
02:22:16,880 --> 02:22:18,740
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to fight the owl.

2126
02:22:20,301 --> 02:22:21,261
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is super cute.

2127
02:22:22,262 --> 02:22:23,023
[SPEAKER_10]: It is cute.

2128
02:22:24,404 --> 02:22:27,165
[SPEAKER_04]: And you gotta love somebody who says they're inspired by Parodius, right?

2129
02:22:27,546 --> 02:22:29,247
[SPEAKER_10]: Parodius is like one of the best games ever.

2130
02:22:30,327 --> 02:22:35,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Online leaderboards, unlockable trophies, and all that fun stuff on the PlayStation Network.

2131
02:22:35,731 --> 02:22:38,373
[SPEAKER_04]: The game is also on the PlayStation Minis service.

2132
02:22:38,393 --> 02:22:39,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, Fat Mermaids.

2133
02:22:39,674 --> 02:22:42,856
[SPEAKER_04]: The original Flying Hamster is on the Minis.

2134
02:22:42,876 --> 02:22:43,796
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty cool.

2135
02:22:43,896 --> 02:22:44,677
[SPEAKER_10]: It has Fat Mermaids.

2136
02:22:45,407 --> 02:22:53,231
[SPEAKER_04]: That's also a great little indie... You might not have noticed that otherwise title, so I'm really glad we're getting a little bit of a spotlight on that.

2137
02:22:53,271 --> 02:22:53,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

2138
02:22:54,791 --> 02:22:56,492
[SPEAKER_04]: So DarkSakura's thinking about getting a Vita for that.

2139
02:22:56,852 --> 02:22:57,433
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm not.

2140
02:22:58,093 --> 02:22:59,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Just download it on your iPad.

2141
02:23:00,174 --> 02:23:00,454
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2142
02:23:01,415 --> 02:23:02,695
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's about time to open up the Skype line.

2143
02:23:02,715 --> 02:23:04,136
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, I'm sorry, nothing is Pentaro.

2144
02:23:05,317 --> 02:23:06,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's open up the Skype line.

2145
02:23:06,617 --> 02:23:10,379
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2146
02:23:10,439 --> 02:23:14,061
[SPEAKER_04]: It is time to get some calls here on this Sunday night.

2147
02:23:15,322 --> 02:23:16,943
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to know, what are your E3 thoughts?

2148
02:23:17,143 --> 02:23:19,944
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to give them in a haiku form, but bonus points if you do.

2149
02:23:21,624 --> 02:23:23,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you have something to say about all this Xbox One business.

2150
02:23:24,005 --> 02:23:30,207
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure some of our regular callers have an opinion or three or five or ten on what we talked about at the very beginning of the show.

2151
02:23:30,307 --> 02:23:32,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe there's something else completely different we've missed.

2152
02:23:32,668 --> 02:23:33,508
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to hear from you guys.

2153
02:23:33,528 --> 02:23:37,070
[SPEAKER_04]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2154
02:23:37,630 --> 02:23:38,050
[SPEAKER_04]: And look at that.

2155
02:23:38,570 --> 02:23:39,390
[SPEAKER_04]: It's already ringing.

2156
02:23:40,411 --> 02:23:41,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Already got calls coming in tonight.

2157
02:23:41,751 --> 02:23:42,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to it.

2158
02:23:42,351 --> 02:23:43,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2159
02:23:43,312 --> 02:23:43,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2160
02:23:44,508 --> 02:23:45,768
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say sobered up Ranma.

2161
02:23:46,389 --> 02:23:47,469
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry to hear that.

2162
02:23:48,489 --> 02:23:49,629
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you otherwise, Ranma?

2163
02:23:50,470 --> 02:23:51,390
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing pretty good.

2164
02:23:51,430 --> 02:23:53,050
[SPEAKER_04]: How about y'all out there in California?

2165
02:23:53,170 --> 02:23:53,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Hot.

2166
02:23:54,051 --> 02:23:56,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, today was better.

2167
02:23:56,151 --> 02:23:57,352
[SPEAKER_10]: I had chocolate, and I'm happy.

2168
02:23:57,512 --> 02:23:58,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've calmed down a little bit.

2169
02:23:58,812 --> 02:23:59,312
[SPEAKER_10]: Yesterday was 110.

2170
02:23:59,832 --> 02:24:01,313
[SPEAKER_10]: Tomorrow's going to be 80.

2171
02:24:03,433 --> 02:24:03,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

2172
02:24:03,853 --> 02:24:04,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Go fig.

2173
02:24:04,794 --> 02:24:05,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

2174
02:24:06,234 --> 02:24:07,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what's new with you, Ranma?

2175
02:24:07,254 --> 02:24:08,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Why'd you call in tonight?

2176
02:24:08,795 --> 02:24:12,576
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple of things, but before I get into it, hey, Ukchan.

2177
02:24:13,356 --> 02:24:13,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?

2178
02:24:14,881 --> 02:24:17,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like at Otakon this year we may be bringing Ranma 1.5 back.

2179
02:24:18,502 --> 02:24:19,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

2180
02:24:19,942 --> 02:24:23,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, a few of us are doing like a quick impromptu group photo.

2181
02:24:23,923 --> 02:24:24,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

2182
02:24:24,643 --> 02:24:26,884
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, send me a copy of it, definitely.

2183
02:24:26,964 --> 02:24:28,704
[SPEAKER_10]: Too bad I can't come with my spatula.

2184
02:24:29,784 --> 02:24:31,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and if we have to, we'll pack you in a box.

2185
02:24:33,045 --> 02:24:36,646
[SPEAKER_10]: I wish I could go, I really do, but unfortunately money, blah blah.

2186
02:24:38,317 --> 02:24:39,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, okay, okay.

2187
02:24:39,838 --> 02:24:41,299
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a real reason why I called.

2188
02:24:42,479 --> 02:24:52,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one, I understand what everyone says about the Xbox One, but truth be told, it's still going to sell because they're going to have these top-tier titles.

2189
02:24:52,845 --> 02:24:58,648
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to forget, half the gamers in the video gaming fandom are lemmings.

2190
02:24:58,888 --> 02:25:04,931
[SPEAKER_02]: They will say one thing, and then after the presentation, you see all these games, it'll be like, shut up and take my money.

2191
02:25:06,445 --> 02:25:09,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Couldn't you say the same thing about Nintendo's Wii U, though?

2192
02:25:09,706 --> 02:25:12,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I could say that about every single gaming console.

2193
02:25:13,327 --> 02:25:14,627
[SPEAKER_04]: But then what happens after that?

2194
02:25:15,147 --> 02:25:18,808
[SPEAKER_04]: The Nintendo fanboys have bought the Wii U and they're still calling it a failure.

2195
02:25:19,088 --> 02:25:25,430
[SPEAKER_04]: I still think the jury's out on that, given another holiday season before we build its coffin.

2196
02:25:25,870 --> 02:25:29,911
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know.

2197
02:25:29,951 --> 02:25:30,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do you think that is?

2198
02:25:35,006 --> 02:25:37,007
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the way people think.

2199
02:25:37,588 --> 02:25:42,833
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm kind of reminded from back in the days of everybody was importing the DDR into Beatmania games.

2200
02:25:42,853 --> 02:25:50,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Then when Konami started bringing over DDR and people got pissed that certain titles were not in the US releases, they were like, I'm not going to buy it.

2201
02:25:51,200 --> 02:25:55,324
[SPEAKER_02]: The game comes out, they buy it anyway to support their fandom.

2202
02:25:55,764 --> 02:26:00,829
[SPEAKER_02]: As for these next-gen consoles, one of the reasons why people are going to buy them is to support the console they think it's going to work.

2203
02:26:01,670 --> 02:26:02,511
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2204
02:26:20,171 --> 02:26:20,591
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't?

2205
02:26:21,451 --> 02:26:22,151
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.

2206
02:26:22,311 --> 02:26:24,472
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think Blizzard or EA thought so either.

2207
02:26:24,752 --> 02:26:25,552
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my worry.

2208
02:26:26,172 --> 02:26:33,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know how many servers other manufacturers have, but I have this feeling Microsoft's going to have the most.

2209
02:26:33,674 --> 02:26:37,715
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said straight up they're going to bring up all these servers ahead of time.

2210
02:26:37,955 --> 02:26:41,376
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm guessing some of the mistakes with EA and Blizzard we're doing with servers.

2211
02:26:41,436 --> 02:26:42,616
[SPEAKER_02]: So who knows?

2212
02:26:43,276 --> 02:26:46,497
[SPEAKER_04]: So where's your head at with Xbox One after all of this?

2213
02:26:48,389 --> 02:26:52,033
[SPEAKER_02]: I said before, shut up and take my money for a PS4, but you know what?

2214
02:26:52,113 --> 02:26:56,458
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to wait until after the presentations and see what everybody has to say and then make my decision.

2215
02:26:56,758 --> 02:26:58,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Based off games are most important?

2216
02:27:00,462 --> 02:27:00,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.

2217
02:27:00,943 --> 02:27:04,627
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like games, technology, functionality, a little bit of everything.

2218
02:27:05,458 --> 02:27:08,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me ask you one more question, because I know you're a long-time listener of the show.

2219
02:27:08,519 --> 02:27:10,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Were you here at the very beginning of the show, or did you come in late tonight?

2220
02:27:11,361 --> 02:27:12,581
[SPEAKER_02]: I was here at the very beginning of the show.

2221
02:27:12,661 --> 02:27:12,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

2222
02:27:13,322 --> 02:27:25,107
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't judge you if you were late, but I just want to know, earlier in the show I asked DarkSakura about the golden rule of gaming, and we kind of came to a consensus that perhaps the golden rule of gaming, a system that's only as good as the games that are on it, could be evolving.

2223
02:27:25,847 --> 02:27:26,368
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think?

2224
02:27:27,348 --> 02:27:33,814
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so, too, because that golden rule is the reason why I got a 360 before the PS3.

2225
02:27:33,834 --> 02:27:38,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Because people are going to argue, why did you get that next-gen console?

2226
02:27:39,479 --> 02:27:41,020
[SPEAKER_02]: All these cool games are on that one.

2227
02:27:41,300 --> 02:27:46,364
[SPEAKER_02]: And the answer is, well, those games are not games I would particularly like to play.

2228
02:27:46,665 --> 02:27:49,787
[SPEAKER_02]: The games that I've played and I've enjoyed are on this console.

2229
02:27:49,807 --> 02:27:53,451
[SPEAKER_02]: This console is going to offer these games I am interested in, which is why I'm going to buy it.

2230
02:27:55,996 --> 02:27:56,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

2231
02:27:56,096 --> 02:27:56,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

2232
02:28:12,236 --> 02:28:22,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I still remember when I was working at Staples, I looked outside the long line of people across the street at Circuit City for the $500 and $600 PlayStation 3.

2233
02:28:22,058 --> 02:28:23,458
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

2234
02:28:23,498 --> 02:28:26,079
[SPEAKER_04]: There'll be an audience somewhere, but will it be big enough?

2235
02:28:26,159 --> 02:28:26,839
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the question.

2236
02:28:27,499 --> 02:28:30,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Ranma, I gotta let you go to get more calls, but any other thoughts before I let you go?

2237
02:28:31,840 --> 02:28:33,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm sorry, but this is the thing.

2238
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:39,121
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you heard, but GameStop had a special this week on Injustice Gods Among Men.

2239
02:28:40,387 --> 02:28:41,728
[SPEAKER_02]: You mean Gods Among Us, but yes.

2240
02:28:42,369 --> 02:28:42,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2241
02:28:43,069 --> 02:28:45,431
[SPEAKER_02]: $10, one hour sale only.

2242
02:28:45,951 --> 02:28:49,014
[SPEAKER_02]: So many people flooded the site to try to buy it online.

2243
02:28:49,194 --> 02:28:52,776
[SPEAKER_02]: What I found out about this, I went and I printed out the paper.

2244
02:28:53,257 --> 02:29:03,705
[SPEAKER_02]: When I got out of class, I went down to Best Buy and I got them to price match a $60 game for $10 that happened about two and a half hours after the sale ended.

2245
02:29:03,965 --> 02:29:04,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice work.

2246
02:29:07,207 --> 02:29:08,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you enjoy the game?

2247
02:29:08,601 --> 02:29:14,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's one of the few games where I actually enjoyed it because I was playing it more for the story than anything else.

2248
02:29:15,646 --> 02:29:22,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Asking for someone who does not believe in paying retail price for a game unless you can get it to knock down, I honestly say...

2249
02:29:23,783 --> 02:29:27,225
[SPEAKER_02]: The game is worth $50 at least.

2250
02:29:27,465 --> 02:29:28,605
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't see myself paying $59.

2251
02:29:29,186 --> 02:29:31,206
[SPEAKER_02]: I see myself paying $49 or maybe $54.

2252
02:29:32,127 --> 02:29:33,668
[SPEAKER_02]: But full retail, no.

2253
02:29:34,008 --> 02:29:36,489
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a tricky line once you break that $50 barrier.

2254
02:29:36,549 --> 02:29:37,910
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something psychological about it.

2255
02:29:38,290 --> 02:29:40,331
[SPEAKER_04]: But we could do a whole other episode on that.

2256
02:29:40,611 --> 02:29:42,212
[SPEAKER_04]: But I should let you go for now, Ranma.

2257
02:29:43,112 --> 02:29:44,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody listen to Anime Jam Session.

2258
02:29:45,373 --> 02:29:45,813
[SPEAKER_02]: You got it.

2259
02:29:45,933 --> 02:29:48,594
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be talking about Denver Comic Con and Anime Next on Tuesday.

2260
02:29:48,794 --> 02:29:49,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, you guys got a busy show.

2261
02:29:49,914 --> 02:29:50,674
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, have a good one, buddy.

2262
02:29:51,134 --> 02:29:51,374
[SPEAKER_04]: You too.

2263
02:29:51,754 --> 02:29:51,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

2264
02:29:52,894 --> 02:29:53,255
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2265
02:29:54,215 --> 02:29:54,515
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

2266
02:29:54,775 --> 02:30:01,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though we've been talking a lot on this show about E3, there's lots of other nerd shows at the Voice of Geeks Network talking about other stuff.

2267
02:30:01,156 --> 02:30:02,196
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's anime conventions going on.

2268
02:30:02,216 --> 02:30:06,097
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure somebody's going to be talking about Apple stuff on Monday.

2269
02:30:06,197 --> 02:30:10,678
[SPEAKER_04]: So stay tuned for that and all the great shows at the Voice of Geeks Network at vognetwork.com.

2270
02:30:12,338 --> 02:30:14,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to the phones which are lighting up and take another call.

2271
02:30:14,499 --> 02:30:15,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2272
02:30:15,440 --> 02:30:15,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2273
02:30:18,241 --> 02:30:19,621
[SPEAKER_07]: This is YYR.

2274
02:30:20,041 --> 02:30:21,982
[SPEAKER_07]: I just called to drop this rhyme.

2275
02:30:22,202 --> 02:30:23,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Ha ha, I'm a troll.

2276
02:30:29,645 --> 02:30:33,846
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have to have haiku call night at some point and everybody will have to do that.

2277
02:30:34,346 --> 02:30:35,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Well played, my friend.

2278
02:30:35,947 --> 02:30:36,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Well played.

2279
02:30:36,547 --> 02:30:37,808
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm tipping my hat to you.

2280
02:30:37,868 --> 02:30:38,768
[SPEAKER_04]: You just can't see it.

2281
02:30:40,593 --> 02:30:42,333
[SPEAKER_12]: Because Rob's head is invisible and intangible.

2282
02:30:42,353 --> 02:30:45,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, that's really the only reason I called in.

2283
02:30:45,714 --> 02:30:51,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, since I have a captive audience, how is Bungie Ferret Tossing going?

2284
02:30:52,215 --> 02:30:52,935
[SPEAKER_07]: It's beer money.

2285
02:30:53,456 --> 02:30:55,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Beer money is great because it buys beer.

2286
02:30:55,776 --> 02:30:56,496
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

2287
02:30:57,696 --> 02:31:00,597
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't think you've seen the last of Bungie Ferret Tossing.

2288
02:31:02,537 --> 02:31:05,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Deep in other projects right now, such as Ports 2,

2289
02:31:06,795 --> 02:31:14,038
[SPEAKER_07]: The smartphones and tablets I like to complain about, but I think at some point I would love to revisit that universe, yes.

2290
02:31:14,378 --> 02:31:16,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, okay, very cool.

2291
02:31:17,300 --> 02:31:22,502
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think about the way, you know, there's been a lot of news about like Xbox One is kind of shafting indies or whatever.

2292
02:31:22,622 --> 02:31:28,925
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, as somebody who developed, you know, quite a bit, you did several games, not just Bungie Fair Tossing, but I know you had Snake 360 and Falling.

2293
02:31:29,265 --> 02:31:30,486
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you did a few games for the...

2294
02:31:32,006 --> 02:31:34,948
[SPEAKER_04]: XNA, or Xbox Live Indie Games.

2295
02:31:35,188 --> 02:31:36,889
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think about all this news about Xbox One?

2296
02:31:38,530 --> 02:31:48,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, as far as indie games in general, specifically, Microsoft already said they're not going to allow anyone to self-publish on one at first.

2297
02:31:50,176 --> 02:31:57,239
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's a game changer, especially when Sony has come out and said, yes, if you want to self-publish, come to us.

2298
02:31:57,800 --> 02:31:58,300
[SPEAKER_07]: PS4 will

2299
02:31:59,182 --> 02:32:01,925
[SPEAKER_07]: will be happy to host your self-published game.

2300
02:32:02,425 --> 02:32:10,412
[SPEAKER_07]: And, of course, Nintendo is welcoming self-publishing on Wii U as well to some degree.

2301
02:32:10,452 --> 02:32:14,535
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you still need a business address to be a developer for a Nintendo platform.

2302
02:32:14,636 --> 02:32:26,666
[SPEAKER_07]: But besides that, yeah, it seems that Microsoft is going to be the least indie-friendly next-gen console out of the gate.

2303
02:32:27,583 --> 02:32:38,927
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that in mind, I think that, you know, depending on how much indie games influence the next console generation, that may not matter at all or it may matter a lot.

2304
02:32:39,247 --> 02:32:45,849
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's all going to depend on how big of a blip on the radar indie games are over the next console gen.

2305
02:32:47,590 --> 02:32:50,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Before I let you go... The rest of it, it's crazy.

2306
02:32:50,511 --> 02:32:51,571
[SPEAKER_07]: It's absolutely crazy.

2307
02:32:53,072 --> 02:32:53,512
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think...

2308
02:32:54,469 --> 02:32:59,210
[SPEAKER_07]: All eyes are going to be on Sony at that after-conference presser.

2309
02:32:59,710 --> 02:33:02,711
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, is PS4 going to be like this?

2310
02:33:02,871 --> 02:33:03,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it going to be like that?

2311
02:33:03,971 --> 02:33:05,311
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it going to allow us to do this?

2312
02:33:05,451 --> 02:33:14,873
[SPEAKER_07]: And the answers given there are really going to make a big difference as far as how people perceive not just the Xbox One, but all of the new consoles, really.

2313
02:33:15,133 --> 02:33:21,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Tomorrow, I mean literally tomorrow, what, 12 hours away is a huge day in gaming.

2314
02:33:22,175 --> 02:33:22,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Huge.

2315
02:33:23,175 --> 02:33:23,935
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the biggest ever.

2316
02:33:25,815 --> 02:33:31,037
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be on the edge of my seat, and I know probably all of us will be to some extent.

2317
02:33:32,617 --> 02:33:32,938
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

2318
02:33:32,958 --> 02:33:34,858
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to take a nap.

2319
02:33:34,898 --> 02:33:37,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Before I let you go, buddy, I always kind of like to ask this.

2320
02:33:37,919 --> 02:33:40,400
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you just called in to give a haiku, and here we are with an interview.

2321
02:33:40,440 --> 02:33:44,261
[SPEAKER_04]: But just outside of developing your own stuff, what games are you playing?

2322
02:33:44,281 --> 02:33:45,622
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you enjoying playing lately?

2323
02:33:47,217 --> 02:33:48,898
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been playing a lot of Tekken lately.

2324
02:33:49,759 --> 02:33:53,521
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually bought the Wii U version just out of curiosity.

2325
02:33:54,282 --> 02:34:01,286
[SPEAKER_07]: And I can say Tekken Ball, I don't know who remembers the Tekken Ball minigame in Tekken 3.

2326
02:34:01,747 --> 02:34:02,467
[SPEAKER_11]: I love that game.

2327
02:34:02,527 --> 02:34:03,168
[SPEAKER_07]: Totally do.

2328
02:34:04,408 --> 02:34:11,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they basically, you know, they updated it graphically and now you can actually select different balls to use.

2329
02:34:12,194 --> 02:34:41,326
[SPEAKER_07]: and the difference is basically in how fast they move how quickly they charge up damage so it's a little bit more customizable than it was before and of course you can use tag teams which is for Tekken ball mostly useless but it's fun anyway so that is pretty much the major addition to the Tekken on Wii U the mushroom battle that everyone made such a big deal about and looks like so much fun in videos it's really not all it's cracked up to be

2330
02:34:42,176 --> 02:35:00,724
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fun for like five minutes, but after the novelty wears off, because basically it's like the poison mushrooms that shrink you and the super mushrooms that grow you, the poison mushrooms also hurt you, and the damage is really high to begin with.

2331
02:35:01,044 --> 02:35:05,466
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like you get a couple mushrooms and already one more hit and you're dead.

2332
02:35:06,167 --> 02:35:13,758
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's over way too quickly, and you can't play it online, and you can't use tag teams, and it's just, it's not that great.

2333
02:35:14,619 --> 02:35:18,845
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, online, not too many people playing, for reasons that you could probably guess.

2334
02:35:19,847 --> 02:35:21,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Other than that, it's the same game.

2335
02:35:23,257 --> 02:35:31,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I haven't played a lot of Tekken in a while, so maybe I should rent Tekken on Nintendo Wii U, since my Wii U will allow me to do that.

2336
02:35:32,800 --> 02:35:35,420
[SPEAKER_08]: The actual last one that I bought was Tekken 4.

2337
02:35:35,460 --> 02:35:36,280
[SPEAKER_07]: I am warning you, though.

2338
02:35:36,320 --> 02:35:39,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Tekken has gotten extremely complex over the years.

2339
02:35:40,081 --> 02:35:44,403
[SPEAKER_07]: The learning curve is as steep now as it ever was, or possibly steeper.

2340
02:35:45,223 --> 02:35:49,664
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as you're okay with that, enjoy your rental that you can actually do.

2341
02:35:50,676 --> 02:35:50,957
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2342
02:35:51,217 --> 02:35:51,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, all right.

2343
02:35:51,598 --> 02:35:51,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, buddy.

2344
02:35:52,018 --> 02:35:53,660
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to let you go to see if we can get one more call.

2345
02:35:53,700 --> 02:35:57,104
[SPEAKER_04]: But enjoy all the E3 stuff this week, and we'll talk to you later.

2346
02:35:58,186 --> 02:36:00,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we'll either enjoy it or not enjoy it.

2347
02:36:00,348 --> 02:36:00,889
[SPEAKER_07]: One of those.

2348
02:36:01,270 --> 02:36:01,810
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

2349
02:36:01,830 --> 02:36:02,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care.

2350
02:36:02,171 --> 02:36:03,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Have fun.

2351
02:36:03,252 --> 02:36:03,492
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2352
02:36:03,512 --> 02:36:03,933
[SPEAKER_04]: You too.

2353
02:36:04,233 --> 02:36:08,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this is the first year where we can't necessarily say we're going to enjoy it, are we?

2354
02:36:09,219 --> 02:36:12,661
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, 1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2355
02:36:12,681 --> 02:36:14,242
[SPEAKER_04]: We got time for about one more call here.

2356
02:36:14,922 --> 02:36:17,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Any last-minute stories while we're waiting for calls?

2357
02:36:17,563 --> 02:36:17,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2358
02:36:17,643 --> 02:36:18,544
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll get to Twitter topics?

2359
02:36:18,664 --> 02:36:19,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, actually, I do have one.

2360
02:36:20,165 --> 02:36:24,627
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a hack that was done for New Super Mario Bros.

2361
02:36:24,827 --> 02:36:26,108
[SPEAKER_03]: on the Wii.

2362
02:36:26,328 --> 02:36:27,508
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just been released.

2363
02:36:27,568 --> 02:36:30,610
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a total conversion for the game called Newer Super Mario Bros.,

2364
02:36:31,891 --> 02:36:59,231
[SPEAKER_03]: 120 all new levels remixed and original graphics to the game themes and music classic power-ups also new bosses and that kind of stuff and you can get it if you have a homebrew enabled Wii there's no piracy or hardware mods needed so I believe it's just a file like a save file that you put on there and you can download that at newerteam.com that's where you can find that hmm

2365
02:37:02,179 --> 02:37:02,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that it?

2366
02:37:03,300 --> 02:37:04,580
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to pull up Twitter here.

2367
02:37:04,860 --> 02:37:09,743
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been looking at the Xbox 720 checkpoint thing that came out last year.

2368
02:37:09,763 --> 02:37:12,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember the whole leak about VR and stuff?

2369
02:37:12,544 --> 02:37:15,586
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of it sounds exactly what they're talking about right now.

2370
02:37:15,666 --> 02:37:16,246
[SPEAKER_03]: So who knows?

2371
02:37:16,306 --> 02:37:19,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Next year maybe we might see some sort of Xbox glasses or something.

2372
02:37:20,108 --> 02:37:27,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, I mean, straight up even to their slogan that makes no fucking sense.

2373
02:37:27,752 --> 02:37:30,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Next generation entertainment, one box input one.

2374
02:37:34,114 --> 02:37:35,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you even do that?

2375
02:37:35,395 --> 02:37:38,817
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

2376
02:37:38,897 --> 02:37:39,257
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2377
02:37:40,358 --> 02:37:41,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's take another call.

2378
02:37:42,139 --> 02:37:43,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2379
02:37:43,220 --> 02:37:43,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2380
02:37:46,922 --> 02:37:48,263
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, this is Raginator.

2381
02:37:48,303 --> 02:37:49,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Raginator.

2382
02:37:49,203 --> 02:37:51,084
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say I didn't see the cam come on at first.

2383
02:37:51,144 --> 02:37:51,485
[SPEAKER_04]: There it is.

2384
02:37:51,805 --> 02:37:52,585
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, Raginator?

2385
02:37:54,466 --> 02:37:56,187
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a quick question.

2386
02:37:56,207 --> 02:37:57,408
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a loaded one.

2387
02:37:59,760 --> 02:38:04,925
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of touched on something, albeit briefly, earlier during the show.

2388
02:38:05,125 --> 02:38:13,955
[SPEAKER_00]: Rare has kind of hinted that they're working on something, and everyone's speculating that they're going to resuscitate an all-franchise.

2389
02:38:15,096 --> 02:38:19,521
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people seem to think it's going to be either Conker or Killer Instinct.

2390
02:38:20,181 --> 02:38:21,603
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on that?

2391
02:38:23,192 --> 02:38:30,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, well, we had a screenshot that was leaked, but I, you know, again, this is one of those anybody could have with a Photoshop.

2392
02:38:30,854 --> 02:38:31,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, did they prove it fake?

2393
02:38:32,215 --> 02:38:32,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2394
02:38:33,275 --> 02:38:34,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Proved it fake?

2395
02:38:34,095 --> 02:38:36,716
[SPEAKER_04]: You're talking about the one that has... That had, like, Banjo-Kazooie and Halo 5.

2396
02:38:46,852 --> 02:38:54,080
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's because that stuff that they got on there was either as wishful thinking and trademarks that they had already done.

2397
02:38:54,361 --> 02:38:55,502
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't anything new.

2398
02:38:55,742 --> 02:38:56,303
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fake.

2399
02:38:56,383 --> 02:38:59,587
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not going to be Banjo-Kazooie.

2400
02:38:59,667 --> 02:39:02,410
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it would be Banjo-Kazooie anyways because it wouldn't be that big a deal.

2401
02:39:02,430 --> 02:39:04,152
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be just kind of like, eh.

2402
02:39:04,572 --> 02:39:28,051
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever because they had a new banjo game and it was just it was all right but I'm gonna go with the easy answer and say Killer Instinct based off the whole trademark dispute that they got settled um there wouldn't have been a reason to do that otherwise I don't think if they didn't want to keep that door open for some reason and I think they know that's what everybody wants and especially with where they're going with all this you know DRM debacle um

2403
02:39:28,911 --> 02:39:57,418
[SPEAKER_04]: it's gonna take a franchise like that to make people you know what's it gonna take for you to sell your morals up the river essentially and it I mean honestly if Xbox could come out and say you know what we're gonna have we're gonna have Rob's fantasy games Mass Effect 4 the Guardian Legend 2 you know and the things I want to see it's gonna be hard for me to even go god I fucking hate what they're doing but I really really really want these games it's gonna be hard it's easy for me to sit here now and go

2404
02:39:57,958 --> 02:39:59,158
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need Halo 5.

2405
02:40:00,179 --> 02:40:02,219
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need a new Killer Instinct.

2406
02:40:02,900 --> 02:40:07,801
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need some of this other stuff they're talking about because I can kind of be satisfied with PlayStation 4.

2407
02:40:08,401 --> 02:40:10,382
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, and technically, we don't need any of it.

2408
02:40:10,482 --> 02:40:11,682
[SPEAKER_10]: We need air and water.

2409
02:40:12,822 --> 02:40:14,923
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I need Guardian Legend 2, Jamie.

2410
02:40:15,103 --> 02:40:15,503
[SPEAKER_04]: I need it.

2411
02:40:15,863 --> 02:40:16,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob.

2412
02:40:16,344 --> 02:40:16,764
[SPEAKER_04]: I need it.

2413
02:40:16,964 --> 02:40:17,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob.

2414
02:40:17,284 --> 02:40:17,704
[SPEAKER_04]: I need it!

2415
02:40:18,264 --> 02:40:18,784
[SPEAKER_10]: Intervention!

2416
02:40:19,484 --> 02:40:20,165
[SPEAKER_04]: What about you, Jamie?

2417
02:40:21,145 --> 02:40:21,385
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

2418
02:40:21,925 --> 02:40:22,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Rare franchise.

2419
02:40:23,226 --> 02:40:23,806
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming back.

2420
02:40:24,626 --> 02:40:25,386
[SPEAKER_10]: Killer Instinct.

2421
02:40:26,327 --> 02:40:27,167
[SPEAKER_04]: How about you, Ragenator?

2422
02:40:29,362 --> 02:40:55,735
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I would love to see another Killian State God only knows I played the Jesus out of the SNES port along with the N64 game but I'm a little concerned because now history has shown that both first priorities and third priorities tend to really

2423
02:40:56,997 --> 02:41:13,065
[SPEAKER_00]: Goverbard screw with a proven formula, and when they screw with a given formula that's proven to be a winner, a lot of people tend to revolt.

2424
02:41:13,785 --> 02:41:18,228
[SPEAKER_00]: Cases at point, Capcom is screwed with

2425
02:41:19,836 --> 02:41:23,998
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they had a final fight with Streetwise for PS2.

2426
02:41:24,078 --> 02:41:28,000
[SPEAKER_00]: Turned a 2D brawler into a 3D brawler.

2427
02:41:28,040 --> 02:41:29,321
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't do too well.

2428
02:41:31,547 --> 02:41:32,648
[SPEAKER_00]: Street Fighter EX3 was pretty good.

2429
02:41:56,481 --> 02:42:03,225
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say with Capcom too, since you brought up Mega Man, I think there's a very strong possibility Mega Man fans will finally have something to celebrate this week.

2430
02:42:03,666 --> 02:42:11,591
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that'll just be a little victory or something, but I just think the timing is right for Capcom to unveil what they're going to do with Mega Man.

2431
02:42:12,051 --> 02:42:12,731
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love to see it.

2432
02:42:12,911 --> 02:42:14,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Just don't screw it up.

2433
02:42:14,292 --> 02:42:15,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Make minor tweaks here and there.

2434
02:42:15,732 --> 02:42:15,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe

2435
02:42:41,753 --> 02:42:49,812
[SPEAKER_00]: and new characters, maybe a mechanic here or there, but don't go radically changing the game to the point where

2436
02:42:51,144 --> 02:42:54,145
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically a totally different game.

2437
02:42:54,806 --> 02:42:57,967
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only related to previous games by name only.

2438
02:42:57,987 --> 02:43:00,568
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to say it the other way.

2439
02:43:15,294 --> 02:43:17,696
[SPEAKER_04]: I asked because I just wanted to type Uranus.

2440
02:43:18,056 --> 02:43:18,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there you go.

2441
02:43:19,156 --> 02:43:20,677
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I read it there on air.

2442
02:43:20,777 --> 02:43:21,878
[SPEAKER_04]: So congratulations.

2443
02:43:21,898 --> 02:43:27,582
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I remember right, it would be three warps to Neptune and then three more to Uranus.

2444
02:43:28,837 --> 02:43:29,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2445
02:43:29,417 --> 02:43:31,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Six warps to Uranus, Ragenator.

2446
02:43:32,118 --> 02:43:34,399
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know it's corny.

2447
02:43:34,819 --> 02:43:36,179
[SPEAKER_00]: I came up with something.

2448
02:43:36,319 --> 02:43:37,720
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all right.

2449
02:43:37,860 --> 02:43:39,920
[SPEAKER_04]: So is the show, Ragenator.

2450
02:43:39,940 --> 02:43:40,401
[SPEAKER_04]: So is the show.

2451
02:43:40,681 --> 02:43:41,521
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, have a good one, buddy.

2452
02:43:41,681 --> 02:43:42,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good E3.

2453
02:43:42,101 --> 02:43:42,941
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, have a good one.

2454
02:43:43,121 --> 02:43:43,842
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, bye.

2455
02:43:45,522 --> 02:43:49,883
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like that's like wishing people a Merry Christmas or Happy Hanukkah.

2456
02:43:49,943 --> 02:43:54,645
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like you should wish video gamers a happy E3, even when E3 is going to be bad news.

2457
02:43:55,425 --> 02:43:56,206
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, you're our linguist.

2458
02:43:56,226 --> 02:43:57,647
[SPEAKER_04]: What should the greeting be to other gamers?

2459
02:44:19,684 --> 02:44:25,499
[SPEAKER_10]: Blessed E3 That might be a little too much Blessed E3 How about Blessed E3

2460
02:44:26,912 --> 02:44:27,893
[SPEAKER_10]: How about WankFreeE3?

2461
02:44:27,913 --> 02:44:32,578
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, maybe I'll throw that question to the chatters and see what they come up with.

2462
02:44:32,878 --> 02:44:34,660
[SPEAKER_04]: But for now, I am going to close the Skype line.

2463
02:44:34,680 --> 02:44:41,907
[SPEAKER_04]: If you do have further thoughts on any of tonight's topics, mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com or Twitter.com slash OLR.

2464
02:44:41,927 --> 02:44:45,951
[SPEAKER_03]: So a screenshot leaked from a brand new unannounced game.

2465
02:44:46,652 --> 02:44:46,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

2466
02:44:48,093 --> 02:44:50,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we kind of assumed it was coming.

2467
02:44:51,376 --> 02:44:53,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Just Dance, the new Just Dance game.

2468
02:44:53,577 --> 02:44:57,519
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna have the Ghostbusters theme in it because they have a screenshot where people are dressed up like Ghostbusters.

2469
02:44:59,199 --> 02:45:00,980
[SPEAKER_04]: That's in Just Dance 4, isn't it?

2470
02:45:02,020 --> 02:45:02,660
[SPEAKER_03]: You sure about that?

2471
02:45:06,942 --> 02:45:08,463
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob is up going to look, by the way.

2472
02:45:12,804 --> 02:45:17,226
[SPEAKER_10]: Now in the chat room, by the way, we have a call for a new Rival Schools series.

2473
02:45:17,326 --> 02:45:18,146
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, what are you looking at?

2474
02:45:19,327 --> 02:45:19,827
[SPEAKER_10]: Just Dance 4?

2475
02:45:21,601 --> 02:45:22,161
[SPEAKER_10]: He's reading.

2476
02:45:22,942 --> 02:45:24,823
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to take us a while because Rob's reading.

2477
02:45:25,383 --> 02:45:25,923
[SPEAKER_10]: Just kidding.

2478
02:45:29,865 --> 02:45:32,006
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, YYR, I can't click YouTube.

2479
02:45:32,206 --> 02:45:32,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe not.

2480
02:45:32,927 --> 02:45:34,067
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was in this.

2481
02:45:34,167 --> 02:45:37,649
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's official because it's actually on Xbox's website.

2482
02:45:37,769 --> 02:45:45,132
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you go to Xbox's Just Dance 2014 and they've got... Well, I mean, what a duh they're going to do a new Just Dance game.

2483
02:45:45,152 --> 02:45:45,713
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on.

2484
02:45:45,753 --> 02:45:48,114
[SPEAKER_04]: These games sell like crazy and it's not a bad game.

2485
02:45:49,813 --> 02:45:50,274
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

2486
02:46:01,192 --> 02:46:01,772
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2487
02:46:21,145 --> 02:46:25,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Tiger Claw talking about Mad Catz readying an Android console of their own.

2488
02:46:25,448 --> 02:46:27,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this like an Ouya type response?

2489
02:46:27,109 --> 02:46:27,709
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we are, yeah.

2490
02:46:28,450 --> 02:46:29,750
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like the Ouya.

2491
02:46:30,931 --> 02:46:33,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I like the idea a lot better than the Ouya.

2492
02:46:33,893 --> 02:46:37,315
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically going to be a console that plays Android games.

2493
02:46:37,515 --> 02:46:43,619
[SPEAKER_03]: It has the Google Play Store, and it plays any Android game, and you can actually map buttons onto stuff.

2494
02:46:44,219 --> 02:47:07,997
[SPEAKER_03]: so games that don't support touch or whatever you can use a mouse with them or do support touch you can use a mouse or you can use analog sticks to emulate touch but the fact that it doesn't require any special games it's just the games that you have or the games that you buy for like a dollar or free or whatever so I like that and their controller looks nice too it looks like an Xbox 360 controller

2495
02:47:08,437 --> 02:47:15,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it looks exactly like their Xbox 360 controller, their MLG controller.

2496
02:47:16,320 --> 02:47:17,280
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks exactly like that.

2497
02:47:18,361 --> 02:47:23,122
[SPEAKER_04]: And one other tweet from Tigerclaw tonight about Interplay getting an IP from THQ for $7,500.

2498
02:47:25,843 --> 02:47:28,065
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how much they paid for Free Space.

2499
02:47:28,966 --> 02:47:29,686
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good deal.

2500
02:47:29,746 --> 02:47:30,787
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great deal.

2501
02:47:31,688 --> 02:47:35,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Interstellar Combat Series that was developed by Volition and published by Interplay.

2502
02:47:35,872 --> 02:47:40,415
[SPEAKER_04]: It's back in Interplay's library after getting it back from THQ.

2503
02:47:40,596 --> 02:47:41,977
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

2504
02:47:42,958 --> 02:47:47,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Interplay, by the way, it should be noted, they never did lose the rights to sell Descent Free Space and Free Space 2.

2505
02:47:48,222 --> 02:47:49,223
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

2506
02:47:49,483 --> 02:47:56,077
[SPEAKER_10]: I want another Descent that is awesome that required more buttons than the other Descent games.

2507
02:47:56,919 --> 02:47:57,541
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be awesome.

2508
02:47:57,561 --> 02:47:59,405
[SPEAKER_10]: That required telekinesis to play.

2509
02:48:00,083 --> 02:48:03,805
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, thank you guys very much for your tweets at twitter.com slash OLR.

2510
02:48:04,165 --> 02:48:06,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of great stuff tonight, but it's about that time.

2511
02:48:06,967 --> 02:48:10,929
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got to wrap up the show and get everybody's final thought and all that.

2512
02:48:11,069 --> 02:48:12,410
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a consensus in the chat room.

2513
02:48:12,450 --> 02:48:12,791
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

2514
02:48:12,991 --> 02:48:14,031
[SPEAKER_10]: Rival Schools is awesome.

2515
02:48:14,371 --> 02:48:15,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Rival Schools is awesome.

2516
02:48:15,892 --> 02:48:17,153
[SPEAKER_04]: You should have put that on your list list.

2517
02:48:17,193 --> 02:48:17,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Too late.

2518
02:48:17,934 --> 02:48:20,055
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, okay, you know what?

2519
02:48:22,654 --> 02:48:29,798
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually, when I had a lot more disposable income, I paid 99 bucks to import the Justice Gakuen Evolution.

2520
02:48:30,658 --> 02:48:32,959
[SPEAKER_10]: And I played the hell out of it for days.

2521
02:48:33,059 --> 02:48:39,843
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's like, every time they would bring out, like one of the games for home, they'd take out something from the Japanese version that made it awesome.

2522
02:48:40,283 --> 02:48:43,145
[SPEAKER_10]: Like the board game mode in Project Justice.

2523
02:48:44,606 --> 02:48:51,293
[SPEAKER_10]: After you played through the board game, your custom character that you played the board game with would have stats based on how you played the game.

2524
02:48:52,194 --> 02:48:53,716
[SPEAKER_10]: And they just took that out.

2525
02:48:55,293 --> 02:49:02,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, guys, before I let you go tonight, I just want to say happy three, and let's hope the news isn't too terrible.

2526
02:49:02,416 --> 02:49:05,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hope there's a lot of good surprises and things that we will be excited about.

2527
02:49:06,518 --> 02:49:10,219
[SPEAKER_04]: I will be here during the day tomorrow during the press conferences, and I'll be around Tuesday, too.

2528
02:49:10,339 --> 02:49:11,760
[SPEAKER_04]: I will make a point to be in chat.

2529
02:49:12,140 --> 02:49:16,802
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want some folks to talk about the conferences, you want a live blog post,

2530
02:49:17,162 --> 02:49:22,483
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not really live blogging because I kind of think everybody's kind of watching it, but more like live discussion.

2531
02:49:22,903 --> 02:49:28,704
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to talk about what's going on at E3 with some like-minded individuals, I urge you to be at live.vognetwork.com.

2532
02:49:29,084 --> 02:49:32,905
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be there during the big preface conferences tomorrow, and we can talk about it.

2533
02:49:33,545 --> 02:49:34,545
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be there as well.

2534
02:49:35,006 --> 02:49:35,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you going to be there too?

2535
02:49:35,986 --> 02:49:39,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, because my boss is gone, so I don't have to really work there.

2536
02:49:40,147 --> 02:49:41,667
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all work-related anyways.

2537
02:49:41,707 --> 02:49:42,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

2538
02:49:42,327 --> 02:49:48,992
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be there at least for Microsoft and Sony but in the middle of the day DarkSakura and I might go on a friend date to take care of some stuff around town.

2539
02:49:49,072 --> 02:49:50,053
[SPEAKER_10]: YYR left another haiku.

2540
02:49:50,253 --> 02:49:50,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah?

2541
02:49:50,774 --> 02:49:51,815
