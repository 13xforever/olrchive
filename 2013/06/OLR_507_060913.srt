00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,920
Today, June 9th, 2013, Microsoft's controversial announcements could change the industry forever.

2
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,040
Zinga layoffs affect a developer they recently acquired, and E3 is next week and we're making

3
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:32,400
our predictions for the big show.

4
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,560
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

5
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,640
where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:44,960
It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 507 for this June 9th of 2013.

7
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,240
My name is Rob Roberts, joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,240
Greetings and salutations.

9
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,100
And I hope you're doing well, Ms. Summers.

10
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,100
I am.

11
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,100
I'm good.

12
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,100
I'm caffeinated.

13
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,100
Thank you, Rob.

14
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,100
Good to hear.

15
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,100
And also joining us tonight, Techmaster Loki.

16
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,900
Yes, definitely working in that Techmaster moniker this week.

17
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:04,900
How so?

18
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:05,900
Quickly.

19
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,900
I had to fix my laptop.

20
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,900
Oh, yeah.

21
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,900
Hard drive crash.

22
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,820
Yeah, I've been following your tweets, your Twitters, and all the hard drive drama.

23
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,620
But now it works pretty much like it did before.

24
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,620
All it needed was a little reformat.

25
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:21,540
All the non-essential stuff's not working, like some of these touch buttons up the top

26
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:27,020
here that I never use, or, you know, the icon's different now for the volume up and

27
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,020
down.

28
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,020
But, eh, whatever.

29
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,020
All right.

30
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,020
Big week this week.

31
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,780
E3, obviously, coming up.

32
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,180
Unfortunately, none of us attending this year.

33
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,160
Bobby Blackwolf from The Voice of Geeks Network at vognetwork.com, he is attending.

34
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,860
And if you haven't already checked it out, do check out the interactive coverage of E3,

35
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:49,140
presented in an all-new way at the voice of geeksnetwork of e3.vognetwork.com, or at least

36
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,140
we think it's an all-new way.

37
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,140
The internet's a big place.

38
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,140
Probably.

39
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,140
But very cool.

40
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,140
I haven't seen it.

41
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,780
Bobby will be on the show later to tell us a little more about that and participate with

42
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:03,340
us on something else, but I will table that until Part B. It's obviously a very big show

43
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,340
tonight.

44
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,980
There is a lot going on in the gaming world.

45
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,340
Usually we do a kickoff topic, but I think tonight we need to address the pink elephant

46
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,800
in the room.

47
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,100
Let's get into it, Loki.

48
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:20,540
So after the whole, well, I guess the promise was after the Xbox One press event thing that

49
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:27,100
they did back in May, that there was going to be some answers about, or clarification

50
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:35,300
I guess, on the big hot topics that they were getting grilled on after the event, basically.

51
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,540
What is the deal with the online connectivity?

52
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,620
How often do I need to connect to the internet?

53
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,580
How is the used game thing going to work?

54
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:49,220
And what's up with the Kinect having to be online all the time, or attached to your system

55
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,540
at all times of work?

56
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,540
So on Friday, I think it was Friday, was it Friday?

57
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,540
Yeah, the 6th.

58
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,140
On Friday, no, that was Thursday.

59
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:06,180
Anyways, on the 6th, they released a three page document, if you will, called Xbox One

60
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:13,260
Details on Connectivity, Licensing, and Privacy Features.

61
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,300
So let's just go through each one, shall we?

62
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:24,580
First, Xbox One, a modern connected device.

63
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:30,100
And to kind of spoil everything, none of this stuff is actually sounding any good.

64
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:36,060
It's pretty much just reinforcing what we already have heard, that they said, oh, we'll

65
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,060
make change.

66
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,300
So the Xbox One will deliver new benefits for gamers that are only possible with a system

67
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,620
designed from the ground up to be ready and connected.

68
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,740
Here are a few examples.

69
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,100
First generation games powered by the cloud.

70
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:54,860
So you'll be able to use the cloud servers to make your game more powerful or something.

71
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,940
Your Xbox One is always ready.

72
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,260
It's designed to run with, I guess, a low powered state.

73
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,260
OK, let's get to the good part.

74
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:09,780
Network technologies and network requirements, here we go.

75
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:15,720
For an optimal experience, we recommend a broadband connection of 1.5 megabits.

76
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:24,280
And also, in areas where, I guess, an ethernet connection is not available, you can connect

77
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,240
using mobile broadband.

78
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,480
Lucky you.

79
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,940
And also, while a persistent connection is not required, the Xbox One is designed to

80
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:37,480
verify if the system application or game updates are needed, and to see if you have acquired

81
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:44,160
new games, resold or traded in games, or have given a game to a friend.

82
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,960
Games that are designed to take advantage of the cloud system may require a connection.

83
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,360
And then, of course, with Xbox One, you can game offline for up to 24 hours on your primary

84
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,400
console or one hour if you're logged into a separate console accessing your library.

85
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:04,720
Offline gaming is not possible after these prescribed times until you reestablish a connection,

86
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,380
but you can still, oh, oh, and this is the best part, but guess what?

87
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:13,600
You can still watch live TV, enjoy your Blu-ray and DVD movies.

88
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,280
Oh, thank you, Xbox One.

89
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,960
I can still enjoy TV that you are connected to.

90
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,960
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to mourn the loss of the gaming industry.

91
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,160
Rest in peace.

92
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,440
All right, let's get to the next thing here.

93
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:40,840
All right, so next, how game licensing will work on the Xbox One.

94
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,360
And I'm glad that they have to tell me how it's gonna work.

95
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,160
Okay, so basically, you buy the games the way you want, disc or digital, and you'll

96
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,000
be able to buy them through traditional retailers or online through Xbox Live.

97
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,560
And it says, disc will continue to be a great way to install your game quickly.

98
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,520
Yes, to install, not play off of install.

99
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:05,440
You can access your entire games library from any Xbox One, no discs required.

100
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,840
Because after all, you're signing in and accessing the games that you have installed to your

101
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,680
system or the cloud or whatever it is.

102
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,560
You can share access with your games to everyone inside your home.

103
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,480
Your friends, family, and your guests and acquaintances get unlimited access to all

104
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,480
your games.

105
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,400
Anyone can play your games on your console regardless of whether you're logged in or

106
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,840
their relationship to you.

107
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:33,400
In other words, a feature that's been available on console gaming since the beginning of time.

108
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:38,440
That yes, if I bring a friend over, that they can play on the Xbox One without it going,

109
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,040
Who are you?

110
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,840
What are you doing trying to touch my controller and play this game?

111
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,120
Get your hands off my controller.

112
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,000
I need an adult.

113
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,080
You can share access, let's see, give your family access to your entire games library

114
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,080
anytime, anywhere.

115
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,700
Now this is kind of weird.

116
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,640
The Xbox One, I guess, they're going to have a way where up to 10 people of your family

117
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:09,920
or whoever you're seeing as your family can log in and play from your shared games library

118
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,600
on any Xbox One.

119
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:17,480
So if I buy a copy of say, Forza Motorsports or something like that, someone else can go

120
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:22,720
to a friend's house or whatever or from their own location and play that copy of Forza as

121
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,720
well.

122
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,560
But only one person can play at a time.

123
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,560
And not at launch.

124
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,000
None of this is available at launch.

125
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,880
All the good stuff, all the pros, not at launch.

126
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,640
I don't know if that's available at launch.

127
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,720
It doesn't say.

128
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,440
Trade in and resell your disc based games.

129
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,440
Okay.

130
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:45,960
It says today some gamers choose to sell their old disc based games back for cash and credit.

131
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:52,560
We've designed the Xbox One so game publishers can enable you to trade in your games at participating

132
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,560
retailers.

133
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,400
So it's an optional feature.

134
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,560
So no eBay, gone.

135
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,740
No flea markets, gone.

136
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,740
No garage sales, gone.

137
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:06,360
Authorized retailers only if the publisher allows it.

138
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,420
It's now not my choice on what I'm going to do with my game.

139
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,940
It's now Microsoft's choice or the publisher's choice on what I'm going to do with my game.

140
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:13,940
But we don't own it.

141
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,940
We're licensing it.

142
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,940
That's right.

143
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,460
It was never ours to begin with.

144
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:21,460
I don't sign a form when I'm playing these games.

145
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,460
Although I'm sure you're going to have to agree to it when you install your game.

146
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,460
Oh sure.

147
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:30,340
Press A to agree to the 500 page terms and conditions or you won't be able to play anything.

148
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,740
Because things are brick.

149
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:37,360
Let's see, Microsoft does not charge a platform fee to retailers, publishers, or consumers

150
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,880
for enabling transfer of these games.

151
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,660
Which I don't know, it kind of goes against what I've heard and what we've been hearing

152
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,660
rumors wise.

153
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,820
But maybe it's not Microsoft charging them.

154
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,140
Maybe it's the publisher's charging these guys.

155
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,340
I don't really know.

156
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,940
Whatever that doesn't.

157
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,500
All right.

158
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,020
So what are the key points out of this whole thing because we got to get to the bottom

159
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,020
line here.

160
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,020
Well a couple more.

161
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,020
Okay.

162
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,940
They're going to allow you to give your games to a friend.

163
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,460
So you can enable your disc based game, give it to a friend basically.

164
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,940
There's no fees.

165
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,220
But there's two requirements in order to transfer this to your friend.

166
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:18,860
They have to be on your friend's list for 30 days and you can only give the game once.

167
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:23,020
Once it's been transferred to them, I don't think that they can give it back to someone

168
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,020
else.

169
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,660
Now I don't know if that's clarified.

170
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,580
So no wishing for more wishes?

171
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,580
Yes.

172
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,580
Okay.

173
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:33,340
If it is where you can give it to somebody, you know, the friend's list thing is kind

174
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,900
of annoying, but like say you can give it to them and then they can give it to somebody

175
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:42,220
else, you know, that's not so bad, but it's still annoying.

176
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,220
You know what?

177
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,100
I will give credit where credit is due.

178
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,020
It sounds like Microsoft's trying to implement the Kindle book borrowing thing, which just

179
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:53,420
sounds a lot like, and I'm like, all right, that's cool because I know I lent out a lot

180
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,420
of video games.

181
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,420
I never get back.

182
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,420
So that's interesting.

183
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:01,420
It can be handled all digitally, but, um, you know, what am I having to give up?

184
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,860
What's the minus for this plus?

185
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,860
Right?

186
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,860
Yeah.

187
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:05,860
Okay.

188
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,860
And last but not least, I'll just breeze through this.

189
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:07,860
The connect stuff.

190
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:12,200
Um, they say you're in control of where the connect can see in here because I guess you

191
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,580
get to adjust your privacy settings or something.

192
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,860
So the system will navigate you through key privacy options like automatic or manual sign

193
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,260
in privacy settings and clear notification how data is used.

194
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,540
Wait, how is data being used?

195
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,980
So I'm assuming this thing is just going to be listening for, you know, advertising

196
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:28,980
purposes and stuff.

197
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:34,460
If they hear a lot of wank, a lot of porn, you're in control of what the connect or of

198
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:37,860
the connect sensor, um, sensing on, off or paused.

199
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:43,620
Um, you can turn off your Xbox one and um, you know, if they say it's only listening

200
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:48,340
for a single voice command of Xbox on, but come on, I'm sorry.

201
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:53,140
Uh, you're in control of your personal data and you can use other inputs to control your

202
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,460
games TV and entertainment experiences.

203
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,420
So once again, why do I need to connect, you know, attached to this thing?

204
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:02,700
If I can control it with a controller, it doesn't make it's, I'm going to be honest

205
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:07,560
and I'm not trying to be that snarky kid on Twitter, but I, I, I'm, this is really kind

206
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:12,580
of like a, it's a vague answer that they kind of gave to this like, so, so what does it

207
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,060
have to be on or not?

208
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:19,340
Well there's, it's basically, it has to be connected to your system, but I think you

209
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:23,860
can point it at the wall, you can turn your system off or something and then it won't

210
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,860
be listening.

211
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:29,100
Just don't underestimate the value of, of privacy and all that.

212
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,820
And this is really badly timed for Microsoft.

213
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:35,900
I mean, again, there's a lot of news that there's a lot of, there's a lot of news out

214
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,900
there right now.

215
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,900
I'm not trying to get political.

216
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,300
I'm not going to take the show there, but there's a lot of news right now about privacy

217
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,540
and Microsoft's names involved.

218
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,540
Exactly.

219
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:50,220
So this is not a good time to be requiring anything with that connect, just saying.

220
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,700
And they're, they're saying that they, you know, some of the examples, of course they've

221
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:57,180
mentioned before, a fitness game can measure your heart rate, give you feedback about your

222
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:02,020
exercise routine or whatever, be able to tell if you're a communist, a card game could allow

223
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:06,500
you to bluff your virtual opponent using your facial expressions.

224
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,100
But once again, you know, the connect could allow you to scan in your objects and use

225
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,020
them in real games.

226
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,020
That never happens.

227
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,020
So who knows?

228
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,500
Okay, so that's it.

229
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,500
That's basically the information.

230
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:22,620
Um, well, uh, here's the thing you ever seen that show Shark Tank, you ever watched that

231
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,620
show?

232
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,620
Yeah.

233
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,620
Yeah.

234
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,620
Here's the premise of the show.

235
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,540
These guys pitched their ideas to all these big executives.

236
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,860
Like Mark Cuban's one of the executives that sits there.

237
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,660
It's actually, as far as reality TV goes, it's one of the better shows.

238
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,300
Cause it's, it's a little more like these guys are real business makers and you kind

239
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,780
of see, like, I dunno, there, there's less of the pompousness that comes with the Donald

240
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:44,540
Trump business show and there's a little more like, you know, reality, I guess for

241
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,640
lack of a better term.

242
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,740
But anyway, the whole kitsch kitchens, there's, they're pitching their ideas and you know,

243
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,700
maybe it's a lady who's got a new idea for something for that women could have at their

244
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,700
weddings or a guy.

245
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:59,640
I just seem to remember an episode where a guy, uh, was selling man candles because that

246
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,700
ended up being a thing at like Yankee Canada, one of those later on.

247
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,700
Yeah, like mandels.

248
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,980
Well, anyway, the whole pitch is that as you're given these ideas, if one of the executive

249
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,700
says I'm out, that's their sign that they are not going to put a bid.

250
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,580
And if all four of them say I'm out, the guy loses, walks away, doesn't get the financing

251
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,580
they want.

252
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:20,540
And I got to admit after listening to this, this, this whole detail thing that's, that's

253
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,020
gone on this week, I'm kind of sitting in that chair.

254
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:27,600
And when I'm hearing about the whole, here's the minuses, here's a plus in the game trading

255
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,600
and all that.

256
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,940
But here's all these minuses that suddenly these $60 games may not be worth anything

257
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,940
anymore.

258
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,900
I do not have, that's what I hate the most.

259
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,860
I no longer have the power to sell this game on eBay.

260
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,340
If I want to do it, I have to go to a GameStop or a comparable store.

261
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,520
Are you kidding me?

262
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,740
That's not what I want.

263
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,980
And that's the point where I said, I'm out.

264
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:50,820
And on top of that, the plus is like, Oh, you can loan it to your friend.

265
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:55,740
Something I can do already right now with all these fucking restrictions and why, why

266
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,200
do I even, and that's the thing.

267
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,980
It's so sad that this has to happen because I want to be excited about this new console.

268
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:06,620
I wanted to be excited about the games that they're coming out with, but I'm sorry.

269
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,780
Even if there's like a new crackdown game or whatever, the big awesome game they're

270
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:13,860
going to show is all this stuff is just like right in front of me and it's like, well,

271
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,060
that sounds cool, but nope.

272
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:20,100
To me, it's very much like how I treat origin.

273
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,060
Battlefield 3 looks fucking amazing.

274
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,620
I really want to play that game.

275
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,340
I'm not installing origin, so therefore I'm not going to play the game.

276
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,340
That's it.

277
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,340
I mean, it's unfortunate.

278
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:33,820
These games look awesome, but all this stuff stands in my way, so I'm not going to do it.

279
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:39,420
For me, a lot of it is kind of about control and I feel like what's happening this console

280
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:44,940
generation that I just don't fucking like is that the publishers are trying to take

281
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:50,700
all these things away from me that I used to get as the investor in the game.

282
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,900
You know what I mean?

283
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:56,860
Like I used to be able to sell the used games and, you know, trade the games I wanted to

284
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,340
and they could put in the disc or whatever.

285
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:02,020
Like the publishers have been slowly thinking of ways to take that away and I just don't

286
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,020
like it.

287
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:09,940
I understand the cost of developing a game is super expensive and all that, but the line's

288
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,940
got to be drawn somewhere.

289
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,580
It doesn't have to be super expensive.

290
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:17,980
They decided to go big and, you know, big and bold, I guess, for their games.

291
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,980
It doesn't have to be.

292
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,220
Indie games that come out are still just as good.

293
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,020
How much does it cost to develop Minecraft?

294
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:27,340
Granted, it's not as visually stunning as something else, but it doesn't have to be

295
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,340
visually stunning.

296
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,340
It just has to be fun.

297
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,340
It has to be fun to play.

298
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,740
That's all it has to be.

299
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,980
Let me go to the chatroom.

300
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:37,260
Lots and lots of folks chatting on this and I don't want to ignore you guys, live.vognetwork.com

301
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:41,020
where we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern

302
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:45,300
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show as the Voice of the Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

303
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,980
YYR in chat starting us off tonight saying, Rob, this is the way the industry wants to

304
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,980
move.

305
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,380
I understand that, that this is the way the industry wants to move, but I have a right

306
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:57,180
to say I'm not moving with it and I think we all have that right.

307
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,180
Well, the industries don't determine what the consumers do.

308
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,780
The consumers determine what the industry should do.

309
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:07,260
I want to make, well, I want to make an analogy to where I think this is all going, but actually

310
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:11,020
first I want to address because I see numerous people in chat rooms saying, well, that's

311
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,020
it.

312
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:18,220
PS4 is for me this generation, but Monday hasn't happened yet, at least as of the taping

313
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,220
of the show.

314
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,300
I realized, you know, by the time some of you were hearing this on the podcast, Monday

315
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,580
may have already happened.

316
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:29,300
We don't really know where Sony's at and some of the signs point to they're going down a

317
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,300
similar path.

318
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,740
I think they are, but I don't think it's definitely, well, it's definitely not going to be part

319
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,060
of their presentation.

320
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:38,700
It's going to be people grilling them on it again and, I mean, look at all the stuff that's

321
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:44,340
happened before, you know, before all this, this, this whole three page thing came out,

322
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:50,380
there was reports going Microsoft canceled their after, you know, conference Q&A session.

323
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,900
They canceled their one-on-one interviews.

324
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,060
They just don't want to talk to people and then they put this stuff out and that's it.

325
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:01,860
They're just leaving it at that, but on top of all this, so you first off the whole game

326
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,620
sharing thing with your family and stuff.

327
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:07,940
Don't assume for one second that they're not going to expect each one of those people to

328
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:13,100
have live, you know, a paid subscription to live in order for that to happen.

329
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,380
And so why am I having to pay money for this console?

330
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:22,740
Pay money for live and like, it's like I had to pay for the privilege to be like fucked

331
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:27,180
over because you want to start, you're feeling greedy or something that you feel like we're

332
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,900
just not giving you enough money.

333
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:34,340
I also just don't like the fact that the Xbox has to talk to the servers once every 24 hours

334
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:38,580
because you know, it's not that I have a problem with it in theory or on paper.

335
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,660
Like you know, I do, I play a lot of MMOs.

336
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,980
Of course those talk to the servers.

337
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:48,720
I'm not so much caring about it in principle, but the reality is what's going to happen

338
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,820
when those servers go down because they will go down and history has shown that this is

339
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,820
what happens.

340
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,560
PlayStation network down for months due to a hack attack.

341
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,860
You don't think there's kiddies out there that want to hack this new network the minute

342
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:04,240
it goes up because they're angry too.

343
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,520
Xbox live goes down for a day or two at a time.

344
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,240
Granted, a lot of that is about maintenance, whatever.

345
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,600
But then we see things happen.

346
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,200
Diablo three, we can handle it.

347
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,200
We can handle it.

348
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,160
Crash, boom, error 37.

349
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,500
Sim city by EA.

350
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,500
We can handle it.

351
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,500
We can handle it.

352
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,500
Crash, boom.

353
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,500
It all goes down.

354
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,200
Xbox will go down.

355
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,120
What happens then?

356
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,480
You're not going to be able to convince me otherwise because history has shown it will

357
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,760
go down and what is going to happen.

358
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:39,920
Wank there is, there is no server on the face of the earth that has not, you know, that

359
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,960
has not gone down for any period of time.

360
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,920
I mean, I know they're saying that it's going to have a ton of, you know, they're going

361
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,720
to have a ton of servers or virtual servers or whatever, but they're going to have to

362
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,120
perform maintenance on these things.

363
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,360
It's got to go down for maintenance for a certain amount of time.

364
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,920
I mean, it's just, it's going to lock people out at some point.

365
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,760
Can we go back to PlayStation four though?

366
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:05,240
Because I do think there's a distinct possibility, at least some of this is going to be true

367
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,080
about Sony system as well.

368
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,080
Yeah.

369
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,800
Um, and to which parts not sure, but it seems like maybe the game registration, especially

370
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:16,320
in you, you, you told me before the show, you're banking a lot on EA's online pass and

371
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,360
their reason to get rid of that is because they've got the buy in from Sony and Microsoft

372
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,720
and they've given the finger to Nintendo essentially.

373
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,720
They won't.

374
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,720
Nintendo is nothing to them.

375
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,520
It's a very minimalist, minimal amount of copy.

376
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,520
They're belittling it.

377
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,520
Yeah.

378
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,880
So they, they just don't care about that right now.

379
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,520
But I think they wouldn't have gone all in if they didn't know that it was a guarantee

380
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,300
from both parties, both public or both, uh, console manufacturers.

381
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:46,440
And honestly, I just have a hot, especially we have to see how similar it is.

382
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:51,440
If it's very similar, I'm, there's some serious antitrust, you know, concerns there because

383
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,720
it's like, what are these guys just sit down and make, decide, Hey, we're going to do this.

384
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,760
This is how we're going to do this system.

385
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,380
And you know, we're going to both be on board and we're going to both benefit from it because

386
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,840
they're going to have no choice.

387
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,400
You know, we're going to get rid of options for them.

388
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,380
But I like, you know, even though there's all this negative information, I have to wait

389
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,680
until when the console come out before I can make my decision because they could very well,

390
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,320
hopefully, you know, say, fuck you guys.

391
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,800
You know, you know, seriously to EA.

392
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,840
What are they going to do?

393
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:27,400
They got to, you kind of get some balls here because what's Microsoft can do.

394
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,240
They can say, fuck you EA, what are you going to do?

395
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,800
Not publish games on our console.

396
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,240
And if Microsoft and Sony does that, what are they going to do?

397
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,480
Publish PC only?

398
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:40,440
I mean, they're not, they have to kind of agree on some sort of partnership here.

399
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:47,200
It's just, I mean, if Sony, let's just say in a perfect world, Sony would, you know, say,

400
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,200
okay, listen, we're not going to put up with this bullshit.

401
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,720
We're just going to keep things kind of the way they are right now.

402
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,800
And they could totally have this in the bag.

403
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,800
Easy, easy.

404
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:01,200
This generation could come out on top and just totally rule everything.

405
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,200
But I have a feeling that's not the case.

406
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,680
I don't think Microsoft would take a risk like that without, you know, knowing that

407
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,120
both parties are going to do that.

408
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,800
But yet there, you know, there's going to be some little differences in policy because

409
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:17,040
for instance, we heard last week about how Sony is mandating that there be off screen

410
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,280
play or whatever for PlayStation Vita.

411
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,840
So there are going to be little twists in the rules.

412
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:29,600
So you know, maybe, maybe, maybe Microsoft implemented, just, just theorizing a tinfoil

413
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:35,360
hat here, maybe Microsoft invented the whole game sharing Amazon Kindle thing to try and

414
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,880
put a little positive in a negative that they agreed to with Sony.

415
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,360
And maybe Sony is not going to have that.

416
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,520
Maybe Sony's, Sony's only got the negative and their positive is the PlayStation Vita

417
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,520
play.

418
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,960
You know, that kind of where one where we're trying to see who can come up with the best

419
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,920
silver lining to the shitty situation.

420
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,920
But see, that's the thing.

421
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:59,040
It's like, like I've, there's some people on Twitter and stuff and saying, hey, well,

422
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,000
the 10 game sharing thing is kind of cool.

423
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,280
I can share my games with someone else cause then I can cost average, you know, the games

424
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,280
I'm buying.

425
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,960
I'm like, but, but so what you can do that anyways, just, you know, you loan your games

426
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,200
to your friends if you really want to.

427
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,000
I just don't, I don't want to look, just say, well, at least they have this.

428
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,280
Okay, well that's good, but no, they're taking away all this stuff from us.

429
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,280
I'm sorry.

430
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,920
I'll just stick with what I've got right now and if I have to, I'll just go PC because

431
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:30,320
at least there there's flexibility with, I know, I know there's DRM with steam, but there's

432
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,120
also mods with steam.

433
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,900
There's also all sorts of customization.

434
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,600
There's indie games.

435
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,000
There's just insane sales on stuff.

436
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,040
I can honestly say yes, I use steam, but I have, I'm, I really think I maybe, maybe

437
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,960
ever bought one game, one game in the years I've owned steam.

438
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,520
I've bought one game full retail price and that would have been Civ five, a PC only game.

439
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,480
I never have.

440
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,400
And even when I could have gotten a, yeah, then it was stupid origin bullshit.

441
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:04,360
But when I bought mass effect three, for example, yeah, I bought it new, but I went and price

442
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,920
matched somewhere, so I didn't pay full price for it and didn't go through origin.

443
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,920
Oh yeah.

444
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,720
If they, if Microsoft were to announce at the end of their press conference, by the

445
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:17,600
way, uh, we're going to be lowering the price of games from $60 to $30 I I'm in, I'm back

446
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,600
in because if that's the plus that the games are now going to cost half as much, you know,

447
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,960
so okay, you know, I'll be back in, in a heartbeat.

448
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,960
It's not going to happen.

449
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,040
It's not going to happen because here's, what's going to happen.

450
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,040
Here's what it is.

451
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,360
You think that you're going to get better prices because now the stuff, now they're

452
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,100
getting rid of the used market, so to speak.

453
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,660
It's not going to happen because on PC you have multiple storefronts that are competing

454
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:45,000
with each other and yeah, it may be all steam DRM and stuff, but they're having sales all

455
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,120
across the board with Microsoft going this route.

456
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,920
Not only are you going to be limited where you can trade your game in, so right there

457
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:57,320
you're not going to get a really good deal as far as trading value goes because, Hey,

458
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,920
we're also going to go, we're your only options.

459
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,880
So your trading value is going to fucking suck to begin with and on top of that, you

460
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,120
think they're really going to mark down prices of games.

461
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:10,880
Hell, there's games on their Xbox games on demand service right now that are still way

462
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,460
above what you can actually get them in a disk space format.

463
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:16,200
So no, you're kidding yourself.

464
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,680
A couple of great comments in our chat room.

465
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:21,840
I want to get to Ahamkara in our chat says, I noticed Japan is not porting some of their

466
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,000
best games out of the country offer good games to themselves for cheap or free and don't

467
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
seem to care.

468
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,280
Funny how Microsoft is giving them the finger now by focusing on TV for Xbox one and not

469
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,720
caring about Japan as well.

470
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,280
Well, I mean, we've all kind of sat here going, well, clearly Microsoft's written off Japan,

471
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:43,120
but if Sony were to adopt these similar measures, how would that impact Japanese gaming culture?

472
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,120
Are Japanese game?

473
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,720
I mean, I honestly don't know.

474
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:52,040
Are Japanese gamers as willing to buy into all this?

475
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,600
I think that it's not necessarily going to work because from what, just from what I've

476
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,320
seen and of course we need somebody who lives there to confirm this.

477
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:05,960
There's a big culture around having collectibles being, you know, one of the campers to get

478
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:10,720
the game the first day, like the big lines around the Capcom store for whenever a Monster

479
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,480
Hunter game comes out.

480
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,920
It's a different type of culture.

481
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:20,940
Like, you know, we may have a few, maybe a few people standing in line for a new system

482
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:26,740
release or for having like maybe one super special game, you know, like the Madden ones,

483
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:30,060
but it's nowhere near the crazy levels that it happens in Japan.

484
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,060
Right.

485
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:35,580
You know, and then like, for example, I mean, I keep bringing up my stupid Cardcaptor Sakura

486
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,580
Dreamcast game.

487
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:41,820
It had a pillow pillowcase and a clock and a fork and a spoon and a dish.

488
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,820
Yes.

489
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:47,900
But I mean, and there was, um, a Sakura Taisen game that came out in the same type of bundle,

490
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:52,860
but I mean, there's lots of crazy-ass special editions that come out and people like their packaging.

491
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:56,780
Akuma JP, like clockwork, shows up in chat when you said, we need somebody from Japan

492
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:01,780
to be listening, but he just turned the station on, uh, we're talking about the, um, uh, Microsoft

493
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:04,200
Xbox one DRM restrictions.

494
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,300
And I was just kind of wondering if Sony's going down that same route, how, how does

495
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,020
that impact Japanese gaming culture?

496
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,820
Are the Japanese going to be as willing to buy into some of these restrictions?

497
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,100
I still think there's going to be physical packaging.

498
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:21,480
There's still going to be copies you can buy and sell because there is, I mean, there's

499
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,780
a big part of the economy around that and there's a big part of the culture around that

500
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:29,640
as I mean, you even see like a few people over here who like to get their import special

501
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,640
editions and everything.

502
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,640
All right.

503
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,640
One more comment.

504
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,640
I want to get here from chat.

505
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,540
And then I do kind of want to move on with the show because we have a lot of news to

506
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:38,800
cover in this pre E3 week, and I know we're going to get back to this topic during phone

507
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,800
calls tonight.

508
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,620
Uh, but I want to get this comment here from Koopa kid.

509
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:48,140
He says, thankfully, Nintendo isn't smart enough with online to be, to even be able

510
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,260
to implement these types of features.

511
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:53,700
You know, this is something I've kind of referenced in past episodes on the show when we were

512
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:58,500
all worried about this is that could Nintendo end up as the, you know, they're the right

513
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,300
now they're the dog in the corner chasing its tail, looking a little silly and everybody's

514
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,740
like, what a weird dog.

515
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:07,040
But now all of a sudden it's like, it's, it's the most attractive puppy in the room and

516
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,860
everybody might want to adopt it.

517
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:16,180
How is, has Nintendo's failure to embrace online, which granted probably is what drove

518
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,180
EA.

519
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:22,360
Does that suddenly make them the most attractive option to Japanese gamers, to people like

520
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:28,060
me that feel like I'm, I'm now for the, I don't want all these Draconia measures.

521
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:35,620
Honestly I would, if, if they put an Xbox, actually as I've been calling it the X bone

522
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:39,720
in front of me versus a Wii U, given me money and said, pick one to buy.

523
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,740
You can, you can buy one.

524
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:44,680
I would go for the Wii U. End of story.

525
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,480
I don't even care if it's just a glorified Wii.

526
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:51,760
I would pick that over the X bone because well, let's face it, I already have an Xbox

527
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,760
360.

528
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,000
I already have all this other stuff I can play.

529
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,240
If I had to pick one, it'd be the Wii U because I wouldn't have to be limited.

530
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,240
Loki do you have a thought?

531
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,200
Cause then I'm going to ask Jamie a very tough question.

532
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:08,820
Um, no, I still don't want a Wii U and the other reason it goes back to what the original

533
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,980
reason why I don't want a Wii U cause there's nothing I want to play on it and I don't really

534
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,420
consider a next gen console.

535
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:17,780
I mean, honestly, the stuff you're going to see on the Wii U, especially coming out of

536
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:22,380
new games is stuff that's going to be ported to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation three already.

537
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:26,700
I don't need to buy another console for games I can play on my console that I already have.

538
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,260
Now the only advantage I see, and it's been kind of, I've been thinking about more cause

539
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:35,200
my wife has been really hogging the TV, is that off, off screen or the, uh, you know,

540
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,160
second screenplay stuff is kind of cool because I do want to play console games a lot of times

541
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,720
and my wife wants to watch TV.

542
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,320
So you know, that is the only positive, but once again, it's, I don't want to buy a new

543
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,200
console just for that because I have my laptop, I can play on my laptop if really willing

544
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,200
to.

545
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,640
So it's just, no one's holding a gun to my head to force me to buy a new console.

546
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,640
I don't have to.

547
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:00,380
So I, you know, really, you know, if that's the thought process that they're going in

548
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:04,020
with it saying, well, you know, that's why EA can get rid of, you know, their online

549
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:07,380
passes because hey, they've got to buy another console at some point.

550
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:10,540
No, I don't, I don't have to do anything.

551
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,540
That's the thing.

552
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,120
I don't have to follow what you want me to do.

553
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,740
And don't think for one second that no one's going to figure out a way to put some sort

554
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:22,760
of device in between your console and the internet to fucking spoof that authentication

555
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,760
server.

556
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,980
I kind of think that's what's going to happen too.

557
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,200
The gamers going to hack, right?

558
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,200
It's going to happen.

559
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,200
They will.

560
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,200
And this will be a focus.

561
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,480
YYR in chat says all these draconian restrictions aren't going to send most gamers to, aren't

562
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,700
going to send most gamers to Wii U, the Nintendo fans will already buy one and everyone else

563
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,660
will just not buy a console.

564
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:43,640
I think if anything, I think people will still buy one next gen console, even though they

565
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:47,400
hate everything because they're like, well, I got to play Killer Instinct or I got to

566
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,400
play whatever.

567
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,540
You know, I always try to gauge this if, you know, in trying to, in the years I've been

568
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:57,340
doing the show and the commentary and everything, I find that the best insight comes from non-gamers

569
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,500
truly.

570
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:03,460
If I want to really get a feel for where people, where, you know, the America's head is really

571
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:07,180
at, I'm not going to look for it on Twitter, sorry guys, I'm not going to look for it with

572
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:11,100
you because we're a very unique, you know, smaller sort of subset fan base.

573
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:15,300
And I look to general people, people that don't consider themselves gamers.

574
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:19,200
And you know, this week I was on a work trip in Phoenix and I was with a couple of coworkers

575
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,340
and the subject of video games came up just randomly.

576
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:24,340
I think, I think somebody had asked about my podcast and I was talking about it kind

577
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:28,700
of casually and he mentioned, yeah, oh yeah, I really like Assassin's Creed and yeah, I

578
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:33,540
heard about that Xbox one, but I heard it's not going to play any of the used stuff.

579
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,540
I don't think I want to get one.

580
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,380
It sounds like it's too restrictive.

581
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:39,500
And I'm kind of just thinking in the back of my head, I'm like, I wonder if there's

582
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:43,300
a lot of people that, you know, when they just kind of hear what a friend of a friend

583
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,760
says to them, they're going to run with that.

584
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,340
You know what I mean?

585
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,820
Gamers will buy the console.

586
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,540
There'll be something on it.

587
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,300
There's always going to be the people there.

588
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,860
There will be PlayStation fours that sell.

589
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,540
There will be Xbox ones that sell.

590
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:59,980
Will they sell more than Wii U?

591
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:03,620
You know, I don't know, you know, the best time to buy an Xbox one's going to be the

592
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:07,780
end of the generation when they do eventually shut down those authentication servers.

593
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:13,340
And let's assume that they go the, you know, steam route and they unlock it so that you

594
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:16,480
don't have to call in every 24 hours, you know, it just works.

595
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,880
Or they can be fucking dicks and say, well, fuck, no, your shit's going to work now.

596
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:24,160
So let me ask Jamie the difficult question, then we'll move into our gaming week.

597
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,160
Okay.

598
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,160
All right.

599
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,680
And I opened this up to the chatters as well.

600
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,960
For the 11 years this month that we've been doing orange launch radio, we've always had

601
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,540
a mantra on this show 11 years.

602
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:38,080
And we're actually having a show on June 23rd this year, which is the birthday.

603
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,840
So anyway, that's only what, like three weeks away.

604
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,840
Holy crap.

605
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,840
I'd lost count.

606
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,840
Our 11th birthday is coming up y'all.

607
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,840
Okay.

608
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,880
So for the 11 years on this program, we've had a mantra on this show about gaming.

609
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,880
And that is a system is only as good as the games that are on it, but Microsoft's about

610
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:57,920
to unveil 15 exclusives, which might include some of the things we've been clamoring for

611
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:02,280
for a long time, killer instinct, you know, perhaps that Banjo Kazooie thing.

612
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,280
I don't know.

613
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:09,400
I'm going to fanboy wank here, but now because of all these things that the system is doing,

614
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:13,600
I'm coming back to question, is that mantra still true?

615
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:23,160
I think we may have to evolve it.

616
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:27,880
Because we've got a system now that's doing things that systems didn't do in the past.

617
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:33,720
We have a new restriction being placed on how they're trying to change how the system

618
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,520
works.

619
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:43,640
And so with that, I believe I'm trying to think of how to phrase this.

620
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:51,200
I think that the games themselves should speak for themselves, but they have to be made accessible.

621
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,080
If you don't have access to the game, it does you no good.

622
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:04,280
If it's not going to give you a way to play the game, that's I hope I'm making it's a

623
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,280
tough question.

624
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:10,280
It's tough to phrase, but I just kind of feel like the golden rule of gaming may finally

625
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:14,400
have shown a blemish this week.

626
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:19,240
I think that to be able to appreciate the game being on the system, you have to have

627
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,760
a system that's going to allow you to enjoy it.

628
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,760
Does that make sense?

629
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,760
Sure.

630
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,900
So like for it has to work.

631
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:30,680
It has to like for the Nintendo, you put the cartridge in the system and you know, it's

632
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,680
going to work.

633
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,320
Even if you blow on the cartridge 100 times, you know, it has to just work right.

634
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,760
But now we're calling into question, is this really going to work?

635
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,800
I have to quote Queen Simia, sprinkles on a turd don't make it any more tasty.

636
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:45,260
Um, cause actually, actually that's pretty much how it is.

637
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:49,760
I think that, Oh God, it's hard for me to say.

638
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,760
Okay.

639
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:55,220
Let me, let me try this from clerical error 404 in chat, uh, at live.vognetwork.com clerical

640
00:33:55,220 --> 00:34:00,160
error 404 says, I think the mantra needs to evolve in that it needs to have the games,

641
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:04,640
but also the versatility, the more games that are accessible by more people and potential

642
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,720
players.

643
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,720
Power to the players.

644
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,720
Right.

645
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,720
Agreed.

646
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:14,160
Uh, the evil G there, but here's, here's really where my thought is on this one.

647
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:18,960
And I hope this makes sense because I've been trying to, the thoughts clear in my head,

648
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,320
but it's kind of hard to bring into words.

649
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,000
A system is only as good as the games that are accessible on it.

650
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Preach.

651
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Okay.

652
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,900
But I'm using, I'm using example here.

653
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,140
Back in the day, like I'm going to use symphony of the night.

654
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,140
Okay.

655
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,140
For Saturn and for PlayStation.

656
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,700
Cause I've got them both.

657
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,220
I liked the Saturn version better.

658
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:43,360
It was accessible to me at the time because I could import it, but other people, but say

659
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:48,500
that I had no means of importing the game and all I had was a $20 copy that I bought

660
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:52,780
used at GameStop because you could buy the music GameStop, Ooh.

661
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:56,180
Well then I would say, well, of course I like the PlayStation version because I haven't

662
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,660
been able to play it on the Saturn.

663
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,900
I have no basis of comparison.

664
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:07,980
So say that you've got this system here that you don't want to invest in because of its

665
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,260
practices around the game.

666
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:13,420
Say the PS4 comes out and it's fully open and everything's nice and lovely and the same

667
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,420
games come out for it.

668
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:17,700
You're still going to go with the one that's more accessible to you because that's what

669
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,700
you have.

670
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,460
You have no basis of comparison saying X version is better.

671
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,820
Isn't necessarily fair because you can't compare it.

672
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:27,380
Is that the reason why I tend to buy games on the PlayStation three over the Xbox three

673
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:31,660
60 for the mere simple fact that I like the controller better?

674
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:35,980
Yeah, I mean that's really the same.

675
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:36,980
Not always.

676
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:40,060
Cause sometimes, sometimes, but then I go, if I want to play the game online with friends,

677
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:43,380
I go to the three 60 because it's got the better network.

678
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,380
Thank you.

679
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,380
Clerical error.

680
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,380
Four Oh four.

681
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,380
This is a set.

682
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:50,220
I learned as you for preferring the Saturn version just because I really like playing

683
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,220
as Maria.

684
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:52,220
Okay.

685
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,220
All right.

686
00:35:53,620 --> 00:36:00,860
The whole point is, is that the games being good to play is also determined by the other

687
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:03,220
factors that go into actually playing the game itself.

688
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:06,700
Like for you, the controller, like for me, I love playing Saturn games because the dual

689
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:13,940
analog controller does not hurt my hand even to this day, but playing, um, like I'm better

690
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:14,940
with RPG.

691
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:18,500
Like I like playing RPGs better now because I get to move my hand.

692
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:22,940
I don't have to keep moving my thumb around and, you know, pulling up my, uh, my scar

693
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:25,620
on my hand, all the scar tissue I've got.

694
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:31,700
So it's really going to be a matter of how you play it as well as the content itself.

695
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:36,780
And if it's not allowing you to access that content, then why bother?

696
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,780
All right.

697
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,780
Well, it's a complicated issue.

698
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:42,020
Any, any quick last words, Loki, you want to get in before we move on here?

699
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:47,900
No, it's just, I just disappointed that the news came out now and not after, because I

700
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:53,060
wish I could be a little bit excited about what Microsoft showing, but you sound like

701
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:57,220
a tweet I made earlier this week that every year I'm so excited about E3 and like, Yay,

702
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,220
new games.

703
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,220
Yay.

704
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,820
This year I really have a sense of dread about E3 this year.

705
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:04,380
It's about how am I getting fucked over this year?

706
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:10,380
Like, and I'm sorry to sound like that jaded gamers hate everything.com guy, but I'm not

707
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,460
going to lie to you.

708
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:15,700
That's where I'm at right now, whether I'm overreacting or not.

709
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:22,340
No, it's a lot of money you're asking me to drop on a console where it's not even really

710
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:26,780
my console.

711
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:30,900
At some point I got to put my foot down and say, I love video games, but no, I'm done.

712
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:34,440
Here's another question too, is how is the, how are they even going to enable this with

713
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,780
like the first sale doctrine and stuff?

714
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:41,180
Cause you know, I, I just don't know if they're going to say, well, you're licensing stuff

715
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,180
from us now.

716
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,380
Well, I don't know if they're going to be able to.

717
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:48,500
I think that that could, you could, well, considering how Sue happy everything is, I

718
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:52,780
think we could very well see that this is going to be a lawsuit within a year or so.

719
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,140
I forgot to make my analogy, so I'll make it quick.

720
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,140
Oh, I thought you did.

721
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,140
No, I didn't.

722
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,540
I make a lot of crazy analogies.

723
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,420
There's one I was sitting on all week.

724
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,620
Who remembers Divx?

725
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,620
Oh my God.

726
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:08,340
And I'm not talking about the codec on your computer that lets you watch movies and things

727
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,340
like that.

728
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:13,060
I'm talking about when there was actually a Divx player at circuit city, but it always

729
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:18,380
had to be connected online because you could rent the movies at the store and the thing

730
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,740
ended up flopping.

731
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:22,100
Why did the Divx flop?

732
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,420
Because of all the restrictions on it.

733
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:28,100
There weren't any games on it or any, no, there weren't any, uh, movies for it.

734
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,940
Well, there was, there was the same movies that were on DVD and laser disc.

735
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:34,780
Well, for the people who don't know what Divx is, just think of the little mascot from penny

736
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,780
arcade.

737
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:39,580
They have that little Divx player character that that's a Divx machine.

738
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:44,180
And I'm sorry, but right now what I'm hearing at X-Box one sounds very Divx to me.

739
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:52,180
And I think people rejected Divx because they wanted to own their shit and they didn't want

740
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:55,980
to have to keep dialing this server that was daddy Steven Spielberg, who was a co-owner

741
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,580
in this daddy Steven Spielberg.

742
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:02,380
May I watch this movie?

743
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:05,340
People want to have control in the end.

744
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,340
Yeah.

745
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:09,100
Game guru and chat Divx, the disc player that killed circuit city.

746
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,100
Absolutely.

747
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,020
It brought down an entire chain with it.

748
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:15,980
Don't think that the Divx didn't have a lasting negative impact on circuit city.

749
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:22,500
Well, and also, also keep in mind there, um, I just completely lost my train of thought.

750
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:28,620
No, it was, um, the fact that you still have people today that even though we've got iTunes

751
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:32,120
and we have all this digital distribution, there's still people who like to physically

752
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:36,980
go out and buy a disc who will prefer to buy their music on CD.

753
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,940
There's quite a few people in chat agreeing with you.

754
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:39,940
Yes.

755
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:40,940
Yeah.

756
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,500
I mean, I'm not necessarily one of them, but anyway.

757
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,500
All right.

758
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,140
Lots of passion behind this topic.

759
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:48,620
I'm sure we'll hear more about it during our phone call segment later, as well as the mailbag

760
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:51,180
mailbag at orange launch radio.com.

761
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,180
It's going to be a very interesting answer it.

762
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,180
I'm kidding.

763
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,060
It's going to be a very interesting E3 week.

764
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,060
That's all I have to say.

765
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:01,340
I, I, I'm really looking forward to next week's show when Sony will have to put it out on

766
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,540
the table because they didn't cancel their media stuff.

767
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:04,540
Right.

768
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,120
So they're going to have to answer this question.

769
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:09,340
And finally, we'll have a clearer picture to what things are going to look like come

770
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,620
this fall.

771
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:13,960
In the meantime, quickly, guys, how was your gaming week?

772
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,720
We always start off the show, haha, with how was your gaming week?

773
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,720
Dark soccer.

774
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,720
Start?

775
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:27,520
Um, well, I, after my kind of poo pooing on Star Trek online, I saw there was a new expansion.

776
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,240
So I decided to give it a try again and it's actually fun.

777
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,960
The legacy of Romulus expansion.

778
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:37,560
I mean, I just started off a character, but I had a really good time doing it and I really

779
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:42,620
liked what it added to the, uh, as I'm calling it, the main timeline lore.

780
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:43,820
It was really good.

781
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:49,300
So I've actually been enjoying that and they kind of set the skill trees back to how they

782
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,640
used to be.

783
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,320
Not necessarily exactly the same.

784
00:40:52,320 --> 00:41:00,240
And I kind of respect my Vice Admiral incorrectly, but still they, they did a lot of really cool

785
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,240
stuff.

786
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,560
Actually, I'll tell you what was funny because I was just running around on my Vice Admiral

787
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:09,200
because I have her pretty much, uh, permanently parked at a deep space nine.

788
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:14,000
They put Morin in Quark's bar and like as a big DS nine fan, that made me stupendously

789
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,760
happy and like it even had him like quote telling a story, even though he never talks,

790
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,320
it just sort of did a fade out and then shaking his head for Lornely and everything.

791
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,520
It was pretty funny.

792
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,280
Um, I did start Marvel heroes.

793
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,640
I do not care for it.

794
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:33,940
It reminded me a bit of playing, um, Marvel Ultimate Alliance without the fun part of

795
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:36,280
having other people to play with.

796
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,280
And the fact that...

797
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,400
Interesting because you're the first one I've heard say something negative about it.

798
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,880
I mean, everybody has their opinion.

799
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:42,880
I just, uh, interesting.

800
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,960
I'm not saying it wasn't fun and yeah, it's free to play, but if I wanted, but if I wanted

801
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:53,400
another character, I pretty much have to buy, um, 20 bucks worth of points for one character.

802
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:58,320
Or if I bought $40 worth of points, that would get me, you know, maybe three characters.

803
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:02,400
And the one that I really wanted to play, she had a Sprite for it, but she wasn't accessible

804
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:09,240
to buy because as I've made no, uh, no secret of this, my favorite Marvel character is Jessica

805
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,240
Jones because she's bad-ass.

806
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:14,940
Um, so anyway, I played through the whole first mission as Scarlet Witch and it was

807
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:21,360
just like a not quite as fun version of Marvel Ultimate Alliance and I would rather play

808
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,160
Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

809
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,160
I'm going to check.

810
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,640
I want to check out this Marvel Heroes game.

811
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:30,280
I just, I was busy this past week, so I didn't get a chance to check it out, but I want to...

812
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,280
It wasn't bad.

813
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:36,240
I'm going to say it wasn't bad, but it wasn't enough to make me want to spend any amount

814
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,240
of money on it.

815
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,320
I mean, I might play it a little bit more.

816
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,400
I've got Scarlet Witch.

817
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,400
She's pretty cool.

818
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:45,160
I almost picked Hawkeye because, you know, Hawkeye, but I went for her.

819
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,800
You just wanted to stare at his booty.

820
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,500
No, I'm, you know what?

821
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,760
That's objectification, Robin.

822
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,760
I take exception to that.

823
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,960
Um, but, uh, it was all right.

824
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:55,960
It was all right.

825
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:59,280
And as a male, I am totally okay with the objectification of Hawkeye.

826
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,280
Just saying.

827
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,200
Well, if it's Jeremy Renner, then yeah.

828
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:08,400
Um, no, but at any rate, um, I also, I, as I have said, I am back to play Mass Effect,

829
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,960
the first one.

830
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,480
Um, Dramamine does not work, Rob.

831
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:17,060
And I will tell you why I actually had Dramamine is because I got it from my trip to Alabama

832
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:20,560
and I decided to take Dramamine for my first Mako mission.

833
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,560
And it did not help.

834
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:25,400
I was nauseous in five seconds.

835
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:29,200
And then, um, yes, Claire, Claire, it's because it's Jeremy Renner.

836
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:38,840
I think he's pretty, um, and intelligent, and intelligent, um, but, uh, uh, what was

837
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:39,840
I saying?

838
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:40,840
Oh yeah.

839
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,360
Um, so I actually, uh, I have a high res mod.

840
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:49,040
Well, it's really, you have to sort of manually mod your INI files yourself and then use text

841
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,860
mod for the high resolution textures.

842
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:57,960
And I figured out that why my game kept shutting down is because it didn't have, um, uh, there's

843
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:03,800
like a little program you can run to make it accept, um, higher, uh, memory usage, which

844
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:08,000
I mean, I've got a card that, you know, gives me two extra gig of VRAM, so I don't know

845
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:16,400
what's going on, but I ended up, uh, getting that working and, uh, it was, uh, it was pretty

846
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,400
good.

847
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:22,000
And I actually, I can tell you this, that I don't get as sick as I did with some of

848
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,080
the higher res textures.

849
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:29,160
So I'm pretty much just running through the game and trying to get all the stuff I missed.

850
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:32,740
I'm actually also doing a different background than what I used to do because I always used

851
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:38,760
to do either a colonist or a spacer, but I would always do soul survivor and now I'm

852
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:42,780
doing a war hero, which is, it kind of changes up a few things, you know, you don't have

853
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:48,540
to deal with the hyperventilating, uh, slave girl and you'd still deal with a major asshole.

854
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:51,020
I'm sorry, Admiral asshole.

855
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:55,660
Um, the only thing I do, and I will give this as a flat warning for anyone who uses the

856
00:44:55,660 --> 00:45:01,220
texture replacement is it does mess up anyone wearing the dress blues because it will change

857
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:04,420
a texture to white and the hands to white, which is really bizarre.

858
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:06,700
But other than that, it's, it's super nice.

859
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,900
Everything looks beautiful.

860
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:14,640
And um, God, I was playing something else too, and I don't remember what it was.

861
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,060
I don't remember what it was.

862
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:17,340
We'll come back to you if you think of it.

863
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:20,100
Oh, Dan is really irritated with grid two.

864
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:21,100
Why?

865
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:24,740
Because he says that it does, that the collision detection in that game is just really shit.

866
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:25,740
I haven't played it.

867
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:27,140
Well, you know, he has that driving.

868
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:29,020
Oh no, I know he loves his driving rig.

869
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:30,660
He's he's a, he's a manly man.

870
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:31,660
Yeah.

871
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:32,660
All right.

872
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:33,660
Loki, how was your gaming week?

873
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:37,580
Uh, unfortunately I did not play, I don't think anything actually.

874
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:43,820
Uh, I, yeah, it's just, uh, the boss has been out all week, so they haven't played any

875
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:47,660
Call of Duty and uh, I didn't really play anything in the video.

876
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:51,060
I was working on my laptop for most of the week and then my laptop broke, so then I had

877
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:52,060
to fix my laptop.

878
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:53,300
So I've been busy with that.

879
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:58,380
So um, yeah, I did buy the, uh, the serious Sam bundle thing that they have on the humble

880
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,380
bundle weekly thing.

881
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:00,540
So that was kind of cool.

882
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:07,180
So we'll play some of that soon and um, just watch the Watch Dogs trailer for E3, the E3

883
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:08,180
trailer.

884
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:09,180
It looks fantastic.

885
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:10,180
I can't wait for that game.

886
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:11,180
Hmm.

887
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:12,180
So that just released tonight?

888
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:13,180
Uh, it leaked out.

889
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:14,180
Yeah.

890
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:15,180
Nice.

891
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:16,180
All right.

892
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:17,180
Anything else?

893
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:18,180
Uh, that is it.

894
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:20,180
Uh, I'm only really going to talk about one new game.

895
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:24,500
Uh, I, uh, was in Phoenix for a lot of the week for the day job, so that kind of kept

896
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:29,420
me away from most of my games besides iPad and portable games I've talked a lot about

897
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:30,420
on the show.

898
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:34,820
My random game to play on the airplane, thank heavens for the Game Boy Advance games and

899
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:40,900
the NES games and all that on the 3DS for the early adopters, Mario Kart Game Boy Advance.

900
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:44,860
I don't know why it actually is one of the weaker Mario Kart games, just control wise

901
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:48,860
and everything, but, uh, I just, just, I was like, I want to unlock the special cup.

902
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:49,860
So I did it.

903
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:53,820
Anyway, uh, the real game I've been playing a bit of at least the past couple of days

904
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:56,020
is Animal Crossing New Leaf.

905
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:59,580
It's the 3D version of Animal Crossing that just came out.

906
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:01,580
Um, what can I say?

907
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:03,020
It's Animal Crossing.

908
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:06,540
Some of the differences though, uh, I noticed that they put a lot of the stores that used

909
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:11,420
to be sprinkled throughout your town, not really the mall thing like the Wii did, but

910
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:16,060
there's a other side of the tracks now, like a main street where all the, like the nooks,

911
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:21,820
the Abel sisters, the, uh, Tom Nook, who's the, now the realtor, cause he gave the convenience

912
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:25,820
store to his kids and, uh, some other stuff is, uh, all that stuff's on the other side

913
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:26,820
of the tracks.

914
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:27,820
The museums there too.

915
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:31,060
So it's kind of neat to have kind of everything in that one place that really opens up your

916
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:34,700
town to have a little bit more of your design when it comes to the trees and the flowers

917
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:35,700
and all that.

918
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:40,380
Um, all the online experience is pretty much similar to what I noticed in the previous

919
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:41,380
games.

920
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:43,300
You open up your train gates and people can come visit.

921
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:46,020
In fact, I should open mine up and see if anyone comes to visit.

922
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:49,900
Uh, and then you can, uh, close them when you're ready for people to get out.

923
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:52,380
Uh, so a lot of that hasn't changed.

924
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:57,340
Um, but I know they brought the island back and there's a lot more fruits available thanks

925
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:58,340
to the island.

926
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:02,940
Um, some of the other things I noticed is that the story is a lot different because

927
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:03,940
now you're the mayor.

928
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:08,820
Uh, so you have an assistant, Isabella, who kind of helps you, or I'm assuming everybody

929
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:09,820
has the same one.

930
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:10,820
I don't even know.

931
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:13,780
Uh, but she kind of helps you through some of the earlier stages of the game.

932
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:18,320
And yes, it is still about paying off bell debt, but you know, animal crossing kind of

933
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,120
still remains that game.

934
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:23,520
It's kind of like the Facebook game that you don't have to have a lot of deep shame to

935
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:27,540
play cause you know, it doesn't have all that like click to invite all your friends.

936
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:31,780
But um, it's just kind of fun to grow your little neighborhood and interact with the

937
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:32,780
people.

938
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:36,180
And then the online element, uh, provides a lot of fun with that.

939
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:41,320
And it's 35 bucks since it's a handheld game, not 60 like a lot of console games cost.

940
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,220
So I think that's priced pretty good.

941
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:47,180
Sometimes you just want to do a little bit of fishing, donate it to the museum, make

942
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:48,180
some bells.

943
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:51,460
It seems like a lot of people I know are getting animal crossing and that's, I think the real

944
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:56,540
fun in it is just, you know, trading the fruits and writing nasty letters to somebody else's

945
00:48:56,540 --> 00:49:00,940
villagers and hoping they don't get too mad at what you're saying and all that.

946
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:04,860
So, um, yeah, I'm happy with my purchase of animal crossing, but, uh, I think most people

947
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:06,820
kind of know already what to expect with this.

948
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:09,740
Don't expect like a, a total reinvention of the franchise.

949
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:14,340
Um, but I wouldn't say it's as simple as, Ooh, now you can sit on a bench too.

950
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:15,580
There's a little more to it than that.

951
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:17,580
They, they did a little more design with it.

952
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:22,280
Um, it feels like a different game, especially if you put like the original GameCube game

953
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:23,540
next to this game.

954
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:26,740
You can really see how this series has evolved.

955
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:27,740
All right.

956
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:32,140
Uh, anyhow, let's get into a quick housekeeping.

957
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:39,020
Um, I mentioned this earlier in the show, but do keep an eye on this week, e3.vognetwork.com.

958
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:42,340
It is our interactive E3 experience at the voice of geeks network.

959
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:47,900
That's going to be led by a VOG networks, Bobby Black Wolf, who will be on the, uh,

960
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:50,140
the show floor at E3.

961
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:54,920
And he will be getting answers to your questions because once Bobby's, you know, done these

962
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:59,660
appointments and played some of the games, he wants to see what you guys want to hear

963
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:00,660
about.

964
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:04,660
But, uh, you know, all we ask, don't ask the obvious things that are already in the press

965
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:10,940
releases and don't ask about this stinking Xbox used game thing because, you know, we

966
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:15,380
all know they're not going to comment further on it, but you know, maybe there's a game

967
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:20,420
that you're not hearing enough about because all this new gen stuff is hogging the spotlight.

968
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:22,340
Maybe there's something else you want to hear more about.

969
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:27,540
You have a question about, maybe you're a very passionate fan of, I don't know, tech

970
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:30,660
in and you want to hear more information about to, although I don't think Namco Bandai has

971
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:31,660
a booth.

972
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:35,020
I don't remember, but you know, whatever it is, you want to hear more about it.

973
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:39,460
Uh, go take a look at e3.vognetwork.com and has all the information you need.

974
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:43,540
Question submissions open up after the Sony press conference tomorrow when we're really

975
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,660
going to know where things stand.

976
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:46,660
Okay.

977
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:50,420
Um, we'll hear from Bobby Black Wolf on that a little more later because we are going to

978
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:51,980
have a list list later tonight.

979
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:57,300
Uh, the thing we most want to see happen at e3 2013 that'll be in part B later in the

980
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:58,300
show.

981
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:01,820
But first let's run through through some gaming news and Loki start us off.

982
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:02,820
All right.

983
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:07,220
So there is a rumor going around that, um, GameStop is discontinuing the Wii U basic

984
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:10,220
after June 18th.

985
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:16,500
And um, basically, you know, the rumor comes from that they've been getting it like there's

986
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:21,220
an internal email saying that they're going to be, um, sending back all the, you know,

987
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:23,520
basic units and that kind of stuff.

988
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:29,200
Also um, Nintendo's followed up with this saying that there's current, a current misperception

989
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:33,660
about the Wii U hardware to clarify Nintendo is working with its retail partners to simply

990
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:39,700
rebalance the stock of white eight gigabyte systems and black 32 gigabyte Wii U models

991
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:40,700
in the market.

992
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:43,540
Consumers looking for either model will continue to find them available.

993
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:45,940
It doesn't make any sense to me, but okay.

994
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:52,240
Um, then of course there's a follow up to that where, um, another retailer was saying

995
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:57,780
that they received an email, um, that they're going to be recalling all the eight gigabyte

996
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:58,780
systems.

997
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:03,540
I think if anything, this has to do with the fact that they're talking about, um, putting

998
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:08,100
out a white, you know, um, made three, two gigabyte system.

999
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:11,380
I'm wondering if they're just going to get rid of the eight gigabyte system altogether

1000
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:13,900
because maybe that's not as popular.

1001
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:19,220
Um, I know a lot of people that buy Wii U's at least, you know, as far as my customers

1002
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:20,900
are concerned, not a lot of them.

1003
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,300
Who's buying the basics?

1004
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:23,300
Not a lot of people.

1005
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,580
They want the pack in game.

1006
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:26,460
They want the stuff that comes with the deluxe.

1007
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:29,660
I wouldn't be, I wouldn't blame Nintendo at all if they're phasing the basics out of the

1008
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:30,660
market.

1009
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:36,540
And I think if the 18, the 18th coincides well with, you know, being after E3, so maybe

1010
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:38,920
we'll get an announcement and that's my fingers.

1011
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:42,220
My re my real hope is that they're getting rid of the basics because they're going to

1012
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:46,260
drop the price of the deluxe is down to where the basics are.

1013
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:51,260
That would be phenomenal news and what a great opportunity for Nintendo to kick their competition

1014
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:57,100
in the balls while all this other talk about, you know, the usage restrictions and all this

1015
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:59,180
is going on.

1016
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:03,100
Nintendo could really strike them in the jugular and you might still hate everything that Nintendo

1017
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:06,620
has to offer, but you got to recognize that there's going to be a lot of people that are

1018
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:11,140
here for Mario Kart and, and Mario and all this wouldn't be that hard for them to refurbish

1019
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:15,780
all those old systems to pop that eight gigabyte storage chip off there and put three gigabyte

1020
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:16,900
chip there in place.

1021
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:17,900
Yeah.

1022
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:18,900
So it wouldn't be that hard.

1023
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:23,340
Some could very well could happen.

1024
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:26,940
Alan alchemy in our chat room at live.vog network.com says eight gigabytes is just an

1025
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:32,260
embarrassingly insufficient amount of memory by today's standards, period budget console

1026
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:34,100
or no.

1027
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:35,100
That's very true.

1028
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:36,220
It's not a lot.

1029
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:41,700
So Nintendo has got to catch up, but don't catch up too much to what else is going on

1030
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:42,700
in the world.

1031
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:48,820
Uh, moving on to other news out of E3, uh, Square Enix mentioning what they're going

1032
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:51,420
to be showing at their E3 booth.

1033
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:55,460
Sometimes things get left off of this, but, uh, you know, I'll, I'll, uh, say what there

1034
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:56,460
is so far.

1035
00:53:56,460 --> 00:54:02,620
Kingdom hearts, 1.5 remix on PlayStation three final fantasy 14, a realm reborn, uh, which

1036
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:03,620
makes sense.

1037
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:06,900
Cause I believe beta three starts next week comes out in August.

1038
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:07,900
Yeah.

1039
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:08,900
So they're, they're counting down there.

1040
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:10,820
They've also changed restrictions on the beta stuff.

1041
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:11,820
Yes.

1042
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:12,820
NDA is lifted.

1043
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:16,900
So, but still no, um, you're not allowed to say anything on the previous betas.

1044
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:17,900
Okay.

1045
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:22,520
Well, all I got to tell you is next OLR, no live streaming next OLR.

1046
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:23,520
We got a lot to say.

1047
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:28,880
Realm reborn, uh, lightning returns final fantasy 13 being shown off, which I believe

1048
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:32,960
also a release date got spotted on a banner and it's February 14.

1049
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:33,960
Yeah.

1050
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:39,000
Uh, final fantasy 10 and 10, two HD remaster for the Vita and PlayStation three deus X

1051
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,520
human revolution director's cut for Wii U and thief.

1052
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,560
Another big title on its way.

1053
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:50,080
Now, um, there are rumors that there could be something additional there as well.

1054
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:57,240
Apparently the future of final fantasy being teased for Tuesday, June 11th, nine AM, uh,

1055
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:03,720
rumors and rumblings suggesting it's final fantasy 15, uh, whether that is what 13 verses

1056
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:09,600
has been put through a remodel and that's now 15 or maybe this news is just 13 verses.

1057
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:13,360
No, it's going to be something new for the PlayStation four and the, probably the Xbox

1058
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:17,240
one, because remember the PlayStation four of it, they showed the same fucking trailer

1059
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:22,540
that they had before and they're like, and we'll have more to announce that E3, you know,

1060
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:25,440
so it's, it's going to be something new for next gen.

1061
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,760
It's probably going to be using their new engine that they have.

1062
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:28,760
It is sad to me though.

1063
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:32,360
The dragon quest 10 just probably isn't going to happen over here, is it?

1064
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:36,280
I was kind of hoping that maybe they would announce Saturday three, but that maybe they

1065
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:37,760
were just going to solely back Wii U.

1066
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:44,320
I really wish they would try with dragon quest 10, but let's try the dragon quest series

1067
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:45,680
does have a following.

1068
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:46,680
It sure does.

1069
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:51,440
And sure, the following is bigger in Japan, but to write it off here, I don't know.

1070
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,200
Maybe dragon quest nine didn't sell well enough.

1071
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:57,920
I also remember they had dragon quests, uh, monsters or whatever that are the one that

1072
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:58,920
they came out over here.

1073
00:55:58,920 --> 00:55:59,920
That was the Wii game.

1074
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:05,480
That was first person that did not do well, so all right, moving on.

1075
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:06,480
Quest swords.

1076
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,480
That's what it was.

1077
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:08,480
Yeah.

1078
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:09,480
Well this, this is purely rumor.

1079
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:10,480
Okay.

1080
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,480
So I'm just going to go ahead and spit it out there.

1081
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:12,920
Allegedly stuff.

1082
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:19,780
Um, there is a rumor going around that Microsoft has been paying off, uh, third party developers

1083
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:26,320
not to show off anything for PlayStation four either on stage or at their booths that Microsoft

1084
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:29,480
has resorted to paying them off for this.

1085
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:34,760
Now I don't know if this is true or not, but the, um, the report came from a source on

1086
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:39,800
Neogaf that's done a lot of true.

1087
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,400
Here is your nice big salt lick.

1088
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,400
Exactly.

1089
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,400
To go with this.

1090
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,400
Exactly.

1091
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:50,360
But it did come from someone who in the past has been reliable.

1092
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:57,840
Well this now, this would put way in the column of maybe Sony isn't in the same camp as Microsoft

1093
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:01,720
because otherwise it's, what are you so afraid of Microsoft?

1094
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:07,080
Well, the whole point is that the theory is that if this is really what's going on, the

1095
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:09,520
Microsoft is trying to give the illusion that they're going to have more games available

1096
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,080
than the PS4 will.

1097
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:12,960
Which would make them look more attractive.

1098
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:17,440
And it's not that Microsoft and Sony haven't bought, you know, struck at each other financially

1099
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,440
before.

1100
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:21,520
I mean, what, uh, Microsoft got a lot of DLC agreements.

1101
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:25,880
Uh, Sony got the whole, uh, valve tie in portal.

1102
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:29,120
Like everybody bought portal two on PlayStation three because everything, well, not everybody,

1103
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:33,720
but a lot of people did because of, you know, their agreements with valve and steam integration,

1104
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:34,720
which was really good.

1105
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:35,720
I got mine on steam.

1106
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:36,720
Yeah.

1107
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:37,720
Well, you got, you bought it.

1108
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:38,720
It was a gift, but still.

1109
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:39,720
Well, you bought it on PS3 and you got it on both.

1110
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:40,720
No, I didn't.

1111
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:44,080
You did, but I mean, I didn't care about it on PS3 at all.

1112
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:47,000
I got it on, on windows.

1113
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,880
So paying for exclusives and paying off for stuff like that, that's not really, but it's

1114
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:54,640
just in light of everything else going on in the gaming industry is what makes a lot

1115
00:57:54,640 --> 00:58:01,440
of people kind of leech onto this news is, Ooh, yeah, well, and it could just be something

1116
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:07,100
that was thrown out there for the purpose of, uh, you know, making Microsoft look bad

1117
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:08,100
too.

1118
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:14,460
But at the same time, they don't need a Neo GAF thread to do that.

1119
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:20,100
I don't know that at this point that I would put anything past, past them right now, especially

1120
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:23,620
since this type of shit goes on all the time in the corporate world.

1121
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:28,060
So saying, but isn't it weird how Microsoft and Sony would have had to agree to this thing.

1122
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:31,020
And then now they strike at each other in corporate warfare and these other ways.

1123
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:35,140
It's really, it's kind of sick in some ways.

1124
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:36,580
Welcome to corporate America.

1125
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:39,580
Well, welcome to the world corporation.

1126
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:45,740
I know, I know, I know, but I'm saying it's business and in the end what people, what

1127
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:49,740
companies most care about is their bottom line and they will do what they can to increase

1128
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:50,740
it.

1129
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:51,740
End of story.

1130
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:52,740
Loki.

1131
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:53,740
All right.

1132
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:58,600
Um, so let's see, let's talk a little bit about plants versus zombies.

1133
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:03,280
And um, you may remember they had an announcement for plants versus zombies too.

1134
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,280
It's about time.

1135
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:09,520
Well now there's some actual, uh, banners being spotted at E3 showing plants versus

1136
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,760
zombies garden warfare.

1137
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:13,040
I am excited.

1138
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:16,360
Which is, um, rumors to be true.

1139
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:20,480
I think they were saying that it's a multiplayer first person shooter game.

1140
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:24,920
So I am no longer excited.

1141
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:27,560
Well, there's still the plants versus zombies too.

1142
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:29,000
I'm excited about that.

1143
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
The first person shooter?

1144
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
No.

1145
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Yeah.

1146
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:37,160
I remember, I remember actually hearing about that before, so it'll be interesting to see

1147
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:38,320
what that's like.

1148
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:42,480
I'm thinking maybe a little bit like that Batman, um, what was it?

1149
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:52,280
The uh, the uh, Batman game that they had on the Xbox live arcade, uh, Gotham imposter

1150
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:57,120
or yeah, that one, Oh, the Gotham kids or something like that.

1151
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:58,120
I don't like it.

1152
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,120
Yeah.

1153
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:01,120
It's like, uh, somebody in chattel yell it out.

1154
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:02,120
I don't remember.

1155
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:03,120
Anyways.

1156
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:05,440
Um, Oh, neat.

1157
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:11,840
I guess we'll have to, you know, hear about it on, uh, during E3 or EA's press conference.

1158
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,380
I guess they're going to have that on Monday.

1159
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:16,240
So I'm watching all of those.

1160
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:17,240
That'd be fantastic.

1161
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:18,240
And yeah, me too.

1162
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,200
You want to hear something kind of funny off topic here a little bit.

1163
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:23,040
Um, I was looking on new gap just a second here.

1164
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:27,120
Um, they put out a reminder that there was this thing that leaked last year.

1165
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:29,360
Remember about their kind of a game plan.

1166
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:30,360
Yeah.

1167
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:37,120
And, uh, the, the actual marketing position that they had on, uh, their, you know, for

1168
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:40,600
2013 is this one box input one.

1169
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:45,320
So that, that's the same slogan that they have at E3 now.

1170
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:49,080
So playing a little bit more to maybe that was legitimate.

1171
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:50,080
Yeah.

1172
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:51,080
Huh?

1173
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:54,680
It's always nice when those rumors end up being true a year after the fact, right.

1174
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:59,280
In retrospect, Oh, we could have known all along if we would just believe this one rumor.

1175
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,720
Well, it still shows through 2015.

1176
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:05,320
So, you know, I guess we'll have to see, you know, what that's all about.

1177
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:08,520
Uh, Akuma JP in our chat room with a very interesting comparison.

1178
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:12,680
We were talking earlier, the whole corporate warfare with, um, Sony and Microsoft Akuma

1179
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:16,800
JP in our chat says, look at Apple and Samsung.

1180
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:21,040
That's another good comparison because those two, they have to work together for some things,

1181
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:25,200
but then they're at each other's throats with courts and lawsuits and everything.

1182
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,520
It's, um, fascinating how that all works.

1183
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:28,520
Okay.

1184
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:33,440
Here's if, if that member of that whole thing, uh, the, you know, PDF that came out last

1185
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,440
year.

1186
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:41,080
So here's what the next game plan then would be for to Zilla glasses, digital glasses that

1187
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:44,200
allow you to see 3d objects in your living room.

1188
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,920
That's augmented reality stuff.

1189
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:50,920
So that's going to be next year, apparently according to the roadmap.

1190
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:52,200
What about the alumina room?

1191
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:54,760
When's that supposed to be a thing next year too, I think.

1192
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:55,760
Hmm.

1193
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:56,760
Hmm.

1194
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:57,760
Interesting.

1195
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
All right.

1196
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,640
Um, moving on, I talked earlier in the show about animal crossing and I know one reason

1197
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:05,480
everybody loved the game cube version of animal crossing.

1198
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:10,160
And some people arguably say it's their favorite is because it had all the classic NES games

1199
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,160
in it.

1200
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:15,480
Remember how you could play punch out and clue clue land and all these Nintendo games

1201
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:16,480
in animal crossing.

1202
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:22,880
Well, this will probably be a bit of a duh, but in an interview with the Katsuya Eguchi,

1203
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:27,920
um, he basically, and this is an interview, uh, that he had out there, he said that please

1204
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:32,800
consider it's not happening ever again in regards to virtual console at the time of

1205
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:36,800
animal crossing on the game cube, we didn't have a virtual console system.

1206
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:40,720
We thought the playing games inside of a game is kind of funny and we wanted to do it, but

1207
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:43,840
now there's a virtual console where you can play classic games.

1208
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:46,360
So we don't think we'll be doing that in future titles.

1209
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:50,600
So kind of confirmation that, yeah, they're not going to bring those NES games back in

1210
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:54,200
the other systems and it's really virtual console's fault because they can make money

1211
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,800
selling those games separately.

1212
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:59,320
However, part of the reason I want to bring this up is because when I was reading this

1213
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:05,040
article on destructoid.com who ran with this article, I really liked an idea that was proposed.

1214
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:08,760
Now I wanted to kind of put this out there by the author of destructoid.com who said,

1215
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:13,000
uh, there's more that could be done to appease those looking for retro flavor in a new animal

1216
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,340
crossing adventure.

1217
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:19,720
A nice compromise would be to include some special eight bit animal crossing themed games

1218
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:21,400
in the next entry of the series.

1219
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:26,120
Um, in the game cube title, tortimer might give you a fake NES game called super tortimer

1220
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:27,680
on April 1st.

1221
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:31,760
What if super tortimer were playable, a little 10 minute long platformer starring a turtle

1222
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:37,000
mayor and maybe a few other fake but fun lo-fi NES on animal crossing mini games.

1223
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,480
And I'm like, I love that idea.

1224
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:41,020
That's a fantastic, fantastic idea.

1225
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:44,640
Like what, you know, just silly little flash games to be collectible.

1226
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:47,520
I think that would be a great thing for the series granted, you know, it's going to be

1227
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:52,060
a lot of development costs and somebody's got to design all that design as a contest.

1228
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:53,360
You have a bunch of indie dev.

1229
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:55,460
I was just a crowdsource the fucker.

1230
01:03:55,460 --> 01:04:00,320
You just have a bunch of indie devs just creating a bit shit for it and you could even market

1231
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:02,600
that as a reason to buy the game, but I don't know.

1232
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:06,040
I just don't see Nintendo as somebody who would, uh, crowdsource like that.

1233
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:07,040
You know what I mean?

1234
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:09,480
But yeah, that would be awesome.

1235
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:10,480
Too bad.

1236
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:13,840
Oh, you know, Nintendo, if you're thinking about that Wii U version of animal crossing,

1237
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:17,480
here's a, Oh, Oh, this could, this could really bring a lot of people back.

1238
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:23,760
Or just, you know, maybe just give us, you know, those NES games.

1239
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:28,960
Cause come on, you've already made your money back and then like, who the fuck's going to

1240
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,360
buy clue clue land.

1241
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:31,360
Let's be real.

1242
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:32,360
It wasn't that good.

1243
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:34,880
Donkey Kong math or who's going to buy that shit.

1244
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,280
Come on.

1245
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:40,320
Um, what you would buy donkey Kong math.

1246
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:45,320
No, but I have picked up a copy of clue clue land when I saw it at the store.

1247
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:46,320
You're a nerd though.

1248
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,320
Shut up.

1249
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:48,320
I have memories of clue clue land.

1250
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:49,320
Don't, don't judge me.

1251
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:53,320
Uh, while I are in chat says, but I do have to buy a third party hack this to unlock them

1252
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:54,320
all this time.

1253
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:55,320
Um, yeah.

1254
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:59,320
Cause remember super Mario brothers and Zelda were in the original animal crossing, but

1255
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:01,320
you couldn't get them without a code.

1256
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:03,320
Like they were never actually given out.

1257
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:09,320
You had to get, you had to code them to do it, uh, or, or use the link from Hyrule website

1258
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:12,320
that was big back in the day where everybody had the same character name.

1259
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:14,320
So you could just gift yourself all this stuff.

1260
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:15,320
Pretty funny.

1261
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:18,320
Um, what else do I want to say with that?

1262
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:22,320
Uh, Oh, here's one other thing I would say is that if they do these whole like little

1263
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:27,320
flash games that they put inside animal crossing, they could almost one up virtual console.

1264
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:33,320
And like, how about little achievements within animal crossing and leaderboards within animal

1265
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:34,320
crossing.

1266
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:39,320
Suddenly animal crossing is what we all thought PlayStation home was going to be.

1267
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:41,320
Think about it.

1268
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:42,320
Womp, womp.

1269
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:43,320
All right.

1270
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:44,320
Anyway.

1271
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:50,320
Well, how about, uh, something that's a little bit happier, Rob?

1272
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:51,320
Okay.

1273
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:54,320
Um, how about something that has nothing to do with Nintendo?

1274
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:57,320
I don't know if that's going to be happier this week.

1275
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:01,320
Nintendo is kind of my, my safe room.

1276
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:03,320
Nintendo is my safe word this week.

1277
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:08,320
Remember if it gets a little bit too hard for you, just say PlayStation.

1278
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:17,320
Uh, this actually has to do with, um, an exclusive for PS3 that will be, uh, launching on Tuesday.

1279
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:19,320
Tekken revolution is going to be on PS3.

1280
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:21,320
It will be free to play.

1281
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:25,320
And you know, me and my Tekken, I worked for Namco.

1282
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:29,320
I remember Tekken three and trying to predict who the next character would be.

1283
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:30,320
So I have to say that.

1284
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,320
And trying to predict who the next character would be.

1285
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:36,320
So I have special, special love of, of anything Tekken.

1286
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:39,320
Especially anything that has a Jin Kazama in it.

1287
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:41,320
Yeah, but isn't this just going to be the dumb trading card game?

1288
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:42,320
You know what?

1289
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:48,320
It says, um, that, uh, basically it's going to be, I'm trying to see what it says.

1290
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:51,320
It's going to be, uh, yes.

1291
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:57,320
Being, um, referred to as a new version of Tekken card tournament, which you know, it's funny.

1292
01:06:57,320 --> 01:07:00,320
I even had the stupid Tekken card game on the wondrous one.

1293
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:03,320
So I will go to links to play anything Tekken.

1294
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:05,320
So I'm just saying, don't judge me.

1295
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:06,320
At least this one's free.

1296
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:08,320
Yeah. I like free.

1297
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:10,320
Who doesn't?

1298
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:11,320
Especially cause I'm broke.

1299
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:14,320
Well, if you hate free and you want to buy something this week.

1300
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:15,320
Get the X bone.

1301
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:19,320
If you hate freedom, buy an Xbox one.

1302
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:23,320
No, uh, seriously, what is coming out this week around the world?

1303
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:24,320
US first Loki.

1304
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:25,320
Nothing really.

1305
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:28,320
Um, well one game, the last of us on Friday.

1306
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:29,320
On Friday.

1307
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:31,320
Arguably a big fucking game.

1308
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:34,320
Yeah. Great reviews, but Friday?

1309
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:35,320
What?

1310
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:38,320
Well, you know, got to get down on Friday.

1311
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,320
I guess, you know, they want to make sure.

1312
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:42,320
Got to get down to Disneyland.

1313
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:47,320
Want to make sure that it isn't released on Tuesday with all that, you know, E3 news getting, you know, lost in the shuffle there.

1314
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:48,320
So, all right.

1315
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:51,320
Well, traveling to Japan and seeing if there's anything additional this week.

1316
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:54,320
Um, not so much on the PlayStation 3.

1317
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,320
PlayStation 3 is looking pretty empty this week.

1318
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:57,320
Xbox 360.

1319
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:58,320
You'd be surprised.

1320
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:00,320
There is a game on Xbox 360 this week.

1321
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:04,320
It's called Giga Force and Esketos Wonder Pack.

1322
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:07,320
I don't know if that's just like the combination, like a combination two for one thing.

1323
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:09,320
Yeah, it is definitely a two for one pack.

1324
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:10,320
I'm looking at the box art.

1325
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:13,320
These look to be 3D spacey shooter games.

1326
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:15,320
Like, uh, mechs.

1327
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:17,320
Oh, it's, is this?

1328
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:19,320
Oh, it's got classic games in there too.

1329
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:20,320
I see.

1330
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:22,320
Judgment, Silver Sword, Cardinal Sins.

1331
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:27,320
If you're a SHMUP fan, this might be the compilation for you.

1332
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:29,320
That is out on the Xbox 360 this week.

1333
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:33,320
Is it just me or does Xbox 360 get so many SHMUPs over in Japan?

1334
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:35,320
Like, it's the SHMUP console.

1335
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:36,320
Oh, that's good to know.

1336
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:40,320
Yeah, but especially, uh, bullet hell games?

1337
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:41,320
Please.

1338
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:44,320
Uh, looking at the other systems.

1339
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:46,320
Sadly, not a lot this week.

1340
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:49,320
3DS is really the only other thing that's seeing some releases.

1341
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:52,320
Donkey Kong Returns makes its way to Japan this week.

1342
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:56,320
And, uh, there's a Nintendo metallic red 3DS to match.

1343
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:59,320
Also, one other game from Square Enix this week.

1344
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:04,320
Chusoku Henkai Gyro Zetter, Albatross no Tsubasa comes out this week.

1345
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:05,320
And this is...

1346
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:07,320
Wings of the Albatross?

1347
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:12,320
Yes, it looks like another mech fighting game slash role playing game type thing.

1348
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:18,320
Aren't Albatrosses usually associated with bad modical things?

1349
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:22,320
Maybe they're mechs that swim, Dark Sakura. I don't know.

1350
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:24,320
I don't think Albatrosses can swim.

1351
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:27,320
I think they just die and hang around your neck.

1352
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:34,320
Speaking of dying and hanging around your neck, I'm done with the Japanese game releases this week.

1353
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:36,320
Well, we have a few things for the UK.

1354
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:40,320
On the 11th, we have Tekken Revolution, as I brought up earlier.

1355
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:43,320
On the 12th, we have Xenoclash on the Xbox 360.

1356
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:48,320
And on the 14th, Animal Crossing 3DS, Chemical Spillage Simulation for PC,

1357
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:52,320
which actually just sounds hilarious without knowing anything about it.

1358
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:54,320
And then The Last of Us on PS3.

1359
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:56,320
That's it.

1360
01:09:57,320 --> 01:10:00,320
Stick a fork in it, speaking of dead things.

1361
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:03,320
Okay, um, let's see.

1362
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:08,320
There is some interesting controversy with this game, Vampire Smile,

1363
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:14,320
which was one of those, well, it originally started off as the Dishwasher,

1364
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:19,320
one of the first Xbox indie games that they showed off.

1365
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:23,320
Actually, I think while they were introducing indie games,

1366
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:26,320
or what did it used to be called? Community games? Way back in the day?

1367
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:31,320
Anyway, so the sequel to Dishwasher, the Vampire Smile, was coming to PC.

1368
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:38,320
But originally, the first way it came to the PC was a hacker,

1369
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:41,320
I guess a developer, Barbarus.

1370
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:45,320
He really wanted to see the game come to PC, so he cracked a version of it

1371
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:47,320
and uploaded it, I guess, to the internet.

1372
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:50,320
And so he kind of ported it to PC.

1373
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:55,320
Well now, it's actually coming officially to PC as well,

1374
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:59,320
because they weren't too happy with the fact that he cracked the game and stuff.

1375
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:05,320
So, new Director's Cut is going to have some enhancements to the game and some more...

1376
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:07,320
That's not a good precedent to set, though.

1377
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:11,320
Like, you know, hack our game and we'll put it on the console you want.

1378
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:14,320
They didn't remember, was it Sonic Generations?

1379
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:16,320
They had the Sonic...

1380
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:20,320
The hell is the crappy one with the werehog?

1381
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:23,320
They had all the daylight missions from that game.

1382
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:26,320
Ask this one. I don't know, I can't tell all those Sonic games apart.

1383
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:27,320
She can.

1384
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:29,320
Which Sonic game? Sonic Unleashed, I think it was.

1385
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:30,320
I hadn't played that one.

1386
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:36,320
Yeah, Sonic Unleashed, they had the daytime levels from that ported over to Sonic Generations for the PC,

1387
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:38,320
because it never came out on PC.

1388
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:41,320
I do have Sonic Generations and I haven't even played it yet.

1389
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:48,320
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

1390
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:51,320
use the passphrase, TICKET.

1391
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:55,320
To answer a code, man, I don't acknowledge that in my universe.

1392
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:59,320
What? Acknowledge what? Don't have a one-sided conversation here.

1393
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:00,320
Kiefer Sutherland.

1394
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,320
Hey, that's coming up later in the show. Stop spoiling things.

1395
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:03,320
I know.

1396
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:04,320
Stop spoiling it.

1397
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:05,320
I still don't like thinking about it.

1398
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:06,320
Spoiler. Alright.

1399
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,320
You know what, Rob?

1400
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:11,320
What? No spoilers here. This is news.

1401
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:15,320
This is about Starcraft 2. I will admit this is the one Blizzard franchise I don't play a lot of.

1402
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:18,320
I owned the very first game, I didn't bother with the expansion.

1403
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:21,320
But, apparently, I may not need it.

1404
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:25,320
Because there's a new system in Starcraft 2 that Blizzard did this week called spawning.

1405
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:30,320
And I thought that meant maybe a new enemy unit. Isn't that what zergs do? They spawn a lot of zergs.

1406
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:37,320
But, anyway, what happens is you get free access to gameplay features when somebody who doesn't own a certain version of the game

1407
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:39,320
parties with someone who did.

1408
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:44,320
So, in other words, when you go into multiplayer, you play the most current version of the game owned by at least one person at the party.

1409
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:49,320
So, if you have the free starter edition, but you come play with me and I have Starcraft 2 basic edition,

1410
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:52,320
we're now both playing Starcraft 2 basic edition.

1411
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:57,320
So, that's kind of cool. That's like DS1 cartridge play or something like that.

1412
01:12:57,320 --> 01:13:01,320
If I party up with somebody playing Heart of the Swarm, we both get to play Heart of the Swarm.

1413
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:06,320
It's been rolling out globally since June 4th when this was announced.

1414
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:12,320
I don't know what regions do and don't have it at this time, but this is something that is planned for everybody.

1415
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:15,320
So, that's kind of awesome, actually.

1416
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:20,320
Because if you have a core group of four friends that you just want to do nothing but play Starcraft with,

1417
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:23,320
maybe one of you is a big Starcraft nerd, but the others aren't so much,

1418
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:29,320
one person buys the game, everybody mooches off it, and you just don't play otherwise.

1419
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:31,320
That's kind of cool.

1420
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:32,320
Yes.

1421
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:35,320
It's almost like if you had a game and then you load it to their friends,

1422
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:39,320
and then they got really excited about the game and bought the sequel and it came out at launch.

1423
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:41,320
Oh, we can't have that.

1424
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:44,320
We can't. We can't do that. It cuts into developer money.

1425
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,320
To be fair, although I love your tongue-in-cheek point there,

1426
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:51,320
let's not forget Starcraft 2 does require an always-online connection just because that's the nature of the game.

1427
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:56,320
You're right, because the PC marketplace is completely different than the console marketplace.

1428
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:59,320
Because they don't require an online connection there either.

1429
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:04,320
Can we go back to a time when there wasn't any of this always-online bullshit?

1430
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:09,320
Although I will say, I do love my MMOs. I do love me my MMOs.

1431
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:12,320
However, I also love classic games, and that's why every week on the show,

1432
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:15,320
DarkSakura jumps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,

1433
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:20,320
hey, kids, play this game or I'm going to cut you.

1434
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:24,320
I cut you off with my razor-sharp wit.

1435
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:27,320
DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week this week?

1436
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:29,320
Star Gladiator.

1437
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:35,320
Or as it was called over here, Star Gladiator Episode 1 Final Crusade.

1438
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:38,320
Yeah, Episode 1 Final Crusade. What's up with that?

1439
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:41,320
Okay, so anyway, it came out in 1996.

1440
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:46,320
It was a 3D fighting game done by Capcom for the PlayStation.

1441
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:51,320
Well, actually for the ZN1 arcade, which was basically a glorified PlayStation.

1442
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:56,320
It was their first polygon fighting game.

1443
01:14:56,320 --> 01:15:02,320
It actually came out before Street Fighter EX, so this was kind of a big thing for them.

1444
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:08,320
It was a pretty neat little game, I mean, as far as a 3D fighter goes.

1445
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:16,320
It didn't use the six button thing. It used a four button configuration.

1446
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:21,320
It was a lot like how the Soul Edge and Soul Calibur games went.

1447
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:26,320
You had a 3D plane. You could do ring outs. It was that type of game.

1448
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:32,320
It wasn't really anything that was special as far as 3D fighting games at the time,

1449
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:35,320
but the fact that it was Capcom's first makes it notable.

1450
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:40,320
It also had these things called plasma reverses that are guard moves

1451
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:45,320
that you have to release at a particular point in time in the battle,

1452
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:49,320
where it will enable you to deflect an incoming move and stun them

1453
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:53,320
so that you could actually attack in reverse.

1454
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:59,320
It also does extra damage as well.

1455
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:05,320
It also had a combo system so that you could basically just pummel people to death.

1456
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:11,320
In the arcade mode, it was ten fights, and depending on who you chose as your character,

1457
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:15,320
you had a specific set of opponents that you would fight.

1458
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:17,320
It was actually a pretty good game.

1459
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:20,320
You see some notable characters in there that showed up in other Capcom games,

1460
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:24,320
like Hayato showed up in Marvel vs. Capcom 2,

1461
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:31,320
and he had an appearance in Tatunoko vs. Capcom in the Tekkaman Blade ending,

1462
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:34,320
which actually kind of made me giddy at the time.

1463
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:41,320
And there was Jun, who was also in the background stages of Gem Fighter,

1464
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:45,320
and in Capcom vs. SNK 2,

1465
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:50,320
and in one of the wind poses of Hayato in Marvel vs. Capcom 2.

1466
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:54,320
And she was also in Hawkeye's ending in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3

1467
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:57,320
as a member of the West Coast Avengers, which, actually, that was pretty crazy,

1468
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:59,320
because I beat that game with him.

1469
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:07,320
There was Saturn Dyer, Gamoth, Gogri, Franco, Garrett, Vector, Rim Gal,

1470
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:09,320
who was Jun's dad.

1471
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:13,320
There's a bunch of people in the game, anyway.

1472
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:22,320
It was a really neat game in that it used both English and Japanese voice acting

1473
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:25,320
for the characters.

1474
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:34,320
And it also spawned a Dreamcast game that was called Plasma Sword,

1475
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:38,320
Nightmare of Bliss, which is actually me finding my Dreamcast copies,

1476
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:41,320
what made me think of the PlayStation version.

1477
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:43,320
But it was a really neat game.

1478
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:53,320
I mean, for all of the stuff that it did, it may not seem a big deal today,

1479
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:55,320
but when it came out, I thought it was a really cool game.

1480
01:17:55,320 --> 01:18:01,320
So, Star Gladiator, you win Classic Game of the Week.

1481
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:05,320
I have to admit, I didn't know a lot about this game until I'm kind of watching the,

1482
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:07,320
as with a lot of these classic games you pick.

1483
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:09,320
I didn't know a lot about this one, but I'm watching it and I'm like,

1484
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:11,320
wow, this looked pretty good for a PlayStation 1 game.

1485
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:14,320
It looks a little more Dreamcast level to me.

1486
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:16,320
Is it late PS1?

1487
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:18,320
I'd say it was late PS1.

1488
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:25,320
But you should see Star Gladiator was actually a really fun little fighter.

1489
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:29,320
It had its issues just about with any PlayStation 1 game at the time,

1490
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:34,320
but you should really see Plasma Sword because that was really fun, too.

1491
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:37,320
This character here, June, I really like her, too.

1492
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:38,320
With the chakram?

1493
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:41,320
Yeah, well, she reminds me of that chicken Soul Calibur, Tina, I think it is,

1494
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:44,320
with a similar feel, the big disc.

1495
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:49,320
And actually, that's who I played this game most with was June.

1496
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:53,320
But you should, one of these days we'll have to hook up the Dreamcast

1497
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:54,320
and I'll bring over Plasma Sword.

1498
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:55,320
I have a Dreamcast.

1499
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:56,320
So do I.

1500
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:57,320
In fact.

1501
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:59,320
But I have Plasma Sword and I will bring it over.

1502
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:02,320
This is why I need to get game streaming on my TV

1503
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:06,320
because we need to do some classic NES game streaming through the Dreamcast emulation.

1504
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:07,320
Good times.

1505
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:09,320
That would be wrong, but funny.

1506
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:12,320
All right, there it is, the classic game of the week, Star Gladiator.

1507
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:13,320
Star Gladiator.

1508
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:17,320
Oh, actually, I need to point out, Cleric Player 404 did remind me.

1509
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:20,320
She's using the combo attack of Chun-Li and Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo.

1510
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:21,320
Who was?

1511
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:22,320
June.

1512
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:23,320
Really?

1513
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:24,320
Yes.

1514
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:25,320
I don't remember that.

1515
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:26,320
Well, there were cosplay.

1516
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:28,320
I mean, not that I believe you, but I'm just...

1517
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:30,320
There were costume combos, remember?

1518
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:32,320
Where people would dress up as different...

1519
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:34,320
Oh, yeah.

1520
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:38,320
And like, I think one of Ibuki's was like the Miko costume

1521
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:43,320
and Sakura had a bunch of different ones and one of Chun-Li's was June.

1522
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:44,320
All right.

1523
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:46,320
From Star Gladiator.

1524
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:47,320
All right.

1525
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:48,320
Very cool.

1526
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:52,320
All right, we got plenty more show to go here.

1527
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:55,320
Coming up with Part B tonight, we have a list list coming up tonight.

1528
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:57,320
Few surprises in store with list list tonight.

1529
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:58,320
That's all I'm going to say.

1530
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:00,320
You are definitely going to want to be here live for this.

1531
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:02,320
Sorry to the podcasters in advance.

1532
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:04,320
Very cool live feature tonight.

1533
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:06,320
And the Fugu question of the week as well.

1534
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:09,320
And rapid fire news, the mailbag, FUs of the Week,

1535
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:14,320
and your calls at 1-877-GAMO-LR and username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1536
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:17,320
All when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1537
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:27,320
Hi there.

1538
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:30,320
This is Flaco Jones and you're participating with Orange Lounge Radio,

1539
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:32,320
the show where every gamer has a voice.

1540
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:35,320
And I want to use my voice to tell you you should all play Ni No Kuni.

1541
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:36,320
It's great.

1542
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:38,320
Rob, you should beat Ni No Kuni.

1543
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:40,320
And now that I said it in the bumper, you have to beat Ni No Kuni

1544
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:42,320
or you have to play this bumper forever.

1545
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:46,320
Looks like I'm playing the bumper forever because I still haven't beat Ni No Kuni.

1546
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:48,320
You can lend me your copy then.

1547
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:49,320
You want to hear a true story?

1548
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:51,320
I came in the other day, Ni No Kuni.

1549
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:52,320
I came back from Phoenix.

1550
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:54,320
My copy of Ni No Kuni is on the floor and I'm like,

1551
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:55,320
oh, it's on the floor.

1552
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:58,320
That means Alan must have picked it up and started playing it at some point, right?

1553
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,320
And he said, oh, no, I used it to put kitty treats on.

1554
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:03,320
Can I borrow it, though?

1555
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:06,320
Yeah, if you're actually going to play it, then yes.

1556
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:07,320
I will.

1557
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:08,320
Okay, I think you'll like it, actually.

1558
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:09,320
So, yes, you may borrow it.

1559
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:10,320
I'm fun employed.

1560
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,320
I think Flaco would approve of that.

1561
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:14,320
Yes, we did recycle a message this week.

1562
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:16,320
That means we could use some new bumpers.

1563
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:20,320
I did get one today, to be fair, so I'll put that in for next week.

1564
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:25,320
But if you want to submit a bumper as well, you can get all the information at the Voice Geeks Network,

1565
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:26,320
voggenetwork.com.

1566
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:28,320
Click on forums and look at the OLR forum.

1567
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:32,320
It's right there at the top in a sticky thread how you can get your voice in a bumper on the show.

1568
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:35,320
And you can tell the listeners whatever you want, within reason.

1569
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:40,320
I even did one in not that great Japanese, but thanks to Kuma JP for correcting my grammar.

1570
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:45,320
Oh, I'm talking about the ones that, not the ones that play on the network, but the ones that bring us back here.

1571
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:47,320
But I'm planning on actually doing one.

1572
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:48,320
But you're on the show.

1573
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:50,320
I can do a bumper.

1574
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:51,320
No, you can't.

1575
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:52,320
Yes, I can.

1576
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:53,320
Do a bumper for Bobby's show.

1577
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:54,320
I'll do one for Bobby.

1578
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:58,320
I'll do one for Bobby that says, hey, listen to this show, dammit.

1579
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:03,320
Hey, hey, listen, hey, listen, hey, listen.

1580
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:05,320
But I have to make it high-pitched.

1581
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:06,320
Hey, listen.

1582
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:11,320
Anyhow, plenty more to come here on this half of Orange Lounge Radio.

1583
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:13,320
But first, some rapid-fire news.

1584
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:16,320
Let's take care of a lot of news this week in rapid-fire news.

1585
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:22,320
Yes, so it sort of leaked out, and then it got announced, Halo Spartan Assault.

1586
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:31,320
It's coming out for all your favorite gaming platforms, including Windows 8 PCs, tablets, and phones.

1587
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:35,320
And those are Windows 8 devices, by the way.

1588
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:38,320
Windows Phone, Surface tablets.

1589
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:47,320
Yeah, and apparently it's going to be set between Halo 3 and 4, and is a twin-six shooter.

1590
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:51,320
So, totally the title you're looking for.

1591
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:57,320
There's some free-to-play games coming to the PlayStation 4.

1592
01:22:57,320 --> 01:23:03,320
PlanetSide 2 and DC Universe Online have both been confirmed for the PlayStation 4,

1593
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:06,320
although I'm not surprised because it's Sony Online, so you know.

1594
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:08,320
Those are Sony Online games.

1595
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:12,320
But somewhere I hear Brad from PodCulture squeeing about the DC Universe Online.

1596
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:13,320
Just call it a hunch.

1597
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:14,320
Yeah.

1598
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:15,320
If his internet's back up.

1599
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:17,320
So, those will both be coming out.

1600
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:22,320
And also, Warframe is going to be coming as well as a free-to-play title.

1601
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:25,320
And, yeah.

1602
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:31,320
So, I guess we're going to see a lot of free-to-play games on PlayStation 4, so that could be good or bad.

1603
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:32,320
I don't know.

1604
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:33,320
Free-to-play is not...

1605
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:36,320
I like that business model, so we'll see.

1606
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:38,320
You like free?

1607
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:40,320
I like free, yeah.

1608
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:41,320
It's awesome.

1609
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:44,320
Do you think there will be a lot of free games on Xbox One?

1610
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:47,320
I think there's got to be some.

1611
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:49,320
That's the world we live in now.

1612
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:53,320
I'm just wondering if there's going to be any MMOs on Xbox One,

1613
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:58,320
because remember, there wasn't really much on, you know, the Xbox 360,

1614
01:23:58,320 --> 01:23:59,320
aside from Final Fantasy.

1615
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:04,320
And I guess, you know, there's some pay-to-play MMOs, you know, like the Defiance and stuff,

1616
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:09,320
but none like actual traditional MMOs beyond Final Fantasy XI.

1617
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:10,320
Don't know.

1618
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:11,320
So, it'll be interesting.

1619
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:16,320
And last but not least, new Harmonix title was announced last week,

1620
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:20,320
and that was Fantasia Music Evolved.

1621
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:25,320
And I saw the trailer, and I'm like, that has very little to do with Fantasia.

1622
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:26,320
Here's the thing.

1623
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:29,320
I love Harmonix. I love Disney.

1624
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:30,320
Do we get Elephants and Tutus?

1625
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:35,320
Maybe, actually. I love Harmonix. I love Disney. I hate Bruno Mars.

1626
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:37,320
Why was that in the trailer?

1627
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:38,320
But, but, but.

1628
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:39,320
Why?

1629
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:41,320
But, they're going to have pop music.

1630
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:42,320
They're also going to have-

1631
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:43,320
That's not Fantasia.

1632
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:47,320
But they're also going to have the classical music as well.

1633
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:50,320
And Bohemian Rhapsody is going to be in it.

1634
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:52,320
Anything with Queen is instantly better, yeah.

1635
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:55,320
Queen is one of the artists, you know, confirmed.

1636
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:58,320
Instant fantasticness. Just add Freddie Mercury.

1637
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:01,320
Here's the tracks announced so far.

1638
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:03,320
Does it make him a Disney Queen?

1639
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:08,320
So, Bohemian Rhapsody, Kimbra Settle Down.

1640
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:09,320
I don't know what that is.

1641
01:25:09,320 --> 01:25:10,320
Have you-

1642
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:11,320
Fun Some Nights.

1643
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:14,320
Hold on. Just in case Dark Soccer hadn't seen this yet,

1644
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:17,320
I'm playing this in studio, the little teaser trailer for this.

1645
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:18,320
Let me skip ahead a little bit.

1646
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:24,320
So, basically, it's Sorcerer Mickey mode.

1647
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:26,320
Yeah, it's like your, like, Sorcerer Mickey,

1648
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:29,320
but it doesn't really, like, tell you what the game is.

1649
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:30,320
Like, where's the game here?

1650
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:33,320
I'm left to think it's Rhythm Party.

1651
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:36,320
It, yeah. It looks like Rhythm Party.

1652
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:39,320
Which I said Rhythm Party should have just been a retail release

1653
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:41,320
with all the tracks, but whatever.

1654
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:45,320
You know what? I don't care, because I don't really like connect games.

1655
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:48,320
The thing that's kind of unique, I guess, about it, supposedly,

1656
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:51,320
is you can control, like, the tempo of the song,

1657
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:54,320
and, like, it changes depending on, like, stuff you do, I guess.

1658
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:56,320
So that's gonna be kind of neat.

1659
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:59,320
One of the tracks in there, was it AVI-

1660
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:00,320
What was it?

1661
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:01,320
Black Wolf in chat says,

1662
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:03,320
Game trailers actually showed gameplay.

1663
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:04,320
It's Elite Beat agents connect.

1664
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:06,320
Oh, so it's Rhythm Party.

1665
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:07,320
Like I said.

1666
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:10,320
And you see this face that no one in the chat room can see?

1667
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:12,320
This is my no one curface.

1668
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:16,320
I'm willing to give it a shot just because I really love harmonics,

1669
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:18,320
and they always put out quality.

1670
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:20,320
I love harmonics, but I hate connect games.

1671
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:23,320
Fair.

1672
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:27,320
And Levels is also one of the songs in there,

1673
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:30,320
which, if I remember correctly, I think that's-

1674
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:31,320
Let's see here.

1675
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:36,320
If I wanted to get up and dance, I'd take a Zumba class.

1676
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:38,320
Oh, yeah. Actually, I do like Levels.

1677
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:43,320
Levels is awesome because that was one of the songs that was in Forza Horizon,

1678
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:46,320
one of my favorite ones on the dubstep thing.

1679
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:48,320
So I'm digging it.

1680
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,320
You know, I think it'd be kind of cool.

1681
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:51,320
Harmonics, can't go wrong with them, so.

1682
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:53,320
Bobby gave me a link to this, and I hadn't seen it.

1683
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:56,320
So, where's the actual gameplay?

1684
01:26:57,320 --> 01:26:59,320
I just hear a dude talking.

1685
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:00,320
Let's see gameplay.

1686
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:04,320
Is that Under the Sea?

1687
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:07,320
Down where it's wetter.

1688
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:08,320
Under the sea.

1689
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:10,320
Oh, see, there it is.

1690
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:12,320
I guess.

1691
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:16,320
Okay, so this is not Rhythm Party.

1692
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:20,320
Huh.

1693
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:26,320
Alright.

1694
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:27,320
It's like-

1695
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:28,320
Curious.

1696
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:29,320
Put out a demo.

1697
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:30,320
It seems like a game that-

1698
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:32,320
I want a new Para Para Paradise, then I would play my Kinect.

1699
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:33,320
You know what?

1700
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:35,320
You know what they really needed to have?

1701
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:38,320
Is they need to have Q games and fucking Harmonics come together

1702
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:41,320
and do a new Child of Eden type of game,

1703
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:43,320
because Child of Eden was fucking awesome.

1704
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:44,320
It was pretty good.

1705
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:46,320
ClericalEra404 in our chat quickly wants to know,

1706
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:48,320
DarkSakura, why do you hate Kinect games?

1707
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:50,320
Because usually they show you what you're doing

1708
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:52,320
and I don't like to watch myself.

1709
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:57,320
Uh, you can sometimes turn camera off.

1710
01:27:57,320 --> 01:27:59,320
Yeah, if I can turn the camera off, I have no problem with it.

1711
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:02,320
Oh, I would have just thought you just don't like the whole flailing around.

1712
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:03,320
That's just-

1713
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:06,320
Well, I don't mind flailing around as long as nobody else is over.

1714
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:07,320
I mean-

1715
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:10,320
I was gonna say, to be fair, the original Kinect game's

1716
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:12,320
not exactly very accurate a lot of times.

1717
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:14,320
Yeah, that was that too.

1718
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:16,320
I mean, the only fun I've ever had playing a Kinect game

1719
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:19,320
was doing Para Para on Dance Masters,

1720
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:23,320
which is why that's still the only Kinect game I will play.

1721
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:25,320
Alright, let me move on with some other news.

1722
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:28,320
Maybe DarkSakura instead would rather play Injustice.

1723
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:31,320
I know she loves DC Universe, but-

1724
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:33,320
Do I like DC Universe?

1725
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:36,320
No, but apparently Injustice is pretty good.

1726
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:39,320
Somebody said Injustice is the best thing going on in DC Universe right now.

1727
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:41,320
It was a freaking stupid looking game.

1728
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:44,320
Well, there's Mortal Kombat crossover coming to Injustice,

1729
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:46,320
which I'm sure will surprise nobody.

1730
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:50,320
Scorpion will be the next playable character in Injustice Gods Among Us DLC,

1731
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:54,320
400 Microsoft points or $5, but none for Wii U buy.

1732
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:55,320
Why?

1733
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:56,320
Why not?

1734
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:59,320
Why not? Because they have a whole bunch of other DC superheroes

1735
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:01,320
that they could put in the game.

1736
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:02,320
Scorpion's a superhero.

1737
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:04,320
No, he's not. Now he's like fucking-

1738
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:05,320
I'm just trolling.

1739
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:08,320
It's like, oh hey, it's Scorpion, but I can't do any of my bloody moves

1740
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:10,320
because it's fucking teen rated.

1741
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:15,320
That's what happened with the whole Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe.

1742
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:19,320
Oh, sorry, I can't behead Batman because it's fucking teen rated.

1743
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:22,320
I don't know, whatever. It sounds lame.

1744
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:25,320
I honestly did not find the game fun. The end.

1745
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:28,320
Also, information on the new Voice of Snake,

1746
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:32,320
because a certain co-host of mine didn't ruin this earlier in the show,

1747
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:36,320
but Kiefer Sutherland confirmed as the voice of Snake in Metal Gear Solid 5,

1748
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:38,320
not David Hayter.

1749
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:43,320
Now, I think this was just like buzz earlier.

1750
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:46,320
We didn't have confirmation, but now that it's in the trailer,

1751
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:47,320
because the Konami whole thing,

1752
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:48,320
which we haven't even brought up in the show yet,

1753
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:51,320
but Konami had their whole little movie thing come up,

1754
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:52,320
and this was part of it.

1755
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:53,320
Yeah.

1756
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:56,320
So, that's that.

1757
01:29:56,320 --> 01:30:00,320
So, that to me sounds like the whole situation where, you know,

1758
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:03,320
it's the How I Met Your Mother situation where you have,

1759
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:05,320
you know, Bob Saget as the narrator.

1760
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:06,320
He's supposed to be the father.

1761
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:09,320
But yeah, his voice isn't obviously going to change, you know,

1762
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:12,320
over the default Ted Mosley voice that, you know, the characters.

1763
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:14,320
So, it's just different.

1764
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:15,320
All right.

1765
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:17,320
And I wonder if we'll ever get a movie,

1766
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:21,320
if we'll have, you know, Kiefer Sutherland playing Snake.

1767
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:25,320
EA, hopefully giving some final clarity to some of the shady things

1768
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:27,320
they've said about the Wii U in the past,

1769
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:30,320
courtesy of EA president Frank Gebaux.

1770
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:31,320
Now, I'm going to admit,

1771
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:33,320
I think we brought up something similar to this last week,

1772
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:35,320
but this is coming from EA president of labels.

1773
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:36,320
This is somebody else.

1774
01:30:36,320 --> 01:30:39,320
Quote, we have a good partnership with Nintendo.

1775
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:41,320
We released four games on the platform over the last year.

1776
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:44,320
We're pretty proud of Need for Speed and Madden and FIFA and Mass Effect.

1777
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:48,320
We have guys that are looking at the Wii U and the studio system right now

1778
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:49,320
as an opportunity to the future,

1779
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:53,320
but we have no publicly announced Wii U games that we're going to release this fall.

1780
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:57,320
That does leave the door open to say something at E3, but don't hold your breath.

1781
01:30:57,320 --> 01:30:58,320
No, they have nothing coming.

1782
01:30:58,320 --> 01:30:59,320
Don't hold your breath.

1783
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:00,320
There's nothing.

1784
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:02,320
We're really excited about the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4,

1785
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:04,320
and that's a pretty big endeavor in and of itself.

1786
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:05,320
I wonder why.

1787
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:08,320
We have four titles out on the Wii U that are active right now,

1788
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:11,320
so looking at how things unfold, that's where our focus is right now.

1789
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:13,320
Gen 3 is an awesome platform.

1790
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:16,320
It has a huge audience, it has a lot of capability,

1791
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:18,320
and we're going to continue to publish games on Gen 3

1792
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:20,320
for as long as there is an audience there.

1793
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:24,320
We have a tendency as a company to support the last gen platforms for many, many years.

1794
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:27,320
I can tell you we have products planned for next year, the year after that,

1795
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:29,320
and the year after that for Gen 3 for sure.

1796
01:31:29,320 --> 01:31:33,320
Well, yeah, because they keep pumping out Madden sequels and stuff like that

1797
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:39,320
on PlayStation 2 and Xbox up to way past the console's life cycles and stuff,

1798
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:43,320
but it doesn't necessarily mean you're going to see big games on there.

1799
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:48,320
The honest, blunt way I could say this is that third-party games

1800
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:51,320
aren't really what a lot of people go to Nintendo for anyway.

1801
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:53,320
I mean, they'll help, of course.

1802
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:57,320
I mean, certainly the Sega partnership with Sonic, which is so weird.

1803
01:31:57,320 --> 01:32:00,320
It's not weird.

1804
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:04,320
No, I mean, to the nine-year-old gamer in me when it was Nintendo versus Sega,

1805
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:06,320
that is still something I have to be used to.

1806
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:08,320
They've done this the last few years with Sonic Colors.

1807
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:11,320
They've had a bunch of exclusive Sonic games on the Wii,

1808
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:13,320
and they haven't been that great.

1809
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:15,320
It's not that weird, but anyway.

1810
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:18,320
But it'll have Mario Kart, it'll have Zelda,

1811
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:21,320
and there's going to be a lot of people here for that.

1812
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:23,320
So, Dark Soccer.

1813
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:27,320
I'm sorry, I was just getting out my DC hate out of my system.

1814
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:30,320
Can't we all just get along?

1815
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:32,320
No, Marvel all the way.

1816
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:36,320
Hey, listen, if it's any consolation, Deadpool comes out in a couple weeks anyway.

1817
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:38,320
I know! I'm so happy.

1818
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:40,320
So happy.

1819
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:42,320
So happy. Anyway.

1820
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:45,320
Well, how about some other really quick news, okay?

1821
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:47,320
Diablo 3.

1822
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:55,320
We've seen an announcement before that it's going to be on the PS3 and PS4.

1823
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:57,320
They are also bringing it out on Xbox 360,

1824
01:32:57,320 --> 01:33:00,320
but have no plans to bring it out for any other system.

1825
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:03,320
Which is a polite fuck you to Xbone.

1826
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:06,320
As I'm still going to call it forever.

1827
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:11,320
Honestly, a lot of us have been playing it on PC already, so who cares?

1828
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:14,320
And then, this makes me really happy.

1829
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:20,320
Is that Hatsune Miku Project Diva F is going to be coming out in North America in August,

1830
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:23,320
and I'm gonna get it.

1831
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:27,320
There's a demo on June 11th.

1832
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:33,320
And I'm so excited because I love the Project Diva games.

1833
01:33:33,320 --> 01:33:37,320
And then, last but not least, Metal Gear Rising Revengeance.

1834
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:41,320
If anyone likes stories about Raiden, well, you get to play more Raiden

1835
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:43,320
because it's going to be on PC.

1836
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:44,320
The end.

1837
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:48,320
They're also bringing, I think, the original Lords of Shadows to PC as well,

1838
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:51,320
so that would be interesting.

1839
01:33:51,320 --> 01:33:54,320
Alright, let's go to the FUGL Question of the Week.

1840
01:33:54,320 --> 01:34:01,320
Every week, we ask a question of our Facebook and Google communities.

1841
01:34:01,320 --> 01:34:04,320
You put it together and it's FUGL.

1842
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:09,320
We had a fun idea for this week because, you know, E3 really kicks off tomorrow.

1843
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:13,320
The show floor doesn't open until Tuesday, but there's a shit ton of press conferences tomorrow.

1844
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:16,320
And so, everybody's going to be talking about this tomorrow.

1845
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:18,320
So, we thought we would go to Facebook and Google and ask,

1846
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:22,320
it's that time of year to ask everyone, what's your E3 predictions?

1847
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:26,320
However, we at OLR, we like to do things a little differently and maybe a little bit silly.

1848
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:30,320
So, we only want your E3 predictions in a haiku format.

1849
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:34,320
That would be five, seven, five, remember?

1850
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:38,320
Guess, OLR me, what will occur at E3?

1851
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:40,320
Games of win or fail?

1852
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:43,320
That was my haiku to the listeners.

1853
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:46,320
Loki, you look so impressed.

1854
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:49,320
All right, here we go. Some haikus.

1855
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:53,320
The Dark Sakura, I want you to count the syllables and tell me who failed.

1856
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:54,320
For the record, Rob?

1857
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:55,320
There are some fails in here.

1858
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:56,320
For the record, Rob?

1859
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:59,320
The plural of haiku is haiku.

1860
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:01,320
Haikuzis.

1861
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:04,320
The haikuza.

1862
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:06,320
Let's go to the haikuza.

1863
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:08,320
Haikuzersies.

1864
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:11,320
You know what? Bite me.

1865
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:14,320
Haikugaggle. All right.

1866
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:17,320
And all in good fun about those of you that failed, by the way.

1867
01:35:17,320 --> 01:35:24,320
Edgar R. says, Call of Duty Ghost, Dogs of War, X-Bone exclusive.

1868
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:27,320
I think Dogs of War, that's wrong.

1869
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:30,320
That's not a haiku, you lose.

1870
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:31,320
You lose.

1871
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:35,320
It's also already confirmed as an exclusive to the Xbox One.

1872
01:35:35,320 --> 01:35:37,320
All right. I appreciate the effort.

1873
01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:39,320
Porkchop, since this entry.

1874
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:45,320
I don't really mind as long as they don't release more shit EA games.

1875
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:47,320
Bravo.

1876
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:49,320
Tiara.

1877
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:54,320
All I really care is about, excuse me, I fucked that up, sorry.

1878
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:57,320
All I really care about is Dragon Age 3.

1879
01:35:57,320 --> 01:35:59,320
I love BioWare.

1880
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:02,320
No, she loves Anders.

1881
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:05,320
She loves her pounce a lot.

1882
01:36:05,320 --> 01:36:07,320
So she gets a fail for lying.

1883
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:08,320
No.

1884
01:36:09,320 --> 01:36:10,320
All right.

1885
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:13,320
Honestly, that's about...

1886
01:36:13,320 --> 01:36:15,320
She named her cats her pounce a lot.

1887
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:17,320
All right. This is from Mason D.

1888
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:19,320
Want more Pokemon?

1889
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:21,320
Pokemon versus for Wii U.

1890
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:23,320
Pokemon get hype.

1891
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:27,320
With a big white smiley face underneath that, no less.

1892
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:30,320
Blood Drunk submits the following.

1893
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:32,320
That's a great name.

1894
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:34,320
Blood Drunk.

1895
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:36,320
I don't know if Blood Drunk is a newer listener,

1896
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:38,320
but I've noticed his name on the VoG leaderboard.

1897
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:40,320
So he is a big participant.

1898
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:43,320
So a win to you no matter how good or bad your haiku is.

1899
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:45,320
Here we go. From Blood Drunk.

1900
01:36:45,320 --> 01:36:48,320
Connect watches you fap.

1901
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:50,320
I think that's six syllables.

1902
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:52,320
Connect watches you fap.

1903
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:54,320
Six syllables. That's all right. We still like his name.

1904
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:56,320
Connect watches you fap.

1905
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:58,320
LOL PS4 DRM.

1906
01:36:58,320 --> 01:37:00,320
Nintendo shows games.

1907
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:02,320
All right.

1908
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:04,320
Not quite a haiku, but hey.

1909
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:06,320
Close enough.

1910
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:08,320
It's a haiku-ga.

1911
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:10,320
It's a haiku-ger.

1912
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:12,320
Degenerate Johnny submits the following.

1913
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:14,320
Predicting prices.

1914
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:16,320
Xbox. Five bills.

1915
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:18,320
Four with subs.

1916
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:20,320
Sony 450.

1917
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:22,320
Good way to put your predictions in.

1918
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:24,320
I think he might be high balling it a little bit,

1919
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:26,320
but we'll see.

1920
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:28,320
Haseo Sumeruagawa submits the following.

1921
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:30,320
Xbox One fucks up.

1922
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:32,320
Nintendo might steal the show.

1923
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:34,320
PS4 ooh pretty.

1924
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:38,320
That was six syllables.

1925
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:40,320
That's all right.

1926
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:42,320
Liam C submits the following.

1927
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:44,320
The Last Guardian.

1928
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:46,320
A brand new Uncharted game.

1929
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:48,320
Connect flops badly.

1930
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:50,320
Good.

1931
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:52,320
Code Man says,

1932
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:54,320
What will E3 bring?

1933
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:56,320
Nintendo surprise maybe?

1934
01:37:56,320 --> 01:37:58,320
Will has sports.

1935
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:00,320
One just got sent to me, which I have to read.

1936
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:02,320
Okay. From who?

1937
01:38:02,320 --> 01:38:04,320
From clerical error 404.

1938
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:06,320
Sony has less trust.

1939
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:08,320
Nintendo rules us all.

1940
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:10,320
But it all ends well.

1941
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:12,320
We'll see.

1942
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:14,320
We'll see. All right.

1943
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:16,320
E to the three.

1944
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:18,320
That's four syllables.

1945
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:20,320
You lose.

1946
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:22,320
No, why can't people count?

1947
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:24,320
E to the three.

1948
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:26,320
Oh, they didn't.

1949
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:28,320
Oh, they done screwed up.

1950
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:30,320
He could do E fucking 3-0.

1951
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:32,320
All right.

1952
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:34,320
Captain Spike.

1953
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:36,320
Here's Captain Spike's submission.

1954
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:38,320
Yay, Spike. We love Spike.

1955
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:40,320
He's full of win no matter if his haiku is fail or not.

1956
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:42,320
Here it is.

1957
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:44,320
Nintendo no show.

1958
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:46,320
Sony and MS hate us all.

1959
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:48,320
The worst E3 ever.

1960
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:50,320
Worst E3 ever.

1961
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:52,320
I love Spike.

1962
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:54,320
Here's Hitstun.

1963
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:56,320
Next gen consoles?

1964
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:58,320
Meh. Nothing PS3

1965
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:00,320
can't do.

1966
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:02,320
Game of Show? DuckTales.

1967
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:04,320
Ooh.

1968
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:06,320
That's a good one. That's my favorite one so far, I think.

1969
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:08,320
Did you watch the last trailer

1970
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:10,320
they put out?

1971
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:12,320
It's the side-by-side.

1972
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:14,320
Oh, no, I didn't see that one.

1973
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:16,320
They did one comparing the old DuckTales to the new one.

1974
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:18,320
Somebody on Tumblr posted it

1975
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:20,320
a while back. I'll see if I can't find it

1976
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:22,320
but it was pretty neat.

1977
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:24,320
Alright, here's SSJ100 Matt Sentry.

1978
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:26,320
Anticipation.

1979
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:28,320
Elated disappointment.

1980
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:30,320
Gamers are winners.

1981
01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:32,320
Wouldn't that be losers

1982
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:34,320
if we're disappointed, though?

1983
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:36,320
And I got excited because when he said anticipation

1984
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:38,320
it made me think, oh, maybe that's the Rare franchise

1985
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:40,320
they're bringing back. Because y'all know

1986
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:42,320
I could give two fucks about Killer Instinct

1987
01:39:42,320 --> 01:39:44,320
or Banjo-Kazooie

1988
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:46,320
when Rare could remake Anticipation.

1989
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:48,320
Just saying.

1990
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:50,320
You know you want to play as the ice cream cone again

1991
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:52,320
bouncing around the board.

1992
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:54,320
I want ice cream right now.

1993
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:56,320
This is from Steven M.

1994
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:58,320
What about another cameo?

1995
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:00,320
Hell no. Alright, Steven M says

1996
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:02,320
like, I had to think about what the fuck game

1997
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:04,320
is he talking about? Oh, god.

1998
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:06,320
Alright, Steven M.

1999
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:08,320
Must be online Xbox.

2000
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:10,320
Wii U will die.

2001
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:12,320
We finally get Last Guardian.

2002
01:40:12,320 --> 01:40:14,320
I think you did 557.

2003
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:16,320
Andy R.

2004
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:18,320
Especially since you

2005
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:20,320
gave them how to do a haiku.

2006
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:22,320
I put right there, as a

2007
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:24,320
reminder, a haiku is 575.

2008
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:26,320
We can't read.

2009
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:28,320
What's the syllable?

2010
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:30,320
We love our listeners.

2011
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:32,320
We're just giving you shit.

2012
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:34,320
I give everybody shit.

2013
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:36,320
We just want to educate you all this week on haikuses.

2014
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:38,320
Yeah, study some damn literature.

2015
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:40,320
Fuck.

2016
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:42,320
Was that a haiku?

2017
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:44,320
No, not quite.

2018
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:46,320
Alright, Andy R.

2019
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:48,320
I'll make one though if you like.

2020
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:50,320
You think of one while I read the rest of these.

2021
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:52,320
Alright, Andy R says

2022
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:54,320
I don't really know.

2023
01:40:54,320 --> 01:40:56,320
A giant enemy crab?

2024
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:58,320
Ridge Racer 2.

2025
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:00,320
Ridge Racer 2 is

2026
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:02,320
four syllables.

2027
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:04,320
Andy, you're killing me.

2028
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:06,320
That would have been great for 2006.

2029
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:08,320
Alright, lots of answers

2030
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:10,320
on Google Plus. We have five

2031
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:12,320
answers on Google Plus. I didn't even know there were

2032
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:14,320
that many people using it.

2033
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:16,320
Oh, come on, come on.

2034
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:18,320
ActDeaf says what I want this year

2035
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:20,320
is to see really good games

2036
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:22,320
and vog to hit big.

2037
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:24,320
Somebody kissing a little

2038
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:26,320
vog behind in that response.

2039
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:28,320
Love it. Thank you, ActDeaf.

2040
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:30,320
Flaco Jones says

2041
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:32,320
Xbox and Sony, their DRM

2042
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:34,320
kills gaming. What's a Nintendo?

2043
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:36,320
Okay, I got one.

2044
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:38,320
Let me make sure I have it right.

2045
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:40,320
We'll do yours last.

2046
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:42,320
Forget it.

2047
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:44,320
Go. Use the internet.

2048
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:46,320
There are haiku examples.

2049
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:50,320
There are haiku examples.

2050
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:52,320
Okay.

2051
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:54,320
Really use Google.

2052
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:56,320
Okay.

2053
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:58,320
Fuck. Alright, Technus

2054
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:00,320
says

2055
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:02,320
use some fucking Google.

2056
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:04,320
Alright.

2057
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:06,320
Technus says people still complain.

2058
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:08,320
Rare shows next gen battle

2059
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:10,320
toads. Why you still hating?

2060
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:12,320
You never

2061
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:14,320
know. Retertainment

2062
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:16,320
says, oh, it's a double haiku.

2063
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:18,320
Ooh. Retertainment's always

2064
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:20,320
got to fucking show everybody up. Alright.

2065
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:22,320
Here we go. That's okay. I love it. Alright. Retertainment

2066
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:24,320
says gamers hate everything.

2067
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:26,320
Everything will receive

2068
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:28,320
scorn. Twitter will explode.

2069
01:42:28,320 --> 01:42:30,320
Good one. Gamers will

2070
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:32,320
not see a wanted not

2071
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:34,320
seen project. The Last Guardian.

2072
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:36,320
We got it.

2073
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:38,320
Since he did two, we got another one from

2074
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:40,320
clerical error. Alright. Let me read this last one

2075
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:42,320
from Google Plus. From Travis H.

2076
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:44,320
Sony is epic. Xbone

2077
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:46,320
will be eaten up. Long live

2078
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:48,320
PlayStation.

2079
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:50,320
We'll see how that press conference goes.

2080
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:52,320
I'm approaching it with cautious optimism

2081
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:54,320
Travis. Cautious optimism.

2082
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:56,320
Alright. Last but not least.

2083
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:58,320
Nintendo has props, but Sony has

2084
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:00,320
some issues. I guess we should wait.

2085
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:02,320
That one was good.

2086
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:04,320
YYR in chat.

2087
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:06,320
Can't you people

2088
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:08,320
count? You have offended Jamie.

2089
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:10,320
Study some damn books.

2090
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:12,320
You win the internet

2091
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:14,320
YYR. Xbox One console.

2092
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:16,320
TV, TV, TV, sports.

2093
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:18,320
What's wrong? Deal with it.

2094
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:20,320
That's good.

2095
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:22,320
Did you do that one by yourself? I just did that one. I love it.

2096
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:24,320
I love it.

2097
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:26,320
After I posted the question. Use that Mensa thing for something.

2098
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:28,320
There you go.

2099
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:30,320
Jamie came to me tonight.

2100
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:32,320
She said you should make every week be

2101
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:34,320
a haiku.

2102
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:36,320
Alright.

2103
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:38,320
Alright. And SSJ100

2104
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:40,320
Matt bringing some clarity.

2105
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:42,320
Anticipation because gamers are anticipating

2106
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:44,320
a lot for E3. Elated disappointment

2107
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:46,320
because people will be either happy or disappointed.

2108
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:48,320
Gamers are winners because no matter what

2109
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:50,320
gamers win because we have all these

2110
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:52,320
new games to play.

2111
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:54,320
Okay. Okay. Alright.

2112
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:56,320
Anyhow, I know we gave some of you a bad time, but

2113
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:58,320
that was a really fun topic. So thank you everybody for

2114
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:00,320
trying. I love you YYR.

2115
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:02,320
Alright.

2116
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:04,320
Do I need to give you two a moment?

2117
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:06,320
No. I don't love you in that way.

2118
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:08,320
Alright.

2119
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:10,320
Just a few more stories and then list list tonight.

2120
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:12,320
But first, Loki.

2121
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:14,320
Alright. Code Manner's reminding me that

2122
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:16,320
I need to play more Borderlands 2.

2123
01:44:16,320 --> 01:44:18,320
Because I haven't touched it on PC yet.

2124
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:20,320
Even though I finished the game

2125
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:22,320
three times on 360.

2126
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:24,320
So yes, unfortunately

2127
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:26,320
there was some massive lay-offs

2128
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:28,320
at Zynga. Also

2129
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:30,320
including the closure

2130
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:32,320
of OMG Pop.

2131
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:34,320
And

2132
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:36,320
so they closed the office there.

2133
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:38,320
Also they closed

2134
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:40,320
the Zynga office

2135
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:42,320
in Los Angeles,

2136
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:44,320
Dallas, and New York.

2137
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:48,320
And I know there was lay-offs I think

2138
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:50,320
in all of their offices. I think about

2139
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:52,320
five hundred and

2140
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:54,320
like

2141
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:56,320
five twenty or five forty

2142
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:58,320
or something like that.

2143
01:44:58,320 --> 01:45:00,320
People were laid off.

2144
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:02,320
Actually I was reaching out to one of my friends

2145
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:04,320
who is a concept artist

2146
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:06,320
over at Zynga

2147
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:08,320
in San Francisco. I think she's pretty high up

2148
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:10,320
though.

2149
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:12,320
I don't think she's affected by it.

2150
01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:14,320
Yeah, that kind of sucks.

2151
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:16,320
And of course a lot of

2152
01:45:16,320 --> 01:45:18,320
horror stories coming out about

2153
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:20,320
how things were run and stuff like that.

2154
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:22,320
And how they were talking about

2155
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:24,320
the terms they use

2156
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:26,320
for cloning things. Like

2157
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:28,320
taking games like Tiny Tower

2158
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:30,320
and turning them into Dream Heights or whatever.

2159
01:45:32,320 --> 01:45:34,320
I don't know. It's kind of sick to me.

2160
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:38,320
So maybe this is the beginning

2161
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:40,320
of the end. This is surely

2162
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:42,320
not too good for them.

2163
01:45:44,320 --> 01:45:46,320
Well, I mean I don't

2164
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:48,320
like to poke fun or tease

2165
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:50,320
or you know

2166
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:52,320
celebrate layoffs. Especially

2167
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:54,320
like Loki says. He has

2168
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:56,320
friends that are at Zynga and so forth.

2169
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:58,320
We always knew Zynga had a really

2170
01:45:58,320 --> 01:46:00,320
questionable business model. And I think

2171
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:02,320
people bought into

2172
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:04,320
that way too fast. And Zynga

2173
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:06,320
expanded way too fast over

2174
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:08,320
Farmville. And I think it just goes to show

2175
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:10,320
Farmville was kind of a one hit wonder.

2176
01:46:10,320 --> 01:46:12,320
I hate to say.

2177
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:14,320
Some would argue with me that there were other Facebook

2178
01:46:14,320 --> 01:46:16,320
games and blah, blah, blah.

2179
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:18,320
Well, it's like this. When the news came out about them

2180
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:20,320
copying games. I mean that was just

2181
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:22,320
shitty. Aha had good albums

2182
01:46:22,320 --> 01:46:24,320
and good music. But the only

2183
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:26,320
song anyone ever cared about

2184
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:28,320
was Take On Me. That is

2185
01:46:28,320 --> 01:46:30,320
quite possibly the best possible comparison

2186
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:32,320
somebody could have made in this scenario. Because

2187
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:34,320
remember I had that thing of Dan

2188
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:36,320
singing the lyrics to the

2189
01:46:36,320 --> 01:46:38,320
synth part with one hit wonder

2190
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:40,320
instead of the...

2191
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:42,320
By the way before I get to the next news story

2192
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:44,320
I just got a text message. And I'll let you

2193
01:46:44,320 --> 01:46:46,320
guess where this is from Dark Soccer. Are you ready?

2194
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:48,320
Alright here's the text message

2195
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:50,320
I just got. Haiku game

2196
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:52,320
is weak. Sometimes we

2197
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:54,320
just can't even. DarkSakura

2198
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:56,320
mad. Girl.

2199
01:46:56,320 --> 01:46:58,320
It's from Allen. I know.

2200
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:00,320
I thought that was

2201
01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:02,320
good. Alright. Let's see

2202
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:04,320
going into some

2203
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:06,320
news about the Ouya.

2204
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:08,320
And some more games coming to the Ouya.

2205
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:10,320
Specifically Sonic the Hedgehog 4 and

2206
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:12,320
Sonic CD. I'm not surprised.

2207
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:14,320
They're going to be coming to the Ouya.

2208
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:16,320
You can side load those right now and

2209
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:18,320
they work just fine.

2210
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:20,320
So why not try to make some money off of it right?

2211
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:22,320
Exactly. I got a Moga

2212
01:47:22,320 --> 01:47:24,320
version. I got my controller free of Sonic CD

2213
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:26,320
that plays just fine. Well I mean still

2214
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:28,320
though it's Sega support for the Ouya so that's

2215
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:30,320
kind of cool. How about some Phantasy Star online?

2216
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:32,320
Alright. Maybe that's wishful thinking.

2217
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:34,320
They're coming out on June 27th in the

2218
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:36,320
Ouya store. $7 each. This is Sonic

2219
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:38,320
the Hedgehog 4 episode 1

2220
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:40,320
episode 2 and Sonic CD.

2221
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:42,320
No idea if the Ouya version will

2222
01:47:42,320 --> 01:47:44,320
include fun for Sonic the Hedgehog 4.

2223
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:46,320
Because unfortunately that was missing in the

2224
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:48,320
earlier versions. Anybody?

2225
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:50,320
Alright.

2226
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:52,320
The Ouya ports they say are optimized

2227
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:54,320
for the console's Tegra 3

2228
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:56,320
processor and free trial

2229
01:47:56,320 --> 01:47:58,320
versions will be available.

2230
01:47:58,320 --> 01:48:00,320
Sega of America director of mobile business

2231
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:02,320
David Zemke, interesting where this is coming

2232
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:04,320
from, was praising Ouya's

2233
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:06,320
quote disruptive technology and

2234
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:08,320
quote they want to see what these technologies

2235
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:10,320
can do and be a part of it from the beginning.

2236
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:12,320
We're always looking for

2237
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:14,320
other titles and there may be some future titles

2238
01:48:14,320 --> 01:48:16,320
that we'd like to bring over. For us

2239
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:18,320
we're always trying to bring the best

2240
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:20,320
gaming experience to the right platforms.

2241
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:22,320
It's a delicate mix of how

2242
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:24,320
and when to do it.

2243
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:26,320
Hmm. That's right after the launch

2244
01:48:26,320 --> 01:48:28,320
of the Ouya by the way which is June 25th.

2245
01:48:28,320 --> 01:48:30,320
The day before my birthday y'all.

2246
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:32,320
Just saying. Alright.

2247
01:48:32,320 --> 01:48:34,320
Anyhow.

2248
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:36,320
Dark

2249
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:38,320
Sakura, one more story and then we'll get into list list tonight.

2250
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:40,320
Sorry we were just having a discussion about

2251
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:42,320
Turian Smut.

2252
01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:44,320
Of course. No not really.

2253
01:48:44,320 --> 01:48:46,320
Something from

2254
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:48,320
Double Fine, the game Massive

2255
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:50,320
Chalice that

2256
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:52,320
basically as they were

2257
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:54,320
saying that there was going to be

2258
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:56,320
a gay relationship in the game that

2259
01:48:56,320 --> 01:48:58,320
had been taken out and

2260
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:00,320
now the project leader feels shitty because

2261
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:02,320
people on Kickstarter say no we want it.

2262
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:04,320
So he's putting it in.

2263
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:06,320
I guess it had been the intention

2264
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:08,320
but it just sort of was taken out.

2265
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:10,320
And so now they are putting everything

2266
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:12,320
back in and making sure that

2267
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:14,320
the people paying for it get what they want.

2268
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:16,320
So it's already passed

2269
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:18,320
it's $725,000

2270
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:20,320
goal. It's at

2271
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:22,320
$857,569

2272
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:24,320
and it has 20 days to go until

2273
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:26,320
the deadline.

2274
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:28,320
Nope. Less than that now.

2275
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:30,320
18 days? Yeah.

2276
01:49:30,320 --> 01:49:32,320
Hmm. As of today.

2277
01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:34,320
Interesting.

2278
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:36,320
All that from feedback.

2279
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:38,320
That's what you want. We're putting it back in.

2280
01:49:38,320 --> 01:49:40,320
That's kind of cool though because that makes it seem like

2281
01:49:40,320 --> 01:49:42,320
Kickstarter really is a place for

2282
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:44,320
not to say

2283
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:46,320
they're investors or whatever because

2284
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:48,320
Kickstarter is the backing or whatever but that they get a

2285
01:49:48,320 --> 01:49:50,320
say that these people really had a say.

2286
01:49:50,320 --> 01:49:52,320
Well yeah. I mean if you look

2287
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:54,320
at it this way it is probably the

2288
01:49:54,320 --> 01:49:56,320
best type of board meeting you can ever

2289
01:49:56,320 --> 01:49:58,320
expect because you've got

2290
01:49:58,320 --> 01:50:00,320
real time feedback going in.

2291
01:50:00,320 --> 01:50:02,320
Alright. So I think it's good.

2292
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:04,320
Something that you would consider backing or a game

2293
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:06,320
that you might think you're going to buy or?

2294
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:08,320
I told you what I'm waiting for for my first

2295
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:10,320
my first backing.

2296
01:50:10,320 --> 01:50:12,320
No. What? Well unless he's

2297
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:14,320
already put it up I'm waiting for

2298
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:16,320
the

2299
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:18,320
understanding video games.

2300
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:20,320
I don't remember. Can you refresh

2301
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:22,320
my memory about this? The seg stewing?

2302
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:24,320
Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2303
01:50:24,320 --> 01:50:26,320
There was

2304
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:28,320
another name it was though.

2305
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:30,320
But yeah he hasn't put it up yet.

2306
01:50:30,320 --> 01:50:32,320
I'm going to give my

2307
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:34,320
Kickstarter cherry to seg.

2308
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:36,320
Love, love, love, love.

2309
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:38,320
That's a fair place to

2310
01:50:38,320 --> 01:50:40,320
give your Kickstarter cherry.

2311
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:42,320
Alright.

2312
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:44,320
I'm trying to get this

2313
01:50:44,320 --> 01:50:46,320
well we're going to do Listless now

2314
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:48,320
except I'm having a little problem with the

2315
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:50,320
connection.

2316
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:52,320
Let's see if we can get it there.

2317
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:54,320
We're going to call an old friend of ours here at Orange

2318
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:56,320
Lounge Radio to help us out with Listless tonight

2319
01:50:56,320 --> 01:50:58,320
and hopefully the internet will hold up.

2320
01:50:58,320 --> 01:51:00,320
But I think we're connected now. Are you there

2321
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:02,320
old friend? Hello. Hey

2322
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:04,320
Bobby Blackwolf how you doing?

2323
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:06,320
I'm doing good. Rob called you old.

2324
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:08,320
Shouldn't he be like old chum?

2325
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:10,320
Yes. Oh I'm not Adam

2326
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:12,320
West in Batman okay. How you

2327
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:14,320
doing Bobby? I'm doing good. I've been

2328
01:51:14,320 --> 01:51:16,320
playing Animal Crossing since I got off the

2329
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:18,320
air. Finally have time to get into that huh? What do you think

2330
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:20,320
so far? It's Animal Crossing.

2331
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:22,320
I'm very sad

2332
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:24,320
because everybody else has this and I don't even

2333
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:26,320
have a 3DS so whatever.

2334
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:28,320
No because

2335
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:30,320
I don't have a job so we're not buying

2336
01:51:30,320 --> 01:51:32,320
one. You have to have a J-O-B

2337
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:34,320
to have a 3DS.

2338
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:36,320
You're going to need to get on MTurk.

2339
01:51:36,320 --> 01:51:38,320
I've even already been in someone else's town

2340
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:40,320
so my fruit collection is growing.

2341
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:42,320
Wow. Nice I need to go open my

2342
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:44,320
gates. But anyhow I wanted

2343
01:51:44,320 --> 01:51:46,320
to make sure you had a chance. You know

2344
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:48,320
our Listless topic tonight is about E3

2345
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:50,320
and we're going to get into that in a minute. But I

2346
01:51:50,320 --> 01:51:52,320
wanted a chance for the listeners to hear

2347
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:54,320
from you because you've worked

2348
01:51:54,320 --> 01:51:56,320
you know in case our listeners

2349
01:51:56,320 --> 01:51:58,320
don't know you've worked very hard on the

2350
01:51:58,320 --> 01:52:00,320
voice of geeks network. The whole thing is really

2351
01:52:00,320 --> 01:52:02,320
done from the ground up. I mean

2352
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:04,320
yeah the template was

2353
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:06,320
something we bought but even

2354
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:08,320
Dark Sakura heavily modified that template graphically.

2355
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:10,320
You have done a lot of programming

2356
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:12,320
for the whole VoG game and everything

2357
01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:14,320
that you announced with E3.Vognetwork.com

2358
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:16,320
right? Right

2359
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:18,320
and I mean yeah the website I mean

2360
01:52:18,320 --> 01:52:20,320
PHPBB is the forum software and that

2361
01:52:20,320 --> 01:52:22,320
handles like the user registration

2362
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:24,320
and that's it. Everything else

2363
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:26,320
started with a blank

2364
01:52:26,320 --> 01:52:28,320
file. For any

2365
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:30,320
Unix geeks out there I wrote it all in VI

2366
01:52:30,320 --> 01:52:32,320
so and

2367
01:52:32,320 --> 01:52:34,320
you know if you don't know what VI is that's

2368
01:52:34,320 --> 01:52:36,320
fine but if you do know what VI is

2369
01:52:36,320 --> 01:52:38,320
you kind of know what that means

2370
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:40,320
that's like a more hardcore notepad.

2371
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:42,320
Yeah I could never use VI

2372
01:52:42,320 --> 01:52:44,320
I was always about was it Pico or Pine?

2373
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:46,320
One was the email. I used Pico.

2374
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:48,320
Pine was the mail.

2375
01:52:48,320 --> 01:52:50,320
Yeah one was email and one was

2376
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:52,320
shows you my knowledge of Unix I

2377
01:52:52,320 --> 01:52:54,320
haven't used it in a while but

2378
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:56,320
you coded away in VI this new

2379
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:58,320
E3.Vognetwork.com what

2380
01:52:58,320 --> 01:53:00,320
are you hoping comes of this?

2381
01:53:00,320 --> 01:53:02,320
I don't know

2382
01:53:02,320 --> 01:53:04,320
this is me saying

2383
01:53:04,320 --> 01:53:06,320
this is an idea I have

2384
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:08,320
I wonder if it'll work and in the past

2385
01:53:08,320 --> 01:53:10,320
I've had these ideas and they didn't work and

2386
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:12,320
then two years later everybody's doing them

2387
01:53:12,320 --> 01:53:14,320
so we'll see if this is another one of

2388
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:16,320
those. We'll see so be sure to check

2389
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:18,320
it out guys if you haven't seen it yet

2390
01:53:18,320 --> 01:53:20,320
vognetwork.com especially those

2391
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:22,320
of you listening on the podcast

2392
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:24,320
everything will open up on Monday night for

2393
01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:26,320
the question and answer but tonight live

2394
01:53:26,320 --> 01:53:28,320
you can at least watch the video

2395
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:30,320
and learn everything you're going to need to know

2396
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:32,320
for when everything goes live

2397
01:53:32,320 --> 01:53:34,320
with the question asking.

2398
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:36,320
I've already been given the blacklist

2399
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:38,320
against asking anything about Hello Kitty

2400
01:53:38,320 --> 01:53:40,320
games so I'm not going to do that.

2401
01:53:40,320 --> 01:53:42,320
Fair enough.

2402
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:44,320
Alright so

2403
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:46,320
you're leaving for E3 tomorrow right?

2404
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:48,320
Correct tomorrow morning.

2405
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:50,320
What's your very first appointment?

2406
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:52,320
Um

2407
01:53:52,320 --> 01:53:54,320
Bethesda I think

2408
01:53:54,320 --> 01:53:56,320
Yeah I think it's Bethesda

2409
01:53:56,320 --> 01:53:58,320
it's at 2 o'clock that way I can get there

2410
01:53:58,320 --> 01:54:00,320
and see things from noon to 2

2411
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:02,320
and kind of get my way to land but I think

2412
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:04,320
Bethesda at 2.

2413
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:06,320
I know we're about to get into the list list here about

2414
01:54:06,320 --> 01:54:08,320
thing I most want to happen at E3 2013

2415
01:54:08,320 --> 01:54:10,320
but seriously off the record

2416
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:12,320
what are you personally looking forward

2417
01:54:12,320 --> 01:54:14,320
to getting your hands on yourself and checking out?

2418
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:16,320
Um

2419
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:18,320
this is my standard answer

2420
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:20,320
and everybody calls it a cop out but I don't care.

2421
01:54:20,320 --> 01:54:22,320
Oh no I know what you're going to say and I think it's a great answer.

2422
01:54:22,320 --> 01:54:24,320
It's the game I

2423
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:26,320
haven't heard of yet

2424
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:28,320
and it's always been that like it was

2425
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:30,320
you know Scribblenauts

2426
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:32,320
is usually you know the

2427
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:34,320
thing I go back to. Nobody

2428
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:36,320
had heard of Scribblenauts I never heard of it

2429
01:54:36,320 --> 01:54:38,320
and it was in the back corner of

2430
01:54:38,320 --> 01:54:40,320
one of the halls because Warner Brothers

2431
01:54:40,320 --> 01:54:42,320
had like their booth kind of near a wall

2432
01:54:42,320 --> 01:54:44,320
and they had this on the side

2433
01:54:44,320 --> 01:54:46,320
facing that back wall

2434
01:54:46,320 --> 01:54:48,320
and I went and saw it

2435
01:54:48,320 --> 01:54:50,320
at the very end it was the last thing I

2436
01:54:50,320 --> 01:54:52,320
saw on Thursday because somebody else said

2437
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:54,320
there's a game called Scribblenauts you should go check it out

2438
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:56,320
and it's hidden in the back corner and that was my game of show

2439
01:54:56,320 --> 01:54:58,320
which pissed off

2440
01:54:58,320 --> 01:55:00,320
people because you know I should be giving it to a

2441
01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:02,320
graphically good game and not a DS title

2442
01:55:02,320 --> 01:55:04,320
at the time and so it's

2443
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:06,320
finding those gems

2444
01:55:06,320 --> 01:55:08,320
you know like that's how

2445
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:10,320
I found Katamari Damacy

2446
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:12,320
which is the same kind of thing

2447
01:55:12,320 --> 01:55:14,320
so it's the game I haven't heard of yet

2448
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:16,320
I think that is a fantastic answer

2449
01:55:16,320 --> 01:55:18,320
and I look forward to hearing what that game is

2450
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:20,320
when I come see you in person on Thursday

2451
01:55:20,320 --> 01:55:22,320
at least they'll let me see the Ouya booth

2452
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:24,320
alright yeah you're going to get to do

2453
01:55:24,320 --> 01:55:26,320
the Ouya booth because I don't you know

2454
01:55:26,320 --> 01:55:28,320
I'm probably not going to get to go in there

2455
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:30,320
because I don't want to leave the show floors

2456
01:55:30,320 --> 01:55:32,320
that's fine unless they like keep it open

2457
01:55:32,320 --> 01:55:34,320
later and then I'll pop in

2458
01:55:34,320 --> 01:55:36,320
that's all you dude I'll do the b-roll

2459
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:38,320
alright anyway

2460
01:55:38,320 --> 01:55:40,320
all seriousness though we are going to play

2461
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:42,320
Listless here but there's one other reason

2462
01:55:42,320 --> 01:55:44,320
I have you here tonight and there's been

2463
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:46,320
a theme here at VOG Network the past couple weeks

2464
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:48,320
and that is that the game is always changing

2465
01:55:48,320 --> 01:55:50,320
and the game is changing again

2466
01:55:50,320 --> 01:55:52,320
tonight isn't it Bobby

2467
01:55:52,320 --> 01:55:54,320
that's right what is new what did you do

2468
01:55:54,320 --> 01:55:56,320
for us this week

2469
01:55:56,320 --> 01:55:58,320
I hope you're logged into the site

2470
01:55:58,320 --> 01:56:00,320
everybody because you no longer

2471
01:56:00,320 --> 01:56:02,320
have to learn how to private message

2472
01:56:02,320 --> 01:56:04,320
Rob to play Listless

2473
01:56:04,320 --> 01:56:06,320
if you've ever done any of the live

2474
01:56:06,320 --> 01:56:08,320
polls here on VOG

2475
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:10,320
then you kind of

2476
01:56:10,320 --> 01:56:12,320
know where to look

2477
01:56:12,320 --> 01:56:14,320
that's where you're going to want to look

2478
01:56:14,320 --> 01:56:16,320
so with that it's time to start

2479
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:18,320
some Listless

2480
01:56:20,320 --> 01:56:22,320
as a reminder for everybody

2481
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:24,320
the way Listless works is that

2482
01:56:24,320 --> 01:56:26,320
we are going to give

2483
01:56:26,320 --> 01:56:28,320
three answers each host

2484
01:56:28,320 --> 01:56:30,320
and our special guest Bobby Blackwolf three answers

2485
01:56:30,320 --> 01:56:32,320
that we believe best meet the

2486
01:56:32,320 --> 01:56:34,320
criteria of the list and tonight's

2487
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:36,320
topic thing I most want to happen

2488
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:38,320
at E3 2013

2489
01:56:38,320 --> 01:56:40,320
and once everything is up on the list

2490
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:42,320
then we will go around and this is what has

2491
01:56:42,320 --> 01:56:44,320
to happen we have to strike the items that are

2492
01:56:44,320 --> 01:56:46,320
not worthy of the list it's a very

2493
01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:48,320
difficult painful process

2494
01:56:48,320 --> 01:56:50,320
but it must be done remember there is

2495
01:56:50,320 --> 01:56:52,320
a new rule that is still in play however

2496
01:56:52,320 --> 01:56:54,320
and that is that when a host has two

2497
01:56:54,320 --> 01:56:56,320
items eliminated from the list the third

2498
01:56:56,320 --> 01:56:58,320
gets immunity so a person's list

2499
01:56:58,320 --> 01:57:00,320
cannot be completely decimated

2500
01:57:00,320 --> 01:57:02,320
alright here it is the topic thing

2501
01:57:02,320 --> 01:57:04,320
I most want to happen at

2502
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:06,320

2503
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:08,320

2510
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:22,320

2511
01:57:22,320 --> 01:57:24,320

2512
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:26,320
I'm keeping a watch on it oh there it is

2513
01:57:26,320 --> 01:57:28,320
it just popped up I see it on my screen

2514
01:57:28,320 --> 01:57:30,320

2515
01:57:30,320 --> 01:57:32,320

2517
01:57:34,320 --> 01:57:36,320
why don't you start us off tonight what is the number three thing

2518
01:57:36,320 --> 01:57:38,320
you most want to see happen

2519
01:57:38,320 --> 01:57:40,320
at E3 2013

2520
01:57:40,320 --> 01:57:42,320
so I'm going to go kind of with an easy

2521
01:57:42,320 --> 01:57:44,320
answer at first because I'm still having trouble

2522
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:46,320
figuring out number one and number two so chat help me out

2523
01:57:46,320 --> 01:57:48,320
oh yeah if you

2524
01:57:48,320 --> 01:57:50,320
have an answer you want to submit for inclusion on the list

2525
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:52,320
shout them out live.vognetwork.com

2526
01:57:52,320 --> 01:57:54,320
but I'm

2527
01:57:54,320 --> 01:57:56,320
going to say the easy answer

2528
01:57:56,320 --> 01:57:58,320
a new F-Zero

2529
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:00,320
you know

2530
01:58:00,320 --> 01:58:02,320
I think that's a very

2531
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:04,320
good safe answer

2532
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:06,320
and I think that is one that can't possibly

2533
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:08,320
get eliminated no matter what happens

2534
01:58:08,320 --> 01:58:10,320
of course that's always famous last words

2535
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:12,320
yeah thanks for doing that answer

2536
01:58:12,320 --> 01:58:14,320
alright let's put it up on the board

2537
01:58:14,320 --> 01:58:16,320
Bobby locks in a new F-Zero

2538
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:18,320
alright Dark Sakura

2539
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:20,320
what is the number three thing that you want to see happen

2540
01:58:20,320 --> 01:58:22,320
at E3 2013

2541
01:58:22,320 --> 01:58:24,320
like it's probably it won't happen

2542
01:58:24,320 --> 01:58:26,320
but I would love to have Sega announce

2543
01:58:26,320 --> 01:58:28,320
that they're back in the console business

2544
01:58:28,320 --> 01:58:30,320
it won't happen

2545
01:58:30,320 --> 01:58:32,320
but it's what I want

2546
01:58:32,320 --> 01:58:34,320
right Sega

2547
01:58:34,320 --> 01:58:36,320
is back in the console business

2548
01:58:36,320 --> 01:58:38,320
let's put it up on the board Dreamcast 2

2549
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:42,320
they should call it the

2550
01:58:42,320 --> 01:58:44,320
Sega Utopia

2551
01:58:44,320 --> 01:58:46,320
the Sega Utopia okay

2552
01:58:46,320 --> 01:58:48,320
my turn for a number three answer

2553
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:50,320
I'm going to say

2554
01:58:50,320 --> 01:58:52,320
I'm going to have

2555
01:58:52,320 --> 01:58:54,320
to figure out how to fit this in the board but

2556
01:58:54,320 --> 01:58:56,320
my number three answer is

2557
01:58:56,320 --> 01:58:58,320
the Microsoft server crashes

2558
01:58:58,320 --> 01:59:00,320
at the show causing all the

2559
01:59:00,320 --> 01:59:02,320
Xbox ones to stop playing games

2560
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:04,320
after Wednesday

2561
01:59:04,320 --> 01:59:06,320
because you know every 24 hours

2562
01:59:06,320 --> 01:59:08,320
it's got to check in right

2563
01:59:08,320 --> 01:59:10,320
so the Microsoft

2564
01:59:10,320 --> 01:59:12,320
server crashes for 24 hours

2565
01:59:12,320 --> 01:59:14,320
I guess that's how I'll shorten it

2566
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:22,320
alright putting that up on the board right now

2567
01:59:22,320 --> 01:59:24,320
boy Bobby would be very sad

2568
01:59:24,320 --> 01:59:26,320
Bobby wouldn't you be sad if like

2569
01:59:26,320 --> 01:59:28,320
you didn't get to play an Xbox one and then

2570
01:59:28,320 --> 01:59:30,320
all of a sudden the servers crash for 24 hours

2571
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:36,320
but then I'd laugh

2572
01:59:36,320 --> 01:59:38,320
alright Loki

2573
01:59:38,320 --> 01:59:40,320
your number three answer

2574
01:59:40,320 --> 01:59:42,320
just because I want to get this out of the way

2575
01:59:42,320 --> 01:59:44,320
Microsoft

2576
01:59:44,320 --> 01:59:46,320
and Sony go back on their plans

2577
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:48,320
for DRM it's days

2578
01:59:48,320 --> 01:59:50,320
the way it is now

2579
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:52,320
I love how you threw in

2580
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:54,320
and Sony when we don't really know you

2581
01:59:54,320 --> 01:59:56,320
oh we know

2582
01:59:56,320 --> 01:59:58,320
let's be honest

2583
01:59:58,320 --> 02:00:00,320
no one's keying themselves

2584
02:00:00,320 --> 02:00:02,320
alright fair enough let's put that up on the board

2585
02:00:02,320 --> 02:00:04,320
Loki says MS and Sony go back

2586
02:00:04,320 --> 02:00:06,320
on their DRM plans

2587
02:00:06,320 --> 02:00:08,320
alright Bobby we're to you for your number two

2588
02:00:08,320 --> 02:00:10,320

2589
02:00:10,320 --> 02:00:12,320
thing you most want to see happen at E3 2013

2590
02:00:12,320 --> 02:00:14,320
I want to see E3

2591
02:00:14,320 --> 02:00:16,320
announce that Kensha Hall

2592
02:00:16,320 --> 02:00:18,320
will be returning next year

2593
02:00:18,320 --> 02:00:20,320
dammit you stole mine

2594
02:00:20,320 --> 02:00:22,320

2595
02:00:22,320 --> 02:00:24,320
you had that on your list uh oh

2596
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:26,320
these things happen you better check the chat room

2597
02:00:26,320 --> 02:00:28,320
Bobby just threw that up on the board E3 announces the return

2598
02:00:28,320 --> 02:00:30,320
of Kensha Hall

2599
02:00:30,320 --> 02:00:32,320
and maybe a new ex tango

2600
02:00:32,320 --> 02:00:34,320
that goes with that I don't know

2601
02:00:34,320 --> 02:00:36,320
we'll see alright Dark Sakura

2602
02:00:36,320 --> 02:00:38,320
what's your number two answer

2603
02:00:38,320 --> 02:00:40,320
Sony uses Final Fantasy

2604
02:00:40,320 --> 02:00:42,320
7 to display an engine without

2605
02:00:42,320 --> 02:00:44,320
a release of Final Fantasy 7 remake

2606
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:46,320
so

2607
02:00:46,320 --> 02:00:48,320
so basically they're gonna repeat what they did with

2608
02:00:48,320 --> 02:00:50,320
uh uh PlayStation 3

2609
02:00:50,320 --> 02:00:52,320
and show a Final Fantasy tech demo that never happens

2610
02:00:52,320 --> 02:00:54,320
Final Fantasy tech demo that never results in a game

2611
02:00:54,320 --> 02:00:56,320
that'd be awesome

2612
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:58,320
if it was a new Final Fantasy engine

2613
02:00:58,320 --> 02:01:00,320
hey

2614
02:01:00,320 --> 02:01:02,320
yeah it looks like Advent Children

2615
02:01:02,320 --> 02:01:04,320
nope never gonna get it alright I'm gonna put this

2616
02:01:04,320 --> 02:01:06,320
up on the board Final Fantasy 7 PS4

2617
02:01:06,320 --> 02:01:08,320
tech demo that never is a real game

2618
02:01:08,320 --> 02:01:10,320
yes I think that should fit within the

2619
02:01:10,320 --> 02:01:12,320
confines of our shiny new board

2620
02:01:12,320 --> 02:01:14,320

the site as well live.vognetwork.com

2624
02:01:20,320 --> 02:01:22,320
I mean granted if Final Fantasy 7

2625
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:24,320
was remade yeah I'd play it

2626
02:01:24,320 --> 02:01:26,320
but let's be realistic

2627
02:01:26,320 --> 02:01:28,320

02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:30,320

porn to Miiverse

2633

02:02:14,320 --> 02:02:16,320
games I liked the most on the Wii

2649
02:02:16,320 --> 02:02:18,320

2675
02:03:18,320 --> 02:03:20,320
it will alright Half Life I didn't hit save

2676
02:03:20,320 --> 02:03:22,320
so Half Life 3 released followed by

2677
02:03:22,320 --> 02:03:24,320
mic drop I think that's a great answer is Alan

2678
02:03:24,320 --> 02:03:26,320
still listening he'll love that answer alright

2679
02:03:26,320 --> 02:03:28,320
Bobby locks that in on the board

2680
02:03:28,320 --> 02:03:30,320
I think that's a great answer Dark Sakura

2681
02:03:30,320 --> 02:03:32,320
what's your number one answer

2682
02:03:32,320 --> 02:03:34,320
well

2683
02:03:34,320 --> 02:03:36,320
everyone saw this coming the new

2684
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:38,320
Mass Effect announced

2685
02:03:38,320 --> 02:03:40,320
with good writing

2686
02:03:44,320 --> 02:03:46,320
new Mass Effect announced

2687
02:03:46,320 --> 02:03:48,320
but with good writing

2688
02:03:48,320 --> 02:03:50,320
there it is it's up on the board and I totally know

2689
02:03:50,320 --> 02:03:52,320
what chance are Bobby's going to strike

2690
02:03:52,320 --> 02:03:54,320
you know what if Bobby touches it

2691
02:03:54,320 --> 02:03:56,320
I will get nevermind

2692
02:03:56,320 --> 02:03:58,320
I won't even say it

2693
02:03:58,320 --> 02:04:00,320
you leave my Mass Effect alone

2694
02:04:00,320 --> 02:04:02,320
my it's a scientific

2695
02:04:02,320 --> 02:04:04,320
process Dark Sakura alright my number

2696
02:04:04,320 --> 02:04:06,320
one answer at least take faith in

2697
02:04:06,320 --> 02:04:08,320
this Dark Sakura I think you will be okay with this

2698
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:10,320
as a backup I know you will because

2699
02:04:10,320 --> 02:04:12,320
my answer is Bobby doesn't get rid of it too

2700
02:04:12,320 --> 02:04:14,320
he might my answer is

2701
02:04:14,320 --> 02:04:16,320
the Guardian Legend 2

2702
02:04:16,320 --> 02:04:18,320
on Wii U

2703
02:04:20,320 --> 02:04:22,320
technically there was a Guardian Legend 2

2704
02:04:22,320 --> 02:04:24,320
it's the one that we got in the US

2705
02:04:24,320 --> 02:04:26,320
shut up that was Guardic 2 you shut up

2706
02:04:26,320 --> 02:04:28,320
okay fine

2707
02:04:28,320 --> 02:04:30,320
preferably WayForward would somehow

2708
02:04:30,320 --> 02:04:32,320
be involved because they're really good at retro

2709
02:04:32,320 --> 02:04:34,320
said Garris gets his own game

2710
02:04:34,320 --> 02:04:36,320
that'd be like that would be like

2711
02:04:36,320 --> 02:04:38,320
a Silent Scope Turian

2712
02:04:38,320 --> 02:04:40,320
edition

2713
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:42,320
alright last but not least

2714
02:04:42,320 --> 02:04:44,320
Loki one spot left on the board

2715
02:04:44,320 --> 02:04:46,320
what are you going to put in the list tonight

2716
02:04:48,320 --> 02:04:50,320
Grand Theft Auto or Saints Row

2717
02:04:50,320 --> 02:04:52,320
Online

2718
02:04:52,320 --> 02:04:54,320
an MMO for a

2719
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:56,320
sandbox game yeah I know

2720
02:04:56,320 --> 02:04:58,320
I guess we already have

2721
02:04:58,320 --> 02:05:00,320
what was that

2722
02:05:00,320 --> 02:05:02,320
I think that one game they have a free to play

2723
02:05:02,320 --> 02:05:04,320
MMO right now they're sort of like Sains Row

2724
02:05:04,320 --> 02:05:06,320
ATB or whatever yeah ATB but it's not

2725
02:05:06,320 --> 02:05:08,320
that good it's not that same

2726
02:05:08,320 --> 02:05:10,320
a GTA or Sains Row

2727
02:05:10,320 --> 02:05:12,320
MMO there it is let's

2728
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:14,320
recap before we get to the very difficult

2729
02:05:14,320 --> 02:05:16,320
part a new F-Zero

2730
02:05:16,320 --> 02:05:18,320
Sega is back in the console

2731
02:05:18,320 --> 02:05:20,320
business Microsoft server crashes

2732
02:05:20,320 --> 02:05:22,320
for 24 hours Microsoft and Sony

2733
02:05:22,320 --> 02:05:24,320
go back on their DRM plans

2734
02:05:24,320 --> 02:05:26,320
E3 announces the return of Kensha Hall

2735
02:05:26,320 --> 02:05:28,320
Final Fantasy 7 Playstation 4

2736
02:05:28,320 --> 02:05:30,320
tech demo that it never is a real game

2737
02:05:30,320 --> 02:05:32,320
Porn to Miiverse, Super Mario

2738
02:05:32,320 --> 02:05:34,320
RPG 2, Half Life 3

2739
02:05:34,320 --> 02:05:36,320
released followed by a mic drop

2740
02:05:36,320 --> 02:05:38,320
new Mass Effect announced but with good writing

2741
02:05:38,320 --> 02:05:40,320
The Guardian Legend 2 on

2742
02:05:40,320 --> 02:05:42,320
Wii U and Grand Theft Auto

2743
02:05:42,320 --> 02:05:44,320
or Saints Row MMO

2744
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:46,320
that's a lot of answers

2745
02:05:46,320 --> 02:05:48,320
tonight so unfortunately it's

2746
02:05:48,320 --> 02:05:50,320
getting crowded up here so unfortunately it's

2747
02:05:50,320 --> 02:05:52,320
time to ask which of these is not

2748
02:05:52,320 --> 02:05:54,320
worthy of the list

2749
02:05:54,320 --> 02:05:56,320
Bobby Black Wolf I know you don't want to do it

2750
02:05:56,320 --> 02:05:58,320
but you're going to have to make one of us mad by eliminating

2751
02:05:58,320 --> 02:06:00,320
something off the list what's it going to be

2752
02:06:00,320 --> 02:06:02,320
Porn to Miiverse

2753
02:06:02,320 --> 02:06:04,320
Bobby you're

2754
02:06:04,320 --> 02:06:06,320
killing me why are you getting rid of porn

2755
02:06:06,320 --> 02:06:08,320
though

2756
02:06:08,320 --> 02:06:10,320
because

2757
02:06:10,320 --> 02:06:12,320
because the Wii U is

2758
02:06:12,320 --> 02:06:14,320
a wholesome system

2759
02:06:14,320 --> 02:06:16,320
think of the children

2760
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:18,320
it has been stricken from the list

2761
02:06:18,320 --> 02:06:20,320
Porn to Miiverse is gone

2762
02:06:20,320 --> 02:06:22,320
alright who's

2763
02:06:22,320 --> 02:06:24,320
next Dark Sakura

2764
02:06:24,320 --> 02:06:26,320
there's the various answers which

2765
02:06:26,320 --> 02:06:28,320
one of these is not worthy of

2766
02:06:28,320 --> 02:06:30,320
the list

2767
02:06:30,320 --> 02:06:32,320
tough one

2768
02:06:32,320 --> 02:06:34,320
there's a lot of good answers up here

2769
02:06:34,320 --> 02:06:36,320
yeah there are

2770
02:06:36,320 --> 02:06:38,320
I'm

2771
02:06:38,320 --> 02:06:40,320
probably going to have to axe

2772
02:06:40,320 --> 02:06:42,320
the

2773
02:06:42,320 --> 02:06:44,320
Microsoft and Sony going back because

2774
02:06:44,320 --> 02:06:46,320
I don't think Microsoft is

2775
02:06:46,320 --> 02:06:48,320
going to

2776
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:50,320
eliminating it because you're just like it's not happening

2777
02:06:50,320 --> 02:06:52,320
and we still don't know

2778
02:06:52,320 --> 02:06:54,320
what Sony's going to say you might want it

2779
02:06:54,320 --> 02:06:56,320
it's all speculation but you just alright

2780
02:06:56,320 --> 02:06:58,320
it has been stricken from the list

2781
02:06:58,320 --> 02:07:00,320
as sad as that is going to make some of you but I

2782
02:07:00,320 --> 02:07:02,320
understand alright my turn to strike

2783
02:07:02,320 --> 02:07:04,320
something from the list oh gosh

2784
02:07:04,320 --> 02:07:06,320
these are all actually really good

2785
02:07:08,320 --> 02:07:10,320
I don't know

2786
02:07:12,320 --> 02:07:14,320
I hate to do this

2787
02:07:14,320 --> 02:07:16,320
Loki but I'm removing Super Mario

2788
02:07:16,320 --> 02:07:18,320
RPG 2 before you get mad

2789
02:07:18,320 --> 02:07:20,320
at me people it's

2790
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:22,320
the same reason Dark Sakura got rid of hers

2791
02:07:22,320 --> 02:07:24,320
it's not fucking happening so

2792
02:07:24,320 --> 02:07:26,320
let's not even get our hopes up

2793
02:07:26,320 --> 02:07:28,320
so Super Mario

2794
02:07:28,320 --> 02:07:30,320
RPG 2 I'm sorry but it has been removed

2795
02:07:30,320 --> 02:07:32,320
from the list but the good news is

2796
02:07:32,320 --> 02:07:34,320
GTA or Saints Row MMO gets immunity

2797
02:07:34,320 --> 02:07:36,320
going into the final removal which is yours

2798
02:07:36,320 --> 02:07:38,320
Loki well that's fantastic news

2799
02:07:38,320 --> 02:07:40,320
and since it's not really going to happen either

2800
02:07:40,320 --> 02:07:42,320
new Mass Effect announcement

2801
02:07:42,320 --> 02:07:44,320
because there's just not good writing in that series

2802
02:07:44,320 --> 02:07:46,320
hey if they got the first

2803
02:07:46,320 --> 02:07:48,320
game writing team it would be good

2804
02:07:48,320 --> 02:07:50,320
oh I'm sorry to say that it

2805
02:07:50,320 --> 02:07:52,320
has been stricken from the list

2806
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:54,320
sorry Dark Sakura

2807
02:07:54,320 --> 02:07:56,320
I guess while we're talking about things that

2808
02:07:56,320 --> 02:07:58,320
will never happen

2809
02:07:58,320 --> 02:08:00,320
alright there it is

2810
02:08:00,320 --> 02:08:02,320

2857
02:09:36,320 --> 02:09:38,320
end this poll when it's done do we just uncheck

02:09:38,320 --> 02:09:40,320
answerable and that uncheck live

2859
02:09:40,320 --> 02:09:42,320
uncheck live and that gets rid of it okay

2860
02:09:42,320 --> 02:09:44,320
yeah I actually see a bug on this

2861
02:09:44,320 --> 02:09:46,320

2862
02:09:46,320 --> 02:09:48,320
oh yeah you know it's the score yeah

2863
02:09:48,320 --> 02:09:50,320
what's happening is the scoring wrong

2864
02:09:50,320 --> 02:09:52,320
well you notice how like

2865
02:09:52,320 --> 02:09:54,320
it's

2866
02:09:54,320 --> 02:09:56,320
that's weird what is weird I know why

2867
02:09:56,320 --> 02:09:58,320
it's doing it what's wrong

2868
02:09:58,320 --> 02:10:00,320
oh it's not sorting it that's not a big deal

2869
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:02,320
well it is sorting it but not

2870
02:10:02,320 --> 02:10:04,320
sorting it by the first number and not

2871
02:10:04,320 --> 02:10:06,320
the entire number

2872
02:10:06,320 --> 02:10:08,320
oh I get it it's sorting it

2873
02:10:08,320 --> 02:10:10,320
as a string instead of an integer

2874
02:10:10,320 --> 02:10:12,320
that's coding terms

2875
02:10:12,320 --> 02:10:14,320

find some emails that she thinks are

2913
02:11:28,320 --> 02:11:30,320
worthy of reading on the show tonight

2914
02:11:30,320 --> 02:11:32,320
first email

2915
02:11:32,320 --> 02:11:34,320
it's also subject line is

2916
02:11:34,320 --> 02:11:36,320
now they've done it

2917
02:11:36,320 --> 02:11:38,320
I looked up hubris the other day to make sure it meant

2918
02:11:38,320 --> 02:11:40,320
what I thought it did Microsoft definitely

2919
02:11:40,320 --> 02:11:42,320
has an overabundance of hubris

2920
02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:44,320
they revealed Xbox

2921
02:11:44,320 --> 02:11:46,320
one and the consumers on the internet

2922
02:11:46,320 --> 02:11:48,320
made assumptions then Microsoft denied

2923
02:11:48,320 --> 02:11:50,320
the rumors but last Thursday confirmed all

2924
02:11:50,320 --> 02:11:52,320
the rumors to be true and the

2925
02:11:52,320 --> 02:11:54,320
consumers are not happy see major Nelson's

2926
02:11:54,320 --> 02:11:56,320
blog comments to see the shit storm

2927
02:11:56,320 --> 02:11:58,320
the xbox one seems to be defying

2928
02:11:58,320 --> 02:12:00,320
the consumers

2929
02:12:00,320 --> 02:12:02,320
I'm sorry the consumers who use the internet

2930
02:12:02,320 --> 02:12:04,320
oh wait those are the target demographic

2931
02:12:04,320 --> 02:12:06,320
it's really stupid business wise

2932
02:12:06,320 --> 02:12:08,320
to ignore your customer base and punish them

2933
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:10,320
in the process I hope they change

2934
02:12:10,320 --> 02:12:12,320
and that comes from Rababa

2935
02:12:12,320 --> 02:12:14,320
agreed

2936
02:12:14,320 --> 02:12:16,320
I'm gonna apologize can you summarize that for me cause Alan

2937
02:12:16,320 --> 02:12:18,320
just got home and I was talking to him

2938
02:12:18,320 --> 02:12:20,320
um basically Microsoft denying the rumors then

2939
02:12:20,320 --> 02:12:22,320
confirming the rumors and a big shit storm

2940
02:12:22,320 --> 02:12:24,320
yeah what's up with that they totally did

2941
02:12:24,320 --> 02:12:26,320
say no it's but then they were also

2942
02:12:26,320 --> 02:12:28,320
saying like at one point what like

2943
02:12:28,320 --> 02:12:30,320
it was gonna be $60 for the license

2944
02:12:30,320 --> 02:12:32,320
or something I don't

2945
02:12:32,320 --> 02:12:34,320
sometimes the left hand isn't talking to the right hand is it

2946
02:12:34,320 --> 02:12:36,320
well and I'll repeat this line

2947
02:12:36,320 --> 02:12:38,320
it's really stupid business wise to ignore your

2948
02:12:38,320 --> 02:12:40,320
customer base and punish them in the process

2949
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:42,320
so that was from Rababa

2950
02:12:42,320 --> 02:12:44,320
well thank you Rababa

2951
02:12:44,320 --> 02:12:46,320
very very good points and the last

2952
02:12:46,320 --> 02:12:48,320
demo cause we only had two

2953
02:12:48,320 --> 02:12:50,320
unless you want me to read all of the Russian porn

2954
02:12:50,320 --> 02:12:52,320
and the French porn and god are we

2955
02:12:52,320 --> 02:12:54,320
still getting those no well you

2956
02:12:54,320 --> 02:12:56,320
took care of all of those but well apparently we're not

2957
02:12:56,320 --> 02:12:58,320
getting me verse porn thanks to Bobby

2958
02:12:58,320 --> 02:13:00,320
really of course you get Russian porn

2959
02:13:00,320 --> 02:13:02,320
I get all sorts of like

2960
02:13:02,320 --> 02:13:04,320
porn emails I'm like I don't know why

2961
02:13:04,320 --> 02:13:06,320
I don't sign up for porn

2962
02:13:06,320 --> 02:13:08,320
no one signs up for porn

2963
02:13:08,320 --> 02:13:10,320
porn happens

2964
02:13:10,320 --> 02:13:12,320
okay this is another one

2965
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:14,320
from Rababa

2966
02:13:14,320 --> 02:13:16,320
you should probably avoid my other emails for reading

2967
02:13:16,320 --> 02:13:18,320
too late this is about

2968
02:13:18,320 --> 02:13:20,320
the Xbox how it games letter I

2969
02:13:20,320 --> 02:13:22,320
slash we got via email

2970
02:13:22,320 --> 02:13:24,320
here is one quote feature

2971
02:13:24,320 --> 02:13:26,320
your games keep playing even

2972
02:13:26,320 --> 02:13:28,320
when you're not just because you're not playing

2973
02:13:28,320 --> 02:13:30,320
doesn't mean your games have to stop

2974
02:13:30,320 --> 02:13:32,320
with living games technology and the power of the

2975
02:13:32,320 --> 02:13:34,320
cloud game worlds are persistent

2976
02:13:34,320 --> 02:13:36,320
so the things you do in a game will

2977
02:13:36,320 --> 02:13:38,320
stay that way wait the living

2978
02:13:38,320 --> 02:13:40,320
games continue to play without you like an MMO

2979
02:13:40,320 --> 02:13:42,320
which is the opposite of things

2980
02:13:42,320 --> 02:13:44,320
you do in the game will stay that way

2981
02:13:44,320 --> 02:13:46,320
we call that technology save files

2982
02:13:46,320 --> 02:13:48,320

3005
02:14:44,320 --> 02:14:46,320
FU to just realizing

3006
02:14:46,320 --> 02:14:48,320
that you're gonna give me a bunch of

3007
02:14:48,320 --> 02:14:50,320
chocolate not that like

3008
02:14:50,320 --> 02:14:52,320

3010
02:14:58,320 --> 02:15:00,320
alright Loki

3011
02:15:00,320 --> 02:15:02,320
FU to my laptop for the hard drive

3012
02:15:02,320 --> 02:15:04,320
failing and then having

3013
02:15:04,320 --> 02:15:06,320
these things that they put in place

3014
02:15:06,320 --> 02:15:08,320
like recovery partition just not doing

3015
02:15:08,320 --> 02:15:10,320
anything it got so bad that like

3016
02:15:10,320 --> 02:15:12,320
Windows could read the hard drive cause I was able to

3017
02:15:12,320 --> 02:15:14,320
boot in the Windows and stuff but then it's like

3018
02:15:14,320 --> 02:15:16,320
oh you wanna fix that drive well I can't read that

3019
02:15:16,320 --> 02:15:18,320
drive to fix it

3020
02:15:18,320 --> 02:15:20,320
so that kinda sucked but at least I got

3021
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:22,320
a new hard drive in there that I had to take

3022
02:15:22,320 --> 02:15:24,320
out onto my JTAG which I'm not using

3023
02:15:24,320 --> 02:15:26,320
my Xbox of fame

3024
02:15:26,320 --> 02:15:28,320
unfortunately

3025
02:15:28,320 --> 02:15:30,320
and then also

3026
02:15:30,320 --> 02:15:32,320
FU to Steam

3027
02:15:32,320 --> 02:15:34,320
actually just for this weekend because

3028
02:15:34,320 --> 02:15:36,320
I was trying to

3029
02:15:36,320 --> 02:15:38,320
I installed Steam on my new

3030
02:15:38,320 --> 02:15:40,320
installation of Windows and it asked me

3031
02:15:40,320 --> 02:15:42,320
hey I haven't played on this PC before

3032
02:15:42,320 --> 02:15:44,320
you need to authenticate with us

3033
02:15:44,320 --> 02:15:46,320
and then they went and sent me the email

3034
02:15:46,320 --> 02:15:48,320

a winner is me

3140
02:19:18,320 --> 02:19:20,320
I think he hacked the system couldn't he have done that

3141
02:19:20,320 --> 02:19:22,320
couldn't he have hacked the system to give himself more points

3142
02:19:22,320 --> 02:19:24,320
he may have the game has been hacked

3143
02:19:24,320 --> 02:19:26,320
alright just a couple more news stories

3144
02:19:26,320 --> 02:19:28,320
for you guys and then we're going to get to the Twitter

3145
02:19:28,320 --> 02:19:30,320
topics and our Skype line at

3146
02:19:30,320 --> 02:19:32,320
1877 Game OLR or our username

3147
02:19:32,320 --> 02:19:34,320
on Skype OrangeLoungeRadio but first

3148
02:19:34,320 --> 02:19:36,320
Loki

3149
02:19:36,320 --> 02:19:38,320
Minecraft is getting some updates on the

3150
02:19:38,320 --> 02:19:40,320
portable version or the Pocket

3151
02:19:40,320 --> 02:19:42,320
Edition including

3152
02:19:42,320 --> 02:19:44,320
Alpha Realms support and if you remember

3153
02:19:44,320 --> 02:19:46,320
correctly Minecraft Realms is that new

3154
02:19:46,320 --> 02:19:48,320
Mojang

3155
02:19:48,320 --> 02:19:50,320
run private servers basically

3156
02:19:50,320 --> 02:19:52,320
and it will support

3157
02:19:52,320 --> 02:19:54,320
online play for up to 10 players

3158
02:19:54,320 --> 02:19:56,320
simultaneously within a single

3159
02:19:56,320 --> 02:19:58,320
world and allow you to collaborate on

3160
02:19:58,320 --> 02:20:00,320
projects and stuff like that and the

3161
02:20:00,320 --> 02:20:02,320
alpha version is free

3162
02:20:02,320 --> 02:20:04,320
and I guess it will be an optional paid

3163
02:20:04,320 --> 02:20:06,320
service later on also they've

3164
02:20:06,320 --> 02:20:08,320
added eggs, milk, cake

3165
02:20:08,320 --> 02:20:10,320
and fire to the game

3166
02:20:10,320 --> 02:20:12,320
you know so that you can

3167
02:20:12,320 --> 02:20:14,320
you can make cake

3168
02:20:14,320 --> 02:20:16,320
so

3169
02:20:16,320 --> 02:20:18,320
glad to see that the

3170
02:20:18,320 --> 02:20:20,320
Android version is getting some updates

3171
02:20:20,320 --> 02:20:22,320
I wish that I know one of the things that they're working

3172
02:20:22,320 --> 02:20:24,320
on and I don't think it's happened yet is controller

3173
02:20:24,320 --> 02:20:26,320
support for that because if that's the case then I

3174
02:20:26,320 --> 02:20:28,320
can sideload that onto my Ouya and play with the

3175
02:20:28,320 --> 02:20:30,320
controller and it would be fantastic

3176
02:20:30,320 --> 02:20:32,320
and oh god

3177
02:20:32,320 --> 02:20:34,320
dammit I knew there were some I forgot nephews of the week

3178
02:20:34,320 --> 02:20:36,320
but I'll mention it real quickly since they're talking about Minecraft

3179
02:20:36,320 --> 02:20:38,320
what the hell the fucking vog network

3180
02:20:38,320 --> 02:20:40,320
Minecraft server host

3181
02:20:40,320 --> 02:20:42,320
is absolute shit

3182
02:20:42,320 --> 02:20:44,320
and it's been down for five days now

3183
02:20:44,320 --> 02:20:46,320
and I've sent you a bunch

3184
02:20:46,320 --> 02:20:48,320
of support tickets to them

3185
02:20:48,320 --> 02:20:50,320
no fucking response back

3186
02:20:50,320 --> 02:20:52,320
but they sure as hell took out the money

3187
02:20:52,320 --> 02:20:54,320
out of my account this weekend

3188
02:20:54,320 --> 02:20:56,320
to pay for it so I'm looking

3189
02:20:56,320 --> 02:20:58,320
there's three magic words

3190
02:20:58,320 --> 02:21:00,320
that will get action

3191
02:21:00,320 --> 02:21:02,320
Better Business Bureau

3192
02:21:02,320 --> 02:21:04,320
so I'm gonna be

3193
02:21:04,320 --> 02:21:06,320
I'm gonna either switch the server to a new

3194
02:21:06,320 --> 02:21:08,320
host or I'm just gonna shut it down

3195
02:21:08,320 --> 02:21:10,320
because no one's really playing on it

3196
02:21:10,320 --> 02:21:12,320
you know I tried to log into it this week

3197
02:21:12,320 --> 02:21:14,320
I played last week

3198
02:21:14,320 --> 02:21:16,320
but it's just not a lot of people on there

3199
02:21:16,320 --> 02:21:18,320
so it's you know even though it's ten bucks a month

3200
02:21:18,320 --> 02:21:20,320
it's just you know

3201
02:21:20,320 --> 02:21:22,320
I'll give you five dollars

3202
02:21:22,320 --> 02:21:24,320
no one plays, it goes down

3203
02:21:24,320 --> 02:21:26,320
alright

3204
02:21:26,320 --> 02:21:28,320
one more news story for you guys

3205
02:21:28,320 --> 02:21:30,320
and I think this is appropriate

3206
02:21:30,320 --> 02:21:32,320
as a final news story tonight

3207
02:21:32,320 --> 02:21:34,320

3208
02:21:34,320 --> 02:21:36,320
what?

3209
02:21:36,320 --> 02:21:38,320
this is a game that was announced by The Game Atlier

3210
02:21:38,320 --> 02:21:40,320

and it's coming to the Playstation Vita

3216
02:21:50,320 --> 02:21:52,320
on June 11th

3217
02:21:52,320 --> 02:21:54,320
well that doesn't mean no good

3218
02:21:54,320 --> 02:21:56,320
well and they have announced

3219
02:21:56,320 --> 02:21:58,320
they have announced that this game is inspired by

3220
02:21:58,320 --> 02:22:00,320
and this is why Dark Soccer is excited

3221
02:22:00,320 --> 02:22:02,320
it's inspired by Konami's Parodius series

3222
02:22:02,320 --> 02:22:04,320
here's some gameplay

3223
02:22:04,320 --> 02:22:06,320
a little Flying Hamster

3224
02:22:06,320 --> 02:22:08,320
oh that's awesome

3225
02:22:08,320 --> 02:22:10,320
and if you want to play it though

3226
02:22:10,320 --> 02:22:12,320
oh nice

3227
02:22:14,320 --> 02:22:16,320
I like the little Egyptian penguin

3228
02:22:16,320 --> 02:22:18,320
super cute

3229
02:22:18,320 --> 02:22:20,320
I wanna fight the hell

3230
02:22:20,320 --> 02:22:22,320
so this is super cute

3231
02:22:22,320 --> 02:22:24,320
it is cute

3232
02:22:24,320 --> 02:22:26,320
and you gotta love somebody who says they're inspired by Parodius right?

3233
02:22:26,320 --> 02:22:28,320
Parodius is like one of the best games ever

3234
02:22:28,320 --> 02:22:30,320
online leaderboards

3235
02:22:30,320 --> 02:22:32,320
unlockable trophies

3236
02:22:32,320 --> 02:22:34,320
and all that fun stuff

3237
02:22:34,320 --> 02:22:36,320
on the Playstation Network

3238
02:22:36,320 --> 02:22:38,320
the game is also on the Playstation mini service

3239
02:22:38,320 --> 02:22:40,320
the original

3240
02:22:40,320 --> 02:22:42,320
Flying Hamster is on the minis

3241
02:22:42,320 --> 02:22:44,320
so that's pretty cool

3242
02:22:44,320 --> 02:22:46,320
it has fat mermaids

3243
02:22:46,320 --> 02:22:48,320
that's also a great little indie

3244
02:22:48,320 --> 02:22:50,320
you might not have noticed that otherwise title

3245
02:22:50,320 --> 02:22:52,320
so I'm really glad we're getting a little bit of a spotlight on that

3246
02:22:52,320 --> 02:22:54,320
very cool

3247
02:22:54,320 --> 02:22:56,320
so Dark Soccer is thinking about getting a Vita for that

3248
02:22:56,320 --> 02:22:58,320
no I'm not

3249
02:22:58,320 --> 02:23:00,320
it's downloaded on your iPad

3250
02:23:00,320 --> 02:23:02,320
alright, I think it's about time to open up the Skypline

3251
02:23:02,320 --> 02:23:04,320
because I'm sorry, nothing is Pentaro

3252
02:23:04,320 --> 02:23:06,320
let's open up the Skypline

3253
02:23:06,320 --> 02:23:08,320
1-877-GAME-OLR

3254
02:23:08,320 --> 02:23:10,320
or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio

3255
02:23:10,320 --> 02:23:12,320
it is time to get some calls

3256
02:23:12,320 --> 02:23:14,320
here on this Sunday night

3257
02:23:14,320 --> 02:23:16,320
we wanna know, what are your E3 thoughts?

3258
02:23:16,320 --> 02:23:18,320
you don't have to give them in a haiku form

3259
02:23:18,320 --> 02:23:20,320
but bonus points if you do

3260
02:23:20,320 --> 02:23:22,320
maybe you have something to say

3261
02:23:22,320 --> 02:23:24,320
about all this Xbox One business

3262
02:23:24,320 --> 02:23:26,320
I'm sure some of our regular callers have an opinion

3263
02:23:26,320 --> 02:23:28,320
or three, or five, or ten

3264
02:23:28,320 --> 02:23:30,320
on what we talked about at the very beginning of the show

3265
02:23:30,320 --> 02:23:32,320
or maybe there's something else completely different we've missed

3266
02:23:32,320 --> 02:23:34,320
we wanna hear from you guys

3267
02:23:34,320 --> 02:23:36,320
on GameOLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio

3268
02:23:36,320 --> 02:23:38,320
and look at that

3269
02:23:38,320 --> 02:23:40,320
it's already ringing

3270
02:23:40,320 --> 02:23:42,320
already got calls coming in tonight, let's go to it

3271
02:23:42,320 --> 02:23:44,320
hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

3272
02:23:44,320 --> 02:23:46,320
it's a sobered up Rama

3273
02:23:46,320 --> 02:23:48,320
I'm sorry to hear that

3274
02:23:48,320 --> 02:23:50,320
how are you otherwise, Rama?

3275
02:23:50,320 --> 02:23:52,320
I'm doing pretty good, how about y'all out there in California?

3276
02:23:52,320 --> 02:23:54,320
hot!

3277
02:23:54,320 --> 02:23:56,320
actually, today was better

3278
02:23:56,320 --> 02:23:58,320
I had chocolate, and I'm happy

3279
02:23:58,320 --> 02:24:00,320
yeah, I've calmed down a little bit

3280
02:24:00,320 --> 02:24:02,320
yesterday was 110, tomorrow is going to be 80

3281
02:24:02,320 --> 02:24:04,320
go fig

3282
02:24:04,320 --> 02:24:06,320
yep

3283
02:24:06,320 --> 02:24:08,320
well, what's new with you, Rama, why'd you call in tonight?

3284
02:24:08,320 --> 02:24:10,320
a couple of things, but

3285
02:24:10,320 --> 02:24:12,320
before I get into it, um, hey, Ookchan

3286
02:24:12,320 --> 02:24:14,320
huh

3287
02:24:14,320 --> 02:24:16,320
looks like at Otacon this year we may be

3288
02:24:16,320 --> 02:24:18,320
bringing Rama one half back

3289
02:24:18,320 --> 02:24:20,320
yay!

3290
02:24:20,320 --> 02:24:22,320
yes, a few of us are doing a quick impromptu

3291
02:24:22,320 --> 02:24:24,320
group photo

3292
02:24:24,320 --> 02:24:26,320
well, send me a copy of it

3293
02:24:26,320 --> 02:24:28,320
definitely, too bad I can't come with my spatula

3294
02:24:28,320 --> 02:24:30,320
well, and if we have to

3295
02:24:30,320 --> 02:24:32,320
we'll pack you in a box

3296
02:24:32,320 --> 02:24:34,320
I wish I could go, I really do

3297
02:24:34,320 --> 02:24:36,320
but unfortunately, money, blah blah

3298
02:24:36,320 --> 02:24:38,320
okay, okay

3299
02:24:38,320 --> 02:24:40,320
okay, this is the real reason

3300
02:24:40,320 --> 02:24:42,320
why I called

3301
02:24:42,320 --> 02:24:44,320
number one, I understand what everyone

3302
02:24:44,320 --> 02:24:46,320
says about the Xbox One, but

3303
02:24:46,320 --> 02:24:48,320
truth be told, it's still

3304
02:24:48,320 --> 02:24:50,320
going to sell, because they're going to have

3305
02:24:50,320 --> 02:24:52,320
these top tier titles

3306
02:24:52,320 --> 02:24:54,320
and you have to forget

3307
02:24:54,320 --> 02:24:56,320
half the gamers in

3308
02:24:56,320 --> 02:24:58,320
video gaming fandom are lemmings

3309
02:24:58,320 --> 02:25:00,320
they will say one thing

3310
02:25:00,320 --> 02:25:02,320
and then after the presentation you see all these

3311
02:25:02,320 --> 02:25:04,320
games, it'll be like, shut up and take

3312
02:25:04,320 --> 02:25:06,320
my money

3313
02:25:06,320 --> 02:25:08,320
couldn't you say the same thing about Nintendo's

3314
02:25:08,320 --> 02:25:10,320
Wii U, though?

3315
02:25:10,320 --> 02:25:12,320
yes, I can say that about every single gaming console

3316
02:25:12,320 --> 02:25:14,320
but then what happens after

3317
02:25:14,320 --> 02:25:16,320
that? The Nintendo fanboys have bought

3318
02:25:16,320 --> 02:25:18,320
the Wii U and they're still calling it a failure

3319
02:25:18,320 --> 02:25:20,320
you know, I still think the jury's

3320
02:25:20,320 --> 02:25:22,320
out on that to give it another holiday season

3321
02:25:22,320 --> 02:25:24,320
before we, you know,

3322
02:25:24,320 --> 02:25:26,320
build its coffin, but

3323
02:25:26,320 --> 02:25:28,320
uh,

3324
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:30,320
I don't know, why do you think

3325
02:25:30,320 --> 02:25:32,320
that is?

3326
02:25:34,320 --> 02:25:36,320
It's the way people

3327
02:25:36,320 --> 02:25:38,320
think, and I'm kind of reminded

3328
02:25:38,320 --> 02:25:40,320
from back in the days of everybody was

3329
02:25:40,320 --> 02:25:42,320
importing the DDR in the Beatmania

3330
02:25:42,320 --> 02:25:44,320
game to then when Konami started bringing over

3331
02:25:44,320 --> 02:25:46,320
DDR and people

3332
02:25:46,320 --> 02:25:48,320
got pissed at certain titles were not

3333
02:25:48,320 --> 02:25:50,320
in the US releases, they were like, I'm not going

3334
02:25:50,320 --> 02:25:52,320
to buy it, the game comes out, they

3335
02:25:52,320 --> 02:25:54,320
buy it anyway to support

3336
02:25:54,320 --> 02:25:56,320
their fandom. As for these next-gen

3337
02:25:56,320 --> 02:25:58,320
consoles, one of the reasons why people are going to

3338
02:25:58,320 --> 02:26:00,320
buy them is to support the console, they think it's going

3339
02:26:00,320 --> 02:26:02,320
to work. To be fair, buddy,

3340
02:26:02,320 --> 02:26:04,320
you're talking about a $40 game versus a

3341
02:26:04,320 --> 02:26:06,320
$500 console, potentially, potentially.

3342
02:26:06,320 --> 02:26:08,320
I know, but it's how some people

3343
02:26:08,320 --> 02:26:10,320
think, and that's kind of scary.

3344
02:26:10,320 --> 02:26:12,320
Yeah. And

3345
02:26:12,320 --> 02:26:14,320
with the fact that Microsoft's bringing up

3346
02:26:14,320 --> 02:26:16,320
so many servers, I don't think

3347
02:26:16,320 --> 02:26:18,320
there's going to be that big of an issue of server downtime.

3348
02:26:18,320 --> 02:26:20,320
You don't?

3349
02:26:20,320 --> 02:26:22,320
I don't think so.

3350
02:26:22,320 --> 02:26:24,320
I don't think Blizzard or EA thought so either.

3351
02:26:24,320 --> 02:26:26,320
That's my worry.

3352
02:26:26,320 --> 02:26:28,320
Well, maybe

3353
02:26:28,320 --> 02:26:30,320
I don't know how many servers

3354
02:26:30,320 --> 02:26:32,320
other manufacturers have, but I have this feeling

3355
02:26:32,320 --> 02:26:34,320
Microsoft's going to have like the most, and they said

3356
02:26:34,320 --> 02:26:36,320
straight up, they're going to bring up all these

3357
02:26:36,320 --> 02:26:38,320
servers ahead of time. So I'm guessing

3358
02:26:38,320 --> 02:26:40,320
some of the mistakes with EA and Blizzard

3359
02:26:40,320 --> 02:26:42,320
were doing with servers, so who

3360
02:26:42,320 --> 02:26:44,320
knows? So where's your head

3361
02:26:44,320 --> 02:26:46,320
out with Xbox One after all of

3362
02:26:46,320 --> 02:26:48,320
this?

3363
02:26:48,320 --> 02:26:50,320
I said before, shut up and take my money

3364
02:26:50,320 --> 02:26:52,320
for a PS4, but you know what? I'm going

3365
02:26:52,320 --> 02:26:54,320
to wait until after the presentations and see what

3366
02:26:54,320 --> 02:26:56,320
everybody has to say, and then make my decision.

3367
02:26:56,320 --> 02:26:58,320
Based off games are most

3368
02:26:58,320 --> 02:27:00,320
important?

3369
02:27:00,320 --> 02:27:02,320
Not really. It's like games,

3370
02:27:02,320 --> 02:27:04,320
technology, functionality, a little bit of everything.

3371
02:27:04,320 --> 02:27:06,320
Let me ask you one more

3372
02:27:06,320 --> 02:27:08,320
question, because I know you're a long time listener to this

3373
02:27:08,320 --> 02:27:10,320
show. Were you here at the very beginning of the show, or did you come in

3374
02:27:10,320 --> 02:27:12,320
late tonight? I was here at the very beginning of the

3375
02:27:12,320 --> 02:27:14,320
show. Okay. I wouldn't judge you if you were late,

3376
02:27:14,320 --> 02:27:16,320
but I just want to know, earlier in the show I asked

3377
02:27:16,320 --> 02:27:18,320
Dark Sakura about the golden rule of gaming,

3378
02:27:18,320 --> 02:27:20,320
and we kind of came to a consensus that

3379
02:27:20,320 --> 02:27:22,320
perhaps the golden rule of gaming, a system

3380
02:27:22,320 --> 02:27:24,320
is only as good as the games that are on it, could be

3381
02:27:24,320 --> 02:27:26,320
evolving. What do you think?

3382
02:27:26,320 --> 02:27:28,320
I think

3383
02:27:28,320 --> 02:27:30,320
so too, because

3384
02:27:30,320 --> 02:27:32,320
that golden rule is the reason why I got

3385
02:27:32,320 --> 02:27:34,320
a 360 before the PS3.

3386
02:27:34,320 --> 02:27:36,320
Because people are going to argue,

3387
02:27:36,320 --> 02:27:38,320
why did you get that next gen console?

3388
02:27:38,320 --> 02:27:40,320
All these cool games

3389
02:27:40,320 --> 02:27:42,320
were on that one, and the answer is, well,

3390
02:27:42,320 --> 02:27:44,320
those games are not games

3391
02:27:44,320 --> 02:27:46,320
I would particularly like to play.

3392
02:27:46,320 --> 02:27:48,320
The games that I've played and I've enjoyed

3393
02:27:48,320 --> 02:27:50,320
are on this console. This console is going to

3394
02:27:50,320 --> 02:27:52,320
offer these games I am interested in,

3395
02:27:52,320 --> 02:27:54,320
which is why I'm going to buy it.

3396
02:27:54,320 --> 02:27:56,320
YYR

3397
02:27:56,320 --> 02:27:58,320
in our chat saying, having to start all over

3398
02:27:58,320 --> 02:28:00,320
will make the new consoles even more expensive.

3399
02:28:00,320 --> 02:28:02,320
New controllers, new accessories, new

3400
02:28:02,320 --> 02:28:04,320
games, this is going to be expensive.

3401
02:28:04,320 --> 02:28:06,320
If the consoles are $500 or so, the

3402
02:28:06,320 --> 02:28:08,320
real cost will be a few hundred more than that.

3403
02:28:08,320 --> 02:28:10,320
I don't think it's a given that they'll buy it.

3404
02:28:10,320 --> 02:28:12,320
Well,

3405
02:28:12,320 --> 02:28:14,320
I still remember when I was

3406
02:28:14,320 --> 02:28:16,320
working at Staples, I looked outside

3407
02:28:16,320 --> 02:28:18,320
the long line of people across the street at

3408
02:28:18,320 --> 02:28:20,320
Circuit City for the

3409
02:28:20,320 --> 02:28:22,320
$500 and $600 PlayStation 3.

3410
02:28:22,320 --> 02:28:24,320
That's true, there'll be an audience

3411
02:28:24,320 --> 02:28:26,320
somewhere, but will it be big enough?

3412
02:28:26,320 --> 02:28:28,320
That's the question. Alright, Brahma, I gotta

3413
02:28:28,320 --> 02:28:30,320
let you go to get more calls, but any other thoughts before I let you go?

3414
02:28:30,320 --> 02:28:32,320
Yeah,

3415
02:28:32,320 --> 02:28:34,320
I'm sorry, but this is the thing. I don't know if

3416
02:28:34,320 --> 02:28:36,320
you heard, but GameStop had a

3417
02:28:36,320 --> 02:28:38,320
special this week on Injustice

3418
02:28:38,320 --> 02:28:40,320
Gods Among Men.

3419
02:28:40,320 --> 02:28:42,320
You mean Gods Among Us, but yes.

3420
02:28:42,320 --> 02:28:44,320
$10, one hour

3421
02:28:44,320 --> 02:28:46,320
sale only. So many people

3422
02:28:46,320 --> 02:28:48,320
flooded the site to try to buy it

3423
02:28:48,320 --> 02:28:50,320
online. What I found out about this,

3424
02:28:50,320 --> 02:28:52,320
I went and I printed out the

3425
02:28:52,320 --> 02:28:54,320
paper. When I got out of class, I

3426
02:28:54,320 --> 02:28:56,320
went down to Best Buy, and I

3427
02:28:56,320 --> 02:28:58,320
got them to price match a $60

3428
02:28:58,320 --> 02:29:00,320
game for $10

3429
02:29:00,320 --> 02:29:02,320
that happened about two and a half

3430
02:29:02,320 --> 02:29:04,320
hours after the sale ended. Nice work.

3431
02:29:06,320 --> 02:29:08,320
Did you enjoy the game?

3432
02:29:08,320 --> 02:29:10,320
Yes, it's one of the few games where I

3433
02:29:10,320 --> 02:29:12,320
actually enjoyed it because I was playing it

3434
02:29:12,320 --> 02:29:14,320
more for the story than anything else.

3435
02:29:14,320 --> 02:29:16,320
As coming from someone who

3436
02:29:16,320 --> 02:29:18,320
does not believe in paying

3437
02:29:18,320 --> 02:29:20,320
retail price for a game unless you can

3438
02:29:20,320 --> 02:29:22,320
get it to knock down, I honestly

3439
02:29:22,320 --> 02:29:24,320
say the game

3440
02:29:24,320 --> 02:29:26,320
is worth $50

3441
02:29:26,320 --> 02:29:28,320
at least. I can't see myself

3442
02:29:28,320 --> 02:29:30,320
paying $59. I see myself paying

3443
02:29:30,320 --> 02:29:32,320
$49 or maybe $54, but

3444
02:29:32,320 --> 02:29:34,320
full retail, no. It is a

3445
02:29:34,320 --> 02:29:36,320
tricky line once you break that $50 barrier.

3446
02:29:36,320 --> 02:29:38,320
It's something psychological about it, but

3447
02:29:38,320 --> 02:29:40,320
we could do a whole other episode on that.

3448
02:29:40,320 --> 02:29:42,320
But I should let you go for now, Rama.

3449
02:29:42,320 --> 02:29:44,320
Everybody listen to Anime Jam Session.

3450
02:29:44,320 --> 02:29:46,320
You got it. We'll be talking

3451
02:29:46,320 --> 02:29:48,320
about Denver Comic Con and Anime Next on Tuesday.

3452
02:29:48,320 --> 02:29:50,320
Wow, you guys got a busy show. Alright, have a good

3453
02:29:50,320 --> 02:29:52,320
one, buddy. You too. Bye.

3454
02:29:52,320 --> 02:29:54,320
Alright.

3455
02:29:54,320 --> 02:29:56,320
That's right. Even though we've been talking a lot

3456
02:29:56,320 --> 02:29:58,320
on this show about E3, there's

3457
02:29:58,320 --> 02:30:00,320
lots of other nerd shows at the Voice of Geeks Network

3458
02:30:00,320 --> 02:30:02,320
talking about other stuff. So there's anime conventions going on.

3459
02:30:02,320 --> 02:30:04,320
I'm sure somebody's going to be talking about

3460
02:30:04,320 --> 02:30:06,320
Apple stuff on Monday, so

3461
02:30:06,320 --> 02:30:08,320
stay tuned for that and all the great

3462
02:30:08,320 --> 02:30:10,320
shows on the Voice of Geeks Network at vognetwork.com

3463
02:30:10,320 --> 02:30:12,320
Let's go to the phones

3464
02:30:12,320 --> 02:30:14,320
which are lighting up and take another call.

3465
02:30:14,320 --> 02:30:16,320
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

3466
02:30:16,320 --> 02:30:18,320
This

3467
02:30:18,320 --> 02:30:20,320
is YYR. I just

3468
02:30:20,320 --> 02:30:22,320
called to drop this rhyme.

3469
02:30:22,320 --> 02:30:24,320
Haha, I'm a troll.

3470
02:30:28,320 --> 02:30:30,320
We're going to have to have

3471
02:30:30,320 --> 02:30:32,320
haiku call night at some point, and

3472
02:30:32,320 --> 02:30:34,320
everybody will have to do that.

3473
02:30:34,320 --> 02:30:36,320
Well played, my friend. Well played.

3474
02:30:36,320 --> 02:30:38,320
I'm tipping my hat to you. You just can't

3475
02:30:38,320 --> 02:30:40,320
see it.

3476
02:30:40,320 --> 02:30:42,320
Rob's hat is invisible and intangible.

3477
02:30:42,320 --> 02:30:44,320
Actually, that's really the only reason I called

3478
02:30:44,320 --> 02:30:46,320
it. That's right. Well, since I have

3479
02:30:46,320 --> 02:30:48,320
a captive audience, how is

3480
02:30:48,320 --> 02:30:50,320
bungee ferret tossing going?

3481
02:30:50,320 --> 02:30:52,320
Haha.

3482
02:30:52,320 --> 02:30:54,320
It's beer money. Beer money is great

3483
02:30:54,320 --> 02:30:56,320
because it buys beer.

3484
02:30:56,320 --> 02:30:58,320
But I don't think

3485
02:30:58,320 --> 02:31:00,320
you've seen the last of bungee ferret tossing.

3486
02:31:00,320 --> 02:31:02,320
I'm

3487
02:31:02,320 --> 02:31:04,320
deep in other projects right now

3488
02:31:04,320 --> 02:31:06,320
such as ports to

3489
02:31:06,320 --> 02:31:08,320
the smartphones and tablets I

3490
02:31:08,320 --> 02:31:10,320
like to complain about, but

3491
02:31:10,320 --> 02:31:12,320
I think at some point I would love

3492
02:31:12,320 --> 02:31:14,320
to revisit that universe, yes.

3493
02:31:14,320 --> 02:31:16,320
Wow, okay. Very cool.

3494
02:31:16,320 --> 02:31:18,320
What do you think about the way

3495
02:31:18,320 --> 02:31:20,320
there's been a lot of news about Xbox One

3496
02:31:20,320 --> 02:31:22,320
is kind of shafting indies or whatever.

3497
02:31:22,320 --> 02:31:24,320
I mean, as somebody who developed

3498
02:31:24,320 --> 02:31:26,320
quite a bit, you did several games, not just

3499
02:31:26,320 --> 02:31:28,320
bungee ferret tossing, but I know you had Snake 360

3500
02:31:28,320 --> 02:31:30,320
and Falling. You did a few games for

3501
02:31:30,320 --> 02:31:32,320
the XNA

3502
02:31:32,320 --> 02:31:34,320
or Xbox Live

3503
02:31:34,320 --> 02:31:36,320
indie games. What do you think about all this news

3504
02:31:36,320 --> 02:31:38,320
about Xbox One?

3505
02:31:38,320 --> 02:31:40,320
Well, I mean, as far as

3506
02:31:40,320 --> 02:31:42,320
indie games in general

3507
02:31:42,320 --> 02:31:44,320
specifically, Microsoft

3508
02:31:44,320 --> 02:31:46,320
already said they're not going to allow anyone to

3509
02:31:46,320 --> 02:31:48,320
self-publish on one

3510
02:31:48,320 --> 02:31:50,320
at first. And

3511
02:31:50,320 --> 02:31:52,320
I think that's a game changer

3512
02:31:52,320 --> 02:31:54,320
especially when Sony has

3513
02:31:54,320 --> 02:31:56,320
come out and said, yes, if you want to self-publish

3514
02:31:56,320 --> 02:31:58,320
come to us. PS4

3515
02:31:58,320 --> 02:32:00,320
will be happy to

3516
02:32:00,320 --> 02:32:02,320
host your self-published game.

3517
02:32:02,320 --> 02:32:04,320
And of course Nintendo is

3518
02:32:04,320 --> 02:32:06,320
welcoming

3519
02:32:06,320 --> 02:32:08,320
self-publishing on

3520
02:32:08,320 --> 02:32:10,320
Wii U as well to some degree.

3521
02:32:10,320 --> 02:32:12,320
I think you still need a business address

3522
02:32:12,320 --> 02:32:14,320
to be a developer for a Nintendo platform.

3523
02:32:14,320 --> 02:32:16,320
But besides that

3524
02:32:16,320 --> 02:32:18,320
yeah,

3525
02:32:18,320 --> 02:32:20,320
it seems that

3526
02:32:20,320 --> 02:32:22,320
Microsoft

3527
02:32:22,320 --> 02:32:24,320
is going to be the least indie-friendly

3528
02:32:24,320 --> 02:32:26,320
next-gen console out of the

3529
02:32:26,320 --> 02:32:28,320
gate. So with that

3530
02:32:28,320 --> 02:32:30,320
in mind, I think that

3531
02:32:30,320 --> 02:32:32,320
depending on how much indie games

3532
02:32:32,320 --> 02:32:34,320
influence

3533
02:32:34,320 --> 02:32:36,320
the next console generation

3534
02:32:36,320 --> 02:32:38,320
that may not matter at all or it may

3535
02:32:38,320 --> 02:32:40,320
matter a lot. It's all going to

3536
02:32:40,320 --> 02:32:42,320
depend on how big of a blip

3537
02:32:42,320 --> 02:32:44,320
on the radar indie games are

3538
02:32:44,320 --> 02:32:46,320
over the next console gen.

3539
02:32:46,320 --> 02:32:48,320
Before I let you go

3540
02:32:48,320 --> 02:32:50,320
It's crazy.

3541
02:32:50,320 --> 02:32:52,320
It's absolutely crazy.

3542
02:32:52,320 --> 02:32:54,320
And I think

3543
02:32:54,320 --> 02:32:56,320
all eyes are going to be on Sony

3544
02:32:56,320 --> 02:32:58,320
at that after-conference

3545
02:32:58,320 --> 02:33:00,320
presser.

3546
02:33:00,320 --> 02:33:02,320
Is PS4 going to be like

3547
02:33:02,320 --> 02:33:04,320
this? Is it going to be like that?

3548
02:33:04,320 --> 02:33:06,320
Is it going to allow us to do this?

3549
02:33:06,320 --> 02:33:08,320
And the answers given there are really going to make

3550
02:33:08,320 --> 02:33:10,320
a big difference as far as how people

3551
02:33:10,320 --> 02:33:12,320
perceive not just the

3552
02:33:12,320 --> 02:33:14,320
Xbox One, but all of the new

3553
02:33:14,320 --> 02:33:16,320
consoles, really.

3554
02:33:16,320 --> 02:33:18,320
I mean, literally, tomorrow

3555
02:33:18,320 --> 02:33:20,320
12 hours away is a huge

3556
02:33:20,320 --> 02:33:22,320
day in gaming.

3557
02:33:22,320 --> 02:33:24,320
One of the biggest ever.

3558
02:33:24,320 --> 02:33:26,320
I'll be on the edge

3559
02:33:26,320 --> 02:33:28,320
of my seat and I know probably

3560
02:33:28,320 --> 02:33:30,320
all of us will be to some

3561
02:33:30,320 --> 02:33:32,320
extent, yes.

3562
02:33:32,320 --> 02:33:34,320
I don't know, I'm going to take a nap.

3563
02:33:34,320 --> 02:33:36,320
Before I let you go, buddy,

3564
02:33:36,320 --> 02:33:38,320
I always kind of like to ask this. I know you just

3565
02:33:38,320 --> 02:33:40,320
called in to give a haiku and here we are with an interview,

3566
02:33:40,320 --> 02:33:42,320
but outside of developing

3567
02:33:42,320 --> 02:33:44,320
your own stuff, what games are you playing?

3568
02:33:44,320 --> 02:33:46,320
What are you enjoying playing lately?

3569
02:33:46,320 --> 02:33:48,320
I've been playing a lot of Tekken

3570
02:33:48,320 --> 02:33:50,320
lately. I actually

3571
02:33:50,320 --> 02:33:52,320
bought the Wii U version just

3572
02:33:52,320 --> 02:33:54,320
out of curiosity and

3573
02:33:54,320 --> 02:33:56,320
I can say

3574
02:33:56,320 --> 02:33:58,320
Tekken Ball, I don't know

3575
02:33:58,320 --> 02:34:00,320
who remembers the Tekken Ball

3576
02:34:00,320 --> 02:34:02,320
minigame in Tekken 3.

3577
02:34:02,320 --> 02:34:04,320
Totally do.

3578
02:34:04,320 --> 02:34:06,320
Yeah, they basically

3579
02:34:06,320 --> 02:34:08,320
updated it graphically and now

3580
02:34:08,320 --> 02:34:10,320
you can actually select

3581
02:34:10,320 --> 02:34:12,320
different balls to use and

3582
02:34:12,320 --> 02:34:14,320
the difference is basically in how

3583
02:34:14,320 --> 02:34:16,320
fast they move, how

3584
02:34:16,320 --> 02:34:18,320
quickly they charge up damage.

3585
02:34:18,320 --> 02:34:20,320
So it's a little bit more customizable

3586
02:34:20,320 --> 02:34:22,320
than it was before and of course you can use

3587
02:34:22,320 --> 02:34:24,320
tag teams, which is for

3588
02:34:24,320 --> 02:34:26,320
Tekken Ball, mostly useless, but

3589
02:34:26,320 --> 02:34:28,320
it's fun anyway.

3590
02:34:28,320 --> 02:34:30,320
So that is pretty much

3591
02:34:30,320 --> 02:34:32,320
the major addition to

3592
02:34:32,320 --> 02:34:34,320
the Tekken on Wii U.

3593
02:34:34,320 --> 02:34:36,320
The mushroom battle that

3594
02:34:36,320 --> 02:34:38,320
everyone made such a big deal about and looks like

3595
02:34:38,320 --> 02:34:40,320
so much fun in videos, it's really not all

3596
02:34:40,320 --> 02:34:42,320
it's cracked up to be.

3597
02:34:42,320 --> 02:34:44,320
I mean, it's fun

3598
02:34:44,320 --> 02:34:46,320
for like five minutes, but after the

3599
02:34:46,320 --> 02:34:48,320
novelty wears off, because basically

3600
02:34:48,320 --> 02:34:50,320
it's like the poison mushrooms

3601
02:34:50,320 --> 02:34:52,320
that shrink you

3602
02:34:52,320 --> 02:34:54,320
and the super mushrooms that

3603
02:34:54,320 --> 02:34:56,320
grow you, the poison mushrooms

3604
02:34:56,320 --> 02:34:58,320
also hurt you and

3605
02:34:58,320 --> 02:35:00,320
the damage is really high to begin

3606
02:35:00,320 --> 02:35:02,320
with, so it's like

3607
02:35:02,320 --> 02:35:04,320
you get a couple mushrooms and already

3608
02:35:04,320 --> 02:35:06,320
one more hit and you're dead.

3609
02:35:06,320 --> 02:35:08,320
So it's over way too quickly and

3610
02:35:08,320 --> 02:35:10,320
you can't play it online and you

3611
02:35:10,320 --> 02:35:12,320
can't use tag teams and it's

3612
02:35:12,320 --> 02:35:14,320
just not that great.

3613
02:35:14,320 --> 02:35:16,320
And also online, not too many people

3614
02:35:16,320 --> 02:35:18,320
playing for reasons that you could probably

3615
02:35:18,320 --> 02:35:20,320
guess, but other than that

3616
02:35:20,320 --> 02:35:22,320
it's the same game.

3617
02:35:22,320 --> 02:35:24,320
Alright, well I haven't

3618
02:35:24,320 --> 02:35:26,320
played a lot of Tekken in a while, so maybe I should

3619
02:35:26,320 --> 02:35:28,320
maybe I should rent

3620
02:35:28,320 --> 02:35:30,320
Tekken on Nintendo Wii U since my Wii

3621
02:35:30,320 --> 02:35:32,320
will allow me to do that.

3622
02:35:32,320 --> 02:35:34,320
The actual last one that I

3623
02:35:34,320 --> 02:35:36,320
bought was Tekken 4. I am warning you though

3624
02:35:36,320 --> 02:35:38,320
Tekken has gotten extremely complex

3625
02:35:38,320 --> 02:35:40,320
over the years, so

3626
02:35:40,320 --> 02:35:42,320
the learning curve is as steep now

3627
02:35:42,320 --> 02:35:44,320
as it ever was, or possibly

3628
02:35:44,320 --> 02:35:46,320
steeper. So as long as you're okay with that

3629
02:35:46,320 --> 02:35:48,320
you know, enjoy. Enjoy your

3630
02:35:48,320 --> 02:35:50,320
rental that you can actually do.

3631
02:35:50,320 --> 02:35:52,320
Alright, well alright, take care buddy, I'm gonna

3632
02:35:52,320 --> 02:35:54,320
let you go to see if we can get one more call, but

3633
02:35:54,320 --> 02:35:56,320
enjoy all the E3 stuff this week and

3634
02:35:56,320 --> 02:35:58,320
we'll talk to you later.

3635
02:35:58,320 --> 02:36:00,320
Well we'll either enjoy it or not enjoy it,

3636
02:36:00,320 --> 02:36:02,320
one of those. That's true, this is the first

3637
02:36:02,320 --> 02:36:04,320
Alright, you too.

3638
02:36:04,320 --> 02:36:06,320
This is the first year where

3639
02:36:06,320 --> 02:36:08,320
we can't necessarily say we're gonna enjoy it, are we?

3640
02:36:08,320 --> 02:36:10,320
Alright, 1877 game

3641
02:36:10,320 --> 02:36:12,320
OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio

3642
02:36:12,320 --> 02:36:14,320
We got time for about one more call here

3643
02:36:14,320 --> 02:36:16,320
Any last minute stories

3644
02:36:16,320 --> 02:36:18,320
while we're waiting for calls?

3645
02:36:18,320 --> 02:36:20,320
Yes, actually I do have one.

3646
02:36:20,320 --> 02:36:22,320
It's a hack that was done

3647
02:36:22,320 --> 02:36:24,320
for New Super Mario Brothers

3648
02:36:24,320 --> 02:36:26,320
on the Wii

3649
02:36:26,320 --> 02:36:28,320
and it's just been released. It's a total

3650
02:36:28,320 --> 02:36:30,320
conversion for the game called Newer Super Mario

3651
02:36:30,320 --> 02:36:32,320
Brothers. 120 all new

3652
02:36:32,320 --> 02:36:34,320
levels, remixed and original

3653
02:36:34,320 --> 02:36:36,320
graphics to the game, themes

3654
02:36:36,320 --> 02:36:38,320
and music, classic

3655
02:36:38,320 --> 02:36:40,320
power-ups, also

3656
02:36:40,320 --> 02:36:42,320
new bosses and that kind of stuff

3657
02:36:42,320 --> 02:36:44,320
and you can get it if you have a

3658
02:36:44,320 --> 02:36:46,320
homebrew-enabled Wii.

3659
02:36:46,320 --> 02:36:48,320
There's no piracy or hardware mods

3660
02:36:48,320 --> 02:36:50,320
needed, so

3661
02:36:50,320 --> 02:36:52,320
I believe it's just a save

3662
02:36:52,320 --> 02:36:54,320
file that you put on there

3663
02:36:54,320 --> 02:36:56,320
and you can download that at

3664
02:36:56,320 --> 02:36:58,320
NewerTeam.com

3665
02:36:58,320 --> 02:37:00,320
That's where you can find that.

3666
02:37:02,320 --> 02:37:04,320
Is that it? I'm trying to pull up

3667
02:37:04,320 --> 02:37:06,320
Twitter here. I've been looking at the

3668
02:37:06,320 --> 02:37:08,320
Xbox 720 checkpoint

3669
02:37:08,320 --> 02:37:10,320
thing that came out last year. Remember the whole

3670
02:37:10,320 --> 02:37:12,320
leak about VR and stuff

3671
02:37:12,320 --> 02:37:14,320
and a lot of it sounds exactly

3672
02:37:14,320 --> 02:37:16,320
what they're talking about right now, so who knows?

3673
02:37:16,320 --> 02:37:18,320
Next year maybe we might see some sort of Xbox

3674
02:37:18,320 --> 02:37:20,320
glasses or something.

3675
02:37:20,320 --> 02:37:22,320
Straight up even to the

3676
02:37:24,320 --> 02:37:26,320
slogan

3677
02:37:26,320 --> 02:37:28,320
that makes no fucking sense.

3678
02:37:28,320 --> 02:37:30,320
Next Generation Entertainment, one box

3679
02:37:30,320 --> 02:37:32,320
input one.

3680
02:37:32,320 --> 02:37:34,320
Like why

3681
02:37:34,320 --> 02:37:36,320
would you even do that?

3682
02:37:36,320 --> 02:37:38,320
I don't know.

3683
02:37:38,320 --> 02:37:40,320
Alright.

3684
02:37:40,320 --> 02:37:42,320
Let's take another call.

3685
02:37:42,320 --> 02:37:44,320
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

3686
02:37:46,320 --> 02:37:48,320
Hi, this is Raginator.

3687
02:37:48,320 --> 02:37:50,320
Hey Raginator. I was going to say I didn't see the

3688
02:37:50,320 --> 02:37:52,320
cam come on at first. There it is. What's up

3689
02:37:52,320 --> 02:37:54,320
Raginator?

3690
02:37:54,320 --> 02:37:56,320
Just a quick question.

3691
02:37:56,320 --> 02:37:58,320
It's kind of a loaded one.

3692
02:37:58,320 --> 02:38:00,320
You kind of touched

3693
02:38:00,320 --> 02:38:02,320
on something I'll be briefly

3694
02:38:02,320 --> 02:38:04,320
earlier during the show.

3695
02:38:04,320 --> 02:38:06,320
Rare is

3696
02:38:06,320 --> 02:38:08,320
kind of hinted that

3697
02:38:08,320 --> 02:38:10,320
they're working on something and everyone's

3698
02:38:10,320 --> 02:38:12,320
speculating their

3699
02:38:12,320 --> 02:38:14,320
necessity to all franchise.

3700
02:38:14,320 --> 02:38:16,320
Most people seem to think

3701
02:38:16,320 --> 02:38:18,320
it's going to be either Conquer or

3702
02:38:18,320 --> 02:38:20,320
Kill Instinct. What are

3703
02:38:20,320 --> 02:38:22,320
your thoughts on that?

3704
02:38:22,320 --> 02:38:24,320
Well

3705
02:38:24,320 --> 02:38:26,320
we had a screenshot that was leaked

3706
02:38:26,320 --> 02:38:28,320
but again

3707
02:38:28,320 --> 02:38:30,320
it's one of those anybody could have with a

3708
02:38:30,320 --> 02:38:32,320
Photoshop. Oh did they prove it fake?

3709
02:38:32,320 --> 02:38:34,320
Yeah. Proved it fake?

3710
02:38:34,320 --> 02:38:36,320
You're talking about the one that had like Banjo-Kazooie

3711
02:38:36,320 --> 02:38:38,320
Yeah it was fake because they had

3712
02:38:38,320 --> 02:38:40,320
that Microsoft

3713
02:38:40,320 --> 02:38:42,320
game. The Halo

3714
02:38:42,320 --> 02:38:44,320
Spartan

3715
02:38:44,320 --> 02:38:46,320
Assault or whatever but the logo was different.

3716
02:38:46,320 --> 02:38:48,320
And it's because that stuff that

3717
02:38:48,320 --> 02:38:50,320
they got on there was either

3718
02:38:50,320 --> 02:38:52,320
wishful thinking and trademarks that they had

3719
02:38:52,320 --> 02:38:54,320
already done.

3720
02:38:54,320 --> 02:38:56,320
It wasn't anything new. It was fake.

3721
02:38:56,320 --> 02:38:58,320
So it's not

3722
02:38:58,320 --> 02:39:00,320
it's not going to be Banjo-Kazooie. I don't think it would be

3723
02:39:00,320 --> 02:39:02,320
Banjo-Kazooie anyways because it wouldn't be that big a deal.

3724
02:39:02,320 --> 02:39:04,320
It would be just kind of like ehhhh

3725
02:39:04,320 --> 02:39:06,320
whatever because they had a new Banjo game and it was

3726
02:39:06,320 --> 02:39:08,320
just it was alright but

3727
02:39:08,320 --> 02:39:10,320
I'm going to go with the easy answer

3728
02:39:10,320 --> 02:39:12,320
and say Killer Instinct based off

3729
02:39:12,320 --> 02:39:14,320
the whole trademark dispute that they

3730
02:39:14,320 --> 02:39:16,320
got settled. There wouldn't have

3731
02:39:16,320 --> 02:39:18,320
been a reason to do that otherwise I don't think

3732
02:39:18,320 --> 02:39:20,320
if they didn't want to keep that door open for some reason.

3733
02:39:20,320 --> 02:39:22,320
And I think they know that's what

3734
02:39:22,320 --> 02:39:24,320
everybody wants and

3735
02:39:24,320 --> 02:39:26,320
especially with where they're going with all this

3736
02:39:26,320 --> 02:39:28,320
DRM debacle

3737
02:39:28,320 --> 02:39:30,320
it's going to take a franchise like that

3738
02:39:30,320 --> 02:39:32,320
to make people

3739
02:39:32,320 --> 02:39:34,320
what's it going to take for you to sell your morals

3740
02:39:34,320 --> 02:39:36,320
up the river? Essentially.

3741
02:39:36,320 --> 02:39:38,320
And I mean

3742
02:39:38,320 --> 02:39:40,320
honestly if Xbox could come out

3743
02:39:40,320 --> 02:39:42,320
and say you know what we're going to have

3744
02:39:42,320 --> 02:39:44,320
we're going to have Rob's Fantasy games

3745
02:39:44,320 --> 02:39:46,320
Mass Effect 4

3746
02:39:46,320 --> 02:39:48,320
The Guardian Legend 2 and the things I

3747
02:39:48,320 --> 02:39:50,320
want to see it's going to be hard for me

3748
02:39:50,320 --> 02:39:52,320
to even go God I fucking

3749
02:39:52,320 --> 02:39:54,320
hate what they're doing but I really really really

3750
02:39:54,320 --> 02:39:56,320
want these games it's going to be hard it's easy for

3751
02:39:56,320 --> 02:39:58,320
me to sit here now and go I don't

3752
02:39:58,320 --> 02:40:00,320
need Halo 5

3753
02:40:00,320 --> 02:40:02,320
I don't need a new Killer Instinct

3754
02:40:02,320 --> 02:40:04,320
I don't need some of

3755
02:40:04,320 --> 02:40:06,320
this other stuff they're talking about because

3756
02:40:06,320 --> 02:40:08,320
I can kind of be satisfied with Playstation 4

3757
02:40:08,320 --> 02:40:10,320
Well and technically we don't need any of it

3758
02:40:10,320 --> 02:40:12,320
we need air and water

3759
02:40:12,320 --> 02:40:14,320
No I need Guardian Legend 2

3760
02:40:14,320 --> 02:40:16,320
Jamie I need it. Rob

3761
02:40:16,320 --> 02:40:18,320
I need it. Rob. I need it!

3762
02:40:18,320 --> 02:40:20,320
Intervention! What about you Jamie?

3763
02:40:20,320 --> 02:40:22,320
What? A rare franchise

3764
02:40:22,320 --> 02:40:24,320
that's coming back

3765
02:40:24,320 --> 02:40:26,320
Killer Instinct?

3766
02:40:26,320 --> 02:40:28,320
How about you Raginator?

3767
02:40:28,320 --> 02:40:30,320
Well I

3768
02:40:30,320 --> 02:40:32,320
would love to see another Killer

3769
02:40:32,320 --> 02:40:34,320
Instinct. God only knows

3770
02:40:34,320 --> 02:40:36,320
I played the Jesus out

3771
02:40:36,320 --> 02:40:38,320
of the

3772
02:40:38,320 --> 02:40:40,320
SNES port

3773
02:40:40,320 --> 02:40:42,320
along with the

3774
02:40:42,320 --> 02:40:44,320
N64 game

3775
02:40:44,320 --> 02:40:46,320
but I'm a little concerned because

3776
02:40:46,320 --> 02:40:48,320
you know

3777
02:40:48,320 --> 02:40:50,320
the history has shown that

3778
02:40:50,320 --> 02:40:52,320
both first priorities and

3779
02:40:52,320 --> 02:40:54,320
third priorities tend to

3780
02:40:54,320 --> 02:40:56,320
really

3781
02:40:56,320 --> 02:40:58,320
go overboard

3782
02:40:58,320 --> 02:41:00,320
screw with

3783
02:41:00,320 --> 02:41:02,320
a proven formula

3784
02:41:02,320 --> 02:41:04,320
and

3785
02:41:04,320 --> 02:41:06,320
when

3786
02:41:06,320 --> 02:41:08,320
they screw with

3787
02:41:08,320 --> 02:41:10,320
a given formula that's proven

3788
02:41:10,320 --> 02:41:12,320
to be a winner

3789
02:41:12,320 --> 02:41:14,320
a lot of people tend to revolve

3790
02:41:14,320 --> 02:41:16,320
Case is a point

3791
02:41:16,320 --> 02:41:18,320
Capcom screwed with

3792
02:41:18,320 --> 02:41:20,320
you know

3793
02:41:20,320 --> 02:41:22,320
the Final Fight with

3794
02:41:22,320 --> 02:41:24,320
Streetwise for the PS2

3795
02:41:24,320 --> 02:41:26,320
turned the 2D

3796
02:41:26,320 --> 02:41:28,320
brawler into a 3D brawler

3797
02:41:28,320 --> 02:41:30,320
that didn't do too well

3798
02:41:30,320 --> 02:41:32,320
they also

3799
02:41:32,320 --> 02:41:34,320
screwed with Street Fighter

3800
02:41:34,320 --> 02:41:36,320
and came out with the

3801
02:41:36,320 --> 02:41:38,320
EX series

3802
02:41:38,320 --> 02:41:40,320
didn't do too well

3803
02:41:40,320 --> 02:41:42,320
and of course there was

3804
02:41:42,320 --> 02:41:44,320
a whole

3805
02:41:44,320 --> 02:41:46,320
more common port on the

3806
02:41:46,320 --> 02:41:48,320
SNES which

3807
02:41:48,320 --> 02:41:50,320
still gets kind of

3808
02:41:50,320 --> 02:41:52,320
paid today

3809
02:41:52,320 --> 02:41:54,320
In defense of the Street Fighter

3810
02:41:54,320 --> 02:41:56,320
EX series EX3 was pretty good

3811
02:41:56,320 --> 02:41:58,320
I want to say with Capcom too since you brought up

3812
02:41:58,320 --> 02:42:00,320
Mega Man I think there's a very strong possibility

3813
02:42:00,320 --> 02:42:02,320
Mega Man fans will finally have something

3814
02:42:02,320 --> 02:42:04,320
to celebrate this week I don't know if that'll

3815
02:42:04,320 --> 02:42:06,320
just be a little victory or something but I just

3816
02:42:06,320 --> 02:42:08,320
think the timing is right

3817
02:42:08,320 --> 02:42:10,320
for Capcom to unveil what

3818
02:42:10,320 --> 02:42:12,320
they're going to do with Mega Man since they pretty much

3819
02:42:12,320 --> 02:42:14,320
said they're not killing them off

3820
02:42:14,320 --> 02:42:16,320
so whether that be a

3821
02:42:16,320 --> 02:42:18,320
reboot of Legends 3 or whatever

3822
02:42:18,320 --> 02:42:20,320
Mega Man 11 for god's

3823
02:42:20,320 --> 02:42:22,320
sake whatever they're doing I think next week

3824
02:42:22,320 --> 02:42:24,320
is very good for that but

3825
02:42:24,320 --> 02:42:26,320
you know that's an easy thing to predict

3826
02:42:26,320 --> 02:42:28,320
but we'll see if it actually happens

3827
02:42:28,320 --> 02:42:30,320
Well ultimately

3828
02:42:30,320 --> 02:42:32,320
if they do make a

3829
02:42:32,320 --> 02:42:34,320
killer receipt

3830
02:42:34,320 --> 02:42:36,320
I would love to see it

3831
02:42:36,320 --> 02:42:38,320
just don't screw it up

3832
02:42:38,320 --> 02:42:40,320
make minor tweaks here and there

3833
02:42:40,320 --> 02:42:42,320
maybe add new characters

3834
02:42:42,320 --> 02:42:44,320
maybe a mechanic

3835
02:42:44,320 --> 02:42:46,320
here or there

3836
02:42:46,320 --> 02:42:48,320
but don't go radically changing

3837
02:42:48,320 --> 02:42:50,320
the game to the point where

3838
02:42:50,320 --> 02:42:52,320
it's basically

3839
02:42:52,320 --> 02:42:54,320
a totally different game

3840
02:42:54,320 --> 02:42:56,320
it's only related to

3841
02:42:56,320 --> 02:42:58,320
previous games by name only

3842
02:42:58,320 --> 02:43:00,320
Alright

3843
02:43:00,320 --> 02:43:02,320
Well Raginator before I let you go here tonight I

3844
02:43:02,320 --> 02:43:04,320
noticed that you also submitted a tweet to us

3845
02:43:04,320 --> 02:43:06,320
at twitter.com slash o-l-r so

3846
02:43:06,320 --> 02:43:08,320
allow me to read

3847
02:43:08,320 --> 02:43:10,320
Random question

3848
02:43:10,320 --> 02:43:12,320
when playing Gyruss how many warps are there

3849
02:43:12,320 --> 02:43:14,320
to Uranus? I'm not going to say it

3850
02:43:14,320 --> 02:43:16,320
the other way. I asked because I just

3851
02:43:16,320 --> 02:43:18,320
wanted to type Uranus

3852
02:43:18,320 --> 02:43:20,320
well there you go and now I read it

3853
02:43:20,320 --> 02:43:22,320
there on air so congratulations

3854
02:43:22,320 --> 02:43:24,320
and if I remember right it would be 3 warps

3855
02:43:24,320 --> 02:43:26,320
to Neptune and then 3 more

3856
02:43:26,320 --> 02:43:28,320
to Uranus

3857
02:43:28,320 --> 02:43:30,320
6 warps

3858
02:43:30,320 --> 02:43:32,320
to Uranus Raginator

3859
02:43:32,320 --> 02:43:34,320
Yeah I know it's

3860
02:43:34,320 --> 02:43:36,320
I came up with something

3861
02:43:36,320 --> 02:43:38,320
It's alright, so's the show

3862
02:43:38,320 --> 02:43:40,320
so's the show Raginator

3863
02:43:40,320 --> 02:43:42,320
Alright have a good one buddy

3864
02:43:42,320 --> 02:43:44,320
Alright bye

3865
02:43:44,320 --> 02:43:46,320
I feel like that's like

3866
02:43:46,320 --> 02:43:48,320
wishing people a Merry Christmas

3867
02:43:48,320 --> 02:43:50,320
or Happy Hanukkah

3868
02:43:50,320 --> 02:43:52,320
I feel like you should wish video gamers a Happy E3

3869
02:43:52,320 --> 02:43:54,320
even when E3 is going to be bad news

3870
02:43:54,320 --> 02:43:56,320
like it's just like people fight

3871
02:43:56,320 --> 02:43:58,320
May you not be as disappointed

3872
02:43:58,320 --> 02:44:00,320
this year as you were last

3873
02:44:00,320 --> 02:44:02,320
What should like Happy E3

3874
02:44:02,320 --> 02:44:04,320
Merry E3

3875
02:44:04,320 --> 02:44:06,320
You're E3, what should the

3876
02:44:06,320 --> 02:44:08,320
greeting be to other gamers

3877
02:44:08,320 --> 02:44:10,320
this time of year?

3878
02:44:10,320 --> 02:44:12,320
Dark Soccer you're

3879
02:44:12,320 --> 02:44:14,320
Here's a hanky

3880
02:44:14,320 --> 02:44:16,320
You're our linguist

3881
02:44:16,320 --> 02:44:18,320
What should the greeting be to other gamers?

3882
02:44:18,320 --> 02:44:20,320
Blessed E3

3883
02:44:20,320 --> 02:44:22,320
That might be a little too much

3884
02:44:22,320 --> 02:44:24,320
Blessed E3

3885
02:44:24,320 --> 02:44:26,320
How about

3886
02:44:26,320 --> 02:44:28,320
How about Wink Free E3

3887
02:44:28,320 --> 02:44:30,320
Alright maybe I'll

3888
02:44:30,320 --> 02:44:32,320
throw that question to the chatters and see what they come up with

3889
02:44:32,320 --> 02:44:34,320
but for now I am going to close the Skype line

3890
02:44:34,320 --> 02:44:36,320
if you do have further thoughts on any of tonight's topics

3891
02:44:36,320 --> 02:44:38,320
Mailbag out

3892
02:44:38,320 --> 02:44:40,320
OrangeLaunchRadio.com

3893
02:44:40,320 --> 02:44:42,320
or Twitter.com slash O-L-R

3894
02:44:42,320 --> 02:44:44,320
So a screenshot leaked

3895
02:44:44,320 --> 02:44:46,320
from a brand new unannounced game

3896
02:44:46,320 --> 02:44:48,320
Oh

3897
02:44:48,320 --> 02:44:50,320
It's assumed, well we kind of assumed it was coming

3898
02:44:50,320 --> 02:44:52,320
Just Dance

3899
02:44:52,320 --> 02:44:54,320
the new Just Dance game

3900
02:44:54,320 --> 02:44:56,320
It's going to have the Ghostbusters theme in it because they have a screenshot

3901
02:44:56,320 --> 02:44:58,320
where people are dressed up like Ghostbusters

3902
02:44:58,320 --> 02:45:00,320
That's in Just Dance 4

3903
02:45:00,320 --> 02:45:02,320
Isn't it?

3904
02:45:02,320 --> 02:45:04,320
You sure about that?

3905
02:45:06,320 --> 02:45:08,320
Rob is up going to look by the way

3906
02:45:12,320 --> 02:45:14,320
Now in the chatroom by the way

3907
02:45:14,320 --> 02:45:16,320
we have a call for a new

3908
02:45:16,320 --> 02:45:18,320
Rival Schools series

3909
02:45:18,320 --> 02:45:20,320
Okay what are you looking at?

3910
02:45:20,320 --> 02:45:22,320
Just Dance 4

3911
02:45:22,320 --> 02:45:24,320
He's reading

3912
02:45:24,320 --> 02:45:26,320
It's going to take us a while because Rob's reading

3913
02:45:26,320 --> 02:45:28,320
Just kidding

3914
02:45:28,320 --> 02:45:30,320
I'm sorry Y-Y-R

3915
02:45:30,320 --> 02:45:32,320
I can't click YouTube

3916
02:45:32,320 --> 02:45:34,320
Maybe not

3917
02:45:34,320 --> 02:45:36,320
It's official because it's actually on

3918
02:45:36,320 --> 02:45:38,320
Xbox's website

3919
02:45:38,320 --> 02:45:40,320
So if you go to Xbox's Just Dance 2014

3920
02:45:40,320 --> 02:45:42,320
and they've got

3921
02:45:42,320 --> 02:45:44,320
Well I mean what a duh

3922
02:45:44,320 --> 02:45:46,320
They're going to do a new Just Dance game

3923
02:45:46,320 --> 02:45:48,320
I mean come on these games sell like crazy

3924
02:45:48,320 --> 02:45:50,320
and it's not a bad game

3925
02:45:50,320 --> 02:45:52,320
They have a guy that looks like Beetlejuice in here

3926
02:45:52,320 --> 02:45:54,320
What?

3927
02:45:54,320 --> 02:45:56,320
I mean that looks like Beetlejuice

3928
02:45:56,320 --> 02:45:58,320
I'm assuming that maybe that's

3929
02:45:58,320 --> 02:46:00,320
A ghost

3930
02:46:00,320 --> 02:46:02,320
Alright as far as the E3

3931
02:46:02,320 --> 02:46:04,320
greetings in our chatroom Misty says

3932
02:46:04,320 --> 02:46:06,320
Happy E3 I would think

3933
02:46:06,320 --> 02:46:08,320
Let's keep it simple why over think it

3934
02:46:08,320 --> 02:46:10,320
Maybe be Happy E3 Happy E3

3935
02:46:10,320 --> 02:46:12,320
Happy E3 I like that

3936
02:46:12,320 --> 02:46:14,320
Alright a couple of tweets from TigerClaw

3937
02:46:14,320 --> 02:46:16,320
I apologize

3938
02:46:16,320 --> 02:46:18,320
I don't think you read this one yet but I know it was in the

3939
02:46:18,320 --> 02:46:20,320
list of stories we just didn't get to it tonight

3940
02:46:20,320 --> 02:46:22,320
TigerClaw talking about

3941
02:46:22,320 --> 02:46:24,320
Mad Catz readying an Android console

3942
02:46:24,320 --> 02:46:26,320
of their own. Is this like an Ouya

3943
02:46:26,320 --> 02:46:28,320
type response? No they are yeah

3944
02:46:28,320 --> 02:46:30,320
It's not like the Ouya

3945
02:46:30,320 --> 02:46:32,320
Actually I like the idea

3946
02:46:32,320 --> 02:46:34,320
a lot better than the Ouya

3947
02:46:34,320 --> 02:46:36,320
It's basically going to be a console that plays

3948
02:46:36,320 --> 02:46:38,320
Android games. It has the Google Play

3949
02:46:38,320 --> 02:46:40,320
Store and it plays any Android game

3950
02:46:40,320 --> 02:46:42,320
and you can actually map buttons

3951
02:46:42,320 --> 02:46:44,320
onto stuff

3952
02:46:44,320 --> 02:46:46,320
So games that don't support touch or whatever

3953
02:46:46,320 --> 02:46:48,320
you can use a mouse with them

3954
02:46:48,320 --> 02:46:50,320
or do support touch

3955
02:46:50,320 --> 02:46:52,320
you can use a mouse or you can use analog sticks

3956
02:46:52,320 --> 02:46:54,320
to emulate touch

3957
02:46:54,320 --> 02:46:56,320
but

3958
02:46:56,320 --> 02:46:58,320
the fact that it doesn't require any special

3959
02:46:58,320 --> 02:47:00,320
games it's just the games that you have

3960
02:47:00,320 --> 02:47:02,320
or the games that you buy for like a dollar

3961
02:47:02,320 --> 02:47:04,320
or free or whatever so I like that

3962
02:47:04,320 --> 02:47:06,320
and their controller looks nice too

3963
02:47:06,320 --> 02:47:08,320
it looks like an Xbox 360 controller

3964
02:47:08,320 --> 02:47:10,320
actually it looks exactly like their

3965
02:47:10,320 --> 02:47:12,320
their Xbox 360 controller

3966
02:47:12,320 --> 02:47:14,320
their

3967
02:47:14,320 --> 02:47:16,320
MLG controller

3968
02:47:16,320 --> 02:47:18,320
it looks exactly like that

3969
02:47:18,320 --> 02:47:20,320
and one other tweet from TigerClaw tonight about

3970
02:47:20,320 --> 02:47:22,320
Interplay getting an IP from THQ

3971
02:47:22,320 --> 02:47:24,320
for $7,500

3972
02:47:24,320 --> 02:47:26,320
that's how much they

3973
02:47:26,320 --> 02:47:28,320
paid for FreeSpace

3974
02:47:28,320 --> 02:47:30,320
that's a good deal

3975
02:47:30,320 --> 02:47:32,320
that's a great deal

3976
02:47:32,320 --> 02:47:34,320
Interstellar Combat series that was developed by

3977
02:47:34,320 --> 02:47:36,320
Volition and published by Interplay

3978
02:47:36,320 --> 02:47:38,320
it's back in Interplay's library

3979
02:47:38,320 --> 02:47:40,320
after getting it back from THQ

3980
02:47:40,320 --> 02:47:42,320
so there you go

3981
02:47:42,320 --> 02:47:44,320
Interplay by the way it should be noted

3982
02:47:44,320 --> 02:47:46,320
they never did lose the rights to sell

3983
02:47:46,320 --> 02:47:48,320
Descent FreeSpace and FreeSpace 2

3984
02:47:48,320 --> 02:47:50,320
there you go

3985
02:47:50,320 --> 02:47:52,320
I want another Descent that is awesome

3986
02:47:52,320 --> 02:47:54,320
that required more buttons than

3987
02:47:54,320 --> 02:47:56,320
the other Descent games

3988
02:47:56,320 --> 02:47:58,320
that would be awesome

3989
02:47:58,320 --> 02:48:00,320
that required telekinesis to play

3990
02:48:00,320 --> 02:48:02,320
alright well thank you guys very much for your tweets

3991
02:48:02,320 --> 02:48:04,320
at twitter.com slash o-l-r

3992
02:48:04,320 --> 02:48:06,320
lots of great stuff tonight but

3993
02:48:06,320 --> 02:48:08,320
it's about that time we gotta wrap up the show

3994
02:48:08,320 --> 02:48:10,320
and get everybody's final thought

3995
02:48:10,320 --> 02:48:12,320
and all that

3996
02:48:12,320 --> 02:48:14,320
we have a consensus in the chat room, Rival Schools is awesome

3997
02:48:14,320 --> 02:48:16,320
Rival Schools is awesome

3998
02:48:16,320 --> 02:48:18,320
we'll put that on your list list, too late

3999
02:48:18,320 --> 02:48:20,320
well, okay, you know what

4000
02:48:22,320 --> 02:48:24,320
I actually, when I had

4001
02:48:24,320 --> 02:48:26,320
a lot more disposable income I paid

4002
02:48:26,320 --> 02:48:28,320
99 bucks to import

4003
02:48:28,320 --> 02:48:30,320
the Justice Gakuen Evolution

4004
02:48:30,320 --> 02:48:32,320
and I played the hell out of it

4005
02:48:32,320 --> 02:48:34,320
for days, but it's like

4006
02:48:34,320 --> 02:48:36,320
every time they would bring out

4007
02:48:36,320 --> 02:48:38,320
like one of the games for home they'd take out

4008
02:48:38,320 --> 02:48:40,320
something from the Japanese version that made it awesome

4009
02:48:40,320 --> 02:48:42,320
like the board game mode

4010
02:48:42,320 --> 02:48:44,320
in Project Justice

4011
02:48:44,320 --> 02:48:46,320
after you played through the board game

4012
02:48:46,320 --> 02:48:48,320
your custom character

4013
02:48:48,320 --> 02:48:50,320
that you played the board game with would have stats

4014
02:48:50,320 --> 02:48:52,320
based on how you played the game

4015
02:48:52,320 --> 02:48:54,320
and they just took that out

4016
02:48:54,320 --> 02:48:56,320
well guys

4017
02:48:56,320 --> 02:48:58,320
before I let you go tonight I just want to say

4018
02:48:58,320 --> 02:49:00,320
happy three and let's hope that

4019
02:49:00,320 --> 02:49:02,320
let's hope the news isn't too terrible

4020
02:49:02,320 --> 02:49:04,320
let's hope there's a lot of good surprises and things

4021
02:49:04,320 --> 02:49:06,320
that we will be excited about

4022
02:49:06,320 --> 02:49:08,320
I will be here during the day tomorrow

4023
02:49:08,320 --> 02:49:10,320
during the press conferences and I'll be around Tuesday too

4024
02:49:10,320 --> 02:49:12,320
I will make a point to be in chat

4025
02:49:12,320 --> 02:49:14,320
if you want some folks to talk

4026
02:49:14,320 --> 02:49:16,320
about the conferences, you want a live

4027
02:49:16,320 --> 02:49:18,320
blog, not really live blogging

4028
02:49:18,320 --> 02:49:20,320
because I kind of think everybody's

4029
02:49:20,320 --> 02:49:22,320
kind of watching it, but more like live discussion

4030
02:49:22,320 --> 02:49:24,320
if you want to talk about what's going on

4031
02:49:24,320 --> 02:49:26,320
at E3 with some like-minded individuals

4032
02:49:26,320 --> 02:49:28,320
I urge you to be at live.vognetwork.com

4033
02:49:28,320 --> 02:49:30,320
I'll be there during the big press conferences

4034
02:49:30,320 --> 02:49:32,320
tomorrow and we can talk

4035
02:49:32,320 --> 02:49:34,320
about it and kind of discuss

4036
02:49:34,320 --> 02:49:36,320
are you going to be there too?

4037
02:49:36,320 --> 02:49:38,320
Yes, because my boss is gone

4038
02:49:38,320 --> 02:49:40,320
so I don't have to really work that

4039
02:49:40,320 --> 02:49:42,320
it's all work related anyways, come on

4040
02:49:42,320 --> 02:49:44,320
I'll be there at least for Microsoft and Sony

4041
02:49:44,320 --> 02:49:46,320
but in the middle of the day Dark Soccer and I might go on a friend date

4042
02:49:46,320 --> 02:49:48,320
to take care of some stuff around town

4043
02:49:48,320 --> 02:49:50,320
YYR left another haiku

4044
02:49:50,320 --> 02:49:52,320
Happy E3 guys, look forward to

4045
02:49:52,320 --> 02:49:54,320
no prices and no dates either

4046
02:49:54,320 --> 02:49:56,320
I think we'll get those tomorrow

4047
02:49:56,320 --> 02:49:58,320
I think we'll get prices and dates tomorrow

4048
02:49:58,320 --> 02:50:00,320
I don't know

4049
02:50:00,320 --> 02:50:02,320
It would be a first if we did, because remember

4050
02:50:02,320 --> 02:50:04,320
what was the infamous thing a few years ago from Sony

4051
02:50:04,320 --> 02:50:06,320
$599 US dollars

4052
02:50:06,320 --> 02:50:08,320
$599, so I think we will get it

4053
02:50:08,320 --> 02:50:10,320
I'll wake up tomorrow

4054
02:50:10,320 --> 02:50:12,320
to care about the press releases

4055
02:50:12,320 --> 02:50:14,320
to get in chat as well

4056
02:50:14,320 --> 02:50:16,320
I've already got my popcorn

4057
02:50:16,320 --> 02:50:18,320
it's just stale, but I already have my popcorn

4058
02:50:18,320 --> 02:50:20,320
I want to go to Popcornopolis

4059
02:50:20,320 --> 02:50:22,320
If you want a place to just chat with some other folks

4060
02:50:22,320 --> 02:50:24,320
and kind of just

4061
02:50:24,320 --> 02:50:26,320
get some live

4062
02:50:26,320 --> 02:50:28,320
banter going on what's going on at E3

4063
02:50:28,320 --> 02:50:30,320
join us and chat

4064
02:50:30,320 --> 02:50:32,320
live.vognetwork.com

4065
02:50:32,320 --> 02:50:34,320
You never know, Bobby might pop in on a plane for all we know

4066
02:50:34,320 --> 02:50:36,320
from his plane, we'll see

4067
02:50:36,320 --> 02:50:38,320
Check out E3.vognetwork.com

4068
02:50:38,320 --> 02:50:40,320
I'm really excited about what this week

4069
02:50:40,320 --> 02:50:42,320
is going to bring and it's going to be

4070
02:50:42,320 --> 02:50:44,320
a great week

4071
02:50:44,320 --> 02:50:46,320
I guess that's it

4072
02:50:46,320 --> 02:50:48,320
We'll be back next week to do it all over

4073
02:50:48,320 --> 02:50:50,320
again as we lead up to our 11th anniversary

4074
02:50:50,320 --> 02:50:52,320
on June 23rd

4075
02:50:52,320 --> 02:50:54,320
It's time to go around and get everybody's final thought

4076
02:50:54,320 --> 02:50:56,320
Dark Sakura, we'll start with you tonight

4077
02:50:56,320 --> 02:50:58,320
your final thought

4078
02:50:58,320 --> 02:51:00,320
I wish I hadn't eaten all that chocolate so quickly

4079
02:51:00,320 --> 02:51:02,320
And my final thought tonight

4080
02:51:02,320 --> 02:51:04,320
is no regrets, I did eat it that quickly

4081
02:51:04,320 --> 02:51:06,320
and it was good

4082
02:51:06,320 --> 02:51:08,320
Loki, your final thought tonight

4083
02:51:08,320 --> 02:51:10,320
I'm looking forward to this week, I'm always excited about

4084
02:51:10,320 --> 02:51:12,320
E3 stuff, just disappointed that I don't get to play

4085
02:51:12,320 --> 02:51:14,320
and also I'm not going to be able to make it out to Best Buy

4086
02:51:14,320 --> 02:51:16,320
and Wednesday to play the Wii U games

4087
02:51:16,320 --> 02:51:18,320
because it's not a weird time, it's like a 4 o'clock

4088
02:51:18,320 --> 02:51:20,320
like if it was in the middle of the day I could sneak out

4089
02:51:20,320 --> 02:51:22,320
and do that, but the middle of the day one's on

4090
02:51:22,320 --> 02:51:24,320
Saturday and I'm just, I'm not going to drive

4091
02:51:24,320 --> 02:51:26,320
all the way to Elk Grove

4092
02:51:26,320 --> 02:51:28,320
No, then I'm not going to drive down the Elk Grove

4093
02:51:28,320 --> 02:51:30,320
to play New Super League

4094
02:51:30,320 --> 02:51:32,320
What if our local listeners wanted to meet you?

4095
02:51:33,320 --> 02:51:35,320
Eh, it's not worth it, seriously

4096
02:51:35,320 --> 02:51:37,320
Alright, fair enough

4097
02:51:37,320 --> 02:51:39,320
Thank you guys for listening to

4098
02:51:39,320 --> 02:51:41,320
Orange Launch Radio and supporting us

4099
02:51:41,320 --> 02:51:43,320
for all these years

4100
02:51:43,320 --> 02:51:45,320
We really appreciate your support

4101
02:51:45,320 --> 02:51:47,320
It is a free show, all we ask if you enjoyed the show

4102
02:51:47,320 --> 02:51:49,320
Tell a friend or two about the show

4103
02:51:49,320 --> 02:51:51,320
Help us spread the word, because we don't get a big

4104
02:51:51,320 --> 02:51:53,320
booth at E3 to help spread the word

4105
02:51:53,320 --> 02:51:55,320
or any big fancy advertising budget

4106
02:51:55,320 --> 02:51:57,320
Any advertising you do see

4107
02:51:57,320 --> 02:51:59,320
comes out of our own pockets

4108
02:51:59,320 --> 02:52:01,320
So please, help spread the word

4109
02:52:01,320 --> 02:52:03,320
and grow our family here at Orange Lounge Radio

4110
02:52:03,320 --> 02:52:05,320
and the Voice of Geeks Network

4111
02:52:05,320 --> 02:52:07,320
Support independent podcasting

4112
02:52:07,320 --> 02:52:09,320
Have a terrific week, good night

4113
02:52:31,320 --> 02:52:33,320
You may not necessarily reflect

4114
