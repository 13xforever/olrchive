1
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:19,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight, June 2nd, 2013, One Country has a strong statement about the Xbox One.

2
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:25,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Blizzard postpones its next MMO, and could legendary buried game cartridges in the desert soon be unearthed?

3
00:00:31,874 --> 00:00:32,695
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura or Jamie Summers

4
00:00:52,987 --> 00:00:54,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we call this one a go-to-mix instead?

5
00:00:55,368 --> 00:00:56,408
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever you want it to be.

6
00:00:56,428 --> 00:00:58,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we have True Kiss Destination?

7
00:00:59,009 --> 00:00:59,289
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

8
00:00:59,689 --> 00:01:00,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Club Append!

9
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:02,009
[SPEAKER_11]: They weren't that good, let's be real.

10
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:04,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if their career didn't last that long.

11
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:06,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Dreams Come True lasted longer than them.

12
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:07,991
[SPEAKER_11]: Also say hello to Tech Master Loki.

13
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:08,511
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.

14
00:01:08,751 --> 00:01:09,511
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, how you doing, Loki?

15
00:01:09,671 --> 00:01:10,051
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty good.

16
00:01:10,271 --> 00:01:10,611
[SPEAKER_11]: Excellent.

17
00:01:10,811 --> 00:01:20,934
[SPEAKER_11]: And of course, my name is Rob Roberts, and we do join you live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

18
00:01:21,334 --> 00:01:22,855
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so last week was a little weird.

19
00:01:23,135 --> 00:01:24,976
[SPEAKER_11]: We weren't actually here live on Sunday.

20
00:01:25,336 --> 00:01:30,818
[SPEAKER_11]: We did a special show earlier in the week, which we called episode number 506, but then it was brought to my attention.

21
00:01:31,598 --> 00:01:38,721
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to ruin all the tracking of the classic game of the week and all these segments you usually do if you give a special episode a regular episode number.

22
00:01:39,302 --> 00:01:40,302
[SPEAKER_11]: So I broke it.

23
00:01:40,322 --> 00:01:42,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Just put a blank in there.

24
00:01:42,263 --> 00:01:44,044
[SPEAKER_07]: How damn hard is that?

25
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:44,764
[SPEAKER_11]: Give it a letter.

26
00:01:45,144 --> 00:01:45,804
[SPEAKER_11]: It's fine.

27
00:01:46,144 --> 00:01:48,105
[SPEAKER_11]: It's episode R. We'll just have 506.

28
00:01:48,185 --> 00:01:48,745
[SPEAKER_11]: Second mix.

29
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:51,587
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a do-over!

30
00:01:52,027 --> 00:01:52,748
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll do it live!

31
00:01:53,308 --> 00:01:56,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's not an episode unless I'm here, let's face it.

32
00:01:56,431 --> 00:01:58,252
[SPEAKER_11]: So episode two was not an episode?

33
00:01:59,273 --> 00:01:59,973
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it wasn't.

34
00:01:59,993 --> 00:02:02,855
[SPEAKER_03]: That was when I was sleeping in the Harry Potter room at the Gay Frat House.

35
00:02:04,376 --> 00:02:07,719
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so last week you were in Alabama, right?

36
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:08,079
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

37
00:02:08,279 --> 00:02:10,080
[SPEAKER_11]: And you were taking care of mostly some family stuff.

38
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:10,601
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

39
00:02:10,821 --> 00:02:15,224
[SPEAKER_11]: But you did get to hang out with, like, you met at least one OLR listener, right?

40
00:02:15,244 --> 00:02:15,324
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

41
00:02:15,632 --> 00:02:22,394
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to hang out with Jammer J, who I have known for quite some time, and there's a little bit of background.

42
00:02:22,414 --> 00:02:29,176
[SPEAKER_03]: About 10 years ago, we met up and played DDR together, and I got his games, and I think I got him dinner.

43
00:02:29,556 --> 00:02:36,898
[SPEAKER_03]: So this time he paid for my games and got me dinner, and took me to McGuire's in Pensacola, and I got shit-faced.

44
00:02:37,978 --> 00:02:45,021
[SPEAKER_03]: I drank, okay, Meguiar's is like a small microbrewery, and they do their own stouts and porters.

45
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:50,884
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a good porter, but then they served me this drink called an Irish Wake that's very green and served in a mason jar, and I consumed it.

46
00:02:51,384 --> 00:02:52,985
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was very dizzy the rest of the ride.

47
00:02:53,065 --> 00:03:02,050
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I got a sunburn in the shape, well, my tan line is in the shape of a seatbelt because we were riding in a convertible and I stopped caring about the sun.

48
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:02,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

49
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:12,233
[SPEAKER_03]: But we did go to Pace, Florida and play a lot of DDR and played some Addams Family Pinball at another arcade at the Pensacola Beach.

50
00:03:13,374 --> 00:03:21,657
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I spent some time with my mama's son and papa's son and their roommates Kristen and Bobby, a different Bobby, of course.

51
00:03:22,637 --> 00:03:25,158
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got to see Derek, who is one of my very good friends.

52
00:03:25,178 --> 00:03:26,939
[SPEAKER_11]: And all these people none of our listeners know.

53
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:27,579
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

54
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:31,901
[SPEAKER_03]: and my good friend Donovan who, they're both fixtures at DragonCon.

55
00:03:31,921 --> 00:03:32,701
[SPEAKER_03]: You may run into them.

56
00:03:32,761 --> 00:03:33,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, alright.

57
00:03:33,121 --> 00:03:34,702
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got to see my very good friend Jen.

58
00:03:34,742 --> 00:03:37,223
[SPEAKER_03]: She picked me up when my flight was changed from Gulfport to Mobile.

59
00:03:38,043 --> 00:03:40,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not get me started on American Airlines because fuck them.

60
00:03:40,884 --> 00:03:42,485
[SPEAKER_11]: I heard about your drama going.

61
00:03:42,945 --> 00:03:43,606
[SPEAKER_03]: No, fuck them.

62
00:03:43,826 --> 00:03:45,806
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm on an airplane tomorrow and you got me a little worried.

63
00:03:45,947 --> 00:03:46,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you doing American?

64
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:47,347
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

65
00:03:47,587 --> 00:03:48,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Good, fuck them.

66
00:03:49,588 --> 00:03:51,189
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

67
00:04:17,643 --> 00:04:19,383
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care if I can wear it or not.

68
00:04:19,604 --> 00:04:20,924
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a hot topic in Alabama?

69
00:04:22,384 --> 00:04:24,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we had Gadzooks, I think.

70
00:04:24,505 --> 00:04:28,926
[SPEAKER_03]: But at any rate, I bought a Charlie the Unicorn shirt at a Goodwill in Daphne, Alabama.

71
00:04:29,066 --> 00:04:29,286
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.

72
00:04:31,559 --> 00:04:32,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Shine the non-believer!

73
00:04:51,735 --> 00:04:55,377
[SPEAKER_11]: If you do get dumped from the stream, just click pause and play again.

74
00:04:55,497 --> 00:04:59,498
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're at live.vognetwork.com and it should reconnect right away as soon as we come back.

75
00:04:59,938 --> 00:05:01,359
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, I don't know what to do about it.

76
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:02,399
[SPEAKER_11]: The joys of live radio.

77
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:04,580
[SPEAKER_03]: I might have upset the cosmic balance by my sewing.

78
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,300
[SPEAKER_11]: Possibly.

79
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,540
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing matronly things.

80
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,001
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you sew the internet back together?

81
00:05:08,981 --> 00:05:09,241
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

82
00:05:09,522 --> 00:05:10,522
[SPEAKER_11]: Get a really big needle.

83
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,001
[SPEAKER_03]: I have really tiny needles.

84
00:05:13,721 --> 00:05:15,482
[SPEAKER_11]: And I keep poking myself in the thumb.

85
00:05:15,522 --> 00:05:16,402
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not gonna work.

86
00:05:16,642 --> 00:05:19,604
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so you missed our X-Bone special.

87
00:05:19,644 --> 00:05:21,285
[SPEAKER_11]: Excuse me, our XB1 special.

88
00:05:21,465 --> 00:05:22,765
[SPEAKER_11]: All the stuff about the Xbox One.

89
00:05:22,945 --> 00:05:24,586
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you hear anything about Xbox One?

90
00:05:25,006 --> 00:05:26,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and fuck all of it.

91
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:28,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Not getting it.

92
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:29,050
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

93
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,631
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, now, wait a minute, DarkSakura, and I think I said this on the show.

94
00:05:32,771 --> 00:05:34,791
[SPEAKER_11]: Isn't it too early to make up your mind on this?

95
00:05:35,212 --> 00:05:38,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, going by what I have, fuck them.

96
00:05:38,792 --> 00:05:39,933
[SPEAKER_11]: And why so strongly?

97
00:05:40,013 --> 00:05:40,633
[SPEAKER_11]: Why the F-bomb?

98
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:45,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I don't want to have a microphone and or a camera on all the damn time.

99
00:05:46,074 --> 00:05:48,034
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole used games thing, fuck them.

100
00:05:48,074 --> 00:05:49,935
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole downloading games, fuck them even more.

101
00:05:50,675 --> 00:05:53,135
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm going to download a game, it's going to be on my PC.

102
00:05:53,715 --> 00:05:55,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Where, you know, if I buy another PC...

103
00:05:56,676 --> 00:05:57,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess what?

104
00:05:57,136 --> 00:05:58,157
[SPEAKER_03]: My games will transfer.

105
00:05:58,437 --> 00:06:07,943
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, well, to be fair, to play devil's advocate, what's the difference between getting a digital copy on your PC that you can't sell back and a digital... Because I can upgrade my video card.

106
00:06:10,224 --> 00:06:14,227
[SPEAKER_03]: I can upgrade everything on my PC and make everything look amazing.

107
00:06:14,287 --> 00:06:19,170
[SPEAKER_11]: So, in a way, you're saying a PC is pretty much guaranteed to be backwards compatible, no matter what.

108
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much.

109
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:25,614
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I guess that's fair because the Xbox 360, anything you downloaded... I've been playing Loom.

110
00:06:28,133 --> 00:06:39,865
[SPEAKER_03]: If I can play Loom, thanks to Steam, if I can play all kinds of old PC games, if I can play text-based games, if I can play Oregon Trail on my PC, I have no problem.

111
00:06:41,685 --> 00:07:10,409
[SPEAKER_11]: um going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com or of course again we do tape live every Sunday night right after Bobby Blackwolf at 6 Pacific 9 Eastern on Sundays uh Gamer Girl says thank you Dark Sakura clap clap that's exactly why I don't want one either uh Koopa Kid Jeremy says I think it's too early to decide that it's not for you I kind of agree could anything but could anything at E3 end up swaying your mind that's what I'm curious about what if they come out and say the big rumor is Killer Instinct it's gonna be one of the games what if one of these 15 games is like OMG gotta have

112
00:07:10,549 --> 00:07:11,871
[SPEAKER_11]: What if there's a Homestuck game, Jamie?

113
00:07:11,951 --> 00:07:12,671
[SPEAKER_11]: What if there's a Homestuck game?

114
00:07:12,691 --> 00:07:17,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I know for a fact already that I don't think it's... Well, I think it's going to be PC anyway.

115
00:07:17,216 --> 00:07:21,982
[SPEAKER_11]: What if Mass Effect 4 is an Xbox One exclusive?

116
00:07:22,462 --> 00:07:22,943
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not.

117
00:07:23,724 --> 00:07:25,446
[SPEAKER_03]: It's already going to be running on PC.

118
00:07:25,506 --> 00:07:26,247
[SPEAKER_11]: What if, Jamie?

119
00:07:26,327 --> 00:07:26,727
[SPEAKER_11]: What if?

120
00:07:27,528 --> 00:07:29,991
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know that that would be enough because fuck EA.

121
00:07:30,011 --> 00:07:30,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

122
00:07:34,964 --> 00:07:36,565
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

123
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:57,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Time to change it!

124
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:22,170
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

125
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:48,840
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that for him it's going to be more of the next Gran Turismo game, of course it's just going to be PS3, but he's going to probably stick Sony.

126
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:54,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially if they say something that's going to counter all of the crap that Microsoft is saying.

127
00:08:55,144 --> 00:08:57,305
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's sort of a wait and see kind of thing.

128
00:08:58,206 --> 00:09:02,731
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well I'm going to check in with you again after E3 and see if anything that has happened may have changed your mind.

129
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:07,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and to tell Ragenator about Fuck Activision, I did quit WoW before I went to Alabama.

130
00:09:08,096 --> 00:09:10,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that everybody is reuniting in our guild.

131
00:09:10,599 --> 00:09:12,441
[SPEAKER_11]: Two people came back to WoW, Jamie.

132
00:09:12,521 --> 00:09:13,142
[SPEAKER_11]: Two people.

133
00:09:13,502 --> 00:09:14,363
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not everybody.

134
00:09:14,483 --> 00:09:19,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we better do like an old raid or something before my account expires.

135
00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:21,230
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought your account already expired.

136
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,811
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I've got a couple days left on it.

137
00:09:23,372 --> 00:09:24,372
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll find out when it expires.

138
00:09:24,573 --> 00:09:24,973
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

139
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,695
[SPEAKER_03]: And then let me do, like, Ice Crown Citadel.

140
00:09:27,715 --> 00:09:29,617
[SPEAKER_11]: You should go to Karazhan and get the pets.

141
00:09:30,597 --> 00:09:31,098
[SPEAKER_03]: I want pets.

142
00:09:31,118 --> 00:09:32,439
[SPEAKER_11]: There's new pets in Karazhan.

143
00:09:32,499 --> 00:09:33,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop it!

144
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,100
[SPEAKER_11]: Just saying.

145
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:34,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop it.

146
00:09:34,781 --> 00:09:35,661
[SPEAKER_03]: I stopped paying for it.

147
00:09:35,882 --> 00:09:36,822
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, crack.

148
00:09:36,942 --> 00:09:37,823
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, crack.

149
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:41,426
[SPEAKER_03]: I did delete the beta, so that did free up a lot of space.

150
00:09:41,486 --> 00:09:43,728
[SPEAKER_03]: But then I filled it up with, like, more games on Steam.

151
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:45,938
[SPEAKER_11]: Isn't that how it always goes?

152
00:09:46,058 --> 00:09:46,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

153
00:09:46,498 --> 00:09:48,939
[SPEAKER_11]: I just cleared off 100 gigs from my hard drive.

154
00:09:49,319 --> 00:09:50,480
[SPEAKER_11]: God damn it, Steam sale.

155
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,161
[SPEAKER_11]: God damn it, Humble Bundle.

156
00:09:52,241 --> 00:09:52,981
[SPEAKER_11]: God damn it.

157
00:09:53,401 --> 00:09:53,962
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is funny.

158
00:09:53,982 --> 00:09:55,563
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't have to install all of them.

159
00:09:55,643 --> 00:09:56,643
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't have them all installed.

160
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:57,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you do.

161
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:57,624
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a bunch.

162
00:09:57,744 --> 00:10:00,105
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually have the majority of them not installed.

163
00:10:00,145 --> 00:10:00,905
[SPEAKER_11]: How dare you?

164
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,966
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know when I might want to play.

165
00:10:03,247 --> 00:10:04,527
[SPEAKER_11]: You just never know.

166
00:10:05,148 --> 00:10:08,769
[SPEAKER_11]: And I can never uninstall something because the minute I uninstall it, what happens?

167
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:13,292
[SPEAKER_03]: And TigerClaw, Gran Turismo 6 has already been stated to be for PS3.

168
00:10:15,655 --> 00:10:39,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, anyhow Keep me strong, tie me to the mast I will hear the song but I shall not succumb This is my finger Well, I've got a needle in my hand This is my finger raised at Activision and Blizzard Sit and spin, motherfuckers Or pay for my account Oh boy Is there anything in gaming you do like this week?

169
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:41,884
[SPEAKER_03]: I started playing Mass Effect again

170
00:10:43,436 --> 00:10:44,377
[SPEAKER_03]: And guess what, Rob?

171
00:10:44,417 --> 00:10:46,298
[SPEAKER_11]: God, I just can't.

172
00:10:46,498 --> 00:10:48,719
[SPEAKER_07]: She won't get an Xbox One if it's Mass Effect 4.

173
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:49,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, exactly.

174
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:51,160
[SPEAKER_11]: It totally answers my earlier question.

175
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,401
[SPEAKER_11]: Totally answers my... Who is she?

176
00:10:52,461 --> 00:10:53,381
[SPEAKER_11]: Fucking kidding, right?

177
00:10:54,162 --> 00:10:54,882
[SPEAKER_11]: No!

178
00:10:55,002 --> 00:10:57,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I can resist playing another Mass Effect game.

179
00:10:57,343 --> 00:10:57,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope.

180
00:10:57,764 --> 00:10:58,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope.

181
00:10:58,164 --> 00:10:58,744
[SPEAKER_11]: LOL, nope.

182
00:10:58,944 --> 00:11:06,288
[SPEAKER_03]: The minute Garrus in HD... There will not be a Garrus in... They already said Mass Effect 4 is a different story.

183
00:11:06,468 --> 00:11:07,188
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, here we go.

184
00:11:07,248 --> 00:11:07,749
[SPEAKER_11]: Here we go, guys.

185
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:08,109
[SPEAKER_11]: Here we go.

186
00:11:08,249 --> 00:11:12,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, this is the first OLR comic strip I need somebody to draw, okay?

187
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:17,152
[SPEAKER_11]: You can bite my ass along with Activision and Blizzard and EA.

188
00:11:17,352 --> 00:11:17,733
[SPEAKER_11]: Here it is.

189
00:11:17,813 --> 00:11:18,153
[SPEAKER_11]: Here it is.

190
00:11:18,373 --> 00:11:23,955
[SPEAKER_11]: First panel, DarkSakura holding a microphone saying, I will not buy an Xbox One.

191
00:11:24,035 --> 00:11:24,535
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck them.

192
00:11:24,595 --> 00:11:26,016
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck them and their stupid asses.

193
00:11:26,616 --> 00:11:27,076
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

194
00:11:27,276 --> 00:11:27,716
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, ready?

195
00:11:27,956 --> 00:11:38,460
[SPEAKER_11]: Second panel is a picture of the E3 press conference where EA and Microsoft are holding hands on a stage saying, Mass Effect Garrus Edition, Xbox One exclusive.

196
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:44,601
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the third panel is DarkSakura walking into a Best Buy with a balloon that says, LOL, nope.

197
00:11:47,162 --> 00:11:47,662
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably.

198
00:11:47,962 --> 00:11:48,803
[SPEAKER_11]: LOL, nope.

199
00:11:49,203 --> 00:11:49,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, okay, okay.

200
00:11:50,223 --> 00:11:56,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, first of all, I'm fairly certain that with a franchise like that, they will not make it an exclusive.

201
00:11:57,212 --> 00:12:07,318
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm only saying this to get you ruffled and it's working you know what you are about to earn yourself the mother of all girl

202
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Just saying.

203
00:12:11,362 --> 00:12:17,488
[SPEAKER_03]: And... Okay, this is... To go ahead and put the blanket thing out there, yes, I will get Mass Effect 4.

204
00:12:18,288 --> 00:12:19,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I love the universe.

205
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,411
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care how shitty the story is.

206
00:12:21,831 --> 00:12:23,213
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care how sparkly the turd is.

207
00:12:23,293 --> 00:12:23,873
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the turd.

208
00:12:25,154 --> 00:12:26,235
[SPEAKER_03]: I will buy the sparkly turd.

209
00:12:27,557 --> 00:12:28,718
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I am a fangirl.

210
00:12:28,778 --> 00:12:30,799
[SPEAKER_11]: There's her little quote for the next show intro.

211
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:31,680
[SPEAKER_11]: I love the turd.

212
00:12:34,202 --> 00:12:34,483
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

213
00:12:35,183 --> 00:12:35,704
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

214
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,100
[SPEAKER_03]: I have pointy things.

215
00:12:39,781 --> 00:12:41,142
[SPEAKER_03]: You see all these little pins?

216
00:13:07,322 --> 00:13:10,044
[SPEAKER_11]: answering your questions as you direct him on the show floor.

217
00:13:10,084 --> 00:13:14,087
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all explained for you at e3.vognetwork.com.

218
00:13:14,567 --> 00:13:15,187
[SPEAKER_11]: Check it out.

219
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:20,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's get into how was your gaming week and we'll talk about the types of video games you've been playing this week.

220
00:13:20,851 --> 00:13:22,092
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, why don't you start us off?

221
00:13:22,232 --> 00:13:23,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Lol, Mass Effect.

222
00:13:23,633 --> 00:13:24,073
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course.

223
00:13:24,194 --> 00:13:24,594
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.

224
00:13:24,654 --> 00:13:25,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess what?

225
00:13:25,214 --> 00:13:29,057
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought Dramamine so that I can do the makeup missions.

226
00:13:29,137 --> 00:13:29,937
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I'm awful.

227
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:33,280
[SPEAKER_03]: I have ginger pills and Dramamine.

228
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:36,711
[SPEAKER_11]: You bought drugs so you can play Mass Effect.

229
00:13:36,871 --> 00:13:37,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

230
00:13:38,632 --> 00:13:47,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Because last time I played... Okay, last time I had a nice two-hour session of getting side missions out of the way, and I literally had to stop playing after... Stop it.

231
00:13:47,699 --> 00:13:49,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not YouTube me, Rob.

232
00:13:51,141 --> 00:13:51,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob!

233
00:13:51,782 --> 00:13:53,783
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you ever played... Don't watch what I'm doing over here.

234
00:13:54,043 --> 00:13:54,584
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep talking.

235
00:13:55,012 --> 00:14:07,402
[SPEAKER_03]: So I decided that I didn't want to get motion sick again, so I have plenty of things to keep me from getting sick to my stomach.

236
00:14:07,502 --> 00:14:10,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully, just because I get super motion sick, I'll make omissions.

237
00:14:12,046 --> 00:14:19,252
[SPEAKER_03]: I also downloaded a bunch of high-res, it's called the Ultimate High-Res Mod or something, for...

238
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:47,494
[SPEAKER_03]: For the first Mass Effect That has made my game look absolutely freaking gorgeous Like, pretty And so I have been I'm still on the stupid first mission Right after Dumbass gets shot Which we all know who Dumbass is Jenkins, sorry So I am right after that part in my game And it kind of doesn't like all the mods But I don't care Because it makes my game pretty And I play DDR

239
00:14:48,474 --> 00:14:52,417
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, to clarify, you bought drugs so you could play a drug?

240
00:14:52,917 --> 00:14:53,278
[SPEAKER_00]: No!

241
00:14:54,638 --> 00:14:55,599
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the gender on it.

242
00:14:55,639 --> 00:15:04,445
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever played Mass Effect?

243
00:15:05,266 --> 00:15:05,466
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

244
00:15:08,628 --> 00:15:12,931
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the record, anyone who's a fan of the first Mass Effect that is interested in this mod, talk to me.

245
00:15:15,473 --> 00:15:22,027
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I played a lot of DVR, my calves hurt for the next two days, and my skin did.

246
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:22,788
[SPEAKER_03]: You gotta stretch.

247
00:15:22,808 --> 00:15:23,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, I stretched.

248
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,393
[SPEAKER_03]: I was freaking doing yoga in an arcade, okay?

249
00:15:26,621 --> 00:15:37,546
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was very fun, and so if you go to the one and only DDR machine in all of Pace, Florida, and you see D. Sakura Explanation Point, that is me.

250
00:15:38,466 --> 00:15:39,327
[SPEAKER_03]: On two whole songs.

251
00:15:40,727 --> 00:15:40,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Two.

252
00:15:41,227 --> 00:15:41,828
[SPEAKER_03]: And I passed Superstar.

253
00:15:41,848 --> 00:15:43,148
[SPEAKER_11]: Until they reset the leaderboard at night.

254
00:15:43,168 --> 00:15:43,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

255
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:49,051
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was feeling old, so I passed Superstar, and it made me good.

256
00:15:49,671 --> 00:15:50,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Congrats.

257
00:15:51,972 --> 00:15:59,321
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I... Oh yeah, I also played a lot of Midway Arcade for tickets on my iPad.

258
00:15:59,981 --> 00:16:03,503
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, oh, I was like, like the classic midway games like Joust and stuff.

259
00:16:03,523 --> 00:16:05,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, yeah, but I was playing pool.

260
00:16:05,424 --> 00:16:08,626
[SPEAKER_03]: I could not stop playing stupid pool.

261
00:16:08,686 --> 00:16:10,947
[SPEAKER_11]: If you just want tickets in that game, just play the skee-ball.

262
00:16:11,087 --> 00:16:14,829
[SPEAKER_11]: You can just, you just go like this, fling, fling, fling, fling, fling, fling, fling, tickets, fling, fling, fling, fling, fling.

263
00:16:14,909 --> 00:16:17,470
[SPEAKER_03]: You play one game of pool and you get 200 points.

264
00:16:17,611 --> 00:16:19,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if you scratch it on your first one, you still get 75 points.

265
00:16:19,872 --> 00:16:20,852
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't know that.

266
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:21,833
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

267
00:16:22,573 --> 00:16:25,015
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I was like, pool, pool.

268
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,176
[SPEAKER_03]: I was so mind-numbingly bored.

269
00:16:27,856 --> 00:16:28,476
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

270
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:55,551
[SPEAKER_03]: When I laid down on my grandmother's bed, for a moment I was like, oh, the bed's kind of crooked.

271
00:16:55,651 --> 00:16:56,611
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it was daylight.

272
00:16:57,751 --> 00:17:00,392
[SPEAKER_03]: So my time completely reset while I was there.

273
00:17:01,832 --> 00:17:06,253
[SPEAKER_03]: But still my night owl thing was like, it's 8 o'clock and I'm not out doing stuff.

274
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:07,533
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not me.

275
00:17:08,134 --> 00:17:09,734
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was very bizarre.

276
00:17:10,034 --> 00:17:13,015
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I played a lot of Midware Kid and Blazing Star.

277
00:17:14,195 --> 00:17:17,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I have Blazing Star on my iPad and that game is awesome.

278
00:17:19,276 --> 00:17:19,556
[SPEAKER_03]: The end.

279
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:20,438
[SPEAKER_11]: The end.

280
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:21,619
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, how about you?

281
00:17:23,261 --> 00:17:23,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

282
00:17:23,682 --> 00:17:29,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this week I played more Saints Row the Third, just trying to finish up my last few achievements on there.

283
00:17:30,631 --> 00:17:33,054
[SPEAKER_07]: And then also played...

284
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,980
[SPEAKER_07]: A bit of track mania.

285
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,061
[SPEAKER_07]: We tried to do VOG Gaming Night on that.

286
00:17:39,081 --> 00:17:41,622
[SPEAKER_07]: It was weird because I did everything correctly.

287
00:17:43,142 --> 00:17:44,502
[SPEAKER_07]: One person was able to join my game.

288
00:17:44,602 --> 00:17:46,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody else was not able to join my game.

289
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:49,183
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we decided, hey, let's play on a third-party server.

290
00:17:49,263 --> 00:17:52,604
[SPEAKER_07]: So we just picked a server at random that we were able to connect to.

291
00:17:53,524 --> 00:17:57,605
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it just had the weirdest fucking tracks ever.

292
00:17:57,665 --> 00:18:00,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Just these giant maze tracks everywhere.

293
00:18:00,686 --> 00:18:03,047
[SPEAKER_07]: that were impossible to figure out where the hell you were supposed to go.

294
00:18:04,187 --> 00:18:07,729
[SPEAKER_07]: It was ridiculous, but we had a little bit of fun.

295
00:18:09,069 --> 00:18:20,033
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I played a little bit of Cave Story Plus and a very little bit of Call of Duty because everyone was flaking the entire week.

296
00:18:21,654 --> 00:18:22,294
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty much it.

297
00:18:23,674 --> 00:18:24,255
[SPEAKER_11]: My gaming week.

298
00:18:25,155 --> 00:18:34,817
[SPEAKER_11]: Over the Memorial Day weekend, I was staying with Captain Spike and Tim, who were on a previous episode a few weeks ago at their Memorial Day soiree.

299
00:18:34,857 --> 00:18:35,837
[SPEAKER_11]: We played a few video games.

300
00:18:35,917 --> 00:18:44,739
[SPEAKER_11]: I watched them play Trivial Pursuit on the Xbox, which was kind of frustrating how long that game was going on because it's Trivial Pursuit and LOL.

301
00:18:45,499 --> 00:19:11,186
[SPEAKER_11]: and uh we went out to GameStop one day randomly to go find a cheap game to play and we ended up buying Wheel of Fortune I should say Spike ended up buying Wheel of Fortune on the Xbox 360 and many lulls ensued uh what can I say about it I'm like you you know exactly what you're gonna get with a game like Wheel of Fortune because you've seen the game show at some point in your life yes although I have to admit the characters are a little bit derpy and some of the unlocks are a

302
00:19:12,426 --> 00:19:12,826
[SPEAKER_11]: For $20, hey!

303
00:19:14,348 --> 00:19:22,196
[SPEAKER_11]: It provided a little bit of entertainment and some really, really hilarious instances where we were solving puzzles incorrectly and throwing each other off and so forth.

304
00:19:22,556 --> 00:19:23,197
[SPEAKER_11]: So that was fun.

305
00:19:23,957 --> 00:19:26,860
[SPEAKER_11]: As far as other stuff I've been playing during the week, I was keeping it retro.

306
00:19:27,441 --> 00:19:35,829
[SPEAKER_11]: And thanks to some conversations I was having on Twitter with not just Spike, but Jeremy from Koopa Club and some of the other people I talk with on Twitter...

307
00:19:36,269 --> 00:19:44,254
[SPEAKER_11]: I was reminded that Mario 2 came out on Virtual Console for Wii U and I was like, oh, I had that on the Wii so I should just spend the dollar or whatever to upgrade it and play it.

308
00:19:44,614 --> 00:19:47,336
[SPEAKER_11]: And not only did I play it, I played it from start to finish.

309
00:19:47,977 --> 00:19:54,841
[SPEAKER_11]: Granted, I cheated and I used warps, but I used only Luigi the whole way through the game.

310
00:19:54,941 --> 00:19:59,564
[SPEAKER_11]: In my nod to Year of Luigi, I beat Mario 2 using only Luigi.

311
00:19:59,584 --> 00:20:03,507
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm going to tell you what, those ice stages that you have to play even when you warp,

312
00:20:04,367 --> 00:20:05,488
[SPEAKER_11]: Suck with Luigi.

313
00:20:05,588 --> 00:20:06,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they do.

314
00:20:06,768 --> 00:20:11,670
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I'm used to using the princess to just float through those little, you know, not the shy guys.

315
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,190
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you call the flying ones with the pitchfork?

316
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:13,811
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't remember their names.

317
00:20:13,831 --> 00:20:14,111
[SPEAKER_03]: The flurries?

318
00:20:14,331 --> 00:20:16,192
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the flurries are the guys on the ground.

319
00:20:16,232 --> 00:20:18,392
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, the little dudes on the ground that look like little jigglypuffs.

320
00:20:18,412 --> 00:20:19,873
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember what they're called.

321
00:20:19,893 --> 00:20:20,733
[SPEAKER_03]: I call them bastards.

322
00:20:20,913 --> 00:20:22,334
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they're little fuckers.

323
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:25,315
[SPEAKER_11]: So the little fuckers are flying in the air and the princess is easy.

324
00:20:25,355 --> 00:20:26,496
[SPEAKER_11]: You just float in between them.

325
00:20:26,876 --> 00:20:29,077
[SPEAKER_11]: But not so easy when you're Luigi.

326
00:20:29,117 --> 00:20:29,577
[SPEAKER_11]: But I did it.

327
00:20:30,317 --> 00:20:30,657
[SPEAKER_11]: I did it.

328
00:20:31,217 --> 00:20:31,798
[SPEAKER_11]: And I beat the game.

329
00:20:31,818 --> 00:20:32,298
[SPEAKER_11]: And that was fun.

330
00:20:33,118 --> 00:20:34,799
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, I was keeping it retro this week.

331
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:46,809
[SPEAKER_11]: I gotta say, there's something about Wii U Virtual Console and I'm totally having to eat my words from what I said earlier on this program about a year ago when I was like, Wii U Virtual Console is gonna be stupid and why would I pay money to upgrade and da-da-da.

332
00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:49,831
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just a better experience and I can't put my finger on it.

333
00:20:50,152 --> 00:20:55,236
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if it's the HDMI, I don't know if it's the sound from the tablet and the sound from the speakers at the same time.

334
00:20:55,636 --> 00:20:57,718
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, but it is a better experience.

335
00:20:57,938 --> 00:20:59,099
[SPEAKER_11]: So, oops, I was wrong.

336
00:21:00,339 --> 00:21:00,860
[SPEAKER_11]: It happens.

337
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,242
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, I was having fun with Mario 2 on Virtual Console.

338
00:21:04,302 --> 00:21:07,464
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I was playing Warcraft because, you know, I'm addicted.

339
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:12,026
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I hit 90 with my Hunter, my Blood Elf Hunter, my PvP character.

340
00:21:12,046 --> 00:21:13,507
[SPEAKER_11]: So I've been playing more PvP.

341
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:16,229
[SPEAKER_03]: If you get sassy to 90... Sassy is 87.

342
00:21:16,369 --> 00:21:17,650
[SPEAKER_11]: In a row?

343
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:18,350
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

344
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:23,373
[SPEAKER_03]: When you get sassy to 90, I will redo, I will re-up WoW for one month.

345
00:21:24,774 --> 00:21:25,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to play with sassy.

346
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:27,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I like the braids.

347
00:21:27,355 --> 00:21:27,596
[SPEAKER_03]: They float.

348
00:21:27,696 --> 00:21:28,116
[SPEAKER_03]: They float.

349
00:21:29,135 --> 00:21:33,479
[SPEAKER_11]: Jeremy is coaching me in chat, I guess, saying, you warped.

350
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,840
[SPEAKER_11]: I said I warped.

351
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:41,707
[SPEAKER_11]: My next goal is to do it without warping, but unfortunately I'm on a work trip this week, and then I have all the E3 stuff.

352
00:21:41,907 --> 00:21:43,728
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I'm not going to E3, but there's other stuff going on.

353
00:21:44,609 --> 00:21:54,178
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's going to be a little while before I can get through the game without warping, but that's on the list, except for the fact that Animal Crossing comes out Sunday, and then the list will be shot, because yay, Animal Crossing.

354
00:21:55,879 --> 00:21:56,140
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

355
00:21:57,183 --> 00:22:00,012
[SPEAKER_07]: It actually comes out on Friday.

356
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:01,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it is Sunday.

357
00:22:01,456 --> 00:22:03,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Last of Us is coming out on Friday.

358
00:22:03,897 --> 00:22:04,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, is it this Friday?

359
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:07,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, next Friday.

360
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, the E3 Friday?

361
00:22:09,481 --> 00:22:09,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

362
00:22:10,982 --> 00:22:11,543
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why.

363
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:12,283
[SPEAKER_11]: Interesting.

364
00:22:12,544 --> 00:22:14,925
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I mean, if no other big games are coming out, then why not?

365
00:22:15,246 --> 00:22:17,808
[SPEAKER_11]: Most of America doesn't go to E3, so it doesn't really matter.

366
00:22:17,988 --> 00:22:18,968
[SPEAKER_11]: Why Friday, Street Day?

367
00:22:18,988 --> 00:22:20,029
[SPEAKER_11]: Just put it out on Tuesday.

368
00:22:20,069 --> 00:22:20,470
[SPEAKER_11]: Why not?

369
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:21,871
[SPEAKER_11]: Just in time for the weekend.

370
00:22:22,191 --> 00:22:24,413
[SPEAKER_11]: Why do movies sometimes open on Wednesday?

371
00:22:24,673 --> 00:22:25,613
[SPEAKER_11]: They just, they do.

372
00:22:26,194 --> 00:22:26,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob?

373
00:22:26,634 --> 00:22:26,854
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

374
00:22:27,335 --> 00:22:28,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you sometimes just wonder why?

375
00:22:29,116 --> 00:22:30,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you ever feel not so fresh?

376
00:22:30,297 --> 00:22:31,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

377
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:35,214
[SPEAKER_11]: First of all, I am incredibly crescent fresh.

378
00:22:35,694 --> 00:22:37,716
[SPEAKER_11]: And second of all, the answer to why?

379
00:22:38,437 --> 00:22:38,937
[SPEAKER_11]: Because.

380
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:42,840
[SPEAKER_11]: And then deal with it.

381
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,461
[SPEAKER_03]: See if that works with a six-year-old, by the way.

382
00:22:44,481 --> 00:22:45,442
[SPEAKER_11]: With the floating sunglasses.

383
00:22:45,943 --> 00:22:49,866
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you tell the child to deal with it and then have sunglasses land on your face?

384
00:22:49,886 --> 00:22:51,267
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but I'm going to do that next time.

385
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:51,507
[SPEAKER_03]: You should.

386
00:22:51,547 --> 00:22:53,429
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be hilarious to see Julian's reaction.

387
00:22:55,563 --> 00:22:56,544
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, housekeeping.

388
00:22:57,665 --> 00:22:59,648
[SPEAKER_11]: Visit our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

389
00:22:59,668 --> 00:23:03,592
[SPEAKER_11]: And we are on Facebook as well, facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio and on the Google+.

390
00:23:04,093 --> 00:23:12,262
[SPEAKER_11]: And of course, you want to visit our network, vognetwork.com, home to lots of great geeky podcasts and geeky content, including video game reviews.

391
00:23:12,982 --> 00:23:15,886
[SPEAKER_11]: I know Actdeft just reviewed Dust and Elysian Tale.

392
00:23:16,746 --> 00:23:19,587
[SPEAKER_11]: was on the site this week.

393
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:23,209
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, of course, as I mentioned before, lots of exciting stuff going on for E3.

394
00:23:23,249 --> 00:23:25,970
[SPEAKER_11]: So check out e3.vognetwork.com.

395
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,831
[SPEAKER_11]: We will be the second site that you check.

396
00:23:27,891 --> 00:23:28,251
[SPEAKER_11]: Not the first.

397
00:23:28,271 --> 00:23:28,911
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll be the second.

398
00:23:29,311 --> 00:23:29,871
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's okay.

399
00:23:30,172 --> 00:23:30,912
[SPEAKER_11]: We're number two.

400
00:23:31,532 --> 00:23:32,552
[SPEAKER_11]: Silver medal for VOG.

401
00:23:33,433 --> 00:23:33,813
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll be great.

402
00:23:34,295 --> 00:23:36,678
[SPEAKER_11]: Xbox One, Xbox One, Xbox One, Xbox One

403
00:23:51,094 --> 00:23:55,917
[SPEAKER_07]: 1 billion dollars into putting games on the Xbox One.

404
00:23:56,497 --> 00:24:04,161
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm assuming a lot of that has to do with the 15 exclusives that they, I guess, paid for and will be coming out the first year.

405
00:24:06,222 --> 00:24:14,467
[SPEAKER_07]: And then didn't really hint at a whole lot of what's coming other than, you know, we know there's a Rare game coming and apparently Black Tusk Studios is working on something.

406
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:16,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

407
00:24:19,135 --> 00:24:21,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Microsoft Studios is obviously working on stuff.

408
00:24:21,939 --> 00:24:23,500
[SPEAKER_07]: We know that there's going to be a new Forza.

409
00:24:23,941 --> 00:24:27,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Remedy's got that Quantum Break game and EA's got some stuff.

410
00:24:27,745 --> 00:24:32,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Not necessarily exclusive, but features that are somewhat exclusive, I guess.

411
00:24:33,031 --> 00:24:35,874
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

412
00:24:35,915 --> 00:24:37,636
[SPEAKER_07]: They're spending quite a bit of money on that stuff.

413
00:24:38,777 --> 00:25:06,376
[SPEAKER_07]: uh of course you know we're gonna have to figure out what that is and um you know maybe one of these announcements has to do with a bunch of these you know domains that they're registering including domains pertaining to a title called Halo Spartan Assault which doesn't sound like a you know it almost sounds like an arcade game or something like a spin-off so I guess we'll have to wait and see could it be maybe an upgrade or something

414
00:25:07,364 --> 00:25:08,625
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm hoping it's not that.

415
00:25:08,985 --> 00:25:15,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember, wasn't there supposed to be like a Kinect-powered game or something like that?

416
00:25:16,071 --> 00:25:18,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember, they were doing that with Gears of War, I remember.

417
00:25:18,933 --> 00:25:21,315
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it's like a Kinect Halo game or something?

418
00:25:23,477 --> 00:25:23,817
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

419
00:25:23,937 --> 00:25:26,959
[SPEAKER_11]: Joy, I can flail around and choose weapons.

420
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,902
[SPEAKER_11]: Didn't one of the Halo games, like ODST or something, incorporate Kinect?

421
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:33,175
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, well... Like you could shout grenade and it would throw a grenade?

422
00:25:33,195 --> 00:25:36,116
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that was the Halo Combat Evolved HD thing.

423
00:25:36,216 --> 00:25:37,077
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, that one.

424
00:25:37,877 --> 00:25:39,398
[SPEAKER_07]: The Combat Evolved Anniversary.

425
00:25:39,658 --> 00:25:41,659
[SPEAKER_07]: They had where you can shout grenade.

426
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:42,640
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a lot of Halo games.

427
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,341
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, can you shout grenade faster than you can press a button?

428
00:25:45,542 --> 00:25:45,642
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

429
00:25:45,722 --> 00:25:46,842
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you cannot.

430
00:25:47,783 --> 00:25:51,085
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's assuming that the Kinect hears you and understands what you ask for.

431
00:25:51,165 --> 00:25:54,307
[SPEAKER_11]: It would only be useful as if what you're yelling is, how do I throw a grenade?

432
00:25:54,327 --> 00:25:56,148
[SPEAKER_11]: And it just does it.

433
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:57,428
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh hey, it worked!

434
00:25:57,729 --> 00:25:58,469
[SPEAKER_11]: How do I throw a grenade?

435
00:25:59,963 --> 00:26:01,825
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

436
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:23,485
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, anyway, the German Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information.

437
00:26:23,845 --> 00:26:28,109
[SPEAKER_11]: I did not know such a position existed in Germany, but I guess it makes sense.

438
00:26:28,189 --> 00:26:35,216
[SPEAKER_11]: Certainly, you want to make sure that everything is regulated when it comes to those exchanges, but to a fault.

439
00:26:36,318 --> 00:26:41,302
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyhow, he calls it the Xbox One Connect, a monitoring device.

440
00:26:41,723 --> 00:26:42,324
[SPEAKER_11]: That's because it is.

441
00:26:43,004 --> 00:26:43,344
[SPEAKER_11]: It is.

442
00:26:44,024 --> 00:26:54,366
[SPEAKER_11]: And he goes on to say, under the heading Game Device, this is through a translation that he mentioned with the website Spiegel.de, but this is through a translation.

443
00:26:54,386 --> 00:26:54,706
[SPEAKER_11]: Spiegel.

444
00:26:55,226 --> 00:26:59,887
[SPEAKER_11]: Under the heading Game Device, Microsoft pushes a monitoring device in the market.

445
00:27:00,267 --> 00:27:04,128
[SPEAKER_11]: The Xbox continuously records all sorts of personal information about me.

446
00:27:04,508 --> 00:27:12,009
[SPEAKER_11]: Reaction rates, my learning or emotional states, these are then processed on an external server and possibly even passed on to third parties.

447
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:15,786
[SPEAKER_11]: Whether they will ever be deleted, the person cannot influence

448
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:17,926
[SPEAKER_07]: It absolutely is.

449
00:27:18,066 --> 00:27:19,046
[SPEAKER_07]: It's what it is.

450
00:27:19,666 --> 00:27:21,387
[SPEAKER_07]: It's marketing metrics is what it is.

451
00:27:21,648 --> 00:27:25,029
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to be listening to stuff that you're talking about.

452
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:27,051
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're going to advertise to you.

453
00:27:27,071 --> 00:27:28,311
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to target advertising.

454
00:27:28,752 --> 00:27:31,973
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just like on Facebook where they try to target advertising.

455
00:27:32,113 --> 00:27:36,656
[SPEAKER_07]: But they're going to also make sure that, hey, are you paying attention to those ads?

456
00:27:37,136 --> 00:27:39,177
[SPEAKER_07]: What ads are interesting you?

457
00:27:39,217 --> 00:27:39,798
[SPEAKER_07]: That kind of stuff.

458
00:27:39,838 --> 00:27:41,239
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're going into greater detail.

459
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:43,480
[SPEAKER_07]: And that information is worth a ton.

460
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,180
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

461
00:28:05,485 --> 00:28:06,987
[SPEAKER_11]: Microsoft is a leader in the world of privacy.

462
00:28:23,727 --> 00:28:26,329
[SPEAKER_11]: We aren't using Kinect to snoop on anybody at all.

463
00:28:26,649 --> 00:28:40,338
[SPEAKER_11]: We listen for the word Xbox on, then switch on the machine, but we don't transmit personal data in any way, shape, or form that could be personally identifiable to you unless you explicitly opt into that.

464
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:43,419
[SPEAKER_11]: What's interesting about that is that basically he's saying it is there.

465
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,881
[SPEAKER_11]: You just have to opt into it, right?

466
00:28:46,101 --> 00:28:49,623
[SPEAKER_07]: And I remember their excuse was, well, but you can turn the console off.

467
00:28:49,783 --> 00:28:52,585
[SPEAKER_07]: You can power the console off and unplug it.

468
00:28:53,703 --> 00:28:54,284
[SPEAKER_03]: That's stupid.

469
00:28:54,444 --> 00:28:57,606
[SPEAKER_11]: So it sounds to me like Microsoft is going to have to really clarify this.

470
00:28:57,646 --> 00:28:59,368
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's a valid concern about this.

471
00:28:59,408 --> 00:29:06,073
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, when I got into this last week is that I don't want no Xbox filming me when I'm running around in my underwear trying to get coffee in the morning or whatever.

472
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:07,374
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I don't need that.

473
00:29:07,594 --> 00:29:08,535
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, who knows?

474
00:29:08,875 --> 00:29:16,041
[SPEAKER_11]: Who knows what might be said when I yell to Alan in the other room and suddenly I'm calling DarkSakura on Kinect and things are awkward.

475
00:29:16,481 --> 00:29:17,162
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?

476
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:22,106
[SPEAKER_07]: All I got to say is you're going to be getting a lot of targeted Pinkberry advertisements.

477
00:29:22,246 --> 00:29:22,326
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

478
00:29:23,843 --> 00:29:24,784
[SPEAKER_03]: and Keurig.

479
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:27,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Pinkberry and Keurig.

480
00:29:28,746 --> 00:29:31,027
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be there with you except for the Keurig part.

481
00:29:31,067 --> 00:29:32,928
[SPEAKER_03]: You said to buy enough of it.

482
00:29:34,009 --> 00:29:38,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Just saying if I ever get the console I'm just talking about pornography whenever I'm in front of it.

483
00:29:38,682 --> 00:29:44,868
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's what I was thinking about, though, with the Xbox One, is that if I get one, which, you know, I'm still on the fence.

484
00:29:44,988 --> 00:29:52,055
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't feel as strongly as Jamie does, what she said earlier in the show, but I kind of have very similar concerns to what she already said.

485
00:29:52,515 --> 00:29:56,379
[SPEAKER_07]: To me, it's very similar to how I felt with the Wii U. It's like, okay, that's cool.

486
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Do I feel like buying one right now?

487
00:29:58,621 --> 00:29:59,682
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I don't feel like buying one.

488
00:30:02,725 --> 00:30:03,285
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?

489
00:30:03,345 --> 00:30:10,468
[SPEAKER_11]: And if I wanted to cover the little camera on the little device, or I can just flip it to the wall or whatever, and it still works just fine.

490
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,889
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, no worries, right?

491
00:30:13,129 --> 00:30:18,651
[SPEAKER_11]: So here's my thing is that I think Microsoft needs to clarify some of this, and I think they will.

492
00:30:19,131 --> 00:30:24,753
[SPEAKER_11]: But in a way, if it's just left at what Phil Harrison is saying, he's basically saying, what?

493
00:30:25,094 --> 00:30:26,054
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't you trust us?

494
00:30:26,494 --> 00:30:28,155
[SPEAKER_11]: We're a leader in privacy information.

495
00:30:28,215 --> 00:30:28,935
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't you trust us?

496
00:30:28,955 --> 00:30:29,556
[SPEAKER_11]: What are you talking about?

497
00:30:29,576 --> 00:30:30,656
[SPEAKER_11]: No one got hacked before.

498
00:30:31,237 --> 00:30:32,237
[SPEAKER_11]: Money wasn't stolen.

499
00:30:32,477 --> 00:30:33,458
[SPEAKER_11]: Fact, guys.

500
00:30:33,738 --> 00:30:34,098
[SPEAKER_11]: Fact.

501
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:42,363
[SPEAKER_11]: You want me to trust a company that, fact, sold a bunch of broken Xboxes that would break after several days of use.

502
00:30:43,304 --> 00:30:46,185
[SPEAKER_11]: My Xbox 360 Red Ring two days after I bought it.

503
00:30:46,225 --> 00:30:47,106
[SPEAKER_11]: That is a fact.

504
00:30:47,686 --> 00:31:06,424
[SPEAKER_11]: fact I had money stolen from my Xbox Live account by a hacker and to this day Microsoft will not acknowledge that there was a breach and instead they deflect blame on the user that is a fact and you want me to trust you you need to be a little bit more transparent with what's going on that's the reality

505
00:31:08,286 --> 00:31:11,727
[SPEAKER_11]: And if I want to turn that fucker off, then I should be able to turn it off.

506
00:31:12,347 --> 00:31:12,808
[SPEAKER_11]: Period.

507
00:31:13,068 --> 00:31:16,029
[SPEAKER_11]: It should not require that thing to be on for any reason.

508
00:31:16,389 --> 00:31:17,529
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's my other question.

509
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:22,391
[SPEAKER_11]: What if I just unplug the fucking thing so it doesn't have a power source?

510
00:31:22,751 --> 00:31:25,472
[SPEAKER_11]: What if I just unplug it when I don't want to use it?

511
00:31:26,292 --> 00:31:27,632
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that going to cause it to malfunction?

512
00:31:28,213 --> 00:31:31,594
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I could just put it on a switch and have a little on-off switch.

513
00:31:31,634 --> 00:31:33,955
[SPEAKER_07]: They said, no, you don't even have to do that.

514
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:40,717
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like the PlayStation 3 where there's a power switch on the back of the console and you can flip it off.

515
00:31:41,997 --> 00:31:51,140
[SPEAKER_07]: But they're just saying, though, if you're going to leave it in standby mode or whatever, that the microphones are going to be always listening to you so that you can say on and it will turn the Xbox on.

516
00:31:51,361 --> 00:31:51,641
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

517
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:51,941
[SPEAKER_03]: I read 1984.

518
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:56,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, did we leave the Xbox on?

519
00:31:56,609 --> 00:31:58,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, fuck, it's turned on again.

520
00:32:00,034 --> 00:32:06,865
[SPEAKER_11]: Ranma in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Say what you will about Microsoft, but they handled the security breach a hell of a lot better than Sony.

521
00:32:08,306 --> 00:32:09,086
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes and no.

522
00:32:09,927 --> 00:32:11,927
[SPEAKER_11]: Sony at least admitted there was a problem.

523
00:32:12,387 --> 00:32:16,469
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't actually have any money stolen from my Sony and that whole thing.

524
00:32:16,529 --> 00:32:19,290
[SPEAKER_11]: Nobody hacked into that or stole anything.

525
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:24,511
[SPEAKER_11]: Sony did have to give a lot away with that and the whole free games and everything.

526
00:32:25,052 --> 00:32:26,512
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not saying that makes it right.

527
00:32:26,712 --> 00:32:32,074
[SPEAKER_11]: What happened with Sony was not cool and was something they needed to have their feet to the fire held to.

528
00:32:32,674 --> 00:32:50,446
[SPEAKER_11]: but I kind of feel like that was done and they paid for that in the court of public opinion I'm not so sure Microsoft ever had to pay for that but they're gonna pay for this in the court of public opinion and you're starting to see it in you know what Germany is I mean this this is much bigger news than you guys think Germany is freaking crazy when it comes to privacy laws which

529
00:32:51,306 --> 00:32:53,447
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think anybody here is going to really have a problem with, right?

530
00:32:53,747 --> 00:32:57,149
[SPEAKER_11]: Germany is a leader in some regards when it comes to the privacy.

531
00:32:57,629 --> 00:33:04,153
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, if it's going to come to the point where like, yo, the Xbox will not be sold in Germany unless they allow you to turn it off.

532
00:33:04,473 --> 00:33:05,974
[SPEAKER_11]: That's going to cause policy change.

533
00:33:06,034 --> 00:33:06,694
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to have to.

534
00:33:07,856 --> 00:33:13,438
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's stupid anyways to have... I understand that the interface stuff uses the Kinect.

535
00:33:13,878 --> 00:33:15,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Whoop-dee-shit.

536
00:33:15,699 --> 00:33:16,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Do I need to use that?

537
00:33:16,959 --> 00:33:19,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that really something I need to use?

538
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:21,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Why even bother with it?

539
00:33:22,141 --> 00:33:28,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Just have it where you can unplug it, and if it's a game that requires Kinect, and I mean requires it, not like...

540
00:33:29,304 --> 00:33:31,405
[SPEAKER_07]: Shouty and Grenade or some bullshit like that.

541
00:33:31,445 --> 00:33:33,266
[SPEAKER_07]: But if it requires Kinect, then have it plug in.

542
00:33:33,727 --> 00:33:37,249
[SPEAKER_07]: That way they can still program the games because they know that there's going to be a Kinect there.

543
00:33:37,589 --> 00:33:38,609
[SPEAKER_07]: You just plug it in.

544
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:47,615
[SPEAKER_07]: But the whole thing is, if it's not going to work with the Kinect, what if a cat knocks the Kinect off your shelf and it breaks?

545
00:33:48,435 --> 00:33:55,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck, now you can't play your console because your stupid Kinect that you weren't using anyways for stuff is just broken.

546
00:33:55,779 --> 00:33:58,421
[SPEAKER_11]: In the interest of time, I'm going to go ahead.

547
00:33:58,461 --> 00:33:58,922
[SPEAKER_11]: Final thought.

548
00:33:59,342 --> 00:34:03,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't it also Germany that sort of had Nintendo by the balls for legalities?

549
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:09,630
[SPEAKER_11]: Didn't the whole zombie you sell late at night thing, wasn't that a Germany-rooted thing?

550
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:13,372
[SPEAKER_03]: And we saw how they had to work out a deal to get that to go.

551
00:34:13,453 --> 00:34:21,959
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that whatever comes out of Germany, if it doesn't fly legally on the international stage, they're going to have to make changes.

552
00:34:22,279 --> 00:34:42,474
[SPEAKER_11]: all right regardless admittedly we are making a lot of opinions here based on cloudy information so Microsoft I look to you to clear up some of this cloudiness at E3 and we will reformulate our opinions at that time if need be but this just shows there are questions that have to be answered let's hope Microsoft answers them in a week we'll know a week and a half in a week and a half we'll know

553
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:46,454
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully this will all be over and it'll all be just a dream.

554
00:34:47,315 --> 00:34:48,857
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll be like that one season of Dallas.

555
00:34:48,958 --> 00:34:49,659
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, DarkSakura.

556
00:34:49,819 --> 00:34:54,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, speaking of international stage, the Xbox One is going to be region locked.

557
00:34:54,706 --> 00:35:00,213
[SPEAKER_03]: So everything that comes out must match the region and this is something Microsoft told Digital Trends.

558
00:35:01,475 --> 00:35:04,176
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we've already pretty much seen this anyway.

559
00:35:04,457 --> 00:35:05,657
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a big surprise.

560
00:35:06,418 --> 00:35:14,604
[SPEAKER_03]: But they are going to keep everything to country-specific guidelines before they're cleared to sale.

561
00:35:15,604 --> 00:35:22,189
[SPEAKER_07]: I think before they were saying that it was up to the developer or the publisher, whatever, if they wanted it to be region-locked or not.

562
00:35:22,517 --> 00:35:22,998
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

563
00:35:45,153 --> 00:35:50,319
[SPEAKER_03]: If it is up to the studio, that's one thing, but the quote here says, must match.

564
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:55,125
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's where I'm at with this.

565
00:35:55,605 --> 00:36:00,471
[SPEAKER_11]: It's one of those things where I hear this and I'm like, okay, yet again, it's something that's a little unclear and it's a little disappointing.

566
00:36:00,831 --> 00:36:06,953
[SPEAKER_11]: But sadly, I can't go, well, Microsoft, I totally blame you for doing this, because it's a real unfortunate trend.

567
00:36:07,294 --> 00:36:10,475
[SPEAKER_11]: The only thing we saw that really bucked the trend recently was the PlayStation 3.

568
00:36:11,175 --> 00:36:14,016
[SPEAKER_11]: And what, the original DS was region-free?

569
00:36:14,216 --> 00:36:20,759
[SPEAKER_07]: The DS, the PS, all the handheld systems up to the 3DS were region-free, and then the PS3 was region-free as well.

570
00:36:21,024 --> 00:36:24,808
[SPEAKER_11]: So I can't fault Microsoft alone for this, but I think it is worth saying.

571
00:36:24,848 --> 00:36:30,535
[SPEAKER_11]: We've said it many times on this show, being that this show started out of a very Japanese-centric video game.

572
00:36:30,795 --> 00:36:36,221
[SPEAKER_11]: A bunch of games, including Beatmania and Dance Dance Revolution and all that.

573
00:36:37,463 --> 00:36:39,806
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there's going to come a time when companies need to realize...

574
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:44,920
[SPEAKER_11]: Gaming companies tear down this wall.

575
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,380
[SPEAKER_11]: Why do we keep separating?

576
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,421
[SPEAKER_03]: We are a global community.

577
00:36:49,581 --> 00:36:52,201
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, yeah, we're becoming more and more this global economy.

578
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:55,542
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of people here who would like to play some of the shit that's out in Japan.

579
00:36:55,802 --> 00:36:58,703
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a lot of people in Europe that would like to play some of the stuff that comes out here.

580
00:36:58,743 --> 00:37:01,403
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, when are we going to get a global console?

581
00:37:01,443 --> 00:37:03,184
[SPEAKER_11]: Why does everything still have to be separated?

582
00:37:04,784 --> 00:37:10,948
[SPEAKER_11]: I know you're all sitting there answering the question for me that, well, it has to do with licensing, especially when you get into those music-based games.

583
00:37:10,968 --> 00:37:12,349
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of it is licensed by region.

584
00:37:12,649 --> 00:37:18,713
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm just saying, you know, the internet has got to force some of our ways of thinking in this dealing to modernize.

585
00:37:18,813 --> 00:37:23,637
[SPEAKER_11]: And we need to globalize some of this stuff a little more and make more games region-free because...

586
00:37:25,027 --> 00:37:26,367
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to be open and honest.

587
00:37:26,467 --> 00:37:29,608
[SPEAKER_11]: Region locks on the PlayStation 1 is what drove me to piracy.

588
00:37:29,808 --> 00:37:35,530
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think there's really a whole ton of region locking on iOS games or anything like that.

589
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:38,250
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, let's be honest here.

590
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:45,272
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not all these iOS games that have great soundtracks and high development costs, that type of thing.

591
00:37:45,332 --> 00:37:46,252
[SPEAKER_07]: But there are a few.

592
00:37:46,692 --> 00:37:48,913
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know there are some music games out there that...

593
00:37:49,894 --> 00:37:55,096
[SPEAKER_07]: aren't region locked, so why can they get away with it when the consoles can't?

594
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:57,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, this is what I think.

595
00:37:57,811 --> 00:38:12,379
[SPEAKER_03]: If you leave everything completely region-free and then just impose import taxes, you know, it's the same thing like I've sort of suggested being done for companies that outsource, you know, tax the crap out of them so that they'd be more inclined to keep jobs over here.

596
00:38:12,919 --> 00:38:21,984
[SPEAKER_03]: But other than that, if a company is going to have, you know, say that everything's region-free, will then make it a little bit more expensive to import.

597
00:38:22,324 --> 00:38:23,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Have an import, you know,

598
00:38:24,305 --> 00:38:32,007
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I always thought it was really cool that, you know, there was a handful of games on the 360 that were Japanese where they didn't bother to translate them.

599
00:38:32,027 --> 00:38:32,887
[SPEAKER_11]: Like Death Smiles?

600
00:38:33,047 --> 00:38:34,688
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they just put them up on the marketplace.

601
00:38:34,728 --> 00:38:36,408
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, if you want to pay 40 bucks for it, here you go.

602
00:38:37,288 --> 00:38:37,628
[SPEAKER_11]: Yay!

603
00:38:37,968 --> 00:38:42,870
[SPEAKER_03]: We bought, like, that Death Smiles Special Edition, which was pretty much the exact same.

604
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:43,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

605
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:46,571
[SPEAKER_11]: I wish more game companies did that stuff.

606
00:38:47,251 --> 00:38:48,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they just did that.

607
00:38:48,191 --> 00:38:50,472
[SPEAKER_07]: They had a new Dawn of Apache game that came out.

608
00:38:50,752 --> 00:38:51,012
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool.

609
00:38:52,572 --> 00:38:57,276
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I mean, if they are going to region lock the Xbox One or whatever, I hope we see more stuff like that.

610
00:38:57,436 --> 00:39:00,498
[SPEAKER_11]: But I just think region locking is kind of a dated thing.

611
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,061
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, more news.

612
00:39:06,503 --> 00:39:07,384
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's see.

613
00:39:07,824 --> 00:39:09,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk a little bit about Sony.

614
00:39:10,006 --> 00:39:11,687
[SPEAKER_07]: I can get away from Microsoft here.

615
00:39:12,208 --> 00:39:21,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Sony is going to be forcing all publishers and developers to have their titles that are going to be on the PlayStation 4 compatible with remote play on the Vita.

616
00:39:23,143 --> 00:39:51,285
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's kind of cool actually more reasons to buy a Vita it's a smart little jab at Nintendo and the fact that a lot of the whole Wii U is the whole off screen play Nintendo won't be able to claim exclusivity to that anymore although granted the Vita is a separate device it's probably going to cost you more to do it via the PS4 it's a logical movement of the chess piece if you will

617
00:39:51,525 --> 00:40:04,869
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's even better than just off-screen play with the Wii U because if you're in a Wi-Fi hotspot somewhere else, and I'm assuming that this is all going to be streamed through their Gaikai stuff now, you're going to be able to play your games away from home.

618
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:06,610
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, interesting.

619
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:07,550
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't even think of that.

620
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:08,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

621
00:40:08,831 --> 00:40:14,412
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just assuming it would be very... And I didn't even think it would necessarily be Wi-Fi, but that's very interesting.

622
00:40:14,993 --> 00:40:18,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so I think it's just going to be wherever you are.

623
00:40:18,794 --> 00:40:19,394
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be kind of cool.

624
00:40:19,554 --> 00:40:25,596
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be really cool if it would work, but if you have an internet connection like what we have here trying to do the show, it might drop out.

625
00:40:25,976 --> 00:40:26,636
[SPEAKER_11]: LOL, game over.

626
00:40:26,656 --> 00:40:29,477
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what that makes me think of, though, just as a concept?

627
00:40:29,877 --> 00:40:37,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in the days in Neo Geo where you had the memory card where you could play on the arcade and then take it home if you had the system, wouldn't it sort of be almost the same thing?

628
00:40:38,999 --> 00:40:41,100
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially if you incorporated the share function?

629
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:48,042
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, Jamie, now that I think about it, you know, the PS3 and the PSP, yes, PSP, do this today.

630
00:40:48,122 --> 00:40:52,703
[SPEAKER_11]: We talked about this on the show, how this is a horribly underlooked feature of these consoles.

631
00:40:52,783 --> 00:41:05,246
[SPEAKER_11]: But if I'm at a friend's house on their Wi-Fi, if I have my PlayStation 3 set to listen for it, I can power on my PlayStation 3 from my friend's house and over the Wi-Fi navigate my PlayStation 3.

632
00:41:05,686 --> 00:41:07,667
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, all this technology is there right now.

633
00:41:07,807 --> 00:41:11,408
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just that it's slow as shit and you can't play games through it.

634
00:41:11,628 --> 00:41:15,749
[SPEAKER_11]: You can only do things like watch movies and even then they're going to be a little bit shoddy.

635
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:16,970
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe music.

636
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:19,091
[SPEAKER_03]: But look at where the technology is going to be in two years.

637
00:41:19,151 --> 00:41:19,771
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.

638
00:41:19,871 --> 00:41:29,854
[SPEAKER_11]: Now that Sony has Gaikai, what if PlayStation 4 and Loki, I think you hit the nail on the head, what if the PlayStation 4 is a Gaikai box and they're leveraging that technology to oomph that up a lot?

639
00:41:30,314 --> 00:41:34,496
[SPEAKER_03]: We're already looking into these massive...

640
00:41:36,417 --> 00:41:41,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's always harder to look ahead in a way because honestly, think back to when we were like 9 and 10 years old or...

641
00:41:54,754 --> 00:42:00,656
[SPEAKER_11]: or even, we'll even go a little later, you know, something that, you know, because I know a lot of our listeners are younger, something that maybe a lot of you guys remember.

642
00:42:00,716 --> 00:42:07,038
[SPEAKER_11]: So think to the time that was like 1990, 91 or so when the Super Nintendo was big and the Super Nintendo was first coming out.

643
00:42:07,398 --> 00:42:14,221
[SPEAKER_11]: It was like when you first saw that Mode 7 for the first time, it's like, oh my God, I'm really flying.

644
00:42:14,261 --> 00:42:15,621
[SPEAKER_11]: This shit is real.

645
00:42:16,041 --> 00:42:17,322
[SPEAKER_11]: Or Star Fox.

646
00:42:17,842 --> 00:42:19,103
[SPEAKER_11]: Stunt Race Stunt Race

647
00:42:46,657 --> 00:42:48,638
[SPEAKER_11]: Who knew that we would be replacing all of our TVs?

648
00:42:48,778 --> 00:42:52,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knew we wouldn't have to change sides?

649
00:42:52,898 --> 00:42:58,280
[SPEAKER_11]: Who knew that the government would come in and say, everybody must switch from analog to digital?

650
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:02,161
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, we are going to switch as a country from analog to digital signals for TV.

651
00:43:02,441 --> 00:43:03,581
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, that's just, you know, you don't know.

652
00:43:03,781 --> 00:43:05,781
[SPEAKER_11]: So who knows where we're going to be in 25 years?

653
00:43:06,081 --> 00:43:06,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knew?

654
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:08,082
[SPEAKER_11]: It's exciting and scary.

655
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:13,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Back when I was playing Kangaroo on the Atari 2600, that I would be playing Mass Effect today.

656
00:43:15,896 --> 00:43:19,619
[SPEAKER_11]: Who knew three years ago on this show when you were like, I don't want to play that game.

657
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,140
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like a stupid shoot-em-up.

658
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:22,361
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to play that.

659
00:43:23,402 --> 00:43:25,344
[SPEAKER_11]: More like dumb effects.

660
00:43:25,744 --> 00:43:31,168
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to romance the blue chick, which I did once just so I could dump her, which was hilarious.

661
00:43:32,469 --> 00:43:32,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Just saying.

662
00:43:34,611 --> 00:43:36,051
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, anyhow.

663
00:43:36,972 --> 00:43:42,093
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, in about 25 years, that might be the time when you can actually play Blizzard's next MMO.

664
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:46,434
[SPEAKER_11]: They've been working on a new game that's called Titan, but that's a codename.

665
00:43:46,475 --> 00:43:49,055
[SPEAKER_11]: That is not the final name of the game, that's just the codename internally.

666
00:43:49,435 --> 00:43:54,857
[SPEAKER_11]: But it came out this week from a site named VentureBeat that there have been some big changes with Titan.

667
00:43:55,257 --> 00:44:21,046
[SPEAKER_11]: Blizzard internally has postponed this game there were 100 people working on the project but this has been reduced to 30 the other folks have been put to work on other games Titan never had a release date it was never really confirmed by Blizzard but again rumor and all this you know speak is saying that now the game will not be ready until 2016 well now usually I would just say whatever it's a rumor you know I don't know what to think about this

668
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:28,955
[SPEAKER_11]: But the network ZAM, which runs some popular World of Warcraft sites like Wowhead, if you've played Wow, you probably know that site, wowhead.com.

669
00:44:29,175 --> 00:44:29,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Wowhead.

670
00:44:30,217 --> 00:44:34,783
[SPEAKER_11]: They reached out to Blizzard, and Blizzard actually said, quote,

671
00:44:39,949 --> 00:44:41,730
[SPEAKER_11]: They kind of confirmed it by saying that, which is really weird.

672
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:44,831
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, you just would not expect Blizzard to be that transparent, but they said that.

673
00:44:44,851 --> 00:44:44,931
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

674
00:45:06,368 --> 00:45:07,268
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

675
00:45:25,874 --> 00:45:29,377
[SPEAKER_11]: I, for one, can't get upset about a game I know literally nothing about

676
00:45:50,376 --> 00:45:53,058
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe that will be that much better and will actually come out sometime soon.

677
00:45:53,078 --> 00:45:54,198
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe we'll see that at BlizzCon.

678
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:54,939
[SPEAKER_11]: Who knows?

679
00:45:55,939 --> 00:46:00,142
[SPEAKER_11]: So I can't say I'm going to get upset about this news, especially hearing that they're going to shift the resources elsewhere.

680
00:46:00,222 --> 00:46:07,847
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, it's a little bit, you kind of want to go, I wish I could see what Blizzard's going to do that's not Warcraft.

681
00:46:07,887 --> 00:46:09,908
[SPEAKER_11]: And granted, this could be World of Warcraft 2.

682
00:46:10,948 --> 00:46:11,429
[SPEAKER_11]: It could be.

683
00:46:12,649 --> 00:46:15,512
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it took Ragnarok Online long enough to get to a sequel.

684
00:46:15,832 --> 00:46:26,843
[SPEAKER_11]: I sort of think, I don't know, tinfoil hat maybe, but I sort of think that the next WoW expansion is going to finally give that big graphical upgrade that's going to modernize it, and they're not going to need a World of Warcraft 2.

685
00:46:27,243 --> 00:46:32,528
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't see Blizzard trying to make that happen because it doesn't always happen so well for other MMOs.

686
00:46:32,908 --> 00:46:33,048
[SPEAKER_11]: But...

687
00:46:33,669 --> 00:46:36,472
[SPEAKER_11]: Then again, Guild Wars and Guild Wars 2 coexisting fine.

688
00:46:36,953 --> 00:46:42,960
[SPEAKER_11]: Final Fantasy XI, Final Fantasy XIV Reborn, too soon to tell, but looks promising.

689
00:46:43,421 --> 00:46:46,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Final Fantasy XIV, sorry, pretty.

690
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:47,585
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, no, I know.

691
00:46:47,726 --> 00:46:48,426
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannot wait.

692
00:46:48,687 --> 00:46:50,168
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that's the importance of technology.

693
00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:53,212
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, anyhow, one more story and then release dates.

694
00:46:53,432 --> 00:46:53,853
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.

695
00:46:54,898 --> 00:46:58,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, in other news, and God, what a disgusting ad on this page.

696
00:46:59,121 --> 00:47:08,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, who remembers the rumor, the big urban legend, about a bajillion Atari 2600 ET cartridges being buried?

697
00:47:11,953 --> 00:47:12,993
[SPEAKER_11]: I've definitely heard that.

698
00:47:13,273 --> 00:47:15,354
[SPEAKER_11]: But they were melted down before they were buried.

699
00:47:15,834 --> 00:47:16,674
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I heard.

700
00:47:16,714 --> 00:47:17,594
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's important to know.

701
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:29,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there is an Ontario-based production company called Fuel that has signed a deal with the... Basically, it's a town in New Mexico.

702
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:30,997
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to ruin this.

703
00:47:31,537 --> 00:47:32,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Alamogordo?

704
00:47:32,578 --> 00:47:33,078
[SPEAKER_11]: Alamogordo.

705
00:47:33,138 --> 00:47:33,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Alamogordo, thank you.

706
00:47:35,058 --> 00:47:40,780
[SPEAKER_03]: were the landfill that supposedly not just E3 cartridges, but a ton of Atari prototypes.

707
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:46,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Prototype games, prototype systems, anything that was in development that they ended up not releasing going into this dump.

708
00:47:47,462 --> 00:47:53,503
[SPEAKER_03]: And the city has given this production company permission to go digging through the dump.

709
00:47:54,003 --> 00:47:56,984
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going huge dumpster diving in a landfill.

710
00:47:57,224 --> 00:48:01,866
[SPEAKER_11]: This is digging up a dead body to see what the real cause of death was.

711
00:48:02,026 --> 00:48:02,926
[SPEAKER_11]: This is what this is.

712
00:48:04,332 --> 00:48:05,353
[SPEAKER_11]: To do a DNA test.

713
00:48:27,884 --> 00:48:28,525
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

714
00:48:38,769 --> 00:48:57,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and you know that there are people who have, I'm saying escaped with prototypes, just in jest, but you find a lot of 5200 prototypes online for sale, where people have gotten legit ROM dumps and reconstituted them for sale.

715
00:48:58,782 --> 00:49:00,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Our copy of Millipede for 5200 was a prototype.

716
00:49:03,405 --> 00:49:04,446
[SPEAKER_11]: But they crushed these.

717
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:07,468
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I'd always heard they melted them down, but crushed makes a lot more sense.

718
00:49:07,588 --> 00:49:09,149
[SPEAKER_11]: You put them in the trash compactor and they crush down.

719
00:49:09,169 --> 00:49:11,951
[SPEAKER_11]: They did that so that looters wouldn't dig them up and try to sell them.

720
00:49:12,431 --> 00:49:14,753
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I mean, but then what's the point?

721
00:49:14,773 --> 00:49:17,715
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to dig up literally garbage that doesn't work.

722
00:49:17,795 --> 00:49:19,116
[SPEAKER_11]: It's 25 years old.

723
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:22,998
[SPEAKER_11]: Those things, if a board is sitting outside a case that long, it's not going to work.

724
00:49:23,198 --> 00:49:27,281
[SPEAKER_03]: But if a memory chip happens to have been compressed within... Good luck.

725
00:49:27,701 --> 00:49:29,743
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, but the whole thing is that...

726
00:49:32,906 --> 00:49:34,107
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a chance that exists.

727
00:49:34,808 --> 00:49:47,061
[SPEAKER_03]: And people who especially big video game history buffs, Atari fans, they're going to drop the opportunity to see if there is anything salvageable.

728
00:49:47,835 --> 00:49:56,141
[SPEAKER_11]: Dungeon Buster in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, I hope that doesn't turn into another Capone's vault.

729
00:49:56,581 --> 00:50:00,164
[SPEAKER_11]: Will Geraldo Rivera be there when they unearth the big massive ET cartridges?

730
00:50:00,544 --> 00:50:01,505
[SPEAKER_11]: Will he be there live?

731
00:50:02,425 --> 00:50:03,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Does he have a career still?

732
00:50:04,887 --> 00:50:05,187
[SPEAKER_11]: No?

733
00:50:05,808 --> 00:50:06,628
[SPEAKER_11]: So yes, he will be.

734
00:50:08,799 --> 00:50:15,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't the angry video game nerd, like that was like the basis of his movie, was going to the dump to find if the game exists?

735
00:50:16,001 --> 00:50:16,541
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't even know.

736
00:50:16,561 --> 00:50:17,161
[SPEAKER_11]: I never saw it.

737
00:50:18,281 --> 00:50:18,481
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

738
00:50:18,501 --> 00:50:24,823
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, if we're done with the Atari story, I want to go back real quick to the Titan thing because Technus in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com made a very good point about this.

739
00:50:24,903 --> 00:50:25,823
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to throw this out there.

740
00:50:26,423 --> 00:50:33,825
[SPEAKER_11]: Technus says, I would speculate that Bungie beat them to the punch with Destiny and they needed to reset after Activision picked up Bungie.

741
00:50:34,565 --> 00:51:02,841
[SPEAKER_11]: that's a really good theory because again rumors and whisperings and you know who knows how much we can lend to this but I did hear that Titan was quite a bit like what Destiny sounds like it's going to be that it was less of a shooter per se but that a lot of the same stuff they're talking about implementing with Destiny was supposed to be the types of stuff they were doing with Titan too you know take with a gigantic grain of salt take with an entire can of salt actually take with all the salt in the ocean salt lick salt lick

742
00:51:04,021 --> 00:51:04,502
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

743
00:51:05,242 --> 00:51:07,164
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to quote Queen Semia in chat.

744
00:51:07,244 --> 00:51:08,405
[SPEAKER_03]: They find Hoffa under the pile.

745
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:09,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Plot twist.

746
00:51:10,847 --> 00:51:13,710
[SPEAKER_11]: Masked Bishop with some strong opinions on Realm Reborn.

747
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:17,253
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn will succeed.

748
00:51:17,393 --> 00:51:22,097
[SPEAKER_11]: If you think Square Enix will let the Final Fantasy franchise fail, you're sadly mistaken.

749
00:51:22,617 --> 00:51:25,860
[SPEAKER_11]: Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn will be the next game changer.

750
00:51:26,461 --> 00:51:27,341
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll say this much.

751
00:51:27,862 --> 00:51:29,143
[SPEAKER_11]: It's impressive that they...

752
00:51:30,825 --> 00:51:38,547
[SPEAKER_11]: The second half of what he said at least is true because Square Enix put a lot of money to basically redo the fucking game from scratch.

753
00:51:39,065 --> 00:51:39,766
[SPEAKER_03]: and you can see it.

754
00:51:40,506 --> 00:51:41,407
[SPEAKER_03]: You can really tell.

755
00:51:42,608 --> 00:51:43,389
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be interesting.

756
00:51:43,529 --> 00:51:44,810
[SPEAKER_11]: Free to play Final Fantasy XI.

757
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:45,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.

758
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:46,491
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on.

759
00:51:46,611 --> 00:51:46,911
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on.

760
00:51:47,352 --> 00:51:48,152
[SPEAKER_11]: Wouldn't that be something?

761
00:51:48,653 --> 00:51:49,033
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see.

762
00:51:49,333 --> 00:51:49,554
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

763
00:51:49,874 --> 00:51:56,760
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's check out some games that will be coming out a little bit sooner than Final Fantasy XV or whatever else we're thinking about here.

764
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:57,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Release dates.

765
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:58,141
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

766
00:51:58,161 --> 00:52:01,343
[SPEAKER_07]: So this week we've got PlayStation 3 or on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

767
00:52:01,864 --> 00:52:02,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember me?

768
00:52:02,664 --> 00:52:03,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Coming out from Capcom.

769
00:52:04,506 --> 00:52:06,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Receiving kind of mixed reviews but whatever.

770
00:52:07,929 --> 00:52:18,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Animal Crossing on the 3DS or Animal Crossing New Leaf on the 3DS because there's one single new leaf in the game and the rest is all the same as the last one.

771
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:27,727
[SPEAKER_07]: The Skyrim Elder Scrolls V Skyrim Legendary Edition cover re-released the game with the DLC on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.

772
00:52:30,469 --> 00:52:58,102
[SPEAKER_07]: and at long last if you don't have the internet and you want to play Minecraft Minecraft on the Xbox 360 the Xbox 360 version is coming out as a disc version that might be a good one for the Xbox 360 in the kids room that's not hooked up to the internet I could see that being a plus because Minecraft's a pretty friendly kids game it is an awesome game so there's that and that's pretty much it this week

773
00:52:59,202 --> 00:53:04,633
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, coming out in Japan on the PlayStation 3, Gal Gun gets a price reduction into the best series.

774
00:53:04,694 --> 00:53:05,616
[SPEAKER_11]: Ha ha, yeah.

775
00:53:05,776 --> 00:53:09,564
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's another game called Narawatera Gakuen...

776
00:53:10,523 --> 00:53:14,624
[SPEAKER_11]: Geki Joban Anime, and Complete Setting Book Hybrid Disc.

777
00:53:14,684 --> 00:53:19,865
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think this is actually the anime and a game based on the anime all on one disc.

778
00:53:20,805 --> 00:53:31,068
[SPEAKER_11]: Because you see this happening more and more in Japan where you get the bundled Blu-ray that has a game and a movie or at least two separate Blu-rays or whatever in a bundled collection.

779
00:53:31,868 --> 00:53:37,089
[SPEAKER_11]: On the Xbox 360, Halo Origin Pack this week in Japan for all you Halo fans in origin.

780
00:53:37,549 --> 00:53:41,250
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, Minecraft Xbox 360 Edition, the standalone game, is out in Japan as well.

781
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:44,751
[SPEAKER_11]: And a new Camouflage 360 wireless controller in Japan.

782
00:53:44,791 --> 00:53:46,652
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess this is to go with the Halo Origin Pack.

783
00:53:47,252 --> 00:53:56,635
[SPEAKER_11]: Which, by the way, quickly while it's on my mind, do you think Microsoft at E3 is going to have anything to kind of throw something at Japan to try and make it work there?

784
00:53:56,795 --> 00:53:57,595
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think they're going to try.

785
00:53:58,195 --> 00:53:58,455
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

786
00:53:58,895 --> 00:54:03,378
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought I read somewhere that they did say they are committed to Japan, but that could have just been smoke up my ass.

787
00:54:03,398 --> 00:54:03,698
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

788
00:54:03,718 --> 00:54:04,638
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's smoke up their ass.

789
00:54:04,878 --> 00:54:07,280
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll release a game with a pillow and a clock.

790
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:10,361
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the market's so small there now.

791
00:54:10,421 --> 00:54:12,102
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

792
00:54:12,122 --> 00:54:13,763
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just more focused on the larger market.

793
00:54:13,803 --> 00:54:19,586
[SPEAKER_11]: Microsoft's market is small, but certainly handhelds is really what it seems to be about.

794
00:54:19,606 --> 00:54:19,986
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

795
00:54:21,206 --> 00:54:23,868
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing of note on the PlayStation Vita this week.

796
00:54:24,529 --> 00:54:26,591
[SPEAKER_11]: Looking at... Oh, I already did Xbox 360.

797
00:54:26,651 --> 00:54:26,991
[SPEAKER_11]: Way to go.

798
00:54:27,831 --> 00:54:29,633
[SPEAKER_11]: Seeing if there's anything on the Wii U. Actually, yes.

799
00:54:29,773 --> 00:54:31,935
[SPEAKER_11]: Rabbids Land is supposed to be out in Japan this week.

800
00:54:32,475 --> 00:54:35,117
[SPEAKER_11]: The game that got delayed here is supposedly coming out in Japan.

801
00:54:36,018 --> 00:54:40,621
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Rabbids Land was a launch title for the Wii U. Oh, I'm thinking of the other Rabbids game.

802
00:54:40,761 --> 00:54:42,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you're thinking of Rayman Legends.

803
00:54:42,503 --> 00:54:42,863
[SPEAKER_11]: My bad.

804
00:54:43,944 --> 00:54:44,244
[SPEAKER_11]: My bad.

805
00:54:45,245 --> 00:54:45,585
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

806
00:54:45,845 --> 00:54:48,067
[SPEAKER_11]: On the 3DS in Japan this week...

807
00:54:49,228 --> 00:54:50,048
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing of note.

808
00:54:51,269 --> 00:54:54,612
[SPEAKER_11]: On the PSP this week, God Eater Burst gets a price reduction.

809
00:54:55,393 --> 00:54:59,756
[SPEAKER_11]: So lots of price reductions this week, but really not a lot of new games until we get to about June 20th.

810
00:55:00,157 --> 00:55:02,138
[SPEAKER_11]: Seems to be when the next batch of big games comes out.

811
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:05,841
[SPEAKER_11]: Really nothing to say on Nintendo 3DS either.

812
00:55:05,881 --> 00:55:11,646
[SPEAKER_11]: Japan gets Donkey Kong Returns 3D next week on the 13th and a Metallic Red DS to go with that.

813
00:55:11,946 --> 00:55:14,587
[SPEAKER_11]: I did pick up Donkey Kong Country Returns, by the way, for my DS.

814
00:55:14,907 --> 00:55:16,788
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't really played enough of it yet to review it, though.

815
00:55:17,588 --> 00:55:20,389
[SPEAKER_11]: On my plane ride this week, I plan to play some more of it, so I'll let you know.

816
00:55:21,149 --> 00:55:23,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Did I tell you we might finally be getting three DSs?

817
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:23,930
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, no.

818
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:24,531
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

819
00:55:24,551 --> 00:55:33,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's going to be a new massive... I know Apollo Justice is in it.

820
00:55:33,714 --> 00:55:34,494
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to remember.

821
00:55:34,874 --> 00:55:35,655
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Phoenix Wright.

822
00:55:35,695 --> 00:55:36,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Phoenix Wright, thank you.

823
00:55:37,135 --> 00:55:39,516
[SPEAKER_03]: A new game coming out and Fire Emblem.

824
00:55:41,192 --> 00:55:42,492
[SPEAKER_03]: and then I've won Animal Crossing.

825
00:55:43,593 --> 00:55:44,553
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, how about the UK?

826
00:55:44,593 --> 00:55:45,293
[SPEAKER_11]: What's coming out over there?

827
00:55:45,473 --> 00:55:45,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Some stuff.

828
00:55:47,013 --> 00:55:56,075
[SPEAKER_03]: On the 3rd we have Gunpoint for PC and Scrolls for PC and Mac and on 7th we have Remember Me PC, Xbox 360, PS3 and that would be it.

829
00:55:58,336 --> 00:56:04,617
[SPEAKER_11]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com use the passphrase OVEN

830
00:56:05,868 --> 00:56:09,130
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.

831
00:56:09,210 --> 00:56:09,911
[SPEAKER_07]: But first, Loki.

832
00:56:10,952 --> 00:56:31,646
[SPEAKER_07]: So, this is kind of, I guess, the best news that could come out of the situation, because we know that this is only alluding to worse things to come on the next-gen consoles, but EA is eliminating... They already went ahead and said that they're not going to have the online pass in any future games, and now they're going back and retroactively taking away the online pass...

833
00:56:32,146 --> 00:56:47,010
[SPEAKER_07]: from all the old games as well so the online pass now is free so if you want to you know play a used EA game that had the online pass you buy the game and then you activate the online pass for free so that's nice

834
00:56:48,051 --> 00:56:49,572
[SPEAKER_11]: There's just something about this.

835
00:56:49,812 --> 00:56:50,832
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what it is.

836
00:56:51,193 --> 00:56:57,057
[SPEAKER_07]: As we discontinue online paths for our new EA titles, we're also in the process of eliminating it from our existing EA titles.

837
00:56:57,357 --> 00:57:01,119
[SPEAKER_07]: We heard the feedback from players and decided to do away with the online paths altogether.

838
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:03,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

839
00:57:03,681 --> 00:57:04,582
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't trust them.

840
00:57:04,762 --> 00:57:06,563
[SPEAKER_07]: I totally believe that.

841
00:57:06,663 --> 00:57:08,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, what we're doing is wrong.

842
00:57:09,685 --> 00:57:35,932
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what it is I don't know what it is and maybe I am just being a jerk but it's like one of those things where it's like are you sure that when you download the free thing it doesn't say but you are giving us your soul like are you sure there's nothing in there like that I just worry I'm sorry but I know better it's just it's so much bullshit I just don't believe any of that crap I roll my eyes

843
00:57:36,502 --> 00:57:39,585
[SPEAKER_07]: We've made too much money, America and the world.

844
00:57:40,286 --> 00:57:45,291
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just going to stop making extra money now because we have all the money that we need to run those servers now.

845
00:57:45,311 --> 00:57:49,615
[SPEAKER_07]: So we don't need any of your online passes anymore because servers all of a sudden got cheaper to run.

846
00:57:49,955 --> 00:57:50,736
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm sorry.

847
00:57:50,896 --> 00:57:54,280
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a company that makes money.

848
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:57,063
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not going to say, hey, we hate money all of a sudden.

849
00:57:57,143 --> 00:57:57,483
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

850
00:57:58,084 --> 00:57:58,324
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

851
00:57:58,464 --> 00:58:00,326
[SPEAKER_11]: There's just something I don't trust.

852
00:58:03,257 --> 00:58:04,238
[SPEAKER_11]: Call me a conspiracy theorist.

853
00:58:04,298 --> 00:58:11,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe if I take this as an actual legit sign, maybe it's them trying to get away from the business tactics of the former CEO.

854
00:58:13,565 --> 00:58:14,405
[SPEAKER_11]: Now you're being nice.

855
00:58:14,926 --> 00:58:15,226
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

856
00:58:15,326 --> 00:58:17,928
[SPEAKER_03]: I've decided to play Angel's Advocate.

857
00:58:18,508 --> 00:58:25,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Or it could be in-game purchases in Dead Space 3 in future games.

858
00:58:27,615 --> 00:58:32,599
[SPEAKER_03]: But if I want to put it at a non-conspiracy theory point of view, even though I trust...

859
00:58:33,266 --> 00:58:59,968
[SPEAKER_11]: EA as far as I can pick up the entire building and nudge it maybe it is trying to separate themselves from former business practice or it's trying to get people to install Origin which I will not fucking do no TigerClaw with a theory in chat at live.vognetwork.com says EA removes the online pass so people can play the used games online and then a few months later EA shuts down the online servers to those games

860
00:59:00,988 --> 00:59:05,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, that is kind of funny.

861
00:59:05,429 --> 00:59:07,330
[SPEAKER_07]: But here's the thing with some of these games.

862
00:59:07,550 --> 00:59:09,691
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not online games.

863
00:59:10,391 --> 00:59:13,572
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the thing that was kind of the funny part about the online pass.

864
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:16,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember like Dragon Age Origins, Dragon Age 2.

865
00:59:17,673 --> 00:59:22,715
[SPEAKER_11]: Mass Effect 2 had that Cerberus pass and it wasn't really, you didn't play online.

866
00:59:22,835 --> 00:59:23,135
[SPEAKER_11]: It was DLC.

867
00:59:24,035 --> 00:59:31,221
[SPEAKER_03]: My hope is that with all of this that it means I won't have to fucking be online for my DLC in Mass Effect 3 to load because I paid for a lot of it.

868
00:59:33,363 --> 00:59:34,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm a consumer whore.

869
00:59:34,664 --> 00:59:35,225
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care.

870
00:59:37,307 --> 00:59:37,727
[SPEAKER_11]: And how?

871
00:59:38,988 --> 00:59:43,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, mister, I'm gonna buy Mass Effect 3 Trilogy and own it on Xbox and PC.

872
00:59:43,312 --> 00:59:43,892
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

873
00:59:44,032 --> 00:59:44,573
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

874
00:59:44,613 --> 00:59:45,714
[SPEAKER_03]: You're worse than me, okay?

875
00:59:47,475 --> 00:59:49,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, okay, maybe I play more than you do.

876
00:59:49,917 --> 00:59:51,358
[SPEAKER_11]: I play other games too, though.

877
00:59:51,559 --> 00:59:51,899
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

878
00:59:52,162 --> 01:00:16,355
[SPEAKER_03]: You're seriously like my dealer, you and Shane I blame you for everything that happens in my life Shane's worse though, come on Shane is worse Shane is far worse And I haven't started on Persona, so There you go, don't resist I will resist, my will is strong My will is titanium By the way, there's now music from Persona 4 in rotation at vognetwork.com I just put some in today You know what, I actually kind of I'm playing too much shit already

879
01:00:17,782 --> 01:00:18,002
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

880
01:00:18,923 --> 01:00:20,003
[SPEAKER_11]: Going to one more story here.

881
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:24,306
[SPEAKER_11]: This actually came up last week, but it's too good for us to skip completely on our show.

882
01:00:24,346 --> 01:00:25,186
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got to mention it.

883
01:00:25,507 --> 01:00:27,628
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, maybe it... When did this finish?

884
01:00:27,648 --> 01:00:30,530
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it finished on Saturday or Sunday of last week.

885
01:00:30,990 --> 01:00:32,291
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyhow, here's the deal.

886
01:00:32,391 --> 01:00:36,593
[SPEAKER_11]: So did you guys ever check out the iPhone and Android game Curiosity?

887
01:00:36,733 --> 01:00:37,654
[SPEAKER_11]: What's in the cube?

888
01:00:38,863 --> 01:00:40,645
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Peter Molyneux's Dick in a Box.

889
01:00:40,986 --> 01:00:42,448
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember this game where you tap the little keyboard?

890
01:00:42,468 --> 01:00:48,135
[SPEAKER_03]: If this was last week, this was me not having much in the way of internet access except for Tumblr.

891
01:00:48,235 --> 01:00:50,718
[SPEAKER_11]: Finally, what was in the box was revealed.

892
01:00:51,259 --> 01:00:52,280
[SPEAKER_11]: Some dude opened the box.

893
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:53,862
[SPEAKER_11]: You win nothing!

894
01:00:54,383 --> 01:00:55,885
[SPEAKER_11]: You're so stupid!

895
01:00:57,066 --> 01:00:58,587
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, here's what's amazing.

896
01:00:58,887 --> 01:01:01,849
[SPEAKER_11]: The guy who won is an 18-year-old guy, Brian Henderson.

897
01:01:01,889 --> 01:01:04,330
[SPEAKER_11]: He lives in Edinburgh, and he won.

898
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:12,774
[SPEAKER_11]: And the great thing about it, he ended up tweeting or saying in an interview, I don't remember where it was, but he said, yeah, I just downloaded the game an hour before I won it.

899
01:01:16,836 --> 01:01:19,578
[SPEAKER_11]: So what was in the goddamn cube?

900
01:01:19,598 --> 01:01:24,240
[SPEAKER_07]: See, I would have played to the very end too if I had remembered that it was ending, but I just like, I don't fucking care.

901
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:26,521
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's, guess what was in the goddamn cube?

902
01:01:26,541 --> 01:01:29,023
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure many of you have heard, but here's what was in the cube.

903
01:01:30,223 --> 01:01:33,485
[SPEAKER_11]: You, again, now 22cans is, they did Curiosity.

904
01:01:33,505 --> 01:01:37,067
[SPEAKER_11]: Their next project is like a populist reimagining called Goddess.

905
01:01:37,768 --> 01:01:41,830
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Brian will be the god in Goddess.

906
01:01:43,556 --> 01:01:44,397
[SPEAKER_11]: at the Stardust.

907
01:01:44,577 --> 01:01:44,717
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

908
01:01:46,298 --> 01:01:48,679
[SPEAKER_11]: But he will be in... You don't know shit.

909
01:01:52,482 --> 01:01:53,362
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't believe this.

910
01:01:54,243 --> 01:01:56,965
[SPEAKER_11]: Some new kid from the street won this.

911
01:01:57,685 --> 01:01:58,546
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't know shit.

912
01:02:00,467 --> 01:02:01,848
[SPEAKER_11]: You are a whore, darling.

913
01:02:02,168 --> 01:02:05,970
[SPEAKER_03]: A show where we can fall into showgirls quotes is a good show.

914
01:02:06,011 --> 01:02:09,413
[SPEAKER_11]: That game is called Goddess and it just makes me think of showgirls.

915
01:02:09,513 --> 01:02:10,433
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, Nomi Malone.

916
01:02:10,453 --> 01:02:10,794
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

917
01:02:10,874 --> 01:02:12,595
[SPEAKER_11]: Nomi Malone from Edinburgh.

918
01:02:14,096 --> 01:02:15,097
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry to this kid.

919
01:02:15,117 --> 01:02:17,479
[SPEAKER_11]: This poor kid didn't ask for this, so I'm very sorry.

920
01:02:18,019 --> 01:02:19,220
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm going to make the joke anyway.

921
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:22,022
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing the hand flashies in my head.

922
01:02:23,403 --> 01:02:25,064
[SPEAKER_11]: Nomi Malone from Edinburgh.

923
01:02:25,605 --> 01:02:29,088
[SPEAKER_11]: Open the cube and we'll get to be the god and goddess.

924
01:02:30,302 --> 01:02:55,818
[SPEAKER_11]: and apparently not only will he be the god but he will have a hand in creating the rules that will govern the game so it's his rules or get out and Brian gets to share in the revenue generated by goddess but they're saying in one year he could be pushed down a flight of stairs or slip on ice and a new goddess could emerge here's the thing

925
01:02:57,489 --> 01:03:01,154
[SPEAKER_11]: When did this whole thing, this cube thing launch?

926
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:02,656
[SPEAKER_11]: Like what, seven months ago, right?

927
01:03:03,437 --> 01:03:06,861
[SPEAKER_11]: Didn't Goddess get kickstarted midway through this project?

928
01:03:06,941 --> 01:03:07,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Kickstarted?

929
01:03:07,762 --> 01:03:08,803
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's my new verb.

930
01:03:08,903 --> 01:03:09,945
[SPEAKER_11]: Didn't it get kickstarted?

931
01:03:10,185 --> 01:03:11,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Where would it be kickstarted?

932
01:03:11,507 --> 01:03:12,148
[SPEAKER_11]: Kickstarted.

933
01:03:12,488 --> 01:03:13,910
[SPEAKER_11]: Because the website is Kickstarter.

934
01:03:14,110 --> 01:03:14,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

935
01:03:14,531 --> 01:03:15,211
[SPEAKER_11]: Not Kickstart.

936
01:03:15,692 --> 01:03:15,972
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

937
01:03:16,877 --> 01:03:17,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to kickstart my heart?

938
01:03:18,018 --> 01:03:18,158
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

939
01:03:19,118 --> 01:03:24,301
[SPEAKER_11]: So Goddess got kickstarted halfway through the run of Cube.

940
01:03:24,761 --> 01:03:26,662
[SPEAKER_11]: What if it hadn't gone through?

941
01:03:27,042 --> 01:03:28,643
[SPEAKER_11]: Then what would have been in the Cube?

942
01:03:29,963 --> 01:03:30,904
[SPEAKER_11]: I got you.

943
01:03:31,784 --> 01:03:32,385
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

944
01:03:32,585 --> 01:03:35,786
[SPEAKER_11]: You are making this shit up as you go along, Peter Molyneux.

945
01:03:36,286 --> 01:03:37,307
[SPEAKER_07]: I got you.

946
01:03:37,447 --> 01:03:40,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it Schreudner's box or whatever?

947
01:03:40,749 --> 01:03:43,370
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically... There's a dead cat who's not dead.

948
01:03:44,232 --> 01:03:46,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, so it's Goddess, but not Goddess.

949
01:03:47,574 --> 01:03:53,238
[SPEAKER_07]: We won't know because it was Goddess in the box and not Goddess dead having eaten the poison.

950
01:03:55,139 --> 01:03:56,020
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what it would have been?

951
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,941
[SPEAKER_07]: It would have been a dog.

952
01:03:58,121 --> 01:03:59,542
[SPEAKER_07]: He would have adopted a dog for you.

953
01:03:59,562 --> 01:04:00,543
[SPEAKER_07]: It would have been life-changing.

954
01:04:02,564 --> 01:04:05,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, guess what?

955
01:04:06,625 --> 01:04:10,886
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got this boy named Milo and you're going to adopt him.

956
01:04:12,987 --> 01:04:15,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Having kids is going to change your life.

957
01:04:16,048 --> 01:04:17,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Milo will change your life.

958
01:04:19,509 --> 01:04:23,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Milo needs his diaper changed every five seconds and you'll want to die.

959
01:04:23,990 --> 01:04:28,671
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, well we reached out to Peter Molyneux for comment on Goddess and this is what he had to say.

960
01:04:29,775 --> 01:04:32,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Must be weird not having anybody come on you.

961
01:04:32,898 --> 01:04:33,838
[SPEAKER_11]: What does that even mean?

962
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:36,641
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that even mean?

963
01:04:39,283 --> 01:04:40,304
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a quote from Showgirls.

964
01:04:40,424 --> 01:04:40,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Get it?

965
01:04:41,365 --> 01:04:43,626
[SPEAKER_07]: I will give you the best Fable game ever made.

966
01:04:44,187 --> 01:04:47,249
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Fable the Journey.

967
01:04:47,490 --> 01:04:48,390
[SPEAKER_07]: It uses Kinect.

968
01:04:48,731 --> 01:04:49,391
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fantastic.

969
01:04:49,411 --> 01:04:50,172
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not on Rails.

970
01:04:50,352 --> 01:04:51,313
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not on Rails.

971
01:04:55,703 --> 01:05:03,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh shit, alright, let's go to- Hey, I'll tell you what, you know what would have been inside the box if perhaps Peter Molyneux wasn't backing this and it was the Steam box?

972
01:05:04,270 --> 01:05:04,610
[SPEAKER_07]: Hats!

973
01:05:04,630 --> 01:05:06,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Would have been fucking hats.

974
01:05:06,552 --> 01:05:07,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of hats.

975
01:05:07,533 --> 01:05:08,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Hats, hats, hats.

976
01:05:09,374 --> 01:05:12,237
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's travel back- Do they have like a gif?

977
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:18,722
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's funny that we both grunted at him at the same time.

978
01:05:19,975 --> 01:05:20,075
[SPEAKER_11]: Near?

979
01:05:20,095 --> 01:05:20,175
[SPEAKER_11]: Far!

980
01:05:44,417 --> 01:05:48,983
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's travel back to a time when gaming was so much simpler.

981
01:05:49,323 --> 01:05:49,844
[SPEAKER_11]: When you know what?

982
01:05:49,924 --> 01:05:53,569
[SPEAKER_11]: Elizabeth Berkley was Jessie Spano and you hadn't seen her boobies yet.

983
01:05:53,669 --> 01:05:54,670
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a much simpler time.

984
01:05:54,990 --> 01:05:57,013
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the classic game of the week.

985
01:05:57,794 --> 01:05:59,696
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

986
01:06:00,417 --> 01:06:00,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Sonic R.

987
01:06:02,495 --> 01:06:17,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it is Sonic R. I have finally decided to do fucking Sonic R. So, Sonic R was done by Traveler's Tales and Sonic Team, and it came out on the Sega Saturn and Windows.

988
01:06:18,210 --> 01:06:23,415
[SPEAKER_03]: It was out for Windows, which actually, if you've got a decent graphics card, the Windows version actually looks a lot better and plays better.

989
01:06:24,436 --> 01:06:37,222
[SPEAKER_03]: It came out in the US on October 31st, 1997, and then later it came out in Europe, Australia, and Japan all at the same time, and was re-released for PlayStation 2 and the GameCube as part of the Sonic Gems Collection.

990
01:06:38,503 --> 01:06:48,568
[SPEAKER_03]: It is basically the last of the two, I'm sorry, the third Sonic racing game, and the last of two games that was done by Traveler's Tales and Sonic Team.

991
01:06:49,048 --> 01:06:50,509
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, it's a huge foot race.

992
01:06:50,830 --> 01:06:51,550
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what the game is.

993
01:06:52,331 --> 01:06:54,633
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's single or multiplayer.

994
01:06:55,193 --> 01:06:55,874
[SPEAKER_03]: You can race.

995
01:06:56,354 --> 01:06:58,456
[SPEAKER_03]: You have ten different Sonic characters.

996
01:06:59,437 --> 01:07:07,024
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can pick up, like, you have to collect rings on the way to open up different parts of the racetrack.

997
01:07:07,644 --> 01:07:12,829
[SPEAKER_03]: You also can get, like, different shields, like what's in Sonic 3.

998
01:07:13,189 --> 01:07:15,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you can actually get a lightning shield that attracts rings to you.

999
01:07:17,933 --> 01:07:43,728
[SPEAKER_03]: and you have different areas that are sort of based off of various places in the different Sonic games like you have a place that looks like the Green Hill Zone a place that looks like the Chemical Plant you have those item panels like I was talking about that give you different abilities as you go like you can run on water or attract rings and then you get Sonic Tokens and Chaos Emeralds and the Chaos Emeralds help you unlock secret characters

1000
01:07:44,688 --> 01:07:45,889
[SPEAKER_03]: You also have different kinds of weather.

1001
01:07:45,929 --> 01:07:47,790
[SPEAKER_03]: You have clear, you have rain, you have snow.

1002
01:07:48,971 --> 01:07:54,756
[SPEAKER_03]: But the snow does make the water free so you can run over it instead of being slowed down by it.

1003
01:07:55,656 --> 01:07:59,139
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have a time attack mode to see basically who has the fastest time.

1004
01:07:59,759 --> 01:08:06,044
[SPEAKER_03]: So the characters in this one is you are, let's see, you have Sonic and he has double jump.

1005
01:08:06,704 --> 01:08:07,725
[SPEAKER_03]: He's also the fastest.

1006
01:08:07,785 --> 01:08:09,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Tails actually has the ability to fly.

1007
01:08:09,967 --> 01:08:10,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Knuckles can glide.

1008
01:08:12,409 --> 01:08:41,011
[SPEAKER_03]: and then you have Amy Rose who actually drives a car and she can hover over water and gets extra speed boost for your secret characters you have Robotnik also known as Eggman he has a hovercraft and can resist terrain you have Metal Sonic you have a Tails doll and you have Metal Knuckles you have Egg Robo and Super Sonic so basically when you have all the Chaos Emeralds you can play as Super Sonic and you just sort of float over everything

1009
01:08:43,353 --> 01:08:49,457
[SPEAKER_03]: The game actually came out after Sonic 3D Blast when Sega was working with Traveler's Tales on a different Sonic game.

1010
01:08:50,538 --> 01:08:58,144
[SPEAKER_03]: And they'd also been working on a 3D graphics engine that they didn't really have anything for, so they decided to work with Sonic Team to make the game.

1011
01:08:59,125 --> 01:09:01,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much just everything that came together.

1012
01:09:02,286 --> 01:09:07,067
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's actually even a Sonic R that came out on the Tiger handheld system.

1013
01:09:08,668 --> 01:09:15,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, like I said, there was the Sega Saturn version that actually had some really bad problems with draw distance and clipping.

1014
01:09:16,450 --> 01:09:23,052
[SPEAKER_03]: But the PC version let you use better rendering and 3D acceleration, and you could adjust the draw distance.

1015
01:09:23,072 --> 01:09:26,933
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, like today, you could have no draw distance at all in the game.

1016
01:09:26,973 --> 01:09:27,853
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be gorgeous.

1017
01:09:28,533 --> 01:09:36,174
[SPEAKER_03]: The music was done by Richard Jacques of Sega Europe, who also did the music for Sonic 3D Blast.

1018
01:09:37,255 --> 01:09:45,136
[SPEAKER_03]: And he basically worked with Yuji Naka to basically design the musical feel of the game.

1019
01:09:45,916 --> 01:09:48,116
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where we got the Super Sonic Racing.

1020
01:09:48,956 --> 01:09:57,098
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the singer in this one, now this I didn't know, her name is TJ Davis, and she did all of the singing in it at Yuji Naka's request.

1021
01:09:58,358 --> 01:10:02,542
[SPEAKER_03]: So, basically, it was done by a London studio.

1022
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:04,243
[SPEAKER_03]: The music came out of London.

1023
01:10:06,105 --> 01:10:07,066
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a fun game.

1024
01:10:07,166 --> 01:10:12,651
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sort of, you know, not like the world's best Sonic game, but it's a really fun game.

1025
01:10:12,871 --> 01:10:20,357
[SPEAKER_03]: And from that, we also got the two games, well, there were two games that came out before Sonic R. There was Sonic Drift and Sonic Drift 2 for Game Gear.

1026
01:10:21,378 --> 01:10:31,851
[SPEAKER_03]: and then after that we've gotten Sonic Riders, we've gotten Sonic Riders Zero Gravity, Sonic Free Riders, Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing and the Transformed version as well.

1027
01:10:31,951 --> 01:10:34,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are all pretty much born out of the Sonic R franchise.

1028
01:10:35,851 --> 01:10:40,753
[SPEAKER_03]: and, of course, the music is, you know, pretty much the big iconic thing about it.

1029
01:10:41,173 --> 01:10:44,454
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the most gorgeous game, but it's super fun, like we said.

1030
01:10:46,034 --> 01:10:56,017
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we say a system is only as good as the games that are on it, but the games are also, can be absolutely amazing without having to look, you know, absolutely gorgeous.

1031
01:10:56,177 --> 01:10:56,658
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?

1032
01:10:57,418 --> 01:11:00,739
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is one of those that falls into that category.

1033
01:11:01,379 --> 01:11:04,200
[SPEAKER_03]: So my game of the week is Sonic R.

1034
01:11:06,311 --> 01:11:08,372
[SPEAKER_11]: This is one of those games that to me just made sense.

1035
01:11:08,733 --> 01:11:10,093
[SPEAKER_11]: Like Sonic in a racing game.

1036
01:11:10,254 --> 01:11:11,734
[SPEAKER_11]: Why did it take so long?

1037
01:11:12,275 --> 01:11:12,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Kinda right.

1038
01:11:14,176 --> 01:11:15,137
[SPEAKER_11]: And it did have some good music.

1039
01:11:15,957 --> 01:11:18,499
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Sonic Racing was in Sonic R, Tiger Call.

1040
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:20,320
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

1041
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:24,242
[SPEAKER_11]: There it is, your classic game of the week, Sonic R. Good pick.

1042
01:11:25,703 --> 01:11:27,104
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you done every single Sonic game yet?

1043
01:11:27,124 --> 01:11:28,125
[SPEAKER_11]: You gotta be getting close.

1044
01:11:28,797 --> 01:11:29,678
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done a few of them.

1045
01:11:29,818 --> 01:11:32,721
[SPEAKER_03]: But keep in mind, there's a bunch of crap out there in the Sonic franchise.

1046
01:11:33,002 --> 01:11:37,066
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would get Sonic herpes or something.

1047
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:38,368
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1048
01:11:38,868 --> 01:11:39,609
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to take a break.

1049
01:11:39,649 --> 01:11:42,933
[SPEAKER_11]: And when we come back, there is still more news to come in the Fugo Question of the Week.

1050
01:11:42,993 --> 01:11:46,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and to tell what up, G, same music in Japan, all out of the London studio.

1051
01:11:47,017 --> 01:11:49,358
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's none of this whole No, there's not.

1052
01:11:49,498 --> 01:11:50,779
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, just making sure.

1053
01:11:50,959 --> 01:11:52,199
[SPEAKER_11]: Good, at least we can all agree on something.

1054
01:11:52,620 --> 01:12:01,944
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, plenty more to come when Orange Launch Radio returns with this episode number 506, Second Mix J Append, Part B, right after this.

1055
01:12:13,382 --> 01:12:20,786
[SPEAKER_01]: Hola, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican, Actdeft, and you're participating with Orange Nouns Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.

1056
01:12:21,347 --> 01:12:24,929
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to use my voice to tell you that Kirby does not suck.

1057
01:12:25,649 --> 01:12:29,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, literally he does suck, but not figuratively.

1058
01:12:29,952 --> 01:12:31,413
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, play more Kirby!

1059
01:12:33,203 --> 01:12:34,344
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right, play more Kirby.

1060
01:12:35,024 --> 01:12:37,366
[SPEAKER_11]: They have that whole Wii U virtual console thing going on right now.

1061
01:12:37,446 --> 01:12:43,250
[SPEAKER_11]: I was tempted to get the Kirby's Dream Course that they had on Super Nintendo.

1062
01:12:43,290 --> 01:12:44,571
[SPEAKER_11]: It was like the miniature golf game.

1063
01:12:45,111 --> 01:12:45,831
[SPEAKER_11]: It was awesome.

1064
01:12:47,112 --> 01:12:47,633
[SPEAKER_11]: Good times.

1065
01:12:48,635 --> 01:12:49,075
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

1066
01:12:49,455 --> 01:12:50,956
[SPEAKER_11]: You too can leave a bumper.

1067
01:12:51,016 --> 01:12:55,518
[SPEAKER_11]: Go to vognetwork.com and check out the forums for Orange Lounge Radio and more information on there.

1068
01:12:56,118 --> 01:13:00,821
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to use your voice to tell the gaming world something, maybe you want them to play less Kirby.

1069
01:13:01,361 --> 01:13:02,862
[SPEAKER_11]: You could tell us that in a future bumper.

1070
01:13:03,122 --> 01:13:05,083
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the last one that I had in the queue, by the way.

1071
01:13:05,163 --> 01:13:08,464
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're going to start hearing repeats if I don't get any new ones for the next show.

1072
01:13:08,624 --> 01:13:09,104
[SPEAKER_11]: Just saying.

1073
01:13:09,565 --> 01:13:10,345
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my little threat.

1074
01:13:10,645 --> 01:13:11,125
[SPEAKER_11]: Just saying.

1075
01:13:13,427 --> 01:13:38,310
[SPEAKER_11]: During the break tonight, before we get into rapid fire news, I noticed some of the chatters were talking about Civ V, and I don't know how this got brought up, but apparently the Mass Effect mods for Civ V I thought I mentioned this on the show before Yes, they exist, and they're awesome Fun fact, you once said that about Mass Effect I have never liked that type of game

1076
01:13:39,321 --> 01:13:44,844
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even, I mean, I admit that, shit, what game is it I'm thinking of now?

1077
01:13:46,064 --> 01:13:47,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Pop, not Populous.

1078
01:13:47,505 --> 01:13:49,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I didn't like Populous either, but... SimCity?

1079
01:13:51,467 --> 01:13:51,747
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we?

1080
01:13:51,887 --> 01:13:52,147
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh-oh.

1081
01:13:52,408 --> 01:13:53,948
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I thought I hit all the buttons.

1082
01:13:54,669 --> 01:13:59,471
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, I just happened to look over and saw that we were muted, so all of this conversation that's happening...

1083
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:03,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Professional radio folks.

1084
01:14:03,681 --> 01:14:04,302
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1085
01:14:05,102 --> 01:14:10,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob was giving me crap for not wanting to play Civ even though there's a Mass Effect mod.

1086
01:14:10,646 --> 01:14:14,409
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was telling him how I did not like Civ.

1087
01:14:14,749 --> 01:14:16,890
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like SimCity.

1088
01:14:17,491 --> 01:14:18,852
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not like SimCoaster.

1089
01:14:19,432 --> 01:14:22,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I do like watching the coasters that people have made on SimCoaster.

1090
01:14:23,235 --> 01:14:24,375
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like SimPark.

1091
01:14:24,856 --> 01:14:29,459
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the Sims, but really I like building houses and dressing them up and murdering them.

1092
01:14:30,622 --> 01:14:32,376
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like SimAnt either.

1093
01:14:33,243 --> 01:14:33,443
[SPEAKER_11]: Actraiser

1094
01:15:03,021 --> 01:15:04,082
[SPEAKER_11]: Two things about Actraiser.

1095
01:15:04,302 --> 01:15:05,403
[SPEAKER_11]: A, the soundtrack.

1096
01:15:06,163 --> 01:15:09,125
[SPEAKER_11]: B, when that angel flies around, you can see his butt.

1097
01:15:10,106 --> 01:15:10,786
[SPEAKER_11]: It was butt.

1098
01:15:10,886 --> 01:15:12,467
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is how Rob first learned.

1099
01:15:12,487 --> 01:15:14,809
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it was butt on the Super Nintendo.

1100
01:15:14,889 --> 01:15:16,450
[SPEAKER_11]: So it made you giggle a little bit.

1101
01:15:16,490 --> 01:15:17,070
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1102
01:15:17,230 --> 01:15:17,751
[SPEAKER_11]: It was butt.

1103
01:15:19,232 --> 01:15:21,853
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

1104
01:15:22,153 --> 01:15:22,394
[SPEAKER_11]: Butt.

1105
01:15:24,494 --> 01:15:25,055
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what.

1106
01:15:25,455 --> 01:15:27,158
[SPEAKER_03]: From now on, instead of chicken butt, it's angel butt.

1107
01:15:27,778 --> 01:15:28,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess what?

1108
01:15:28,359 --> 01:15:28,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Angel butt.

1109
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:29,400
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1110
01:15:30,382 --> 01:15:34,327
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go around and talk about rapidly what's happening in the world of gaming.

1111
01:15:34,367 --> 01:15:35,128
[SPEAKER_11]: Some quick stories.

1112
01:15:35,869 --> 01:15:36,910
[SPEAKER_11]: Rapid Fire News.

1113
01:15:37,010 --> 01:15:38,993
[SPEAKER_07]: This may be a bit of a spoiler, but...

1114
01:15:40,755 --> 01:15:43,719
[SPEAKER_07]: We think maybe Mirror's Edge 2 might be coming to the Xbox One.

1115
01:15:44,199 --> 01:15:50,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently there was first off a listing on the German and Italian storefronts for Amazon.

1116
01:15:51,368 --> 01:15:52,469
[SPEAKER_07]: And those are removed.

1117
01:15:53,331 --> 01:15:55,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Listing it was for the Xbox One and

1118
01:15:56,433 --> 01:16:11,799
[SPEAKER_07]: and then on EA's own website in the help section their help center had a page for Mirror's Edge 2 and now it's gone so makes me think that maybe that's going to be one of the announcements perhaps

1119
01:16:13,462 --> 01:16:13,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, please.

1120
01:16:41,976 --> 01:16:45,779
[SPEAKER_07]: Last but not least, El Shaddai.

1121
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:48,241
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you guys remember that game.

1122
01:16:48,281 --> 01:16:51,524
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of an artsy action game from Ignition.

1123
01:16:52,225 --> 01:16:57,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, now the rights have been transferred to the creator.

1124
01:16:57,529 --> 01:17:06,416
[SPEAKER_07]: El Shaddai is now back in the creator's portfolio as far as the rights go.

1125
01:17:06,737 --> 01:17:09,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe that means it's going to open up an opportunity for more games.

1126
01:17:09,699 --> 01:17:11,180
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's making me cry right now?

1127
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:15,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time anyone talks about that game, I hear Amy Grant.

1128
01:17:16,802 --> 01:17:17,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Baby, baby.

1129
01:17:17,983 --> 01:17:23,445
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, because when she was heavy into her Christian singing mode, she did a song called El Shaddai.

1130
01:17:23,465 --> 01:17:27,327
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep in mind, I was raised Baptist.

1131
01:17:27,367 --> 01:17:27,927
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the thing.

1132
01:17:28,668 --> 01:17:31,149
[SPEAKER_11]: The references on this show are getting more and more obscure.

1133
01:17:31,409 --> 01:17:35,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, the full title was El Shaddai, the Ascension of the Metatron.

1134
01:17:36,311 --> 01:17:37,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Did she do a song called Metatron?

1135
01:17:38,795 --> 01:17:50,634
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but I just finished watching the season of Supernatural and there was Metatron in it Lordy So, let's see Metatron Yeah

1136
01:17:50,799 --> 01:17:51,059
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

1137
01:17:51,940 --> 01:17:55,021
[SPEAKER_03]: And, sorry, Brad, I adore you to death.

1138
01:17:55,401 --> 01:17:57,442
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a decent song, but her Hebrew was awful.

1139
01:17:59,243 --> 01:18:00,324
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, moving on.

1140
01:18:00,804 --> 01:18:03,526
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm shocked that so many people know that Amy Grant song.

1141
01:18:03,626 --> 01:18:08,508
[SPEAKER_11]: I only remember, baby, baby, something, something lyrics.

1142
01:18:08,568 --> 01:18:13,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, there's one song that she did that I really like, and that was the duet she did with Vince Gill, who she married.

1143
01:18:14,329 --> 01:18:15,590
[SPEAKER_11]: Just saying Whatever happened to her?

1144
01:18:16,391 --> 01:18:20,754
[SPEAKER_03]: She's still recording and still married to Vince Gill She's still recording?

1145
01:18:21,094 --> 01:18:42,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I actually, believe it or not, the only site I could get working was Wikipedia And I was reading up about, actually Vince Gill, but it linked to Amy Grant, so I was like Isn't that amazing how on Wikipedia you could just She married him She's married to Vince Gill I believe you

1146
01:18:43,266 --> 01:18:48,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Mama's watching that Oklahoma relief thing and Vince Gill was on it, so we looked up Vince Gill and it led to Amy Grant.

1147
01:18:53,292 --> 01:18:58,015
[SPEAKER_03]: She's back to doing super Christian stuff and singing with Vince.

1148
01:19:00,296 --> 01:19:01,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, Jamie.

1149
01:19:03,198 --> 01:19:03,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.

1150
01:19:04,679 --> 01:19:04,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

1151
01:19:05,039 --> 01:19:05,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

1152
01:19:09,062 --> 01:19:10,683
[SPEAKER_03]: For the record, she does have a gorgeous voice.

1153
01:19:10,703 --> 01:19:10,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey!

1154
01:19:10,943 --> 01:19:11,524
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember I got...

1155
01:19:27,154 --> 01:19:34,000
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember I got dragged to an Amy Grant concert at the State Fair.

1156
01:19:34,460 --> 01:19:39,064
[SPEAKER_07]: I got dragged to one of those, and it was just not fun.

1157
01:19:39,104 --> 01:19:39,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you sing along?

1158
01:19:40,044 --> 01:19:40,845
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I didn't.

1159
01:19:41,145 --> 01:19:42,506
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not a fan of Amy Grant.

1160
01:19:43,107 --> 01:19:45,949
[SPEAKER_07]: I recognize that song, but I don't know any of her other songs.

1161
01:19:46,409 --> 01:19:53,455
[SPEAKER_03]: You know the only concert I've been taken to at a fair against my will was Michael Damien.

1162
01:19:53,715 --> 01:19:58,958
[SPEAKER_07]: I think literally that is the only concert I have seen at the State Fair is the Amy Grant one.

1163
01:19:59,038 --> 01:20:00,459
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't remember who opened it.

1164
01:20:00,519 --> 01:20:01,760
[SPEAKER_07]: It was another Christian artist.

1165
01:20:01,820 --> 01:20:03,181
[SPEAKER_03]: You haven't been to Sea Weird Al?

1166
01:20:03,501 --> 01:20:04,261
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I sadly haven't.

1167
01:20:04,281 --> 01:20:05,642
[SPEAKER_03]: You haven't been to Sea Weird Al?

1168
01:20:05,742 --> 01:20:06,503
[SPEAKER_03]: He's coming this year.

1169
01:20:06,523 --> 01:20:08,244
[SPEAKER_03]: I see Weird Al.

1170
01:20:08,704 --> 01:20:10,645
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a hundred and some degrees outside.

1171
01:20:10,685 --> 01:20:11,906
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't go outside for anybody.

1172
01:20:12,166 --> 01:20:12,927
[SPEAKER_07]: He can come to my house.

1173
01:20:14,688 --> 01:20:15,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie, Jamie.

1174
01:20:16,609 --> 01:20:19,110
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to Fresno to see Weird Al, so...

1175
01:20:20,253 --> 01:20:21,353
[SPEAKER_11]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1176
01:20:45,603 --> 01:20:47,463
[SPEAKER_11]: Hotline Miami, and Proteus.

1177
01:21:13,917 --> 01:21:18,401
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to get this just because I like indie games and I've pretty much gotten every other indie bundle.

1178
01:21:18,461 --> 01:21:19,221
[SPEAKER_11]: It's already got it.

1179
01:21:19,381 --> 01:21:19,682
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you?

1180
01:21:20,482 --> 01:21:21,563
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you checked out any of the games yet?

1181
01:21:22,504 --> 01:21:24,085
[SPEAKER_11]: They'll just sit there in my Steam library.

1182
01:21:24,686 --> 01:21:27,188
[SPEAKER_07]: I have now in my Steam library 126 games.

1183
01:21:27,348 --> 01:21:32,872
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's not all of them because I haven't bothered to put all of the Sonic the Hedgehog games in.

1184
01:21:33,213 --> 01:21:40,839
[SPEAKER_07]: I only because I bought the Sonic collection with every single Sonic the Hedgehog game that's on PC and I only put in Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing and Sonic Generations.

1185
01:21:40,939 --> 01:21:42,460
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't bother to put the rest of the ones.

1186
01:21:42,642 --> 01:21:44,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Sonic Generations is a damn good game.

1187
01:21:44,571 --> 01:22:14,112
[SPEAKER_11]: They also have, well you saw, I don't know if you saw They have a mod that actually, it's Sonic It converts it to the other Sonic 3D game that they had I don't remember I see TigerClaw in the chatroom saying Hotline Miami has a good soundtrack And the good news is you will also be able to get the soundtracks with these games DRM free downloads, Steam keys, Windows, Mac, and Linux versions For the record, for the record Whatever games that I don't keep out of this I'm more than happy to share with some of our listeners

1188
01:22:14,927 --> 01:22:23,510
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and, and, I should mention that they also have a humble weekly bundle that's going on right now that's all the Telltale series.

1189
01:22:23,530 --> 01:22:24,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, I saw that too.

1190
01:22:24,610 --> 01:22:26,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Which I also bought.

1191
01:22:26,230 --> 01:22:27,591
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are some great deals right now.

1192
01:22:27,611 --> 01:22:29,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Walking Dead, Sam & Max.

1193
01:22:29,972 --> 01:22:31,992
[SPEAKER_11]: Walking Dead alone is worth it if you don't already have it.

1194
01:22:32,012 --> 01:22:33,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, if you pay more than average, it's Walking Dead.

1195
01:22:33,953 --> 01:22:34,973
[SPEAKER_07]: You get Sam & Max.

1196
01:22:35,693 --> 01:22:36,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Also great.

1197
01:22:36,674 --> 01:22:37,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Back to the Future.

1198
01:22:37,674 --> 01:22:37,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

1199
01:22:39,135 --> 01:22:46,820
[SPEAKER_07]: Puzzle Agent, which I've never played, Waltzing Gromit, Poker Night, The Inventory, and... That's a lot.

1200
01:22:48,061 --> 01:22:49,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Jurassic Park?

1201
01:22:49,703 --> 01:22:50,363
[SPEAKER_07]: No Jurassic Park.

1202
01:22:50,383 --> 01:22:51,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably because of licensing.

1203
01:22:52,445 --> 01:22:52,965
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, anyhow.

1204
01:22:54,366 --> 01:22:55,427
[SPEAKER_11]: So look at stupid kids ruining everybody's fun.

1205
01:23:17,981 --> 01:23:21,144
[SPEAKER_11]: Stop DDOSing MMOs and kicking everybody off.

1206
01:23:21,164 --> 01:23:22,125
[SPEAKER_11]: This is trying to have a good time.

1207
01:23:22,445 --> 01:23:26,328
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, speaking of DDOS attacks, Bobby asked me to relay the following along.

1208
01:23:27,069 --> 01:23:32,314
[SPEAKER_11]: Should we lose the stream at some point during the show tonight, don't hit F5 to refresh the entire page.

1209
01:23:32,334 --> 01:23:35,396
[SPEAKER_11]: Because when you all do it at once, it's like a little mini DDOS attack.

1210
01:23:35,596 --> 01:23:39,440
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we're not on the servers as big as EVE Online or Dust514.

1211
01:23:39,740 --> 01:23:41,582
[SPEAKER_11]: We're running off a tin can that has some...

1212
01:23:42,402 --> 01:23:42,943
[SPEAKER_11]: Pause, unpause.

1213
01:23:42,963 --> 01:23:43,323
[SPEAKER_11]: Pause, unpause.

1214
01:23:58,592 --> 01:24:01,373
[SPEAKER_11]: And that will not do a DDoS attack on our little website.

1215
01:24:03,354 --> 01:24:08,297
[SPEAKER_11]: If you are a Vita owner, you'll be excited to know that Flower is coming to the Vita.

1216
01:24:08,898 --> 01:24:09,598
[SPEAKER_11]: This is awesome.

1217
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:10,679
[SPEAKER_11]: I love Flower.

1218
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:16,162
[SPEAKER_11]: I played it on the PlayStation 3, but I would say it's the best racing game I've played in a long time.

1219
01:24:16,542 --> 01:24:19,164
[SPEAKER_11]: Even though you would not think of Flower as a racing game.

1220
01:24:19,404 --> 01:24:20,125
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really great.

1221
01:24:21,045 --> 01:24:22,326
[SPEAKER_11]: Flower is going to be on the Vita.

1222
01:24:22,446 --> 01:24:25,168
[SPEAKER_11]: It will be one of the IndieCade games coming to E3.

1223
01:24:26,248 --> 01:24:26,788
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura

1224
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:45,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on, I'm saying that I only care about R-Type.

1225
01:24:46,703 --> 01:24:47,464
[SPEAKER_11]: What, in the chat room?

1226
01:24:47,504 --> 01:24:48,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Talking about Irem games.

1227
01:24:49,005 --> 01:24:49,746
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay, I'm sorry.

1228
01:24:49,926 --> 01:24:51,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Because R-Type is freaking great.

1229
01:24:51,607 --> 01:24:56,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, tell me that R-Type does not have the best first stage music of almost any game ever.

1230
01:24:57,832 --> 01:24:59,213
[SPEAKER_03]: If you said it doesn't, then you're lying.

1231
01:25:00,695 --> 01:25:00,895
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

1232
01:25:02,304 --> 01:25:10,248
[SPEAKER_03]: You Don't Know Jack is going to be on OUYA on June 11th and the Jackpad app will make your phone a controller.

1233
01:25:11,068 --> 01:25:20,453
[SPEAKER_03]: So folks who have OUYA's and an Android phone or an iOS will get to have a controller out of their phone.

1234
01:25:21,133 --> 01:25:21,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

1235
01:25:23,114 --> 01:25:23,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Aren't you special?

1236
01:25:25,215 --> 01:25:28,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Square Enix registered Final Fantasy Agito.

1237
01:25:29,298 --> 01:25:31,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is something that we heard at E3, what, five years ago?

1238
01:25:32,162 --> 01:25:32,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Six years ago?

1239
01:25:33,884 --> 01:25:34,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Eventually?

1240
01:25:35,366 --> 01:25:38,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they were supposed to do Final Fantasy Agito 13.

1241
01:25:39,431 --> 01:25:42,234
[SPEAKER_03]: So now they've got Final Fantasy Agito.

1242
01:25:42,895 --> 01:25:43,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Hooray.

1243
01:25:43,356 --> 01:25:43,656
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

1244
01:25:43,676 --> 01:25:45,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect question for Bobby Blackwolf.

1245
01:25:45,979 --> 01:25:46,800
[SPEAKER_07]: So where's Versus 13?

1246
01:25:49,366 --> 01:25:50,487
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, a question for the screeners?

1247
01:25:50,807 --> 01:25:53,008
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, here's the thing.

1248
01:25:54,229 --> 01:25:56,450
[SPEAKER_11]: Either that's going to be answered once E3 starts.

1249
01:25:57,190 --> 01:26:00,212
[SPEAKER_11]: I kind of think it's a game that has to show up in one way or another.

1250
01:26:00,272 --> 01:26:05,935
[SPEAKER_11]: Whether it's true that they moved it to 15 or what, I kind of think you'll have something on that well before the show starts.

1251
01:26:06,375 --> 01:26:12,338
[SPEAKER_11]: But let's say they do announce Final Fantasy Versus XIII and you want to know, is lightning in it?

1252
01:26:12,638 --> 01:26:13,899
[SPEAKER_11]: Or something that they don't say.

1253
01:26:13,959 --> 01:26:14,279
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1254
01:26:14,619 --> 01:26:16,080
[SPEAKER_11]: You could go ask that question.

1255
01:26:16,431 --> 01:26:17,372
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1256
01:26:37,125 --> 01:26:38,325
[SPEAKER_03]: It's getting a Steam release date.

1257
01:26:38,605 --> 01:26:41,626
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be out today already.

1258
01:26:42,326 --> 01:26:42,946
[SPEAKER_03]: July 2nd.

1259
01:26:44,146 --> 01:26:46,367
[SPEAKER_03]: As announced by developer Two Tribes.

1260
01:26:47,147 --> 01:26:50,728
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the PC version is a Steam workshop integration and achievements.

1261
01:26:51,708 --> 01:26:58,089
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's also a level editor that was promised for Wii U and well, they don't have that yet.

1262
01:26:58,849 --> 01:26:59,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Gee!

1263
01:26:59,829 --> 01:27:01,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Nintendo and online?

1264
01:27:01,510 --> 01:27:03,590
[SPEAKER_11]: It's coming soon, trademark patent pending.

1265
01:27:04,741 --> 01:27:05,922
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what else is coming soon?

1266
01:27:05,962 --> 01:27:07,082
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, you know what, though?

1267
01:27:07,122 --> 01:27:15,567
[SPEAKER_11]: At this point, if the Xbox One Connect is going to watch me poop, then, like, give me the Wii U and its outdated technology, all right?

1268
01:27:17,168 --> 01:27:17,688
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1269
01:27:18,849 --> 01:27:26,814
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to go home and hook up the Turbo Duo and play me some freaking Dracula X and not worry about my system watching me in my pajamas.

1270
01:27:27,054 --> 01:27:27,394
[SPEAKER_03]: The end.

1271
01:27:30,057 --> 01:27:30,838
[SPEAKER_11]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1272
01:27:48,542 --> 01:27:50,684
[SPEAKER_03]: The Connect did while it was watching you poop.

1273
01:27:52,365 --> 01:27:54,146
[SPEAKER_11]: No, seriously guys, I don't have my theme music.

1274
01:27:54,166 --> 01:27:55,107
[SPEAKER_11]: Help me fill time.

1275
01:27:56,728 --> 01:27:57,669
[SPEAKER_11]: No, not by singing.

1276
01:27:58,970 --> 01:28:00,231
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to hear me sing anyway.

1277
01:28:02,232 --> 01:28:03,273
[SPEAKER_03]: I want that game.

1278
01:28:04,734 --> 01:28:06,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Go to Square Enix and tell them to give it to me.

1279
01:28:08,157 --> 01:28:09,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell them to give me the zero.

1280
01:28:09,918 --> 01:28:10,539
[SPEAKER_03]: I want it.

1281
01:28:11,379 --> 01:28:12,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't you just import it?

1282
01:28:12,940 --> 01:28:16,103
[SPEAKER_03]: So what exactly is the downside for... I don't think I can read it.

1283
01:28:16,747 --> 01:28:19,494
[SPEAKER_07]: Not voting on Steam Greenlight titles.

1284
01:28:19,574 --> 01:28:20,576
[SPEAKER_07]: I never understood that.

1285
01:28:22,179 --> 01:28:23,623
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't get your little mini-achievement?

1286
01:28:24,111 --> 01:28:28,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyhow, I would love to answer Loki's question, but I found music.

1287
01:28:57,998 --> 01:28:59,099
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1288
01:29:21,795 --> 01:29:30,062
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, anyhow, although I'm not going to get into all the details on Final Fantasy IX because it sounds complicated, this had us thinking about rediscovering things in classic games.

1289
01:29:30,482 --> 01:29:34,625
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you ever revisited an old game years after its release to find something new?

1290
01:29:35,045 --> 01:29:36,146
[SPEAKER_11]: Go back and complete it at 100%?

1291
01:29:37,187 --> 01:29:44,072
[SPEAKER_11]: What classic game did you revisit after many years, not necessarily to play it for the first time, but to try and discover new things inside it?

1292
01:29:45,051 --> 01:29:45,752
[SPEAKER_11]: DRAGON BOSS GRAPPLING BEAM

1293
01:30:00,883 --> 01:30:01,623
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty neat stuff.

1294
01:30:01,663 --> 01:30:04,364
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess it's common knowledge to many, but I had no idea.

1295
01:30:04,745 --> 01:30:05,965
[SPEAKER_11]: And he linked us a little YouTube.

1296
01:30:06,445 --> 01:30:09,326
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, there's a lot of ways you can kind of trick that game.

1297
01:30:09,366 --> 01:30:12,307
[SPEAKER_11]: You can do like wall jumps and get past places you're not supposed to.

1298
01:30:12,588 --> 01:30:15,349
[SPEAKER_11]: There's lots of little ways you can kind of like trick it and beat the system.

1299
01:30:15,769 --> 01:30:16,709
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's one of the really cool.

1300
01:30:17,209 --> 01:30:21,791
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what makes part of what makes Super Metroid the best ever.

1301
01:30:22,271 --> 01:30:28,053
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's where you could get to the top of the castle by doing the double jump and get your final star in Super Mario 64.

1302
01:30:28,193 --> 01:30:28,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Just saying.

1303
01:30:30,980 --> 01:30:43,837
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, Tiara responds and says, I've actually been replaying Final Fantasy IX for the past several weeks and I never knew about this side quest until I stumbled upon the info while looking for Chocobo hot and cold treasure locations.

1304
01:30:44,618 --> 01:30:46,180
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to be one of the first to see it.

1305
01:30:47,620 --> 01:30:53,722
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry for the Facebook noise, but I'm actually on Facebook trying to read these answers.

1306
01:30:54,302 --> 01:31:01,545
[SPEAKER_11]: Trust me when I say it is harder than the first quest.

1307
01:31:01,805 --> 01:31:02,145
[SPEAKER_11]: Really?

1308
01:31:02,245 --> 01:31:02,805
[SPEAKER_11]: That is true.

1309
01:31:03,265 --> 01:31:05,906
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, a lot of people go back and beat retro games.

1310
01:31:06,746 --> 01:31:07,586
[SPEAKER_03]: It is harder than the first quest.

1311
01:31:07,606 --> 01:31:13,028
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the record, for anyone who wants to do it without beating the game first, just type in Zelda for your name.

1312
01:31:13,168 --> 01:31:13,568
[SPEAKER_11]: That is true.

1313
01:31:14,168 --> 01:31:16,669
[SPEAKER_11]: Zelda's another one of those games where you don't have to have every item.

1314
01:31:16,889 --> 01:31:18,129
[SPEAKER_11]: You can get around some of this stuff.

1315
01:31:18,330 --> 01:31:20,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, you could get through the whole game with a wooden sword, I think.

1316
01:31:21,470 --> 01:31:25,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't forget to walk headfirst into walls because you never know which one's invisible.

1317
01:31:25,211 --> 01:31:25,712
[SPEAKER_11]: You never know.

1318
01:31:26,312 --> 01:31:26,572
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1319
01:31:27,612 --> 01:31:28,012
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

1320
01:31:28,773 --> 01:31:36,395
[SPEAKER_11]: Andy R. replied and said, I replayed Okami earlier this year thanks to the HDification version and I found a lot of things I didn't find the first time.

1321
01:31:36,515 --> 01:31:40,296
[SPEAKER_11]: Things such as the hidden spider bosses or some of the advanced forms of the brush techniques.

1322
01:31:40,916 --> 01:31:48,102
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, knowing what happens in the story before I started made me more cognizant of the foreshadowing I missed the first time I played the game, which was kind of cool.

1323
01:31:49,143 --> 01:31:52,306
[SPEAKER_11]: Mary B. replied with another Final Fantasy answer.

1324
01:31:52,346 --> 01:31:58,671
[SPEAKER_11]: Final Fantasy VIII learned how to crazy attack with Squall's two-hour, whatever it was, and that it was stronger than his summit.

1325
01:31:58,751 --> 01:32:02,695
[SPEAKER_11]: Did they have two-hour abilities in Final Fantasy VIII, or was that your Final Fantasy XI addiction talking?

1326
01:32:03,355 --> 01:32:04,756
[SPEAKER_11]: after getting stuck on Bahamut.

1327
01:32:05,176 --> 01:32:08,058
[SPEAKER_11]: I had to come back to a save down to Bahamut after not playing for months.

1328
01:32:08,478 --> 01:32:11,480
[SPEAKER_11]: Final Fantasy X and X-2 just for fun because I like them so much.

1329
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:13,621
[SPEAKER_11]: Use strategy guide to get 100% though.

1330
01:32:14,742 --> 01:32:19,885
[SPEAKER_11]: Ragenator said, well, at least prior to my PS3 being stolen, I regularly went back and played older classics.

1331
01:32:20,245 --> 01:32:25,609
[SPEAKER_11]: The closest thing to discovering something new was in terms of tactics for situations where I got stuck in the past.

1332
01:32:26,269 --> 01:32:26,549
[SPEAKER_11]: GameFAQs

1333
01:32:47,346 --> 01:32:52,549
[SPEAKER_11]: I knew fatalities, not sure all, were possible without the blood code, so I tried it out with Kano.

1334
01:32:52,849 --> 01:32:54,970
[SPEAKER_11]: To my surprise, Kano managed to do his finishing move.

1335
01:32:55,250 --> 01:32:58,612
[SPEAKER_11]: However, instead of a heart, he pulled out an organ that was dark colored.

1336
01:32:58,932 --> 01:33:01,533
[SPEAKER_11]: I can only assume that he pulled out his opponent's liver.

1337
01:33:02,934 --> 01:33:04,355
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an evil thing and must be destroyed.

1338
01:33:04,755 --> 01:33:09,978
[SPEAKER_11]: Even with no blood code, Mortal Kombat surprised me with the amount of gore it was still able to show on the consoles.

1339
01:33:11,058 --> 01:33:15,602
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, going over to Google Plus and some of the answers there.

1340
01:33:16,883 --> 01:33:18,205
[SPEAKER_11]: Were there no answers on Google Plus?

1341
01:33:18,585 --> 01:33:19,466
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, no, there's two, sorry.

1342
01:33:19,866 --> 01:33:22,068
[SPEAKER_11]: Google Plus changed and now I can't find things.

1343
01:33:22,108 --> 01:33:28,034
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, Red Entertainment says, I remember me and my best friend as a kid trying and failing to beat Mega Man 2 on the NES.

1344
01:33:28,434 --> 01:33:34,960
[SPEAKER_11]: No matter how many different times or many different ways we tried to beat the game, we could never get past one particular part in Dr. Wily's Fortress at the end.

1345
01:33:35,340 --> 01:33:36,722
[SPEAKER_11]: It wasn't until I was older...

1346
01:33:37,062 --> 01:33:44,925
[SPEAKER_11]: Bought the Mega Man Collection on PS2 and had access to online walkthroughs that I finally got the item you needed in order to proceed past that one particular part.

1347
01:33:45,285 --> 01:33:49,586
[SPEAKER_11]: When I finally beat that game, it felt like I was giving my eight-year-old self a figurative high-five.

1348
01:33:49,967 --> 01:33:53,028
[SPEAKER_11]: Not a literal high-five because that would break the space-time continuum.

1349
01:33:53,948 --> 01:34:00,830
[SPEAKER_11]: and lastly Travis H on Google Plus says I found myself overjoyed with the amount of PS1 and PSP games I can replay on my Vita.

1350
01:34:01,170 --> 01:34:07,492
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm right now in the middle of playing Wild Arms trying to complete it to its fullest and find things that I missed the first time around.

1351
01:34:07,793 --> 01:34:14,795
[SPEAKER_11]: It is very refreshing to go back in an older age and enjoy the simple things as the dialogue and some humor you may not have got when you were younger.

1352
01:34:15,055 --> 01:34:16,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk about a good soundtrack by the way.

1353
01:34:20,478 --> 01:34:21,781
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

1354
01:34:29,492 --> 01:34:56,906
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my gosh, alright, there you go Thank you to the folks that answered the Facebook question of the week and the Google Plus question of the week Answer in a future week I want to say quickly though about that last answer was very similar to one of the Facebook answers and a couple things we were hearing is that these HD remakes really seem to get people to go back and play them again and I kind of find that to be true too is that when the things get re-released it's like a reason for me to go back I had never tried to beat Mario 2 with just one character before

1355
01:34:57,446 --> 01:34:59,206
[SPEAKER_11]: So that was something I kind of did that was new this week.

1356
01:34:59,467 --> 01:35:00,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Try doing it with Toad.

1357
01:35:01,927 --> 01:35:03,708
[SPEAKER_11]: The desert levels would be manageable.

1358
01:35:03,988 --> 01:35:10,389
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually, I only use Toad in the desert levels for the most part, but I did, now this was, keep in mind, when I was a kid, I did a full playthrough with Toad.

1359
01:35:11,569 --> 01:35:14,670
[SPEAKER_03]: And you would be surprised at the number of coins you get.

1360
01:35:15,230 --> 01:35:17,151
[SPEAKER_03]: I was playing the stupid bonus game for ages.

1361
01:35:17,351 --> 01:35:19,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you have a faster dig.

1362
01:35:21,052 --> 01:35:23,052
[SPEAKER_11]: SSJ100, Matt to the rescue in the chat room.

1363
01:35:23,592 --> 01:35:25,373
[SPEAKER_11]: A-B-A-C-A-B-B.

1364
01:35:25,693 --> 01:35:26,413
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the blood code.

1365
01:35:27,284 --> 01:35:27,684
[SPEAKER_11]: ABA, CABB, Abacab

1366
01:35:46,543 --> 01:35:50,224
[SPEAKER_07]: The next Kickstarter for Double Fine has been launched.

1367
01:35:50,304 --> 01:35:53,626
[SPEAKER_07]: They're a brand new game called Massive Chalice.

1368
01:35:54,206 --> 01:36:01,989
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's kind of a cross between a feudal fantasy tactical strategy game with this weird...

1369
01:36:04,440 --> 01:36:25,744
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess they're saying there's like permanent death in the game so you have to create new characters by breeding them I guess so yeah that's gonna be coming I guess and it looks interesting they're most likely gonna hit their goal since they're at 677,500 right now and their goal is 725,000 and they've got 24 days to go so most likely they're gonna make it so yeah

1370
01:36:35,953 --> 01:36:36,233
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1371
01:36:36,473 --> 01:36:37,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Looks interesting.

1372
01:36:37,754 --> 01:36:42,036
[SPEAKER_07]: It's being headed up, I guess, by the guy that did Iron Brigade, Brad Muir.

1373
01:36:44,858 --> 01:36:51,141
[SPEAKER_11]: Speaking of Kickstarter stuff, by the way, the Zelda Kickstarter we had, that guy on the show a couple weeks ago, didn't make it.

1374
01:36:51,641 --> 01:36:52,042
[SPEAKER_11]: Didn't make it.

1375
01:36:52,062 --> 01:36:53,582
[SPEAKER_11]: Bummer.

1376
01:36:53,662 --> 01:37:01,086
[SPEAKER_11]: He says he has some other plans, though, and good luck to him with plan B. I think you gotta have a plan B when you go into this Kickstarter thing, because I think it's like...

1377
01:37:02,327 --> 01:37:05,389
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's like going viral.

1378
01:37:05,809 --> 01:37:09,372
[SPEAKER_11]: These ad agencies will hire people saying, we need you to make a viral ad.

1379
01:37:09,712 --> 01:37:13,475
[SPEAKER_11]: But sometimes, either it's going to catch or it's not.

1380
01:37:13,595 --> 01:37:15,176
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's not that it's necessarily bad.

1381
01:37:16,257 --> 01:37:17,698
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes it happens and sometimes it doesn't.

1382
01:37:18,018 --> 01:37:22,921
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, when you're double fine and you have that name recognition, well, the money's going to come to them pretty easy.

1383
01:37:23,401 --> 01:37:29,926
[SPEAKER_11]: But unfortunately for the Zelda movie and all that, it just didn't catch on for whatever reason.

1384
01:37:30,006 --> 01:37:31,047
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's going to happen sometimes.

1385
01:37:31,067 --> 01:37:31,487
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1386
01:37:32,557 --> 01:37:38,385
[SPEAKER_11]: Good luck to him with whatever he decides to do with his plan B. That makes me quite sad.

1387
01:37:38,585 --> 01:37:39,386
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's unfortunate.

1388
01:37:39,606 --> 01:37:40,087
[SPEAKER_11]: Very unfortunate.

1389
01:37:40,187 --> 01:37:42,771
[SPEAKER_11]: I had put in some money, but I got it back.

1390
01:37:43,432 --> 01:37:45,334
[SPEAKER_11]: Or I should say they never charged it, because that's what happens.

1391
01:37:45,374 --> 01:37:46,856
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't charge you until it goes through, so...

1392
01:37:47,857 --> 01:37:51,361
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, going to some news for the 3DS.

1393
01:37:51,961 --> 01:37:55,685
[SPEAKER_11]: The 3D Sonic that I remember we talked about was rumored a couple weeks ago.

1394
01:37:56,285 --> 01:38:00,509
[SPEAKER_11]: Apparently it is something that's happening because the Australian Classification Board issued ratings.

1395
01:38:00,990 --> 01:38:03,152
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you gotta love when the ratings board spoils games.

1396
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:10,058
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, not only did they roll out a 3D Sonic the Hedgehog rating, but they also rolled out a 3D Altered Beast rating.

1397
01:38:11,279 --> 01:38:35,244
[SPEAKER_03]: apparently 3D Space Harrier, 3D Super Hang-On Space Harrier these are all out in Japan already but the fact that they're rated in Australia means they're probably coming around to the rest of the world too which by the way if I am right and they're the same as the Sega Ages what was it I imported like three of them I had the Phantasy Star, the Phantasy Zone and Space Harrier they're really good if it's in the same line

1398
01:38:35,424 --> 01:38:36,425
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, these will be 3D.

1399
01:38:36,685 --> 01:38:37,325
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the thing.

1400
01:38:37,565 --> 01:38:41,027
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm all about Space Harrier, Super Hang-On, yeah, Sonic, yeah, Altered Beast.

1401
01:38:41,107 --> 01:38:49,651
[SPEAKER_11]: Look, Altered Beast is one of those games that is... Everybody remembers that, and in people's memories, it's awesome, but I played through the game not that long ago.

1402
01:38:49,891 --> 01:38:50,511
[SPEAKER_11]: It sucks.

1403
01:38:51,332 --> 01:38:52,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Altered Beast sucks.

1404
01:38:52,812 --> 01:38:53,653
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry to say it.

1405
01:38:54,013 --> 01:38:56,214
[SPEAKER_11]: It is not aged well whatsoever.

1406
01:38:56,494 --> 01:38:58,415
[SPEAKER_11]: When I was 12, that game was the shit.

1407
01:38:58,615 --> 01:39:00,116
[SPEAKER_11]: When I'm 34, not so much.

1408
01:39:00,276 --> 01:39:01,397
[SPEAKER_11]: We need a Marvel Madness.

1409
01:39:02,077 --> 01:39:03,218
[SPEAKER_11]: We do need a Marvel Madness.

1410
01:39:03,238 --> 01:39:03,818
[SPEAKER_11]: That wasn't Sega.

1411
01:39:04,318 --> 01:39:05,679
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care though, it would be awesome.

1412
01:39:06,099 --> 01:39:07,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't it Williams or Midway?

1413
01:39:08,381 --> 01:39:09,462
[SPEAKER_11]: It was Atari.

1414
01:39:09,802 --> 01:39:10,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Atari.

1415
01:39:10,802 --> 01:39:14,465
[SPEAKER_11]: Which their arcade division got snapped up by Midway, I believe.

1416
01:39:14,485 --> 01:39:15,446
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's what I'm thinking of.

1417
01:39:16,306 --> 01:39:18,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Which in turn then got snapped up by Warner.

1418
01:39:18,988 --> 01:39:20,849
[SPEAKER_03]: The game's great if you've got a trackball to play it with.

1419
01:39:22,290 --> 01:39:25,372
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it could do something with the touchpad, who knows.

1420
01:39:26,293 --> 01:39:28,014
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

1421
01:39:29,039 --> 01:39:30,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, as soon as I can get it up, there we go.

1422
01:39:31,341 --> 01:39:33,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Gianna Sisters Twisted Dreams developer.

1423
01:39:34,363 --> 01:39:35,204
[SPEAKER_03]: We like them, don't we?

1424
01:39:35,244 --> 01:39:37,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they gave us that wonderful series back, didn't they?

1425
01:39:38,906 --> 01:39:39,987
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Black Forest Games.

1426
01:39:40,447 --> 01:39:42,849
[SPEAKER_03]: They've announced another game called Ravensdale.

1427
01:39:43,370 --> 01:39:49,134
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a four-player co-op side-scrolling platform shooter set in a medieval oil rig city.

1428
01:39:50,393 --> 01:39:55,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking at the screen capture here, it's pretty grimy, very oily looking.

1429
01:39:57,818 --> 01:40:03,622
[SPEAKER_03]: They wanted it to be an action RPG, but publishers were saying that Steampunk doesn't sell.

1430
01:40:04,203 --> 01:40:09,867
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why they are... It looks like they've changed the method of this.

1431
01:40:09,887 --> 01:40:11,788
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, has anyone else heard anything about this?

1432
01:40:13,609 --> 01:40:15,490
[SPEAKER_11]: No, not this particular game.

1433
01:40:15,751 --> 01:40:16,191
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it was...

1434
01:40:16,519 --> 01:40:21,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there are likelihoods saying that we're going to see a Kickstarter in about a month or two.

1435
01:40:22,484 --> 01:40:26,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Since they're not finding a publisher, they're going to go the Gianna Sisters route.

1436
01:40:26,727 --> 01:40:29,610
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, if judging by Gianna Sisters, it's probably going to be good.

1437
01:40:30,471 --> 01:40:32,552
[SPEAKER_03]: So, they got a good track record.

1438
01:40:33,673 --> 01:40:34,054
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, yes.

1439
01:40:34,114 --> 01:40:35,415
[SPEAKER_11]: I still need to play that Twisted Dreams.

1440
01:40:35,475 --> 01:40:45,423
[SPEAKER_11]: It's one of those games that's like in my queue waiting to play, but I loved the Commodore 64 one, even though, yes, it was kind of the Mario Brothers ripoff, but soundtrack is part of what I remember most fondly, but

1441
01:40:45,737 --> 01:40:46,539
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty good.

1442
01:40:46,859 --> 01:40:49,624
[SPEAKER_07]: I have it downloaded, but I played it like once.

1443
01:40:50,606 --> 01:40:52,029
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I went back to Saints Row the 3rd.

1444
01:40:53,652 --> 01:40:54,714
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not like Saints Row the 3rd.

1445
01:40:56,257 --> 01:40:56,838
[SPEAKER_07]: What's wrong with you?

1446
01:40:58,740 --> 01:41:00,682
[SPEAKER_03]: I just didn't like how the game started off.

1447
01:41:00,702 --> 01:41:01,503
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so funny.

1448
01:41:02,083 --> 01:41:03,445
[SPEAKER_11]: I laughed and laughed.

1449
01:41:03,465 --> 01:41:05,287
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you get to the part where they're skydiving out of the plane?

1450
01:41:05,707 --> 01:41:08,170
[SPEAKER_11]: You gotta at least get that far, because I died.

1451
01:41:08,210 --> 01:41:08,970
[SPEAKER_11]: It was so funny.

1452
01:41:09,951 --> 01:41:11,673
[SPEAKER_03]: I just found I didn't like the control, that's all.

1453
01:41:13,195 --> 01:41:15,557
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, I didn't like Mass Effect the first time I played it, just saying.

1454
01:41:17,019 --> 01:41:17,860
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, what do you have for us?

1455
01:41:18,765 --> 01:41:27,988
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's some more announcements coming from Japan for the Wii U. First off, the Wii U is now going to be available in white for the 32GB premium set.

1456
01:41:28,428 --> 01:41:30,249
[SPEAKER_07]: That's starting July 13th.

1457
01:41:30,969 --> 01:41:34,370
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess it'll be available in black and white since they already have the black to begin with.

1458
01:41:34,950 --> 01:41:36,771
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, of course, they're going to be...

1459
01:41:39,457 --> 01:41:45,761
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess doing some sort of... And I'm surprised it's taking so goddamn long for this.

1460
01:41:45,861 --> 01:41:52,304
[SPEAKER_07]: But they're doing... Well, first they have a larger capacity battery for the Wii U gamepad.

1461
01:41:52,485 --> 01:41:56,767
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's going to be 2500 mAh instead of 1500 mAh.

1462
01:41:57,127 --> 01:42:02,430
[SPEAKER_07]: Which will, I guess, equal to 5 to 8 hours of gameplay.

1463
01:42:02,650 --> 01:42:03,771
[SPEAKER_07]: As opposed to 3 to 5.

1464
01:42:04,211 --> 01:42:05,012
[SPEAKER_07]: And then on top of that...

1465
01:42:05,512 --> 01:42:13,092
[SPEAKER_07]: They're having official Wii Remote charge battery packs for it.

1466
01:42:14,107 --> 01:42:14,848
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1467
01:42:37,383 --> 01:42:37,723
[SPEAKER_07]: and DarkSakura.

1468
01:42:50,503 --> 01:42:54,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Crypt of the NecroDancer Crypt of the NecroDancer

1469
01:43:19,942 --> 01:43:27,659
[SPEAKER_11]: It is a rogue-like game, which is, you know, like a dungeon crawler, like if you think way, way, way back to the old Terminal Game Rogue.

1470
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:29,764
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's mixed with a music game.

1471
01:43:31,092 --> 01:43:33,634
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a hardcore rhythm-based roguelike.

1472
01:43:35,455 --> 01:43:44,222
[SPEAKER_11]: Notable game composers Danny B and Alec Holowaka are working with Crypt of the NecroDancer, which I think is awesome.

1473
01:43:44,282 --> 01:43:46,523
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can also load your own MP3s into the game if you want.

1474
01:43:46,644 --> 01:43:48,065
[SPEAKER_11]: Although, I don't know how well that will work.

1475
01:43:48,605 --> 01:43:49,225
[SPEAKER_11]: But there you go.

1476
01:43:50,326 --> 01:43:51,627
[SPEAKER_11]: That looks awesome.

1477
01:43:52,068 --> 01:43:56,571
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can check that out at NecroDancer.com Very cool.

1478
01:43:57,772 --> 01:43:59,233
[SPEAKER_11]: I like both those types of games.

1479
01:43:59,253 --> 01:44:00,594
[SPEAKER_11]: That's like a game made for Rob.

1480
01:44:01,058 --> 01:44:02,900
[SPEAKER_11]: Dungeon Crawler meets DDR.

1481
01:44:03,060 --> 01:44:03,361
[SPEAKER_11]: Love it.

1482
01:44:05,022 --> 01:44:06,003
[SPEAKER_11]: I just need my dance pad.

1483
01:44:06,544 --> 01:44:09,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's get to our mailbag.

1484
01:44:09,307 --> 01:44:13,391
[SPEAKER_11]: Every week you guys send us emails and DarkSakura reads some of her favorites here on the show.

1485
01:44:14,292 --> 01:44:18,917
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, she's got a couple weeks to catch up on with no official show last week and so forth.

1486
01:44:19,198 --> 01:44:19,338
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

1487
01:44:21,471 --> 01:44:22,712
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, she was trying to sew.

1488
01:44:22,732 --> 01:44:24,273
[SPEAKER_03]: No, one of my stitches came out.

1489
01:44:24,333 --> 01:44:26,174
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually broke when I flipped the foot inside out.

1490
01:44:26,814 --> 01:44:28,235
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I was trying to fix it real quick.

1491
01:44:28,495 --> 01:44:30,036
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I had time before mailbag.

1492
01:44:30,296 --> 01:44:30,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well.

1493
01:44:31,016 --> 01:44:33,077
[SPEAKER_03]: So, a freaking ton of mail.

1494
01:44:34,498 --> 01:44:35,999
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of it's in Mandarin Chinese.

1495
01:44:36,679 --> 01:44:37,680
[SPEAKER_03]: So, let's skip all those.

1496
01:44:37,700 --> 01:44:38,660
[SPEAKER_11]: That was the spam.

1497
01:44:39,160 --> 01:44:39,961
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the spam.

1498
01:44:40,381 --> 01:44:44,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Except for the stuff in French, which I could actually read, but I don't really care about boobs that much.

1499
01:44:44,663 --> 01:44:45,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Spam-durin'.

1500
01:44:47,771 --> 01:44:48,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Womp womp.

1501
01:44:49,612 --> 01:44:52,454
[SPEAKER_03]: So this comes from Rababababa.

1502
01:44:52,814 --> 01:44:55,855
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed the Curiosity game from 22 Kansas approaching the center.

1503
01:44:56,476 --> 01:45:00,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's a countdown on each cube and I believe it was at 13 when I wrote this on Monday.

1504
01:45:00,678 --> 01:45:02,719
[SPEAKER_03]: I made my final cynical conclusions about it.

1505
01:45:02,759 --> 01:45:03,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, we've already done a big reveal.

1506
01:45:04,580 --> 01:45:06,400
[SPEAKER_03]: But I like reading this stuff.

1507
01:45:07,240 --> 01:45:10,301
[SPEAKER_03]: It appears the cubes do not get smaller as you get closer to the center.

1508
01:45:10,801 --> 01:45:12,681
[SPEAKER_03]: It isn't fun, not even as bubble wrap.

1509
01:45:12,721 --> 01:45:16,822
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets boring easily, and after I toyed with it once or twice, I'm content to just see it end.

1510
01:45:17,542 --> 01:45:19,303
[SPEAKER_03]: The payoff at the end will be disappointing.

1511
01:45:19,363 --> 01:45:21,803
[SPEAKER_03]: The life-changing promise is way too large a nebulous.

1512
01:45:22,343 --> 01:45:23,643
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the word nebulous, by the way.

1513
01:45:24,283 --> 01:45:26,444
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope the center is remember to drink your Ovaltine.

1514
01:45:27,024 --> 01:45:29,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay pound zero zero zero zero zero zero.

1515
01:45:30,224 --> 01:45:32,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, you know what that is.

1516
01:45:33,826 --> 01:45:34,326
[SPEAKER_11]: Stay Black.

1517
01:45:34,426 --> 01:45:34,827
[SPEAKER_11]: Stay Black.

1518
01:45:59,941 --> 01:46:07,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I realized simply Xbox was literally the last name I expected, so they chose the pen's ultimate name of all I could come up with.

1519
01:46:07,866 --> 01:46:19,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Overall, the name is pretty good, as it conveys multiple meanings, is easy to remember and understandable, unlike Wii and Wii U, which sound dumb, even repulsive, and conveyed no obvious meaning.

1520
01:46:19,994 --> 01:46:22,275
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't expect a lot of debate over what a terrible name 1 is.

1521
01:46:23,636 --> 01:46:24,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it have good games?

1522
01:46:25,237 --> 01:46:26,378
[SPEAKER_03]: At this point, I don't really care.

1523
01:46:27,039 --> 01:46:31,162
[SPEAKER_03]: All I know is that there aren't many good games coming out for any system at the moment.

1524
01:46:31,642 --> 01:46:40,288
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll stop making games for PS4 and Xbox 360 very soon, and new consoles will be my only choice for new games on console.

1525
01:46:40,849 --> 01:46:41,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Used games?

1526
01:46:41,349 --> 01:46:45,292
[SPEAKER_03]: If I can't trade or give used games away, I will probably not buy discs at all.

1527
01:46:46,013 --> 01:46:48,574
[SPEAKER_03]: I also believe this is how EA will implement Game Pass.

1528
01:46:49,455 --> 01:46:50,936
[SPEAKER_03]: The game DVR is interesting.

1529
01:46:51,016 --> 01:46:55,478
[SPEAKER_03]: It requires online to share, so I suspect this will be an exclusive gold feature.

1530
01:46:56,739 --> 01:47:02,382
[SPEAKER_03]: I also expect that certain games will not be allowed on this feature, even GASP not allow certain parts to be recorded.

1531
01:47:02,762 --> 01:47:03,963
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I'll bug you with today.

1532
01:47:06,564 --> 01:47:12,067
[SPEAKER_03]: And this comes from Elliot B. It's the Oculus Rift report.

1533
01:47:13,588 --> 01:47:18,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Dear OLR, this week I was lucky enough to get some hands-on time with the most exciting hardware release of the year.

1534
01:47:18,970 --> 01:47:22,211
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not the PS4 or Xbox One, I'm of course talking about the Oculus Rift.

1535
01:47:22,871 --> 01:47:29,213
[SPEAKER_03]: For those who don't know, the Rift is a VR headset with low-latency head tracking, providing an immersive 3D experience, in theory at least.

1536
01:47:29,913 --> 01:47:34,935
[SPEAKER_03]: While the reality doesn't quite yet live up to the hype, it's still an impressive device, even for a prototype.

1537
01:47:35,575 --> 01:47:37,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Oculus have got the basics down pat.

1538
01:47:38,876 --> 01:47:42,337
[SPEAKER_03]: The headset is easy to set up, weighs nothing, and lag is unnoticeable.

1539
01:47:42,878 --> 01:47:47,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, there is still a pretty major issue standing between the Rift and the mainstream success.

1540
01:47:47,960 --> 01:47:51,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Movement with standard FPS controls produce instant motion sickness.

1541
01:47:52,441 --> 01:47:57,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Even the peaceful Italian villa demo is nauseating, let alone a fast-paced shooter.

1542
01:47:57,543 --> 01:47:58,604
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, you have been warned.

1543
01:47:58,744 --> 01:47:59,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1544
01:48:00,453 --> 01:48:07,238
[SPEAKER_03]: My thinking is that rather than adapting existing games for the Rift, devs will need to keep in mind its weaknesses as well as strengths.

1545
01:48:07,778 --> 01:48:12,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Still experiencing the Rift for the first time is a breathtaking experience, even despite its teething problems.

1546
01:48:13,662 --> 01:48:17,965
[SPEAKER_03]: To be any more than a novelty, it now needs some equally breathtaking custom-built games.

1547
01:48:18,125 --> 01:48:19,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Yours virtually, Elliot B.

1548
01:48:21,274 --> 01:48:21,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Elliot.

1549
01:48:21,914 --> 01:48:23,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Good lord, everybody, why are you writing me novels?

1550
01:48:24,636 --> 01:48:24,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1551
01:48:25,577 --> 01:48:30,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Dear OLR, I would like to take this moment to thank Microsoft from the bottom of my heart for the Xbox One announcement.

1552
01:48:30,380 --> 01:48:35,883
[SPEAKER_03]: The amount of money I'll be saving by skipping their draconian, unattractive Kinect mandatory disaster is enormous.

1553
01:48:36,804 --> 01:48:41,589
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's funny, I was worried about skipping this generation because I was afraid the PS4 was going to blow major chunks.

1554
01:48:42,369 --> 01:48:45,232
[SPEAKER_03]: I even bought a Wii U out of that fear.

1555
01:48:45,612 --> 01:48:51,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead, it seems Microsoft is going into the junior year slump that seems to happen with any successful console manufacturer.

1556
01:48:52,439 --> 01:48:58,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, first it was Nintendo with the N64, then Sony with the PS3, now Microsoft with the Xbox One.

1557
01:48:58,644 --> 01:48:59,926
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, lamest name ever.

1558
01:49:00,586 --> 01:49:02,108
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting quite a bit of...

1559
01:49:05,633 --> 01:49:11,715
[SPEAKER_11]: The PS3, though, it started off like a great comedy of errors, but after a couple of years, it got better and better.

1560
01:49:11,735 --> 01:49:12,675
[SPEAKER_03]: It grew into itself.

1561
01:49:12,735 --> 01:49:13,015
[SPEAKER_03]: It did.

1562
01:49:13,615 --> 01:49:14,835
[SPEAKER_03]: It fits its big boy pants.

1563
01:49:14,996 --> 01:49:16,736
[SPEAKER_11]: Nintendo 64 had its moments.

1564
01:49:18,016 --> 01:49:20,077
[SPEAKER_11]: I wouldn't call Nintendo 64 a flop.

1565
01:49:20,357 --> 01:49:21,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Pokemon Snap.

1566
01:49:22,917 --> 01:49:23,378
[SPEAKER_11]: Among others.

1567
01:49:23,418 --> 01:49:28,879
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Mario 64, some in Ocarina of Time, some considered to be the greatest games ever made, so it had that, too.

1568
01:49:30,935 --> 01:49:58,091
[SPEAKER_03]: and even Treasure did a couple of games for it and we know what we think of Treasure okay this isn't to say I'll be completely sitting out on gaming hardware this generation obviously I have my Wii U and actually already have a bunch of games for it and I'll be picking up the Retron 5 and Ouya when they're commercially available also since Sony doesn't appear to be restricting used games or mandating internet connections the PS4 seems to be a viable option unless something disastrous turns up at E3

1569
01:49:59,358 --> 01:50:05,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, if Sony isn't looking at the Xbox One and saying, this is what we don't do, I'll be surprised.

1570
01:50:05,406 --> 01:50:11,213
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I can say with absolute certainty that I've got more than enough... You know, that was the first typo I found.

1571
01:50:12,174 --> 01:50:13,516
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, then and so than.

1572
01:50:14,962 --> 01:50:18,043
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I was just thinking I was impressed, so good on you.

1573
01:50:19,363 --> 01:50:25,565
[SPEAKER_03]: More than enough gaming ready to go for the next five or so years, and that doesn't include GOG or Humble Bundles.

1574
01:50:26,466 --> 01:50:36,869
[SPEAKER_03]: However, almost as troubling as the DRM encumbrance on the Xbox One is Microsoft's continued commitment of trying to pimp the Xbox to people who don't give a crap about video games.

1575
01:50:37,549 --> 01:50:41,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Does Microsoft not understand that there are cheaper alternatives for those who want set-top boxes?

1576
01:50:42,633 --> 01:50:53,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, media centers like Boxee and Apple TV are $80 to $100 and modern Blu-ray players are having more and more of those features put into them for about the same price or less.

1577
01:50:53,481 --> 01:50:54,822
[SPEAKER_03]: That's ignoring the obvious

1578
01:50:55,702 --> 01:51:17,120
[SPEAKER_03]: plug a cheap PC into your television through HDMI option I shit you guys not I can do the whole Netflix YouTube multimedia thing on my Blu-ray player my PS3 my Nexus 7 tablet and my PC and most of those options are also on my Wii U Microsoft goes full bore with the living room takeover thing at their own peril while I hesitate to wish them ill I do hope they're awakened soon

1579
01:51:18,301 --> 01:51:19,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Failing that, however, I'm good to go.

1580
01:51:20,102 --> 01:51:26,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Emulators on Ouya, Retro Goodness on the Retron 5, and Modern Gaming on the Wii U, and potentially a future on the PS4.

1581
01:51:26,667 --> 01:51:31,210
[SPEAKER_03]: And Japanese developers will likely be able to go right back to ignoring Microsoft, and all's right with the world.

1582
01:51:32,011 --> 01:51:34,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, there's my thoughts on the Xbox One.

1583
01:51:34,072 --> 01:51:35,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Have I mentioned it's a stupid name?

1584
01:51:35,733 --> 01:51:36,073
[SPEAKER_03]: I have.

1585
01:51:36,334 --> 01:51:36,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't care.

1586
01:51:37,054 --> 01:51:37,695
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a stupid name.

1587
01:51:38,095 --> 01:51:39,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, it's worse than Wii.

1588
01:51:39,456 --> 01:51:40,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Regards, RollStillUT.

1589
01:51:41,337 --> 01:51:46,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for the best written email I have ever read in my entire life except for your one typo.

1590
01:51:47,302 --> 01:51:50,045
[SPEAKER_03]: It's T-H-A-N, not T-H-E-N.

1591
01:51:50,125 --> 01:51:51,827
[SPEAKER_11]: And also... That is totally a lie.

1592
01:51:51,967 --> 01:51:52,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Well written.

1593
01:51:52,767 --> 01:51:53,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up, Rob.

1594
01:51:54,389 --> 01:51:54,729
[SPEAKER_03]: No offense.

1595
01:51:54,749 --> 01:51:55,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Kickstartered.

1596
01:51:55,770 --> 01:51:56,751
[SPEAKER_11]: No offense to the emailer.

1597
01:51:56,951 --> 01:51:57,111
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1598
01:51:57,892 --> 01:52:00,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know it's my job to completely fuck up everyone's grammar.

1599
01:52:01,135 --> 01:52:06,360
[SPEAKER_11]: I think maybe it's a little bit overly cynical, but I will give until E3.

1600
01:52:06,580 --> 01:52:07,781
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see what happens.

1601
01:52:10,517 --> 01:52:16,740
[SPEAKER_11]: And just like Bobby said in the chatroom at live.vognetwork.com Sony never said they weren't doing any of that.

1602
01:52:16,860 --> 01:52:18,100
[SPEAKER_11]: They just never answered the question.

1603
01:52:18,980 --> 01:52:19,421
[SPEAKER_01]: True dat.

1604
01:52:19,921 --> 01:52:21,641
[SPEAKER_11]: So, we'll see.

1605
01:52:22,362 --> 01:52:24,042
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not going to be able to dodge it much longer.

1606
01:52:24,542 --> 01:52:25,043
[SPEAKER_03]: One foot.

1607
01:52:26,383 --> 01:52:27,383
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one scale mate foot.

1608
01:52:27,643 --> 01:52:28,684
[SPEAKER_11]: In your behind.

1609
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:30,061
[SPEAKER_03]: In your angel butt?

1610
01:52:32,103 --> 01:52:34,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, this comes from Jay, who I was hanging out with.

1611
01:52:34,605 --> 01:52:37,328
[SPEAKER_03]: And just let me hop back into the chat long enough to keep from getting logged out.

1612
01:52:37,809 --> 01:52:38,009
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

1613
01:52:38,730 --> 01:52:38,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1614
01:52:40,992 --> 01:52:45,697
[SPEAKER_03]: This email comes from Jay, Jammer Jay, who I was hanging out with on last Monday.

1615
01:52:45,877 --> 01:52:47,659
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, is it gossip all about your experiences?

1616
01:52:47,779 --> 01:52:48,379
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not.

1617
01:52:48,439 --> 01:52:50,461
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pictures of me being sunburned.

1618
01:52:51,442 --> 01:52:51,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1619
01:52:53,424 --> 01:52:57,048
[SPEAKER_03]: The highlight of my gaming week was playing DDR with the legendary DarkSakura.

1620
01:52:57,108 --> 01:52:57,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I know.

1621
01:52:58,169 --> 01:53:01,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, she did a fine job for getting back into DDR.

1622
01:53:01,412 --> 01:53:05,036
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's time for Sky and Loki to brush off the rust and join her back into DDR.

1623
01:53:06,817 --> 01:53:09,378
[SPEAKER_11]: Played at Roseville Golf Land a couple months ago.

1624
01:53:09,479 --> 01:53:12,540
[SPEAKER_11]: I think when Spike and Tim... That show that Spike and Tim were here.

1625
01:53:12,580 --> 01:53:13,781
[SPEAKER_11]: We've gone to Golf Land earlier in the week.

1626
01:53:13,801 --> 01:53:17,343
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a pile of tokens, which they don't... Which they don't even use anymore.

1627
01:53:17,383 --> 01:53:18,244
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all like a card.

1628
01:53:18,604 --> 01:53:19,524
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe you could trade them in.

1629
01:53:19,704 --> 01:53:20,045
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1630
01:53:20,365 --> 01:53:21,646
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think they'll do that.

1631
01:53:22,326 --> 01:53:23,867
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they had to for a certain time.

1632
01:53:25,222 --> 01:53:29,246
[SPEAKER_03]: My summer advice for gamers, be sure to have light sunscreen if planning to be out in the sun a bit.

1633
01:53:29,346 --> 01:53:30,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, why?

1634
01:53:30,768 --> 01:53:41,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because the thing is I'm not supposed to wear sunblock at all because I don't make enough vitamin D normally, so I didn't wear any.

1635
01:53:41,639 --> 01:53:45,743
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I forgot what humidity and sunlight really does, and I'm still peeling.

1636
01:53:46,904 --> 01:53:48,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, it was nice seeing you again, DarkSakura.

1637
01:53:48,945 --> 01:53:49,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1638
01:53:49,286 --> 01:53:50,186
[SPEAKER_03]: It was good to see you too.

1639
01:53:50,727 --> 01:53:54,149
[SPEAKER_03]: And I look forward to meeting up with Sky and Loki for California DDR one day.

1640
01:53:54,229 --> 01:53:58,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we would love to have you out here and you are more than welcome to crash at my place.

1641
01:54:00,653 --> 01:54:01,693
[SPEAKER_03]: And last email.

1642
01:54:03,325 --> 01:54:03,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello all!

1643
01:54:04,566 --> 01:54:06,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Just thought I would drop a line to say hello to the gang.

1644
01:54:07,467 --> 01:54:12,809
[SPEAKER_03]: I am in the middle of reading an amazing book called Ready Player One, which we've discussed on the show, by Ernest Cline.

1645
01:54:13,830 --> 01:54:18,192
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I'm a little late to the party since the book has been out about two years now, but it's so good.

1646
01:54:19,056 --> 01:54:24,518
[SPEAKER_03]: So much gaming culture and influence as well as a lot of great pop culture references from the 80s and 90s.

1647
01:54:24,898 --> 01:54:25,738
[SPEAKER_03]: I have two questions.

1648
01:54:25,918 --> 01:54:27,639
[SPEAKER_03]: To anyone who has read it, what did you think?

1649
01:54:27,739 --> 01:54:28,299
[SPEAKER_03]: No spoilers.

1650
01:54:29,159 --> 01:54:30,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I think we've discussed in depth.

1651
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:31,620
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't read it yet.

1652
01:54:31,640 --> 01:54:32,901
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be borrowing it from Becky, I think.

1653
01:54:33,081 --> 01:54:33,721
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, good.

1654
01:54:33,741 --> 01:54:34,681
[SPEAKER_11]: I still haven't read it.

1655
01:54:35,862 --> 01:54:39,543
[SPEAKER_11]: I still need to read Catching Fire, y'all, before the movie's out.

1656
01:54:39,663 --> 01:54:41,844
[SPEAKER_11]: So I got a long book queue.

1657
01:54:41,944 --> 01:54:44,744
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't need to read the book to watch the movie.

1658
01:54:46,545 --> 01:54:58,892
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but like when I... See, reading the book makes the movie better because when I went to see The Hunger Games, like every time they changed something from the book, it was like... And then Alan would know that that was something that changed in the book because he could hear me huffing.

1659
01:55:00,973 --> 01:55:04,514
[SPEAKER_07]: So the fact that you got pissed off that they changed things in the book made it better?

1660
01:55:04,595 --> 01:55:06,215
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it made it a more interactive experience.

1661
01:55:07,076 --> 01:55:08,036
[SPEAKER_11]: Who won The Hunger Games?

1662
01:55:08,457 --> 01:55:08,977
[SPEAKER_11]: I did.

1663
01:55:09,697 --> 01:55:10,157
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1664
01:55:11,678 --> 01:55:14,200
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of funny doing that with Battle Royale now that I've read the book.

1665
01:55:15,365 --> 01:55:33,975
[SPEAKER_03]: and seeing how the movie is just complete blood fest and not really political it's very different the manga is great though so anyway I'm only halfway through and my second question is to Loki when you were doing that challenge a while back this was the book you were doing it for wasn't it yes

1666
01:55:34,733 --> 01:55:40,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone who hasn't read the book, stop what you were doing after the OLR show, of course, and go pick it up on Kindle or your local bookstore.

1667
01:55:41,120 --> 01:55:42,362
[SPEAKER_03]: You will not be disappointed.

1668
01:55:42,802 --> 01:55:43,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep up the great work.

1669
01:55:43,823 --> 01:55:46,386
[SPEAKER_03]: You three make my Monday at office a lot less miserable.

1670
01:55:46,506 --> 01:55:48,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Your friend, Travis.

1671
01:55:48,068 --> 01:55:49,810
[SPEAKER_11]: You make our Sunday mailbag a lot less miserable.

1672
01:55:49,830 --> 01:55:50,591
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Travis.

1673
01:55:50,611 --> 01:55:50,831
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1674
01:55:55,422 --> 01:56:22,957
[SPEAKER_03]: and you know there's pictures that Jay sent but I think they're the same ones that he put up on Facebook and they're not wanting to look yeah my butt playing DDR your butt on a DDR machine lol see I'm not showing any of you in the chat room because no all right well as long as you have fun that's what DDR is about because I'm the diva that's why fun uh speaking of diva moments it's time to get into that segment we do here every week on the show where we get a little bit angry

1675
01:56:39,566 --> 01:57:08,119
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to smoking in your house and making all of my clothes smell like smoke and then on top of it okay this is me going into some family shit okay my mom smokes in the house her husband smokes in the house while my grandmother has vasculitis and I was reading about just how badly secondhand smoke can aggravate vasculitis aggravate a lot

1676
01:57:08,752 --> 01:57:09,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

1677
01:57:09,372 --> 01:57:14,334
[SPEAKER_03]: And then my mom's like, my mom has asthma, and she's saying that my shampoo is aggravating her asthma.

1678
01:57:14,434 --> 01:57:15,115
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was not.

1679
01:57:15,135 --> 01:57:17,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Your smoking is aggravating your damn asthma.

1680
01:57:18,656 --> 01:57:21,918
[SPEAKER_11]: When I smoked, I would always go, which was a long time ago, but I would always go outside.

1681
01:57:23,278 --> 01:57:24,979
[SPEAKER_11]: Most smokers I knew would do that.

1682
01:57:25,919 --> 01:57:26,980
[SPEAKER_11]: Especially in this state.

1683
01:57:27,160 --> 01:57:29,181
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, it's illegal to smoke anywhere that's not outside.

1684
01:57:29,481 --> 01:57:31,762
[SPEAKER_11]: And most outdoor places are also banned at this point in time.

1685
01:57:32,359 --> 01:57:33,940
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually banned it in Daphne.

1686
01:57:34,020 --> 01:57:39,963
[SPEAKER_03]: I had the most pleasant experience in a Waffle House that I've ever had in my life because you couldn't smoke inside.

1687
01:57:40,684 --> 01:57:41,944
[SPEAKER_03]: You could actually smell your food.

1688
01:57:42,024 --> 01:57:43,025
[SPEAKER_03]: It was amazing.

1689
01:57:43,625 --> 01:57:45,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I love you, Daphne Waffle House.

1690
01:57:45,846 --> 01:57:49,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Your peanut butter waffles are so freaking good.

1691
01:57:49,848 --> 01:57:53,791
[SPEAKER_03]: And even though you're kind of racist assholes, Blue Bell Ice Cream, I love your ice cream too.

1692
01:57:55,091 --> 01:57:56,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for the banana pudding ice cream.

1693
01:57:57,413 --> 01:57:59,714
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, F you to Attention Horse.

1694
01:57:59,734 --> 01:57:59,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

1695
01:58:00,299 --> 01:58:01,300
[SPEAKER_11]: Three hour show, Jamie.

1696
01:58:01,320 --> 01:58:01,740
[SPEAKER_11]: Three hour show.

1697
01:58:01,760 --> 01:58:01,940
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm done.

1698
01:58:02,020 --> 01:58:02,301
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1699
01:58:02,721 --> 01:58:03,101
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki.

1700
01:58:03,822 --> 01:58:04,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck you to hot.

1701
01:58:05,683 --> 01:58:06,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

1702
01:58:06,464 --> 01:58:07,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's going to get hot.

1703
01:58:08,185 --> 01:58:08,625
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1704
01:58:08,705 --> 01:58:12,508
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like 95 today or something, and next week it's 105.

1705
01:58:12,548 --> 01:58:13,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck that.

1706
01:58:13,109 --> 01:58:13,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope.

1707
01:58:14,169 --> 01:58:14,730
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the winter.

1708
01:58:15,010 --> 01:58:15,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Winter, it's cold.

1709
01:58:16,011 --> 01:58:16,991
[SPEAKER_07]: You put more layers on.

1710
01:58:17,212 --> 01:58:19,633
[SPEAKER_07]: You can only take off so many layers in the summer.

1711
01:58:19,774 --> 01:58:20,514
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to rain.

1712
01:58:20,734 --> 01:58:21,495
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's going to be hot.

1713
01:58:23,345 --> 01:58:23,625
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1714
01:58:24,245 --> 01:58:24,546
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it?

1715
01:58:24,686 --> 01:58:25,706
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.

1716
01:58:25,806 --> 01:58:26,046
[SPEAKER_11]: My F.E.

1717
01:58:26,086 --> 01:58:28,968
[SPEAKER_11]: of the Week just goes to the whole, like, when it rains, it pours syndrome.

1718
01:58:29,388 --> 01:58:30,949
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a lot of good things going on right now.

1719
01:58:30,989 --> 01:58:31,889
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't really complain.

1720
01:58:31,929 --> 01:58:38,292
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, there's nothing I'm doing where I'm like, argh, I'm so angry about this, which is like, did Robbie bite off more than he could chew?

1721
01:58:38,473 --> 01:58:38,953
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

1722
01:58:39,353 --> 01:58:51,259
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's actually one of those things where I'm like, okay, when I have some days off next week, I have some time to catch up on some things, then I can go have fun in L.A., even though I'll have to be driving down there by myself, but...

1723
01:58:51,772 --> 01:58:52,373
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

1724
01:59:12,344 --> 01:59:22,791
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, let's get to a couple more news stories for you guys and then Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR and the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1725
01:59:22,931 --> 01:59:24,432
[SPEAKER_11]: Not just yet though, a couple more stories.

1726
01:59:24,772 --> 01:59:26,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, unfortunately we got some depressing stories.

1727
01:59:26,974 --> 01:59:31,517
[SPEAKER_07]: The first being that unfortunately there was a tragic event that happened this week.

1728
01:59:32,117 --> 01:59:40,503
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the engineers for the Oculus Rift, Andrew Scott Reese, was killed in a

1729
01:59:41,563 --> 01:59:45,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, a hit and run during a police chase.

1730
01:59:46,706 --> 01:59:52,048
[SPEAKER_07]: He was crossing the street in a crosswalk and got hit by a car that the police were chasing and killed.

1731
01:59:55,222 --> 01:59:56,243
[SPEAKER_11]: That's awful.

1732
01:59:56,283 --> 01:59:56,624
[SPEAKER_03]: That sucks.

1733
01:59:56,764 --> 01:59:58,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially after we just had an email.

1734
01:59:58,105 --> 01:59:59,407
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, after that email and everything.

1735
01:59:59,507 --> 01:59:59,967
[SPEAKER_11]: It's crazy.

1736
01:59:59,987 --> 02:00:08,837
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, what's really horrible about that is it's like, you know, dude was crossing the street and... Well, didn't it happen to Gunpei... Fuck, I can't remember his name.

1737
02:00:08,857 --> 02:00:09,618
[SPEAKER_03]: The dead Metroid?

1738
02:00:09,838 --> 02:00:12,401
[SPEAKER_11]: I think he died in a car accident.

1739
02:00:12,681 --> 02:00:14,263
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought he was getting out of a car and got hit.

1740
02:00:14,423 --> 02:00:16,464
[SPEAKER_11]: He, yeah, yeah, yeah, that sounds familiar.

1741
02:00:16,524 --> 02:00:18,205
[SPEAKER_11]: It's on Wikipedia somewhere.

1742
02:00:18,806 --> 02:00:20,166
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, it was really sad.

1743
02:00:20,727 --> 02:00:25,490
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's just, you know, obviously people, car accidents happen every day and we lose great people.

1744
02:00:25,510 --> 02:00:28,751
[SPEAKER_11]: And people, pedestrians get hit every day, unfortunately, and we lose great people.

1745
02:00:28,811 --> 02:00:35,295
[SPEAKER_11]: It just, it just really sucks that A, this was such a great, you know, young mind that was inventing these things that everybody wanted to play.

1746
02:00:35,696 --> 02:00:37,577
[SPEAKER_11]: And B, totally preventable.

1747
02:00:38,317 --> 02:00:40,139
[SPEAKER_11]: This guy was not at fault.

1748
02:00:40,539 --> 02:00:44,903
[SPEAKER_11]: He wasn't crossing the street in a drug-induced stupor or something.

1749
02:00:44,983 --> 02:00:47,405
[SPEAKER_11]: He was hit by a guy who was running from the police.

1750
02:00:47,765 --> 02:00:48,726
[SPEAKER_11]: Totally preventable.

1751
02:00:49,186 --> 02:00:50,587
[SPEAKER_11]: It's awful.

1752
02:00:51,548 --> 02:00:52,089
[SPEAKER_11]: It's awful.

1753
02:00:53,470 --> 02:00:55,431
[SPEAKER_11]: But what can you do?

1754
02:00:56,653 --> 02:00:58,674
[SPEAKER_11]: When it's time to go, you're gonna go.

1755
02:00:58,694 --> 02:01:00,316
[SPEAKER_11]: You know?

1756
02:01:00,356 --> 02:01:00,636
[SPEAKER_11]: You know?

1757
02:01:02,162 --> 02:01:05,344
[SPEAKER_07]: But at the same time, it's important not to...

1758
02:01:23,823 --> 02:01:31,725
[SPEAKER_07]: If there's a police chase going and there's cars with sirens coming your way, you can hear those sirens and, you know, you always want to look.

1759
02:01:31,885 --> 02:01:35,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially when I'm driving and stuff, even though there's a green light, I'm always looking.

1760
02:01:35,446 --> 02:01:40,728
[SPEAKER_07]: I give it a couple seconds before I go because there's always someone that's not paying attention that's going to run the light.

1761
02:01:41,008 --> 02:01:45,049
[SPEAKER_07]: So you've got to be defensive and always kind of keep your eye out, even though it may be green or something.

1762
02:01:45,289 --> 02:01:46,569
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember, actually, it was funny.

1763
02:01:46,589 --> 02:01:52,831
[SPEAKER_07]: The last time I went to E3, even, a bus ran out of control and smashed into a Walgreens.

1764
02:01:53,411 --> 02:01:53,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

1765
02:02:09,813 --> 02:02:11,955
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so here's the deal with Gunpei Yokoi.

1766
02:02:12,356 --> 02:02:15,759
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you don't know that name, he's the guy who produced... He worked for Nintendo for a long time.

1767
02:02:16,179 --> 02:02:19,363
[SPEAKER_11]: Producer of Kid Icarus and Metroid, which is huge right there.

1768
02:02:19,423 --> 02:02:21,004
[SPEAKER_11]: Designed Rob the Robot.

1769
02:02:21,044 --> 02:02:22,266
[SPEAKER_11]: Designed the Game Boy.

1770
02:02:22,886 --> 02:02:23,647
[SPEAKER_11]: So you all know that one.

1771
02:02:24,007 --> 02:02:29,313
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, he designed the Virtual Boy 2, for which, you know, there was a lot of shame that came with that, and he left Nintendo, but...

1772
02:02:29,873 --> 02:02:32,734
[SPEAKER_11]: They say that he had always planned to leave Nintendo at a certain age.

1773
02:02:33,454 --> 02:02:35,215
[SPEAKER_11]: Virtual Boy was not the reason for that.

1774
02:02:35,295 --> 02:02:41,717
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, unfortunately, in 1997, he was in a fender bender accident where he rear-ended a truck.

1775
02:02:42,097 --> 02:02:45,338
[SPEAKER_11]: He got out of the car to inspect the damage, because, you know, same thing happens here, right?

1776
02:02:45,378 --> 02:02:47,359
[SPEAKER_11]: You take the pictures, send them to the insurance company, all that stuff, right?

1777
02:02:47,899 --> 02:02:49,080
[SPEAKER_11]: And the passing cars hit him.

1778
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:52,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I remembered it was something like that.

1779
02:02:52,081 --> 02:02:53,441
[SPEAKER_03]: It's similar-ish, yeah.

1780
02:02:53,561 --> 02:02:54,821
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very tragic.

1781
02:02:55,561 --> 02:02:56,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and Yokoi.

1782
02:02:56,882 --> 02:02:59,162
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew it was Yoke, but I didn't remember.

1783
02:02:59,182 --> 02:02:59,703
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1784
02:03:01,223 --> 02:03:01,543
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1785
02:03:01,823 --> 02:03:12,746
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I hope... I really, really hope this story doesn't have a sad ending, but, you know, somebody in the gaming community is missing right now, and his name... I'm hoping...

1786
02:03:13,306 --> 02:03:13,806
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.com

1787
02:03:29,136 --> 02:03:56,262
[SPEAKER_11]: and he was missing in the Vancouver area his bike and helmet were found in Stanley Park but before he left he closed his Twitter account his Xbox Live account reportedly he left his wallet, computer and phone at home and there's really just not a lot of information unfortunately they have been assembling groups in Vancouver to try and find him unfortunately no luck yet I think they were going to search the Waters area next

1788
02:03:56,642 --> 02:03:57,643
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, don't know.

1789
02:03:57,763 --> 02:04:00,565
[SPEAKER_11]: He could have... So he took himself off the grid.

1790
02:04:01,485 --> 02:04:02,006
[SPEAKER_11]: Essentially.

1791
02:04:02,146 --> 02:04:03,667
[SPEAKER_11]: And who knows where he could have gone.

1792
02:04:04,127 --> 02:04:07,669
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully, he is safe and sound somewhere.

1793
02:04:08,150 --> 02:04:12,492
[SPEAKER_11]: Just, you know, for whatever reason, just got away.

1794
02:04:12,973 --> 02:04:16,775
[SPEAKER_11]: But I highly doubt he would be listening to this podcast.

1795
02:04:16,835 --> 02:04:20,618
[SPEAKER_11]: But if by some strange string of luck he was...

1796
02:04:21,638 --> 02:04:23,479
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of folks miss you, dude.

1797
02:04:24,179 --> 02:04:25,899
[SPEAKER_11]: Please call your family.

1798
02:04:26,700 --> 02:04:30,141
[SPEAKER_11]: And a lot of people are out looking for this guy, and they really miss him.

1799
02:04:30,181 --> 02:04:38,663
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you are in the Vancouver area, please... Even I would say, honestly, if you're in the Pacific Northwest at all, honestly, he could be anywhere at this point.

1800
02:04:38,723 --> 02:04:41,324
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not that hard to get on a plane and go somewhere else.

1801
02:04:41,884 --> 02:04:43,765
[SPEAKER_11]: or get in a car and go somewhere.

1802
02:04:43,785 --> 02:04:44,505
[SPEAKER_11]: He could be in the US.

1803
02:04:44,665 --> 02:04:44,986
[SPEAKER_11]: Who knows?

1804
02:04:45,626 --> 02:04:47,687
[SPEAKER_11]: FindKnuckles.com is the place to go.

1805
02:04:47,727 --> 02:04:49,348
[SPEAKER_11]: That's Knuckles like Sonic and Knuckles.

1806
02:04:49,708 --> 02:04:50,808
[SPEAKER_11]: FindKnuckles.com.

1807
02:04:51,449 --> 02:04:54,550
[SPEAKER_11]: This guy, by the way, you might have seen his work in the gaming community before.

1808
02:04:54,670 --> 02:05:00,933
[SPEAKER_11]: He was pretty well known because he got the one achievement a day on the 360 for like three years.

1809
02:05:01,213 --> 02:05:03,074
[SPEAKER_11]: He was really big in the Xbox achievements community.

1810
02:05:03,875 --> 02:05:04,915
[SPEAKER_11]: I know I heard his name before.

1811
02:05:04,955 --> 02:05:07,256
[SPEAKER_11]: I think he was working with other indie podcasts.

1812
02:05:07,276 --> 02:05:08,457
[SPEAKER_11]: I know he did stuff with Rooster Teeth.

1813
02:05:08,897 --> 02:05:13,900
[SPEAKER_11]: So, um, I hope they find them and I hope, uh, I hope all as well.

1814
02:05:15,421 --> 02:05:15,701
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1815
02:05:16,161 --> 02:05:18,883
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, that was two really horrible stories back to back.

1816
02:05:18,903 --> 02:05:23,965
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry we have to end on that note, but, uh, you know, we want to do our due diligence and get some puppies and kittens.

1817
02:05:24,205 --> 02:05:29,488
[SPEAKER_11]: Could you, we just need, we need like a kitten playing video or something to play the baby monkey writing backwards on a pig song.

1818
02:05:29,728 --> 02:05:31,209
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a, okay, hold on.

1819
02:05:32,190 --> 02:05:34,431
[SPEAKER_03]: It's literally, it's called baby monkey writing backwards on a pig.

1820
02:05:36,647 --> 02:05:39,089
[SPEAKER_11]: this will make us feel a little better that will make us feel better yes it will

1821
02:05:56,695 --> 02:05:57,696
[SPEAKER_11]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1822
02:05:57,776 --> 02:05:58,296
[SPEAKER_11]: Cheer me up.

1823
02:05:58,316 --> 02:06:02,337
[SPEAKER_11]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1824
02:06:02,657 --> 02:06:08,539
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to give us a call and comment on anything you've heard about on the show or maybe you didn't hear about on the show tonight but you want to.

1825
02:06:08,579 --> 02:06:14,561
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1826
02:06:14,881 --> 02:06:16,482
[SPEAKER_11]: Meanwhile, we will get to Twitter topics.

1827
02:06:16,602 --> 02:06:17,442
[SPEAKER_11]: I got to pull those up.

1828
02:06:17,582 --> 02:06:20,203
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, do we have any last minute news while we're working on that?

1829
02:06:21,341 --> 02:06:27,947
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a Kickstarter for some sort of vest haptic device or something that they're trying to get off the ground.

1830
02:06:28,428 --> 02:06:41,299
[SPEAKER_07]: It's supposed to be the as-close-as-it-gets Kickstarter, and it's like this thing that's supposed to tie in with first-person shooters and stuff like that to make it more immersive, where you actually feel like the bullets are hitting you and stuff.

1831
02:06:41,519 --> 02:06:43,000
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1832
02:07:03,976 --> 02:07:04,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Ragingator

1833
02:07:25,903 --> 02:07:30,167
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that makes me feel better.

1834
02:07:30,267 --> 02:07:31,208
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a kitty.

1835
02:07:31,608 --> 02:07:32,769
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, put it back on the cat.

1836
02:07:33,209 --> 02:07:33,870
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to see you.

1837
02:07:33,890 --> 02:07:34,611
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to see the cat.

1838
02:07:35,912 --> 02:07:36,292
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1839
02:07:36,712 --> 02:07:37,093
[SPEAKER_11]: Much better.

1840
02:07:37,193 --> 02:07:37,833
[SPEAKER_11]: What's kitty's name?

1841
02:07:40,175 --> 02:07:41,597
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's a good name.

1842
02:07:41,657 --> 02:07:41,977
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1843
02:07:43,738 --> 02:07:46,481
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully that will be better than the Anakin that was in episodes one through three.

1844
02:07:46,521 --> 02:07:47,301
[SPEAKER_11]: What's on your mind tonight?

1845
02:07:48,362 --> 02:07:49,683
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, not a whole lot.

1846
02:07:50,124 --> 02:07:50,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Um,

1847
02:07:51,375 --> 02:07:55,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Just kind of a generic question for tonight.

1848
02:07:57,117 --> 02:08:05,479
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there any upcoming games that have been announced that you're possibly looking forward to?

1849
02:08:06,520 --> 02:08:20,804
[SPEAKER_09]: And not only that, but as a secondary question, if you have a wish list or something that you would love to see on Steam, like if it was you see on Steam right now,

1850
02:08:21,730 --> 02:08:25,011
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I stole that money for that game and said, buy it.

1851
02:08:26,192 --> 02:08:26,892
[SPEAKER_11]: Like anything?

1852
02:08:26,912 --> 02:08:29,733
[SPEAKER_11]: Or are you talking about like ports from consoles or something like that?

1853
02:08:30,573 --> 02:08:32,514
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, either or.

1854
02:08:32,594 --> 02:08:34,674
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever direction you would like to take the question.

1855
02:08:34,995 --> 02:08:45,438
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I would point you to the OLR Dream Games page on the OLR Wiki because things like WhatTheyPlay.com, Snap, those still have not come to fruition and I think we'd like to see some of those.

1856
02:08:46,399 --> 02:08:50,060
[SPEAKER_11]: But on a serious note, things that are on console that I would like to see on Steam...

1857
02:08:51,040 --> 02:08:53,823
[SPEAKER_11]: I could be a total fanboy and say Mario, which also wouldn't happen, but

1858
02:09:14,560 --> 02:09:17,084
[SPEAKER_11]: Then again, on the keyboard, it wouldn't be the same experience.

1859
02:09:17,785 --> 02:09:18,786
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I don't know.

1860
02:09:18,806 --> 02:09:19,727
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd have to think about that one.

1861
02:09:19,947 --> 02:09:21,349
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys, anything that jumps to your mind?

1862
02:09:21,369 --> 02:09:22,411
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll come back to your other question though.

1863
02:09:22,731 --> 02:09:23,633
[SPEAKER_11]: Anything that jumps to your mind?

1864
02:09:23,693 --> 02:09:25,255
[SPEAKER_11]: Something that isn't on Steam that ought to be?

1865
02:09:27,540 --> 02:09:53,045
[SPEAKER_03]: there's so many things that I could come up with to make the list especially in this short of a show let me check in with DarkSakura and Loki I want SNES collections like Genesis collections even better, TurboGrafx I want the revamped Dracula X Alien Crush HD I want to see the whole Crush series up through Jackie Crush Loki?

1866
02:09:53,065 --> 02:09:53,405
[SPEAKER_11]: Minecraft

1867
02:09:55,868 --> 02:09:57,369
[SPEAKER_11]: You just won Minecraft in Steam.

1868
02:09:57,409 --> 02:09:57,830
[SPEAKER_11]: Makes sense.

1869
02:09:57,850 --> 02:09:58,350
[SPEAKER_11]: It'd be cool.

1870
02:09:58,450 --> 02:09:59,991
[SPEAKER_03]: I run my Minecraft through Steam.

1871
02:10:00,652 --> 02:10:02,073
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess it can be done.

1872
02:10:02,113 --> 02:10:02,814
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you can do that.

1873
02:10:02,834 --> 02:10:05,175
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, let's get to the meatier question that Ragenator asked.

1874
02:10:05,215 --> 02:10:08,278
[SPEAKER_11]: What are you personally looking forward to this year, if anything?

1875
02:10:08,658 --> 02:10:09,138
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me guess.

1876
02:10:09,219 --> 02:10:10,179
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, Saints Row 4.

1877
02:10:10,359 --> 02:10:13,822
[SPEAKER_07]: Grand Theft Auto V. Oh, of course.

1878
02:10:13,842 --> 02:10:14,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Both.

1879
02:10:14,383 --> 02:10:15,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on, both.

1880
02:10:16,084 --> 02:10:16,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that it?

1881
02:10:17,045 --> 02:10:18,526
[SPEAKER_07]: And Earth Defense Force 2025.

1882
02:10:19,366 --> 02:10:19,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1883
02:10:20,167 --> 02:10:21,088
[SPEAKER_07]: And the new Call of Duty.

1884
02:10:22,355 --> 02:10:25,937
[SPEAKER_11]: For me, the Kingdom Hearts 1.5 remix is something I'm definitely looking forward to.

1885
02:10:26,037 --> 02:10:27,678
[SPEAKER_11]: Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn.

1886
02:10:28,158 --> 02:10:32,060
[SPEAKER_11]: So I know I'm sounding like a total Square Enix fanboy, but it is what it is.

1887
02:10:32,140 --> 02:10:35,922
[SPEAKER_11]: Disney Infinity, although I'm totally expecting that game to be a flop.

1888
02:10:36,282 --> 02:10:42,306
[SPEAKER_11]: That whole collectible figurine thing, I have to admit, if I'm going to get into a Skylanders game, it's going to be this one.

1889
02:10:42,626 --> 02:10:43,266
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

1890
02:10:43,286 --> 02:10:44,327
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm cautiously optimistic.

1891
02:10:44,347 --> 02:10:45,487
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually do have to tell you something.

1892
02:10:46,047 --> 02:10:50,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Julian does not have any Skylanders games, but he has toys that he plays with.

1893
02:10:51,345 --> 02:10:54,308
[SPEAKER_07]: There are people that collect Disney commemorative plates.

1894
02:10:54,709 --> 02:10:55,630
[SPEAKER_07]: They will buy this game.

1895
02:10:55,910 --> 02:10:57,031
[SPEAKER_07]: People will buy this game.

1896
02:10:57,231 --> 02:10:58,152
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to matter.

1897
02:10:58,693 --> 02:10:59,974
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to flop.

1898
02:11:00,795 --> 02:11:05,780
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm still holding hope that Phantasy Star Online 2 will make it out this year at some point, although I'm losing hope.

1899
02:11:06,421 --> 02:11:07,782
[SPEAKER_11]: E3 is kind of the make or break for that.

1900
02:11:09,664 --> 02:11:12,447
[SPEAKER_11]: I kind of want to see the South Park Stick of Truth game, too.

1901
02:11:13,808 --> 02:11:34,275
[SPEAKER_11]: the toilet humor potty humor guy in me wants to see that Pokemon X and Y believe it or not I'm loving what it looks like the revamp battle system is going to be or not system but the graphics and everything and how they're making everything 3D it looks really cool I don't usually get into the Pokemon games quite as much as other people I know like Shane but if there's going to be one that's going to win me over it'll probably be X and Y

1902
02:11:35,721 --> 02:11:36,942
[SPEAKER_11]: How about you, Spazinator?

1903
02:11:36,982 --> 02:11:38,002
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you want this year?

1904
02:11:38,022 --> 02:11:39,463
[SPEAKER_11]: What can't you wait for?

1905
02:11:39,503 --> 02:11:48,628
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, stuff that would probably run on my PPS computer, probably Magic 2014.

1906
02:11:48,948 --> 02:11:51,469
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, of course.

1907
02:11:52,430 --> 02:11:57,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, well, that's probably one of the few upcoming games that will run on my computer for sure.

1908
02:11:58,053 --> 02:11:58,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1909
02:11:59,309 --> 02:12:04,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the other stuff, like GTA 5, I know for damn sure it won't run on my computer.

1910
02:12:05,918 --> 02:12:13,487
[SPEAKER_09]: If I were to go replace my consoles, I may go get that, but it's not really within my budget right now, but...

1911
02:12:15,054 --> 02:12:18,115
[SPEAKER_09]: The short answer is just the next Magic the Gallery.

1912
02:12:18,715 --> 02:12:19,235
[SPEAKER_11]: Fair enough.

1913
02:12:19,275 --> 02:12:19,635
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

1914
02:12:19,655 --> 02:12:22,996
[SPEAKER_11]: There's sometimes those reliable series, and we're always waiting for the next entry in them.

1915
02:12:23,316 --> 02:12:25,477
[SPEAKER_11]: Some people only get Madden every single year.

1916
02:12:25,557 --> 02:12:31,899
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we were like 10 years ago, I would have said, oh, whatever new DDR game is coming out this year.

1917
02:12:31,919 --> 02:12:32,939
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I'm looking forward to.

1918
02:12:33,079 --> 02:12:34,119
[SPEAKER_11]: But times have changed.

1919
02:12:34,479 --> 02:12:34,719
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1920
02:12:35,280 --> 02:12:36,900
[SPEAKER_11]: Ragenator, I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls.

1921
02:12:36,920 --> 02:12:37,760
[SPEAKER_11]: But take care, buddy, okay?

1922
02:12:38,440 --> 02:12:39,041
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep, you too.

1923
02:12:39,061 --> 02:12:39,381
[SPEAKER_11]: Take care.

1924
02:12:39,501 --> 02:12:39,741
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye.

1925
02:12:40,709 --> 02:12:42,470
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, and bye to Anakin as well, if you hear that.

1926
02:12:42,490 --> 02:12:46,591
[SPEAKER_11]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or use his name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1927
02:12:47,711 --> 02:12:52,353
[SPEAKER_11]: We didn't get a lot of Twitter topics tonight, but I will read this one from Tigerclaw, because this does look interesting.

1928
02:12:52,373 --> 02:12:53,013
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't know about this.

1929
02:12:54,174 --> 02:12:59,375
[SPEAKER_11]: Tigerclaw tweets us, the Tetris creator, Alexey Pajitnov, I totally said that wrong.

1930
02:12:59,415 --> 02:13:00,996
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't heard that guy's name in a long time.

1931
02:13:01,336 --> 02:13:05,657
[SPEAKER_11]: But he created Tetris, and he came out with a new mobile phone game.

1932
02:13:05,697 --> 02:13:07,118
[SPEAKER_11]: This is where everybody go on iOS.

1933
02:13:07,578 --> 02:13:09,659
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an iOS game called Marbly.

1934
02:13:10,419 --> 02:13:16,142
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the first title he's ever designed exclusively for a mobile device and that you play with colored balls.

1935
02:13:16,422 --> 02:13:17,382
[SPEAKER_11]: Hence the name Marbly.

1936
02:13:18,182 --> 02:13:18,383
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1937
02:13:18,803 --> 02:13:19,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they blue?

1938
02:13:20,103 --> 02:13:22,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, someone had to go the five-year-old route.

1939
02:13:22,544 --> 02:13:24,585
[SPEAKER_11]: Why are you giggling over there when I mentioned balls?

1940
02:13:24,765 --> 02:13:25,045
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1941
02:13:25,506 --> 02:13:26,646
[SPEAKER_11]: Because balls are funny.

1942
02:13:26,806 --> 02:13:27,527
[SPEAKER_11]: Balls are funny.

1943
02:13:27,767 --> 02:13:29,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go to the phones and see who's there.

1944
02:13:29,928 --> 02:13:31,268
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, another video call.

1945
02:13:31,308 --> 02:13:31,728
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm loving this.

1946
02:13:32,009 --> 02:13:32,269
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.

1947
02:13:32,469 --> 02:13:34,089
[SPEAKER_03]: I love your shirt and I want it.

1948
02:13:34,270 --> 02:13:36,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Take it off and send it to me now.

1949
02:13:37,971 --> 02:13:39,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Your chest is impressive.

1950
02:13:39,752 --> 02:13:41,574
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep it on for the rest of this call, please.

1951
02:13:41,634 --> 02:13:42,214
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a family show.

1952
02:13:42,234 --> 02:13:43,015
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys are cheating me.

1953
02:13:43,035 --> 02:13:43,975
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't see you on video.

1954
02:13:44,456 --> 02:13:45,296
[SPEAKER_11]: I know.

1955
02:13:45,616 --> 02:13:47,998
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you've heard how many times the stream has gone down tonight.

1956
02:13:48,038 --> 02:13:49,079
[SPEAKER_11]: We can't afford the upload.

1957
02:13:49,759 --> 02:13:50,960
[SPEAKER_11]: Who is this for the listeners?

1958
02:13:51,881 --> 02:13:52,481
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Osfer.

1959
02:13:52,621 --> 02:13:53,022
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Osfer.

1960
02:13:53,042 --> 02:13:53,562
[SPEAKER_11]: How are you doing?

1961
02:13:54,903 --> 02:13:55,543
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm pretty good.

1962
02:13:56,064 --> 02:13:59,606
[SPEAKER_10]: You mentioned earlier about how you were really getting into the Wii U virtual console.

1963
02:13:59,706 --> 02:14:00,006
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1964
02:14:01,658 --> 02:14:01,738
[SPEAKER_10]: I, uh...

1965
02:14:24,522 --> 02:14:31,492
[SPEAKER_10]: I also went and I got Mega Man X because, I don't know, a lot of people seem to really be into the series.

1966
02:14:31,532 --> 02:14:34,896
[SPEAKER_10]: I've never played Mega Man X before, but I've played the other games.

1967
02:14:35,778 --> 02:14:36,999
[SPEAKER_11]: Now's a great time to catch up.

1968
02:14:38,826 --> 02:14:40,207
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it seems pretty good.

1969
02:14:40,387 --> 02:14:44,289
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm pretty bad at Mega Man games in general, too, but I have a lot of fun things.

1970
02:14:44,569 --> 02:14:46,170
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the dashing and stuff like that.

1971
02:14:46,370 --> 02:14:50,252
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, a lot of Mega Man games are really freaking hard, too.

1972
02:14:50,932 --> 02:14:52,933
[SPEAKER_11]: You say, I'm not that good at Mega Man games.

1973
02:14:53,353 --> 02:14:56,074
[SPEAKER_11]: Nobody is that good at Mega Man games, but you learn.

1974
02:14:56,174 --> 02:14:56,515
[SPEAKER_11]: You learn.

1975
02:14:56,575 --> 02:14:57,135
[SPEAKER_11]: You get better at them.

1976
02:14:57,870 --> 02:15:04,333
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I was actually really mad earlier because I was fighting some mini-boss against... I can't remember the robot's name.

1977
02:15:04,353 --> 02:15:05,553
[SPEAKER_10]: It was some electrical guy.

1978
02:15:05,813 --> 02:15:07,654
[SPEAKER_10]: And I couldn't even beat the freaking mini-boss.

1979
02:15:07,814 --> 02:15:09,475
[SPEAKER_10]: I was getting so angry.

1980
02:15:09,555 --> 02:15:10,696
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I fight the actual boss.

1981
02:15:10,716 --> 02:15:13,317
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, wow, that was the easiest thing I'm going to fight.

1982
02:15:13,977 --> 02:15:15,117
[SPEAKER_10]: What did you think of Super Metroid?

1983
02:15:17,098 --> 02:15:18,659
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I actually own it on Super Nintendo.

1984
02:15:18,879 --> 02:15:19,839
[SPEAKER_10]: So I've played it before.

1985
02:15:19,859 --> 02:15:20,400
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah.

1986
02:15:20,420 --> 02:15:21,620
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

1987
02:15:21,660 --> 02:15:22,981
[SPEAKER_10]: But you're very...

1988
02:15:24,656 --> 02:15:52,586
[SPEAKER_10]: you're very well thought out and it being your favorite game ever because it is pretty amazing that is the right answer sir I will side with you in your whole Chrono Trigger debate that I think Super Metroid is a far better game than Chrono Trigger it's comparing apples and oranges though I don't care how many times you F5 the site tonight you get a gold star for that comment if you're comparing RPGs Chrono Trigger is up at the top next to Final Fantasy 6 but action games

1989
02:15:54,524 --> 02:16:00,228
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, Jamie, in the RPG department, I will say that I like Chrono Cross better than Chrono Trigger.

1990
02:16:00,488 --> 02:16:02,029
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we're sticking to just SNES?

1991
02:16:04,511 --> 02:16:05,272
[SPEAKER_10]: Just SNES?

1992
02:16:05,532 --> 02:16:05,872
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1993
02:16:06,112 --> 02:16:09,635
[SPEAKER_11]: Final Fantasy VI versus Chrono Trigger, I think, is the great SNES debate.

1994
02:16:09,955 --> 02:16:10,515
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

1995
02:16:10,555 --> 02:16:12,897
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, for me, then that would be Super Mario RPG.

1996
02:16:14,891 --> 02:16:15,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, good answer.

1997
02:16:16,011 --> 02:16:17,332
[SPEAKER_10]: Fair answer, fair answer.

1998
02:16:18,152 --> 02:16:20,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, you mentioned this shirt earlier.

1999
02:16:20,673 --> 02:16:20,893
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2000
02:16:21,353 --> 02:16:24,474
[SPEAKER_10]: You can tell because it's like backwards, but it's the Symphony of the Goddesses shirt.

2001
02:16:24,534 --> 02:16:25,715
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not backwards on our end.

2002
02:16:26,015 --> 02:16:26,935
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not backwards on our end.

2003
02:16:26,975 --> 02:16:28,335
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess the camera flips properly.

2004
02:16:28,355 --> 02:16:28,875
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's weird.

2005
02:16:29,096 --> 02:16:29,736
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we see it.

2006
02:16:31,576 --> 02:16:33,557
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, on my end, it is backwards, so I'm like...

2007
02:16:34,501 --> 02:16:35,943
[SPEAKER_10]: That's weird.

2008
02:16:36,303 --> 02:16:38,606
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you guys made it out to see Symphony of the Goddesses yet?

2009
02:16:38,626 --> 02:16:40,568
[SPEAKER_11]: No, but I want to.

2010
02:16:40,728 --> 02:16:43,231
[SPEAKER_11]: But you know what I said earlier about a lot of stuff going on?

2011
02:16:43,251 --> 02:16:44,672
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2012
02:16:45,493 --> 02:16:45,733
[SPEAKER_10]: I think...

2013
02:16:47,042 --> 02:16:47,362
[SPEAKER_10]: What was that?

2014
02:16:47,382 --> 02:16:47,843
[SPEAKER_10]: Sunshine.

2015
02:16:47,883 --> 02:16:50,866
[SPEAKER_10]: I think he mentioned something about it coming back to California soon.

2016
02:16:51,246 --> 02:16:55,590
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe I heard it's going to be in Oakland or somewhere in the East Bay soon.

2017
02:16:55,790 --> 02:16:59,074
[SPEAKER_11]: And I honestly think it was like early June.

2018
02:16:59,374 --> 02:17:00,895
[SPEAKER_11]: It's probably when I'm in L.A.

2019
02:17:02,717 --> 02:17:03,358
[SPEAKER_11]: Just my luck.

2020
02:17:03,898 --> 02:17:04,559
[SPEAKER_11]: Just my luck.

2021
02:17:05,160 --> 02:17:05,400
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2022
02:17:05,740 --> 02:17:08,563
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, as for anything you want to share with our listeners tonight, anything else?

2023
02:17:10,447 --> 02:17:11,768
[SPEAKER_10]: That's about it.

2024
02:17:11,808 --> 02:17:13,088
[SPEAKER_10]: All your listeners should go drink coffee.

2025
02:17:13,228 --> 02:17:13,888
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what they should do.

2026
02:17:16,709 --> 02:17:18,009
[SPEAKER_11]: But don't drink crappy coffee.

2027
02:17:18,149 --> 02:17:20,370
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you're drinking coffee right now.

2028
02:17:20,410 --> 02:17:21,270
[SPEAKER_11]: There we go.

2029
02:17:21,530 --> 02:17:26,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Your mug is like the size of mine, except mine says the queen is not accepting an audience today.

2030
02:17:28,272 --> 02:17:28,552
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

2031
02:17:28,592 --> 02:17:30,393
[SPEAKER_10]: This is just like some cheap Walmart mug.

2032
02:17:30,433 --> 02:17:30,853
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

2033
02:17:30,973 --> 02:17:33,133
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's Starbucks blonde dress, so it's pretty good.

2034
02:17:33,153 --> 02:17:33,793
[SPEAKER_10]: I like Starbucks.

2035
02:17:33,913 --> 02:17:34,714
[SPEAKER_11]: There you go.

2036
02:17:34,754 --> 02:17:36,274
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, Osprey, you take care.

2037
02:17:36,334 --> 02:17:36,814
[SPEAKER_11]: Have a good night.

2038
02:17:37,054 --> 02:17:37,574
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for calling.

2039
02:17:37,634 --> 02:17:38,975
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, you too.

2040
02:17:38,995 --> 02:17:39,615
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, bye.

2041
02:17:41,178 --> 02:17:42,959
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody's beautiful in their own unique way.

2042
02:17:43,039 --> 02:17:43,659
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody's beautiful.

2043
02:18:08,368 --> 02:18:09,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that, who was that?

2044
02:18:09,569 --> 02:18:10,810
[SPEAKER_03]: That was Ray Stevens, wasn't it?

2045
02:18:11,010 --> 02:18:11,350
[SPEAKER_11]: Was it?

2046
02:18:11,570 --> 02:18:12,051
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.

2047
02:18:12,191 --> 02:18:12,491
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

2048
02:18:12,611 --> 02:18:23,659
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's funny, I told, when I was on the way back to Gulfport to get on the plane, I texted Dan from Pascagoula, so he asked if there were Skrulls going berserk, because that was another Ray Stevens song.

2049
02:18:25,280 --> 02:18:26,781
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys are such nerds.

2050
02:18:26,941 --> 02:18:27,321
[SPEAKER_03]: So?

2051
02:18:27,621 --> 02:18:29,603
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's go to another call.

2052
02:18:30,323 --> 02:18:32,004
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

2053
02:18:32,024 --> 02:18:33,725
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Legend of Zaku here.

2054
02:18:33,825 --> 02:18:36,327
[SPEAKER_08]: Three video calls in a row, look at that.

2055
02:18:36,667 --> 02:18:37,268
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up, Zaku?

2056
02:18:38,632 --> 02:18:43,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing much, just trying to stay dry, high and dry right now with all this thunder outside.

2057
02:18:43,579 --> 02:18:44,480
[SPEAKER_11]: I've already heard a few rumbles.

2058
02:18:54,375 --> 02:19:00,678
[SPEAKER_11]: Which, by the way, I hope everybody's... I know Codeman lives in Oklahoma, so I checked in with him earlier in the week.

2059
02:19:00,778 --> 02:19:05,140
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know who else of our listenership is in that area affected by the tornadoes, but I hope y'all are okay.

2060
02:19:05,220 --> 02:19:07,181
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope your stuff's hooked up to surge protectors, too.

2061
02:19:07,641 --> 02:19:10,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, he's got a shirt I want!

2062
02:19:11,283 --> 02:19:12,784
[SPEAKER_03]: I freaking love Dream Theater.

2063
02:19:13,004 --> 02:19:13,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god.

2064
02:19:15,425 --> 02:19:16,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Dream Theater's freaking awesome.

2065
02:19:18,317 --> 02:19:23,759
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, Zaku, surely you did not just call in tonight to get complimented by DarkSakura, although I wouldn't blame you if you did.

2066
02:19:24,059 --> 02:19:24,959
[SPEAKER_11]: What's on your mind tonight?

2067
02:19:26,180 --> 02:19:33,422
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I guess, well, to put it bluntly, I think we're approaching the next video game crash.

2068
02:19:34,142 --> 02:19:44,906
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, call me cynical, but if you look at the rumblings of how Microsoft announced to the world about the Xbox One, how they're basically...

2069
02:19:46,841 --> 02:19:53,185
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not getting a straight answer from them regarding used games since each answer is contradicting one another.

2070
02:19:53,646 --> 02:20:07,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Kind of like Heisenberg's rule of uncertainty principle where if you study something long enough its properties change dynamically so it keeps shifting around.

2071
02:20:09,595 --> 02:20:13,998
[SPEAKER_08]: In other words, you're still left with so many unopened questions and

2072
02:20:15,444 --> 02:20:18,325
[SPEAKER_08]: and it's getting to the point where we don't own things anymore.

2073
02:20:18,385 --> 02:20:27,987
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of like the Steam model being pigeonholed into the console even though it's not the appropriate medium.

2074
02:20:28,347 --> 02:20:33,908
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, do you blame Steam for what Xbox... Let's say worst case scenario is true with Xbox One.

2075
02:20:34,208 --> 02:20:35,388
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you blame Steam for that?

2076
02:20:35,488 --> 02:20:39,789
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you think that everybody's looking at Steam going, well, they get away with digital downloads?

2077
02:20:40,149 --> 02:20:44,430
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, it's expected that a console which for the...

2078
02:20:45,330 --> 02:20:46,691
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2079
02:21:09,443 --> 02:21:11,784
[SPEAKER_08]: is physical, it's tangible.

2080
02:21:11,904 --> 02:21:25,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Even though they do exist as game downloads and that's already accepted as a standard where you only own the license to that particular digital copy.

2081
02:21:26,131 --> 02:21:32,214
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you buy something tangible, wouldn't you expect that the first sale doctrine would apply to it?

2082
02:21:33,620 --> 02:21:34,741
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to disagree with Zaku.

2083
02:21:34,981 --> 02:21:35,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, hold on, hold on.

2084
02:21:35,782 --> 02:21:36,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Zaku, Zaku, Zaku.

2085
02:21:36,622 --> 02:21:38,323
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to disagree.

2086
02:21:38,363 --> 02:21:39,344
[SPEAKER_08]: Zaku, hello?

2087
02:21:40,824 --> 02:21:41,945
[SPEAKER_11]: Zaku, Earth to Zaku.

2088
02:21:42,105 --> 02:21:42,865
[SPEAKER_11]: Come in, Zaku.

2089
02:21:43,266 --> 02:21:44,206
[SPEAKER_11]: Zaku, stop talking.

2090
02:21:44,326 --> 02:21:45,767
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, Zaku, I've got to ask you this.

2091
02:21:46,628 --> 02:21:51,951
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I want to play devil's advocate, and this is important, because you say that we expect something tangible.

2092
02:21:52,211 --> 02:21:53,271
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not going to disagree with you.

2093
02:21:53,652 --> 02:21:54,892
[SPEAKER_11]: I like having the tangibleness.

2094
02:21:55,312 --> 02:21:59,275
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been very disappointed that manuals are going away, and instead we're getting these inserts.

2095
02:21:59,295 --> 02:21:59,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Me too.

2096
02:21:59,915 --> 02:22:00,055
[SPEAKER_11]: N64 N64 N64

2097
02:22:21,894 --> 02:22:23,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that is true.

2098
02:22:23,135 --> 02:22:33,863
[SPEAKER_08]: However, even with the disc error, starting with PlayStation and anything slightly earlier than that, you're able to lend it out to anybody, to your friends.

2099
02:22:34,404 --> 02:22:39,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, all of a sudden, Microsoft wants to impose paying for that game all over again.

2100
02:22:39,708 --> 02:22:45,952
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, when you buy something, you're presuming, it's pretty much common presumption that

2101
02:22:46,773 --> 02:22:48,254
[SPEAKER_08]: You pretty much own it.

2102
02:22:48,494 --> 02:22:50,974
[SPEAKER_08]: You're able to do what you want to lend it out.

2103
02:22:51,375 --> 02:22:55,136
[SPEAKER_08]: But in this case, for the Xbox One, it's a much tighter grip.

2104
02:22:55,836 --> 02:22:56,396
[SPEAKER_11]: It's equity.

2105
02:22:56,716 --> 02:23:00,398
[SPEAKER_11]: It's equity on your value.

2106
02:23:00,478 --> 02:23:03,139
[SPEAKER_11]: Like this huge wall of DVDs I'll never watch.

2107
02:23:03,239 --> 02:23:04,359
[SPEAKER_11]: They at least have equity.

2108
02:23:04,439 --> 02:23:07,440
[SPEAKER_11]: I could get 50 cents at a dimple or something.

2109
02:23:08,260 --> 02:23:36,207
[SPEAKER_11]: which is a local chain that buys these things per those discs it's like a house you buy a house and then you sell it for hopefully more money later on it's like a car you buy it and then you hopefully can sell it later on and I know a lot of people are saying a video game is different than a car but until now our games have had equity and now we're saying we might lose that and that is not good when you're asking me to pay $60 for a game that will be worth zero when I try to resell it

2110
02:23:36,627 --> 02:23:37,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't know.

2111
02:23:37,128 --> 02:23:37,508
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a rumor.

2112
02:23:37,528 --> 02:23:37,808
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a rumor.

2113
02:23:56,570 --> 02:23:58,431
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an exchange, so to speak.

2114
02:23:58,871 --> 02:24:04,612
[SPEAKER_08]: It's almost similar to how the Yankees basically opted out of StubHub to create their own ticket exchange.

2115
02:24:05,012 --> 02:24:13,675
[SPEAKER_08]: Up until last year, me and my girl were able to get home tickets for really good seats at below face value.

2116
02:24:14,415 --> 02:24:15,836
[SPEAKER_08]: and I think this is what's happening.

2117
02:24:16,096 --> 02:24:25,643
[SPEAKER_08]: They're taking the same approach where they want to cut out any other middleman and basically set their own terms and set their own prices for certain games.

2118
02:24:25,983 --> 02:24:28,385
[SPEAKER_11]: Holy crap, I just saw lightning in the background.

2119
02:24:28,425 --> 02:24:29,346
[SPEAKER_11]: That was crazy.

2120
02:24:29,366 --> 02:24:30,046
[SPEAKER_11]: Did you guys see that?

2121
02:24:30,386 --> 02:24:31,967
[SPEAKER_11]: Like totally flashed in his window there.

2122
02:24:32,328 --> 02:24:32,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

2123
02:24:32,748 --> 02:24:35,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's definitely the... This is why we don't do a video show.

2124
02:24:35,930 --> 02:24:36,771
[SPEAKER_11]: I get too distracted.

2125
02:24:37,011 --> 02:24:38,652
[SPEAKER_11]: There's something shiny behind you!

2126
02:24:39,352 --> 02:24:40,132
[SPEAKER_11]: Something shiny!

2127
02:24:54,878 --> 02:24:55,659
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura.com

2128
02:25:17,622 --> 02:25:25,549
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yeah, that too, and then mobile, which those issues were never a moot point to begin with.

2129
02:25:25,689 --> 02:25:28,332
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, they were never an issue to begin with.

2130
02:25:28,972 --> 02:25:35,739
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, everything on mobile is pretty much digital, so it's the same rules that apply to PC.

2131
02:25:36,700 --> 02:25:43,145
[SPEAKER_08]: And if it turns out that Sony's basically pulling the same tricks as Microsoft, then

2132
02:25:44,046 --> 02:25:53,220
[SPEAKER_08]: and God help them if they find a way to spin it really well, better than what Microsoft was able to, then yeah, there might be a crash long overdue.

2133
02:25:53,260 --> 02:25:57,886
[SPEAKER_08]: It might even happen a lot sooner if they flop at the end of the year or early next.

2134
02:25:58,607 --> 02:25:59,689
[SPEAKER_08]: People will still clutch

2135
02:26:00,410 --> 02:26:03,872
[SPEAKER_08]: to their existing 360s and PS3s like myself.

2136
02:26:04,172 --> 02:26:09,794
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope it's not an all-out crash because I know a lot of people in the industry that would be affected.

2137
02:26:10,675 --> 02:26:16,398
[SPEAKER_08]: As I said, I may have exaggerated when saying crash without adding context and scope.

2138
02:26:17,018 --> 02:26:19,979
[SPEAKER_08]: It will be a crash with traditional consoles.

2139
02:26:20,479 --> 02:26:27,783
[SPEAKER_08]: Mobile and any other casual aspects of gaming will be unscathed because they appeal to a broader audience.

2140
02:26:29,639 --> 02:26:29,919
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2141
02:26:30,379 --> 02:26:32,120
[SPEAKER_11]: Zaku, I got to let you go so we can wrap up the show.

2142
02:26:32,140 --> 02:26:33,161
[SPEAKER_11]: But thank you for your opinion.

2143
02:26:33,561 --> 02:26:33,881
[SPEAKER_11]: Take care.

2144
02:26:34,561 --> 02:26:34,841
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye.

2145
02:26:35,582 --> 02:26:35,962
[SPEAKER_11]: You too.

2146
02:26:36,122 --> 02:26:36,902
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't get hit by lightning.

2147
02:26:37,503 --> 02:26:37,763
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2148
02:26:38,103 --> 02:26:41,584
[SPEAKER_03]: I love when we get like really in-depth discussion like that, though.

2149
02:26:41,744 --> 02:26:42,345
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yeah.

2150
02:26:42,425 --> 02:26:47,787
[SPEAKER_11]: Zaku does, you know, love Zaku or hate him when he gets on his train where he won't let me talk.

2151
02:26:48,548 --> 02:26:49,628
[SPEAKER_11]: But he's very passionate.

2152
02:26:49,768 --> 02:26:50,408
[SPEAKER_11]: And I love that.

2153
02:26:50,528 --> 02:26:51,709
[SPEAKER_11]: I love all your guys' passion.

2154
02:26:51,729 --> 02:26:52,869
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what this show is all about.

2155
02:26:52,990 --> 02:26:53,510
[SPEAKER_11]: All you guys.

2156
02:26:54,370 --> 02:26:55,991
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love Utada Hikaru's passion.

2157
02:26:56,531 --> 02:26:57,352
[SPEAKER_11]: I do, it's a good song.

2158
02:26:57,452 --> 02:26:58,292
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes it is.

2159
02:26:58,392 --> 02:27:01,735
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you guys for putting up with our internet up and down fuckery tonight.

2160
02:27:01,775 --> 02:27:02,715
[SPEAKER_11]: We really appreciate it.

2161
02:27:03,596 --> 02:27:04,677
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll be back next week.

2162
02:27:04,757 --> 02:27:06,558
[SPEAKER_11]: Next week is the big pre-E3 show.

2163
02:27:06,838 --> 02:27:09,520
[SPEAKER_11]: That is the week to lock in our predictions and guess what guys?

2164
02:27:09,960 --> 02:27:16,585
[SPEAKER_11]: You know we gotta use this as an excuse to bring back Listless and the thing we most wanna happen, wanna see happen at E3 2013.

2165
02:27:17,105 --> 02:27:18,146
[SPEAKER_11]: So be thinking about it now.

2166
02:27:18,966 --> 02:27:21,428
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll be back one week from tonight to do all that.

2167
02:27:21,688 --> 02:27:23,549
[SPEAKER_11]: But in the meantime, it's time to end tonight's show.

2168
02:27:24,790 --> 02:27:30,373
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to let you know that there was a mention of a very old joke when I was hanging out with Jammer J. Oh God.

2169
02:27:30,714 --> 02:27:31,514
[SPEAKER_11]: Pantsless Rage.

2170
02:27:31,574 --> 02:27:32,334
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, of course.

2171
02:27:32,374 --> 02:27:32,795
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, look.

2172
02:27:33,595 --> 02:27:36,757
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, any other last minute stories before we wrap it up and say print?

2173
02:27:36,977 --> 02:27:37,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Shadow Warrior.

2174
02:27:38,458 --> 02:27:39,659
[SPEAKER_07]: You remember it's being remade?

2175
02:27:39,699 --> 02:27:42,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the classic is available free on Steam forever.

2176
02:27:43,041 --> 02:27:44,041
[SPEAKER_07]: So go play it.

2177
02:27:44,241 --> 02:27:47,703
[SPEAKER_07]: And then finally, the Super Mario Bros.

2178
02:27:47,783 --> 02:27:51,285
[SPEAKER_07]: movie has celebrated its 20th anniversary.

2179
02:27:53,647 --> 02:27:53,947
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

2180
02:27:54,907 --> 02:27:55,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2181
02:27:56,088 --> 02:28:07,397
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and one other thing that Steam does better than the Xbox One, the Alan Wake series on the Xbox 360 right now is $20.

2182
02:28:08,278 --> 02:28:08,758
[SPEAKER_07]: $4 on Steam.

2183
02:28:09,799 --> 02:28:14,062
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why people don't mind DRM, because you can get a series of games for $4.

2184
02:28:14,163 --> 02:28:19,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Or the Humble Bundle, where you can get the entire franchise, like 20 games for $5.

2185
02:28:19,447 --> 02:28:19,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

2186
02:28:23,670 --> 02:28:27,352
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, that is going to do it there for another episode of Orange Lawns Radio.

2187
02:28:27,472 --> 02:28:37,377
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you guys very much for tuning into our show, whether it be live and putting up with the connection issues or listening on the podcast feed, taking the time out to download us or through an app like TuneIn or Stitcher or one of those.

[SPEAKER_11]: We really appreciate it no matter how you listen to the show.

2189
02:28:40,018 --> 02:28:43,180
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would like to give a shout out to somebody who said she would be downloading the show.

2190
02:28:43,980 --> 02:28:45,821
[SPEAKER_03]: To Blue Sigma from Tumblr.

2191
02:28:46,201 --> 02:28:47,502
[SPEAKER_11]: More people that I don't know.

2192
02:28:48,001 --> 02:28:48,842
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

2193
02:29:09,055 --> 02:29:10,916
[SPEAKER_11]: So just spread the word about our show.

2194
02:29:10,956 --> 02:29:11,416
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all we have.

2195
02:29:11,436 --> 02:29:13,517
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't spam, but spread the word about our show.

2196
02:29:13,557 --> 02:29:14,097
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell a friend.

2197
02:29:14,837 --> 02:29:16,758
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell somebody who might appreciate what we're doing here.

2198
02:29:17,018 --> 02:29:18,899
[SPEAKER_11]: And spread the love of independent podcasting.

2199
02:29:18,959 --> 02:29:23,680
[SPEAKER_11]: If you think our show is shit, then thank you for at least listening to the whole thing before you decided it was shit.

2200
02:29:24,060 --> 02:29:26,161
[SPEAKER_11]: Go download another great independent podcast.

2201
02:29:26,181 --> 02:29:28,022
[SPEAKER_11]: There's lots of great content producers out there.

2202
02:29:28,282 --> 02:29:30,303
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got a whole ton of them here at the Voice of Geeks Network.

2203
02:29:30,343 --> 02:29:36,205
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody from Bobby Blackwolf, Understation Live, Girls Gone Wild, Anime Jam Session, PodCulture.

2204
02:29:36,245 --> 02:29:36,785
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody, everybody.

2205
02:29:37,185 --> 02:29:37,726
[SPEAKER_11]: E3.vognetwork.com

2206
02:29:56,282 --> 02:29:57,844
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that's really it.

2207
02:29:58,344 --> 02:30:00,006
[SPEAKER_11]: Now we can go around and get everybody's final thought.

2208
02:30:00,366 --> 02:30:05,690
[SPEAKER_11]: So my final thought tonight, I'll start, is that it's time to check in for my airline because I want a good seat.

2209
02:30:06,471 --> 02:30:07,472
[SPEAKER_11]: Loki, your final thought tonight.

2210
02:30:07,872 --> 02:30:08,733
[SPEAKER_11]: AC's not working.

2211
02:30:09,594 --> 02:30:09,714
[SPEAKER_11]: Boo.

2212
02:30:11,240 --> 02:30:15,942
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2213
02:30:40,471 --> 02:30:46,776
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I am done with him, hopefully, because I never sleep, so it might be tonight, I will post pictures up.

2214
02:30:46,976 --> 02:30:47,856
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they happy feet?

2215
02:30:49,097 --> 02:30:51,339
[SPEAKER_03]: They're kind of deflated because they have no stuffing.

2216
02:30:51,779 --> 02:30:54,961
[SPEAKER_03]: But I could put them on my fingers and pretend they're real feet.

2217
02:30:55,862 --> 02:30:56,302
[SPEAKER_03]: See, look.

2218
02:30:57,082 --> 02:30:58,043
[SPEAKER_11]: Real feet.

2219
02:30:58,844 --> 02:31:00,325
[SPEAKER_11]: You need a little picture of that for OLR.com.

2220
02:31:00,365 --> 02:31:01,846
[SPEAKER_03]: I am scale mate feet.

2221
02:31:01,966 --> 02:31:02,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Little pictures of your happy feet.

2222
02:31:02,766 --> 02:31:07,389
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm going to name my scale mate Sir No Stuffing or something.

2223
02:31:07,409 --> 02:31:07,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2224
02:31:08,510 --> 02:31:08,770
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

2225
02:31:08,950 --> 02:31:09,811
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll name him Stouffer.

2226
02:31:10,272 --> 02:31:11,152
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, that's it.

2227
02:31:11,272 --> 02:31:11,753
[SPEAKER_11]: We're done.

2228
02:31:11,893 --> 02:31:12,453
[SPEAKER_11]: We're out of here.

2229
02:31:12,754 --> 02:31:14,075
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you guys very much for tuning in.

2230
02:31:14,135 --> 02:31:16,097
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, if you like the show, please help spread the word.

2231
02:31:16,137 --> 02:31:16,817
[SPEAKER_11]: We're an indie show.

2232
02:31:16,877 --> 02:31:19,099
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have big money to be selling ads.

2233
02:31:19,459 --> 02:31:22,922
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have the type of listener base that's going to give us a quarter of a million dollars on Kickstarter.

2234
02:31:23,283 --> 02:31:25,184
[SPEAKER_11]: All we have is word of mouth and we appreciate it.

2235
02:31:25,465 --> 02:31:26,485
[SPEAKER_11]: Have a wonderful night, everybody.

2236
02:31:26,646 --> 02:31:28,147
