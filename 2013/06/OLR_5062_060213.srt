Orange Lounge Radio

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, June 2, 2013, One Country has a strong statement about the Xbox One.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Blizzard postpones its next MMO.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And could legendary buried game cartridges in the desert soon be unearthed?

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 506, 2nd Mix, J-Append for this June 2, 2013.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'll explain the title in a minute here.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
But welcome back to the show everybody, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers?

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Can we call this one a go-to mix instead?

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Whatever you want it to be.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Can we have true kiss destination?

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
No.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Club append!

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
They weren't that good, let's be real.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Well, if their career didn't last that long.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Dreams come true lasted longer than them.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Also say hello to Techmaster Loki.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Hi.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Hi, how you doing, Loki?

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Pretty good.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Excellent. And of course, my name is Rob Roberts and we do join you live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of the Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Alright, so last week was a little weird.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We weren't actually here live on Sunday.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We did a special show earlier in the week which we called episode number 506.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
But then it was brought to my attention.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You're gonna ruin all the like tracking of the classic game of the week and all these segments you usually do if you give a special episode a regular episode number.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So, I broke it.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Just put a blank in there. How damn hard is that?

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Give it a letter.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's fine.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's episode R.

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
We'll just have 506, 2nd Mix.

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's a do-over. We'll do it live.

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Because it's not an episode unless I'm here, let's face it.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So, episode 2 was not an episode?

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
No, it wasn't. That was when I was sleeping in the Harry Potter room at the Gay Frat House.

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Alright, so last week you were in Alabama, right?

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yes.

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And you were taking care of mostly some family stuff.

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yes.

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But you did get to hang out with like you met like at least one OLR listener, right?

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I got to hang out with Jammer Jay who I have known for quite some time and there's a little bit of background.

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
About 10 years ago we met up and played DDR together and I got his games and I think I got him like dinner.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So, this time he paid for my games and got me dinner and took me to McGuire's in Pensacola and I got shit-faced.

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I drank, okay, McGuire's is like a small microbrewery and they do their own stouts and porters.

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I had a good porter, but then they served me this drink called an Irish Wake that's very green and served in a mason jar and I consumed it.

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And I was very dizzy the rest of the ride.

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And then I got a sunburn in the shape, well my tan line is in the shape of a seatbelt because we were riding in a convertible and I stopped caring about the sun.

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So, but we did go to Pace, Florida and play a lot of DDR and played some Addams Family pinball at another arcade at the Pensacola beach.

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And then I ran into, I spent some time with my mama's son and papa's son and their roommates Kristen and Bobby, a different Bobby of course.

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And I got to see Derek who is one of my very good friends.

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And all these people none of our listeners know.

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And my good friend Donovan who, they're both fixtures at Dragon Con, you may run into them.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And I got to see my very good friend Jen, she picked me up when my flight was changed from Gulfport to Mobile.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Do not get me started on American Airlines because fuck them.

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I heard about your drama going, I'm on an airplane tomorrow and you have me a little worried.

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Are you doing American?

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
No.

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Good, fuck them.

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Well who owns US Air now, that's United right?

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I don't know, yeah I rode United back and I had no problem.

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
They even had a movie and they had snack boxes that had Nutella in them.

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So fuck you American Airlines, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
At least they're refunding me 75 bucks in toiletries and clothes that I had to buy.

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Guess what I found at Goodwill in Alabama, in Daphne, Alabama.

68
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I found a Charlie the Unicorn shirt that says sparkle, sparkle, sparkle, sparkle on it.

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I don't care if I can wear it or not.

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Is there a hot topic in Alabama that could have come from?

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Well we had Gadzooks I think, but at any rate I bought a Charlie the Unicorn shirt at a Goodwill in Daphne, Alabama.

72
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Nice.

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So.

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Shine the non-believer.

75
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Anyhow, just a special note for our live listeners.

76
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
We're aware that there's some errors where it's cutting in and out.

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's nothing on our end. We're not doing anything out of the ordinary.

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
There's no torrents or anything like that.

79
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So we're going to chalk this up to our amazing internet service provider.

80
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
But we just got to keep on right on taping for the sake of the podcast.

81
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
If you do get dumped from the stream, just click pause and play again if you're at live.vognetwork.com.

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And it should reconnect right away as soon as we come back.

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Unfortunately I don't know what to do about it.

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The joys of live radio.

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I might have upset the cosmic balance by my sewing.

86
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Possibly.

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm doing matronly things.

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Can you sew the internet back together?

89
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Uh, no.

90
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Get a really big needle.

91
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I have really tiny needles.

92
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And I keep poking myself in the thumb.

93
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
That's not going to work.

94
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Alright, so you missed our Xbone special.

95
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Excuse me, our XB1 special.

96
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
All the stuff about the Xbox One.

97
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Did you hear anything about Xbox One?

98
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yes, and fuck all of it.

99
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Not getting it. No.

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Well, now wait a minute, DarkSakura.

101
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And I think I said this on the show.

102
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Isn't it too early to make up your mind on this?

103
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Right now, going by what I have, fuck them.

104
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And why so strongly?

105
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Because I don't want to have a microphone and or a camera on all the damn time.

106
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The whole used games thing, fuck them.

107
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
The whole downloading games, fuck them even more.

108
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
If I'm going to download a game, it's going to be on my PC.

109
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Or, you know, if I buy another PC, guess what?

110
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
My games will transfer.

111
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Okay, well to be fair, to play devil's advocate, what's the difference between getting a digital copy on your PC that you can't sell back and a digital...

112
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Because I can upgrade my video card.

113
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I can upgrade everything on my PC and make everything look amazing.

114
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So in a way, you're saying a PC is pretty much guaranteed to be backwards compatible, no matter what.

115
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Pretty much.

116
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Where's the X... Okay, I guess that's fair because the Xbox 360, anything you downloaded...

117
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I've been playing Loom.

118
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You're just old school like that.

119
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:40,000
If I can play Loom, thanks to Steam, if I can play all kinds of old PC, if I can play text-based games, if I can play Oregon Trail on my PC, I have no problem.

120
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

121
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Of course, again, we do tape live every Sunday night right after Bobby Black Wolf.

122
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's 6 Pacific 9 Eastern on Sundays.

123
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Gamergirl says, thank you Dark Sakura. Clap, clap.

124
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
That's exactly why I don't want one either.

125
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Koopa Kid Jeremy says, I think it's too early to decide that it's not for you.

126
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I kind of agree.

127
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Could anything at E3 end up swaying your mind?

128
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
That's what I'm curious about.

129
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What if they come out and say, the big rumor is Killer Instinct.

130
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's going to be one of the games.

131
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What if one of these 15 games is like, OMG, you gotta have.

132
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
What if there's a Homestuck game, Jamie?

133
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
What if there's a Homestuck game?

134
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Well, I know for a fact already that I don't think it's, well, I think it's going to be PC anyway.

135
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
What if, what if, what if Mass Effect 4 is an Xbox One exclusive?

136
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It's not.

137
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's already going to be running on PC.

138
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
What if, Jamie? What if?

139
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I don't know that that would be enough because fuck EA.

140
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Now, keep in mind, as I've said before, I reserve judgment for more information, but as it stands right now, fuck them.

141
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And the horse they rode in on.

142
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So they need to make some big clarifications.

143
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Yes, they do. Or big changes.

144
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,000
They need to realize, because I think that they say statements like this and when they see people going, oh no, they go, oh shit.

145
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Time to change it.

146
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Which is kind of where Sony might be at right now because there's really nothing out there that has said the PlayStation 4 is not going to do the exact same thing.

147
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:11,000
But I think Sony is very much kind of watching this whole thing. They're kind of like sitting up there with their little opera glasses, looking at what's happening on the stage.

148
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You know, like what is happening to Microsoft?

149
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
To tell SSJ100 Matt, is Dan getting it? We're, I think, kind of on the same boat right now.

150
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And keep in mind, you know, we aren't really the console gamers that we used to be.

151
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Did I tell you that my mom gave me an Atari PC game?

152
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
We don't own the system, so actually I was looking for one.

153
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
But, I mean, other than that, you know, we're not the big console gamers we used to be.

154
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Dan's really into sim racing. He's been, you know, hooking up his PC.

155
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I think that for him it's going to be more of the next Gran Turismo game.

156
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Of course, it's just going to be PS3, but he's going to probably stick Sony.

157
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You know, especially, you know, if they say something that's going to counter all of the crap that Microsoft is saying.

158
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So, it was sort of a wait and see kind of thing.

159
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Alright, well, I'm going to check in with you again after E3 and see if anything that has happened may have changed your mind.

160
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Oh, and to tell RageNator about Fuck Activision, I did quit WoW before I went to Alabama.

161
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Now that everybody is reuniting in our guild.

162
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Two people came back to WoW, Jamie. Two people. It's not everybody.

163
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Well, we better do, like, an old raid or something before my account expires.

164
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I thought your account already expired.

165
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
No, I've got a couple days left on it. I'll find out when it expires.

166
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
There you go.

167
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And then let me do, like, Ice Crown Citadel.

168
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You should go to Karazhan and get the pets.

169
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I want pets.

170
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
There's new pets in Karazhan.

171
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Stop it.

172
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Just saying.

173
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Stop it. I stopped paying for it.

174
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Wow, crack. Wow, crack.

175
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I did delete the beta, so that did free up a lot of space.

176
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
But then I filled it up with, like, more games on Steam.

177
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Isn't that how it always goes?

178
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Shut up.

179
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I just cleared off 100 gigs from my hard drive.

180
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
God damn it. Steam sale. God damn it. Humble Bundle. God damn it.

181
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You don't have to install all of them.

182
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Yes, you do.

183
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
No, I don't have them all installed. I have a bunch.

184
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I actually have, like, the majority of them not installed.

185
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
How dare you? I don't know when I might want to play.

186
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You just never know.

187
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And I can never uninstall something, because the minute I uninstall it, what happens?

188
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
An entire call. Gran Turismo 6 has already been stated to be for PS3.

189
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
All right, anyhow.

190
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Keep me strong. Tie me to the mast.

191
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I will hear the song, but I shall not succumb.

192
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
This is my finger. Well, I've got a needle in my hand.

193
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
This is my finger raised at Activision and Blizzard.

194
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Sit and spin, motherfuckers.

195
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Or pay for my account.

196
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Oh, boy. You're just... Is there anything in gaming you do like this week?

197
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I started playing Mass Effect again.

198
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And guess what, Rob?

199
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
God, I... I just can't. I can't.

200
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Like she won't get an Xbox One if it's Mass Effect 4.

201
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Right, exactly. It totally answers my earlier question.

202
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Totally answers my... Who is she? Fucking kidding, all right?

203
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Who is she?

204
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
No!

205
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Oh, I can resist playing another Mass Effect game.

206
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Nope. LOL. Nope.

207
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The minute... The minute Garris in HD...

208
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
There will not be a Garris in...

209
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Okay, here's...

210
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
They already said Mass Effect 4 is a different story.

211
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Okay, here we go. Here we go, guys. Here we go.

212
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Okay, this is the first OLR comic strip I need somebody to draw, okay?

213
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You can bite my ass along with Activision Lizard and EA.

214
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Here it is. Here it is. First panel.

215
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Dark Sakura holding a microphone saying,

216
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I will not buy an Xbox One. Fuck them. Fuck them and their stupid asses.

217
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
No.

218
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Okay, ready? Second panel is a picture of the E3 press conference

219
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
where EA and Microsoft are holding hands on a stage saying,

220
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Mass Effect Garris Edition Xbox One exclusive.

221
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And then the third panel is Dark Sakura walking into a Best Buy

222
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
with a balloon that says, LOL NOPE.

223
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Probably.

224
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
LOL NOPE.

225
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Okay, okay, okay.

226
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Well, first of all, I'm fairly certain that with a franchise like that,

227
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
they will not make it an exclusive.

228
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
They won't. This is just fan-waking.

229
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm only saying this to get you ruffled and it's working.

230
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You know what?

231
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You are about to earn yourself the mother of all girl.

232
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Just saying.

233
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Okay, this is this.

234
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And to go ahead and put the blanket thing out there.

235
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Yes, I will get Mass Effect 4 because I love the universe.

236
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I don't care how shitty the story is.

237
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I don't care how sparkly the turd is.

238
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I love the turd.

239
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I will buy the sparkly turd because I am a fangirl.

240
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
There's her little quote for the next show intro.

241
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I love the turd.

242
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
All right.

243
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You know what?

244
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I have pointy things.

245
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You see all these little pins?

246
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Yes, and you too can get points at vognetwork.com.

247
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
That's vognetwork.com where we announced earlier this evening on Bobby Black Wolf Show.

248
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
All sorts of new loot now available on the site

249
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
and an awesome new feature for covering conventions.

250
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
There's a video to explain it all to you,

251
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
but in a nutshell, you will be able to direct our very own network,

252
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Bobby Black Wolf representative, Bobby Black Wolf.

253
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
He will be at E3 answering your questions as you direct him on the show floor.

254
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It's all explained for you at e3.vognetwork.com.

255
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Check it out.

256
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Let's get into how was your gaming week,

257
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
and we'll talk about the types of video games you've been playing this week.

258
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Dark Soccer, why don't you start us off?

259
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Lul, Mass Effect.

260
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Of course.

261
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
No, no, no. Guess what?

262
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I bought Dramamine so that I can do the makeup missions.

263
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
God, I'm awful.

264
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I have ginger pills and Dramamine.

265
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
You bought drugs so you can play Mass Effect.

266
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Yes.

267
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Because last time I played...

268
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Okay, last time I had a nice two-hour session of getting side missions out of the way,

269
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
and I literally had to stop playing after...

270
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Stop it.

271
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Do not YouTube me, Rob.

272
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Rob.

273
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Have you ever played...

274
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Don't watch what I'm doing over here.

275
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Keep talking.

276
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So I decided that I didn't want to get motion sick again,

277
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
so I have plenty of things to keep me from getting sick to my stomach,

278
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
hopefully, just because I get super motion sick on Mako missions.

279
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I also downloaded a bunch of...

280
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It's called the ultimate high-res mod or something for the first Mass Effect

281
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
that has made my game look absolutely freaking gorgeous.

282
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Like, pretty.

283
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
And so I have been...

284
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'm still on the stupid first mission right after a dumbass gets shot,

285
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
which we all know who dumbass is.

286
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Jenkins, sorry.

287
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
So I am right after that part in my game,

288
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
and it kind of doesn't like all the mods,

289
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
but I don't care because it makes my game pretty.

290
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
And I play DDR.

291
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
So again, to clarify, you bought drugs so you could play a drug.

292
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
No.

293
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I had the gender on.

294
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Like I'm walking on sunshine.

295
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Have you ever played Mass Effect?

296
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Like I'm walking on sunshine.

297
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
No.

298
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And for the record, anyone who's a fan of the first Mass Effect

299
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
that is interested in this mod, talk to me.

300
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
So I played a lot of DDR.

301
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
My calves hurt for the next two days.

302
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And my skin did.

303
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Oh no, I stretched.

304
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I was doing yoga in an arcade, okay?

305
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
But it was very fun.

306
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And so if you go to the one and only DDR machine

307
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
in all of Pace, Florida,

308
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
and you see D-Sakura explanation point,

309
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
that is me.

310
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
On two whole songs.

311
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Two.

312
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Until they reset the leaderboard at night.

313
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Shut up.

314
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
But I was feeling old, so I passed Superstar and it made me good.

315
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,000
So yeah, I also played a lot of Midway Arcade

316
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
for tickets on my iPad.

317
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Oh, I was like, the classic Midway games, like Joust and stuff.

318
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Well yeah, but I was playing pool.

319
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I could not stop playing stupid pool.

320
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
If you just want tickets in that game, just play the skeeball.

321
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You can just go like this, fling fling fling fling fling fling fling tickets.

322
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You play one game of pool and you get 200 points.

323
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Even if you scratch it on your first one, you still get 75 points.

324
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I didn't know that.

325
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
So yeah.

326
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
So I was like, pool, pool.

327
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I was so mind numbingly bored.

328
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Because like, people sleep.

329
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's like, I was still like, okay.

330
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I actually managed to get off of West Coast time

331
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
because of the 40 hours I stayed awake due to

332
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
nine hour layovers, another three hour layover,

333
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
flight delays, waiting on my luggage.

334
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Then lying to my face about where my luggage was,

335
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
when I laid down on my grandmother's bed,

336
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
for a moment I was like, oh, the bed's kind of crooked.

337
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And then it was daylight.

338
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
So my time completely reset while I was there.

339
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
So I, but my, still my night owl thing was like,

340
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
it's eight o'clock and I'm not out doing stuff.

341
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
This is not me.

342
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
So it was very bizarre.

343
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
So yeah, I played a lot of Midway Arcade and Blazing Star.

344
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Because I have Blazing Star on my iPad

345
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
and that game is awesome.

346
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
The end.

347
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
The end.

348
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Loki, how about you?

349
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Let's see.

350
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Well, this week I played More Saints Row the Third,

351
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
just trying to finish up my last few achievements on there.

352
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,000
And then also played a bit of TrackMania.

353
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
We tried to do VOG Gaming Night on that

354
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
and it just wasn't having, it was weird

355
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I did everything correctly.

356
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Like one person was able to join my game,

357
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
everybody else was not able to join my game.

358
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
And then we decided, hey, let's play on a third party server.

359
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
So we just picked a server at random

360
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
that we were able to connect to.

361
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
And then it just like had the weirdest fucking tracks ever.

362
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Just these giant maze tracks

363
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
that were impossible to figure out where the hell you were supposed to go.

364
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It was ridiculous.

365
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
But we had a little bit of fun.

366
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
And then I played a little bit of Cave Story Plus.

367
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And I'll say play a very little bit of Call of Duty

368
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
because everyone was flaking the entire week.

369
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
So that's pretty much it.

370
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
My gaming week.

371
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Over the Memorial Day weekend I was staying with Captain Spike and Tim

372
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
who were on a previous episode a few weeks ago

373
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
at their Memorial Day soiree.

374
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
And so we played a few video games.

375
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
We watched them play Trivial Pursuit on the Xbox.

376
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Which was kind of frustrating how long that game was going on

377
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
because you know it's Trivial Pursuit and LOL.

378
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And we went out to GameStop one day randomly

379
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
to go find a cheap game to play.

380
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
And we ended up buying Wheel of Fortune.

381
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I should say Spike ended up buying Wheel of Fortune on the Xbox 360.

382
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And many lulls ensued.

383
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
What can I say about it?

384
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm like, you know exactly what you're going to get

385
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
with a game like Wheel of Fortune.

386
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Because you've seen the game show at some point in your life, yes?

387
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Although I have to admit the characters are a little bit derpy

388
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
and some of the unlocks are a little bit silly.

389
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
But for 20 bucks, hey!

390
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
It provided a little bit of entertainment.

391
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
And some really, really hilarious instances where we were solving puzzles incorrectly

392
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
and throwing each other off and so forth.

393
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
So that was fun.

394
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
As far as other stuff I've been playing during the week,

395
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I was keeping it retro.

396
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And thanks to some conversations I was having on Twitter

397
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
with not just Spike but Jeremy from Koopa Club

398
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
and some of the other people I talk with on Twitter,

399
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I was reminded that Mario 2 came out on Virtual Console for Wii U.

400
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And I was like, oh, I had that on the Wii,

401
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
so I should just spend the dollar or whatever to upgrade it and play it.

402
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
And not only did I play it, I played it from start to finish.

403
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Granted, I cheated and I used warps.

404
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
But I used only Luigi the whole way through the game.

405
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
In my nod to Year of Luigi, I beat Mario 2 using only Luigi.

406
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
And I'm going to tell you what.

407
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Those ice stages that you have to play even when you warp suck with Luigi.

408
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Yes, they do.

409
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Because I'm used to using the princess to just float through those little,

410
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
not the shy guys, what do you call the flying ones with the pitchfork?

411
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I don't remember their names.

412
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
The flurries? No, the flurries are the guys on the ground.

413
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Yeah, the little dudes on the ground that look like little jiggly cuffs.

414
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I don't remember what they're called. I call them bastards.

415
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Yeah, they're little fuckers.

416
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
So the little fuckers are flying in the air and the princess is easy.

417
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
You just float in between them.

418
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
But not so easy when you're Luigi.

419
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
But I did it. I did it.

420
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
When I beat the game and that was fun.

421
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
So yeah, I was keeping it retro this week.

422
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I got to say, there's something about Wii U Virtual Console

423
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
and I'm totally having to eat my words from what I said earlier on this program

424
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
about a year ago when I was like,

425
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Wii U Virtual Console is going to be stupid.

426
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Why would I pay money to upgrade and dah dah dah.

427
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It's just a better experience and I can't put my finger on it.

428
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I don't know if it's the HDMI.

429
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I don't know if it's the sound from the tablet

430
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
and the sound from the speakers at the same time.

431
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I don't know, but it is a better experience.

432
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
So, oops, I was wrong.

433
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
It happens.

434
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
So yeah, I was having fun with Mario 2 on Virtual Console

435
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
and then I was playing Warcraft because, you know, I'm...

436
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Addict.

437
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Well, I hit 90 with my Hunter, my Blood Elf Hunter.

438
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
My PVP character.

439
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
If you get sassy to 90...

440
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Sassy is 87.

441
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
In a row? No.

442
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
When you get sassy to 90, I will re-up WoW for one month.

443
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Just to play with sassy.

444
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Because I like the braids. They float.

445
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Jeremy is coaching me in chat, I guess, saying,

446
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You warped. I said I warped.

447
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
My next goal is to do it without warping,

448
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
but unfortunately I'm on a work trip this week

449
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
and then I have all the E3 stuff.

450
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Oh, I'm not going to E3. There's other stuff going on.

451
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
So it's going to be a little while before I can get through the game without warping.

452
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
But that's on the list.

453
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Except for the fact that Animal Crossing comes out Sunday

454
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
and then the list will be shot because, yay, Animal Crossing.

455
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Alright.

456
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
It actually comes out on Fri-

457
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I thought it was Sunday. Yeah.

458
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Nintendo games are usually Sunday.

459
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Last of Us is coming out on a Friday.

460
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Oh, is it this Friday?

461
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Next Friday.

462
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
The E3 Friday? Wow.

463
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I don't know why. Interesting.

464
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Well, if no other big games are coming out, then why not?

465
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Most of America doesn't go to E3, so it doesn't really matter.

466
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Why a Friday street day? Just put it on Tuesday.

467
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Why not? Just in time for the weekend.

468
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Why do movies sometimes open on Wednesday?

469
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
They just- they do.

470
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Rob. What?

471
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Do you sometimes just wonder why?

472
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Do you ever feel not so fresh?

473
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
First of all, I am incredibly crescent fresh.

474
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And second of all, the answer to why?

475
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Because.

476
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And then deal with it.

477
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
See if that works with a six year old, by the way.

478
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
With the floating sunglasses.

479
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Did you tell the child to deal with it and then have sunglasses land on your face?

480
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
No, but I'm going to do that next time.

481
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
That's hilarious to see Julian's reaction.

482
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Alright, housekeeping.

483
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000

I know Act F just reviewed

492
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Dust and Elysian Tail

493
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
was on the

494
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000

495
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000

Not the first, we'll be the second.

500
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
And that's okay. We're number two.

501
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Silver medal for VOG.

502
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
It'll be great.

503
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Let's get into some news.

504
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Speaking of Xbox One and all that.

505
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Lots of clarifications since our last show.

506
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Yes, Logie?

507
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
A little bit. This isn't really much of a clarification

508
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
other than just bragging.

509
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Saying that they're investing one billion dollars

510
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
ONE BILLION DOLLARS

511
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
into the

512
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
putting games on the Xbox One.

513
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
So I'm assuming a lot of that

514
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
has to do with the 15 exclusives

515
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
that they, I guess, paid for.

516
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
And will be coming out the first year.

517
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
And then

518
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
didn't really hint at a whole lot

519
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
of what's coming other than

520
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
we know there's a Rare game coming.

521
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
And apparently Black Tusk Studios

522
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
is working on something.

523
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Yeah.

524
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Microsoft Studios

525
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
is obviously working on stuff.

526
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
We know that there's going to be a new Forza.

527
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Remedy's got that Quantum Break game.

528
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And EA's got some stuff.

529
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Not necessarily exclusive, but

530
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
features that are somewhat

531
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
exclusive, I guess. I don't know.

532
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
So yeah.

533
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
They're spending quite a bit of money on that stuff.

534
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Of course, we're going to have to

535
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
figure out what that is.

536
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Maybe one of these announcements

537
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
has to do with a bunch of these

538
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
domains that they're registering, including

539
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
domains pertaining to a title called

540
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Halo Spartan Assault.

541
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Which doesn't sound

542
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
like a

543
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
you know, it almost sounds like

544
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
an arcade game or something. Like a

545
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
spin-off.

546
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
So, I guess we'll have to wait

547
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
and see. Could it be maybe an upgrade

548
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
or something? I'm hoping

549
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
it's not that. Remember, wasn't

550
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
there supposed to be like a

551
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Kinect-powered

552
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
game or something like that?

553
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Remember, they were doing that with Gears of War,

554
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I remember. Maybe it's like a Kinect

555
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Halo game or something.

556
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I don't know.

557
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Joy, I can flail around and choose

558
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
weapons. Didn't one of the Halo

559
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
games like ODST or something incorporate Kinect?

560
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Like, you could shout

561
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
grenade and it was your grenade? No, that was the

562
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Halo Combat Evolved HD

563
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
thing. Oh yeah, that one.

564
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Combat Evolved Anniversary.

565
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Where you can shout grenade. There was a lot

566
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
of Halo games. I'm sorry, can you shout grenade

567
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
faster than you can press a button? No.

568
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
No, you cannot. And that's

569
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
assuming that the Kinect hears you and understands

570
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
what you asked for. It would only be useful

571
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
as if what you're yelling is, how do I throw a grenade?

572
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
It just does it.

573
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Oh hey, it worked! How do I throw

574
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
a grenade? Anyway.

575
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Win!

576
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Speaking of

577
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
the Kinect being able to hear you,

578
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
one of the controversial things, of course, we

579
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
got into during last week's show, I

580
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
expressed that this concerns me a little bit.

581
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
DarkSakura certainly expressed earlier this

582
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
concerns her a bit. And you

583
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
know who else is concerned? Germany.

584
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Well, anyway, the

585
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
German Federal Commissioner for Data Protection

586
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
and Freedom of Information. I did

587
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
not know that such a position existed in Germany,

588
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
but I guess it makes sense.

589
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Certainly you want to make sure that

590
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
everything is regulated

591
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
when it comes to those exchanges,

592
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
but to a fault.

593
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Anyhow, he calls it the

594
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Xbox One Kinect

595
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
monitoring device.

596
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
That's because it is. It is.

597
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
And he goes on to say,

598
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
under the heading game device, this is through

599
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
a translation that he mentioned

600
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
with the website

601
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Spiegel.de, but this is through

602
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
a translation, under the heading

603
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
game device, Microsoft

604
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
pushes a monitoring device in the market.

605
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
The Xbox continuously records

606
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
all sorts of personal information about me.

607
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Reaction rates, my learning

608
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
or emotional states, these are then

609
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
processed on an external server and

610
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
possibly even passed on to third parties.

611
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Whether they will ever be deleted,

612
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
the person cannot influence.

613
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
It absolutely is.

614
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
It's what it is. It's marketing

615
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
metrics is what it is. They're going to be

616
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
listening to

617
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
stuff that you're talking about, and they're going to

618
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
advertise to you. They're going to target advertising.

619
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
And it's just like on Facebook

620
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
where they try to target advertising,

621
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
but they're going to also make sure that

622
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
hey, are you paying attention to

623
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
those ads? What ads are

624
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
interesting you? That kind of stuff.

625
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
So they're going into greater detail. And that information

626
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
is worth a ton

627
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
of money. So on top of

628
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
them making money off the console

629
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
and live and all that stuff and advertising

630
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
on the front page even though

631
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
you're paying for an online service,

632
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
they're going to be selling your marketing data

633
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
for a ton of money because they can do

634
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
that. That's why you're getting achievements for watching TV.

635
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
It's because you're watching the ads.

636
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Because they're getting all that ad data.

637
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Well, in Microsoft's

638
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
defense, kind of the counter to this

639
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
was from Microsoft corporate vice

640
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
president Phil Harrison. And if that

641
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
name sounds familiar, it's because he used to work for a

642
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
different video game company, but now he works for Microsoft.

643
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
And he was talking to Eurogamer about

644
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
privacy concerns, and he said that Microsoft

645
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
is a quote, leader in the world of

646
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
privacy. Continuing, we aren't

647
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
using Kinect to snoop on anybody at

648
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
all. We listen for the word

649
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
box on, then switch on the machine.

650
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
But we don't transmit personal data

651
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
in any way, shape or form

652
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
that could be

653
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
personally identifiable to you

654
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
unless you explicitly opt into

655
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
that. What's interesting about that is

656
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
that basically he's saying it is there.

657
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
You just have to opt into it, right?

658
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
And I remember their excuse was, well, but you can

659
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
turn the console off. You can

660
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
power the console off.

661
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Unplug it.

662
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
So it sounds to me like Microsoft is

663
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
going to have to really clarify this. And it's

664
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
a valid concern about this. You know, when I got into

665
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
this last week is that I don't want no

666
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Xbox filming me when I'm running around in my underwear

667
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
trying to get coffee in the morning or whatever.

668
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
You know, I don't need that. You know?

669
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Who knows? Who knows what might be said

670
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
when I yell to Allen in the other

671
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
room and suddenly I'm calling dark

672
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
soccer on Kinect and things are awkward.

673
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
You know what I mean?

674
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
All I gotta say is you're going to be

675
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
getting a lot of targeted Pinkberry advertisements.

676
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
And

677
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
and Keurig.

678
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Right? Pinkberry and Keurig. Right?

679
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I'll be there with you.

680
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Except for the Keurig part.

681
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
You said to buy enough of it.

682
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Just saying if I ever get the console, I'm just

683
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
talking about pornography whenever I'm in front of it.

684
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Here's what I was thinking about

685
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
though with the Xbox One

686
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
is that if I get one, which you know

687
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I'm still on the fence. I don't feel

688
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
as strongly as Jamie does, what she said

689
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
earlier in the show, but I kind of have

690
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
very similar concerns to what she already said.

691
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
To me it's very similar to how I

692
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
felt with the Wii U. It's like, okay

693
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
that's cool. Do I feel like buying one

694
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
right now? No. I don't feel like buying one.

695
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
But I like that my Wii U is off.

696
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
You know what I mean? And if I wanted

697
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
to cover the little camera on the

698
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
little device, or I can just

699
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
flip it to the wall or whatever, and it still works

700
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
just fine. You know? No worries. Right?

701
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
So

702
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
here's my thing is that I think

703
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Microsoft needs to clarify some of this.

704
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
And I think they will, but

705
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
in a way, if it's just left at what

706
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Phil Harrison is saying, he's basically

707
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
saying, what? Don't you trust us?

708
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
We're a leader in privacy information.

709
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Don't you trust us? What are you talking about? No one got hacked

710
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
before. Money wasn't stolen.

711
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Fact, guys. Fact.

712
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
You want me to trust a company that

713
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
fact sold a bunch of

714
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
broken Xboxes that would break after

715
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
several days of

716
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
use. My Xbox

717
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
360 Red Ring two days after I bought

718
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
it. That is a fact. Fact.

719
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I had money stolen from my Xbox

720
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Live account by a hacker, and to this day,

721
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Microsoft will not acknowledge that there was

722
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
a breach, and instead they deflect

723
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
blame on the user. That is a fact.

724
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
And you want me to trust you?

725
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
You need to be a little

726
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
bit more transparent with what's

727
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
going on. That's the reality.

728
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
And if I want to turn that fucker off,

729
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
then I should be able to turn it off.

730
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Period. It should not require

731
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
that thing to be on for any reason.

732
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Here's my other question.

733
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
What if I just unplug

734
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
the fucking thing so it doesn't have a power

735
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
source? What if I just unplug

736
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
it when I don't want to use it?

737
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Is that going to cause it to malfunction?

738
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Because I could just put it on a switch

739
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
and have a little on-off switch.

740
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
No, you don't even have to do that.

741
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
It's just like the PlayStation 3

742
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
where there's a power

743
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
switch on the back of the console, and you

744
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
can flip it off.

745
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
But they're just saying, though, if you're going to leave

746
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
it in standby mode or whatever, that the

747
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
microphone's going to be always listening to you so that

748
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
you can say, on, and it

749
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
will turn the Xbox on. You know what? I read

750
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
1984.

751
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Hey, did we leave the Xbox

752
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
on? Ah, fuck. It's turned on

753
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
again.

754
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Rama in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

755
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
says, say what you will about Microsoft,

756
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
but they handled the security breach a hell of a lot

757
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
better than Sony.

758
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Yes and no.

759
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Sony at least admitted there was a problem.

760
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I didn't actually have any money

761
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
stolen from my Sony and

762
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
that whole thing. Nobody hacked into that or stole

763
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
anything. And Sony did

764
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
have to give a lot away

765
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
with that and the whole, you know, free games

766
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
and everything. I'm not saying that makes

767
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
it right. What happened with Sony was

768
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
not cool and was something

769
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
they needed to have their feet to the fire held to.

770
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
But I kind of feel like

771
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
that was done and they paid for that

772
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
in the court of public opinion. I'm not

773
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
so sure Microsoft ever had to pay for that.

774
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
But they're gonna pay for this in the court of public opinion.

775
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
And you're starting to see it in, you know,

776
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
what Germany is. I mean, this is much

777
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
bigger news than you guys think. Germany

778
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
is freaking crazy when it comes to privacy laws.

779
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Which I don't think anybody

780
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
here is gonna really have a problem with, right? Germany

781
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
is a leader in some regards in that,

782
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
when it comes to the privacy. So,

783
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
you know, if it's gonna come to the point where

784
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
like, yo, the Xbox will not be sold in Germany

785
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
unless they allow you to turn it off.

786
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
That's gonna cause a policy change.

787
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
It's gonna have to.

788
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I think it's stupid anyways to have, cause

789
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
let's just, I understand that the interface

790
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
stuff uses the Kinect.

791
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Whoopdy shit. Do I really wanna, do I need

792
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
to use that? I mean, is that really

793
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
something that I need to use? I mean,

794
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
why even bother with it?

795
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Just have it where you can unplug it and

796
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
if it's a game that requires Kinect,

797
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
and I mean, requires it, not like

798
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
shouting grenade

799
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
or some bullshit like that. But if it requires

800
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Kinect, then have it plug in. That way

801
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
they can still program the games, cause they know

802
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
that there's gonna be a Kinect there, you just

803
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
plug it in. But, you know, the whole thing

804
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
is, if it's not gonna work with the

805
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Kinect, what if the Kinect, you know, what if

806
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
a cat knocks the Kinect

807
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
off your shelf and it breaks?

808
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Fuck, now you can't play your console because

809
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
your stupid Kinect that you weren't using anyways

810
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
for stuff is just,

811
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
it's broken. Alright, in the interest

812
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
of time, I'm gonna, go ahead,

813
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
final thought. Wasn't it also

814
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Germany that sorta had Nintendo by the balls

815
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
for legalities? Yes, it was the, uh,

816
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
the whole, did the whole zombie you

817
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
sell late at night thing, wasn't that a

818
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Germany rooted thing? Yeah. So, and

819
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
we saw how, you know, they had to work out

820
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
a deal to get that to go, so I think

821
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
that whatever comes out

822
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
of Germany, if it doesn't, if it doesn't

823
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
fly legally on the international

824
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
stage, they're gonna have to make changes.

825
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Alright, regardless, admittedly,

826
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
we are making a lot of

827
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
opinions here based on

828
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
cloudy information, so Microsoft,

829
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I look to you to clear up some of this cloudiness at

830
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
E3, and we will reformulate our opinions

831
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
at that time if need be, but this just

832
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
shows there are questions that have to be answered.

833
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Let's hope Microsoft answers them in a week.

834
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
We'll know, well, a week and a half, and a week and a

835
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
half, we'll know. Hopefully, this

836
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
will all be over, and it'll all be just a

837
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
dream. It'll be like that one

838
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
season of Dallas. Anyway, DarkSakura. Well,

839
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
speaking of international stage, the Xbox

840
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
One is going to be region locked.

841
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
So, everything that comes out

842
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
must match the region, and this

843
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
is something Microsoft told Digital Trends.

844
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
We've already

845
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
pretty much seen this anyway.

846
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
It's not a big surprise,

847
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
but they are going to

848
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
keep everything to country-specific

849
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
guidelines

850
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
before they're cleared to sail.

851
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I think before

852
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
they were saying that it was up to the developer

853
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
or the publisher

854
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
or whatever they wanted it to be region locked or not.

855
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
A lot of games for the Xbox,

856
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
they don't go advertising, but a lot of them

857
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
are region-free.

858
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
It's just that not everything

859
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
is, and a lot of them are not,

860
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
but it's kind of a mix,

861
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
whereas everything on the PlayStation 3 is

862
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
region-free.

863
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
So, I think if they leave it how it is,

864
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
then that's fine, but I'm not surprised.

865
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
If it is up to the studio,

866
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
that's one thing, but

867
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
the quote here says,

868
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
must match.

869
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
It's very...

870
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Here's where I'm at with this.

871
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I hear this, and I'm like,

872
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
yet again, it's something that's a little unclear,

873
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
and it's a little disappointing, but sadly,

874
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I can't go, Microsoft,

875
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I totally blame you for doing this, because

876
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
it's a real unfortunate trend.

877
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
The only thing we saw that really bucked the trend

878
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
recently was the PlayStation 3.

879
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
The original DS was region-free?

880
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Yes.

881
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
All the handheld systems up to the 3DS were region-free,

882
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
and then the PS3 was

883
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
region-free as well.

884
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
So, I can't fault Microsoft alone for this,

885
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
but it is worth saying, and we've said it many times

886
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
on this show, being that this show started

887
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
out of a very Japanese-centric video game,

888
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
a bunch of games,

889
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
including BeatMania,

890
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
and Dance Dance Revolution,

891
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
and all that.

892
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I think there's going to come a time when companies

893
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
need to realize,

894
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
gaming companies tear down

895
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
this wall!

896
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Why do we keep separating?

897
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
We are a global community.

898
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I mean, yeah, we're becoming more and more

899
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
an economy. There's a lot of people here who would like

900
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
to play some of the shit that's out in Japan.

901
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
There's a lot of people in Europe that would like to play some of the stuff

902
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
that comes out here. It's like, when are we going to get

903
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
a global console? Why does everything

904
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
still have to be separated?

905
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I know you're all sitting there

906
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
answering the question for me, that

907
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
it has to do with licensing, especially when you get into

908
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
those music-based games. A lot of it is licensed by

909
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
region. But I'm just saying,

910
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
the internet has got to force

911
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
some of our ways of thinking in this,

912
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
to modernize. And we need to globalize

913
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
some of this stuff a little more and make more

914
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
games region-free, because

915
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I'm going to be open and honest.

916
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Region locks on the PlayStation 1

917
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
is what drove me to piracy.

918
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
I don't think there's really a whole ton of

919
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
region locking on

920
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
IOS games or anything like that.

921
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I mean, let's be honest

922
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
here. There's not all these IOS games

923
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
that have great

924
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
soundtracks and high development

925
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
costs, that type of thing. But there are a few.

926
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
And I know there are some music games

927
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
out there that

928
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
aren't region locked, so

929
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
why can they get away with it

930
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
when the consoles can't?

931
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Well, this is what I think.

932
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
If you leave everything completely

933
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
region-free, and then just

934
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
impose import taxes,

935
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
it's the same thing I've sort of suggested

936
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
being done for companies that outsource.

937
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Tax the crap out of them so that

938
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
they'd be more inclined to keep jobs

939
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
over here. But other than that,

940
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
if a company is going to have

941
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
say that everything's

942
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
region-free, will then

943
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
make it a little bit more expensive to import.

944
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Have an import, you know.

945
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Well, I always thought it was really cool that

946
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
there was a handful of games

947
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
on the 360 that were Japanese

948
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
where they didn't bother to translate them.

949
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Like Death Smiles? Yeah, they just put them up

950
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
on the marketplace like, if you want to pay 40 bucks for it,

951
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
here you go. Yay!

952
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
We bought that Death Smiles Special

953
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Edition, which was pretty much

954
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
the exact same. Yeah.

955
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I wish more game companies did

956
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
that stuff. Well, they just did that.

957
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
They had a new Dawn of Apache game that

958
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
came out, Slide.io.

959
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Well, I mean, if they are going to

960
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
region-lock the Xbox One or whatever,

961
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I hope we see more stuff like that. But I just think

962
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
region-locking is kind of a dated

963
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
thing.

964
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Anyway, more news.

965
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Yeah.

966
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
So, let's see. Let's talk

967
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
a little bit about Sony.

968
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I can get away from Microsoft here.

969
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Sony is going to be

970
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
forcing all publishers and developers

971
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
to have their titles that are going to be

972
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
on the PlayStation 4 compatible with remote play

973
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
on the Vita.

974
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I think that's kind of cool, actually.

975
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
More reasons than via Vita.

976
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
It's a smart

977
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
little jab at Nintendo

978
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
and the fact that a lot of the whole

979
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Wii U is the whole off-screen

980
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
play, Nintendo won't be able to

981
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
claim exclusivity

982
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
to that anymore.

983
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Although, granted, the Vita is a

984
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
separate device, it's probably going to cost you more

985
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
to do it via the PS4.

986
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
It's a

987
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
logical movement of the

988
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
chess piece, if you will.

989
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
But it's even better, though, than just off-screen

990
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
play with the Wii U because if you're in a

991
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Wi-Fi hotspot somewhere else,

992
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
and I'm assuming that this is all going to be streamed

993
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
through their Gaikai stuff now,

994
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
you're going to be able to play your games

995
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
away from home.

996
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Oh, interesting. I didn't even think of that.

997
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I was just assuming it would be very

998
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
and I didn't even think it would necessarily

999
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
be Wi-Fi, but that's very

1000
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
interesting.

1001
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I think it's just going to be wherever you are.

1002
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
That would be kind of cool.

1003
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
That would be really cool if it would work, but if you have an

1004
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
internet connection like what we have here trying to do the show,

1005
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
it might drop out.

1006
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
LOL game over.

1007
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
As a concept,

1008
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
back in the days of Neo Geo where you had the memory card

1009
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
where you could play on the arcade and then take it

1010
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
home if you had the system, wouldn't

1011
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
it sort of be almost the same thing?

1012
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Especially if you

1013
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
incorporated the share function?

1014
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Actually, Jamie, now that I think about it,

1015
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
the PS3 and the PSP,

1016
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
yes, PSP, do this today.

1017
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
We talked about this on the show, how this is a

1018
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
horribly underlooked feature

1019
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
of these consoles, but if I'm

1020
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
at a friend's house on their

1021
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Wi-Fi, if I have my PlayStation 3

1022
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
set to listen for it, I can power

1023
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
on my PlayStation 3 from my

1024
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
friend's house and over the Wi-Fi,

1025
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
navigate my PlayStation 3.

1026
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
All this technology is there right now.

1027
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
It's just that it's slow as shit

1028
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
and you can't play games through it.

1029
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
You can only do things like watch movies

1030
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
and even then they're going to be a little bit shotty.

1031
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Maybe music would work.

1032
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
But look at where the technology is going to be in two years.

1033
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Exactly. Now that Sony has Gaikai, what if

1034
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
PlayStation 4, and Loki, I think you hit the nail on the

1035
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
head, what if the PlayStation 4 is a

1036
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Gaikai box and they're leveraging that technology

1037
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
to oomph that up a lot?

1038
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
We're already looking

1039
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
into these

1040
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
massive

1041
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
advancements in

1042
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
communication regardless.

1043
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
They're already working on quantum communication.

1044
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
What's

1045
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
to say that in five, ten years

1046
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
this is going to be the norm?

1047
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
It's always harder to look ahead in a way

1048
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
because honestly, think back to when

1049
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
we were like nine and ten years old.

1050
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
We'll even go a little

1051
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
later. I know

1052
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
a lot of our listeners are younger, something that maybe a lot

1053
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
of you guys remember. So think to the time

1054
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
that was like 1990, 91 or so

1055
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
when the Super Nintendo was big.

1056
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
And the Super Nintendo was first coming out.

1057
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
When you first saw that Mode 7 for the first time

1058
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
it's like, oh my

1059
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
god, I'm really flying.

1060
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
This shit is real.

1061
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Or Star Fox.

1062
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Right? Stunt Race.

1063
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
That shit was amazing and we were like

1064
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
this is real on my TV.

1065
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
This is the future.

1066
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
And who would have thought

1067
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
anything like Bluray

1068
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
would exist 25 years

1069
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
from then, which is where we are now.

1070
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
And that it would be replacing, you know,

1071
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
all of us back in the day who said laserdisc

1072
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
was the future, we were right.

1073
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
All of that came from laserdisc

1074
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
technology. In a way.

1075
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Yeah, but digital encoding.

1076
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Who knew that we would be replacing all of

1077
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
our TVs? Who knew we wouldn't have to change

1078
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
sides? Who knew

1079
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
who knew that the government

1080
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
would come in and say

1081
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
everybody must switch from analog to

1082
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
digital. Like, we are going to switch as a country

1083
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
from analog to digital signals for TV.

1084
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Like, that's just, you know, you don't know.

1085
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Who knows where we're going to be in 25 years?

1086
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Who knew? It's exciting and scary.

1087
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Back when I was playing kangaroo

1088
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
on the Atari 2600

1089
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
that I would be playing Mass Effect today.

1090
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Who knew

1091
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
three years ago on this show

1092
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
when you were like, I don't want to play that game.

1093
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
It's like a stupid shoot about, I don't want to play

1094
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
that. More like

1095
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
dumb effect. I don't want to

1096
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
romance the blue chick.

1097
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Which I did once just so I could dump her.

1098
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Which is hilarious.

1099
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Just saying.

1100
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Alright. Anyhow.

1101
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Well, in about 25

1102
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
years, that might be the time when you can

1103
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
actually play Blizzard's next MMO.

1104
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
They've been working on a new game

1105
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
that's called Titan, but that's a

1106
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
code name. That is not the final name of the game.

1107
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
That's just the code name internally. But it

1108
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
came out this week from a site named VentureBeat

1109
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
that there had been some big changes

1110
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
with Titan. Blizzard internally

1111
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
has postponed this game. There were

1112
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
100 people working on the project, but this has

1113
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
been reduced to 30. The other

1114
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
folks had been put to work on other games.

1115
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Titan never had a release

1116
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
date. It was never really confirmed by Blizzard.

1117
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
But again, rumor and

1118
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
all this, you know, speak is

1119
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
saying that now the game will not be ready

1120
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
until 2016. Well now,

1121
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
usually I would just say whatever

1122
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
it's a rumor, you know, I

1123
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
don't know what to think about this. But

1124
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
the network Xam, which

1125
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
runs some popular World of Warcraft

1126
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
sites like Wowhead, if you've played Wow, you probably

1127
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
know that site, wowhead.com. Oh, Wowhead.

1128
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
They reached out to Blizzard

1129
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
and Blizzard actually said,

1130
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
quote, we've always had a

1131
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
highly iterative development process and the

1132
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
unannounced MMO is no exception.

1133
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
We've come to a point where we need to make some large

1134
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
design and technology changes to the game.

1135
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
We're using this opportunity to shift some of

1136
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
our resources to assist with other projects, while

1137
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
the core team adapts our technology

1138
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
and tools to accommodate these new

1139
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
changes. Note that we haven't announced any

1140
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
dates for the MMO.

1141
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
They kind of confirmed it

1142
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
by saying that, which is really weird.

1143
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Like, you just would not expect Blizzard to

1144
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
be that transparent, but they said

1145
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
that. So,

1146
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
but if you kind of look at what they're saying,

1147
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
they're holding the game back to make technology

1148
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
changes. That says to me, this thing

1149
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
has been in development so long that

1150
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
now it's looking old. It's been in

1151
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
development Duke Nukem forever long.

1152
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
In a way. I mean, I don't think it's been in

1153
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
development Diablo 3 long, but it's getting

1154
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
there. This thing's been in development for quite

1155
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
a while. Now, granted, I

1156
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
for one can't get upset about a game I

1157
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
know literally nothing about. I mean,

1158
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
it's exciting to know that Blizzard is working on

1159
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
some secret unannounced project,

1160
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
but I'm very happy to hear that nobody was laid

1161
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
off. And if they shifted these

1162
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
people to other resources, that just means

1163
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
their other shit will get done faster, like

1164
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Hearthstone, the next WoW expansion might be

1165
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
that much better for it. Maybe this

1166
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Blizzard Dota clone

1167
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
that's All-Stars Blizzard characters,

1168
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
maybe that will be that much better and will

1169
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
actually come out sometime soon. Maybe we'll see that at

1170
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
BlizzCon. Who knows? But,

1171
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
so I can't say I'm going to get upset about this news,

1172
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
especially hearing that they're going to shift the resources elsewhere,

1173
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
but, you know,

1174
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
it's a little bit, you kind of want to go,

1175
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I wish I could see what Blizzard's going to do that's like,

1176
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
that's not Warcraft.

1177
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
And granted, this could be World of Warcraft 2.

1178
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
It could be.

1179
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Oh no, it took

1180
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Ragnarok Online long enough to get to a sequel.

1181
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I sort of think, I don't know, Tinfoil Hat

1182
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
maybe, but I sort of think that the

1183
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
next WoW expansion is going to finally

1184
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
give that big graphical upgrade that's

1185
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
going to modernize it, and they're not going to need

1186
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
a World of Warcraft 2. Like, I just,

1187
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I just don't see Blizzard trying to make that happen

1188
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
because it doesn't always happen so well for other

1189
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
MMOs. But, then again,

1190
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Guild Wars and Guild Wars 2, coexisting

1191
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
fine. Final Fantasy 11,

1192
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Final Fantasy XIV Reborn,

1193
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
too soon to tell, but

1194
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
looks promising.

1195
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Final Fantasy XIV, sorry,

1196
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
pretty. Yeah, no, I know.

1197
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Cannot wait. Well, that's the importance of technology.

1198
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
So, alright, anyhow,

1199
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
one more story and then release dates. Dark Sakura.

1200
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Well, in other news,

1201
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
and, god, what a disgusting ad

1202
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
on this page.

1203
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Um, there,

1204
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
okay, who remembers the rumor,

1205
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
the big urban legend, about

1206
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
a bajillion Atari

1207
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
2600 ET cartridges

1208
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
being buried.

1209
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I've definitely heard that, but they were melted

1210
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
down before they were buried.

1211
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
That's what I heard, and I think that's important to know.

1212
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Well, um, there is an

1213
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Ontario-based production company

1214
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
called Fuel that

1215
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
has signed a deal with

1216
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
the, uh, basically,

1217
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
it's a town in New Mexico,

1218
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I'm gonna ruin this, Alamogordo?

1219
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Alamogordo. Alamogordo, thank you.

1220
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Where the landfill

1221
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
that supposedly, not just

1222
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
E3 cartridges, but a ton of

1223
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Atari prototypes, prototype games,

1224
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
prototype systems, anything that

1225
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
was in development that they ended up not releasing

1226
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
going into this dump. And the city

1227
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
has given this production

1228
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
company permission

1229
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
to go digging through the dump.

1230
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
They're going huge dumpster diving

1231
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
in a landfill. This is digging

1232
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
up a dead body

1233
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
to see what the real cause of death was.

1234
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
This is what this is.

1235
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
To do a DNA test.

1236
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
To give history to the urban legend,

1237
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
they basically believed, and it wasn't melted down,

1238
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
that they were crushed.

1239
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
And loaded into, um,

1240
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
semis and then buried.

1241
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Um,

1242
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
but the, uh,

1243
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
basically the mayor of there is saying

1244
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
that they, uh, want people to find out

1245
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
about the town because of the

1246
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
landfill.

1247
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
They're hoping it's good PR for the town.

1248
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
So now it's a tourist thing. We have a bunch of shit games

1249
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
in the dumpster back here.

1250
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Although, you know what, if they're prototypes

1251
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
and stuff too though, that's the real gold mine.

1252
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Well, and you know that, um,

1253
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
there are people who have, I'm saying,

1254
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
escaped with prototypes

1255
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
just in jest.

1256
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
But you find a lot of 5200

1257
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
prototypes, um,

1258
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
online for sale. Where people have

1259
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
gotten legit ROM dumps

1260
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
and reconstituted

1261
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
them for sale.

1262
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Our copy of Millipede for 5200

1263
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
was, um, a, uh,

1264
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
prototype.

1265
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
But they crushed these, I mean, I had always heard they melted them down

1266
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
but crushed makes a lot more sense.

1267
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
You put them in the trash compactor and they crush down. They did that so that

1268
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
looters wouldn't dig them up and try to sell them.

1269
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
So, I mean, but then,

1270
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
what's the point? You're gonna dig up

1271
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
literally garbage that doesn't work.

1272
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
It's 25 years old. Those things,

1273
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
if a board is sitting outside a case that long

1274
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
it's not gonna work. But if a memory chip

1275
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
happens to have been compressed within

1276
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Good luck. I know, but

1277
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
but the whole thing is that

1278
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
the

1279
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
there's a chance that it exists.

1280
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
And people who

1281
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
especially big

1282
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
video game history buffs, Atari

1283
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
fans, they're gonna drop

1284
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
you know, the opportunity

1285
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
to take, to see if there is

1286
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
anything salvageable. Uh, Dungeon

1287
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Buster in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

1288
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
ET sucks. Dungeon Buster in the chatroom

1289
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
at live.vognetwork.com says, I hope

1290
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
that doesn't turn into another Capone's vault.

1291
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Will Geraldo Rivera be there when they

1292
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
unearth the big massive ET cartridges?

1293
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Will he be there, live?

1294
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Does he have a career still?

1295
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
No? So yes,

1296
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
he will be.

1297
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
He didn't, didn't the angry

1298
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
video game nerd, like that was like the

1299
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
basis of his movie was going to the dump to find

1300
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
if the game exists. I

1301
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
don't even know. I never saw it.

1302
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
All right. Well, if we're done with the Atari story, I want

1303
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
to go back real quick to the Titan thing because Technus

1304
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com made a very

1305
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
good point about this. I want to throw this out there.

1306
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Technus says, I would speculate that

1307
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Bungie beat them to the punch with

1308
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Destiny and they needed to reset

1309
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
after Activision picked up Bungie.

1310
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
That's a really good theory

1311
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
because again, rumors and

1312
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
whisperings and you know, who knows

1313
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
how much we can lend to this, but I did

1314
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
hear that Titan was quite a bit like what

1315
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Destiny sounds like it's going to be. That

1316
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
it was less of a shooter per se,

1317
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
but that a lot of the same stuff they're talking

1318
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
about implementing with

1319
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Destiny was supposed to be the types of stuff they

1320
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
were doing with Titan too. You know,

1321
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
take with a gigantic grain of salt.

1322
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Take with an entire can of salt actually.

1323
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Take with all the salt in the ocean. Salt lick.

1324
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Salt lick.

1325
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
There you go. I have to

1326
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
quote Queen Semia in chat. They find Hafa

1327
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
under the pile. Plot twist.

1328
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Masked Bishop with some strong

1329
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
opinions on Realm Reborn.

1330
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
By the way, Final Fantasy XIV Realm

1331
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Reborn will succeed. If you think

1332
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Square Enix will let the Final Fantasy franchise

1333
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
fail, you're sadly mistaken.

1334
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Final Fantasy XIV Realm

1335
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Reborn will be the next game changer.

1336
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
I'll say this much, it's

1337
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
impressive that they, I mean,

1338
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
the second half of what he said at least

1339
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
is true because Square

1340
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Enix put a lot of money to

1341
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
basically redo the fucking game

1342
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
from scratch. And you can see it.

1343
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
You can really tell.

1344
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
It's going to be interesting. Free to play

1345
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Final Fantasy XI. Come on.

1346
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Wouldn't that be something?

1347
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
We'll see. Alright, let's check out

1348
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
some games that will be coming out a little bit

1349
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
sooner than Final Fantasy XV

1350
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
or whatever else

1351
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
we're thinking about here. Release dates.

1352
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Alright, so this week we've got PlayStation 3

1353
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
or on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Remember

1354
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
me? Coming out from Capcom.

1355
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Receiving kind of mixed reviews, but

1356
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
whatever. Animal

1357
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Crossing on the 3DS or

1358
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Animal Crossing New Leaf

1359
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
on the 3DS because there's

1360
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
one single new leaf

1361
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
in the game and the rest is all the same as the last

1362
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
one.

1363
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
The Skyrim,

1364
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Elder Scrolls V Skyrim Legendary Edition

1365
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
kind of re-released the game with the

1366
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
DLC on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360

1367
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
and PC.

1368
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
And at long

1369
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
last, if you don't have the

1370
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
internet and you

1371
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
want to play Minecraft, Minecraft

1372
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
on the Xbox 360, the Xbox

1373
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
360 version is coming out as a

1374
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
disc version. That might be a

1375
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
good one for the Xbox 360 in the kid's

1376
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
room that's not hooked up to the internet.

1377
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
I could see that being a plus because Minecraft

1378
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
is a pretty friendly kid's game. It is an awesome

1379
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
game. So,

1380
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
there's that. And that's

1381
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
pretty much it this week.

1382
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Alright, coming out

1383
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
in Japan on the PlayStation 3

1384
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Galgun gets a price reduction into the

1385
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
best series. Haha, yeah. And there's

1386
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
another game called

1387
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Narawatera Gakuen

1388
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Gekijoban Anime

1389
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
and Complete Setting Book Hybrid

1390
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Disc. So I think this is actually the

1391
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
anime and like a game

1392
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
based on the anime all on one disc.

1393
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
That is my, because you see this happening more

1394
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
and more in Japan where you get

1395
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
like the bundled Blu-ray that

1396
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
has a game and a movie or at least, you know

1397
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
two separate Blu-rays or whatever

1398
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
in a bundle collection. On the

1399
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Xbox 360, Halo Origin Pack

1400
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
this week in Japan for all

1401
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
you Halo fans in Origin. Also, Minecraft

1402
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Xbox 360 edition, the standalone game

1403
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
is out in Japan as well. And a new

1404
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
camouflage 360 wireless controller

1405
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
in Japan. I guess this is to go with the Halo

1406
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Origin Pack. Which by the way

1407
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
quickly while it's on my mind

1408
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
do you think Microsoft at E3

1409
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
is going to have anything to kind of throw something

1410
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
at Japan to try and make it

1411
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
work there? I don't think they're going to try.

1412
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Really? Yeah. I thought I read somewhere that

1413
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
they did say they are committed to Japan but

1414
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
that could have just been smoke up my ass. I don't know. I think it's smoke

1415
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
up their ass. They'll release a game with

1416
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
a pillow and a clock. It's just

1417
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
I think the market's so small there

1418
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
now. It's just, I don't know

1419
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
they're just more focused on the larger market.

1420
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Microsoft's market is small but

1421
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
certainly there's, handhelds

1422
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
is really what it seems to be about.

1423
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Nothing of note on the

1424
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
PlayStation Vita this week.

1425
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Looking at, oh I already did

1426
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Xbox 360. Way to go.

1427
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Seeing if there's anything on the Wii U. Actually yes,

1428
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Rabbids Land is supposed to be out in Japan this week.

1429
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
The game that got delayed here

1430
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
supposedly coming out in Japan.

1431
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
No, Rabbids Land was a launch title

1432
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
for the Wii U. Oh, I'm thinking of the

1433
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
other Rabbids game. Yeah, you're thinking of Rayman

1434
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Legends. My bad. My bad.

1435
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Let's see, on the

1436
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
3DS in Japan this week

1437
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
nothing of note.

1438
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
On the PSP this week

1439
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
God Eater Burst gets a price

1440
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
reduction. So lots of price

1441
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
reductions this week but really not a lot of new games

1442
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
until we get to about June 20th.

1443
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Seems to be when the next batch of big games comes out.

1444
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Really

1445
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
nothing to say on Nintendo 3DS either.

1446
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Japan gets Donkey Kong Returns 3D

1447
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
next week on the 13th

1448
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
and a metallic red DS to go with that.

1449
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
I did pick up Donkey Kong Country Returns by the way

1450
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
for my DS. Haven't really played enough of it yet

1451
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
to review it though. On my plane

1452
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
ride this week I plan to play some more of it so

1453
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
I'll let you know. Did I tell you we might finally

1454
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
be getting 3DSes? Oh no,

1455
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
that's great. Because there's gonna be

1456
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
like a new massive

1457
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
uh

1458
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
I know Apollo Justice is in it.

1459
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
I'm trying to remember. Oh, Phoenix Wright.

1460
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Phoenix Wright, thank you.

1461
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
A new game coming out and Fire Emblem

1462
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
and then I want

1463
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Animal Crossing.

1464
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Alright, how about the UK? What's coming out over there?

1465
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Some stuff. On the 3rd we have

1466
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Gunpoint for PC

1467
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
and Scrolls for PC and Mac

1468
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
and on 7th we have Remember Me

1469
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
PC, Xbox 360, PS3 and that would be it.

1470
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
To register participation for this week's

1471
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
episode of Orange Lounge Radio at

1472
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
vognetwork.com, use the passphrase

1473
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
OVEN.

1474
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Just a couple more stories for you guys than the classic

1475
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
game of the week, but first, Loki.

1476
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Um, so this is kind of

1477
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
I guess

1478
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
the best news that could come out of the situation

1479
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
because we know that this is only alluding to

1480
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
worse things to come

1481
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
on the next gen consoles

1482
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
but EA is eliminating, they

1483
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
already went ahead and said that they're not gonna have

1484
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
the online pass in any future games

1485
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
and now they're going back and retroactively

1486
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
taking away the online pass

1487
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
from all the old games as well

1488
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
so the online pass now is free

1489
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
so if you wanna, you know

1490
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
play a used EA game

1491
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
that had the online pass, you buy the game

1492
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
and then you activate

1493
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
the online pass for free. So that's

1494
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
nice.

1495
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
There's just something about this.

1496
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
As we just continue

1497
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
online pass for our new EA titles

1498
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
we're also in the process of eliminating it from our

1499
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
existing EA titles. We heard the feedback

1500
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
from players and decided to do away with

1501
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
the online pass altogether.

1502
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Yeah.

1503
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
I don't trust them. I totally

1504
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
believe that you, oh what we're doing

1505
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
is wrong. You know what?

1506
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
I don't know what it is. I don't know what it is

1507
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
and maybe I am just being

1508
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
a jerk, but it's like one of those things where it's like

1509
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
are you sure that when you download the free

1510
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
thing it doesn't say, uh, but you

1511
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
are giving us your soul? Like are you sure there's

1512
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
nothing in there like that? I just

1513
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
worry. I'm sorry but

1514
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
I know better.

1515
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
It's just, it's

1516
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
so much bullshit. I just don't

1517
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
believe any of that crap.

1518
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
I roll my eyes.

1519
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
We've made too much money

1520
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
America and the world and

1521
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
we're just gonna stop making

1522
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
extra money now because we have all the money that

1523
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
we need to run those servers now so we don't need

1524
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
any of your online passes anymore because

1525
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
servers all of a sudden got cheaper to run.

1526
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
No, I'm sorry. That's

1527
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
this is a company that makes

1528
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
money. They're not gonna say, hey, we

1529
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
hate money all of a sudden. Right?

1530
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
No. There's just something I don't

1531
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
trust.

1532
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Call me a conspiracy

1533
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
there. Or maybe, you know, if

1534
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
I take this as an actual

1535
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
legit sign, maybe it's them trying to get away from the

1536
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
business tactics of the former CEO.

1537
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Now you're being

1538
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
nice. I know. I've decided to

1539
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
play angels advocate.

1540
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Or it could be

1541
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
in-game purchases

1542
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
in Dead Space 3

1543
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
in future games.

1544
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
But if

1545
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
I want to put it at a non-conspiracy

1546
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
theory point of view, even though

1547
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I trust EA as far as

1548
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
I can pick up the entire building and

1549
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
nudge it,

1550
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
maybe

1551
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
it is trying to separate themselves from former business

1552
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
practice. Or it's trying to get people to

1553
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
install Origin, which I will not fucking

1554
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
do.

1555
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Tigerclaw with a theory in chat at

1556
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
live.vognetware.com says, EA removes

1557
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
the online pass

1558
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
so people can play the used

1559
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
games online. And then a few months later,

1560
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
EA shuts down the online servers to those games.

1561
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Actually,

1562
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
that is kind of funny. But here's the thing

1563
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
with some of these games. They're

1564
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
not online games.

1565
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
That was the thing that was

1566
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
kind of the funny part about the online pass. Remember

1567
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
like, Dragon Age Origins,

1568
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Dragon Age 2.

1569
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Mass Effect 2 had that Cerberus pass, and it wasn't

1570
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
really, you didn't play online.

1571
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
It was DLC.

1572
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
My hope is that with all of this

1573
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
that it means I won't have to fucking be online

1574
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
for my DLC in Mass Effect 3 to load.

1575
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Because I paid for a lot of it.

1576
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Okay, I'm a

1577
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
consumer whore, I don't care.

1578
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
And how.

1579
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Yeah, mister, I'm gonna

1580
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
buy Mass Effect 3 trilogy and

1581
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
run it on Xbox and PC.

1582
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
You know what, you're worse than me, okay?

1583
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Okay, well,

1584
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
maybe I play more than you do.

1585
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
I play other games too, though.

1586
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
You're seriously like my dealer, you and

1587
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Shane. I blame you

1588
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
for everything that happens in my life.

1589
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Shane is worse. And I haven't started on

1590
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Persona, so.

1591
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Don't resist. I will resist.

1592
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
My will is strong.

1593
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
My will is titanium. By the way, there's now

1594
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
music from Persona 4 in rotation at

1595
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
I just put some in today.

1596
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
You know what, I actually kind of

1597
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
I'm playing too much shit already.

1598
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Alright.

1599
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Going to one more story here.

1600
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
This actually came up last week, but

1601
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
it's too good for us to skip completely on our

1602
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
show. We've gotta mention it. Actually, maybe

1603
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
it, I don't, when did this finish? I think it

1604
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
finished like on Saturday or Sunday

1605
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
of last week. But anyhow, here's the

1606
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
deal. So, did you guys ever check out the

1607
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
iPhone and Android game? Curiosity!

1608
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
What's in the cube?

1609
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
It's Peter Molyneux's dick

1610
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
in a box. Remember this game where you

1611
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
tap the little cube? If this was last week, this

1612
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
was me not having much in the way of internet

1613
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
access, except for Tumblr.

1614
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Finally, what was in the box

1615
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
was revealed. Some dude opened

1616
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
the box. You win nothing!

1617
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
You're so stupid!

1618
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Well, here's what's

1619
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
amazing. The guy who won is an

1620
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
18 year old guy, Brian Henderson. He

1621
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
lives in Edinburgh. And he

1622
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
won. And the great thing about

1623
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
it, he ended up tweeting or saying in an

1624
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
interview, I don't remember where it was, but he said,

1625
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
yeah, I just downloaded the game an hour

1626
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
before I won it.

1627
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
So, what was in

1628
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
the goddamn cube? See, I would have

1629
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
played to the very end, too, if I had remembered

1630
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
that it was ending, but I was just like, eh, I don't fucking

1631
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
care. Here's, guess what was in the

1632
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
goddamn cube. I'm sure many of you have heard, but here's

1633
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
what was in the cube.

1634
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
You, again, now 22Cans

1635
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
is, they did Curiosity. Their next

1636
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
project is like a populous reimagining

1637
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
called Goddess. Well,

1638
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Brian will be

1639
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
the god in Goddess.

1640
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
At the

1641
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Stardust. No.

1642
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
But he will be, he will be in...

1643
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
You don't know shit.

1644
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
I can't believe this.

1645
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Some new kid from the

1646
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
street won this. You don't

1647
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
know shit.

1648
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
You are a whore, darlin'.

1649
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
A show where we can fall into

1650
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
showgirls' quotes is a good show.

1651
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
That game is called Goddess, and it just

1652
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
makes me think of showgirls. Sorry, Nomi Malone.

1653
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
That's right. Nomi Malone from

1654
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Edinburgh.

1655
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
I'm sorry to this kid. This poor kid didn't ask

1656
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
for this, so I'm very sorry.

1657
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
But I'm gonna make the joke anyway. I'm doing the hand

1658
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
flashies in my head.

1659
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Nomi Malone

1660
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
from Edinburgh opened the

1661
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
cube and will get to be the god

1662
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
in Goddess.

1663
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
And apparently,

1664
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
not only will he be the god, but he will

1665
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
have a hand in creating the rules that will

1666
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
govern the game. So it's

1667
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
his rules, or get out, and Brian

1668
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
gets to share in the revenue

1669
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
generated by Goddess. But they're saying

1670
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
in one year, he could be

1671
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
pushed down a flight of stairs

1672
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
and a new Goddess

1673
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
could emerge.

1674
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Here's the thing.

1675
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
When did this

1676
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
whole thing, this cube

1677
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
thing launched, like what, seven months

1678
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
ago, right? Didn't Goddess

1679
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
get kick-started midway through

1680
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
this project? Kick-started? Yeah, that's

1681
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
my new verb. Didn't it get kick-started?

1682
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Where would it be kick-started? Kick-started.

1683
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Cause the website is kick-starter.

1684
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Not kick-start. Alright.

1685
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Are you gonna kick-start my heart? No.

1686
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
So Goddess got

1687
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
kick-started halfway through

1688
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
the run of

1689
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
cube. What if it hadn't gone

1690
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
through? Then what would have been

1691
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
in the cube?

1692
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
I got you!

1693
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
You are making this shit

1694
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
up as you go along, Peter Molyneux.

1695
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
I got you!

1696
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Shrugner's box

1697
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
or whatever, it's basically...

1698
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
There's a dead cat who's not dead.

1699
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Yeah, so it's Goddess, but

1700
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
not Goddess. We won't

1701
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
know, because it was Goddess in the box

1702
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
and not Goddess dead

1703
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
having eaten the poison.

1704
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
You know what it would have been?

1705
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
It would have been a dog.

1706
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
He would have adopted a dog for you. It would have been

1707
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
life-changing.

1708
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
A dog. Or,

1709
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
guess what?

1710
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
I've got this

1711
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
boy named Milo, and you're going to

1712
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
adopt him.

1713
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Having kids is gonna

1714
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
change your life.

1715
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Milo will change your life.

1716
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Milo needs

1717
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
his diaper changed every five seconds

1718
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
and you'll want to die.

1719
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Alright, well we reached out to Peter Molyneux

1720
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
for comment on Goddess, and this is what

1721
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
he had to say.

1722
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Must be weird not having anybody come on you.

1723
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
What does that even mean?

1724
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
What does that

1725
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
even mean?

1726
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
That was a quote from

1727
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Showgirls, get it? Alright. I will give you the

1728
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
best Fable game ever made.

1729
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
It's Fable

1730
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Fable the Journey. It uses

1731
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Kinect. It's fantastic. It's not on

1732
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
rails. It's not on rails.

1733
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Oh, shit. Alright, let's go. Hey, I'll tell you what.

1734
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
You know what? I've been inside the box if

1735
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
perhaps Peter Molyneux wasn't backing this

1736
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
and it was the Steam Box.

1737
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Hats! Would have been fucking hats.

1738
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Lots of hats. Hats, hats, hats.

1739
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Let's travel.

1740
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Let's travel back. Do we have like a

1741
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
gif?

1742
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
I think

1743
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
it's funny that we both grunted at him

1744
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
at the same time.

1745
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
I don't care what he said.

1746
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
It is gif. I do not care.

1747
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
I disavow him. Anyway, wouldn't it be

1748
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
awesome if they had like an animated gif?

1749
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
They had like, you know, the Matrix thing

1750
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
where all these hats come in. We're gonna need hats.

1751
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Woof.

1752
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Okay, Rob, you sounded like

1753
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Grover slash Yoda.

1754
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Near

1755
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
far.

1756
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Let's travel back to a time.

1757
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
When gaming was

1758
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
so much simpler. When you know what

1759
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Elizabeth Berkley was Jessie Spano

1760
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
and you hadn't seen her boobies yet. It's a much

1761
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
simpler time. It's the classic game

1762
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
of the week. Dark

1763
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1764
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Sonic R.

1765
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Yes, it is Sonic R. I have finally

1766
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
decided to do fucking Sonic R.

1767
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
So.

1768
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Sonic R

1769
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
was done by Traveler's Tales

1770
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
and Sonic Team and it came

1771
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
out on the Sega Saturn

1772
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
and Windows.

1773
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
It was out for Windows, which actually,

1774
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
if you've got a decent graphics card, the Windows version

1775
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
actually looks a lot better and plays better.

1776
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
It came out in the US on October 31,

1777
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
1997 and then

1778
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
later it came out in

1779
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Europe, Australia, and Japan all at the same time

1780
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
and was re-released for PlayStation 2

1781
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
and the GameCube as part of

1782
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
the Sonic Gems collection.

1783
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
It is basically

1784
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
the last of the

1785
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
two, I'm sorry, the third Sonic

1786
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
racing game and the last of

1787
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
two games that was done by Traveler's Tales

1788
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
and Sonic Team. So basically, it's a huge

1789
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
foot race. That's what the game is.

1790
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
And it's single or

1791
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
multiplayer. You can race.

1792
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
You have ten different Sonic characters

1793
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
and

1794
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
you know, you can pick

1795
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
up like, you have to collect

1796
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
rings on the way to open up different parts of

1797
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
the race track. You also

1798
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
can get like

1799
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
different shields like what's

1800
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
in Sonic 3. Like you can actually get a lightning

1801
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
shield that attracts rings to you.

1802
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
And you

1803
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
have different areas

1804
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
that are sort of based off of

1805
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
various places

1806
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
in the different Sonic games. Like you have a place

1807
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
that looks like the Green Hill Zone and a place that looks like

1808
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
the Chemical Plant. You

1809
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
have those item panels like I was talking about

1810
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
that give you different abilities

1811
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
as you go. Like you can run on water

1812
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
or attract rings. And

1813
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
then you get Sonic Tokens and

1814
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Chaos Emeralds. And the Chaos Emeralds

1815
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
help you unlock secret characters.

1816
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
You also have different kinds of weather.

1817
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
You have clear, you have rain, you have snow.

1818
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
But the snow does

1819
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
make the water free so you can run over

1820
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
it instead of being slowed

1821
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
down by it. And

1822
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
you have a time attack mode to see basically

1823
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
who has the fastest time. So

1824
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
the characters in this one

1825
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
is you are, let's see,

1826
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
you have Sonic and he has double jump.

1827
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
He's also the fastest. Tails

1828
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
actually has the ability to fly. Knuckles

1829
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
can glide.

1830
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
And then you have Amy

1831
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Rose who actually drives a car. And she

1832
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
can hover over water and gets extra

1833
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
speed boost. For

1834
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
your secret characters you have

1835
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Robotnik, also known as Eggman.

1836
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
He has a hovercraft

1837
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
and can resist terrain. You have

1838
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Metal Sonic. You have

1839
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
a Tails doll and you have

1840
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Metal Knuckles. You have

1841
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Egg Robo and Super

1842
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Sonic. So basically when you have all the Chaos

1843
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Emeralds you can play as Super Sonic and you just

1844
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
sort of float over everything.

1845
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
The game actually

1846
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
came out after Sonic 3D Blast

1847
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
when Sega was working with Traveler's

1848
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Tails on a different Sonic game.

1849
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
And they had also

1850
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
been working on a 3D graphics

1851
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
engine that they didn't really have anything

1852
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
for so they decided to work with Sonic Team to make

1853
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
the game. Pretty much just

1854
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
everything that came together.

1855
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
So there's actually even

1856
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
a Sonic R that came out on the

1857
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Tiger handheld system.

1858
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Of course like I said

1859
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
there was the Sega Saturn version that actually

1860
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
had some really bad problems with draw distance

1861
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
and clipping.

1862
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
But the PC version

1863
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
let you use better rendering

1864
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
and 3D acceleration and you

1865
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
could adjust the draw distance. So basically like

1866
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
today you could have no draw distance

1867
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
at all in the game. It would be gorgeous.

1868
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
The music was done by Richard

1869
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Jacques of Sega Europe

1870
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
who also did the music

1871
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
for Sonic 3D Blast.

1872
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
And he

1873
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
basically worked with Yuji Naka

1874
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
to

1875
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
basically design the musical

1876
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
feel of the game.

1877
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
And that's where we got the Super Sonic Racing.

1878
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
And then the

1879
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
singer in this one, now this I didn't know, her name

1880
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
is TJ Davis and she did

1881
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
all of the singing in it at

1882
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Yuji Naka's request.

1883
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
So basically

1884
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
it was done by a London

1885
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
studio. The music came out of

1886
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
London.

1887
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
I think it's a fun game. It's sort of

1888
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
not like the world's best

1889
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Sonic game. But it's a really

1890
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
fun game. And from that we also

1891
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
got

1892
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
well there were two games that came out before

1893
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Sonic R. There was Sonic Drift and Sonic Drift 2

1894
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
for Game Gear. And then

1895
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
after that we've gotten Sonic Riders

1896
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
we've gotten Sonic Riders

1897
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Zero Gravity, Sonic Free Riders,

1898
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing,

1899
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
and the Transformed version as well.

1900
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Those are all pretty much born out of the Sonic R

1901
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
franchise. And

1902
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
of course the music is

1903
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
you know, pretty much the big

1904
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
iconic thing about it. It's not the most

1905
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
gorgeous game. But it's super fun.

1906
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Like we said

1907
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
we say a system is only as good as the games

1908
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
that are on it. But the games are also

1909
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
can be

1910
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
absolutely amazing without

1911
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
having to look, you know, absolutely gorgeous.

1912
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
You know what I mean? And this is one of

1913
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
those that falls into that

1914
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
category. So my game

1915
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
of the week is Sonic R.

1916
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
This is one of those games that to me just made

1917
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
sense. Like Sonic in a racing game.

1918
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Why did it take so long?

1919
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Kinda right.

1920
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
And it did have some good music.

1921
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Super Sonic Racing was in Sonic R,

1922
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Tiger Hall.

1923
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Alright. There it is, your classic game of the week

1924
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Sonic R.

1925
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Good pick.

1926
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Have you done every single Sonic game yet? You gotta be getting close.

1927
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
I've done a few of them.

1928
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
But keep in mind there's a bunch of crap out there

1929
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
in the Sonic franchise.

1930
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
I would get

1931
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Sonic herpes or something.

1932
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Alright. We're gonna take a break and when we

1933
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
come back there is still more news to come in the

1934
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Fugu question of the week. Oh and to tell what up G?

1935
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Same music in Japan.

1936
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
All out of the London studio. So there's none of this

1937
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
whole one soundtrack? No there's not.

1938
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Just making sure. Good. At least we can all agree on something.

1939
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Okay. Plenty more

1940
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
to come when Orange Lounge Radio returns

1941
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
with this episode number 506

1942
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Second Mix J Append Part B

1943
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
right after this.

1944
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Hola.

1945
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
This is your friendly neighborhood Mexican

1946
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Acta. And you're participating with

1947
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Orange Lounge Radio. The show where

1948
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
every gamer has a voice.

1949
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
And I want to use my voice to tell you that

1950
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Kirby does not suck.

1951
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Well, literally he does suck.

1952
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
But not fear of the blue.

1953
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Anyways, play more Kirby.

1954
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
I'll see you in the next video.

1955
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Bye.

1956
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
That's right. Play more Kirby.

1957
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
They have that whole Wii U virtual console thing going on

1958
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
right now. I was tempted to get the

1959
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Kirby golf

1960
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
was it Kirby's Dream Course that they had at Super

1961
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Nintendo? It was like the miniature golf game.

1962
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,000
I think it was awesome.

1963
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Good times. There you go.

1964
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
You too can leave a bumper.

1965
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Go to vognetwork.com and check out the

1966
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
forums for Orange Lounge Radio and more information

1967
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
on there if you want to use your voice

1968
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
to tell the gaming world something. Maybe

1969
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
you want them to play less Kirby.

1970
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
You can tell us that in a future bumper.

1971
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
That was the last one that I had in the queue by the way.

1972
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
So you're going to start hearing repeats if I don't

1973
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
get any new ones for the next show. Just saying.

1974
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
That's my little threat. Just saying.

1975
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Alright.

1976
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
During the break tonight, before we get into rapid fire

1977
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
news, I noticed some of the chatters were talking about

1978
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Civ 5. And I don't know how this got brought up

1979
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
but apparently the Mass Effect mods

1980
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
for Civ 5. I thought

1981
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
I mentioned this on the show before. Yes, they exist

1982
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
and they're awesome.

1983
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Fun fact.

1984
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
You once said that about Mass

1985
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Effects.

1986
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Here's something.

1987
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
I have never

1988
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
liked that type of game.

1989
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
I didn't even...

1990
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
I admit that...

1991
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
What game is it I'm thinking of now?

1992
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Not Populous.

1993
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Well, I didn't like Populous either.

1994
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
SimCity?

1995
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Are we? Uh oh.

1996
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
I thought I hit all the buttons.

1997
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
I just happened to look over and saw that we were

1998
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
muted so all of this conversation that's

1999
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
happening...

2000
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Professional radio folks.

2001
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
You know what?

2002
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Rob was giving me crap for not

2003
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
wanting to play Civ even though there's

2004
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
a Mass Effect mod. And I

2005
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
was telling him how I did not like

2006
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
Civ. I don't

2007
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
like SimCity.

2008
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
I do not like SimCoaster.

2009
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Although I do like watching the coasters

2010
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
that people have made on SimCoaster.

2011
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
I don't like SimPark.

2012
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
I like the Sims, but really I like building

2013
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
houses and dressing them up.

2014
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
And murdering them. What about SimAnt?

2015
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
I don't like SimAnt either.

2016
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
I loved SimAnt. That game was amazing.

2017
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
I do like semantics.

2018
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Ha ha ha.

2019
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
But what's the game I'm thinking of? It's not Populous.

2020
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
It's where you're the avatar

2021
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
of the god and you go and you

2022
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
fight demons and you build the town

2023
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
and make them worship you and shit.

2024
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Actraiser? Thank you, Actraiser. I don't even

2025
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
really care for Actraiser that much.

2026
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Get out. Let me finish.

2027
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
I like watching other people play

2028
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Actraiser. I get pissed

2029
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
off. So I

2030
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
don't have the patience for Actraiser.

2031
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Two things about Actraiser. A. The soundtrack.

2032
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Is great. B.

2033
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
When that angel flies around you can see his butt.

2034
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
It was butt.

2035
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
And this is how Rob first learned. No.

2036
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
It was butt on the Super Nintendo.

2037
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
So it made you giggle a little bit. You know butt.

2038
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
It was butt.

2039
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
You know what? Butt.

2040
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Ha ha ha. That's what.

2041
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
No. From now on it's said chicken but it's angel butt.

2042
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Guess what? Angel butt.

2043
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Alright. Let's go around

2044
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
and talk about rapidly what's

2045
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
happening in the world of gaming. Some quick stories.

2046
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Rapid fire news.

2047
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
This may be a bit of a spoiler but

2048
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
we think

2049
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
maybe Mirrors Edge 2 might be coming to the

2050
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Xbox One. Apparently there was

2051
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
first off a listing on

2052
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
an Italian. The German and

2053
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Italian storefronts for Amazon.

2054
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
And those are removed.

2055
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Listing it was for the Xbox One.

2056
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
And then

2057
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
on EA's own website

2058
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
in the help

2059
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
section. Their help center.

2060
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Had a page for Mirrors Edge 2 and now

2061
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
it's gone. So

2062
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
makes me think that maybe

2063
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
that's going to be one of the announcements.

2064
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Perhaps.

2065
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
I guess we'll find out. Yes please.

2066
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
And then

2067
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
of course Prey 2

2068
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
has been in development forever.

2069
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
And now apparently

2070
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
it's going to be under development by

2071
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Arkane Austin which was

2072
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
the studio behind Dishonored.

2073
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
So that sounds good because Dishonored wasn't that bad.

2074
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
And yeah

2075
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
they don't have any. They have no

2076
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
information to share but

2077
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
that's the rumor at least.

2078
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
That hasn't been cancelled.

2079
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
And last but not least

2080
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
um

2081
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
El Shaddai. I don't know if

2082
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
you guys remember that game. It's kind of an

2083
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
artsy action game from

2084
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Ignition. Well now

2085
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
the rights

2086
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
have been transferred to the creator.

2087
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
So now there's going to be

2088
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
well El Shaddai is now

2089
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
back in the creators

2090
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
I guess portfolio

2091
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
as far as the rights go and maybe

2092
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
that means it's going to open up opportunity

2093
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
for more games. You know what's making me cry right now?

2094
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Every time

2095
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
anyone talks about that game I hear Amy Grant.

2096
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Baby baby.

2097
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
No no no because she

2098
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
when she was like heavy heavy into

2099
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
her Christian singing mode she did a song called

2100
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
El Shaddai.

2101
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Keep in mind I was raised Baptist.

2102
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Ok here's the thing. The references

2103
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
on this show are getting more and more obscure.

2104
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Ok well the full title

2105
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
was El Shaddai the Ascension of the Metatron

2106
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
so it's you know. Did she do a song

2107
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
called Metatron? No

2108
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
but I just finished watching the season

2109
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Supernatural and there's Metatron in it.

2110
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Lordy.

2111
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
So let's

2112
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
see. Metatron.

2113
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Yeah.

2114
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
And sorry

2115
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Brad I adore you to death.

2116
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
It was a decent song but her Hebrew

2117
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
was awful.

2118
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Alright moving on. I'm

2119
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
shocked that so many people know that

2120
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Amy Grant song. I only remember

2121
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
baby baby

2122
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
something something lyrics.

2123
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
There's one song that she did that I really

2124
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
like and that was the duet she did with Vince Gill

2125
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
who she married. Just saying.

2126
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
What ever happened to her? She's still

2127
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
recording and still married to Vince Gill.

2128
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
She's still recording?

2129
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Yeah I actually

2130
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
believe it or not the only

2131
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
side I could get working was Wikipedia.

2132
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
And

2133
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
I

2134
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
was reading up about

2135
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
actually Vince Gill but it linked to

2136
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Amy Grant so I was like.

2137
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Isn't that amazing how on Wikipedia

2138
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
you could just. She married him.

2139
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
She's married to Vince Gill. I believe you.

2140
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Mom was watching that Oklahoma relief

2141
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
thing and Vince Gill was on it so we looked at Vince Gill

2142
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
and it led to Amy Grant.

2143
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
She's back to doing super

2144
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Christian stuff.

2145
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
And singing with Vince.

2146
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Jamie

2147
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Jamie.

2148
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Oh.

2149
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Oh.

2150
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Oh.

2151
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
For the record she does have

2152
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
a gorgeous voice.

2153
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
I remember

2154
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
I got

2155
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
I remember I got dragged

2156
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
to this to an Amy Grant concert

2157
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
at the

2158
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
state fair. I got dragged

2159
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
to one of those and it was just

2160
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
not fun.

2161
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Did you sing along? No I didn't.

2162
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
I'm not a fan of Amy Grant.

2163
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
I like I recognize that song but I don't know any

2164
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
of her other songs. Hey you know what

2165
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
you know the only show that I

2166
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
the only concert I've been taken to at a fair

2167
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
against my will was Michael

2168
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Damien. I think literally that is the

2169
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
only concert I have seen at the

2170
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
state fair is the Amy Grant one.

2171
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
And I don't remember who opened it. It was another

2172
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Christian artist. You haven't been to see where

2173
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
now. No I said you haven't been to

2174
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
see where now this year

2175
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
I see where now it's a

2176
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
hundred and some degrees outside. I don't

2177
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
go outside for anybody. He can come to my house

2178
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Jamie

2179
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Jamie. I mean I went to

2180
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Fresno to see where now.

2181
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
So all right.

2182
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Moving on back. Oh we were a video game show.

2183
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
I didn't realize

2184
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
one thing you could pick up and you could sing baby

2185
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
baby while you're downloading it in the queue is the

2186
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Humble Indie Bundle 8. That's right

2187
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
the Humble Indie Bundle 8 is here and

2188
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
it has games such as Thomas was

2189
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Alone, Awesomenauts, Little Inferno

2190
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Dear Esther and Capsized

2191
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
and if you pay more than the average purchase

2192
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
price. I don't know what it is right at this moment. It's probably

2193
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
like six or seven bucks. You will

2194
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
also get Hotline Miami and

2195
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Proteus. Now I'm just going to guess

2196
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Did you say Proteus? No

2197
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Proteus. Damn.

2198
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Not like I don't already have five copies

2199
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
of Proteus. Now here's the thing. If this

2200
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
goes anything like the former bundles did

2201
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
somewhere in the last week they're going to say

2202
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
by the way we're throwing in these Humble Bundle 7

2203
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
games as well. So look out for it.

2204
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
I'm actually going to pay for this for one game.

2205
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
What game? Hotline Miami. Yeah

2206
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
I hear it's really fun. Because it's blood

2207
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
everywhere and you can shoot like Dobermans

2208
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
in the face. I'm going to get this just because

2209
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
I like indie games and I've pretty

2210
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
much gotten every other indie bundle. I already got it.

2211
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Did you? Have you checked out any

2212
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
of the games yet? No. They'll just sit there

2213
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
in my Steam library. I have

2214
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
now in my Steam library 126

2215
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
games. And that's not all of them

2216
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
because I haven't bothered to put all of the

2217
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Sonic the Hedgehog games in.

2218
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
I only because I bought the Sonic collection with

2219
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
every single Sonic the Hedgehog game that's on PC.

2220
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
And I only put in Sonic and

2221
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Sega All-Stars Racing and Sonic Generations.

2222
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
I didn't bother to put the rest of the ones. Okay. Sonic

2223
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Generations is a damn good game. They also

2224
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
have well you saw I don't know if you saw they have a mod

2225
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
that actually it's Sonic

2226
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
it converts it to

2227
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
the other Sonic 3D game

2228
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
that they had. I don't remember.

2229
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
I see Tiger Claw in the chat room saying

2230
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Hotline Miami has a good soundtrack

2231
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
and the good news is you will also be

2232
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
able to get the soundtracks with these games.

2233
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
DRM free downloads, Steam keys,

2234
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Windows, Mac and Linux versions.

2235
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,000
For the record. For the record.

2236
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Whatever games that I don't

2237
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
keep out of this I'm more than happy to share with

2238
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
some of our listeners. And

2239
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
and and

2240
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
I should mention that they also

2241
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
have a Humble Weekly Bundle

2242
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
that's going on right now that's all the Telltale

2243
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
series. Oh yeah I saw that too. Which I also

2244
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
bought. That's a great deal.

2245
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Walking Dead, Sam & Max

2246
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Walking Dead alone is worth it

2247
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
if you don't already have it. Yeah if you pay more than average

2248
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
it's Walking Dead. You get Sam & Max

2249
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Also great. You know Back to the

2250
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Future. Great.

2251
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Puzzle Agent which I've never played

2252
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Waltzing Gromit.

2253
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Poker Night the Inventory

2254
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
and

2255
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Jurassic Park?

2256
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
No Jurassic Park.

2257
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Probably because of licensing.

2258
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Anyhow, apparently

2259
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
earlier this week Eve Online and Dust

2260
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
514 which is the game that ties into it

2261
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
they were taken down. CCP actually

2262
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
took them down due to a significant and

2263
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
sustained DDoS attack.

2264
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
That's a Distributed Denial of Service attack.

2265
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
That was according to Eve Online's

2266
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Facebook. Don't know who

2267
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
tried to do it or why but

2268
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
yeah the whole game went down so look

2269
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
at stupid kids ruining everybody's

2270
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
fun. Stop DDoSing

2271
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
MMOs and kicking everybody

2272
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
off. This is trying to have a good time. By the way

2273
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
speaking of DDoS attacks, Bobby asked me to

2274
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
relay the following along.

2275
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Should we lose the stream at some point

2276
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
during the show tonight? Don't hit F5

2277
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
to refresh the entire page because when you all

2278
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
do it at once it's like a little mini DDoS

2279
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
attack because we're not on the servers

2280
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
as big as Eve Online or Dust 514.

2281
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
We're running off a tin can

2282
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
that has some computer chips

2283
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
in it because that's what we paid for you know because

2284
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
we don't have a lot of money at VoG. So when you all

2285
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
refresh it at once it's like a little DDoS attack

2286
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
that could cause everything to break further. So please

2287
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
all you have to do, it's right by

2288
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
the little player, you just hit pause,

2289
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
unpause, pause, unpause.

2290
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
There you go. And that will not

2291
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
do a DDoS attack on our little

2292
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
website.

2293
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
If you are a

2294
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Vita owner you'll be excited to know that

2295
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Flower is coming to the Vita.

2296
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
This is awesome. I love Flower.

2297
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
I played it on the Playstation 3 but I would

2298
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
say it's the best racing game

2299
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
I've played in a long time even though

2300
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
you would not think of Flower as a racing

2301
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
game. It's really great.

2302
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Flower is going to be on the Vita. It will be one

2303
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
of the Indiecade games coming

2304
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
to E3.

2305
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
It was one of the few games that used that tilt

2306
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
control inside the Dualshot controller.

2307
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
It will obviously use that

2308
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
on the Vita because it has a touch screen

2309
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
and all that fun stuff.

2310
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Cool. Check that out

2311
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
on the Vita.

2312
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Next up, Dark Sakura.

2313
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Hold on, I'm saying that I only care about R-Type.

2314
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
What, in the

2315
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
chat room? Talking about Irem games.

2316
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Oh, okay, I'm sorry. Because R-Type is freaking

2317
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
great. Okay, tell me that R-Type

2318
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
does not have the best first stage music

2319
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
of almost any game ever.

2320
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
If you said it doesn't then you're lying.

2321
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
So,

2322
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
you don't know Jack

2323
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
is going to be on Ouya

2324
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
on June 11th and

2325
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
the Jackpad app

2326
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
will make your phone a controller.

2327
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
So, folks who have

2328
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Ouya's and an

2329
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Android phone or an

2330
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
iOS will get to have a

2331
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
controller out of their phone.

2332
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
Yay.

2333
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Aren't you special.

2334
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Square Enix registered

2335
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Final Fantasy Agito.

2336
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Which is something that we heard at E3

2337
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
what, five years ago? Six years ago?

2338
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Eventually.

2339
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Because they were supposed to do

2340
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Final Fantasy Agito 13.

2341
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
So, now they've got

2342
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Final Fantasy Agito.

2343
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Hooray. There you go. Perfect question for Bobby

2344
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Blackwell. So, where's versus 13?

2345
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Oh, a question for the screen.

2346
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Well, here's the thing

2347
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
is that either that's going to be

2348
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
answered once E3 starts.

2349
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
I kind of think it's a game that has to

2350
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
show up in one way or another. Whether it's true

2351
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
that they moved it to 15 or what.

2352
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
I kind of think you'll have something on that well

2353
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
before the show starts. But, let's say

2354
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
they do announce Final Fantasy

2355
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
versus 13 and you want to know

2356
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
is lightning in it? You know, or something

2357
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
that they don't say. I don't know. You could go

2358
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
ask that question. Well, remember the

2359
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Agito 13 turned into

2360
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
the zero one.

2361
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
I do. I'm happy it's

2362
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
hopefully. Which I wish we would have gotten a

2363
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
release over here because everyone tells me it's

2364
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
sick as anything. Well, maybe this is

2365
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
a sign. I hope.

2366
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
And then last but never least

2367
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
for fans of the game Tookitori 2

2368
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
which is on Wii U

2369
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
it's getting a Steam release date. It's going to be

2370
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
out today.

2371
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
Already. July 2nd.

2372
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
As announced by

2373
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
developer Two Tribes.

2374
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
And in the PC version is a Steam

2375
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
workshop integration and achievements.

2376
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
So, there's also

2377
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
a level editor that was

2378
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
promised for Wii U and

2379
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
well, they don't have that yet.

2380
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Wii! Nintendo and online?

2381
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
It's coming soon, trademark

2382
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
patent pending. You know what else

2383
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
is coming soon? Hey, you know what though

2384
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
at this point? If the Xbox

2385
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
One connect is going to watch me poop

2386
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
then like give me the Wii U

2387
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
and it's outdated technology

2388
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
alright?

2389
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
You know what? I'm just

2390
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
going to go home and hook up the turbo duo

2391
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
and play me some freaking Dracula X

2392
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
and not worry about my system

2393
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
watching me in my pajamas.

2394
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
The end.

2395
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Instead of ceiling cat

2396
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
is watching you masturbate. It'll be Xbox One

2397
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Bill Gates is watching you masturbate.

2398
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Alright, let's go to the FUGO question

2399
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
of the week. Which thank heavens

2400
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
tonight is not about masturbation.

2401
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Where's my theme music?

2402
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Everything is broken tonight. I ate it.

2403
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Who ate my theme music?

2404
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
The uh

2405
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
connected while it was watching you poop.

2406
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
No, seriously guys

2407
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
I don't have my theme music. Help me feel time.

2408
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Doo doo doo doo doo

2409
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
No, not by singing.

2410
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
You don't want to hear me sing anyway.

2411
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
I want that game

2412
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Ikuma. Tell, tell, go

2413
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
to Square Enix and tell them to give it to me.

2414
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Tell them to give me the

2415
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
zero. I wants it.

2416
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Can't you just import it?

2417
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
So what exactly is the downside for

2418
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
I don't think I can read it.

2419
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Not voting on Steam Greenlight

2420
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
titles. I never understood that. Like

2421
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
You don't get your little mini

2422
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
achievement. Well it's like if you

2423
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
don't vote for them then

2424
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
you know, so what? So you

2425
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
thumbs up them and then you don't buy it.

2426
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
They're not holding you to the fire to like

2427
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
oh well you said you'd purchase this game

2428
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
why aren't you purchasing this game?

2429
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
And I actually want to wonder if

2430
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
the chat room actually missed what I said that

2431
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
Agito 13 was zero.

2432
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Because that's what I said right? Yeah, yeah.

2433
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Okay. Making sure people are paying attention.

2434
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Alright. Anyhow I would love to

2435
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
answer Loki's question but

2436
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
I found music.

2437
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Take Facebook and Google

2438
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
and smash them together you get FUGL.

2439
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
And our way to interact with our fan communities

2440
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
every week with the FUGL question of

2441
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
the week. Now we didn't talk about

2442
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
this story earlier in the show so I'll mention it now.

2443
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
A little known side quest in

2444
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Final Fantasy 9 came to light via

2445
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
an uploaded YouTube. Apparently some guide

2446
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
in Japan that had been out for years but was

2447
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
always untranslated. Somebody found

2448
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
it and found that there was this extra quest in the game.

2449
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Well anyhow, although

2450
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
I'm not going to get into all the details on Final Fantasy 9

2451
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
because it sounds complicated.

2452
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
This had us thinking about rediscovering things

2453
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
in classic games. Have you ever

2454
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
revisited an old game years after

2455
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
its release to find something new?

2456
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Go back and complete it at 100%?

2457
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
What classic game did you revisit after

2458
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
many years? Not necessarily to play it

2459
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
for the first time but to try and discover

2460
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
new things inside it.

2461
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
So let's check out what some of our

2462
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
folks on Facebook thought.

2463
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
We'll start with Jeremy Jay who answered

2464
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
I discovered a trick in Super Metroid

2465
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
five or six years after playing

2466
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
it for the first time. You can call

2467
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
the Dragon boss with your

2468
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
grappling beam.

2469
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Pretty neat stuff. I guess it's common knowledge

2470
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
to many but I had no idea.

2471
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
And he linked us a little to YouTube. You know there's

2472
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
a lot of ways you can kind of trick that

2473
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
game. You can do like wall jumps and

2474
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
get past places you're not supposed to. There's lots

2475
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
of little ways you can kind of like trick it and beat

2476
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
the system so that's one of the really cool

2477
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
that's what makes part of what makes

2478
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Super Metroid the best

2479
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
ever. No that's

2480
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
where you could get to the top of the castle by

2481
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
doing the double jump and get your final star

2482
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
in Super Mario 64

2483
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
just saying. Alright

2484
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
anyway Tiara responds

2485
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
and says I've actually been

2486
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
replaying Final Fantasy 9 for the past several

2487
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
weeks and I never knew about this side quest until

2488
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
I stumbled upon the info while

2489
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
looking for Chocobo hot and cold treasure

2490
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
locations. So you're

2491
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
going to be one of the first to see it.

2492
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
DarkTetsuya says up until a couple

2493
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
sorry for the Facebook noise but I'm actually on

2494
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
Facebook trying to read these answers.

2495
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
DarkTetsuya says up until a couple years ago

2496
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
I'd never beaten the fabled second quest

2497
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
in The Legend of Zelda on NES. Trust

2498
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
me when I say it is harder than the first

2499
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
quest. Really? That is true.

2500
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Well a lot of people go back

2501
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
and beat retro games. Well

2502
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
and for the record for anyone who wants to do

2503
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
it without beating

2504
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
the game first just type in Zelda for your name.

2505
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
That is true. Also Zelda is another one of those

2506
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
games where you don't have to have every item. You

2507
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
can get around some of this stuff. Like you could

2508
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
get through the whole game with a wooden sword I think.

2509
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Don't forget to walk head first into

2510
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
walls because you never know which one is invisible.

2511
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
You never know. Alright

2512
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
let's see.

2513
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Andy R. replied and said I replayed Okami

2514
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
earlier this year thanks to the HD-ification

2515
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
version and I found a lot of things

2516
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
I didn't find the first time. Things such as

2517
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
the hidden spider bosses or some of the advanced

2518
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
forms of the brush techniques. Also

2519
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
knowing what happens in the story before I

2520
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
started made me more cognizant of the foreshadowing

2521
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
I missed the first time I played the game

2522
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
which was kind of cool.

2523
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Mary B. replied

2524
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
with another Final Fantasy answer. Final Fantasy 8

2525
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
learned how to crazy attack with

2526
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Squall's 2 hour or whatever it was

2527
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
and that it was stronger than his summit. Did they

2528
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
have 2 hour abilities in Final Fantasy 8 or was that

2529
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
your Final Fantasy 11 addiction talking

2530
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
after getting stuck on Bahamut.

2531
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
I had to come back to a save down at Bahamut

2532
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
after not playing for months. Final Fantasy

2533
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
X and X-2 just for fun because I liked

2534
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
them so much. Use strategy guide to get 100%

2535
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
though.

2536
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Ragenator said well at least prior to my PS3

2537
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
being stolen I regularly went back and played

2538
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
older classics. The closest thing to

2539
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
discovering something new was in terms

2540
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
of tactics for situations where I got stuck

2541
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
in the past. And Degenerate Johnny

2542
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
says a couple years ago I decided to hook up my

2543
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Genesis to test and see if it still worked after

2544
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
all this time. It did surprisingly.

2545
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
I did

2546
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
excuse me. I decided to fulfill

2547
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
my nostalgic urge to play the original Mortal

2548
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Kombat. Unfortunately I forgot

2549
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
the blood code. There are some things you

2550
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
just forget as a gamer. I couldn't tell you

2551
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
that I could remember it. Game facts.

2552
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
I knew fatalities not sure

2553
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
all were possible without the blood code

2554
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
so I tried it out with Kano.

2555
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
To my surprise Kano managed to do his finishing move.

2556
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
However instead of a heart he pulled

2557
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
out an organ that was dark colored. I

2558
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
can only assume that he pulled out his opponent's

2559
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
liver.

2560
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
It's an evil thing. It must be destroyed. Even with

2561
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
no blood code Mortal Kombat surprised me

2562
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
with the amount of gore it was still able to show

2563
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
on the consoles.

2564
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Alright going over to Google Plus

2565
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
and some of the answers

2566
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
there.

2567
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Are there no answers on Google Plus? Oh no there's

2568
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
two. Sorry. Google Plus changed

2569
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
and now I can't find things. Alright. Redertainment

2570
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
says I remember me and my best friend as a

2571
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
kid trying and failing to beat Mega Man

2572
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
2 on the NES. No matter how many

2573
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
different times or many different ways we tried to beat

2574
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
the game we could never get past one particular

2575
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
part in Dr. Wily's fortress at the end.

2576
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
It wasn't until I was older

2577
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
bought the Mega Man collection on PS2

2578
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
and had access to online walkthroughs that I

2579
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
finally got the item you needed in order

2580
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
to proceed past that one particular part.

2581
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
When I finally beat that game it felt like

2582
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
I was giving my 8 year old self a figurative

2583
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
high five. Not a literal high five

2584
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
because that would break the space time continuum.

2585
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
And lastly Travis H

2586
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
on Google Plus says I have found myself

2587
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
overjoyed with the amount of PS1 and PSP

2588
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
games I can replay on my Vita.

2589
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
I'm right now in the middle of playing Wild Arms

2590
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
trying to complete it to its fullest

2591
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
and find things that I missed the first time

2592
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
around. It is very refreshing to go back

2593
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
at an older age and enjoy the simple things

2594
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
as the dialogue and some humor

2595
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
you may not have got when you were younger.

2596
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Talk about a good soundtrack by the way.

2597
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Will anything

2598
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
work during tonight's show?

2599
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Now Alan is breaking things in the kitchen.

2600
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
I thought it was because I mentioned Wild Arms because that game

2601
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
is hot.

2602
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Oh my gosh. Alright. There you go.

2603
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Thank you to the folks that

2604
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
answered the Facebook question of the week and the Google Plus

2605
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
question of the week. Answer

2606
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
in a future week. I want to say quickly though

2607
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
about that last answer was very similar to one of the

2608
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Facebook answers and a couple things we were hearing

2609
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
is that these HD remakes

2610
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
really seem to get people to go back and play them

2611
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
again. And I kind of find that to

2612
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
be true too. Is that when the things get

2613
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
re-released it's like a reason for me to go back.

2614
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Like it's why I had never tried

2615
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
to beat Mario 2 with just one character before.

2616
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
So that was something I kind of did that was new this week.

2617
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
Try doing it with Toad.

2618
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
The desert levels would be

2619
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
manageable. I actually only used

2620
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Toad in the desert levels for the most part but I did

2621
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
now this was keep in mind when I was a

2622
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
kid I did a full playthrough with Toad.

2623
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
And you would be surprised

2624
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
at the number of coins you get.

2625
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
I was playing the stupid bonus game for ages.

2626
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Because he had

2627
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
a faster dig.

2628
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
SSG100 Matt to the rescue in the chat room.

2629
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
A, B, A, C, A, B, B.

2630
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
That was the blood code.

2631
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
There you go Degenerajani. A, B, A, C, A, B, B.

2632
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Abacab.

2633
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Alright.

2634
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
That does it.

2635
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Let's go into some more news.

2636
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
And then of course the mailbag and the FUs of the week.

2637
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
Loki!

2638
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Alright, so hey guess what?

2639
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Even though they haven't released their first

2640
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
game yet, the next

2641
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Kickstarter for Double Fine

2642
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
has been launched.

2643
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
It's a brand new game called

2644
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Massive Chalice and it's

2645
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
kind of a cross between like

2646
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
a feudal fantasy

2647
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
tactical strategy game

2648
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
with like this weird

2649
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
I guess

2650
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
they're saying there's like permanent death in the game

2651
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
so you have to create new

2652
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
characters by breeding them I guess.

2653
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
So um

2654
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
yeah.

2655
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
That's going to be coming I guess.

2656
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
And it looks interesting.

2657
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
They're most likely going to hit their goals since

2658
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
they're at 677,500

2659
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
right now and

2660
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
their goal is 725,000

2661
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
and they've got 24 days to go.

2662
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
So most likely they are going to

2663
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
make it.

2664
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
So yeah.

2665
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
I don't know.

2666
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Looks interesting.

2667
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
It's being headed up I guess by the guy that did

2668
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Iron Brigade.

2669
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Bradner.

2670
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
Speaking of Kickstarter stuff by the way

2671
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
the Zelda Kickstarter we had

2672
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
that guy on the show a couple weeks ago didn't make it.

2673
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Didn't make it. Bummer.

2674
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
He says he has some other plans though

2675
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
and good luck to him with Plan B.

2676
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
I think you got to have a Plan B when you go

2677
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
into this Kickstarter thing because I think

2678
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
it's like going

2679
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
viral you know.

2680
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
And like these ad agencies will

2681
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
hire people saying we need you to make a viral

2682
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
ad but sometimes it just

2683
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
either it's going to catch or it's

2684
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
not and it's not that it's necessarily bad

2685
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
it just sometimes it happens and sometimes

2686
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
it doesn't. Now when you're double fine

2687
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
and you have that name recognition well this

2688
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
you know the money is going to come to him pretty easy

2689
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
but you know unfortunately

2690
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
for the Zelda movie

2691
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
and all that it just didn't catch on

2692
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
for whatever reason and that's going to happen sometimes

2693
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
so good luck

2694
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
to him with whatever he decides

2695
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
to do with his Plan B.

2696
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
That makes me quite sad.

2697
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
Yeah it's unfortunate. Very unfortunate. I had put in some money

2698
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
but I got it back

2699
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
or I should say they never charged it because that's what happens

2700
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
they don't charge it until it goes through.

2701
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Alright.

2702
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Going to some news for the 3DS

2703
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
the 3D Sonic that I

2704
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
remember we talked about was rumored

2705
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
a couple weeks ago. Apparently it is something

2706
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
that's happening because the Australian Classification

2707
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Board issued ratings.

2708
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
You got to love when the ratings board spoils games.

2709
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Well not only did they roll out a

2710
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
3D Sonic the Hedgehog rating but they

2711
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
also rolled out a 3D Altered

2712
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
Beast rating.

2713
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Apparently 3D Space Harrier

2714
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
3D Super Hang-On

2715
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
these are all out in Japan already

2716
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
but the fact that they're rated in Australia means

2717
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
they're probably coming around to the rest of the world too.

2718
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Which by the way if I am right

2719
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
and they're the same as the Sega Ages

2720
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
what was it

2721
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
I imported like 3 of them. I had the Fantasy

2722
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Star, the Fantasy

2723
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Zone and Space Harrier. They're really good.

2724
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
If it's in the same line.

2725
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Well these will be 3D.

2726
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
I'm all about Space Harrier

2727
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
3D Super Hang-On yeah Sonic yeah Altered Beast

2728
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
look Altered Beast is one of those games

2729
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
that everybody

2730
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
remembers that and like in people's memories

2731
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
it's awesome but like I played through the game

2732
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
not that long ago. It sucks.

2733
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
Like Altered Beast sucks. I'm sorry

2734
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
to say it. It is not aged well

2735
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
whatsoever. When I was 12

2736
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
that game was the shit. When I'm 34

2737
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
not so much. We needed a Marble

2738
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Madness. We do need a Marble Madness.

2739
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
That wasn't Sega. I don't care though.

2740
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
It would be awesome. Wasn't it Williams

2741
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
or Midway?

2742
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
It was Atari. Yeah Atari.

2743
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Which their arcade division got

2744
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
snapped up by Midway I believe. I think that's what

2745
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
I'm thinking of. Which in turn

2746
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
got snapped up by Warner.

2747
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
The game's great if you've got a track ball to play it with.

2748
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Well I could

2749
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
do something with the touch pad

2750
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
who knows. Alright

2751
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Dark Sakura what do you have for us?

2752
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Well as soon as I can get it up. There we go.

2753
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams

2754
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
developer. We like them don't

2755
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
we because they gave us that wonderful

2756
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
series back didn't they?

2757
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
It's Black Forest Games. They've announced

2758
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
another game called Ravensdale

2759
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
that's a four player co-op

2760
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
side scrolling platform shooter

2761
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
set in a medieval oil rig city.

2762
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Looking

2763
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
at the screen capture here it's

2764
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
pretty grimy. Very

2765
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
oily looking.

2766
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
They wanted it to be an

2767
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
action RPG

2768
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
but publishers were saying that Steampunk

2769
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
doesn't sell so that's why

2770
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
they are

2771
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
it looks like they've changed

2772
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
the method of this. I don't know has anyone else

2773
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
heard anything about this?

2774
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
No not this particular

2775
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
game. No.

2776
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
Well their likelihood saying that we're

2777
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
going to see a kickstarter in

2778
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
about a month or two. Since they're

2779
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
not finding a publisher they're going to go

2780
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
the Giana Sisters route. But I mean

2781
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
if judging by Giana Sisters it's probably

2782
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
going to be good. So

2783
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
they got a good track record.

2784
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Yes yes I still need to play that

2785
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Twisted Dreams. It's one of those games that's like in my queue

2786
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
waiting to play but I loved the

2787
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
Commodore 64 one even though yes it was

2788
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
kind of the Mario Brothers rip off but

2789
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
soundtrack is part of what I remember most

2790
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
fondly but. It's pretty good. I

2791
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
have it downloaded but I played

2792
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
it like once and then I

2793
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
went back to Saints Row the Third.

2794
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
I did not like Saints Row the Third.

2795
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
What's wrong with you?

2796
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
I just

2797
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
didn't like how the game started off.

2798
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
It's so funny. I laughed and

2799
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
laughed. Did you get to the part where they're skydiving out of the plane?

2800
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
You got to at least get that far

2801
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
because I died. It was so funny.

2802
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
I just found I didn't like the

2803
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
control that's all.

2804
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
Alright I didn't like Mass Effect the first time I

2805
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
played it just saying. Alright

2806
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Loki what do you have for us?

2807
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
So there's some more announcements coming from

2808
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Japan for the Wii U.

2809
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
First off the Wii U is now going to be

2810
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
available in white for the 32 gigabyte

2811
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
premium set. That's starting

2812
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
July 13th and

2813
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
I guess it will be available in black and white

2814
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
since they already have the black to begin with.

2815
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
And then of course they're going to be

2816
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
I guess

2817
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
doing some sort of

2818
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
and I'm surprised it's taken so god damn

2819
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
long for this but they're doing

2820
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
well first they have a larger

2821
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
capacity battery for the

2822
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
Wii U gamepad so it's going to

2823
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
be 2500 maw

2824
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
instead of 1500 maw

2825
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
which will I guess equal to

2826
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
5-8 hours of

2827
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
you know gameplay as opposed

2828
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
to 3-5 and then on top of that

2829
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
they're having official

2830
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Wii remote

2831
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
charge

2832
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
battery packs for it.

2833
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
Like woah

2834
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
how many years after the Wii

2835
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
and they finally got around to

2836
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
putting out battery packs for it because

2837
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
hey those Wii remotes

2838
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
eat batteries like you know

2839
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
I thought this was a Wii U battery pack.

2840
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
No they have a Wii U battery pack and they also

2841
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
have battery packs for the Wii.

2842
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
I didn't realize that was a separate thing. It's crazy.

2843
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
They're doing that and they even have like a little

2844
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
charger that goes along with it. Now

2845
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
it's a little late to the game considering

2846
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
that Nyko and you know I think

2847
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
Dream Gear have had battery packs for the

2848
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
longest time for

2849
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
it but it's interesting to see

2850
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
something official from them

2851
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
and yeah

2852
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
so those will be coming soon

2853
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
because they're only in Japan right now.

2854
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Until they announce something at E3

2855
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
this week where these are coming

2856
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
with a price drop.

2857
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
Maybe, maybe, I don't know

2858
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
might be thinking

2859
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
too positively.

2860
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
We'll see.

2861
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
This game looks very cool.

2862
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
I'm going to play some of the YouTube here in the

2863
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
background so you can hear some of the music

2864
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
but it's a game called

2865
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
Crypt of the Necrodancer.

2866
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
It is a roguelike

2867
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
game which is you know like a

2868
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
dungeon crawler like if you think way, way, way back

2869
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
to the old terminal

2870
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
game Rogue but it's mixed with a

2871
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
music game.

2872
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
It's a hardcore rhythm based

2873
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
roguelike.

2874
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Notable game composers Danny B

2875
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
and Alec Holowaka

2876
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
or excuse me Holowka are

2877
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
working with Crypt of the Necrodancer

2878
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
which I think is awesome and you can also load

2879
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
your own MP3s into the game if you want although

2880
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
I don't know how well that will work but there you go.

2881
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
That looks

2882
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
awesome and you can check that out at

2883
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Necrodancer.com

2884
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
Very cool.

2885
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
I like both those types of games

2886
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
that's like a game made for Rob.

2887
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Dungeon Crawler meets DDR

2888
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
love it.

2889
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
I just need my dance pad. Alright

2890
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
let's get to our mailbag

2891
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
every week you guys send us emails

2892
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
and Dark Soccer reads some of her favorites here on

2893
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
the show. In fact she's got a couple

2894
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
weeks to catch up on with no

2895
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
official show last week and so forth

2896
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
so uh

2897
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
unfortunately she was trying to sell. No one of my

2898
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
stitches came out it actually broke when

2899
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
I flipped the foot inside out so

2900
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
I was trying to fix it real quick. I thought I had time

2901
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
before mailbag. Oh well.

2902
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
So a freaking ton of mail

2903
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
and a lot of it's

2904
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
in Mandarin Chinese so let's

2905
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
skip all those. That was the spam.

2906
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
That was the spam. Except for the stuff

2907
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
in French which I could actually read but I don't really

2908
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
care about beeps that much. Spam-der-in.

2909
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Womp womp.

2910
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
So this

2911
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
comes from Ra-ba-ba-ba-ba.

2912
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
I noticed

2913
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
the Curiosity game from 22Cans

2914
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
is approaching the center. Well there's

2915
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
a countdown on each cube and I believe it was

2916
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
at 13 when I wrote this on Monday. I made

2917
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
my final cynical conclusions about it. Of course

2918
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
we've already done a big reveal. But I like

2919
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
reading this stuff.

2920
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
It appears the cubes do not get smaller

2921
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
as you get closer to the center. It isn't

2922
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
fun not even as bubble wrap. It gets boring

2923
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
easily and after I toyed with it once or twice

2924
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
I'm content to just see it end.

2925
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
The payoff at the end will be disappointing.

2926
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
The life changing promise is way too

2927
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
large a nebulous. I love the word nebulous

2928
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
by the way. I hope the center is

2929
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
remember to drink your Ovaltine.

2930
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
Stay pound zero zero zero zero

2931
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
zero zero Ra-ba-ba. Of course

2932
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
you know what that is.

2933
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Stay black.

2934
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
You've been listening. Okay.

2935
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
No you haven't. We have another one from Ra-ba-ba-ba.

2936
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
You guys asked for

2937
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
our reaction to the Xbox One so here's mine.

2938
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
First when listening to the May 19th episode

2939
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
I read up on the Xbox One so the podcast

2940
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
was full of unintentional dramatic irony.

2941
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
It was fun to hear

2942
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
after the reveal. That said my original

2943
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
reaction on the name is that it

2944
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
was literally the last name I'd consider for the new

2945
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
Xbox. Then I realized simply

2946
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
Xbox was literally the last name

2947
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
I expected so they chose the pen's

2948
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
ultimate name of all I could come up

2949
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
with. Overall the name is

2950
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
pretty good as it conveys multiple

2951
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
meanings, is easy to remember and understandable

2952
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
unlike Wii and Wii U which sound dumb even

2953
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
repulsive. The conveyed no

2954
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
obvious meaning

2955
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
I don't expect a lot of debate

2956
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
over what a terrible name one is.

2957
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
Does it have good games?

2958
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
At this point I don't really care.

2959
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
All I know is that there aren't many

2960
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
good games coming out for any system at the moment.

2961
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
They'll stop making games for

2962
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
PS4 and Xbox

2963
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
360 very soon and the new

2964
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
consoles will be my only choice for new

2965
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
games on console. Used games

2966
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
if I can't trade or give used

2967
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
games away I will probably not buy discs at all.

2968
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
I also believe this is how

2969
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
EA will implement Game Pass.

2970
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
The game DVR is interesting.

2971
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
It requires online to share so I suspect

2972
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
this will be an exclusive gold

2973
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
feature. I also

2974
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
expect that certain games will not be allowed on this

2975
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
feature, even gasp not allow

2976
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
certain parts to be recorded. That's all

2977
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
I'll bug you with today.

2978
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
This

2979
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
comes from Elliot B.

2980
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
It's the

2981
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
Oculus Rift report.

2982
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
Dear OLR, this week I was

2983
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
lucky enough to get some hands on time with the most exciting

2984
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
hardware release of the year.

2985
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
No, not the PS4 or Xbox One. I'm of course talking

2986
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
about the Oculus Rift.

2987
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
For those who don't know, the Rift is a VR headset with

2988
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
low latency head tracking providing an

2989
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
immersive 3D experience, in theory at least.

2990
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
While the reality doesn't

2991
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
quite yet live up to the hype, it's still an

2992
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
impressive device, even for a prototype.

2993
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
Oculus have got the basics

2994
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
down pat.

2995
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
The headset is easy to set up, weighs nothing

2996
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
and lag is unnoticeable.

2997
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
Unfortunately there is still a pretty major issue

2998
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
standing between the Rift and the mainstream

2999
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
success. Movement with standard

3000
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
FPS controls produce instant

3001
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
motion sickness. Even the peaceful

3002
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
Italian Villa demo is

3003
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
nauseating, let alone a fast paced shooter.

3004
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
DarkSucker, you have been warned. Thank you.

3005
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
My thinking is that

3006
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
rather than adapting existing games for the

3007
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
Rift, devs will need to keep in mind its weaknesses

3008
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
as well as strengths.

3009
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Still experiencing the Rift for the first

3010
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
time is a breathtaking experience, even

3011
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
despite its teething problems.

3012
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
To be any more than a novelty,

3013
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
it now needs some equally breathtaking

3014
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
custom built games. Yours virtually,

3015
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
Elliot B.

3016
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
Thank you Elliot. Good lord everybody, why are you

3017
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
writing me novels?

3018
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
Dear OLR, I would like to take this moment

3019
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
to thank Microsoft from the bottom of my heart

3020
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
for the Xbox One announcement. The amount of money

3021
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
I'll be saving by skipping their draconian

3022
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
unattractive Kinect mandatory disaster

3023
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
is enormous. You know

3024
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
it's funny I was worried about skipping this generation

3025
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
because I was afraid the PS4 was going to blow

3026
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
major chunks. How I even bought

3027
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
a Wii U out of that fear.

3028
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
Instead it seems Microsoft is going

3029
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
into the junior year slump that seems

3030
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
to happen with any successful console

3031
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
manufacturer. Seriously,

3032
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
first it was Nintendo with the

3033
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
64, then Sony with the PS3.

3034
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Now Microsoft with the Xbox One, by the way

3035
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
lamest name ever. We're getting

3036
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
quite a bit of

3037
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
mixed

3038
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
The PS3 though, it

3039
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
started off like a great comedy

3040
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
of errors, but after a couple years it got

3041
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
better and better. It grew into itself. It did.

3042
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
It fits its big boy pants.

3043
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
Nintendo 64 had its moments.

3044
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
You know, I wouldn't call Nintendo 64

3045
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
a flop. Pokemon Snap.

3046
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
Among

3047
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
well, Mario 64, some in

3048
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
Ocarina of Time, some considered to be the greatest games

3049
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
ever made, so it had that too.

3050
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
Well, and

3051
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
even Treasure did a couple of games

3052
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
for it, and we know what we think of Treasure.

3053
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
Okay.

3054
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
This isn't to say

3055
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
I'll be completely sitting out on gaming

3056
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
hardware this generation. Obviously I have

3057
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
my Wii U, and actually already

3058
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
have a bunch of games for it, and I'll be picking up the

3059
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
Retron 5 and Ouya when they're commercially available.

3060
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Also, since Sony doesn't appear

3061
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
to be restricting news games or mandating

3062
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
internet connections, the PS4 seems to be

3063
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
a viable option, unless something

3064
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
disastrous turns up at E3.

3065
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
Honestly, if Sony isn't looking

3066
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
at the Xbox One and saying, this is

3067
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
what we don't do, I'll be surprised.

3068
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
However, I can say with absolute certainty

3069
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
that I've got more than

3070
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
enough ga- you know, that was the first typo I found.

3071
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
You said then

3072
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
and so then?

3073
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
No, I was just thinking I was impressed, so

3074
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
good on you.

3075
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
More than enough gaming ready to go

3076
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
for the next five or so years, and that

3077
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
doesn't include GOG or humble

3078
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
bundles. However,

3079
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
almost as troubling as the DRM encumbrance

3080
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
on the Xbox One is

3081
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
Microsoft's continued commitment

3082
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
of trying to pimp the Xbox to people

3083
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
who don't give a crap about video games.

3084
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Does Microsoft not understand

3085
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
that there are cheaper alternatives for those who want

3086
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
set-top boxes? Seriously,

3087
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
media centers like Boxee and Apple TV

3088
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
are $80 to $100,

3089
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
and modern Blu-ray players are having

3090
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
more and more of those features put into them

3091
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
for about the same price or less.

3092
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
That's ignoring the obvious

3093
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
plug a cheap PC into your television

3094
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
through HDMI option. I

3095
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
shit you guys not, I can do the whole

3096
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
Netflix, YouTube, multimedia thing on my

3097
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
Blu-ray player, my PS3, my Nexus

3098
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
7 tablet, and my PC, and

3099
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
most of those options are also on my Wii U.

3100
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Microsoft goes full bore with the

3101
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
living room takeover thing at

3102
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
their own peril while I hesitate to wish

3103
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
them ill. I do hope they're awakened soon.

3104
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
Failing that, however,

3105
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
I'm good to go. Emulators on Ouya,

3106
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
retro goodness on the RetroN5,

3107
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
and modern gaming on the Wii U, and potentially

3108
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
a future on the PS4, and Japanese

3109
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
developers will likely be able to go right

3110
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
back to ignoring Microsoft, and all is right with the world.

3111
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Anyway, there's my thoughts

3112
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
on the Xbox One. Have I mentioned it's a stupid

3113
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
name? I have. Don't care.

3114
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
It's a stupid name. Seriously, it's worse than

3115
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Wii. Regards, we're all still UT.

3116
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
Thank you for the best written email

3117
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
I have ever read in my entire life

3118
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
except for your one type O.

3119
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
It's T-H-A-N,

3120
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
not T-H-E-N, and also... That is

3121
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
totally a lie. Well written. Shut up, Rob.

3122
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
No offense. Mr. KickStarter'd.

3123
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
No offense to the emailer.

3124
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
No. Well, you know it's my job to

3125
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
completely fuck up everyone's grammar.

3126
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
I think maybe it's a little bit overly

3127
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
cynical, but I

3128
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
will give until E3. Let's

3129
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
see what happens.

3130
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
So, you know, and just like

3131
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
Bobby said in the chatroom at live.vognetwork.com,

3132
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
Sony never

3133
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
said they weren't doing any of that.

3134
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
They just never answered the question.

3135
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
True dat. So,

3136
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
we'll see. They're not gonna

3137
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
be able to dodge it much longer. One foot.

3138
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
I have one scalemate foot.

3139
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
In your behind.

3140
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
Kick. In your angel butt.

3141
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
Okay, this comes from

3142
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Jay, who I was hanging out with, and just

3143
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
let me hop back into the chat long enough to keep from getting

3144
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
logged out. Sure. Okay.

3145
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
This email

3146
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
comes from Jay, Jammer Jay,

3147
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
who I was hanging out with on

3148
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
last Monday. Oh, is it gossip all about your

3149
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
experiences? No, it's not. It's pictures of

3150
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
me being sunburned.

3151
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
This is

3152
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
the highlight of my gaming week was

3153
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
playing DDR with the legendary DarkSakura.

3154
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
Yes, I know. Anyway.

3155
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
She did a fine job for getting back into

3156
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
DDR. I think it's time for Sky and Loki to brush

3157
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
off the rest and join her back into DDR.

3158
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
I played

3159
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
at Roseville Golf Land a couple months ago.

3160
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
I think when Spike and Tim

3161
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
that showed that Spike and Tim were here. We've gone to

3162
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
Golf Land earlier in the week. I have a pile of tokens

3163
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
which they don't even use anymore.

3164
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
It's all like a card. Maybe you could

3165
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
trade them in. I don't know. I mean, I don't think

3166
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
they'll do that. Well, they had to

3167
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
for a certain time. Okay.

3168
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
My summer advice for gamers. Be sure to have

3169
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
light sunscreen if planning to be out in the sun

3170
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
a bit. Oh, why? Yeah,

3171
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
because

3172
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
the thing is I'm not supposed to wear sunblock at all

3173
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
because I have a

3174
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
I don't make enough

3175
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
vitamin D normally so I didn't wear any.

3176
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
And then I forgot what humidity

3177
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
and sunlight really does and I'm

3178
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
still peeling.

3179
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
Anyways, it was nice seeing you again, DarkSakura.

3180
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
Thank you. It was good to see you too.

3181
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
And I look forward to meeting up with Sky and Loki for

3182
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
California DDR one day. Well, we would love to

3183
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
have you out here and you are more than welcome

3184
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
to crash at my place.

3185
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
And

3186
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
last email.

3187
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
Hello all. Just thought I

3188
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
would drop a line to say hello to the gang.

3189
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
I am in the middle of reading an amazing

3190
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
book called Ready Player One, which we've discussed

3191
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
on the show by Ernest Cline.

3192
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
I know I'm a little late to the party

3193
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
since the book has been out about two years now

3194
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
but it's so good.

3195
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
So much gaming culture and influence as well

3196
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
as a lot of great pop culture

3197
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
references from the 80s and 90s.

3198
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
I have two questions. To anyone who has read it

3199
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
what did you think? No spoilers.

3200
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
Which I think we've discussed in depth.

3201
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
I haven't read it yet. I'm going to be borrowing it from Becky I think.

3202
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Okay, good. I still haven't read it.

3203
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
I still need to read Catching

3204
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
Fire y'all before the movie's

3205
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
out. So I got a long

3206
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
book queue. You don't need to watch them

3207
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
or watch the book, read

3208
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
the book to watch the movie. Yeah, but

3209
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
like when I, see reading the book makes

3210
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
the movie better because when I went to see

3211
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
The Hunger Games, like every time they

3212
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
change something from the book it was like

3213
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
and then Alan would know that that was

3214
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
something that changed in the book because he could hear me huffing.

3215
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
So

3216
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
the fact that you got pissed off that they

3217
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
changed things in the book made it better? Yes, it made

3218
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
it a more interactive experience.

3219
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
Who won The Hunger Games? I did.

3220
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
You know what?

3221
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
It's kind of funny doing that with Battle Royale

3222
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
now that I've read the book.

3223
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
And seeing how the movie is just complete

3224
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
blood fest and not really political.

3225
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
It's very different. The manga is great though.

3226
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
So anyway,

3227
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
I'm only

3228
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
halfway through and my second question

3229
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
is to Loki. When you were doing that

3230
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
challenge a while back, this was the book

3231
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
you were doing it for, wasn't it?

3232
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
Yes. Anyone who

3233
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
hasn't read the book, stop what you were doing

3234
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
after the OLR show of course and go pick it

3235
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
up on Kindle or your local bookstore.

3236
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
You will not be disappointed. Keep up

3237
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
the great work you three make my Monday at

3238
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
office a lot less miserable. Your friend

3239
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
Travis. Ah, you make our Sunday mail bag

3240
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
a lot less miserable. It's our Travis H. You make our Sunday

3241
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
mail bag a lot less miserable. Thank you

3242
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
Travis. Thank you.

3243
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
And you know there's pictures that

3244
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
Jay sent but I think they're the same

3245
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
ones that he put up on Facebook.

3246
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
And they're not wanting to look.

3247
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
Yeah, my butt playing DDR.

3248
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
Your butt on a DDR machine.

3249
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
LOL. See.

3250
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
I'm not showing any of you in the chat room

3251
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
because no.

3252
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
Alright, well as long as you have fun. That's what DDR is about.

3253
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Because I'm the diva, that's why.

3254
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Speaking of diva moments

3255
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
it's time to get into that segment we do here

3256
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
every week on the show where we get a little bit angry.

3257
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
All this is bad.

3258
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
Here is justice.

3259
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
Here is punishment.

3260
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
Here.

3261
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
This is fucked up.

3262
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
F you

3263
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
to

3264
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
smoking in

3265
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
your house.

3266
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
And making

3267
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
all of my clothes

3268
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
smell like smoke.

3269
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
And then on top of

3270
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
okay this is me going into some family

3271
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
shit. Okay.

3272
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
My mom smokes in the house.

3273
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
Her husband smokes in the house.

3274
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
While my grandmother has vasculitis.

3275
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
And I was reading about

3276
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
just how badly second hand smoke

3277
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
can aggravate vasculitis.

3278
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Can aggravate a lot.

3279
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
Exactly. And then my mom's like

3280
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
my mom has asthma and she's saying that my shampoo

3281
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
is aggravating her asthma. No it was not.

3282
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
Your smoking is aggravating your damn asthma.

3283
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
When I smoked

3284
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
I would always go, which was a long time ago

3285
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
but I would always go outside.

3286
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
Most smokers I knew would do that.

3287
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Especially in this state.

3288
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
Like it's illegal to smoke anywhere that's not outside.

3289
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
And most outdoor places are also banned

3290
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
at this point in time.

3291
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
They actually banned it in Daphne. I had the most

3292
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
pleasant experience in a waffle house

3293
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
that I've ever had in my life.

3294
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
Because you couldn't smoke inside.

3295
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
You could actually smell your food. It was amazing.

3296
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
Also I love you Daphne

3297
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Waffle House. Your peanut butter

3298
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
waffles are so freaking

3299
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
good. And even though you're kind of

3300
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
racist assholes. Blue Bell Ice Cream.

3301
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
I love your ice cream too.

3302
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
Thank you for the banana pudding ice cream.

3303
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
And also FU2

3304
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
Attention Horse. Three hour show

3305
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
Jamie. Three hour show. I'm done. Alright.

3306
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
Loki. Fuck you to hot.

3307
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
Right? Because it's gonna get

3308
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
hot. Alright. It was like

3309
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
95 today or something

3310
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
and next week it's 105. Fuck that.

3311
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
Nope. I like the winter.

3312
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
Winter. It's cold. You put more layers on.

3313
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
You can only take off so many layers

3314
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
in the summer. It's gonna rain.

3315
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
No. It's gonna be hot.

3316
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
Alright. That's it?

3317
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
My FU of the Week just goes to the whole

3318
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
like when it rains it pours syndrome.

3319
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
I have a lot of good things going on right now.

3320
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
I can't really complain. Like there's nothing I'm doing

3321
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
where I'm like argh I'm so angry about this.

3322
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
But it's just like. Did Robbie

3323
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
bite off more than he could chew? I don't know.

3324
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
But it's actually one of those things where I'm like

3325
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
ok. When I have some

3326
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
days off next week. I have some time to

3327
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
catch up on some things. Then I can

3328
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
go have fun in LA.

3329
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
Even though I'll have to be driving down there by myself.

3330
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
But one of my friends is gonna be meeting me there

3331
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
and that makes everything a lot better. And then I'm meeting

3332
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
another one of my friends there. It makes it a lot better so.

3333
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
But just lots of stuff going

3334
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
on right now. So when it rains

3335
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
it pours. Argh.

3336
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
But it'll be good. It's like

3337
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
one of those things. You're like really

3338
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
upset about it. But then like when it's actually happening

3339
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
you're like I have the best life.

3340
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
Ok.

3341
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
Let's get to a couple more news stories for you guys.

3342
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
And then Twitter topics at

3343
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
twitter.com slash olr and the skype line

3344
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
at 1877 game olr

3345
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
or our username on skype orange lounge radio.

3346
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
Not just yet though. Couple more stories.

3347
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
Yes unfortunately we got some depressing stories.

3348
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
The first being that

3349
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
unfortunately there was a tragic event that happened

3350
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
this week. One of the

3351
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
engineers for the oculus

3352
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
oculus rift

3353
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
Andrew Scott Reese was

3354
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
killed in a

3355
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
basically

3356
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
a hit and run during a

3357
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
police chase. He was

3358
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
crossing the street in a crosswalk and got hit

3359
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
by a car that the police were chasing.

3360
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
And killed.

3361
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
That's awful. That sucks. Especially

3362
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
after we just had an email. Yeah after that email

3363
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
and everything. It's crazy. I mean what's really

3364
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
horrible about that is just like you know dude was crossing

3365
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
the street. And

3366
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
Didn't it happen to

3367
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
Gumpay. Fuck I can't remember his name.

3368
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
He did Metroid. I think he

3369
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
died in a car accident.

3370
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
I thought he was getting out of a car and got hit.

3371
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
Yeah yeah yeah that sounds familiar.

3372
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
It's on Wikipedia somewhere.

3373
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
But yeah it was really sad.

3374
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
And it's just you know obviously people

3375
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
car accidents happen every day and we lose

3376
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
great people. And pedestrians get hit every day

3377
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
unfortunately and we lose great people.

3378
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
It just really sucks that

3379
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
A this was such a great you know young mind

3380
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
that was inventing these things that everybody wanted

3381
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
to play. And B

3382
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
preventable. This guy

3383
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
this guy was not at fault. He wasn't

3384
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
like he wasn't crossing the street in a drug induced

3385
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
stupor or something. You know

3386
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
he was hit by a guy who was running from the

3387
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
police. Totally preventable.

3388
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
Like it's awful.

3389
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
It's awful.

3390
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
But what can

3391
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
you do. When it's

3392
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
time to go. You're gonna go.

3393
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
You know.

3394
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
But at the same time

3395
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
it's important not

3396
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
to. Well

3397
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
yeah you can't live in here.

3398
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
I'm just saying

3399
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
it's important to remember the basics

3400
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
that you learned in elementary school.

3401
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
You got to look both ways before you cross the street.

3402
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
And because I'm sorry but

3403
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
you know and not to say that he's at fault

3404
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
because it's tragic but

3405
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
if there's a police chase going

3406
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
and there's cars with sirens coming

3407
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
your way you can hear those sirens and

3408
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
you know you

3409
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
always want to look especially when I'm driving

3410
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
and stuff even though there's a green light I'm always

3411
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
looking you know you always I give it a couple

3412
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
seconds before I go because there's always

3413
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
someone that's not paying attention that's going to run the light.

3414
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
So you got to be defensive and always kind of

3415
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
keep your eye out even though it may be green or something.

3416
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
I remember actually it was funny the last time I

3417
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
went to E3 even

3418
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
a bus ran out of control

3419
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
and smashed into a Walgreens

3420
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
right through the crosswalk because

3421
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
it turned too fast or something like that.

3422
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
And you know

3423
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
someone could have gotten hurt.

3424
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
Thankfully there was someone that was in the way

3425
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
but they managed to get into the

3426
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
Walgreens before the bus

3427
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
hit but you just have to be careful.

3428
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
Alright so here's the deal

3429
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
with Gunpei Yokoi and if you don't know

3430
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
that name he's the guy who produced he worked for

3431
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
Nintendo for a long time producer of

3432
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
Kid Icarus and Metroid which is huge

3433
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
right there designed Rob the robot

3434
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
designed the Game Boy

3435
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
so you all know that one. Yes he designed the Virtual

3436
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
Boy 2 for which you know there was a lot

3437
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
of shame that came with that and he left Nintendo

3438
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
but they say that he had always

3439
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
planned to leave Nintendo at a certain age

3440
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
Virtual Boy was not the reason for that.

3441
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
Well unfortunately in 1997

3442
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
he was in a fender

3443
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
bender accident where he rear

3444
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
ended a truck he got out of the car

3445
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
to inspect the damage because you know the same thing happens

3446
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
here right you take the pictures send the insurance company all that

3447
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
stuff right and the passing car said

3448
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
Yeah I remembered

3449
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
it was something like that. Similar-ish

3450
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
yeah it's very tragic.

3451
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
Yeah and Yokoi I

3452
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
knew it was a Yoke but I didn't remember

3453
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
Yeah

3454
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Alright well

3455
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
I hope I really really hope

3456
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
this story doesn't have a sad ending but

3457
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
you know somebody in

3458
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
the gaming community is missing right now

3459
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
and his name I'm hoping

3460
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
if the internet is doing its job correctly

3461
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
then you all already know this and I'm telling you something

3462
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
obvious but in case you don't know

3463
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
David Dredger is currently missing

3464
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
and he goes by Knuckles Dawson online

3465
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
he went missing

3466
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
over last weekend

3467
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
so unfortunately it's been about a week now

3468
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
and he was missing in the Vancouver area

3469
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
his bike and helmet were

3470
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
found in Stanley Park

3471
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
but before he left he closed his Twitter account

3472
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
his Xbox Live account

3473
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
reportedly he left his wallet, computer

3474
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
and phone at home

3475
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
and there's really just

3476
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
not a lot of information unfortunately

3477
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
they have been assembling groups in Vancouver

3478
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
to try and find him

3479
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
unfortunately no luck yet

3480
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
I think they were going to search the

3481
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
waters area next

3482
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
I mean don't know he could have

3483
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
leave the country somehow

3484
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
essentially and who knows

3485
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
where he could have gone

3486
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
hopefully he is safe and sound

3487
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
somewhere

3488
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
for whatever reason

3489
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
just got away

3490
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
but I highly doubt

3491
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
he would be listening to this podcast

3492
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
but if by some strange

3493
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
string of luck he was

3494
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
a lot of folks miss you dude

3495
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
please

3496
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
call your family

3497
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
a lot of people are out looking for this guy

3498
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
and they really miss him

3499
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
so if you are in the Vancouver area

3500
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
even I would say honestly

3501
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
if you are in the Pacific Northwest

3502
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
honestly he could be anywhere at this point

3503
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
it's not that hard to get on a plane

3504
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
go somewhere else

3505
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
or get in a car and go somewhere

3506
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
he could be in the US who knows

3507
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
findknuckles.com is the place to go

3508
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
findknuckles.com

3509
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
this guy by the way you might have seen

3510
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
his work in the gaming community before

3511
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
he was pretty well known because he got

3512
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
the one achievement a day on the 360

3513
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
for like he did something like 3 years

3514
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
so he was really big in the Xbox achievements community

3515
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
and I know I heard his name before

3516
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
he was working with other indie podcasts

3517
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
I know he did stuff with Rooster Teeth

3518
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
so

3519
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
I hope they find him

3520
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
and I hope all is well

3521
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
ok that was two

3522
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
really horrible stories back to back

3523
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
I'm sorry we have to end on that note

3524
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
but we want to do our due diligence

3525
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
I could find some puppies and kittens

3526
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
we need like a kitten playing video

3527
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
play the baby monkey writing backwards on a pig

3528
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
song

3529
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
ok hold on

3530
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
it's literally called baby monkey writing backwards on a pig

3531
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
this will make us feel a little better

3532
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
that will make us feel better

3533
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
yes it will

3534
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
baby monkey

3535
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
baby monkey

3536
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
we use this song and sing to Midna

3537
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
we make up our own lyrics about Midna

3538
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
baby monkey

3539
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
baby monkey

3540
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
I do feel a little better

3541
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000

or our username on skype orange

3550
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
lounge radio

3551
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
meanwhile we will get to twitter topics

3552
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
I've got to pull those up. Loki do we have any last minute news

3553
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
while we're working on that?

3554
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
there's a kickstarter for some sort of

3555
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
vest

3556
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
haptic device or something

3557
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
that they're trying to get off the ground

3558
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
it's supposed to be the as close as it gets

3559
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
kickstarter and it's

3560
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
like this thing that's supposed to tie in with first person shooters

3561
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
and stuff like that to make it more immersive

3562
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
where you actually feel like the

3563
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
you know bullets are hitting you

3564
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
and stuff it's weird though they had

3565
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
that's a little creepy just saying

3566
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
they had something like that before it had like a

3567
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
bass speaker almost built

3568
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
into it I want to say I forgot what they

3569
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
called it but it was

3570
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
I think it was tied into

3571
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
either your audio

3572
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
or maybe like the

3573
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
rumble on your controller

3574
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
or something like that for like the playstation 2 and

3575
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
xbox it's probably audio

3576
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
if it's going to be tying in with that stuff but

3577
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
they had that

3578
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
yeah they're looking to get $900,000

3579
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
to create that thing

3580
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
alright let's go to the phones we're getting some calls

3581
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
so let's go to it hi you're on orange tones radio who's this

3587
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
oh that

3588
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
makes me feel better it's a kitty

3589
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
put it back on the cat

3590
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
I don't want to see you I want to see the cat

3591
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
thank you much better

3592
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
what's kitty's name

3593
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
Anakin Rorschach

3594
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
oh that's a good name alright

3595
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
hopefully that will be better than the Anakin

3596
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
that was in episodes 1 through 3 what's on your mind tonight

3597
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
not a whole lot

3598
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
just

3599
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
kind of a generic

3600
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
question for tonight

3601
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
is there

3602
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
any upcoming

3603
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
games that have been announced

3604
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
that you're possibly looking for

3605
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
or forwards to

3606
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
and not only that

3607
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
but it's a secondary question

3608
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
if you have

3609
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
like a wish list

3610
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
or something that you would love

3611
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
to see on steam

3612
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
like if it was

3613
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
you see on steam right now

3614
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
you want to throw down money

3615
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
for that game and say buy it

3616
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
like anything

3617
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
or are you talking about ports from consoles

3618
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
or something like that

3619
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
either or whatever direction

3620
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
you would like to take the question

3621
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
well I would point you to the OLR dream

3622
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
games page on the OLR wiki

3623
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
because things like what they

3624
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
play dot com snap those still have not

3625
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
come to fruition and I think we'd like to see

3626
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
some of those but on a serious

3627
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
note things that are on console

3628
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
that I would like to see on steam

3629
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
I think it would be nice if maybe some things

3630
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
that are already out on PC would get

3631
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
integrated into steam a little more like

3632
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
you know I loves me some World of Warcraft

3633
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
might be kind of fun to integrate that and I could

3634
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
talk you know but Blizzard wants to do their

3635
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
own thing with battle net so I understand why that doesn't

3636
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
happen so

3637
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
but as far as like console things

3638
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
on steam I could be a total

3639
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
fanboy and say like Mario which

3640
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
also wouldn't happen but then again

3641
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
on the keyboard it wouldn't be the same experience

3642
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
so I don't know I'd have to

3643
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
think about that one you guys anything that jumps

3644
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
to your mind we'll come back to your other question though anything

3645
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
that jumps to your mind something that isn't on steam that ought

3646
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
to be

3647
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
yeah there's so many things

3648
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
that I can come up with

3649
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
too many to list and especially in this

3650
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
show well let me check in with

3651
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
Dark Soccer and Loki I want SNES collections

3652
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
SNES collections like Genesis

3653
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
collections exactly why not no

3654
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
even better TurboGrafx

3655
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
I want the revamped Dracula

3656
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
X alien crush HD

3657
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
oh my god right that would be our dev

3658
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
no I want to see the whole crush series

3659
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
like up through Jackie crush okay

3660
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
all right Loki Minecraft

3661
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
you just want Minecraft in

3662
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
steam make sense it'd be cool I run my

3663
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
Minecraft through steam I guess

3664
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
you can be done all right

3665
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
let's let's get to the meteor question that rage nator

3666
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
asks what are you personally looking forward to

3667
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
this year if anything let me guess

3668
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
Loki Saints Row 4 Grand Theft Auto 5

3669
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
oh and oh

3670
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
yeah come on yes both

3671
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
is that it

3672
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
and Earth Defense Force 2025

3673
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
okay and the new Call of Duty

3674
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
um for me the

3675
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
Kingdom Hearts 1.5 remix is something

3676
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
I'm definitely looking forward to Final Fantasy 14

3677
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
Realm Reborn so I know I'm sounding like a

3678
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
total Square Enix fanboy but it is

3679
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
what it is Disney Infinity

3680
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
although I'm totally expecting that game

3681
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
to be a flop that whole collectible

3682
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
figurine thing I have to admit

3683
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
I'm like if I'm gonna get into a Skylanders

3684
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
game it's gonna be this one you know

3685
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
I'm cautiously optimistic I actually do have to tell

3686
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
you something Julian does not have

3687
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
any Skylanders games but he has toys

3688
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
that he plays with

3689
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
there are people that collect Disney

3690
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
commemorative plates they will

3691
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
buy this game people will buy this game

3692
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
it's not gonna it's not gonna

3693
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
matter it's not gonna flop uh I'm

3694
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
still holding hope that Phantasy Star Online 2

3695
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
will make it out this year at some point although

3696
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
I'm losing hope but we'll see E3 is kinda the

3697
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
make or break for that um

3698
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
I kinda wanna see the South Park

3699
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
Stick of Truth game too

3700
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
the toilet humor potty

3701
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
humor guy in me wants to see that uh

3702
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
Pokemon X and Y believe it or not I'm

3703
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000
loving what it looks like the revamp battle system

3704
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
is gonna be or not system but the graphics

3705
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
and everything and how they're making everything 3D

3706
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
it looks it looks really cool I don't

3707
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
usually get into the Pokemon games quite as much as

3708
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
other people I know like Shane but

3709
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
uh if there's gonna be one that's gonna win

3710
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
me over it'll probably be X and Y

3711
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
how about you Spazinator

3712
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
what do you want this year what can't you wait for?

3713
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
uh well stuff

3714
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
that would probably run on my

3715
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
uh uh KPS

3716
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
computer probably

3717
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
Magic 2014

3718
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
of course

3719
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
yeah well

3720
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
that's probably one of the few upcoming

3721
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
games that will run on my

3722
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
computer for sure

3723
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
some of the other stuff like

3724
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
GTA 5 I know for games

3725
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
sure it won't run on my computer

3726
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
uh if I were to go replace

3727
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
my consoles I may go get

3728
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
that but

3729
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
it's not really within my budget right now

3730
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
but uh

3731
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
the short answer is just the next

3732
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
Magic the gallery so

3733
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
fair enough you know what there's sometimes those reliable

3734
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
series and we're always waiting for the next entry in them

3735
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000

3740
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000

of twitter topics tonight but I will read this one

3748
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
from Tigerclaw because this does look interesting

3749
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
I didn't know about this uh that

3750
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
Tigerclaw tweets us the Tetris creator

3751
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
Alexey Pajitnov

3752
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
I totally said that wrong I haven't heard that guy's

3753
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
name in a long time but uh he created

3754
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
Tetris and he came out with a new

3755
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
mobile phone game this is where

3756
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
everybody's going IOS it's a

3757
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
IOS game called Marbly

3758
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
it's the first title he's ever designed

3759
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
exclusively for a mobile device

3760
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
and that you play with colored balls

3761
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
hence the name Marbly

3762
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000

02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000

I know well you've heard

3776
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
how many times the stream has gone down tonight

3777
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
we can't afford the upload who is

3778
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
this for the listeners

3779
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
this is Ospher hi Ospher how you doing

3780
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
pretty good

3781
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
you mentioned earlier about how you were really

3782
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
getting into the Wii U Virtual Console

3783
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
and earlier this week

3784
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
I took advantage of that deal that

3785
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
what is that like 32 cents

3786
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
Super Metroid or whatever

3787
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
if you live in a state that taxes those online

3788
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
purchases yes 32 cents but

3789
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
somehow in California we get away with

3790
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
a measly 30 cents for Super Metroid

3791
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
dang

3792
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
holy crap I know I saved two

3793
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
cents

3794
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
I uh

3795
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
I also went I got a

3796
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
Mega Man X because

3797
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
I don't know like a lot of people

3798
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
seem to really be into the series I've never

3799
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
played Mega Man X before but I've played like

3800
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
you poor thing now's a

3801
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
great time to catch up

3802
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
yeah it seems pretty good

3803
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
like I'm pretty bad at Mega Man

3804
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
games in general too but like had a little fun

3805
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
thing I like the dashing and stuff like that

3806
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
well a lot of Mega Man games

3807
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
are really freaking hard too

3808
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
so it's you know you say I'm not that good

3809
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
at Mega Man games nobody is

3810
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
that good at Mega Man games but you learn

3811
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
you learn you get better at them

3812
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
yeah I was actually really mad earlier because I was

3813
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
like fighting some mini boss

3814
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
against I can't remember the robot

3815
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
names like some electrical guy and

3816
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
I couldn't even beat the freaking mini boss like I was

3817
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
like getting so angry and then I

3818
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
fight the actual boss I'm like wow that was the easiest thing

3819
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
I've ever done

3820
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
what did you think of Super Metroid?

3821
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
um well I actually own it on

3822
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
Super Nintendo so I've played it before

3823
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
yeah yeah there you go

3824
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
but you're very

3825
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
you're very well thought out

3826
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
and it being your favorite game ever because it is

3827
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
pretty amazing

3828
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
that is the right answer sir

3829
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
I will side with you in your whole

3830
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
Chrono Trigger debate that I think Super Metroid

3831
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
is a far better game than Chrono Trigger

3832
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
oh it's comparing

3833
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
apples and oranges though I don't care how many

3834
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
times you have five to cite tonight you get a gold

3835
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
star for that comment

3836
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
if you're comparing RPGs

3837
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
Chrono Trigger is up at the top next to

3838
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
Final Fantasy 6 but

3839
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
action games

3840
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
okay okay Jamie in the

3841
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
RPG department I will say that I

3842
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
like Chrono Cross better than Chrono Trigger

3843
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
but if we're sticking to just SNES

3844
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
just SNES?

3845
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
Final Fantasy 6 vs Chrono Trigger

3846
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
I think is the great SNES debate

3847
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
okay well for me then that would be

3848
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
Super Mario RPG

3849
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
good answer actually good answer

3850
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
fair answer fair answer

3851
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
also you mentioned um this shirt

3852
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
earlier yes you can tell because

3853
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
it's like backwards but it's the Symphony of the

3854
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
Goddesses shirt it's not backwards on our end

3855
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
it's not backwards on our end I guess the camera flips

3856
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
properly yeah that's weird yeah we see it

3857
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
yeah on my

3858
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
end it is backwards so I'm like

3859
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
I don't know that's weird that's weird

3860
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
but have you guys made it out to see Symphony

3861
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
of the Goddesses yet? no but I want

3862
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
to but you know what I said earlier about

3863
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
a lot of stuff going on

3864
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
yeah I think um

3865
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
I was at Sunshine

3866
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
I think you mentioned something about it coming back

3867
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
to California soon I believe I

3868
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
heard it's going to be in Oakland or somewhere

3869
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
in the East Bay soon and

3870
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
I honestly think it was

3871
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
like early June it's probably

3872
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000

3901
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
and we're not those kind of people

3902
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
everybody's and until we totally are

3903
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
everybody's beautiful in their own unique way

3904
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
everybody's beautiful

3905
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
was that was who was that that was

3906
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
ray stevens wasn't it was it I think so

3907
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
I don't know you know it's funny I told

3908
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
when I was on the way back uh to

3909
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
gulf port to get on the plane I

3910
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
texted dan from pascagoula

3911
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
so he asked if there were squirrels going berserk

3912
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
cause that was another ray steven song

3913
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
you guys are such

3914
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
nerds so alright

3915
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
let's go to another call

3916
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this

3917
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
this is the legend of zaku here

3918
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
three video calls in a row

3919
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
look at that what's up zaku

3920
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
uh nothing much just trying to

3921
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
stay dry high and dry right now

3922
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
with all this thunder outside

3923
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
I heard it's raining out there on the east coast

3924
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
oh cause that's probably all the unfortunate

3925
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
tornado weather that was in the midwest probably making

3926
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
its way over there right is that yeah I've already

3927
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
heard a few rumbles ugh

3928
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
which by the way I hope

3929
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
everybody's I know code man lives

3930
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
in oklahoma so I checked in with him earlier in the week

3931
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
I don't know I don't know who else of our listenership

3932
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
is in that area affected by the tornadoes but

3933
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
I hope y'all are okay I hope your stuff's hooked

3934
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
up to surge protectors too well code man

3935
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
was on oh my god he's got a shirt I want

3936
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
I freaking love

3937
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
dream theater oh my god

3938
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
dream theater's

3939
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
freaking awesome

3940
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
alright zaku I surely you

3941
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
did not just call in tonight to get complimented by

3942
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
dark soccer although I wouldn't blame you if you did

3943
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
what's on your mind tonight

3944
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
well I guess well

3945
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
to put it bluntly

3946
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
I think we're approaching

3947
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
the next video game crash

3948
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
now call me cynical

3949
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
but if you look at the rumblings

3950
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
of how microsoft

3951
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
uh announced to the world

3952
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
about the xbox one how

3953
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
they're basically

3954
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
you can't you're not getting a straight answer

3955
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
from them regarding used games

3956
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
it's contradicting each answer is contradicting

3957
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
one another kind of like

3958
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
the like heisenberg's

3959
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
rule of uncertainty

3960
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
it's uncertainty principle where if you study

3961
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
something long enough

3962
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
it's properties change

3963
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
dynamically

3964
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
so it keeps shifting around

3965
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
so there's no in other words

3966
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
you're still left with

3967
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
so many unopened questions and

3968
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
and it's getting to the

3969
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
point where we don't own things

3970
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
anymore it's kind of like the steam

3971
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
model being pigeonholed

3972
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
into the console

3973
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
even though it's not

3974
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
the appropriate medium

3975
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
wait do you blame steam for

3976
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
what xbox let's say worst

3977
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
case scenario is true with xbox one

3978
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
do you blame steam for that do you think

3979
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
that everybody's looking at steam going

3980
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
well they get away with digital downloads

3981
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
well I mean it's expected

3982
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
that a console which

3983
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
for lack of a better

3984
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
word it's just like you know

3985
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
it's a dumb computer it only

3986
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
does certain functions

3987
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
yeah but you know what it does great is connect

3988
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
to online games right Loki that's

3989
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
one thing it does very well

3990
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
yeah anyway sorry

3991
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
well okay

3992
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
but I mean it's like

3993
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
it's expected that all the

3994
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
media for a video named

3995
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
console is physical

3996
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
it's like it's tangible even

3997
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
though they do exist

3998
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
as game downloads

3999
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
and that's already accepted

4000
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
and you know as

4001
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
a standard where you only own

4002
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
the license to that particular

4003
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
digital copy

4004
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
but if you buy something tangible

4005
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
wouldn't you expect that the first

4006
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
sale doctrine would apply to it

4007
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
but I'm thinking Microsoft

4008
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
is thinking about a little

4009
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
decision where the folks

4010
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
from Autodesk

4011
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
come in

4012
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
Zaku stop talking

4013
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
alright I gotta ask you this

4014
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
because I wanna play devil's

4015
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
advocate and this is important because you say that

4016
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
you know we expect something tangible

4017
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
I'm not gonna disagree with you I like

4018
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
having the tangibleness I've been very

4019
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
disappointed that manuals are going away

4020
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
and instead we're eating these inserts

4021
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
these inserts that say go to our website

4022
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
like that really ticks me off

4023
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
but hold on devil's advocate

4024
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
is that at one point in this industry

4025
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
it was cartridges, cartridges

4026
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
cartridges, Atari 26 cartridges, NES

4027
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
cartridges, Super NES cartridges and then all of a

4028
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
sudden disc and there were some people

4029
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
that would say cartridges for life

4030
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
and Nintendo was one of those people and they paid

4031
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
for it on the N64

4032
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
yes that is true however even

4033
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
with the disc era starting with playstation

4034
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
you know and anything

4035
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
slightly earlier than that

4036
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
you're able to lend it out

4037
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
to anybody, to your friends

4038
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
now all of a sudden Microsoft wants

4039
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
to impose like you know paying for that game

4040
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
all over again I mean

4041
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
when you buy something you're

4042
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
presuming it's pretty

4043
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
much common presumption that

4044
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
you pretty much own

4045
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
it you're able to do what you want

4046
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
to lend it out but

4047
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
in this case for the Xbox One

4048
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
it's a much tighter grip

4049
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
it's equity, it's equity on what

4050
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
you value

4051
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
like this huge wall of

4052
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
DVDs I'll never watch they at least have

4053
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
equity I could get 50 cents at

4054
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
a dimple or something

4055
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
which is a local chain that buys

4056
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
these things

4057
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
compared to those discs it's like a house

4058
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
you buy a house and then you sell it

4059
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
for hopefully more money later on it's like a car

4060
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
you buy it and then hopefully you can sell it

4061
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
later on and I know a lot of people are saying

4062
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
a video game is different than a car but

4063
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
until now our games

4064
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
have had equity and now

4065
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
we're saying we might lose that and that is

4066
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
not good when you're asking me to pay

4067
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
$60 for a game that will be

4068
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
worth zero when I try to resell it

4069
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
more importantly it's

4070
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
collusion between not only the

4071
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
game developers

4072
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
the manufacturers

4073
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
they're colluding with GameStop

4074
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
to find a way

4075
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
like maybe

4076
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
well I mean from what I'm hearing

4077
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
it's you have to

4078
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
it's rumor

4079
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
it's an exchange so to speak

4080
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
it's almost similar to how the Yankees

4081
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
basically opted out of

4082
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
StubHub to create their own ticket exchange

4083
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
because up until

4084
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
last year me and my girl were able to get

4085
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
like you know

4086
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
home tickets for really good

4087
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
seats at below face value

4088
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
and I think this is what's happening

4089
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
they're taking the same

4090
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
approach where they want to cut out any other middle

4091
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
man and basically set

4092
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
their own terms and set their own

4093
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
prices for certain games

4094
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
holy crap I just saw lightning in the background

4095
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
that was crazy did you guys see that?

4096
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
like totally flashed in his window there

4097
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
sorry

4098
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
this is why we don't do a video show

4099
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
I get too distracted there's something shiny

4100
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
behind you there's something shiny

4101
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
okay look Zaku I gotta wrap

4102
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
this up for time but I do want to say this about the

4103
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
video game crash I do feel like

4104
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
sometimes as cynical gamers

4105
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
we do sit here with every console generation

4106
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
and go the game crash the game crash the game crash

4107
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
I don't think the video game industry is going to

4108
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
crash necessarily

4109
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
but hold on

4110
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
I feel there is a very real possibility

4111
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
that both the PlayStation 4

4112
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
and the Xbox One

4113
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
and hell the Wii U as well there's a very

4114
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
real possibility all three of them

4115
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
fail and they could call that

4116
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
a video game crash but you know who the winner

4117
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
is in that situation the current generation

4118
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
because people still have those

4119
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
consoles

4120
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
well yeah that too and then mobile which

4121
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
never had those which those nations were

4122
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
were never a

4123
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
a mood point to begin with I mean

4124
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
there were never an issue to begin

4125
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
with I mean all digital

4126
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
everything on mobile is pretty much

4127
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
digital so it's

4128
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
the same rules that apply to PC

4129
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
and you

4130
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
know if it turns out that

4131
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
Sony is basically pulling the same tricks

4132
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
as Microsoft and

4133
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
God help them if they find

4134
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
a way to spin it really well better than

4135
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
what Microsoft was able to then

4136
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
yeah there might be a crash

4137
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
long overdue it might even happen

4138
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
a lot sooner if they flop

4139
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
at the end of the year or early next

4140
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
yeah people will still clutch

4141
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
to their existing 360s

4142
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
and PS3s like myself

4143
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
I hope it's not an all out

4144
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
crash because I know a lot of people in the industry

4145
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
that would be affected

4146
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
as I said it might not

4147
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
I may have exaggerated when saying

4148
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
crash without like adding context and scope

4149
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
it will be a crash

4150
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
with like traditional consoles

4151
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
mobile and any other casual

4152
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
aspects of gaming will

4153
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
be unscathed

4154
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
because they appeal to a broader audience

4155
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
alright

4156
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
Zaku I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show

4157
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
but thank you for your opinion take care

4158
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
bye you too

4159
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
don't get hit by lightning

4160
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
I love when we get like really

4161
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
in depth discussion like that though

4162
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
yeah Zaku doesn't you know

4163
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
love Zaku or hate him when he gets on his

4164
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
train where he won't let me talk

4165
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
but he's very passionate

4166
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
and I love that I love all your guys' passion

4167
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
that's what this show is all about all you guys

4168
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
and I love Utada Hikaru's passion

4169
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
I do it's a good song

4170
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000

02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000

E3 show that is the week to lock in

4175
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
our predictions and guess what guys

4176
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000

4177
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
to bring back listless and the thing we

4178
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
most want to happen want to see happen

4179
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000

we'll be back one week from tonight to do

4181

4182
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
end tonight's show

4183
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
I just wanted to let you know that there was a mention of a

4184
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
very old joke when I was hanging out with

4185
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
Jammer Jay oh god

4186
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
Pantsless Rage of course of course alright look

4187
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
Loki any other last minute stories before

4188
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
we wrap it up and say print

4189
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
yeah Shadow Warrior you remember it's

4190
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
being remade well the classic is available

4191
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
free on Steam forever

4192
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
so go play it and then finally

4193
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
the Super Mario Brothers movie

4194
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
has celebrated its 20th

4195
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
anniversary

4196
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
so that's it

4197
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
alright

4198
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
oh and one other thing

4199
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
one other thing that Steam does better than

4200
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
you know the Xbox One

4201
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
the Alan Wake series on

4202
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
the Xbox 360

4203
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
right now is $20

4204
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
$4 on Steam

4205
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
that's why people don't mind DRM

4206
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
you can get a series of games for

4207
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
$4 or the Humble Bundle where you can get

4208
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
the entire franchise

4209
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
like 20 games

4210
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
for 5 bucks

4211
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
alright

4212
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000

now we can go around and get everybody's final thought

4260
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000

02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
I'll start is that it's time to check

02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000

4263
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
Loki, your final thought tonight

4264
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
AC's not working, boo

4265
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
the AC's working here

4266
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
in my house, boo

4267
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
oh, you want to stay here tonight?

4268
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
no, not working well I guess

4269
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
oh, that's still terrible

4270
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
well if the little one gets too warm you and Nellie are welcome to bring him over

4271
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
to my house, it's not gonna be that hot tonight

4272
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
where Midna will nibble his toes

4273
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
get that thing fixed before it gets really bad

4274
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
be thankful you're not going to Phoenix

4275
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
tomorrow then in that case

4276
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
Dark Saga, your final thought tonight

4277
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
I have done two feet

4278
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
and am attaching the major parts of the body

4279
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
of my scale mate

4280
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
and when I am done with him

4281
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
hopefully, because I never sleep so it might be tonight

4282
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
I will post pictures up

4283
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
are they happy feet?

4284
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
they're kind of deflated

4285
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
because they have no stuffing

4286
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
but I could put them on my fingers

4287
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
and pretend they're real feet

4288
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
see, look, real feet

4289
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
you need a little picture of that for

4290
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
I am scale mate feet

4291
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
I think I am going to name my scale mate

4292
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
sir no stuffing

4293
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
or something

4294
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
alright, I'll name him Stouffer

4295
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
ok, that's it, we're done

4296
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
we're out of here, thank you guys very much for tuning in

4297
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
again, if you like the show, please help spread the word

4298
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
we're an indie show, we don't have big money to be

4299
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
selling ads, we don't have the type of

4300
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
listener base that's going to give us a quarter of a million dollars

4301
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
on Kickstarter, all we have is word of mouth

4302
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
and we appreciate it, have a wonderful night everybody

4303
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
see you next week for pre

4304
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
