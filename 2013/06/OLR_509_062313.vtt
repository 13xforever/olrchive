Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:21.000
Tonight, June 23, 2013, a firmware update on PlayStation 3 bricks some consoles. Saints Row IV will embrace modding.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
And could a Final Fantasy XII remake be in the works?

00:24.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.000 --> 00:45.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 509 for this June the 23rd of 2013.

00:45.000 --> 00:53.000
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as she has for the past 11 years to the day, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
And that's how you feel about the past 11 years, all summed up, right?

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
No, I'm very happy about making 11 years. I just am on the tail end.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
It just wouldn't be an episode of OLR if you weren't-

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
If I hadn't been sick all week.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
If you hadn't been sick all week, alright.

01:09.000 --> 01:14.000
I have no idea what's up, but whatever this flu thing is can bite my ass. Actually, it bit my ass.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
That's the problem, is it bit your ass a little too hard?

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Well, it can stop.

01:20.000 --> 01:27.000
Alright, also say hello, also joining us every week for the past 11 years, probably a better attendance record than both myself and DarkSakura.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Say hello to Loki.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Hi.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
How are you doing, Techmaster Loki?

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
I'm doing alright.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
I heard you took up a new programming language in the past couple of weeks.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
I've just been learning C++.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Yeah?

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
And-

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
You're programming in French.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
And, you know, it feels like it sometimes, I swear.

01:42.000 --> 01:51.000
It's like, like I had the- there was- I've been picking up pretty fast. I think I started like on Tuesday, maybe? Or I think it was this week.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
Yeah, it was like on Tuesday.

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
And I've already gone through most of this first book.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
I'm now in the object-oriented stuff.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
And then they're gonna start, I think- I'm trying to think what's left.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
There's polymorphism, which I have no fucking clue what that means.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
And Windows programming, because right now it's all console window stuff.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
You know, DOS, if you will.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
And then very simple things.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
Although I've made a lot of gambling games, because that's a lot of the-

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
I was gonna say, what's the goal with this?

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
Are you trying to make an OLR dream game into reality in a few years?

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
I'm just trying to learn how to program games.

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
Yeah, well, mainly I want to work in Unity, and you know, it's good to know programming stuff.

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
I think it's healthy, because when you sit here and you bitch about games every week for the past 11 years,

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
it's good for you to feel the pain a little bit about what it goes in to make some games.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
Well, yeah, I just wanted to have like some sort of a language.

02:47.000 --> 02:54.000
Just to get the basics so that I can learn other languages if I want to learn like Java or something like that.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
You can take a lot what you learn and apply it to others.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
I find source code for games fascinating.

03:02.000 --> 03:08.000
Just randomly today I was on the internet, and I was looking up old Atari 2600 games,

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
and there was one in particular that I remember from back in the day.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Of course, now I'm gonna forget the name. I think it was called Dragonfire.

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
It was a game that had like two screens, and in one you were running across the castle bridge,

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
and you were trying to dodge fireballs, and you would get into the room with the dragon.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
You had to pick up all the chalices and everything in the room and get to the door.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
Hopefully somebody out there knows what I'm talking about, so I don't sound like I'm smoking crack.

03:28.000 --> 03:34.000
This is an Atari 2600 game. My point is, the source code is out there for you to download and look at,

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
and it's all commented, so you can see exactly what it went into making those games.

03:38.000 --> 03:43.000
It's like, man, programming for the Atari 2600 was a bitch because...

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
It's all assembly, yeah.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
Well, yeah, and you had like no space. Those cartridges.

03:47.000 --> 03:53.000
The beginning Atari 2600 cartridges were 4K. 4K? It's 4,000 characters.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
Yeah, that's not a lot.

03:55.000 --> 04:00.000
Yeah, yeah, that's part of the reason that Pac-Man sucks so bad,

04:00.000 --> 04:06.000
but we'll leave that for another time because there's too much in gaming this week to talk about Atari 2600.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
But I do want to introduce, here in our studio, welcome back.

04:09.000 --> 04:14.000
It's been exactly one year since he was last at the show.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
Say hello, everybody, to JV Mon is here tonight.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Hello.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Hey, how you doing?

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Doing all right, just staring at these peanut butter brownies.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Yeah, we're having a hard time hearing.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
You should have another.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Can you hear me now?

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
Yes, a little bit.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
You're still kind of quiet, but I think that's just the mic over there is a little weird.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
It's the peanut butter brownies stealing my voice.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
Yes, here in studio tonight we have peanut butter brownies, which were baked from Becky, right?

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
Yes, Becky says happy 11th, and she is going to a movie with her mother tonight.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
Tell Becky that I love her and I hate her all at the same time.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
I will. She's such a bitch.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
I love her for these brownies. I hate her for these brownies.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Mostly love.

04:51.000 --> 04:58.000
I told her that it's basically her contribution for not being here is that she's going to basically make everybody fatties.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
She made two pans, by the way, so she's got some herself.

05:02.000 --> 05:11.000
It's also worth noting that JV Mon brought to the show a nice bottle of Silver Patron for us to consume.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
So now I can combine worlds a little bit because you were telling me before the show you have yet to have a fireball shot.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
I've never had fireball whiskey.

05:17.000 --> 05:25.000
So we're going to take, I'm going to get Pod Culture's bottle that he sent us from the repository and then we're going to have some drinks.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
We're going to get drunk.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Yeah.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Girl, we going to drink?

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
We're going to drink.

05:29.000 --> 05:36.000
Quickly, we got to get into gaming news because there's huge news this week and I want to turn it over to Jamie so we can get into that.

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
Because the last few episodes, last few episodes of OLR, we don't have time to fuck around.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
There's too much-

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
We ain't got time for this shit.

05:43.000 --> 05:49.000
Gaming news or gaming weeks and what have we been playing? Nobody cares because we had a console war and it's getting good.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
It's getting real good.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
It's getting classic.

05:52.000 --> 06:01.000
But quickly, JV Mon, since you're here, obviously I want you to comment throughout tonight's show, but you are an indie broadcaster as well, right? Off and on?

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
Off and on when, you know, I actually get around to uploading my podcasts.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
Yeah. And what podcast is it that you do?

06:08.000 --> 06:17.000
I do a mostly Eurobeat based podcast called Super Euro Power Hour, which I don't think, once in the history of the show, I've actually had a show under an hour.

06:17.000 --> 06:22.000
It's more like Super Euro three and a half power hour.

06:22.000 --> 06:27.000
You are still really quiet and I can't figure out why and it's bothering me. So I apologize to the listeners that are like, he's too quiet.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Live radio.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Live radio. I got to adjust things on the fly.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
It's the acoustic absorption properties of the brownies.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
It wouldn't be 11 years of Orange Launch Radio if there weren't technical problems on the fly.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
And people usually say I'm too loud. And it's funny, it's like, they can't hear me.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Actually, now you're good. I think we fixed it.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
All right.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
All right. I had to turn up the gain so they can probably hear me on your mic back here.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
No.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
But it works. All right.

06:50.000 --> 06:59.000
OK. Live listeners at live.vogradio.com. Let us know if you're OK with the sound or if we need to change things on the fly.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
I'm sorry, did you give out the URL while I was adjusting your sound?

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
I did not.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Please do.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
Just search on iTunes, Super Europe Power Hour.

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
I mean, I've been sitting on the last latest episode on my hard drive for like the past month.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
It was recorded like almost two months ago.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
Like, I'm an extreme procrastinator.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
So new episode coming soon.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Eventually.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
Soon is the word we use in the gaming industry. Soon.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Soon. New episode coming soon.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
I mean, it's not like gaming where you got to be first to get the news out there.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
It's just like, it'll be out there when it's out there.

07:33.000 --> 07:38.000
Since you haven't been here in a year, you were here for the 10th anniversary, which was a crazy night all in itself.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
So now you're 11 years.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
That's just another week.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
No one car about 11 years is just another week.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Quickly remind us.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
What's what's you as a gamer?

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
What kind of video games do you play?

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
What do you like? What systems do you own?

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
I own most of them.

07:52.000 --> 07:57.000
I if it comes out, I'll probably buy it.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
I don't have a Vita anymore because I dropped it in a puddle.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
And that's probably the saddest day in my life.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
That's that's wow, son. Wow.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
Yeah, like not even a year and it falls in a puddle.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
And that's probably like the slowest 10 seconds in my life.

08:09.000 --> 08:13.000
Just watching it go in a puddle, submerge, watching it power off.

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
Did it did it have that whole like what you say?

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Did you have a dear sister moment with that?

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
Pretty much like I was like, no.

08:22.000 --> 08:28.000
But yeah, and I'm considering either trying to fix it or buying a new Vita because.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
I'm a consumer horror and I want my game systems.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
Favorite video game of all time?

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
Ooh, Super Mario RPG.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
And why is that?

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
I just love the story and the gameplay.

08:43.000 --> 08:49.000
And that final boss battle as a kid, I remember I just remember renting it from Blockbuster, the cartridge,

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
because my mom was like, you ain't getting a new game.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
So I was like, fine, Blockbuster.

08:52.000 --> 08:59.000
So we would rent it like every week and I would play it during the weekends instead of doing my homework,

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
which, you know, wasn't a very responsible thing to do.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
But hey, I was a kid.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Quickly, I think the listeners would enjoy this.

09:06.000 --> 09:12.000
If you're willing to tell it, you ran out on you're visiting here from New York City, you're visiting family in San Francisco.

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
OLR Studios is only a two hour drive from San Francisco, which by that we appreciate you taking a drive here.

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
But while you're driving here, it took you about four hours to get here.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Why?

09:22.000 --> 09:30.000
Because even though my Wii U is on the west east coast, I had this compulsion to buy Game & Wario.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
Which isn't even getting good reviews.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
So that tells me you're a little bit of a Nintendo fanboy. That's okay.

09:37.000 --> 09:43.000
I do enjoy my Nintendo games, but I think it's just more, I need something new to play on my Wii U.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
And it's like, oh my God, a new game out on the Wii U.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Stars Alive.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
That's fair.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Alright, one more time, the Vita story.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
What happened when it, you just dropped it?

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
Or what happened?

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
I was getting out of my car, I closed my car door, I left that part out.

09:59.000 --> 10:04.000
My Vita just flew out of my pocket into a puddle.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
It's like it's happening all over again.

10:10.000 --> 10:18.000
And as it falls through the water, it just powers down slowly. Longest ten seconds of my life.

10:18.000 --> 10:25.000
It's like the end of Terminator 2, it just sticks to its thumb out and slowly sinking down to the molten metal.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
There is no fate but what we make.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Alright, love it, love it.

10:29.000 --> 10:35.000
Tigerclaw in chat is asking, is that superhero power hour? No, that's super Euro power hour.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Euro, like Eurobeat.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Like Pala Pala.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Alright.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Okay, we gotta get into the news.

10:43.000 --> 10:48.000
JVMom, please, as the show is going on tonight, feel free to comment on your thoughts on what's going on.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
And I'm sure everybody's got something to say about this hot topic.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Dark Sakura, take it away tonight.

10:53.000 --> 10:58.000
In the most professional language I can say, Microsoft done flipped a bitch.

10:58.000 --> 11:05.000
Yeah, basically they put out a big announcement that said, okay, we're not doing all that other stuff, we're doing this instead.

11:06.000 --> 11:11.000
So basically they're not requiring the internet connection to play offline Xbox One games.

11:11.000 --> 11:18.000
Xboner, Xbox 180, the joke that everybody has been saying.

11:18.000 --> 11:25.000
Basically you can trade in your games, resell, gift, rent discs, blah blah, sit on it, take a crap on it, they don't care.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
You can do all of it, it's gonna be physical discs.

11:28.000 --> 11:33.000
So it was sort of like, oh, all that? Oh, we weren't serious, never mind, click.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
So yeah, complete reversal.

11:35.000 --> 11:49.000
I have to admit, I was wrong, well I wasn't wrong, but I was mostly incorrect last week because I said there is no way Microsoft would reverse course that fast.

11:49.000 --> 11:56.000
I said it will take a miracle for Microsoft to win the holiday season at this point, and within three days they parted the Red Sea.

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
Well they rode in on a white horse, like in History of the World.

12:00.000 --> 12:07.000
You know within seconds of those planes getting back to Seattle, Don Mattrick is like, boardroom, now.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Right now, get in that boardroom.

12:11.000 --> 12:17.000
As Don Mattrick said, your feedback matters, investors that have stock in our company.

12:17.000 --> 12:26.000
Oh, consumers, oh fuck them, but yeah, you guys want us to make it so that more people buy our console, so yeah, I guess we better flip this.

12:27.000 --> 12:37.000
Still one thing that's really confusing about the whole thing is that it does require a day one patch to enable this offline mode.

12:37.000 --> 12:44.000
Which begs the question, these consoles aren't even fucking being manufactured yet, why the hell do I need a day one patch?

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
No system comes out without a day one patch.

12:47.000 --> 12:54.000
Because I'm gonna give Microsoft a bit of a doubt here, I think they were so committed to their vision that they had already coded the firmware.

12:54.000 --> 13:00.000
Because you know, firmware don't write itself, you know coding now, firmware don't write itself.

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
Somebody's gonna have to write this new firmware and it's just not gonna be done by the time these consoles press.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
I'm giving them a bit of a doubt there.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Alright, I'll play that.

13:08.000 --> 13:15.000
Then it needs to be on the disk, like it is with games where they have the firmware update on the disk.

13:15.000 --> 13:21.000
That way, just saving you guys some trouble there Microsoft, that way you don't have a situation where,

13:21.000 --> 13:27.000
Oh shit, I don't have internet, I can't fucking play anything because I can't do my day one patch.

13:27.000 --> 13:37.000
Although, granted, they're probably, data is free, disk costs money even if it's a penny a disk, they have to manufacture how many disks?

13:37.000 --> 13:42.000
No, I'm not talking about manufacturing disks, I'm talking about putting it on their game disks.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
Like they're doing with the current gen stuff.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Or you used to be able to download.

13:48.000 --> 13:53.000
Yeah, I understand you can download and burn your own stuff, but once again that requires that you have internet.

13:53.000 --> 13:58.000
So I'm just saying that you put it on the game disk since those disks have not been pressed yet.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.000
And there you go, problem solved.

14:01.000 --> 14:10.000
Since obviously you're gonna have to connect the internet to, or you're gonna have to want to play a game before you can figure out that you can't play a game without that update.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
So putting the disk in the drive should solve the problem.

14:13.000 --> 14:20.000
If they were smart, although they flip flopped on levels of intelligence, so it's hard to say.

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
I don't know, when you talk like that it still sounds like the whole let's kick Microsoft while they're down mentality.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Alright fine, connect is still connected.

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
Okay, now we can have a real conversation. Yes, connect is still connected.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
And it's $100 more.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
We'll get into that later in the show.

14:36.000 --> 14:42.000
As far as the $180 on the DRM is concerned, is this a victory or is this a defeat?

14:42.000 --> 14:49.000
Because I saw a lot of very interesting chatter on Twitter and Facebook as soon as this was announced.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
There was a lot of people that were like, yay.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.000
And I was probably one of those people.

14:52.000 --> 15:01.000
I was like, my biggest problem, my number one problem with the Xbox One was that if I buy a game, I don't have the right to sell it back on my own terms.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
I have to follow Microsoft's predesignated terms.

15:04.000 --> 15:10.000
I didn't really care about the 24 hour thing. The DRM thing didn't bug me nearly as much as that component did.

15:10.000 --> 15:16.000
So the fact that that's not a factor now makes me feel like, okay, I can support Xbox One, I'm good with that.

15:16.000 --> 15:27.000
But there was a lot of people on Twitter and Facebook very hurt about, well, because we're now taking this out, we're going to have to take the quote unquote cool features out with it.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
And the one thing I kept hearing over and over again was family sharing, family sharing.

15:31.000 --> 15:46.000
Which to me, I'm like, what does that mean? Because some people honestly have it in their heads, I think, based on the tweets I saw that family sharing was going to allow you to buy a game and share it with 10 people unconditionally.

15:46.000 --> 15:53.000
And if that is really the way you were thinking, then can I have some of the glue that you're huffing to glue your screws back in?

15:53.000 --> 15:59.000
Because, I'm sorry, that is not a win situation for the publisher or for Microsoft or anybody.

15:59.000 --> 16:09.000
Remember, they're in the business to make money. They're going to, if they're getting rid of used games because they're saying, oh, you know what, used games are really hurting the new game sales.

16:09.000 --> 16:21.000
They're not going to put this thing, okay, we're going to get rid of used games, but we're going to have this method where you can buy one game and you can have two people play at the same time.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
Nope, that is not going to happen without some sort of restrictions.

16:24.000 --> 16:31.000
Raven's Dolphin in chat says, I don't think family sharing was not going to be that great. I heard it was going to be like a one hour demo.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Yeah, I saw that story floating around the internet too.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Anonymous pace spin.

16:34.000 --> 16:41.000
We don't know. We don't know what it was supposed to be. So why are people getting so upset about something we didn't know about that we lost?

16:41.000 --> 16:49.000
It's sort of like people talking up the fantasy of what they want it to be and, you know, how rumors spread. It's like a giant game of telephone.

16:49.000 --> 16:59.000
And they get so excited about what they think that this final thing is going to be without having anything to back it up. So it's like getting excited about Tooth Fairy bringing you a quarter.

16:59.000 --> 17:09.000
I guess people just feel that there's such a loss of potential innovation, even though they don't know what exactly it was. It's like, what was it? I don't know, but it could have been something great.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
It could have been something really terrible.

17:11.000 --> 17:20.000
I'm I can see the whole we want to look forward and not backward. I can kind of follow that to an extent.

17:20.000 --> 17:28.000
But Varian is the real problem with this whole thing, because Microsoft was so good at communicating the negative and so crappy at communicating the positive.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
That's why they lost this battle.

17:30.000 --> 17:35.000
Well, then on top of that, they the whole issue with Kinect having this still be connected to the console.

17:35.000 --> 17:44.000
And I understand why they're doing it so that, you know, it can be assumed that any developer out there is making a game can develop a game that uses a Kinect because the Kinect is going to be there.

17:44.000 --> 17:59.000
Blah, blah, blah. My thing is, though, while they just have it where they assume that it's going to be there and then you don't have to have it connected and you don't have to use it, because obviously a lot of those games that they actually all of those games that they showed during their press conference didn't use Kinect.

17:59.000 --> 18:07.000
Or it was an optional thing. So if this is so integral into their console, why am I not seeing how it's being used?

18:07.000 --> 18:12.000
That's revolutionary, you know, aside from grenade, grenade, reload, grenade, grenade.

18:12.000 --> 18:17.000
To be fair, because most of that revolutionary stuff has nothing to do with the games.

18:17.000 --> 18:28.000
If you want to see where they were showing that off, go back to their earlier press conference at the end of May when they showed the calling people during the TV shows and the fact that everybody has one of those brings people connected.

18:28.000 --> 18:34.000
I'm not saying that's a smart decision, but I'm saying that is the decision. And for me it's not a deal breaker.

18:34.000 --> 18:44.000
But, anyway, I want to read some of these other comments in chat. We got Koopa Kid Jeremy says, some of those cool features could still be implemented.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
Like, why not give the option to gold subscribers? That's kind of where my head's at.

18:48.000 --> 18:59.000
My mindset is, okay, so you lost the battle with the disc-based games. Fine. Disc-based games, the way you know it and love it today, right? Why not have that be the market?

18:59.000 --> 19:06.000
Digitally-based games? Why can't you just have two license types depending on how you bought the game?

19:06.000 --> 19:16.000
I mean, I don't see a lot of advantage to buying games digitally today outside of, all right, well, I get, what, 5, 10% back on the Wii U, right, when I have the deluxe program?

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
You get 10% off on PlayStation Network.

19:19.000 --> 19:32.000
Yeah, you get some of those deals. Okay, so financial incentive, that's good. But what if some of the pluses were, okay, when you buy a game digitally, you can instantly send it to JV Mon in New York City without having to mail the disc to him.

19:32.000 --> 19:39.000
I could just instantly give him the license. That is kind of cool. Why can't I still have that for a digital game?

19:39.000 --> 19:49.000
I'm not really hearing the, why that has to be taken away. I mean, yes, Xbox and Microsoft has to go back to square one to reinvent some of this stuff.

19:49.000 --> 20:01.000
Because there's a lot of, unfortunately, the thing is there's a lot of people that have to give approval to that. You have to get the approval from the publishers, you have to get approval from, you know, well, they have to create the infrastructure for it and stuff.

20:01.000 --> 20:17.000
And it's just, I don't think there's a lot of incentive for them to do that. Whereas, you know, you could do all sorts of crazy stuff on PC and, you know, you get better pricing with Steam and stuff just because there are multiple places that you can buy Steam, you know, licenses and stuff.

20:17.000 --> 20:25.000
And they're all competing with each other for, you know, the lowest prices. Or you can get DRM free or whatever, you know.

20:25.000 --> 20:34.000
Desura, I mean, there's a lot of options available. Whereas, that's why it always bugged me when people are like, well, you know, when they get rid of the used games, it's going to drive the price of games down.

20:34.000 --> 20:44.000
I'm like, no, it's not going to fucking drive the games down because what they've done now is they've even limited the marketplace so much more that you can only, you know, return your games at certain retailers.

20:45.000 --> 20:58.000
So basically, these retailers are going to have an advantage and are they really going to be, you know, wanting to drop the price of their game considering, you know, or the game that they're selling because, you know, you're going to be more likely to go there anyway.

20:58.000 --> 21:03.000
So why bother trying to compete when they're kind of limiting the competition?

21:03.000 --> 21:15.000
I am very curious about where people's heads are at after all this DRM stuff because for me, I'm, you know, I had the whole discussion last week about I'm out, I'm out, I'm not having this.

21:15.000 --> 21:21.000
But now that this is mentioned that they're going to remove this, I'm probably going to get an Xbox One.

21:21.000 --> 21:26.000
I'm not going to get one this holiday season because that's too much. Like, just financially, I can't afford it.

21:26.000 --> 21:35.000
But next year, especially when more of these exclusives are out, by the time Halo 5 is out, I'll get one. I think I'll get an Xbox One now that the DRM thing has worked out.

21:35.000 --> 21:43.000
But that's me. And I'm really curious about you guys. So I want to use this as an excuse to go to a live poll.

21:44.000 --> 21:48.000
So if you go to live.vognetwork.com, there's a poll up right now.

21:48.000 --> 21:52.000
How do you feel about an Xbox One post 180?

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Obviously, how do you feel about it after the flip?

21:54.000 --> 22:00.000
Four answers. I was going to buy one, and I still am. I was going to buy one, but now I'm not.

22:00.000 --> 22:07.000
Maybe, I don't know. I was going to buy one before, or excuse me, I wasn't going to buy one before, but now I am.

22:07.000 --> 22:12.000
And then I'm still not buying it. What's your thoughts on Xbox One right now?

22:12.000 --> 22:18.000
Live.vognetwork.com if you're a registered VOG Network participant. We'll read the answers here momentarily.

22:18.000 --> 22:23.000
Jamie, I was going to ask where your head's at with this. You read us the story, but you didn't tell me where your head's at after it.

22:23.000 --> 22:33.000
I still don't care enough about the Xbox One to get one. Dan and I were pretty much already decided on the PS4 because it's an upgraded Blu-ray player.

22:33.000 --> 22:42.000
And keep in mind, our PS3 is a release model. So it's been surviving for a very, very long time.

22:42.000 --> 22:47.000
And we don't know when it's going to go. So yeah, we had already decided on the PS4.

22:48.000 --> 22:54.000
And I think that this is too little, too late. There's still a lot of unknowns. They haven't clarified anything.

22:54.000 --> 22:59.000
And I don't really care about the Kinect. I really don't. I don't really care about Move.

22:59.000 --> 23:08.000
But at least I have an option of not having to buy Move. I would rather just not deal with it.

23:09.000 --> 23:19.000
All right. We'll read the answers momentarily. The Xbox One exclusives were good enough for me that I'm very interested in checking it out.

23:19.000 --> 23:25.000
And still, as we learned this week, a lot can change still between now and the day this thing launches.

23:25.000 --> 23:35.000
I'm not saying they're necessarily going to go back on the Kinect policy and all that, but it is not without reason that Microsoft couldn't say,

23:35.000 --> 23:41.000
hey, we're going to do the subsidized console. We're going to put out our console for $299 with the two-year gold subscription.

23:41.000 --> 23:48.000
I mean, there's still more ammo that Microsoft could throw at this thing that, you know, I don't know if we've seen the last of this just yet.

23:48.000 --> 23:56.000
But we'll see. Any other comments on the Xbox DRM reversal situation? Anybody? All right.

23:56.000 --> 24:02.000
The whole removal of features, it seems like, it was like, fine, you want it this way. We're just going to take our ball of special features and go home with it.

24:02.000 --> 24:08.000
It seemed like kind of like a dick move that they probably could have just kept in there. What was the ball? What was it?

24:08.000 --> 24:19.000
It was the potential. I brought you a present. But now that you don't want to do things my way, you're never going to find out what the present was.

24:19.000 --> 24:27.000
I did like how they fed into like the whole like, oh, you guys, we heard your feedback and we're doing what's good for you.

24:27.000 --> 24:33.000
Yes, I'm glad you're concerned about what's good for me now, three days later after your console sucked.

24:33.000 --> 24:38.000
As funny as this conversation all is, though, for real, everybody was fucking pissed about it.

24:38.000 --> 24:43.000
Sony got a standing ovation when they got there and they got to even interject negatives.

24:43.000 --> 24:47.000
Sony got away with saying, we're going to charge you to play multiplayer.

24:47.000 --> 24:56.000
The number one reason our fanboys love us more, I mean not the number one, but one of the big things fanboys love to hold over Microsoft fanboys heads is that you can play multiplayer.

24:56.000 --> 25:00.000
You can play multiplayer free. We are going to start charging for that and nobody cares.

25:00.000 --> 25:04.000
We're getting standing ovations because we went against Microsoft's policies.

25:04.000 --> 25:10.000
And now that Microsoft switched those policies to be the same thing, I still feel like a lot of people are like, yeah, fuck them.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
It doesn't matter.

25:12.000 --> 25:17.000
Still charging less and and home still offered some more fun than Gold did.

25:17.000 --> 25:23.000
Well, the perception is, too, that, you know, you have Sony who did the right thing the first time.

25:23.000 --> 25:27.000
Now, whether we know whether they changed the decision last minute, who knows.

25:27.000 --> 25:32.000
But OK, so the perception is that they made the right choice the first time.

25:32.000 --> 25:42.000
Then you have Microsoft that made the wrong choice in everybody's eyes and then kind of recanted on that because they they value what the consumer wants.

25:42.000 --> 25:52.000
So, I mean, the problem that I have there is either, A, they didn't value what the consumer wants and they were going to do their own damn thing or B, they really didn't know what the consumer wanted.

25:52.000 --> 25:58.000
And now they do all of a sudden. I mean, are they really out of touch or they just don't give a shit?

25:58.000 --> 26:06.000
So I can't really I don't know. I don't really want to get an Xbox One right now.

26:06.000 --> 26:12.000
And the reason and I love the controller and it looks like fun, but I just can't support that kind of thing.

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
And I'm sorry that, you know, OK, so you went back on it.

26:15.000 --> 26:21.000
You know, that's kind of like if I called Jamie a giant bitch and then said, sorry, just kidding.

26:21.000 --> 26:27.000
I didn't really mean that. It's still hurtful in the beginning. I do that every day.

26:27.000 --> 26:31.000
I'm just saying, you know, I call you a bigger bitch. So what's that? That's fact fact.

26:31.000 --> 26:39.000
So I'm just saying, like, are we supposed to all of a sudden forget, you know, the bad choices that they made just because they they went ahead and fixed some of it?

26:39.000 --> 26:43.000
You know, I'm sorry. I'm just not going to. Well, I don't know.

26:43.000 --> 26:50.000
OK, but to be low key, I got to play devil's advocate with you on that, because to be fair, Sony's made their own share of bad decisions.

26:50.000 --> 26:55.000
That's true. So why are we so quick to loyally throw ourselves upon Sony?

26:55.000 --> 27:00.000
Fuck me now, Sony, you're so wonderful. Give me everything my heart desires.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
What bad decisions are we talking about here?

27:03.000 --> 27:11.000
Well, for one, you're about to read a story later in the show that strikes me as a pretty bad decision to release a firmware when it's clearly not ready.

27:11.000 --> 27:19.000
But that's one. The whole fact that the network got hacked and they had to shut down the system for for however long they did because of it.

27:19.000 --> 27:26.000
OK. And then they appease everybody. And they also gave away free games as opposed to Microsoft, who said hack.

27:26.000 --> 27:31.000
We didn't get fucking hacked. Your money just disappeared by ghosts. Ghosts stole it.

27:31.000 --> 27:39.000
You know, like they didn't even fucking you admit that they've been hacked, even though it's been proven over and over and over again that they have been hacked.

27:39.000 --> 27:50.000
And then they then they all of a sudden, oh, yeah, we're going to go ahead and increase our authentication for like stuff, make it a little harder to log in, you know, more security, because, you know, because we just we're we're valuing the consumer.

27:50.000 --> 27:57.000
We want to make sure that you're protected and not because we got hacked and your money got stolen and we didn't do shit about it for over a year.

27:57.000 --> 28:02.000
I I just recalled some other bad decisions that Sony has made in the past.

28:02.000 --> 28:08.000
Are you ready? Here we go. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Kaz Harai Ridge Racer.

28:09.000 --> 28:16.000
The essence of the PlayStation DNA is real change and the consumers are ready.

28:16.000 --> 28:25.000
Genji two is an action game which is based on Japanese history. Ridge Racer being based on history.

28:25.000 --> 28:33.000
The stages of the game will also be based on famous battles which took actually took place in ancient Japan.

28:33.000 --> 28:40.000
So here's this giant enemy crab ridge racer and new best parts coming up.

28:40.000 --> 28:46.000
We point for massive damage. It's Ridge Racer Ridge Racer.

28:46.000 --> 28:54.000
PlayStation three will retail for five hundred and ninety nine U.S. dollars. Five hundred and ninety nine U.S. dollars. Five hundred and ninety nine U.S. dollars.

28:54.000 --> 29:02.000
Giant enemy crab. Five. There you go. Those were all bad ideas. OK. Bad ideas that didn't affect the consumer really in any way.

29:02.000 --> 29:08.000
Five hundred and ninety nine U.S. dollars. Five hundred and ninety nine U.S. dollars. It came down price.

29:08.000 --> 29:14.000
So they launched their new system at five hundred ninety nine U.S. dollars. No it was not. It was at three hundred ninety nine.

29:14.000 --> 29:18.000
And Microsoft is now launching at four hundred ninety nine. You'd think that they would learn the lesson.

29:19.000 --> 29:29.000
But my thing is so that like even look at like PlayStation Plus PlayStation Plus is 10 bucks less a year and you get free games with that.

29:29.000 --> 29:37.000
You get them on Xbox now. But only until the one we did buy the most expensive release of it because well Dan managed GameStop.

29:37.000 --> 29:45.000
We had the in but we when we had the money for it we put it down. We wanted what what they had to offer the backwards compatibility.

29:45.000 --> 29:53.000
It will definitely give in our collection. Yeah. Fully backwards compatible launch with Wi-Fi built in on one system one version of it.

29:53.000 --> 29:59.000
But OK. But still though they paid for that with the poor sales and stuff.

29:59.000 --> 30:04.000
So I think that they've made up for the fact that you know they basically don't want to repeat their mistakes.

30:04.000 --> 30:11.000
However I just don't see a lot of like you know I don't see any decisions that they've made.

30:11.000 --> 30:16.000
They've really affected the consumer poorly like you know oh hey we're gonna have this really weird DRM.

30:16.000 --> 30:22.000
OK. Online passes they did that first party online passes which is a little ridiculous.

30:22.000 --> 30:28.000
So they did that. So I guess that's a fault there. They're not doing it anymore. So they've corrected that mistake.

30:28.000 --> 30:37.000
So I think they've taken all the like kind of negatives about their console and kind of corrected their mistakes and trying to go kind of a fresh start for their new thing.

30:37.000 --> 30:44.000
Whereas Microsoft said hey you know we had a pretty good ride. Let's just see what we can do to I don't know make our ride go faster.

30:44.000 --> 30:50.000
And they started ripping parts out of the car and then just somehow it's going to work better because they don't know what they're doing.

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
All right. Well this debate is going to be continuing for the next several months.

30:54.000 --> 30:58.000
All I can say is like now we've got ourselves a console war like for real.

30:58.000 --> 31:05.000
Like I I I don't remember one and I think I even said this last week before the reversal.

31:05.000 --> 31:10.000
I don't remember a console war this good since the 90s and full page magazine ads.

31:10.000 --> 31:17.000
It's like our system does with this one doesn't you know like this is the popcorn dot gift.

31:17.000 --> 31:21.000
And yes I said gift. Deal with it. All right.

31:21.000 --> 31:28.000
OK. I'm sorry. Bobby says Microsoft made mistakes in but corrected them. But fuck them. No they're still making mistakes right now.

31:28.000 --> 31:34.000
And it's a little different saying you paraphrase the quote but that's OK. Whatever I'm OK.

31:34.000 --> 31:38.000
His exact quote was Sony made mistakes but corrected them. So they're awesome.

31:38.000 --> 31:44.000
Microsoft made mistakes but correct them. But fuck them. There's still a lot of bidding get to you.

31:44.000 --> 31:53.000
There's still a lot. Yes. And saying that came for me. So there's still a lot though that they still have to fix that you know needs to be taken care of.

31:53.000 --> 32:00.000
Price point connect always required. And basically just I don't know.

32:00.000 --> 32:11.000
I just don't like the way that they're kind of looking at the consumers right now. It's kind of is very much like Sony was back at the launch of the PS3 where it's like you're our consumers and not our customers.

32:11.000 --> 32:23.000
So I think I was expected though that Microsoft being a company of their size would kind of look at hmm here's what didn't work for the other guy.

32:23.000 --> 32:30.000
So maybe we shouldn't try doing that too instead of it didn't work for them. But we're better. So we're going to make it work for us.

32:30.000 --> 32:37.000
And that's my thing. All right. Let's get to the results a live poll because I shut this off like a minute ago and haven't read the results.

32:37.000 --> 32:45.000
Okay. Here are the results of the live poll. How do you feel about an Xbox One post their 180. I'm surprised at these results. Here we go.

32:45.000 --> 32:52.000
Number one answer with fifty three point five seven percent. I'm still not buying it.

32:52.000 --> 32:58.000
Zero percent. Not a single single vote for I was going to buy one but now I'm not.

32:58.000 --> 33:07.000
That doesn't surprise me much. But that does tell me that even for the fans the whole family share and all that that wasn't the deal maker.

33:07.000 --> 33:11.000
There's upsetness over that but it's not it's it's not a done deal now that that's out of the picture.

33:11.000 --> 33:21.000
That doesn't surprise me. Zero answers for that. Here's how the rest of it breaks down. Thirty two point one four percent for I was going to buy one anyway and still am.

33:21.000 --> 33:27.000
So a third of the listeners buying an Xbox One that's not too shabby and then fourteen point two nine percent.

33:27.000 --> 33:35.000
Where are my heads at. I wasn't going to buy one before but now I am. So I guess I am the fourteen point two nine percent.

33:35.000 --> 33:47.000
Well I still want a PlayStation 4 just because I don't have to mainly because I'm play both at my work and at home and I don't want to have to lug the system and connect with me every time I'm going back and forth.

33:47.000 --> 34:00.000
That's that reason. And it's one hundred dollars cheaper. Also all the first and this applies for both Sony and Microsoft all their first party exclusive tiles aside from the very like two or three at launch.

34:00.000 --> 34:04.000
All of the ones that I really wanted to play aren't coming out until like sometime next year.

34:04.000 --> 34:14.000
So I'm like I don't really feel the need to like buy an Xbox One now for Sunset Overdrive which by the time we get to next year who knows how many of those titles are going to be delayed beyond next year.

34:14.000 --> 34:28.000
So last of us are not last of us the last guardian anybody. I mean so I don't know. To be fair again Loki Sony same problems could be there but I mean I said for both I said it applies to both.

34:28.000 --> 34:37.000
I am in the PlayStation 4 camp and that's probably mostly for third party games. But yeah. All right. Anyway we got to move on. Thank you.

34:37.000 --> 34:44.000
Thank you. Great discussion in chat. I just I haven't been able to read all the comments but I've been kind of watching so I just want to shout out live on network dot com.

34:44.000 --> 34:53.000
And if you haven't been here for a live show you're missing out because some great like fourth host commentary going on and I want to say one thing though and this does apply.

34:53.000 --> 35:03.000
This ties back to the PlayStation 3 launch where the fuck is a new Ridge Racer game because seriously there is how many consoles have launched recently and not one single fucking Ridge Racer game.

35:03.000 --> 35:15.000
That is the launch game. I kind of think that between what I just played there and the Vita game I think Ridge Racer may not kind of make it may actually be viewed as a bit of a negative right now.

35:15.000 --> 35:23.000
It may be not a game people want a bug bear doing it but bears the pretty awesome they did that. Microsoft's got fours as Sony's got this drive club.

35:23.000 --> 35:33.000
You know it's they have a free to play Ridge Racer game that's coming. So that was the Vita. No the Vita one was buy to play or buy to get four tracks.

35:33.000 --> 35:43.000
But they do have a free to play one by bug bear that's going to be a PC game. But maybe they'll come to the console as well. Jamie I'm looking at these comments in chat.

35:43.000 --> 35:51.000
I didn't catch this whole thing but I know it's clear clear 404 talk about about the Intellivision was technology super technologically superior to the Atari.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
You guys are kicking it old school in chat right now.

35:53.000 --> 36:05.000
What got started on is you know all of the comparisons about the meeting it to console war but saying that these two are technologically similar to each other.

36:05.000 --> 36:13.000
Well we're going over the console war between the Genesis and the Super Nintendo. Super Nintendo technically was the technologically superior system.

36:13.000 --> 36:23.000
And the games did cost more because they were cost more to manufacture but they were in a stat to stat comparison technologically superior.

36:23.000 --> 36:28.000
Then we went back to Intellivision versus Atari and I had a Cliccovision which kicked all of them.

36:28.000 --> 36:34.000
How about the 80s though man you think what how many consoles do we have right now like maybe I guess maybe four.

36:34.000 --> 36:44.000
You have your Xbox ones your PlayStation fours your Wii U and then the Android boxes. I'm going to lump all those in one category.

36:44.000 --> 36:53.000
Well are kind of well the reason why I bring that up is that you go back to the 80s. Oh my God it was consoles and family computers all battling each other.

36:53.000 --> 36:59.000
Let's start with the 70s we had the first Odyssey the Fairchild Channel F. There was the.

36:59.000 --> 37:09.000
Well no I'm just I'm just thinking about those magazine ads I used to see where you would see the screenshots like a Frogger would show you a screenshot from the Atari computer Atari 2600 Commodore 64.

37:09.000 --> 37:18.000
TRS-80, Coleco, Intellivision, Apple like the like there was a lot of fucking console like I guess they weren't really consoles.

37:18.000 --> 37:24.000
They didn't really run into the exclusive thing so much. Gaming devices. It was like we need to get this shit out there. Yeah.

37:24.000 --> 37:31.000
But I mean but if you think about it though I like as far as I can think of it.

37:31.000 --> 37:38.000
There started to be that divergence between PC and console gaming but everything always went into a big bottleneck of popularity.

37:38.000 --> 37:49.000
While you might have had other systems out you know things eventually slid back into the 8-bit era where it was the Master System versus the NES and the NES really stomped Sega with that.

37:49.000 --> 37:54.000
But then you had Genesis versus SNES and then you had versus the TurboGrafx.

37:54.000 --> 38:03.000
That's what I was saying is that you had NEC come in and put out their own system PC Engine in Japan which did a lot better over there than it did here.

38:03.000 --> 38:12.000
And then you know then you start it just basically goes into this bottleneck you'll see other systems start to come around but now we're in this sort of.

38:12.000 --> 38:28.000
It's like three is the sweet number for consoles out two to three systems that has to be that major competition and now we've got like the sitting there we've got phone game we have mobile gaming but really you're getting into the big three bottlenecks and it's like big big loops.

38:28.000 --> 38:32.000
The way that the console thing goes and now we've got a full blown war again.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
It's all just a big mess.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
Drama.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
All right.

38:36.000 --> 38:39.000
Fun debate but we're almost to seven o'clock here on the west coast.

38:39.000 --> 38:43.000
So I want to get into how is your gaming week so we can get into some news.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
Ladies first dark soccer.

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
How is your gaming week and what type of video games have you been playing this week?

38:47.000 --> 38:48.000
Final Fantasy 14.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.000
It's purty.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.000
It's purty.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
Oh my God.

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
I have mine so it's like uber graphic everything.

38:54.000 --> 38:58.000
And I have absolutely zero draw in.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.000
It's amazing.

38:59.000 --> 39:05.000
And the, the, the, the duties are hard.

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
They're fucking hard.

39:07.000 --> 39:11.000
I have a level 13 thaumaturge.

39:11.000 --> 39:18.000
And I have a I just made it okay I made a marauder because I wanted to see what the pirate stuff look like.

39:18.000 --> 39:21.000
And I named her Friska because she's blue.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
Well not blue she's gray.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
Anyway.

39:25.000 --> 39:38.000
So I've been playing that I've been playing massive I played some more Mass Effect three because I got all that high res stuff working and I actually have like a mostly high res Normandy interior now.

39:38.000 --> 39:47.000
So I'm going to put that in as basically just making sure all my mods worked, but everything that has worked has been absolutely gorgeous.

39:47.000 --> 39:55.000
And then I'm still playing through the first Mass Effect, which I'm also playing in a higher resolution because I've patched that one too.

39:55.000 --> 39:59.000
Thank you text mod.

39:59.000 --> 40:05.000
I'm trying to go through I did not say duty bite me.

40:05.000 --> 40:16.000
I've been looking through my other list of games but to be perfectly honest, I have had zero energy all week because I've just had this flu that's kicked my ass.

40:16.000 --> 40:28.000
And, unfortunately, I've been well actually I'm not saying unfortunately because sleep is awesome. I've been doing a lot of sleeping. I'm playing sleep the game.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Achievement unlocked.

40:30.000 --> 40:35.000
You slept for 24 hours. Yes, I did.

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
All right, let me move on to our guests next.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
You all are a bunch of five year olds.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
You're done right.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Oh, everybody in chat.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
All right, let me go to JV Montclair.

40:46.000 --> 40:50.000
What did the hero do in the bathroom he did his duty.

40:50.000 --> 41:01.000
JV one now is your gaming week. It was pretty good. I mean, all I have with me is my 3ds so that's kind of all I've been playing I've been playing mostly just Kingdom Hearts dream drop distance.

41:01.000 --> 41:06.000
You told me before the show you've never played an Animal Crossing game. That is true. I've never played it.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
Fuck is wrong with you.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
It's like the furry Sims.

41:10.000 --> 41:22.000
This is not the furry Sims maybe a little bit really isn't the first. I don't know, I never was given the game. When it came out on GameCube, so I didn't really care when it came out on DS, or we.

41:22.000 --> 41:29.000
So I kind of, I kind of just don't care now everybody's like oh my god I'm crossing and I was like, okay.

41:29.000 --> 41:32.000
Haters gonna hate. I'm not hating.

41:32.000 --> 41:35.000
It's not hate when you don't care. All right, fine.

41:35.000 --> 41:42.000
You would rather get apathy crossing. Sure apathy crossing.

41:42.000 --> 41:45.000
With a little penguin that just says dot dot dot.

41:45.000 --> 41:51.000
Now if you're going by the Japanese version animal forest, it would be like animal suicide forest.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
That's morbid.

41:53.000 --> 42:03.000
I'm not against the concept of me playing Animal Crossing it's just that I'm not going to be the one to go out and buy it for myself if somebody wants to give me Animal Crossing, I'll play it.

42:03.000 --> 42:10.000
Oh, you're being a Jamie right now I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna buy Minecraft with my own money but if someone wants to get it for me.

42:11.000 --> 42:21.000
I might fall in love with it, but I've also been playing Earthbound on emulator Android emulator and plants versus zombies.

42:21.000 --> 42:39.000
My best friend got me plants versus zombies and my free time my free time Oh God what has happened to my free time, looking at some comments and chat at live.vognetwork.com SSJ 100 Matt, I haven't played an Animal Crossing game before, it must be a New York thing because you guys don't know what a forest is.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
It must be something like that.

42:41.000 --> 42:50.000
Koopa Kid Janko says, I'm trying to watch the chat, listen to the show and hunt beetles and Animal Crossing at the same time media overload.

42:50.000 --> 42:59.000
At least those are all awesome things to be doing. And Brad from pop culture says I never played one either tell this new one. Welcome to crack forest.

42:59.000 --> 43:03.000
I know the first thing I'm going to do is save up a million bells and buy a crown.

43:03.000 --> 43:12.000
So I can be the queen of my village. I just, I was excited because I finally got to replace a villager saying, that's my favorite thing to do is to get them to say new things.

43:12.000 --> 43:17.000
So in honor of Alan, my little breathe the bunny now says lol butts after everything.

43:18.000 --> 43:23.000
You had a character in my GameCube one saying bitch face. Remember?

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
Maybe. I may have done that.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
And then you stole my lesbian.

43:27.000 --> 43:28.000
Yeah.

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
I'm so mad.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
I do that. All right.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
Anything else, Jamie?

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
No, I think that's about it.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.000
Loki.

43:36.000 --> 43:40.000
I just played Final Fantasy 14. Well, yesterday pretty much.

43:40.000 --> 43:45.000
And it's all right. I played it on the PlayStation 3.

43:45.000 --> 43:52.000
So the graphics are okay. I don't know if they're going to be that great compared to the PC though. Obviously not.

43:52.000 --> 44:05.000
But it was fun. I am a level 8 black mage because I'm not going to fucking refer to their, the classes that have been in the goddamn franchise for how many years now.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
And we're all of a sudden going to flip them on.

44:07.000 --> 44:13.000
Here's the deal. Here's the deal. There are black mages like called a black mage in Final Fantasy 14.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
It's BLM.

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000
Yeah, you don't see.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
Thaumaturge is different.

44:16.000 --> 44:22.000
Yeah, you don't see them yet because they had to rear end that into the game. They had to like back park that into the game.

44:22.000 --> 44:30.000
Because yes, the original creators of 14 were smoking crack and made up all these new classes like Thaumaturge, Gladiator and all this stuff that wasn't very Final Fantasy 14.

44:30.000 --> 44:37.000
But when the fans bitched and moaned and complained, now the black mage and white mage, they're there, but they're advanced classes.

44:37.000 --> 44:45.000
So at least in old 14, I think when you got like a Thaumaturge to 20 and a Conjurer to 10, you could become a black mage.

44:45.000 --> 44:51.000
I might be screwing up those numbers, but like those jobs do exist later. They're just considered the advanced jobs.

44:51.000 --> 44:54.000
So to be fair, Loki, amongst your anger.

44:54.000 --> 45:03.000
As I said, level eight black mage. And basically I am spamming Blizzard to win. And that's, you know, kind of how it goes.

45:03.000 --> 45:10.000
And I have thunder now and I can I guess thunder is like DPS or something. And yeah.

45:10.000 --> 45:20.000
And I let my son play the game for a while. So there was there was a good portion where he was running into a wall and jumping in a fountain because, you know, and I had video of that.

45:20.000 --> 45:25.000
But my wife does want me to post it on the internet because she's in it and she doesn't like being in any of the videos.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
We may have to explain the lesbian, Rob.

45:27.000 --> 45:31.000
All right. Please go ahead. Wasn't she like a duck or something?

45:31.000 --> 45:32.000
No, she was an aardvark.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
Yeah. No, she wasn't an aardvark.

45:34.000 --> 45:37.000
She had the big blue nose. Didn't she?

45:37.000 --> 45:40.000
No, I don't think she was an aardvark. I think she was a duck.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Whatever. But she was totally a gym teacher.

45:43.000 --> 45:54.000
OK. Yeah. You go into her house. She's wearing sweats and everything is like one of those horses things that you jump over and gym equipment and everything.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Her her room was a gym.

45:56.000 --> 45:59.000
So we and her house was playing KK Lilith Fair.

45:59.000 --> 46:06.000
Yeah, it was playing some music or the other that sounded really, you know, very SJW now, I guess.

46:06.000 --> 46:16.000
But so we put a rainbow sign outside her house and we like had her say something that was like super gay.

46:16.000 --> 46:20.000
I don't know, because we were just being really awful because she was so stereotypical.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
Yeah. And we just called her our lesbian.

46:22.000 --> 46:25.000
Admittedly, these were horrible stereotypes.

46:25.000 --> 46:29.000
But, you know, all in all, if you can't poke fun at each other, what can you do?

46:29.000 --> 46:34.000
Exactly. So and I mean, I even I.

46:34.000 --> 46:40.000
Everyone I ever showed this character to said, is she a lesbian? So she ended up being the town lesbian.

46:40.000 --> 46:45.000
Apparently, she's the only one. She couldn't get a date. I mean, if someone had moved into the house with her, then we would have known.

46:45.000 --> 46:48.000
Yeah, right. Bad stereotypes, I know.

46:48.000 --> 46:54.000
OK. So anyway, anyway. So Rob stole her. Rob stole my lesbian, but I got her back.

46:54.000 --> 47:00.000
I did want to mention one last thing, because I am taking that C++ course and is game related stuff.

47:00.000 --> 47:11.000
So one of the later when I get into the whole racing engine making thing tutorial, there's an example game done by the guy that teaches the course.

47:11.000 --> 47:16.000
He sings the theme song for it. And it's fucking fantastic. Really?

47:16.000 --> 47:20.000
The guy's awesome, actually, because he's like this like Brit. I don't know if he's like British.

47:20.000 --> 47:23.000
He kind of looks British. But how do you look?

47:23.000 --> 47:26.000
It sounds pretty. He's extra.

47:26.000 --> 47:31.000
He looks like the guy. And this is I hate him to stereotype.

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
Hey, stop, stop, stop.

47:33.000 --> 47:38.000
He sounds British. OK, so you like his beans on toast.

47:38.000 --> 47:43.000
He sounds British. But OK, so the guy he kind of just order a fucking crumpet.

47:43.000 --> 47:48.000
Get out of here, you dirty Brit. And I hate even referring back to this.

47:48.000 --> 47:54.000
But only because I had to watch the whole series of this damn show. He looks like the husband on medium.

47:54.000 --> 47:59.000
OK, doctor, do you have to take a lift to get up to the classroom?

47:59.000 --> 48:05.000
Welcome the pavement. Are you the doctor?

48:05.000 --> 48:10.000
It's like I totally forgot what Loki was trying to really say, but it's all look at my face.

48:10.000 --> 48:14.000
I ain't bothered. All right. Moving on. My turn.

48:14.000 --> 48:19.000
So games that I've been playing this week, I've also been playing the Final Fantasy 14 beta.

48:19.000 --> 48:22.000
And let me tell you, y'all, it's really good. I love it.

48:22.000 --> 48:26.000
And I was was trying to spend some time thinking about why do I love this game so much?

48:26.000 --> 48:29.000
Because I liked 11 to I liked 11 an awful lot.

48:29.000 --> 48:35.000
I played it for three years, but 11 felt like a PC MMO that they kind of.

48:35.000 --> 48:39.000
And I'm going to use that analogy back parked again into a PlayStation 2.

48:39.000 --> 48:46.000
I realize 11 was a very PlayStation 2 or it was a very, very heavily played on PlayStation 2 in Japan.

48:46.000 --> 48:50.000
But it really always felt like one thing real quick. I was going to mention about the on console,

48:50.000 --> 48:54.000
because I don't know if you guys are playing with PC controllers or whatever keyboard, mouse and stuff,

48:54.000 --> 48:59.000
but the macro system that they have now with the shoulder buttons and stuff is fucking awesome on the console.

48:59.000 --> 49:05.000
So just mention. Well, I know, but I was going to say Final Fantasy 14 plays like a console game on the PC.

49:05.000 --> 49:10.000
This truly feels like I'm playing like a console Final Fantasy game where there just happens to be

49:10.000 --> 49:13.000
other people running around and we can go do dungeons together if we want.

49:13.000 --> 49:17.000
And we can do the guild quest things if we want. We can do all that.

49:17.000 --> 49:20.000
Or I could just play it myself and enjoy the story.

49:20.000 --> 49:23.000
And like, I really think this new producer kind of gets it.

49:23.000 --> 49:27.000
And you see it in the last letter that he put out there is like, that was long.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
Well, if you really read it. Yeah.

49:29.000 --> 49:35.000
Yeah. He's really trying to talk about, you know, there's a lot of people out there that are afraid to play MMOs

49:35.000 --> 49:42.000
because they're like, oh, other people. So we wanted to create a story that would work without other people,

49:42.000 --> 49:47.000
but we weren't necessarily going to make it easy. And I just, I thought that was a great way to approach it.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
And that's how the game really feels to me.

49:49.000 --> 49:56.000
Well, and there was the, what was the comment about you get caught up in the story of each town where,

49:56.000 --> 50:02.000
and I really like that each town has its own sort of politics around that area instead of, oh,

50:02.000 --> 50:08.000
can you go take this letter to Ironforge? Yeah, the dwarves are doing this, but we live in Stormwind.

50:08.000 --> 50:13.000
Fuck them. Basically, you don't have to do the big town hopping thing.

50:13.000 --> 50:20.000
You work in your community around your town and then when you've exhausted your area around your town,

50:20.000 --> 50:24.000
then it's logical to move on. And so just going, well, I'm just going to level over here now.

50:24.000 --> 50:29.000
It's the one thing that's really interesting to me. This game has potential to be a huge hit.

50:29.000 --> 50:34.000
And I'm not, I don't even, I'm not going to say wow killer because I really think there's room at the table

50:34.000 --> 50:37.000
for more than one online game. There's lots of online games people play.

50:37.000 --> 50:42.000
I think Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn has the potential to be a huge game,

50:42.000 --> 50:47.000
which is interesting because it's not the first time they've released the game, which is a whole nother story.

50:47.000 --> 50:53.000
The problem is going to be that subscription fee and convincing people that, yes, to run around and play a solo game,

50:53.000 --> 50:56.000
I'm going to pay $15 a month.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.000
I'm convinced.

50:57.000 --> 51:00.000
I'm convinced too, but there's going to be a lot of people that aren't.

51:00.000 --> 51:07.000
I'm not. And the reason why is because there's other MMOs out there that, you know, played that just are that one time.

51:07.000 --> 51:12.000
What new content are they really adding on a regular basis other than server upkeep?

51:12.000 --> 51:17.000
It's just there's other games that you can buy at once and play it.

51:18.000 --> 51:27.000
I can't dedicate enough time every month to playing this game when I'm playing a ton of stuff to justify paying a monthly subscription.

51:27.000 --> 51:32.000
I'm very curious to see what Endgame looks like because that's going to be the make or break for this game.

51:32.000 --> 51:36.000
It's convincing people once they beat the single player campaign to keep paying for this game.

51:36.000 --> 51:40.000
You know what I mean? So we'll see. We'll see. I love it. We'll see.

51:40.000 --> 51:47.000
I did have to say in looking at, and again, I didn't try it on PS3. I didn't want to bother with it because I can't use the controller anyway.

51:47.000 --> 51:58.000
I did look at video comparisons and to be honest, I think that the PS3 version is going to, it suffers in the visual department.

51:58.000 --> 52:04.000
I have a really important question for everybody. Can somebody please explain to me why this bottle of Patron is still sealed?

52:04.000 --> 52:07.000
I need to be having a shot of that if I'm going to drive home.

52:08.000 --> 52:11.000
I'm like, why is this thing not open yet? Anyway, I'll work on that.

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
I'm curious to see what the PS4 version is going to look like.

52:13.000 --> 52:19.000
Me too. I have one other game I got to talk about real quick because everybody's been talking about Final Fantasy XIV, but I do have one other game that's important for me to get out there.

52:19.000 --> 52:27.000
Super Mario Brothers U had the DLC come out for Super Luigi. What's it called? Super Luigi Brothers U or something?

52:27.000 --> 52:30.000
It's New Super Luigi U.

52:30.000 --> 52:33.000
Whatever it's called, y'all know what it is. It's the game with Luigi.

52:33.000 --> 52:39.000
It really threw me at first because I'm like, Nintendo DLC, this is so weird.

52:39.000 --> 52:45.000
I know they had the levels on the 3DS one, but to do it on a console, this is so weird.

52:45.000 --> 52:53.000
But here it is, you guys. It's the exact same map, but all the stages in the map have been redone when you play as Luigi.

52:53.000 --> 52:56.000
And it's really cute because they threw in some illusions to Luigi.

52:56.000 --> 53:02.000
Like there's Luigi shapes in the dirt that you see, like little Luigi fossils or something.

53:02.000 --> 53:07.000
You see little statues of Luigi made out of the bush, and they're not all obvious.

53:07.000 --> 53:13.000
Like some of them are kind of very subtle, so I really kind of like that they threw all those nods to Luigi in there.

53:13.000 --> 53:18.000
But anyway, every level is redone and you only have 100 seconds to clear each level.

53:18.000 --> 53:24.000
So honestly, Super Luigi U is like a really good ROM hack that Nintendo endorses.

53:24.000 --> 53:28.000
That's not a bad thing. I think it's pretty cool.

53:28.000 --> 53:32.000
20 bucks, a little hefty, but it's very, very robust.

53:32.000 --> 53:35.000
I mean, it is every single level start to finish.

53:35.000 --> 53:40.000
Granted, you only have the 100 seconds, but I think there's going to be a lot of people that are up for the challenge of,

53:40.000 --> 53:43.000
not only can I clear the level, can I get all three coins?

53:43.000 --> 53:49.000
Because some of them are really hard and it's going to take that Mega Man level of muscle memory in order to be able to do it.

53:49.000 --> 53:53.000
And I think there's a lot of people that want that difficulty out of a Mario Brothers game.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
So here you go. Enjoy.

53:55.000 --> 53:59.000
Gameguru in chat says, now it's Luigi's time to shine.

53:59.000 --> 54:02.000
Nabbit steals all the power-ups. Dang, Nabbit.

54:02.000 --> 54:06.000
Yeah, Nabbit is still, that whole thing is actually still in the game.

54:06.000 --> 54:12.000
But you know what else is weird? Because since Mario's not in it, you have Luigi the two toads and Nabbit is the fourth player.

54:12.000 --> 54:15.000
So you could have Nabbit chasing Nabbit. It's very meta.

54:16.000 --> 54:22.000
But Nabbit actually is the kind of easy mode in the game because Nabbit can't die.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Oh, really? I didn't know that. Oh.

54:25.000 --> 54:28.000
I haven't switched away from Luigi. Interesting.

54:28.000 --> 54:32.000
Tigerclaw reminding us Super Luigi U is also going to be a standalone product as well.

54:32.000 --> 54:37.000
You know, I got to give props to Nintendo for really dummy-proofing their DLC.

54:37.000 --> 54:41.000
Like, they're not trying to make an easy buck off of somebody stupid because, you know,

54:41.000 --> 54:47.000
when you go into the store to download it, it says, do you own Super Mario Brothers Wii U?

54:47.000 --> 54:52.000
You cannot play this without it. And you have to hit yes, I own it in order to download it.

54:52.000 --> 55:01.000
And it even says, if you download this, or no, it says, if you own the disc of Super Luigi U, you do not need to download this.

55:01.000 --> 55:07.000
They are the same. Like, there's a lot of little reminders in there and I thought, wow, they're really idiot-proofing this so they don't get any angry phone calls.

55:07.000 --> 55:10.000
Although somebody's still gonna fuck up. You know it.

55:10.000 --> 55:14.000
I think Nintendo's MO, though, is, you know, CYA.

55:14.000 --> 55:21.000
True. Cover your assets. Koopakit Jeremy in chat pointing out, Nabbit can die in pits, but otherwise invincible.

55:21.000 --> 55:28.000
You know what the trick is, though? Get that baby Yoshi and do his little, get the pink one where when you hit the trigger, he blows up like a balloon.

55:28.000 --> 55:32.000
So easy to get through a lot of levels of that. Just saying. Good times.

55:32.000 --> 55:37.000
Alright. GameGuru says, I got to admit, Nintendo's first attempt at DLC is rather admirable.

55:37.000 --> 55:45.000
To be fair, the gold coins, Super Mario 2, I can't even keep them straight anymore, that was the first DLC.

55:45.000 --> 55:48.000
But first console DLC, yes. There you go.

55:48.000 --> 55:54.000
Alright. That's it for gaming weeks. We gotta move on. We've got stories to get into.

55:54.000 --> 55:55.000
That's all we did.

55:55.000 --> 55:59.000
Well, we got this bottle of Patron to open here.

55:59.000 --> 56:00.000
I need my one shot.

56:00.000 --> 56:05.000
But first, we gotta do housekeeping. And I've got a lot of housekeeping tonight, so I'll try to make this quick.

56:05.000 --> 56:09.000
First off, I have to give a wink and a nod to the fact that it is our 11th birthday.

56:09.000 --> 56:13.000
Thank you all, OLR me, for your support of this show.

56:13.000 --> 56:17.000
And, you know, we may not have the biggest audience on the internet, but we have some of the most loyal.

56:17.000 --> 56:22.000
And you guys are amazing, and you turn up here Sunday nights, and you are really our motivation for still doing this.

56:22.000 --> 56:25.000
I mean, OLR will have to end some day.

56:25.000 --> 56:28.000
Not saying tomorrow, not saying this, so don't panic.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
But I'm just saying, it's gonna end some day.

56:30.000 --> 56:38.000
Because, you know, eventually somebody's gonna move away, there's gonna be a job, there's just gonna be something where we're not gonna be able to do the show anymore.

56:38.000 --> 56:47.000
But we couldn't have kept it going as long as we have and had the discipline and the motivation to be here every Sunday if it weren't for you guys and your continued support.

56:47.000 --> 56:53.000
And it really feels like our family grows every week. I see new people in chat every week, and it's just amazing.

56:53.000 --> 57:00.000
And when people ask me, like, why do you do that? You've done that every Sunday? How on earth? Where do you find your motivation?

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
I'm like, just look at the chat.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
No, the other thing. You don't get paid?

57:04.000 --> 57:05.000
Yeah, yeah.

57:05.000 --> 57:06.000
No?

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
Yeah. I got that one today, didn't I?

57:08.000 --> 57:12.000
So, you guys are great. Thank you so much.

57:12.000 --> 57:18.000
So here's to 11 more years, we hope. We're gonna keep doing this as long as we possibly can.

57:19.000 --> 57:27.000
Other things I want to plug. I would like to give a shout out, and many of them are in chat, so I'm just gonna say holla to the Koopa Club podcast.

57:27.000 --> 57:33.000
They spell it a little funky, so let me spell that for you. It's Q-O-O-P-A-K-L-U-B.

57:33.000 --> 57:41.000
And you can search that on iTunes or what have you, whatever podcasting site, because they had me as a guest on their 25th episode this week.

57:41.000 --> 57:45.000
So would it be like it's all the Koopa kids except they're played by John Delancey?

57:45.000 --> 57:53.000
Yes. It's just like that, actually. What? Alright, so yeah, check that out. I was on their latest episode, it was a lot of fun.

57:53.000 --> 58:00.000
And they asked me some dirty questions about Nintendo. It was a very Nintendo love episode, and the last question was a little bit dirty.

58:00.000 --> 58:06.000
They made me pick the Merry Fuck Kill from the Nintendo world, so I'm gonna just leave it at that. So there you go.

58:08.000 --> 58:14.000
Also, since I brought up Koopa Club, I want to give a shout out to GamerX, because I haven't been plugging this enough on Orange Launch Radio.

58:14.000 --> 58:21.000
But if you're in Northern California, especially the Bay Area, you've got to go to GamerX. That's gonna be on August 3rd and August 4th.

58:21.000 --> 58:26.000
And it's taking place, I forget the name of the hotel, but it's Japan Town.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
Somewhere. Oh, Miyako.

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
Yeah, it's that whole district.

58:30.000 --> 58:33.000
This is the side that's the Miyako Mall, right?

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
Can I just say why Allen is perfect?

58:35.000 --> 58:38.000
I don't know, because those are peanut butter chocolate brownies.

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
Allen, you just got home from work.

58:40.000 --> 58:41.000
Yes.

58:41.000 --> 58:42.000
You literally walked through the door.

58:42.000 --> 58:43.000
Yes.

58:43.000 --> 58:44.000
What was the first place you went to?

58:44.000 --> 58:50.000
I went into the kitchen and got shot glasses and put them on the dining room table, because I was listening to the feed from my phone.

58:50.000 --> 58:56.000
So as I'm coming through the apartment complex, I hear, we need to drink the Patron, why is the Patron still closed?

58:56.000 --> 58:59.000
I'm like, I have to grab the shot glasses as soon as I walk through the door. So I did.

59:00.000 --> 59:01.000
He's so wonderful.

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
Allen wins a brownie. Here, have one.

59:03.000 --> 59:04.000
Have a brownie.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
Alright, anyway. Where was I? Oh yeah, GamerX.

59:06.000 --> 59:14.000
So GamerX on Saturday night with Koopa Club and Game Buoy and my other show Hoard House and Game Bar and God knows who else.

59:14.000 --> 59:21.000
We're going to be doing like a podcast panel and it's going to just be a big party and celebrating indie podcasting.

59:21.000 --> 59:22.000
And you can do it too.

59:22.000 --> 59:26.000
So yeah, check that out at GamerX and don't be shy.

59:26.000 --> 59:30.000
Say hello, because we're all like regular people and we want to meet cool people.

59:30.000 --> 59:34.000
And if you listen to this show and you made it this far, chances are you're a cool person.

59:34.000 --> 59:35.000
Oh my God, Rob, I should cosplay.

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
What are you going to cosplay as?

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
I don't know, I'll probably do something.

59:39.000 --> 59:42.000
You should go as your Animal Crossing lesbian.

59:42.000 --> 59:49.000
No, because I figured if it's me, I have to do something annoying so I'm going to homestuck.

59:49.000 --> 59:56.000
Alright. Anyhow, and also I want to put this out there.

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
So GamerX, Koopa Club, and one last thing.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:04.000
If you were listening to the show last week, Bobby Blackwolf, our friend and pal who does the show before ours,

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:12.000
every Sunday night at 5 o'clock Pacific, 8 o'clock Eastern, his house was struck by lightning in the middle of our show last week.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000
And he lost a lot of video game consoles because of it.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:23.000
I'm not going to repeat the whole thing because you can see his post that will catch you up on it on our vognetwork.com forums.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000
You can also listen to it on his show, kind of the wrap up and everything.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.000
And it just, dude's been going through a lot this week.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
And have lightning hit your fucking house?

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:36.000
I'm so glad that so many people were able to help him out.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:40.000
However, I'm bringing it up because Bobby still needs help with one thing.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000
He has a Neo Geo AES US version.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:50.000
And he's trying to get this repaired because it did suffer damage, but it is repairable.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000
He says he could do it himself, but he doesn't really have time.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.000
So he would love to be able to ship this out, PayPal you money, have you ship it back.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:07.000
I did suggest earlier, seeing if you could find out who it was that the guy who runs classic game room had an NBS, but the boards are similar.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Well, my hope is that one of our listeners, maybe who doesn't talk to us an awful lot, who just listens to this show.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:18.000
My hope is somebody is sitting out there going, I do that, or like my friend owns a shop and they do that.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000
My hope is that somebody out there is listening that could do that.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Someone could be sleeping in a bed of AES boards.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Please contact us. You can fill out a form at vognetwork.com that will email Bobby directly.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
You can email me and I'll get you in touch with Bobby.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:40.000
We're super approachable. If you think you can help out with the Neo Geo AES situation, please, please, please reach out and get ahold of us.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Go on to vognetwork.com in the contact us page and send Bobby a quick letter.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
He would deeply appreciate it.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:51.000
We want our friend to get his Neo Geo back because how else is he going to play Fatal Fury Special?

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:58.000
He could come to my house. Bobby come to my house and bring all your games. We'll have a party.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:03.000
And Bobby is also pointing out in chat room, bonus if you could also just mod it at the same time.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Because, you know, he might want to be able to play more games on that Neo Geo.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Well, you actually, I think it's actually more of a physical thing. You can switch the, there's a switch on the games themselves I think.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Because our, we can play, our Samurai Showdown 2 is Japanese.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:23.000
I don't know shit about Neo Geos because I never owned one. I only played them in the arcade.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Unless it's to do modified MVS cartridges. I don't know.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:33.000
I have a couple Neo Geo arcade boards. One is modded to play all region stuff.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:43.000
And I have a 48-in-1 cart and I have a super gun that would plug into that that takes Neo Geo controllers.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
There you go. There's a killer combo right there.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Alright, well I'm hoping that Bobby gets what he needs.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:55.000
He also mentions the video mod that will put it over S-Video component and a BIOS mod to affect the lives and stuff.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Those are the types of mods he's looking for.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:06.000
So, alright, good luck Bobby. We all are hoping to see you get through that and get your consoles even better than they were before lightning hit your house.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Alright, 7.15 and we have yet to hit the news. So let's jump into a busy week in gaming news.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Loki. And this bottle is still closed. I think we need to...

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
No it's not.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Yay. Alright.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Alright, so let's talk a little bit more about the Xbox One.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Of course one of the wonderful comments that come out before the whole 180 flop on the DRM stuff was them defending the $4.99 price tag.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Basically saying, and this is Don Mattrick of course, it's a lower number than some of the analysts had forecasted.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000
We're over delivering value against other choices.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:59.000
I think consumers can get, or I think consumers can get, any modern product these days you're going to look at and $4.99 isn't a ridiculous price point.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:05.000
We're delivering thousands of dollars of value to people so I think they're going to love it when they use it.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:16.000
So he's basically comparing the $4.99 price point of the Xbox One as kind of like an iPad or something like that.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Which is a terrible comparison if you ask me because that's apples and oranges right there versus game consoles.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:31.000
That's like saying, hey well you know what? This console only costs $4.99. I mean at least it's not a $30,000 car, right?

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000
It's way cheaper.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Such a lightweight Rob.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Behind the scenes Rob has done, I have a voice now thanks to tequila.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Sorry Loki, I've totally not been paying attention because we all did a shot while you were reading that story.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.000
And that burns so much. I've been doing gay flappy hands around the house.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Just flailing around everywhere.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
It burns!

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Oh my gosh, I'm warm.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
I'm sitting here going.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.000
I don't usually do shots of hard alcohol. This is Alan by the way.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:10.000
I've never done a shot of tequila before. It's not as bad as the time I tried a shot of 151 which I was tricked into doing.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
That's Patron.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Smooth tequila.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Rob totally got the shivers.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Patron is the only tequila that doesn't give me the shivers.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000
I was going to get a little glasses of orange juice in case anyone needs a chaser.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Because I don't know how much it burns. But that was actually very smooth.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Ah, Koopa Kid Jeremy in chat says, Vine it Rob. I wish I thought to do that. I guess I'll have to take another shot.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Yay, more shots.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Actually next up is Fireball because we've still got some of that.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Kind of scared about that one.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Alright, here we go. Anyway, where were we Loki?

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Summarize for me real quick, sorry.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:54.000
What up GS if I had a Neo Geo emulator. Yes, I do have an emulator for Neo Geo stuff.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.000
No, I'm talking actually an MVS board. Like arcade Neo Geo boards.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:04.000
I have two single slot arcade boards because I got one with my arcade cabinet.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.000
And then another one because I don't know why. Because I need to buy another one I guess.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Alright, so basically they're defending the price of saying, oh it's a wonderful piece of electronics.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:20.000
And so $4.99 is not that bad when you compare it to an iPad or something like that.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Which I say is a terrible comparison because they're very different devices.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Do you think this decision is going to single handedly damn the device? Because that's how you were talking earlier in the show.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.000
It's definitely going to hurt it because basically now people are comparing the two consoles that are coming out.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000
You have one that spec wise is more powerful than the other one. That would be the PS4.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000
And it's cheaper. And doesn't require Kinect.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:54.000
And I know for some people that the fact that you're not getting Kinect in there is kind of, they're looking at it.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Well you still have to buy the camera for the Playstation 4 and that's going to be an extra $60.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:03.000
But a lot of people just don't give a shit about that camera and aren't planning on using it anyways.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Same as those people like myself that probably would get an Xbox One with the Kinect and not use the Kinect.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Unless it's a dancing game or something that really relies on it.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:26.000
But you're not going to probably use it for Forza or Rise. I'm not going to go flailing my arms to do finishing moves in Rise or something.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:38.000
So that's the thing. I think you would have an easier time selling it for $500 if they really showed why that Kinect is so important.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Just like how Nintendo did with the Wii showing why controlling the games like this is way better than controlling it with a controller.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:55.000
You know what I would love from a perfectly selfish, I don't care about talking about this on the show because I totally just had a shot, type of standpoint.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Is that if this whole thing about Twitch integration and all that with the Kinect, wouldn't that be great if we could broadcast our show over the Xbox 360?

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Or over the Xbox One, excuse me, with Kinect and that whole thing because of the Twitch integration? Could we do that?

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:18.000
The problem would be is you'd have to have some sort of gameplay on there. You can't just broadcast.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000
We used to do that.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000
I know.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
When we had the larger studio.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:29.000
You could technically do that because they have it where it's going to pick up audio from the game and it's going to pick up audio from you as well.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:38.000
So you could probably rig it somehow to do that I guess. It would probably be easier to do that through a PC though.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:47.000
But I guess you could point a camera at it. But you could kind of do that now with Skype or something I guess.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Point a camera at whatever we're doing.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:55.000
But, I don't know. I just think it's ridiculous.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Okay, so other stuff. Let's talk about other things. We already mentioned, of course, Kinect's always required.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:08.000
And they're saying that they're not planning on offering the system without the Kinect because it is a core part of the experience.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.000
And because I think at this point it's too late to change any of that stuff.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.000
I have bad news that's very important that we have to discuss.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000
What?

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:22.000
I was reminded by Alan that last time we were entertaining friends, we drank the rest of the Fireball.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Aww.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:27.000
I'm very sorry, Jvmon. You came out here for nothing.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Well, time to go home.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.000
I would like to say to Pod Culture, thanks.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:39.000
I was like, we really finished that whole thing off, but yeah, I guess we did between the 500th episode and all that.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Sorry, Logi.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:45.000
And also the other thing we should mention is nothing has changed as far as cloud computing.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:55.000
So, whereas, yes, there will be games that can play offline, a lot of them will be online only because they require cloud computing.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:02.000
And I think that also goes for the PlayStation 4 as well. They are able to use cloud computing for their titles as well.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000
So you could still have a SimCity-esque game on the 360?

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Yes, you could have a lot of that.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:13.000
I'm never going to stop calling it the 360. The 361, you're never going to...

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
You're still going to have games like SimCity that will...

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
You could, yeah.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Because we all see how well that went.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
But I guess it still sold tons.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:29.000
But here's the thing though, is if it's such a big deal, or if it's such a problem with those cloud computing things, people are going to be made aware of it.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:38.000
People are going to say, hey, you guys, watch out because the next Forza or whatever is going to be something that requires cloud computing.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:43.000
And if their servers go down, your cars are going to start murdering people or something, I don't know.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:50.000
So I think that there's going to be a lot of awareness out there. And also, it's probably something that's on the box.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Lots of interesting stuff in chat.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:11:01.000
ShadowNextGen says, the PlayStation camera is so screwed, developers won't be able to assume people have it and might get the same type of support PlayStation Move received.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
That is to say, not much.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:10.000
I'm with you and I'm not because I still feel like at E3, it looks like it's not getting any support anyway.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:18.000
I get as far as the core elements, and I'm using my quotey fingers of the console when it comes to watching TV with friends and other stuff like it has it.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:28.000
So you can assume that anybody with an Xbox One is going to have that, but I have yet to see how that really positively impacts games. I hope that's coming.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:38.000
I don't think that's really a big deal though, because once again, like with Kinect even, even though we know that that system uses Kinect all the time,

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:43.000
they still have other ways to navigate that menu and stuff. It's not just with gestures.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:57.000
So, what's the difference, I say? You're already implementing other control methods anyways, and most likely are probably going to stick to standardized controller usage and stuff,

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:08.000
and not just going to go all gung-ho with just the camera, but if they're already doing this, what's the big deal if it may not be in there? Just prepare for both scenarios.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:15.000
I think camera usage is not a big deal. It's back when the 360 was, we can't assume that they have a hard drive was a problem.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:22.000
So, just throwing it out there for the live listeners. Apparently our stream just keeps dropping, and again, our stream's drunk.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.000
I don't know, oh god, it's doing it again. This is horrible.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.000
The stream had some Patron.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:32.000
I tried to just, I did a reconnect from scratch. It like dropped twice in a row there. I just did a reconnect from scratch.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.000
I hope that keeps, I reset the internet before the show and everything. I don't get it.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.000
I'm a witness.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Oh my god, it just went down again. This is horrible.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Our stream is a whore.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.000
I don't know what to do, you guys. This is really bad.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Does she keep going down?

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.000
She does keep going down.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:56.000
This is it, that's like three times in the scope of like one minute that it went down, and me drinking is not helping any.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.000
So, I don't know.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Thanks NSA.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Everybody's got their...

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Alan, you're not running torrents, are you?

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
He says no.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Alright.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Sorry guys, I wish we could fix this. I don't know what else to do.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000
I'm thinking.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:21.000
I honestly can't afford any new computer parts right now.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:26.000
I'm like, we could replace that router, because that one's really old.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:30.000
But anyway, I guess this is a conversation best had off air, so.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Sorry guys.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Talk to me after.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Okay, yeah, that might be a good thing.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Alright, I'm sorry, but there's literally is not on our end. We're not running torrents or anything that would interrupt the stream. This is not reasonable.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Two, the other thing is, you know, notice we're not dropping out chat. It's not anything.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.000
It's not us, it's the host.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Yeah, I hate to say it, we might need to think about another host. This keeps up.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.000
But anyway, that's a conversation for another day.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Should we move on with the next story?

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Yeah.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Alright, the free-to-play franchise out of Nintendo has been announced. It's Steel Diver.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Boo!

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.000
Dang, y'all haters. What's wrong with Steel Diver?

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
It's lame. It's a lame...

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.000
The game wasn't that popular at launch.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Granted, it's a first-party title, and it was kind of lame for the 3DS launch.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Now that they're coming out free-to-play, it's just like, cool, I'm sure people will download it to try it out, but it's just kind of like, eh, whatever.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:37.000
I mean, it's not that big a deal. It's like, I don't know.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:44.000
I can't really think of another lame Nintendo first-party title that was on the 3DS, and Steel Diver is pretty bad.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:48.000
I mean, pilot wings would be kind of second, I don't know.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:53.000
Do free-to-play Nintendogs or something like that. At least then you could charge DLC for like, callers and bullshit, hats.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Puppies for free.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Well, I kind of understand, though, that you want to dip your big toe into this big, scary new world which is free-to-play with a game that maybe not a lot of, you know, that doesn't...

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Like, you don't want to fuck up Pokemon. Like, you're not going to take one of your big, big franchises into the free-to-play world.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:15.000
I agree with something maybe like pilot wings or, you know, as much as my fanboy self would love it, something like F-Zero.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Going free-to-play would be great, you know, but I understand that Nintendo has to kind of test this first before they can really do it, you know?

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Let's test it with crap.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Are they very lit? So is this coming to the Wii U or is this just 3DS still?

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:36.000
I believe this is still only 3DS. You got tank, tank, tank on the Wii U, although that's third party.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Yeah, that's still part of the whole Namco experimenting with free-to-play.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
And it's more just a glorified demo, honestly.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:52.000
Was Steel Diver that big of a 3DS property that was like, hey, out of all the things we can make a free-to-play game, how about Steel Diver?

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:59.000
No, and I think that's why it is this game. Because, you know, again, if it fucks up and crashes and burns horribly, oh well, it was Steel Diver.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:02.000
So it's like, it's only Steel Diver's reputation that got shat on.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Exactly! And I think with a big thing like this, that's the type of game that you have to do it with, right?

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Well, let me throw this out there, though, that Nintendo is open to the idea of other free-to-play games.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:20.000
One of them mentioned by the lead designer named Katsuya Eguchi of Animal Crossing.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Possibly a free-to-play Animal Crossing.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
That's a dangerous combination.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Which would have the dreaded microtransactions.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.000
They have to just consider what would be free at the beginning.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Nintendo would have to have a business model that works. Here's the quote.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:42.000
I think the main thing that we need to think about before even considering doing something like that is to determine what we're gonna make available from the beginning.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.000
I think that's key in deciding whether we do something like that.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:53.000
If I find a business model that works, however, that works for Nintendo and the end user, then I can't say free-to-play is something we wouldn't consider.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:58.000
When you look at our main audience in Japan, they are definitely that audience that has smartphones.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
They are women in their late teens and early twenties.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:04.000
They are certainly paying free-to-play games on their smartphone.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Hmm. I'm sure a free-to-play Animal Crossing makes a lot of people happy.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:19.000
But then again, I kind of like the pay-to-play Animal Crossing because I like the fact that one great thing about the new Animal Crossing is how new features kind of slowly roll out to your town.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
I would really hate it if I had to pay for that.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:28.000
So I would hope if they go to free-to-play route with a game like Animal Crossing that you can also just buy the game up front.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Like Killer Instinct on Xbox One we were talking about last week.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.000
You know, it's getting a lot of shit for the free-to-play thing, but you can just buy it all at once too.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.000
So either one of those would be great.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Moving on. Dark Sakura.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Well, going in the same vein as talking about Animal Crossing, there's something that Reggie said in a recent interview actually coming out of E3 that has a lot of people really perking up.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:02.000
And that's that they were reviewing the Tomodachi Collection in Japan as far as localization.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:10.000
In fact, he was talking about the sort of casual game where you could play it in short bursts and pick it up at any given time.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:15.000
And that's why he's saying Tomodachi Collection, which anyone who doesn't know Tomodachi means friend.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:19.000
You know, saying that that would be definitely a title to consider.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:30.000
We're looking also into wanting to work with the retailers to make sure that they can provide the games in the best format possible.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.000
So that's even including digital or physical.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Hmm. What do you think about these comments?

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:41.000
I would like to see Tomodachi Collection. I mean, if I had a Wii U I would be interested.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:46.000
That was the same game that we were talking about the other week that had the bug where you could get gay married in it.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Yeah.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Yeah. It sounded interesting because especially with Animal Crossing being as big as it is.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
I would have married my lesbian.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Who wouldn't?

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.000
I shipped my little kid and the lesbian.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
Of course you did. Of course I did.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Have you seen Reggie's house in Animal Crossing, by the way?

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.000
No.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Comedy. Google it. It's funny.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:11.000
So someone posted like a picture a while back of say, Oh, your house is top notch, blah, blah, blah.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:17.000
And you go inside the person's house and saw skeletons and wallpaper that says, you will die.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
That was the best.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
That's awesome.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:29.000
So, yeah, I mean, that was the big thing that I really wanted to point out with this article is it's got a lot of people jumping on it because people really want to see Tomodachi Collection come out over here.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:33.000
And he's basically saying, yeah, we're considering it. It's a possibility.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:36.000
All right. Loki, what do you have for us?

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:42.000
All right. Well, there's a rumor that they're going to bring game sharing to Steam.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:46.000
And this is actually coming from the beta update files.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Someone has gone through there and apparently it makes reference to some different, I guess, pop up dialog boxes.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:15.000
For example, it says shared game library and says, just so you know, your games are your games are currently in use by, you know, person that's borrowing and playing now will send whoever's borrowing a notice that it's time to quit.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:21.000
And this shared game is currently unavailable. Please try again later or buy this game for your own library.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:35.000
So it sounds like that, you know, if you have a library of a ton of games that you're just not playing, that other people can access those games and play them, which, like any Steam user, probably that library would be very expansive.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:47.000
There's probably going to be you're probably going to be able to play any game you want on there because, I mean, shit, I have like 100 some games and I probably play about six of them.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:57.000
So we'll see if this is something that actually implementing, you know, coming to a Steam beta near you, maybe.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:03.000
I don't know. Do you think that maybe there's something that was being developed in response to Xbox one and now it's like, yeah, we'll do it anyway.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:09.000
I want to say I heard the earlier rumors about this long before Xbox one, though, I think they could do something like this.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:25.000
I think it would be interesting as reselling and you reselling your games, like, say, I don't know, through like Steam or how you can actually put it up on the marketplace and stuff like that and maybe have the original creator get a portion of the profit from it or something.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Maybe like they pay like you pay like a 10 percent fee or something and, you know, whoever buys it, you know, that fee goes to the person that put the game up there.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
I think that'd be kind of cool.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:43.000
All right. What we're going to do here before we get into the next story, we're going to take a quick break.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:49.000
And what we're going to do for the live folks, we're going to reset our routers here in the house to hopefully get a better connection.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:53.000
We're just going to try it because right now it's pretty miserable right now for the live listeners.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:59.000
So we're going to go down one more time, live folks, but this one is planned and we'll be back in just a few minutes.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.000
And for those of you guys listening on the podcast, you'll just hear that little musical interlude.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.000
And we'll be right back with more news right after this.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:15.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, blood.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:21.000
OK. We should be back with Orange Lounge Radio live here at The Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Just a little bit of technical background. Maybe the podcast folks would be interested in this, too.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:34.000
The way we have it set up here in the apartment is that we have the main router and the cable modem are in the office.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:41.000
And then we actually have a second router out here in the living room, which everything is tied to, including the show computer.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:46.000
What we've done is we've actually, to try and fix the problem, we have bypassed the living room router completely.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:51.000
It's actually unplugged now. That was a crossover router. So it's still the same network.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Alan knows more about this stuff than I do. So we've actually taken the connection and plugged it into the main router directly.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
I can give you a switch instead of just the router.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Is Alan here to translate?

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:09.000
I just want to let people know that the router that we have in the living room is in switch mode or bridge mode.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:13.000
So it's not doing its own set of NAT addresses because that's bad.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:19.000
So it's just bridging the cable into the office router. But now we're bypassing that altogether.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:22.000
So hopefully that'll fix it.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Alright, well we'll see how long we can hold the connection. I've got the little clock here.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Otherwise I have like three switches at home.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Yeah, we might need to look into something like that. I mean, luckily the cord is long enough we can do that.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:39.000
It's just really ugly and unattractive. But if this fixes the problem, then we'll just do this in future weeks and replace that router when we can.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:45.000
But we'll see what happens. Let's just keep on moving forward with the show, even though I've been drinking.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:53.000
And this next story would have driven me to drink anyway. It has to do with Miyamoto talking about the F-Zero franchise.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
And it's not what we want to hear.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
In an interview with IGN, he said, quote,

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:00.000
I certainly understand that people want a new F-Zero game.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:07.000
I think where I struggle is that I don't really have a good idea for what's new that we could bring to F-Zero that would really turn it into a great game again.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Certainly I can see how people looking at Mario Kart 8 could see through the anti-gravity, a connection to F-Zero.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:17.000
But I don't know at this point what direction we could go in with the new F-Zero.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:22.000
You take F-Zero, GX, make it prettier, add more tracks, done.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
Rainbow Road, Rainbow Road, Rainbow Road.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Right? That's Mario Kart, silly. Although, it would be neat to have a crossover.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:28.000
Yes.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:29.000
But, uh, yeah.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Well, no, that's actually what I was saying is put, like, the whole Rainbow Road thing, do, like, Rainbow Track or something, or Rainbow Space or whatever.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:45.000
More of the same would actually be okay. I mean, we were just talking about Ridge Racer earlier.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:55.000
GX was awesome. It was a fantastic game. There's not really much you can really improve on that, other than more tracks, because, you know, that's always good, and, you know, better visuals.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:00.000
I mean, it could look really cool, like, almost like a Wipeout game or something like that, you know?

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Just make it, think of what the visuals could look like. It'd be amazing.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Track Editor would be even better, too.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:15.000
I, I forgot about this. BlackWolfInChat says, there was a Rainbow Road in F-Zero X. It was the exact same track as Mario Kart 64, just a lot faster.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:21.000
I, I, you know, F-Zero X, I don't think I played nearly as much of, because I didn't have a 64 until late.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Uh, then I did the GameCube one, which was amazing.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Which, which base question, then, are we gonna see F-Zero GX tracks in Mario Kart 8?

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:30.000
Maybe.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Show me your moves.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Uh, DarkTetsuya says, oh, I don't know, how about online play? That would take Nintendo understanding online.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Nintendo doesn't admit online exists.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Which is a whole, whole nother Oprah.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:49.000
The equivalent of Nintendo online is them sticking their fingers in their ears, closing their eyes, and going, lalalalala.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Alright, let's jam through these next few stories, because we're running long because of all these tech issues and everything else.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
So, Dark Sakura, and then release dates.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Well, um, this is actually a story that came from my honey.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Uh, there was, I don't know if everyone remembers the big claim about, uh, for Madden, about, uh, Robin Antonic, who was, uh, one of the, uh, I believe one of the designers for the original Madden series, um, was owed quite a bit of royalties.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:23.000
Well, they've, uh, basically stated that that case has not expired, and this guy still do a whole bunch of money.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:35.000
I filed the original suit in 2011, um, that claimed that EA breached contract signed in 1986 for royalties on derivative versions of the game, and they're basically saying, nope, you still owe you money.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:38.000
They gotta pay. Oopsie, eh, blah.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:44.000
So, he owes money. He's owed money. EA has to suck it.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Well, cool, at least, uh, we'll see that trial go. I wonder if that could mean anything to the Madden NFL franchises. They'll just say, you know, we're gonna change the name or something.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
They'll have to do whatever-

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Like Madden's relevant.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Yeah. John matters. They'll do whatever they have to do to save it. We'll see.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
EA football, 2014.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Alright, release dates. Loki.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:18.000
This week is actually some decent stuff coming out. Game of Wario was today on the Wii U. This week, Deadpool, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.000
I need this game.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:30.000
Yes, Deadpool will be coming out. Also, uh, what else was there? There was the Company of Heroes 2 on PC. Muramasa Rebirth on the Vita.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:40.000
You get an expansion for The Sims 3 Island Paradise. Also, Best of PlayStation Network Volume 1 on PS3.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:51.000
So, disc-based release was at Fat Princess, Sound Shapes, and I don't remember the other two games in there, but it looked pretty cool.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:28:07.000
PC, Leisure Suit Larry Reloaded, Vita and 3DS, Lego Legends of Chima, LaValle's Journey, Project X Zone on the 3DS, which is pretty awesome.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:12.000
I mean, that's that Namco Sega Atlas crossover, I want to say.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:23.000
And then, also this week, of course, a game I'm actually going to try to check out, Ride the Hell Retribution on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:33.000
It's a game from Deep Silver, a biker sandbox game set in the 70s. It's like The Lost and the Damned all over again. That's it.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Alright, I am traveling over to Japan right now. Let's get on a plane. Let's go. Check out the release dates over there.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:49.000
And, um, going, excuse me, tequila burp. Alright, let's start with the PlayStation.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.000
You had one shot.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:29:01.000
I know, right? I am a sad lightweight. I tried to tell you this earlier, right? Like, one Long Island Iced Tea and I'm, like, taking my top off. I swear, it's horrific.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Alright, PlayStation 3 over in Japan. Atler, Escha, and Laji, Tasogari, Nosora, Norenken, Jusushi.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:14.000
I don't know if that's related to the Atler collection we're getting here in the US very soon, probably.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:19.000
Also on the PlayStation 3 this week, June 27th. There's a lot of shit this week, you guys.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Date A Live skin seal set for PlayStation 3. What?

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Oh, a skin seal. That's just controller stuff. You have to, it sounds a little dirty when you hear that, though.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
I thought it was, like, another porn title.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Alright. No, a date, the game is Date A Live, Rine Utopia comes out, and it's got school girls on the cover. You know what that means.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:44.000
Dating sim.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
Dating sim. Uh oh.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.000
She's holding her boobies.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Uh oh, that one's, oh my, that one is, that one is sucking on a creamsicle.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.000
Nice.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
She's, she's like 16, perv.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Hey, she's just drawn that way.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Gundam Breaker. Memories off 6 complete. The other game was panties off 6 complete. This is memories off 6 complete.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:11.000
And memories off Yubikiri no Kyoku. Also Biohazard 5, that's Resident Evil.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:16.000
AEN Revival selection, HD remaster twin pack. I believe that's a price reduction.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:21.000
The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim gets a price reduction over there as well.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:24.000
Tachishio Love Application.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:29.000
What the fuck is wrong with you guys over there and your games this week? You bunch of pervs.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:33.000
This one features ladies in swimming suits who are also underage.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:34.000
And this one-

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
It sounds, uh, seasonally appropriate.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:40.000
This one has a cattail, and you can see her panties. Look at that. This is, this is-

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Upskirt.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
And now she has a gun.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
Oh, don't-

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Hmm.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Hey.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Wow, she's a-

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.000
That was a total camel toe.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
Alright.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Yeah, I don't know what to think about Playstation 3 releases in Japan this week, especially after I've had a whopping shot.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:59.000
Um.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
This is funny. Rob's just had a double.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
I have had two shots.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
I had three.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Hello.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:08.000
I had-

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
The only reason I'm stopping at two is because I got to drive.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
I had a gallbladder removed.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:20.000
Alright. On the Xbox 360, Grand Theft Auto 4, the complete edition, as well as Skyrim, uh, those are all getting price reductions.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:25.000
A new game, Sniper Ghost Warrior 2, uh, comes out this week on the Xbox 360.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:29.000
So, hey, how about it for 360 releases in Japan?

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:33.000
It's, it's about time that Japan, you know, can shoot Hitler in the balls.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.000
On the Playstation Vita-

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Well, we haven't had a Japanese game kill Hitler since, what, Bionic Commando?

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:41.000
On the Playstation Vita, Tukaidan comes out this week.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:51.000
Uh, also Sengoku Hime 2, Tenka Hato, Shishino Keishusha comes out in regular and luxury limited edition this week.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
And what is this game?

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:56.000
Again, ladies that look like they're dressed for the military this time.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
I swear, any fetish you got, they got it this week.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
It's probably high school something.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
In the military?

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.000
I don't know.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:10.000
3DS this week, uh, Starry Sky in summer 3D, and Digimon World, redigitize, decode.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Digimon game!

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:13.000
Yay!

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:14.000
In case you were worried that Digimon-

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
Are we the Digimon fans in the room or what?

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
You're the Digimon fans on the planet, congratulations.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Hey!

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:23.000
Alright, let's travel to Europe.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:27.000
For the record, Digimon Zero 2 was the best of the Digimon series, just sayin'.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
Digimon greater than Pokemon, just sayin'.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Totally greater than.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Ugh, sacrilege.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:32.000
Ugh!

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:36.000
So, um, on June 25th we have Company of Heroes 2 on PC.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:43.000
And on the 20th we have Dark for PC, Deadpool on Xbox 360, PS3, and PC.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:49.000
We have Game & Wario on the Wii U, and Ride to Hell, Xbox 360, PS3, and PC.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:52.000
And hopefully it's better than Drag Me to Hell, because that movie was shit.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
Tiara made me see that movie.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Damn you, Tiara.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
It was- I didn't pay for it, so we'll neither to cheat, but-

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:00.000
Oh, okay, well thank you, Tiara.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:04.000
It was still an awful movie, and I love Sam Raimi, and that was a bad movie.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.000
Loki.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:09.000
Alright.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:15.000
Um, so let's talk a little bit about bad firmware, and nobody likes bad firmware.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:20.000
Especially bad firmware that's pushed out on the PlayStation 3 that kind of bricks consoles.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:28.000
Um, thankfully there is a way to fix your console, because I guess somehow it removed your cross-media bar

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:29.000
or something like that.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:30.000
That's a problem.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:31.000
No menu.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:36.000
Um, and you can actually boot your console into a recovery mode or debug mode or something,

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:44.000
and allow you to re-download the update when it is released again on Thursday, on June 27th.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:49.000
And I guess it's a small number of PS3s that are affected by it, but any number is still bad.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:58.000
Um, and if you haven't updated your console like myself, it's good to note that they have

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:05.000
taken off the bad firmware off the network right now until the update is released, because

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:09.000
I just updated to 4.41, so.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Uh, that sucks.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Thankfully, though, it doesn't sound like there's any permanent damage.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:19.000
It's just a minor, week-long inconvenience.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Blesses of you.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Well, I have not turned on my PlayStation 30, or 3, my PlayStation 30.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Rob our speech goods.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.000
I was talking in chat, I was giving Drewnami a hard time, because I said,

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.000
God, he's gotta be pushing 30, and he's like, fuck you, I'm 28.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:39.000
One shot at tequila.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:43.000
I remember, I remember Drewnami being our young Republican.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Mhm.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:47.000
Oh, how things have changed.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Mhm.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Alright, moving on to a story about Final Fantasy XII, which was a really overlooked

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Final Fantasy game.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.000
I overlooked it.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:57.000
It just came out at a bad time.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
I own it, and I overlooked it.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:02.000
It came out at a time when a lot of people had moved on to other consoles.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Well, this is really exciting news.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:09.000
In an interview with the site, RPG site, it's a very descriptive name, you know what you're

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:10.000
gonna get when you go there.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Producer Yoshinori Kitase, who's producing Final Fantasy X and X-2 HD, was asked about,

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:23.000
what about other games coming to these HD?

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:28.000
And, quote, we'll have to wait and see if these remasters are going to be successful first.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:33.000
If they do well, I think this will pave the way for more of the previous games to be remade

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
in an HD sort of quality.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:39.000
I mean, if we had to single out one of the vast number of Final Fantasy titles which

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:43.000
we could make in HD, it would have to be Final Fantasy XII.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Yes!

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
Bothier and Fran in HD.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:47.000
Yes!

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:48.000
Can't wait.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.000
There's VII, hello.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:54.000
And yeah, VII wasn't the greatest game, but Vincent, hello.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
You just want Ares to die.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
I want Aerith to die repeatedly.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
1080p Aerith death.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
1080p Aerith death, oh my god.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:06.000
It would have to have, like, blood particle physics and everything.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
That's the problem though with bringing VII.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:13.000
VII, it was so low poly that, you know, to up-res it's gonna look like crap.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:17.000
And also, you know, with, you know, I think these PlayStation 2 games are a little easier

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:22.000
to do the HD remakes, plus they've got, you know, PlayStation 2 emulation engines already

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:26.000
built that they can just dump it in, up-res the assets, and they're done.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:27.000
I hope they do it.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.000
High-res Aerith.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
I would really love XII in HD.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:31.000
I really hope they do it.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
High-res Aerith death.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:34.000
All right.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
And high-res Vincent, hello.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Are you done salivating over there?

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Because it's time to go back when games weren't in HD.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:42.000
God dammit.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:46.000
Although, well, actually this one kind of did do an HD thing later.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.000
Yeah, it did.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Anyway, we're gonna look back at the classic-ness of this upcoming game here.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:55.000
In the segment we call Classic Game of the Week, where Dark Soccer's gonna jump into the gaming vault

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:59.000
and find a game that she thinks, hey, you should be playing this game.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
Get off my lawn and play this game.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:06.000
And for our 11th birthday, Dark Soccer has picked a game that's about 11 years old.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.000
Pretty much.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:11.000
But it's one that's very fond, I think a good choice to mark our 11th birthday.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.000
Yep.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:13.000
So you wanna know what it is, everyone?

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Of course I do.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.000
Res, motherfuckers.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
Why couldn't I pick Res?

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:21.000
I haven't done Res the entire 11 damn years of the show.

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:22.000
I picked Res tonight.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:25.000
And I think I put it up on a boss battle on the last-

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Mostly because Res wasn't really an old game until now.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:35.000
Well, you know, I was going with Dreamcast era and yet I didn't have a PS2 re-release.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:43.000
So anyway, Res came up when it was developed as under the codenames AK Project, Project Eden, and Vibes.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:48.000
It's a rail shooter that came out by Sega in 2001 for Dreamcast and PS2

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:53.000
and it had a European Dreamcast and a US PS2 release in 2002.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:01.000
The game was the dream child of one Tetsuya Mizuguchi and you know what?

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
Who I still fanboy over.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:09.000
Like, if I fanboy over anybody, it's Mizuguchi and it's- I even defended 99 Nights, y'all.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
He mentioned his name, I need new one of these, okay?

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Yeah.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:14.000
Excuse me.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:21.000
And there is a prequel that came out, of course, called Child of Eden, which comes from the name Project Eden that they have.

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:31.000
So anyway, it's sort of a super futuristic network called the K Project and you have to stop an AI called Eden.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
Excuse me, I'm sorry guys, I'm so sick.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:43.000
So basically you are a hacker trying to basically reboot Eden and destroy viruses and firewalls.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:47.000
And it's basically music, lights, and a vibrator.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
Or does it get much better than that?

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Excuse me.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:55.000
And of course, like any tech person would know, to fix a problem you have to reboot.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
Do you want me to take over? Are you okay?

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
Yeah, if you don't mind just for a second.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:01.000
Okay.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Hold on, I wasn't prepared to talk about Rez, but I could just wing it a little bit while Dark Sakura's having a thing there.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Okay.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:14.000
So in the game, of course, it's a rail shooter, right?

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:18.000
You play the role of an avatar on the screen and so it's a shooter on rails.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:21.000
So fable the journey, not on rails.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Rez on rails.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:30.000
You lock onto the different enemies on the screen and you can lock onto up to eight enemies with what they call the reticule.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:34.000
Once you release the lock on button, you fire your shots all over.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:41.000
And if you don't hit an enemy or projectile, you may actually collide, which will cause your evolution bar to go down by one.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:44.000
And it'll actually change the way your avatar looks like.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:49.000
If the avatar gets to the lowest possible level and you get hit again, you die.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:50.000
Dead.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Oh, you're back.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.000
Good day, sir.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:53.000
All right.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:54.000
I had to go pull my nose because it's the whole problem.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Are you going to keep going or?

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:56.000
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Okay.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:58.000
What about the overdrive though, Rob?

01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.000
What about it?

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:03.000
Well, you can get power-ups as you go, like you were talking about the evolution bar.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:06.000
And you can get another item that triggers an overdrive.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:11.000
So basically it's a huge, it's basically like the Rez version of the super zapper from Tempest.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:14.000
It just kills everything in a big shower of everything.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:19.000
And also, um, you get like bonus items for your score and everything.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:24.000
So basically you have five areas and the first four are ten subsections of the boss battle.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:30.000
And the final one is like a boss rush within you battle Eden for the final one.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:35.000
Um, it has no sound effects or spoken dialogue.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:36.000
It's all music.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:37.000
Everything is music.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:45.000
So for being in a rail shooter, this one's also been lumped in, in the music game genre.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:49.000
And then that brings me to the trance vibrator.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:52.000
Oh, what should I say?

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Buzz.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:41:02.000
There's the funniest video of a guy and his girlfriend playing Rez, which basically him playing Rez and her playing with vibrator.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:07.000
Um, it was, um, called the trance vibrator.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:12.000
It pulses with the music and it would be something that you would put in your pocket or sit on.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:17.000
It had a power in your butt.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
It came with a pouch.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:22.000
You could put it in to protect it.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:25.000
Not unlike the we condom.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:29.000
So the trans vibrator came with a condom pretty much.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:35.000
It's actually a fabric bag, but basically it would vibrate in time with the music.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:38.000
However, the dual shock was actually supposed to be stronger than that.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:46.000
I think a screw attack brings it as the number one best gaming peripheral ever.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:53.000
And basically there were other versions of it that you could buy an aftermarket.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:59.000
It was also compatible with Space Channel 5 Part 2 and the Japanese version of Disaster Report.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:03.000
I had no idea that you could use the trance vibrator with Space Channel 5 Part 2 as well.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
That's amazing.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:08.000
So you could put Ulala in your butt.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:12.000
People have reverse engineered it to have it work on a PC.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:18.000
And they've gotten this to work in Japan where there is a driver out for XP and Windows 2000.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:22.000
There's also a driver that works for Linux kernel.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:30.000
The Xbox 360 version that came out recently, the Res HD, basically will have other controllers doing the trance vibration function.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:35.000
Can I say that when I got Res HD on 360, I actually did that with the controller.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:36.000
You actually put a controller in your pants?

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:37.000
No, I did not.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:43.000
But I did the thing that they suggested where you put one on your back and you lean against the chair and have that on your back.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:47.000
And then I think it said to put the other one not on your butt.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
That joke's over.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
I think you put the other one on your arms.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:52.000
I don't remember where they were.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:53.000
I put it in my bra.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.000
In your bra?

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
But it was weird.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
But fun.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:01.000
Well, speaking of...

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:04.000
And consensual. Most importantly, it was consensual.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Well, actually, this is an interesting thing.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:11.000
The game itself won an award from the Agency for Cultural Affairs Media Art Festival in Japan.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:19.000
It was also one of the Dreamcast games that was chosen to be at the Smithsonian American Art Museum 2012 edition, the art of video games.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:23.000
If only they knew that you could put that trans vibrator in your butt, then I don't think it would be at the Smithsonian.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
Rob!

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
Oh my god, Rob.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:39.000
Anyway, Res HD came out for Xbox Live Arcade as Rob was talking about his exploits with the trans vibrator controller and his pants.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:43.000
My back. When did I start wearing pants on my back, Jamie?

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:46.000
My back. He means butt.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Don't be a bitch.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:52.000
After five minutes, I was like, let's go.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:59.000
Anyway, basically, Mizuguchi says it's 100% the same as the Dreamcast version.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:08.000
And to do a new version, he would actually have to get the license from Sega because he actually did it as a contractor.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:15.000
There were no plans for 360-compatible trans vibrator peripheral because everyone would put it in their butt.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:22.000
Or cooch, or cooch. Not everyone is into butt play.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:30.000
So, yeah, Res HD came out on January 30th, 2008, and it was included with the Cube Company.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:33.000
You could just rest it there on your hoo-ha, and I'm sure it would be just a good old time.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:34.000
You know what, Rob?

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:35.000
What?

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:40.000
We don't discuss my hoo-ha on the show.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Eleven episodes, and my hoo-ha has yet to have any bearing on any video game.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
Eleven episodes? How much have you had to drink?

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:48.000
Five hundred and nine.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
I've had two shots, okay?

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:51.000
Yeah.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:55.000
Rob's over here going, whoa, I'm drunk, and I'm like, oh, I just felt it.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Now you're feeling it in your hoo-ha.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:01.000
You know what, it takes a lot more than two shots of tequila for me to feel it in my hoo-ha, okay?

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:05.000
To register participation for this week's episode, use the password hoo-ha.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
Ignore that. Ignore that. It's not hoo-ha.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:08.000
That's not the true word.

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:13.000
But anyway, the Cubes compilation came out with Luminous Live and Every Extent Extra Extreme.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:19.000
And Mizuguchi was saying that there's no reason to not provide it on other platforms other than the Xbox 360.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:25.000
And it was voted the 13th best Xbox Live arcade game of all time by IGN in 2010.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:29.000
Other games that have come out that are related were Audio Surf.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:32.000
Child of Eden, as I said, was a spiritual successor.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:37.000
There's Is, I guess it's how it's pronounced, and Vibribin.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:43.000
Vibribin is crack, and if you don't know about it, tune in to a bajillion episodes ago, where I talked about it.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
What was it, like five years ago that brought up Vibribin?

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
Yeah, Vibribin's old.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Yeah, it's so sister.

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Everything I talk about's old.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
It has nothing to do with my hoo-ha.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Rob, for being, I'm almost questioning your sexuality now.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
He turns straight when he gets drunk. It's fine.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
I've seen him kiss a girl when he was drunk.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Last week on Orange Lounge Radio, it has nothing to do with my hoo-ha!

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
Damn right, lady. All right.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Rob's actually kind of pink in the face. It's adorable.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:20.000
You know us here at Microsoft think that's a great catchphrase.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Rob, you had a double shot.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Okay, yeah. To be fair, I had a double shot.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:29.000
You had a double shot. I had a single, and then I had another single dumped in my orange juice.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
Thank you, Alan!

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:36.000
We are, for the back here, very muted.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
You're welcome.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:39.000
All right.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:42.000
We are not, we are not doing, what's the word?

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
Just think about all those live listeners.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:47.000
We are not hashtagging hoo-ha for the chat.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:50.000
Just think of all the live listeners that left early because they were like,

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:53.000
fuck it, I can't stand these connection problems and left.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
They're missing the hoo-ha chat.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
Well, it was a big change from our dick and fart jokes.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:01.000
Now it's hoo-ha and queef jokes.

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
Wait, who started the queef jokes?

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
There's a queef joke?

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:08.000
I'm trying to think of other things that go with dick and fart.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:12.000
If dick and fart would be the male version, then hoo-ha and queef would be the male version.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Hey, you know what? It's all about gender equality, so.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:18.000
I had an equal opportunity stinker.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Oh my God.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:27.000
And that's the classic game of the week. Res.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
You want to know what I just remembered, Rob?

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
I also had a shot of Robitussin before I left for the show.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
Are you going to be okay to drive home?

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
It's the tussin that does it.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
It's the tussin and tequila.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
It wasn't the Patron that did it.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
It was the Robitussin.

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:42.000
I call it test tequila.

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:43.000
There it is.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
I was like, is that bottle gone?

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
That bottle's halfway gone.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:48.000
I'm up to my fourth shot.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:51.000
It took six years for me to finish mine that you got me when I turned 30.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:53.000
Okay?

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
It's not Queef Latifah.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
There it is, your classic.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:01.000
Your classic.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:03.000
Can I finish?

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:04.000
Bite me.

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:05.000
Can I finish? Can I finish?

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:06.000
No.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
That's your classic game of the week.

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Use this dark sacra for Orange Lodge Radio and suck it.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Res, your classic game of the week featuring the trans vibrator on Yahuah.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:20.000
Alright.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
That does it for part A.

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:27.000
But stay tuned because there's plenty more to come with rapid fire news,

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:32.000
the frugal question of the week, mailbag, FUs of the week, and who knows what.

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
O.L.R. is drunk. Go home.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:36.000
Oh lordy.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:37.000
Alright, stay tuned guys.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:40.000
We'll be back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:48.000
Hi there. This is Captain Spike.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:49.000
And First Mate Slagkick.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
From Gamebooey.org.

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:52.000
Gamebooey.org.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:56.000
And you're participating with Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:59.000
And we want to use our voice to tell you support indie broadcasting

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:02.000
and congratulations to Orange Lounge Radio on 11 wonderful years.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:03.000
Congratulations.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:04.000
Congratulations.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
Congratulations.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
Congratulations.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:12.000
Oh my god. We're gonna see.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
Yeah, isn't First Mate Slagkick here next week?

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:15.000
I think so.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:16.000
He better be.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Oh my god, I got sent a picture of a ferret.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:22.000
That is the cutest thing I've seen all day.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:27.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio Part B.

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
Our 11th anniversary episode.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
It's been a very weird night so far.

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:35.000
Obviously, with the live feed, it was going up and down in Part A.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:38.000
We think we fixed it. Knock on wood, hopefully.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
And then we were having all those problems.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
Then Jamie started talking about her hoo-ha.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:45.000
You started talking about my hoo-ha. Hello.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
It was Jamie's hoo-ha that caused the feed to go down.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
It got started on your ass.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
Hold on, I gotta pour myself another shot.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
Oh, you're gonna have another shot?

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:55.000
I'm from New York.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:56.000
We get drunk.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:57.000
It's not fair. I want another one.

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
I have a double shot here of Patron.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
Rob, can I sleep on your couch?

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
I gotta get up at 6.30. That's the only thing I'm saying.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:06.000
Although Alan will be here later, so I guess.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:07.000
No, I can't.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
Okay, good. Just be responsible.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:10.000
Alright.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:11.000
Fuck that.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
Here we go. Heads up. Happy 11 years.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Yay.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
Alright. And one, two, three.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:21.000
Oh, I forgot to vine it.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
Oh, Rob is so funny. He's just doing the complete-

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
He's dying right now.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:26.000
Oh my God.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:28.000
Rob has to run around the room-

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:29.000
It doesn't even burn.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:32.000
I know, but it's that warmth is so freaky to me.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
Rob has to run around the room and do flappy hands.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:37.000
I'm trying to contain it to my chair right now. I'm fine.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
What were you talking about during the commercial?

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:40.000
I wanna talk about it on air. Oh.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:41.000
We were talking about-

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:42.000
Butt.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:43.000
No, we were not talking about-

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
My butt on break, Dark Sakura. Stop being a potty mouth.

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:46.000
Alright.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
I don't know. I wasn't here. I was in the bathroom.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:52.000
We were talking about restaurants that you can't eat back east, right?

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:55.000
So earlier, before the show, we had to go get food.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:56.000
We went to Jack in the Box, which-

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
You don't have Jack in the Box back east?

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
No, not- at least not in New York.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
I don't know about like down south on the east coast,

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
but in New York, there's no Jack in the Box.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
In my experience in the south, there was one Jack in the Box.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:09.000
It was in my birth town of Dothan, Alabama,

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
and it got closed for food poisoning.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:14.000
And what were you excited about to find at Jack in the Box?

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:15.000
Breakfast all day.

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:19.000
It's pretty amazing. I do like Jack in the Box.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:20.000
They have a diverse menu.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:21.000
But you know what they don't have out here?

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:22.000
Huh?

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Hardee's. And Carl's Jr. is not the same.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:25.000
Sorta is, though.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:26.000
No, not really.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Alright, well-

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:30.000
You cannot get buttermilk biscuits at our fried chicken.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Dunkin' Donuts is what I want out here. We don't have Dunkin' Donuts here.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:34.000
I want Waffle House.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:37.000
You can have Dunkin' Donuts. I'll take back Jack in the Box.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
I like Jack in the Box, though. You can have-

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:40.000
They're gonna deep fry their tacos.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:41.000
They're gonna deep fry their tacos.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:44.000
I think In-N-Out is a little bit overrated, so you can have In-N-Out.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
How gladly say In-N-Out.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:47.000
I want Waffle House.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:51.000
And I'm just noticing it's taken, what, Part B for us to start talking about food?

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
And, and, and. You know what else I want from back east?

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:56.000
It's because we talked about liquor in Part A, and then you know what?

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:57.000
I want Crystal's.

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:58.000
Huh?

01:51:58.000 --> 01:51:59.000
Because of the Corn Pots.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:00.000
I don't even know what that is.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:03.000
Crystal's is kinda like White Castle-sized hamburgers.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:06.000
They're really teeny. You get like, you know, four for something.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:10.000
But you can also get corn, uh, these little tiny corn dogs that are called Corn Pups.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
And they're so good. I don't know why-

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:15.000
Doesn't A&W have those little Corn Pups? I think they do.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
I don't know. I haven't been to A&W in forever, but-

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:18.000
Yeah.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
Well, they're all A&W KFCs now. They're all hybrid.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
You know what made me super happy?

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:27.000
And it's a totally southern thing, but going to a gas station and getting fried chicken liver.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:32.000
Uh, in my time back east, when I think of gas stations, I think of Wawa.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:36.000
That's- that's- that's a gas- well, the convenience- huge convenience stores, anyway.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:40.000
But anyway, I guess that's for another, uh, another night.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:43.000
Uh, we gotta get back into video games. This is already a long show.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
Uh, internet problems aside.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
So, rapid fire news time. Loki!

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:50.000
Fez is not coming to the Xbox.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:55.000
Uh, because apparently they don't like the lack of indie support.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:53:01.000
Also, basically saying, you know, um, they're not sure if they're gonna come to the PlayStation 4.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:05.000
Although, it's tempting. It's still too early to tell how everything's going to unfold.

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:09.000
But, their hearts definitely seem to be in the right place.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:13.000
Uh, whether or not I would- would develop for it comes down to how the PlayStation platform-

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
or how the platform holder treats me.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:19.000
With Microsoft, they made it painfully clear they don't want my ilk on their platform.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:22.000
I can't even self-publish there, whereas PS4, I can.

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
That's simple. Or, it's that simple.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:27.000
Microsoft won't let me develop for their console, but Sony will.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:35.000
So, I guess we just won't see Fez 2 on the Xbox 1 unless they completely change their platform.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
And that's unfortunately a lot of the things I've been hearing.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:41.000
Although, I'm wondering if they're gonna flip that around too, come, you know.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:47.000
Yeah, I was gonna say, this whole indie rabble rabble is not looking good for Microsoft.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
But, yeah, who knows? Who knows?

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:53.000
Um, Drunami in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:56.000
The guy behind Fez is a goddamn twat, though. Fuck him.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:59.000
To be fair, yes. Yes. That is true.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Um, so, yes, uh, Xbox Live Gold. Remember, they're giving away those free games.

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:09.000
There's a whole bunch of asterisks to that, though.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:12.000
The free games, yes, they are being put out.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:17.000
However, you have to download them within the two-week time frame, I believe.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:22.000
Um, at least that's the way with Fable 3. You have to download it by July.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
Otherwise, you can't download it anymore.

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:29.000
And, now there's gonna be new games coming out the 1st and 16th of, um, each month.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:33.000
Uh, with next month being Halo 3 and Assassin's Creed 2.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:40.000
Um, and I'm wondering if that's gonna still be the same as, uh, it was with Fable 3.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:44.000
Where you have to download it within those first two weeks that it's available.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
Otherwise, you can't download it again.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Someone was saying that it might not be that way, but I think it's gonna be that way.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:56.000
It's kind of a lame, I guess, way to get you to subscribe to live if you're not already doing that.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:00.000
I mean, I am, so I guess I'll download those free games.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
I didn't, I downloaded Fable 3 just for the fuck of it.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:09.000
Halo 3, I already own. I guess I'll download it, Assassin's Creed 2, and give a shit about it.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:10.000
So, we'll see.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:13.000
Although, Crackdown. Crackdown would be pretty awesome to have in there.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:14.000
That's old enough, I would say.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:19.000
And, I can't find my disc for it anymore, so I'd love to, you know, have one of those.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:20.000
I liked Crackdown.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:21.000
Yeah, Crackdown was fun.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:25.000
Remember, most people were just buying it for the Halo 3 preview, but it ended up being pretty good.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
Yeah, I dig it.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:31.000
Crackdown was more fun when you just, like, add those codes where, like, you just randomly spawn anything,

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:34.000
and you're like, haha, I'm just spawning cars off a roof of a building!

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:40.000
Yeah, that's like the stuff Loki lives for, though, is the whole, like, you know, hilarious mod things.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:41.000
Keys to the City mode was awesome.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:46.000
I didn't play story mode in Crackdown. I just wanted to blow shit up and drop cars off the top of buildings.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:50.000
That's like Grand Theft Auto. Like, I, the story in Grand Theft Auto, who gives a shit?

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:54.000
It's really good, though. Speaking of which, have you played Grand Theft Auto IV yet?

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:57.000
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. That's what I thought.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:01.000
No. I haven't.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:04.000
Have you finished Saints Row III, at least?

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:07.000
No, I haven't finished it, but I have at least played a good chunk of that.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:11.000
That game's hilarious. The funniest, I haven't laughed my ass off that hard in a long time.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
For just a moment, you sounded like Greg Proops.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
Okay. Are you sure you're not drunk?

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:22.000
No, your voice had that sort of quality that was Proops-like.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
I'm not sure I'd hate it. Did you do your third story?

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
No, I haven't gotten a chance to do that yet.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:27.000
Sorry, go ahead.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:36.000
And then finally, this is pretty awesome, they are doing a free DLC update for Surgeon Simulator 2013.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:39.000
That, of course, is going to add in Team Fortress 2 stuff.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:47.000
So you get to play as the doctor there, and also you get to work, or the medic, and you get to work on the heavy.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:51.000
And that's awesome.

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
Can you work on Sandvich?

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:59.000
You should actually just pick that up anyways, because it's awesome.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:04.000
Alright, on the Xbox 360, there is now a Best of Disney app.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:10.000
And no, that doesn't mean like, you know, there are games like Connect Adventure, Disney, or whatever that thing was called.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:13.000
But trailers, clips, and animated shorts.

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:17.000
Oh, I hope they have that short that they had before Wreck-It Ralph with the paper planes. That was so good.

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:18.000
Paperman.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:19.000
Thank you, Paperman.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:23.000
Anyway, all that is available on the Best of Disney app.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
It's a free download for gold subscribers.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:28.000
There's content from Disney Channel, Disney XD, and Walt Disney Studios.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:33.000
I imagine the trailers and the little stuff is free. Some of the other stuff, less free.

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:37.000
Xbox One and Google and Bing.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:43.000
Hilarious little meme going around right now where folks, you know that predictive searching? I'm sure you've all played with this.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:44.000
This is going around Tumblr for...

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:48.000
Hey, if you go to Google and do a predictive search, you type Orange Lounge.

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:51.000
It comes right out of Orange Lounge Radio. It's right there in the predictive search.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:52.000
This is pretty awesome.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:53.000
Because we're awesome.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
And I think we've talked about this before. I think it's still the case.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:58:00.000
If you go and you type Orange Lounge Radio, predictive search brings up Orange Lounge Radio Marissa.

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:03.000
Who isn't even a host to the show.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:07.000
But she's infamous. So there you go. But she's great. And I'm totally okay with that.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
I totally miss Marissa.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:12.000
I do too. God, I was just in L.A. too and I didn't have a chance to see her.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:20.000
But anyway, predictive searching on Google. If you search for The Xbox One is, it will come up and say terrible, ugly, a joke.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:24.000
But you go to Bing and it says The Xbox One is amazing.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:29.000
Well, some people took this one step further and started searching for things like Android and things like that.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:33.000
And it's kind of interesting. Like on Google, it does something very similar.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:38.000
So who knows what it is. I'm actually looking right now to see if the same thing happens.

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:42.000
Oh yeah, if I type The Xbox One is on Google, it is terrible, ugly, a joke.

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:47.000
You know, in my mind, how many people are really using Bing?

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:48.000
You're probably...

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Everybody says Microsoft.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:51.000
Actually...

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
You're probably a little bit of a Microsoft fanboy to begin with.

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:59.000
I used Bing for about 10 minutes when they were giving away free live cards or no Xbox point cards.

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:03.000
And then I got like two $20 cards for Xbox Live and then I stopped using Bing forever.

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:06.000
They are still technically doing that. You just have to search on there.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:13.000
You know, make it a point to make some erroneous searches every day and then you can save up to get like five bucks worth of Xbox Live points.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:14.000
It just takes you about a month.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:17.000
So whatever, predictive searches. Hilarious.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:24.000
Lastly, on PlayStation 4, if you're a fan of DC Universe Online or PlanetSide 2, you may be worried,

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:29.000
am I going to have to get PlayStation Plus because now that's going to be required to do multiplayer?

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:32.000
Am I going to need to get PlayStation Plus to play these MMOs?

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:35.000
The answer is no. Pretty awesome.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:42.000
So yeah, you do not need to have PlayStation Plus if you want to play games like DC Universe Online and PlanetSide 2 online.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:43.000
Very cool.

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:49.000
PlanetSide 2, however, not cross-compatible between PC and PlayStation 4.

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:52.000
DC Universe Online, however, will remain so.

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:55.000
I think that's the way things are today, to be honest.

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
Except DCU was poopy.

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:00.000
We have some fans though. I know Pod Culture is a huge fan of that.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
You have a hate boner for DC to begin with.

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:07.000
No, I don't have a hate boner for DC. I have a hate boner for bad games and bad character development.

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
It's a hate hoo-ha, not a hate.

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
Rob?

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:12.000
What?

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:19.000
If Gail Simone wrote every book that DC did, I would read it.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:23.000
I thought DC Universe was fun enough, especially because it's free to play now.

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
I see the charm in DC Universe Online.

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:28.000
It's like Ninja Turtles arcade game, but you get to make your own hero.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:32.000
And you can make your hero as pretty as you want.

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:35.000
I didn't think it was very pretty at all.

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:40.000
You know what, the first thing I did was make myself a female version of Hawkeye.

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:44.000
All right. Black Wolf is correcting me in chat.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:48.000
DC Universe Online does not play PC versus PS3. I thought it did.

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
Huh. Well, all right, then I'm wrong.

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:53.000
But PS4 will work with PS3.

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:59.000
And I believe that he left it up for third parties doing free to play games like that,

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:03.000
that they can decide whether they want to have that behind the paywall or not.

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:06.000
I would imagine that if you're interested in getting more people to play your game,

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
probably not going to put that behind it.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:12.000
All right. All right, let's move on. Dark Sakura.

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:15.000
I was actually just about to point out in chat room that Gail Simone wrote Agent X,

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:18.000
which was a Deadpool book. Just saying, she's awesome.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
Extover is in chat, by the way. Hey, Extover.

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:22.000
Hey.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:25.000
Saying, didn't mind DCU, but it's easy to forget about.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:28.000
It was very easy to forget about after, like, playing it twice.

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:34.000
The flames of her hatred are burning intensely.

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:37.000
Flames on the side of my face?

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:38.000
No.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:39.000
All that shade.

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:42.000
I cannot touch the immortal Madeline Kahn.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:43.000
The shade of it all.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
You know, I don't even watch that show, so whatever.

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:47.000
You should.

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
Do you think I would totally dig the drag queens?

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:51.000
Uh, yeah.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
I love drag queens, don't get me wrong.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:54.000
Well, see. Anyway.

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
I just hate sitting down to watch a show.

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:59.000
I love doing video game news, which occasionally happens on this show.

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:00.000
You know what, bite me.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:03.000
You're the one who brought up the shade. Rab.

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:12.000
So anyway, Arc System Works, who brought us Guilty Gear, said that if people want to see Guilty Gear on the Wii U, then you have to sign a petition.

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
And the petition is online, and I'm not going to link it.

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:18.000
It runs on the Unreal 3 engine, so basically, whatever.

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:24.000
In other news, Sega has been teasing something called Project 575.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
We have no idea what it is.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:29.000
It could be a rhythm game. It could be nothing.

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:32.000
It could be, uh, looks like a couple of girls.

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:37.000
So who knows. Maybe you just spend the whole game being awesome. I don't know.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:42.000
And then, and this is the sad news. Rab.

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:43.000
Hmm.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:44.000
I'm very, very sad.

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:45.000
Well, what happened?

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:49.000
Well, you remember how we had been covering, um, the whole Knuckles Dawson?

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:50.000
Oh, yeah.

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
Disappearance? Well, they found him.

02:02:52.000 --> 02:03:00.000
Which, I mean, I think we pretty much knew it was a suicide issue for the fact that he cancelled his accounts.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:01.000
Mm-hmm.

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
And basically up and left.

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:04.000
Mm-hmm.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:11.000
But they, uh, found him, um, they're not releasing a cause of death yet. I mean, I'm pretty sure.

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:18.000
Well, and to be fair, even saying that is a little bit jump to conclusion because maybe in his mental unwell state, he may have just left.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:22.000
Maybe had a plan in mind, so we don't know, and we don't want to fill in the gaps.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:27.000
Yeah, but, well, I'm saying that current evidence is leading that way.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:28.000
Sure, sure, sure.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:33.000
Okay. Um, so, yeah, they, uh, they found his body. He was 28 years old.

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:34.000
That's very unfortunate.

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:43.000
And they found his bike and helmet in Stanley Park, and then, um, he left his wallet, computer, and phone at home.

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
But they found his body in the park across the bay, right?

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:46.000
Yeah.

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:49.000
So he was, he was on the move.

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
He left everything behind and left.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:04:02.000
Yeah, it's, um, it's, it's really too bad. And, um, it's just a reminder that, uh, if you know somebody that might be reaching out for help, please try to get them help.

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
Don't just write it off as an attention thing.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:05.000
Mm-hmm.

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:15.000
But make sure that you're not, okay, this is where I kind of say that's a line because, yeah, some people do want attention.

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:19.000
Some people are looking for attention because there's a reason for it.

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:20.000
Right.

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:23.000
And you see to it that they get help. Don't contribute to the underlying cause.

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:24.000
Mm-hmm.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:27.000
Um, I do want to call attention to this, too, because I think it's pretty neat.

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:36.000
Um, you know, one reason that Knuckles was very popular in the community is that he actually did one achievement a day every day on the 360 for, like, two or three years.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:37.000
Something like that.

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:38.000
It was, it was a significant amount of time.

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:43.000
Um, there's a call right now in a movement to try to get Microsoft to do an achievement in his honor.

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:47.000
Uh, some folks are saying even that day one achievement should, should have a tie-in to him.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:51.000
Uh, I think it would be great if Microsoft could do some sort of achievement in his honor.

02:04:51.000 --> 02:05:00.000
Uh, perhaps, you know, getting an achievement every day for a month or a week or something, something that would, uh, resonate with, you know, what he was known for in the community.

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:04.000
I think it would be a great, great thing and a great way to, um, uh, remember him.

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:09.000
Well, I'm also looking through the comments on here to see if they had any other information on here.

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:13.000
And basically the families already made a Facebook page about it releasing information.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:17.000
So, I would say check Facebook and look for your information there.

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:22.000
That, uh, fineknuckles.com redirects to his Facebook or not his Facebook.

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:25.000
The Facebook his family set up in regards to the issue.

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:26.000
It's just tragic.

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:27.000
But yeah.

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:30.000
SSJ100MattInChat says, regardless, this was a tragedy. Absolutely.

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:34.000
But I do really urge people, don't take it upon yourself to be the diagnosis.

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:38.000
Tell the person to seek diagnosis and just be available.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:39.000
Alright.

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
Well, let's shift gears here a little bit.

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:48.000
Let's take it to the listeners with a question and a, uh, segment we do here every week called the FUGL Question of the Week.

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:58.000
Facebook and Google, you take those words, you slam them together, you get FUGL.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:04.000
And the FUGL Question of the Week this week has to do with a Nintendo story.

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:17.000
And, uh, the Nintendo story that we link to, um, talks about how Nintendo is hiring more people to strengthen their internal development studios in the development of fan favorite franchises as well as new intellectual properties.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:26.000
But the question we asked on FUGL was, which do you hope that Nintendo focuses on more in the development of games for Wii U and 3DS?

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:31.000
Development of fan favorite franchise games or new IPs and why?

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:35.000
I was looking for people to kind of pick one or the other.

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:39.000
I'm not sure I was really clear in that question because we get a lot of answers where people are saying both.

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
I'll go ahead and read those answers anyway.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
Let's start on Google Plus tonight.

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:49.000
Act Dev says, well, it's kind of obvious that they're going to try to focus on the Wii U since they truly need games for that.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:56.000
Don't know if they'll be totally new IPs, but they'll probably incorporate new ideas into the franchises we know and love.

02:06:57.000 --> 02:07:04.000
And while we already have a new Smash Brothers on the way, I would love to see a new Metroid using the game pad and, of course, a new F-Zero and Kirby game.

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:09.000
Retertainment says, as has been said many times before, variety is the spice of life.

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:13.000
If you do the same things over and over again, eventually those things get tiresome, dated, and boring.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:16.000
However, we are talking about a corporation here.

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:22.000
Corporations live by one mantra. Cash rules everything around me. Cream.

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:28.000
While I may want newer IPs in order to get a more diverse gaming landscape, older IPs sell better.

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:33.000
Therefore, even though I want new IPs, old IPs are probably what I'm going to get.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:40.000
That's a good answer that kind of tells me what you want that kind of keeps the real side in it.

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:45.000
I like that answer. I think you are right. Well, I think a lot of these answers are right.

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:58.000
Liam C. on Facebook says, concentrate on developing new IPs to bring in a new audience that is generally held by the Xbox Playstation, but also give older franchises a chance on the Wii U, like Golden Sun and F-Zero.

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:08.000
Codeman says, I'm kind of on the fence about this. As much as I would love to see new IPs, I love remakes of such games as the Mario franchise, Smash Brothers, F-Zero, etc.

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:13.000
I think that Nintendo should begin to focus a bit on indie developers. That's where the fans are. Well, at least me.

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:18.000
Although the exclusive Bayonetta 2 looks fantastic. So, I just don't know. Very difficult question.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:21.000
Yeah, that was the idea. It was a difficult question.

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:26.000
I always mispronounce this name, and especially because I've been drinking. I'm not going to remember it now.

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:33.000
It's Sial? Sial? Sial? I probably said it wrong. I'm very sorry.

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:43.000
Says in chat, I think they should try for an equal focus on the Wii U and 3DS, maybe giving the Wii U slightly more attention due to its issue in the sales department.

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:49.000
As for new IPs versus old, that's another. Both, I want more 2D Metroid and another Mega Man game.

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:56.000
Nintendo slapped the stupid out of Capcom real quick and get on that. However, if they make something real interesting, I will not be disappointed either.

02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:06.000
Man, how epic would a 2D Mega Man game be on the Wii U where you could have your thing to switch weapons right there on the gamepad, so you never have to bring up the little window.

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:09.000
You don't ever have to bring it up after SNES games.

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
Oh yeah, that's right, because you have the L and R triggers.

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:12.000
You can use the L and R triggers.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
That's true. But still, still, think about it.

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
And you can keep holding a charge while you switch through your weapons.

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:19.000
A map or something. There's so much potential there with the Wii U.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:26.000
Andy R says, new IPs. There we go. Somebody's saying one or the other. New IPs.

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:33.000
Mario and Zelda are cool and all, but I'd love to see a Nintendo mascot that wasn't created more than three console generations ago.

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:37.000
Well, you get Steel Diver for free. That was this generation.

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:42.000
SSG100 Matt says, we have all been waiting for Nintendo to come out with the next new IP for many years.

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:48.000
They have flirted with some franchises, but fully expanded them to the length of Mario, Pokemon, Metroid, and Zelda.

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:53.000
While we all still respect and love the classics, they will always be there for us in some way, shape, or form.

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:56.000
I'm more interested in seeing the next new idea from Nintendo.

02:09:56.000 --> 02:10:03.000
The thought of something new coming to the table sounds much more exciting than just another Mario, Zelda, or Metroid rehash.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:09.000
I'm going to give you two huge IPs that Nintendo did last generation.

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:16.000
In fact, I would say Nintendo's biggest IP of all time came last generation.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:19.000
And y'all are forgetting. Anybody?

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:20.000
Wii Fit.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:21.000
Excite Truck.

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:22.000
Close.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:23.000
Wii Fit is one of the big ones.

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:24.000
Wii Sports.

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:25.000
Wii Sports.

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:26.000
Excite Truck.

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:27.000
Wii Sports was last generation.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:28.000
I would kill for it.

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
No, the answer is Excite Truck.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:33.000
Okay, fine. There's Excite Truck as well.

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:34.000
Excite Truck is awesome.

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:37.000
Alright.

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
Let's see, where was I?

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:43.000
Speaking of which, now that I think about it, what are those guys working on?

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:51.000
The guys at Monster Games that have done, you know, two racing games for Nintendo and they're still working on another racing game that...

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
Hopefully not unemployment.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:54.000
Maybe F-Zero?

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:58.000
Excite Truck U. That could only be the dream.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:02.000
Alright. Did I read SSG100 Matt's answer? I did. That was the one I was on, right?

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
I think so. Okay.

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:11.000
Zether says, new IP. We need more of those, less of Mario and Zelda. When Nintendo experiments, sometimes the result is good.

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:15.000
The thing they have to hear, they have to have something that's going to do well.

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:24.000
Clover Nikon says, the new talent should work on new IPs. That doesn't mean the new talent could offer a fresh take on our favorite Nintendo classics.

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:33.000
Tiger Claw says, I would like Nintendo to work on a brand new Star Fox game, but I think they could take the game in another direction and do it no linear and more open world-ish.

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:41.000
Instead of sticking to the rail shooter it was originally. Plus, I would like to see Nintendo develop a brand new IP that doesn't involve their own characters making cameos.

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:48.000
You know, Mario Galaxy was kind of a new IP. It's just that it had Mario, but it didn't play like a Mario. Well, I mean, it didn't, it didn't.

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:51.000
It was a platformer, but it was so different. You know what I mean?

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:55.000
I like Super Paper Mario. I thought that was a good version of Paper Mario.

02:11:55.000 --> 02:12:00.000
And I liked it a lot better than, like, I even went back and played Paper Mario and I just like, eh.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:05.000
Nintendo's solution to sell new IPs is to shove Mario into it. And it really works.

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:08.000
It really works for them in a way that...

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:21.000
Not so much for Wario. Remember the Wario game that they had that was fucking amazing? It was all hand drawn and like, it looked just like one of those Rayman games and then it was just, no one bought it.

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:25.000
That was Wario Land, shake it. That game was so much fun.

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:35.000
Gamergirl says, I think it would be cool if the new IPs helped work on maybe some new games. Mario and Zelda are fine, but what if they steered clear of those two icons for a while?

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:38.000
Would it make people dislike Nintendo anymore?

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:48.000
Here's the thing, there has to be an HD Zelda. That has to happen. Can you imagine, like, people will revolt in the streets if there's not an HD Zelda and soon.

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:51.000
It's time to bring back Rad Racer.

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:58.000
I'm with you, Gamergirl. I think they should do some, but to deny an HD Zelda, that's too much.

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:01.000
We need to see the rebirth of Snake, Rattle, and Roll.

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:06.000
JVMonk? That wasn't a Nintendo game, was it? It was rare or, yeah.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:07.000
It was, but Nintendo needs to...

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:11.000
I may get some hate, but Zelda's kind of overrated and has its talent.

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:12.000
Get out! No, I'm just kidding.

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:16.000
Actually, like Ocarina of Time...

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
People need to move on past Zelda.

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:26.000
Ocarina of Time is super overrated, but I have to remember that a lot of people, like, that is literally the game they grew up on.

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:34.000
Like, went through their teenage years playing and so forth, so, like, I will always love Link to the Past the best.

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:39.000
So when they announced that 3DS sequel, I literally did the eeee thing, right?

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:43.000
When they announced that sequel, because I'm so excited, because that's, like, my favorite Zelda.

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:48.000
I don't get Ocarina of Time at that same level. Certainly not when we start talking Majora's Mask and, like, yeah.

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:51.000
Link to the Past is the only one I can play.

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:52.000
However, um...

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:55.000
I did play through a crapload of Ocarina, though.

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:59.000
Twilight Princess was pretty fucking good. Like, that I can't deny.

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
I named my cat after that game.

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
It was pretty for a Wii game, but...

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
Alright, anyhow. Uh, Chiggers...

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:11.000
Is it me or was Midna just the best new character ever in a Zelda series?

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:12.000
Yeah.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
There's a reason why you named a creature after her.

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:15.000
Alright, uh...

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:16.000
I think she's a little imp.

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
Chiggers in our Facebook says,

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:21.000
I would like to see a new Mario RPG and not Paper Mario.

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:25.000
I think they need to bring Square Enix back to do it, too. Good luck.

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:30.000
And work on your damn online capabilities, like Online Mario Party or even the aforementioned Mario RPG.

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:34.000
I think it would be kind of cool to do a Diablo-type online Mario game.

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:37.000
How would that even work, but I like it.

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:38.000
And lastly, Raginator says,

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:41.000
I want to see a mix of new IPs and fan faves.

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
Why does it have to be one or another?

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:44.000
Because I said so.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
That's the question. One or the other.

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
That's fine. That's fine.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
Uh, we appreciate all the answers nonetheless.

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
It sounds like most people are like,

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
we need a little of column A and a little of column B.

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
That you can't make me pick one, Rob.

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:58.000
You just can't.

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
And I can respect that.

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:03.000
Those are some of the answers there at facebook.com slash orangehonestradio

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
and our Google Plus community.

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
Thanks to y'all for participating.

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:08.000
Back to the news. Loki.

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:09.000
Alright.

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
So this is pretty awesome news.

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:16.000
Volition has actually kind of partnered up with

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:21.000
the guys behind the Gentleman of the Row mod.

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
It's the Idol Ninja.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:28.000
And they are kind of doing this mod tool thing.

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:32.000
They're actually participating on their forums now pretty actively

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:38.000
and helping create all sorts of new mods for Saints Row the Third, Saints Row 2

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:43.000
and eventually going to have a full blown mod kit for Saints Row 4.

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
And we're talking all sorts of stuff.

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:48.000
And even Saints Row the Third already you can do quite a bit.

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:54.000
Like I have some mods running on there where I have some handheld lasers and stuff like that.

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:55.000
They're pretty sweet.

02:15:55.000 --> 02:16:00.000
So yeah, I'm pretty excited to see what they're going to do with this.

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:05.000
And the way it sounds like now is with these tools you can essentially

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
it's basically the tools they're using to make the game.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:12.000
You can create new maps, new weapons, characters, missions, etc.

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:15.000
It's going to really expand a lot of the game.

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:19.000
So I'm already expecting to get it on PC anyway.

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:20.000
So it makes me excited.

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
I know you love your mods too.

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:23.000
It'll be awesome.

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:24.000
Alright.

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:27.000
Well maybe you'll be able to mod this game when it comes to PC.

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000
Although probably not because it is an MMO.

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
It's always connected but kind of surprising.

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:36.000
Dragon Quest X announced during a 10 hour live stream.

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:37.000
I'm hoping that was a lot of gameplay.

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:38.000
Oh boy.

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:39.000
Yeah it's a lot, huh?

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:43.000
But anyway, Square Enix announced during this live stream that the Nintendo exclusive

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:47.000
or at least it was, it's coming to PC on September 26th in Japan.

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:52.000
It will retail for $40 but there will also be a deluxe version for 9800 yen

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
which would be about what, 80 bucks?

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:58.000
That has a Dragon Quest X PC game controller, monster encyclopedia book,

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:02.000
a map of the world, security token, and additional in-game content.

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:07.000
Very interesting because Dragon Quest obviously is huge in Japan

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:08.000
and this game was a selling point.

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
Dragon Quest X was on Wii and Wii U.

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:14.000
Never came here though and I don't understand why but alright.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:17.000
I'm surprised Monster Hunter hasn't really come to PC.

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000
Yeah it's very interesting.

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:20.000
I mean different company but.

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:21.000
Yeah it's just so interesting.

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:25.000
But anyway, you can get a Dragon Quest X PC benchmark.

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:28.000
It's available for download at nvidia.co.jp

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:31.000
and there's also a beta sign up available.

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:34.000
So yeah, there you go, Dragon Quest X coming to PC.

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:41.000
Nintendo losing that exclusive in Japan but maybe the Wii U especially didn't have.

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:42.000
So console exclusive.

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:45.000
Yeah, well yeah it's still console exclusive which is cool.

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
Well Wii U I mean.

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:50.000
Final Fantasy XIV will be exclusive to Sony consoles.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:54.000
It's not going to be on Nintendo and it's not going to be on Xbox 360 or one

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:57.000
so kind of a similar situation.

02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:00.000
Anyhow, Dark Sakura.

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:06.000
In other news, there's a company called the Fullbright Company that has a game.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
I have to actually check this out.

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:11.000
Their little trailer for it called Gone Home.

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:17.000
Which is sort of, I guess it's going to go into some sort of point and click survival horror game.

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:23.000
Where basically a girl goes home from college to find her family is completely missing.

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
The house is empty and she's trying to look for clues.

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:33.000
Well, basically the company is pulling out of their showing at Penny Arcade Expo.

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:43.000
After some comments that were made regarding some basic transphobia.

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:47.000
This was from Mike with Penny Arcade.

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:51.000
And lots of just really negative comments that were going out.

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:57.000
So basically they're saying that even though this is their biggest form of exposure that they could get for their game.

02:18:57.000 --> 02:19:05.000
They're pulling out because those type of comments and basically the nature of these people is not what they want to associate with their game and their company.

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
So they've completely pulled out.

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:14.000
I honestly get the sense from this guy over at Penny Arcade is that he's not necessarily transphobic by nature.

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:17.000
You know that would mean that he like hates them or whatever.

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
But he kind of he has...

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:21.000
Doesn't understand it?

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:26.000
Yeah, I think so. I think he kind of misunderstands how to communicate about that in public or whatever.

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
And he's very hard headed.

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:32.000
And I think the big problem is how he was lashing out on Twitter.

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:36.000
And when he said he's made some comment like if you use the...

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:39.000
And I am totally paraphrasing. Do not quote me on this because I don't have his Twitter in front of me.

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:47.000
But it was something like if you say the word cis around me then stop doing that because I totally discount you at that point.

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:50.000
Like really bold headed, thick headed statements like that.

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
Oh there was the dick wolves thing too.

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:56.000
Think before you tweet. You influence a lot of people.

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:59.000
My granddaddy had a fantastic phrase.

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:02.000
Put brain in gear before mouth in motion.

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
Or in this case fingers in motion.

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:07.000
But it's definitely an act don't react.

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000
Take a moment and think about it.

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:10.000
Yeah.

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:16.000
So, and you know some folks in extrovert says they were comments that were taken out of context.

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:22.000
But when you influence that many people a singular tweet like that, that can happen.

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:25.000
You know and you've got to really think about some of these things that you're saying.

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
You know and again I'm giving the guy credit.

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:30.000
I don't think at heart he hates trans people.

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
Like that's not the impression I get at all.

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:38.000
It's not like Penny Arcade built its reputation on being the most PC comic there was.

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:42.000
The impression I get is that he's saying it's my way or the highway.

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:49.000
And the trans community is trying to say actually when you say this we consider it offensive for these reasons.

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:54.000
You know and it's like it's kind of like he's not conveying that he understands that appropriately.

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:58.000
Yeah it's one thing to educate someone who doesn't want to be educated.

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:10.000
And I can understand though where as a company if there's this general conception going on that this is how they feel.

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:14.000
I can understand wanting to separate your company's image from that conception.

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:20.000
So yeah they were perfectly and if they wanted to pull out of Penny Arcade Expo whatever their reasons were they were valid.

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:23.000
Did you see the follow up by the way? I don't know if you saw the follow up.

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:24.000
No I didn't.

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:28.000
He actually posted an apology yesterday the 21st.

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
No I guess that would be two days ago.

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:34.000
He actually ended up making a donation to the Trevor Project of $20,000.

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:38.000
Now I feel really good and really kind of hmm at that.

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:41.000
Like Trevor Project is an awesome charity.

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
I'm so glad they're getting this.

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:46.000
But there's that part of me I have to go here.

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
There's that part of me that's like.

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:51.000
You can't throw money at the problem and expect people to forget it.

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:54.000
It's not so much that but it's like where did that money come from?

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:59.000
Because you just told everybody you needed to do this Kickstarter to do this Penny Arcade podcast.

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:04.000
And you know you set the bar at $10 and set these stretch goals at hundreds of thousands of dollars.

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:08.000
When I can tell you it does not take that kind of money to do a podcast.

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
It's the money that they're bringing in from Penny Arcade?

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:11.000
Yeah.

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:18.000
So I mean I'm again it's a slippery slope because I'm like I can't say oh $20,000 a charity what a horrible thing you did.

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:19.000
But I'm just kind of.

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000
It almost seems like they're trying to buy forgiveness.

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000
That's my top impression.

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:26.000
This is a.

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:27.000
Yeah.

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:28.000
Okay let me put it this way.

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:29.000
I think this is the best way I can put it.

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:35.000
This is a good step but it's not going to fix the problem.

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:36.000
Does that make sense?

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
Yeah.

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
The problem is.

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:41.000
Here's an example.

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:42.000
The reaction and the tweets and.

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
I can give a local example.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
This is what it makes me think of.

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:55.000
Remember when the ice cream chain local leather bees was having a problem about them having donated their money to the pro prop eight.

02:22:55.000 --> 02:23:00.000
They was just but we we serve ice cream at pride events.

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:06.000
It's sort of almost the same thing where they're trying to put a bandaid over something without getting to what the actual problem was.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:11.000
And in this case it's like well we're getting money to this but the whole thing is that the damage has been done.

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:17.000
It's going to take quite a bit more to turn it around if at all.

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
You know what I mean.

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:24.000
So it's it's like they're trying to make put a put a bandaid over it and hope people forget.

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:30.000
Extra for in chat says I don't think they feel like it'll fix the problem either but it doesn't hurt to donate money shrug.

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:38.000
I agree it's not again I'm not I'm certainly not hating on the donation but there is that part of me that goes like okay well you know.

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:42.000
Put your mouth where your money is I guess is what I'm saying.

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
And but you know nobody's perfect.

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:48.000
Lord knows I've said a lot of stupid shit on this show over the past 11 years.

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:58.000
So anyway but the other thing I want to address we have a lot of people in chat that are asking what does what is says and what is this gender and teaching moment teaching moment.

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:05.000
It means a gender you were born with whatever your physical genitalia indicate that you are or your chromosomes indicate right.

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:08.000
That's what you are you agree with what you were born with.

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:15.000
Now there's certainly a reaction out there that people will go well I have male genitals and I'm male but isn't that just normal.

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000
For you it is.

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000
Right and that's the point.

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:29.000
That's where the transgender community is is having is is having this difficulty because so many people just go well there's no such thing as this gender because that's just normal.

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:33.000
And transgender is like well wait a minute transgender is normal too.

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000
This is a real thing.

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:36.000
I would say.

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
This is how we help you know.

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:41.000
Cisgender would be the majority.

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:42.000
Yes.

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:53.000
As in you find more people biologically who agree with the gender that they genetically were predisposed towards I guess.

02:24:53.000 --> 02:25:00.000
I mean you know it could be hormonal it could be people you also have people with multiple chromosome issues.

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:05.000
You know are you still have people who are born hermaphroditic.

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:15.000
And it's whatever like that what was that that that story that was going that was making the rounds about the the man in China who went to have a problem says well technically you're female.

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:20.000
Because he actually had multiple chromosomal issues but they said he had female bits.

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
He just thought he was small.

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:32.000
But you know the whole thing is that well that's what his doctor told him that the government upheld he'd been raised male he lived male government upheld your your man.

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
You know it's that type of thing.

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:35.000
You know.

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:39.000
Whatever and I am not.

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:44.000
I'm not a big fan of labels in general because I think that labels are a good way.

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:53.000
Yeah maybe you can embrace it to understand who you are for a degree of self-acceptance but it's also ways that people try to categorize other people.

02:25:53.000 --> 02:26:02.000
Queen Simeon our chat says that's kind of like calling white skin normal or less colored crayon heterosexual normal.

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:07.000
Well and the big thing and actually I love people on Tumblr for this.

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:14.000
We're getting to see a lot more attention put on the asexuality community for people who just have no interest in it.

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
Which.

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:20.000
OK I'll go for people who define their sexuality as none of the above.

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:24.000
You can be romantic but not have.

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
And it doesn't stop you from not you.

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
I've known several people in that category.

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:29.000
Exactly.

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
And you know I'll go ahead and say it. I'm in that category.

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:35.000
Don't don't like it. Don't care. I like reading about it.

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:39.000
I think porn is hilarious but I really don't.

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000
I never really have.

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:48.000
But you're in a fully functional but I'm in a functional marriage and sometimes you know it makes me happy to make Dan happy.

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:51.000
But it has nothing to say about him. It's all me.

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:56.000
And he understands that and he's perfectly fine with that and I have no problem admitting it to anybody.

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:59.000
I just it's just not how I'm wired.

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:13.000
And you know I think that when you get to the point where you have people that are looking at something that they don't understand where it doesn't fit into what their concept of normal is.

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
There's going to be a reaction to it.

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:18.000
There's going to be people who go oh well that's not normal.

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:23.000
That's not I don't think that way I was raised to think that well it doesn't matter what you were raised to think.

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000
What matters is what is.

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000
Just because you were raised. Oh my God.

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:30.000
This actually goes back to the stupid Paula Deen thing too.

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:34.000
Just because you were raised to think that does not mean that you are right to think that.

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:38.000
Let me get another one more comment here because I think this is an important one to end on.

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:42.000
Chiggers in chat says there's no such thing as a normal human and totally agree.

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:51.000
But that's kind of where the problem with you know Penny Arcade Guy's reaction lies is that when he says like you know if you use this term then you're an idiot essentially.

02:27:51.000 --> 02:28:00.000
You know he's kind of like you know he's he's saying it's it's he that he rejects that and I think that's just that's that's the issue.

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:10.000
You know among other things I just say you know it doesn't matter who what bits you were born with it doesn't matter if you love someone and don't want to sleep with them.

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
It doesn't matter if you want to sleep with them then don't love them.

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:18.000
You know I guess that's kind of but it just matters that you don't be an asshole.

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:20.000
Don't be an asshole.

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:23.000
This is a perfect comment to end on and then we'll go to the next story Loki.

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:26.000
Drunami, fuck the haters, be you.

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:27.000
Amen.

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:28.000
Amen.

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:29.000
Well and don't be an asshole.

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:32.000
Alright Loki, fuck the haters, be you with the next story.

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:40.000
So yes PlayStation Plus is not going to be required for the automatic updates on your PlayStation 4.

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:47.000
Remember it does automatic updates in the background on the PlayStation 4 and right now that's only a feature that's on PlayStation Plus.

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:52.000
However that's something that's going to change once the PlayStation 4 comes out at least for the PlayStation 4.

02:28:52.000 --> 02:29:04.000
It's not going to be tied to that so you will still be able to do those auto updates for games game and system updates and yeah so that's kind of cool.

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:12.000
But of course they would like to encourage that you buy PlayStation Plus as well but I was kind of disappointed.

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:17.000
I just signed up for PlayStation Plus and I remember they have an instant game collection.

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:24.000
I didn't realize they cycle titles out of that so you have to kind of download them at the time in order to be able to play some of them.

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:28.000
Because I wanted to do the Shadow Eco and Shadow of the Colossus collection and stuff like that.

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:35.000
But you know right now it's like Saints were the Third Vanquish which is going away so I downloaded it anyways.

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:42.000
And LittleBigPlanetKarting which by the way will be this week's VOG gaming night title.

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
I have that game maybe I'll actually be able to play it for once.

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:45.000
Yes Friday night.

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:48.000
I was guessing on that other podcast this week that's why I couldn't do it this week.

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:52.000
That's right this week I was playing Final Fantasy 14 so I didn't have anything.

02:29:52.000 --> 02:30:03.000
But yes this week it will be LittleBigPlanetKarting on the PlayStation 3 so if you have PlayStation Plus it's a free title download it and check it out.

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
I have yet to play it so it will be interesting.

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
It's fun.

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:08.000
It looks fun.

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:09.000
Yeah you'll have fun with it.

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:12.000
Alright moving on to this story I find this interesting.

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:15.000
This is about Dungeons and Dragons Chronicles of Mystaria.

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:19.000
Now this game just came out on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network.

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:23.000
It's remasters of the old 90's arcade games which were awesome by the way.

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:28.000
But in Japan they're getting a special PlayStation 3 retail release.

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:32.000
Exclusive features and enhancements not in the digital version.

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:33.000
What?

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:42.000
I mean this sounds great don't get me wrong but why were there two versions of this game being done and why is the better one exclusive to Japan?

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:46.000
Because the new one has the color edit feature.

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:49.000
Multiple players can play as the same character.

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:51.000
There's an in depth series of options.

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:54.000
You can toggle features like random damage and breakable weapons.

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:58.000
I don't get it.

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
Oh well.

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:04.000
Luckily the PlayStation 3 is region free so if you feel very strongly about it.

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:07.000
Ultimately I'll be satisfied with the digital version here.

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:13.000
But if you feel strongly if you really love these games the good news is PlayStation 3 is region free so import it from Japan.

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:14.000
Have a ball.

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:18.000
Just hope you can read the Japanese text or know the game well enough to get around it.

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
So there you go.

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:24.000
It's that time of the week where we go to the mailbag and read some of your emails.

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
Are you good to do that tonight?

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:27.000
I'll be okay there's only four.

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
Oh my god there were only two earlier.

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:31.000
Okay let's go to the mailbag.

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:35.000
Well if there were other they were Russian or Mandarin.

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
We have a huge influx.

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
I know a word in Russian.

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:40.000
Duh.

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:47.000
Just to throw it out there our mailbag is still mailbag at orangelandradio.com.

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:52.000
However I'm strongly contemplating changing that in the coming weeks.

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:56.000
If for nothing else than to flush out the spam because we're getting too much of it.

02:31:56.000 --> 02:32:00.000
I actually would recommend that we switch it through a Google account.

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:03.000
Unfortunately you have to pay for those now for business accounts.

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:04.000
No.

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:05.000
Yes you do.

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:06.000
Well what about the redirects?

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
I don't know I will look into that.

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
Because I really like Google's filters.

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:11.000
Yeah I know.

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:12.000
We'll talk about that later.

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:15.000
You have to pay for that now unfortunately but we will talk about that offline.

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:16.000
I have a dollar.

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:19.000
For now continue using mailbag at orangelandradio.com.

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
We will flood the Twitter and all that stuff.

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:22.000
Thanks brownies please.

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:23.000
When we change.

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:24.000
Alright.

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:25.000
Okay.

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:26.000
Dear OLR.

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:30.000
I'm sorry I couldn't get through last week as I was eager to discuss my own thoughts on E3 with you.

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:34.000
With Next Generation officially across the horizon.

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:37.000
I find myself reminiscing about my own journey with gaming.

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:42.000
I discovered the arcades in the late 70's and immediately fell in love with video games.

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
I met soft friends that owned 2600's before Christmas.

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000
My father bought us an Atari 5200.

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:48.000
I got two of those.

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:49.000
They're awesome.

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:50.000
I love that thing.

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:51.000
Terrible controllers and all.

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:52.000
Yes thank you.

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:55.000
The controllers of 5200 are ass.

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
Dan just rebuilt two controllers.

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000
So that we could go to Atari party.

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:00.000
Okay.

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:07.000
My software career began as a game tester for Sega testing games like Dark Wizard on Sega CD and Aladdin for Game Gear.

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:13.000
I even owned my own retail store when I rented out import games and met a lot of local developers from Namco, Capcom, and EA.

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:16.000
I since left the gaming industry but have remained dedicated to the community at large.

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:20.000
I have probably owned nearly every major console and portable in the last 20 years.

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
Sorry for being sniffy.

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:25.000
I find myself in a strange position these days.

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:28.000
I've pre-ordered both the PS4 and the much maligned Xbox One.

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:31.000
Rob remains one of my two friends on the Wii U by the way.

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:32.000
Haha.

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:36.000
You guys have described coming to E3 as if it was a death march.

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:39.000
And I guess that I really didn't perceive it as such.

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:43.000
I won't go so far as to say that I agree with every policy that's being introduced.

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000
But I'm not frightened either.

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:50.000
I wonder if the core gaming community is simply intimidated by what this change might mean.

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:54.000
This is after all the final transition into a digital delivery only reality.

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:57.000
Of course since then they've kind of backpedaled.

02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:01.000
BlackWolf and Chad is asking, so can this guy fix my Neo Geo?

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.000
Maybe.

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:06.000
Bobby I'm still checking some of my resources.

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:07.000
Trust me.

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:10.000
Well if this guy, who emailed this?

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:11.000
Dark Charger.

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:14.000
If Dark Charger's listening and you can fix Neo Geo's please let us know.

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:17.000
Yeah and if you can mod my Neo Geo, I'm just kidding.

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:18.000
We're gonna bring you business buddy.

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
Did I tell you how we got a Neo Geo?

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:23.000
Dan traded his take a CD for it. That's how we have a Neo Geo.

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:27.000
Uh, where was I?

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:31.000
Still I look at all the amazing games at E3 and I couldn't imagine myself not being part of that.

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:37.000
The six year old enemy that walked into that first arcade still finds excitement at how gaming is getting better and frankly cheaper.

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:43.000
The Xbox One makes sense for me as a primary console because I actually am really looking forward to the multimedia features.

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:46.000
I want an all in one solution for games, IPTV, etc.

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:54.000
My relatives are all excited that I will be sharing my gaming library with them because they know I buy a ton of games.

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:59.000
For them this opens up gaming in ways not previously available especially those that live out of the immediate area.

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:03.000
I'm still getting the PS4 for the exclusives, JM ports, and indie games.

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:15.000
And it's all the excitement I find myself a bit sad that I no longer quite fit in the same way with the core gaming community that I identified with for so long.

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:27.000
Perhaps the years of my own career as an online gaming software developer have skewed that perceptive, I guess maybe perception, especially since I know how little game developers actually make.

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:34.000
I often find myself these days castigated on forums for my views despite my lifelong dedication to this hobby.

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:39.000
I am at least, I am glad at least that every gamer indeed has a voice here.

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:42.000
Your friendly neighborhood gaming pariah, Dark Charger.

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:52.000
You know there's a lot of passionate opinions right now. Don't let Twitter and Facebook and the things that people say when there's nobody around there to immediately yell at them for what they're saying.

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:59.000
Don't take that with too much weight. Like you know, yeah I was pretty miserable going into this year's E3.

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:07.000
And I understand where people were excited about pushing things forward and some of these new ideas that Microsoft was going to bring to the table.

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:10.000
Although it was a big nebula we didn't really know.

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:16.000
But I don't think that means like doom and gloom that they didn't go that way either.

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:24.000
I think it just says that you know $60 is a lot to pay for a game and people want control over you know what they do when they're done with that game.

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:35.000
So by the time these consoles come out I think you'll hear a lot more about the games themselves because people will be actually playing them and this will get a lot better.

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:39.000
Well there's a PS on this. This is PS if you have never done it.

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:43.000
Please do a classic game of the week on Treasure's Yu Yu Hawk show for our Mega Drive.

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:50.000
That was a good game. But now though I'm really sad because like my favorite song from that series just popped into my head, Sayonara Bye Bye.

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:53.000
I did watch quite a bit of Yu Yu Hawk Show.

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000
Sounds like it could be a classic game soon.

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:58.000
Well don't let me forget about it. That was a good game.

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:04.000
Alright, hello OLR radio. That's kind of a redundant R. I love the crew.

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:07.000
Hello ATM machine.

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:10.000
Hello pin number.

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:15.000
To all gamers, can't we all just get along? Please go and pre-order an Xbox One.

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:20.000
We can't let a little negativity take us out of the game. Show Microsoft that we are there through thick and thin.

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:24.000
Let's face it, $900 for both consoles ain't bad.

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:28.000
Dude, you know what? That's almost a month of rent.

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:30.000
Yeah, I hate to say it but...

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:34.000
What is not that... Whatever your income is, I want it.

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
Yeah, I hate to say it.

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:38.000
Tell your daddy to adopt me.

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:49.000
Or to give this guy a little credit, if it's $900 spread across a year, and I can buy one console this year and one console next year, that's far more reasonable.

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000
And probably what I will do.

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000
One last...

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:57.000
You could also do like on a payment... I can't speak.

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000
A payment plan?

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000
Tequila finally caught up with me.

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:04.000
Or a responsible credit card.

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:16.000
I pre-ordered the Xbox One on my Best Buy credit card and it's like no interest for 18 months so I'm going to be paying that off over the 18 months so I don't get hammered with the interest by then.

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:20.000
I'll tell you what happened when we got our PS3, right? Because we bought the top model one and controllers and everything.

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:24.000
We used our Discover card. We got $100 rebate back on it.

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:27.000
That's right. Discover does cash back, right?

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:31.000
It's like for every sum amount you spend, you get a percentage back.

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:37.000
And in this case too, because Dan also was a GameStop manager, he got a discount on hardware and the games.

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:41.000
So we actually ended up getting it for cheaper than the lower model.

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.000
I miss those days.

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000
Anyway, where was I?

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:58.000
One last thing. No need to upgrade those PCs anymore. The consoles have high-end PC specs on a unified platform which will allow the devs to create high-end PC games for those consoles. Thank you, Sam.

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:03.000
Yeah, except I can't use Photoshop on my Xbox. So, wrong.

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000
Yet.

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:09.000
No. I cannot effectively use Photoshop.

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000
What if they hack it?

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:17.000
That's not true, actually. The next iteration of Photoshop is actually going to be in the cloud.

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:21.000
Like I said, effectively use it.

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000
Keyboard and mouse support.

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:27.000
Think about, though, using a higher-end monitor.

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000
It supports 4K output.

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:33.000
You could get a really good level of precision, possibly.

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000
But I can't use a controller.

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000
Humor the thought.

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:47.000
I like having my window open while I am looking at my Tumblr and chatting with Becky and playing with Kat and, you know...

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000
And wondering why you never got your project done.

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:53.000
Do you know what I had to draw the other day?

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000
What?

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000
A turkey drinking beer.

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
Random.

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000
It was awesome.

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000
And here I am, high on Robitussin, drawing a turkey drinking beer.

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000
It's for charity.

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:09.000
Which, by the way, thank you, Matt, so much for... Grandpa Matt.

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:13.000
But yeah, I think what you're sort of forgetting to do...

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000
Did somebody literally hire you?

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000
No.

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000
I'm doing pro bono work.

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000
It goes in my portfolio.

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000
I'm not knocking...

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000
Charity is good.

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000
It's good. And I'm not knocking anything that's gonna...

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
You've done great stuff for Unloud, too, so it's all charity.

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:33.000
I'm not gonna knock anything, especially that's going to feed the homeless.

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:37.000
And as soon as I get the okay about this, I will say something on the show.

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000
Okay.

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:45.000
But at any rate, you've got a lot more versatility with a PC.

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:49.000
I'm just putting it there. Multitasking on a PC? Far easier.

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:55.000
You know, I think the game system should be dedicated towards only the entertainment purposes.

02:40:55.000 --> 02:41:01.000
And for the record, I can play Star Trek online and watch episodes of Supernatural at the same time, so shut up.

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:05.000
Now, I wasn't really hearing enough of the why in that email.

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:09.000
I was hearing you should support Microsoft because you're a gamer, but why?

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000
I'm supporting Sony because I'm a gamer.

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:13.000
Then Microsoft should support me, too.

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:19.000
And those old policies, I think they supported corporate interests, they didn't support me.

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000
Call me whatever name you want in the book.

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:27.000
I just believe that when you invest $60 in the game, it should be up to you what you do with that game when you're done with it and not Microsoft.

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.000
Period.

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:39.000
As an adult consumer, I sat and looked at them, even after Microsoft did their backpedal, and looked at them side by side and said,

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:45.000
What is going to be the better use of my money? What's going to give me more of what I want and less of what I don't?

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:55.000
But I respect your opinion, emailer, and I think we will hear more about this, and I don't think we'll really have the answer to this whole console war

02:41:56.000 --> 02:42:01.000
until we know more about what this is going to look like day one, because we still don't know what day these are coming out.

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000
We don't know what games they're making launch.

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.000
There's still a lot of nebulas on both sides.

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:08.000
And in the end, I'm grown up. I do what I want.

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:14.000
Okay, a guy got logged out of chat, too.

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:17.000
Um, hey, OLR, before getting—oh, God, this one's long.

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:19.000
That's what she said.

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:22.000
Or he.

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.000
The stairs she gave Rob.

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000
Rob got the A-D-S.

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.000
Hey, OLR. Hey.

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:40.000
Before—before getting into the meat of this letter, I'd like to send my condolences to the family, friends, and associates of David, Knuckles, Dawson, Drueger for their loss.

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:46.000
The loss of a person that meant so much to so many people is saddening and helps to put things in perspective.

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:50.000
All the anger and hate on both sides of the Xbox One debate seems to be meaningless in times like this.

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:55.000
While it never truly gets better, the pain eases with time, especially if you hold onto the memories of who that person was.

02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:58.000
With that said, it's time to get to the point.

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:09.000
With the Xbox One's draconian DRM policies being reversed, there are many people, including Bobby Blackwell and Cliff Bleszinski, who are looking at the consumer's victory as a horrible loss of innovation.

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000
I already know how this email is signed.

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:14.000
But go on.

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:15.000
Yeah.

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:18.000
I'm gonna read it. Every gamer has a voice.

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:19.000
Every gamer has a voice.

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:24.000
Bobby was particularly sarcastic bordering on Spyful earlier tonight.

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:27.000
Why don't you send Bobby this letter, not us?

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:28.000
Keep going.

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:35.000
These people have gotten on my tam nerves and have gotten to the point where I can barely stand to see or hear their exclusive ravings.

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:42.000
The narrative they seem to be sticking to is we're blocking, quote, progress and imperiling the industry.

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:45.000
My anger towards this is for one simple reason.

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:48.000
I do not oppose the existence of digital distribution.

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:51.000
While I don't use DRM- God stop.

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:56.000
While I don't use DRM-based services like Steam, I don't even oppose their existence.

02:43:56.000 --> 02:44:00.000
I understand a lot of people like Steam and that's fine. It just isn't for me.

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:06.000
However, the Xbox One was designed in such a way to take away the choice of the traditional disc-based games.

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:12.000
People like myself, who enjoy a more flexible model of physical distribution, were upset because we didn't want it taken away.

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:20.000
We didn't want to take away digital for those of you who prefer that, but the way Bobby Black Wolf, Shadow Next Gen, and the light go on.

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:21.000
Oh God, I'm sorry.

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:28.000
You think we're all some rabid luddites in mud huts trying our best to destroy any purpose at all costs.

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.000
Okay. Ah, ah, ah, ah. Nope, nope, nope.

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:32.000
When I saw the rest of it.

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.000
Where was that? Okay, look, look.

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:35.000
I respect-

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:37.000
This is a reaction, not an action.

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:46.000
I respect your passionate opinion. However, I'm losing respect for this email and the way you're lashing out.

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:52.000
Because come on, Bobby didn't say that in that way.

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:55.000
And this whole thing with the mud huts is a come on.

02:44:56.000 --> 02:45:07.000
I get your point. Like, I understand the whole, like, I feel like consumers are trying to take away what's rightfully mine and all this stuff.

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:08.000
Like, I get that.

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:18.000
But I also understand why Bobby was like, but there's new ideas we're not going to get to see because the internet got what they wanted.

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:28.000
But nowhere in that did I necessarily hear that he thought that that was like a bad thing or a horrible thing or gamers are doomed or that's, you know, or whatever.

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:30.000
Can I interject?

02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:31.000
Yeah, of course.

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:34.000
Shadow next gen. I made the email awesome. High fives, black wolf.

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:38.000
Oh, God.

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:45.000
Bobby and Chad is responding right now saying, I'm happy we can get back to talking about the games. And I think that's a good way to put it.

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.000
I'm trying to see if there's anything-

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:56.000
I just, like, the Cliffy B thing, I'm okay with you dragging him a little bit because Cliffy B can be a little bit bullheaded with his opinions.

02:45:56.000 --> 02:46:04.000
But my point is that these other guys are calling out in your email. They're not so bullheaded. Like, you know, but they do have some different opinions.

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:12.000
Yes, they are supporting Microsoft because they think a little differently about this stuff. And I don't think that makes them anti-consumer or anti anything.

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:14.000
They're just different.

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:30.000
What I was reading further into this email is that I think that, I'll go ahead and say it, Rawsteel UT, is under the impression that there is a backlash against people who prefer the traditional method of distribution.

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:42.000
Saying that because of people like you, we can't have this. We are being made to suffer because you have, in our opinion, an antiquated point of view.

02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:45.000
Oh, and I did see some of that on Twitter this week.

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:46.000
Yes.

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:48.000
Not from the individuals you named, however.

02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:56.000
And he is trying to say, no, I don't care about digital distribution. I don't like to be limited to digital distribution.

02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:59.000
And I agree with you. I think there should be both.

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:06.000
I think that they can have both methods. They can have their online model. They can have a disk-based model. Make the online model cheaper.

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:15.000
If you're going to pay for physical materials, then pay for physical materials and the cost of shipping. You want it physical, deal with it physically.

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:26.000
I buy PC games in equal measure, digital and physical. For example, when I went on my rampage to find Mass Effect 3 before I found out how bad it was. Not bad.

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:36.000
It's fun to play. It's just story-wise. I got Best Buy to knock down the price. And I got a physical copy because I got the better deal for it and I have to pay shipping.

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:49.000
So by the same token, if it had been 20 bucks on sale on Steam or something, which it would have been on Steam, but that's just my point, I would have bought it on Steam in a heartbeat.

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:53.000
I would have bought whatever one suited my financial purposes better.

02:47:54.000 --> 02:48:04.000
Let me say exactly what Bobby was saying in a different way now that we've got that out there. And I'm saying that I agree with you that we should also have the disk-based game and the digital game.

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:12.000
And Bobby, I'm going to do my best to sum up what you were saying. As far as the digital distribution goes, Steam is really the king of that right now.

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:19.000
And if Microsoft had been able to go down that route, Steam would have had a little bit of competition and that competition would have been healthy for the industry.

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:31.000
But because the consumer spoke up and said, we want our disks and we want it this way, we will never know what digital 2.0, for lack of a better term, will look like.

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:39.000
I don't think Bobby feels or even Shadow Next Gen feels that that's somebody's fault or it's because of whining or something like that.

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:48.000
But it goes without saying, we're not going to know what that future of digital looks like right now because we just weren't ready for it.

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:58.000
However, my perspective is, why can't we just have both? And I think that's what Microsoft should work on next.

02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:08.000
And Chat Room, I would encourage you not to basically talk shit about Rosco, UT behind his back. That is immature, unnecessary. You can talk about his attitude.

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:14.000
You can disagree with the points that he's made, but don't dismiss somebody's opinion.

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:21.000
He has a valid point from his point of view, although I think it's short-sighted.

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:25.000
I will go ahead and read his last paragraph.

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:26.000
Go ahead.

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:32.000
As to the Xbox One now, I'm still not getting it because of the camera, where he and I are in the same boat there.

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:42.000
I'm not afraid of the potential for spying as it can be used offline. However, that Microsoft has the balls to ask me to pay $100 more for a console they've already admitted is weaker than the PS4.

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:49.000
Not only that, but the PS4 will likely have more exclusive when all is said and done. When MS drops the Kinect and the price to go with it.

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:56.000
Between the PS4 and the Wii U, I have more than enough gaming to go for the next six to eight years without Microsoft.

02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:59.000
Anyway, thanks for reading. Hope you all have a good day. Regards, Rosco, UT.

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:06.000
And like I said, I think that what I'm seeing going on is a bit of hard-headedness on multiple sides.

02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:07.000
Right.

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:12.000
I think that he's got a misperception of what, you know, Bobby and everybody's saying.

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:18.000
And I think at the same time, maybe there's a bit of a misperception of where he's coming from.

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:19.000
Right.

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:22.000
So I think people just need to sit down, drop the attitude, and talk.

02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:30.000
I agree. And I need to say this in defense of my friend and my associate, Bobby Blackwolf.

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:34.000
You don't know the half of what Bobby's been dealing with this week.

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:40.000
And Bobby puts on the show that he does, you know, out of love for the gaming industry.

02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:41.000
Totally.

02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:46.000
And Bobby does not deserve some of what you gave him tonight. Play nice.

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:47.000
Yeah.

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:54.000
Celebrate the different opinions. Come, you know, talk respectfully amongst each other and try to learn from each other.

02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:57.000
Don't throw fits and walk off.

02:50:57.000 --> 02:51:01.000
I would have stopped reading where I did, regardless, if you hadn't called it.

02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:06.000
But I did think, though, he brought up the valid point with the last paragraph. Just saying.

02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:07.000
No, I agree.

02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:08.000
I agree with that, too.

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:16.000
They all have valid points. Where every gamer has a point. You have a valid point. And you have a valid point. And you have a valid point.

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:26.000
You know, and this is my big thing again, I really hate when people try to single other people out.

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:31.000
As you know, he was accusing in his letter, I didn't go too far into that part.

02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:37.000
He was accusing him and people like him of being the scapegoat being turned into scapegoats.

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:41.000
I think you're sort of doing the same thing. So, yeah, that's that. Yeah.

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.000
That's my kind of my point. Exactly.

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:58.000
You need to, I think, and this actually goes with any issue, anything that people have this big disagreements on, whether it be social, political, religious, video games, shit that does not matter, shit that does matter.

02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:06.000
Respect that people are going to be out there that think differently from you and make your approach to where you were trying to understand them.

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:12.000
With anything. You don't know what you're talking about until you've walked into the other person's shoes.

02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:19.000
For the record, though, Cliffy B never has a valid point. No, he doesn't. So how about last email?

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:21.000
I just want to make sure that was clear.

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:29.000
Dear OLR disclaimer, please excuse any and all grammatical errors. I guess for you I could do it, lady.

02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:37.000
First off, I'd like to say you guys do an amazing job. Love the show as always. This week makes 10 years since my father passed away.

02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:41.000
I'm sorry. And I will never forget how the show is there for me in my time of need.

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:45.000
You guys were always there for others, and I love that about the show.

02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:47.000
I just wanted to say thanks for everything, you guys.

02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:51.000
Dark Tetsuya had the pleasure of staying with me for about four weeks. I'm enjoying every moment of it.

02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:54.000
If it weren't for you guys in the show, I don't think we would have even met.

02:52:54.000 --> 02:52:59.000
Thanks again, you guys. Sincerely, gamer girl. This is Michelle.

02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:09.000
And she and I have had a few talks in our time over many things, and she hasn't had an easy time with some things.

02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:13.000
So I'm glad that we could be there for you. I'm glad that you've become friends of ours.

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:19.000
And I'm certainly glad that you and DT have found the happy hookup.

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:23.000
Which is so... I don't want to say weird, because that makes it a negative.

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:26.000
It's a happy weird. It's a good weird. Like me, a good weird.

02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:27.000
Unexpected.

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:34.000
It's weird in a good way to me, like the impact that this show has had on that level.

02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:37.000
Where people's lives have been affected by this.

02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:38.000
It's uncanny.

02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:39.000
So...

02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:40.000
How's that, Rob? Un-canny.

02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:42.000
Yeah, I don't... I mean, it's...

02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:43.000
There are no cans here.

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:49.000
It's amazing. I mean, in a way. I mean, I knew Allen on LiveJournal for years.

02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:54.000
But it wasn't really until he started listening to this show that he started to get to know me better.

02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:58.000
And now we live in sin.

02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:03.000
I'm glad you're adopting that. We were talking about that before the show.

02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:05.000
When Prop 8's overturned.

02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:07.000
We hope. We hope.

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:08.000
Well, it's gonna happen.

02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:10.000
It's only a matter of time.

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:15.000
Even if it's not the Supreme Court that does it, it'll just go back to a vote and it'll get overturned then.

02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:22.000
But I was saying that instead of answering the, when you're gonna get married, you should say, we're gonna live in sin.

02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:28.000
The thing I dread most when Prop 8 gets overturned is that I'm just gonna get that nod.

02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:31.000
So when are you and Allen gonna get married? When are you and Allen gonna get married?

02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:34.000
And it's like, when we're damn good and ready.

02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:39.000
But Jamie said I should answer that question. We enjoy living in sin.

02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:41.000
I like that.

02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:53.000
Oh, yeah. You know, I was actually gonna say, you know, I think when people start sort of discounting the whole internet thing.

02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:57.000
Keep in mind, I met my husband online. Okay?

02:54:57.000 --> 02:55:10.000
Dan and I were two dumb, young, twinny anime nerds that liked playing Street Fighter and talking about the Japanese versions of Marvel superheroes.

02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:17.000
And, you know, he liked pinball and I thought pinball was cool. And then just we talked it out.

02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:23.000
And six months after we started talking on the phone, I was like, hey, I'm about to lose my job. Can I come live with you?

02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:32.000
I guess. I'm gonna go see Batman, which is pretty much how that conversation went. And I was on a plane, you know, a month later.

02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:39.000
I met Dan when his username was DarkRioga and I was Dark Uchon. How's that?

02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:45.000
I actually had Dark Uchon before I had Dark Sakura, just saying.

02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:50.000
So Ranma calls me by my oldest, oldest nickname.

02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:58.000
So, how, you know, you met Alan online, although didn't you have a previous sort of meeting?

02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:05.000
No, we knew each other on LiveJournal. Alan and I knew each other on the website LiveJournal, which I realize some of you don't even know.

02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:12.000
But we were just friends on there. I don't even remember how we got friended. Alan! He has to be hearing this. Alan!

02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:14.000
Excuse me.

02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:15.000
Does he have headphones on?

02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:16.000
It's a night of honesty.

02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:24.000
Oh, here he is. Alan, since we're all drunk, we're having real talk. How did we meet on LiveJournal? Like, how did we become friends on LiveJournal? Because I honest to God can't remember.

02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:30.000
It was through comments of either Slagkicks Journal or Spikes Journal.

02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:32.000
Oh, wow.

02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:33.000
Yeah.

02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:35.000
So, are friends over at GameBooey.org?

02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:37.000
Yeah.

02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:51.000
I think you friended me through the comments there and we got to know each other for a few years that way. But, like, you were my friend on LiveJournal through the whole X who shall not be named Voldemort.

02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:56.000
Republican Voldemort relationship.

02:56:56.000 --> 02:56:58.000
I knew it and you exactly knew who you were talking about.

02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:03.000
I had. It's like you knew me then and you kind of saw that play out. But then we didn't-

02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:05.000
Hey, he gave me a sparkly pin.

02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:11.000
We didn't meet until we met at Video Games Live in Oakland, right?

02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:24.000
That barely counts because we shook hands and then the lights went down to suggest, to show, to say that the show was starting. So, but yeah, we got to look at each other then.

02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:31.000
And then when did you, you started listening to OLR and then that's when we started talking more and writing?

02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:32.000
Yeah.

02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:34.000
So, this show, Ruining Lives.

02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:36.000
By the way-

02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:37.000
Bringing them together.

02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:40.000
They're asking if RuPaul would be the Reverend and I said no, Peter's Christ.

02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:41.000
No, no.

02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:46.000
Since Jamie said RuPaul, do you know that Raven and Jujubee are playing about that tonight?

02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:54.000
Yes, I'm aware. So, I just want you all to know I'm skipping drag queens to be here for the 11th birthday. That's how much I love you all.

02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:56.000
They're amazing.

02:57:57.000 --> 02:57:59.000
Who, the drag queens or the listeners?

02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:00.000
Everybody.

02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:01.000
Everybody.

02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:03.000
What a safe answer.

02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:05.000
I love him. All right.

02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:17.000
So, so yeah, anyone who ever wants to poo poo on the internet say, fuck you. People get married on the internet or together or they get together on the internet joined, joined. That's good, we're joined.

02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:19.000
Live in sin.

02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:24.000
Live in sin. I lived in sin with Dan for seven years and then we finally just said, fuck it.

02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:26.000
Nothing wrong with a little sin.

02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:28.000
Yeah. I like sin.

02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:29.000
Are we?

02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:30.000
It tastes like tequila.

02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:38.000
It's 9.30 and we need to keep the show moving. So, let's get to the FUs. Oh, mailbag at orangesontrated.com if you want to send us an email.

02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:40.000
That's it. I'm not reading anymore.

02:58:41.000 --> 02:58:42.000
That was it though, wasn't it?

02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:44.000
That's pretty much it.

02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:46.000
All right. Mailbag at orangesontrated.com. In the meanwhile, FUs of the week. Let's try to make them quick.

02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:00.000
This is fucked up.

02:59:02.000 --> 02:59:09.000
I would like to say FU to the collision detection on JB Mon's body for hitting his tattoo.

02:59:10.000 --> 02:59:16.000
And the stupid bitch face. And I'm saying bitch face because I don't know who the fuck it was, but whatever.

02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:24.000
Okay, people, I don't know if it's a California thing or what, but when people change lanes and they're on the inside lane, you're supposed to stay in the inside lane.

02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:30.000
When you are on the outside part of the turn lane, you're supposed to go into the second lane, not the third.

02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:34.000
Well, bitch face decides to go from the inside lane into the second lane where I was.

02:59:35.000 --> 02:59:40.000
Where I was legally because you're not supposed to change lanes in the fucking intersection. Fuck. Okay.

02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:43.000
Care to follow that, JB Mon?

02:59:44.000 --> 02:59:45.000
Fuck.

02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:51.000
FUs and myself because the tequila is just hitting me now and I forgot the FU that I had to land.

02:59:52.000 --> 02:59:53.000
Sure you're going to be able to drive?

02:59:54.000 --> 02:59:55.000
Maybe.

02:59:56.000 --> 02:59:57.000
We better talk later. Alright.

03:00:00.000 --> 03:00:01.000
Loki.

03:00:01.000 --> 03:00:02.000
Fuck you, the pointers.

03:00:03.000 --> 03:00:04.000
Oh, you and your programming.

03:00:06.000 --> 03:00:10.000
And my FU of the week goes to having to get up at 6.30 tomorrow for the job.

03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:13.000
But I love my job, but I don't like getting up early for it, that's all.

03:00:14.000 --> 03:00:18.000
Alright, just a couple quick stories for you guys. We got to get to the Skypline. Loki.

03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:25.000
Real quick, there was an opinion piece on Polygon and I just thought it kind of brought up an interesting point.

03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:33.000
They're talking about Microsoft and Sony and kind of Microsoft backpedaling in their DRM focus and stuff like that.

03:00:34.000 --> 03:00:47.000
And they're saying that while this is a good thing right now, there is a very good chance that they're going to introduce some fun features like the game sharing and stuff to kind of draw people more to digital.

03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:50.000
Where they're going to implement this DRM.

03:00:51.000 --> 03:01:07.000
So that basically, very well now we have a good situation where the consumer feels like it has a lot of power that this could very well change over time to kind of be back to where they wanted it to be in the first place.

03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:13.000
I don't know if that's going to actually happen. I think a lot of people would be kind of hesitant.

03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:19.000
Once again, it's all about how they explain how they're going to do things.

03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:32.000
If they have a good way of explaining it and basically it makes it well worth it as far as the incentives to going this route, then by all means I guess they could try doing that.

03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:38.000
If there's enough pluses to it versus the negatives, then it's just going to have to weigh it.

03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:49.000
I don't think that they're going to go back like that, but I do think that they may bring back some of the features that they took away from the Xbox One.

03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:52.000
Maybe the game sharing and stuff like that.

03:01:53.000 --> 03:01:59.000
Although, if it was what the rumor would be from that pay spin or whatever and it was just a demo, that's kind of lame anyways.

03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:03.000
I mean, they do that with PlayStation Plus where you get demos for a bunch of games.

03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:09.000
All I'm going to say, again, the simplest way I can put it, what are the positives to outweigh the negatives?

03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:11.000
Exactly.

03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:13.000
Explain that better, you'll get it.

03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:20.000
Alright, real quick, because I want to get to our Skype line at 1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:25.000
Real quick tonight, because we're running long due to the technical difficulties in the studio earlier.

03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:29.000
And I apologize because it is an anniversary episode, so I'm sure there's a few of you that want to call in.

03:02:30.000 --> 03:02:35.000
But quickly, quickly on this story here, EA is confirming no online passes.

03:02:36.000 --> 03:02:39.000
Even in spite of the news this week, online passes will not be coming back.

03:02:40.000 --> 03:02:46.000
This is from Senior Director of Corporate Communications John Riesberg for EA.

03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:50.000
Quote, there is no change to our decision to discontinue online pass. It is dead.

03:02:51.000 --> 03:02:56.000
As we said a few weeks ago, none of our new EA titles will include online pass and we are removing it from existing games as well.

03:02:57.000 --> 03:03:02.000
Nothing else on today's news, but did want to be clear that our online pass decision was based on player feedback and there's no change.

03:03:03.000 --> 03:03:04.000
Long live the Cloud Pass.

03:03:05.000 --> 03:03:10.000
Hallelujah. Oh yeah, the Cloud Pass. Don't talk like that.

03:03:10.000 --> 03:03:17.000
Don't talk like that. Alright. 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio if you'd like to give us a call.

03:03:18.000 --> 03:03:23.000
And yeah, we'll get to the phones there. Meanwhile, Twitter topics and last minute stories.

03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:32.000
I bet you didn't know that today, this day, is actually the 22nd birthday of Sonic the Hedgehog.

03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:35.000
That's right. I heard we share a birthday with Sonic.

03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:37.000
It's that 23 thing, you know?

03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:43.000
Did you know that I flew out here on the 23rd of January? No, I didn't know that. Years and years ago.

03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:46.000
Well, I probably did know that, but I just forgot.

03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:49.000
Jeez, Rab. Jeez.

03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:51.000
We've been out here 15 years, jeez.

03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:56.000
Our phones are lighting up, so let's go to them and see who's online. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

03:03:57.000 --> 03:04:00.000
You know, you wanted to go see Raven, but you got me instead. Raven's Dolphin.

03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:03.000
What up, Raven's Dolphin? Hi. It's video.

03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:05.000
I love special occasions. I know now you get to see the video.

03:04:06.000 --> 03:04:08.000
And he has ponies, I'm leaving the room.

03:04:09.000 --> 03:04:11.000
That's exactly why I called, but let's not talk about them.

03:04:12.000 --> 03:04:13.000
You're a brony, it's cool, it's cool.

03:04:14.000 --> 03:04:15.000
I didn't say that.

03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:17.000
I don't know, alright.

03:04:18.000 --> 03:04:19.000
That's not true.

03:04:20.000 --> 03:04:25.000
I see two big dolls, and I see one, two, three, four little ones, and two little, what are those hamsters? I can't tell, it's fuzzy.

03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:28.000
I would forgive you if you had a classic one up there.

03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:31.000
I promise you, there won't be any talk about that.

03:04:31.000 --> 03:04:38.000
Alright, fair enough. Well, Raven's Dolphin, I love special episodes because it's the only time you ever call in anymore, so what's on your mind, buddy?

03:04:39.000 --> 03:04:44.000
You make it sound like, oh, Raven just shows up to special events. I listened, I listened to you guys.

03:04:45.000 --> 03:04:47.000
No, there's nothing wrong with that. I'm just razzing you. What's up, buddy?

03:04:48.000 --> 03:04:52.000
You know, I wanted to talk about the whole DRM thing. I know everyone wants to talk about that.

03:04:52.000 --> 03:04:53.000
Of course.

03:04:54.000 --> 03:05:00.000
For me, for me being a gamer so long is, I didn't like how Microsoft's tone to everything.

03:05:01.000 --> 03:05:12.000
Like, when they said about the submarines, about the people like, oh, we got a box for you, the 360, or when they say all kinds of draconian shit, it makes me, my head just explodes.

03:05:13.000 --> 03:05:19.000
I'm like, you're drowning yourself, so their tone for me is why I bought a PlayStation 4.

03:05:19.000 --> 03:05:25.000
Hmm. How did you feel when you heard about the reversal, though, despite that tone?

03:05:26.000 --> 03:05:33.000
I mean, I know Bobby wanted to push innovation and all that stuff, and I get that. I totally get Bobby's point. I've listened to him, you know.

03:05:34.000 --> 03:05:39.000
But the reversal, I think, was key. Like, people are like, but this is going to slow growth.

03:05:40.000 --> 03:05:50.000
But Microsoft tried to force us into what I think of a future that wasn't ready. For me, I wasn't ready for that future because I like my internet connection.

03:05:51.000 --> 03:05:56.000
I like all that stuff, but I live with a bunch of jackasses that can take it away from me in two seconds.

03:05:57.000 --> 03:06:03.000
So for me, it's like I have this thing that is a brick. I know. Your family don't have this, but my family is fucked up about the internet.

03:06:04.000 --> 03:06:13.000
What did I say earlier in the show about diversity and everyone's life is different and it affects those opinions that we have, you know? Certainly.

03:06:14.000 --> 03:06:23.000
Yes, so it would be a big, shiny $500 brick. So for me, it's like the offline mode. You know, the online is important, but I don't want to be married to it.

03:06:24.000 --> 03:06:34.000
I think that's fair. Well, okay, you said you pre-ordered a PlayStation 4. I'm sorry, you said you're going to get a PlayStation 4. So what are you looking forward to on PlayStation 4?

03:06:35.000 --> 03:06:40.000
You know, believe it or not, I'm looking forward to absolutely none of the exclusives Battlefield 4.

03:06:41.000 --> 03:06:46.000
That's fair, though. You know, the third-party games are important, too.

03:06:46.000 --> 03:06:56.000
And I do a lot of you streaming stuff, so I'm like, that's why I want to get that. I'm like, well, it's the cheapest, Battlefield 4, it's going to look great. It was a done deal.

03:06:57.000 --> 03:06:58.000
The games will come.

03:06:59.000 --> 03:07:04.000
Alright, fair enough. Sounds good to me. I'll see you online because I ordered a PlayStation 4 as well.

03:07:05.000 --> 03:07:11.000
I know we have to go, but one more thing. I mean, just one more thing. You're still sticking with the PS4, even with the reversal?

03:07:12.000 --> 03:07:13.000
Yes.

03:07:14.000 --> 03:07:15.000
Same here, same here.

03:07:16.000 --> 03:07:23.000
No, no, I agree with Rob. I thought I was going to come in here and I'm like, oh, Rob's going to switch. Oh, Rob's going to switch.

03:07:24.000 --> 03:07:31.000
No, why would I switch? All the games I won are on PlayStation 4 as well. There's a handful of Xbox-only games, but I can address that in 2014 when they'll actually be out.

03:07:32.000 --> 03:07:34.000
Because I know me and you, we're excited for Killer Instinct.

03:07:35.000 --> 03:07:42.000
Killer Instinct, the way it is, especially because Rare is not developing it, really just isn't enough for me. It's not $100 good.

03:07:43.000 --> 03:07:44.000
I agree. Totally agree.

03:07:44.000 --> 03:07:51.000
And I'm not hating on Microsoft. I mean, as I've been telling people that are like, oh, you're Sony fanboy and so forth, I'm like, hey, attention everybody.

03:07:52.000 --> 03:08:00.000
I bought Xbox 360 at launch and I bought PlayStation 3 a year after it launched. So I'm just doing the reverse this time. What's wrong with that?

03:08:01.000 --> 03:08:09.000
Nothing. And for me, it came down to the price and I said, okay, this works out for me. I just had enough money. When they said $400, I went like, sold. Where's GameStop?

03:08:09.000 --> 03:08:20.000
It's the price. And I'm going to be honest, I think Xbox One is going to be under pressure to drop that price. Maybe not holiday, but in 2014, around the time I'm looking to get one.

03:08:21.000 --> 03:08:33.000
And that's probably when I'll finally pick one up. Despite what folks may be saying otherwise about Kinect and so forth, I just kind of think the $499 price won't last forever, just like the $599 on PlayStation 3 didn't.

03:08:34.000 --> 03:08:36.000
Nope. It dropped like a rock. Thank you for your time.

03:08:36.000 --> 03:08:39.000
You are welcome, Ravenstaufen. Always a delight to hear from you. You take care.

03:08:40.000 --> 03:08:41.000
I will. Bye.

03:08:42.000 --> 03:08:46.000
Let's get to some more calls. Our phone lines are lighting up. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

03:08:47.000 --> 03:08:48.000
Hey, it's Drew. How you guys doing?

03:08:49.000 --> 03:08:51.000
Oh my gosh, Drew. Intern Drew.

03:08:52.000 --> 03:08:53.000
And happy birthday to you, sir.

03:08:54.000 --> 03:09:00.000
Happy birthday to you. Three hours left. Your show, well, I don't know about your show, but our show,

03:09:01.000 --> 03:09:02.000
It's the Drew show.

03:09:03.000 --> 03:09:05.000
Our show and your life share the same birthday.

03:09:06.000 --> 03:09:08.000
It's the Drew show. Sorry, Drew.

03:09:09.000 --> 03:09:11.000
So you're 30 now, right?

03:09:12.000 --> 03:09:13.000
Twenty-eight.

03:09:14.000 --> 03:09:15.000
Thirty-thirty.

03:09:16.000 --> 03:09:17.000
Oh my gosh.

03:09:18.000 --> 03:09:20.000
Holy crap. I mean, I was 17 when we started out.

03:09:21.000 --> 03:09:22.000
That is nuts.

03:09:23.000 --> 03:09:24.000
Our former young Republican.

03:09:25.000 --> 03:09:29.000
I remember when you were 18 and that blows my fucking mind. But anyway, this isn't about me.

03:09:30.000 --> 03:09:32.000
I remember when you were legal to drink and that was hilarious.

03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:34.000
What did you call in about tonight?

03:09:35.000 --> 03:09:38.000
I was just going to chime in on the whole.

03:09:39.000 --> 03:09:41.000
It's a hot topic these days.

03:09:42.000 --> 03:09:48.000
The Xbox One versus PS4 thing with Microsoft doing the whole back barrel.

03:09:49.000 --> 03:09:53.000
It's going to be the hot topic for about four more months until these consoles are out.

03:09:54.000 --> 03:09:55.000
So by all means, five more months.

03:09:56.000 --> 03:09:58.000
Oh, geez. You know, I'm still not convinced.

03:09:59.000 --> 03:10:02.000
Honest. They thought they could float it past us, didn't they?

03:10:02.000 --> 03:10:06.000
They thought, oh, this is going to be the next big thing. This is going to change the future of gaming.

03:10:07.000 --> 03:10:08.000
After all, Steam is doing it.

03:10:09.000 --> 03:10:11.000
The difference is, Steam started from nothing.

03:10:12.000 --> 03:10:17.000
Steam had something going there that kind of changed the way we look at PC gaming.

03:10:18.000 --> 03:10:20.000
I don't think that console gaming is ready for this at all.

03:10:21.000 --> 03:10:23.000
They might not ever be.

03:10:24.000 --> 03:10:28.000
Am I understanding you correctly that you're saying you reject both these consoles right now?

03:10:28.000 --> 03:10:31.000
If I was going to go for it, I'd go for PS4.

03:10:32.000 --> 03:10:36.000
But for practical reasons, I've got a whole bunch of PS3 games in Backlog right now.

03:10:37.000 --> 03:10:40.000
I only jumped on PS3 in October.

03:10:41.000 --> 03:10:43.000
So I've got a whole bunch of catch-up to do.

03:10:44.000 --> 03:10:46.000
But if I had to choose and came into it, it'd probably be a PS4.

03:10:47.000 --> 03:10:48.000
You know, I think we do...

03:10:49.000 --> 03:10:52.000
Although it sounds like if you were going to be getting one, you get the PlayStation 4.

03:10:53.000 --> 03:10:56.000
I think we oftentimes have been ignoring in the script.

03:10:56.000 --> 03:10:59.000
I think we oftentimes have been ignoring in this great debate...

03:11:00.000 --> 03:11:02.000
Debate plus battle equals debattle.

03:11:03.000 --> 03:11:06.000
In this great debattle that we're having about PlayStation 4 versus Xbox One,

03:11:07.000 --> 03:11:09.000
I think we oftentimes forget that there are many people, yourself included,

03:11:10.000 --> 03:11:12.000
and probably many of our chatters that are like,

03:11:13.000 --> 03:11:14.000
You know what? I'm not getting either one this year.

03:11:15.000 --> 03:11:20.000
I'm going to just stick with the consoles I have because I got Grand Theft Auto 5 and Saints Row 4.

03:11:21.000 --> 03:11:24.000
Was it just this week they even announced that Thief is going to be on PS3 and Xbox 360?

03:11:24.000 --> 03:11:27.000
Yeah, a lot of stuff is still coming out on the current consoles.

03:11:28.000 --> 03:11:29.000
So where's my real incentive to upgrade?

03:11:30.000 --> 03:11:31.000
Maybe I'm just not ready until 2015.

03:11:32.000 --> 03:11:34.000
I'm not a first-day adapter for a lot of consoles.

03:11:35.000 --> 03:11:38.000
I got burned the first time around when I got the DS app the first time.

03:11:39.000 --> 03:11:42.000
That had a hell of a sort of game library, didn't it?

03:11:43.000 --> 03:11:46.000
Yeah, I think there's a lot of people in your camp. There is.

03:11:47.000 --> 03:11:50.000
Yeah, you know, I subscribe to, you know, Jamie's mantra.

03:11:51.000 --> 03:11:53.000
Game is only good as the games, uh, systems only good as the games are honest.

03:11:54.000 --> 03:11:58.000
And for the most part, I'm not impressed with Xbox One yet.

03:11:59.000 --> 03:12:01.000
And I'm not impressed by the PS4.

03:12:02.000 --> 03:12:03.000
Like, okay, fine. Kingdom Hearts 3.

03:12:04.000 --> 03:12:06.000
After you've got 15 sequels, you can finally count to three.

03:12:07.000 --> 03:12:08.000
Okay, fine. Show me more.

03:12:09.000 --> 03:12:12.000
And maybe I'll get it when it comes out, what, two, three years later?

03:12:13.000 --> 03:12:14.000
And it has legs?

03:12:14.000 --> 03:12:15.000
So for you-

03:12:16.000 --> 03:12:19.000
You know how I'm waiting on my free order for, uh, Tell the Zillion.

03:12:20.000 --> 03:12:22.000
So for you, you want the games to be out there.

03:12:23.000 --> 03:12:26.000
You want the games to be in your hand and then you can have a discussion about the consoles.

03:12:27.000 --> 03:12:29.000
Yeah, why else would you get a console?

03:12:30.000 --> 03:12:31.000
You want the games, right?

03:12:32.000 --> 03:12:33.000
That's a good question.

03:12:34.000 --> 03:12:35.000
I'm not impressed yet.

03:12:36.000 --> 03:12:38.000
Alright, well, Drew, I gotta wrap up and let you go, but any other final thoughts for us?

03:12:39.000 --> 03:12:42.000
Yeah, it's been a wild ride so far. Hope it keeps on going.

03:12:42.000 --> 03:12:48.000
Alright, you should come visit the show sometime. I have a nice solid table that the soundboard sits on so you can't knock it over.

03:12:49.000 --> 03:12:50.000
We interned Bruce to see you.

03:12:55.000 --> 03:12:56.000
Alright, take care, Drew. I gotta let you go.

03:12:57.000 --> 03:12:58.000
Peace.

03:12:58.000 --> 03:12:59.000
Bye.

03:13:00.000 --> 03:13:03.000
The phone calls are always a little spotty, too.

03:13:03.000 --> 03:13:13.000
Shadownextgen in chat says, Rob, could it be argued that your incentive to upgrade to next-gen disappeared with Microsoft's reversal? Just a question.

03:13:14.000 --> 03:13:20.000
Um, I'm not exactly sure what you mean by that because, I mean, especially when it comes to Microsoft.

03:13:21.000 --> 03:13:25.000
Microsoft does have some exclusive games that I want to check out at some point.

03:13:26.000 --> 03:13:27.000
They're not gonna be out at launch.

03:13:27.000 --> 03:13:39.000
To be fair, PlayStation 3 is not gonna have all their exclusives out at launch either, but I still feel like there'll be enough third-party stuff where I'm just gonna opt for PlayStation 3 at first because, honestly, it's the cheaper option.

03:13:40.000 --> 03:13:49.000
There's one exclusive, actually, that Microsoft had, Titanfall, that actually, this week, the news that it's multiplayer only kind of makes me don't want to buy it.

03:13:50.000 --> 03:13:51.000
I didn't even know that.

03:13:52.000 --> 03:13:53.000
Yeah, I just heard this week there's no single-player campaign.

03:13:54.000 --> 03:13:55.000
I am less excited about that game now.

03:13:55.000 --> 03:14:03.000
Interesting. Okay, let me get back to some more calls because our phone is being off the hook. There's lots of people trying to get through, so I'm hoping we can get as many calls as we can tonight.

03:14:04.000 --> 03:14:05.000
Hi, on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

03:14:06.000 --> 03:14:10.000
Well, it's the one and only Ranma, and, you know, we can't have a birthday celebration without the normal tradition.

03:14:11.000 --> 03:14:12.000
Oh, you missed it.

03:14:12.000 --> 03:14:13.000
I like your hat.

03:14:13.000 --> 03:14:14.000
You missed it in part A, Ranma.

03:14:14.000 --> 03:14:15.000
Oh, my God, I need to see your hat.

03:14:16.000 --> 03:14:17.000
My fellow New Yorker.

03:14:18.000 --> 03:14:20.000
That is awesome. You've totally inspired me to make a hat.

03:14:21.000 --> 03:14:23.000
It's not. It's a sailor. What sailor is that?

03:14:23.000 --> 03:14:24.000
It's an Artemis hat.

03:14:25.000 --> 03:14:26.000
Oh, an Artemis hat.

03:14:27.000 --> 03:14:28.000
Yes, it is.

03:14:29.000 --> 03:14:30.000
Okay, all right.

03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:46.000
You know, you guys had me cracking up this whole episode. Before I get into what I called in for, let me just say this. I wish we had an Arby's and a Hardee's here in New York, and I would have loved to have seen Microsoft roll out the whole way it is going to do with the games.

03:14:46.000 --> 03:14:58.000
Because it's really been funny if, let's say, Kingdom Hearts 3 comes out for both systems, you go into the store, PlayStation 4 version, $59.99, Xbox One version, $39.99. Talk about a slap in the face.

03:14:59.000 --> 03:15:09.000
Now, Nat, that would have been a one-up in the war. I would have loved to see if game prices start changing, and that would have been the huge plus, and I think I said that in an earlier episode.

03:15:09.000 --> 03:15:17.000
If DRM policies, heck yeah, sure, bring them on if it's going to slice all my new game prices in half, but we all know that's not going to happen.

03:15:18.000 --> 03:15:28.000
For the record, Rama, I believe both companies have come out and said $59.99 is the ceiling for their game prices, outside of collector's editions and all that.

03:15:29.000 --> 03:15:36.000
So we're going to be looking at game prices similar to what we have this generation, except now Nintendo's in that club, too, because Wii U games are also $59.99.

03:15:36.000 --> 03:15:41.000
Although some buck the trend. Game and Wario today, only $39.99.

03:15:42.000 --> 03:15:43.000
Yeah, pretty much.

03:15:44.000 --> 03:15:45.000
So anyway, Rama.

03:15:46.000 --> 03:15:54.000
Okay, so here on my table are three different alcohols. We have the 12-year-old Glenn Fittich, because the 15-year-old got killed at PAX East.

03:15:54.000 --> 03:16:06.000
We have this nice 10-cane rum, and the alcohol that put Jovidea and almost everybody in my room on their ass, Spiritus, which is 192 proof.

03:16:07.000 --> 03:16:08.000
Oh my god.

03:16:09.000 --> 03:16:13.000
So you guys get to pick which one I will do the traditional shot for.

03:16:14.000 --> 03:16:16.000
Spiritus, Spiritus, Spiritus.

03:16:17.000 --> 03:16:20.000
Actually, I was going to say the Glenn Fittich, because I'm partial to Scotch.

03:16:21.000 --> 03:16:22.000
You guys are assholes, okay?

03:16:22.000 --> 03:16:24.000
Hey, I say Glenn Fittich. It's Scotch.

03:16:25.000 --> 03:16:27.000
Well, it makes half and half.

03:16:28.000 --> 03:16:32.000
No, you don't make, you do not dilute Glenn Fittich with anything.

03:16:33.000 --> 03:16:34.000
Then he takes one, then the other.

03:16:35.000 --> 03:16:41.000
Let the man take his shot. Here he goes. He's pouring it into the glass. 192 proof, ladies and gentlemen.

03:16:42.000 --> 03:16:44.000
I remember that Fauna making show up for where we polished off a bottle.

03:16:45.000 --> 03:16:47.000
Twilight Sparkle shot glass, okay?

03:16:48.000 --> 03:16:49.000
Love it.

03:16:49.000 --> 03:16:50.000
Good lord.

03:16:50.000 --> 03:16:54.000
Here's to you, here's to me, the best of friends we'll ever be.

03:16:55.000 --> 03:16:59.000
If you're ever happy to disagree, well, fuck you guys, and here's to me.

03:17:00.000 --> 03:17:01.000
Woo!

03:17:02.000 --> 03:17:03.000
Amazing.

03:17:04.000 --> 03:17:05.000
Oh. Oh.

03:17:07.000 --> 03:17:09.000
He just had a Rob moment right there.

03:17:10.000 --> 03:17:11.000
It's not just me.

03:17:12.000 --> 03:17:14.000
No, no, that's not as bad as Rob going, running across.

03:17:15.000 --> 03:17:16.000
Rob ran in circles doing flappy hands.

03:17:17.000 --> 03:17:18.000
I really did.

03:17:18.000 --> 03:17:22.000
Rob, do you wonder how strong this is? Go find a bottle of rubbing alcohol and get a quick whiff.

03:17:23.000 --> 03:17:29.000
No. Keep in mind, you remember what I was raised with, right? Everclear.

03:17:30.000 --> 03:17:33.000
Have an Everclear story to tell you later.

03:17:34.000 --> 03:17:35.000
Tell me later.

03:17:36.000 --> 03:17:41.000
Because you're here now, I want to make sure we get this out because I forgot to do it in part A because of all the other stuff going on tonight with technical failures in 11 years.

03:17:41.000 --> 03:17:49.000
But in seven days here at the Voice2Geeks network, we are gearing up for something really exciting that you guys are going to be bringing to us over at Anime Jam Session.

03:17:50.000 --> 03:17:52.000
Do you want to kind of kick off the promotion for that this week, Rama?

03:17:53.000 --> 03:18:08.000
Why certainly. Well, next Sunday is Senshi Matsuri. It's a Sailor Moon themed anime convention to celebrate the birthday of Usagi Tsukino, which is June 30th, and for the excitement of the new anime and the new merchandise that's coming out.

03:18:08.000 --> 03:18:17.000
What we're going to do is advertise some of the events that we'll be going on, such as opening, closing ceremonies, and the performance by Senshi Generation as well.

03:18:18.000 --> 03:18:21.000
Awesome. And that is all going to be streaming here at the Voice2Geeks network.

03:18:22.000 --> 03:18:23.000
That's right.

03:18:24.000 --> 03:18:27.000
That's right. So vognetwork.com, Anime Jam Session will be bringing us, can you say the name one more time while I learn it?

03:18:28.000 --> 03:18:30.000
Sure. It's Senshi Matsuri.

03:18:31.000 --> 03:18:35.000
Senshi Matsuri will be live at the Voice2Geeks network at bright and early 9 a.m. Pacific.

03:18:36.000 --> 03:18:37.000
Warrior Festival.

03:18:38.000 --> 03:18:39.000
That is when that all starts one week from today.

03:18:40.000 --> 03:18:43.000
And, Rama, I got to admit, your Japanese has come a long way.

03:18:44.000 --> 03:18:46.000
It really hasn't really. It only took 11 years.

03:18:47.000 --> 03:18:49.000
Rob's gotten a lot better, but there's still a few things he needs to look at.

03:18:50.000 --> 03:18:53.000
Never taken a class, but maybe, maybe I will for you guys for the 12 year.

03:18:54.000 --> 03:18:56.000
All right, Rama, I got to let you go so we can wrap up, but take care, buddy.

03:18:57.000 --> 03:18:58.000
You stay fabulous.

03:18:59.000 --> 03:19:00.000
All right, stay black. Bye.

03:19:01.000 --> 03:19:03.000
All right. Always love hearing from Rama.

03:19:04.000 --> 03:19:06.000
I am so sorry, you guys. There's like five other people trying to get through.

03:19:07.000 --> 03:19:11.000
I've got to shut off the phones because it's almost 10 o'clock and some of us have to get home.

03:19:12.000 --> 03:19:13.000
I am home, thank God.

03:19:14.000 --> 03:19:18.000
But anyway, very much looking forward to that next Sunday.

03:19:19.000 --> 03:19:20.000
We got to wrap up.

03:19:21.000 --> 03:19:22.000
I want to do some Twitter topics quickly.

03:19:23.000 --> 03:19:25.000
I don't know if you have last minute stories, Loki, while I bring these up.

03:19:25.000 --> 03:19:32.000
Just that it's rumored that Sony's going to announce more games for next year at Gamescom.

03:19:34.000 --> 03:19:38.000
Some tweets tonight. TigerClaw305 sends us a few tweets.

03:19:39.000 --> 03:19:41.000
Miyamoto on women as characters in Nintendo games.

03:19:42.000 --> 03:19:48.000
I did see this because he talked about not just like women, but like gay characters and so forth in the games.

03:19:48.000 --> 03:19:57.000
And it did strike me as kind of like a progressive maybe modernizing theme thing.

03:19:58.000 --> 03:20:05.000
And it talked about how like Peach wasn't really considered until kind of like Peach was a late add into this Mario game that's coming out.

03:20:06.000 --> 03:20:09.000
But it's a great thing. I'm trying to find a quote here to give here.

03:20:10.000 --> 03:20:15.000
Oh, I guess for me in particular, the structure of the gameplay always comes before story.

03:20:15.000 --> 03:20:21.000
And so we're always looking at when we're putting that together, what is the most natural story to take place within that structure?

03:20:22.000 --> 03:20:33.000
So if we end up creating a gameplay structure where it makes sense for, whether it's a female to go rescue a male or a gay man to rescue a lesbian woman or a lesbian woman to rescue a gay man, we might take that approach.

03:20:34.000 --> 03:20:37.000
So he just wants it to feel natural in the games.

03:20:38.000 --> 03:20:41.000
I want my lesbian from Animal Crossing to be a hero.

03:20:42.000 --> 03:20:43.000
Someday.

03:20:43.000 --> 03:20:44.000
I'm crossing lesbian the game.

03:20:45.000 --> 03:20:51.000
I guess I also kind of get the sense that like maybe there's a lot of damsel in distress type stories because it's kind of the easy thing to do.

03:20:52.000 --> 03:20:58.000
And Nintendo's just more focused on the gameplay, but Miyamoto definitely sounds like open to, you know, if it makes sense, let's do it.

03:20:59.000 --> 03:21:00.000
This is the world we live in right now.

03:21:01.000 --> 03:21:05.000
It sounds like he wants to make it organic and not like force it in just for the sake of having it.

03:21:06.000 --> 03:21:09.000
Yes, which I think is the right thing to do. Nobody wants it to feel forced.

03:21:10.000 --> 03:21:11.000
That's what she said.

03:21:11.000 --> 03:21:12.000
Stop.

03:21:13.000 --> 03:21:18.000
Nobody wants a game where it's like, you know, the roles are reversed just for the sake of the role being reversed.

03:21:19.000 --> 03:21:20.000
Yes.

03:21:21.000 --> 03:21:26.000
The ROM hack that guy did for Donkey Kong was pretty cool. I mean, there's exceptions, but that wasn't like an endorsed thing.

03:21:27.000 --> 03:21:28.000
Otherwise you'd get like Super Princess Peach.

03:21:31.000 --> 03:21:34.000
Anyway, I thought that was a good story. I wish we had more time to get into that.

03:21:34.000 --> 03:21:40.000
Tiger Claw also tweeted us the Heavy Gear Assault Kickstarter was canceled, but they're going to be doing crowdfunding on their own.

03:21:41.000 --> 03:21:42.000
Hmm.

03:21:43.000 --> 03:21:48.000
Spazinator says there's a free table on the Steam version of Pinball FX2 as of a few days ago.

03:21:49.000 --> 03:21:50.000
Those of you who like free stuff, go get it.

03:21:51.000 --> 03:21:56.000
Eric RPG tweeted us Mega Man Unlimited is done and it beams down in July.

03:21:57.000 --> 03:22:00.000
And this is a fan made production of Mega Man.

03:22:01.000 --> 03:22:02.000
Very cool.

03:22:02.000 --> 03:22:06.000
Lots of well wishes all over Twitter for the 11 year birthday.

03:22:07.000 --> 03:22:08.000
And I just want to say a general thank you.

03:22:09.000 --> 03:22:14.000
Thank you for all the well wishes. We really couldn't do it without you guys.

03:22:15.000 --> 03:22:16.000
You guys are great.

03:22:17.000 --> 03:22:22.000
You know what? I want a game where a woman rescues a man without becoming a romantic interest.

03:22:23.000 --> 03:22:24.000
Just saying.

03:22:25.000 --> 03:22:31.000
How many movies do you have out there with a female protagonist that ends up with some sort of romantic tanglement with the dude in the movie?

03:22:32.000 --> 03:22:34.000
I want Hardcore Chick the game.

03:22:35.000 --> 03:22:37.000
Who don't need no man to complete her life.

03:22:38.000 --> 03:22:39.000
Ain't got time for that.

03:22:40.000 --> 03:22:41.000
Ain't nobody got time for that.

03:22:42.000 --> 03:22:46.000
Well, we got about enough time left to wrap up the show and get on out of here.

03:22:47.000 --> 03:22:49.000
Because it's almost 1am for you crazy East Coasters.

03:22:50.000 --> 03:22:51.000
JVMon, are you still on East Coast time?

03:22:52.000 --> 03:22:53.000
Are you still on East Coast time?

03:22:54.000 --> 03:22:55.000
I'm on tequila time right now.

03:22:56.000 --> 03:22:58.000
One tequila, two tequila, three tequila, four.

03:22:59.000 --> 03:23:01.000
Alright, let's wrap up.

03:23:02.000 --> 03:23:03.000
Thank you for being here tonight. I hope you had a good time.

03:23:04.000 --> 03:23:05.000
I had a great time.

03:23:06.000 --> 03:23:07.000
And you drank a little bit so we'll make sure.

03:23:08.000 --> 03:23:09.000
I only had like six shots.

03:23:10.000 --> 03:23:11.000
Only six.

03:23:12.000 --> 03:23:14.000
Well then again I only had two and it lasted for what, five minutes?

03:23:15.000 --> 03:23:16.000
It lasted for a five minute giggle fit.

03:23:17.000 --> 03:23:18.000
And after five minutes I was like let's go.

03:23:19.000 --> 03:23:22.000
But thank you for being here and we hope to see you for the 12th next year.

03:23:23.000 --> 03:23:24.000
Sure.

03:23:25.000 --> 03:23:26.000
Alright.

03:23:27.000 --> 03:23:31.000
Loki, I know we kept you a little late but thanks as always. Do you have a final thought?

03:23:32.000 --> 03:23:35.000
Uh, Captain Rainbow for Smash Brothers?

03:23:36.000 --> 03:23:37.000
What?

03:23:38.000 --> 03:23:39.000
Tingle for Smash Brothers.

03:23:40.000 --> 03:23:41.000
Fuck that.

03:23:42.000 --> 03:23:43.000
Yes, yes, Tingle for Smash Brothers.

03:23:44.000 --> 03:23:45.000
I didn't give you your actual final thought JVMon, please.

03:23:46.000 --> 03:23:47.000
Um, I'm drunk.

03:23:48.000 --> 03:23:49.000
Woohoo!

03:23:50.000 --> 03:23:52.000
He will not be leaving this house for a while until he sobers up people.

03:23:53.000 --> 03:23:54.000
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?

03:23:55.000 --> 03:24:00.000
I just got reminded that I really want to play Remember Me.

03:24:00.000 --> 03:24:03.000
Oh my god, so did I. I didn't even realize that game came out.

03:24:04.000 --> 03:24:06.000
I fucking want that game on Steam so much.

03:24:07.000 --> 03:24:08.000
I'm gonna get it on PS3.

03:24:09.000 --> 03:24:12.000
Um, my final thought is I'm just gonna end as well with a thank you.

03:24:13.000 --> 03:24:15.000
Thank you all to your support over the last 11 years.

03:24:16.000 --> 03:24:21.000
Thank you to the genius here in studio that apparently fixed the broadcasting problems.

03:24:22.000 --> 03:24:23.000
Hopefully that won't be a problem in the future.

03:24:24.000 --> 03:24:26.000
We'll do that every week because we held the connection for two hours ever since we reconnected.

03:24:27.000 --> 03:24:28.000
So that'll answer that.

03:24:28.000 --> 03:24:31.000
But I really do want to thank all the listeners for their support over the years.

03:24:32.000 --> 03:24:34.000
And as I say every week, Orange Lounge Radio is a free program.

03:24:35.000 --> 03:24:40.000
And if you enjoy what you hear, just tell a friend or two or seven about the program and help grow our family.

03:24:41.000 --> 03:24:44.000
And when you're done with us, tune into Mario Marathon. Last game.

03:24:45.000 --> 03:24:46.000
We've been watching them all weekend.

03:24:47.000 --> 03:24:48.000
Ah, yeah, Mario Marathon's raising money for a good cause.

03:24:49.000 --> 03:24:51.000
Those guys really aren't very good at Mario games.

03:24:52.000 --> 03:24:59.000
I do want to say in general though, when you're done with Orange Lounge Radio as a podcast and you're ready to go listen to something else this week,

03:25:00.000 --> 03:25:01.000
please consider supporting other independent broadcasters.

03:25:02.000 --> 03:25:07.000
There's a lot of people out there who've worked, maybe not for 11 years, but even one year is something to celebrate,

03:25:08.000 --> 03:25:09.000
who work hard at what they do for free.

03:25:10.000 --> 03:25:12.000
So please continue to support the indie voice.

03:25:13.000 --> 03:25:14.000
It would mean a lot to us.

03:25:15.000 --> 03:25:17.000
Meanwhile, we'll be back to do this all again next week.

03:25:18.000 --> 03:25:19.000
Good night.

03:25:19.000 --> 03:25:21.000
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

03:25:22.000 --> 03:25:26.000
