Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, June 16th, 2013, we discuss the highlights and lowlights of E3 with our listeners.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
One company sues another over Duke Nukem Forever.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And could a free-to-play game from Nintendo be in the works?

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 508 for this June 16th, 2013.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
My name is Rob Roberts, here with you every week with my co-hosts.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Say hello first off to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Thank you for the coffee, it's delicious.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You're welcome. You caffeinated and ready to go?

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Oh yes.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This week's show tonight, also say hello to Tech Master Loki.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Hi.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Sorry to hear about the Minecraft server.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Eh.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We'll get into that later.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It was a huge week this week and we're not going to fuck around, we're just going to get right into it tonight.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So, honestly, probably one of those huge historical moments in gaming this week.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Let's relive this moment real quick.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:31,000
In addition to creating an amazing library of new titles on PlayStation 4, we're equally focused on delivering what gamers want most without imposing restrictions or devaluing their PS4 purchases.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
For instance, PlayStation 4 won't impose any new restrictions on the use of PS4 gamers.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Let's see how long that applause goes on.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yep.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That's not just the fanboys in the upper ring, that's the journalists too, who can't contain themselves.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Guess that's a good thing.

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Oh, and...

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We believe in the model that people embrace today with PlayStation 3 and continue to demand.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Just heard you there.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
When a gamer buys a PS4 disc, they have the rights to use that copy of the game.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
They can trade in the game at retail, sell it to another person, lend it to a friend, or keep it forever.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Bullet.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Bullet.

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Bullet.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Bullet.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That was...

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Wow.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Some guy standing and cheering in there.

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Sit down, fanboy.

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Well, and don't forget over at the Microsoft area where they're watching, this enormous sound of...

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Which was a million pants moving.

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
In addition, PlayStation 4 disc-based games don't need to be connected online to play.

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Or for any type of authentication.

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
If you enjoy playing single-player games offline, PS4 won't require you to check in online periodically.

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And it won't stop working if you haven't authenticated within 24 hours.

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Sick burn.

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Bam.

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
In the jugular.

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That was huge because that was a direct target response to Microsoft right there.

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:46,000
In the 11 years I've been looking at the modern E3, when I say modern E3, I mean like when we've been able to watch the streaming things and all this.

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And the show is turning 11 next week.

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And all the years I've been watching E3 that closely, I have never seen anything like that.

54
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Where one company systematically takes down the policies of another.

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Like, not since the...

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I mean, I remember back in the Sega Nintendo days, things would get ugly.

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You know, Genesis does, Nintendo don't.

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And even the turbo graphics, you know.

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Blast processing.

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Does all this stuff.

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I mean, like, you know, they used to be at each other's throats a lot more.

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Not saying that in the modern era it's been civil, but everybody kind of stays off each other's toes.

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
This...

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
This was huge.

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And then...

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And then they're like, oh hey, you like this cake right here?

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Well then I got some icing for you too.

68
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
That's right, we're only gonna be $3.99.

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Dear Microsoft, these are your cornflakes. Watch as we piss in them.

70
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So, like many of you out there, Dark Soccer and I were watching this together.

71
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And honestly, during this part of the press conference, my jaw's on the floor because I did not expect...

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Well, like many of you, and we even said it on the show last week, we expected Sony to go down a similar path.

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Never in my life have I been happier to be wrong.

74
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I think I go on record saying that I didn't think that...

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Don't make me dig up the archive of last week's show.

76
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I said I wasn't sure, but I didn't think they would.

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Well, it is what it is.

78
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
They didn't go down that same path, and many would say they won E3 because of it.

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And never mind the negatives in Sony's press conference.

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm not trying to sound like a fanboy here.

81
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I will get to some of the positives of Microsoft's in a minute here, because yes, I do believe there are some positives.

82
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But as far as the Sony things go, never mind the whole...

83
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
By the way, PlayStation Plus, yeah, is the only way you're going to be able to play online multiplayer now.

84
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I mean, it's glossed right by that. Nobody cares because they squashed the other thing.

85
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Never mind barely a wink and a nod to the PlayStation Vita.

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's the place for indie developers to be at.

87
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
But no price cut to announce, nothing really else to announce this time.

88
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Never mind that whole thing.

89
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You know, Sony addressed the things that the people on the internet really wanted to hear the most about, and got everybody talking because of it.

90
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And actually what's kind of funny is I think, if I remember correctly, in between the whole talking about their policies and stuff like that, and the price point, wasn't there like,

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Oh, by the way, here's Final Fantasy XV. Oh, and Kingdom Hearts III. You know, that type of thing.

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yeah, and going to our chat room, I always have to acknowledge the live folks.

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:16,000
We do tape live every Sunday night, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice Geeks Network, voggenetwork.com.

94
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
We have our live chatters, Shadownextgen in chat saying,

95
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Sony did a masterful job of misleading people in that conference. I give Sony PR a huge amount of credit.

96
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yeah, things like Kingdom Hearts III, Final Fantasy XV, again, Jaws on the floor.

97
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Those weren't exclusive games. We all know that now.

98
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And they never said they were exclusive games, but now we associate that with PlayStation 4, because those guys were on stage at the Sony press conference.

99
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And there's many, I think there are many people that are like, where they were meant to be played.

100
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Well, and in PlayStation Plus too is, you know, Rocio was saying $5 a month. It's actually cheaper than that, because it's $40, or $50 a year.

101
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So, it's even cheaper than Xbox Live Gold.

102
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Which, what would $50 get you on Gold?

103
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's about the same. It's close. It's about the same.

104
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
How much is Gold per month? I thought it was more than that.

105
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
To be fair, Microsoft tried to raise the bar at their own press conference by saying, we're going to start giving away games with an Xbox Gold subscription.

106
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Fable 3 is already up, and then they announced, what, Halo 3 and Assassin's Creed 2, which I know a lot of you guys are like, snore, I already own those games.

107
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Here's the thing, though, and it's only up until the Xbox One launches, though, not afterwards. So, it's kind of lame.

108
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I mean, it's cool if you're buying a 360 for, like, Grand Theft Auto 5 or something like that, and you get your one month free of Gold, and you can go download all these extra games. I mean, that's kind of cool.

109
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Here's the thing, too, is that what a way Sony has come from 2006, when they were the laughing stock of E3, right? Remember, $599 US dollars? Attack the crab's weak point for massive damage.

110
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
They did make a joke about that.

111
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Oh, yeah, then the guy had that joke about that. And then, what does Sony do in their press conference? Attack Microsoft's weak points for massive damage. Literally. That's what happened.

112
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Yeah, I mean, I seriously thought when they announced that the price point was $499, you know, when Microsoft did that, it was kind of like, oh, here's Sony's press conference all over again, you know?

113
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And the biggest thing that really, in my opinion, even bigger than the press conference, sticking it to Microsoft, was that YouTube that instantly showed up, floating around with the two guys, what, Yoshida and the other guy from PlayStation, doing the tutorial on how to share used games.

114
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I don't see shade like that thrown outside of an episode of RuPaul's Drag Race. That was some massive shade on Sony's part. Bravo.

115
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Well, and then, of course, you know, it immediately was turned into a series of animated gifs for the internet.

116
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Oh, I'm sorry, just Tumblr has been hilarious all week, all because of seeing everything being repeated.

117
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Let's go back to Microsoft for a minute. Can anyone here at the table think about some positive, before we get into where did Microsoft screw up, let's get into some positives from Microsoft's press conference. What do you think are some positives out of this whole thing?

118
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:27,000
They had some good games to show off. There are some exclusive games that look kind of cool, like, was it Sunset Overdrive looked pretty awesome. I mean, that looks like a pretty, it's basically, hey, this is the game right here that was supposed to be Fuse, but, you know, Fuse ended up being some generic third-person shooter.

119
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Now, this is the game that, you know, I guess, not Fuse, it was Overstrike, I think what it was. So, it was supposed to be Overstrike, but now it's this game, and it looks pretty sweet.

120
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's like this very stylized, it reminded me a lot of that Unreal 4 demo, or I guess it's not demo, the actual game, Unreal 4 game, Fortnite, kind of reminded me of that, you know, versus, like, zombies and stuff, but very, you know, stylized.

121
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So, that looked cool. Dead Rising 3, I guess, looks alright. I'm not a huge fan of the shift in tone in the game to more serious. It's kind of, eh.

122
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I guess Mirror's Edge, but that wasn't necessarily at their conference, that was more of EA's, but Mirror's Edge, you know, looks awesome.

123
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And then, not really actually even part of their conference at all, but more clarification on their policy stuff, that 10 friend-sharing thing, where you can have different circles of friends, and basically, you know, I buy a copy of, like, 4 is a 5 or something like that,

124
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:46,000
and I can play the game at the same time as one of my friends can play the game off of my library that I'm sharing. So, that's kind of cool, in that you can share a bunch of games, but at the same time, it's like,

125
00:10:47,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I thought the whole reason that you're having this stuff where you can't, you know, sell used, you know, easily, is to prevent used sales, but the same, you're basically encouraging people not to buy games, because you can just play, you know, if you have a thousand friends, each one has a library shared with you,

126
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:20,000
you know, say you have 10 friends, and they have, you know, we're all sharing library of games, you know, or you have 10 different rings or circles or whatever, friends, you could basically be playing, like, all these games without having to buy them, you know, I don't know, it's kind of a weird strategy.

127
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm gonna say something nice about Microsoft that I actually might get a little bit of shit for, because I'm sure not everybody will agree with me, but I actually thought overall their exclusives looked better than the PlayStation 4 exclusives,

128
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:42,000
yet I walked out of there still pre-ordering a PlayStation 4, because I think the third-party stuff that is on both systems, combined with everything we already got into last week about what I don't like about Microsoft's DRM.

129
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
But what was exclusive, though, that they were showing off?

130
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:59,000
On Microsoft, Killer Instinct, which I realize is getting its own bit, but I'm interested enough. Quantum Break looked great. The game that you just checked, the Sunset Overdrive looks really good.

131
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Halo 5, I know not everybody's into first-person shooters, but I do like Halo games, so I'm here for Halo.

132
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And there was one other one that's escaping me right now. Oh, the Crimson Dragon, the Panzer Dragoon sequel that they basically...

133
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Quiet Dragon.

134
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:22,000
The one that they went back and just basically redid for Xbox One that they had announced at a previous press conference. I mean, there was a lot of good exclusives, whereas I look at Sony and I go,

135
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm not really into Infamous, and they all look okay. I'll play them, but I'm not as excited as I was for maybe the Xbox One exclusives.

136
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:42,000
But what's really selling me is A, the fact that I will own my games on Sony and that whole takedown, and B, the third-party stuff is what I'm really here for,

137
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
the Kingdom Hearts and a lot of this other stuff that is going to end up being on both consoles.

138
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Final Fantasy XIV, I'll probably end up picking up on PlayStation 4 and so on and so on.

139
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So, let's talk about... Well, actually, I want to say two. I don't think the $4.99 price is as bad as everyone's making it out to be.

140
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Granted, Sony stuck it to them with the $3.99 price. I think they had a huge advantage by going second, that they probably had three or four PowerPoint slides ready to go with whatever would undercut Microsoft.

141
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And that's what they pulled out of their hat.

142
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I think also that the really big negative is that whole thing with it listening, especially with the whole NSA scandal going out right about now.

143
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Absolutely. We did touch on that a little bit last week, which still hasn't really been resolved. Loki?

144
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Well, I was going to say the one thing, speaking of having Kinect 2.0 or whatever bundled with the system, they didn't really show me any reason.

145
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,000
In fact, they pretty much didn't show any games that utilized Kinect. I don't know if they had a trailer for Fantasia during their conference,

146
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:00,000
but even the games that were supposed to be for Kinect originally, Rise, for example, is now a regular controlled game.

147
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,000
That Crimson Dragon game, supposed to be a Kinect game, now it's just uses a regular controller.

148
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It's like all these games now are sidestepping the use of Kinect, yet they're saying,

149
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,000
This is integral. You need to have Kinect in there for what reason? You're not using it in any of these games in a meaningful way.

150
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
That's my problem with it.

151
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Let's talk about where Microsoft fucked up, because there's a couple key points that really is just fucking them up.

152
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And it's not even just the DRM thing. I mean, obviously that's one of them.

153
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:38,000
But I think the big thing with that is that Microsoft honestly thinks they're trying to be progressive with this.

154
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
There was a really great interview that came out about this, and the interview was with Phil Spencer,

155
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
who I think kind of knows a little better how to talk to the media and so forth.

156
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
And he talks about this. He says, quote,

157
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You want your library to move with you. You want your friends list to move with you.

158
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
We think the investment in live that we've made over the last eight years has been really important to growing that capability.

159
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
And when you think your gaming library, associated with your identity, is an incredibly important thing,

160
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
we're going through that transition right now, and gamers will come along.

161
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Any other device that you own, your library is digital.

162
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Frankly, if you're on the PC or a Steam customer or an App Store customer on iOS devices,

163
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
this is how you think about your library of content.

164
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
That's mistake number one Microsoft made.

165
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,000
They believe their competition with this device is Apple, which is fair.

166
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Apple's a huge dominating thing. Everybody wants a piece of that. Somebody wants to take them down.

167
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
But while Microsoft had their eyes on Apple, and we're going to copy all these things people do,

168
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
because people eat this Apple shit up.

169
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,000
While Microsoft had their eyes fixated on that, they failed to recognize what was coming up right behind them.

170
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Why did they fail to recognize what was coming up right behind them?

171
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Because my digital library of Xbox Live Arcade games is unable to move with me to the next system.

172
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It's stuck behind. Same with my current library of games. I can't move with the new system.

173
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Whereas on the PlayStation 4, once the Gaikai service launches, I will be able to move with my digital purchases.

174
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Or at least some of them, and it will probably slowly roll out.

175
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Here's the other problem, and I believe this to be a way bigger deal than some of you may think,

176
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
but I think Microsoft made a huge mistake getting rid of all their community outreach people,

177
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
which they did some time ago.

178
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Remember when they got rid of all the people that were doing the Xbox TV thing,

179
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
and they got rid of the Gamerscore blog, and they got rid of a lot of their community outreach people?

180
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Oops. Microsoft forgot how to talk to the community.

181
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Hence the embarrassment that's now on par with Sony's 2006 press conference,

182
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
when they forgot how to talk to the community.

183
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Luckily, Sony's got their mojo back. Maybe Microsoft will get it back in a couple years.

184
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
But they screwed up with that. They don't know how to talk.

185
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Again, this is all boardroom decisions. This is what gamers want.

186
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Gamers want iOS functionality in their console.

187
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Hey, you have shitty internet?

188
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
iOS games are also 99 cents. Sorry, Loki.

189
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
And if you have shitty internet, you buy a 360.

190
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
That's our option for you, because the Xbox One needs to be connected.

191
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Or if you're in another country.

192
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Yes, or another country. Here's the other great thing about that, too.

193
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
He was like, well, you have to understand, you know, you're not going to buy a cell phone if you don't have cell service.

194
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:28,000
The problem is, your device, it's not a device that, like, I don't buy internet so that my game console works.

195
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You know, a phone, you buy to access the phone network.

196
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
This is a, you know, internet's used for your PC, for TV stuff, for your phone, for whatever.

197
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's a multi, I mean, it's like saying, well, you don't, you know, it's like plugging into the wall and getting power for stuff.

198
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
It's not just for one thing.

199
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:55,000
So, saying that, oh, well, you know, perhaps if you have terrible internet, then you guess you don't need this new console.

200
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I just think it's kind of dumb to limit themselves like that.

201
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And many other ways that they're limiting themselves.

202
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Also, he comes out and sounds like a complete, or I forget who it was, Phil Spencer, I think, comes out and sounds like a complete jackass.

203
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
You know, when he's like, I don't even know.

204
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:16,000
You know, he was talking about like, you know, oh, you know, someone was telling me that their friend works on a, you know, nuclear sub and stuff.

205
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I don't even know what that means.

206
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Actually, I was going to bring that up next.

207
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
That was a huge faux pas on Microsoft's part.

208
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
That was Don Mattrick actually that said that.

209
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Don Mattrick, my man.

210
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:32,000
And I predict he will be replaced within 365 days because somebody's going to take the fall for this crap and it's going to be him.

211
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
He will be replaced within 365 days because somebody's going to take the fall for this and it's going to be him.

212
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And I'm sorry, Xbox fanboys.

213
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I know there's many of you saying, oh, it could still win.

214
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
They could still win the holiday season.

215
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I honestly don't think so.

216
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
They've already lost the holidays.

217
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It's too late to reverse course.

218
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Corporations don't know how to talk off script.

219
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It's going to take a miracle for Microsoft to pull out the holiday at this point.

220
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Xbox fans, your biggest sticking point right now, honestly.

221
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:06,000
A, ask a Nintendo fan how to deal with six months of bullshit coming from the internet because, you know, you can take comfort with them.

222
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
But we'll get to Nintendo in a minute.

223
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:17,000
And B, stick to the exclusives because that's the big thing that Microsoft has going for it right now is that you won't be able to play a lot of that stuff.

224
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Halo 5 is huge and you won't be able to play it anymore.

225
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Well, on top of that, too, like, you know, these retailers or whatever.

226
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Now that Sony is not following suit with the Xbox One, guess where they're pushing the customers that are preordering stuff.

227
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Where their bigger margins are.

228
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
PlayStation 4.

229
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
So you have that working against them as well.

230
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Unless, you know, they change their mind.

231
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
But I think even a lot of people are like saying, hey, you know what?

232
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Even if they change their mind and, you know, you know, reverse their decision on this stuff, I'm still not going to support them because they took this stance in the first place.

233
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
And what kind of bullshit are they trying to put us through?

234
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Shadow Next Gen in chat says the Internet is a vocal minority.

235
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
They don't matter in the grand scheme of things.

236
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Okay, let's talk about my coworkers who have already decided they won't be buying an Xbox One.

237
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Or the random employee at Disneyland that saw we were coming from E3 that was talking to my friend and I about stuff and how he's been an Xbox fanboy all this time and does not plan to get an Xbox One.

238
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,000
The Internet may be a vocal minority, but the little ripple starts here and the tidal wave can crash.

239
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Or relatives of mine who all they do is play Farmville, but they saw enough.

240
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
The Internet is really not the minority you like to think it is.

241
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You may have more vocal people in the minority, but the majority of people who are in the consumer market are going to have access to the Internet and see this information.

242
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
End of story.

243
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And here's something that came from one of those stupid courses.

244
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I'm sorry, I hate to say this, Rob, because I know this is what you do.

245
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
But you know those little team building courses that you do at work?

246
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
One of them was called being an advocate.

247
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:04,000
And for every one person that complains, there are eight other people who do not.

248
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Who still have that same opinion, who will be swayed by the one that complains.

249
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And then RossDielUT in our chat room even points out, and I was going to bring this up, but this shit even got on Rachel Maddow's blog, who was bashing the fact that...

250
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I love her.

251
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Well, despite however you feel about her with politics and everything, the fact that she is working for MSNBC, her show is on MSNBC, and she's basically bashing what was said about the whole fact that you won't be able to play it on a nuclear submarine.

252
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
And the whole fact that basically the Xbox is giving the finger to the military and all this stuff.

253
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I mean, that was a huge faux pas.

254
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
And don't forget about the other jokes.

255
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Yeah.

256
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Alright.

257
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:54,000
One other thing I want to bring up that is a key failure on Microsoft's part, and if Microsoft can pull out the holiday, this is the only way they're going to be able to do it.

258
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
And that is the fact that the Xbox One is married to Kinect.

259
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:09,000
And it says a lot when not a single game at that press conference, not one of them, used Kinect.

260
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I know there were some on the show floor with Just Dance 2014 and the Fantasia game.

261
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
And some of the games that they did show did support it, but it wasn't shown.

262
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Exactly.

263
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,000
So what's the big fucking deal about Kinect, and why is there going to be one force included with every single system?

264
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Because I'll bet you the way that PlayStation got the price of their console down to $399 is A, they're going to shaft you on memory storage, B...

265
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
500 gigabytes on the hard drive.

266
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
On the $399 version?

267
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Yep.

268
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
There is only one version.

269
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It's $399.

270
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Really?

271
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
They're not going to try to put out a $499?

272
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Nope.

273
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Wow.

274
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Okay, color me surprised.

275
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
But they definitely are not including the PlayStation Eye and stuff.

276
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,000
And on top of that, it is upgradeable, just like the PlayStation 3.

277
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
But the Eye and all that stuff, nowhere to be seen.

278
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Eye is $60.

279
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Separate.

280
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Yeah.

281
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Even so, that's not enough to bump it up a whole hundred bucks.

282
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Yeah.

283
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:09,000
So I think the only way that Microsoft is going to be able, especially with all this negative perception Kinect has right now in the backlash,

284
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I really think the only way Microsoft is going to be able to pull the holidays out is to drop the price of the console a hundred bucks, detach itself from Kinect.

285
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And now we can have a debate about are the exclusives worth the DRM restrictions and yada, yada, yada.

286
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I still don't know that that's going to be enough.

287
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
For me, it still won't be, honestly.

288
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
But you never know.

289
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I mean, I think the internet is speaking loud and clear.

290
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
The gamer fan base is upset.

291
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I don't think a corporation like Microsoft can move fast enough, but we'll see.

292
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Well, and on top of that, just in the general way they've disrespected their user base,

293
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I wouldn't give them my money until I could buy one second hand that would assure that they wouldn't get that money.

294
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
And on top of that, a lot of the stuff that they were-

295
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Might be a bit much.

296
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Well, you know what? No, I do that stuff. You know me.

297
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:03,000
There were some games that they showed that were Xbox exclusive, and I'm not just talking about Xbox One,

298
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
both Xbox One and Xbox 360.

299
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Like, for example, the new Plants vs. Zombies game, which looks pretty sweet.

300
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Whatever. You know what? I don't care. It looks fantastic.

301
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
And so that'll be one I want to pick up on Xbox 360 when it comes out later on.

302
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
And Titanfall was another one that was, I think, Xbox One, Xbox 360 exclusive.

303
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Hell, I have a 360. I'm going to be gaming on it for a long time, credit without a five.

304
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:35,000
So I'm not worried about all these games coming out that, you know, may be only on the Xbox platforms,

305
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
because I have an Xbox platform. I'm just, you know-

306
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I just- I'm not going to buy two next-gen consoles.

307
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:48,000
And not necessarily because I just don't like- I mean, I don't really like the policies that they have with Xbox One,

308
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
but I can't afford two consoles right now like that.

309
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And I did- I bought all three this generation, and I play one of the three, so I'm not going to throw away my money like that.

310
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Just buy one, and then when they drop their price and release a Grand Theft Auto 6 or something like that,

311
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
that's exclusive to Xbox One, which will never happen, but then we can talk about it.

312
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
BloodJunk makes a good point that Titanfall is also on PC.

313
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Yeah, but my laptop can't run that.

314
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
But my computer can.

315
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Before we get into our gaming weeks and covering the rest of the news tonight,

316
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
and ultimately getting to your calls at 1877 Game OLR and your further chat comments and so forth,

317
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I don't- we've been very focused on Microsoft versus Sony, as a lot of people have.

318
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I don't want to ignore Nintendo, because obviously, you know, that's a console too,

319
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
and they had their own set of expectations going into E3.

320
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
How did we all feel about Nintendo?

321
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I'll start with Nintendo's biggest critic in the room. Loki, how did you feel about what Nintendo-

322
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
There was nothing surprising from them.

323
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Honestly, because all the stuff that we knew was coming, they basically announced.

324
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
There wasn't anything like, oh, hey, I didn't see that.

325
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Okay, the only game I didn't know that was coming was a new Donkey Kong game,

326
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
and I was like, poof, who cares?

327
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
You know, we just had a Donkey Kong game come out.

328
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I don't really care. This looks exactly like the other one, except, oh, now we go and it's 3D,

329
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
and it goes into the background, and then who gives a shit?

330
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Mario Kart 8 looks nice, and, you know, the gimmick of, you know, the gravity thing looks cool,

331
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
and there's going to be some interesting tracks, but it doesn't look like it plays that different,

332
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
so I'm not too excited about that, and usually Mario Kart sells me systems.

333
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I mean, I bought all the other Nintendo systems from Mario Kart,

334
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
but I just don't really care anymore about it.

335
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Smash Brothers looked kind of cool, and some of the new characters that they're announcing are kind of,

336
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
it's neat, I like how they're going with that.

337
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Bayonetta 2 just kind of, it was all right, but when's that coming out? No idea.

338
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Well, 2014, but that could be Christmas 2014.

339
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Originally, it was supposed to be 2013, so I don't know.

340
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Zelda Wind Waker HD just doesn't look like they've really done a lot to it.

341
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
They didn't really add anything to it, other than, you know, now you can travel the seas faster.

342
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Well, and that Accel Shaded game looks a lot better on HD, but, you know.

343
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I'm still disappointed, though, that a system that plays Wii games isn't able to up-res those things.

344
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Yeah, here's the thing about Nintendo for me.

345
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
You know, I'm a Wii U owner, and originally when I walked away from the Nintendo Direct,

346
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:16,000
which was a mess in itself to watch, and I hope to hell Nintendo just streams with another partner next year,

347
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
because the Ustream thing was embarrassing, how horrible that was to watch.

348
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
But anyway, all that aside, when you really kind of looked at the news itself,

349
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
a lot of it was just kind of par.

350
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
You know, I'm not like, I wasn't like, woo, Nintendo, like super excited.

351
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I mean, certainly the couple games that I was excited about, I'm really excited about.

352
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Mario Kart 8 looks killer. The new Mario 3D World, which, I don't get the 3D, not on a 3DS.

353
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
But whatever, okay, whatever.

354
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
And Cats.

355
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I forgive it, because it's got the floating princess and Luigi legs again, whatever. And Cats.

356
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
And X looked good.

357
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Yeah, and so, you know, yeah, that's all stuff that's cool.

358
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
And then I was kind of like, that's a lot of 2014 stuff.

359
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
That's the thing that kind of concerned me about it, is that it's not that the games don't look good,

360
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
because they all do look really good, and, you know, hey, it's Nintendo.

361
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,000
But I was kind of like, man, I kind of wanted Nintendo to really have a come-from-behind holiday,

362
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
and they're going to really kick some butt this holiday season.

363
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
And I'm kind of like, maybe they'll kick butt in 2014,

364
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
because they didn't announce a price drop or anything to really move those consoles this season.

365
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
They have the same fucking lineup they had, well, two years ago with the 3DS.

366
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
A new Mario 3D Land and Mario Kart.

367
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
It's seriously, they're just repeating the steps.

368
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
So what, are we going to get a price drop? Same strategy as the 3DS.

369
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
But those games are enough to make me want to go out and buy a Wii U, assuming I had the funds for it.

370
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Wait a second, that's actually exactly their strategy, because there's also another new Mario,

371
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
or, I'm sorry, new Luigi U game in August.

372
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Smash Brothers.

373
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Yeah, but Smash Brothers is not until 2014.

374
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Yeah, but I don't care, that makes me want a Wii U.

375
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:51,000
It's literally the exact same lineup as, like, 2011 for the 3DS on the Wii U.

376
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
It's, like, exactly.

377
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
And this is my I don't care face, I want one.

378
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I didn't get to finish my thought completely, and now people in chat are like, Rob, you're wrong.

379
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,000
The thing is, is that even if Nintendo chooses not to drop the price of their console,

380
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
which I don't think is the smartest decision, but okay, if they don't do it,

381
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
there's still the cheapest option out there at the holiday season.

382
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:17,000
And I think there are a lot of families that aren't informed on this whole Microsoft versus Sony thing,

383
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
and are simply going to go for the cheapest option that the thing is for their kids.

384
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Because, you know, yes, the Mario games are going to speak to certain people and so forth.

385
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:32,000
But, this is where I'm torn, because that argument should have worked last year.

386
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
See, that's my problem.

387
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
We had a Mario game last year, and the console still didn't sell.

388
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Okay, so we have a couple more this year, but we don't have anything else to really push it.

389
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:49,000
So you're just telling me that more of the same is going to move more consoles.

390
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I'm not, I mean, I'm skeptical.

391
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
And I'm not rooting against Nintendo.

392
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I really hate that all these publishers are abandoning Nintendo.

393
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I think they're being dicks about it.

394
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
But, I want to see Nintendo do better, but I just kind of, I feel like,

395
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I didn't really get it from them how they're going to light a fire under the Wii U.

396
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
That's what was frustrating for me.

397
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Let's see, going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

398
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
FrosteelUT says, Rob, Nintendo had a good holiday season.

399
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
The problem is that after holiday it was dead.

400
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Well, I mean, that's a problem.

401
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
And I would argue it didn't have a holiday season like Wii's or Xbox 360's when it launched.

402
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
It had a pretty decent launch, but the thing was that,

403
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
yeah, there were no games for like three months after it came out,

404
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
and a lot of them were ports of older games.

405
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
And we could very well see that kind of line up,

406
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
although they're going to have Wii Fit U, big deal.

407
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:55,000
And I don't even know what they're going to have for the first quarter of 2014.

408
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
So, yeah, there is a lot of stuff that, who knows where this is,

409
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
they're going to be coming out.

410
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Koopakit Jeremy in chat says, third party games would sell more

411
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
if they took the time to make the games comparable to PlayStation 3 and 360.

412
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Injustice is a good example. No DLC for Wii U owners.

413
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Actually, Mass Effect 3 was the same way.

414
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Yeah, something's up there.

415
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Like, is something fucked up with Nintendo Network

416
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
where DLC isn't as easy to do or something,

417
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
because why do we keep seeing these subpar games that, you know,

418
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,000
they launch and it's eh, and then they're like piss poorly supported after launch?

419
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Mass Effect 3 is a great example. It's not a better experience on Wii U.

420
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
It had nothing to carry over on top of that.

421
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
All the things that made playing 3 actually kind of mildly worthwhile

422
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
was carrying over your previous game data,

423
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
and it didn't even have a good version to do that.

424
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Anyway, I want to move on to the other stories and so forth,

425
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
but I do want to say, like, on a positive note for Nintendo,

426
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I think one other thing to keep in mind when I'm talking about that,

427
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
you know, I'm not seeing enough or whatever.

428
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
One thing that should be noted is that one thing Nintendo has been doing right

429
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
is that they're doing more of those Nintendo directs,

430
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
and they did already put out some surprises that would usually be an E3 thing, right?

431
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
The Zelda 3D on 3DS and so forth.

432
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
3DS fucking rules right now. Like, as far as handhelds go,

433
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I mean, PlayStation is phoning in the Vita, 3DS is Amazeballs,

434
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Animal Crossing, Zelda, Smash Brothers.

435
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I mean, 3DS is fucking where it's at for handhelds right now if you're, like, a gamer.

436
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Like, that's one thing Nintendo ain't doing wrong.

437
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
It just took them a long time to get there.

438
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
But, you know, a lot of that stuff kind of came out before,

439
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
so I'm hoping that maybe there's another Nintendo Direct in a month

440
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
that has some other stuff to get us excited.

441
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I know there's some news coming up later that maybe Nintendo hasn't played all their cards right now,

442
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
so that will be interesting to see play out.

443
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:54,000
All right. Any other thoughts on the big three before we get into our gaming weeks quickly and gaming news and all that?

444
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Ubisoft. Like always, Ubisoft had a lot of cool stuff to show at their press conference,

445
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,000
and I always kind of think that, you know, being able to take E3 each year,

446
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
they showed off, what was it, The Crew, which looked pretty awesome,

447
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
like an open world burnout type game, which is pretty sweet,

448
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
and then they also had the new Tom Clancy game, Division,

449
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
or The Division, that looked pretty cool as well,

450
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
like that MMO that ties in with, like, the iPad and stuff.

451
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
So I thought that was really cool and want to check that out.

452
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Those games actually kind of seem like, okay, here's how we're going to use Next Gen.

453
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:41,000
They kind of showed that versus Rise, which is like, cool, you made a knockoff of God of War. Awesome.

454
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Before we get into gaming weeks, let me ask this question with my big slash troll face,

455
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,000
because this is definitely the question that cynical gamers everywhere are asking.

456
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I can't make a troll face. I tried.

457
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:01,000
What do you think will sell more this holiday season, the Xbox One or the Wii U?

458
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,000
What will sell more this holiday season, the Xbox One or the Wii U?

459
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:13,000
If everybody had my brain, it would be the Wii U, but not everybody is an intelligent shopper.

460
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:19,000
So I still pretty much think the Wii U is going to be a better seller.

461
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
It's a tough question to ask or answer, just because not all the data is there,

462
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
because there's also rumors that they're having trouble with chip yields.

463
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
So you may end up with a shortage problem at launch.

464
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,000
So, you know, to be honest, I think that the Xbox One will sell more than the Wii U.

465
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,000
And why is that? Because you think something is, oh, but not PlayStation 4?

466
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
PlayStation 4 will outsell both, all of them.

467
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I think, if anything, you can still have Xbox 360 selling more than the Xbox One,

468
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,000
and probably the Wii U as well, just because, granted, that's out of five.

469
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
No, they have a lot of exclusives for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

470
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
And honestly, I don't see Wii U as next-gen. I'm sorry.

471
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
It's still, graphically and performance-wise, it's on par with PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

472
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:15,000
So it's just like, I don't know, in-between-gen or something, whatever you want to call it.

473
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I'm going to say Wii U sells more this holiday season because of households with children under 12,

474
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
and the parents that will have the fond memories of Nintendo and so forth.

475
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
And I think a lot of the hardcore gamers, I think a lot of them are going Sony.

476
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Sorry, Xbox fans, but what's that?

477
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:39,000
But it doesn't really matter, though, because they don't need to buy a new system, though,

478
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
for these games that they're wanting to play.

479
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Everyone eats up Skylanders, and everybody is probably going to eat up Disney Infinity.

480
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Those are both on Wii.

481
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:55,000
You're going to have, I don't know, it's another Mario game.

482
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I mean, how many Mario games are we going to have come out already?

483
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I don't think it's that amazing that 3D Land is coming out.

484
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
It looks kind of like a slightly better version of the 3DS one,

485
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
and that's not a big, once again, not a big deal for me,

486
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
because that was just like New Super Mario Brothers U.

487
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:21,000
But here's the big reason, the other big reason why I think Wii U is going to go over better than Xbox One,

488
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
and it's like you were saying, but this is apart from brand recognition,

489
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
you also do have a known quantity.

490
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Whereas they are making so many different changes with the X-Bone

491
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:41,000
that I think that a lot of people are going to go towards something that they, as a consumer, can put more trust in.

492
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Well, let's see what the listeners think.

493
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Live.vognetwork.com and answer this live poll right now.

494
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
What will sell more this holiday season?

495
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Your options are Wii U or Xbox One.

496
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Asking the questions of cynical gamers everywhere.

497
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,000
What's going to sell out of the two underdogs going into this holiday?

498
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Dreamcast.

499
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Wii U or Xbox One.

500
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Registered participants can vote on the site at live.vognetwork.com.

501
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:15,000
If you're not a registered participant, you should do so, because it's free and we won't spam you.

502
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Super promise.

503
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Yeah, like I was saying, I don't hate Nintendo first party games,

504
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
but I just don't think any of them are system sellers.

505
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Like for example, if instead of the remake of Wind Waker, they had a brand new next gen Zelda game,

506
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
yeah, that might be something to sell people on the system.

507
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
But a game that's basically an upgrade of a 3DS game,

508
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,000
I don't think that it didn't really work too well for New Super Mario Brothers U,

509
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
and I don't think it's going to work too well for New Luigi U.

510
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:51,000
So why is a third Mario game that's just a platformer that doesn't really seem that different from what's already out there,

511
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I don't think that's going to be a system seller, that's the thing.

512
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Mario Kart or anything? It's Mario Kart.

513
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
No 3DO Ikuma JP.

514
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Alright, we will get to the results of our live poll right after our gaming weeks.

515
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Let's try to keep them a little bit shorter tonight because we had a lot of E3 talk,

516
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
but Dark Soccer, what have you been tapped into this week?

517
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Well, we busted out the Atari 5200 for Atari Party coming up, getting everything working.

518
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
So there was some Panko going on in my house, Rob.

519
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Nice.

520
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Thought you would have liked it.

521
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Loves it.

522
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
And Super Pac-Man.

523
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
We have Millipede because we have some prototype re-releases.

524
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I could not play Mass Effect 3 because I've been in the middle of upgrading all of my graphics in it so that it looks even more gorgeous,

525
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
even if it's not the best story-wise.

526
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I've been playing the first Mass Effect and I played it on the stream on Thursday,

527
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:40,000
and I'm probably going to end up getting it beaten on the stream next Thursday, if I feel like it.

528
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Really? Oh yeah, Final Fantasy XIV.

529
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Because we had a beta weekend, and I have a Thaumaturge.

530
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Oh yeah, we can talk about that now, huh?

531
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Yeah, we can. We just can't say anything about the last beta.

532
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Well, I didn't play in this beta weekend, so I guess I can't really.

533
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I just got my invite for PlayStation 3, so I will have to download it.

534
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I think that, honestly, after as long as I played WoW, it has everything that I liked in Cataclysm,

535
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
because that's what got me playing WoW.

536
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:20,000
And none of the utter grinding crap that's in the panda version.

537
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Panda area. Stupid pandas.

538
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Gummy bears, gummy bears. WoW gummy bear edition.

539
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
So I'm really enjoying it, and I like playing my catgirl.

540
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Or my mikote, or whatever she's called.

541
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
She's a catgirl.

542
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Mythra.

543
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
No.

544
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Although they have the same animations.

545
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
It's so stupid that they change the name.

546
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
They have the same animations.

547
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
They're the same races.

548
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I think Lalafell is probably the cutest name for that race possible.

549
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
And it's kind of funny finding gangster Lalafell in the town I started in.

550
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
They're like, we're badass Lalafell.

551
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
There's this little Lalafell walking around looking all badass wearing a monocle.

552
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
And then these two big hulking guys behind him.

553
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
He's like, look at me, I'm a badass midget.

554
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
It was pretty funny. So yeah.

555
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Loki.

556
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I played literally one session of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 this week.

557
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Because every other time I was just basically reading E3 news, all my coworkers were gone.

558
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
So I didn't get to play with anybody.

559
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
And I was working on 3D modeling in the meantime.

560
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
So yeah, I didn't play anything.

561
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I did buy, though, the Serious Sam collection on Humble Bundle, the weekly sale.

562
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
So I got that.

563
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Fuck, I never got a Humble Bundle 8 and it's done, huh?

564
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Yep.

565
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Shit.

566
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Oh well. That was my bad.

567
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Oh well.

568
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
So, I mean, that was pretty cool.

569
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
You don't just have to buy Humble Bundle 9, maybe they'll throw a name with it.

570
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Yeah, it's true, it's true.

571
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
So, I mean, I haven't ever played any of that series, but it looked cool.

572
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
So I wanted to pick that up and I thought it was a good deal.

573
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
What else?

574
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Bought PlayStation Plus for a year.

575
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Haven't redeemed it yet, though, but I'm looking forward to trying out the free games that are on there and stuff.

576
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Because I have a 500 gig hard drive to fill up with games that I haven't played yet.

577
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:15,000
And a pre-ordered PlayStation 4, because I'm worried that I might not be able to get one if I don't.

578
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
So, I did.

579
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Alright.

580
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Oh, and just to say, for those of us who are playing Final Fantasy XIV and want to join us on a beta weekend,

581
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
we are on the North American Behemoth server.

582
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
There you go.

583
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Do you have a link shell yet?

584
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
We don't have a link shell yet.

585
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
We don't have a link shell yet.

586
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Okay, I will have to remember that.

587
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
And you can only add friends if they're online at the same time, so I couldn't get anybody.

588
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Remind me later to talk to you about Facebook things.

589
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Unless Shane Alinko happens to be listening, then you know what to do.

590
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Alright.

591
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
As far as Loki's concerned.

592
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Which I think I did see him in chat earlier.

593
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Okay, so my gaming week.

594
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:53,000
So, even though Orange Lawn and Tradio, the world's longest weekly internet show about video games,

595
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
is not a recognized media outfit of E3,

596
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I went down to the show anyway just to, well, to get Bobby.

597
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
And I did check out the Ouya booth, because it was open to all.

598
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
It was outside.

599
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
So, what the heck?

600
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
I went to go check out the Ouya.

601
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Because I didn't get a whole lot of hands on time with Ouya when Loki brought it over, right?

602
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
So, I did get to check out a few new games on Ouya.

603
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
One of the games I played was Soul Fjord.

604
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
And funny enough, it's like the first game I walked up to and I'm like,

605
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
alright, so tell me about your game.

606
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
And he's like, well, it's like a rhythm game.

607
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
He goes, it's hard to explain.

608
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
He's like, it's a rhythm game mixed with a roguelike.

609
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I'm like, this sounds like the perfect game right up my alley.

610
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I love dungeon crawlers and I love rhythm games.

611
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Tell me more, sir.

612
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
So, he actually showed me the game.

613
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
And yes, it is a rhythm game mixed with a roguelike.

614
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,000
It's like a dungeon crawler, but you attack to the beat of the music.

615
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
And your little combos, like when you want to do a combo, you hold down the trigger.

616
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
And little beat patterns show over your sword.

617
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
So, you can kind of do the little patterns.

618
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
And if you do it right, you do like an AoE attack.

619
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
So, it was kind of cool.

620
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Yeah, it was cute.

621
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I liked it.

622
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
So, I have my eye on that.

623
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Like, if I'm going to get a new AoE, which I might, depending on finances,

624
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I would definitely pick up Solfjord.

625
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I like that.

626
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
That was fun.

627
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,000
He did say, if I heard the guy correctly, he said, though, it's going to be a difficult game.

628
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
And if you die, you die.

629
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
It's like Dark Souls.

630
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
You go all the way back to start.

631
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
So, you know, that whole thing.

632
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
So, that'll be interesting to see what happens.

633
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Let's see.

634
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I saw another game called The Amazing Frog.

635
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
This game was weird.

636
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
What?

637
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
No, I want to know about this one because I've heard of it.

638
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
It looked weird to me.

639
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,000
And I'm going to admit, it's a game where you can tell the graphics on the Ouya are a little bit behind.

640
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Because the other two games, like Solfjord, looked like any other Xbox Live arcade game to me.

641
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,000
It was, like, cartoony.

642
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
You know, it looked like that to me.

643
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I could tell The Amazing Frog was a little weaker graphically.

644
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
But that's not the developer's fault.

645
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I hear the game has really loud boomboxes in it.

646
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I couldn't figure it out.

647
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Like, it's like this open world frog runner game.

648
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
And all you can do with the controller is you jump and you fling.

649
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:02,000
And it's like this big open playground and you can fling yourself on a trampoline and go flying.

650
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
It is the type of open world shit you would eat right out the monkey.

651
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
No, I've already played it before.

652
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,000
So, it's basically like the insurance fraud mode in Saints Row.

653
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:16,000
You basically run around and you try to hit a bunch of explosives and chain your frog to, you know,

654
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,000
land in the air and knock shit over and you make cars explode and all that fun stuff.

655
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,000
So, I wasn't sure I got the game in there, but as far as, like,

656
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Well, it's still very early.

657
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Yeah, I'm kind of like giving these guys the benefit of the doubt.

658
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
I'm like, alright, it's early. It's just a concept. We'll see. We'll see.

659
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Keep your eye on it. I'm not saying it's bad. I'm just saying.

660
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
It's free right now.

661
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I didn't get it, but maybe I'll get it later.

662
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
The other game I checked out, the third one I checked out, was called Chronoblade.

663
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
And I looked at it because it looked like Diablo from afar.

664
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Because it had, like, the little red and blue potions in the corner.

665
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
You know, I'm like, oh, this is like a Diablo clone.

666
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,000
So, I went to play it and it's apparently a free-to-play game.

667
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
It's not just on Ouya. They have a web browser based thing that's in closed beta right now.

668
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Well, here's the thing. It looks like Diablo from a distance.

669
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
It plays like the Ninja Turtles arcade game.

670
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
That's awesome.

671
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Like, to me, it was like a beat-em-up with, like, the jump and the punch and all that.

672
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,000
And you could do, like, the special moves. And as you beat people up, you gain magic.

673
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,000
So, that's what it felt like to me. And I was like, alright, this is.

674
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
And then the guy was kind enough to give me a closed beta key.

675
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
So, I was like, I think I will be cashing that in. That looks like fun.

676
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
You can get more information on that one at facebook.com slash Chronoblade Online.

677
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
All one word. I imagine they're giving away a lot of those closed beta keys.

678
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Soulfjord.com was the other game. And I didn't get a website or anything for Amazing Frog.

679
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Sorry, but Google it. I'm sure you'll find it.

680
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Well, Soulfjord is the folks behind Quantum Conundrum and that kind of stuff.

681
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
So, they make some pretty awesome games.

682
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:48,000
So, there you go. I mean, other than that, lots of Animal Crossing, but not enough to even, like, pay off my second loan.

683
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Like, I just, there's too much. Street passing. I did a lot of street passing.

684
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I sat in the lobby at E3 while I waited for Bobby Blackwolf because he took his time.

685
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Which I understand. He was trying to get answers to questions and was fishing up a demo. He took his time.

686
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,000
And I just street passed over and over. I literally got, like, 120 puzzle pieces over the weekend.

687
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:12,000
I completed, like, two puzzles and, yeah, I'm only, like, 80 panels away from full completion.

688
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
So, that made me excited. There you go.

689
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Dungeonbuster in chat at live.voggetetwork.com says, Uya didn't pay to be at E3, so they rented out a parking lot nearby and held their events there.

690
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Yeah, and the ESA rented a big truck and parked it right in front of the booth.

691
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
That's kind of a dick move.

692
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
It was kind of a dick move. Like, it wasn't that big a deal, honestly.

693
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:43,000
The Uya thing was like, hey, we've got beer over here and some developer, like, I did not see the Uya being pushed.

694
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I saw developers making games on Uya being pushed. That's what I saw.

695
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
I don't know what the ESA was so afraid of. That was kind of a dick move on their part.

696
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
I did take a picture of the whole thing. Judge for yourself.

697
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:01,000
E3.voggetetwork.com. It's the one booth I got to do. Go look at the Uya booth over there at E3.voggetetwork.com.

698
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,000
And you should look at all the stuff there that Bobby collected. He answered a lot of your questions.

699
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Unfortunately, you know, sometimes there's going to be no comment or we're not going to talk about that.

700
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:21,000
But a couple, there was at least more than a couple, like a handful of things, like Square Enix basically flat out saying how to get Kingdom Hearts on Xbox, if that's what you want, giving the answer that.

701
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:29,000
A definitive price for the Disney Infinity figurines. All figured out thanks to you guys and your questions at E3.voggetetwork.com.

702
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:35,000
And more. I could have told you that, though. Just saying.

703
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:42,000
All right. To the results of the live poll. Here it is. The results of the live poll tonight. What will sell more this holiday season?

704
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:50,000
We use 61.90% Xbox One 38.10. We'll call that 60-40. It's close enough to 60-40 split there.

705
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
So it's not a blowout.

706
00:47:52,000 --> 00:48:00,000
It all depends on like what price drops on the Wii U side or even the Xbox One side. And if they reverse their policy, it's just there's a lot of time.

707
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Yeah, there is. I mean, yeah. And, you know, admittedly, that question was I said at the beginning, this is the troll face skeptic question.

708
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
But I thought it was a fun one to ask. I hope you had fun answering it.

709
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Okay. Housekeeping. Twitter.com slash O.L.R. or Facebook. Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio.

710
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Next week on the program, June 23rd, 2013, our pal J.V. Mohn will be here to help us celebrate 11 years of OrangeLoungeRadio.

711
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:34,000
And this is what's very interesting, too, is that June 23rd is the actual birthday. That doesn't happen every year.

712
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
So every 11 years, you can expect it's a joke.

713
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Well, it's like every five or six years the way the leap years were. Yeah, but but this is one of the few times we actually get to celebrate a birthday on our birthday.

714
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Maybe I will have to convince somebody else to make murder brownies again.

715
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:54,000
That would be fantastic. So we hope you guys will join us. We're not planning anything. I mean, you get to a certain age and you just kind of stop caring.

716
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
No, you can't say that.

717
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
I don't say you stop caring. I shouldn't say that. No, we are.

718
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,000
No, no, no. How about I quote the amazing Wanda Sykes? The older I get, the less of a fuck I give.

719
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Kinda, kinda. But it's just one of those, you know, we don't need to have the whole self-serving, hooray, we're 11 show. We've done that before.

720
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
10 was a big thing. It was, it was.

721
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,000
It's great. Now I'm thinking of Patton Oswalt where he talks about what birthdays you're allowed to celebrate.

722
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Yeah, yeah. It's like you're 11, no one cares. When you're 13, you're a teenager. That one's big.

723
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:30,000
So if you want to get us a cake, we'll eat it. That's that's what we're going to say about next week's show.

724
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Preferably, I like carrot cake. Just saying.

725
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Do we have confirmed our guest for two weeks now? Guest host in two weeks?

726
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
I thought we did.

727
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
I think we do.

728
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Because of another transaction that's occurring around that.

729
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Well, I'm just going to say I am fully expecting that in two weeks, first make slidekick from Game Buoy will be here live.

730
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Then that'll be a lot of fun.

731
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
And if not, we're going to go get him.

732
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
And I'm going to razz the crap out of him on his old show, Fabulous Flames.

733
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
We're going to duct tape him to a buoy.

734
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Good times.

735
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
And bring him along with us.

736
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Good times. All right. Tune in live every Sunday for the antics. Live.vognetwork.com.

737
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,000
I'm hoping we can start lining up some interviews, too, now that E3 is over, because I definitely want to talk to some of these OUYA guys.

738
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:15,000
And you know, whatever else we can get now that people are going to be really in that rush to get people to preorder for the holiday.

739
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Let's run down more news. Maybe some things you missed. Maybe not. Some clarifications. Setting people straight.

740
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Loki, why don't you start us off with the news?

741
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Well, Major Nelson was answering a bunch of questions. I think that he even did, like, a thing on NeoGaf where he was answering questions for people and stuff, posting on there.

742
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:40,000
But there was one of the interviews. They were basically asking, you know, obviously, very obvious questions, you know, with the announcements that, you know, Sony made.

743
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Will this influence Microsoft and make them change what they're doing with the Xbox One?

744
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
And here's what basically he commented on.

745
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,000
I don't think, I mean, we're really not going to change anything we've done with the Xbox One.

746
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:56,000
We're very happy. Did you see the games on stage during the briefing? Did you see the exclusives?

747
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
I mean, we're really proud of the system and the games that are coming out.

748
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:04,000
When you look at it, games like Titanfall, have you gone through the Titanfall yet?

749
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Enough said. Conversation over. We're really happy what they showed on stage and what's showing here in the booth.

750
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,000
So I think it's safe to say that we're confident where we're going.

751
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:18,000
We're also confident that gamers are going to love our vision of the future and what we're going to offer for gaming.

752
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:24,000
So basically, no, they're too stubborn to change their mind so far.

753
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:31,000
But I mean, then again, I mean, he was only being asked that a few days after, you know, the announcement.

754
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:38,000
And sales, I think sales figures, if they're trailing way behind, that could change things.

755
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:45,000
You guys have to understand that corporations and the talking heads for corporations have to stick to talking points at big shows like this.

756
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
And they have investors, remember?

757
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,000
They are all trained on said talking points. They don't deviate from those talking points.

758
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
And when they do it, that's why it's always news when somebody goes off the cusp.

759
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
So, you know, they always stick to their talking points.

760
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
By the way, I was checking to see if Major Nelson had replied to what I told him.

761
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
I think he's got a lot of people telling things right now.

762
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,000
So I thought there was an interesting comment in chat from Ross Steel UT.

763
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Major Nelson, the only community outreach guy left, and he only stayed because he's a good enough yes man.

764
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Does Microsoft need their Kevin Butler right now?

765
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Dude, if they brought Kevin Butler out on stage during that play scene, I think everyone would have about lost it.

766
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,000
You know what I think would have been great for their presentation?

767
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Bring hard gay out of retirement.

768
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Have them just go around humping everybody and going, woo!

769
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
That would have sold Xbox ones right there.

770
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Oh god, alright.

771
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:52,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, cloud.

772
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:57,000
I only mentioned this game briefly, like really briefly, but obviously it's kind of a big deal.

773
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
You know, it's the game a lot of people were talking about before E3 is the big Microsoft announcement.

774
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Killer Instinct.

775
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Killer Instinct was revealed at the Microsoft press briefing, and here's the whole thing.

776
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,000
It came out afterwards that Killer Instinct is going to be free to play.

777
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,000
But they're actually now saying that that might not actually be part of it.

778
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
There's some clarifications coming out.

779
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:28,000
The game has said that the game is going to be free to play, and when it launches on Xbox One, you can get Jago for free, and then you can buy all the other characters.

780
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:34,000
However, what's not being said, the full game will also be available on its release.

781
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:44,000
So if you don't want to do the whole nickel and dime model for only certain characters, then you can drop the, assumably, 60 bucks and get the whole thing unlocked at once.

782
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I actually think this model isn't as terrible as everyone says it is.

783
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Now that we have the clarification, you can still get the game out of the box.

784
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Yeah, it's basically a demo, but it's an upgradeable demo.

785
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,000
You're in a pretty good situation if your favorite character is Jago.

786
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
You know what it reminds me of?

787
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:09,000
It reminds me of the Rock Band game on PSP, where you could download the demo, and you could download songs from the marketplace and play them in the demo.

788
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:14,000
You never had to buy the full game unless you wanted the full game's song list.

789
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,000
I don't know, it kinda reminds me of that, so, interesting.

790
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,000
By the way, Double Helix also has unveiled Glacius as another character in the game.

791
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
He will be playable at EVO 2013.

792
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:29,000
There's also going to be 40 training lessons in the game to teach players about the game.

793
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:41,000
It is a little disappointing that it's Double Helix, the folks behind the latest Silent Hill game, are making this game and not Rare, the company behind Very Awesome Games.

794
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
KoopaKa Jeremy in chat says,

795
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Then why even focus on the free-to-play thing?

796
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
They should have made that clear right away.

797
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Like everything they've been saying, they need to be crystal clear.

798
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Here's a great example of what happens when somebody doesn't stick to talking points.

799
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Because I think somebody made a one-off comment about this to a press site.

800
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,000
And here we go, gaming industry, copy-paste, copy-paste, copy-paste, copy-paste.

801
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
It's free-to-play, free-to-play, free-to-play, free-to-play, based off one guy that went off the page.

802
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:17,000
And that's why you didn't see Microsoft doing a backpedaling or an about-face at E3.

803
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
There is not time to change the script.

804
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Well, that's an even bigger reason why, again, canceling all those Q&As and so forth.

805
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Also being pointed out in chat amongst the folks there that Rare is not making this game.

806
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Which is a little bit surprising.

807
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Somebody else is.

808
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
It's the people that made Silent Hill Homecoming.

809
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Which wasn't a bad game.

810
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:55,000
I mean, okay, I have a special warm, fuzzy place in my heart for Killer Instinct because of the same reason I have a warm, fuzzy place in my heart for World Cup Soccer 94.

811
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:01,000
I mean, I played it, yeah, my first year of college. It was a big thing for me. It's what I spent all my time on.

812
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:08,000
And this new version, while I'm mildly interested in it, it doesn't seem like it's going to be...

813
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:14,000
It was about the only thing that they mentioned that made me perk up at all, and it was only for the nostalgia's sake.

814
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
And I don't think they can really bank on that.

815
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Yeah, it's kind of one of those things where it's like, oh, I'd love to check it out if I was going to get an Xbox One, but I'm not going to right now.

816
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Maybe I'll get an Xbox One in a year, and I think that's what will end up happening.

817
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:33,000
And to be fair, folks, I bought the 360 at launch, well, soon after launch, and I waited a year to get a PlayStation 3.

818
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
This is just that in reverse.

819
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:40,000
On the topic of that, you know, they redesigned the 360 to look like the Xbox One, and I think it's fucking ugly.

820
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,000
That console looks not good anymore.

821
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:48,000
I think we've, and I've talked about this before, I think we focus way too much on the looks of consoles.

822
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
It's not that big a deal.

823
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Like, a lot of people were talking about the PlayStation 4 in its weird shape, and I'm just like, alright, so it's oddly shaped.

824
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
But here's the thing, though.

825
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I like that it's vertical or horizontal again, and you can put it wherever you want. That's cool.

826
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Yeah, here's the thing, though, is why would you redesign your current gen console to make it look like the Xbox One?

827
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:12,000
That's going to be confusing now, because people are going to say, hey, I saw that console on TV.

828
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Which console is it? It's one of the Xboxes.

829
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Oh, it's this one, and they get a 360, you know, because...

830
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
You don't think the name is right there on the front?

831
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:31,000
No, they're going to see the 360 with the new branding say, oh, that looks fun, and whoever's going to be selling them the system is going to point out the more expensive, newest one.

832
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Anyhow. Yeah, the redesign is weird, but I'm kind of like, I just don't care.

833
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Like, there's so much more to worry about with these consoles than the look.

834
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
And Rob, Betamax forever.

835
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Whatever. Move on. Dark Saga.

836
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Yeah, okay, I got other stuff.

837
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Now, this one, it's a little bit more falls into the conspiracy theory part of...

838
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:00,000
I don't really know exactly how to think about it, but the first time I saw this article, it really made me raise my eyebrow.

839
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:08,000
It's an article of a guy named Jason. I'm trying to see what his full name is.

840
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:21,000
But he was basically at E3 taking photos of the Microsoft booth, or some of the gaming booths, and he took a picture of a laptop being hooked up.

841
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:32,000
And he got pulled aside and was told to delete the photo, which he actually went back and redrew, of basically the games running off of laptops and PCs.

842
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Now, there was a big stink going on about this on the Game Facts board, which I was reading through, and they're saying, no, those can't be dev kits.

843
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:55,000
They are running off of Nvidia cards, which, as far as I was aware, the Nvidia GTX cards, which, as far as I was aware, wasn't supposed to be incorporated into the final system.

844
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:01,000
So they're saying that they weren't actually running off of the development PCs. These were running off of regular PCs.

845
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,000
And they even had the games crash the PCs.

846
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Okay, that makes sense, because I was going to say, when you first brought this up, I'm like, alright, well, you know, having the consoles running off PCs isn't that big a deal.

847
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I remember when the 360 was first shown, it was the same thing. Whatever, that's not a big deal.

848
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,000
But yeah, if you're talking about, they're like, really different, that's interesting.

849
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:32,000
I don't know, I kind of, I'm going to be honest, I think there is a real desire in the gaming community right now to just dogpile Microsoft.

850
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Let's kick the bastards while they're down for daring to fuck with my used games. Beat them up.

851
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:42,000
But then again, Microsoft should have left that guy alone when he took the picture.

852
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Well, here's the other thing. That threat on Game Facts is gone.

853
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Well, I don't understand how they could say, you better delete that photo. I'd be like, you better fuck off.

854
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Hold on, let me see if I can find it. Okay, a guard stood outside to keep me from freaking out and making a run for it.

855
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:01,000
A couple Microsoft PR folks came in, large four smiles on their faces, they just wanted to talk to me.

856
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:06,000
And then going, they made a big point of telling me they were not telling me to delete the photos.

857
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:13,000
That's because they really couldn't, since they never said what could or couldn't be photos, but they also didn't want me to leave that little room with those photos.

858
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Share.

859
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:21,000
That's the news story here. Microsoft made a big deal out of something that shouldn't have been a big deal.

860
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Now, here's just two more lines.

861
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:30,000
It was weird they were clearly unhappy and concerned, even though they insisted that laptop was just controlling looping video,

862
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:35,000
which it certainly may have been doing, which makes it even weirder that they were so upset at the photos.

863
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Not being able to take their intense stares and restrained desire to yank the camera out of my hands any longer, I just deleted the photos.

864
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Then they set me free.

865
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,000
He redrew the, and I'm actually, I'm going to go ahead and link this article for everybody.

866
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:53,000
It was on Gizmodo, actually the Australian Gizmodo site.

867
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:57,000
But I'm going to link it in the chatroom because it really is worth giving a good read over.

868
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,000
And he drew a copy of the photo.

869
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:09,000
It doesn't seem like it would be anything, but what makes it most suspicious is that they made a big stink out of it.

870
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:15,000
You know, if they had just said, oh, whatever, you know, it's sort of like when you tell the little kid they can't have something,

871
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,000
and then the kid thinks that that's something big and that they're going to sneak and get it.

872
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:24,000
It's that same type of thing. It makes it a bigger deal than what, you know, if it wasn't a big deal,

873
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,000
why are they trying to restrain this guy and browbeat him into deleting a photo?

874
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,000
I bet you the PS4s are running off PCs too.

875
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Well, yeah, all the dev kits are PCs.

876
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:40,000
But if these aren't exactly the dev kits, if they are trying to run it off of a more beefed up system, then we have a problem.

877
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Especially if they're saying that they're being run off of the system hardware.

878
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:49,000
It's a huge risk too, because if the game that comes out doesn't match what was played at E3,

879
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,000
the people that played at E3 are going to call it out.

880
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,000
It was Colonial Marines all over again.

881
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,000
But it's Gearbox not making the game, so they're okay, right?

882
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
I don't know.

883
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Anyhow, let's move on.

884
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Alright, so, hey, you want that Xbox One?

885
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Well, you better be living in certain regions of the world, because it only supports a few different countries.

886
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:23,000
So at launch, if you're living in a good portion of Asia, well, you're fucked.

887
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:48,000
So basically, the only places, countries that you can access Xbox Live at launch are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and the US.

888
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
No Japan.

889
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
No Japan.

890
01:02:51,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Even though the first developer up, Japanese developer, and I think the only Japanese developer that showed up at E3's press conference, which I also found interesting.

891
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:08,000
I found it very interesting who was at what press conference. Did you notice there was no EA at Sony's conference?

892
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:14,000
And that they were showing the 2K sports game instead. I just thought it was interesting. Just put it out there. I thought it was very interesting.

893
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
I think it's noteworthy.

894
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Noted.

895
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Noted, yeah.

896
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Alright. What do you think though about the fact that they left Japan off? I mean, I think we all knew that Microsoft was going to write them off, but that, I mean a lot of great games come out of Japan.

897
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
It's a little weird to me.

898
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:42,000
But it seems like a lot of them, to me, it seems like they're willing to write off a lot of these people that would buy this console.

899
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:49,000
They're willing to write off Japan as a whole, even though there are some people that did buy the Xbox 360. They're willing to write off people that don't have good internet.

900
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:56,000
They're willing to write those people off. They're willing to write off, you know, people that are in the military. They have to write them off.

901
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000
It's disrespect and being un-inclusive.

902
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:12,000
They're just like, too bad. You can't conform to what we want. So, hey, you guys, and I heard the argument from fanboys saying, well, hey, they had broadband internet on the original Xbox. That was the only way. No dial-up.

903
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:23,000
And people still bought it. Yeah, but you know what? It's a little different to, I don't know if it's an equal comparison because you can still play games offline with the original Xbox.

904
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Well, I think IKUMA JP pretty much nailed it. We don't care now.

905
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Well, it's just interesting to me because I realize, you know, and I see a lot of folks overall on chat are saying like, well, Microsoft gave up on Japan a long time ago, but I'm kind of like, okay.

906
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Japan was ever really into Microsoft.

907
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Well, but again, the first developer, first trailer to show up at the Microsoft thing, Japanese developers.

908
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:56,000
What was the biggest response at a Sony's press conference beside the whole, you know, going for the jugular Microsoft policy? Two games developed by a Japanese studio.

909
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:01,000
That happened to be coming to Microsoft system as well, but it wasn't really pointed out.

910
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:08,000
I thought it was interesting. Noted. Make a note. That's all.

911
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Anyhow. Well, this isn't from a Japanese developer, but it certainly got a lot of people excited anyway.

912
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:24,000
It's a new Mirror's Edge game and, you know, a lot of people had a sad when it didn't show up at, you know, Microsoft's thing or whatever.

913
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:30,000
But then it showed up later, yay, at EA's press conference that a new Mirror's Edge game is in the works.

914
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:36,000
It is a reboot, actually, of the franchise, which, you know, is weird because there was only one game, so they're rebooting the one game.

915
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,000
But that's all right, you know. It's going to be open world this time.

916
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:47,000
And a nice little letter posted on the official Mirror's Edge site from DICE senior producer Sarah Jansen.

917
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:53,000
We introduced Mirror's Edge and Faith to gamers five years ago, and we've waited for the right moment to reunite them.

918
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Thanks to the Frostbite engine, which a whole shit ton of those EA games are all running on.

919
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,000
That's like EA's bread and butter right now, is that Frostbite engine, if you think about it.

920
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:10,000
And a new generation of platforms. We are now able to deliver a richer world the players will be able to explore with a new level of freedom in both movement and action.

921
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,000
And a lot of people very excited about this. And, yeah, I'm curious, too.

922
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:23,000
You know, I didn't, like, love the first game, but I definitely respected it, and I'm looking forward to this reimagining of Mirror's Edge.

923
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
I am glad that it's multi-platform.

924
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Mm-hmm, me too.

925
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Very cool. Moving on, Dark Sakura and then release dates.

926
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Well, we have, you know, we sort of made a mention of this, I think, a little bit earlier, but we like Minecraft, don't we?

927
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:45,000
I used to hate Minecraft. Now I love it. I don't play it on Xbox, which now I'm glad that I don't.

928
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Yeah, you definitely don't play it on the VoG network server anymore.

929
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Well, I did, but it wasn't always connecting.

930
01:06:52,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Well, here is a really crappy thing for all of you Xbox Minecraft fans. Your save's not going to carry over to the Xbone.

931
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Oops!

932
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Yeah, I'm not surprised.

933
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:13,000
I'm getting the sense that it's, even though they're both Minecraft, they're still, like, separate games. That's kind of the sense I'm getting from this, you know?

934
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:17,000
They said that they were discussing it, but I don't think it's going to happen.

935
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:26,000
You know, they really do seem to be trying to put this wedge of separation in between the 360 and the bone.

936
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:35,000
I just don't really see that as an issue, just because it's just like, if you were to have, I don't know.

937
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:45,000
It would be hard because those features that are on the original version of Minecraft, like your worlds and stuff, are going to be locked into a certain size and stuff.

938
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:51,000
When you're putting in basically a redone engine, even though it is the same game, it's just not going to transfer over.

939
01:07:51,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Just start anew. I mean, seriously, it's not that big a deal. I don't know. But, you know, once again, I think it's a whole dog-pile mentality.

940
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,000
But there are people who put a lot of time and effort into their crap on Minecraft.

941
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Yeah, I mean, a game like Minecraft, I'm actually like, you know, a lot of people have created these huge things, and maybe Minecraft on Xbox One will fix some of the things.

942
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Like, you know, you're not going to have the limits on the world size like 360. Yeah, maybe it's going to fix some of these things, but it would be nice if people could transfer their time and effort over.

943
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:29,000
I've seen people put a lot of effort into building some of the same monumental, ginormous creations on Xbox as they have to doing on a PC.

944
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,000
And it's a shame not to be able to carry that over.

945
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:39,000
I think part of what makes this noteworthy is that it shouldn't be that fucking hard. It's Minecraft. It's not that.

946
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
It's a Java game.

947
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:49,000
I know. It's not. I'm like, you know, I'm not belittling what a huge impact Minecraft has been on gaming and the heavy hitter that it is as far as the game is concerned.

948
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:54,000
But it doesn't seem like to me that it should be that big a fucking deal to transfer a save file over.

949
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
I don't think it should be at all.

950
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Yeah.

951
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Well, especially, is there any sort of cloud saving on Xbox? I haven't touched my Xbox in forever.

952
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
There is.

953
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
So they've got a cloud saving feature.

954
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
You're right.

955
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Why shouldn't they be able to transfer things over via cloud?

956
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Because it's a sad cloud.

957
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
It's not a happy little cloud.

958
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
It's a rain cloud.

959
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,000
It's a sad cloud that rains shit.

960
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Speaking of the cloud, Brad from Pod Culture says,

961
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Rob, I wonder how that DCU for the PS4 will tie in with the PS3 version or even if it will.

962
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Check Bobby's answers at e3.vognetwork.com because I believe he came back.

963
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Was it you or somebody else had asked a question very similar to that.

964
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:44,000
And I believe the response was it is that you will be able to log in and it's the same just with new textures

965
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,000
and, you know, everything you would expect from going up to the PlayStation 4.

966
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,000
It sounded like the right answer, actually.

967
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
I'll split it that way.

968
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,000
I think everything did transfer over.

969
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Yeah.

970
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,000
All right.

971
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Let's travel around the world and check out some games that are coming out a lot sooner than what we saw at e3.

972
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Not a whole lot this week.

973
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Actually, some Vita stuff.

974
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Jak and Daxter Collection coming out on the Vita.

975
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Also this week, Muramasa Rebirth coming out on Vita as well.

976
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:22,000
And then Game & Wario one week from today.

977
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Nice.

978
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Something for the Wii U.

979
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Yeah.

980
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Great.

981
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Have you checked out The Last of Us yet?

982
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
I am hearing such amazing, amazing things about that game.

983
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
I really want to check it out.

984
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
I just don't care.

985
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
I mean, I don't know.

986
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
I just I don't really.

987
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
I'm not.

988
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
No.

989
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Are you sure you're not going to be like like I originally was with Mass Effect where it's like, I'm not going to like this game.

990
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
I'm not going to like this game.

991
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,000
And then I play the game like the story is so fucking good, though.

992
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:55,000
It's just I don't really want to I don't want to start another game right now.

993
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
I'll tell you what, though.

994
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Fair enough.

995
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
What?

996
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
This is a completely off topic here.

997
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
So Bobby got the information from it.

998
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:07,000
The Earth Defense Force 2025 is fucking coming out next year in 2014.

999
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:11,000
So, you know, that means you got to import the fucking version that's coming out in Japan in July.

1000
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Good.

1001
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Good job, Bobby.

1002
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
I'm ruining Loki's day.

1003
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:18,000
But as they mentioned, there are some digging.

1004
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
The PlayStation 4 will be region free.

1005
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
And here's the weird thing, though.

1006
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:26,000
It's region free, both disc based game and digital games.

1007
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,000
So that's not true.

1008
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:35,000
I think right now on the PlayStation three, I think you can only buy stuff from certain regions, but apparently you can buy.

1009
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:42,000
I don't know if you have to create another account like in that region, but that'd be kind of cool if I can buy like Japanese games or something.

1010
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Bobby Blackwell's in our chat room right now at live dog network dot com.

1011
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Wanting you to know he took a picture of the banner just for you, Loki.

1012
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
It's all right.

1013
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
They're going to be coming to our game summit in the end of July.

1014
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:57,000
And I, you know, our rep over, you know, Phillips, say, justify, justify, justify.

1015
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
She knows I'm a huge fan.

1016
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,000
And it was last year.

1017
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Got some fly swatters based on insect Armageddon stuff.

1018
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,000
So that's why I saw the play through insect Armageddon.

1019
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
I got on one of those humble bundles or whatever.

1020
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
So.

1021
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,000
All right.

1022
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Let's talk about release dates in Japan and on the PlayStation three this week, a new dual shock controller in a gray color.

1023
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Also, The Last of Us making its way to Japan both on June 20th.

1024
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:27,000
If for whatever reason, The Last of Us is not up your alley, try Dyson Ryaku.

1025
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
I'm sorry, I said that wrong. Dyson Ryaku.

1026
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Daitoua Kobushi.

1027
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Tora Tora Tora Wara Kishuniseko Seri.

1028
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Yes, that is the full name of the game.

1029
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Regular and luxury editions.

1030
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
You might have caught from the Tora Tora Tora in there.

1031
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,000
It is a plane fight type game.

1032
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
There you go.

1033
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
I like that it's called a luxury edition.

1034
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,000
That makes it seem regular and luxury.

1035
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
It's luxurious.

1036
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Does it come wrapped in silk on the Xbox 360?

1037
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,000
I will still cover releases on 360 in Japan as long as they're there.

1038
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Batman Arkham Twin Pack, a repackaging,

1039
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:08,000
assumably of the two Batman games for Japanese audiences there.

1040
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:13,000
That's probably like a price drop type of thing on the PlayStation Vita this week.

1041
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Quite a bit.

1042
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,000
FIFA 13 World Class Soccer gets a price reduction.

1043
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:21,000
I'm sorry, Winning Post 7 2013 comes out this week.

1044
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Also a new game.

1045
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Kami Jaigen Idol Neptune PP in limited and regular editions.

1046
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,000
And I think this looks like some type of,

1047
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:34,000
like it might be a music game.

1048
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
I can't tell.

1049
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:41,000
I think it's like a pop idol game.

1050
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Jamie, help me.

1051
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Do you recognize anything from these screenshots here?

1052
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Like what type of game this might be?

1053
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
This seems to be the most telling one.

1054
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,000
You see the little things with the patterns on them.

1055
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
And it seems like maybe it's...

1056
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
I've never, I don't know this one.

1057
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,000
I don't know.

1058
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,000
All right.

1059
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Sorry.

1060
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Maybe somebody in chat does.

1061
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
What was the name again?

1062
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Kami Jaigen Idol Neptune PP.

1063
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
No, I don't know that one.

1064
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Maybe Akuma JP or somebody in chat will know.

1065
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,000
God Something Idol.

1066
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,000
I don't know.

1067
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,000
This is American Idol.

1068
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
No Nicki Minaj in that game.

1069
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
I did mention, I think that,

1070
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
I mentioned this on Twitter actually,

1071
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,000
cause Nintendo does some weird stuff with their,

1072
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
their item numbers for their games.

1073
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
And what was it for a new Luigi U?

1074
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,000
It was PPRS is their item number.

1075
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:29,000
That's the best.

1076
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,000
So...

1077
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Sorry, Akuma is asking for a link.

1078
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,000
So I just gave it to him.

1079
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Let me quickly do the other countries.

1080
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Sorry, Jamie.

1081
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,000
I know you were ready to go there,

1082
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
but I don't want to neglect the Wii U.

1083
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,000
I was just going to comment on that game.

1084
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Oh, okay.

1085
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
That you asked Akuma JP.

1086
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Oh, okay.

1087
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
So on the Wii U this week, nothing,

1088
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
but you do have F1 Race Stars powered up edition

1089
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,000
to look forward to next week.

1090
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
So there you go.

1091
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
And lastly, on the 3DS this week,

1092
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Kuma Tomo and Ninja Jajamaru-kun Sakurahime

1093
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Tokaryu no Himitsu comes out from Hamster this week

1094
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
on the Nintendo 3DS.

1095
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,000
So I remember I asked you about like,

1096
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:10,000
you know, the lack of F0 at, you know, E3 this year.

1097
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Are you at least excited that, you know,

1098
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:17,000
kind of Mario Kart 8 is sort of F0?

1099
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Mm-hmm.

1100
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Slow 0?

1101
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Before we get to the UK releases,

1102
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
some comments and chat on that game.

1103
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Queen Simea says,

1104
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Age of the Gods Idol Neptune?

1105
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,000
And AlphaKananogram says,

1106
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Sky, I think it's related to that Neptunia video game system

1107
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,000
slash company-based girls but idol game.

1108
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
That actually seems like a very lot.

1109
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
That seems like a much better thought out response

1110
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
than what I said.

1111
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,000
So we'll go with that until Akuma JP can translate for us.

1112
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
All right.

1113
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Dark Sakura, what about the UK?

1114
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Two games.

1115
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Neverwinter on PC and New Super Luigi Brothers U.

1116
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
When you first said Neverwinter,

1117
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
I thought about Neverwinter Nights.

1118
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
So did I.

1119
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,000
And I looked at it and it's like, no.

1120
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,000
And I'm like, oh wait, no,

1121
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
there's that free-to-play Neverwinter that actually,

1122
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,000
I get emails on that all the time.

1123
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,000
That's it.

1124
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
It looks exciting.

1125
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,000
That is truly it.

1126
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
No.

1127
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Sorry UK friends.

1128
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,000
All right.

1129
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Just a couple more stories for you guys

1130
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
in the classic game of the week.

1131
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Loki.

1132
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,000
All right.

1133
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
So let's see.

1134
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:20,000
I guess with the Xbox 360,

1135
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
a lot of people aren't really happy about the fact

1136
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:26,000
that they kind of put their video services behind a paywall.

1137
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Well, with the PlayStation 4,

1138
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
that's not going to be the case.

1139
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
They're not going to kind of,

1140
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
if you want to watch Netflix or something like that,

1141
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,000
you don't have to have PlayStation Plus to do that.

1142
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:41,000
You can actually just view all of their video services,

1143
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Netflix, Hulu, et cetera.

1144
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
So that's kind of nice that they're doing that.

1145
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
And free-to-play games, I guess,

1146
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
aren't going to require PlayStation Plus,

1147
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:54,000
but that's up to the publisher whether they do that or not.

1148
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,000
So there's still a chance that they might.

1149
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
I think that's kind of cool that they're doing that.

1150
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,000
I think it's another selling point over Xbox One.

1151
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,000
I hate to be one of those people dog-piling on Microsoft,

1152
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
but it is what it is, guys.

1153
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Sony offering that for free does make that PlayStation 4

1154
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:17,000
a slightly more attractive living room box for some people.

1155
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Again, the Xbox One integrated Skype thing is neat.

1156
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,000
It's not $500 neat for me, but it's neat.

1157
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Something PS4 doesn't have, I guess.

1158
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Moving on to some sad news out of E3 for a lot of people,

1159
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
and this is a boo at Sony.

1160
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,000
So for those of you that are about to call me a Sony fanboy

1161
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
after tonight's episode, nope.

1162
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Here's a negative for Sony and a big, hearty boo to Sony for this.

1163
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Jack Trenton talking to Game Trailers saying

1164
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:53,000
The Last Guardian is, quote, on hiatus.

1165
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Further quote, we got so many projects out there from so many great teams.

1166
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Projects never ultimately go away.

1167
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
So The Last Guardian is certainly not going away,

1168
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,000
but it's on hiatus right now.

1169
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,000
A lot of back and forth with this game, you know.

1170
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Lita a while ago said that the game was still in development,

1171
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
but, you know, now it's not.

1172
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
I heard that it was still in development, too.

1173
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,000
They were just like, it was kind of confusing.

1174
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,000
You know, this is just the new Final Fantasy versus XIII.

1175
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Or better yet, it's the new Duke Nukem Forever.

1176
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,000
They're putting it out for PlayStation 4.

1177
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
I think that's exactly what's happening,

1178
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
is it's going to be a PlayStation 4 title,

1179
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
and it's just taking its little time.

1180
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Maybe next year.

1181
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Maybe next year.

1182
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
But in the meantime, instead of looking forward,

1183
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,000
let's look back to a more classic time in video games history

1184
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:45,000
with a segment we call The Classic Game of the Week.

1185
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Dark Soccer is going to reach into the gaming vault

1186
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
and find a game that she thinks, hey, you ungrateful children

1187
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:52,000
should be playing this game immediately.

1188
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Right now, break out your Neo Geo.

1189
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
You got a good one this week, Dark Soccer.

1190
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,000
What is the classic game?

1191
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
I have to do my quote from the anime of this,

1192
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,000
because the dub was so awful.

1193
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Feel the storm, it's coming.

1194
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Yeah, Dan actually quotes that all the time,

1195
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
because my husband is a dork.

1196
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
It's from Fatal Fury.

1197
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Fatal Fury was the series that pretty much led into King of Fighters, you know.

1198
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:22,000
In fact, the first Fatal Fury was called Garo Densetsu, the King of Fighters.

1199
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:26,000
So the very first game, well, as it came out over here, actually,

1200
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
it was Fatal Fury, King of Fighters.

1201
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:34,000
It came out for the arcade, of course, for Neo Geo CD, Mega Drive.

1202
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:38,000
It came out on the Sharp computer, the SNES, the PS2, Virtual Console.

1203
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,000
It's been on everything.

1204
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:45,000
And of course, it spawned its better known sequels, Fatal Fury 2 and Fatal Fury Special.

1205
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:48,000
There was also Fatal Fury 3, Road to the Final Victory,

1206
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,000
a Real Bout Fatal Fury, Real Bout Fatal Fury Special,

1207
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Real Bout Fatal Fury to the newcomers.

1208
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,000
There was a Real Bout Garo Densetsu Special,

1209
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Dominated Mind, Fatal Fury Wild Ambition, Fatal Fury First Contact,

1210
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:05,000
and Garo Mark of the Wolves, which is probably my favorite in the series,

1211
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
because it was pretty badass.

1212
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:13,000
So anyway, with these games, the big mechanic that these fighting games brought in is that,

1213
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
well, for the first one, you could only play three characters.

1214
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,000
You had Terry Bogard, you had Andy Bogard, and Joe Higashi,

1215
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:24,000
who had to fight against some of the bad guys coming up in their way.

1216
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:31,000
The thing about this one is that it had sort of this multi-plane type of setting,

1217
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:37,000
where you could dodge moves by jumping from the foreground to the background and vice versa.

1218
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:46,000
And as these evolved in later versions, it even had, I think it was on Fatal Fury 3?

1219
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Yeah, it was. Fatal Fury 3, you could actually throw your enemies into the back platform

1220
01:20:53,000 --> 01:21:00,000
or into the front, running directly pretty much into the crowd as a special ending move.

1221
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:05,000
I remember in the aquarium level, you could throw somebody into the aquarium,

1222
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:09,000
and they'd just crack the glass and slump to the floor.

1223
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:16,000
So yeah, it was a really neat series, and like I said, it gave us the King of Fighters series,

1224
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:22,000
which I'm sure as a lot of people know is probably one of my favorite fighting game series altogether.

1225
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:28,000
I myself have two of them on Neo Geo, which if you can play them on the Neo Geo, just do that,

1226
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:33,000
because that is the way to play any type of SNK game.

1227
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:39,000
As far as the series goes, it actually had a sister series that was called Art of Fighting,

1228
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:46,000
that was set in exactly the same universe, so it was why a lot of the characters crossed over.

1229
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Quick question, was World Heroes in that same universe?

1230
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:53,000
I do not think World Heroes was, because none of the characters in World Heroes showed up in King of Fighters.

1231
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Okay, I thought there was another series where they started showing up in King of Fighters,

1232
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
but I guess that wasn't World Heroes, was it?

1233
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Because as I started combining those universes, keep in mind that they threw in the Ikari Warriors universe.

1234
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Oh, yeah.

1235
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
They threw in Psycho Soldier.

1236
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:09,000
I kind of lost track of this. I like Fatal Fury a lot, actually, at the time.

1237
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Not so much the original, although I understand why it's worthy of the Classic Game of the Week,

1238
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
but more like Special probably was my big one.

1239
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Fatal Fury Special was, I think, the one that I saw in the arcades most.

1240
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:25,000
But, I mean, it gave us my Shiranui and her boobs.

1241
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Which, such a big outcry about the character, I thought she was hilarious.

1242
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:38,000
She also was probably my favorite to play in that game next to Kim Kap Wan later on.

1243
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Kim Kap Wan was my favorite.

1244
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Yeah, because, well, although if you're really good with Joe Higashi, you could apparently just smack anybody down because it was awesome.

1245
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Although I've seen a perfect playthrough, actually, I think this is an example of a perfect playthrough with Andy Bogard.

1246
01:22:53,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Really, all of the characters, in my opinion, were so well-balanced that if you knew them inside and out, you could really destroy anybody in this game.

1247
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:10,000
I mean, yeah, you had your good masher characters.

1248
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
I mean, yeah, I think that Mai was a masher character.

1249
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Yuri was a masher character.

1250
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:21,000
I mean, she has a lot of charge moves, but Yuri was a major masher character, especially with her flying butt powers.

1251
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:35,000
But for the most part, you know, it gave us such a huge list of characters, too, that, like I said, carried over into King of Fighters.

1252
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Like, even Ryo Sakazaki was in two of the Fatal Fury games, who was an Art of Fighting character.

1253
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:55,000
On top of that, this is the game that also, I mean, basically leading into Art of Fighting gave us one of our first big multi-game crossovers.

1254
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Which, I mean, now we have a versus series now, I think pretty much because of Fatal Fury and it leading into the King of Fighters series.

1255
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:15,000
You know, King of Fury, King of Fighters was pretty much Art of Fighting and Fatal Fury mixed with a few other SNK games.

1256
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:19,000
But that was our first big versus thing and led us into...

1257
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Yeah, Capcom versus SNK 2, which wouldn't have been possible without these games, is probably like my favorite 2D fighter ever, which I'm sure a lot of people feel that way.

1258
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:30,000
And a lot of people want to say that it's, you know, the X-Men versus Street Fighter and all that.

1259
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:38,000
No, no, no, no. It started with KOF. I really think it started with KOF, which, like I said, came from Fatal Fury.

1260
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:46,000
And even in the Fatal Fury universe with Art of Fighting, Art of Fighting led to everybody's favorite joke character, Dan Hibiki.

1261
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Because it was a combination, his dad was supposed to be like a parody of Mr. Karate.

1262
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:58,000
And then he was, what was it, Robert Garcia and Ryo combined.

1263
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Tung-Fu-Ruu was so badass. I'm looking at the video right now where this guy is fighting Tung-Fu-Ruu. That guy was awesome.

1264
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:09,000
You know who else I was pretty good with? Duck King. Just because he was so hilarious.

1265
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:16,000
But yeah, and I'm not going to go into any more about the gameplay, because honestly, King of...

1266
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:22,000
I'm not going to go back to King of Fighters. Fatal Fury was pretty generic as far as you have punches, you have special moves,

1267
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:28,000
you have super moves. In the later games you built up meters, you had combos, you had all of the same stuff.

1268
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:41,000
But this one, the thing that really set it apart was that multi-plane fighting and the fact that it gave birth to an entire lineage of fighting games right after that.

1269
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:48,000
So I'm going to go for the whole Fatal Fury series just because of what came from it.

1270
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:55,000
And again, my favorite in the series is Garo Densetsu because I like playing as a rock coward.

1271
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Classic Game of the Week.

1272
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,000
And Blue Mary.

1273
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Classic Game of the Week. Fatal Fury for the Neo Geo. Great pick.

1274
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Again, another one of those picks you go, how many weeks have you done a Classic Game of the Week?

1275
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:08,000
About 300 weeks now and somehow this never came up before?

1276
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,000
How many different games have we had that happen with?

1277
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Daytona.

1278
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,000
Daytona.

1279
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,000
It's always funny. It's always funny.

1280
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:19,000
You didn't do Fatal Fury Special or Fatal Fury 2 one week?

1281
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,000
I looked.

1282
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Wow. Alright.

1283
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Then again, I didn't look under Garo Densetsu but I figured that if anyone was putting it down there they would have done either.

1284
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
The Wiki people are pretty good about that.

1285
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Alright, we've got plenty more to come in Part B tonight.

1286
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Fugu Question of the Week and more news, even stuff that's not just E3.

1287
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Your emails and yes, your phone calls when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1288
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Orange Lounge Radio

1289
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Hi there, this is Elliott B and you're participating with Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.

1290
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:03,000
And I want to use my voice to tell you that Donkey Kong Country 2 is the best game ever released on the Super Nintendo.

1291
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:09,000
It has musical apes, fighting reptilian pirates, what more could you ask for?

1292
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Oh, I don't know, maybe a new Metroid instead, just saying.

1293
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Just saying, throwing it out there, no.

1294
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Thank you very much to Elliott for leaving that bumper.

1295
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
I really appreciate it there.

1296
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,000
If you want to leave a bumper for us, more information available on our forum.

1297
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:28,000
The VOG Network forums, vognetwork.com and just look for the word forums at the top of the screen.

1298
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,000
It's not that hard to find.

1299
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:32,000
I appreciate Elliott taking the time to leave that for us.

1300
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:39,000
And yeah, it kind of reminds me to say something I didn't say in the first part of the show about the Donkey Kong reveal.

1301
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:43,000
Which I realize has people like Elliott probably very excited.

1302
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:51,000
For me, I was like, I just bought a Donkey Kong game on 3DS literally weeks ago and now they're announcing another.

1303
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Now I realize the one on 3DS is a little different, but I was kind of like, I feel like Donkey Kong Overload.

1304
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,000
I could have gone for a new Metroid.

1305
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:04,000
It doesn't look that different, aside from, oh now the barrels will shoot you into the background.

1306
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,000
It's not exactly just 2D.

1307
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,000
To be fair though, those games are rock solid platformers.

1308
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:15,000
They're super fun and that's where I think that success is going to be in.

1309
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:18,000
No, I don't doubt it will be successful.

1310
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:21,000
TigerConChat says, Rob, actually I want a new Star Fox.

1311
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,000
That would be good.

1312
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
And not that adventure is bullshit either, but that would be good.

1313
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
A new Star Fox would be good.

1314
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
But nothing would top a new F-Zero.

1315
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Maybe after this Mario Kart 8 thing, which does look good, maybe we can get that as our racing game for 2014.

1316
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
A man can dream.

1317
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,000
A man can dream.

1318
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:41,000
I also want to make sure we say at some point tonight a Happy Father's Day.

1319
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:46,000
I know we were busy talking about E3 in the beginning there, but let us not forget it is Father's Day.

1320
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,000
So Happy Father's Day to all the father or fatherly figures out there.

1321
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Especially our own Loki.

1322
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Is Josh at the age where he can kind of recognize Father's Day yet?

1323
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,000
No.

1324
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,000
And wish you a happy one?

1325
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,000
No.

1326
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Not quite?

1327
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,000
No.

1328
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Alright.

1329
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Well, maybe next time.

1330
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:09,000
If my BFF is listening, then tell Chris I said Happy Father's Day.

1331
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,000
There you go.

1332
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,000
And tell Julian to clean his room to be nice.

1333
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:18,000
I'll wish Alan a Happy Father's Day because Sanrio the kitty is very well taken care of.

1334
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:21,000
And he sends me videos when I'm out of town and everything.

1335
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Even though she was very antisocial.

1336
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Big floof ball.

1337
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,000
I still need to get a good picture of her to put on the interwebs.

1338
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Well, is Alan ever going to come over here and talk to me about what he thought about E3 and all this stuff?

1339
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Oh, we finally had the comment in chat, by the way.

1340
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Who that is? My baby daddy.

1341
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Yay, putting him on the spot.

1342
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Hi, Alan. Long time, no talk.

1343
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Hello.

1344
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Welcome to the show.

1345
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Thank you.

1346
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Do you have anything you want to plug while you're here?

1347
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Everyone's saying that Microsoft killed Sony.

1348
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Or sorry, Sony killed Microsoft at E3, but more like Microsoft killed themselves and then Sony just showed up with pizza and a bag of weed.

1349
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Why y'all mad and sad? We got good shit here.

1350
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,000
I asked you if you had anything you wanted to plug and that was your answer.

1351
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:06,000
It was essentially pizza and weed, but that's alright.

1352
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:10,000
What? I don't run any shows. What would I plug?

1353
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:16,000
You listen to other people's shows more than you listen to mine. Do you want to plug The Nerdist?

1354
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,000
You know what? I'm all for the Alan show. Alan needs his own show.

1355
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:22,000
Alan does need his own show, but he's a little shy. Would you do your own show, Alan?

1356
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,000
No.

1357
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:28,000
See? He wouldn't do it. He just walks on here, gives his witty commentary, and then leaves.

1358
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Any other observations about this year's E3?

1359
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:39,000
There's a lot of really bad misinformation about the Xbox One, and I kind of feel bad for Microsoft even though they've brought it on themselves

1360
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:43,000
because all the made-up shit about their console is completely believable, even if it's not true.

1361
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Oh, like the whole it's only launching in 21 states thing?

1362
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Well, there's the 21 country IP address thing, but no, there was that post about if your account is banned,

1363
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:00,000
all of your licenses, even if it's attached to a physical disk, are deactivated, which is not true,

1364
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:07,000
but that super fits into what they're legitimately doing, that it's super easy to believe something like that.

1365
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:10,000
It's everybody dogpiling on Microsoft. Let's kick them while they're down.

1366
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:14,000
How dare they implement these DRMs? Kick, kick, punch, punch.

1367
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Yeah, at the end of the console cycle that they're not going to shut off the servers, but that's years away.

1368
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Yeah, and I didn't know either. I just found this out yesterday.

1369
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:31,000
The 24-hour ping to make sure that your shit works, the internet connectivity.

1370
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:38,000
If you're playing your game at a friend's house under your account, it pings once an hour because it's not your console.

1371
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
It's a mess.

1372
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:47,000
And just so you know, Alan at live.vognetwork.com, let's see, rostielut agrees with you in part.

1373
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Sony really only needed to show up.

1374
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Misty says, I approve of an Alan show.

1375
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:56,000
SSU100Matt says, Alan has plenty of drop the mic moments.

1376
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:59,000
Because I'm the best.

1377
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Drop. All right, anything else quickly before we say bye and get into rapid fire news?

1378
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Sanrio is shy.

1379
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Yeah, she is. She's a good kitty though.

1380
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,000
All right, let's get into rapid fire news, Loki.

1381
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:21,000
All right. So, one of the things that they talked about during the Microsoft press conference is that they're going to be getting rid of the Microsoft points.

1382
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:26,000
So, how's that going to work now that I have Microsoft points? How's that going to convert?

1383
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Well, they're just going to convert it over. They're going to take your space bucks and make them into actual bucks.

1384
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:37,000
So, in North America, 80 points or less to the dollar will exchange to that dollar.

1385
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:49,000
However, there is one little bullet point on there or asterisk, I guess, that when they do convert those into actual dollars, they must be spent within a year.

1386
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Otherwise, you lose them, which is bullshit if you ask me.

1387
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:01,000
But then be the, you know, terms, I guess.

1388
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
That's kind of bullshit, I agree.

1389
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:11,000
But hopefully I didn't have enough left in my account where, you know, I'll buy one Xbox Live Arcade game and that's it.

1390
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:18,000
I still got 20 bucks because I tried buying a game for 20 bucks and it took money off my credit card instead of using the points that I already had.

1391
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Thank you.

1392
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:30,000
It's funny as I got two points cards for my birthday and I've only used one of them so that I could play stuff on rock band so that I could sing Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots.

1393
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,000
Thank you.

1394
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:39,000
So now I think I'm just going to buy all the Mass Effect gear for my character, even though I don't touch it on the Xbox.

1395
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Alright, another cool announcement is Twitch was saying that, you know, because they have a partnership with the Xbox One where it's going to be integrated in there so you can stream the Twitch.

1396
01:33:50,000 --> 01:34:03,000
But it's also got this software development kit that actually will allow anybody to integrate it into their consoles to broadcast from any platform, including PlayStation 4 if they really wanted to.

1397
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Wasn't the Ouya supposed to be getting a Twitch thing too?

1398
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Ouya already has, it's a Twitch viewer. Basically it's an app that you can view Twitch streams on.

1399
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Ouya is probably not powerful enough to broadcast, I'm sorry.

1400
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,000
No.

1401
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:25,000
That's actually what I was thinking of because I think of the Twitch 360 app, I think of a viewer only, and I keep forgetting that this new console generation, oh no, it will broadcast as well.

1402
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:31,000
I don't think, yeah, I don't think it has enough power to do that, so whatever.

1403
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:36,000
But yeah, it's going to be cool that they can integrate this into a bunch of stuff.

1404
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:44,000
So I think it's very possible that we'll see that coming to, you know, the PlayStation 4 because they have Ustream and that's kind of like...

1405
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:54,000
I think a little competition is healthy though, even though I don't particularly care for the way Ustream, I think the Nintendo Press, or Nintendo Direct through Ustream kind of says it all about Ustream.

1406
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:58,000
I think a little competition is healthy. I'd like to see more options than just Twitch out there.

1407
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,000
Yeah.

1408
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:05,000
And last but not least, of course, they were talking about Summer of Arcade.

1409
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:12,000
It's coming August 7th and will include such titles as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows.

1410
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Also a remake or reboot, if you will, of Flashback, the old 1992 classic.

1411
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Brother is a Tale of Two Sons.

1412
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:26,000
And Charlie Murder, which is being done by the guys that did the Dishwasher game.

1413
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
So that should be good.

1414
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:37,000
And of course, no word if they're still doing that deal where you buy all the games and get money back type thing, any pricing.

1415
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Or free games.

1416
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Or free games, so we'll have to wait.

1417
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Alright, I got some news real quick. One of them about the game Ultima Forever.

1418
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Don't get too excited, it's not really a PC game, it's that iOS game, the Ultima iOS game that's being made.

1419
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Some of the currency was really balanced this week.

1420
01:35:54,000 --> 01:36:00,000
It's out in Canada because their EA tends to beta a lot of this type of stuff in Canada and then they release it in the US.

1421
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:05,000
How does that make our Canadian listeners feel that they're beta testers for this?

1422
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Well, whatever, at least you're getting to play it.

1423
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:11,000
But they did some really big change with some of the currency prices.

1424
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Apparently, in the game you have to repair items and it used to cost like 60 keys to repair certain items, so they've lowered that to like 8 to 10.

1425
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:25,000
And increasing storage space in your stash was lowered and so on and so on.

1426
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:30,000
So they're trying to not make it so crazy, I guess, where you're going to feel like you're forced to buy things.

1427
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:37,000
However, the highest quality chests, they went up in price as part of this balancing, so I guess not everything was a win.

1428
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:42,000
Interesting talk out there about the new Zelda game.

1429
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Look, we all know there's going to be a new Zelda game.

1430
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:49,000
It will probably be the big thing that Nintendo shows in 2014.

1431
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:52,000
But the producer of the series said something interesting this week.

1432
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Eiji Aonuma said this week that he's a big fan of Skyrim.

1433
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:00,000
And this is very interesting.

1434
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:05,000
So he was asked if he was looking at any other titles for inspiration for the new Zelda game.

1435
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
He said, Skyrim.

1436
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:11,000
Obviously, I play other games and I'm curious what Zelda fans like about the Skyrim experience.

1437
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Maybe there are some Zelda fans who are looking for something similar out of a Zelda game.

1438
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,000
But I don't look at the technology that made these games possible.

1439
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
I don't look at what's happening in the game, but how it made me feel.

1440
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:24,000
What in the game moved me and how I can bring out those same emotions to players who play my games.

1441
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:28,000
My intent isn't to copy them, but those are the things that stay with you as a player.

1442
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:31,000
It's not what you see about the game that makes you feel...

1443
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Excuse me.

1444
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:37,000
It's not what you see, but how the game makes you feel that makes you feel closer to the experience.

1445
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:40,000
It's more about the feeling and expression of emotions in the game.

1446
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:43,000
And I do take that into consideration when working on my own projects.

1447
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:48,000
So, could Link be taking the arrow to the knee in the next installment?

1448
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Alright, no. Obviously, it's not...

1449
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,000
I think open world is what they're...

1450
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,000
Well, actually, most of the games are open world, so...

1451
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Yeah, I'm thinking, too, like, you know, maybe a lot of the...

1452
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:00,000
In Skyrim, you tend to really be able to interact with everything.

1453
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Maybe that's part of it, too.

1454
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Maybe building more side quests. I don't know. It could be interesting.

1455
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:08,000
I always thought, you know how in Wind Waker, how there...

1456
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,000
Well, spoiler.

1457
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:12,000
There's a portion of it where you go under the sea.

1458
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
And you see, under the sea.

1459
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
You see the 3D world that's down there.

1460
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:19,000
And I'm like, why wasn't this Wind Waker?

1461
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Because that would have been amazing.

1462
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:25,000
So, I'm hoping that it's something like that, but, you know, better graphics.

1463
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Did they maybe include that in the remake of Wind Waker HD?

1464
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Life under the sea is better than anything they got up there.

1465
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:49,000
To seaweed is always greener.

1466
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
Everything looks better in HD.

1467
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,000
You dream of...

1468
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,000
Alright, forget it.

1469
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Also, something else about Nintendo.

1470
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Retro is actually coming out.

1471
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Funny, we had that discussion earlier in the show.

1472
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Retro saying that it was hard to decide between Metroid and Donkey Kong.

1473
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
You made the wrong choice. Just saying.

1474
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:09,000
I'm just kidding. Alright, Donkey Kong fans, put your torches down.

1475
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Put your torches down.

1476
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:15,000
I think that was just kind of an off-the-cusp comment that Michael Kelbaugh,

1477
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
who's the president and CEO of Retro Studios,

1478
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:22,000
told the official Nintendo magazine via Twitter between the two.

1479
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:26,000
I'm sure the Metroid game will happen sometime this generation.

1480
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
It's just not right now.

1481
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Also, what I found interesting about the new Super Mario 3D world,

1482
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
I think what a lot of people are very excited about is that

1483
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:36,000
the Mario and Luigi characters that are in the game

1484
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:40,000
play like they do in Super Mario 2 on the NES.

1485
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
And if you think about it, we haven't really seen a game

1486
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:46,000
implement the characterization of those characters since that game.

1487
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
You know, with Peach floating and all that.

1488
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
So that was really cool that they brought that back.

1489
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Well, Peach wasn't originally planned as a playable character in Mario 3D World.

1490
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Because you know in the last few games, it's been Mario, Luigi, and the two totes.

1491
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Because female protagonists do not sell games.

1492
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Really?

1493
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:06,000
Obviously, he said that with his tongue firmly planted in cheek.

1494
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Well, you know, Nintendo got a lot of kudos this week for announcing

1495
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
some really awesome female characters.

1496
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Not just Peach, but the Wii Fit Trainer as a character in Super Smash Bros.

1497
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,000
I thought that was cool, and I'm glad that there were no rape jokes

1498
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
during their presentation of Smash Bros.

1499
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
That's a whole other Oprah.

1500
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
Alright, anyhow.

1501
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:30,000
And he's referring to what happened to the Microsoft thing if you didn't know.

1502
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Anyhow, a comment from Yoshiaki Koizumi said,

1503
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:39,000
quote, I think she adds a lot of the sense of completion

1504
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
when you get in multiplayer.

1505
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
You can have different people choosing different characters

1506
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
based on their personality or whoever they like.

1507
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:48,000
And Princess Peach is just really a lot of fun to play.

1508
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:51,000
But yeah, Peach was not originally a playable character in the game.

1509
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Which means the plot isn't that they're rescuing her for a change.

1510
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:59,000
So that's good, I think.

1511
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
And hell, I like playing as Princess Peach.

1512
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
That float ability is badass.

1513
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:07,000
She's kind of actually like way better than the others

1514
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:08,000
because of that ability.

1515
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
But maybe this game will be more balanced than Mario 2 was.

1516
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
We'll see.

1517
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Dark Sakura.

1518
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
Oh, my iPad just completely crashed on me.

1519
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Give me a second.

1520
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,000
Oh, hooray.

1521
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,000
I know.

1522
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:21,000
All that porn, you know, Rob.

1523
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
It's crashing our show.

1524
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:26,000
So coming out is going to be Pac-Man Museum Collection.

1525
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:31,000
It's going to be on various different digital releases.

1526
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:37,000
It's supposed to include the Championship Edition and Pac-Man Battle Royale.

1527
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:42,000
And it's going to be on Xbox Live Arcade, PSN, PC, 3DS, and the Wii U eShop.

1528
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:45,000
So that is going to be super awesome cool.

1529
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:49,000
Which is funny because I was playing Super Pac-Man just the other day.

1530
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:53,000
And then also a trademark in the US is Contra Run and Gun.

1531
01:41:54,000 --> 01:42:01,000
It's a – well, they did tease a new Contra at E3 in 2011.

1532
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
But now we actually have a trademark to go with it.

1533
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:12,000
And last but not least, the inspiration for our Neil before VOG logo that went a while back.

1534
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Which not a lot of people got, unfortunately.

1535
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,000
It was our teaser.

1536
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
But maybe now that there's a movie out, which I want to see.

1537
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,000
You want to see the new movie, The Man of Steel?

1538
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,000
I want to see that.

1539
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Becky went and saw it today and said it was okay, but the end of it took forever.

1540
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Hmm, interesting.

1541
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:26,000
So anyway – oh, thank you, Geico ad for running.

1542
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:33,000
Anyway, so for Injustice Gods Among Us, a new character is going to be added and it is Zod.

1543
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Neil before Zod, son of Jor-El.

1544
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Which better be said in the movie.

1545
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
He better freaking – yeah.

1546
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
I don't want spoilers in chat.

1547
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
I will slap you with a trout if you spoil.

1548
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
If you spoil, we spank.

1549
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
All right.

1550
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Let's get to the foogle question of the week.

1551
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Every week we ask a question on our Facebook and Google Plus communities.

1552
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Slam it together and you get foogle.

1553
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
This week's question was all about E3.

1554
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
Because, you know, that's what every show wants to know.

1555
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
What did you think about E3, right?

1556
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:10,000
But we put a little twist on it.

1557
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Because, you know, everybody's talking about the freaking consoles and the whole, you know,

1558
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
everything we talked about in the first 30 minutes of the show tonight.

1559
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:21,000
So I want to say, what were you excited about that maybe other people missed?

1560
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
So that was the question.

1561
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
We'd like to know your thoughts on E3, but with a twist.

1562
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:28,000
You can't talk about the big press conferences or the new consoles.

1563
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:31,000
I know, I know, but there will be plenty of other time on tonight's show to talk about all that.

1564
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:36,000
We're looking for what you were excited to hear about that maybe slipped off someone else's radar

1565
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:42,000
amongst all the Sony versus Microsoft press conference with a side of Nintendo Direct chatter.

1566
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:43,000
So let's get to some of the answers.

1567
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:46,000
I'll start with Google Plus tonight, because I haven't been starting with them a lot lately,

1568
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
so I want to show them some love.

1569
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:52,000
ActDeft on Google Plus says, well, this technically counts as one of the big announcements,

1570
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:55,000
but I'm hyped to see a new Mirror's Edge in the works.

1571
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:56,000
I'll let it slide.

1572
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:01,000
Hopefully the wait won't be as long and the game will be great as the first one, if not more.

1573
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Deft, I'm going to say 2014.

1574
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:06,000
It's definitely not, they're not talking like it's 2013 game.

1575
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
It's not 2013.

1576
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Flaco Jones says, I was excited to see gameplay from the enemy within.

1577
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:15,000
If they keep to their word and go back to the roots of what makes survival horror great,

1578
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
then it should be an awesome experience.

1579
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Yeah, that was a comment from Bethesda coming through.

1580
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:25,000
One of the first things on the E3.MOG network experience was that they are going back to survival horror roots

1581
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:26,000
with the enemy within.

1582
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:29,000
I heard that it's supposed to be really, really gross.

1583
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Yay, gross games, except not really.

1584
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:37,000
I don't like gross games, but I know there are other people that are into the gross games, so enjoy it.

1585
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Going to some of the responses on Facebook.

1586
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:47,000
James S says, I feel like the game Killer is Dead might be the one that a lot of people didn't see anything on,

1587
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:50,000
but it's definitely a current gen title that people should be checking out.

1588
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:56,000
It looks pretty damn awesome and it's one of the very few current gen titles that are coming out during the remainder of this year.

1589
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Also, Dark Souls 2, need I say more?

1590
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Sadly, I don't think it's going to do very well because it comes out right at the same time as Splinter Cell

1591
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:09,000
and Saints Row and Madden and...

1592
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
I think there's an audience for it.

1593
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:17,000
As long as we can still get that mod on the PC version that instead of whenever you get you died,

1594
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
when you die it goes, thanks Obama.

1595
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
Have you heard about that hack?

1596
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:22,000
What?

1597
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:25,000
You know the thanks Obama meme, right?

1598
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Well, somebody made a hack for Dark Souls where every time you die,

1599
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:35,000
instead of it coming up saying you died in the big dramatic text, it comes up and says, thanks Obama.

1600
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
It's funny.

1601
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
It's funny.

1602
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:44,000
All right, Clerical Error 404, one of the peeps from Koopa Club.

1603
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:48,000
By the way, I'm supposed to be going on that show in the near future, so stay tuned for that.

1604
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:53,000
The Clerical Error 404 says, there were a number of games that were announced that I was excited to hear about.

1605
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Mirrors Edge 2, Super Mario 3D World, because you can play as Peach in the cat suits,

1606
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Super Smash Brothers for the 3DS version and the additional characters, Kingdom Hearts 3, duh.

1607
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:06,000
I wasn't happy with the announcement of the direction that Metroid is planning to take,

1608
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:11,000
basically expanding on the characters of the universe and making a gallery of other bounty hunters besides Samus.

1609
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:14,000
And why no new 2D cel-shaded Castlevania?

1610
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
I know a pipe dream, but still.

1611
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
All right.

1612
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Haseo Sumeruwagawa says, Mirrors Edge 2, my boyfriend and I are so excited,

1613
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:27,000
but I'm also excited for Kingdom Hearts 3 and Final Fantasy XIV and XV.

1614
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:33,000
Burr says, I'm a bit excited about what I saw of the new Sonic game, Lost World.

1615
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:38,000
I know I'm probably in for a letdown, but Sonic Generations was a bit of a surprise, so this could be too.

1616
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Mason D, I love this answer. This is so win.

1617
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:46,000
The thing most out of E3, Miyamoto likes In-N-Out Burger, confirmed,

1618
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:50,000
with the picture of Miyamoto at the In-N-Out truck that was in the parking lot at E3.

1619
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:54,000
I kept seeing that popping up all over Facebook. It was hilarious.

1620
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
That is great, though.

1621
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Ronnie B says, The Mirrors Edge reboot is all I care about.

1622
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:04,000
I think it's extremely impressive EA of all companies managed to seemingly keep everything in its original format.

1623
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:08,000
I hope they don't nickel and dime the game to death, though, otherwise it looks impressive like the first.

1624
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:12,000
I hope the music is equally respected. A lot of love for that new Mirrors Edge game.

1625
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
The trailer music was awesome.

1626
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Clover N says, The Metal Gear Solid V trailer looks absolutely amazing.

1627
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:23,000
I hope the controls, for the most part, don't stray too far from the controls of the past Metal Gear Solid games.

1628
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:27,000
That was a hell of a way to start off the Microsoft conference.

1629
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Say what you will about what went down there, but that was a great kickoff.

1630
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:39,000
Rageinator says, I was excited to hear about Killer Instinct, one of my favorite fighter series from back in the day, being brought back from the dead.

1631
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:45,000
I was also kind of hoping for some major E3 flubs that would become memes akin to Sony's 2006 presser.

1632
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Well, I think there were some. Nuclear subs, anybody?

1633
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:55,000
Matt J says, While I haven't read too much about it, I'm currently most excited for Deus Ex The Fall.

1634
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Haters can say what they want, but I think it's an interesting chapter in the Deus Ex game series.

1635
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:02,000
In case you don't know, Deus Ex The Fall is an iOS Android title.

1636
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:05,000
It's a sequel to the Deus Ex novel, Icarus Effect.

1637
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:08,000
A lot of folks are bitching because it's a mobile title, not a console or PC title.

1638
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:11,000
However, I find it looks interesting and potentially a fun game.

1639
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:18,000
I'm a die-hard Deus Ex fan and excited by the prospect of a mobile, on-the-go game, something not easily done with the other titles.

1640
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:22,000
I'm willing to at least give it a shot, unlike most folks who refuse to even acknowledge it.

1641
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:29,000
You know, a lot of people have a smartphone, and they might say they're not going to play it all they want, but then when it's like 99 cents, they're like, ooh, gimme.

1642
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:37,000
Tigerclaw says, I'm pretty excited about New Super Mario 3D World, Mario in a catsuit, but Princess Peach would look cuter in the catsuit in my opinion.

1643
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:45,000
She does look cute, but the keyword is cute, and not, like, oversexed, which I think is a good thing. Right, Jamie?

1644
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Yes, it's actually, it looks like those little pajamas.

1645
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,000
It's tasteful.

1646
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Yes it is, it's adorable too.

1647
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:56,000
By the way, I saw somebody at E3 in a Pikachu footy pajama thing, head to toe.

1648
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,000
Yeah.

1649
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:04,000
And I'm kinda like, alright dude, you go on with your bad self, but then I'm kinda like, why do people dress up for E3 like that?

1650
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,000
It's not the place for that.

1651
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:06,000
It's not the place for that.

1652
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
It's not Tokyo Game Show.

1653
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:09,000
No.

1654
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:10,000
Or actually it would be Comiket.

1655
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:11,000
And it's not PAX.

1656
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
But anyway, that's a whole nother episode.

1657
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:18,000
I'm also looking forward to Mario Kart 8. Too bad we'll have to wait to 2014 for those two.

1658
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:23,000
The new game on Mad Max would be interesting, even though there has already been a Mad Max game on the NES.

1659
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:28,000
This one being made by the developers of Just Cause. I remember the Mad Max game on the NES.

1660
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:31,000
That's, uh, boy oh boy.

1661
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Anyway, Gamer Girl says, mostly excited for, I know it's not PS4 exclusive, but Final Fantasy Realm Reborn, Lightning Returns, and the new Kingdom Hearts.

1662
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
I think you're a Square Enix fangirl.

1663
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Andy R. says, I listened to last week's OLR after Monday and hearing all the ragging on, well if Microsoft's doing it then Sony must be doing it too, was really amusing to me.

1664
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:54,000
Sorry Loki, I'll admit I chuckled at your cynicism a few times.

1665
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:57,000
Before the pressers I was worried too though, so I can't be too hard on you.

1666
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:00,000
That aside, I was rather impressed with Destiny.

1667
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:04,000
I don't care for MMOs or FPSs, but the gameplay shown looked really fun.

1668
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:09,000
And though we were all, although we all knew a new Smash Brothers was coming, I was pretty excited to buy the reveal.

1669
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:12,000
That and Bayonetta 2 might convince me to buy a Wii U.

1670
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:18,000
Shane replied, saying nothing but Final Fantasy XIV about 14 times, copy pasted.

1671
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
It's beautiful.

1672
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:24,000
And then Let's Have Tea, I always love that name, good to hear from you Let's Have Tea.

1673
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:30,000
Let's Have Tea says, your thoughts on the Xbox One family sharing feature and if you guys have even heard of it.

1674
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:35,000
It's probably the best feature of the Xbox One and a feature that Microsoft keeps seeming to forget to mention.

1675
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Now Let's Have Tea, as much as I love your name, I said no talking about the pressers.

1676
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:42,000
But yes, I do believe we did mention that earlier in the show, right Loki?

1677
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:43,000
Yeah.

1678
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:44,000
So, there you go.

1679
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:50,000
And yes, it does sound interesting, it's just that it's not worth the DRM trade off, that's my opinion.

1680
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:51,000
And I'm sticking to it.

1681
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:56,000
Those are your answers at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and Google Plus.

1682
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Search for Orange Lounge Radio.

1683
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
There you go.

1684
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
That's the FUGO Question of the Week.

1685
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:03,000
Some more news for you guys.

1686
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:07,000
Mailbag, FUs of the Week, Twitter, Skype, all coming up in a little bit.

1687
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Loki.

1688
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:09,000
Who reads the mail anyway?

1689
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:10,000
You do.

1690
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Get ready for it.

1691
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:12,000
Okay.

1692
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Alright, so Gearbox is facing a lawsuit, and now it's not over aliens, colonial marines, but it's Duke Nukem Forever.

1693
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:31,000
Apparently, Gearbox, of course, you know, after the resumed development of Duke Nukem Forever,

1694
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:45,000
kind of failed to give the, I guess, was it the payoff, a 2.9 million dollar loan that 3D Realms owed, I guess, to an unnamed company.

1695
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:56,000
And apparently also there are some royalties that were due as well, and they just haven't taken care of that yet.

1696
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:07,000
And apparently, according to the Gearbox VP of Marketing, Steve Gibson,

1697
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:16,000
the reality is Apogee and 3D Realms receive the full benefit of its bargain, Gearbox in fulfillment of its commitments.

1698
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:20,000
I don't know if you've fulfilled your commitments because the game is kind of crap, but whatever.

1699
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
I guess, finished game.

1700
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:30,000
EnRish 3DR saved 3DR from its debts and rescued 3DR from its litigation surrounding failed dozens.

1701
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:42,000
So I guess the way it sounds like that they think that because they kind of paid off their debts that they don't get any sort of kickback from Duke Nukem Forever.

1702
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:45,000
Although, I can't imagine it would be that big because I don't think it sold that well.

1703
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
But yeah, court case.

1704
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:56,000
It's always sad when they're fighting over a game that really wasn't worth fighting over in the end.

1705
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
But money's money, right?

1706
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:06,000
Well, I mean, it was really weird with Aliens, Clone-O, Marines, and 3D Realms and stuff,

1707
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:12,000
because I remember they were talking about misappropriation of money with Aliens, Clone-O, Marines, and going to Borderlands 2.

1708
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:21,000
I'm wondering if anything similar happened with the royalties for Duke Nukem Forever and going to Borderlands 2 as well.

1709
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Alright, well, Loki, I know you cared about this because you were asking some questions about it at E3.

1710
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:30,000
I didn't see it at E3, but I think Bobby got a quick look at it.

1711
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:34,000
It's Mad Catz's Android console. It's just called Mojo now.

1712
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:37,000
It's not Project Mojo or any of that anymore. It's called Mojo.

1713
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:44,000
And unlike Ouya or what have you, Mojo will run stock Android and connects to the Google Play Store, just like any other smartphone or tablet.

1714
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:50,000
So all you need for a game to be playable on Mojo is that it has to come out for Android.

1715
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:53,000
And you can tie the Mojo device to your Google Play account.

1716
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:59,000
So essentially, this is just literally an Android box for your TV. Literally.

1717
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:05,000
Yeah, and what's kind of cool about it, though, is it does support games that don't support controllers.

1718
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:13,000
So you can map your controls on the system. They also have emulation for touch controls using a mouse.

1719
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:21,000
You can plug in a mouse and keyboard, or you can just use the analog sticks to emulate touch controls as well.

1720
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:26,000
And then you can also map all your controls for whatever game on there.

1721
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
I mean, that's pretty awesome that you can do that.

1722
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:31,000
And on the show floor, it was running on a Tegra 3 processor.

1723
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:40,000
It had HDMI output at 1080p, two USB inputs, 16 gigs of onboard storage that you can expand with Mini SD, Bluetooth Classic, Bluetooth Smart.

1724
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:43,000
And they're saying, though, this is all subject to change.

1725
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Yeah, and I like how they have the two different Bluetooth protocols there, too, because right now they support the classic Bluetooth stuff.

1726
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:59,000
But they also have the new Bluetooth 4.0 stuff where it's going to drop the latency down to very little, and it's going to make it pretty good for gaming.

1727
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:07,000
And I'm wondering if they will increase or put a better processor in there, but Tegra 3 still, though, that means it's pretty cheap.

1728
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:14,000
It runs on Tegra 3, and that's going to be, you know, that's 100 bucks, so probably looking around that price range.

1729
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:21,000
And it's nice so that it supports Android apps, just generic Android apps, because, you know, probably a lot of people have that stuff.

1730
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:26,000
It's going to be a very interesting little counter to the Ouya. We'll see what happens.

1731
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:27,000
Yeah.

1732
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:28,000
Moving on.

1733
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Yes, we have some Nintendo news. Actually, something come, I can never pronounce his last name right, Reggie Fils-Aime, right?

1734
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:37,000
Yeah, Fils-Aime.

1735
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
That's exactly it, okay. Very French.

1736
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:48,000
He basically has gone on record saying that he has the key to limiting used game sales, and that's making better games.

1737
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:54,000
Making games that people are going to want to replay, making them, like, here's a quote from him.

1738
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:58,000
He says, the consumer wants to keep playing Mario Kart. The consumer wants to keep playing New Super Mario Brothers.

1739
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
They want to keep playing Pikmin.

1740
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:08,000
So we see that the trade-in frequency on Nintendo content is much less than the industry average, much, much less.

1741
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:12,000
And, you know, I have to look at it in terms of my own collection.

1742
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:18,000
We really do get, when we trade anything in, it's almost always something that was on the 360.

1743
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:25,000
Most of our PS3 games and our Wii games actually still have a lot of replayability. We still play our GameCube games.

1744
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:28,000
So, yeah, I actually really do agree.

1745
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:35,000
You know, you may be thinking that these are really simplistic games, but they do have high replayability value.

1746
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:42,000
Like, for example, out of your collection, Rob, what do you say that you've played the most of?

1747
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Out of all?

1748
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:47,000
What games do you always find yourself going back to play?

1749
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:48,000
MMOs.

1750
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:51,000
Well, okay. Besides MMOs. Those don't count.

1751
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Games with the solid multi-, things that I can play with my friends. I mean, that usually is MMOs.

1752
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:01,000
But, like, Mass Effect 3 was a good example because the multiplayer mode added a lot of life to that game.

1753
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
It did a whole lot with that one.

1754
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:09,000
But I think the thing, too, is that, like, okay, for example, any time that we have a party at my house, what happens?

1755
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
We bust out Rock Band.

1756
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:12,000
Good point, yeah.

1757
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
It's the big thing that has the replayability.

1758
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:20,000
It used to be back in the day we'd bust out Smash Brothers or Mario Party or Mario Kart.

1759
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
We'd bring out a racing game that we could four screen.

1760
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Something that, you know, you could kind of screw with your friends and not feel bad about it because it was cute.

1761
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:31,000
Solid multiplayer goes a long way in a game's life.

1762
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:36,000
And I'm not necessarily talking about just online, but, like, you know, having that old standby.

1763
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:40,000
What was the first thing, though, that everybody else was saying, though, when Animal Crossing came out?

1764
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Give me your friend code. I need your village code.

1765
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Yeah, right.

1766
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
I need a peach. Who's got a peach?

1767
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
Come over to shake your trees.

1768
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:56,000
I think the whole strength that Nintendo games have like this is that instead of just having your friends list, you're building a community around the IP.

1769
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:59,000
And I think that that also adds to their replayability.

1770
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:03,000
And, yeah, you do see a lot fewer Nintendo games traded in.

1771
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:07,000
The street passing on Animal Crossing is so smart, too, because I love looking at other people's homes.

1772
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
Yeah.

1773
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:13,000
I also, by the way, was enjoying the Sahara quotes.

1774
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
I can't wait till I get my coffee.

1775
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
All right.

1776
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
I love that, though.

1777
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Just make better games. You want people to stop selling them? Make them better.

1778
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
Well, and it's simple.

1779
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:27,000
I mean, I'll tell you this even.

1780
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:31,000
I go back and play SNES games all the time.

1781
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:35,000
I mean, we're all kind of in that boat where we're classic gamers, too.

1782
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:45,000
But I like to go back and play older games that I think are just still fun.

1783
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:48,000
I mean, we've even gone back and had Bomberman parties.

1784
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:51,000
I mean, who doesn't like a good game of Bomberman?

1785
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:56,000
It's a game that's pretty much lasted through the years.

1786
01:58:56,000 --> 01:59:00,000
It's solid. And that's what I think Nintendo's focusing on is making solid games.

1787
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
So, anyway.

1788
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:06,000
Queen Simia in our chat room is, I think, singing about Peaches, saying,

1789
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Really love your Peaches. Want to shake your tree?

1790
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:12,000
I can't help it. Suddenly I'm thinking of the Teaches of Peaches.

1791
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
It's a song.

1792
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
It's the lyric from a song.

1793
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:21,000
I know, but now I'm thinking of Peaches, the dirty, dirty musician from Canada who sings all the, you know.

1794
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:24,000
Or now I'm thinking of the presidents of the United States.

1795
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:27,000
What else is in the Teaches of Peaches?

1796
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:30,000
Oh, millions of Peaches.

1797
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:34,000
I don't know. You can't go wrong with the Joker, so.

1798
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:37,000
All right, save us from the Peach talk, Logie.

1799
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
Really? We have to do that? No.

1800
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:40,000
Okay.

1801
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
We can talk Princess Peach.

1802
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
Okay.

1803
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:50,000
So, one of the theories, and definitely a theory I had, you know, with a whole, you know, a lot of people suspected,

1804
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:59,000
EA getting rid of their online pass just before the announcement of the Xbox One and its features.

1805
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:10,000
EA, though, saying that, hey, even though PlayStation 4 came out and revealed that they're not going to be kind of following suit with the Xbox One,

1806
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:14,000
they are still not going to bring back the online pass.

1807
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:20,000
And also set, you know, of course reaffirmed that, you know, getting rid of the online pass was not because of the Xbox One.

1808
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
They say that it just wasn't working out for them.

1809
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
And I don't know the belief from it.

1810
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:28,000
I kind of, on one hand, want to just say, I don't buy it.

1811
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:32,000
Because I think that they were kind of banking on both systems doing that.

1812
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:37,000
But at the same time, maybe they have figured out that they're just making a lot more money from DLC.

1813
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:43,000
And instead of making it harder for people to, you know, or less desirable for people to buy their games, you know,

1814
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:48,000
whether it be buying it new or buying used and have them pay an online pass,

1815
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:53,000
just make it easier for people to buy games and then just have a ton of DLC.

1816
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:59,000
You know, I don't know if necessarily nickelene and diamond, but they've attempted to do that with, you know, like Dead Space 3 and stuff.

1817
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:02,000
So maybe that's where they're kind of seeing it.

1818
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:07,000
And I think that kind of makes sense also with the Xbox One and their game sharing,

1819
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
is that's where they're probably going to try to make a lot of their money,

1820
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:14,000
is since you're not buying copies of the games and you're going to get a lot less sales now because of that,

1821
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:17,000
that DLC is going to be more profitable.

1822
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:21,000
I know you all love it when we keep bringing this game up, but Mass Effect 3 really did it great.

1823
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:28,000
I mean, there's not just the free DLC, but, you know, then there's the, all the story DLC was so good, you know.

1824
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
Well, especially with the big apology.

1825
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:36,000
To be fair, it was probably better in Mass Effect 2 overall, but I mean, still a good example of DLC done right.

1826
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:42,000
None of it flat out sucked. You can't sit there and go to the DLC. Well, maybe like the armor packs.

1827
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
There were things that you could complain about later.

1828
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:45,000
Yeah.

1829
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:50,000
Like, really? Is that what happens in Omega? I'm sorry, did I mention a particular one? Sorry.

1830
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:56,000
Although I did completely find the Citadel DLC absolutely hilarious. Just saying.

1831
02:01:56,000 --> 02:02:05,000
And then, of course, they're saying that now they're working on this gamer first use game policy for next gen.

1832
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:13,000
Basically, I don't know what exactly that means. Gamers first and customer first.

1833
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:19,000
Does that mean that there are going to be no restrictions at all, or are they going to try something else?

1834
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:34,000
I don't know. I'm guessing that it's not this idea. Although, I think it's made it, you know, definitely the response to the Xbox One DRM and, you know, limiting use game sales and online passings.

1835
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:43,000
I definitely think that publishers are aware of the perception of that, and I think they will maybe think twice about implementing that in the future.

1836
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:54,000
Especially if Sony's not doing it anymore, and EA's not doing it anymore, who's really left? Warner Games and Ubisoft. That's it.

1837
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:59,000
Ubisoft has their whole little tie-in service to Uplay. They can invest in that.

1838
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:03,000
It's still, though, they have, that could still be free, but right now they're still passing.

1839
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:10,000
THQs can't do it anymore because they're out of business, and Deep Silver is not continuing with that, I think. I'm pretty sure they're not, because they didn't with Metro.

1840
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:14,000
So, it's kind of on its way out already.

1841
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Alright, before we get to the next story, a very interesting breaking news that a lot of our chatters are talking about is a tweet that just showed up from Bobby.

1842
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:33,000
My house just got struck by lightning. That's why he disappeared from chat. Most of my electronics are fried. I'm fine.

1843
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:34,000
Holy crap.

1844
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:43,000
But Bobby seems like the type that would have had a surge protector on everything. He was telling me to get the power source for the computer when all that stuff went down with one of the live shows.

1845
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:47,000
But a surge protector isn't a cure-all, trust me.

1846
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
Well, I hope everything's okay. I hope when he's...

1847
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
I've had a hard drive melted that was hooked to a surge protector.

1848
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:59,000
Yeah, I'm hoping when he says fried that he means like they're just, you know, all they need is a quick little fix or something, but that's...

1849
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:04,000
Seeing that Bobby does a lot with electronics, especially the VOG, that's a big deal.

1850
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:07,000
Well, just stay in touch with us and let us know what we need to do if he can hear.

1851
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:11,000
What's up with lightning and taking out people that do like tech blog stuff?

1852
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
Because usually they're connected.

1853
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:16,000
Ours Technica, you know, the guy actually got hit by lightning.

1854
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:19,000
Because they can't stop cranking out lightning video games.

1855
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:25,000
Well, when I was living with my ex-remate, and this is, you know, back in the days of dial-up,

1856
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:36,000
but we still had a surge protector on both the power supply and on the cable, the internet cable,

1857
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:44,000
and still with a direct shot from lightning to her antenna, we fried her hard drive. And the modem.

1858
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:47,000
It's really good that he didn't have, you know, an Xbox One connected at this time,

1859
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:51,000
because literally a lightning strike would turn it into a killing death machine.

1860
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:55,000
So, you know, it's a good thing that we're still months away.

1861
02:04:55,000 --> 02:05:01,000
Well, I hope everything's alright, because I know his day job relies on electronics and all that.

1862
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:05,000
Yeah, I agree with VX JasonXV who said hopefully you just meant that figuratively.

1863
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:09,000
Yeah, I hope so too. I hope so too. We'll find out soon.

1864
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:15,000
Moving on, let me get back to the gaming news we had on deck tonight.

1865
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:22,000
Nintendo could be releasing a free-to-play game. I know. It would be within the fiscal year,

1866
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:28,000
which would end on March 2014. It was during an analyst briefing at E3 that this was announced.

1867
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:32,000
So this is something that's actually happening. It's not a Mario game, it's not a Pokemon game.

1868
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:36,000
But it could be an already existing franchise to a brand new IP.

1869
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:41,000
Now, Destructoid had an interesting theory that it could be an Advance Wars game,

1870
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:46,000
because that would seem to fit in very well. I mean, it makes a lot of sense for what could show up on the Wii U,

1871
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:49,000
and would work with the free-to-play model generally well.

1872
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Even though a lot of people associate free-to-play with shit games, there's some free-to-play games that are pretty cool.

1873
02:05:56,000 --> 02:06:00,000
What about, like, if it's an MMO, they could be Dragon Quest X?

1874
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:05,000
No, because that would involve Square Enix. This is a Nintendo thing.

1875
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
Nintendo would not have announced a Square Enix game like that.

1876
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
They could be publishing it over here.

1877
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:12,000
I love your thought, but no. Just no.

1878
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:20,000
I would love to be wrong about that. I would love to, but I kind of doubt it.

1879
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:25,000
Alright, let's get to the mailbag. I don't doubt that you guys send us emails every week.

1880
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

1881
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
And we answer the emails here on the program.

1882
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:32,000
Yeah, yeah.

1883
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:35,000
I'm sure it's been filling up a little bit after E3.

1884
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:36,000
Well, we have four.

1885
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:36,500
Okay.

1886
02:06:36,500 --> 02:06:38,000
Four legit. Four legit.

1887
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
The first one comes from Robert M.

1888
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:45,000
Right now, MCPE is my only Minecraft.

1889
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
Excuse me, not counting the Lego set.

1890
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:51,000
Because it's much more convenient for me during commuting and breaks.

1891
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:58,000
Unfortunately, Realms won't be of much use to me at home, since the app freezes when I open it connected to my home Wi-Fi.

1892
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:05,000
This does not seem to affect other apps, and I can't access local multiplayer with no issue on other Wi-Fi.

1893
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:07,000
Sorry.

1894
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:11,000
I don't expect anyone to be able to tech support on this, just odd.

1895
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:17,000
Setting fireplace in log cabin with Neather, rack flame, poor outcome.

1896
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
That says haiku.

1897
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
No. Cute.

1898
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:22,000
Yeah.

1899
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:23,000
So yeah.

1900
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:27,000
Well, I'm not sure why the issue is with your local Wi-Fi.

1901
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:38,000
Although, oddly enough, there's certain apps that I have that require a connection that won't necessarily work on my Wi-Fi, but they'll work on the 3G and they'll work elsewhere.

1902
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:43,000
Maybe the problem is related to why the station keeps fucking dropping while we're trying to do a show.

1903
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
Maybe we have the same provider. I don't know.

1904
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
Howdy sentient creatures.

1905
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:52,000
After listening to episode 507, I have two thoughts.

1906
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
First of all, a haiku.

1907
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:57,000
I was right, but I didn't want to be right.

1908
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
Damn, The Last Guardian.

1909
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:02,000
Second, I have a holiday-style greeting for E3.

1910
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:05,000
Happy hyperbolic statement period.

1911
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
Stay black, redertainment trainer.

1912
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:10,000
Alright.

1913
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
Sometimes it's painful to be right.

1914
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:16,000
This is from Sam.

1915
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
And the message is, happy E3, OLR crew.

1916
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:25,000
One game I failed to see from Ubisoft this E3 is Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Patriots.

1917
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:29,000
Do you think the game has been renamed and re-revealed as Tom Clancy's The Division?

1918
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:31,000
I wouldn't think-

1919
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:32,000
No, no.

1920
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:35,000
Do you think Ubisoft has more than one team on Tom Clancy games?

1921
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:36,000
Yeah, I think so.

1922
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:37,000
Well, yeah, they definitely do.

1923
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:38,000
I wouldn't be surprised.

1924
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:41,000
I don't think- no, it's not even- doesn't even look similar at all.

1925
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:44,000
It's probably just something- they have Blacklist coming out now.

1926
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:49,000
I think it's probably being made now for next gen, and so it's just, you know-

1927
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:50,000
Bump back a little bit.

1928
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:51,000
Yeah, I think so.

1929
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:52,000
Fair enough.

1930
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:55,000
Sorry, I was answering your question.

1931
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:56,000
I'm with Loki.

1932
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:57,000
It could be quarter four next year.

1933
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
That makes sense, I think.

1934
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
So I was answering your question in chat.

1935
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:05,000
I happened to mention that my ex-roommate from college got struck by lightning.

1936
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
Came in smelling that buzzy smell.

1937
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:09,000
Ew.

1938
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:10,000
With her hair sticking up.

1939
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:11,000
Ew.

1940
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:12,000
And she just said,

1941
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
I got struck by lightning.

1942
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
And I was like, Meglet, are you okay?

1943
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:17,000
Her name was Meg, we called her Meglet.

1944
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
I was like, are you okay?

1945
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
Yeah, I'm gonna lay down.

1946
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
And she didn't get up the rest of the day.

1947
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:24,000
I kept checking on her.

1948
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
She got up and she was just fine.

1949
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:30,000
You have a lot of weird stories.

1950
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:33,000
And then she said it was the second time in her life she'd been struck by lightning.

1951
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
Go buy a lottery ticket, Meglet.

1952
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:36,000
Seriously.

1953
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
I just asked Bobby if it took out the fence.

1954
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:42,000
You're such an asshole.

1955
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:45,000
He probably lost some of his computers and stuff.

1956
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
You're like, did I hit the fence?

1957
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:48,000
Bobby, I'm sorry for laughing.

1958
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
It makes me a horrible human being.

1959
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
I've been in your place.

1960
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:55,000
His kitties were at the boarding thing.

1961
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
He can't pick them up until Monday.

1962
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
So the cats aren't affected, just so you guys know.

1963
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:00,000
That's important.

1964
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:01,000
Yay for the kitties.

1965
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
Think of the kitties.

1966
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:04,000
Last email, Rob.

1967
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
And this one is a poem.

1968
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
Written by Degenerate Johnny.

1969
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
Shall I read it?

1970
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:11,000
Yes.

1971
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
Once again, E3 has lived up to its name.

1972
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
The event has proven it's still relevant.

1973
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:18,000
Gamers rejoiced at the sight of upcoming titles.

1974
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:22,000
And judging from the drool puddles, E3 is also salivant.

1975
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:26,000
Microsoft promises a year of excitement.

1976
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
One full of fun features and games.

1977
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
Unfortunately, some of them seem to be disappointing.

1978
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:33,000
Especially the ones that suffer drops in sound and frames.

1979
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:36,000
Indeed, Microsoft did not address the hard issues.

1980
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
It seems this year they're rolling the dice.

1981
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:43,000
Without explanation of online benefits, $500 is too steep of a price.

1982
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
Sony's conference was impressive.

1983
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
It was full of exciting announcements and games.

1984
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:50,000
With the announcement of no restrictions on used titles.

1985
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:53,000
It almost made up for Sony's previous shames.

1986
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:56,000
Indeed, Jack Tretton was on Cloud 9.

1987
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
You can see it on his face.

1988
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
The chanting of Sony's name was most telling.

1989
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:03,000
The PS4 will start ahead in the console race.

1990
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
It's like generation 6 all over again.

1991
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
Sony will come out on top real fast.

1992
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:10,000
Wii U started with no games just like the GameCube.

1993
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
But will X-Bone go the way of the Dreamcast?

1994
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:16,000
The excitement and energy never stops at E3.

1995
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
It's an event full of comedy and tragedy.

1996
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:21,000
All I can say is that I can't wait for this holiday season.

1997
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:25,000
And I'm sure the same can be said for the O.L. Army.

1998
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:29,000
Wishing a tubular E3 to all gamers and fathers.

1999
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
Degenerate Johnny.

2000
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
I think I cried a little.

2001
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:36,000
That was a very clever little poem.

2002
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:37,000
Thank you.

2003
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:38,000
Good job.

2004
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
It should be posted on our forums.

2005
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:43,000
So there's an update from Bobby.

2006
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
I know this is not gaming news.

2007
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:48,000
But obviously we care about Bobby and want him to be alright.

2008
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:52,000
As of right now, it looks like I lost all my routers and switches.

2009
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:56,000
My audio receiver, my 360, and my Wii U.

2010
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
Ooh.

2011
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
Wow.

2012
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:03,000
Are Acts of God under warranty?

2013
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
I don't know.

2014
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
Hopefully he's got insurance or something.

2015
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
There's got to be a homeowner's insurance.

2016
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:16,000
Yeah, most homeowner's insurance will have some type of personal property.

2017
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:17,000
Christ.

2018
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:18,000
If it's not just dwelling.

2019
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:24,000
If not for some reason, anyone from Microsoft or Nintendo listening that can help them out?

2020
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
One thing I can tell you is that...

2021
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:30,000
Oh, God, I wonder if that was his special 360.

2022
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:34,000
I don't want to say too much, but he had a very special 360.

2023
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
I hope that wasn't it.

2024
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:41,000
I can tell you that most insurances in the South, as far as I'm aware,

2025
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:44,000
definitely have some sort of hard weather coverage.

2026
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
It's required, so...

2027
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:50,000
VXJ's next V says Acts of God are explicitly not covered by warranty.

2028
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:54,000
I would still hope, though, that there would be some type of...

2029
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
I think homeowner's insurance would cover something like that.

2030
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
Homeowner's insurance or something, yeah.

2031
02:12:58,000 --> 02:12:59,000
Lordy.

2032
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
Yeah.

2033
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:02,000
Alrighty.

2034
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
I've been in that position. I feel that pain.

2035
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:08,000
People underestimate the weather, especially back east.

2036
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
Right?

2037
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
Alright, is that it for the mailbag?

2038
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:13,000
Yes, it is.

2039
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:17,000
Alright, mailbag at orangelandtrader.com.

2040
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:20,000
Another reason I keep reporting on what's going on with Bobby,

2041
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:23,000
he may not be back to do a show next week.

2042
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:26,000
Not confirmed yet. Just let him make that announcement.

2043
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:29,000
Watch his Twitter, because clearly his cell phone still works.

2044
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:32,000
Bobby will be calling us and doing it on Skype.

2045
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:35,000
He's more than welcome to. We'll be here.

2046
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:40,000
Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week.

2047
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:41,000
How appropriate.

2048
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:42,000
Absolutely timed.

2049
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
Well then, first off...

2050
02:13:44,000 --> 02:14:02,000
First off, I think an FU from all of us to Lightning.

2051
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:07,000
I would like to go ahead though and give, especially Brad in the chat room,

2052
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
but people have already been bringing it up.

2053
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Already thinking of ways to help Bobby replace his stuff.

2054
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:15,000
We seriously have the best listeners in the universe.

2055
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:16,000
We do. You know what?

2056
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
And actually this is one of the things Bobby and I were talking about,

2057
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
is that, you know, at the Voice Geek Network,

2058
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
we don't have the biggest audience.

2059
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:27,000
And that's okay, because I seriously think we have the most loyal audience.

2060
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:28,000
We do.

2061
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:31,000
And we are so fortunate to have that. You guys are amazing.

2062
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:35,000
We have people listening to us that not just give of their time to listen,

2063
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
they give of themselves.

2064
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:40,000
And we'd like to give back to you as much as we can.

2065
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:49,000
It's like, I don't need 10,000 listeners if we have 100 awesome, loyal listeners.

2066
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
You know what I mean? Like, it means so much more.

2067
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:54,000
And how many of our listeners are we actually, like, totally good friends with now?

2068
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:55,000
Yeah, I know.

2069
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:58,000
I probably don't need five 360s either.

2070
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
You probably don't, sir.

2071
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
I could probably lend him or give him one.

2072
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
Well, we'll see. Hopefully he's got insurance. We'll find out.

2073
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:05,000
He's probably trying...

2074
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
I have banned ones. That doesn't do you any well.

2075
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:10,000
He's probably trying to process a lot right now, so let's give him a little space,

2076
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:13,000
and then I'm sure he'll be able to clear up what's up.

2077
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:16,000
I can lend him an NES. No.

2078
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:22,000
But yeah, my FU for today goes towards people who drive like assholes.

2079
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:27,000
And I'm not just talking about, you know, speeding a little bit here or not signaling.

2080
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:34,000
I'm talking about the BMW driver that I saw cut off a Lexus just because the Lexus had managed to get...

2081
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:39,000
They closed off one lane where they're doing that construction back on Eastern.

2082
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:47,000
And so the Lexus just happened to pull ahead of where the BMW had tried to get up in the front

2083
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:50,000
and cut that person off, but the Lexus was just a better driver.

2084
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:58,000
And so the BMW driver swerves around and cuts off the BMW driver as soon as there's two lanes again.

2085
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:02,000
And I swear that was almost a Miranda.

2086
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:08,000
Yeah, Mako drivers. Fuck them. No. That would be me. I drive the Mako horribly.

2087
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:15,000
And then I think that I've got a sore throat.

2088
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:19,000
And FU to not having a job. I need one of those.

2089
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:24,000
Everybody that I've ever sent applications to, hire me, because I'm a really good person.

2090
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
I will work hard for you.

2091
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:29,000
That, and I'm really good with InDesign.

2092
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
Loki?

2093
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:40,000
Fuck you to FPSbox.com, our previous host of the Minecraft server for the VoG network.

2094
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:48,000
And basically, I guess it got sold off or something happened, and basically the website's running in autopilot.

2095
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:51,000
So when the servers go down, nobody answers support.

2096
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:56,000
There's no phone anymore. There's no email. Nobody cares.

2097
02:16:56,000 --> 02:17:01,000
And so actually, taking a look at some of the servers that are online, most of them are down right now.

2098
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:07,000
And what sucks is the FTP portion of it's down as well, so I can't, I have backups of the server.

2099
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:12,000
I can make backups, but I can't access any of them, because they're on the FTP server.

2100
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:15,000
And there's something, it's something with the authentication.

2101
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:18,000
It keeps saying that I have the wrong password, even though I don't.

2102
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:25,000
And it doesn't matter, so you can't reset it either, because the reset password thing's broken, so.

2103
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:29,000
Yeah, I'll just have to start anew if we're actually gonna do it.

2104
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:32,000
And who knows, we haven't been getting a lot of people on there anyways.

2105
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:35,000
Might as well just save myself ten bucks a month.

2106
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:41,000
I may change my mind. There's other hosts out there that'll actually let me upload my own JAR files,

2107
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:47,000
which I wanted to do in the first place, so that we could have cool things like airplanes and cars and guns.

2108
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
I totally want a gun.

2109
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:51,000
They have Mass Effect guns too.

2110
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:57,000
You know what, I totally just redid my little sprite to look like my Minecraft person to look like Shepard.

2111
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:03,000
Alright, I'm just gonna give an F.U. to traffic as well, because some bitch cut me off today on the freeway,

2112
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,000
and it's like, when you're going 80 miles an hour, don't be cutting people off.

2113
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:06,000
Did she drive a BMW?

2114
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:09,000
No, but I did see a couple asshole BMW drivers.

2115
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:12,000
I'm not saying that all BMW drivers are assholes, but I'm just saying, I see a lot of them.

2116
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:16,000
I'm starting to agree with Jeremy Clarkson, by the way. BMW drivers.

2117
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
Otherwise, I had a pretty good week, I can't complain.

2118
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
Although, Matt is a good BMW driver.

2119
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:25,000
F.U. to Disneyland for me missing it so much.

2120
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
F.U. to awkward moments.

2121
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:29,000
Awkward?

2122
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:33,000
I'll say that too. Oh yeah, very awkward moment, I'll have to tell you off air, it's not appropriate for on air.

2123
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:34,000
There's nothing to do with the show.

2124
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:37,000
Well, how about also F.U.'s to elusive ties?

2125
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:45,000
Alright, let's move on with a couple more stories, and then we'll get to Skypline.

2126
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:55,000
Alright, so the new thing for Xbox One, of course, they're talking about their system for achievements and stuff.

2127
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:56,000
It's going to be a little bit different.

2128
02:18:56,000 --> 02:19:01,000
Which, by the way, I gotta add, this is one thing we didn't talk about at the press conference.

2129
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:07,000
They have the day one edition that gives you DLC that is an achievement.

2130
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:09,000
So that's kind of lame.

2131
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:15,000
I'm sure it's just stupid, like, you know, we were, you know, we bought it day one type thing.

2132
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,000
But that's still lame.

2133
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:22,000
But anyways, so the challenges, I guess they're saying that it's going to be a little bit different than achievements.

2134
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:23,000
It's alongside it.

2135
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:31,000
It may not necessarily be, it may be like time limited, so you may have a certain amount of time to do a certain challenge in a game.

2136
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
It may actually be tied to multiple games.

2137
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:41,000
It could be tied to some community based thing, like, you know, playing X amount of hours of Halo or something like that during lunch.

2138
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:45,000
Remember they did something like that, I think with Halo 4, it gave you some discounts and stuff.

2139
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:49,000
And everybody that participated got some stuff.

2140
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:52,000
I want to say, I think it was Halo, maybe Halo Reach.

2141
02:19:53,000 --> 02:20:06,000
And then they're saying that also Xbox One video and music apps can also use achievements to reward people that would seek peak content to early access or subscription extensions.

2142
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
So it's interesting that they're going to be doing all that stuff.

2143
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:14,000
It sounds interesting that they're kind of revamping their achievement system.

2144
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:19,000
I didn't think they would change what wasn't super broken.

2145
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:28,000
I knew there were a few things here and there that they were talking about, like the whole achievements that they could build on the fly as memes come out for the game and so forth.

2146
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:34,000
Doesn't Nintendo call them challenges, by the way, on StreetPass?

2147
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:35,000
I don't know.

2148
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:37,000
Just curious.

2149
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:44,000
Alright, before we get to your calls tonight, one more story tonight, and it's to kind of put the wrap on all the E3 stories tonight.

2150
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:51,000
E3 this year, 48,200 attendees. That's an increase of 2,500 from the prior year.

2151
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
Bite my tongue, bite my tongue, bite my tongue.

2152
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:58,000
Forty million dollars in revenue brought to the city of Los Angeles from that.

2153
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:03,000
Next year's E3, June 10th through the 12th, also at the LA Convention Center.

2154
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:11,000
But what will be interesting about next year's show, this isn't in the news story, but if you've been paying attention, there will be no more West Hall.

2155
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:14,000
That's what they're tearing down to make Farmer's Field.

2156
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:19,000
So it will be interesting to see, which is the football stadium for the football team that LA doesn't have yet.

2157
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:20,000
Hello, Kensha Hall.

2158
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:24,000
I don't know. Yeah, does that mean Kensha Hall is used next year?

2159
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:31,000
Or the rumor is they're going to build, well it's not a rumor, but they're going to build an expansion on the other side of the street.

2160
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:34,000
But when will that be done is anyone's guess.

2161
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
Buy my Ouya parking lot.

2162
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
Who knows, who knows. But there you go.

2163
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:43,000
There was a question I didn't get to ask about E3 this year.

2164
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:44,000
Sure.

2165
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
Is if they were still handing out balls.

2166
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:49,000
Like they did every year.

2167
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:54,000
Because that used to be the only time I would ever get balls.

2168
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:56,000
So, just saying.

2169
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:01,000
And Bobby says his podcast gear is fine.

2170
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:02,000
Yay!

2171
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:03,000
So he should be there.

2172
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:04,000
Huzzah!

2173
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:08,000
The audio receiver is for my surround sound, so it sounds like his living room got fucked up most of all.

2174
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:09,000
That's what it sounds like.

2175
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:12,000
He could probably have my audio receiver too because I don't use that either.

2176
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:16,000
Everybody's all nice around. I just got to say, you guys rule.

2177
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:26,000
I have like a surround sound system that we don't use anymore because Josh is asleep when we watch TV and so we don't need a blast surround sound anymore.

2178
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:31,000
Alright, I haven't even given out the damn number and already the Skype line lighting up.

2179
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:37,000
1877 Game O-L-R, or user name on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, but you'll have to wait for this guy.

2180
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:39,000
Who's on the line here?

2181
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:40,000
You're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

2182
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:42,000
OrangeLoungeRadio?

2183
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
I thought I was calling Best Buy to pre-order my PlayStation 4.

2184
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
Sure, just give me your credit card number.

2185
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:51,000
I don't think so, Tim.

2186
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:53,000
What's up, buddy?

2187
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
Not too much, not too much.

2188
02:22:56,000 --> 02:23:02,000
I just want to say that I have to thank Sony.

2189
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:08,000
I mean, their presser made me feel like what it was like to be an actual gamer.

2190
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:10,000
That's how it hit home for me.

2191
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:14,000
You know, there was a very interesting comment left on the VoG network.

2192
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:18,000
I think it was Flaco Jones who said it on last week's show at VoGnetwork.com.

2193
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:21,000
He said last week's show was kind of Doom and Gloom.

2194
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:22,000
What was that?

2195
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:23,000
Macabre?

2196
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:24,000
He said it was very...

2197
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:25,000
Morbid?

2198
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:26,000
Morbid kind of episode.

2199
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:30,000
Because, yeah, we were playing the funeral march to the Xbox stuff and all that.

2200
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:34,000
I was sitting here going, this is a sad fucking day to be a gamer.

2201
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:38,000
But at the Sony press conference when they hit bullet after bullet after bullet, it was like...

2202
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:42,000
Celebrate good times, come on.

2203
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:46,000
If everyone was on board with the Xbox One stuff,

2204
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:49,000
then I wasn't really that excited about the next gen.

2205
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
I was like, okay, what am I going to do now?

2206
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:55,000
And now that they came out with that, I was like, cool, I can be excited about these games now.

2207
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:58,000
Very much so.

2208
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:01,000
I mean, I was so excited after seeing the Kingdom Hearts 3 trailer.

2209
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:04,000
I'm playing through Kingdom Hearts 1 right now.

2210
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:10,000
Is the internet as a whole being too fanboy with this?

2211
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:16,000
Are we being too blinded by Sony's tackling of Microsoft?

2212
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:19,000
Are we not seeing the big picture here?

2213
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:23,000
Are we refusing to acknowledge that Microsoft may actually have some good ideas?

2214
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:26,000
That maybe Sony doesn't have the good exclusives?

2215
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:27,000
What do you think?

2216
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
Do you think we are being too fanboy?

2217
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
Yes and no.

2218
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:38,000
Coming from the cosplay fandom, anime fandom, I'll say this much.

2219
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:47,000
You take something away, the fans will never forgive you no matter how well you fix it.

2220
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:50,000
If Microsoft say that, oh, we're not going to do the DRM thing.

2221
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:54,000
The fans will still look at Microsoft and be like, it doesn't matter.

2222
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:57,000
You gone and done fucked up.

2223
02:24:57,000 --> 02:25:05,000
It's no different from when the anime companies were jumping on the whole streaming and shutting down the fan suburbs.

2224
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:08,000
We're like, we're good companies. We're giving you the stuff that you want.

2225
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:13,000
But then the fans are like, you shut down my favorite fan suburbs. Why should I buy from you?

2226
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:20,000
I think just a more direct comparison would be Sony really fucked up in 2006 and now they're back.

2227
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:23,000
It's not even necessarily just now they're back.

2228
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:27,000
They slowly were getting their groove back over the past few years.

2229
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:32,000
But I think Microsoft made some really bad personnel decisions in the past few years and it's starting to show.

2230
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:33,000
Sorry about it.

2231
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:38,000
And you're absolutely right. I'm looking at the breakdown of the consoles.

2232
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:44,000
I read the article how the cost of the PS4 is about $325.

2233
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:51,000
If the PS4 and Xbox One are similar in hardware and if that's the case,

2234
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:57,000
then you're actually paying an extra hundred bucks for Kinect, something that somebody may not even want.

2235
02:25:57,000 --> 02:26:03,000
I think that's one of Microsoft's huge mistakes is clinging to that Kinect.

2236
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:08,000
And I think that's one of the two big, big mistakes they made.

2237
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:12,000
And to point out, I've actually gone on record saying that I don't want to Kinect.

2238
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:19,000
I mean, I wanted to Kinect at first because I wanted to do Para Para games, but it doesn't really mean anything to me anymore.

2239
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:20,000
I don't care.

2240
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:29,000
Exactly. And I was saying to people when Xbox One, everyone was talking about the designs, I'm like, what are you talking about?

2241
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:33,000
I've had an Xbox One sitting in my living room for about a year and a half.

2242
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:38,000
It's called the Verizon Files DVR box. They look exactly the same.

2243
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:41,000
All right, Rama, anything else before we let you go?

2244
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:44,000
Yeah, for Ucchan.

2245
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:45,000
Ooh, what?

2246
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:49,000
Well, I know you miss your Coke Black, but I want to try to ship this out to you.

2247
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:56,000
Here in New York, they have what's called Manhattan Special. It's cola and espresso as a soft drink.

2248
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
I need this in my life.

2249
02:26:58,000 --> 02:26:59,000
So good.

2250
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:00,000
I need this in my life.

2251
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
Rama, I'm going to let you go. Take care, buddy.

2252
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:03,000
All right, you too, bro.

2253
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:04,000
All right, bye.

2254
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:05,000
Bye.

2255
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:10,000
1877 game OLR. Our user's name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, but let's go to the phones.

2256
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2257
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:13,000
Hey, it's Bobby.

2258
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
Hey, Bobby. How you doing?

2259
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:16,000
Hi, Bobby.

2260
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:17,000
Little shook up.

2261
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:18,000
Little shook up.

2262
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:21,000
Yeah, okay, what happened?

2263
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:27,000
I'm sitting there listening to OLR, and I hear a huge, really loud clap over my head.

2264
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:35,000
And all my lights flicker, and I'm like, okay, that was close.

2265
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:41,000
And then I notice that my brand new Netgear router is not on anymore.

2266
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:46,000
And then I look over to my right, and my brand new Netgear 8-port switch is not on anymore.

2267
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:52,000
And then I go upstairs, and my brand new Netgear 8-port switch that's upstairs is not on anymore.

2268
02:27:52,000 --> 02:28:01,000
And then I start looking around, and I try to, you know, assume the worst, and I try to turn on my TV and my receiver.

2269
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:07,000
The TV comes on, but it's at the setup screen, and my audio receiver doesn't come on at all.

2270
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:11,000
The red light on my Wii U is no longer on.

2271
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
The PS3's red light was on.

2272
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:16,000
The 360 didn't turn on when I pressed it.

2273
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:24,000
And, let's see, I've come upstairs, my old 32-inch Trinitron TV for my retro games, that doesn't work anymore.

2274
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
And the PS2 up here is dead.

2275
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:34,000
Well, I guess the first question I asked, do you have homeowners insurance or something that will hopefully replace some of this?

2276
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:39,000
I absolutely do. I haven't pulled it out to see if it covers this, but I'm sure it does.

2277
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:46,000
You might check also with the 360 and the Wii U, maybe just the replacement power supply might be all it needs for that.

2278
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:47,000
Yeah.

2279
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:53,000
And I think that we've actually got spares for those, because we've inherited dead systems from Dan's days at GameCrazy.

2280
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:58,000
Well, and that just goes to show, Bobby, within literally two minutes of your tweet going up,

2281
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:04,000
everybody in the VOG Network chat room was like, let's take up a collection, let's donate, let's send,

2282
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:09,000
I've got an extra 360, I can send him if he needs it. I think it goes a long way.

2283
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:13,000
And I was mentioning to the live listeners, I know you didn't hear this, because lightning,

2284
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:19,000
it's one of the things you and I were talking about in the car when we were driving to Anaheim the other night,

2285
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:25,000
was that we may not have the biggest audience here at the Voice of the East Network, but we have the most loyal.

2286
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:28,000
And we are so fucking thankful for that. You guys are amazing.

2287
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:29,000
Yeah.

2288
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:36,000
But my computers are fine, they stayed up, my two monitors, I even checked my old classic box, it came right back up.

2289
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:43,000
So it seems like it hits certain floors of your house more than others, because it's probably a circuit.

2290
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:44,000
Yeah.

2291
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:50,000
Yeah, well, I mean, it hit, I mean, because the router, but my router is down next to my computer.

2292
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:56,000
And so it hits some things. Everything's on surge protectors, but this was, you know, they don't protect every surge,

2293
02:29:56,000 --> 02:30:03,000
and this one must have been pretty direct. And, but yeah, it kind of hit different things, like my GameCube still works,

2294
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
and it's sitting right next to my PS2.

2295
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
Well.

2296
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:12,000
But that TV doesn't work too well anymore, so I think something inside the TV got fried.

2297
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:19,000
Take some time to process, call the insurance company on Monday, see what, you know, steps you have to take.

2298
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:25,000
And if there's anything you need, you know you've got the three of us, you've got 61 people in chat right now,

2299
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:29,000
and I know every single one of them is willing to help, and then add on to that the podcast listeners,

2300
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:34,000
the other folks at VoGnetwork.com. We'll get you through this.

2301
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:35,000
Yeah.

2302
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
It just sucks. It sucks.

2303
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:40,000
Yeah, I've spent a lot of money this past week.

2304
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:44,000
Yeah, he did. He did, folks. Disneyland ain't cheap, you guys.

2305
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:50,000
But, most important, you're okay. The cats were still in kitty daycare due to your trip.

2306
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:54,000
They don't open again until Monday, so your cats are okay, and you're okay.

2307
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:55,000
Yep.

2308
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:57,000
Most important, everything else is just stuff.

2309
02:30:57,000 --> 02:31:00,000
Weren't we saying that Nintendo goes last?

2310
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:03,000
I haven't checked on my classic consoles yet, so.

2311
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:06,000
It's just stuff. It's just stuff.

2312
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:07,000
Yeah.

2313
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:09,000
Well, I'm sure I've got spare Nintendos if you need one.

2314
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:13,000
I know, I know. Well, everybody's here willing to help, Bobby.

2315
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:17,000
Otherwise, anything else you want to say, turning it over to you.

2316
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:22,000
You're open forum for you. I don't want to rush you out of here, if you have anything else you want to say.

2317
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:26,000
Not really. I just figured I'd fill people in.

2318
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:27,000
Well, we do.

2319
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:28,000
Somebody send me a chat log.

2320
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:35,000
We do appreciate the update. I think mine logs, but if not, I'm sure somebody in chat will have you covered.

2321
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:36,000
Okay, cool.

2322
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:37,000
All right.

2323
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:38,000
All right.

2324
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:45,000
Keep us posted via Twitter. I know a lot of folks here at VOG Network follow you on Twitter, twitter.com slash bobbyblackwolf,

2325
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:51,000
and will be a great way to get the updates on how it goes with the insurance company and all that throughout the week.

2326
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:52,000
All right.

2327
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:53,000
All right.

2328
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:54,000
Bye, guys.

2329
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:57,000
All right. Take care, buddy. Bye bye.

2330
02:31:57,000 --> 02:32:00,000
I don't know what else to tell them right now.

2331
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:01,000
I've been there.

2332
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:02,000
Yeah.

2333
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:10,000
So, which is actually kind of funny because that same storm that I fried my roommate's hard drive in,

2334
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:16,000
one of my friends lost their Genesis, but their Super Nintendo worked.

2335
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
And they were both on the same circuit.

2336
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:19,000
All right.

2337
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:25,000
I'm going to need a dick or a fart joke, please, to help cheer us up a little bit here and lighten the mood a little bit.

2338
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:26,000
But let's try this call.

2339
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:27,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2340
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:30,000
Who's this?

2341
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:33,000
Hi, this is Haseo Tsumurugawa.

2342
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:34,000
Hi.

2343
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:35,000
Hello.

2344
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:36,000
You said Haseo Tsumurugawa?

2345
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:37,000
Yeah.

2346
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:38,000
Hey, what's up?

2347
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:39,000
I don't know if I've heard you call in before.

2348
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:40,000
What's on your mind, buddy?

2349
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:43,000
Actually, I've called in like two or three times.

2350
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:44,000
Oh.

2351
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:45,000
Yeah, Rob.

2352
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:46,000
I forgot.

2353
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:51,000
I don't remember a video call except I think I'm seeing a statue on your cam.

2354
02:32:51,000 --> 02:33:01,000
Actually, I chose that statue for a reason because the VoG network has earned good karma and had the hero shift to hero.

2355
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:04,000
It's the statue from Infamous 2.

2356
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:05,000
Oh, okay.

2357
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,000
It's a little dark in your room or something.

2358
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:08,000
It's a little fuzzy coming through.

2359
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:09,000
It's hard to make out.

2360
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:10,000
But I get it.

2361
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:11,000
I get it now.

2362
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
Crappy PlayStation way.

2363
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
So, what's up, buddy?

2364
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:22,000
Actually, I was going to talk about the whole virtual E3 booth that Sony was doing this week or whatever.

2365
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:23,000
Oh, okay.

2366
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:24,000
Yeah.

2367
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:25,000
I didn't have a chance to really check that out.

2368
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:26,000
Tell me about that.

2369
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:38,000
It was actually pretty interesting because they booth pretty much everything major that's coming out like Infamous 2nd Son, Assassin's Creed IV, and all that stuff.

2370
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:41,000
And they had like little quests and whatnot.

2371
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:48,000
You could earn a free month of Music Unlimited, PlayStation Plus, all those lovely things.

2372
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
That's pretty cool.

2373
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:53,000
Yeah, I heard about the free month of PlayStation Plus on home.

2374
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:54,000
That's pretty awesome.

2375
02:33:54,000 --> 02:34:08,000
The best thing actually about it was it told me about Tekken Revolution, even though Tekken Revolution kind of sucked because it's one of those Facebook type-y games.

2376
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:09,000
Oh, yeah.

2377
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:10,000
That free-to-play Tekken game.

2378
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
Free-to-play Tekken game we were talking about last week.

2379
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:13,000
I forgot.

2380
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:14,000
Yeah, it was supposed to come out.

2381
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:15,000
That's too bad.

2382
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:23,000
Yeah, my boyfriend was playing it because, you know, he wanted to play a new game and I said, well, why don't you try Tekken?

2383
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:27,000
He got about four or five fights into it and then it stopped.

2384
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:30,000
So, that's kind of sad.

2385
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:31,000
Womp womp.

2386
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:37,000
That was like me exploring, what was that god-awful MMO that's on PlayStation 3?

2387
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:38,000
Free Realms?

2388
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:39,000
Free.

2389
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:42,000
God, what a stinker.

2390
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:45,000
That's unfortunate.

2391
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:57,000
So, I'm assuming if you actually do all the stuff in PlayStation Home and all that, you've been a little bit of a Sony fanboy or I shouldn't say the word fanboy because that has a negative connotation.

2392
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:59,000
Actually, Sony fanboy is on my senior shirt.

2393
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:00,000
Okay, then fine.

2394
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:01,000
Sony fanboy.

2395
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:04,000
So, you must have been eating this shit up at E3.

2396
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:09,000
You must have just been like, this is the day I've been waiting for.

2397
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:12,000
Xbox fans can go eat it today.

2398
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:16,000
How are you feeling after Sony's press conference?

2399
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:27,000
I actually feel really good because mostly Sony got the rights to, you know, Air, Final Fantasy XIV, XV, which is actually versus XIII.

2400
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:32,000
And pretty much all the good stuff Square Enix is putting out.

2401
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:37,000
And the last 25 minutes, it was pretty much Sony saying, suck it, Microsoft.

2402
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:41,000
Yeah, it was pretty interesting.

2403
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:44,000
So, no hope on you getting an Xbox One?

2404
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
Absolutely not.

2405
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:50,000
I have internet troubles and I do not.

2406
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:58,000
Now, okay, since you said you're a Sony fanboy, I said earlier in the show, you know, I think Xbox's exclusives actually look a little better.

2407
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:04,000
Even though I ended up ordering a PlayStation 4 because the overall picture, I think, is better for PlayStation 4.

2408
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:08,000
And I'll get the Xbox One later when they sort out all their bullshit.

2409
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:18,000
But what I want to ask you is, explain to me why I'm wrong.

2410
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:30,000
Actually, I haven't really seen any exclusives for Xbox One that really, you know, kind of, I'd say, jump out at me as far as that goes.

2411
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:38,000
But, I mean, the exclusives for PlayStation 4 are superior in a sense.

2412
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:43,000
I mean, you know, you got...

2413
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:45,000
I can't really think of any right now.

2414
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:49,000
Yeah, I'm not really convinced right now.

2415
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:53,000
I'm just giving you a hard time. I'm putting you on the spot. It ain't easy. It ain't easy.

2416
02:36:53,000 --> 02:37:01,000
Well, assuming you're buying a PlayStation 4 on day one, what are you most looking forward to? The Square Enix games or...?

2417
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:15,000
The Square Enix games and Infamous Second Son because, spoiler alert, the end of the second one is kind of states why there's a whole new character and storyline and all that.

2418
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:21,000
Fair enough. All right, well, anything else you want to get off your chest before we let you go?

2419
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,000
Mirrors Edge 2 looks pretty.

2420
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:25,000
Mirrors Edge 2 does look pretty. I think we can agree on that.

2421
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:27,000
All right, thanks so much for the call, buddy.

2422
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:29,000
Absolutely no problem.

2423
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,000
Take care. Have a good one.

2424
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:35,000
1877 Game OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2425
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:41,000
What the heck? We're getting call after call tonight. Lots of people wanted to comment on E3. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

2426
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,000
Hey, this. I'm Deft.

2427
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:44,000
Hey, Agdeft.

2428
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:45,000
Hi, Agdeft.

2429
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:46,000
How are you doing?

2430
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:47,000
Pretty good.

2431
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:49,000
What's on your mind, buddy?

2432
02:37:49,000 --> 02:38:00,000
Well, something that not many people are talking about Sony and Microsoft, that they're both doing, and it's pretty great in my opinion,

2433
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:15,000
is that you only need to buy one subscription to PlayStation Plus and to Xbox One to everyone in the console or in your house to enjoy it.

2434
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:23,000
Oh, so meaning that if you just have to have the one account and then you can have all the TVs in your house,

2435
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:26,000
because I'm assuming they would all go back to the same IP at the end of the day,

2436
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:32,000
can all kind of use that central account to do Netflix and all that.

2437
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:42,000
Yeah, it's something that I find pretty useful because in my household, me and my brother do have each one on Xbox.

2438
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:48,000
So we do have, like, I am the only one that has a gold account.

2439
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:56,000
So in the future, if we decide either to get a PS4 or an Xbox One in this case,

2440
02:38:56,000 --> 02:39:03,000
it's pretty good that we only need to buy one subscription to enjoy the gold or Plus benefits.

2441
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,000
Loki's wearing a question mark on his face right now.

2442
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:08,000
I'm not sure if that's actually, if it's just going to be on the console or not,

2443
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:14,000
because I know, like, if I have live gold on one of my accounts, like an account on my 360,

2444
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:19,000
I can play multiplayer on that, but if I have a second account that's not live gold,

2445
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:25,000
you know, I still can't play online with that. I have to have a separate live gold account for that.

2446
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:29,000
And I know they have the family plans and got rid of it. I think it's just for one console.

2447
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:34,000
Basically, one console, any of the accounts that are on there, you can play live on,

2448
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:38,000
because it's tied to the console, not necessarily to your account.

2449
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:42,000
I mean, it's still tied to your account, but it's also tied to that console.

2450
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:47,000
Same with how the PlayStation 3, well, PlayStation 3 was, you know, free online,

2451
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:51,000
but pretty much you can have as many PlayStation Network accounts as you wanted,

2452
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
but I think they would kind of do it in a similar way.

2453
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:57,000
I'm not sure if, I could be wrong because I haven't really read the details on it yet,

2454
02:39:57,000 --> 02:40:02,000
but I don't think that they're having it where, like, I buy Xbox Live gold or whatever,

2455
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:06,000
and, you know, a sibling of mine has a separate console.

2456
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:09,000
We can both play them live at the same time. I don't think it works that way.

2457
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:13,000
Because otherwise, you know, what's to say if they're doing that 10 friend thing or whatever,

2458
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:18,000
that I buy gold and then everybody else plays for free. I mean, I just don't think they're going to do that.

2459
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:25,000
Yeah, I do think it's also just one console, but it's still pretty good,

2460
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:31,000
because even right now, you have to buy a subscription for each account you have.

2461
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:38,000
So with that, even if you cannot share it with another console, even in the same household,

2462
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:47,000
having just buying one subscription instead of two or even three in some cases, it's pretty good.

2463
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:51,000
Let me ask you this question, Akdeft, on kind of a little bit of a random tangent,

2464
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:56,000
but obviously you call into the show quite a bit, and you're kind of known as our friendly neighborhood Mexican,

2465
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:59,000
and you give a lot of perspective from living in Mexico,

2466
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:02,000
and sometimes our perspectives are a little shifted here in the US,

2467
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:06,000
because a lot of this stuff is really tailored for us here in the US, you know,

2468
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:12,000
and to some extent, Britain and the immediate UK territories like Germany, France, Spain, and so on,

2469
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:19,000
and Japan as well. How do these systems look from your perspective in Mexico?

2470
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,000
Is Xbox One launching in Mexico?

2471
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:28,000
Yeah, the Xbox One is launching in Mexico. Don't know if it's launching in November,

2472
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:38,000
but it has a retail price. They're already launching pre-orders, and it's around 8,500 pesos,

2473
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:43,000
which is around 600 or 700 dollars, I think.

2474
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:45,000
Okay, and how does PlayStation 4 look?

2475
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:53,000
And PlayStation 4 also seems that they're launching in November. I'm not sure at all,

2476
02:41:53,000 --> 02:42:02,000
but it looks like it, though it's launching for 1,000 pesos less, which is 7,500 pesos,

2477
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:10,000
and dollars would be, I think, around 550 and 600 dollars.

2478
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:15,000
So you're paying a premium similar to what our friends over across the Atlantic pay,

2479
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:19,000
because in the European territories, it's a little bit higher as well.

2480
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:24,000
Well, I mean, is this something, you've mentioned, you've crossed into America before

2481
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:27,000
to sometimes buy things at a cheaper price with this stuff.

2482
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:30,000
Is this something you're thinking about doing with the consoles, or no,

2483
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:33,000
because you want to be able to play the download stuff, or?

2484
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:42,000
Maybe I will, because at least Microsoft, something that has done in the past, even with the 360,

2485
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:52,000
is that it has most of the digital content on par with the US, at least most of it.

2486
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:58,000
Though the Xbox One doesn't look as appealing as the PS4 right now,

2487
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:02,000
because the Xbox TV stuff won't work here.

2488
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:08,000
At least not at launch, and I don't think it will work even in the first year.

2489
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:13,000
So that is a feature that won't be used here,

2490
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:19,000
and so the console will probably mostly be used as a gaming console,

2491
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,000
and it's way too expensive.

2492
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:25,000
Though, on the other hand, a Wii U costs the same.

2493
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:29,000
And if you're going to live in Mexico, you've got to be able to watch the telenovelas,

2494
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:32,000
because that, those are the bomb.

2495
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:37,000
No way, it's all about lucha libre. Forget the drama, I like watching the wrestlers.

2496
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:44,000
No, well it used to be all about sabarogicante, but that's gone now, if I am not mistaken.

2497
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,000
They finally pulled that.

2498
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:51,000
So telenovelas, they show some of them here, and they're great.

2499
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:54,000
I like watching the wrestlers, they are absolutely fun.

2500
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:58,000
I have a spicy telenovela, so no comments.

2501
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:02,000
Alright, ActDeaf, thank you so much for the perspective, we appreciate it.

2502
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:04,000
Have a good one, okay?

2503
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:05,000
You too, thanks for having me.

2504
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,000
No problem, any time, bye.

2505
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:11,000
1877 GameOLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2506
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:14,000
You know what's interesting, I didn't even ask ActDeaf about Nintendo at all,

2507
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,000
and he's such a big Kirby fan.

2508
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:19,000
I know he must have been squeaking at the Kirby in the Smash Brothers trailer.

2509
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:22,000
I mean, duh, Kirby's going to be in a Smash Brothers game,

2510
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
but I'm sure he was excited to see that.

2511
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:27,000
I think we can squeeze in one more call, if somebody wants to try and get it.

2512
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:30,000
It was just lighting up a minute ago, so we'll try to squeeze in one more.

2513
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:33,000
We're just after 9 o'clock, but we've got a little bit of a late start tonight,

2514
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:36,000
and we had a really awkward beginning here live,

2515
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:40,000
which I'm going to edit out all that dead air for the podcast, sorry, but it was weird.

2516
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:42,000
Alright, we've got at least one more call coming in, so let's try to take it.

2517
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:44,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

2518
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,000
Hey, this is Tiki.

2519
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:47,000
Hey, what's up?

2520
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:54,000
Hey, not much. I just want to say one thing and ask a question for Doc Sakura.

2521
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:55,000
Oh?

2522
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:56,000
Okay.

2523
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:59,000
Sony 1E3, that's it for me.

2524
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:05,000
That's it, huh? There's nothing, there's nothing, no convincing you otherwise.

2525
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,000
Sony 1E3, huh?

2526
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:12,000
Like, the way that Microsoft handled their DRM, they treat you like you're a criminal,

2527
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:15,000
and that's, no, there's no way.

2528
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:19,000
They're alienating their audience, plain and simple.

2529
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:22,000
Alright, what's your question for Doc Sakura, and then I'm going to throw you a curveball.

2530
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:26,000
Okay, um, I saw, like, the trailer for...

2531
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:33,000
He likes the trailer for, you just cut out, The Joys of Live Radio.

2532
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:41,000
Okay, um, I saw the trailer for Final Fantasy XIV, Realm Reborn, on the PS3.

2533
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:44,000
What's the game play like on the, since you're in the closed beta?

2534
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:50,000
I'm not playing it on PS3, I'm playing it on PC, and it's pretty much standard, you know, Momofare.

2535
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:57,000
It's, uh, you know, what I like about the combat in the game is that you don't have to stop to loot,

2536
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:59,000
it will automatically auto-loot.

2537
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:07,000
Um, you actually get to choose, I mean, well, they've sort of incorporated this in Mists of Pandaria lately,

2538
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:13,000
is actually getting, um, items from doing quests that are for your class specifically,

2539
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:16,000
as opposed to getting just everybody's stuff.

2540
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:23,000
Um, I'd like, um, the server that we're on is pretty crowded, I'll go ahead and say that right now,

2541
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:24,000
I don't like that so much.

2542
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:31,000
But, um, it's really fun, the game is smooth, even if you have a little bit of slowdown,

2543
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:37,000
it's not like a really horrible lag, you don't find yourself being stuck anywhere, if that makes sense.

2544
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:44,000
And, uh, the whole fate system, I enjoy that, basically you have these big group battles that give you extra experience.

2545
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:50,000
There's really just a lot of positive to be said about it, and on top of that, it looks like, you know,

2546
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:58,000
whereas even with the current graphical updates on World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy XIV looks like a new game.

2547
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:02,000
It looks and plays like a new game.

2548
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:08,000
The gameplay from it looks like, kinda looks like a, on par with Guild Wars 2 graphically.

2549
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:13,000
I would say so, and on top of that, you know, keep in mind the last time I played Final Fantasy XI,

2550
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:18,000
was in its original sort of play style with your group dynamics.

2551
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:22,000
The group dynamics in this are a lot different, I think I like it a lot better.

2552
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:27,000
Is it still like our Grand Fest, like it is in XI in the beginning?

2553
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:29,000
I haven't noticed any problems grinding.

2554
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:30,000
Okay.

2555
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:33,000
Yeah, I'm enjoying it, I'm enjoying it a lot.

2556
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:39,000
Actually, I hate being under NDA for saying stuff about the last beta,

2557
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:44,000
but the improvements that they're making are noticeable and very good.

2558
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:46,000
It's gonna be a really rich game when it boots.

2559
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:51,000
I might try it out on my first MMO on the PS3.

2560
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:55,000
Well, I can't speak for how it plays on the PS3,

2561
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:59,000
because I play on a PC just because of the problems with my hands,

2562
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:04,000
but I enjoy it, that's all I can say, I like it.

2563
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:06,000
Shane would vouch for it.

2564
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:08,000
Yes he will, yes he will.

2565
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:12,000
Shane would probably jump up and down on a trampoline saying how much he likes it, but you know.

2566
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:16,000
Alright, here's the curveball I wanted to throw at you before you guys got on Final Fantasy XIV.

2567
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:18,000
No, no, this is important, because this is for a lot of people,

2568
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:24,000
because everybody's turned E3 into Sony versus Microsoft, Sony versus Microsoft, da-da-da-da-da.

2569
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:26,000
Where does Nintendo sit with you?

2570
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:27,000
That's my curveball.

2571
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:29,000
Where does Nintendo sit right now?

2572
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:34,000
Funny you should ask that, I actually watched the Nintendo Direct the day of,

2573
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:37,000
on that day that they streamed it,

2574
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:43,000
and what my general overall feeling for that is,

2575
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:47,000
2014 is the year that we, for me.

2576
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:51,000
So, in other words, it's kind of one of my earlier tweets I'd put out there was like,

2577
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:56,000
boy, Nintendo's sure setting up a great season for 2014, too bad about this year.

2578
02:48:56,000 --> 02:49:01,000
Yeah, it's like there's nothing really that catches my eye, this year at all.

2579
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:04,000
There's the Mario game, the Mario 3D game looks great,

2580
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:09,000
but I mean, the Donkey Kong game, again, Donkey Kong's a solid platformer,

2581
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:14,000
but I think that's the problem, you've got two platformers with Mario and Donkey Kong.

2582
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:20,000
Yeah, I kind of wish they'd gone a different direction, but they could have done a lot worse.

2583
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:27,000
I guess there's nothing hardcore for me to play, that's why I like playing.

2584
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:31,000
So platformers are the party games.

2585
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:33,000
Alright buddy, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show,

2586
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:35,000
but do you have any other final thoughts?

2587
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:37,000
No, that's it.

2588
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:39,000
Alright, thank you, have a good one.

2589
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:40,000
You too.

2590
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:41,000
Alright, bye-bye.

2591
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:43,000
Alright, that's going to do it for the Skypline tonight,

2592
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:45,000
I'm sorry to those of you that didn't get through tonight,

2593
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:47,000
but I do have this very important update.

2594
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:50,000
According to Tigerclaw, and I went to the wiki to verify it,

2595
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:52,000
Sabado Higante is still on the air.

2596
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:56,000
I thought they were canceling it in 2011 or 2012,

2597
02:49:56,000 --> 02:50:00,000
but no, it celebrated its 50th anniversary on October 27th, 2012.

2598
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:08,000
They have some new co-hosts, but maybe they just stopped carrying it here locally or something,

2599
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:09,000
but that would seem weird.

2600
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:13,000
I think a show that's as old as that, it wouldn't stop.

2601
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:16,000
I guess I'm just not watching enough Mexican TV,

2602
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:19,000
but for what it's worth, I don't watch enough American TV either,

2603
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,000
so at least that's equal.

2604
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:23,000
Alright, well there's your very important update.

2605
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:24,000
Thank you to the chatters.

2606
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:27,000
Alright, that's it for the Skypline tonight.

2607
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:29,000
I got to get to some of these tweets we were getting,

2608
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:31,000
because we were getting some good tweets.

2609
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:36,000
And Loki, I always like to put a call out for last minute stories if you have anything.

2610
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:43,000
Yeah, real quick, I was going to mention that, well, it's kind of funny,

2611
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:46,000
we talk about porn a lot on this show,

2612
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:53,000
and one of the things that they're looking to bring to the Oculus Rift, porn.

2613
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:59,000
And it's actually being done by this startup studio.

2614
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:05,000
The game's called Wicked Paradise, and they're getting funding for it right now,

2615
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:11,000
but they're trying to make, I guess, a game that will get people horny.

2616
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:13,000
Genuinely horny.

2617
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:15,000
Wow.

2618
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:18,000
Yeah, so they've got information on that.

2619
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:21,000
So I thought that was kind of funny.

2620
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:25,000
And then I forgot to mention in the releases this week,

2621
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:32,000
a new Luigi U is going to be on the eShop this week.

2622
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:37,000
Yeah, when I heard about that, I was like, oh, yeah, that is real soon.

2623
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:39,000
So, pretty neat.

2624
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:42,000
Let me get to some of the tweets here real quick.

2625
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:48,000
sj100matt tweeted us about comedian Lewis Black talking about Xbox One and Google Glass on the Daily Show.

2626
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:50,000
I have seen that YouTube floating around.

2627
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:53,000
Because I was out of town, I haven't watched it yet.

2628
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:57,000
DarkSakura, some folks saying it should be maybe a fortune cookie in a future week.

2629
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:59,000
Because I know you do like Lewis Black, so check that out.

2630
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:01,000
Yeah, I love Lewis Black.

2631
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:08,000
Let's see, we got a tweet here from Ionotropic who notices that storm is heading his way.

2632
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:10,000
The one that got Bobby.

2633
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:12,000
So stay safe.

2634
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:14,000
Unplug stuff if you want.

2635
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:20,000
Let's see, DarkTetsuya says Bemani may be dead in the States, but it lives on in Japan.

2636
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:24,000
BeatMania 2DX21's Spada is on location test.

2637
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:26,000
And they said they weren't doing it anymore.

2638
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:31,000
Please tell me that somebody is saying this is Spada.

2639
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:33,000
Please tell me that's a joke.

2640
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:34,000
Somebody?

2641
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:36,000
Alright, fair enough.

2642
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:41,000
Let's see, Act F tweeting us that Pacman CEDX is coming to Steam.

2643
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:45,000
I did not know. That's kind of cool. I think that would be a fun game to play on PC.

2644
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:49,000
Is that part of that PC? No, I guess it's a separate thing.

2645
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:55,000
Tigerclaw tweeting us, Sega launching a new Sonic the Hedgehog series titled Sonic Boom.

2646
02:52:55,000 --> 02:53:01,000
It's by the creators of My Little Pony Friendship is Magic. Oh God. Oh man.

2647
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:02,000
Don't care anymore.

2648
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:07,000
That's some fandom skill. You gotta give it at least a chance. You gotta try at least one episode, DarkSakura.

2649
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:08,000
You gotta try it before you know it's really-

2650
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:09,000
I did. It was stupid.

2651
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:12,000
No, I'm not talking about My Little Pony. I'm talking about Sonic Boom.

2652
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:14,000
Oh, maybe.

2653
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:17,000
That does- Are we sure that's legit? Are we sure that's legit?

2654
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:21,000
Because that does sound a little bit fan wanky. I'm just saying. I'm just saying. Alright.

2655
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:29,000
And lastly, Rama tweeting us a story about Tekken producer Katsuhiro Harada missing.

2656
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:36,000
But actually, I think this was on our show roll last week but got bumped because of all the Microsoft news that was happening.

2657
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:42,000
I want to say there was a late-breaking update that he kind of just ran away for a little bit.

2658
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:45,000
But he's fine. He's safe. Don't worry. He's okay.

2659
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:46,000
What about the other dude?

2660
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:47,000
Which one?

2661
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:52,000
The guy that was Knuckles Dasa was?

2662
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:56,000
We haven't heard an update on him. I don't think. Thank you for asking.

2663
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:04,000
I'm gonna look. I don't know. I haven't heard.

2664
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:07,000
That's too bad.

2665
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:10,000
Oh well.

2666
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:17,000
I'm actually trying to find real quick where that Facebook is that might have an update.

2667
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:22,000
Live radio, guys, while I try to find this.

2668
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:25,000
Trying to see if there's anything-

2669
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:27,000
We're talking about Mexican wrestling now.

2670
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:28,000
Really?

2671
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:29,000
What the hell?

2672
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:30,000
There it is.

2673
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:39,000
Unfortunately, I'm looking at- and the website is, if you want more information on this, findknuckles.com.

2674
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:46,000
And they say that they're still out searching as often as they can when weather permits over the past week.

2675
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:50,000
They went out to Bowen Island. These are some places around Vancouver and so forth.

2676
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:52,000
So unfortunately, it sounds like he's still missing.

2677
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:59,000
So guys, especially if you're in the Pacific Northwest, and that goes double if you're in the Vancouver area, please check out findknuckles.com.

2678
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:04,000
It's gonna redirect you to a Facebook page, but just trying to get the latest on that.

2679
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:09,000
Boy oh boy.

2680
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:17,000
Let me see if I have any other tweet stories here.

2681
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:22,000
I don't think so, but I'm giving private messages.

2682
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:27,000
I'm getting told to take Sonic Boom with a grain of salt.

2683
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:33,000
Stay tuned for Anime Jam Session for all the latest on that. They'll tell you what is going on there.

2684
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:36,000
People are welcome to like what they like.

2685
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:37,000
That's right.

2686
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:39,000
I don't have to like it.

2687
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:41,000
I got sent this story here.

2688
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:46,000
Microsoft looking into playing games offline on Xbox One.

2689
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:47,000
Oh, sure they are.

2690
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:53,000
That was the one that, if I remember correctly, this is the one that's from the NeoGaf thing where someone had proposed,

2691
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:56,000
hey, you can have it so that it's optional so that, you know.

2692
02:55:56,000 --> 02:56:01,000
Oh, the Major Nelson thing where he tweeted or whatever saying, yes, we could do that.

2693
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:03,000
It's possible. I think that's what this is.

2694
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:05,000
Here's the thing with this story.

2695
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:08,000
Anything is, there's gonna be a lot of discussions after E3.

2696
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:15,000
You know, Microsoft, Microsoft really thought they were doing the right thing here.

2697
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:20,000
You know, and I think that's one thing I might have neglected to say in the beginning, so if, you know, I missed that, then I'm sorry.

2698
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:26,000
But Microsoft, I think in their minds, as twisted as it is, is trying to do the right thing.

2699
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:34,000
And go back to what I said earlier about they think that people want an Apple-like device, not necessarily the same thing they saw with 360.

2700
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:41,000
And that's the huge difference you heard in their press conferences was that, you know, when Jack Trenton was there stabbing Microsoft in the jugular,

2701
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:45,000
he said, we know that gamers like it just the way they are.

2702
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:49,000
When you hear what Microsoft is saying, no, gamers want something different.

2703
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:53,000
So in their mind, whether they're right or wrong, they're doing the right thing here.

2704
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:58,000
So a lot can change.

2705
02:56:58,000 --> 02:57:05,000
I kind of think it's too late to reverse course and backpedal for this holiday season, and I think they're gonna pay for it, but you never know.

2706
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:07,000
A lot can happen. We'll see what happens.

2707
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:10,000
But I think it goes without saying anything is possible.

2708
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:16,000
But don't expect anything next week, because there's gonna be a lot of board meetings and a lot of conferences that happen

2709
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:20,000
and a lot of consulting that happens over the next and focus groups.

2710
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:24,000
I would say you're not going to hear anything for about three months,

2711
02:57:24,000 --> 02:57:28,000
although they need to get something out a lot sooner if they want to get more preorders to the holiday season.

2712
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:34,000
But technically they could do it right up until the day it's out and still sell a lot of them.

2713
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:37,000
We'll see. Anything's possible.

2714
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:45,000
OK, I'm just looking at stuff in the chat at live.vognetwork.com.

2715
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:47,000
The chat room is all over the place.

2716
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:48,000
Yeah, all over the place.

2717
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:53,000
Akuma JP says, an Apple-like device. Xbox One looks like my grandpa's VCR.

2718
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:55,000
Betamax!

2719
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:59,000
Shadow Next Gen says, Microsoft could do something at PAX Prime since it's in their backyard.

2720
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:03,000
You know, Bobby and I were talking about that a little bit in the car or at Disneyland. I wanted to.

2721
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:05,000
We had some time together talking about all this stuff.

2722
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:16,000
And yeah, actually that was brought up that PAX Prime would be a very good place to make your case directly to the gamers

2723
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:19,000
that you seem to have ruffled feathers with.

2724
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:21,000
It's going to be a very interesting PAX Prime.

2725
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:23,000
Too bad we're all going to Dragon Con.

2726
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:32,000
We'll be following everything on Twitter and news and all that stuff as it goes on.

2727
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:38,000
Alright, that's it. We're about to the end of the show. It's been a very, very busy night tonight.

2728
02:58:38,000 --> 02:58:44,000
So I think it's about time we wrap up and take it back to the other shows here, The Voice Geeks Network

2729
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:47,000
and our big 11th birthday show next week.

2730
02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:51,000
Any other last minute stories before we get to that?

2731
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:53,000
Nope.

2732
02:58:54,000 --> 02:59:06,000
There's a small thing. There's some people being suspended from eSports or whatever for some Dota 2 match fixing.

2733
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:11,000
I guess it's allegedly that one team bet against themselves and threw the match.

2734
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:15,000
Apparently. And now they're banned.

2735
02:59:15,000 --> 02:59:17,000
Some people.

2736
02:59:17,000 --> 02:59:21,000
All for about a $100 bet.

2737
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:23,000
Well, cheating's cheating.

2738
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:27,000
Alright, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2739
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:32,000
Hey, if you enjoyed the show tonight and if you disagree with us wholeheartedly,

2740
02:59:32,000 --> 02:59:34,000
thank you for sticking with it for three hours.

2741
02:59:34,000 --> 02:59:41,000
But if you think we're not being fair to Microsoft or maybe being too fair to Microsoft or Sony or Nintendo,

2742
02:59:41,000 --> 02:59:43,000
send us your feedback.

2743
02:59:43,000 --> 02:59:46,000
It is a show where every gamer has a voice and we're interested in what you have to say.

2744
02:59:46,000 --> 02:59:49,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is our email address.

2745

2746
02:59:52,000 --> 02:59:56,000
or post on our Facebook page at Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio.

2747
02:59:56,000 --> 03:00:00,000
We do read all of it even if we don't always respond to it right away.

2748
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:06,000
And we thank you guys for your support and especially with all the bullshit that's going on

2749
03:00:06,000 --> 03:00:10,000
with Bobby's house getting hit by lightning right now which really sucks.

2750
03:00:11,000 --> 03:00:16,000
The way you guys are really banding together in chat just really shows why this network is an amazing place

2751
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:20,000
and I'm really happy to have you all as a part of it going into next week's birthday show.

2752
03:00:20,000 --> 03:00:22,000
I think that's a great thing to keep in mind.

2753
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:25,000
We will be back to do it all again next week with our 11th birthday.

2754
03:00:25,000 --> 03:00:30,000
JV Mohn will be here in the house in the East Coast representing New York City peeps.

2755
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:32,000
I really need to get back to New York City.

2756
03:00:32,000 --> 03:00:34,000
I want to go.

2757
03:00:34,000 --> 03:00:35,000
I know.

2758
03:00:35,000 --> 03:00:37,000
I haven't been since I was a senior in high school.

2759
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:38,000
I haven't been in a while either.

2760
03:00:38,000 --> 03:00:42,000
But anyway, let's go around and get everybody's final thought before we wrap up tonight.

2761
03:00:42,000 --> 03:00:48,000
My final thought tonight is I need to download and play Marvel Heroes this week

2762
03:00:48,000 --> 03:00:50,000
because I keep hearing about it and I keep forgetting to play it.

2763
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:52,000
So I will play it this week.

2764
03:00:52,000 --> 03:00:53,000
Yes, I know, DarkSakura.

2765
03:00:53,000 --> 03:00:55,000
But I want to give it a try for myself.

2766
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:57,000
Loki, your final thought tonight?

2767
03:00:57,000 --> 03:00:58,000
Hopefully my...

2768
03:00:58,000 --> 03:01:04,000
I've got these, what is it, Ethernet Overpower adapters that I'm getting

2769
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:08,000
so that I can hook up my PlayStation 3 to the front room TV

2770
03:01:08,000 --> 03:01:12,000
instead of having to have to drag a 50-foot Ethernet cable into that room

2771
03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:17,000
because remember, I have a launched 20-gig system that doesn't have Wi-Fi.

2772
03:01:17,000 --> 03:01:18,000
Yeah.

2773
03:01:18,000 --> 03:01:21,000
So hopefully that will come soon so I can do that.

2774
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:25,000
And I need to download and install and play Final Fantasy XIV.

2775
03:01:25,000 --> 03:01:29,000
Lastly and certainly not leastly, DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?

2776
03:01:29,000 --> 03:01:31,000
The sore throat.

2777
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:32,000
Aw.

2778
03:01:32,000 --> 03:01:36,000
It started during the mailbag and I will try not to breathe on anybody just in case.

2779
03:01:36,000 --> 03:01:39,000
You need another cup of coffee or a lozenge?

2780
03:01:39,000 --> 03:01:40,000
I'd like a lozenge.

2781
03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:41,000
Or both.

2782
03:01:41,000 --> 03:01:42,000
Sadly, I don't have any.

2783
03:01:42,000 --> 03:01:45,000
But I could totally do Jewish mother voice now.

2784
03:01:45,000 --> 03:01:46,000
All right.

2785
03:01:46,000 --> 03:01:47,000
That does it.

2786
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:49,000
Thank you guys again for downloading us and supporting independent podcasting.

2787
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:52,000
If you like what you heard, tell a friend or two about the show.

2788
03:01:52,000 --> 03:01:53,000
Help spread the word.

2789
03:01:53,000 --> 03:01:58,000
Help grow our amazing family here at the Voice of Geeks Network, Orange Lounge Radio.

2790
03:01:58,000 --> 03:02:00,000
And we'll be back to do it all again next week.

2791
03:02:00,000 --> 03:02:01,000
Thank you guys very much.

2792
03:02:01,000 --> 03:02:02,000
See ya.

2793
03:02:30,000 --> 03:02:32,000
See you next week.

2794
03:03:01,000 --> 03:03:02,000
All right.

2795
03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:03,000
No.

2796
03:03:03,000 --> 03:03:04,000
Be quiet.

2797
03:03:04,000 --> 03:03:05,000
Be quiet.

2798
03:03:05,000 --> 03:03:06,000
I wasn't ready for you.

2799
03:03:06,000 --> 03:03:08,000
I guess that thing was looping.

2800
03:03:08,000 --> 03:03:11,000
We gotta get to our fortune cookie message of the day.

2801
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:15,000
I've had such a long day today.

2802
03:03:15,000 --> 03:03:17,000
Oh my gosh.

2803
03:03:17,000 --> 03:03:19,000
That was a busy show tonight, you guys.

2804
03:03:19,000 --> 03:03:21,000
Thank you guys for all the kind words.

2805
03:03:21,000 --> 03:03:22,000
Early bedtime for Rob.

2806
03:03:22,000 --> 03:03:25,000
It wasn't a super funny show, but I felt the discussion was good.

2807
03:03:25,000 --> 03:03:27,000
It can't always be dick and fart jokes.

2808
03:03:27,000 --> 03:03:28,000
We had a lot of fun.

2809
03:03:28,000 --> 03:03:29,000
It can't always be dick and fart jokes.

2810
03:03:29,000 --> 03:03:30,000
We had a lot happen.

2811
03:03:30,000 --> 03:03:31,000
Yeah.

2812
03:03:31,000 --> 03:03:32,000
So thank you guys.

2813
03:03:32,000 --> 03:03:33,000
You guys really contributed to that.

2814
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:34,000
All right.

2815
03:03:34,000 --> 03:03:35,000
Let's get to the fortune cookie message of the day, guys.

2816
03:03:35,000 --> 03:03:38,000
And then we'll be back to wrap it all up.
