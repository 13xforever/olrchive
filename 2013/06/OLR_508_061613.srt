1
00:00:14,244 --> 00:00:15,044
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for watching.

2
00:00:15,064 --> 00:00:15,825
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next time.

3
00:00:32,537 --> 00:00:37,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

4
00:00:37,878 --> 00:00:41,019
[SPEAKER_06]: It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 508.

5
00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:43,119
[SPEAKER_06]: For this, June the 16th of 2013.

6
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:47,260
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Rob Roberts, here with you every week with my co-host.

7
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Say hello first off to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:52,221
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for the coffee, it's delicious.

9
00:00:52,241 --> 00:00:54,021
[SPEAKER_06]: You're welcome, you caffeinated and ready to go?

10
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:54,722
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yes.

11
00:00:54,862 --> 00:00:55,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Big show tonight.

12
00:00:55,582 --> 00:00:57,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Also say hello to TechMasterLoki.

13
00:00:57,282 --> 00:00:57,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

14
00:00:57,722 --> 00:00:59,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry to hear about the Minecraft server.

15
00:00:59,843 --> 00:00:59,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Eh.

16
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:01,883
[SPEAKER_10]: Meh, meh, meh.

17
00:01:03,072 --> 00:01:04,072
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get into that later.

18
00:01:05,313 --> 00:01:08,854
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a huge week this week, and we're not going to fuck around.

19
00:01:08,874 --> 00:01:10,334
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just going to get right into it tonight.

20
00:01:10,414 --> 00:01:16,216
[SPEAKER_06]: So honestly, probably one of those huge historical moments in gaming this week.

21
00:01:16,296 --> 00:01:18,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's relive this moment real quick.

22
00:01:18,777 --> 00:01:31,201
[SPEAKER_07]: In addition to creating an amazing library of new titles on PlayStation 4, we're equally focused on delivering what gamers want most without imposing restrictions or devaluing their PS4 purchases.

23
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:37,716
[SPEAKER_07]: For instance, PlayStation 4 won't impose any new restrictions on the use of PO4 gamers.

24
00:01:37,756 --> 00:01:51,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen to how long that applause goes on.

25
00:01:53,945 --> 00:01:56,166
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not just the fanboys in the upper ring.

26
00:01:56,586 --> 00:01:59,088
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the journalists, too, who can't contain themselves.

27
00:02:00,548 --> 00:02:01,509
[SPEAKER_07]: Guess that's a good thing.

28
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:09,524
[SPEAKER_07]: We believe in the model that people embrace today with PlayStation 3 and continue to demand.

29
00:02:10,144 --> 00:02:10,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Just heard you there.

30
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:15,609
[SPEAKER_07]: When a gamer buys a PS4 disc, they have the rights to use that copy of the game.

31
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:22,555
[SPEAKER_07]: They can trade in the game at retail, sell it to another person, lend it to a friend, or keep it forever.

32
00:02:23,296 --> 00:02:23,756
[SPEAKER_07]: Bullet.

33
00:02:24,497 --> 00:02:24,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Bullet.

34
00:02:25,398 --> 00:02:25,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Bullet.

35
00:02:26,419 --> 00:02:26,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Bullet.

36
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:28,400
[SPEAKER_06]: That was... wow.

37
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Some guy standing and cheering there.

38
00:02:37,481 --> 00:02:38,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Sit down, fanboy.

39
00:02:40,662 --> 00:02:49,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and don't forget over at the Microsoft area where they're watching, this enormous sound of which was a million hands moving.

40
00:02:50,146 --> 00:02:54,268
[SPEAKER_07]: PlayStation 4 disc-based games don't need to be connected online to play.

41
00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:09,090
[SPEAKER_07]: or for any type of authentication.

42
00:03:09,871 --> 00:03:16,154
[SPEAKER_07]: If you enjoy playing single player games offline, PS4 won't require you to check in online periodically.

43
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:27,580
[SPEAKER_07]: And it won't stop working if you haven't authenticated within 24 hours.

44
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:30,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Sick burn.

45
00:03:46,772 --> 00:04:15,020
[SPEAKER_06]: and the show is turning 11 next week and all the years I've been watching E3 that closely I have never seen anything like that where one company systematically takes down the policies of another like not since the Sega I mean I remember back in the Sega Nintendo days things would get ugly you know Genesis does when Nintendo don't and even the TurboGrafx you know Blast Processing yeah does all this stuff I mean like you know they used to be at each other's throats a lot more not saying that in the modern era it's been civil but everybody kind of stays off each other's toes this

46
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,163
[SPEAKER_06]: This was huge!

47
00:04:17,363 --> 00:04:21,310
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, and then they're like, oh hey, you like this cake right here?

48
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,554
[SPEAKER_10]: Well then I got some icing for you too!

49
00:04:24,773 --> 00:04:25,213
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

50
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,634
[SPEAKER_10]: We're only going to be $3.99.

51
00:04:27,035 --> 00:04:29,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Dear Microsoft, these are your cornflakes.

52
00:04:29,237 --> 00:04:30,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch as we piss in them.

53
00:04:30,257 --> 00:04:46,170
[SPEAKER_06]: So, like many of you out there, DarkSakura and I were watching this together and honestly, during this part of the press conference, my jaw's on the floor because I did not expect, well, like many of you, and we even said it on the show last week, we expected Sony to go down a similar path.

54
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Never in my life have I been happier to be wrong.

55
00:04:49,773 --> 00:04:52,755
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I go on record saying that I didn't think that

56
00:04:53,633 --> 00:04:55,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't make me dig up the archive of last week's show.

57
00:04:56,714 --> 00:04:58,995
[SPEAKER_02]: I said I wasn't sure, but I didn't think they would.

58
00:05:00,036 --> 00:05:01,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it is what it is.

59
00:05:02,017 --> 00:05:06,339
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't go down that same path, and many would say they won E3 because of it.

60
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:10,440
[SPEAKER_06]: And never mind the negatives in Sony's press conference.

61
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,041
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not trying to sound like a fanboy here.

62
00:05:12,081 --> 00:05:15,983
[SPEAKER_06]: I will get to some of the positives of Microsoft's in a minute here because, yes, I do believe there are some positives.

63
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:17,324
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

64
00:05:40,903 --> 00:05:50,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you know, Sony addressed the things that the people on the internet really wanted to hear the most about and got everybody talking because of it.

65
00:05:50,946 --> 00:06:01,710
[SPEAKER_10]: And actually what's kind of funny is I think, if I remember correctly, in between the whole talking about their policies and stuff like that and the price point, wasn't there like, oh, by the way, here's Final Fantasy 15.

66
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,191
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, and Kingdom Hearts 3, you know, that type of thing.

67
00:06:04,591 --> 00:06:08,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and going to our chat room, I always have to acknowledge the live folks.

68
00:06:08,393 --> 00:06:16,278
[SPEAKER_06]: We do tape live every Sunday night, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

69
00:06:16,298 --> 00:06:22,102
[SPEAKER_06]: We have our live chatter, Shadow Next Gen in chat saying, Sony did a masterful job of misleading people in that conference.

70
00:06:22,162 --> 00:06:24,123
[SPEAKER_06]: I give Sony PR a huge amount of credit.

71
00:06:25,004 --> 00:06:29,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, things like Kingdom Hearts 3, Final Fantasy 15, again, Jaws on the floor.

72
00:06:29,488 --> 00:06:30,629
[SPEAKER_06]: Those weren't exclusive games.

73
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:32,030
[SPEAKER_06]: We all know that now.

74
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:40,678
[SPEAKER_06]: And they never said they were exclusive games, but now we associate that with PlayStation 4 because those guys were on stage at the Sony press conference.

75
00:06:40,718 --> 00:06:45,502
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's many, I think there are many people that are like, where they were meant to be played.

76
00:06:45,522 --> 00:06:46,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

77
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:51,685
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, and then PlayStation Plus, too, is, you know, Ross Steele was saying $5 a month.

78
00:06:51,725 --> 00:06:55,349
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually cheaper than that because it's $40 or $50 a year.

79
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:59,755
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's even cheaper than Xbox Live Gold.

80
00:07:00,115 --> 00:07:03,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, what would $50 get you on Gold?

81
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:03,359
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

82
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,540
[SPEAKER_06]: It's close.

83
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,440
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about the same.

84
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,241
[SPEAKER_06]: How much is gold per month?

85
00:07:09,281 --> 00:07:10,241
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was more than that.

86
00:07:10,261 --> 00:07:16,462
[SPEAKER_06]: To be fair, Microsoft tried to raise the bar at their own press conference by saying we're going to start giving away games with an Xbox Gold subscription.

87
00:07:16,522 --> 00:07:17,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Fable 3 is already up.

88
00:07:17,943 --> 00:07:23,804
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they announced, what, Halo 3 and Assassin's Creed 2, which I know a lot of you guys are like, snore, I already own those games.

89
00:07:23,824 --> 00:07:28,625
[SPEAKER_10]: But here's the thing, though, and it's only up until the Xbox One launches, though, not afterwards.

90
00:07:28,705 --> 00:07:29,985
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's kind of lame.

91
00:07:30,465 --> 00:07:38,449
[SPEAKER_10]: It's cool if you're buying a 360 for like Grand Theft Auto 5 or something like that and you get your one month free of gold and you can go download all these extra games.

92
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:40,850
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's kind of cool.

93
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:51,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing too is that what a way Sony has come from 2006 when they were the laughing stock of E3, right?

94
00:07:51,574 --> 00:07:56,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember 599 US dollars attacked the crab's weak point for massive damage.

95
00:07:56,296 --> 00:07:57,297
[SPEAKER_02]: They did make a joke about that.

96
00:07:58,117 --> 00:08:00,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, oh yeah, then the guy had that joke about that.

97
00:08:00,678 --> 00:08:03,019
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, what does Sony do in their press conference?

98
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:05,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Attacks Microsoft's weak points for massive damage.

99
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Literally.

100
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,460
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what happened.

101
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:15,283
[SPEAKER_10]: I seriously thought when they announced that the price point was $4.99, when Microsoft did that, it was kind of like, here's Sony's press conference all over again.

102
00:08:15,763 --> 00:08:33,370
[SPEAKER_06]: And the biggest thing that really, in my opinion, even bigger than the Press Conference, sticking it to Microsoft, was that YouTube that instantly showed up, floating around with the two guys, Yoshida and the other guy from PlayStation, doing the tutorial on how to share used games.

103
00:08:34,051 --> 00:08:38,072
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see shade like that thrown outside of an episode of RuPaul's Drag Race.

104
00:08:38,913 --> 00:08:41,053
[SPEAKER_06]: That was some massive shade on Sony's part.

105
00:08:41,794 --> 00:08:42,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Bravo.

106
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:48,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and then, of course, you know, it immediately was turned into a series of animated GIFs for the internet.

107
00:08:50,204 --> 00:08:54,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry, just, Tumblr has been hilarious.

108
00:08:54,447 --> 00:08:54,787
[SPEAKER_02]: All week.

109
00:08:55,267 --> 00:08:57,189
[SPEAKER_02]: All because of seeing everything being repeated.

110
00:08:58,081 --> 00:08:59,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go back to Microsoft for a minute.

111
00:09:20,834 --> 00:09:27,938
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the game right here that was supposed to be Fuse, but Fuse ended up being some generic third-person shooter.

112
00:09:27,998 --> 00:09:35,961
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, this is the game that, I guess, not Fuse, it was Overstrike, I think what it was.

113
00:09:37,522 --> 00:09:42,043
[SPEAKER_10]: It was supposed to be Overstrike, but now it's this game, and it looks pretty sweet.

114
00:09:42,343 --> 00:09:52,186
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like this very stylized... It reminded me a lot of that Unreal 4 demo, or I guess it's not a demo, it's an actual game, Unreal 4 game, Fortnite.

115
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:58,608
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of reminded me of that, versus zombies and stuff, but very stylized.

116
00:09:59,028 --> 00:09:59,709
[SPEAKER_10]: So that looked cool.

117
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,091
[SPEAKER_10]: Dead Rising 3, I guess, looks alright.

118
00:10:03,932 --> 00:10:08,515
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not a huge fan of the shift in tone in the game to more serious.

119
00:10:08,636 --> 00:10:11,057
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of eh.

120
00:10:12,158 --> 00:10:16,201
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess Mirror's Edge, but that wasn't necessarily at their conference.

121
00:10:16,221 --> 00:10:22,406
[SPEAKER_10]: That was more of EA's, but Mirror's Edge looks awesome.

122
00:10:22,426 --> 00:10:22,766
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

123
00:10:24,528 --> 00:10:46,001
[SPEAKER_10]: and then not really actually even part of their conference at all but more clarification on their policy stuff that 10 friend sharing thing where you can have different circles of friends and basically you know I buy a copy of like fours of five or something like that and I can play the game at the same time as one of my friends can play the game off of my library that I'm sharing so that's kind of cool and that you can share a bunch of games but at the same time it's like

124
00:10:47,472 --> 00:10:47,832
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura.com

125
00:11:18,232 --> 00:11:18,512
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

126
00:11:18,572 --> 00:11:19,753
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of a weird strategy.

127
00:11:20,553 --> 00:11:26,576
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to say something nice about Microsoft that I actually might get a little bit of shit for because I'm sure not everybody will agree with me.

128
00:11:26,616 --> 00:11:31,058
[SPEAKER_06]: But I actually thought overall their exclusives looked better than the PlayStation 4 exclusives.

129
00:11:31,718 --> 00:11:42,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Yet I walked out of there still pre-ordering a PlayStation 4 because I think the third-party stuff that is on both systems combined with everything we already got into last week about what I don't like about Microsoft's DRM.

130
00:11:42,183 --> 00:11:43,043
[SPEAKER_06]: But what was exclusive?

131
00:11:44,103 --> 00:12:11,593
[SPEAKER_06]: on Microsoft Killer Instinct which I realize is getting its own bit but I'm interested enough Quantum Break looked great the game that you just checked the Sunset Overdrive looks really good Halo 5 I know not everybody's into first person shooters but I do like Halo games so I'm here for Halo and there was one other one that's escaping me right now oh the Crimson Dragon Panzer Dragoon

132
00:12:12,213 --> 00:12:12,734
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.com.

133
00:12:23,402 --> 00:12:24,783
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not really into Infamous.

134
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,084
[SPEAKER_06]: They all look okay.

135
00:12:26,564 --> 00:12:47,138
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll play them, but I'm not as excited as I was for maybe the Xbox One exclusives, but what's really selling me is A, the fact that I will own my games on Sony and that whole takedown, and B, the third-party stuff is what I'm really here for, the Kingdom Hearts and a lot of this other stuff that is going to end up being on both consoles.

136
00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:51,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy XIV, I'll probably end up picking up on PlayStation 4 and so on and so on.

137
00:12:56,664 --> 00:13:18,975
[SPEAKER_06]: let's talk about well actually I want to say too I don't think the $4.99 price is as bad as everyone's making it out to be granted Sony stuck it to them with the $3.99 price I think they were I think they were it had a huge advantage by going second that they probably had three or four PowerPoint slides ready to go with whatever would undercut Microsoft and that's what they pulled out of their hat

138
00:13:19,695 --> 00:13:29,824
[SPEAKER_14]: I think also that the really big negative is that whole thing with listening, especially with the whole NSA scandal going out right about now.

139
00:13:30,124 --> 00:13:34,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely, which we did touch on that a little bit last week, which still hasn't really been resolved.

140
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:35,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki?

141
00:13:36,129 --> 00:13:37,751
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I was going to say one thing.

142
00:13:37,952 --> 00:13:44,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking of having Kinect 2.0 or whatever bundled with the system, they didn't really show me any reason.

143
00:13:44,942 --> 00:13:47,926
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, they pretty much didn't show any games that utilize Kinect.

144
00:13:48,567 --> 00:13:52,032
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if they had a trailer for Fantasia during their conference, but...

145
00:13:52,772 --> 00:13:59,513
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, you know, even the games that were supposed to be for Kinect originally, Rise, for example, is now a regular controlled game.

146
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,494
[SPEAKER_10]: That Crimson Dragon game is supposed to be a Kinect game.

147
00:14:02,814 --> 00:14:05,374
[SPEAKER_10]: Now it's just, you know, it uses a regular controller.

148
00:14:05,735 --> 00:14:10,535
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like all these games now are sidestepping the use of Kinect, yet they're saying, oh, this is integral.

149
00:14:10,575 --> 00:14:13,776
[SPEAKER_10]: You need to have Kinect in there for, for what reason?

150
00:14:13,836 --> 00:14:16,497
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not using it in these games in a meaningful way.

151
00:14:16,917 --> 00:14:18,077
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my problem with it.

152
00:14:19,037 --> 00:14:25,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about where Microsoft fucked up because there's a couple key points that really is just fucking them up.

153
00:14:26,979 --> 00:14:28,639
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not even just the DRM thing.

154
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,100
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, obviously, that's one of them.

155
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:37,782
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think the big thing with that is that Microsoft honestly thinks they're trying to be progressive with this.

156
00:14:37,842 --> 00:14:41,643
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was a really great interview that came out about this.

157
00:14:41,743 --> 00:14:46,384
[SPEAKER_06]: And the interview was with Phil Spencer, who I think kind of knows a little better how to talk to the media and so forth.

158
00:14:47,204 --> 00:14:48,184
[SPEAKER_06]: and he talks about this.

159
00:14:48,244 --> 00:14:48,945
[SPEAKER_06]: He says, quote,

160
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:17,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Frankly, if you're on the PC or a Steam customer or an App Store customer on iOS devices, this is how you think about your library of content.

161
00:15:18,057 --> 00:15:20,519
[SPEAKER_06]: That's mistake number one Microsoft made.

162
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:24,403
[SPEAKER_06]: They believe their competition with this device is Apple, which...

163
00:15:25,423 --> 00:15:40,634
[SPEAKER_06]: is fair Apple's a huge dominating thing everybody wants a piece of that somebody wants to take them down but while Microsoft had their eyes on Apple and we're going to copy all these things people do because people eat this Apple shit up while Microsoft had their eyes fixated on that

164
00:15:40,874 --> 00:15:43,495
[SPEAKER_06]: They failed to recognize what was coming up right behind them.

165
00:15:44,155 --> 00:15:46,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Why did they fail to recognize what was coming up right behind them?

166
00:15:46,516 --> 00:15:52,799
[SPEAKER_10]: Because my digital library of Xbox Live Arcade games is unable to move with me to the next system.

167
00:15:53,439 --> 00:15:54,280
[SPEAKER_10]: It's stuck behind.

168
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,940
[SPEAKER_10]: Same with my current library of games.

169
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,901
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't move with the new system.

170
00:15:58,021 --> 00:16:04,244
[SPEAKER_10]: Whereas on the PlayStation 4, once the Gaikai service launches, I will be able to move with my digital purchases.

171
00:16:05,084 --> 00:16:06,024
[SPEAKER_10]: Or at least some of them.

172
00:16:06,124 --> 00:16:08,165
[SPEAKER_10]: And it will probably slowly roll out.

173
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:09,486
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the other problem.

174
00:16:10,206 --> 00:16:32,776
[SPEAKER_06]: and I believe this to be a way bigger deal than some of you may think but I think Microsoft made a huge mistake getting rid of all their community outreach people which they did some time ago remember when they got rid of all the people that were doing the Xbox TV thing and they got rid of the Gamerscore blog and they got rid of a lot of their community outreach people oops, Microsoft forgot how to talk to the community

175
00:16:33,903 --> 00:16:34,564
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.

176
00:16:58,303 --> 00:16:59,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, you have shitty internet?

177
00:16:59,784 --> 00:17:01,626
[SPEAKER_06]: iOS games are also 99 cents.

178
00:17:01,806 --> 00:17:02,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Loki.

179
00:17:02,307 --> 00:17:03,808
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you have shitty internet, you buy a 360.

180
00:17:03,868 --> 00:17:08,432
[SPEAKER_10]: That's our option for you because the Xbox One needs to be connected.

181
00:17:08,913 --> 00:17:10,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you're in another country.

182
00:17:10,294 --> 00:17:11,135
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, or another country.

183
00:17:11,195 --> 00:17:13,537
[SPEAKER_10]: And here's the other great thing about that, too.

184
00:17:13,817 --> 00:17:18,722
[SPEAKER_10]: He was like, well, you have to understand, you know, you're not going to buy a cell phone if you don't have cell service.

185
00:17:19,823 --> 00:17:21,585
[SPEAKER_10]: The problem is your device...

186
00:17:24,155 --> 00:17:28,118
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not a device that... I don't buy internet so that my game console works.

187
00:17:28,438 --> 00:17:33,462
[SPEAKER_10]: A phone, you buy to access the phone network.

188
00:17:35,023 --> 00:17:39,686
[SPEAKER_10]: Internet's used for your PC, for TV stuff, for your phone, for whatever.

189
00:17:40,106 --> 00:17:43,129
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a multi... It's like saying, well, you don't...

190
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:44,110
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

191
00:18:01,349 --> 00:18:07,271
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, he comes out and sounds like a complete, or I forget who it was, Phil Spencer, I think, comes out and sounds like a complete jackass.

192
00:18:07,852 --> 00:18:09,312
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, he's like, I don't even know.

193
00:18:09,372 --> 00:18:16,015
[SPEAKER_10]: He was talking about like, you know, oh, you know, someone was telling me that their friend works on a, you know, nuclear sub and stuff.

194
00:18:16,115 --> 00:18:17,236
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even know what that means.

195
00:18:17,256 --> 00:18:18,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I was going to bring that up next.

196
00:18:18,996 --> 00:18:21,917
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a huge faux pas on Microsoft's part.

197
00:18:21,937 --> 00:18:23,518
[SPEAKER_06]: That was Don Matrick, actually, that said that.

198
00:18:23,538 --> 00:18:23,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Don Matrick.

199
00:18:24,318 --> 00:18:25,399
[SPEAKER_06]: And I predict...

200
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:31,857
[SPEAKER_06]: he will be replaced within 365 days because somebody's gonna take the fall for this crap and it's gonna be him

201
00:18:33,641 --> 00:18:37,482
[SPEAKER_06]: He will be replaced within 365 days because somebody's going to take the fall for this.

202
00:18:37,802 --> 00:18:38,522
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's going to be him.

203
00:18:38,942 --> 00:18:40,543
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sorry, Xbox fanboys.

204
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:44,464
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there's many of you saying, oh, they could still win the holiday season.

205
00:18:44,964 --> 00:18:46,164
[SPEAKER_06]: I honestly don't think so.

206
00:18:46,224 --> 00:18:47,605
[SPEAKER_06]: They've already lost the holidays.

207
00:18:47,945 --> 00:18:49,325
[SPEAKER_06]: It's too late to reverse course.

208
00:18:49,665 --> 00:18:51,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Corporations don't know how to talk off script.

209
00:18:52,226 --> 00:18:55,727
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to take a miracle for Microsoft to pull out the holiday at this point.

210
00:18:56,207 --> 00:18:59,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Xbox fans, your biggest sticking point right now, honestly, A,

211
00:19:00,908 --> 00:19:06,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Ask a Nintendo fan how to deal with six months of bullshit coming from the internet because, you know, you can take comfort with them.

212
00:19:06,892 --> 00:19:07,973
[SPEAKER_06]: But we'll get to Nintendo in a minute.

213
00:19:08,573 --> 00:19:17,299
[SPEAKER_06]: And B, stick to the exclusives because that's the big thing that Microsoft has going for it right now is that you won't be able to play a lot of that stuff.

214
00:19:17,399 --> 00:19:19,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Halo 5 is huge and you won't be able to play it anywhere else.

215
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:27,526
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, and on top of that too, like, you know, these retailers or whatever, now that Sony is not following suit with the Xbox One,

216
00:19:29,267 --> 00:19:55,325
[SPEAKER_10]: guess where they're pushing the customers that are pre-ordering stuff where their bigger margins are PlayStation 4 so you have that working against them as well unless they change their mind but I think even a lot of people are saying hey you know what even if they change their mind and reverse their decision on this stuff I'm still not going to support them because they took this stance in the first place and what kind of bullshit are they trying to put us through sure

217
00:19:56,386 --> 00:20:24,837
[SPEAKER_06]: ShadowNextGen in chat says the internet is a vocal minority they don't matter in the grand scheme of things okay let's talk about my co-workers who have already decided they won't be buying an Xbox One or the random employee at Disneyland that saw we were coming from E3 that was talking to my friend and I about stuff and how he's been an Xbox fanboy all this time and does not plan to get an Xbox One the internet may be a vocal minority but the little ripple starts here and the tidal wave can crash

218
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:28,220
[SPEAKER_14]: or relatives of mine who all they do is play Farmville but they saw enough.

219
00:20:29,601 --> 00:20:32,903
[SPEAKER_02]: The internet is really not the minority you like to think it is.

220
00:20:33,163 --> 00:20:42,791
[SPEAKER_02]: You may have more vocal people in the minority but the majority of people who are in the consumer market are going to have access to the internet and see this information.

221
00:20:43,452 --> 00:20:43,992
[SPEAKER_02]: End of story.

222
00:20:44,032 --> 00:20:51,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether or not they say anything and here's something that came from one of those stupid courses I'm sorry I hate to say this Rob because I know that's what you do.

223
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:58,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Those little team building courses that you do at work, one of them was called being an advocate.

224
00:20:58,305 --> 00:21:08,296
[SPEAKER_02]: For every one person that complains, there are eight other people who do not, who still have that same opinion, who will be swayed by the one that complains.

225
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:11,972
[SPEAKER_06]: and then Ross D.O.U.T.

226
00:21:11,992 --> 00:21:38,893
[SPEAKER_06]: in our chat room even points out and I was going to bring this up but this shit even got on Rachel Maddow's blog who was bashing the fact that well you know despite however you feel about her with politics and everything the fact that she is working for MSNBC her show is on MSNBC and she's basically bashing what was said about the whole fact you won't be able to play it on a nuclear submarine and the whole fact that you know basically the Xbox is giving the finger to the military and all this stuff I mean that was a huge faux pas

227
00:21:39,306 --> 00:21:41,027
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't forget about the other jokes.

228
00:21:41,547 --> 00:21:41,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

229
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:42,508
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

230
00:21:44,048 --> 00:21:48,450
[SPEAKER_06]: One other thing I want to bring up that is a key failure on Microsoft's part.

231
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:53,953
[SPEAKER_06]: And if Microsoft can pull out the holiday, this is the only way they're going to be able to do it.

232
00:21:54,053 --> 00:21:57,594
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is the fact that the Xbox One is married to Kinect.

233
00:21:58,435 --> 00:22:02,457
[SPEAKER_06]: And it says a lot when not a single...

234
00:22:03,177 --> 00:22:08,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Game, at that press conference, not one of them used Kinect.

235
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:13,262
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there were some on the show floor with Just Dance 2014 and the Fantasia game.

236
00:22:13,302 --> 00:22:16,244
[SPEAKER_10]: And some of the games that they did show did support it, but it wasn't shown.

237
00:22:16,284 --> 00:22:16,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

238
00:22:17,164 --> 00:22:23,107
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's the big fucking deal about Kinect and why is there going to be one force included with every single system?

239
00:22:23,347 --> 00:22:30,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'll bet you the way that PlayStation got the price of their console down to $399 is A, they're going to shaft you on memory storage.

240
00:22:30,571 --> 00:22:32,792
[SPEAKER_06]: B, 500 gigabytes on the hard drive.

241
00:22:33,232 --> 00:22:34,453
[SPEAKER_06]: On the $3.99 version?

242
00:22:34,633 --> 00:22:34,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

243
00:22:35,033 --> 00:22:36,013
[SPEAKER_06]: There is only one version.

244
00:22:36,173 --> 00:22:36,273
[SPEAKER_10]: It's $3.99.

245
00:22:36,353 --> 00:22:37,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

246
00:22:38,514 --> 00:22:39,494
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not going to try to put out a $4.99, $5.99?

247
00:22:40,575 --> 00:22:40,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

248
00:22:40,935 --> 00:22:41,535
[SPEAKER_06]: That's okay.

249
00:22:42,075 --> 00:22:42,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Color me surprised.

250
00:22:43,576 --> 00:22:46,557
[SPEAKER_06]: But they definitely are not including the PlayStation 9 and stuff.

251
00:22:46,757 --> 00:22:50,858
[SPEAKER_10]: And on top of that, it is upgradable, just like the PlayStation 3.

252
00:22:52,699 --> 00:22:55,019
[SPEAKER_10]: But the i and all that stuff, nowhere to be seen.

253
00:22:55,099 --> 00:22:56,380
[SPEAKER_10]: i is $60 separate.

254
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:56,700
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

255
00:22:57,518 --> 00:23:00,519
[SPEAKER_14]: Even so, that's not enough to bump it up a whole hundred bucks.

256
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:16,807
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think the only way that Microsoft is going to be able, especially with all this negative perception Kinect has right now in the backlash, I really think the only way Microsoft is going to be able to pull the holidays out is to drop the price of the console a hundred bucks to attach itself from Kinect.

257
00:23:17,287 --> 00:23:23,350
[SPEAKER_06]: And now we can have a debate about are the exclusives worth the DRM restrictions and yada, yada, yada.

258
00:23:23,897 --> 00:23:52,090
[SPEAKER_06]: I still don't know that that's going to be enough for me it still won't be honestly but you never know I mean I think the internet is speaking loud and clear the gamer fan base is upset I don't think a corporation like Microsoft can move fast enough but we'll see well and on top of that just in the general way they've disrespected their user base I wouldn't give them my money until I could buy one second hand that would assure that they wouldn't get that money

259
00:23:52,662 --> 00:23:57,180
[SPEAKER_10]: and on top of that a lot of the stuff that they might be a bit much well you know no I do that stuff you know me

260
00:23:57,841 --> 00:24:05,023
[SPEAKER_10]: There were some games that they showed that were Xbox exclusive, and I'm not just talking about Xbox One, both Xbox One and Xbox 360.

261
00:24:05,223 --> 00:24:10,644
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, for example, the new Plants vs. Zombies game, which looks pretty sweet.

262
00:24:11,965 --> 00:24:12,245
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever.

263
00:24:12,485 --> 00:24:12,905
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

264
00:24:13,005 --> 00:24:13,345
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't care.

265
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:14,905
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks fantastic.

266
00:24:16,106 --> 00:24:19,807
[SPEAKER_10]: So that'll be one I want to pick up on Xbox 360 when it comes out later on.

267
00:24:20,087 --> 00:24:24,088
[SPEAKER_10]: And Titanfall was another one that was, I think, Xbox One, Xbox 360 exclusive.

268
00:24:24,528 --> 00:24:24,988
[SPEAKER_10]: Hell, I have a 360.

269
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,170
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to be gaming on it for a long time.

270
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:36,355
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm not worried about all these games coming out that may be only on the Xbox platforms because I have an Xbox platform.

271
00:24:36,416 --> 00:24:37,016
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just, you know...

272
00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:41,421
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to buy two next-gen consoles.

273
00:24:41,561 --> 00:24:50,768
[SPEAKER_10]: And not necessarily because I just don't like... I mean, I don't really like the policies that they have with Xbox One, but I can't afford two consoles right now like that.

274
00:24:50,908 --> 00:24:54,992
[SPEAKER_10]: And I bought all three this generation, and I play one of the three.

275
00:24:55,152 --> 00:24:57,514
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm not going to throw away my money like that.

276
00:24:57,754 --> 00:25:04,539
[SPEAKER_10]: Just buy one, and then when they drop their price and release a Grand Theft Auto VI or something like that, that's exclusive to Xbox One, which will never happen.

277
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,541
[SPEAKER_10]: But then we can talk about it.

278
00:25:06,667 --> 00:25:09,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Bloodjunk makes a good point that Titanfall is also on PC.

279
00:25:11,431 --> 00:25:12,732
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but my laptop can't run that.

280
00:25:13,573 --> 00:25:14,434
[SPEAKER_02]: But my computer can.

281
00:25:14,874 --> 00:25:25,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Before we get into our gaming weeks and covering the rest of the news tonight and ultimately getting to your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR and your further chat comments and so forth, we've been very focused on Microsoft versus Sony, as a lot of people have.

282
00:25:26,043 --> 00:25:32,928
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to ignore Nintendo because, obviously, that's a console, too, and they had their own set of expectations going into E3.

283
00:25:33,369 --> 00:25:35,350
[SPEAKER_06]: How did we all feel about Nintendo?

284
00:25:35,931 --> 00:25:37,772
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll start with Nintendo's biggest critic in the room.

285
00:25:37,812 --> 00:25:39,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, how did you feel about what Nintendo did?

286
00:25:39,334 --> 00:25:40,875
[SPEAKER_06]: There was nothing surprising from them.

287
00:25:41,135 --> 00:25:45,316
[SPEAKER_10]: Honestly, because all the stuff that we knew was coming, they basically announced.

288
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:47,637
[SPEAKER_10]: There wasn't anything like, oh, hey, I didn't see that.

289
00:25:47,977 --> 00:25:52,779
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, the only game I didn't know that was coming was a new Donkey Kong game, and I was like, who cares?

290
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:55,000
[SPEAKER_10]: We just had a Donkey Kong game come out.

291
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:55,840
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't really care.

292
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:01,642
[SPEAKER_10]: This looks exactly like the other one, except, oh, now it's 3D, and it goes into the background, and who gives a shit?

293
00:26:02,382 --> 00:26:03,143
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

294
00:26:18,072 --> 00:26:20,413
[SPEAKER_10]: But I just don't really care anymore about it.

295
00:26:20,613 --> 00:26:21,853
[SPEAKER_10]: Smash Brothers look kind of cool.

296
00:26:22,554 --> 00:26:25,455
[SPEAKER_10]: And some of the new characters that they're announcing are kind of... It's neat.

297
00:26:25,575 --> 00:26:28,256
[SPEAKER_10]: I like how they're going with that.

298
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:31,437
[SPEAKER_10]: Bayonetta 2 just kind of... It was alright.

299
00:26:31,737 --> 00:26:33,077
[SPEAKER_10]: But when's that coming out?

300
00:26:33,698 --> 00:26:34,278
[SPEAKER_10]: No idea.

301
00:26:34,598 --> 00:26:34,738
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, 2014.

302
00:26:34,778 --> 00:26:37,019
[SPEAKER_06]: But that could be Christmas 2014.

303
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:40,361
[SPEAKER_10]: Originally it was supposed to be 2013, so I don't know.

304
00:26:41,942 --> 00:26:46,145
[SPEAKER_10]: Zelda Wind Waker HD just doesn't look like they've really done a lot to it.

305
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:50,189
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't really add anything to it other than, you know, now you can travel the seas faster.

306
00:26:50,369 --> 00:26:54,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and that Accel Shaded game looks a lot better on HD, but, you know.

307
00:26:54,552 --> 00:27:01,077
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm still disappointed, though, that a system that plays Wii games isn't able to up-res those things.

308
00:27:01,368 --> 00:27:03,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, here's the thing about Nintendo for me.

309
00:27:20,918 --> 00:27:25,040
[SPEAKER_06]: All that aside, when you really kind of looked at the news itself, a lot of it was just kind of par.

310
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,421
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'm not like, I wasn't like, woo, Nintendo, like super excited.

311
00:27:29,761 --> 00:27:35,283
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, certainly the couple games that I was excited about, I'm really excited about.

312
00:27:35,303 --> 00:27:36,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario Kart 8 looks killer.

313
00:27:37,284 --> 00:27:43,205
[SPEAKER_06]: The new Mario 3D World, which I don't get the 3D, not on a 3DS, but whatever, okay, whatever.

314
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:44,226
[SPEAKER_06]: And cats.

315
00:27:44,346 --> 00:27:47,707
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgive it because it's got the floating princess and Luigi legs again, whatever.

316
00:27:48,747 --> 00:27:49,168
[SPEAKER_06]: and Cats.

317
00:27:49,508 --> 00:27:50,549
[SPEAKER_06]: And X looked good.

318
00:27:50,849 --> 00:27:51,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

319
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,530
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, you know, yeah, that's all stuff that's cool.

320
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:56,732
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I was kind of like, that's a lot of 2014 stuff.

321
00:27:57,153 --> 00:28:03,576
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the thing that kind of concerned me about it is that it's not that the games don't look good because they all do look really good and, you know, hey, it's Nintendo.

322
00:28:03,596 --> 00:28:04,157
[SPEAKER_06]: But I was kind of like...

323
00:28:04,697 --> 00:28:11,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, I kind of wanted Nintendo to really have a come-from-behind holiday and they're going to really kick some butt this holiday season.

324
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:17,421
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm kind of like, maybe they'll kick butt in 2014 because they didn't announce a price drop or anything to really move those consoles this season.

325
00:28:17,441 --> 00:28:22,043
[SPEAKER_10]: They have the same fucking lineup they had two years ago with the 3DS.

326
00:28:22,643 --> 00:28:24,964
[SPEAKER_10]: Mario 3D Land and Mario Kart.

327
00:28:25,044 --> 00:28:27,085
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously, they're just repeating the steps.

328
00:28:27,345 --> 00:28:28,725
[SPEAKER_10]: So what, are we going to get a price drop?

329
00:28:28,945 --> 00:28:30,226
[SPEAKER_10]: Same strategy as the 3DS.

330
00:28:30,526 --> 00:28:33,967
[SPEAKER_02]: But those games are enough to make me want to go out and buy a Wii U assuming I had the funds for it.

331
00:28:34,363 --> 00:28:41,229
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait a second, that's actually exactly their strategy because there's also another new Mario, or I'm sorry, new Luigi U game in August.

332
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,170
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but Smash Bros.

333
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:42,631
[SPEAKER_10]: is not until 2014.

334
00:28:42,691 --> 00:28:43,852
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but I don't care.

335
00:28:43,872 --> 00:28:52,600
[SPEAKER_10]: That makes me want a Wii U. It's literally the exact same lineup as like 2011 for the 3DS on the Wii U. It's like exactly.

336
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,102
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is my I don't care face.

337
00:28:54,142 --> 00:28:54,602
[SPEAKER_02]: I want one.

338
00:28:55,223 --> 00:28:56,664
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't get to finish my thought completely.

339
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:58,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Now people in chat are like, Rob, you're wrong.

340
00:28:59,966 --> 00:29:25,876
[SPEAKER_06]: the thing is is that even if Nintendo chooses not to drop the price of their console which I don't think is the smartest decision but okay if they don't do it they're still the cheapest option out there at the holiday season and I think there are a lot of families that aren't informed on this whole Microsoft versus Sony thing and are simply going to go for the cheapest option that the thing is for their kids because you know yes the Mario games are going to speak to certain people and so forth but

341
00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:32,044
[SPEAKER_06]: This is where I'm torn because that argument should have worked last year.

342
00:29:32,965 --> 00:29:34,146
[SPEAKER_06]: See, that's my problem.

343
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:38,050
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a Mario game last year and the console still didn't sell.

344
00:29:38,551 --> 00:29:43,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so we have a couple more this year, but we don't have anything else to really push it.

345
00:29:43,396 --> 00:29:48,721
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're just telling me that more of the same is going to move more consoles.

346
00:29:49,662 --> 00:30:14,214
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not I mean I'm skeptical and I'm not rooting against Nintendo I really hate that all these publishers are abandoning Nintendo I think they're being dicks about it but I want to see Nintendo do better but I just kind of I feel like I didn't really get it from them how they're going to light a fire under the Wii U that's what was frustrating for me so

347
00:30:17,589 --> 00:30:21,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com Well, I mean, that's a problem.

348
00:30:21,412 --> 00:30:24,473
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would argue it didn't have a holiday season like Wii's.

349
00:30:32,418 --> 00:30:34,019
[SPEAKER_06]: or Xbox 360s when it launched.

350
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:41,124
[SPEAKER_10]: It had a pretty decent launch, but the thing was that, yeah, there were no games for like three months after it came out.

351
00:30:41,184 --> 00:30:42,945
[SPEAKER_10]: And a lot of them were ports of older games.

352
00:30:43,565 --> 00:30:48,268
[SPEAKER_10]: And we could very well see that kind of lineup, although they're going to have like Wii Fit U, big deal.

353
00:30:49,769 --> 00:30:54,913
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't even know what they're going to have for like, you know, the first quarter of 2014.

354
00:30:55,033 --> 00:30:59,956
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, there is a lot of stuff that who knows where this is going to be coming out.

355
00:30:59,976 --> 00:31:00,136
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

356
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:02,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Kubica Jeremy in chat says, Actually, Mass Effect 3 was the same way.

357
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, something's up there.

358
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:03,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Like...

359
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:20,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Is something fucked up with Nintendo Network where DLC isn't as easy to do or something?

360
00:31:20,103 --> 00:31:25,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Because why do we keep seeing these subpar games that, you know, they launch and it's eh.

361
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,689
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they're like piss poorly supported after launch.

362
00:31:29,049 --> 00:31:31,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Mass Effect 3 is a great example.

363
00:31:31,851 --> 00:31:35,294
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a better experience on Wii U. It had nothing to carry over on top of that.

364
00:31:35,354 --> 00:31:43,580
[SPEAKER_02]: All the things that made playing 3 actually kind of mildly worthwhile was carrying over your previous game data and it didn't even have a good version to do that.

365
00:31:44,272 --> 00:31:46,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, I want to move on to the other stories and so forth.

366
00:31:46,933 --> 00:31:53,996
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do want to say on a positive note for Nintendo, I think one other thing to keep in mind when I'm talking about that I'm not seeing enough or whatever.

367
00:31:54,736 --> 00:32:00,298
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing that should be noted is that one thing Nintendo has been doing right is that they're doing more of those Nintendo Directs.

368
00:32:00,618 --> 00:32:04,780
[SPEAKER_06]: And they did already put out some surprises that would usually be an E3 thing, right?

369
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:07,161
[SPEAKER_06]: The Zelda 3D on 3DS and so forth.

370
00:32:08,502 --> 00:32:28,804
[SPEAKER_06]: 3DS fucking rules right now like as far as handhelds go I mean PlayStation is phoning in the Vita 3DS is Amazeballs, Animal Crossing, Zelda, Smash Brothers I mean 3DS is fucking where it's at for handhelds right now if you're like a gamer like that's one thing Nintendo ain't doing wrong it just took them a long time to get there

371
00:32:29,645 --> 00:32:54,351
[SPEAKER_06]: but you know a lot of that stuff kind of came out before so I'm hoping that maybe there's another Nintendo Direct in a month that has some other stuff to get us excited and I know there's some news coming up later that maybe Nintendo hasn't played all their cards right now so that will be interesting to see play out so all right uh any other thoughts on the big three before we get into our gaming weeks quickly and gaming news and all that

372
00:32:55,852 --> 00:32:56,373
[SPEAKER_10]: Ubisoft.

373
00:32:56,813 --> 00:33:00,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Like always, Ubisoft had a lot of cool stuff to show at their press conference.

374
00:33:01,336 --> 00:33:14,425
[SPEAKER_10]: And I always kind of think that being able to take E3 each year, they showed off, what was it, The Crew, which looked pretty awesome, like an open world burnout type game, which is pretty sweet.

375
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:23,231
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they also had the new Tom Clancy game, Division, or The Division, that looked pretty cool as well, like that MMO that ties in with the iPad and stuff.

376
00:33:24,171 --> 00:33:25,152
[SPEAKER_10]: So I thought that was really cool.

377
00:33:26,072 --> 00:33:26,673
[SPEAKER_10]: Want to check that out?

378
00:33:26,873 --> 00:33:31,016
[SPEAKER_10]: Those games actually kind of seem like, okay, here's how we're going to use next gen.

379
00:33:31,056 --> 00:33:38,642
[SPEAKER_10]: They kind of showed that versus Rise, which is like, cool, you made a knockoff of God of War.

380
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:40,763
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

381
00:33:42,765 --> 00:33:52,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Before we get into Gaming Weeks, let me ask this question with my big slash troll face because this is definitely the question that cynical gamers everywhere are asking.

382
00:33:54,274 --> 00:33:56,955
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think will sell more this holiday season?

383
00:33:57,435 --> 00:34:00,116
[SPEAKER_06]: The Xbox One or the Wii U?

384
00:34:01,416 --> 00:34:03,136
[SPEAKER_06]: What will sell more this holiday season?

385
00:34:03,156 --> 00:34:05,137
[SPEAKER_06]: The Xbox One or the Wii U?

386
00:34:06,557 --> 00:34:11,418
[SPEAKER_02]: If everybody had my brain, it would be the Wii U. But not everybody is an intelligent shopper.

387
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:17,840
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I still pretty much think the Wii U is going to be a better seller.

388
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:19,146
[SPEAKER_10]: PlayStation 4

389
00:34:42,898 --> 00:34:44,979
[SPEAKER_10]: PlayStation 4 will outsell all of them.

390
00:34:45,479 --> 00:34:52,883
[SPEAKER_10]: I think, if anything, you can still have Xbox 360 selling more than Xbox One and probably the Wii U as well.

391
00:34:53,503 --> 00:34:59,446
[SPEAKER_10]: Just because... No, they have a lot of exclusives for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

392
00:34:59,486 --> 00:35:03,208
[SPEAKER_10]: And honestly, I don't see Wii U as next-gen.

393
00:35:03,348 --> 00:35:03,808
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

394
00:35:03,908 --> 00:35:06,569
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still up graphically and performance-wise.

395
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:08,810
[SPEAKER_10]: It's on par with the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, so...

396
00:35:11,092 --> 00:35:15,436
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just like, I don't know, in-between gen or something, whatever you want to call it.

397
00:35:16,016 --> 00:35:26,586
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to say Wii U sells more this holiday season because of households with children under 12 and the parents that will have the fond memories of Nintendo and so forth.

398
00:35:26,626 --> 00:35:30,269
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think a lot of the hardcore gamers, I think a lot of them are going Sony.

399
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:32,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Xbox fans, but what's that?

400
00:35:34,751 --> 00:35:42,597
[SPEAKER_10]: But it doesn't really matter though because they don't need to buy a new system though for these games that they're wanting to play.

401
00:35:42,697 --> 00:35:46,740
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone eats up Skylanders and everybody is probably going to eat up Disney Infinity.

402
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,881
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are both on Wii.

403
00:35:49,482 --> 00:35:50,303
[SPEAKER_10]: You're going to have...

404
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:55,142
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if there's, I mean, it's another Mario game.

405
00:35:55,182 --> 00:35:58,784
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, how many Mario games are we going to have come out, you know, already?

406
00:35:59,504 --> 00:36:04,427
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not, I don't think it's that, like, amazing that, you know, 3D Land is coming out.

407
00:36:04,467 --> 00:36:08,669
[SPEAKER_10]: It just, it looks kind of like a slightly better version of the 3DS one.

408
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:14,013
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's not a big, once again, not a big deal for me because that was just like New Super Mario Bros.

409
00:36:14,033 --> 00:36:14,053
[SPEAKER_10]: U.

410
00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:21,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the big reason, the other big reason why I think Wii U is going to go over better than Xbox One.

411
00:36:21,988 --> 00:36:25,169
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like you were saying, but this is apart from brand recognition.

412
00:36:25,709 --> 00:36:27,689
[SPEAKER_02]: You also do have a known quantity.

413
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:41,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas they are making so many different changes with the Xbone that I think that a lot of people are going to go towards something that they, as a consumer, can put more trust in.

414
00:36:42,392 --> 00:36:44,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's see what the listeners think.

415
00:36:46,471 --> 00:36:49,853
[SPEAKER_06]: live.vognetwork.com and answer this live poll right now.

416
00:36:49,933 --> 00:36:52,615
[SPEAKER_06]: What will sell more this holiday season?

417
00:36:53,476 --> 00:36:55,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Your options are Wii U or Xbox One.

418
00:36:57,699 --> 00:36:59,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Asking the questions of cynical gamers everywhere.

419
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,382
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going to sell out of the two underdogs?

420
00:37:03,772 --> 00:37:04,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Dreamcast!

421
00:37:04,872 --> 00:37:05,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Dreamcast!

422
00:37:29,977 --> 00:37:32,978
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that might be something to sell people on the system.

423
00:37:33,038 --> 00:37:37,279
[SPEAKER_10]: But a game that's basically an upgrade of a 3DS game, I don't think that's that.

424
00:37:37,919 --> 00:37:40,840
[SPEAKER_10]: It didn't really work too well for New Super Mario Bros.

425
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:50,743
[SPEAKER_10]: U. And I don't think it's going to work too well for New Luigi U. So why is a third Mario game that's just a platformer that doesn't really seem that different from what's already out there?

426
00:37:51,403 --> 00:37:52,703
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think that's going to be a system seller.

427
00:37:52,743 --> 00:37:53,304
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the thing.

428
00:37:53,464 --> 00:37:54,264
[SPEAKER_10]: Mario Kart, anything?

429
00:37:55,184 --> 00:37:55,804
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Mario Kart.

430
00:37:56,304 --> 00:37:57,905
[SPEAKER_02]: No 3DO Ikuma JP.

431
00:37:58,959 --> 00:38:02,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we will get to the results of our live poll right after our gaming weeks.

432
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:07,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's try to keep them a little bit shorter tonight because we had a lot of E3 talk, but DarkSakura, what have you been tapped into this week?

433
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:12,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we busted out the Atari 5200 for Atari Party coming up, getting everything working.

434
00:38:12,341 --> 00:38:14,162
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was some pango going on in my house, Rob.

435
00:38:14,402 --> 00:38:14,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

436
00:38:14,742 --> 00:38:15,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Thought you would have liked it.

437
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:15,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Loves it.

438
00:38:15,963 --> 00:38:16,683
[SPEAKER_02]: And Super Pac-Man.

439
00:38:17,343 --> 00:38:21,465
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have Millipede because we have some prototype re-releases.

440
00:38:22,265 --> 00:38:30,388
[SPEAKER_02]: I could not play Mass Effect 3 because I've been in the middle of upgrading all of my graphics in it so that it looks even more gorgeous, even if it's not the best story-wise.

441
00:38:30,828 --> 00:38:33,689
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing the first Mass Effect and I played it on the stream on Thursday.

442
00:38:34,849 --> 00:38:41,233
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm probably going to end up getting it beaten on the stream next Thursday if I feel like it.

443
00:38:43,474 --> 00:38:50,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Really not... Oh yeah, Final Fantasy XIV because we had a beta weekend and I have a Thaumaturge.

444
00:38:50,678 --> 00:38:51,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, we can talk about that now, huh?

445
00:38:51,878 --> 00:38:52,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we can.

446
00:38:52,879 --> 00:38:54,840
[SPEAKER_02]: We just can't say anything about last beta.

447
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I didn't play in this beta weekend so I guess I can't really say anything.

448
00:38:58,182 --> 00:39:02,124
[SPEAKER_10]: I just got my invite for PlayStation 3 so I will have to download it.

449
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:25,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think that, honestly, after as long as I played WoW, it has everything that I liked in Cataclysm, because that's what got me playing WoW, and none of the utter grinding crap that's in, um, you know, Panda, Panda version, Pandaria, Stupid Pandas, Gummy Bears, Gummy Bears, WoW Gummy Bear Edition.

450
00:39:26,371 --> 00:39:31,193
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, I'm really enjoying it, and I like playing my cat girl, or my Mikote, or whatever she's called.

451
00:39:31,493 --> 00:39:32,174
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a cat girl.

452
00:39:32,334 --> 00:39:32,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Mithra.

453
00:39:33,419 --> 00:39:35,100
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty funny.

454
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:35,260
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.

455
00:40:02,787 --> 00:40:08,592
[SPEAKER_10]: I played literally one session of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 this week.

456
00:40:08,953 --> 00:40:14,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Because every other time I was just basically reading E3 news, all my coworkers were gone.

457
00:40:14,738 --> 00:40:16,739
[SPEAKER_10]: So I didn't get to play with anybody.

458
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,643
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was working on 3D modeling in the meantime.

459
00:40:21,183 --> 00:40:23,165
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, I didn't play anything.

460
00:40:23,325 --> 00:40:25,727
[SPEAKER_10]: I did buy, though, the... What was it?

461
00:40:25,807 --> 00:40:25,987
[SPEAKER_10]: The...

462
00:40:27,228 --> 00:40:30,449
[SPEAKER_10]: Serious Sam Collection on Humble Bundle, the weekly sale.

463
00:40:30,509 --> 00:40:31,310
[SPEAKER_10]: So I got that.

464
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,151
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck, I never got a Humble Bundle 8 and it's done, huh?

465
00:40:36,172 --> 00:40:36,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

466
00:40:36,732 --> 00:40:37,012
[SPEAKER_10]: Shit.

467
00:40:37,432 --> 00:40:37,672
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, well.

468
00:40:37,872 --> 00:40:38,472
[SPEAKER_10]: That was my bad.

469
00:40:38,953 --> 00:40:39,993
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, well.

470
00:40:40,853 --> 00:40:42,254
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, that was pretty cool.

471
00:40:42,534 --> 00:40:43,814
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't have to buy Humble Bundle 9.

472
00:40:44,035 --> 00:40:44,635
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe they'll throw an 8.

473
00:40:44,695 --> 00:40:45,775
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's true.

474
00:40:45,835 --> 00:40:46,095
[SPEAKER_10]: It's true.

475
00:40:47,916 --> 00:40:54,261
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, I haven't ever played any of that series, but it looked cool, so I wanted to pick that up, and I thought it was a good deal.

476
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:55,522
[SPEAKER_10]: What else?

477
00:40:56,683 --> 00:41:00,305
[SPEAKER_10]: I bought PlayStation Plus for a year.

478
00:41:00,325 --> 00:41:07,911
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't redeemed it yet, though, but I'm looking forward to trying out the free games that are on there and stuff, because I have a 500 gig hard drive to fill up with games I haven't played yet.

479
00:41:09,532 --> 00:41:15,677
[SPEAKER_10]: And I pre-ordered PlayStation 4, because I'm worried that I may not be able to get one if I don't.

480
00:41:16,077 --> 00:41:16,978
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I did.

481
00:41:18,815 --> 00:41:26,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and just to say, for those of us who are playing Final Fantasy XIV and want to join us on a beta weekend, we are on the North American Behemoth server.

482
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:27,559
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

483
00:41:27,579 --> 00:41:28,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have a link shell yet?

484
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:29,901
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have a link shell yet.

485
00:41:30,161 --> 00:41:34,883
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can only add friends if they're online at the same time, so I couldn't get anybody.

486
00:41:35,365 --> 00:41:38,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Remind me later to talk to you about Facebook things.

487
00:41:38,087 --> 00:41:40,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless Shane Alinko happens to be listening, then you know what to do.

488
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:41,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

489
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:43,931
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as Loki's concerned.

490
00:41:44,611 --> 00:41:45,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Which I think I did see him in chat earlier.

491
00:41:46,332 --> 00:41:47,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so my gaming week.

492
00:41:47,353 --> 00:41:54,978
[SPEAKER_06]: So, even though Orange Launch Radio, the world's longest weekly internet show about video games, is not a recognized media outfit of E3...

493
00:41:55,738 --> 00:41:58,001
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

494
00:42:16,299 --> 00:42:19,241
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like the first game I walked up to and I'm like, alright, so tell me about your game.

495
00:42:19,261 --> 00:42:21,843
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's like, well, it's like a rhythm game.

496
00:42:22,504 --> 00:42:23,564
[SPEAKER_06]: He goes, it's hard to explain.

497
00:42:23,584 --> 00:42:26,326
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like, it's a rhythm game mixed with a roguelike.

498
00:42:26,506 --> 00:42:29,928
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, this sounds like the perfect game right up my alley.

499
00:42:29,989 --> 00:42:31,970
[SPEAKER_06]: I love dungeon crawlers and I love rhythm games.

500
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:33,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell me more, sir.

501
00:42:33,692 --> 00:42:35,093
[SPEAKER_06]: So he actually showed me the game.

502
00:42:35,153 --> 00:42:37,476
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, it is a rhythm game mixed with a roguelike.

503
00:42:37,496 --> 00:42:41,901
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a dungeon crawler, but you attack to the beat of the music in your little combos.

504
00:42:41,941 --> 00:42:46,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Like when you want to do a combo, you hold down the trigger and little beat patterns show over your sword.

505
00:42:46,646 --> 00:42:48,007
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can kind of do the little patterns.

506
00:42:48,268 --> 00:42:50,090
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you do it right, you do like an AoE attack.

507
00:42:50,430 --> 00:43:16,677
[SPEAKER_06]: so it was kind of cool yeah it was cute i liked it uh so i have my eye on that like if i'm gonna get a new year which i might depending on finances uh i would definitely pick up Sylfjord i like that that was fun um he did say if i heard the guy correctly he said though it's it's going to be a difficult game and if you die you die it's like dark souls you go all the way back to start so you know that whole thing so uh that'll be interesting to see what happens um

508
00:43:18,214 --> 00:43:20,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, I saw another game called The Amazing Frog.

509
00:43:20,755 --> 00:43:21,615
[SPEAKER_06]: This game was weird.

510
00:43:22,836 --> 00:43:23,056
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

511
00:43:23,376 --> 00:43:25,357
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I want to know about this one, because I've heard of it.

512
00:43:25,677 --> 00:43:32,700
[SPEAKER_06]: It looked weird to me, and I'm going to admit, it's a game where you can tell the graphics on the Ouya are a little bit behind.

513
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:36,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the other two games, like Soul Fjord, looked like any other Xbox Live Arcade game to me.

514
00:43:36,801 --> 00:43:37,682
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like cartoony.

515
00:43:37,822 --> 00:43:38,842
[SPEAKER_06]: It looked like that to me.

516
00:43:39,703 --> 00:43:44,204
[SPEAKER_06]: I could tell The Amazing Frog was a little weaker graphically.

517
00:43:44,244 --> 00:43:45,605
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's not the developer's fault.

518
00:43:45,645 --> 00:43:47,906
[SPEAKER_10]: I hear the game has really loud boomboxes in it.

519
00:43:48,486 --> 00:43:50,107
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't figure it out.

520
00:43:50,567 --> 00:43:57,390
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like this open world frog runner game and all you can do with the controller is you jump and you fling.

521
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:02,552
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like this big open playground and you can fling yourself on a trampoline and go flying.

522
00:44:02,952 --> 00:44:03,592
[SPEAKER_06]: It is the type of...

523
00:44:03,692 --> 00:44:05,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Open World shit you would eat right up, Loki.

524
00:44:21,567 --> 00:44:22,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Chrono Blade

525
00:44:42,489 --> 00:45:00,236
[SPEAKER_06]: and I looked at it because it looked like Diablo from afar and I'm like because I had like the little red and blue potions in the corner you know I'm like oh this is like a Diablo clone so I went to play it and it's apparently a free-to-play game it's not just on Ouya they have a web browser based thing that's in closed beta right now well here's the thing it looks like Diablo from a distance it plays like the Ninja Turtles arcade game

526
00:45:00,356 --> 00:45:24,677
[SPEAKER_06]: that's awesome like to me it was like a beat-em-up with like the jump and the punch and all that and you could do like the special moves and as you beat people up you you gain magic so that's what it felt like to me and I was like all right this is and then the guy was kind enough to give me a closed beta key so I was like I think I will be cashing that in that looks like fun uh you can get more information on that one at facebook.com slash chronoblade online all one word I imagine they're giving away a

527
00:45:26,398 --> 00:45:30,563
[SPEAKER_06]: SoulFjord.com was the other game and I didn't get a website or anything for Amazing Frog.

528
00:45:30,623 --> 00:45:31,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, but Google it.

529
00:45:31,785 --> 00:45:32,486
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure you'll find it.

530
00:45:32,506 --> 00:45:38,333
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, SoulFjord is the folks behind Quantum Conundrum and that kind of stuff.

531
00:45:38,833 --> 00:45:40,475
[SPEAKER_10]: So, they make some pretty awesome games.

532
00:45:42,277 --> 00:45:42,397
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

533
00:45:43,218 --> 00:46:05,485
[SPEAKER_06]: uh there you go those are i mean other than that lots of animal crossing but not enough to even like pay off my second loan like i just there's too much street passing i did a lot of street passing i sat in the lobby at e3 while i waited for bobby blackwolf because he he took his time which i understand he was trying to get answers to questions was fishing up a demo he took his time and i just street passed over and over i literally got like 120 puzzle pieces over the weekend

534
00:46:06,666 --> 00:46:12,831
[SPEAKER_06]: I completed like two puzzles and yeah, I'm only like 80 panels away from full completion.

535
00:46:12,871 --> 00:46:14,312
[SPEAKER_06]: So that made me excited.

536
00:46:15,594 --> 00:46:15,994
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

537
00:46:17,115 --> 00:46:23,520
[SPEAKER_06]: DungeonBuster in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, Uya didn't pay to be at E3 so they rented out a parking lot nearby and held their events there.

538
00:46:23,961 --> 00:46:28,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and the ESA rented a big truck and parked it right in front of the booth.

539
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:29,806
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of a dick move.

540
00:46:29,826 --> 00:46:31,067
[SPEAKER_06]: That was kind of a dick move.

541
00:46:31,127 --> 00:46:31,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it was...

542
00:46:32,268 --> 00:46:34,471
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't that big a deal, honestly.

543
00:46:34,872 --> 00:46:43,084
[SPEAKER_06]: The Ouya thing was like, hey, we've got beer over here and some developers... I did not see the Ouya being pushed.

544
00:46:43,605 --> 00:46:47,430
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw developers making games on Ouya being pushed.

545
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:48,412
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I saw.

546
00:46:48,792 --> 00:46:49,152
[SPEAKER_06]: E3.VOGnetwork.com

547
00:47:15,918 --> 00:47:30,329
[SPEAKER_06]: basically flat out saying how to get Kingdom Hearts on Xbox if that's what you want, giving the answer to that a definitive price for the Disney Infinity figurines all figured out thanks to you guys and your questions at e3.vognetwork.com and more

548
00:47:31,397 --> 00:47:32,437
[SPEAKER_10]: I could have told you that though.

549
00:47:52,742 --> 00:47:58,725
[SPEAKER_10]: It all depends on what price drops on the Wii U side or even the Xbox One side and if they reverse their policy.

550
00:47:59,845 --> 00:48:01,546
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot of time.

551
00:48:03,927 --> 00:48:06,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Admittedly, that question was I said at the beginning.

552
00:48:06,708 --> 00:48:09,289
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the troll face skeptic question.

553
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:11,410
[SPEAKER_06]: But I thought it was a fun one to ask.

554
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:12,431
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you had fun answering it.

555
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:14,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Housekeeping.

556
00:48:15,672 --> 00:48:19,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Twitter.com slash OLR or our Facebook, Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

557
00:48:19,954 --> 00:48:28,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Next week on the program, June 23rd, 2013, our pal JV Mon will be here to help us celebrate 11 years of Orange Lounge Radio.

558
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:33,122
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is what's very interesting, too, is that June 23rd is the actual birthday.

559
00:48:33,162 --> 00:48:34,242
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't happen every year.

560
00:48:34,482 --> 00:48:36,203
[SPEAKER_06]: So every 11 years we can expect it to be.

561
00:48:36,384 --> 00:48:38,565
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like every five or six years, the way the leap years work.

562
00:48:38,625 --> 00:48:44,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but this is one of the few times we actually get to celebrate a birthday on our birthday.

563
00:48:44,528 --> 00:48:47,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I will have to convince somebody else to make murder brownies again.

564
00:48:47,909 --> 00:48:49,170
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be fantastic.

565
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:50,150
[SPEAKER_06]: So we hope you guys will join us.

566
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:51,471
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not planning anything.

567
00:48:51,631 --> 00:48:54,492
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you get to a certain age and you just kind of stop caring.

568
00:48:55,452 --> 00:48:56,492
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't say you stop caring.

569
00:48:56,732 --> 00:48:57,313
[SPEAKER_06]: I shouldn't say that.

570
00:48:57,393 --> 00:48:58,073
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we are.

571
00:48:58,213 --> 00:48:58,653
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

572
00:48:58,693 --> 00:49:00,774
[SPEAKER_02]: How about I quote the amazing Wanda Sykes?

573
00:49:01,374 --> 00:49:03,335
[SPEAKER_02]: The older I get, the less of a fuck I give

574
00:49:25,169 --> 00:49:28,190
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll say, if you want to get us a cake, we'll eat it.

575
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:30,450
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we're going to say about next week's show.

576
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:33,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Preferably, I like carrot cake, just saying.

577
00:49:33,231 --> 00:49:35,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have confirmed our guest for two weeks from now?

578
00:49:35,712 --> 00:49:36,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Guest host in two weeks?

579
00:49:36,532 --> 00:49:37,112
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought we did.

580
00:49:37,252 --> 00:49:37,812
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we do.

581
00:49:38,192 --> 00:49:41,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of another transaction that's occurring around that?

582
00:49:41,433 --> 00:49:47,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm just going to say, I am fully expecting that in two weeks, first make slide kick from Game Buoy will be here live.

583
00:49:47,715 --> 00:49:48,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Then that'll be a lot of fun.

584
00:49:48,815 --> 00:49:50,076
[SPEAKER_02]: And if not, we're going to go get him.

585
00:49:50,216 --> 00:49:53,378
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to razz the crap out of him on his old show, Fabulous Times.

586
00:49:53,398 --> 00:49:54,919
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to duct tape him to a buoy.

587
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:55,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

588
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:57,081
[SPEAKER_02]: And bring him along with us.

589
00:49:57,361 --> 00:49:57,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Good times.

590
00:49:58,001 --> 00:49:58,282
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

591
00:50:00,203 --> 00:50:02,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Tune in live every Sunday for the antics.

592
00:50:02,264 --> 00:50:06,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Live.VogNetwork.com I'm hoping we can start lining up some interviews, too, now that E3's over.

593
00:50:06,567 --> 00:50:08,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I definitely want to talk to some of these Ouya guys.

594
00:50:08,989 --> 00:50:13,172
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, whatever else we can get now that people are going to be really in that rush, too.

595
00:50:13,212 --> 00:50:14,673
[SPEAKER_06]: I get people to pre-order for the holiday.

596
00:50:14,693 --> 00:50:15,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

597
00:50:15,413 --> 00:50:16,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's run down more news.

598
00:50:17,054 --> 00:50:18,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe some things you missed, maybe not.

599
00:50:18,936 --> 00:50:21,138
[SPEAKER_06]: Some clarifications, setting people straight.

600
00:50:21,478 --> 00:50:22,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, why don't you start us off with the news?

601
00:50:22,999 --> 00:50:25,301
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Major Nelson was answering a bunch of questions.

602
00:50:26,041 --> 00:50:31,606
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that he even did like a thing on NeoGAF where he was answering questions for people and stuff, posting on there.

603
00:50:32,146 --> 00:50:32,927
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

604
00:51:02,289 --> 00:51:03,050
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

605
00:51:21,443 --> 00:51:24,447
[SPEAKER_10]: No, they're too stubborn to change their mind so far.

606
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:38,265
[SPEAKER_10]: But I mean, then again, I mean, he was only being asked that a few days after, you know, the announcement and sales, I think sales figures that they're trailing way behind that could change things.

607
00:51:38,465 --> 00:52:03,151
[SPEAKER_06]: you guys have to understand that corporations and the talking heads for corporations have to stick to talking points at big shows like this and they have investors remember they are all trained on said talking points they don't deviate from those talking points and when they do that's why it's always news when somebody goes off the cusp so you know they always stick to their talking points by the way I was checking to see if Major Nelson had replied to what I told him

608
00:52:04,757 --> 00:52:06,898
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he's got a lot of people telling him things right now.

609
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:10,919
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought there was an interesting comment in chat from Ross Steel UT.

610
00:52:11,699 --> 00:52:16,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Major Nelson, the only community outreach guy left and he only stayed because he's a good enough yes man.

611
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:19,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Does Microsoft need their Kevin Butler right now?

612
00:52:22,101 --> 00:52:29,883
[SPEAKER_10]: Dude, if they brought Kevin Butler out on stage during that placing tour thing, I think everyone would have lost it.

613
00:52:30,163 --> 00:52:33,124
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I think would have been great for their presentation?

614
00:52:34,517 --> 00:52:35,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Bring Hard Gay out of retirement.

615
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:39,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Have them just go around humping everybody and going, Woo!

616
00:52:40,425 --> 00:52:42,328
[SPEAKER_02]: That would have sold Xbox Ones right there.

617
00:52:42,348 --> 00:52:43,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God.

618
00:52:43,109 --> 00:52:43,369
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

619
00:52:45,272 --> 00:52:50,980
[SPEAKER_06]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase

620
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:52,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Cloud.

621
00:52:52,881 --> 00:52:56,864
[SPEAKER_06]: I only mentioned this game briefly, like really briefly, but obviously it's kind of a big deal.

622
00:52:56,944 --> 00:52:58,865
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's the game a lot of people were talking about before E3.

623
00:52:58,885 --> 00:53:00,606
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the big Microsoft announcement.

624
00:53:01,247 --> 00:53:02,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Killer Instinct.

625
00:53:02,928 --> 00:53:06,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Killer Instinct was revealed at the Microsoft press briefing.

626
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:08,772
[SPEAKER_06]: And here's the whole thing.

627
00:53:08,812 --> 00:53:12,995
[SPEAKER_06]: It came out afterwards that Killer Instinct is going to be free to play.

628
00:53:13,874 --> 00:53:17,096
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're actually now saying that that might not actually be part of it.

629
00:53:17,677 --> 00:53:19,078
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some clarifications coming out.

630
00:53:19,698 --> 00:53:28,424
[SPEAKER_06]: It's said that the game is going to be free to play, and when it launches on Xbox One, you can get Jago for free, and then you can buy all the other characters.

631
00:53:28,784 --> 00:53:33,867
[SPEAKER_06]: However, what's not being said, the full game will also be available on its release.

632
00:53:34,328 --> 00:53:43,674
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you don't want to do the whole nickel and dime model for only certain characters, then you can drop the assumably $60 and get the whole thing unlocked at once.

633
00:53:44,595 --> 00:53:47,997
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually think this model isn't as terrible as everyone says it is.

634
00:53:48,077 --> 00:53:51,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that we have the clarification that you can still get the game out of the box.

635
00:53:51,299 --> 00:53:53,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's basically a demo, but it's an upgradable demo.

636
00:53:54,881 --> 00:53:58,104
[SPEAKER_10]: You're in a pretty good situation if your favorite character is Jago.

637
00:53:58,804 --> 00:54:00,245
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what it reminds me of?

638
00:54:00,305 --> 00:54:09,291
[SPEAKER_06]: It reminds me of the Rock Band game on PSP where you could download the demo and you could download songs from the marketplace and play them in the demo.

639
00:54:09,731 --> 00:54:13,674
[SPEAKER_06]: You never had to buy the full game unless you wanted the full game's song list.

640
00:54:15,115 --> 00:54:16,675
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, it kind of reminds me of that.

641
00:54:16,775 --> 00:54:17,936
[SPEAKER_06]: So, interesting.

642
00:54:18,656 --> 00:54:22,578
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, Double Helix also has unveiled Glacius as another character in the game.

643
00:54:23,318 --> 00:54:24,679
[SPEAKER_06]: He will be playable at EVO 2013.

644
00:54:25,019 --> 00:54:29,761
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also going to be 40 training lessons in the game to teach players about the game.

645
00:54:29,842 --> 00:54:40,887
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a little disappointing that Double Helix, the folks behind the latest Silent Hill game, are making this game and not Rare, the company behind very awesome games.

646
00:54:42,675 --> 00:54:46,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Kubica Jeremy in chat says, then why even focus on the free-to-play thing?

647
00:54:46,058 --> 00:54:47,560
[SPEAKER_06]: They should have made that clear right away.

648
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:50,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Like everything they've been saying, they need to be crystal clear.

649
00:54:50,683 --> 00:54:54,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's a great example of what happens when somebody doesn't stick to talking points.

650
00:54:54,967 --> 00:55:08,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I think somebody made a one-off comment about this to a press site, and here we go, gaming industry, copy-paste, copy-paste, copy-paste, copy-paste, it's free-to-play, free-to-play, free-to-play, free-to-play, based off one guy that went off the page.

651
00:55:11,232 --> 00:55:19,280
[SPEAKER_06]: and that's why you didn't see Microsoft doing a backpedaling or an about face at E3 there is not time to change the script

652
00:55:20,725 --> 00:55:21,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Silent Hill Homecoming

653
00:55:44,468 --> 00:55:48,471
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

654
00:56:02,743 --> 00:56:14,667
[SPEAKER_02]: And this new version, while I'm mildly interested in it, it doesn't seem like it's going to be... It was about the only thing that they mentioned that made me perk up at all, and it was only for the nostalgia's sake.

655
00:56:15,008 --> 00:56:16,328
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think they can really bank on that.

656
00:56:17,051 --> 00:56:22,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's kind of one of those things where it's like, oh, I'd love to check it out if I was going to get an Xbox One, but I'm not going to right now.

657
00:56:22,895 --> 00:56:26,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I'll get an Xbox One in a year, and I think that's what'll end up happening.

658
00:56:26,818 --> 00:56:33,282
[SPEAKER_06]: And to be fair, folks, I bought the 360 at launch, well, soon after launch, and I waited a year to get a PlayStation 3.

659
00:56:33,842 --> 00:56:35,203
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just that in reverse.

660
00:56:35,243 --> 00:56:40,607
[SPEAKER_10]: On the topic of that, they redesigned the 360 to look like the Xbox One, and I think it's fucking ugly.

661
00:56:40,827 --> 00:56:43,489
[SPEAKER_10]: That console looks not good anymore.

662
00:56:44,143 --> 00:56:46,263
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we've... I've talked about this on the show before.

663
00:56:46,283 --> 00:56:48,584
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we focus way too much on the looks of consoles.

664
00:56:49,344 --> 00:56:50,444
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not that big a deal.

665
00:56:50,584 --> 00:56:56,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, a lot of people were talking about the PlayStation 4 and its weird shape, and I'm just like, all right, so it's oddly shaped.

666
00:56:56,105 --> 00:56:56,865
[SPEAKER_06]: But here's the thing, though.

667
00:56:57,406 --> 00:57:00,926
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that it's vertical or horizontal again, and you can put it wherever you want.

668
00:57:01,006 --> 00:57:01,706
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.

669
00:57:01,886 --> 00:57:07,327
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the thing, though, is why would you redesign your current-gen console to make it look like the Xbox One?

670
00:57:07,767 --> 00:57:10,508
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to be confusing now because people are going to say...

671
00:57:10,808 --> 00:57:12,729
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, I saw that console on TV.

672
00:57:12,789 --> 00:57:13,489
[SPEAKER_10]: Which console is it?

673
00:57:13,549 --> 00:57:14,630
[SPEAKER_10]: It's one of the Xboxes.

674
00:57:14,910 --> 00:57:15,590
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it's this one.

675
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:20,213
[SPEAKER_10]: And they get a 360, you know, because... You don't think the name is right there on the front?

676
00:57:21,153 --> 00:57:25,495
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they're going to see the 360 with the new branding and say, oh, that looks fun.

677
00:57:25,935 --> 00:57:30,717
[SPEAKER_02]: And whoever is going to be selling them the system is going to point out the more expensive newest one.

678
00:57:33,279 --> 00:57:33,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow...

679
00:57:34,594 --> 00:57:38,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the redesign is weird, but I'm kind of like, I just don't care.

680
00:57:38,742 --> 00:57:42,108
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so much more to worry about with these consoles than the look.

681
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:43,851
[SPEAKER_02]: And Rob, Betamax forever.

682
00:57:44,633 --> 00:57:45,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

683
00:57:45,354 --> 00:57:45,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Move on.

684
00:57:45,815 --> 00:57:46,336
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.

685
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I got other stuff.

686
00:57:48,464 --> 00:58:00,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Now this one, it's a little bit more falls into the conspiracy theory part of... I don't really know exactly how to think about it, but the first time I saw this article, it really made me raise my eyebrow.

687
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:06,093
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an article of a guy named Jason.

688
00:58:06,313 --> 00:58:08,054
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to see what his full name is.

689
00:58:09,114 --> 00:58:14,777
[SPEAKER_02]: But he was basically at E3 taking photos of the Microsoft booth and

690
00:58:15,497 --> 00:58:32,026
[SPEAKER_02]: or some of the gaming booths and he took a picture of a laptop being hooked up and he got pulled aside and was told to delete the photo which he actually went back and redrew of basically the games running off of laptops and PCs.

691
00:58:32,546 --> 00:58:38,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there was a big stink going on about this on the GameFAQs board and

692
00:58:39,109 --> 00:59:06,083
[SPEAKER_02]: which I was reading through and they're saying no those can't be dev kits they are running off of NVIDIA cards which as far as I was aware let me see if I can the NVIDIA GTX cards which as far as I was aware wasn't supposed to be incorporated into the final system so they're saying that they weren't actually running off of the development PCs these were running off of regular PCs and they even had the games crash the PCs and

693
00:59:06,986 --> 00:59:07,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

694
00:59:24,069 --> 00:59:25,250
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

695
00:59:25,990 --> 00:59:26,871
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be honest.

696
00:59:27,351 --> 00:59:35,999
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's a real desire in the gaming community right now to just dogpile Microsoft and let's kick the bastards while they're down for daring to fuck with my used games.

697
00:59:36,919 --> 00:59:37,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Beat them up.

698
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:41,783
[SPEAKER_06]: But then again, Microsoft should have left that guy alone when he took the picture.

699
00:59:41,803 --> 00:59:43,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's the other thing.

700
00:59:43,245 --> 00:59:44,806
[SPEAKER_02]: That thread on GameFAQs is gone.

701
00:59:45,464 --> 00:59:47,945
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I don't understand how they could say, you better delete that photo.

702
00:59:47,965 --> 00:59:48,965
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd be like, you better fuck off.

703
00:59:48,985 --> 00:59:50,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on, let me see if I can find it.

704
00:59:52,066 --> 00:59:56,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, a guard stood outside to keep me from freaking out and making a run for it.

705
00:59:56,307 --> 01:00:00,228
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple Microsoft PR folks came in, large forced smiles on their faces.

706
01:00:00,268 --> 01:00:01,488
[SPEAKER_02]: They just wanted to talk to me.

707
01:00:02,228 --> 01:00:06,589
[SPEAKER_02]: And then going, they made the big point of telling me they were not telling me to delete the photos.

708
01:00:06,629 --> 01:00:10,370
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because they really couldn't since they never said what could or couldn't be photos.

709
01:00:10,390 --> 01:00:12,971
[SPEAKER_02]: But they also didn't want me to leave that little room with those photos.

710
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:17,806
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the news story here.

711
01:00:17,907 --> 01:00:20,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Microsoft made a big deal out of something that shouldn't have been a big deal.

712
01:00:21,988 --> 01:00:24,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's just a few lines.

713
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:25,490
[SPEAKER_02]: It was weird.

714
01:00:25,510 --> 01:00:35,314
[SPEAKER_02]: They were clearly unhappy and concerned even though they insisted that laptop was just controlling a looping video which it certainly may have been doing which makes it even weirder that they were so upset at the photos.

715
01:00:35,814 --> 01:00:42,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Not being able to take their intense stares and restrained desire to yank the camera out of my hands any longer I just deleted the photos.

716
01:00:42,137 --> 01:00:42,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they set me free.

717
01:00:44,538 --> 01:00:48,180
[SPEAKER_02]: He redrew the... And I'm actually... I'm going to go ahead and link this article for everybody.

718
01:00:49,341 --> 01:00:50,261
[SPEAKER_02]: It was on Gizmodo.

719
01:00:50,961 --> 01:00:52,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, the Australian Gizmodo site.

720
01:00:53,663 --> 01:00:57,665
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm going to link it in the chat room because it really is worth giving a good read over.

721
01:00:57,705 --> 01:00:59,266
[SPEAKER_02]: And he drew a copy of the photo.

722
01:01:02,228 --> 01:01:09,129
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't seem like it would be anything, but what makes it most suspicious is that they made a big stink out of it.

723
01:01:09,729 --> 01:01:19,291
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if they had just said, oh, whatever, you know, it's sort of like when you tell the little kid they can't have something and then the kid thinks that that's something big and that they're going to sneak and get it.

724
01:01:19,831 --> 01:01:21,692
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that same type of thing.

725
01:01:21,732 --> 01:01:28,773
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes it a bigger deal than what, you know, if it wasn't a big deal, why are they trying to restrain this guy and browbeat him into deleting a photo?

726
01:01:29,033 --> 01:01:31,294
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet you the PS4s are running off PCs, too.

727
01:01:31,534 --> 01:01:32,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.

728
01:01:32,294 --> 01:01:33,455
[SPEAKER_06]: All the dev kits are PCs.

729
01:01:33,835 --> 01:01:40,517
[SPEAKER_02]: But if these aren't exactly the dev kits, if they are trying to run it off of a more beefed-up system, then we have a problem.

730
01:01:40,877 --> 01:01:46,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well... Especially if they're saying that they're being run off of the system hardware.

731
01:01:46,259 --> 01:01:52,002
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a huge risk, too, because if the game that comes out doesn't match what was played at E3, the people that played at E3 are going to call it out.

732
01:01:52,482 --> 01:01:54,943
[SPEAKER_10]: It is Colonial Marines all over again!

733
01:01:56,203 --> 01:01:58,304
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's Gearbox not making the game, so they're okay, right?

734
01:01:59,571 --> 01:02:00,272
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

735
01:02:00,792 --> 01:02:01,133
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

736
01:02:01,233 --> 01:02:02,034
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyhow, let's move on.

737
01:02:02,074 --> 01:02:02,314
[SPEAKER_10]: Loki.

738
01:02:02,935 --> 01:02:03,295
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

739
01:02:03,435 --> 01:02:06,178
[SPEAKER_10]: So, hey, you want that Xbox One?

740
01:02:06,238 --> 01:02:13,686
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you better be living in certain regions of the world because it only supports a few different countries.

741
01:02:15,527 --> 01:02:22,314
[SPEAKER_10]: So at launch, if you're living in a good portion of Asia, well, you're fucked.

742
01:02:23,876 --> 01:02:46,714
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically, the only places, countries that you can access Xbox Live at launch can be Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and the U.S.,

743
01:02:48,827 --> 01:02:49,447
[SPEAKER_10]: No Japan.

744
01:02:50,327 --> 01:02:50,848
[SPEAKER_06]: No Japan.

745
01:02:51,068 --> 01:02:59,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though the first developer up, Japanese developer, and I think the only Japanese developer that showed up at E3's press conference, which I also found interesting.

746
01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:03,711
[SPEAKER_06]: I found it very interesting who was at what press conference.

747
01:03:03,751 --> 01:03:07,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you notice there was no EA at Sony's conference?

748
01:03:08,332 --> 01:03:10,233
[SPEAKER_06]: And that they were showing the 2K sports game instead.

749
01:03:10,273 --> 01:03:11,533
[SPEAKER_06]: I just thought it was interesting.

750
01:03:11,593 --> 01:03:12,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Just put it out there.

751
01:03:12,293 --> 01:03:13,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Thought it was very interesting.

752
01:03:13,994 --> 01:03:14,814
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's noteworthy.

753
01:03:17,297 --> 01:03:17,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Noted.

754
01:03:18,619 --> 01:03:19,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Noted, yeah.

755
01:03:20,862 --> 01:03:21,122
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

756
01:03:22,263 --> 01:03:24,186
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think, though, about the fact that they left Japan off?

757
01:03:25,627 --> 01:03:26,869
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not trying anymore.

758
01:03:26,889 --> 01:03:30,353
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we all knew that Microsoft was going to write them off.

759
01:03:31,154 --> 01:03:33,276
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, a lot of great games come out of Japan.

760
01:03:33,457 --> 01:03:35,379
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a little weird to me.

761
01:03:35,399 --> 01:03:36,680
[SPEAKER_10]: It seems like a lot of them...

762
01:03:37,341 --> 01:03:38,382
[SPEAKER_10]: It's disrespect in being uninclusive.

763
01:03:59,656 --> 01:04:02,218
[SPEAKER_10]: They're just like, too bad, you can't conform to what we want.

764
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:13,148
[SPEAKER_10]: So, hey, you guys, and I heard the argument from fanboys saying, well, hey, they had broadband internet on the original Xbox, that was the only way, no dial-up, and people still bought it.

765
01:04:13,649 --> 01:04:14,590
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but you know what?

766
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:22,957
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a little different to, I don't know if it's an equal comparison, because you can still play games offline with the original Xbox.

767
01:04:23,157 --> 01:04:25,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think IkumaJP pretty much nailed it.

768
01:04:25,339 --> 01:04:26,000
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't care now.

769
01:04:27,202 --> 01:04:36,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's just interesting to me because, and I realize, you know, and I see a lot of folks overall in chat are saying, like, well, Microsoft gave up on Japan a long time ago, but I'm kind of like, okay.

770
01:04:36,024 --> 01:04:38,204
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think Japan was ever really into Microsoft.

771
01:04:38,324 --> 01:04:45,966
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, but, again, the first developer, first trailer to show up at the Microsoft thing, Japanese developers.

772
01:04:46,506 --> 01:04:53,087
[SPEAKER_06]: What was the biggest response at a Sony's press conference beside the whole, you know, going for the jugular on Microsoft's policy?

773
01:04:53,567 --> 01:04:56,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Two games developed by a Japanese studio.

774
01:04:57,188 --> 01:05:07,704
[SPEAKER_06]: That happened to be coming to Microsoft's system as well, but wasn't really pointed out I just thought it was interesting Noted Make a note That's all

775
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:09,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow.

776
01:05:11,981 --> 01:05:16,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this isn't from a Japanese developer, but it certainly got a lot of people excited anyway.

777
01:05:16,483 --> 01:05:24,567
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a new Mirror's Edge game, and a lot of people had a sad when it didn't show up at Microsoft's thing or whatever.

778
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:30,110
[SPEAKER_06]: But then it showed up later, yay, at EA's press conference that a new Mirror's Edge game is in the works.

779
01:05:30,570 --> 01:05:36,012
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a reboot, actually, of the franchise, which is weird because there was only one game, so they're rebooting the one game.

780
01:05:36,032 --> 01:05:37,053
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's all right, you know.

781
01:05:38,233 --> 01:05:39,513
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be open world this time.

782
01:05:40,794 --> 01:05:47,115
[SPEAKER_06]: And a nice little letter posted on the official Mirror's Edge site from DICE senior producer Sarah Jansen.

783
01:05:47,575 --> 01:05:52,796
[SPEAKER_06]: We introduced Mirror's Edge and Faith to gamers five years ago, and we've waited for the right moment to reunite them.

784
01:05:53,176 --> 01:05:57,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks to the Frostbite engine, which a whole shit ton of those EA games are all running on.

785
01:05:58,097 --> 01:06:01,438
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like EA's bread and butter right now is that Frostbite engine, if you think about it.

786
01:06:02,258 --> 01:06:30,694
[SPEAKER_06]: and a new generation of platforms we are now able to deliver a richer world the players will be able to explore with a new level of freedom in both movement and action and a lot of people very excited about this and yeah I'm curious too you know I didn't like love the first game but I definitely respected it and I'm looking forward to this reimagining I am glad that it's multi-platform me too very cool moving on Dark Sakura and then release dates

787
01:06:31,781 --> 01:06:40,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we have, now, we sort of made a mention of this, I think, a little bit earlier, but we like Minecraft, don't we?

788
01:06:40,271 --> 01:06:41,372
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to hate Minecraft.

789
01:06:42,293 --> 01:06:42,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I love it.

790
01:06:43,054 --> 01:06:45,596
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't play it on Xbox, which now I'm glad that I don't.

791
01:06:45,697 --> 01:06:47,919
[SPEAKER_10]: And you definitely don't play it on the VOG Network server anymore.

792
01:06:47,939 --> 01:06:48,420
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

793
01:06:49,013 --> 01:06:51,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I did, but it wasn't always connecting.

794
01:06:52,656 --> 01:06:58,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here is a really crappy thing for all of you Xbox Minecraft fans.

795
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:00,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Your save's not going to carry over to the Xbone.

796
01:07:01,982 --> 01:07:02,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops!

797
01:07:03,743 --> 01:07:04,424
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not surprised.

798
01:07:04,464 --> 01:07:09,947
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm getting the sense that even though they're both Minecraft, they're still like separate games.

799
01:07:10,087 --> 01:07:12,509
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of the sense I'm getting from this.

800
01:07:13,310 --> 01:07:16,532
[SPEAKER_02]: They said that they were discussing it, but I don't think it's going to happen.

801
01:07:19,448 --> 01:07:25,776
[SPEAKER_02]: They really do seem to be trying to put this wedge of separation in between the 360 and the bone.

802
01:07:26,937 --> 01:07:34,447
[SPEAKER_10]: I just don't really see that as an issue just because it's just like if you were to have... I don't mean... I don't know...

803
01:07:36,078 --> 01:07:45,221
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be hard because those features that are on the original version of Minecraft, like your worlds and stuff, are going to be locked into a certain size and stuff.

804
01:07:45,241 --> 01:07:51,563
[SPEAKER_10]: And when you're putting in basically a redone engine, even though it is the same game, it's just not going to transfer over.

805
01:07:51,643 --> 01:07:52,944
[SPEAKER_10]: Just start anew.

806
01:07:53,284 --> 01:07:55,304
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, seriously, it's not that big a deal.

807
01:07:55,785 --> 01:07:56,225
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

808
01:07:56,985 --> 01:07:59,826
[SPEAKER_10]: But once again, I think it's that whole dogpile mentality.

809
01:08:00,106 --> 01:08:29,398
[SPEAKER_06]: but there are people who put a lot of time and effort into their crap on Minecraft I mean a game like Minecraft I'm actually like you know a lot of people have created these huge things and maybe Minecraft on Xbox One will fix some of the things like you know like you're not going to have the limits on the world size like 360 maybe it's going to fix some of these things but it would be nice if people could transfer their time and effort over I've seen people put a lot of effort into building some of the same monumental ginormous creations on Xbox as they have to doing on a PC

810
01:08:30,898 --> 01:08:32,359
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a shame not to be able to carry that over.

811
01:08:32,499 --> 01:08:36,262
[SPEAKER_06]: I think part of what makes this noteworthy is that it shouldn't be that fucking hard.

812
01:08:36,302 --> 01:08:37,243
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Minecraft.

813
01:08:38,184 --> 01:08:40,345
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not that... It's a Java game.

814
01:08:41,086 --> 01:08:41,326
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

815
01:08:41,366 --> 01:08:53,414
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not belittling what a huge impact Minecraft has been on gaming and the heavy hitter that it is as far as the game is concerned, but it doesn't seem like to me that it should be that big a fucking deal to transfer a save file over.

816
01:08:54,495 --> 01:08:56,956
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it should be at all.

817
01:08:57,697 --> 01:09:00,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any sort of cloud saving on Xbox?

818
01:09:00,198 --> 01:09:01,438
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't touched my Xbox in forever.

819
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:04,380
[SPEAKER_02]: So they've got a cloud saving feature.

820
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:07,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Why shouldn't they be able to transfer things over via cloud?

821
01:09:10,023 --> 01:09:11,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's a sad cloud.

822
01:09:12,364 --> 01:09:15,225
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a rain cloud.

823
01:09:15,645 --> 01:09:17,166
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a sad cloud that rains shit.

824
01:09:19,310 --> 01:09:26,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of the cloud, Brad from PodCulture says, Rob, I wonder how that DCU for the PS4 will tie in with the PS3 version, or even if it will.

825
01:09:27,177 --> 01:09:31,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Check Bobby's answers at e3.vognetwork.com because I believe he came back.

826
01:09:33,183 --> 01:09:39,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it you or somebody else had asked a question very similar to that, and I believe the response was, it is...

827
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:48,019
[SPEAKER_06]: You will be able to log in and it's the same just with new textures and everything you would expect from going up to the PlayStation 4.

828
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:51,023
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounded like the right answer, actually.

829
01:09:52,105 --> 01:09:53,046
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll put it that way.

830
01:09:53,306 --> 01:09:54,728
[SPEAKER_10]: I think everything did transfer over.

831
01:09:54,948 --> 01:09:55,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

832
01:09:56,209 --> 01:10:00,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's travel around the world and check out some games that are coming out a lot sooner than what we saw at E3.

833
01:10:01,210 --> 01:10:02,210
[SPEAKER_10]: Not a whole lot this week.

834
01:10:03,230 --> 01:10:04,191
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, some Vita stuff.

835
01:10:04,651 --> 01:10:07,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Jak and Daxter Collection coming out on the Vita.

836
01:10:08,331 --> 01:10:16,373
[SPEAKER_10]: Also this week, Muramasa Rebirth coming out on Vita as well.

837
01:10:16,873 --> 01:10:21,714
[SPEAKER_10]: And then Game & Wario one week from today.

838
01:10:23,579 --> 01:10:27,781
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't really want to start another game right now.

839
01:10:54,930 --> 01:10:55,471
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

840
01:11:11,888 --> 01:11:13,670
[SPEAKER_10]: Good job, Bobby, on ruining Loki's day.

841
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:19,894
[SPEAKER_10]: But, as they mentioned, or some digging, the PlayStation 4 will be region free.

842
01:11:20,034 --> 01:11:21,195
[SPEAKER_10]: And here's the weird thing, though.

843
01:11:21,255 --> 01:11:26,319
[SPEAKER_10]: It's region free both disc-based game and digital games.

844
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:30,682
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's not true, I think, right now on the PlayStation 3.

845
01:11:30,882 --> 01:11:34,745
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you can only buy stuff from certain regions, but apparently you can buy...

846
01:11:35,706 --> 01:11:41,449
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you have to create another account in that region, but that'd be kind of cool if I could buy Japanese games or something.

847
01:11:42,509 --> 01:11:47,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby Blackwell is in our chatroom right now at live.vognetwork.com wanting you to know he took a picture of the banner just for you, Loki.

848
01:11:48,032 --> 01:11:51,614
[SPEAKER_10]: It's alright, they're going to be coming to our game summit at the end of July.

849
01:11:52,754 --> 01:11:55,635
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, our rep over at, you know, Phillip Sales or whatever.

850
01:11:55,655 --> 01:11:57,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Justify, justify, justify.

851
01:11:58,016 --> 01:12:05,920
[SPEAKER_10]: She knows I'm a huge fan, and last year I got some fly swatters based on Insect Armageddon and stuff, so that's fine.

852
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:10,062
[SPEAKER_10]: I still have to play through Insect Armageddon that I got on one of those Humble Bundles or whatever, so...

853
01:12:11,262 --> 01:12:14,485
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's talk about release dates in Japan.

854
01:12:14,645 --> 01:12:18,248
[SPEAKER_06]: And on the PlayStation 3 this week, a new DualShock controller in a gray color.

855
01:12:18,428 --> 01:12:21,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, The Last of Us making its way to Japan, both on June 20th.

856
01:12:22,111 --> 01:12:26,915
[SPEAKER_06]: If, for whatever reason, The Last of Us is not up your alley, try Daisenraikyoku.

857
01:12:27,715 --> 01:12:28,516
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, I said that wrong.

858
01:12:28,576 --> 01:12:29,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Daisenraikyoku.

859
01:12:30,257 --> 01:12:31,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Daituokobushi.com.

860
01:12:35,964 --> 01:12:37,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that is the full name of the game.

861
01:12:37,747 --> 01:12:39,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Regular and luxury editions.

862
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:42,353
[SPEAKER_06]: You might have caught from the Tora Tora Tora in there.

863
01:12:42,774 --> 01:12:45,337
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a plain fight type game.

864
01:12:45,978 --> 01:12:46,339
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

865
01:12:47,569 --> 01:13:10,652
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that it's called a luxury edition that makes it seem regular and luxury it's luxurious does it come wrapped in silk on the Xbox 360 I will still cover releases on 360 in Japan as long as they're there Batman Arkham Twin Pack a repackaging assumably of the two Batman games for Japanese audiences there that's probably like a price drop type of thing

866
01:13:12,138 --> 01:13:13,759
[SPEAKER_06]: on the PlayStation Vita this week.

867
01:13:13,899 --> 01:13:14,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Quite a bit.

868
01:13:14,359 --> 01:13:16,821
[SPEAKER_06]: FIFA 13 World Class Soccer gets a price reduction.

869
01:13:17,681 --> 01:13:20,963
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, Winning Post 7 2013 comes out this week.

870
01:13:21,903 --> 01:13:27,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Also a new game, Kami Jaigen Idol Neptune PP in limited and regular editions.

871
01:13:28,647 --> 01:13:32,889
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think this looks like some type of, like it might be a music game.

872
01:13:34,690 --> 01:13:35,530
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't tell.

873
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:39,092
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's like a pop idol game.

874
01:13:41,673 --> 01:13:42,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie, help me.

875
01:13:42,374 --> 01:13:44,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you recognize anything from these screenshots here?

876
01:13:44,375 --> 01:13:45,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Like what type of game this might be?

877
01:13:45,516 --> 01:13:46,797
[SPEAKER_06]: This seems to be the most telling one.

878
01:13:47,077 --> 01:13:48,678
[SPEAKER_06]: You see the little things with the patterns on them?

879
01:13:49,218 --> 01:13:51,740
[SPEAKER_06]: And it seems like maybe it's... I don't know this one.

880
01:13:52,401 --> 01:13:52,821
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

881
01:13:53,041 --> 01:13:53,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

882
01:13:53,682 --> 01:13:54,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

883
01:13:54,122 --> 01:13:54,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe somebody in chat does.

884
01:13:54,922 --> 01:13:55,543
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the name again?

885
01:13:56,163 --> 01:13:57,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Kami, Jigen, Idol.

886
01:13:57,905 --> 01:13:59,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Jigen, Idol, Neptune, PP.

887
01:13:59,686 --> 01:14:00,466
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't know that one.

888
01:14:01,047 --> 01:14:02,548
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe AkumaJP or somebody in chat will know.

889
01:14:02,568 --> 01:14:03,208
[SPEAKER_02]: God, something, Idol.

890
01:14:04,149 --> 01:14:04,549
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

891
01:14:04,850 --> 01:14:07,071
[SPEAKER_06]: This is American Idol.

892
01:14:08,312 --> 01:14:09,513
[SPEAKER_06]: No Nicki Minaj in that game.

893
01:14:09,781 --> 01:14:21,851
[SPEAKER_10]: I did mention, I think that I mentioned this on Twitter actually because Nintendo does some weird stuff with their item numbers for their games and what was it for a new Luigi U?

894
01:14:21,911 --> 01:14:24,333
[SPEAKER_10]: It was PPRs is their item number.

895
01:14:24,353 --> 01:14:25,253
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the best.

896
01:14:28,856 --> 01:14:31,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Akuma is asking for a link so I just gave it to him.

897
01:14:32,279 --> 01:14:33,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me quickly do the other countries.

898
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:37,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry Jamie, I know you were ready to go there but I don't want to neglect the Wii U.

899
01:14:37,557 --> 01:14:38,778
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to comment on that game.

900
01:14:39,078 --> 01:14:39,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

901
01:14:39,859 --> 01:14:40,960
[SPEAKER_02]: That you asked IkumaJP.

902
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:42,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

903
01:14:43,001 --> 01:14:45,123
[SPEAKER_06]: So, on the Wii U this week, nothing.

904
01:14:45,183 --> 01:14:48,525
[SPEAKER_06]: But you do have F1 Race Stars Powered Up Edition to look forward to next week.

905
01:14:48,625 --> 01:14:49,185
[SPEAKER_06]: So, there you go.

906
01:14:49,786 --> 01:15:00,974
[SPEAKER_06]: And lastly, on the 3DS this week, Kumatomo and Ninja Jajamaru-kun Sakura-hime to Karyu no Himitsu comes out from Hamster this week on the Nintendo 3DS.

907
01:15:02,395 --> 01:15:09,564
[SPEAKER_10]: So I remember I asked you about the lack of F-Zero at E3 this year.

908
01:15:09,964 --> 01:15:13,869
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you at least excited that Mario Kart 8 is sort of F-Zero now?

909
01:15:14,050 --> 01:15:14,250
[SPEAKER_10]: Mm-hmm.

910
01:15:18,054 --> 01:15:18,755
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

911
01:15:44,597 --> 01:16:09,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Neverwinter on PC and New Super Luigi Brothers U when you first said Neverwinter I thought about Neverwinter Nights so did I and then I look at it and it's like no oh wait no there's that free to play Neverwinter that actually I get emails on that all the time that's it it looks exciting that is truly it no it's a slow week sorry sorry UK friends alright just a couple more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week Loki

912
01:16:10,936 --> 01:16:11,417
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

913
01:16:13,299 --> 01:16:13,979
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's see.

914
01:16:17,143 --> 01:16:25,792
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess with the Xbox 360, a lot of people weren't really happy about the fact that they kind of put their video services behind a paywall.

915
01:16:26,332 --> 01:16:30,033
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, with the PlayStation 4, that's not going to be the case.

916
01:16:31,154 --> 01:16:36,756
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to watch Netflix or something like that, you don't have to have PlayStation Plus to do that.

917
01:16:36,816 --> 01:16:42,378
[SPEAKER_10]: You can actually just view all of their video services, Netflix, Hulu, etc.

918
01:16:42,978 --> 01:16:44,939
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's kind of nice that they're doing that.

919
01:16:45,479 --> 01:16:52,790
[SPEAKER_10]: And free-to-play games, I guess, aren't going to require PlayStation Plus, but that's up to the publisher whether they do that or not.

920
01:16:54,152 --> 01:16:56,296
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's still a chance that they might.

921
01:16:56,576 --> 01:16:59,721
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think it's kind of cool that they're doing that.

922
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:02,761
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's another selling point over Xbox One.

923
01:17:02,801 --> 01:17:07,084
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate to be one of those people dogpiling on Microsoft, but it is what it is, guys.

924
01:17:07,824 --> 01:17:15,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony offering that for free does make that PlayStation 4 a slightly more attractive living room box for some people.

925
01:17:17,129 --> 01:17:20,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, the Xbox One integrated Skype thing is neat.

926
01:17:20,871 --> 01:17:23,152
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not $500 neat for me, but it's neat.

927
01:17:23,772 --> 01:17:25,293
[SPEAKER_06]: That's something PS4 doesn't have, I guess.

928
01:17:27,654 --> 01:17:27,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

929
01:17:30,538 --> 01:17:34,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Jack Trenton talking to GameTrailers saying the last Guardian is quote on hiatus.

930
01:17:53,944 --> 01:18:17,884
[SPEAKER_06]: further quote we got so many projects out there from so many great teams projects never ultimately go away so The Last Guardian is certainly not going away but it's on hiatus right now a lot of back and forth with this game you know Lita a while ago said that the game was still in development but you know now it's not I heard that it was still in development too it was kind of confusing

931
01:18:18,044 --> 01:18:20,826
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, this is just the new Final Fantasy Versus XIII.

932
01:18:20,867 --> 01:18:22,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Or better yet, it's the new Duke Nukem Forever.

933
01:18:23,549 --> 01:18:24,850
[SPEAKER_10]: They're putting it out for PlayStation 4.

934
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:30,215
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's exactly what's happening is it's going to be a PlayStation 4 title and it's just taking its little time.

935
01:18:31,776 --> 01:18:32,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe next year.

936
01:18:33,658 --> 01:18:34,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe next year.

937
01:18:34,278 --> 01:18:44,347
[SPEAKER_06]: But in the meantime, instead of looking forward, let's look back to a more classic time in video games history with a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week.

938
01:18:45,444 --> 01:18:51,687
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura is going to reach into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you ungrateful children should be playing this game immediately.

939
01:18:52,127 --> 01:18:54,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, break out your Neo Geo.

940
01:18:54,769 --> 01:18:56,069
[SPEAKER_06]: You got a good one this week, DarkSakura.

941
01:18:56,329 --> 01:18:56,910
[SPEAKER_06]: What is the classic?

942
01:18:57,010 --> 01:19:01,592
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to do my quote from the anime of this because the dub was so awful.

943
01:19:02,252 --> 01:19:03,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Feel the storm, it's coming.

944
01:19:04,814 --> 01:19:07,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Dan actually quotes that all the time because my husband is a dork.

945
01:19:08,535 --> 01:19:09,256
[SPEAKER_02]: It's from Fatal Fury.

946
01:19:11,197 --> 01:19:15,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Fatal Fury was the series that pretty much led into King of Fighters.

947
01:19:15,481 --> 01:19:21,787
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, the first Fatal Fury was called Garou Densetsu, the King of Fighters.

948
01:19:22,587 --> 01:19:27,652
[SPEAKER_02]: So the very first game, well, as it came out over here actually, was Fatal Fury, King of Fighters.

949
01:19:28,753 --> 01:19:34,197
[SPEAKER_02]: It came out for the arcade, of course, for Neo Geo CD, Mega Drive.

950
01:19:34,217 --> 01:19:37,860
[SPEAKER_02]: It came out on the Sharp computer, the SNES, PS2, Virtual Console.

951
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:38,761
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been on everything.

952
01:19:39,201 --> 01:19:44,585
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course it spawned its better known sequels, Fatal Fury 2 and Fatal Fury Special.

953
01:19:45,486 --> 01:19:53,473
[SPEAKER_02]: There was also Fatal Fury 3, Road to the Final Victory, Real Bout Fatal Fury, Real Bout Fatal Fury Special, Real Bout Fatal Fury 2, The Newcomers.

954
01:19:54,773 --> 01:20:04,476
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a real bout, Gairo Densetsu Special, Dominated Mind, Fatal Fury Wild Ambition, Fatal Fury First Contact, and Gairo Mark of the Wolves, which is probably my favorite in the series.

955
01:20:05,196 --> 01:20:07,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it was pretty badass.

956
01:20:07,656 --> 01:20:15,658
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, with these games, the big mechanic that these fighting games brought in is that, well, for the first one you could only play three characters.

957
01:20:15,678 --> 01:20:18,359
[SPEAKER_02]: You had Terry Bogard, you had Andy Bogard, and Joe Higashi.

958
01:20:19,099 --> 01:20:24,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Who had to fight against some of the bad guys coming up in their way.

959
01:20:25,723 --> 01:20:31,687
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing about this one is that it had sort of this multi-plane type of setting.

960
01:20:32,007 --> 01:20:37,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Where you could dodge moves by jumping from the foreground to the background and vice versa.

961
01:20:38,131 --> 01:20:45,656
[SPEAKER_02]: And as these evolved in later versions, it even had... I think it was on Fatal Fury 3...

962
01:20:47,037 --> 01:20:47,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Fatal Fury 3

963
01:21:05,337 --> 01:21:08,238
[SPEAKER_02]: and they just crack the glass and slump to the floor.

964
01:21:09,378 --> 01:21:20,540
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it is a really neat series and like I said, it gave us the King of Fighters series, which is, I'm sure as a lot of people know, is probably one of my favorite fighting game series altogether.

965
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:31,822
[SPEAKER_02]: I myself have two of them on Neo Geo, which if you can play them on the Neo Geo, just do that because that is the way to play any type of SNK game.

966
01:21:33,542 --> 01:21:44,306
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as the series goes, it actually had a sister series that was called Art of Fighting that was set in exactly the same universe so it was why a lot of the characters crossed over.

967
01:21:46,286 --> 01:21:48,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Quick question, was World Heroes in that same universe?

968
01:21:49,033 --> 01:21:53,220
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not think World of Heroes was because none of the characters in World of Heroes showed up in King of Fighters.

969
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:57,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I thought there was another series where they started showing up in King of Fighters, but I guess that wasn't World of Heroes.

970
01:21:57,226 --> 01:22:01,813
[SPEAKER_02]: As they started combining those universes, keep in mind that they threw in the Ikari Warriors universe.

971
01:22:02,234 --> 01:22:02,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

972
01:22:02,514 --> 01:22:03,876
[SPEAKER_02]: They threw in Psycho Soldier.

973
01:22:04,673 --> 01:22:05,794
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of lost track of this.

974
01:22:05,895 --> 01:22:08,458
[SPEAKER_06]: I like Fatal Fury a lot, actually, at the time.

975
01:22:09,179 --> 01:22:14,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Not so much the original, although I understand why it's worthy of a Classic Game of the Week, but more like Special probably was my big one.

976
01:22:15,106 --> 01:22:18,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Fatal Fury Special was, I think, the one that I saw in the arcades most.

977
01:22:19,551 --> 01:22:23,977
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, it gave us Mai Shiranui and her boobs.

978
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:28,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, such a big outcry about the character.

979
01:22:28,583 --> 01:22:29,764
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought she was hilarious.

980
01:22:30,685 --> 01:22:38,051
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, she also was probably my favorite to play in that game next to Kim Capone later on.

981
01:22:38,888 --> 01:22:40,649
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

982
01:23:07,276 --> 01:23:10,138
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, you had your good masher characters.

983
01:23:10,178 --> 01:23:12,419
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, I think that Mai was a masher character.

984
01:23:12,759 --> 01:23:14,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Yuri was a masher character.

985
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:18,583
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, she was a lot of charge moves, but Yuri was a major masher character.

986
01:23:19,323 --> 01:23:20,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially with her flying butt powers.

987
01:23:23,303 --> 01:23:34,928
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the most part, it gave us such a huge list of characters, too, that, like I said, carried over into King of Fighters.

988
01:23:35,348 --> 01:23:42,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Even Ryo Sakazaki was in two of the Fatal Fury games, who was an Art of Fighting character.

989
01:23:43,331 --> 01:23:45,292
[SPEAKER_02]: On top of that, this is the game that also...

990
01:23:48,399 --> 01:23:54,905
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, basically, leading into Art of Fighting gave us one of our first big multi-game crossovers.

991
01:23:55,085 --> 01:23:58,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, I mean, now we have a Versus series now.

992
01:23:58,488 --> 01:24:02,191
[SPEAKER_02]: I think pretty much because of Fatal Fury and it leading into the King of Fighters series.

993
01:24:02,971 --> 01:24:05,233
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, King of Fury... King of Fury.

994
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:09,217
[SPEAKER_02]: King of Fighters was pretty much Art of Fighting and...

995
01:24:11,118 --> 01:24:14,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Fatal Fury, mixed with a few other SNK games.

996
01:24:15,439 --> 01:24:22,601
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was our first big versus thing and led us into... Yeah, Capcom versus SNK 2, which wouldn't have been possible without these games.

997
01:24:22,941 --> 01:24:26,402
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably like my favorite 2D fighter ever, which I'm sure a lot of people feel that way.

998
01:24:26,482 --> 01:24:30,363
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people want to say that it's, you know, the X-Men versus Street Fighter and all that.

999
01:24:30,503 --> 01:24:31,103
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no.

1000
01:24:31,543 --> 01:24:32,363
[SPEAKER_02]: It started with KLF.

1001
01:24:32,923 --> 01:24:35,884
[SPEAKER_02]: I really think it started with KLF, which, like I said...

1002
01:24:36,704 --> 01:24:45,707
[SPEAKER_02]: came from Fatal Fury, and even in the Fatal Fury universe with Art of Fighting, Art of Fighting led to everybody's favorite joke character, Dan Hibiki.

1003
01:24:46,507 --> 01:24:57,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it was a combination, his dad was supposed to be like a parody of Mr. Karate, and then he was, what was it, Robert Garcia and Ryo combined.

1004
01:24:58,294 --> 01:24:59,835
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1005
01:25:15,123 --> 01:25:17,224
[SPEAKER_02]: King of... Not going back to King of Fighters.

1006
01:25:17,484 --> 01:25:23,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Fatal Fury was pretty generic as far as you have punches, you have special moves, you have super moves.

1007
01:25:24,527 --> 01:25:28,149
[SPEAKER_02]: The later games you built up meters, you had combos, you had all of the same stuff.

1008
01:25:28,990 --> 01:25:36,834
[SPEAKER_02]: But this one, the thing that really set it apart was that multi-plane fighting and the fact that it gave birth to an entire...

1009
01:25:37,754 --> 01:25:41,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Lineage of fighting games right after that.

1010
01:25:41,596 --> 01:25:48,319
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to go for the whole Fatal Fury series just because of what came from it.

1011
01:25:48,619 --> 01:25:51,140
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, my favorite in the series is Garou Densetsu.

1012
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:54,581
[SPEAKER_02]: because I like playing as Rock Howard.

1013
01:25:55,481 --> 01:25:56,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Classic Game of the Week.

1014
01:25:56,461 --> 01:25:56,981
[SPEAKER_02]: And Blue Mary.

1015
01:25:57,321 --> 01:26:00,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Classic Game of the Week, Fatal Fury for the Neo Geo.

1016
01:26:01,142 --> 01:26:01,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Great pick.

1017
01:26:01,602 --> 01:26:05,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, another one of those picks you go, like how many weeks have you done a Classic Game of the Week?

1018
01:26:05,443 --> 01:26:08,244
[SPEAKER_06]: About 300 weeks now and somehow this never came up before?

1019
01:26:08,424 --> 01:26:10,444
[SPEAKER_02]: How many different games have we had that happen with?

1020
01:26:12,205 --> 01:26:13,005
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always funny.

1021
01:26:13,545 --> 01:26:14,165
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always funny.

1022
01:26:14,565 --> 01:26:19,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, you may have done you didn't do like Fatal Fury Special or Fatal Fury 2 one week?

1023
01:26:19,107 --> 01:26:19,628
[SPEAKER_06]: I looked.

1024
01:26:19,828 --> 01:26:20,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

1025
01:26:20,468 --> 01:26:20,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1026
01:26:21,349 --> 01:26:26,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Then again, I didn't look under Garou Densetsu, but I figured that if anyone was putting it down there, they would have done either.

1027
01:26:26,911 --> 01:26:28,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the wiki people are pretty good about that.

1028
01:26:29,273 --> 01:26:31,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we got plenty more to come in Part B tonight.

1029
01:26:31,714 --> 01:26:33,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Fugle Question of the Week and more news.

1030
01:26:34,415 --> 01:26:35,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Even stuff that's not just E3.

1031
01:26:35,896 --> 01:26:41,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Your emails and yes, your phone calls when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1032
01:26:50,455 --> 01:26:56,522
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi there, this is Elliot B, and you're participating with Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.

1033
01:26:57,163 --> 01:27:03,591
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to use my voice to tell you that Donkey Kong Country 2 is the best game ever released on the Super Nintendo.

1034
01:27:03,931 --> 01:27:07,015
[SPEAKER_01]: It has musical apes fighting reptilian pirates.

1035
01:27:07,475 --> 01:27:08,637
[SPEAKER_01]: What more could you ask for?

1036
01:27:10,071 --> 01:27:10,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I don't know.

1037
01:27:10,531 --> 01:27:11,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe a new Metroid instead.

1038
01:27:11,892 --> 01:27:12,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Just saying.

1039
01:27:13,133 --> 01:27:13,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Just saying.

1040
01:27:13,673 --> 01:27:14,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Throwing it out there.

1041
01:27:14,373 --> 01:27:14,513
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1042
01:27:14,994 --> 01:27:16,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much to Elliot for leaving that bumper.

1043
01:27:17,515 --> 01:27:18,676
[SPEAKER_06]: I really appreciate it there.

1044
01:27:18,716 --> 01:27:28,180
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to leave a bumper for us, more information available on our forum, the VOG Network forums, vognetwork.com and just look for the word forums at the top of the screen.

1045
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:29,001
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not that hard to find.

1046
01:27:29,541 --> 01:27:33,423
[SPEAKER_06]: I just bought a Donkey Kong game on 3DS literally weeks ago, and now they're announcing another...

1047
01:27:51,189 --> 01:27:56,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I realize the one on 3DS is a little different, but I feel like Donkey Kong Overload.

1048
01:27:57,014 --> 01:27:58,115
[SPEAKER_06]: I could have gone for a new Metroid.

1049
01:27:58,155 --> 01:28:04,041
[SPEAKER_10]: It just doesn't look that different, aside from, oh, now the barrels will shoot you into the background.

1050
01:28:04,401 --> 01:28:07,004
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not exactly just 2D.

1051
01:28:07,164 --> 01:28:10,447
[SPEAKER_06]: To be fair, though, those games are rock-solid platformers.

1052
01:28:10,867 --> 01:28:14,971
[SPEAKER_02]: They're super fun, and that's just where I think that success is going to be in.

1053
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:21,093
[SPEAKER_06]: TigerClaw on chat says, Rob, actually I want a new Star Fox.

1054
01:28:21,413 --> 01:28:22,013
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be good.

1055
01:28:22,033 --> 01:28:24,616
[SPEAKER_06]: And not that adventures bullshit either, but that would be good.

1056
01:28:25,056 --> 01:28:26,117
[SPEAKER_06]: A new Star Fox would be good.

1057
01:28:26,157 --> 01:28:28,380
[SPEAKER_06]: But nothing would top a new F-Zero.

1058
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:34,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe after this Mario Kart 8 thing, which does look good, maybe we can get that as our racing game for 2014.

1059
01:28:34,546 --> 01:28:34,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1060
01:28:36,247 --> 01:28:37,228
[SPEAKER_06]: A man can dream.

1061
01:28:38,028 --> 01:28:38,668
[SPEAKER_06]: A man can dream.

1062
01:28:39,048 --> 01:28:41,789
[SPEAKER_06]: I also want to make sure we say at some point tonight a happy Father's Day.

1063
01:28:42,390 --> 01:28:46,251
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we were busy talking about E3 in the beginning there, but let us not forget it is Father's Day.

1064
01:28:46,552 --> 01:28:51,754
[SPEAKER_06]: So happy Father's Day to all the father or fatherly figures out there, especially our own Loki.

1065
01:28:52,574 --> 01:28:52,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1066
01:28:52,834 --> 01:28:53,695
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1067
01:28:54,035 --> 01:28:58,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Is Josh at the age where he can kind of recognize Father's Day yet and wish you a happy one?

1068
01:28:59,117 --> 01:28:59,257
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1069
01:28:59,297 --> 01:28:59,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Not quite?

1070
01:29:00,257 --> 01:29:00,438
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1071
01:29:00,618 --> 01:29:00,918
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1072
01:29:01,338 --> 01:29:02,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe next time.

1073
01:29:02,658 --> 01:29:02,738
[SPEAKER_13]: Eh.

1074
01:29:04,079 --> 01:29:08,961
[SPEAKER_02]: If my BFF is listening, then tell Chris I said Happy Father's Day.

1075
01:29:08,981 --> 01:29:09,661
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

1076
01:29:10,562 --> 01:29:12,623
[SPEAKER_02]: And tell Julian to clean his room to be nice.

1077
01:29:13,723 --> 01:29:18,505
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll wish Alan a Happy Father's Day because Sanrio the kitty is very well taken care of.

1078
01:29:18,845 --> 01:29:21,046
[SPEAKER_06]: And he sends me videos when I'm out of town and everything.

1079
01:29:21,727 --> 01:29:23,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though she was very antisocial.

1080
01:29:24,068 --> 01:29:26,669
[SPEAKER_02]: I still need to get a good picture of her to put on the interwebs.

1081
01:29:27,749 --> 01:29:31,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Is Alan ever going to come over here and talk to me about what he thought about E3 and all this stuff?

1082
01:29:32,211 --> 01:29:34,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we finally had the comment in chat, by the way.

1083
01:29:34,812 --> 01:29:35,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Who dat is?

1084
01:29:35,393 --> 01:29:36,033
[SPEAKER_02]: My baby daddy.

1085
01:29:36,593 --> 01:29:37,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay, putting him on the spot.

1086
01:29:37,513 --> 01:29:37,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Alan.

1087
01:29:37,994 --> 01:29:38,614
[SPEAKER_06]: Long time no talk.

1088
01:29:39,074 --> 01:29:39,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

1089
01:29:39,754 --> 01:29:40,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to the show.

1090
01:29:40,595 --> 01:29:40,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1091
01:29:40,915 --> 01:29:42,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have anything you want to plug while you're here?

1092
01:29:43,316 --> 01:29:45,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone's saying that Microsoft killed Sony.

1093
01:29:46,397 --> 01:29:52,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Or, sorry, Sony killed Microsoft at E3, but more like Microsoft killed themselves and then Sony just showed up with pizza and a bag of weed.

1094
01:29:55,522 --> 01:29:57,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Why y'all mad and sad?

1095
01:29:57,162 --> 01:29:58,163
[SPEAKER_05]: We got good shit here.

1096
01:30:00,515 --> 01:30:03,700
[SPEAKER_06]: I asked you if you had anything you wanted to plug and that was your answer.

1097
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:07,304
[SPEAKER_06]: It was essentially pizza and weed, but that's alright.

1098
01:30:07,665 --> 01:30:08,887
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't run any shows.

1099
01:30:09,327 --> 01:30:10,028
[SPEAKER_05]: What would I plug?

1100
01:30:12,799 --> 01:30:15,321
[SPEAKER_06]: You listen to other people's shows more than you listen to mine.

1101
01:30:15,341 --> 01:30:16,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to plug the Nerdist?

1102
01:30:16,502 --> 01:30:16,842
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

1103
01:30:16,902 --> 01:30:18,023
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all for the Alan show.

1104
01:30:18,263 --> 01:30:19,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Alan needs his own show.

1105
01:30:19,344 --> 01:30:21,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Alan does need his own show, but he's a little shy.

1106
01:30:21,806 --> 01:30:22,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you do your own show, Alan?

1107
01:30:23,207 --> 01:30:23,407
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1108
01:30:23,727 --> 01:30:23,968
[SPEAKER_06]: See?

1109
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:25,048
[SPEAKER_06]: He wouldn't do it.

1110
01:30:25,689 --> 01:30:28,171
[SPEAKER_06]: He walks on here, gives his witty commentary, and then leaves.

1111
01:30:29,032 --> 01:30:30,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other observations about this year's E3?

1112
01:30:32,586 --> 01:30:43,134
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of really bad misinformation about the Xbox One, and I kind of feel bad for Microsoft even though they've brought it on themselves because all the made-up shit about their console is completely believable, even if it's not true.

1113
01:30:43,695 --> 01:30:46,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, like the whole it's only launching in 21 states thing?

1114
01:30:47,535 --> 01:31:06,794
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the 21 country IP address thing, but no, there was that post about if your account is banned, all of your licenses, even if it's attached to a physical disk, are deactivated, which is not true, but that super fits into what they're legitimately doing, that it's super easy to believe something like that.

1115
01:31:07,294 --> 01:31:09,055
[SPEAKER_06]: It's everybody dogpiling on Microsoft.

1116
01:31:09,075 --> 01:31:10,896
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's kick them while they're down.

1117
01:31:11,176 --> 01:31:12,696
[SPEAKER_06]: How dare they implement these DRMs?

1118
01:31:12,756 --> 01:31:13,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Kick, kick, punch, punch.

1119
01:31:13,757 --> 01:31:17,738
[SPEAKER_10]: They also said at the end of the console cycle that they're not going to shut off the servers.

1120
01:31:19,939 --> 01:31:21,159
[SPEAKER_10]: That's years away.

1121
01:31:22,751 --> 01:31:22,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1122
01:31:23,612 --> 01:31:24,533
[SPEAKER_05]: And I didn't know either.

1123
01:31:24,593 --> 01:31:26,256
[SPEAKER_05]: I just found this out yesterday.

1124
01:31:26,896 --> 01:31:37,730
[SPEAKER_05]: The 24-hour ping to make sure that your shit works, the internet connectivity, if you're playing your game at a friend's house under your account, it pings once an hour because it's not your console.

1125
01:31:39,012 --> 01:31:39,372
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a mess.

1126
01:31:40,994 --> 01:31:47,415
[SPEAKER_06]: and just so you know, Alan at live.vognetwork.com Let's see, RawSteelUT agrees with you in part.

1127
01:31:47,455 --> 01:31:49,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony really only needed to show up.

1128
01:31:49,656 --> 01:31:51,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Misty says, I approve of an Alan show.

1129
01:31:51,896 --> 01:31:54,737
[SPEAKER_06]: SSU100Matt says, Alan has plenty of drop the mic moments.

1130
01:31:56,897 --> 01:31:57,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'm the best.

1131
01:31:59,438 --> 01:31:59,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Drop.

1132
01:32:00,138 --> 01:32:03,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anything else quickly before we say bye and get into rapid fire news?

1133
01:32:04,379 --> 01:32:05,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Stanley, I was shy.

1134
01:32:05,996 --> 01:32:06,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, she is.

1135
01:32:07,417 --> 01:32:08,238
[SPEAKER_06]: She's a good kitty, though.

1136
01:32:08,558 --> 01:32:10,740
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's get into rapid-fire news.

1137
01:32:11,141 --> 01:32:11,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

1138
01:32:12,262 --> 01:32:12,602
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1139
01:32:14,384 --> 01:32:21,270
[SPEAKER_10]: So, one of the things that they talked about during the Microsoft press conference is that they're going to be getting rid of the Microsoft points.

1140
01:32:21,830 --> 01:32:22,111
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

1141
01:32:22,631 --> 01:32:25,113
[SPEAKER_10]: How's that going to work now that I have Microsoft Points?

1142
01:32:25,173 --> 01:32:26,094
[SPEAKER_10]: How's that going to convert?

1143
01:32:26,534 --> 01:32:27,955
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they're just going to convert it over.

1144
01:32:27,975 --> 01:32:30,877
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to take your space bucks and make them into actual bucks.

1145
01:32:30,937 --> 01:32:37,082
[SPEAKER_10]: So in North America, 80 points or less to the dollar will exchange to that dollar.

1146
01:32:37,982 --> 01:32:49,551
[SPEAKER_10]: However, there is one little bullet point on there, or asterisk, I guess, that when they do convert those into actual dollars, they must be spent within a year.

1147
01:32:49,751 --> 01:32:51,733
[SPEAKER_10]: Otherwise, you lose them.

1148
01:32:53,877 --> 01:33:19,711
[SPEAKER_10]: which is bullshit if you ask me but them be the you know terms I guess that's kind of bullshit I agree but hopefully I didn't have enough left in my account where you know I'll buy one Xbox Live Arcade game and that's it I still got 20 bucks because I tried buying a game for 20 bucks and it took money off my credit card instead of using the points that I already had thank you

1149
01:33:20,259 --> 01:33:27,244
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny, I got two points cards for my birthday and I've only used one of them so that I could play stuff on Rock Band.

1150
01:33:27,785 --> 01:33:31,427
[SPEAKER_02]: So that I could sing Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots, thank you.

1151
01:33:32,688 --> 01:33:37,252
[SPEAKER_02]: So now I think I'm just going to buy all the Mass Effect gear for my character even though I don't touch it on the Xbox.

1152
01:33:39,747 --> 01:33:50,455
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, another cool announcement is Twitch was saying that, you know, because they have a partnership with the Xbox One where it's going to be integrated in there so you can stream to Twitch.

1153
01:33:51,396 --> 01:34:03,385
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's also got this software development kit that actually will allow anybody to integrate it into their consoles to broadcast from any platform, including the PlayStation 4 if they really wanted to.

1154
01:34:04,006 --> 01:34:05,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Wasn't the OUYA supposed to be getting a Twitch thing too?

1155
01:34:06,035 --> 01:34:06,495
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

1156
01:34:25,470 --> 01:34:28,633
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I don't think, yeah, I don't think it has enough power to do that.

1157
01:34:29,174 --> 01:34:31,016
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so, whatever.

1158
01:34:32,058 --> 01:34:36,723
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, but yeah, it's gonna be cool that they can integrate this into a bunch of stuff.

1159
01:34:36,783 --> 01:34:39,867
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I think it's very possible that we'll see that coming to, um...

1160
01:34:42,270 --> 01:34:44,932
[SPEAKER_10]: I think a little competition is healthy I'd like to see more options than just Twitch out there

1161
01:35:01,025 --> 01:35:28,321
[SPEAKER_10]: and last but not least of course they were talking about Summer of Arcade it's coming August 7th and will include such titles as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows also a remake or reboot if you will of Flashback the old 1992 classic Brothers A Tale of Two Sons and Charlie Murder which is being done by the guys that did the Dishwasher game so that should be good

1162
01:35:31,235 --> 01:36:00,067
[SPEAKER_06]: and of course no word if they're still doing that deal where you buy all the games you get money back type thing any pricing or free games or free games all the way alright I got some news real quick one of them about the game Ultima Forever don't get too excited it's not really a PC game it's that iOS game the Ultima iOS game that's being made some of the currency was really balanced this week it's out in Canada because EA tends to beta a lot of this type of stuff in Canada and then they release it in the US

1163
01:36:01,488 --> 01:36:04,992
[SPEAKER_06]: How does that make our Canadian listeners feel that they're beta testers for this?

1164
01:36:20,929 --> 01:36:24,834
[SPEAKER_06]: and increasing storage space and your stash was lowered and so on and so on.

1165
01:36:25,335 --> 01:36:30,321
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're trying to not make it so crazy, I guess, where you're going to feel like you're forced to buy things.

1166
01:36:30,781 --> 01:36:35,367
[SPEAKER_06]: However, the highest quality chests, they went up in price as part of this balancing.

1167
01:36:35,427 --> 01:36:36,849
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess not everything was a win.

1168
01:36:38,671 --> 01:36:39,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting...

1169
01:36:40,373 --> 01:36:42,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Talk out there about the new Zelda game.

1170
01:36:42,374 --> 01:36:44,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, we all know there's going to be a new Zelda game.

1171
01:36:44,956 --> 01:36:47,977
[SPEAKER_06]: It will probably be the big thing that Nintendo shows in 2014.

1172
01:36:49,158 --> 01:36:51,739
[SPEAKER_06]: But the producer of the series said something interesting this week.

1173
01:36:52,399 --> 01:36:52,760
[SPEAKER_06]: E.G.

1174
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:56,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Anuma said this week that he's a big fan of Skyrim.

1175
01:36:57,683 --> 01:37:19,484
[SPEAKER_06]: and uh this is very interesting uh so he was asked if he was looking at any other titles for inspiration for the new Zelda game he said Skyrim obviously I play other games and I'm curious what Zelda fans like about the Skyrim experience maybe there are some Zelda fans who are looking for something similar out of a Zelda game but I don't look at the technology that made these games possible I don't look at what's happening in the game but how it made me feel

1176
01:37:20,024 --> 01:37:47,846
[SPEAKER_06]: what in the game moved me and how I can bring out those same emotions to players who play my games my intent isn't to copy them but those are the things that stay with you as a player it's not what you see about the game that makes you feel excuse me it's not what you see but how the game makes you feel that makes you feel closer to the experience it's more about the feeling and expression of emotions in the game and I do take that into consideration when working on my own projects so could Link be taking the arrow to the knee in the next installment?

1177
01:37:48,166 --> 01:37:50,067
[SPEAKER_06]: I think open world is what they're talking about.

1178
01:37:50,267 --> 01:37:52,688
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, actually, most of the games are open world.

1179
01:37:53,028 --> 01:38:00,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm thinking, too, like, you know, maybe a lot of the... In Skyrim, you tend to really be able to interact with everything.

1180
01:38:00,751 --> 01:38:01,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe that's part of it, too.

1181
01:38:02,372 --> 01:38:03,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe building more side quests.

1182
01:38:03,852 --> 01:38:04,273
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1183
01:38:04,293 --> 01:38:04,933
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be interesting.

1184
01:38:05,493 --> 01:38:16,199
[SPEAKER_10]: I always thought, you know how in Wind Waker, well, spoiler, there's a portion of it where you go under the sea and you see the 3D world that's down there.

1185
01:38:16,659 --> 01:38:18,921
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm like, why wasn't this Wind Waker?

1186
01:38:19,181 --> 01:38:20,662
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that would have been amazing.

1187
01:38:20,982 --> 01:38:24,584
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm hoping that it's something like that, but, you know, better graphics.

1188
01:38:27,595 --> 01:38:32,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Did they maybe include that in the remake of Wind Waker HD?

1189
01:38:46,727 --> 01:38:48,730
[SPEAKER_08]: to seaweed is always greener.

1190
01:38:49,090 --> 01:38:50,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything looks better in HD.

1191
01:38:51,393 --> 01:38:52,575
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, forget it.

1192
01:38:53,756 --> 01:38:55,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, something else about Nintendo.

1193
01:38:55,538 --> 01:38:56,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Retro is actually coming out.

1194
01:38:57,201 --> 01:38:59,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Funny we had that discussion earlier in the show.

1195
01:38:59,984 --> 01:39:03,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Retro saying that it was hard to decide between Metroid and Donkey Kong.

1196
01:39:04,758 --> 01:39:06,940
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure the Metroid game will happen sometime this generation.

1197
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:07,601
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just not right now.

1198
01:39:28,493 --> 01:39:39,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, what I found interesting about the new Super Mario 3D World, I think what a lot of people are very excited about is that the Mario and Luigi and characters that are in the game play like they do in Super Mario 2 on the NES.

1199
01:39:40,205 --> 01:39:48,033
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you think about it, we haven't really seen a game implement the characterization of those characters since that game, you know, with Peach floating and all that.

1200
01:39:48,073 --> 01:39:49,635
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was really cool that they brought that back.

1201
01:39:50,035 --> 01:39:53,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Peach wasn't originally planned as a playable character in Mario 3D World.

1202
01:39:53,777 --> 01:39:57,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you know, in the last few games, it's been Mario, Luigi, and the Two Toes.

1203
01:39:57,039 --> 01:39:59,641
[SPEAKER_10]: Because female protagonists do not sell games.

1204
01:40:01,102 --> 01:40:01,502
[SPEAKER_14]: Really?

1205
01:40:02,803 --> 01:40:05,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, he said that with his tongue firmly planted in cheek.

1206
01:40:05,685 --> 01:40:07,066
[SPEAKER_06]: But, well, you know...

1207
01:40:08,223 --> 01:40:12,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo got a lot of kudos this week for announcing some really awesome female characters.

1208
01:40:12,946 --> 01:40:17,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Not just Peach, but the Wii Fit Trainer as a character in Super Smash Bros.

1209
01:40:17,689 --> 01:40:23,032
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I thought that was cool, and I'm glad that there were no rape jokes during their presentation of Smash Bros.

1210
01:40:23,212 --> 01:40:25,234
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a whole nother Oprah.

1211
01:40:25,334 --> 01:40:25,694
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1212
01:40:26,214 --> 01:40:30,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, and he's referring to what happened at the Microsoft thing, if you didn't know.

1213
01:40:30,557 --> 01:40:30,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow...

1214
01:40:32,618 --> 01:40:40,641
[SPEAKER_06]: A comment from Yoshiaki Koizumi said, I think she adds a lot of the sense of completion when you get in multiplayer.

1215
01:40:40,961 --> 01:40:44,863
[SPEAKER_06]: You can have different people choosing different characters based on their personality or whoever they like.

1216
01:40:45,223 --> 01:40:47,464
[SPEAKER_06]: And Princess Peach is just really a lot of fun to play.

1217
01:40:48,044 --> 01:40:51,085
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, Peach was not originally the greatest playable character in the game.

1218
01:40:52,306 --> 01:40:56,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Which means the plot isn't that they're rescuing her for a change.

1219
01:40:56,167 --> 01:40:57,548
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's good, I think.

1220
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:01,423
[SPEAKER_06]: And hell, I like playing as Princess Peach.

1221
01:41:01,483 --> 01:41:03,045
[SPEAKER_06]: That float ability is badass.

1222
01:41:03,986 --> 01:41:07,972
[SPEAKER_06]: She's kind of actually way better than the others because of that ability.

1223
01:41:07,992 --> 01:41:10,575
[SPEAKER_06]: But maybe this game will be more balanced than Mario 2 was.

1224
01:41:10,695 --> 01:41:11,076
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

1225
01:41:12,297 --> 01:41:13,118
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.

1226
01:41:13,159 --> 01:41:15,662
[SPEAKER_02]: My iPad just completely crashed on me.

1227
01:41:15,702 --> 01:41:16,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me a second.

1228
01:41:16,543 --> 01:41:16,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, hooray.

1229
01:41:17,304 --> 01:41:18,365
[SPEAKER_02]: PC, 3DS, and the Wii U eShop.

1230
01:41:43,622 --> 01:41:49,083
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is going to be super awesome cool, which is funny because I was playing Super Pac-Man just the other day.

1231
01:41:50,003 --> 01:41:52,064
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also a trademark in the U.S.

1232
01:41:52,124 --> 01:41:53,664
[SPEAKER_02]: is Contra Run and Gun.

1233
01:41:55,545 --> 01:42:03,526
[SPEAKER_02]: They did tease a new Contra at E3 in 2011, but now we actually have a trademark to go with it.

1234
01:42:04,207 --> 01:42:05,787
[SPEAKER_02]: And last but not least...

1235
01:42:06,767 --> 01:42:12,394
[SPEAKER_02]: The inspiration for our kneel before VOG logo that went a while back.

1236
01:42:12,494 --> 01:42:13,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Which not a lot of people got, unfortunately.

1237
01:42:13,936 --> 01:42:14,757
[SPEAKER_02]: It was our teaser.

1238
01:42:14,837 --> 01:42:16,820
[SPEAKER_06]: But maybe now that there's a movie out, which I want to see.

1239
01:42:16,860 --> 01:42:18,181
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to see the new movie, The Man of Steel?

1240
01:42:18,201 --> 01:42:18,802
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see that.

1241
01:42:18,842 --> 01:42:21,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Becky went and saw it today and said it was okay, but the end of it took forever.

1242
01:42:22,386 --> 01:42:22,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

1243
01:42:23,862 --> 01:42:26,104
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, oh thank you GeicoAd for running.

1244
01:42:26,684 --> 01:42:32,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so for Injustice Gods Among Us, a new character is going to be added and it is Zod.

1245
01:42:33,469 --> 01:42:34,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Mew before Zod.

1246
01:42:36,011 --> 01:42:36,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Son of Jor-El.

1247
01:42:36,591 --> 01:42:37,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Which better be said in the movie.

1248
01:42:38,213 --> 01:42:40,894
[SPEAKER_02]: He better freaking, yeah.

1249
01:42:40,934 --> 01:42:42,155
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want spoilers in chat.

1250
01:42:42,696 --> 01:42:44,217
[SPEAKER_06]: I will slap you with a trout if you spoil.

1251
01:42:44,237 --> 01:42:45,778
[SPEAKER_02]: If you spoil, we spank.

1252
01:42:46,318 --> 01:42:52,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's get to the Fugle question of the week.

1253
01:42:52,128 --> 01:42:55,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Every week we ask a question on our Facebook and Google Plus communities.

1254
01:42:56,314 --> 01:42:57,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Slam it together and you get Fugle.

1255
01:43:01,140 --> 01:43:02,081
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was the question.

1256
01:43:22,694 --> 01:43:24,734
[SPEAKER_06]: We'd like to know your thoughts on E3, but with a twist.

1257
01:43:24,774 --> 01:43:27,495
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't talk about the big press conferences or the new consoles.

1258
01:43:27,995 --> 01:43:31,096
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I know, but there will be plenty of other time on tonight's show to talk about all that.

1259
01:43:31,176 --> 01:43:41,178
[SPEAKER_06]: We're looking for what you were excited to hear about that maybe slipped off someone else's radar amongst all the Sony vs. Microsoft press conference with a side of Nintendo Direct chatter.

1260
01:43:41,758 --> 01:43:43,178
[SPEAKER_06]: So, let's get to some of the answers.

1261
01:43:43,218 --> 01:43:47,679
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll start with Google Plus tonight, because I haven't been starting with them a lot lately, so I want to show them some love.

1262
01:43:48,679 --> 01:43:55,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft on Google Plus says, well, this technically counts as one of the big announcements, but I'm hyped to see a new Mirror's Edge in the works.

1263
01:43:55,523 --> 01:43:56,144
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll let it slide.

1264
01:43:56,664 --> 01:44:00,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully the wait won't be as long and the game will be great as the first one, if not more.

1265
01:44:01,327 --> 01:44:02,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Deft, I'm going to say 2014.

1266
01:44:03,268 --> 01:44:05,270
[SPEAKER_06]: It's definitely not, they're not talking like it's a 2013 game.

1267
01:44:05,290 --> 01:44:05,490
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not 2013.

1268
01:44:08,051 --> 01:44:11,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Flaco Jones says, I was excited to see gameplay from the enemy within.

1269
01:44:11,854 --> 01:44:17,637
[SPEAKER_06]: If they keep to their word and go back to the roots of what makes survival horror great, then it should be an awesome experience.

1270
01:44:17,917 --> 01:44:19,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that was a comment from Bethesda coming through.

1271
01:44:19,958 --> 01:44:26,602
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the first things on the E3.blog network experience was that they are going back to survival horror roots with the enemy within.

1272
01:44:26,763 --> 01:44:28,964
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard that it's supposed to be really, really gross.

1273
01:44:30,157 --> 01:44:38,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay, gross games, except not really, I don't like gross games, but I know there are other people that are into the gross games, so enjoy it.

1274
01:44:38,820 --> 01:44:50,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Going to some of the responses on Facebook, James S. says, I feel like the game Killer is Dead might be the one that a lot of people didn't see anything on, but it's definitely a current gen title that people should be checking out.

1275
01:44:50,865 --> 01:44:56,427
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks pretty damn awesome, and it's one of the very few current gen titles that are coming out during the remainder of this year.

1276
01:44:56,907 --> 01:44:59,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, Dark Souls 2, need I say more?

1277
01:44:59,488 --> 01:45:11,693
[SPEAKER_10]: Sadly, I don't think it's going to do very well because it comes out right at the same time as Splinter Cell and Saints Row and Madden and... I think there's an audience for it.

1278
01:45:12,433 --> 01:45:13,013
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, something else.

1279
01:45:13,173 --> 01:45:19,656
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as we can still get that mod on the PC version that instead of whenever you get you died, when you die it goes, thanks Obama.

1280
01:45:20,276 --> 01:45:20,516
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1281
01:45:20,536 --> 01:45:20,737
[SPEAKER_06]: It's funny!

1282
01:45:38,721 --> 01:45:39,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Smash Bros.

1283
01:45:39,341 --> 01:45:43,503
[SPEAKER_06]: for the 3DS version and the additional characters, Kingdom Hearts 3, duh.

1284
01:46:02,490 --> 01:46:10,997
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't happy with the announcement of the direction that Metroid is planning to take, basically expanding on the characters of the universe and making a gallery of other bounty hunters besides Samus.

1285
01:46:11,497 --> 01:46:14,079
[SPEAKER_06]: And why no new 2D cel-shaded Castlevania?

1286
01:46:14,159 --> 01:46:15,420
[SPEAKER_06]: I know a pipe dream, but still.

1287
01:46:18,463 --> 01:46:20,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Haseo Sumiwagawa says, Mirror's Edge 2.

1288
01:46:21,085 --> 01:46:26,109
[SPEAKER_06]: My boyfriend and I are so excited, but I'm also excited for Kingdom Hearts 3 and Final Fantasy XIV and XV.

1289
01:46:29,192 --> 01:46:55,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Burr says I'm a bit excited about what I saw of the new Sonic game Lost World I know I'm probably in for a letdown but Sonic Generations was a bit of a surprise so this could be too Mason D I love this answer this is so win the thing most out of E3 Miyamoto likes In-N-Out Burger confirmed with the picture of Miyamoto at the In-N-Out truck that was in the parking lot I kept seeing that popping up all over Facebook that is hilarious that is great though

1290
01:46:56,398 --> 01:47:13,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Ronnie B says the Mirror's Edge reboot is all I care about I think it's extremely impressive EA of all companies managed to seemingly keep everything in its original format I hope they don't nickel and dime the game to death though otherwise it looks impressive like the first I hope the music is equally respected a lot of love for that new Mirror's Edge game the trailer music was awesome

1291
01:47:14,131 --> 01:47:18,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Clover N says the Metal Gear Solid 5 trailer looks absolutely amazing.

1292
01:47:18,157 --> 01:47:22,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope the controls for the most part don't stray too far from the controls of the past Metal Gear Solid games.

1293
01:47:23,384 --> 01:47:27,049
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a hell of a way to start off the Microsoft conference.

1294
01:47:27,110 --> 01:47:30,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Say what you will about what went down there, but that was a great kickoff.

1295
01:47:32,307 --> 01:47:34,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Ragenator says, Well, I think there were some.

1296
01:47:34,408 --> 01:47:35,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Nuclear subs, anybody?

1297
01:47:35,188 --> 01:47:35,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Matt J says,

1298
01:47:51,414 --> 01:47:52,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I haven't read too much about it.

1299
01:47:52,735 --> 01:47:55,097
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm currently most excited for Deus Ex The Fall.

1300
01:47:55,497 --> 01:47:59,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Haters can say what they want, but I think it's an interesting chapter in the Deus Ex game series.

1301
01:47:59,480 --> 01:48:02,283
[SPEAKER_06]: In case you don't know, Deus Ex The Fall is an iOS Android title.

1302
01:48:02,323 --> 01:48:04,745
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a sequel to the Deus Ex novel, Icarus Effect.

1303
01:48:05,165 --> 01:48:08,407
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of folks are bitching because it's a mobile title, not a console or PC title.

1304
01:48:08,468 --> 01:48:11,350
[SPEAKER_06]: However, I find it looks interesting and potentially a fun game.

1305
01:48:11,610 --> 01:48:17,775
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a diehard Deus Ex fan and excited by the prospect of a mobile, on-the-go game, something not easily done with the other titles.

1306
01:48:18,095 --> 01:48:21,797
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm willing to at least give it a shot, unlike most folks who refuse to even acknowledge it.

1307
01:48:22,657 --> 01:48:28,980
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, a lot of people have a smartphone, and they might say they're not going to play it all they want, but then when it's like 99 cents, they're like, ooh, gimme.

1308
01:48:30,360 --> 01:48:37,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Tigerclaw says, I'm pretty excited about new Super Mario 3D World, Mario in a catsuit, but Princess Peach would look cuter in the catsuit, in my opinion.

1309
01:48:37,904 --> 01:48:44,046
[SPEAKER_06]: She does look cute, but the keyword is cute, and not, like, oversexed, which I think is a good thing.

1310
01:48:44,847 --> 01:48:45,247
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, Jamie?

1311
01:48:45,267 --> 01:48:45,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1312
01:48:45,888 --> 01:48:48,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's actually, it looks like those little pajamas.

1313
01:48:48,450 --> 01:48:49,170
[SPEAKER_06]: It's tasteful.

1314
01:48:49,410 --> 01:48:49,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it is.

1315
01:48:50,031 --> 01:48:50,771
[SPEAKER_02]: It's adorable too.

1316
01:48:50,831 --> 01:48:56,355
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, I saw somebody at E3 in a Pikachu footie pajama thing, head to toe.

1317
01:48:56,595 --> 01:48:56,916
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1318
01:48:57,316 --> 01:49:03,800
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm kind of like, alright dude, you go on with your bad self, but then I'm kind of like, why do people dress up for E3 like that?

1319
01:49:04,121 --> 01:49:05,061
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not the place for that.

1320
01:49:05,081 --> 01:49:05,922
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not the place for that.

1321
01:49:06,442 --> 01:49:07,383
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not Tokyo Game Show.

1322
01:49:08,795 --> 01:49:09,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it would be Comiket.

1323
01:49:09,916 --> 01:49:10,776
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not PAX.

1324
01:49:11,596 --> 01:49:13,277
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, that's a whole other episode.

1325
01:49:13,977 --> 01:49:15,658
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm also looking forward to Mario Kart 8.

1326
01:49:15,718 --> 01:49:17,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Too bad we'll have to wait until 2014 for those two.

1327
01:49:18,219 --> 01:49:23,141
[SPEAKER_06]: The new game on Mad Max would be interesting, even though there has already been a Mad Max game on the NES.

1328
01:49:23,581 --> 01:49:25,702
[SPEAKER_06]: This one being made by the developers of Just Cause.

1329
01:49:25,762 --> 01:49:27,843
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember the Mad Max game on the NES.

1330
01:49:28,383 --> 01:49:30,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Boy, oh boy.

1331
01:49:31,504 --> 01:49:39,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, GamerGirl says, mostly excited for, I know it's not PS4 exclusive, but Final Fantasy Realm Reborn, Lightning Returns, and the new Kingdom Hearts.

1332
01:49:39,990 --> 01:49:41,651
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you're a Square Enix fangirl.

1333
01:49:42,891 --> 01:49:51,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Andy R. says, I listened to last week's OLR after Monday and hearing all the ragging on, well, if Microsoft's doing it, then Sony must be doing it too, was really amusing to me.

1334
01:49:51,477 --> 01:49:54,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Loki, I'll admit I chuckled at your cynicism a few times.

1335
01:49:54,619 --> 01:49:57,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Before the pressers, I was worried too, though, so I can't be too hard on you.

1336
01:49:57,801 --> 01:49:59,962
[SPEAKER_06]: That aside, I was rather impressed with Destiny.

1337
01:50:00,302 --> 01:50:03,847
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care for MMOs or FPSs, but the gameplay shown looked really fun.

1338
01:50:04,307 --> 01:50:07,211
[SPEAKER_06]: And though we all knew a new Smash Bros.

1339
01:50:07,231 --> 01:50:09,654
[SPEAKER_06]: was coming, I was pretty excited to buy the reveal.

1340
01:50:09,774 --> 01:50:17,224
[SPEAKER_06]: That and Bayonetta 2 might convince me to buy a Wii U. Shane replied saying nothing but Final Fantasy XIV about 14 times.

1341
01:50:17,264 --> 01:50:17,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Copy-pasted.

1342
01:50:18,665 --> 01:50:19,486
[SPEAKER_06]: It's beautiful.

1343
01:50:20,666 --> 01:50:21,847
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Let's Have Tea.

1344
01:50:22,588 --> 01:50:23,528
[SPEAKER_06]: I always love that name.

1345
01:50:23,568 --> 01:50:24,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Good to hear from you, Let's Have Tea.

1346
01:50:24,869 --> 01:50:30,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's Have Tea says, your thoughts on the Xbox One family sharing feature and if you guys have even heard of it.

1347
01:50:30,152 --> 01:50:35,035
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably the best feature of the Xbox One and a feature that Microsoft keeps seeming to forget to mention.

1348
01:50:35,395 --> 01:50:39,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, Let's Have Tea, as much as I love your name, I said no talking about the pressers.

1349
01:50:39,798 --> 01:50:42,659
[SPEAKER_06]: But yes, I do believe we did mention that earlier in the show, right, Loki?

1350
01:50:42,759 --> 01:50:42,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1351
01:50:43,019 --> 01:50:44,019
[SPEAKER_06]: So, there you go.

1352
01:50:45,020 --> 01:50:46,440
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, it does sound interesting.

1353
01:50:46,700 --> 01:50:49,261
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just that it's not worth the DRM trade-off.

1354
01:50:49,301 --> 01:50:50,061
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my opinion.

1355
01:50:50,462 --> 01:50:51,182
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sticking to it.

1356
01:50:51,662 --> 01:50:56,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are your answers at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and Google Plus.

1357
01:50:56,904 --> 01:50:58,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Search for Orange Lounge Radio.

1358
01:50:59,285 --> 01:51:00,265
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

1359
01:51:00,925 --> 01:51:02,386
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the Fugle Question of the Week.

1360
01:51:02,826 --> 01:51:04,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Some more news for you guys.

1361
01:51:04,166 --> 01:51:07,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag, FU's of the Week, Twitter, Skype, all coming up in a little bit.

1362
01:51:07,827 --> 01:51:08,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

1363
01:51:08,228 --> 01:51:09,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Who reads the mail anyway?

1364
01:51:09,728 --> 01:51:10,088
[SPEAKER_06]: You do.

1365
01:51:10,509 --> 01:51:11,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Get ready for it.

1366
01:51:11,849 --> 01:51:12,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1367
01:51:12,850 --> 01:51:13,230
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1368
01:51:13,370 --> 01:51:18,032
[SPEAKER_10]: So Gearbox is facing a lawsuit.

1369
01:51:18,653 --> 01:51:23,735
[SPEAKER_10]: And no, it's not over aliens, colonial marines, but it's Duke Nukem Forever.

1370
01:51:24,376 --> 01:51:30,719
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, Gearbox, of course, after they resumed development of Duke Nukem Forever...

1371
01:51:32,125 --> 01:51:39,753
[SPEAKER_10]: I kind of failed to give the payoff of a $2.9 million loan that 3D Realms owed to an unnamed company.

1372
01:51:48,677 --> 01:51:52,340
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently, also, there are some royalties that were due as well.

1373
01:51:54,342 --> 01:51:56,244
[SPEAKER_10]: And they just haven't taken care of that yet.

1374
01:51:56,724 --> 01:52:12,818
[SPEAKER_10]: And apparently, according to the Gearbox VP of Marketing, Steve Gibson, the reality is Apogee and 3D Realms receive the full benefit of its bargain.

1375
01:52:12,858 --> 01:52:16,301
[SPEAKER_10]: Gearbox, in fulfillment of its commitment...

1376
01:52:17,061 --> 01:52:21,364
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you've fulfilled your commitments because the game's kind of crap, but whatever.

1377
01:52:21,544 --> 01:52:22,585
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess, finished game.

1378
01:52:23,565 --> 01:52:29,749
[SPEAKER_10]: Enriched 3DR, saved 3DR from its debts and rescued 3DR from its litigation surrounding failed dozens.

1379
01:52:30,109 --> 01:52:45,138
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess the way it sounds like that they think that because they kind of paid off their debts that they don't get any sort of kickback from Duke Nukem Forever, although I can't imagine it would be that big because I don't think it sold that well.

1380
01:52:45,438 --> 01:52:45,538
So...

1381
01:52:47,519 --> 01:52:48,980
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, court case.

1382
01:52:51,241 --> 01:52:55,643
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always sad when they're fighting over a game that really wasn't worth fighting over in the end.

1383
01:52:56,623 --> 01:52:57,724
[SPEAKER_06]: But money's money, right?

1384
01:52:58,244 --> 01:53:00,685
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I mean, it was really weird with...

1385
01:53:04,963 --> 01:53:12,508
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember they were talking about misappropriation of money with Aliens Colonial Marines and going to Borderlands 2.

1386
01:53:12,668 --> 01:53:21,475
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm wondering if anything similar happened with the royalties for Duke Nukem Forever and going to Borderlands 2 as well.

1387
01:53:23,496 --> 01:53:27,619
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, Loki, I know you cared about this because you were asking some questions about it at E3.

1388
01:53:27,979 --> 01:53:30,661
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't see it at E3, but I think Bobby got a quick look at it.

1389
01:53:31,381 --> 01:53:33,143
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Mad Catz's Android console.

1390
01:53:33,183 --> 01:53:34,343
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just called Mojo now.

1391
01:53:34,363 --> 01:53:35,924
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not Project Mojo or any of that anymore.

1392
01:53:35,964 --> 01:53:36,865
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called Mojo.

1393
01:53:37,465 --> 01:53:44,630
[SPEAKER_06]: And unlike Ouya or what have you, Mojo will run stock Android and connects to the Google Play Store, just like any other smartphone or tablet.

1394
01:53:45,050 --> 01:53:50,174
[SPEAKER_06]: So all you need for a game to be playable on Mojo is that it has to come out for Android.

1395
01:53:50,774 --> 01:53:53,296
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can tie the Mojo device to your Google Play account.

1396
01:53:53,756 --> 01:53:58,899
[SPEAKER_06]: So essentially, this is just literally an Android box for your TV.

1397
01:53:59,139 --> 01:53:59,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Literally.

1398
01:53:59,799 --> 01:54:04,842
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and what's kind of cool about it, though, is it does support games that don't support controllers.

1399
01:54:05,282 --> 01:54:09,084
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can map your controls on the system.

1400
01:54:09,124 --> 01:54:13,606
[SPEAKER_10]: They also have emulation for touch controls using a mouse.

1401
01:54:13,646 --> 01:54:20,770
[SPEAKER_10]: You can plug in a mouse and keyboard, or you can just use the analog sticks to emulate touch controls as well.

1402
01:54:21,190 --> 01:54:26,734
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you can also map all your controls for whatever game on there.

1403
01:54:26,754 --> 01:54:28,635
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's pretty awesome that you can do that.

1404
01:54:28,775 --> 01:54:31,677
[SPEAKER_06]: And on the show floor, it was running on a Tegra 3 processor.

1405
01:54:31,717 --> 01:54:40,623
[SPEAKER_06]: It had HDMI output at 1080p, two USB inputs, 16 gigs of onboard storage that you can expand with mini SD, Bluetooth Classic, Bluetooth Smart.

1406
01:54:40,963 --> 01:54:42,964
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're saying, though, this is all subject to change.

1407
01:54:43,965 --> 01:54:44,846
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1408
01:54:59,945 --> 01:55:07,030
[SPEAKER_10]: and I'm wondering if they will increase or put a better processor in there but Taker 3 still though that means it's pretty cheap.

1409
01:55:07,370 --> 01:55:21,440
[SPEAKER_10]: It runs on Taker 3 and that's going to be $100 so probably looking around that price range and it's nice so that it supports Android apps just generic Android apps because probably a lot of people have that stuff.

1410
01:55:21,640 --> 01:55:24,862
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be a very interesting little counter to the Ouya.

1411
01:55:25,362 --> 01:55:26,143
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see what happens.

1412
01:55:27,103 --> 01:55:27,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on.

1413
01:55:28,536 --> 01:55:30,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we have some Nintendo news.

1414
01:55:31,077 --> 01:55:33,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, something come... I can never pronounce his last name right.

1415
01:55:34,478 --> 01:55:35,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Reggie Fils-Aimé, right?

1416
01:55:36,099 --> 01:55:36,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Fils-Aimé.

1417
01:55:37,219 --> 01:55:37,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, okay.

1418
01:55:38,319 --> 01:55:38,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Very French.

1419
01:55:40,100 --> 01:55:48,143
[SPEAKER_02]: He basically has gone on record saying that he has the key to limiting used game sales, and that's making better games.

1420
01:55:49,113 --> 01:55:51,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Making games that people are going to want to replay.

1421
01:55:53,117 --> 01:55:53,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a quote from him.

1422
01:55:53,998 --> 01:55:57,221
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, So we see that the trade-in frequency on Nintendo content is much less than the industry average.

1423
01:55:57,261 --> 01:55:57,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Much, much less.

1424
01:56:08,363 --> 01:56:11,725
[SPEAKER_02]: and, you know, I have to look at it in terms of my own collection.

1425
01:56:12,566 --> 01:56:16,829
[SPEAKER_02]: We really do get, when we trade anything in, it's almost always something that was on the 360.

1426
01:56:18,370 --> 01:56:23,313
[SPEAKER_02]: We, most of our PS3 games and our Wii games actually still have a lot of replayability.

1427
01:56:23,333 --> 01:56:24,674
[SPEAKER_02]: We still play our GameCube games.

1428
01:56:25,354 --> 01:56:28,536
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I actually really do agree, you know.

1429
01:56:29,697 --> 01:56:34,999
[SPEAKER_02]: You may be thinking that these are really simplistic games but they do have high replayability value.

1430
01:56:35,860 --> 01:56:41,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, for example, out of your collection, Rob, what do you say that you've played the most of?

1431
01:56:43,723 --> 01:56:47,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of all... What games do you always find yourself going back to play?

1432
01:56:47,306 --> 01:56:47,747
[SPEAKER_06]: MMOs.

1433
01:56:48,287 --> 01:56:49,028
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, okay.

1434
01:56:50,109 --> 01:56:50,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Besides MMOs.

1435
01:56:50,949 --> 01:56:51,950
[SPEAKER_14]: Those don't count.

1436
01:56:52,030 --> 01:56:55,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Games with the solid multi... Things I can play with my friends.

1437
01:56:55,173 --> 01:56:56,654
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that usually is MMOs.

1438
01:56:57,295 --> 01:57:01,439
[SPEAKER_06]: But like Mass Effect 3 was a good example because the multiplayer mode added a lot of life to that game.

1439
01:57:01,459 --> 01:57:02,740
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a whole lot with that one.

1440
01:57:03,220 --> 01:57:09,706
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think the thing, too, is that, like, okay, for example, any time that we have a party at my house, what happens?

1441
01:57:09,746 --> 01:57:10,647
[SPEAKER_02]: We bust out Rock Band.

1442
01:57:11,268 --> 01:57:11,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Good point, yeah.

1443
01:57:11,908 --> 01:57:14,210
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's the big thing that has the replayability.

1444
01:57:14,291 --> 01:57:19,816
[SPEAKER_02]: It used to be back in the day we'd bust out Smash Brothers or Mario Party or Mario Kart.

1445
01:57:19,836 --> 01:57:22,018
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd bring out a racing game that we could four-screen.

1446
01:57:22,038 --> 01:57:27,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that, you know, you could kind of screw with your friends and not feel bad about it because it was cute.

1447
01:57:27,223 --> 01:57:27,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1448
01:57:27,643 --> 01:57:30,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Solid multiplayer goes a long way in a game's life.

1449
01:57:31,148 --> 01:57:35,174
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not necessarily talking about just online, but having that old standby.

1450
01:57:36,312 --> 01:57:39,734
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the first thing that everybody else was saying when Animal Crossing came out?

1451
01:57:40,135 --> 01:57:40,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me your friend code.

1452
01:57:41,636 --> 01:57:44,077
[SPEAKER_02]: I need your village code.

1453
01:57:44,157 --> 01:57:44,958
[SPEAKER_06]: I need a peach.

1454
01:57:45,018 --> 01:57:45,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's got a peach?

1455
01:57:45,999 --> 01:57:47,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Come over to shake your trees.

1456
01:57:47,800 --> 01:57:55,685
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the whole strength that Nintendo games have like this is that instead of just having your friends list, you're building a community around the IP.

1457
01:57:56,706 --> 01:57:58,967
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that that also adds to their replayability.

1458
01:57:59,087 --> 01:58:02,630
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, you do see a lot fewer Nintendo games traded in.

1459
01:58:03,137 --> 01:58:07,279
[SPEAKER_06]: The street passing on Animal Crossing is so smart, too, because I love looking at other people's homes.

1460
01:58:07,819 --> 01:58:08,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1461
01:58:09,020 --> 01:58:09,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Fun.

1462
01:58:09,780 --> 01:58:12,462
[SPEAKER_02]: I also, by the way, was enjoying the Sahara quotes.

1463
01:58:13,682 --> 01:58:14,823
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait till I get my coffee.

1464
01:58:16,221 --> 01:58:16,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1465
01:58:17,822 --> 01:58:18,543
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that though.

1466
01:58:18,863 --> 01:58:19,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1467
01:58:19,684 --> 01:58:20,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Just make better games.

1468
01:58:20,684 --> 01:58:21,805
[SPEAKER_06]: You want people to stop selling them?

1469
01:58:21,825 --> 01:58:22,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Make them better.

1470
01:58:22,386 --> 01:58:23,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and it's simple.

1471
01:58:24,547 --> 01:58:27,149
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'll tell you this even.

1472
01:58:28,450 --> 01:58:30,672
[SPEAKER_02]: I go back and play SNES games all the time.

1473
01:58:31,333 --> 01:58:34,895
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're all kind of in that boat where we're classic gamers too.

1474
01:58:35,616 --> 01:58:40,820
[SPEAKER_02]: But I like to go back and play older games that I think are...

1475
01:58:44,068 --> 01:58:45,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Just still fun.

1476
01:58:45,811 --> 01:58:47,735
[SPEAKER_02]: We've even gone back and had Bomberman parties.

1477
01:58:49,257 --> 01:58:51,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Who doesn't like a good game of Bomberman?

1478
01:58:51,261 --> 01:58:53,905
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a game that's pretty much lasted through...

1479
01:58:55,268 --> 01:58:56,429
[SPEAKER_02]: through the years.

1480
01:58:56,870 --> 01:59:00,232
[SPEAKER_02]: It's solid, and that's what I think Nintendo's focusing on is making solid games.

1481
01:59:01,373 --> 01:59:02,915
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway.

1482
01:59:02,995 --> 01:59:07,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Queen Simia in our chat room is, I think, singing about peaches, saying, really love your peaches, want to shake your tree.

1483
01:59:09,020 --> 01:59:09,921
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't help it.

1484
01:59:09,961 --> 01:59:11,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Suddenly I'm thinking of the teaches of peaches.

1485
01:59:11,342 --> 01:59:11,883
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a song.

1486
01:59:14,125 --> 01:59:15,526
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the lyric from a song.

1487
01:59:15,546 --> 01:59:20,550
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, but now I'm thinking of peaches, the dirty, dirty musician from Canada who sings all the, you know.

1488
01:59:21,711 --> 01:59:24,293
[SPEAKER_02]: or now I'm thinking of the President of the United States.

1489
01:59:24,493 --> 01:59:26,595
[SPEAKER_06]: What else is in the teaches of peaches?

1490
01:59:26,795 --> 01:59:28,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, millions of peaches.

1491
01:59:29,097 --> 01:59:31,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but I don't know.

1492
01:59:31,939 --> 01:59:33,460
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't go wrong with a joker.

1493
01:59:33,820 --> 01:59:35,461
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, save us from the peach talk, Loki.

1494
01:59:37,062 --> 01:59:37,322
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

1495
01:59:37,503 --> 01:59:38,283
[SPEAKER_10]: We have to do that?

1496
01:59:38,343 --> 01:59:39,664
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1497
01:59:39,724 --> 01:59:40,725
[SPEAKER_10]: We can talk princess peach.

1498
01:59:42,762 --> 01:59:57,830
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so one of the theories, and definitely a theory I had, with a lot of people suspected, EA getting rid of their online pass just before the announcement of the Xbox One and its features.

1499
02:00:00,151 --> 02:00:09,336
[SPEAKER_10]: EA, though, saying that, hey, even though PlayStation 4 came out and revealed that they're not going to be kind of following suit with the Xbox One,

1500
02:00:09,996 --> 02:00:31,879
[SPEAKER_10]: they are still not going to bring back the online pass and also said you know of course reaffirmed that you know the getting rid of the online pass was not because of the Xbox One they say that it just wasn't working out for them and I don't know what to believe from it I kind of want one hand want to just say I don't buy it because I think that they were kind of banking on both systems doing that but

1501
02:00:32,079 --> 02:00:32,740
[SPEAKER_10]: and DarkSakura.com.

1502
02:00:48,157 --> 02:01:16,380
[SPEAKER_10]: just make it easier for people to buy games and then just have a ton of DLC I don't know if necessarily Nickelodeon and Diamond but they've attempted to do that with Dead Space 3 and stuff so maybe that's where they're kind of seeing it and I think that kind of makes sense also with the Xbox One and their game sharing is that's where they're probably going to try to make a lot of the money is since you're not buying copies of the games and you're going to get a lot less sales now because of that that DLC is going to be more

1503
02:01:17,160 --> 02:01:22,123
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you all love it when we keep bringing this game up, but Mass Effect 3 really did it great.

1504
02:01:22,403 --> 02:01:27,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Not just the free DLC, but all the story DLC was so good.

1505
02:01:28,046 --> 02:01:29,706
[SPEAKER_14]: Especially with the big apology.

1506
02:01:30,107 --> 02:01:36,830
[SPEAKER_06]: To be fair, it was probably better in Mass Effect 2 overall, but still, a good example of DLC done right.

1507
02:01:36,890 --> 02:01:38,211
[SPEAKER_06]: None of it flat out sucked.

1508
02:01:38,731 --> 02:01:39,911
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't sit there and go to the DLC.

1509
02:01:40,172 --> 02:01:44,414
[SPEAKER_06]: There were things you could complain about later.

1510
02:01:44,514 --> 02:01:44,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1511
02:01:45,494 --> 02:01:45,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

1512
02:01:46,175 --> 02:01:47,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what happens in Omega?

1513
02:01:47,756 --> 02:01:49,438
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, did I mention a particular one?

1514
02:01:49,578 --> 02:01:49,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1515
02:01:51,499 --> 02:01:55,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I did completely find the Citadel DLC absolutely hilarious.

1516
02:01:55,663 --> 02:01:56,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying.

1517
02:01:57,424 --> 02:02:05,150
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, of course, they're saying that now they're working on this gamer-first use game policy for next-gen.

1518
02:02:05,170 --> 02:02:06,331
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1519
02:02:07,652 --> 02:02:11,175
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, I don't know what exactly that means.

1520
02:02:11,595 --> 02:02:13,296
[SPEAKER_10]: Gamers first and customer first?

1521
02:02:13,416 --> 02:02:19,380
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that mean that there are going to be no restrictions at all or they're going to try something else?

1522
02:02:21,682 --> 02:02:22,062
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1523
02:02:22,142 --> 02:02:22,963
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm guessing that...

1524
02:02:24,341 --> 02:02:25,021
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not this idea.

1525
02:02:25,362 --> 02:02:34,346
[SPEAKER_10]: Although I think it's made it definitely the response to the Xbox One DRM and limiting news game sales and online passings.

1526
02:02:34,566 --> 02:02:39,549
[SPEAKER_10]: I definitely think that publishers are aware of the perception of that.

1527
02:02:39,609 --> 02:02:43,091
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think they will maybe think twice about implementing that in the future.

1528
02:02:44,892 --> 02:02:48,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Especially if Sony's not doing it anymore and EA's not doing it anymore.

1529
02:02:49,114 --> 02:02:49,814
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's really left?

1530
02:02:50,074 --> 02:02:53,076
[SPEAKER_10]: Warner Games and Ubisoft.

1531
02:02:53,116 --> 02:02:53,196
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1532
02:02:54,236 --> 02:02:54,616
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

1533
02:02:55,137 --> 02:02:58,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Ubisoft has their whole little tie-in service to Uplay.

1534
02:02:58,458 --> 02:03:00,438
[SPEAKER_10]: They can invest in that.

1535
02:03:00,778 --> 02:03:03,339
[SPEAKER_10]: That could still be free, but right now they're still passing.

1536
02:03:03,559 --> 02:03:07,541
[SPEAKER_10]: THQ can't do it anymore because they're out of business and Deep Silver is not continuing with that, I think.

1537
02:03:08,341 --> 02:03:10,462
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm pretty sure they're not because they didn't with Metro.

1538
02:03:13,322 --> 02:03:14,763
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of on its way out already.

1539
02:03:16,212 --> 02:03:24,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, before we get to the next story, a very interesting breaking news that a lot of our chatters are talking about is a tweet that just showed up from Bobby.

1540
02:03:26,183 --> 02:03:28,345
[SPEAKER_06]: My house just got struck by lightning.

1541
02:03:29,066 --> 02:03:30,347
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why he disappeared from chat.

1542
02:03:30,467 --> 02:03:32,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of my electronics are fried.

1543
02:03:32,990 --> 02:03:33,551
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm fine.

1544
02:03:33,571 --> 02:03:33,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy crap.

1545
02:03:34,151 --> 02:03:46,841
[SPEAKER_06]: But Bobby seems like the type that would have had a surge protector on everything He was telling me to get the power source for the computer When all that stuff went down with one of the live shows But a surge protector isn't a cure-all, trust me

1546
02:03:48,154 --> 02:03:49,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I hope everything's okay.

1547
02:03:49,275 --> 02:03:52,376
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had a hard drive melted that was hooked to a surge protector.

1548
02:03:52,396 --> 02:03:57,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm hoping when he says fried that he means like they're just, you know, all they need is a quick little fix or something.

1549
02:03:57,859 --> 02:04:04,322
[SPEAKER_06]: But seeing that Bobby does a lot with electronics, especially with the VOG, that's a big deal.

1550
02:04:04,342 --> 02:04:07,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, just stay in touch with us and let us know what we need to do if he can hear.

1551
02:04:07,724 --> 02:04:11,005
[SPEAKER_10]: What's up with Lightning and taking out people that do like tech blog stuff?

1552
02:04:11,285 --> 02:04:12,966
[SPEAKER_10]: Because usually they're connected.

1553
02:04:13,106 --> 02:04:14,407
[SPEAKER_10]: Ars Technica, you know, they...

1554
02:04:15,327 --> 02:04:16,468
[SPEAKER_10]: The guy actually got hit by lightning.

1555
02:04:16,488 --> 02:04:18,969
[SPEAKER_10]: They can't stop cranking out lightning video games.

1556
02:04:19,730 --> 02:04:35,478
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was living with my extra mate, and this was back in the days of dial-up, but we still had a surge protector on both the power supply and on the cable, the internet cable.

1557
02:04:36,439 --> 02:04:41,962
[SPEAKER_02]: And still with the direct shot from lightning to her antenna, we fried her hard drive.

1558
02:04:42,782 --> 02:04:43,503
[SPEAKER_02]: And the modem.

1559
02:04:44,013 --> 02:04:50,916
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really good that you didn't have an Xbox One connected at this time because literally a lightning strike would turn it into a killing death machine.

1560
02:04:50,996 --> 02:04:55,018
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, it's a good thing that we're still months away.

1561
02:04:55,478 --> 02:05:01,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I hope everything's all right because I know his day job relies on electronics and all that.

1562
02:05:01,601 --> 02:05:05,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I agree with VXJasonXV who said, hopefully you just meant that figuratively.

1563
02:05:05,523 --> 02:05:06,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I hope so too.

1564
02:05:07,584 --> 02:05:08,124
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope so too.

1565
02:05:08,545 --> 02:05:09,305
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll find out soon.

1566
02:05:10,426 --> 02:05:14,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on, let me get back to the gaming news we had on deck tonight.

1567
02:05:15,650 --> 02:05:18,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo could be releasing a free-to-play game.

1568
02:05:19,994 --> 02:05:23,437
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, it would be within the fiscal year, which would end on March 2014.

1569
02:05:24,678 --> 02:05:28,220
[SPEAKER_06]: It was during an analyst briefing at E3 that this was announced.

1570
02:05:28,261 --> 02:05:29,882
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is something that's actually happening.

1571
02:05:29,922 --> 02:05:32,204
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a Mario game, it's not a Pokemon game.

1572
02:05:32,604 --> 02:05:35,567
[SPEAKER_06]: But it could be an already existing franchise to a brand new IP.

1573
02:05:36,207 --> 02:05:42,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Now Destructoid had an interesting theory that it could be an Advance Wars game because that would seem to fit in very well.

1574
02:05:43,109 --> 02:05:48,231
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean it makes a lot of sense for what could show up on the Wii U and would work with the free-to-play model generally well.

1575
02:05:49,871 --> 02:05:55,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though a lot of people associate free-to-play with shit games, there's some free-to-play games that are pretty cool.

1576
02:05:56,073 --> 02:05:57,313
[SPEAKER_06]: What about like if it's an MMO?

1577
02:05:57,593 --> 02:05:59,014
[SPEAKER_06]: MMO, it could be Dragon Quest X.

1578
02:06:01,616 --> 02:06:02,497
[SPEAKER_06]: I love your thought, but no.

1579
02:06:02,537 --> 02:06:02,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Just no.

1580
02:06:02,978 --> 02:06:03,979
[SPEAKER_06]: I would love to be wrong about that, but...

1581
02:06:18,092 --> 02:06:20,055
[SPEAKER_06]: I would love to, but I kind of doubt it.

1582
02:06:20,916 --> 02:06:22,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's get to the mailbag.

1583
02:06:23,119 --> 02:06:24,961
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't doubt that you guys send us emails every week.

1584
02:06:25,021 --> 02:06:30,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com And we answer the emails here on the program.

1585
02:06:31,289 --> 02:06:32,290
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, yeah.

1586
02:06:32,471 --> 02:06:34,553
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure it's been filling up a little bit after E3.

1587
02:06:35,194 --> 02:06:35,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we have four.

1588
02:06:36,355 --> 02:06:36,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1589
02:06:36,695 --> 02:06:37,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Four legit.

1590
02:06:37,416 --> 02:06:37,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Four legit.

1591
02:06:39,397 --> 02:06:44,781
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one comes from Robert M. Right now, MCPE is my only Minecraft.

1592
02:06:45,341 --> 02:06:45,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.

1593
02:06:45,822 --> 02:06:47,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Not counting the Lego set.

1594
02:06:47,623 --> 02:06:50,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's much more convenient for me during commuting and breaks.

1595
02:06:51,806 --> 02:06:58,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, Realms won't be of much use to me at home since the app freezes when I open it connected to my home Wi-Fi.

1596
02:06:58,490 --> 02:07:01,472
[SPEAKER_02]: This does not seem to affect other apps and I can't access...

1597
02:07:02,393 --> 02:07:02,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1598
02:07:02,673 --> 02:07:04,234
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't expect anyone to be able to tech support on this.

1599
02:07:04,254 --> 02:07:04,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Just odd.

1600
02:07:04,814 --> 02:07:05,274
[SPEAKER_02]: That's his haiku.

1601
02:07:05,314 --> 02:07:05,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, cute.

1602
02:07:06,135 --> 02:07:06,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1603
02:07:06,475 --> 02:07:07,195
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

1604
02:07:24,649 --> 02:07:27,312
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure why the issue is with your local Wi-Fi.

1605
02:07:28,193 --> 02:07:38,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, oddly enough, there's certain apps that I have that require a connection that won't necessarily work on my Wi-Fi, but they'll work on the 3G and they'll work elsewhere.

1606
02:07:39,085 --> 02:07:43,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe the problem is related to why the station keeps fucking dropping while we're trying to do a show.

1607
02:07:45,031 --> 02:07:46,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we have the same provider, I don't know.

1608
02:07:46,693 --> 02:07:46,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

1609
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:48,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Howdy, sentient creatures.

1610
02:07:49,781 --> 02:07:52,823
[SPEAKER_02]: After listening to episode 507, I have two thoughts.

1611
02:07:52,883 --> 02:07:53,983
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, a haiku.

1612
02:07:54,924 --> 02:07:57,345
[SPEAKER_02]: I was right, but I didn't want to be right.

1613
02:07:57,465 --> 02:07:58,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn, The Last Guardian.

1614
02:07:59,946 --> 02:08:02,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Second, I have a holiday-style greeting for E3.

1615
02:08:03,048 --> 02:08:04,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy hyperbolic statement period.

1616
02:08:05,489 --> 02:08:07,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay black, Redertainment Trainer.

1617
02:08:09,931 --> 02:08:10,291
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1618
02:08:11,392 --> 02:08:13,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes it's painful to be right.

1619
02:08:15,441 --> 02:08:16,402
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from Sam.

1620
02:08:17,722 --> 02:08:19,663
[SPEAKER_02]: And the message is, Happy E3, OLR Crew.

1621
02:08:20,844 --> 02:08:25,106
[SPEAKER_02]: One game I failed to see from Ubisoft this E3 is Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Patriots.

1622
02:08:25,527 --> 02:08:29,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think the game has been renamed and re-revealed as Tom Clancy's The Division?

1623
02:08:31,201 --> 02:08:35,422
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't think Do you think Ubisoft has more than one team on Tom Clancy games?

1624
02:08:35,642 --> 02:08:58,927
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think so I wouldn't be surprised It doesn't even look similar at all It's probably just something They have Blacklist coming out now I think it's probably being made now for next gen and so it's just Bump back a little bit Fair enough I'm with Loki It could be quarter four next year It makes sense, I think

1625
02:09:00,560 --> 02:09:01,881
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was answering a question in chat.

1626
02:09:02,321 --> 02:09:05,524
[SPEAKER_02]: I happened to mention that my ex-roommate from college got struck by lightning.

1627
02:09:06,465 --> 02:09:08,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Came in smelling that buzzy smell.

1628
02:09:08,927 --> 02:09:09,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Ew.

1629
02:09:09,167 --> 02:09:10,528
[SPEAKER_02]: With her hair sticking up.

1630
02:09:10,908 --> 02:09:11,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Ew.

1631
02:09:11,148 --> 02:09:14,151
[SPEAKER_02]: And she just said, I got struck by lightning.

1632
02:09:14,391 --> 02:09:15,752
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, Meglet, are you okay?

1633
02:09:15,792 --> 02:09:16,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Her name was Meg.

1634
02:09:16,292 --> 02:09:16,873
[SPEAKER_02]: We called her Meglet.

1635
02:09:17,233 --> 02:09:18,874
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, are you okay?

1636
02:09:19,275 --> 02:09:20,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm gonna lay down.

1637
02:09:21,616 --> 02:09:23,438
[SPEAKER_02]: And she didn't get up the rest of the day.

1638
02:09:23,458 --> 02:09:24,519
[SPEAKER_02]: I kept checking on her.

1639
02:09:24,859 --> 02:09:25,960
[SPEAKER_02]: She got up and she was just fine.

1640
02:09:28,953 --> 02:09:30,273
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a lot of weird stories.

1641
02:09:30,654 --> 02:09:33,274
[SPEAKER_02]: And then she said it was the second time in her life she'd been struck by lightning.

1642
02:09:33,535 --> 02:09:34,695
[SPEAKER_10]: Go buy a lottery ticket.

1643
02:09:34,735 --> 02:09:35,435
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously.

1644
02:09:35,475 --> 02:09:38,216
[SPEAKER_10]: I just asked Bobby if it took out the fence.

1645
02:09:40,417 --> 02:09:42,618
[SPEAKER_06]: You're such an asshole.

1646
02:09:43,178 --> 02:09:45,639
[SPEAKER_06]: He probably lost some of his computers and stuff.

1647
02:09:45,659 --> 02:09:46,959
[SPEAKER_06]: You're like, did it hit the fence?

1648
02:09:47,539 --> 02:09:48,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby, I'm sorry for laughing.

1649
02:09:48,780 --> 02:09:50,140
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes me a horrible human being.

1650
02:09:50,760 --> 02:09:51,921
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been in your place.

1651
02:09:52,718 --> 02:09:55,460
[SPEAKER_06]: His kitties were at the boarding thing.

1652
02:09:55,480 --> 02:09:56,741
[SPEAKER_06]: He can't pick them up till Monday.

1653
02:09:57,141 --> 02:09:59,642
[SPEAKER_06]: So the cats aren't affected, just so you guys know.

1654
02:09:59,922 --> 02:10:00,503
[SPEAKER_06]: That's important.

1655
02:10:00,583 --> 02:10:01,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay for the kitties.

1656
02:10:01,904 --> 02:10:02,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Think of the kitties.

1657
02:10:03,264 --> 02:10:04,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Last email, Rob.

1658
02:10:04,525 --> 02:10:08,127
[SPEAKER_02]: And this one is a poem written by Degenerate Johnny.

1659
02:10:08,748 --> 02:10:09,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Shall I read it?

1660
02:10:11,302 --> 02:10:21,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, E3 has lived up to its name, the event has proven it's still relevant, gamers rejoiced at the sight of upcoming titles, and judging from the drill pedals, E3 is also salivant.

1661
02:10:23,107 --> 02:10:33,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft promises a year of excitement, one full of fun features and games, unfortunately some of them seem to be disappointing, especially the ones that suffer drops in sound and frames.

1662
02:10:34,452 --> 02:10:36,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Indeed, Microsoft did not address the hard issues.

1663
02:10:36,894 --> 02:10:38,455
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems this year they're rolling the dice.

1664
02:10:38,955 --> 02:10:43,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Without explanation of online benefits, $500 is too steep of a price.

1665
02:10:44,379 --> 02:10:45,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony's conference was impressive.

1666
02:10:45,900 --> 02:10:47,881
[SPEAKER_02]: It was full of exciting announcements and games.

1667
02:10:48,401 --> 02:10:53,205
[SPEAKER_02]: With the announcement of no restrictions on used titles, it almost made up for Sony's previous shames.

1668
02:10:53,965 --> 02:10:57,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Indeed, Jack Trenton was on Cloud9.

1669
02:10:57,327 --> 02:10:58,288
[SPEAKER_02]: You could see it on his face.

1670
02:10:58,708 --> 02:11:00,710
[SPEAKER_02]: The chanting of Sony's name was most telling.

1671
02:11:00,770 --> 02:11:03,752
[SPEAKER_02]: The PS4 will start ahead in the console race.

1672
02:11:04,512 --> 02:11:06,293
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Generation 6 all over again.

1673
02:11:06,333 --> 02:11:08,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony will come out on top real fast.

1674
02:11:08,433 --> 02:11:12,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Wii U started with no games just like the GameCube but will Xbone go the way of the Dreamcast?

1675
02:11:13,915 --> 02:11:16,675
[SPEAKER_02]: The excitement and energy never stops at E3.

1676
02:11:17,076 --> 02:11:18,856
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an event full of comedy and tragedy.

1677
02:11:19,416 --> 02:11:25,758
[SPEAKER_02]: All I can say is that I can't wait for this holiday season and I'm sure the same can be said for the OL Army.

1678
02:11:26,758 --> 02:11:29,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Wishing a tubular E3 to all gamers and fathers.

1679
02:11:30,179 --> 02:11:30,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Degenerate Johnny.

1680
02:11:32,660 --> 02:11:33,560
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I cried a little.

1681
02:11:34,051 --> 02:11:36,512
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a very clever little poem.

1682
02:11:36,672 --> 02:11:37,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1683
02:11:37,152 --> 02:11:37,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Good job.

1684
02:11:38,192 --> 02:11:39,792
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be posted on our forums.

1685
02:11:41,873 --> 02:11:43,193
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's an update from Bobby.

1686
02:11:44,073 --> 02:11:48,555
[SPEAKER_06]: I know this is not gaming news, but obviously we care about Bobby and want him to be alright.

1687
02:11:49,375 --> 02:11:57,557
[SPEAKER_06]: As of right now, it looks like I lost all my routers and switches, my audio receiver, my 360, and my Wii U. Ooh.

1688
02:11:58,737 --> 02:11:59,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

1689
02:12:00,818 --> 02:12:02,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Are acts of God under warranty?

1690
02:12:03,805 --> 02:12:04,425
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1691
02:12:05,186 --> 02:12:06,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully he's got insurance or something.

1692
02:12:06,746 --> 02:12:08,927
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's got to be like a homeowner's insurance.

1693
02:12:08,947 --> 02:12:09,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, homeowner's insurance.

1694
02:12:09,868 --> 02:12:15,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, most homeowner's insurance will have some type of personal property.

1695
02:12:15,930 --> 02:12:16,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Christ.

1696
02:12:16,610 --> 02:12:17,771
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's not just dwelling.

1697
02:12:18,091 --> 02:12:23,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone from, if not for some reason, anyone from Microsoft or Nintendo listening that can help him out?

1698
02:12:23,553 --> 02:12:28,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, one thing I can tell you is that... Oh, God, I wonder if that was his special 360.

1699
02:12:28,055 --> 02:12:28,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1700
02:12:30,529 --> 02:12:33,010
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to say too much, but he had a very special 360.

1701
02:12:33,330 --> 02:12:34,551
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope that wasn't it.

1702
02:12:35,811 --> 02:12:43,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I can tell you that most insurances in the South, as far as I'm aware, definitely have some sort of hard weather coverage.

1703
02:12:44,734 --> 02:12:49,776
[SPEAKER_06]: It's required, so... VXJSXV says acts of God are explicitly not covered by warranty.

1704
02:12:50,897 --> 02:12:55,738
[SPEAKER_06]: I would still hope, though, that there would be some type of... I think homeowners insurance would cover something like that.

1705
02:12:55,758 --> 02:12:59,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Homeowners insurance or something, yeah.

1706
02:12:59,660 --> 02:12:59,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Oof.

1707
02:12:59,760 --> 02:12:59,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Lordy.

1708
02:12:59,880 --> 02:12:59,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1709
02:13:01,489 --> 02:13:03,230
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been in that position.

1710
02:13:03,270 --> 02:13:03,971
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel that pain.

1711
02:13:04,591 --> 02:13:08,174
[SPEAKER_02]: People underestimate the weather, especially back east.

1712
02:13:10,444 --> 02:13:10,704
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1713
02:13:11,204 --> 02:13:12,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that it for the mailbag?

1714
02:13:12,645 --> 02:13:13,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it is.

1715
02:13:13,305 --> 02:13:13,485
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1716
02:13:13,525 --> 02:13:14,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.

1717
02:13:17,486 --> 02:13:21,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Another reason I keep reporting on what's going on with Bobby, he may not be back to do a show next week.

1718
02:13:23,467 --> 02:13:24,567
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not confirmed yet.

1719
02:13:24,747 --> 02:13:26,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Just let him make that announcement.

1720
02:13:26,208 --> 02:13:28,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Watch his Twitter because clearly his cell phone still works.

1721
02:13:28,328 --> 02:13:31,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby will be calling us and doing it on Skype.

1722
02:13:32,689 --> 02:14:01,733
[SPEAKER_06]: He's more than welcome to, we'll be here Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week How appropriate Well then, first off First off, I think an FU from all of us to Lightning

1723
02:14:02,549 --> 02:14:11,814
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to go ahead, though, and give, especially Brad in the chat room, but people have already been bringing it up, already thinking of ways to help Bobby replace his stuff.

1724
02:14:12,634 --> 02:14:14,935
[SPEAKER_02]: We seriously have the best listeners.

1725
02:14:15,476 --> 02:14:15,896
[SPEAKER_02]: We do.

1726
02:14:15,996 --> 02:14:16,456
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

1727
02:14:16,556 --> 02:14:27,582
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually, this is one of the things Bobby and I were talking about, is that, you know, if the Voice Geeks Network, we don't have the biggest audience, and that's okay, because I seriously think we have the most loyal audience.

1728
02:14:27,682 --> 02:14:29,183
[SPEAKER_06]: And we are so fortunate to have that.

1729
02:14:29,243 --> 02:14:29,883
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are awesome.

1730
02:14:30,883 --> 02:14:36,265
[SPEAKER_02]: We have people listening to us that not just give of their time to listen, they give of themselves.

1731
02:14:37,045 --> 02:14:39,685
[SPEAKER_02]: And we like to give back to you as much as we can.

1732
02:14:40,166 --> 02:14:49,108
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, I don't need 10,000 listeners if we have 100 awesome, loyal listeners.

1733
02:14:49,148 --> 02:14:49,768
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

1734
02:14:49,828 --> 02:14:50,628
[SPEAKER_06]: It means so much more.

1735
02:14:50,768 --> 02:14:53,949
[SPEAKER_02]: And how many of our listeners are we actually totally good friends with now?

1736
02:14:54,069 --> 02:14:54,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.

1737
02:14:54,869 --> 02:14:56,230
[SPEAKER_10]: I probably don't need five 360s either.

1738
02:14:58,243 --> 02:14:59,623
[SPEAKER_06]: You probably don't, sir.

1739
02:14:59,744 --> 02:15:01,844
[SPEAKER_10]: I could probably lend him one.

1740
02:15:01,864 --> 02:15:02,324
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we'll see.

1741
02:15:02,344 --> 02:15:03,285
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully he's got insurance.

1742
02:15:03,305 --> 02:15:03,905
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll find out.

1743
02:15:03,985 --> 02:15:05,586
[SPEAKER_06]: I have bad ones.

1744
02:15:05,686 --> 02:15:06,686
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't do you any well.

1745
02:15:06,726 --> 02:15:13,448
[SPEAKER_06]: He's probably trying to process a lot right now, so let's give him a little space, and then I'm sure he'll be able to clear up what's up.

1746
02:15:13,468 --> 02:15:14,649
[SPEAKER_02]: I can lend him an NES.

1747
02:15:15,649 --> 02:15:15,789
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1748
02:15:16,609 --> 02:15:21,891
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, my FU for today goes towards people who drive like assholes.

1749
02:15:21,991 --> 02:15:23,352
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not just talking about...

1750
02:15:24,292 --> 02:15:25,273
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1751
02:15:46,352 --> 02:15:50,377
[SPEAKER_02]: had tried to get up in the front and cut that person off, but Lexus was just a better driver.

1752
02:15:50,957 --> 02:15:57,685
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the BMW driver swerves around and cuts off the BMW driver as soon as there's two lanes again.

1753
02:15:58,566 --> 02:16:01,990
[SPEAKER_02]: And I swear that was almost a Rurander.

1754
02:16:02,350 --> 02:16:03,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Mako drivers, fuck them.

1755
02:16:04,252 --> 02:16:05,393
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that would be me.

1756
02:16:05,734 --> 02:16:07,155
[SPEAKER_02]: I drive the Mako horribly.

1757
02:16:08,757 --> 02:16:16,464
[SPEAKER_02]: and then I think that I've got a sore throat and F you to not having a job.

1758
02:16:17,225 --> 02:16:18,066
[SPEAKER_02]: I need one of those.

1759
02:16:19,127 --> 02:16:23,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody that I've ever sent applications to, hire me because I'm a really good person.

1760
02:16:24,451 --> 02:16:25,372
[SPEAKER_02]: I will work hard for you.

1761
02:16:26,653 --> 02:16:28,395
[SPEAKER_02]: That and I'm really good with InDesign.

1762
02:16:31,218 --> 02:16:31,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki?

1763
02:16:32,713 --> 02:16:40,436
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck you to FPSbox.com, our previous host of the Minecraft server for the VOG Network.

1764
02:16:41,076 --> 02:16:45,578
[SPEAKER_10]: And basically, I guess it got sold off or something happened.

1765
02:16:45,818 --> 02:16:48,439
[SPEAKER_10]: And basically, the website's running in autopilot.

1766
02:16:48,519 --> 02:16:51,520
[SPEAKER_10]: So when the servers go down, nobody answers support.

1767
02:16:51,920 --> 02:16:53,460
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no phone anymore.

1768
02:16:53,821 --> 02:16:54,861
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no email.

1769
02:16:55,361 --> 02:16:56,401
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody cares.

1770
02:16:56,681 --> 02:17:01,083
[SPEAKER_10]: And so actually taking a look at some of the servers that are online, most of them are down right now.

1771
02:17:01,403 --> 02:17:04,704
[SPEAKER_10]: And what sucks is the FTP portion of it's down as well.

1772
02:17:04,744 --> 02:17:07,425
[SPEAKER_10]: So I can't... I have backups of the server.

1773
02:17:07,985 --> 02:17:12,106
[SPEAKER_10]: I can make backups, but I can't access any of them because they're on the FTP server.

1774
02:17:12,506 --> 02:17:14,847
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's something with the authentication.

1775
02:17:14,867 --> 02:17:14,927
[SPEAKER_10]: It

1776
02:17:15,507 --> 02:17:17,829
[SPEAKER_10]: It keeps saying that I have the wrong password even though I don't.

1777
02:17:19,610 --> 02:17:20,531
[SPEAKER_10]: And it doesn't matter.

1778
02:17:20,711 --> 02:17:24,334
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can't reset it either because their reset password thing is broken.

1779
02:17:26,256 --> 02:17:28,717
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'll just have to start anew if we're actually going to do it.

1780
02:17:28,998 --> 02:17:29,898
[SPEAKER_10]: And who knows?

1781
02:17:29,958 --> 02:17:31,700
[SPEAKER_10]: We haven't been getting a lot of people on there anyways.

1782
02:17:31,720 --> 02:17:32,861
[SPEAKER_10]: Might as well just save myself $10 a month.

1783
02:17:32,881 --> 02:17:33,121
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see.

1784
02:17:37,182 --> 02:17:37,883
[SPEAKER_10]: I may change my mind.

1785
02:17:37,963 --> 02:17:46,492
[SPEAKER_10]: There's other hosts out there that'll actually let me upload my own JAR files, which I wanted to do in the first place so that we could have cool things like airplanes and cars and guns.

1786
02:17:48,054 --> 02:17:48,915
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally want a gun.

1787
02:17:49,956 --> 02:17:51,097
[SPEAKER_10]: They have Mass Effect guns, too.

1788
02:17:51,277 --> 02:17:51,598
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1789
02:17:51,658 --> 02:17:57,564
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally just redid my little sprite to look like my Minecraft person to look like Shepard.

1790
02:17:57,584 --> 02:17:57,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

1791
02:17:58,493 --> 02:18:05,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, I'm just going to give an F you to traffic as well because some bitch cut me off today on the freeway and it's like when you're going 80 miles an hour, don't be cutting me off.

1792
02:18:05,555 --> 02:18:06,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Does she drive a BMW?

1793
02:18:06,815 --> 02:18:09,176
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but I did see a couple of asshole BMW drivers.

1794
02:18:09,216 --> 02:18:12,617
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not saying that all BMW drivers are assholes, but I'm just saying I see a lot of them.

1795
02:18:12,837 --> 02:18:14,997
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm starting to agree with Jeremy Clarkson, by the way.

1796
02:18:15,558 --> 02:18:16,398
[SPEAKER_02]: BMW drivers.

1797
02:18:17,018 --> 02:18:18,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, I had a pretty good week.

1798
02:18:18,258 --> 02:18:18,858
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't complain.

1799
02:18:18,918 --> 02:18:20,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, Matt is a good BMW driver.

1800
02:18:22,802 --> 02:18:25,825
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to Disneyland for me missing it so much.

1801
02:18:26,986 --> 02:18:28,026
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to awkward moments.

1802
02:18:28,807 --> 02:18:29,568
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll say that too.

1803
02:18:29,808 --> 02:18:30,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

1804
02:18:30,588 --> 02:18:31,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Very awkward moment.

1805
02:18:31,769 --> 02:18:32,590
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you off air.

1806
02:18:32,610 --> 02:18:33,671
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not appropriate for on air.

1807
02:18:33,731 --> 02:18:34,572
[SPEAKER_02]: It has nothing to do with the show.

1808
02:18:34,652 --> 02:18:37,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how about also F yous to elusive ties?

1809
02:18:39,756 --> 02:18:40,076
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1810
02:18:41,017 --> 02:18:44,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's move on with a couple more stories and then we'll get to Skyblind.

1811
02:18:44,800 --> 02:18:45,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Skyblind.

1812
02:18:46,565 --> 02:18:55,211
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, so the new thing for Xbox One, of course, they're talking about their system for achievements and stuff.

1813
02:18:55,251 --> 02:19:07,059
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be a little bit different, which, by the way, I got to add, you know, this is one thing we didn't talk about, but press conference, they have the day one edition that gives you DLC that is an achievement.

1814
02:19:08,020 --> 02:19:08,780
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's kind of lame.

1815
02:19:10,822 --> 02:19:15,545
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure it's just stupid, like, you know, we were, you know, we bought it day one type thing.

1816
02:19:15,905 --> 02:19:16,605
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1817
02:19:45,991 --> 02:19:49,213
[SPEAKER_10]: and everybody that participated got some stuff.

1818
02:19:49,613 --> 02:19:51,654
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to say, I think it was Halo, maybe Halo Reach.

1819
02:19:53,174 --> 02:20:05,900
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they're saying that also Xbox One video and music apps can also use achievements to reward people that seek peak content to early access or subscription extensions.

1820
02:20:08,041 --> 02:20:09,901
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's interesting that they're going to be doing all that stuff.

1821
02:20:11,122 --> 02:20:13,663
[SPEAKER_10]: It sounds interesting that they're kind of revamping their achievement system.

1822
02:20:16,085 --> 02:20:16,506
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1823
02:20:16,526 --> 02:20:16,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Just curious.

1824
02:20:37,611 --> 02:20:44,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, before we get to your calls tonight, one more story tonight, and it's to kind of put the wrap on all the E3 stories tonight.

1825
02:20:45,197 --> 02:20:48,620
[SPEAKER_06]: E3 this year, 48,200 attendees.

1826
02:20:48,680 --> 02:20:51,342
[SPEAKER_06]: That's an increase of 2,500 from the prior year.

1827
02:20:51,362 --> 02:20:53,884
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to bite my tongue, bite my tongue, bite my tongue.

1828
02:20:55,644 --> 02:21:20,012
[SPEAKER_06]: 40 million dollars in revenue brought to the city of Los Angeles from that next year's E3 June 10th through the 12th also at the LA Convention Center but what will be interesting about next year's show this isn't in the news story but I just if you've been paying attention there will be no more West Hall that's what they're tearing down to make Farmers Field so it'll be interesting to see which is the football stadium for the football team that LA doesn't have yet hello Kensha Hall

1829
02:21:21,513 --> 02:21:21,873
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1830
02:21:21,893 --> 02:21:22,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1831
02:21:22,513 --> 02:21:24,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that mean Kensha Hall is used next year?

1832
02:21:24,474 --> 02:21:26,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Or the rumor is they're going to build it.

1833
02:21:26,856 --> 02:21:31,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's not a rumor, but they're going to build an expansion on the other side of the street.

1834
02:21:31,939 --> 02:21:34,461
[SPEAKER_06]: But when will that be done is anyone's guess.

1835
02:21:35,161 --> 02:21:35,942
[SPEAKER_10]: We have parking a lot.

1836
02:21:37,623 --> 02:21:38,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

1837
02:21:38,163 --> 02:21:38,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

1838
02:21:38,823 --> 02:21:39,604
[SPEAKER_06]: But there you go.

1839
02:21:41,305 --> 02:21:44,047
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a question I didn't get to ask about E3 this year.

1840
02:21:44,247 --> 02:21:44,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

1841
02:21:44,527 --> 02:21:49,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Is if they were still handing out balls like they did every year.

1842
02:21:51,721 --> 02:21:54,311
[SPEAKER_02]: That used to be the only time I would ever get balls.

1843
02:21:55,836 --> 02:21:56,720
[SPEAKER_02]: So, just saying.

1844
02:21:58,363 --> 02:22:01,624
[SPEAKER_06]: and Bobby says his podcast gear is fine.

1845
02:22:01,964 --> 02:22:03,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

1846
02:22:03,805 --> 02:22:06,026
[SPEAKER_06]: The audio receiver is for my surround sound.

1847
02:22:06,066 --> 02:22:08,787
[SPEAKER_06]: So it sounds like his living room got fucked up most of all.

1848
02:22:08,867 --> 02:22:10,047
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it sounds like.

1849
02:22:10,107 --> 02:22:12,628
[SPEAKER_10]: He could probably have my audio receiver too because I don't use that either.

1850
02:22:13,208 --> 02:22:14,689
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody's all nice.

1851
02:22:14,889 --> 02:22:17,010
[SPEAKER_10]: I just gotta say, you guys rule.

1852
02:22:17,110 --> 02:22:26,373
[SPEAKER_10]: I have like a surround sound system that we don't use anymore because Josh is asleep when we watch TV and so we don't need a blast surround sound anymore.

1853
02:22:26,593 --> 02:22:31,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, I haven't even given out the damn number and already the Skype line lighting up.

1854
02:22:31,758 --> 02:22:37,064
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, but you'll have to wait for this guy.

1855
02:22:38,445 --> 02:22:39,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's on the line here?

1856
02:22:39,606 --> 02:22:40,287
[SPEAKER_06]: You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1857
02:22:40,307 --> 02:22:40,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1858
02:22:41,228 --> 02:22:42,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Orange Lounge Radio?

1859
02:22:42,209 --> 02:22:44,632
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought I was calling Best Buy to pre-order my PlayStation 4.

1860
02:22:47,735 --> 02:22:49,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, just give me your credit card number.

1861
02:22:50,527 --> 02:22:51,568
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think so, Tim.

1862
02:22:52,808 --> 02:22:53,369
[SPEAKER_09]: What's up, buddy?

1863
02:22:54,289 --> 02:22:55,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Not too much, not too much.

1864
02:22:57,031 --> 02:23:01,874
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to say that I have to thank Sony.

1865
02:23:02,594 --> 02:23:08,038
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, their presser made me feel like what it was like to be an actual gamer.

1866
02:23:09,025 --> 02:23:10,205
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how it hit home for me.

1867
02:23:11,046 --> 02:23:14,386
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there was a very interesting comment left on the VOG Network.

1868
02:23:14,406 --> 02:23:21,628
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was Flaco Jones who said it on last week's show at vognetwork.com said that last week's show was kind of doom and gloom.

1869
02:23:21,648 --> 02:23:21,928
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1870
02:23:21,948 --> 02:23:23,129
[SPEAKER_06]: What was the macabre?

1871
02:23:23,369 --> 02:23:30,611
[SPEAKER_06]: He said this was very morbid kind of episode because, yeah, I mean, we were playing the funeral march to the Xbox stuff and all that.

1872
02:23:30,651 --> 02:23:34,432
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was sitting here going, this is a sad fucking day to be a gamer.

1873
02:23:34,772 --> 02:23:38,653
[SPEAKER_06]: But like at the Sony press conference when they hit bullet after bullet after bullet, it was like,

1874
02:23:39,333 --> 02:23:41,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Celebrate good times

1875
02:23:57,088 --> 02:23:58,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Very much so.

1876
02:23:58,408 --> 02:24:01,530
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I was so excited after seeing the Kingdom Hearts 3 trailer.

1877
02:24:02,050 --> 02:24:04,130
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm playing through Kingdom Hearts 1 right now.

1878
02:24:05,591 --> 02:24:09,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, are we being... Is the internet as a whole being too fanboy with this?

1879
02:24:09,932 --> 02:24:13,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, are we being too blinded by Sony's, you know...

1880
02:24:14,554 --> 02:24:15,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes and no.

1881
02:24:15,054 --> 02:24:17,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Coming from the cosplay fandom, anime fandom, I'll say this much.

1882
02:24:17,895 --> 02:24:18,495
[SPEAKER_06]: You take something away...

1883
02:24:42,031 --> 02:24:45,644
[SPEAKER_09]: fans will never forgive you no matter how well

1884
02:24:46,840 --> 02:24:48,001
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1885
02:25:14,143 --> 02:25:20,084
[SPEAKER_06]: I think just a more direct comparison would be Sony really fucked up in 2006 and now they're back, you know?

1886
02:25:20,605 --> 02:25:23,445
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, well, it's not even necessarily just now they're back.

1887
02:25:23,525 --> 02:25:27,486
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they slowly were getting their groove back, you know, over the past few years.

1888
02:25:27,546 --> 02:25:32,667
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think Microsoft made some really bad personnel decisions in the past few years and it's starting to show.

1889
02:25:32,827 --> 02:25:33,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry about it.

1890
02:25:34,328 --> 02:25:35,188
[SPEAKER_09]: And you're absolutely right.

1891
02:25:35,388 --> 02:25:38,269
[SPEAKER_09]: And I mean, I'm looking at the breakdown of the consoles.

1892
02:25:38,309 --> 02:25:38,569
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean...

1893
02:25:39,689 --> 02:25:43,812
[SPEAKER_09]: I read the article how the cost of the PS4 is about $325.

1894
02:25:44,673 --> 02:25:56,722
[SPEAKER_09]: If the PS4 and Xbox One are similar in hardware and if that's the case, then you're actually paying an extra $100 for Kinect, something that somebody may not even want.

1895
02:25:57,883 --> 02:26:03,507
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's one of Microsoft's huge mistakes is clinging to that Kinect.

1896
02:26:03,967 --> 02:26:08,250
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's one of the two big, big mistakes they made.

1897
02:26:08,690 --> 02:26:11,692
[SPEAKER_02]: And to point out, I've actually gone on record saying that I don't want to Kinect.

1898
02:26:12,352 --> 02:26:15,454
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I wanted to Kinect at first because I wanted to do Parapari games.

1899
02:26:16,495 --> 02:26:19,217
[SPEAKER_02]: But it doesn't really mean anything to me anymore.

1900
02:26:19,437 --> 02:26:19,797
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care.

1901
02:26:20,965 --> 02:26:21,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, what?

1902
02:26:45,987 --> 02:26:49,608
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I know you missed your Coke Black, but I'm going to try to ship this out to you.

1903
02:26:49,869 --> 02:26:52,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Here in New York, they have what's called Manhattan Special.

1904
02:26:53,030 --> 02:26:56,531
[SPEAKER_09]: It's cola and espresso as a soft drink.

1905
02:26:57,352 --> 02:26:58,372
[SPEAKER_14]: I need this in my life.

1906
02:26:58,932 --> 02:26:59,572
[SPEAKER_09]: So good.

1907
02:26:59,933 --> 02:27:00,893
[SPEAKER_02]: I need this in my life.

1908
02:27:01,073 --> 02:27:02,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranma, I'm going to let you go.

1909
02:27:02,073 --> 02:27:02,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care, buddy.

1910
02:27:02,594 --> 02:27:03,674
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, you too, bro.

1911
02:27:03,734 --> 02:27:06,335
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, bye.

1912
02:27:06,415 --> 02:27:06,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

1913
02:27:06,555 --> 02:27:07,256
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1914
02:27:07,336 --> 02:27:10,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Our user's name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, but let's go to the phones.

1915
02:27:10,657 --> 02:27:11,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1916
02:27:11,557 --> 02:27:11,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

1917
02:27:13,138 --> 02:27:13,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, it's Bobby.

1918
02:27:14,118 --> 02:27:14,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Bobby.

1919
02:27:14,759 --> 02:27:15,299
[SPEAKER_06]: How you doing?

1920
02:27:15,319 --> 02:27:15,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Bobby.

1921
02:27:17,080 --> 02:27:17,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Little shook up.

1922
02:27:18,101 --> 02:27:18,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah?

1923
02:27:18,561 --> 02:27:19,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, what happened?

1924
02:27:21,302 --> 02:27:25,964
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sitting there listening to OLR and I hear a huge, really loud clap over my head.

1925
02:27:27,825 --> 02:27:34,728
[SPEAKER_04]: And all my lights flicker and I'm like, okay, that was close.

1926
02:27:35,608 --> 02:27:39,570
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I notice that my brand new Netgear router is not on anymore.

1927
02:27:41,290 --> 02:27:45,472
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I look over to my right and my brand new Netgear 8 port switch is not on anymore.

1928
02:27:46,786 --> 02:27:50,887
[SPEAKER_04]: and then I go upstairs and my brand new Netgear A port switch that's upstairs is not on anymore.

1929
02:27:53,128 --> 02:28:01,671
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I start looking around and I try, you know, assume the worst and I try to turn on my TV and my receiver.

1930
02:28:01,711 --> 02:28:07,132
[SPEAKER_04]: The TV comes on but it's at the setup screen and my audio receiver doesn't come on at all.

1931
02:28:08,173 --> 02:28:10,293
[SPEAKER_04]: The red light on my Wii U is no longer on.

1932
02:28:11,574 --> 02:28:12,934
[SPEAKER_04]: The PS3's red light was on.

1933
02:28:14,134 --> 02:28:15,955
[SPEAKER_04]: The 360 didn't turn on when I pressed it.

1934
02:28:17,709 --> 02:28:26,212
[SPEAKER_04]: and I've come upstairs, my old 32-inch Trinitron TV for my retro games, that doesn't work anymore and the PS2 up here is dead.

1935
02:28:28,273 --> 02:28:33,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I guess the first question to ask, do you have homeowner's insurance or something that will hopefully replace some of this?

1936
02:28:35,333 --> 02:28:36,134
[SPEAKER_04]: I absolutely do.

1937
02:28:36,494 --> 02:28:39,558
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't pulled it out to see if it covers this, but I'm sure it does.

1938
02:28:39,838 --> 02:28:39,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1939
02:28:39,958 --> 02:28:40,058
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1940
02:28:54,073 --> 02:29:06,958
[SPEAKER_06]: And that just goes to show, Bobby, within literally two minutes of your tweet going up, everybody in the VOG Network chat room was like, let's take up a collection, let's donate, I've got an extra 360, I can send him if he needs it.

1941
02:29:08,378 --> 02:29:09,558
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it goes a long way.

1942
02:29:09,658 --> 02:29:19,822
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was mentioning to the live listeners, I know you didn't hear this because Lightning, it's one of the things you and I were talking about in the car when we were driving to Anaheim the other night was that

1943
02:29:20,762 --> 02:29:25,444
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we may not have the biggest audience here at the Voice of Geese Network, but we have the most loyal.

1944
02:29:25,604 --> 02:29:27,305
[SPEAKER_06]: And we are so fucking thankful for that.

1945
02:29:27,525 --> 02:29:28,225
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are amazing.

1946
02:29:28,325 --> 02:29:29,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1947
02:29:29,886 --> 02:29:31,307
[SPEAKER_04]: But my computers are fine.

1948
02:29:31,347 --> 02:29:32,027
[SPEAKER_04]: They stayed up.

1949
02:29:32,047 --> 02:29:33,227
[SPEAKER_04]: My two monitors stayed up.

1950
02:29:33,247 --> 02:29:34,988
[SPEAKER_04]: I even checked my old classic box.

1951
02:29:35,028 --> 02:29:35,968
[SPEAKER_04]: It came right back up.

1952
02:29:36,289 --> 02:29:40,110
[SPEAKER_06]: So it seems like it hits certain floors of your house more than others.

1953
02:29:40,250 --> 02:29:42,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's probably a circuit.

1954
02:29:43,151 --> 02:29:43,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1955
02:29:44,552 --> 02:29:45,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, I mean, it hit.

1956
02:29:45,552 --> 02:29:49,354
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, because the router, but my router is down next to my computer.

1957
02:29:50,623 --> 02:30:12,419
[SPEAKER_04]: and so it hits some things everything's on surge protectors but this was a you know they don't protect every surge and this one must have been pretty direct and um but yeah it kind of hit different things like my GameCube still works and it's sitting right next to my PS2 well but that TV doesn't work too well anymore so I think something inside the TV got fried

1958
02:30:13,584 --> 02:30:15,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Take some time to process.

1959
02:30:15,765 --> 02:30:17,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Call the insurance company on Monday.

1960
02:30:17,506 --> 02:30:19,447
[SPEAKER_06]: See what steps you have to take.

1961
02:30:20,168 --> 02:30:23,629
[SPEAKER_06]: And if there's anything you need, you know you've got the three of us.

1962
02:30:23,729 --> 02:30:27,271
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got 61 people in chat right now, and I know every single one of them is willing to help.

1963
02:30:27,732 --> 02:30:31,394
[SPEAKER_06]: And then add on to that the podcast listeners, the other folks at VOGnetwork.com.

1964
02:30:32,734 --> 02:30:33,535
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get you through this.

1965
02:30:34,835 --> 02:30:35,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1966
02:30:35,316 --> 02:30:35,976
[SPEAKER_04]: It just sucks.

1967
02:30:36,616 --> 02:30:36,996
[SPEAKER_06]: It sucks.

1968
02:30:37,257 --> 02:30:39,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I've spent a lot of money this past week.

1969
02:30:40,640 --> 02:30:41,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he did.

1970
02:30:42,142 --> 02:30:42,802
[SPEAKER_06]: He did, folks.

1971
02:30:42,862 --> 02:30:44,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Disneyland ain't cheap, you guys.

1972
02:30:44,784 --> 02:30:47,647
[SPEAKER_06]: But, most important, you're okay.

1973
02:30:47,967 --> 02:30:50,529
[SPEAKER_06]: The cats were still in kitty daycare due to your trip.

1974
02:30:50,569 --> 02:30:53,192
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't open again until Monday, so your cats are okay and you're okay.

1975
02:30:54,373 --> 02:30:54,533
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

1976
02:30:54,853 --> 02:30:55,494
[SPEAKER_06]: Most important.

1977
02:30:55,534 --> 02:30:56,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything else is just stuff.

1978
02:30:57,816 --> 02:30:59,858
[SPEAKER_14]: And weren't we saying that Nintendo don't last?

1979
02:31:00,118 --> 02:31:02,521
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't checked all my classic consoles yet, so...

1980
02:31:03,877 --> 02:31:05,938
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just stuff.

1981
02:31:06,338 --> 02:31:08,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm sure I've got spare Nintendos if you need one.

1982
02:31:08,880 --> 02:31:09,460
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I know.

1983
02:31:10,401 --> 02:31:12,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, everybody's here willing to help, Bobby.

1984
02:31:13,863 --> 02:31:15,984
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, anything else you want to say?

1985
02:31:16,064 --> 02:31:16,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Turning it over to you.

1986
02:31:17,905 --> 02:31:18,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Open forum for you.

1987
02:31:19,226 --> 02:31:20,427
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to rush you out of here.

1988
02:31:20,467 --> 02:31:21,788
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have anything else you want to say.

1989
02:31:23,008 --> 02:31:23,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really.

1990
02:31:24,608 --> 02:31:26,149
[SPEAKER_04]: I just figured I'd fill people in.

1991
02:31:26,509 --> 02:31:28,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody send me a chat log.

1992
02:31:28,530 --> 02:31:29,831
[SPEAKER_06]: We do appreciate the update.

1993
02:31:30,831 --> 02:31:34,453
[SPEAKER_06]: I think mine logs, but if not, I'm sure somebody in chat will have you covered.

1994
02:31:35,774 --> 02:31:36,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, cool.

1995
02:31:36,934 --> 02:31:37,174
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1996
02:31:37,795 --> 02:31:38,915
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1997
02:31:38,935 --> 02:31:40,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep us posted via Twitter.

1998
02:31:40,636 --> 02:31:50,001
[SPEAKER_06]: I know a lot of folks here at VOG Network follow you on Twitter, twitter.com slash bobbyblackwolf, and will be a great way to get the updates on how it goes with the insurance company and all that throughout the week.

1999
02:31:51,281 --> 02:31:51,562
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2000
02:31:52,062 --> 02:31:52,382
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2001
02:31:52,762 --> 02:31:53,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye, guys.

2002
02:31:53,262 --> 02:31:53,483
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2003
02:31:53,503 --> 02:31:53,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care, buddy.

2004
02:31:54,003 --> 02:31:54,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye.

2005
02:31:57,826 --> 02:31:59,208
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what else to tell him right now.

2006
02:31:59,768 --> 02:32:01,830
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been there.

2007
02:32:03,372 --> 02:32:14,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is actually kind of funny because that same storm that I fried my roommate's hard drive in, one of my friends lost their Genesis, but their Super Nintendo worked.

2008
02:32:16,487 --> 02:32:17,588
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were both on the same circuit.

2009
02:32:18,702 --> 02:32:25,185
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to need a dick or a fart joke, please, to help cheer us up a little bit here and lighten the mood a little bit.

2010
02:32:25,605 --> 02:32:26,446
[SPEAKER_06]: But let's try this call.

2011
02:32:26,486 --> 02:32:27,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2012
02:32:27,426 --> 02:32:27,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

2013
02:32:31,008 --> 02:32:32,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, this is Haseo Sumerugawa.

2014
02:32:33,649 --> 02:32:33,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

2015
02:32:34,009 --> 02:32:34,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

2016
02:32:34,549 --> 02:32:35,850
[SPEAKER_06]: You said Haseo Sumerugawa?

2017
02:32:36,490 --> 02:32:36,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

2018
02:32:36,930 --> 02:32:37,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, what's up?

2019
02:32:37,791 --> 02:32:39,492
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if I've heard you call in before.

2020
02:32:39,532 --> 02:32:40,152
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind, buddy?

2021
02:32:41,151 --> 02:32:43,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I've called him like two or three times.

2022
02:32:43,932 --> 02:32:44,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Rob.

2023
02:32:44,892 --> 02:32:45,513
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot.

2024
02:32:45,573 --> 02:32:50,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't remember a video call except I think I'm seeing a statue on your cam.

2025
02:32:50,995 --> 02:32:57,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I chose that statue for a reason because the VOG Network has earned good karma and had the hero shift to hero.

2026
02:33:01,596 --> 02:33:03,677
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the statue from Infamous 2.

2027
02:33:04,617 --> 02:33:05,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

2028
02:33:05,558 --> 02:33:07,278
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little dark in your room or something.

2029
02:33:07,318 --> 02:33:08,379
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little fuzzy coming through.

2030
02:33:08,399 --> 02:33:09,539
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hard to make out, but I get it.

2031
02:33:09,659 --> 02:33:10,139
[SPEAKER_06]: I get it now.

2032
02:33:10,819 --> 02:33:11,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Crappy PlayStation Lite.

2033
02:33:13,440 --> 02:33:14,021
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's up, buddy?

2034
02:33:15,201 --> 02:33:21,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I was going to talk about the whole virtual E3 booth that Sony was doing this week or whatever.

2035
02:33:22,044 --> 02:33:22,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, yeah.

2036
02:33:22,544 --> 02:33:24,825
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't have a chance to really check that out.

2037
02:33:24,845 --> 02:33:25,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell me about that.

2038
02:33:26,265 --> 02:33:28,446
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually pretty interesting because...

2039
02:33:29,096 --> 02:33:38,140
[SPEAKER_03]: They boothed pretty much everything major that's coming out, like Infamous Second Son, Assassin's Creed 4, all that stuff.

2040
02:33:38,380 --> 02:33:41,541
[SPEAKER_03]: And they had little quests and whatnot.

2041
02:33:42,121 --> 02:33:47,663
[SPEAKER_03]: You could earn a free month of Music Unlimited, PlayStation Plus, all those lovely things.

2042
02:33:49,744 --> 02:33:50,725
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty cool.

2043
02:33:50,745 --> 02:33:53,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I heard about the free month of PlayStation Plus on home.

2044
02:33:53,426 --> 02:33:54,106
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty awesome.

2045
02:33:55,512 --> 02:34:03,538
[SPEAKER_03]: The best thing actually about it was it told me about Tekken Revolution, even though Tekken Revolution kind of sucked.

2046
02:34:05,319 --> 02:34:08,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's one of those Facebook type-y games.

2047
02:34:08,921 --> 02:34:12,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, that free-to-play Tekken game we were talking about last week.

2048
02:34:12,104 --> 02:34:13,545
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot, yeah, it was supposed to come out.

2049
02:34:13,565 --> 02:34:14,065
[SPEAKER_06]: That's too bad.

2050
02:34:15,666 --> 02:34:23,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, my boyfriend was playing it because, you know, he wanted to play a new game and I said, well, why don't you try Tekken?

2051
02:34:23,391 --> 02:34:24,132
[SPEAKER_03]: He got, well,

2052
02:34:24,973 --> 02:34:29,777
[SPEAKER_03]: 4 or 5 fights into it and then it stopped so that's kind of sad

2053
02:34:42,348 --> 02:34:44,651
[SPEAKER_06]: That's unfortunate.

2054
02:34:45,652 --> 02:34:53,361
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm assuming if you actually do all the stuff in PlayStation Home and all that, you've been a little bit of a Sony fanboy.

2055
02:34:54,402 --> 02:34:57,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Or I shouldn't say the word fanboy because that has a negative connotation.

2056
02:34:57,265 --> 02:34:59,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, Sony fanboy is on my senior shirt.

2057
02:34:59,688 --> 02:35:07,071
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually feel really good because mostly Sony got the rights to, you know, air Final Fantasy XIV, XV, which is actually Versus XIII.

2058
02:35:07,091 --> 02:35:07,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2059
02:35:29,068 --> 02:35:43,642
[SPEAKER_03]: and pretty much all the good stuff Square Enix is putting out and the last 25 minutes was pretty much Sony saying suck it Microsoft yeah it was pretty interesting so no hope on you getting an Xbox One

2060
02:35:44,836 --> 02:35:45,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely not.

2061
02:35:46,337 --> 02:35:49,638
[SPEAKER_03]: I have internet troubles and I do not.

2062
02:35:50,199 --> 02:35:57,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, okay, since you said you're a Sony fanboy, I said earlier in the show, you know, I think Xbox's exclusives actually look a little better.

2063
02:35:57,822 --> 02:36:03,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though I ended up ordering a PlayStation 4 because the overall picture I think is better for PlayStation 4.

2064
02:36:03,805 --> 02:36:07,287
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll get the Xbox One later when they sort out all their bullshit.

2065
02:36:07,727 --> 02:36:08,408
[SPEAKER_06]: But I...

2066
02:36:11,488 --> 02:36:14,769
[SPEAKER_06]: What I want to ask you is explain to me why I'm wrong.

2067
02:36:17,409 --> 02:36:36,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I haven't really seen any exclusives for Xbox One that really kind of I'd say jump out at me as far as that goes, but I mean, the exclusives for PlayStation 4 are superior in a sense.

2068
02:36:38,415 --> 02:36:39,395
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, you got

2069
02:36:41,387 --> 02:36:44,929
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't really think of any right now.

2070
02:36:45,570 --> 02:36:47,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm not really convinced right now.

2071
02:36:48,111 --> 02:36:49,993
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just giving you a hard time.

2072
02:36:50,273 --> 02:36:51,333
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm putting you on the spot.

2073
02:36:51,393 --> 02:36:51,954
[SPEAKER_06]: It ain't easy.

2074
02:36:51,994 --> 02:36:52,494
[SPEAKER_06]: It ain't easy.

2075
02:36:54,235 --> 02:36:58,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Assuming you're buying a PlayStation 4 on day one, what are you most looking forward to?

2076
02:36:58,698 --> 02:36:59,899
[SPEAKER_06]: The Square Enix games?

2077
02:37:01,239 --> 02:37:09,825
[SPEAKER_03]: The Square Enix games and Infamous Second Son because, spoiler alert, the end of the second one is kind of

2078
02:37:10,675 --> 02:37:14,577
[SPEAKER_03]: states why there's a whole new character and storyline and all that.

2079
02:37:15,298 --> 02:37:15,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Fair enough.

2080
02:37:16,338 --> 02:37:19,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, anything else you want to get off your chest before we let you go?

2081
02:37:21,281 --> 02:37:22,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Mirror's Edge 2 looks pretty.

2082
02:37:23,062 --> 02:37:24,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Mirror's Edge 2 does look pretty.

2083
02:37:24,403 --> 02:37:25,423
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we can agree on that.

2084
02:37:25,784 --> 02:37:26,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, thanks so much for the call, buddy.

2085
02:37:27,905 --> 02:37:28,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely no problem.

2086
02:37:28,605 --> 02:37:29,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, take care.

2087
02:37:29,546 --> 02:37:29,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one.

2088
02:37:31,724 --> 02:37:34,887
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2089
02:37:35,488 --> 02:37:35,928
[SPEAKER_06]: What the heck?

2090
02:37:35,948 --> 02:37:37,170
[SPEAKER_06]: We're getting call after call tonight.

2091
02:37:37,190 --> 02:37:38,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of people want to comment on E3.

2092
02:37:38,311 --> 02:37:39,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2093
02:37:39,512 --> 02:37:39,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

2094
02:37:42,535 --> 02:37:43,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, this is Actdeft.

2095
02:37:43,616 --> 02:37:44,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Actdeft.

2096
02:37:44,217 --> 02:37:44,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Actdeft.

2097
02:37:44,917 --> 02:37:45,458
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you doing?

2098
02:37:46,659 --> 02:37:47,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty good.

2099
02:37:47,480 --> 02:37:48,061
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind, buddy?

2100
02:37:49,059 --> 02:38:13,679
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, something that not many people are talking about Sony and Microsoft, that they're both doing, and that's pretty great in my opinion, is that you only need to buy one subscription to PlayStation Plus and to Xbox One to everyone in the console or in your house to enjoy it.

2101
02:38:15,941 --> 02:38:31,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, so meaning that like if one, you just have to have the one account and then you can have all the TVs in your house because I'm assuming they would all go back to the same IP at the end of the day, can all kind of use that central account to do Netflix and all that.

2102
02:38:32,321 --> 02:38:41,289
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's something that I find pretty useful because in my household, me and my brother do have each one an Xbox.

2103
02:38:42,130 --> 02:38:47,354
[SPEAKER_12]: So we do have like... I am the only one that has a gold account.

2104
02:38:47,935 --> 02:38:54,661
[SPEAKER_12]: So in the future, if we decide either to get a PS4 or an Xbox One, in this case...

2105
02:38:56,722 --> 02:39:02,583
[SPEAKER_12]: It's pretty good that we only need to buy one subscription to enjoy the gold or plus benefits.

2106
02:39:02,883 --> 02:39:04,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki's wearing a question mark on his face right now.

2107
02:39:04,524 --> 02:39:07,904
[SPEAKER_10]: I wasn't sure if it's just going to be on the console or not.

2108
02:39:07,924 --> 02:39:15,986
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I know if I have live gold on one of my accounts, like an account on my 360, I can play multiplayer on that.

2109
02:39:16,046 --> 02:39:19,127
[SPEAKER_10]: But if I have a second account that's not live gold...

2110
02:39:21,127 --> 02:39:21,647
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2111
02:39:41,357 --> 02:39:42,438
[SPEAKER_10]: It's also tied to that console.

2112
02:39:42,458 --> 02:39:53,302
[SPEAKER_10]: Same with how the PlayStation 3, well, PlayStation 3 was free online, but pretty much you can have as many of PlayStation Network accounts as you wanted, but I think they would kind of do it in a similar way.

2113
02:39:53,402 --> 02:40:08,308
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure if, I mean, I could be wrong because I haven't really read the details on it yet, but I don't think that they're having it where, like, I buy Xbox Live Gold or whatever and, you know, a sibling of mine has a separate console we can both play on live at the same time.

2114
02:40:08,328 --> 02:40:09,529
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think it works that way.

2115
02:40:10,070 --> 02:40:15,726
[SPEAKER_10]: because otherwise, you know, what's to say if they're doing that 10 friend thing or whatever that I buy gold and then everybody else plays for free?

2116
02:40:15,746 --> 02:40:17,832
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I just don't think they're going to do that.

2117
02:40:19,130 --> 02:40:30,632
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I do think it's also just one console, but it's still pretty good because even right now you have to buy a subscription for each account you have.

2118
02:40:31,512 --> 02:40:47,115
[SPEAKER_12]: So with that, even if you cannot share it with another console, even in the same household, having just buying one subscription instead of two or even three in some cases, it's pretty good.

2119
02:40:47,912 --> 02:40:48,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get started.

2120
02:41:15,769 --> 02:41:19,410
[SPEAKER_06]: How do these systems look from your perspective in Mexico?

2121
02:41:19,530 --> 02:41:21,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Is Xbox One launching in Mexico?

2122
02:41:22,611 --> 02:41:25,871
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, the Xbox One is launching in Mexico.

2123
02:41:26,191 --> 02:41:32,392
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't know if it's launching in November, but it has a retail price.

2124
02:41:32,533 --> 02:41:37,674
[SPEAKER_12]: They're already launching pre-orders, and it's around $8,500, which is around $600 or $700, I think.

2125
02:41:37,694 --> 02:41:39,374
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, and how's PlayStation 4 look?

2126
02:41:45,889 --> 02:42:03,276
[SPEAKER_12]: and PlayStation 4 also it seems that they're launching in November I'm not sure at all but it looks like it though it's launching for 1000 pesos less which is 7500 pesos and dollars would be I think 500 around 550 and 600 dollars

2127
02:42:10,299 --> 02:42:18,442
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're paying a premium similar to what our friends across the Atlantic pay, because in the European territories it's a little bit higher as well.

2128
02:42:21,943 --> 02:42:27,765
[SPEAKER_06]: You've mentioned you've crossed into America before to sometimes buy things at a cheaper price with this stuff.

2129
02:42:27,805 --> 02:42:29,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this something you're thinking about doing with the consoles?

2130
02:42:30,526 --> 02:42:32,487
[SPEAKER_06]: No, because you want to be able to play the download stuff?

2131
02:42:32,507 --> 02:42:32,607
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

2132
02:42:34,150 --> 02:42:50,282
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe I will because at least Microsoft, something that has done in the past, even with the 360, is that it has most of the digital content on par with the US.

2133
02:42:50,943 --> 02:42:51,823
[SPEAKER_12]: At least most of it.

2134
02:42:52,524 --> 02:43:02,251
[SPEAKER_12]: Though the Xbox One doesn't look as appealing as the PS4 right now because the Xbox TV stuff won't work here.

2135
02:43:02,811 --> 02:43:03,031
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

2136
02:43:03,232 --> 02:43:08,218
[SPEAKER_12]: At least not at launch, and I don't think it will work even in the first year.

2137
02:43:08,278 --> 02:43:13,245
[SPEAKER_12]: So that is a feature that won't be used here.

2138
02:43:13,325 --> 02:43:18,772
[SPEAKER_12]: And so the console will probably mostly be used as a gaming console.

2139
02:43:19,213 --> 02:43:20,434
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's way too expensive.

2140
02:43:21,335 --> 02:43:24,699
[SPEAKER_12]: Though, on the other hand, a Wii U costs the same.

2141
02:43:25,180 --> 02:43:29,305
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're going to live in Mexico, you've got to be able to watch the telenovelas.

2142
02:43:29,726 --> 02:43:32,629
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that, those are the bomb.

2143
02:43:32,990 --> 02:43:34,171
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all about Lucha Libre.

2144
02:43:34,191 --> 02:43:37,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Forget the drama, I like watching the wrestlers.

2145
02:43:37,796 --> 02:43:39,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it used to be all about Sabado...

2146
02:43:40,479 --> 02:43:44,780
[SPEAKER_06]: and Sábado Gigante but that's gone now if I am not mistaken.

2147
02:43:44,840 --> 02:43:46,080
[SPEAKER_06]: They finally pulled that.

2148
02:43:46,780 --> 02:43:48,721
[SPEAKER_06]: So telenovelas.

2149
02:43:48,761 --> 02:43:51,261
[SPEAKER_06]: They show some of them here and they're great.

2150
02:43:52,522 --> 02:43:53,542
[SPEAKER_02]: I like watching the wrestlers.

2151
02:43:53,662 --> 02:43:54,962
[SPEAKER_02]: They are absolutely fun.

2152
02:43:55,042 --> 02:43:58,723
[SPEAKER_12]: I despise telenovelas so no comments.

2153
02:43:59,183 --> 02:43:59,443
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2154
02:44:00,203 --> 02:44:01,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, thank you so much for the perspective.

2155
02:44:01,884 --> 02:44:02,564
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate it.

2156
02:44:02,664 --> 02:44:03,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one, okay?

2157
02:44:04,164 --> 02:44:04,444
[SPEAKER_12]: You too.

2158
02:44:04,504 --> 02:44:05,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for having me.

2159
02:44:05,245 --> 02:44:05,585
[SPEAKER_06]: No problem.

2160
02:44:05,605 --> 02:44:05,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Anytime.

2161
02:44:06,045 --> 02:44:06,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

2162
02:44:07,005 --> 02:44:07,245
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR

2163
02:44:24,062 --> 02:44:24,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, this is Techie.

2164
02:44:24,642 --> 02:44:25,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, what's up?

2165
02:44:25,062 --> 02:44:25,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, not much.

2166
02:44:25,563 --> 02:44:26,323
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to say to you

2167
02:44:51,421 --> 02:44:54,043
[SPEAKER_11]: Say one thing and ask a question for DarkSakura.

2168
02:44:54,344 --> 02:44:54,424
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh.

2169
02:44:54,704 --> 02:44:56,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2170
02:44:56,345 --> 02:44:58,547
[SPEAKER_11]: Sony 1E3 and that's it for me.

2171
02:45:01,730 --> 02:45:02,991
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it, huh?

2172
02:45:03,071 --> 02:45:05,493
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nothing, no convincing you otherwise.

2173
02:45:05,513 --> 02:45:06,533
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony 1E3, huh?

2174
02:45:07,314 --> 02:45:13,199
[SPEAKER_11]: Like the way that Microsoft handled their DRM, they treat you like you're a criminal and that's, no.

2175
02:45:14,160 --> 02:45:14,800
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no way.

2176
02:45:15,461 --> 02:45:16,882
[SPEAKER_02]: They're alienating their audience.

2177
02:45:19,209 --> 02:45:22,871
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your question for DarkSakura and then I'm going to throw you a curveball.

2178
02:45:24,111 --> 02:45:30,933
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw the trailer for... He likes the trailer for... You just cut out.

2179
02:45:31,774 --> 02:45:32,934
[SPEAKER_06]: The Joys of Live Radio.

2180
02:45:34,595 --> 02:45:41,117
[SPEAKER_11]: I saw the trailer for Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn on the PS3.

2181
02:45:41,457 --> 02:45:44,478
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the gameplay like since you're in the closed beta?

2182
02:45:45,655 --> 02:45:50,661
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not playing it on PS3, I'm playing it on PC, and it's pretty much standard, you know, Momo fare.

2183
02:45:51,482 --> 02:45:59,651
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, uh, you know, what I like about the combat in the game is that you don't have to stop to loot, it will automatically auto-loot.

2184
02:46:00,632 --> 02:46:01,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you...

2185
02:46:01,793 --> 02:46:15,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually get to choose... Well, they've sort of incorporated this in Mists of Pandaria lately, is actually getting items from doing quests that are for your class specifically, as opposed to getting just everybody's stuff.

2186
02:46:17,310 --> 02:46:17,811
[SPEAKER_02]: I like...

2187
02:46:20,293 --> 02:46:21,834
[SPEAKER_02]: The server that we're on is pretty crowded.

2188
02:46:21,854 --> 02:46:23,014
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go ahead and say that right now.

2189
02:46:23,034 --> 02:46:23,995
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like that so much.

2190
02:46:26,976 --> 02:46:27,776
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really fun.

2191
02:46:27,796 --> 02:46:28,996
[SPEAKER_02]: The game is smooth.

2192
02:46:29,316 --> 02:46:34,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you have a little bit of slowdown, it's not like a really horrible lag.

2193
02:46:34,238 --> 02:46:36,899
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't find yourself being stuck anywhere, if that makes sense.

2194
02:46:38,540 --> 02:46:41,061
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole fate system, I enjoy that.

2195
02:46:41,101 --> 02:46:43,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you have these big group battles that give you extra experience.

2196
02:46:45,263 --> 02:46:47,825
[SPEAKER_02]: There's really just a lot of positive to be said about it.

2197
02:46:47,845 --> 02:46:58,394
[SPEAKER_02]: And on top of that, it looks like, you know, whereas even with the current graphical updates on World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy XIV looks like a new game.

2198
02:47:00,475 --> 02:47:03,318
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks and plays like a new game.

2199
02:47:03,338 --> 02:47:08,202
[SPEAKER_11]: The gameplay from it looks like, kind of looks like a, on par with Guild Wars 2 graphically.

2200
02:47:08,715 --> 02:47:11,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it still like a grind fest like it is in Eleven in the beginning?

2201
02:47:11,257 --> 02:47:11,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2202
02:47:31,622 --> 02:47:32,203
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm enjoying it.

2203
02:47:32,463 --> 02:47:33,223
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm enjoying it a lot.

2204
02:47:34,643 --> 02:47:43,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I hate being under NDA for saying stuff about the last beta, but the improvements that they're making are noticeable and very good.

2205
02:47:44,147 --> 02:47:46,128
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a really rich game when it boots.

2206
02:47:47,148 --> 02:47:50,809
[SPEAKER_11]: I might try it out on my first MMO on the PS3.

2207
02:47:51,649 --> 02:48:00,672
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't speak for how it plays on the PS3 because I play on a PC just because of the problems with my hands, but I enjoy it.

2208
02:48:01,613 --> 02:48:02,433
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I can say.

2209
02:48:02,513 --> 02:48:02,973
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.

2210
02:48:04,234 --> 02:48:05,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Shane would vouch for it.

2211
02:48:06,254 --> 02:48:06,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, he will.

2212
02:48:07,115 --> 02:48:11,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Shane would probably jump up and down on a trampoline saying how much he likes it, but you know.

2213
02:48:11,690 --> 02:48:15,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, here's the curveball I wanted to throw at you before you guys got on Final Fantasy XIV.

2214
02:48:15,872 --> 02:48:24,157
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, this is important because this is for a lot of people because everybody's turned E3 into Sony vs. Microsoft, Sony vs. Microsoft, da-da-da-da-da.

2215
02:48:24,197 --> 02:48:25,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's Nintendo sit with you?

2216
02:48:25,777 --> 02:48:26,698
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my curveball.

2217
02:48:26,918 --> 02:48:28,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's Nintendo sit right now?

2218
02:48:28,259 --> 02:48:29,199
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

2219
02:48:29,219 --> 02:48:30,060
[SPEAKER_11]: Funny you should ask that.

2220
02:48:30,240 --> 02:48:36,103
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually watched the Nintendo Direct the day of on that day that they streamed it.

2221
02:48:37,664 --> 02:48:40,045
[SPEAKER_11]: And what my general...

2222
02:48:41,131 --> 02:48:43,919
[SPEAKER_11]: A feeling for that is, 2014 is the year that we, for me,

2223
02:48:47,685 --> 02:48:54,890
[SPEAKER_06]: So in other words, it's kind of one of my earlier tweets I'd put out there was like, boy, Nintendo's sure setting up a great season for 2014.

2224
02:48:55,250 --> 02:48:56,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Too bad about this year.

2225
02:48:57,051 --> 02:49:01,334
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's like there's nothing really that catches my eye this year at all.

2226
02:49:01,554 --> 02:49:02,535
[SPEAKER_11]: There's the Mario game.

2227
02:49:02,655 --> 02:49:04,576
[SPEAKER_06]: The Mario 3D game looks great.

2228
02:49:04,836 --> 02:49:09,019
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, the Donkey Kong game, again, Donkey Kong's a solid platformer.

2229
02:49:09,059 --> 02:49:11,741
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think that's the problem.

2230
02:49:11,761 --> 02:49:14,583
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got two platformers with Mario and Donkey Kong.

2231
02:49:15,043 --> 02:49:20,005
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of wish they'd gone a different direction, but they could have done a lot worse.

2232
02:49:22,627 --> 02:49:25,628
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess there's nothing hardcore for me to play.

2233
02:49:25,668 --> 02:49:27,069
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I like playing.

2234
02:49:28,650 --> 02:49:30,891
[SPEAKER_11]: Platform Wars are part of the games.

2235
02:49:31,671 --> 02:49:32,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, buddy.

2236
02:49:32,051 --> 02:49:33,772
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show.

2237
02:49:33,812 --> 02:49:34,773
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any other final thoughts?

2238
02:49:36,491 --> 02:49:37,111
[SPEAKER_11]: No, that's it.

2239
02:49:37,871 --> 02:49:38,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

2240
02:49:38,212 --> 02:49:38,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one.

2241
02:49:39,232 --> 02:49:39,572
[SPEAKER_06]: You too.

2242
02:49:39,992 --> 02:49:40,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye.

2243
02:50:00,316 --> 02:50:07,724
[SPEAKER_06]: They have some new co-hosts, but maybe they just stopped carrying it here locally or something.

2244
02:50:07,784 --> 02:50:08,725
[SPEAKER_06]: But that would seem weird.

2245
02:50:08,765 --> 02:50:12,348
[SPEAKER_06]: I would think a show that's as old as that, it wouldn't stop.

2246
02:50:13,389 --> 02:50:15,632
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I'm just not watching enough Mexican TV.

2247
02:50:15,732 --> 02:50:18,455
[SPEAKER_06]: But for what it's worth, I don't watch enough American TV either.

2248
02:50:18,575 --> 02:50:20,517
[SPEAKER_06]: So at least that's equal.

2249
02:50:21,017 --> 02:50:22,799
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, there's your very important update.

2250
02:50:22,819 --> 02:50:23,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you to the chatters.

2251
02:50:23,960 --> 02:50:26,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, that's it for the Sky Blind tonight.

2252
02:50:26,882 --> 02:50:29,904
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta get to some of these tweets we were getting because we were getting some good tweets.

2253
02:50:31,265 --> 02:50:34,487
[SPEAKER_06]: And Loki, I always like to put a call out for last minute stories if you have anything.

2254
02:50:35,928 --> 02:50:37,169
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, real quick.

2255
02:50:38,750 --> 02:50:42,652
[SPEAKER_10]: I was gonna mention that, well, it's kind of funny.

2256
02:50:43,773 --> 02:50:49,397
[SPEAKER_10]: We talk about porn a lot on this show and one of the things that they're looking to bring to the Oculus Rift is

2257
02:50:50,765 --> 02:50:52,847
[SPEAKER_10]: Horn.

2258
02:50:53,687 --> 02:50:58,751
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's actually being done by this startup studio.

2259
02:50:59,192 --> 02:51:01,073
[SPEAKER_10]: The game's called Wicked Paradise.

2260
02:51:02,114 --> 02:51:10,500
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're getting funding for it right now, but they're trying to make, I guess, a game that will get people horny.

2261
02:51:11,421 --> 02:51:12,342
[SPEAKER_10]: Genuinely horny.

2262
02:51:14,083 --> 02:51:14,444
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

2263
02:51:15,404 --> 02:51:17,566
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so they've got information on that.

2264
02:51:18,206 --> 02:51:19,708
[SPEAKER_10]: So I thought that was kind of funny.

2265
02:51:22,458 --> 02:51:31,912
[SPEAKER_10]: I forgot to mention in the releases this week, a new Luigi U is going to be on the eShop this week.

2266
02:51:32,052 --> 02:51:35,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, when I heard about that, I was like, oh yeah, that is like real soon.

2267
02:51:38,108 --> 02:51:38,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty neat.

2268
02:51:39,148 --> 02:51:40,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me get to some of the tweets here real quick.

2269
02:51:41,969 --> 02:51:47,370
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100Matt tweeted us about comedian Louis Black talking about Xbox One and Google Glass on the Daily Show.

2270
02:51:47,970 --> 02:51:49,491
[SPEAKER_06]: I have seen that YouTube floating around.

2271
02:51:49,791 --> 02:51:51,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I was out of town, I haven't watched it yet.

2272
02:51:52,771 --> 02:51:56,132
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, some folks saying it should be maybe a fortune cookie in a future week.

2273
02:51:56,632 --> 02:51:58,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I know you do like Louis Black, so check that out.

2274
02:51:59,093 --> 02:52:00,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I love Louis Black.

2275
02:52:00,393 --> 02:52:01,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at the tweets there.

2276
02:52:02,013 --> 02:52:13,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, let's see, we got a tweet here from Ionotropic, who, uh, notices that Storm is heading his way, the one that got Bobby, so, uh, stay safe, um, um, unplug stuff, if you want.

2277
02:52:14,136 --> 02:52:19,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, let's see, Dartetsuya says, uh, Bomani may be dead in the States, but it lives on in Japan.

2278
02:52:20,197 --> 02:52:21,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Beatmania2DX21's Spada says,

2279
02:52:23,218 --> 02:52:24,559
[SPEAKER_06]: is on location test.

2280
02:52:24,599 --> 02:52:25,879
[SPEAKER_06]: And they said they weren't doing any more.

2281
02:52:26,139 --> 02:52:30,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Please tell me that somebody is saying, this is Spada.

2282
02:52:31,681 --> 02:52:32,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Please tell me that's a joke.

2283
02:52:33,422 --> 02:52:33,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody?

2284
02:52:34,602 --> 02:52:34,843
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2285
02:52:35,443 --> 02:52:35,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Fair enough.

2286
02:52:36,563 --> 02:52:37,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

2287
02:52:37,384 --> 02:52:40,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft tweeting us that Pac-Man CEDX is coming to Steam.

2288
02:52:41,865 --> 02:52:42,566
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not know.

2289
02:52:42,626 --> 02:52:43,246
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of cool.

2290
02:52:43,266 --> 02:52:44,786
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that would be a fun game to play on PC.

2291
02:52:45,827 --> 02:52:46,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that part of that PC?

2292
02:52:47,007 --> 02:52:48,188
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I guess it's a separate thing.

2293
02:52:49,388 --> 02:52:54,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, Tigerclaw tweeting us, Sega launching a new Sonic the Hedgehog series titled Sonic Boom.

2294
02:52:55,290 --> 02:52:58,652
[SPEAKER_06]: It's by the creators of My Little Pony Friendship is Magic.

2295
02:52:58,872 --> 02:52:59,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God.

2296
02:53:00,452 --> 02:53:01,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, man.

2297
02:53:01,093 --> 02:53:01,953
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't care anymore.

2298
02:53:02,053 --> 02:53:03,433
[SPEAKER_06]: That's some fandom stuff.

2299
02:53:03,453 --> 02:53:04,594
[SPEAKER_06]: You gotta give it at least a chance.

2300
02:53:04,614 --> 02:53:06,695
[SPEAKER_06]: You gotta try at least one episode, DarkSakura.

2301
02:53:07,175 --> 02:53:08,435
[SPEAKER_06]: You gotta try it before you know it.

2302
02:53:08,475 --> 02:53:08,595
[SPEAKER_02]: I did.

2303
02:53:08,635 --> 02:53:09,336
[SPEAKER_02]: It was stupid.

2304
02:53:09,396 --> 02:53:10,876
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm not talking about My Little Pony.

2305
02:53:10,916 --> 02:53:12,197
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm talking about Sonic Boom.

2306
02:53:12,457 --> 02:53:12,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, maybe.

2307
02:53:15,145 --> 02:53:16,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we sure that's legit?

2308
02:53:16,506 --> 02:53:17,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we sure that's legit?

2309
02:53:17,266 --> 02:53:18,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that does sound a little bit fan wanky.

2310
02:53:19,027 --> 02:53:19,587
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying.

2311
02:53:20,107 --> 02:53:20,607
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying.

2312
02:53:20,687 --> 02:53:22,308
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2313
02:53:23,929 --> 02:53:29,631
[SPEAKER_06]: And lastly, Rama tweeting us a story about a Tekken producer, Katsuhiro Harada, missing.

2314
02:53:30,391 --> 02:53:36,398
[SPEAKER_06]: But actually, I think this was on our show roll last week, but got bumped because of all the Microsoft news that was happening.

2315
02:53:36,778 --> 02:53:42,945
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say there was a late-breaking update that he kind of just ran away for a little bit, but he's fine.

2316
02:53:43,065 --> 02:53:43,465
[SPEAKER_06]: He's safe.

2317
02:53:43,605 --> 02:53:43,966
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't worry.

2318
02:53:44,246 --> 02:53:45,127
[SPEAKER_06]: He's okay.

2319
02:53:45,147 --> 02:53:45,888
[SPEAKER_06]: What about the other dude?

2320
02:53:47,149 --> 02:53:47,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Which one?

2321
02:53:47,850 --> 02:53:48,951
[SPEAKER_06]: The guy that was...

2322
02:53:53,113 --> 02:53:54,373
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't heard an update on him.

2323
02:53:54,533 --> 02:53:55,154
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think.

2324
02:53:55,394 --> 02:53:56,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for asking.

2325
02:53:59,495 --> 02:54:00,195
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to look.

2326
02:54:00,435 --> 02:54:02,956
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

2327
02:54:04,096 --> 02:54:04,596
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't heard.

2328
02:54:04,616 --> 02:54:07,357
[SPEAKER_06]: That's too bad.

2329
02:54:10,418 --> 02:54:17,140
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually trying to find real quick where that Facebook is that might have an update.

2330
02:54:18,724 --> 02:54:21,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Live radio guys, while I try to find this.

2331
02:54:24,309 --> 02:54:25,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Trying to see if there's anything.

2332
02:54:25,229 --> 02:54:26,691
[SPEAKER_14]: We're talking about Mexican wrestling now.

2333
02:54:27,591 --> 02:54:27,731
[SPEAKER_14]: Really?

2334
02:54:27,751 --> 02:54:28,352
[SPEAKER_14]: What the hell?

2335
02:54:29,052 --> 02:54:29,413
[SPEAKER_06]: There it is.

2336
02:54:33,185 --> 02:54:45,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, unfortunately I'm looking at, and the website is, if you want more information on this, findknuckles.com and, uh, they say that they're still out searching as often as they can when weather permits over the past week.

2337
02:54:46,313 --> 02:54:47,774
[SPEAKER_06]: They went out to Bowen Island.

2338
02:54:47,814 --> 02:54:50,036
[SPEAKER_06]: These are some places around Vancouver and so forth.

2339
02:54:50,076 --> 02:54:52,557
[SPEAKER_06]: So unfortunately it sounds like he's still missing.

2340
02:54:52,617 --> 02:54:55,639
[SPEAKER_06]: So guys, um, especially if you're in the Pacific Northwest, uh,

2341
02:54:55,979 --> 02:55:18,790
[SPEAKER_06]: and that goes double if you're in the Vancouver area please check out findknuckles.com it's going to redirect you to a Facebook page but I'm just trying to get the latest on that so boy oh boy all right let me see if I have any other tweet stories here I don't think so

2342
02:55:20,965 --> 02:55:27,071
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm getting told to take Sonic Boom with a grain of salt.

2343
02:55:28,332 --> 02:55:30,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Stay tuned for Anime Jam Session for all the latest on that.

2344
02:55:30,974 --> 02:55:33,056
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll tell you what is going on there.

2345
02:55:34,177 --> 02:55:35,759
[SPEAKER_14]: People are welcome to like what they like.

2346
02:55:36,259 --> 02:55:36,680
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

2347
02:55:37,668 --> 02:55:38,529
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have to like it.

2348
02:55:39,891 --> 02:55:41,113
[SPEAKER_06]: I got sent this story here.

2349
02:55:41,574 --> 02:55:45,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Microsoft looking into playing games offline on Xbox One.

2350
02:55:46,221 --> 02:55:47,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sure they are.

2351
02:55:47,883 --> 02:55:53,452
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the one that, if I remember correctly, this is the one that's from the NeoGAF thing where someone had proposed

2352
02:55:53,672 --> 02:56:00,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, you can have it so that it's optional so that, you know... Oh, the Major Nelson thing where he tweeted or whatever saying, yes, we could do that.

2353
02:56:01,539 --> 02:56:02,139
[SPEAKER_10]: It's possible.

2354
02:56:02,219 --> 02:56:03,521
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's what this is.

2355
02:56:03,741 --> 02:56:06,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing with this story.

2356
02:56:06,183 --> 02:56:08,445
[SPEAKER_06]: There's going to be a lot of discussions after E3.

2357
02:56:08,565 --> 02:56:09,686
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Microsoft...

2358
02:56:11,536 --> 02:56:12,257
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.

2359
02:56:34,938 --> 02:56:54,355
[SPEAKER_06]: that's the huge difference you heard in their press conferences was that you know when Jack Trenton was there stabbing Microsoft in the jugular he said we know that gamers like it just the way they are when you hear what Microsoft is saying no gamers want something different so in their mind whether they're right or wrong they're doing the right thing here um

2360
02:56:55,797 --> 02:57:23,312
[SPEAKER_06]: so a lot can change I kind of think it's too late to reverse course and backpedal for this holiday season and I think they're going to pay for it but you never know a lot can happen we'll see what happens but I think it goes without saying anything is possible but don't expect anything next week because there's going to be a lot of board meetings and a lot of conferences that happen and a lot of consulting that happens over the next and focus groups I would say you're not going to hear anything for about three months

2361
02:57:24,252 --> 02:57:27,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Although they need to get something out a lot sooner if they want to get more pre-orders for the holiday season.

2362
02:57:27,934 --> 02:57:33,577
[SPEAKER_06]: But technically, they could do it right up until the day it's out and still sell a lot of them.

2363
02:57:34,638 --> 02:57:34,998
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

2364
02:57:35,958 --> 02:57:36,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything's possible.

2365
02:57:37,359 --> 02:57:37,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2366
02:57:41,721 --> 02:57:45,203
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just looking at stuff in the chat at live.vognetwork.com.

2367
02:57:45,223 --> 02:57:46,704
[SPEAKER_02]: The chat room is all over the place.

2368
02:57:46,744 --> 02:57:47,984
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, all over the place.

2369
02:57:48,745 --> 02:57:50,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Akuma JP says, an Apple-like device.

2370
02:57:51,126 --> 02:57:53,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Xbox One looks like my grandpa's VCR.

2371
02:57:54,335 --> 02:57:55,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Betamax!

2372
02:57:55,676 --> 02:57:59,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Shadow Next Gen says Microsoft could do something at PAX Prime since it's in their backyard.

2373
02:57:59,817 --> 02:58:03,659
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Bobby and I were talking about that a little bit in the car, or at Disneyland, one of the two.

2374
02:58:03,679 --> 02:58:05,640
[SPEAKER_06]: We had some time together talking about all this stuff.

2375
02:58:06,080 --> 02:58:09,641
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, actually that was brought up that...

2376
02:58:11,562 --> 02:58:18,649
[SPEAKER_06]: PAX Prime would be a very good place to make your case directly to the gamers that you seem to have ruffled feathers with.

2377
02:58:19,109 --> 02:58:20,931
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be a very interesting PAX Prime.

2378
02:58:21,532 --> 02:58:23,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Too bad we're all going to DragonCon.

2379
02:58:23,854 --> 02:58:31,722
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be following everything on Twitter and news and all that stuff as it goes on.

2380
02:58:32,242 --> 02:58:50,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, that's it We're about to the end of the show It's been a very, very busy night tonight So I think it's about time we wrap up and take it back to the other shows here at the Voice Geeks Network and our big 11th birthday show next week Any other last minute stories before we get to that?

2381
02:58:51,680 --> 02:58:51,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope

2382
02:58:53,021 --> 02:58:54,022
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright.

2383
02:58:54,302 --> 02:58:55,143
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a small thing.

2384
02:58:56,203 --> 02:59:06,409
[SPEAKER_10]: There's some people being suspended from I guess esports or whatever for some Dota 2 match fixing.

2385
02:59:06,489 --> 02:59:10,811
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess it's allegedly that one team I guess bet against themselves and threw the match.

2386
02:59:12,692 --> 02:59:13,112
[SPEAKER_10]: Apparently.

2387
02:59:13,953 --> 02:59:14,693
[SPEAKER_10]: And now they're banned.

2388
02:59:16,574 --> 02:59:16,934
[SPEAKER_10]: Some people.

2389
02:59:17,895 --> 02:59:19,035
[SPEAKER_10]: All for about like a $100 bet.

2390
02:59:19,055 --> 02:59:19,156
[SPEAKER_10]: Well...

2391
02:59:22,267 --> 02:59:22,907
[SPEAKER_06]: Cheatin's cheatin'.

2392
02:59:23,528 --> 02:59:23,808
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2393
02:59:25,049 --> 02:59:27,190
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

2394
02:59:27,230 --> 02:59:34,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, if you enjoyed the show tonight, and if you disagree with us wholeheartedly, thank you for sticking with it for three hours.

2395
02:59:34,535 --> 02:59:38,238
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you think we're not being fair to Microsoft or maybe being too fair...

2396
02:59:38,638 --> 02:59:41,600
[SPEAKER_06]: to Microsoft or Sony or Nintendo.

2397
02:59:42,260 --> 02:59:43,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Send us your feedback.

2398
02:59:43,140 --> 02:59:46,042
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a show where every gamer has a voice and we're interested in what you have to say.

[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is our email address or you can also reach out to us on Twitter at Twitter.com slash OLR or post on our Facebook page at Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio.

2400
02:59:56,087 --> 02:59:59,669
[SPEAKER_06]: We do read all of it even if we don't always respond to it right away.

2401
03:00:01,309 --> 03:00:10,352
[SPEAKER_06]: and we thank you guys for your support and especially with all the bullshit that's going on with Bobby's house getting hit by lightning right now which really sucks.

2402
03:00:10,892 --> 03:00:20,234
[SPEAKER_06]: The way you guys are really banding together in chat just really shows why this network is an amazing place and I'm really happy to have you all as a part of it going into next week's birthday show.

2403
03:00:20,274 --> 03:00:22,175
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a great thing to keep in mind.

2404
03:00:22,816 --> 03:00:32,312
[SPEAKER_06]: we will be back to do it all again next week with our 11th birthday JV Mon will be here in the house on the east coast representing New York City peeps I really need to get back to New York City

2405
03:00:33,103 --> 03:00:33,543
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanna go.

2406
03:00:34,323 --> 03:00:34,563
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

2407
03:00:34,583 --> 03:00:36,664
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been since I was a senior in high school.

2408
03:00:36,824 --> 03:00:37,884
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't been in a while either.

2409
03:00:38,245 --> 03:00:41,586
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, let's go around and get everybody's final thought before we wrap up tonight.

2410
03:00:43,006 --> 03:00:50,428
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought tonight is I need to download and play Marvel Heroes this week because I keep hearing about it and I keep forgetting to play it.

2411
03:00:50,488 --> 03:00:51,469
[SPEAKER_06]: So I will play it this week.

2412
03:00:52,649 --> 03:00:54,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I know DarkSakura, but I want to give it a try for myself.

2413
03:00:55,891 --> 03:00:56,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, your final thoughts tonight.

2414
03:00:57,232 --> 03:01:10,379
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully my, I've got these, what is it, Ethernet over power adapters that I'm getting so that I can hook up my PlayStation 3 to the front room TV instead of having to have to drag a 50 foot TV.

2415
03:01:11,385 --> 03:01:16,966
[SPEAKER_10]: Ethernet cable into that room because remember, I have a launched 20 gig system that doesn't have Wi-Fi.

2416
03:01:17,706 --> 03:01:18,787
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2417
03:01:18,887 --> 03:01:21,227
[SPEAKER_10]: So hopefully that'll come soon so I can do that.

2418
03:01:21,547 --> 03:01:24,248
[SPEAKER_10]: And I need to download and install and play Final Fantasy 14.

2419
03:01:25,828 --> 03:01:29,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Lastly, and certainly not leastly, DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.

2420
03:01:29,589 --> 03:01:30,529
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a sore throat.

2421
03:01:31,409 --> 03:01:31,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Aw.

2422
03:01:31,890 --> 03:01:36,151
[SPEAKER_02]: It started during the mailbag and I will try not to breathe on anybody just in case.

2423
03:01:36,251 --> 03:01:38,111
[SPEAKER_06]: You need another cup of coffee or a lozenge.

2424
03:01:39,266 --> 03:01:40,246
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like a lozenge.

2425
03:01:40,486 --> 03:01:40,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Or both.

2426
03:01:41,147 --> 03:01:41,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Sadly, I don't have any.

2427
03:01:42,027 --> 03:01:44,368
[SPEAKER_02]: But I could totally do Jewish Mother Voice now.

2428
03:01:45,168 --> 03:01:45,408
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2429
03:01:46,148 --> 03:01:46,569
[SPEAKER_06]: That does it.

03:01:46,629 --> 03:01:49,449

03:03:06,371 --> 03:03:06,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Be quiet.

2445
03:03:06,711 --> 03:03:07,532
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't ready for you.

2446
03:03:09,713 --> 03:03:10,654
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess that thing was looping.

2447
03:03:11,134 --> 03:03:12,935
[SPEAKER_06]: We gotta get to our fortune cookie message of the day.

2448
03:03:14,136 --> 03:03:15,117
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot what I picked.

2449
03:03:15,137 --> 03:03:17,298
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had such a long day today.

2450
03:03:19,062 --> 03:03:21,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my gosh, that was a busy show tonight, you guys.

2451
03:03:22,023 --> 03:03:23,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys for all the kind words.

2452
03:03:23,023 --> 03:03:24,044
[SPEAKER_14]: Early bedtime for Rob.

2453
03:03:24,204 --> 03:03:27,485
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't a super funny show, but I felt the discussion was good.

2454
03:03:27,745 --> 03:03:28,125
[SPEAKER_06]: It was.

2455
03:03:28,265 --> 03:03:29,666
[SPEAKER_06]: It can't always be dick and fart jokes.

2456
03:03:29,686 --> 03:03:30,446
[SPEAKER_14]: We had a lot happen.

2457
03:03:30,666 --> 03:03:31,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so thank you guys.

2458
03:03:31,646 --> 03:03:32,767
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys really contributed to that.

2459
03:03:33,187 --> 03:03:37,589
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's get to the fortune cookie message of the day, guys, and then we'll be back to wrap it all up.

2460
03:03:39,689 --> 03:03:43,951
[SPEAKER_07]: There's this idea that people are meaner than they used to be because the internet, you know, that people are meaner.

2461
03:03:43,971 --> 03:03:44,491
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not meaner.
