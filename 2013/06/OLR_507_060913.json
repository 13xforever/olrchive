{"text": " Today, June 9th, 2013, Microsoft's controversial announcements could change the industry forever. Zinga layoffs affect a developer they recently acquired, and E3 is next week and we're making our predictions for the big show. Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 507 for this June 9th of 2013. My name is Rob Roberts, joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. Greetings and salutations. And I hope you're doing well, Ms. Summers. I am. I'm good. I'm caffeinated. Thank you, Rob. Good to hear. And also joining us tonight, Techmaster Loki. Yes, definitely working in that Techmaster moniker this week. How so? Quickly. I had to fix my laptop. Oh, yeah. Hard drive crash. Yeah, I've been following your tweets, your Twitters, and all the hard drive drama. But now it works pretty much like it did before. All it needed was a little reformat. All the non-essential stuff's not working, like some of these touch buttons up the top here that I never use, or, you know, the icon's different now for the volume up and down. But, eh, whatever. All right. Big week this week. E3, obviously, coming up. Unfortunately, none of us attending this year. Bobby Blackwolf from The Voice of Geeks Network at vognetwork.com, he is attending. And if you haven't already checked it out, do check out the interactive coverage of E3, presented in an all-new way at the voice of geeksnetwork of e3.vognetwork.com, or at least we think it's an all-new way. The internet's a big place. Probably. But very cool. I haven't seen it. Bobby will be on the show later to tell us a little more about that and participate with us on something else, but I will table that until Part B. It's obviously a very big show tonight. There is a lot going on in the gaming world. Usually we do a kickoff topic, but I think tonight we need to address the pink elephant in the room. Let's get into it, Loki. So after the whole, well, I guess the promise was after the Xbox One press event thing that they did back in May, that there was going to be some answers about, or clarification I guess, on the big hot topics that they were getting grilled on after the event, basically. What is the deal with the online connectivity? How often do I need to connect to the internet? How is the used game thing going to work? And what's up with the Kinect having to be online all the time, or attached to your system at all times of work? So on Friday, I think it was Friday, was it Friday? Yeah, the 6th. On Friday, no, that was Thursday. Anyways, on the 6th, they released a three page document, if you will, called Xbox One Details on Connectivity, Licensing, and Privacy Features. So let's just go through each one, shall we? First, Xbox One, a modern connected device. And to kind of spoil everything, none of this stuff is actually sounding any good. It's pretty much just reinforcing what we already have heard, that they said, oh, we'll make change. So the Xbox One will deliver new benefits for gamers that are only possible with a system designed from the ground up to be ready and connected. Here are a few examples. First generation games powered by the cloud. So you'll be able to use the cloud servers to make your game more powerful or something. Your Xbox One is always ready. It's designed to run with, I guess, a low powered state. OK, let's get to the good part. Network technologies and network requirements, here we go. For an optimal experience, we recommend a broadband connection of 1.5 megabits. And also, in areas where, I guess, an ethernet connection is not available, you can connect using mobile broadband. Lucky you. And also, while a persistent connection is not required, the Xbox One is designed to verify if the system application or game updates are needed, and to see if you have acquired new games, resold or traded in games, or have given a game to a friend. Games that are designed to take advantage of the cloud system may require a connection. And then, of course, with Xbox One, you can game offline for up to 24 hours on your primary console or one hour if you're logged into a separate console accessing your library. Offline gaming is not possible after these prescribed times until you reestablish a connection, but you can still, oh, oh, and this is the best part, but guess what? You can still watch live TV, enjoy your Blu-ray and DVD movies. Oh, thank you, Xbox One. I can still enjoy TV that you are connected to. Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to mourn the loss of the gaming industry. Rest in peace. All right, let's get to the next thing here. All right, so next, how game licensing will work on the Xbox One. And I'm glad that they have to tell me how it's gonna work. Okay, so basically, you buy the games the way you want, disc or digital, and you'll be able to buy them through traditional retailers or online through Xbox Live. And it says, disc will continue to be a great way to install your game quickly. Yes, to install, not play off of install. You can access your entire games library from any Xbox One, no discs required. Because after all, you're signing in and accessing the games that you have installed to your system or the cloud or whatever it is. You can share access with your games to everyone inside your home. Your friends, family, and your guests and acquaintances get unlimited access to all your games. Anyone can play your games on your console regardless of whether you're logged in or their relationship to you. In other words, a feature that's been available on console gaming since the beginning of time. That yes, if I bring a friend over, that they can play on the Xbox One without it going, Who are you? What are you doing trying to touch my controller and play this game? Get your hands off my controller. I need an adult. You can share access, let's see, give your family access to your entire games library anytime, anywhere. Now this is kind of weird. The Xbox One, I guess, they're going to have a way where up to 10 people of your family or whoever you're seeing as your family can log in and play from your shared games library on any Xbox One. So if I buy a copy of say, Forza Motorsports or something like that, someone else can go to a friend's house or whatever or from their own location and play that copy of Forza as well. But only one person can play at a time. And not at launch. None of this is available at launch. All the good stuff, all the pros, not at launch. I don't know if that's available at launch. It doesn't say. Trade in and resell your disc based games. Okay. It says today some gamers choose to sell their old disc based games back for cash and credit. We've designed the Xbox One so game publishers can enable you to trade in your games at participating retailers. So it's an optional feature. So no eBay, gone. No flea markets, gone. No garage sales, gone. Authorized retailers only if the publisher allows it. It's now not my choice on what I'm going to do with my game. It's now Microsoft's choice or the publisher's choice on what I'm going to do with my game. But we don't own it. We're licensing it. That's right. It was never ours to begin with. I don't sign a form when I'm playing these games. Although I'm sure you're going to have to agree to it when you install your game. Oh sure. Press A to agree to the 500 page terms and conditions or you won't be able to play anything. Because things are brick. Let's see, Microsoft does not charge a platform fee to retailers, publishers, or consumers for enabling transfer of these games. Which I don't know, it kind of goes against what I've heard and what we've been hearing rumors wise. But maybe it's not Microsoft charging them. Maybe it's the publisher's charging these guys. I don't really know. Whatever that doesn't. All right. So what are the key points out of this whole thing because we got to get to the bottom line here. Well a couple more. Okay. They're going to allow you to give your games to a friend. So you can enable your disc based game, give it to a friend basically. There's no fees. But there's two requirements in order to transfer this to your friend. They have to be on your friend's list for 30 days and you can only give the game once. Once it's been transferred to them, I don't think that they can give it back to someone else. Now I don't know if that's clarified. So no wishing for more wishes? Yes. Okay. If it is where you can give it to somebody, you know, the friend's list thing is kind of annoying, but like say you can give it to them and then they can give it to somebody else, you know, that's not so bad, but it's still annoying. You know what? I will give credit where credit is due. It sounds like Microsoft's trying to implement the Kindle book borrowing thing, which just sounds a lot like, and I'm like, all right, that's cool because I know I lent out a lot of video games. I never get back. So that's interesting. It can be handled all digitally, but, um, you know, what am I having to give up? What's the minus for this plus? Right? Yeah. Okay. And last but not least, I'll just breeze through this. The connect stuff. Um, they say you're in control of where the connect can see in here because I guess you get to adjust your privacy settings or something. So the system will navigate you through key privacy options like automatic or manual sign in privacy settings and clear notification how data is used. Wait, how is data being used? So I'm assuming this thing is just going to be listening for, you know, advertising purposes and stuff. If they hear a lot of wank, a lot of porn, you're in control of what the connect or of the connect sensor, um, sensing on, off or paused. Um, you can turn off your Xbox one and um, you know, if they say it's only listening for a single voice command of Xbox on, but come on, I'm sorry. Uh, you're in control of your personal data and you can use other inputs to control your games TV and entertainment experiences. So once again, why do I need to connect, you know, attached to this thing? If I can control it with a controller, it doesn't make it's, I'm going to be honest and I'm not trying to be that snarky kid on Twitter, but I, I, I'm, this is really kind of like a, it's a vague answer that they kind of gave to this like, so, so what does it have to be on or not? Well there's, it's basically, it has to be connected to your system, but I think you can point it at the wall, you can turn your system off or something and then it won't be listening. Just don't underestimate the value of, of privacy and all that. And this is really badly timed for Microsoft. I mean, again, there's a lot of news that there's a lot of, there's a lot of news out there right now. I'm not trying to get political. I'm not going to take the show there, but there's a lot of news right now about privacy and Microsoft's names involved. Exactly. So this is not a good time to be requiring anything with that connect, just saying. And they're, they're saying that they, you know, some of the examples, of course they've mentioned before, a fitness game can measure your heart rate, give you feedback about your exercise routine or whatever, be able to tell if you're a communist, a card game could allow you to bluff your virtual opponent using your facial expressions. But once again, you know, the connect could allow you to scan in your objects and use them in real games. That never happens. So who knows? Okay, so that's it. That's basically the information. Um, well, uh, here's the thing you ever seen that show Shark Tank, you ever watched that show? Yeah. Yeah. Here's the premise of the show. These guys pitched their ideas to all these big executives. Like Mark Cuban's one of the executives that sits there. It's actually, as far as reality TV goes, it's one of the better shows. Cause it's, it's a little more like these guys are real business makers and you kind of see, like, I dunno, there, there's less of the pompousness that comes with the Donald Trump business show and there's a little more like, you know, reality, I guess for lack of a better term. But anyway, the whole kitsch kitchens, there's, they're pitching their ideas and you know, maybe it's a lady who's got a new idea for something for that women could have at their weddings or a guy. I just seem to remember an episode where a guy, uh, was selling man candles because that ended up being a thing at like Yankee Canada, one of those later on. Yeah, like mandels. Well, anyway, the whole pitch is that as you're given these ideas, if one of the executive says I'm out, that's their sign that they are not going to put a bid. And if all four of them say I'm out, the guy loses, walks away, doesn't get the financing they want. And I got to admit after listening to this, this, this whole detail thing that's, that's gone on this week, I'm kind of sitting in that chair. And when I'm hearing about the whole, here's the minuses, here's a plus in the game trading and all that. But here's all these minuses that suddenly these $60 games may not be worth anything anymore. I do not have, that's what I hate the most. I no longer have the power to sell this game on eBay. If I want to do it, I have to go to a GameStop or a comparable store. Are you kidding me? That's not what I want. And that's the point where I said, I'm out. And on top of that, the plus is like, Oh, you can loan it to your friend. Something I can do already right now with all these fucking restrictions and why, why do I even, and that's the thing. It's so sad that this has to happen because I want to be excited about this new console. I wanted to be excited about the games that they're coming out with, but I'm sorry. Even if there's like a new crackdown game or whatever, the big awesome game they're going to show is all this stuff is just like right in front of me and it's like, well, that sounds cool, but nope. To me, it's very much like how I treat origin. Battlefield 3 looks fucking amazing. I really want to play that game. I'm not installing origin, so therefore I'm not going to play the game. That's it. I mean, it's unfortunate. These games look awesome, but all this stuff stands in my way, so I'm not going to do it. For me, a lot of it is kind of about control and I feel like what's happening this console generation that I just don't fucking like is that the publishers are trying to take all these things away from me that I used to get as the investor in the game. You know what I mean? Like I used to be able to sell the used games and, you know, trade the games I wanted to and they could put in the disc or whatever. Like the publishers have been slowly thinking of ways to take that away and I just don't like it. I understand the cost of developing a game is super expensive and all that, but the line's got to be drawn somewhere. It doesn't have to be super expensive. They decided to go big and, you know, big and bold, I guess, for their games. It doesn't have to be. Indie games that come out are still just as good. How much does it cost to develop Minecraft? Granted, it's not as visually stunning as something else, but it doesn't have to be visually stunning. It just has to be fun. It has to be fun to play. That's all it has to be. Let me go to the chatroom. Lots and lots of folks chatting on this and I don't want to ignore you guys, live.vognetwork.com where we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show as the Voice of the Geeks Network, vognetwork.com. YYR in chat starting us off tonight saying, Rob, this is the way the industry wants to move. I understand that, that this is the way the industry wants to move, but I have a right to say I'm not moving with it and I think we all have that right. Well, the industries don't determine what the consumers do. The consumers determine what the industry should do. I want to make, well, I want to make an analogy to where I think this is all going, but actually first I want to address because I see numerous people in chat rooms saying, well, that's it. PS4 is for me this generation, but Monday hasn't happened yet, at least as of the taping of the show. I realized, you know, by the time some of you were hearing this on the podcast, Monday may have already happened. We don't really know where Sony's at and some of the signs point to they're going down a similar path. I think they are, but I don't think it's definitely, well, it's definitely not going to be part of their presentation. It's going to be people grilling them on it again and, I mean, look at all the stuff that's happened before, you know, before all this, this, this whole three page thing came out, there was reports going Microsoft canceled their after, you know, conference Q&A session. They canceled their one-on-one interviews. They just don't want to talk to people and then they put this stuff out and that's it. They're just leaving it at that, but on top of all this, so you first off the whole game sharing thing with your family and stuff. Don't assume for one second that they're not going to expect each one of those people to have live, you know, a paid subscription to live in order for that to happen. And so why am I having to pay money for this console? Pay money for live and like, it's like I had to pay for the privilege to be like fucked over because you want to start, you're feeling greedy or something that you feel like we're just not giving you enough money. I also just don't like the fact that the Xbox has to talk to the servers once every 24 hours because you know, it's not that I have a problem with it in theory or on paper. Like you know, I do, I play a lot of MMOs. Of course those talk to the servers. I'm not so much caring about it in principle, but the reality is what's going to happen when those servers go down because they will go down and history has shown that this is what happens. PlayStation network down for months due to a hack attack. You don't think there's kiddies out there that want to hack this new network the minute it goes up because they're angry too. Xbox live goes down for a day or two at a time. Granted, a lot of that is about maintenance, whatever. But then we see things happen. Diablo three, we can handle it. We can handle it. Crash, boom, error 37. Sim city by EA. We can handle it. We can handle it. Crash, boom. It all goes down. Xbox will go down. What happens then? You're not going to be able to convince me otherwise because history has shown it will go down and what is going to happen. Wank there is, there is no server on the face of the earth that has not, you know, that has not gone down for any period of time. I mean, I know they're saying that it's going to have a ton of, you know, they're going to have a ton of servers or virtual servers or whatever, but they're going to have to perform maintenance on these things. It's got to go down for maintenance for a certain amount of time. I mean, it's just, it's going to lock people out at some point. Can we go back to PlayStation four though? Because I do think there's a distinct possibility, at least some of this is going to be true about Sony system as well. Yeah. Um, and to which parts not sure, but it seems like maybe the game registration, especially in you, you, you told me before the show, you're banking a lot on EA's online pass and their reason to get rid of that is because they've got the buy in from Sony and Microsoft and they've given the finger to Nintendo essentially. They won't. Nintendo is nothing to them. It's a very minimalist, minimal amount of copy. They're belittling it. Yeah. So they, they just don't care about that right now. But I think they wouldn't have gone all in if they didn't know that it was a guarantee from both parties, both public or both, uh, console manufacturers. And honestly, I just have a hot, especially we have to see how similar it is. If it's very similar, I'm, there's some serious antitrust, you know, concerns there because it's like, what are these guys just sit down and make, decide, Hey, we're going to do this. This is how we're going to do this system. And you know, we're going to both be on board and we're going to both benefit from it because they're going to have no choice. You know, we're going to get rid of options for them. But I like, you know, even though there's all this negative information, I have to wait until when the console come out before I can make my decision because they could very well, hopefully, you know, say, fuck you guys. You know, you know, seriously to EA. What are they going to do? They got to, you kind of get some balls here because what's Microsoft can do. They can say, fuck you EA, what are you going to do? Not publish games on our console. And if Microsoft and Sony does that, what are they going to do? Publish PC only? I mean, they're not, they have to kind of agree on some sort of partnership here. It's just, I mean, if Sony, let's just say in a perfect world, Sony would, you know, say, okay, listen, we're not going to put up with this bullshit. We're just going to keep things kind of the way they are right now. And they could totally have this in the bag. Easy, easy. This generation could come out on top and just totally rule everything. But I have a feeling that's not the case. I don't think Microsoft would take a risk like that without, you know, knowing that both parties are going to do that. But yet there, you know, there's going to be some little differences in policy because for instance, we heard last week about how Sony is mandating that there be off screen play or whatever for PlayStation Vita. So there are going to be little twists in the rules. So you know, maybe, maybe, maybe Microsoft implemented, just, just theorizing a tinfoil hat here, maybe Microsoft invented the whole game sharing Amazon Kindle thing to try and put a little positive in a negative that they agreed to with Sony. And maybe Sony is not going to have that. Maybe Sony's, Sony's only got the negative and their positive is the PlayStation Vita play. You know, that kind of where one where we're trying to see who can come up with the best silver lining to the shitty situation. But see, that's the thing. It's like, like I've, there's some people on Twitter and stuff and saying, hey, well, the 10 game sharing thing is kind of cool. I can share my games with someone else cause then I can cost average, you know, the games I'm buying. I'm like, but, but so what you can do that anyways, just, you know, you loan your games to your friends if you really want to. I just don't, I don't want to look, just say, well, at least they have this. Okay, well that's good, but no, they're taking away all this stuff from us. I'm sorry. I'll just stick with what I've got right now and if I have to, I'll just go PC because at least there there's flexibility with, I know, I know there's DRM with steam, but there's also mods with steam. There's also all sorts of customization. There's indie games. There's just insane sales on stuff. I can honestly say yes, I use steam, but I have, I'm, I really think I maybe, maybe ever bought one game, one game in the years I've owned steam. I've bought one game full retail price and that would have been Civ five, a PC only game. I never have. And even when I could have gotten a, yeah, then it was stupid origin bullshit. But when I bought mass effect three, for example, yeah, I bought it new, but I went and price matched somewhere, so I didn't pay full price for it and didn't go through origin. Oh yeah. If they, if Microsoft were to announce at the end of their press conference, by the way, uh, we're going to be lowering the price of games from $60 to $30 I I'm in, I'm back in because if that's the plus that the games are now going to cost half as much, you know, so okay, you know, I'll be back in, in a heartbeat. It's not going to happen. It's not going to happen because here's, what's going to happen. Here's what it is. You think that you're going to get better prices because now the stuff, now they're getting rid of the used market, so to speak. It's not going to happen because on PC you have multiple storefronts that are competing with each other and yeah, it may be all steam DRM and stuff, but they're having sales all across the board with Microsoft going this route. Not only are you going to be limited where you can trade your game in, so right there you're not going to get a really good deal as far as trading value goes because, Hey, we're also going to go, we're your only options. So your trading value is going to fucking suck to begin with and on top of that, you think they're really going to mark down prices of games. Hell, there's games on their Xbox games on demand service right now that are still way above what you can actually get them in a disk space format. So no, you're kidding yourself. A couple of great comments in our chat room. I want to get to Ahamkara in our chat says, I noticed Japan is not porting some of their best games out of the country offer good games to themselves for cheap or free and don't seem to care. Funny how Microsoft is giving them the finger now by focusing on TV for Xbox one and not caring about Japan as well. Well, I mean, we've all kind of sat here going, well, clearly Microsoft's written off Japan, but if Sony were to adopt these similar measures, how would that impact Japanese gaming culture? Are Japanese game? I mean, I honestly don't know. Are Japanese gamers as willing to buy into all this? I think that it's not necessarily going to work because from what, just from what I've seen and of course we need somebody who lives there to confirm this. There's a big culture around having collectibles being, you know, one of the campers to get the game the first day, like the big lines around the Capcom store for whenever a Monster Hunter game comes out. It's a different type of culture. Like, you know, we may have a few, maybe a few people standing in line for a new system release or for having like maybe one super special game, you know, like the Madden ones, but it's nowhere near the crazy levels that it happens in Japan. Right. You know, and then like, for example, I mean, I keep bringing up my stupid Cardcaptor Sakura Dreamcast game. It had a pillow pillowcase and a clock and a fork and a spoon and a dish. Yes. But I mean, and there was, um, a Sakura Taisen game that came out in the same type of bundle, but I mean, there's lots of crazy-ass special editions that come out and people like their packaging. Akuma JP, like clockwork, shows up in chat when you said, we need somebody from Japan to be listening, but he just turned the station on, uh, we're talking about the, um, uh, Microsoft Xbox one DRM restrictions. And I was just kind of wondering if Sony's going down that same route, how, how does that impact Japanese gaming culture? Are the Japanese going to be as willing to buy into some of these restrictions? I still think there's going to be physical packaging. There's still going to be copies you can buy and sell because there is, I mean, there's a big part of the economy around that and there's a big part of the culture around that as I mean, you even see like a few people over here who like to get their import special editions and everything. All right. One more comment. I want to get here from chat. And then I do kind of want to move on with the show because we have a lot of news to cover in this pre E3 week, and I know we're going to get back to this topic during phone calls tonight. Uh, but I want to get this comment here from Koopa kid. He says, thankfully, Nintendo isn't smart enough with online to be, to even be able to implement these types of features. You know, this is something I've kind of referenced in past episodes on the show when we were all worried about this is that could Nintendo end up as the, you know, they're the right now they're the dog in the corner chasing its tail, looking a little silly and everybody's like, what a weird dog. But now all of a sudden it's like, it's, it's the most attractive puppy in the room and everybody might want to adopt it. How is, has Nintendo's failure to embrace online, which granted probably is what drove EA. Does that suddenly make them the most attractive option to Japanese gamers, to people like me that feel like I'm, I'm now for the, I don't want all these Draconia measures. Honestly I would, if, if they put an Xbox, actually as I've been calling it the X bone in front of me versus a Wii U, given me money and said, pick one to buy. You can, you can buy one. I would go for the Wii U. End of story. I don't even care if it's just a glorified Wii. I would pick that over the X bone because well, let's face it, I already have an Xbox 360. I already have all this other stuff I can play. If I had to pick one, it'd be the Wii U because I wouldn't have to be limited. Loki do you have a thought? Cause then I'm going to ask Jamie a very tough question. Um, no, I still don't want a Wii U and the other reason it goes back to what the original reason why I don't want a Wii U cause there's nothing I want to play on it and I don't really consider a next gen console. I mean, honestly, the stuff you're going to see on the Wii U, especially coming out of new games is stuff that's going to be ported to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation three already. I don't need to buy another console for games I can play on my console that I already have. Now the only advantage I see, and it's been kind of, I've been thinking about more cause my wife has been really hogging the TV, is that off, off screen or the, uh, you know, second screenplay stuff is kind of cool because I do want to play console games a lot of times and my wife wants to watch TV. So you know, that is the only positive, but once again, it's, I don't want to buy a new console just for that because I have my laptop, I can play on my laptop if really willing to. So it's just, no one's holding a gun to my head to force me to buy a new console. I don't have to. So I, you know, really, you know, if that's the thought process that they're going in with it saying, well, you know, that's why EA can get rid of, you know, their online passes because hey, they've got to buy another console at some point. No, I don't, I don't have to do anything. That's the thing. I don't have to follow what you want me to do. And don't think for one second that no one's going to figure out a way to put some sort of device in between your console and the internet to fucking spoof that authentication server. I kind of think that's what's going to happen too. The gamers going to hack, right? It's going to happen. They will. And this will be a focus. YYR in chat says all these draconian restrictions aren't going to send most gamers to, aren't going to send most gamers to Wii U, the Nintendo fans will already buy one and everyone else will just not buy a console. I think if anything, I think people will still buy one next gen console, even though they hate everything because they're like, well, I got to play Killer Instinct or I got to play whatever. You know, I always try to gauge this if, you know, in trying to, in the years I've been doing the show and the commentary and everything, I find that the best insight comes from non-gamers truly. If I want to really get a feel for where people, where, you know, the America's head is really at, I'm not going to look for it on Twitter, sorry guys, I'm not going to look for it with you because we're a very unique, you know, smaller sort of subset fan base. And I look to general people, people that don't consider themselves gamers. And you know, this week I was on a work trip in Phoenix and I was with a couple of coworkers and the subject of video games came up just randomly. I think, I think somebody had asked about my podcast and I was talking about it kind of casually and he mentioned, yeah, oh yeah, I really like Assassin's Creed and yeah, I heard about that Xbox one, but I heard it's not going to play any of the used stuff. I don't think I want to get one. It sounds like it's too restrictive. And I'm kind of just thinking in the back of my head, I'm like, I wonder if there's a lot of people that, you know, when they just kind of hear what a friend of a friend says to them, they're going to run with that. You know what I mean? Gamers will buy the console. There'll be something on it. There's always going to be the people there. There will be PlayStation fours that sell. There will be Xbox ones that sell. Will they sell more than Wii U? You know, I don't know, you know, the best time to buy an Xbox one's going to be the end of the generation when they do eventually shut down those authentication servers. And let's assume that they go the, you know, steam route and they unlock it so that you don't have to call in every 24 hours, you know, it just works. Or they can be fucking dicks and say, well, fuck, no, your shit's going to work now. So let me ask Jamie the difficult question, then we'll move into our gaming week. Okay. All right. And I opened this up to the chatters as well. For the 11 years this month that we've been doing orange launch radio, we've always had a mantra on this show 11 years. And we're actually having a show on June 23rd this year, which is the birthday. So anyway, that's only what, like three weeks away. Holy crap. I'd lost count. Our 11th birthday is coming up y'all. Okay. So for the 11 years on this program, we've had a mantra on this show about gaming. And that is a system is only as good as the games that are on it, but Microsoft's about to unveil 15 exclusives, which might include some of the things we've been clamoring for for a long time, killer instinct, you know, perhaps that Banjo Kazooie thing. I don't know. I'm going to fanboy wank here, but now because of all these things that the system is doing, I'm coming back to question, is that mantra still true? I think we may have to evolve it. Because we've got a system now that's doing things that systems didn't do in the past. We have a new restriction being placed on how they're trying to change how the system works. And so with that, I believe I'm trying to think of how to phrase this. I think that the games themselves should speak for themselves, but they have to be made accessible. If you don't have access to the game, it does you no good. If it's not going to give you a way to play the game, that's I hope I'm making it's a tough question. It's tough to phrase, but I just kind of feel like the golden rule of gaming may finally have shown a blemish this week. I think that to be able to appreciate the game being on the system, you have to have a system that's going to allow you to enjoy it. Does that make sense? Sure. So like for it has to work. It has to like for the Nintendo, you put the cartridge in the system and you know, it's going to work. Even if you blow on the cartridge 100 times, you know, it has to just work right. But now we're calling into question, is this really going to work? I have to quote Queen Simia, sprinkles on a turd don't make it any more tasty. Um, cause actually, actually that's pretty much how it is. I think that, Oh God, it's hard for me to say. Okay. Let me, let me try this from clerical error 404 in chat, uh, at live.vognetwork.com clerical error 404 says, I think the mantra needs to evolve in that it needs to have the games, but also the versatility, the more games that are accessible by more people and potential players. Power to the players. Right. Agreed. Uh, the evil G there, but here's, here's really where my thought is on this one. And I hope this makes sense because I've been trying to, the thoughts clear in my head, but it's kind of hard to bring into words. A system is only as good as the games that are accessible on it. Preach. Okay. But I'm using, I'm using example here. Back in the day, like I'm going to use symphony of the night. Okay. For Saturn and for PlayStation. Cause I've got them both. I liked the Saturn version better. It was accessible to me at the time because I could import it, but other people, but say that I had no means of importing the game and all I had was a $20 copy that I bought used at GameStop because you could buy the music GameStop, Ooh. Well then I would say, well, of course I like the PlayStation version because I haven't been able to play it on the Saturn. I have no basis of comparison. So say that you've got this system here that you don't want to invest in because of its practices around the game. Say the PS4 comes out and it's fully open and everything's nice and lovely and the same games come out for it. You're still going to go with the one that's more accessible to you because that's what you have. You have no basis of comparison saying X version is better. Isn't necessarily fair because you can't compare it. Is that the reason why I tend to buy games on the PlayStation three over the Xbox three 60 for the mere simple fact that I like the controller better? Yeah, I mean that's really the same. Not always. Cause sometimes, sometimes, but then I go, if I want to play the game online with friends, I go to the three 60 because it's got the better network. Thank you. Clerical error. Four Oh four. This is a set. I learned as you for preferring the Saturn version just because I really like playing as Maria. Okay. All right. The whole point is, is that the games being good to play is also determined by the other factors that go into actually playing the game itself. Like for you, the controller, like for me, I love playing Saturn games because the dual analog controller does not hurt my hand even to this day, but playing, um, like I'm better with RPG. Like I like playing RPGs better now because I get to move my hand. I don't have to keep moving my thumb around and, you know, pulling up my, uh, my scar on my hand, all the scar tissue I've got. So it's really going to be a matter of how you play it as well as the content itself. And if it's not allowing you to access that content, then why bother? All right. Well, it's a complicated issue. Any, any quick last words, Loki, you want to get in before we move on here? No, it's just, I just disappointed that the news came out now and not after, because I wish I could be a little bit excited about what Microsoft showing, but you sound like a tweet I made earlier this week that every year I'm so excited about E3 and like, Yay, new games. Yay. This year I really have a sense of dread about E3 this year. It's about how am I getting fucked over this year? Like, and I'm sorry to sound like that jaded gamers hate everything.com guy, but I'm not going to lie to you. That's where I'm at right now, whether I'm overreacting or not. No, it's a lot of money you're asking me to drop on a console where it's not even really my console. At some point I got to put my foot down and say, I love video games, but no, I'm done. Here's another question too, is how is the, how are they even going to enable this with like the first sale doctrine and stuff? Cause you know, I, I just don't know if they're going to say, well, you're licensing stuff from us now. Well, I don't know if they're going to be able to. I think that that could, you could, well, considering how Sue happy everything is, I think we could very well see that this is going to be a lawsuit within a year or so. I forgot to make my analogy, so I'll make it quick. Oh, I thought you did. No, I didn't. I make a lot of crazy analogies. There's one I was sitting on all week. Who remembers Divx? Oh my God. And I'm not talking about the codec on your computer that lets you watch movies and things like that. I'm talking about when there was actually a Divx player at circuit city, but it always had to be connected online because you could rent the movies at the store and the thing ended up flopping. Why did the Divx flop? Because of all the restrictions on it. There weren't any games on it or any, no, there weren't any, uh, movies for it. Well, there was, there was the same movies that were on DVD and laser disc. Well, for the people who don't know what Divx is, just think of the little mascot from penny arcade. They have that little Divx player character that that's a Divx machine. And I'm sorry, but right now what I'm hearing at X-Box one sounds very Divx to me. And I think people rejected Divx because they wanted to own their shit and they didn't want to have to keep dialing this server that was daddy Steven Spielberg, who was a co-owner in this daddy Steven Spielberg. May I watch this movie? People want to have control in the end. Yeah. Game guru and chat Divx, the disc player that killed circuit city. Absolutely. It brought down an entire chain with it. Don't think that the Divx didn't have a lasting negative impact on circuit city. Well, and also, also keep in mind there, um, I just completely lost my train of thought. No, it was, um, the fact that you still have people today that even though we've got iTunes and we have all this digital distribution, there's still people who like to physically go out and buy a disc who will prefer to buy their music on CD. There's quite a few people in chat agreeing with you. Yes. Yeah. I mean, I'm not necessarily one of them, but anyway. All right. Lots of passion behind this topic. I'm sure we'll hear more about it during our phone call segment later, as well as the mailbag mailbag at orange launch radio.com. It's going to be a very interesting answer it. I'm kidding. It's going to be a very interesting E3 week. That's all I have to say. I, I, I'm really looking forward to next week's show when Sony will have to put it out on the table because they didn't cancel their media stuff. Right. So they're going to have to answer this question. And finally, we'll have a clearer picture to what things are going to look like come this fall. In the meantime, quickly, guys, how was your gaming week? We always start off the show, haha, with how was your gaming week? Dark soccer. Start? Um, well, I, after my kind of poo pooing on Star Trek online, I saw there was a new expansion. So I decided to give it a try again and it's actually fun. The legacy of Romulus expansion. I mean, I just started off a character, but I had a really good time doing it and I really liked what it added to the, uh, as I'm calling it, the main timeline lore. It was really good. So I've actually been enjoying that and they kind of set the skill trees back to how they used to be. Not necessarily exactly the same. And I kind of respect my Vice Admiral incorrectly, but still they, they did a lot of really cool stuff. Actually, I'll tell you what was funny because I was just running around on my Vice Admiral because I have her pretty much, uh, permanently parked at a deep space nine. They put Morin in Quark's bar and like as a big DS nine fan, that made me stupendously happy and like it even had him like quote telling a story, even though he never talks, it just sort of did a fade out and then shaking his head for Lornely and everything. It was pretty funny. Um, I did start Marvel heroes. I do not care for it. It reminded me a bit of playing, um, Marvel Ultimate Alliance without the fun part of having other people to play with. And the fact that... Interesting because you're the first one I've heard say something negative about it. I mean, everybody has their opinion. I just, uh, interesting. I'm not saying it wasn't fun and yeah, it's free to play, but if I wanted, but if I wanted another character, I pretty much have to buy, um, 20 bucks worth of points for one character. Or if I bought $40 worth of points, that would get me, you know, maybe three characters. And the one that I really wanted to play, she had a Sprite for it, but she wasn't accessible to buy because as I've made no, uh, no secret of this, my favorite Marvel character is Jessica Jones because she's bad-ass. Um, so anyway, I played through the whole first mission as Scarlet Witch and it was just like a not quite as fun version of Marvel Ultimate Alliance and I would rather play Marvel Ultimate Alliance. I'm going to check. I want to check out this Marvel Heroes game. I just, I was busy this past week, so I didn't get a chance to check it out, but I want to... It wasn't bad. I'm going to say it wasn't bad, but it wasn't enough to make me want to spend any amount of money on it. I mean, I might play it a little bit more. I've got Scarlet Witch. She's pretty cool. I almost picked Hawkeye because, you know, Hawkeye, but I went for her. You just wanted to stare at his booty. No, I'm, you know what? That's objectification, Robin. I take exception to that. Um, but, uh, it was all right. It was all right. And as a male, I am totally okay with the objectification of Hawkeye. Just saying. Well, if it's Jeremy Renner, then yeah. Um, no, but at any rate, um, I also, I, as I have said, I am back to play Mass Effect, the first one. Um, Dramamine does not work, Rob. And I will tell you why I actually had Dramamine is because I got it from my trip to Alabama and I decided to take Dramamine for my first Mako mission. And it did not help. I was nauseous in five seconds. And then, um, yes, Claire, Claire, it's because it's Jeremy Renner. I think he's pretty, um, and intelligent, and intelligent, um, but, uh, uh, what was I saying? Oh yeah. Um, so I actually, uh, I have a high res mod. Well, it's really, you have to sort of manually mod your INI files yourself and then use text mod for the high resolution textures. And I figured out that why my game kept shutting down is because it didn't have, um, uh, there's like a little program you can run to make it accept, um, higher, uh, memory usage, which I mean, I've got a card that, you know, gives me two extra gig of VRAM, so I don't know what's going on, but I ended up, uh, getting that working and, uh, it was, uh, it was pretty good. And I actually, I can tell you this, that I don't get as sick as I did with some of the higher res textures. So I'm pretty much just running through the game and trying to get all the stuff I missed. I'm actually also doing a different background than what I used to do because I always used to do either a colonist or a spacer, but I would always do soul survivor and now I'm doing a war hero, which is, it kind of changes up a few things, you know, you don't have to deal with the hyperventilating, uh, slave girl and you'd still deal with a major asshole. I'm sorry, Admiral asshole. Um, the only thing I do, and I will give this as a flat warning for anyone who uses the texture replacement is it does mess up anyone wearing the dress blues because it will change a texture to white and the hands to white, which is really bizarre. But other than that, it's, it's super nice. Everything looks beautiful. And um, God, I was playing something else too, and I don't remember what it was. I don't remember what it was. We'll come back to you if you think of it. Oh, Dan is really irritated with grid two. Why? Because he says that it does, that the collision detection in that game is just really shit. I haven't played it. Well, you know, he has that driving. Oh no, I know he loves his driving rig. He's he's a, he's a manly man. Yeah. All right. Loki, how was your gaming week? Uh, unfortunately I did not play, I don't think anything actually. Uh, I, yeah, it's just, uh, the boss has been out all week, so they haven't played any Call of Duty and uh, I didn't really play anything in the video. I was working on my laptop for most of the week and then my laptop broke, so then I had to fix my laptop. So I've been busy with that. So um, yeah, I did buy the, uh, the serious Sam bundle thing that they have on the humble bundle weekly thing. So that was kind of cool. So we'll play some of that soon and um, just watch the Watch Dogs trailer for E3, the E3 trailer. It looks fantastic. I can't wait for that game. Hmm. So that just released tonight? Uh, it leaked out. Yeah. Nice. All right. Anything else? Uh, that is it. Uh, I'm only really going to talk about one new game. Uh, I, uh, was in Phoenix for a lot of the week for the day job, so that kind of kept me away from most of my games besides iPad and portable games I've talked a lot about on the show. My random game to play on the airplane, thank heavens for the Game Boy Advance games and the NES games and all that on the 3DS for the early adopters, Mario Kart Game Boy Advance. I don't know why it actually is one of the weaker Mario Kart games, just control wise and everything, but, uh, I just, just, I was like, I want to unlock the special cup. So I did it. Anyway, uh, the real game I've been playing a bit of at least the past couple of days is Animal Crossing New Leaf. It's the 3D version of Animal Crossing that just came out. Um, what can I say? It's Animal Crossing. Some of the differences though, uh, I noticed that they put a lot of the stores that used to be sprinkled throughout your town, not really the mall thing like the Wii did, but there's a other side of the tracks now, like a main street where all the, like the nooks, the Abel sisters, the, uh, Tom Nook, who's the, now the realtor, cause he gave the convenience store to his kids and, uh, some other stuff is, uh, all that stuff's on the other side of the tracks. The museums there too. So it's kind of neat to have kind of everything in that one place that really opens up your town to have a little bit more of your design when it comes to the trees and the flowers and all that. Um, all the online experience is pretty much similar to what I noticed in the previous games. You open up your train gates and people can come visit. In fact, I should open mine up and see if anyone comes to visit. Uh, and then you can, uh, close them when you're ready for people to get out. Uh, so a lot of that hasn't changed. Um, but I know they brought the island back and there's a lot more fruits available thanks to the island. Um, some of the other things I noticed is that the story is a lot different because now you're the mayor. Uh, so you have an assistant, Isabella, who kind of helps you, or I'm assuming everybody has the same one. I don't even know. Uh, but she kind of helps you through some of the earlier stages of the game. And yes, it is still about paying off bell debt, but you know, animal crossing kind of still remains that game. It's kind of like the Facebook game that you don't have to have a lot of deep shame to play cause you know, it doesn't have all that like click to invite all your friends. But um, it's just kind of fun to grow your little neighborhood and interact with the people. And then the online element, uh, provides a lot of fun with that. And it's 35 bucks since it's a handheld game, not 60 like a lot of console games cost. So I think that's priced pretty good. Sometimes you just want to do a little bit of fishing, donate it to the museum, make some bells. It seems like a lot of people I know are getting animal crossing and that's, I think the real fun in it is just, you know, trading the fruits and writing nasty letters to somebody else's villagers and hoping they don't get too mad at what you're saying and all that. So, um, yeah, I'm happy with my purchase of animal crossing, but, uh, I think most people kind of know already what to expect with this. Don't expect like a, a total reinvention of the franchise. Um, but I wouldn't say it's as simple as, Ooh, now you can sit on a bench too. There's a little more to it than that. They, they did a little more design with it. Um, it feels like a different game, especially if you put like the original GameCube game next to this game. You can really see how this series has evolved. All right. Uh, anyhow, let's get into a quick housekeeping. Um, I mentioned this earlier in the show, but do keep an eye on this week, e3.vognetwork.com. It is our interactive E3 experience at the voice of geeks network. That's going to be led by a VOG networks, Bobby Black Wolf, who will be on the, uh, the show floor at E3. And he will be getting answers to your questions because once Bobby's, you know, done these appointments and played some of the games, he wants to see what you guys want to hear about. But, uh, you know, all we ask, don't ask the obvious things that are already in the press releases and don't ask about this stinking Xbox used game thing because, you know, we all know they're not going to comment further on it, but you know, maybe there's a game that you're not hearing enough about because all this new gen stuff is hogging the spotlight. Maybe there's something else you want to hear more about. You have a question about, maybe you're a very passionate fan of, I don't know, tech in and you want to hear more information about to, although I don't think Namco Bandai has a booth. I don't remember, but you know, whatever it is, you want to hear more about it. Uh, go take a look at e3.vognetwork.com and has all the information you need. Question submissions open up after the Sony press conference tomorrow when we're really going to know where things stand. Okay. Um, we'll hear from Bobby Black Wolf on that a little more later because we are going to have a list list later tonight. Uh, the thing we most want to see happen at e3 2013 that'll be in part B later in the show. But first let's run through through some gaming news and Loki start us off. All right. So there is a rumor going around that, um, GameStop is discontinuing the Wii U basic after June 18th. And um, basically, you know, the rumor comes from that they've been getting it like there's an internal email saying that they're going to be, um, sending back all the, you know, basic units and that kind of stuff. Also um, Nintendo's followed up with this saying that there's current, a current misperception about the Wii U hardware to clarify Nintendo is working with its retail partners to simply rebalance the stock of white eight gigabyte systems and black 32 gigabyte Wii U models in the market. Consumers looking for either model will continue to find them available. It doesn't make any sense to me, but okay. Um, then of course there's a follow up to that where, um, another retailer was saying that they received an email, um, that they're going to be recalling all the eight gigabyte systems. I think if anything, this has to do with the fact that they're talking about, um, putting out a white, you know, um, made three, two gigabyte system. I'm wondering if they're just going to get rid of the eight gigabyte system altogether because maybe that's not as popular. Um, I know a lot of people that buy Wii U's at least, you know, as far as my customers are concerned, not a lot of them. Who's buying the basics? Not a lot of people. They want the pack in game. They want the stuff that comes with the deluxe. I wouldn't be, I wouldn't blame Nintendo at all if they're phasing the basics out of the market. And I think if the 18, the 18th coincides well with, you know, being after E3, so maybe we'll get an announcement and that's my fingers. My re my real hope is that they're getting rid of the basics because they're going to drop the price of the deluxe is down to where the basics are. That would be phenomenal news and what a great opportunity for Nintendo to kick their competition in the balls while all this other talk about, you know, the usage restrictions and all this is going on. Nintendo could really strike them in the jugular and you might still hate everything that Nintendo has to offer, but you got to recognize that there's going to be a lot of people that are here for Mario Kart and, and Mario and all this wouldn't be that hard for them to refurbish all those old systems to pop that eight gigabyte storage chip off there and put three gigabyte chip there in place. Yeah. So it wouldn't be that hard. Some could very well could happen. Alan alchemy in our chat room at live.vog network.com says eight gigabytes is just an embarrassingly insufficient amount of memory by today's standards, period budget console or no. That's very true. It's not a lot. So Nintendo has got to catch up, but don't catch up too much to what else is going on in the world. Uh, moving on to other news out of E3, uh, Square Enix mentioning what they're going to be showing at their E3 booth. Sometimes things get left off of this, but, uh, you know, I'll, I'll, uh, say what there is so far. Kingdom hearts, 1.5 remix on PlayStation three final fantasy 14, a realm reborn, uh, which makes sense. Cause I believe beta three starts next week comes out in August. Yeah. So they're, they're counting down there. They've also changed restrictions on the beta stuff. Yes. NDA is lifted. So, but still no, um, you're not allowed to say anything on the previous betas. Okay. Well, all I got to tell you is next OLR, no live streaming next OLR. We got a lot to say. Realm reborn, uh, lightning returns final fantasy 13 being shown off, which I believe also a release date got spotted on a banner and it's February 14. Yeah. Uh, final fantasy 10 and 10, two HD remaster for the Vita and PlayStation three deus X human revolution director's cut for Wii U and thief. Another big title on its way. Now, um, there are rumors that there could be something additional there as well. Apparently the future of final fantasy being teased for Tuesday, June 11th, nine AM, uh, rumors and rumblings suggesting it's final fantasy 15, uh, whether that is what 13 verses has been put through a remodel and that's now 15 or maybe this news is just 13 verses. No, it's going to be something new for the PlayStation four and the, probably the Xbox one, because remember the PlayStation four of it, they showed the same fucking trailer that they had before and they're like, and we'll have more to announce that E3, you know, so it's, it's going to be something new for next gen. It's probably going to be using their new engine that they have. It is sad to me though. The dragon quest 10 just probably isn't going to happen over here, is it? I was kind of hoping that maybe they would announce Saturday three, but that maybe they were just going to solely back Wii U. I really wish they would try with dragon quest 10, but let's try the dragon quest series does have a following. It sure does. And sure, the following is bigger in Japan, but to write it off here, I don't know. Maybe dragon quest nine didn't sell well enough. I also remember they had dragon quests, uh, monsters or whatever that are the one that they came out over here. That was the Wii game. That was first person that did not do well, so all right, moving on. Quest swords. That's what it was. Yeah. Well this, this is purely rumor. Okay. So I'm just going to go ahead and spit it out there. Allegedly stuff. Um, there is a rumor going around that Microsoft has been paying off, uh, third party developers not to show off anything for PlayStation four either on stage or at their booths that Microsoft has resorted to paying them off for this. Now I don't know if this is true or not, but the, um, the report came from a source on Neogaf that's done a lot of true. Here is your nice big salt lick. Exactly. To go with this. Exactly. But it did come from someone who in the past has been reliable. Well this now, this would put way in the column of maybe Sony isn't in the same camp as Microsoft because otherwise it's, what are you so afraid of Microsoft? Well, the whole point is that the theory is that if this is really what's going on, the Microsoft is trying to give the illusion that they're going to have more games available than the PS4 will. Which would make them look more attractive. And it's not that Microsoft and Sony haven't bought, you know, struck at each other financially before. I mean, what, uh, Microsoft got a lot of DLC agreements. Uh, Sony got the whole, uh, valve tie in portal. Like everybody bought portal two on PlayStation three because everything, well, not everybody, but a lot of people did because of, you know, their agreements with valve and steam integration, which was really good. I got mine on steam. Yeah. Well, you got, you bought it. It was a gift, but still. Well, you bought it on PS3 and you got it on both. No, I didn't. You did, but I mean, I didn't care about it on PS3 at all. I got it on, on windows. So paying for exclusives and paying off for stuff like that, that's not really, but it's just in light of everything else going on in the gaming industry is what makes a lot of people kind of leech onto this news is, Ooh, yeah, well, and it could just be something that was thrown out there for the purpose of, uh, you know, making Microsoft look bad too. But at the same time, they don't need a Neo GAF thread to do that. I don't know that at this point that I would put anything past, past them right now, especially since this type of shit goes on all the time in the corporate world. So saying, but isn't it weird how Microsoft and Sony would have had to agree to this thing. And then now they strike at each other in corporate warfare and these other ways. It's really, it's kind of sick in some ways. Welcome to corporate America. Well, welcome to the world corporation. I know, I know, I know, but I'm saying it's business and in the end what people, what companies most care about is their bottom line and they will do what they can to increase it. End of story. Loki. All right. Um, so let's see, let's talk a little bit about plants versus zombies. And um, you may remember they had an announcement for plants versus zombies too. It's about time. Well now there's some actual, uh, banners being spotted at E3 showing plants versus zombies garden warfare. I am excited. Which is, um, rumors to be true. I think they were saying that it's a multiplayer first person shooter game. So I am no longer excited. Well, there's still the plants versus zombies too. I'm excited about that. The first person shooter? No. Yeah. I remember, I remember actually hearing about that before, so it'll be interesting to see what that's like. I'm thinking maybe a little bit like that Batman, um, what was it? The uh, the uh, Batman game that they had on the Xbox live arcade, uh, Gotham imposter or yeah, that one, Oh, the Gotham kids or something like that. I don't like it. Yeah. It's like, uh, somebody in chattel yell it out. I don't remember. Anyways. Um, Oh, neat. I guess we'll have to, you know, hear about it on, uh, during E3 or EA's press conference. I guess they're going to have that on Monday. So I'm watching all of those. That'd be fantastic. And yeah, me too. You want to hear something kind of funny off topic here a little bit. Um, I was looking on new gap just a second here. Um, they put out a reminder that there was this thing that leaked last year. Remember about their kind of a game plan. Yeah. And, uh, the, the actual marketing position that they had on, uh, their, you know, for 2013 is this one box input one. So that, that's the same slogan that they have at E3 now. So playing a little bit more to maybe that was legitimate. Yeah. Huh? It's always nice when those rumors end up being true a year after the fact, right. In retrospect, Oh, we could have known all along if we would just believe this one rumor. Well, it still shows through 2015. So, you know, I guess we'll have to see, you know, what that's all about. Uh, Akuma JP in our chat room with a very interesting comparison. We were talking earlier, the whole corporate warfare with, um, Sony and Microsoft Akuma JP in our chat says, look at Apple and Samsung. That's another good comparison because those two, they have to work together for some things, but then they're at each other's throats with courts and lawsuits and everything. It's, um, fascinating how that all works. Okay. Here's if, if that member of that whole thing, uh, the, you know, PDF that came out last year. So here's what the next game plan then would be for to Zilla glasses, digital glasses that allow you to see 3d objects in your living room. That's augmented reality stuff. So that's going to be next year, apparently according to the roadmap. What about the alumina room? When's that supposed to be a thing next year too, I think. Hmm. Hmm. Interesting. All right. Um, moving on, I talked earlier in the show about animal crossing and I know one reason everybody loved the game cube version of animal crossing. And some people arguably say it's their favorite is because it had all the classic NES games in it. Remember how you could play punch out and clue clue land and all these Nintendo games in animal crossing. Well, this will probably be a bit of a duh, but in an interview with the Katsuya Eguchi, um, he basically, and this is an interview, uh, that he had out there, he said that please consider it's not happening ever again in regards to virtual console at the time of animal crossing on the game cube, we didn't have a virtual console system. We thought the playing games inside of a game is kind of funny and we wanted to do it, but now there's a virtual console where you can play classic games. So we don't think we'll be doing that in future titles. So kind of confirmation that, yeah, they're not going to bring those NES games back in the other systems and it's really virtual console's fault because they can make money selling those games separately. However, part of the reason I want to bring this up is because when I was reading this article on destructoid.com who ran with this article, I really liked an idea that was proposed. Now I wanted to kind of put this out there by the author of destructoid.com who said, uh, there's more that could be done to appease those looking for retro flavor in a new animal crossing adventure. A nice compromise would be to include some special eight bit animal crossing themed games in the next entry of the series. Um, in the game cube title, tortimer might give you a fake NES game called super tortimer on April 1st. What if super tortimer were playable, a little 10 minute long platformer starring a turtle mayor and maybe a few other fake but fun lo-fi NES on animal crossing mini games. And I'm like, I love that idea. That's a fantastic, fantastic idea. Like what, you know, just silly little flash games to be collectible. I think that would be a great thing for the series granted, you know, it's going to be a lot of development costs and somebody's got to design all that design as a contest. You have a bunch of indie dev. I was just a crowdsource the fucker. You just have a bunch of indie devs just creating a bit shit for it and you could even market that as a reason to buy the game, but I don't know. I just don't see Nintendo as somebody who would, uh, crowdsource like that. You know what I mean? But yeah, that would be awesome. Too bad. Oh, you know, Nintendo, if you're thinking about that Wii U version of animal crossing, here's a, Oh, Oh, this could, this could really bring a lot of people back. Or just, you know, maybe just give us, you know, those NES games. Cause come on, you've already made your money back and then like, who the fuck's going to buy clue clue land. Let's be real. It wasn't that good. Donkey Kong math or who's going to buy that shit. Come on. Um, what you would buy donkey Kong math. No, but I have picked up a copy of clue clue land when I saw it at the store. You're a nerd though. Shut up. I have memories of clue clue land. Don't, don't judge me. Uh, while I are in chat says, but I do have to buy a third party hack this to unlock them all this time. Um, yeah. Cause remember super Mario brothers and Zelda were in the original animal crossing, but you couldn't get them without a code. Like they were never actually given out. You had to get, you had to code them to do it, uh, or, or use the link from Hyrule website that was big back in the day where everybody had the same character name. So you could just gift yourself all this stuff. Pretty funny. Um, what else do I want to say with that? Uh, Oh, here's one other thing I would say is that if they do these whole like little flash games that they put inside animal crossing, they could almost one up virtual console. And like, how about little achievements within animal crossing and leaderboards within animal crossing. Suddenly animal crossing is what we all thought PlayStation home was going to be. Think about it. Womp, womp. All right. Anyway. Well, how about, uh, something that's a little bit happier, Rob? Okay. Um, how about something that has nothing to do with Nintendo? I don't know if that's going to be happier this week. Nintendo is kind of my, my safe room. Nintendo is my safe word this week. Remember if it gets a little bit too hard for you, just say PlayStation. Uh, this actually has to do with, um, an exclusive for PS3 that will be, uh, launching on Tuesday. Tekken revolution is going to be on PS3. It will be free to play. And you know, me and my Tekken, I worked for Namco. I remember Tekken three and trying to predict who the next character would be. So I have to say that. And trying to predict who the next character would be. So I have special, special love of, of anything Tekken. Especially anything that has a Jin Kazama in it. Yeah, but isn't this just going to be the dumb trading card game? You know what? It says, um, that, uh, basically it's going to be, I'm trying to see what it says. It's going to be, uh, yes. Being, um, referred to as a new version of Tekken card tournament, which you know, it's funny. I even had the stupid Tekken card game on the wondrous one. So I will go to links to play anything Tekken. So I'm just saying, don't judge me. At least this one's free. Yeah. I like free. Who doesn't? Especially cause I'm broke. Well, if you hate free and you want to buy something this week. Get the X bone. If you hate freedom, buy an Xbox one. No, uh, seriously, what is coming out this week around the world? US first Loki. Nothing really. Um, well one game, the last of us on Friday. On Friday. Arguably a big fucking game. Yeah. Great reviews, but Friday? What? Well, you know, got to get down on Friday. I guess, you know, they want to make sure. Got to get down to Disneyland. Want to make sure that it isn't released on Tuesday with all that, you know, E3 news getting, you know, lost in the shuffle there. So, all right. Well, traveling to Japan and seeing if there's anything additional this week. Um, not so much on the PlayStation 3. PlayStation 3 is looking pretty empty this week. Xbox 360. You'd be surprised. There is a game on Xbox 360 this week. It's called Giga Force and Esketos Wonder Pack. I don't know if that's just like the combination, like a combination two for one thing. Yeah, it is definitely a two for one pack. I'm looking at the box art. These look to be 3D spacey shooter games. Like, uh, mechs. Oh, it's, is this? Oh, it's got classic games in there too. I see. Judgment, Silver Sword, Cardinal Sins. If you're a SHMUP fan, this might be the compilation for you. That is out on the Xbox 360 this week. Is it just me or does Xbox 360 get so many SHMUPs over in Japan? Like, it's the SHMUP console. Oh, that's good to know. Yeah, but especially, uh, bullet hell games? Please. Uh, looking at the other systems. Sadly, not a lot this week. 3DS is really the only other thing that's seeing some releases. Donkey Kong Returns makes its way to Japan this week. And, uh, there's a Nintendo metallic red 3DS to match. Also, one other game from Square Enix this week. Chusoku Henkai Gyro Zetter, Albatross no Tsubasa comes out this week. And this is... Wings of the Albatross? Yes, it looks like another mech fighting game slash role playing game type thing. Aren't Albatrosses usually associated with bad modical things? Maybe they're mechs that swim, Dark Sakura. I don't know. I don't think Albatrosses can swim. I think they just die and hang around your neck. Speaking of dying and hanging around your neck, I'm done with the Japanese game releases this week. Well, we have a few things for the UK. On the 11th, we have Tekken Revolution, as I brought up earlier. On the 12th, we have Xenoclash on the Xbox 360. And on the 14th, Animal Crossing 3DS, Chemical Spillage Simulation for PC, which actually just sounds hilarious without knowing anything about it. And then The Last of Us on PS3. That's it. Stick a fork in it, speaking of dead things. Okay, um, let's see. There is some interesting controversy with this game, Vampire Smile, which was one of those, well, it originally started off as the Dishwasher, one of the first Xbox indie games that they showed off. Actually, I think while they were introducing indie games, or what did it used to be called? Community games? Way back in the day? Anyway, so the sequel to Dishwasher, the Vampire Smile, was coming to PC. But originally, the first way it came to the PC was a hacker, I guess a developer, Barbarus. He really wanted to see the game come to PC, so he cracked a version of it and uploaded it, I guess, to the internet. And so he kind of ported it to PC. Well now, it's actually coming officially to PC as well, because they weren't too happy with the fact that he cracked the game and stuff. So, new Director's Cut is going to have some enhancements to the game and some more... That's not a good precedent to set, though. Like, you know, hack our game and we'll put it on the console you want. They didn't remember, was it Sonic Generations? They had the Sonic... The hell is the crappy one with the werehog? They had all the daylight missions from that game. Ask this one. I don't know, I can't tell all those Sonic games apart. She can. Which Sonic game? Sonic Unleashed, I think it was. I hadn't played that one. Yeah, Sonic Unleashed, they had the daytime levels from that ported over to Sonic Generations for the PC, because it never came out on PC. I do have Sonic Generations and I haven't even played it yet. To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, TICKET. To answer a code, man, I don't acknowledge that in my universe. What? Acknowledge what? Don't have a one-sided conversation here. Kiefer Sutherland. Hey, that's coming up later in the show. Stop spoiling things. I know. Stop spoiling it. I still don't like thinking about it. Spoiler. Alright. You know what, Rob? What? No spoilers here. This is news. This is about Starcraft 2. I will admit this is the one Blizzard franchise I don't play a lot of. I owned the very first game, I didn't bother with the expansion. But, apparently, I may not need it. Because there's a new system in Starcraft 2 that Blizzard did this week called spawning. And I thought that meant maybe a new enemy unit. Isn't that what zergs do? They spawn a lot of zergs. But, anyway, what happens is you get free access to gameplay features when somebody who doesn't own a certain version of the game parties with someone who did. So, in other words, when you go into multiplayer, you play the most current version of the game owned by at least one person at the party. So, if you have the free starter edition, but you come play with me and I have Starcraft 2 basic edition, we're now both playing Starcraft 2 basic edition. So, that's kind of cool. That's like DS1 cartridge play or something like that. If I party up with somebody playing Heart of the Swarm, we both get to play Heart of the Swarm. It's been rolling out globally since June 4th when this was announced. I don't know what regions do and don't have it at this time, but this is something that is planned for everybody. So, that's kind of awesome, actually. Because if you have a core group of four friends that you just want to do nothing but play Starcraft with, maybe one of you is a big Starcraft nerd, but the others aren't so much, one person buys the game, everybody mooches off it, and you just don't play otherwise. That's kind of cool. Yes. It's almost like if you had a game and then you load it to their friends, and then they got really excited about the game and bought the sequel and it came out at launch. Oh, we can't have that. We can't. We can't do that. It cuts into developer money. To be fair, although I love your tongue-in-cheek point there, let's not forget Starcraft 2 does require an always-online connection just because that's the nature of the game. You're right, because the PC marketplace is completely different than the console marketplace. Because they don't require an online connection there either. Can we go back to a time when there wasn't any of this always-online bullshit? Although I will say, I do love my MMOs. I do love me my MMOs. However, I also love classic games, and that's why every week on the show, DarkSakura jumps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey, kids, play this game or I'm going to cut you. I cut you off with my razor-sharp wit. DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week this week? Star Gladiator. Or as it was called over here, Star Gladiator Episode 1 Final Crusade. Yeah, Episode 1 Final Crusade. What's up with that? Okay, so anyway, it came out in 1996. It was a 3D fighting game done by Capcom for the PlayStation. Well, actually for the ZN1 arcade, which was basically a glorified PlayStation. It was their first polygon fighting game. It actually came out before Street Fighter EX, so this was kind of a big thing for them. It was a pretty neat little game, I mean, as far as a 3D fighter goes. It didn't use the six button thing. It used a four button configuration. It was a lot like how the Soul Edge and Soul Calibur games went. You had a 3D plane. You could do ring outs. It was that type of game. It wasn't really anything that was special as far as 3D fighting games at the time, but the fact that it was Capcom's first makes it notable. It also had these things called plasma reverses that are guard moves that you have to release at a particular point in time in the battle, where it will enable you to deflect an incoming move and stun them so that you could actually attack in reverse. It also does extra damage as well. It also had a combo system so that you could basically just pummel people to death. In the arcade mode, it was ten fights, and depending on who you chose as your character, you had a specific set of opponents that you would fight. It was actually a pretty good game. You see some notable characters in there that showed up in other Capcom games, like Hayato showed up in Marvel vs. Capcom 2, and he had an appearance in Tatunoko vs. Capcom in the Tekkaman Blade ending, which actually kind of made me giddy at the time. And there was Jun, who was also in the background stages of Gem Fighter, and in Capcom vs. SNK 2, and in one of the wind poses of Hayato in Marvel vs. Capcom 2. And she was also in Hawkeye's ending in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 as a member of the West Coast Avengers, which, actually, that was pretty crazy, because I beat that game with him. There was Saturn Dyer, Gamoth, Gogri, Franco, Garrett, Vector, Rim Gal, who was Jun's dad. There's a bunch of people in the game, anyway. It was a really neat game in that it used both English and Japanese voice acting for the characters. And it also spawned a Dreamcast game that was called Plasma Sword, Nightmare of Bliss, which is actually me finding my Dreamcast copies, what made me think of the PlayStation version. But it was a really neat game. I mean, for all of the stuff that it did, it may not seem a big deal today, but when it came out, I thought it was a really cool game. So, Star Gladiator, you win Classic Game of the Week. I have to admit, I didn't know a lot about this game until I'm kind of watching the, as with a lot of these classic games you pick. I didn't know a lot about this one, but I'm watching it and I'm like, wow, this looked pretty good for a PlayStation 1 game. It looks a little more Dreamcast level to me. Is it late PS1? I'd say it was late PS1. But you should see Star Gladiator was actually a really fun little fighter. It had its issues just about with any PlayStation 1 game at the time, but you should really see Plasma Sword because that was really fun, too. This character here, June, I really like her, too. With the chakram? Yeah, well, she reminds me of that chicken Soul Calibur, Tina, I think it is, with a similar feel, the big disc. And actually, that's who I played this game most with was June. But you should, one of these days we'll have to hook up the Dreamcast and I'll bring over Plasma Sword. I have a Dreamcast. So do I. In fact. But I have Plasma Sword and I will bring it over. This is why I need to get game streaming on my TV because we need to do some classic NES game streaming through the Dreamcast emulation. Good times. That would be wrong, but funny. All right, there it is, the classic game of the week, Star Gladiator. Star Gladiator. Oh, actually, I need to point out, Cleric Player 404 did remind me. She's using the combo attack of Chun-Li and Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo. Who was? June. Really? Yes. I don't remember that. Well, there were cosplay. I mean, not that I believe you, but I'm just... There were costume combos, remember? Where people would dress up as different... Oh, yeah. And like, I think one of Ibuki's was like the Miko costume and Sakura had a bunch of different ones and one of Chun-Li's was June. All right. From Star Gladiator. All right. Very cool. All right, we got plenty more show to go here. Coming up with Part B tonight, we have a list list coming up tonight. Few surprises in store with list list tonight. That's all I'm going to say. You are definitely going to want to be here live for this. Sorry to the podcasters in advance. Very cool live feature tonight. And the Fugu question of the week as well. And rapid fire news, the mailbag, FUs of the Week, and your calls at 1-877-GAMO-LR and username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio. All when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio. Hi there. This is Flaco Jones and you're participating with Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice. And I want to use my voice to tell you you should all play Ni No Kuni. It's great. Rob, you should beat Ni No Kuni. And now that I said it in the bumper, you have to beat Ni No Kuni or you have to play this bumper forever. Looks like I'm playing the bumper forever because I still haven't beat Ni No Kuni. You can lend me your copy then. You want to hear a true story? I came in the other day, Ni No Kuni. I came back from Phoenix. My copy of Ni No Kuni is on the floor and I'm like, oh, it's on the floor. That means Alan must have picked it up and started playing it at some point, right? And he said, oh, no, I used it to put kitty treats on. Can I borrow it, though? Yeah, if you're actually going to play it, then yes. I will. Okay, I think you'll like it, actually. So, yes, you may borrow it. I'm fun employed. I think Flaco would approve of that. Yes, we did recycle a message this week. That means we could use some new bumpers. I did get one today, to be fair, so I'll put that in for next week. But if you want to submit a bumper as well, you can get all the information at the Voice Geeks Network, voggenetwork.com. Click on forums and look at the OLR forum. It's right there at the top in a sticky thread how you can get your voice in a bumper on the show. And you can tell the listeners whatever you want, within reason. I even did one in not that great Japanese, but thanks to Kuma JP for correcting my grammar. Oh, I'm talking about the ones that, not the ones that play on the network, but the ones that bring us back here. But I'm planning on actually doing one. But you're on the show. I can do a bumper. No, you can't. Yes, I can. Do a bumper for Bobby's show. I'll do one for Bobby. I'll do one for Bobby that says, hey, listen to this show, dammit. Hey, hey, listen, hey, listen, hey, listen. But I have to make it high-pitched. Hey, listen. Anyhow, plenty more to come here on this half of Orange Lounge Radio. But first, some rapid-fire news. Let's take care of a lot of news this week in rapid-fire news. Yes, so it sort of leaked out, and then it got announced, Halo Spartan Assault. It's coming out for all your favorite gaming platforms, including Windows 8 PCs, tablets, and phones. And those are Windows 8 devices, by the way. Windows Phone, Surface tablets. Yeah, and apparently it's going to be set between Halo 3 and 4, and is a twin-six shooter. So, totally the title you're looking for. There's some free-to-play games coming to the PlayStation 4. PlanetSide 2 and DC Universe Online have both been confirmed for the PlayStation 4, although I'm not surprised because it's Sony Online, so you know. Those are Sony Online games. But somewhere I hear Brad from PodCulture squeeing about the DC Universe Online. Just call it a hunch. Yeah. If his internet's back up. So, those will both be coming out. And also, Warframe is going to be coming as well as a free-to-play title. And, yeah. So, I guess we're going to see a lot of free-to-play games on PlayStation 4, so that could be good or bad. I don't know. Free-to-play is not... I like that business model, so we'll see. You like free? I like free, yeah. It's awesome. Do you think there will be a lot of free games on Xbox One? I think there's got to be some. That's the world we live in now. I'm just wondering if there's going to be any MMOs on Xbox One, because remember, there wasn't really much on, you know, the Xbox 360, aside from Final Fantasy. And I guess, you know, there's some pay-to-play MMOs, you know, like the Defiance and stuff, but none like actual traditional MMOs beyond Final Fantasy XI. Don't know. So, it'll be interesting. And last but not least, new Harmonix title was announced last week, and that was Fantasia Music Evolved. And I saw the trailer, and I'm like, that has very little to do with Fantasia. Here's the thing. I love Harmonix. I love Disney. Do we get Elephants and Tutus? Maybe, actually. I love Harmonix. I love Disney. I hate Bruno Mars. Why was that in the trailer? But, but, but. Why? But, they're going to have pop music. They're also going to have- That's not Fantasia. But they're also going to have the classical music as well. And Bohemian Rhapsody is going to be in it. Anything with Queen is instantly better, yeah. Queen is one of the artists, you know, confirmed. Instant fantasticness. Just add Freddie Mercury. Here's the tracks announced so far. Does it make him a Disney Queen? So, Bohemian Rhapsody, Kimbra Settle Down. I don't know what that is. Have you- Fun Some Nights. Hold on. Just in case Dark Soccer hadn't seen this yet, I'm playing this in studio, the little teaser trailer for this. Let me skip ahead a little bit. So, basically, it's Sorcerer Mickey mode. Yeah, it's like your, like, Sorcerer Mickey, but it doesn't really, like, tell you what the game is. Like, where's the game here? I'm left to think it's Rhythm Party. It, yeah. It looks like Rhythm Party. Which I said Rhythm Party should have just been a retail release with all the tracks, but whatever. You know what? I don't care, because I don't really like connect games. The thing that's kind of unique, I guess, about it, supposedly, is you can control, like, the tempo of the song, and, like, it changes depending on, like, stuff you do, I guess. So that's gonna be kind of neat. One of the tracks in there, was it AVI- What was it? Black Wolf in chat says, Game trailers actually showed gameplay. It's Elite Beat agents connect. Oh, so it's Rhythm Party. Like I said. And you see this face that no one in the chat room can see? This is my no one curface. I'm willing to give it a shot just because I really love harmonics, and they always put out quality. I love harmonics, but I hate connect games. Fair. And Levels is also one of the songs in there, which, if I remember correctly, I think that's- Let's see here. If I wanted to get up and dance, I'd take a Zumba class. Oh, yeah. Actually, I do like Levels. Levels is awesome because that was one of the songs that was in Forza Horizon, one of my favorite ones on the dubstep thing. So I'm digging it. You know, I think it'd be kind of cool. Harmonics, can't go wrong with them, so. Bobby gave me a link to this, and I hadn't seen it. So, where's the actual gameplay? I just hear a dude talking. Let's see gameplay. Is that Under the Sea? Down where it's wetter. Under the sea. Oh, see, there it is. I guess. Okay, so this is not Rhythm Party. Huh. Alright. It's like- Curious. Put out a demo. It seems like a game that- I want a new Para Para Paradise, then I would play my Kinect. You know what? You know what they really needed to have? Is they need to have Q games and fucking Harmonics come together and do a new Child of Eden type of game, because Child of Eden was fucking awesome. It was pretty good. ClericalEra404 in our chat quickly wants to know, DarkSakura, why do you hate Kinect games? Because usually they show you what you're doing and I don't like to watch myself. Uh, you can sometimes turn camera off. Yeah, if I can turn the camera off, I have no problem with it. Oh, I would have just thought you just don't like the whole flailing around. That's just- Well, I don't mind flailing around as long as nobody else is over. I mean- I was gonna say, to be fair, the original Kinect game's not exactly very accurate a lot of times. Yeah, that was that too. I mean, the only fun I've ever had playing a Kinect game was doing Para Para on Dance Masters, which is why that's still the only Kinect game I will play. Alright, let me move on with some other news. Maybe DarkSakura instead would rather play Injustice. I know she loves DC Universe, but- Do I like DC Universe? No, but apparently Injustice is pretty good. Somebody said Injustice is the best thing going on in DC Universe right now. It was a freaking stupid looking game. Well, there's Mortal Kombat crossover coming to Injustice, which I'm sure will surprise nobody. Scorpion will be the next playable character in Injustice Gods Among Us DLC, 400 Microsoft points or $5, but none for Wii U buy. Why? Why not? Why not? Because they have a whole bunch of other DC superheroes that they could put in the game. Scorpion's a superhero. No, he's not. Now he's like fucking- I'm just trolling. It's like, oh hey, it's Scorpion, but I can't do any of my bloody moves because it's fucking teen rated. That's what happened with the whole Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe. Oh, sorry, I can't behead Batman because it's fucking teen rated. I don't know, whatever. It sounds lame. I honestly did not find the game fun. The end. Also, information on the new Voice of Snake, because a certain co-host of mine didn't ruin this earlier in the show, but Kiefer Sutherland confirmed as the voice of Snake in Metal Gear Solid 5, not David Hayter. Now, I think this was just like buzz earlier. We didn't have confirmation, but now that it's in the trailer, because the Konami whole thing, which we haven't even brought up in the show yet, but Konami had their whole little movie thing come up, and this was part of it. Yeah. So, that's that. So, that to me sounds like the whole situation where, you know, it's the How I Met Your Mother situation where you have, you know, Bob Saget as the narrator. He's supposed to be the father. But yeah, his voice isn't obviously going to change, you know, over the default Ted Mosley voice that, you know, the characters. So, it's just different. All right. And I wonder if we'll ever get a movie, if we'll have, you know, Kiefer Sutherland playing Snake. EA, hopefully giving some final clarity to some of the shady things they've said about the Wii U in the past, courtesy of EA president Frank Gebaux. Now, I'm going to admit, I think we brought up something similar to this last week, but this is coming from EA president of labels. This is somebody else. Quote, we have a good partnership with Nintendo. We released four games on the platform over the last year. We're pretty proud of Need for Speed and Madden and FIFA and Mass Effect. We have guys that are looking at the Wii U and the studio system right now as an opportunity to the future, but we have no publicly announced Wii U games that we're going to release this fall. That does leave the door open to say something at E3, but don't hold your breath. No, they have nothing coming. Don't hold your breath. There's nothing. We're really excited about the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4, and that's a pretty big endeavor in and of itself. I wonder why. We have four titles out on the Wii U that are active right now, so looking at how things unfold, that's where our focus is right now. Gen 3 is an awesome platform. It has a huge audience, it has a lot of capability, and we're going to continue to publish games on Gen 3 for as long as there is an audience there. We have a tendency as a company to support the last gen platforms for many, many years. I can tell you we have products planned for next year, the year after that, and the year after that for Gen 3 for sure. Well, yeah, because they keep pumping out Madden sequels and stuff like that on PlayStation 2 and Xbox up to way past the console's life cycles and stuff, but it doesn't necessarily mean you're going to see big games on there. The honest, blunt way I could say this is that third-party games aren't really what a lot of people go to Nintendo for anyway. I mean, they'll help, of course. I mean, certainly the Sega partnership with Sonic, which is so weird. It's not weird. No, I mean, to the nine-year-old gamer in me when it was Nintendo versus Sega, that is still something I have to be used to. They've done this the last few years with Sonic Colors. They've had a bunch of exclusive Sonic games on the Wii, and they haven't been that great. It's not that weird, but anyway. But it'll have Mario Kart, it'll have Zelda, and there's going to be a lot of people here for that. So, Dark Soccer. I'm sorry, I was just getting out my DC hate out of my system. Can't we all just get along? No, Marvel all the way. Hey, listen, if it's any consolation, Deadpool comes out in a couple weeks anyway. I know! I'm so happy. So happy. So happy. Anyway. Well, how about some other really quick news, okay? Diablo 3. We've seen an announcement before that it's going to be on the PS3 and PS4. They are also bringing it out on Xbox 360, but have no plans to bring it out for any other system. Which is a polite fuck you to Xbone. As I'm still going to call it forever. Honestly, a lot of us have been playing it on PC already, so who cares? And then, this makes me really happy. Is that Hatsune Miku Project Diva F is going to be coming out in North America in August, and I'm gonna get it. There's a demo on June 11th. And I'm so excited because I love the Project Diva games. And then, last but not least, Metal Gear Rising Revengeance. If anyone likes stories about Raiden, well, you get to play more Raiden because it's going to be on PC. The end. They're also bringing, I think, the original Lords of Shadows to PC as well, so that would be interesting. Alright, let's go to the FUGL Question of the Week. Every week, we ask a question of our Facebook and Google communities. You put it together and it's FUGL. We had a fun idea for this week because, you know, E3 really kicks off tomorrow. The show floor doesn't open until Tuesday, but there's a shit ton of press conferences tomorrow. And so, everybody's going to be talking about this tomorrow. So, we thought we would go to Facebook and Google and ask, it's that time of year to ask everyone, what's your E3 predictions? However, we at OLR, we like to do things a little differently and maybe a little bit silly. So, we only want your E3 predictions in a haiku format. That would be five, seven, five, remember? Guess, OLR me, what will occur at E3? Games of win or fail? That was my haiku to the listeners. Loki, you look so impressed. All right, here we go. Some haikus. The Dark Sakura, I want you to count the syllables and tell me who failed. For the record, Rob? There are some fails in here. For the record, Rob? The plural of haiku is haiku. Haikuzis. The haikuza. Let's go to the haikuza. Haikuzersies. You know what? Bite me. Haikugaggle. All right. And all in good fun about those of you that failed, by the way. Edgar R. says, Call of Duty Ghost, Dogs of War, X-Bone exclusive. I think Dogs of War, that's wrong. That's not a haiku, you lose. You lose. It's also already confirmed as an exclusive to the Xbox One. All right. I appreciate the effort. Porkchop, since this entry. I don't really mind as long as they don't release more shit EA games. Bravo. Tiara. All I really care is about, excuse me, I fucked that up, sorry. All I really care about is Dragon Age 3. I love BioWare. No, she loves Anders. She loves her pounce a lot. So she gets a fail for lying. No. All right. Honestly, that's about... She named her cats her pounce a lot. All right. This is from Mason D. Want more Pokemon? Pokemon versus for Wii U. Pokemon get hype. With a big white smiley face underneath that, no less. Blood Drunk submits the following. That's a great name. Blood Drunk. I don't know if Blood Drunk is a newer listener, but I've noticed his name on the VoG leaderboard. So he is a big participant. So a win to you no matter how good or bad your haiku is. Here we go. From Blood Drunk. Connect watches you fap. I think that's six syllables. Connect watches you fap. Six syllables. That's all right. We still like his name. Connect watches you fap. LOL PS4 DRM. Nintendo shows games. All right. Not quite a haiku, but hey. Close enough. It's a haiku-ga. It's a haiku-ger. Degenerate Johnny submits the following. Predicting prices. Xbox. Five bills. Four with subs. Sony 450. Good way to put your predictions in. I think he might be high balling it a little bit, but we'll see. Haseo Sumeruagawa submits the following. Xbox One fucks up. Nintendo might steal the show. PS4 ooh pretty. That was six syllables. That's all right. Liam C submits the following. The Last Guardian. A brand new Uncharted game. Connect flops badly. Good. Code Man says, What will E3 bring? Nintendo surprise maybe? Will has sports. One just got sent to me, which I have to read. Okay. From who? From clerical error 404. Sony has less trust. Nintendo rules us all. But it all ends well. We'll see. We'll see. All right. E to the three. That's four syllables. You lose. No, why can't people count? E to the three. Oh, they didn't. Oh, they done screwed up. He could do E fucking 3-0. All right. Captain Spike. Here's Captain Spike's submission. Yay, Spike. We love Spike. He's full of win no matter if his haiku is fail or not. Here it is. Nintendo no show. Sony and MS hate us all. The worst E3 ever. Worst E3 ever. I love Spike. Here's Hitstun. Next gen consoles? Meh. Nothing PS3 can't do. Game of Show? DuckTales. Ooh. That's a good one. That's my favorite one so far, I think. Did you watch the last trailer they put out? It's the side-by-side. Oh, no, I didn't see that one. They did one comparing the old DuckTales to the new one. Somebody on Tumblr posted it a while back. I'll see if I can't find it but it was pretty neat. Alright, here's SSJ100 Matt Sentry. Anticipation. Elated disappointment. Gamers are winners. Wouldn't that be losers if we're disappointed, though? And I got excited because when he said anticipation it made me think, oh, maybe that's the Rare franchise they're bringing back. Because y'all know I could give two fucks about Killer Instinct or Banjo-Kazooie when Rare could remake Anticipation. Just saying. You know you want to play as the ice cream cone again bouncing around the board. I want ice cream right now. This is from Steven M. What about another cameo? Hell no. Alright, Steven M says like, I had to think about what the fuck game is he talking about? Oh, god. Alright, Steven M. Must be online Xbox. Wii U will die. We finally get Last Guardian. I think you did 557. Andy R. Especially since you gave them how to do a haiku. I put right there, as a reminder, a haiku is 575. We can't read. What's the syllable? We love our listeners. We're just giving you shit. I give everybody shit. We just want to educate you all this week on haikuses. Yeah, study some damn literature. Fuck. Was that a haiku? No, not quite. Alright, Andy R. I'll make one though if you like. You think of one while I read the rest of these. Alright, Andy R says I don't really know. A giant enemy crab? Ridge Racer 2. Ridge Racer 2 is four syllables. Andy, you're killing me. That would have been great for 2006. Alright, lots of answers on Google Plus. We have five answers on Google Plus. I didn't even know there were that many people using it. Oh, come on, come on. ActDeaf says what I want this year is to see really good games and vog to hit big. Somebody kissing a little vog behind in that response. Love it. Thank you, ActDeaf. Flaco Jones says Xbox and Sony, their DRM kills gaming. What's a Nintendo? Okay, I got one. Let me make sure I have it right. We'll do yours last. Forget it. Go. Use the internet. There are haiku examples. There are haiku examples. Okay. Really use Google. Okay. Fuck. Alright, Technus says use some fucking Google. Alright. Technus says people still complain. Rare shows next gen battle toads. Why you still hating? You never know. Retertainment says, oh, it's a double haiku. Ooh. Retertainment's always got to fucking show everybody up. Alright. Here we go. That's okay. I love it. Alright. Retertainment says gamers hate everything. Everything will receive scorn. Twitter will explode. Good one. Gamers will not see a wanted not seen project. The Last Guardian. We got it. Since he did two, we got another one from clerical error. Alright. Let me read this last one from Google Plus. From Travis H. Sony is epic. Xbone will be eaten up. Long live PlayStation. We'll see how that press conference goes. I'm approaching it with cautious optimism Travis. Cautious optimism. Alright. Last but not least. Nintendo has props, but Sony has some issues. I guess we should wait. That one was good. YYR in chat. Can't you people count? You have offended Jamie. Study some damn books. You win the internet YYR. Xbox One console. TV, TV, TV, sports. What's wrong? Deal with it. That's good. Did you do that one by yourself? I just did that one. I love it. I love it. After I posted the question. Use that Mensa thing for something. There you go. Jamie came to me tonight. She said you should make every week be a haiku. Alright. Alright. And SSJ100 Matt bringing some clarity. Anticipation because gamers are anticipating a lot for E3. Elated disappointment because people will be either happy or disappointed. Gamers are winners because no matter what gamers win because we have all these new games to play. Okay. Okay. Alright. Anyhow, I know we gave some of you a bad time, but that was a really fun topic. So thank you everybody for trying. I love you YYR. Alright. Do I need to give you two a moment? No. I don't love you in that way. Alright. Just a few more stories and then list list tonight. But first, Loki. Alright. Code Manner's reminding me that I need to play more Borderlands 2. Because I haven't touched it on PC yet. Even though I finished the game three times on 360. So yes, unfortunately there was some massive lay-offs at Zynga. Also including the closure of OMG Pop. And so they closed the office there. Also they closed the Zynga office in Los Angeles, Dallas, and New York. And I know there was lay-offs I think in all of their offices. I think about five hundred and like five twenty or five forty or something like that. People were laid off. Actually I was reaching out to one of my friends who is a concept artist over at Zynga in San Francisco. I think she's pretty high up though. I don't think she's affected by it. Yeah, that kind of sucks. And of course a lot of horror stories coming out about how things were run and stuff like that. And how they were talking about the terms they use for cloning things. Like taking games like Tiny Tower and turning them into Dream Heights or whatever. I don't know. It's kind of sick to me. So maybe this is the beginning of the end. This is surely not too good for them. Well, I mean I don't like to poke fun or tease or you know celebrate layoffs. Especially like Loki says. He has friends that are at Zynga and so forth. We always knew Zynga had a really questionable business model. And I think people bought into that way too fast. And Zynga expanded way too fast over Farmville. And I think it just goes to show Farmville was kind of a one hit wonder. I hate to say. Some would argue with me that there were other Facebook games and blah, blah, blah. Well, it's like this. When the news came out about them copying games. I mean that was just shitty. Aha had good albums and good music. But the only song anyone ever cared about was Take On Me. That is quite possibly the best possible comparison somebody could have made in this scenario. Because remember I had that thing of Dan singing the lyrics to the synth part with one hit wonder instead of the... By the way before I get to the next news story I just got a text message. And I'll let you guess where this is from Dark Soccer. Are you ready? Alright here's the text message I just got. Haiku game is weak. Sometimes we just can't even. DarkSakura mad. Girl. It's from Allen. I know. I thought that was good. Alright. Let's see going into some news about the Ouya. And some more games coming to the Ouya. Specifically Sonic the Hedgehog 4 and Sonic CD. I'm not surprised. They're going to be coming to the Ouya. You can side load those right now and they work just fine. So why not try to make some money off of it right? Exactly. I got a Moga version. I got my controller free of Sonic CD that plays just fine. Well I mean still though it's Sega support for the Ouya so that's kind of cool. How about some Phantasy Star online? Alright. Maybe that's wishful thinking. They're coming out on June 27th in the Ouya store. $7 each. This is Sonic the Hedgehog 4 episode 1 episode 2 and Sonic CD. No idea if the Ouya version will include fun for Sonic the Hedgehog 4. Because unfortunately that was missing in the earlier versions. Anybody? Alright. The Ouya ports they say are optimized for the console's Tegra 3 processor and free trial versions will be available. Sega of America director of mobile business David Zemke, interesting where this is coming from, was praising Ouya's quote disruptive technology and quote they want to see what these technologies can do and be a part of it from the beginning. We're always looking for other titles and there may be some future titles that we'd like to bring over. For us we're always trying to bring the best gaming experience to the right platforms. It's a delicate mix of how and when to do it. Hmm. That's right after the launch of the Ouya by the way which is June 25th. The day before my birthday y'all. Just saying. Alright. Anyhow. Dark Sakura, one more story and then we'll get into list list tonight. Sorry we were just having a discussion about Turian Smut. Of course. No not really. Something from Double Fine, the game Massive Chalice that basically as they were saying that there was going to be a gay relationship in the game that had been taken out and now the project leader feels shitty because people on Kickstarter say no we want it. So he's putting it in. I guess it had been the intention but it just sort of was taken out. And so now they are putting everything back in and making sure that the people paying for it get what they want. So it's already passed it's $725,000 goal. It's at $857,569 and it has 20 days to go until the deadline. Nope. Less than that now. 18 days? Yeah. Hmm. As of today. Interesting. All that from feedback. That's what you want. We're putting it back in. That's kind of cool though because that makes it seem like Kickstarter really is a place for not to say they're investors or whatever because Kickstarter is the backing or whatever but that they get a say that these people really had a say. Well yeah. I mean if you look at it this way it is probably the best type of board meeting you can ever expect because you've got real time feedback going in. Alright. So I think it's good. Something that you would consider backing or a game that you might think you're going to buy or? I told you what I'm waiting for for my first my first backing. No. What? Well unless he's already put it up I'm waiting for the understanding video games. I don't remember. Can you refresh my memory about this? The seg stewing? Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. There was another name it was though. But yeah he hasn't put it up yet. I'm going to give my Kickstarter cherry to seg. Love, love, love, love. That's a fair place to give your Kickstarter cherry. Alright. I'm trying to get this well we're going to do Listless now except I'm having a little problem with the connection. Let's see if we can get it there. We're going to call an old friend of ours here at Orange Lounge Radio to help us out with Listless tonight and hopefully the internet will hold up. But I think we're connected now. Are you there old friend? Hello. Hey Bobby Blackwolf how you doing? I'm doing good. Rob called you old. Shouldn't he be like old chum? Yes. Oh I'm not Adam West in Batman okay. How you doing Bobby? I'm doing good. I've been playing Animal Crossing since I got off the air. Finally have time to get into that huh? What do you think so far? It's Animal Crossing. I'm very sad because everybody else has this and I don't even have a 3DS so whatever. No because I don't have a job so we're not buying one. You have to have a J-O-B to have a 3DS. You're going to need to get on MTurk. I've even already been in someone else's town so my fruit collection is growing. Wow. Nice I need to go open my gates. But anyhow I wanted to make sure you had a chance. You know our Listless topic tonight is about E3 and we're going to get into that in a minute. But I wanted a chance for the listeners to hear from you because you've worked you know in case our listeners don't know you've worked very hard on the voice of geeks network. The whole thing is really done from the ground up. I mean yeah the template was something we bought but even Dark Sakura heavily modified that template graphically. You have done a lot of programming for the whole VoG game and everything that you announced with E3.Vognetwork.com right? Right and I mean yeah the website I mean PHPBB is the forum software and that handles like the user registration and that's it. Everything else started with a blank file. For any Unix geeks out there I wrote it all in VI so and you know if you don't know what VI is that's fine but if you do know what VI is you kind of know what that means that's like a more hardcore notepad. Yeah I could never use VI I was always about was it Pico or Pine? One was the email. I used Pico. Pine was the mail. Yeah one was email and one was shows you my knowledge of Unix I haven't used it in a while but you coded away in VI this new E3.Vognetwork.com what are you hoping comes of this? I don't know this is me saying this is an idea I have I wonder if it'll work and in the past I've had these ideas and they didn't work and then two years later everybody's doing them so we'll see if this is another one of those. We'll see so be sure to check it out guys if you haven't seen it yet vognetwork.com especially those of you listening on the podcast everything will open up on Monday night for the question and answer but tonight live you can at least watch the video and learn everything you're going to need to know for when everything goes live with the question asking. I've already been given the blacklist against asking anything about Hello Kitty games so I'm not going to do that. Fair enough. Alright so you're leaving for E3 tomorrow right? Correct tomorrow morning. What's your very first appointment? Um Bethesda I think Yeah I think it's Bethesda it's at 2 o'clock that way I can get there and see things from noon to 2 and kind of get my way to land but I think Bethesda at 2. I know we're about to get into the list list here about thing I most want to happen at E3 2013 but seriously off the record what are you personally looking forward to getting your hands on yourself and checking out? Um this is my standard answer and everybody calls it a cop out but I don't care. Oh no I know what you're going to say and I think it's a great answer. It's the game I haven't heard of yet and it's always been that like it was you know Scribblenauts is usually you know the thing I go back to. Nobody had heard of Scribblenauts I never heard of it and it was in the back corner of one of the halls because Warner Brothers had like their booth kind of near a wall and they had this on the side facing that back wall and I went and saw it at the very end it was the last thing I saw on Thursday because somebody else said there's a game called Scribblenauts you should go check it out and it's hidden in the back corner and that was my game of show which pissed off people because you know I should be giving it to a graphically good game and not a DS title at the time and so it's finding those gems you know like that's how I found Katamari Damacy which is the same kind of thing so it's the game I haven't heard of yet I think that is a fantastic answer and I look forward to hearing what that game is when I come see you in person on Thursday at least they'll let me see the Ouya booth alright yeah you're going to get to do the Ouya booth because I don't you know I'm probably not going to get to go in there because I don't want to leave the show floors that's fine unless they like keep it open later and then I'll pop in that's all you dude I'll do the b-roll alright anyway all seriousness though we are going to play Listless here but there's one other reason I have you here tonight and there's been a theme here at VOG Network the past couple weeks and that is that the game is always changing and the game is changing again tonight isn't it Bobby that's right what is new what did you do for us this week I hope you're logged into the site everybody because you no longer have to learn how to private message Rob to play Listless if you've ever done any of the live polls here on VOG then you kind of know where to look that's where you're going to want to look so with that it's time to start some Listless as a reminder for everybody the way Listless works is that we are going to give three answers each host and our special guest Bobby Blackwolf three answers that we believe best meet the criteria of the list and tonight's topic thing I most want to happen at E3 2013 and once everything is up on the list then we will go around and this is what has to happen we have to strike the items that are not worthy of the list it's a very difficult painful process but it must be done remember there is a new rule that is still in play however and that is that when a host has two items eliminated from the list the third gets immunity so a person's list cannot be completely decimated alright here it is the topic thing I most want to happen at E3 2013 let's put it up on the board at live.vognetwork.com for those of you that are logged in right now you will start to see the board and our answers as we fill it in hopefully right Bobby that's also part of the reason you're on the line yes alright I made it live what's that I'm keeping a watch on it oh there it is it just popped up I see it on my screen alright here it is the thing I most want to happen at E3 2013 so Bobby you're our guest why don't you start us off tonight what is the number three thing you most want to see happen at E3 2013 so I'm going to go kind of with an easy answer at first because I'm still having trouble figuring out number one and number two so chat help me out oh yeah if you have an answer you want to submit for inclusion on the list shout them out live.vognetwork.com but I'm going to say the easy answer a new F-Zero you know I think that's a very good safe answer and I think that is one that can't possibly get eliminated no matter what happens of course that's always famous last words yeah thanks for doing that answer alright let's put it up on the board Bobby locks in a new F-Zero alright Dark Sakura what is the number three thing that you want to see happen at E3 2013 like it's probably it won't happen but I would love to have Sega announce that they're back in the console business it won't happen but it's what I want right Sega is back in the console business let's put it up on the board Dreamcast 2 they should call it the Sega Utopia the Sega Utopia okay my turn for a number three answer I'm going to say I'm going to have to figure out how to fit this in the board but my number three answer is the Microsoft server crashes at the show causing all the Xbox ones to stop playing games after Wednesday because you know every 24 hours it's got to check in right so the Microsoft server crashes for 24 hours I guess that's how I'll shorten it alright putting that up on the board right now boy Bobby would be very sad Bobby wouldn't you be sad if like you didn't get to play an Xbox one and then all of a sudden the servers crash for 24 hours but then I'd laugh alright Loki your number three answer just because I want to get this out of the way Microsoft and Sony go back on their plans for DRM it's days the way it is now I love how you threw in and Sony when we don't really know you oh we know let's be honest no one's keying themselves alright fair enough let's put that up on the board Loki says MS and Sony go back on their DRM plans alright Bobby we're to you for your number two answer tonight for listless thing you most want to see happen at E3 2013 I want to see E3 announce that Kensha Hall will be returning next year dammit you stole mine oh really you had that on your list uh oh these things happen you better check the chat room Bobby just threw that up on the board E3 announces the return of Kensha Hall and maybe a new ex tango that goes with that I don't know we'll see alright Dark Sakura what's your number two answer Sony uses Final Fantasy 7 to display an engine without a release of Final Fantasy 7 remake so so basically they're gonna repeat what they did with uh uh PlayStation 3 and show a Final Fantasy tech demo that never happens Final Fantasy tech demo that never results in a game that'd be awesome if it was a new Final Fantasy engine hey yeah it looks like Advent Children nope never gonna get it alright I'm gonna put this up on the board Final Fantasy 7 PS4 tech demo that never is a real game yes I think that should fit within the confines of our shiny new board live.vognetwork.com again if you are listening live on this Sunday night be ready to participate cause you're gonna vote through the site as well live.vognetwork.com I mean granted if Final Fantasy 7 was remade yeah I'd play it but let's be realistic alright uh my turn my number two answer Nintendo announces their plan to win the new generation of gaming by adding porn to Miiverse why not the Miiverse porn channel we call it MiPorn no it's WeWeverse come on that's how you win the console wars alright I'm gonna throw that up on the board porn to Miiverse alright Loki your number two answer Super Mario RPG 2 that'll never fucking happen Loki why though that's such a fantastic game and I'm sorry I understand that there are the Paper Mario games and granted Super Paper Mario was actually a pretty fun game it was actually one of the games I liked the most on the Wii but I would just like it as a sequel you know Square Enix come on that would be awesome alright we'll throw that up on the board alright it's time for the number one answers let's go around and collect them for thing you most want to see happen at E3 2013 Bobby Blackwolf our guest so picture this somehow does some kind of event goes on their own stage press conference everybody's in there Gabe Newell walks out on stage Half Life 3 available right now drops the mic and walks off stage that would win E3 I'm typing that up as Half Life 3 announcement followed by mic drop sound fair release follow mic drop excuse me well let me change an answer I think it will alright Half Life I didn't hit save so Half Life 3

your number one answer well everyone saw this coming the new Mass Effect announced with good writing new Mass Effect announced but with good writing there it is it's up on the board and I totally know what chance are Bobby's going to strike you know what if Bobby touches it I will get nevermind I won't even say it you leave my Mass Effect alone my it's a scientific process Dark Sakura alright my number one answer at least take faith in this Dark Sakura I think you will be okay with this as a backup I know you will because my answer is Bobby doesn't get rid of it too he might my answer is the Guardian Legend 2 on Wii U technically there was a Guardian Legend 2 it's the one that we got in the US shut up that was Guardic 2 you shut up okay fine preferably WayForward would somehow be involved because they're really good at retro said Garris gets his own game that'd be like that would be like a Silent Scope Turian edition alright last but not least Loki one spot left on the board what are you going to put in the list tonight Grand Theft Auto or Saints Row Online an MMO for a sandbox game yeah I know I guess we already have what was that I think that one game they have a free to play MMO right now they're sort of like Sains Row ATB or whatever yeah ATB but it's not that good it's not that same a GTA or Sains Row MMO there it is let's recap before we get to the very difficult part a new F-Zero Sega is back in the console business Microsoft server crashes for 24 hours Microsoft and Sony go back on their DRM plans E3 announces the return of Kensha Hall Final Fantasy 7 Playstation 4 tech demo that it never is a real game Porn to Miiverse, Super Mario RPG 2, Half Life 3 released followed by a mic drop new Mass Effect announced but with good writing The Guardian Legend 2 on Wii U and Grand Theft Auto or Saints Row MMO that's a lot of answers tonight so unfortunately it's getting crowded up here so unfortunately it's time to ask which of these is not worthy of the list Bobby Black Wolf I know you don't want to do it but you're going to have to make one of us mad by eliminating something off the list what's it going to be Porn to Miiverse Bobby you're killing me why are you getting rid of porn though because because the Wii U is a wholesome system think of the children it has been stricken from the list Porn to Miiverse is gone alright who's next Dark Sakura there's the various answers which one of these is not worthy of the list tough one there's a lot of good answers up here yeah there are I'm probably going to have to axe the Microsoft and Sony going back because I don't think Microsoft is going to eliminating it because you're just like it's not happening and we still don't know what Sony's going to say you might want it it's all speculation but you just alright it has been stricken from the list as sad as that is going to make some of you but I understand alright my turn to strike something from the list oh gosh these are all actually really good I don't know I hate to do this Loki but I'm removing Super Mario RPG 2 before you get mad at me people it's the same reason Dark Sakura got rid of hers it's not fucking happening so let's not even get our hopes up so Super Mario RPG 2 I'm sorry but it has been removed from the list but the good news is GTA or Saints Row MMO gets immunity going into the final removal which is yours Loki well that's fantastic news and since it's not really going to happen either new Mass Effect announcement because there's just not good writing in that series hey if they got the first game writing team it would be good oh I'm sorry to say that it has been stricken from the list sorry Dark Sakura I guess while we're talking about things that will never happen alright there it is it is now your

yes mailbag at orange lounge radio.com is the place to send us emails dark soccer is gonna dive in head first and find some emails that she thinks are worthy of reading on the show tonight first email it's also subject line is now they've done it I looked up hubris the other day to make sure it meant what I thought it did Microsoft definitely has an overabundance of hubris they revealed Xbox one and the consumers on the internet made assumptions then Microsoft denied the rumors but last Thursday confirmed all the rumors to be true and the consumers are not happy see major Nelson's blog comments to see the shit storm the xbox one seems to be defying the consumers I'm sorry the consumers who use the internet oh wait those are the target demographic it's really stupid business wise to ignore your customer base and punish them in the process I hope they change and that comes from Rababa agreed I'm gonna apologize can you summarize that for me cause Alan just got home and I was talking to him um basically Microsoft denying the rumors then confirming the rumors and a big shit storm yeah what's up with that they totally did say no it's but then they were also saying like at one point what like it was gonna be $60 for the license or something I don't sometimes the left hand isn't talking to the right hand is it well and I'll repeat this line it's really stupid business wise to ignore your customer base and punish them in the process so that was from Rababa well thank you Rababa very very good points and the last demo cause we only had two unless you want me to read all of the Russian porn and the French porn and god are we still getting those no well you took care of all of those but well apparently we're not getting me verse porn thanks to Bobby really of course you get Russian porn I get all sorts of like porn emails I'm like I don't know why I don't sign up for porn no one signs up for porn porn happens okay this is another one from Rababa you should probably avoid my other emails for reading too late this is about the Xbox how it games letter I slash we got via email here is one quote feature your games keep playing even when you're not just because you're not playing doesn't mean your games have to stop with living games technology and the power of the cloud game worlds are persistent so the things you do in a game will stay that way

on Skype OrangeLoungeRadio but first Loki Minecraft is getting some updates on the portable version or the Pocket Edition including Alpha Realms support and if you remember correctly Minecraft Realms is that new Mojang run private servers basically and it will support online play for up to 10 players simultaneously within a single world and allow you to collaborate on projects and stuff like that and the alpha version is free and I guess it will be an optional paid service later on also they've added eggs, milk, cake and fire to the game you know so that you can you can make cake so glad to see that the Android version is getting some updates I wish that I know one of the things that they're working on and I don't think it's happened yet is controller support for that because if that's the case then I can sideload that onto my Ouya and play with the controller and it would be fantastic and oh god dammit I knew there were some I forgot nephews of the week but I'll mention it real quickly since they're talking about Minecraft what the hell the fucking vog network Minecraft server host is absolute shit and it's been down for five days now and I've sent you a bunch of support tickets to them no fucking response back but they sure as hell took out the money out of my account this weekend to pay for it so I'm looking there's three magic words that will get action Better Business Bureau so I'm gonna be I'm gonna either switch the server to a new host or I'm just gonna shut it down because no one's really playing on it you know I tried to log into it this week I played last week but it's just not a lot of people on there so it's you know even though it's ten bucks a month it's just you know I'll give you five dollars no one plays, it goes down alright one more news story for you guys and I think this is appropriate as a final news story tonight and I know Dark Soccer will be excited about this what? this is a game that was announced by The Game Atlier they developed a game called Sunflowers well they have announced a little arcade style cute em up it's called Flying Hamster HD and it's coming to the Playstation Vita on June 11th well that doesn't mean no good well and they have announced they have announced that this game is inspired by and this is why Dark Soccer is excited it's inspired by Konami's Parodius series here's some gameplay a little Flying Hamster oh that's awesome and if you want to play it though oh nice I like the little Egyptian penguin super cute I wanna fight the hell so this is super cute it is cute and you gotta love somebody who says they're inspired by Parodius right? Parodius is like one of the best games ever online leaderboards unlockable trophies and all that fun stuff on the Playstation Network the game is also on the Playstation mini service the original Flying Hamster is on the minis so that's pretty cool it has fat mermaids that's also a great little indie you might not have noticed that otherwise title so I'm really glad we're getting a little bit of a spotlight on that very cool so Dark Soccer is thinking about getting a Vita for that no I'm not it's downloaded on your iPad alright, I think it's about time to open up the Skypline because I'm sorry, nothing is Pentaro let's open up the Skypline 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio it is time to get some calls here on this Sunday night we wanna know, what are your E3 thoughts? you don't have to give them in a haiku form but bonus points if you do maybe you have something to say about all this Xbox One business I'm sure some of our regular callers have an opinion or three, or five, or ten on what we talked about at the very beginning of the show or maybe there's something else completely different we've missed we wanna hear from you guys on GameOLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio and look at that it's already ringing already got calls coming in tonight, let's go to it hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this? it's a sobered up Rama I'm sorry to hear that how are you otherwise, Rama? I'm doing pretty good, how about y'all out there in California? hot! actually, today was better I had chocolate, and I'm happy yeah, I've calmed down a little bit yesterday was 110, tomorrow is going to be 80 go fig yep well, what's new with you, Rama, why'd you call in tonight? a couple of things, but before I get into it, um, hey, Ookchan huh looks like at Otacon this year we may be bringing Rama one half back yay! yes, a few of us are doing a quick impromptu group photo well, send me a copy of it definitely, too bad I can't come with my spatula well, and if we have to we'll pack you in a box I wish I could go, I really do but unfortunately, money, blah blah okay, okay okay, this is the real reason why I called number one, I understand what everyone says about the Xbox One, but truth be told, it's still going to sell, because they're going to have these top tier titles and you have to forget half the gamers in video gaming fandom are lemmings they will say one thing and then after the presentation you see all these games, it'll be like, shut up and take my money couldn't you say the same thing about Nintendo's Wii U, though? yes, I can say that about every single gaming console but then what happens after that? The Nintendo fanboys have bought the Wii U and they're still calling it a failure you know, I still think the jury's out on that to give it another holiday season before we, you know, build its coffin, but uh, I don't know, why do you think that is? It's the way people think, and I'm kind of reminded from back in the days of everybody was importing the DDR in the Beatmania game to then when Konami started bringing over DDR and people got pissed at certain titles were not in the US releases, they were like, I'm not going to buy it, the game comes out, they buy it anyway to support their fandom. As for these next-gen consoles, one of the reasons why people are going to buy them is to support the console, they think it's going to work. To be fair, buddy, you're talking about a $40 game versus a $500 console, potentially, potentially. I know, but it's how some people think, and that's kind of scary. Yeah. And with the fact that Microsoft's bringing up so many servers, I don't think there's going to be that big of an issue of server downtime. You don't? I don't think so. I don't think Blizzard or EA thought so either. That's my worry. Well, maybe I don't know how many servers other manufacturers have, but I have this feeling Microsoft's going to have like the most, and they said straight up, they're going to bring up all these servers ahead of time. So I'm guessing some of the mistakes with EA and Blizzard were doing with servers, so who knows? So where's your head out with Xbox One after all of this? I said before, shut up and take my money for a PS4, but you know what? I'm going to wait until after the presentations and see what everybody has to say, and then make my decision. Based off games are most important? Not really. It's like games, technology, functionality, a little bit of everything. Let me ask you one more question, because I know you're a long time listener to this show. Were you here at the very beginning of the show, or did you come in late tonight? I was here at the very beginning of the show. Okay. I wouldn't judge you if you were late, but I just want to know, earlier in the show I asked Dark Sakura about the golden rule of gaming, and we kind of came to a consensus that perhaps the golden rule of gaming, a system is only as good as the games that are on it, could be evolving. What do you think? I think so too, because that golden rule is the reason why I got a 360 before the PS3. Because people are going to argue, why did you get that next gen console? All these cool games were on that one, and the answer is, well, those games are not games I would particularly like to play. The games that I've played and I've enjoyed are on this console. This console is going to offer these games I am interested in, which is why I'm going to buy it. YYR in our chat saying, having to start all over will make the new consoles even more expensive. New controllers, new accessories, new games, this is going to be expensive. If the consoles are $500 or so, the real cost will be a few hundred more than that. I don't think it's a given that they'll buy it. Well, I still remember when I was working at Staples, I looked outside the long line of people across the street at Circuit City for the $500 and $600 PlayStation 3. That's true, there'll be an audience somewhere, but will it be big enough? That's the question. Alright, Brahma, I gotta let you go to get more calls, but any other thoughts before I let you go? Yeah, I'm sorry, but this is the thing. I don't know if you heard, but GameStop had a special this week on Injustice Gods Among Men. You mean Gods Among Us, but yes. $10, one hour sale only. So many people flooded the site to try to buy it online. What I found out about this, I went and I printed out the paper. When I got out of class, I went down to Best Buy, and I got them to price match a $60 game for $10 that happened about two and a half hours after the sale ended. Nice work. Did you enjoy the game? Yes, it's one of the few games where I actually enjoyed it because I was playing it more for the story than anything else. As coming from someone who does not believe in paying retail price for a game unless you can get it to knock down, I honestly say the game is worth $50 at least. I can't see myself paying $59. I see myself paying $49 or maybe $54, but full retail, no. It is a tricky line once you break that $50 barrier. It's something psychological about it, but we could do a whole other episode on that. But I should let you go for now, Rama. Everybody listen to Anime Jam Session. You got it. We'll be talking about Denver Comic Con and Anime Next on Tuesday. Wow, you guys got a busy show. Alright, have a good one, buddy. You too. Bye. Alright. That's right. Even though we've been talking a lot on this show about E3, there's lots of other nerd shows at the Voice of Geeks Network talking about other stuff. So there's anime conventions going on. I'm sure somebody's going to be talking about Apple stuff on Monday, so stay tuned for that and all the great shows on the Voice of Geeks Network at vognetwork.com Let's go to the phones which are lighting up and take another call. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this? This is YYR. I just called to drop this rhyme. Haha, I'm a troll. We're going to have to have haiku call night at some point, and everybody will have to do that. Well played, my friend. Well played. I'm tipping my hat to you. You just can't see it. Rob's hat is invisible and intangible. Actually, that's really the only reason I called it. That's right. Well, since I have a captive audience, how is bungee ferret tossing going? Haha. It's beer money. Beer money is great because it buys beer. But I don't think you've seen the last of bungee ferret tossing. I'm deep in other projects right now such as ports to the smartphones and tablets I like to complain about, but I think at some point I would love to revisit that universe, yes. Wow, okay. Very cool. What do you think about the way there's been a lot of news about Xbox One is kind of shafting indies or whatever. I mean, as somebody who developed quite a bit, you did several games, not just bungee ferret tossing, but I know you had Snake 360 and Falling. You did a few games for the XNA or Xbox Live indie games. What do you think about all this news about Xbox One? Well, I mean, as far as indie games in general specifically, Microsoft already said they're not going to allow anyone to self-publish on one at first. And I think that's a game changer especially when Sony has come out and said, yes, if you want to self-publish come to us. PS4 will be happy to host your self-published game. And of course Nintendo is welcoming self-publishing on Wii U as well to some degree. I think you still need a business address to be a developer for a Nintendo platform. But besides that yeah, it seems that Microsoft is going to be the least indie-friendly next-gen console out of the gate. So with that in mind, I think that depending on how much indie games influence the next console generation that may not matter at all or it may matter a lot. It's all going to depend on how big of a blip on the radar indie games are over the next console gen. Before I let you go It's crazy. It's absolutely crazy. And I think all eyes are going to be on Sony at that after-conference presser. Is PS4 going to be like this? Is it going to be like that? Is it going to allow us to do this? And the answers given there are really going to make a big difference as far as how people perceive not just the Xbox One, but all of the new consoles, really. I mean, literally, tomorrow 12 hours away is a huge day in gaming. One of the biggest ever. I'll be on the edge of my seat and I know probably all of us will be to some extent, yes. I don't know, I'm going to take a nap. Before I let you go, buddy, I always kind of like to ask this. I know you just called in to give a haiku and here we are with an interview, but outside of developing your own stuff, what games are you playing? What are you enjoying playing lately? I've been playing a lot of Tekken lately. I actually bought the Wii U version just out of curiosity and I can say Tekken Ball, I don't know who remembers the Tekken Ball minigame in Tekken 3. Totally do. Yeah, they basically updated it graphically and now you can actually select different balls to use and the difference is basically in how fast they move, how quickly they charge up damage. So it's a little bit more customizable than it was before and of course you can use tag teams, which is for Tekken Ball, mostly useless, but it's fun anyway. So that is pretty much the major addition to the Tekken on Wii U. The mushroom battle that everyone made such a big deal about and looks like so much fun in videos, it's really not all it's cracked up to be. I mean, it's fun for like five minutes, but after the novelty wears off, because basically it's like the poison mushrooms that shrink you and the super mushrooms that grow you, the poison mushrooms also hurt you and the damage is really high to begin with, so it's like you get a couple mushrooms and already one more hit and you're dead. So it's over way too quickly and you can't play it online and you can't use tag teams and it's just not that great. And also online, not too many people playing for reasons that you could probably guess, but other than that it's the same game. Alright, well I haven't played a lot of Tekken in a while, so maybe I should maybe I should rent Tekken on Nintendo Wii U since my Wii will allow me to do that. The actual last one that I bought was Tekken 4. I am warning you though Tekken has gotten extremely complex over the years, so the learning curve is as steep now as it ever was, or possibly steeper. So as long as you're okay with that you know, enjoy. Enjoy your rental that you can actually do. Alright, well alright, take care buddy, I'm gonna let you go to see if we can get one more call, but enjoy all the E3 stuff this week and we'll talk to you later. Well we'll either enjoy it or not enjoy it, one of those. That's true, this is the first Alright, you too. This is the first year where we can't necessarily say we're gonna enjoy it, are we? Alright, 1877 game OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio We got time for about one more call here Any last minute stories while we're waiting for calls? Yes, actually I do have one. It's a hack that was done for New Super Mario Brothers on the Wii and it's just been released. It's a total conversion for the game called Newer Super Mario Brothers. 120 all new levels, remixed and original graphics to the game, themes and music, classic power-ups, also new bosses and that kind of stuff and you can get it if you have a homebrew-enabled Wii. There's no piracy or hardware mods needed, so I believe it's just a save file that you put on there and you can download that at NewerTeam.com That's where you can find that. Is that it? I'm trying to pull up Twitter here. I've been looking at the Xbox 720 checkpoint thing that came out last year. Remember the whole leak about VR and stuff and a lot of it sounds exactly what they're talking about right now, so who knows? Next year maybe we might see some sort of Xbox glasses or something. Straight up even to the slogan that makes no fucking sense. Next Generation Entertainment, one box input one. Like why would you even do that? I don't know. Alright. Let's take another call. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this? Hi, this is Raginator. Hey Raginator. I was going to say I didn't see the cam come on at first. There it is. What's up Raginator? Just a quick question. It's kind of a loaded one. You kind of touched on something I'll be briefly earlier during the show. Rare is kind of hinted that they're working on something and everyone's speculating their necessity to all franchise. Most people seem to think it's going to be either Conquer or Kill Instinct. What are your thoughts on that? Well we had a screenshot that was leaked but again it's one of those anybody could have with a Photoshop. Oh did they prove it fake? Yeah. Proved it fake? You're talking about the one that had like Banjo-Kazooie Yeah it was fake because they had that Microsoft game. The Halo Spartan Assault or whatever but the logo was different. And it's because that stuff that they got on there was either wishful thinking and trademarks that they had already done. It wasn't anything new. It was fake. So it's not it's not going to be Banjo-Kazooie. I don't think it would be Banjo-Kazooie anyways because it wouldn't be that big a deal. It would be just kind of like ehhhh whatever because they had a new Banjo game and it was just it was alright but I'm going to go with the easy answer and say Killer Instinct based off the whole trademark dispute that they got settled. There wouldn't have been a reason to do that otherwise I don't think if they didn't want to keep that door open for some reason. And I think they know that's what everybody wants and especially with where they're going with all this DRM debacle it's going to take a franchise like that to make people what's it going to take for you to sell your morals up the river? Essentially. And I mean honestly if Xbox could come out and say you know what we're going to have we're going to have Rob's Fantasy games Mass Effect 4 The Guardian Legend 2 and the things I want to see it's going to be hard for me to even go God I fucking hate what they're doing but I really really really want these games it's going to be hard it's easy for me to sit here now and go I don't need Halo 5 I don't need a new Killer Instinct I don't need some of this other stuff they're talking about because I can kind of be satisfied with Playstation 4 Well and technically we don't need any of it we need air and water No I need Guardian Legend 2 Jamie I need it. Rob I need it. Rob. I need it! Intervention! What about you Jamie? What? A rare franchise that's coming back Killer Instinct? How about you Raginator? Well I would love to see another Killer Instinct. God only knows I played the Jesus out of the SNES port along with the N64 game but I'm a little concerned because you know the history has shown that both first priorities and third priorities tend to really go overboard screw with a proven formula and when they screw with a given formula that's proven to be a winner a lot of people tend to revolve Case is a point Capcom screwed with you know the Final Fight with Streetwise for the PS2 turned the 2D brawler into a 3D brawler that didn't do too well they also screwed with Street Fighter and came out with the EX series didn't do too well and of course there was a whole more common port on the SNES which still gets kind of paid today In defense of the Street Fighter EX series EX3 was pretty good I want to say with Capcom too since you brought up Mega Man I think there's a very strong possibility Mega Man fans will finally have something to celebrate this week I don't know if that'll just be a little victory or something but I just think the timing is right for Capcom to unveil what they're going to do with Mega Man since they pretty much said they're not killing them off so whether that be a reboot of Legends 3 or whatever Mega Man 11 for god's sake whatever they're doing I think next week is very good for that but you know that's an easy thing to predict but we'll see if it actually happens Well ultimately if they do make a killer receipt I would love to see it just don't screw it up make minor tweaks here and there maybe add new characters maybe a mechanic here or there but don't go radically changing the game to the point where it's basically a totally different game it's only related to previous games by name only Alright Well Raginator before I let you go here tonight I noticed that you also submitted a tweet to us at twitter.com slash o-l-r so allow me to read Random question when playing Gyruss how many warps are there to Uranus? I'm not going to say it the other way. I asked because I just wanted to type Uranus well there you go and now I read it there on air so congratulations and if I remember right it would be 3 warps to Neptune and then 3 more to Uranus 6 warps to Uranus Raginator Yeah I know it's I came up with something It's alright, so's the show so's the show Raginator Alright have a good one buddy Alright bye I feel like that's like wishing people a Merry Christmas or Happy Hanukkah I feel like you should wish video gamers a Happy E3 even when E3 is going to be bad news like it's just like people fight May you not be as disappointed this year as you were last What should like Happy E3 Merry E3 You're E3, what should the greeting be to other gamers this time of year? Dark Soccer you're Here's a hanky You're our linguist What should the greeting be to other gamers? Blessed E3 That might be a little too much Blessed E3 How about How about Wink Free E3 Alright maybe I'll throw that question to the chatters and see what they come up with but for now I am going to close the Skype line if you do have further thoughts on any of tonight's topics Mailbag out OrangeLaunchRadio.com or Twitter.com slash O-L-R So a screenshot leaked from a brand new unannounced game Oh It's assumed, well we kind of assumed it was coming Just Dance the new Just Dance game It's going to have the Ghostbusters theme in it because they have a screenshot where people are dressed up like Ghostbusters That's in Just Dance 4 Isn't it? You sure about that? Rob is up going to look by the way Now in the chatroom by the way we have a call for a new Rival Schools series Okay what are you looking at? Just Dance 4 He's reading It's going to take us a while because Rob's reading Just kidding I'm sorry Y-Y-R I can't click YouTube Maybe not It's official because it's actually on Xbox's website So if you go to Xbox's Just Dance 2014 and they've got Well I mean what a duh They're going to do a new Just Dance game I mean come on these games sell like crazy and it's not a bad game They have a guy that looks like Beetlejuice in here What? I mean that looks like Beetlejuice I'm assuming that maybe that's A ghost Alright as far as the E3 greetings in our chatroom Misty says Happy E3 I would think Let's keep it simple why over think it Maybe be Happy E3 Happy E3 Happy E3 I like that Alright a couple of tweets from TigerClaw I apologize I don't think you read this one yet but I know it was in the list of stories we just didn't get to it tonight TigerClaw talking about Mad Catz readying an Android console of their own. Is this like an Ouya type response? No they are yeah It's not like the Ouya Actually I like the idea a lot better than the Ouya It's basically going to be a console that plays Android games. It has the Google Play Store and it plays any Android game and you can actually map buttons onto stuff So games that don't support touch or whatever you can use a mouse with them or do support touch you can use a mouse or you can use analog sticks to emulate touch but the fact that it doesn't require any special games it's just the games that you have or the games that you buy for like a dollar or free or whatever so I like that and their controller looks nice too it looks like an Xbox 360 controller actually it looks exactly like their their Xbox 360 controller their MLG controller it looks exactly like that and one other tweet from TigerClaw tonight about Interplay getting an IP from THQ for $7,500 that's how much they paid for FreeSpace that's a good deal that's a great deal Interstellar Combat series that was developed by Volition and published by Interplay it's back in Interplay's library after getting it back from THQ so there you go Interplay by the way it should be noted they never did lose the rights to sell Descent FreeSpace and FreeSpace 2 there you go I want another Descent that is awesome that required more buttons than the other Descent games that would be awesome that required telekinesis to play alright well thank you guys very much for your tweets at twitter.com slash o-l-r lots of great stuff tonight but it's about that time we gotta wrap up the show and get everybody's final thought and all that we have a consensus in the chat room, Rival Schools is awesome Rival Schools is awesome we'll put that on your list list, too late well, okay, you know what I actually, when I had a lot more disposable income I paid 99 bucks to import the Justice Gakuen Evolution and I played the hell out of it for days, but it's like every time they would bring out like one of the games for home they'd take out something from the Japanese version that made it awesome like the board game mode in Project Justice after you played through the board game your custom character that you played the board game with would have stats based on how you played the game and they just took that out well guys before I let you go tonight I just want to say happy three and let's hope that let's hope the news isn't too terrible let's hope there's a lot of good surprises and things that we will be excited about I will be here during the day tomorrow during the press conferences and I'll be around Tuesday too I will make a point to be in chat if you want some folks to talk about the conferences, you want a live blog, not really live blogging because I kind of think everybody's kind of watching it, but more like live discussion if you want to talk about what's going on at E3 with some like-minded individuals I urge you to be at live.vognetwork.com I'll be there during the big press conferences tomorrow and we can talk about it and kind of discuss are you going to be there too? Yes, because my boss is gone so I don't have to really work that it's all work related anyways, come on I'll be there at least for Microsoft and Sony but in the middle of the day Dark Soccer and I might go on a friend date to take care of some stuff around town YYR left another haiku Happy E3 guys, look forward to no prices and no dates either I think we'll get those tomorrow I think we'll get prices and dates tomorrow I don't know It would be a first if we did, because remember what was the infamous thing a few years ago from Sony $599 US dollars $599, so I think we will get it I'll wake up tomorrow to care about the press releases to get in chat as well I've already got my popcorn it's just stale, but I already have my popcorn I want to go to Popcornopolis If you want a place to just chat with some other folks and kind of just get some live banter going on what's going on at E3 join us and chat live.vognetwork.com You never know, Bobby might pop in on a plane for all we know from his plane, we'll see Check out E3.vognetwork.com I'm really excited about what this week is going to bring and it's going to be a great week I guess that's it We'll be back next week to do it all over again as we lead up to our 11th anniversary on June 23rd It's time to go around and get everybody's final thought Dark Sakura, we'll start with you tonight your final thought I wish I hadn't eaten all that chocolate so quickly And my final thought tonight is no regrets, I did eat it that quickly and it was good Loki, your final thought tonight I'm looking forward to this week, I'm always excited about E3 stuff, just disappointed that I don't get to play and also I'm not going to be able to make it out to Best Buy and Wednesday to play the Wii U games because it's not a weird time, it's like a 4 o'clock like if it was in the middle of the day I could sneak out and do that, but the middle of the day one's on Saturday and I'm just, I'm not going to drive all the way to Elk Grove No, then I'm not going to drive down the Elk Grove to play New Super League What if our local listeners wanted to meet you?
