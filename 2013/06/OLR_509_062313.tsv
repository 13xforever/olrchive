13922	23776	Tonight, June 23, 2013, a firmware update on PlayStation 3 bricks some consoles, Saints Row 4 will embrace modding, and could a Final Fantasy XII remake be in the works?
31789	37051	Hello, everybody out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37131	43733	It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 509 for this June the 23rd of 2013.
45574	53757	My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me, as she has for the past 11 years to the day, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
54497	54637	Uh...
56138	58839	And that's how you feel about the past 11 years all summed up, right?
58859	61300	No, I'm very happy about making 11 years.
61461	64022	I just am on the tail end.
64282	67483	It just wouldn't be an episode of OLR if you weren't- If I hadn't been sick all week.
67523	68884	If you hadn't been sick all week, all right.
68924	72666	I have no idea what's up, but whatever this flu thing is can bite my ass.
72806	74547	Actually, it bit my ass and it probably-
75407	76987	You're programming in French.
100152	102054	And it feels like it sometimes, I swear.
102074	105937	I've been picking it up pretty fast.
105977	109659	I think I started on Tuesday, maybe?
110020	110920	I think it was this week.
110960	112361	Yeah, it was on Tuesday.
113442	118026	And I've already gone through most of this first book.
119807	121769	I'm now in the object-oriented stuff.
122609	124371	And then they're going to start, I think...
125051	126472	I'm trying to think what's left.
126772	140521	There's polymorphism, which I have no fucking clue what that means, and Windows programming, because right now it's all console, Windows stuff, DOS, if you will, and then very simple things.
140681	143323	Although I've made a lot of gambling games, because that's a lot of the...
143823	145164	OLR Dream Game in a Reality in a Few Years
163843	173428	Well, yeah, I just wanted to have some sort of a language, just to get the basics so that I can learn other languages if I want to learn Java or something like that.
174989	177551	You can take a lot of what you learn in one and apply it to others.
177971	181533	I find source code for games fascinating.
181953	189297	Just randomly today I was on the internet, and I was looking up old Atari 2600 games, and there was one in particular that...
190137	215750	That I remember from back in the day Of course now I'm going to forget the name I think it was called Dragonfire It was a game that had like two screens And in one you were running across the castle bridge And you were trying to dodge fireballs And you would get into the room with the dragon You had to pick up all the chalices and everything in the room And get to the door Hopefully somebody out there knows what I'm talking about So I don't sound like I'm smoking crack This is an Atari 2600 game My point is the source code is out there for you to download and look at And it's all commented
215990	218771	So you can see exactly what it went into making those games.
218912	224434	It's like, man, programming for the Atari 2600 was a bitch because... It's all assembly, yeah.
224454	226355	Well, yeah, and you had, like, no space.
226756	229437	Those cartridges... The beginning Atari 2600 cartridges were 4K.
232550	233670	It's 4,000 characters.
233690	234971	Yeah, that's not a lot.
235411	240092	Yeah, that's part of the reason that Pac-Man sucks so bad.
240112	245633	But we'll leave that for another time because there's too much in gaming this week to talk about Atari 2600.
246273	249534	But I do want to introduce here in our studio, welcome back.
249574	253535	It's been exactly one year since he was last at the show.
254155	256976	Say hello, everybody, to JV Mon is here tonight.
257316	257976	Hello.
258196	258896	Hey, how you doing?
258916	259016	Good.
259136	261317	Doin' alright, just staring at these peanut butter brownies
277381	282144	Yes, Becky says happy 11th, and she is going to a movie with her mother tonight.
282204	285046	Tell Becky that I love her and I hate her all at the same time.
285066	285866	I will.
285906	286547	She's such a bitch.
286687	288108	I love her for these brownies.
288188	289409	I hate her for these brownies.
289969	290690	But mostly love.
290870	297974	I told her that it's basically her contribution for not being here is that she's going to basically make everybody fatties.
297994	302457	She made two pans, by the way, so she's got some herself.
302597	311505	It's also worth noting that JV Mom brought to the show a nice bottle of Silver Patron for us to consume.
311885	316149	So now I can combine worlds a little bit because you were telling me before the show you have yet to have a fireball shot.
316209	317570	I've never had fireball whiskey.
317751	324957	So we're going to take, I'm going to get Pod Culture's bottle that he sent us from the repository and then we're going to have some drinks.
325037	325878	We're going to get drunk.
325918	327900	Girl, we going to drink?
328280	328940	We're gonna drink.
330141	336523	Quickly, we gotta get into gaming news, because there's huge news this week, and I want to turn it over to Jamie so we can get into that.
337084	341005	Because the last few episodes, the last few episodes of OLR, we don't have time to fuck around.
341105	343586	There's too much... We ain't got time for this shit.
343646	346748	Gaming news, or gaming weeks, and what have we been playing?
346768	349789	Nobody cares, because we had a console war, and it's getting good.
350029	350789	It's getting real good.
351489	352610	It's getting classic.
353226	368273	but uh quickly JV Mon since you're here uh obviously I want you to comment throughout tonight's show but you are an indie broadcaster as well right off and on off and on when you know I actually get around to uploading my podcast yeah and what what podcast is it that you do
368672	377438	I do a mostly Eurobeat based podcast called Super Euro Power Hour, which I don't think once in the history of the show I've actually had a show under an hour.
377839	382002	It's more like Super Euro three and a half power hour.
382242	385244	You are still really quiet and I can't figure out why and it's bothering me.
385284	387726	So I apologize to the listeners that are like, he's too quiet.
387926	388666	Live radio.
389067	389607	Live radio.
389627	390668	I got to adjust things on the fly.
390948	407286	It's the acoustic absorption properties of the brownies It wouldn't be 11 years of Orange Lounge Radio if there weren't technical problems on the fly And people usually say I'm too loud and it's funny, it's like, they can't hear me Actually, now you're good, I think we fixed it Alright, I had to turn up the gain so they can probably hear me on your mic back here
408066	408286	No.
408446	408946	But it works.
409106	409367	All right.
411367	412367	Okay.
412627	415228	Live listeners at live.vogradio.com.
415288	419389	Let us know if you're okay with the sound or if we need to change things on the fly.
420430	420710	I'm sorry.
420730	422830	Did you give out the URL while I was adjusting your sound?
423591	424211	I did not.
424411	424851	Please do.
425591	452192	Just search on iTunes Super Euro Power Hour I mean, I've been sitting on the last latest episode on my hard drive for like the past month It was like recorded like almost two months ago Like I'm an extreme procrastinator So new episode coming soon Eventually Soon is the word we use in the gaming industry, soon Soon, new episode coming soon I mean it's not like gaming where like you gotta be first to get the news out there It's just like it'll be out there when it's out there
452752	458417	Um, uh, since you haven't been here in a year, you were here for the 10th anniversary, which was a crazy night all in itself.
458877	460458	So now you're 11 years.
460538	461659	That's just another week.
461759	463100	No one care about 11 years.
463120	463921	It's just another week.
464401	467204	Um, quickly remind us what's what's you as a gamer?
467224	468545	What kind of video games do you play?
468585	469085	What do you like?
469125	469946	What systems do you own?
470406	472068	I own most of them.
472308	475971	I, um, if it comes out, I'll probably buy it.
477551	481354	I don't have a Vita anymore because I dropped it in a puddle and that's probably the saddest day in my life.
481594	483895	That's wow, son.
483995	484355	Wow.
484996	493380	Yeah, like not even a year and it falls in a puddle and that's probably like the slowest 10 seconds in my life just watching it go in a puddle, submerge, watching it power off.
494221	496642	Did it have that whole like, what you say?
497703	499264	Did you have a dear sister moment with that?
499284	499684	Pretty much.
499804	501545	I was like, no.
502105	502526	But yeah.
503687	512676	I'm considering either trying to fix it or buying a new Vita because I'm a consumer whore and I want my game systems.
512776	514157	Favorite video game of all time?
516540	517420	Super Mario RPG.
519342	519783	Why is that?
520598	522400	I just loved the story and the gameplay.
523681	530908	And that final boss battle as a kid, I just remember renting it from Blockbuster, the cartridge, because my mom was like, you ain't getting a new game.
530928	532029	So I was like, fine, Blockbuster.
532730	541599	So we would rent it every week, and I would play it during the weekends instead of doing my homework, which wasn't a very responsible thing to do.
541639	542640	But hey, I was a kid.
543621	544382	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
571394	572955	Which isn't even getting good reviews.
573236	576458	So that tells me you're a little bit of a Nintendo fanboy.
576498	576959	That's okay.
577159	579201	I do enjoy my Nintendo games.
579921	582524	I think it's just more I need something new to play on my Wii U.
583672	587354	And it's like, oh my god, a new game out on the Wii U. Stars Alive.
587655	588055	That's fair.
589416	591617	Alright, one more time, the Vita story.
591697	594539	What happened when you dropped it?
595440	596441	I was getting out of my car.
596721	597641	I closed my car door.
598342	599382	I left that part out.
600123	601444	My Vita just bloop.
601804	603846	Flew out of my pocket into a puddle.
606988	609330	It's like it's happening all over again.
611331	617536	And as it falls through the water, it just powers down slowly.
617856	619117	Longest ten seconds of my life.
619137	621419	It's like the end of Terminator 2.
621539	625582	It just sticks its thumb out and slowly sinks down to the molten metal.
626949	627449	DarkSakura.com
653849	658371	In the most professional language, I can say, Microsoft done flipped a bitch.
659731	660772	Yeah.
660832	664873	Basically, they put out a big announcement that said, okay, we're not doing all that other stuff.
664893	665753	We're doing this instead.
666294	670835	So basically, they're not requiring the internet connection to play offline Xbox One games.
671335	672056	Ex-boner.
672556	674256	Xbox 180.
675057	678098	The joke that everybody has been saying.
678958	685024	Um, basically you can trade in your games, resell, gift, rent discs, blah blah, sit on it, take a crap on it, they don't care.
685365	687687	You can do all of it, it's gonna be physical discs.
688508	691151	So, uh, it was sort of like, oh, oh, all that?
691231	693133	Oh, we weren't serious, never mind, click.
694074	695435	So yeah, complete reversal.
697021	699222	I have to admit, I was wrong.
699442	710044	Well, I wasn't wrong, but I was mostly incorrect last week because I said there is no way Microsoft would reverse course that fast.
710144	716566	I said it will take a miracle for Microsoft to win the holiday season at this point, and within three days they parted the Red Sea.
716806	719949	Well, they rode in on a white horse, like in History of the World.
720569	727376	You know within seconds of those planes getting back to Seattle, Don Matrick is like, boardroom, now!
729701	731283	Right now, get in that boardroom.
731683	734585	As Don Metric said, your feedback matters.
735205	737607	Investors that have stock in our company.
738328	739649	Oh, consumers, oh, fuck them.
739769	744032	But yeah, you guys want us to make it so that more people buy our console.
744072	746374	So yeah, I guess we better flip this.
748095	756962	Still one thing that's really confusing about the whole thing is that it does require a day one patch to enable this offline mode.
757679	784340	which begs the question these consoles aren't even fucking being manufactured yet why the hell do I need a day one patch I'm no system comes out without a day one patch because I'm I'm gonna give Microsoft the benefit of the doubt here I think they were so committed to their vision that they had already coded the firmware because you know firmware don't write itself you know you know coding now firmware don't write itself somebody's gonna have to write this new firmware and it's just not gonna be done by the time these consoles okay I'm
784400	787382	I can't fucking play anything because I can't do my day one patch.
808131	817077	Although, granted, data is free, discs cost money, even if it's a penny a disc, they have to manufacture how many discs?
817157	825363	No, I'm not talking about manufacturing discs, I'm talking about putting it on their game discs, like they're doing with the current gen stuff.
825643	827845	That way, there's not an issue.
827865	832448	Yeah, I can understand you can download and burn your own stuff, but once again, that requires that you have internet.
833228	839611	So I'm just saying that you put it on the game disc, since those discs have not been pressed yet, and there you go.
840171	840891	Problem solved.
841551	852676	Obviously you're going to have to connect to the internet to, or you're going to have to want to play a game before you can figure out that you can't play a game without that update, so putting the disc in the drive should solve the problem.
853356	859258	If they were smart, although they flip-flopped on levels of intelligence, so whatever.
860139	860519	I don't know.
860559	864703	When you talk like that, it still sounds like the whole let's kick Microsoft while they're down mentality.
864803	865244	Alright, fine.
865264	866285	Connect is still connected.
867706	869327	Okay, now we can have a real conversation.
869368	870529	Yes, Connect is still connected.
872090	872791	And it's $100 more.
873672	874993	We'll get into that later in the show.
875513	875533	I...
877284	878285	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
902023	904505	I have to follow Microsoft's pre-designated terms.
904525	906946	I didn't really care about the 24-hour thing.
906966	910329	The DRM thing didn't bug me nearly as much as that component did.
911069	915392	So the fact that that's not a factor now makes me feel like, okay, I can support Xbox One.
915432	915952	I'm good with that.
916292	926859	But there was a lot of people on Twitter and Facebook very hurt about, well, because we're now taking this out, we're going to have to take the quote-unquote cool features out with it.
927200	930862	And the one thing I kept hearing over and over again was family sharing, family sharing, family sharing.
931042	935745	Which, to me, I'm like, what does that mean?
936125	946031	Because some people honestly have it in their heads, I think, based on the tweets I saw, that family sharing was going to allow you to buy a game and share it with 10 people unconditionally.
947152	953095	And if that is really the way you were thinking, then can I have some of the glue that you're huffing to glue your screws back in?
953615	953956	Because...
954756	959702	I'm sorry, that is not a win situation for the publisher or for Microsoft or anybody.
959722	961764	Remember, they're in the business to make money.
962785	965989	If they're getting rid of used games because they're saying, Oh, you know what?
966189	969493	Used games are really hurting the new game sales.
969673	980980	They're not going to put this thing, okay, we're going to get rid of used games, but we're going to have this method where you can buy one game and you can have two people play at the same time.
981741	984562	Nope, that is not going to happen without some sort of restrictions.
985043	989786	Raven's Dolphin in chat says, I don't think family sharing was not going to be that great.
989866	991847	I heard it was going to be like a one-hour demo.
992127	993808	Yeah, I saw that story floating around the internet too.
993828	994829	Anonymous Pastebin.
995129	995849	We don't know.
996190	997791	We don't know what it was supposed to be.
997851	1001153	So why are people getting so upset about something we didn't know about that we lost?
1001633	1006976	It's sort of like people talking up the fantasy of what they want it to be and how rumors spread.
1007336	1008817	It's like a giant game of telephone.
1009818	1014500	And they get so excited about what they think this final thing is going to be without having anything to back it up.
1015161	1018603	So it's like getting excited about Tooth Fairy bringing you a quarter.
1019963	1020724	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1037782	1039384	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1055422	1056603	And I understand why they're doing it.
1056703	1063866	So that, you know, it can be assumed that any developer out there that's making a game can develop a game that uses a Kinect because a Kinect's going to be there.
1064386	1064866	Blah, blah, blah.
1065727	1071609	My thing is, though, why don't they just have it where they assume that it's going to be there and then you don't have to have a Kinect and you don't have to use it?
1071629	1078593	Because, obviously, a lot of those games that they... Actually, all of those games that they showed during their press conference didn't use Kinect.
1079853	1081255	or it was an optional thing.
1081535	1092626	So if this is so integral into their console, why am I not seeing how it's being used that's revolutionary aside from grenade, grenade, reload, grenade, grenade?
1093046	1096750	To be fair, because most of that revolutionary stuff has nothing to do with the games.
1097050	1098892	If you want to see where they were showing that off...
1099212	1101314	I'm not saying that's a smart decision, but I'm saying that is the decision.
1101535	1103016	And for me, it's not a deal breaker.
1115410	1119051	But, anyway, I want to read some of these other comments in chat.
1119291	1124452	We got Koopa Kid Jeremy says, some of those cool features could still be implemented.
1124532	1126573	Like, why not give the option to gold subscribers?
1126913	1128093	That's kind of where my head's at.
1129273	1133174	My mindset is, okay, so you lost the battle with the disc-based games.
1133374	1133694	Fine.
1134154	1137655	Disc-based games, the way you know it and love it today, right?
1137875	1139255	Why not have that be the market?
1139656	1140896	Digitally-based games?
1141196	1141596	Okay.
1141896	1143758	Yeah, you get some of those deals.
1143778	1145259	Okay, so financial incentive, that's good.
1162513	1178573	but what if some of the pluses were okay, when you buy a game digitally you can instantly send it to JV Mon in New York City without having to mail the disc to him I could just instantly give him the license that is kind of cool why can't I still have that for a digital game?
1179522	1183305	I'm not really hearing why that has to be taken away.
1183405	1189731	I mean, yes, Microsoft has to go back to square one to reinvent some of this stuff.
1190311	1193914	Unfortunately, the thing is there's a lot of people that have to give approval to that.
1193954	1195736	You have to get the approval from the publishers.
1195776	1201201	You have to get approval from... They have to create the infrastructure for it and stuff.
1201321	1201781	And it's just...
1202882	1203382	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1222495	1225438	or you can get DRM free or whatever, you know.
1226079	1234747	Desura, I mean, there's a lot of options available whereas that's why I always bug me when people are like, well, you know, when they get rid of the used games it's gonna drive the price of games down.
1234767	1239111	I'm like, no, it's not gonna fucking drive the games down because what they've done now is they've even limited the marketplace
1239731	1244834	So much more that you can only return your games at certain retailers.
1245174	1247355	So basically these retailers are going to have an advantage.
1247395	1255080	And are they really going to be wanting to drop the price of their game considering the game that they're selling?
1255100	1258141	Because you're going to be more likely to go there anyway.
1258201	1262484	So why bother trying to compete when they're kind of limiting the competition?
1264323	1269406	I am very curious about where people's heads are at after all this DRM stuff.
1269446	1275610	Because for me, I had the whole discussion last week about I'm out, I'm out, I'm not having this.
1275690	1281614	But now that this is mentioned that they're going to remove this, I'm probably going to get an Xbox One.
1281914	1284496	I'm not going to get one this holiday season because that's too much.
1284616	1286016	Just financially, I can't afford it.
1286377	1287878	But next year...
1288718	1302896	especially when more of these exclusives are out by the time Halo 5's out I'll get one I think I'll get an Xbox One now that the DRM thing's worked out but that's me and I'm really curious about you guys so I want to use this as an excuse to go to a live poll
1304372	1308616	So if you go to live.vognetwork.com, there's a poll up right now.
1308996	1311679	How do you feel about an Xbox One post-180?
1311979	1314541	Obviously, how do you feel about it after the flip?
1314962	1315682	Four answers.
1316163	1318124	I was going to buy one, and I still am.
1318685	1320647	I was going to buy one, but now I'm not.
1321167	1321427	Maybe...
1322228	1322508	I don't know.
1323068	1329911	I was going to buy one before or excuse me, I wasn't going to buy one before but now I am and then I'm still not buying it.
1330371	1332612	What's your thoughts on Xbox One right now?
1332932	1336054	Live.VogNetwork.com if you're a registered VOG Network participant.
1336494	1338015	We'll read the answers here momentarily.
1339215	1340756	Jamie, I was going to ask where your head's at with this.
1340956	1343657	You read us the story but you didn't tell me where your head's at after it.
1343897	1347698	I still don't care enough about the Xbox One to get one.
1349818	1353819	Dan and I were pretty much already decided on the PS4 because it's an upgraded Blu-ray player.
1354759	1357860	And keep in mind, our PS3 is a release model.
1358780	1362221	So it's been surviving for a very, very long time.
1363221	1365341	And we don't know when it's going to go.
1365601	1367222	So yeah, we had already decided on the PS4.
1368822	1371486	And I think that this is too little too late.
1371506	1372767	There's still a lot of unknowns.
1372807	1373869	They haven't clarified anything.
1374269	1375911	And I don't really care about Connect.
1376572	1377293	I really don't.
1377954	1379015	I don't really care about Move.
1380897	1384201	But at least I have an option of not having to buy Move.
1384221	1388126	I would rather just not deal with it.
1389582	1393166	All right, we'll read the answers momentarily.
1394528	1399313	The Xbox One exclusives were good enough for me that I'm very interested in checking it out.
1399353	1405140	And still, as we learn this week, a lot can change still between now and the day this thing launches.
1406380	1417203	I'm not saying they're necessarily going to go back on the Kinect policy and all that, but it is not without reason that Microsoft couldn't say, we're going to do the subsidized console.
1417403	1421284	We're going to put out our console for $299 with the two-year gold subscription.
1421304	1425105	There's still more ammo that Microsoft could throw at this thing.
1425885	1429006	I don't know if we've seen the last of this just yet, but we'll see.
1430747	1434349	Any other comments on the Xbox DRM reversal situation?
1434589	1434869	Anybody?
1434969	1435249	Anyway?
1436150	1439332	The whole removal of features, it seems like it was like, fine, you want it this way?
1439352	1441793	We're just going to take our ball of special features and go home with it.
1442154	1446016	It seemed like kind of like a dick move that they probably could have just kept in there.
1446416	1447617	Yeah, but what was the ball?
1447897	1448477	What was it?
1448758	1449738	It was the potential.
1449758	1451840	Now we're not going to tell you.
1452220	1452980	What's in the box?
1453080	1458664	It was like, I brought you a present, but now that you don't want to do things my way, you're never going to find out what the present was.
1460109	1467573	I did like how they fed it into the whole, like, oh, you guys, we heard your feedback, and we're doing what's good for you.
1467773	1472995	Yes, I'm glad you're concerned about what's good for me now, three days later after your console sucked.
1473195	1478278	As funny as this conversation all is, though, for real, everybody was fucking pissed about it.
1478318	1479839	Sony got a standing ovation.
1480219	1483080	And they got to even interject negatives.
1483380	1487202	Sony got away with saying we're going to charge you to play multiplayer.
1487242	1488323	The number one reason...
1488883	1517360	our fanboys love us more well maybe not the number one but one of the big things fanboys love to hold over Microsoft fanboys heads is that you can play multiplayer free we are going to start charging for that and nobody cares we're getting standing ovations because we went against Microsoft's policies and now that Microsoft switched those policies to be the same thing I still feel like a lot of people are like eh fuck em it doesn't matter but they're still charging less and home still offered some more fun than gold did
1517759	1523163	Well, the perception is, too, that you have Sony who did the right thing the first time.
1523323	1527126	Now, whether they changed the decision last minute, who knows?
1527606	1531949	But, okay, so the perception is that they made the right choice the first time.
1532009	1541816	Then you have Microsoft that made the wrong choice in everybody's eyes and then kind of recanted on that because they value what the consumer wants.
1542481	1554807	So, I mean, the problem that I have there is either A, they didn't value what the consumer wants and they were going to do their own damn thing, or B, they really didn't know what the consumer wanted and now they do all of a sudden?
1555048	1558389	I mean, are they really out of touch or they just don't give a shit?
1558489	1558669	So...
1560154	1562075	I can't really... I don't know.
1562515	1565937	I don't really want to get an Xbox One right now.
1566397	1572080	And I love the controller and it looks like fun, but I just can't support that kind of thing.
1572100	1575822	And I'm sorry that, you know, okay, so you went back on it.
1576062	1582666	That's kind of like if I called Jamie a giant bitch and then said, sorry, just kidding, I didn't really mean that.
1583006	1584687	It's still hurtful in the beginning.
1584887	1585827	I do that every day.
1585927	1586508	I'm just saying.
1587188	1589750	I'm just saying, you know... Yeah, but I call you a bigger bitch, so what's that?
1589810	1590430	That's fact.
1590610	1590931	Fact.
1591331	1599256	So, I'm just saying, like, are we supposed to all of a sudden forget, you know, the bad choices that they made just because they went ahead and fixed some of it?
1599316	1600297	You know, I'm sorry.
1600337	1602098	I'm just not gonna... Well...
1603240	1603580	I don't know.
1603701	1610108	Okay, but to be fair, Loki, I gotta play devil's advocate with you on that because to be fair, Sony's made their own share of bad decisions.
1610188	1610649	That's true.
1611170	1619920	So why are we so quick to loyally throw ourselves upon Sony like, fuck me now, Sony, you're so wonderful, you give me everything my heart desires.
1620101	1621803	What bad decisions are we talking about here?
1622483	1622624	Um...
1623644	1630870	Well, for one, you're about to read a story later in the show that strikes me as a pretty bad decision to release a firmware when it's clearly not ready.
1631290	1632231	But that's one.
1633131	1639436	The whole fact that the network got hacked and they had to shut down the system for however long they did because of it.
1639876	1643579	Okay, and then they appeased everybody and they also gave away free games.
1643859	1646541	As opposed to Microsoft who said, Hack?
1646721	1647782	We didn't get fucking hacked.
1647822	1649603	Your money just disappeared by ghosts.
1649923	1650744	Ghosts stole it.
1651741	1659043	You know, I mean, like, they didn't even fucking, you know, admit that they've been hacked, even though it's been proven over and over and over again that they have been hacked.
1659543	1670545	And then they all of a sudden, oh, yeah, we're going to go ahead and increase our authentication for, like, stuff, make it a little harder to log in, you know, with more security because, you know, because we just, we're valuing the consumer.
1670745	1672526	We want to make sure that you're protected.
1672826	1677367	And not because we got hacked and your money got stolen and we didn't do shit about it for over a year.
1678487	1682528	I just recalled some other bad decisions that Sony has made in the past.
1682568	1683028	Are you ready?
1683108	1683588	Here we go.
1683988	1686809	Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Kaz Hirai.
1687229	1688749	Ridge Racer.
1689950	1695071	The essence of the PlayStation DNA is real change and the consumers are ready.
1696331	1700552	Genji 2 is an action game which is based on Japanese history.
1701072	1702593	Ridge Racer.
1703353	1704393	Being based on history...
1705524	1712350	The stages of the game will also be based on famous battles which actually took place in ancient Japan.
1713071	1715373	So here's this giant enemy crab.
1715953	1717475	Ridge Racer!
1718876	1719797	Best part's coming up.
1719857	1720437	It's Ridge Racer!
1724714	1731078	Ridge Racer, PlayStation 3 will retail for $599 US dollars, $599 US dollars, $599 US dollars, giant enemy crab.
1731118	1732779	Those were all bad ideas.
1732799	1733840	Okay, bad ideas that didn't affect
1741184	1743606	The consumer really in any way.
1743827	1744567	$599 US dollars.
1744687	1746969	Then don't pay $599 US dollars.
1747069	1747990	It came down in price.
1748030	1749952	Did they launch their new system at $599 US dollars?
1749972	1750953	For the record.
1751233	1752054	No, it was not.
1752214	1753215	It was at $399.
1754296	1756638	And Microsoft is now launching at $499.
1757038	1758399	You'd think that they would learn the lesson.
1758940	1762523	But my thing is, even look at PlayStation Plus.
1762563	1765346	PlayStation Plus is $10 less a year.
1766446	1767567	And you get free games.
1768268	1768668	with that.
1769089	1770489	You get them on Xbox now.
1770789	1772270	But... Only until the launch of the system.
1772290	1777373	We did buy the most expensive release of it because, well, Dan managed GameStop.
1777593	1778193	We had the in.
1779094	1781655	But when we had the money for it, we put it down.
1782476	1784117	We wanted what they had to offer.
1784137	1785217	The backwards compatibility.
1785838	1787799	Well, definitely given our collection, yeah.
1787919	1793382	Fully backwards compatible at launch with Wi-Fi built in on one system, one version of it.
1793882	1794682	But, okay.
1794702	1795143	Okay.
1795883	1799465	But still, though, they paid for that with their poor sales and stuff.
1799485	1804668	So I think that they've made up for the fact that, you know, they basically don't want to repeat their mistakes.
1805108	1813272	However, I just don't see a lot of, like, you know, I don't see any decisions that they've made that have really affected the consumer poorly.
1813332	1815894	Like, you know, oh, hey, we're going to have this really weird DRM.
1816254	1817995	Okay, online passes, they did that.
1818375	1821217	First party online passes, which is a little ridiculous.
1821237	1821357	Mm-hmm.
1822598	1823199	So they did that.
1823259	1824560	So I guess that's a fault there.
1824680	1825501	They're not doing it anymore.
1825661	1826903	So they've corrected that mistake.
1828365	1837175	So I think they've taken all the negatives about their console and corrected their mistakes and trying to go fresh start for their new thing.
1837435	1839778	Whereas Microsoft said, hey, we had a pretty good ride.
1839818	1841440	Let's just see what we can do to...
1842621	1843341	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1861053	1879866	I don't remember one and I think I even said this last week before the reversal I don't remember a console war this good since the 90s and full page magazine ads that's like our system does but this one doesn't you know like this is popcorn.gif and yes I said gif deal with it alright
1881166	1881966	Okay, I'm sorry.
1882587	1886588	Bobby says, Microsoft made mistakes but corrected them, but fuck them.
1886728	1891730	No, they're still making mistakes right now, and it's a little different saying... You paraphrased the quote, but that's okay.
1892250	1892510	Whatever.
1894190	1898552	Okay, his exact quote was, Sony made mistakes but corrected them, so they're awesome.
1898592	1901533	Microsoft made mistakes but corrected them, but fuck them.
1901993	1903894	There's still a lot... I wish I didn't get to you.
1904234	1907535	There's still a lot... Yes, saying that came from me.
1908215	1930389	so there's still a lot though that they still have to fix that you know needs to be taken care of price point connect always required and basically just i don't know i just don't like the way that they're kind of looking at the consumers right now it's kind of it is very much like sony was back at the launch of the ps3 where it's like you're our consumers and not our customers
1932775	1945410	I was expected, though, that Microsoft, being a company of their size, would kind of look at, hmm, here's what didn't work for the other guy, so maybe we shouldn't try doing that too.
1945851	1950016	Instead of, it didn't work for them, but we're better, so we're going to make it work for us.
1950677	1951518	That's my thing.
1952634	1962621	Alright, let's get to the results of the live poll because I shut this off like a minute ago and haven't read the results Okay, here are the results of the live poll How do you feel about an Xbox One post their 180?
1963702	1967925	I'm surprised at these results Here we go, number one answer with 53.57% I'm still not buying it
1972604	1986635	0% not a single vote for I was going to buy one but now I'm not that doesn't surprise me much but that does tell me that even for the fans the whole family share and all that that wasn't the deal maker
1987395	1991636	There's upsetness over that, but it's not a done deal now that that's out of the picture.
1991796	1993596	That doesn't surprise me, but zero answers for that.
1994136	1995657	Here's how the rest of it breaks down.
1997257	2001158	32.14% for I was going to buy one anyway and still am.
2001638	2005018	So a third of the listeners buying an Xbox One, that's not too shabby.
2005758	2012180	And then 14.29% where my head's at, I wasn't going to buy one before, but now I am.
2012420	2013400	So I guess I am the 14.29%.
2015140	2027148	Well, I still want a PlayStation 4 just because I don't have to... Mainly because I play both at my work and at home, and I don't want to have to lug the system and a Kinect with me every time I'm going back and forth.
2027508	2030650	That's that reason, and it's $100 cheaper.
2031450	2034833	Also, all the first... And this applies for both Sony and Microsoft.
2034993	2039335	All their first-party exclusive titles, aside from the very two or three at launch...
2040376	2044157	All of the ones that I really wanted to play aren't coming out until sometime next year.
2044257	2049339	So I'm like, eh, I don't really feel the need to buy an Xbox One now for Sunset Overdrive.
2049359	2054741	Which, hey, by the time we get to next year, who knows how many of those titles are going to be delayed beyond next year.
2054861	2058902	So, Last of Us, or not Last of Us, The Last Guardian, anybody?
2059262	2061123	I mean, so, I don't know.
2061543	2065626	To be fair, again, Loki, Sony, same problems could be there.
2066286	2067087	I said for both.
2067167	2068168	I said it applies to both.
2068628	2071810	I am in the PlayStation 4 camp, and that's probably mostly for third-party games.
2072010	2073011	But, eh.
2073451	2073712	All right.
2074372	2076894	Anyway, we got to move on.
2077094	2077414	Thank you.
2077654	2078975	Great discussion and chat.
2079135	2084039	I haven't been able to read all the comments, but I've been kind of watching, so I just want to shout out live.vognetwork.com.
2084439	2088162	And if you haven't been here for a live show, you're missing out because some great, like...
2089082	2090844	Fourth host commentary going on in the chat.
2090864	2095108	I do want to say one thing, though, and this ties back to the PlayStation 3 launch.
2095188	2096989	Where the fuck is a new Ridge Racer game?
2097210	2102575	Because seriously, how many consoles have launched recently and not one single fucking Ridge Racer game?
2103235	2104897	That is the launch game.
2105197	2112604	I kind of think that between what I just played there and the Vita game, I think Ridge Racer may not kind of...
2113184	2115606	It may actually be viewed as a bit of a negative right now.
2115666	2117188	It may be not a game people want.
2117208	2118188	Because they have Bugbear doing it.
2118248	2119590	And Bugbear is pretty awesome.
2119610	2120070	They did that.
2120210	2121431	Microsoft's got Forza.
2121451	2123433	Sony's got this Drive Club.
2123553	2126515	They have a free-to-play Ridge Racer game that's coming.
2127036	2128257	I thought that was the Vita.
2128677	2132701	No, the Vita one was buy to play or buy to get four tracks.
2133762	2137465	But they do have a free-to-play one by Bugbear that's going to be a PC game.
2139166	2141188	But maybe they'll come to consoles as well.
2141383	2143124	Jamie, I'm looking at some of these comments in chat.
2143184	2151126	I didn't catch this whole thing, but I noticed ClericalEra404 talking about the Intellivision was technologically superior to the Atari.
2151366	2153027	You guys are kicking it old school in chat right now.
2153807	2164350	What that got started on is all of the comparisons about comparing it to a console war, but saying that these two are technologically similar to each other.
2165631	2169732	Well, we're going over the console war between the Genesis and the Super Nintendo, and
2170092	2182899	Super Nintendo technically was the technologically superior system and the games did cost more because they cost more to manufacture but they were in a stat to stat comparison technologically superior.
2183079	2187642	Then we went back to Intellivision versus Atari and I had a Clico vision which kicked all of them.
2187742	2189724	Think about the 80s though, man.
2190104	2192105	How many consoles do we have right now?
2192225	2193827	I guess maybe four.
2194327	2201593	You have your Xbox Ones, your PlayStation 4s, your Wii U, and then the Android boxes.
2201653	2203694	I'm going to lump all those in one category.
2204986	2207687	are kind of... Well, the reason why I bring that up is that you go back to the 80s.
2208007	2208467	Oh, my God.
2208568	2212609	It was consoles and family computers all battling each other.
2212629	2214210	I remember... Let's start with the 70s.
2214290	2219332	We had the first Odyssey, Fairchild Channel F. There was the... Well, no.
2219372	2223594	I'm just thinking about those magazine ads that you used to see where you would see the screenshots.
2223614	2232917	Like a Frogger would show you a screenshot from the Atari computer, Atari 2600, Commodore 64, TRS-80, Coleco, Intellivision, Apple.
2233138	2233258	Like...
2234198	2238424	There was a lot of fucking console... I guess they weren't really consoles, but...
2251381	2257545	There started to be that divergence between PC and console gaming, but everything always went into a big bottleneck of popularity.
2258086	2269093	While you might have had other systems out, things eventually slid back into the 8-bit era where it was the Master System versus the NES, and the NES really stomped Sega with that.
2269454	2272776	But then you had Genesis versus SNES, and then you had...
2274957	2290995	that's what I was saying is that you had NEC come in and put out their own system PC Engine in Japan which did a lot better over there than it did here and then you know then you start it just basically goes into this bottleneck you'll see other systems start to come around but now we're in this sort of
2292789	2312189	3 is the sweet number for consoles out 2-3 systems, it has to be that major competition and now we've got phone gaming, we have mobile gaming but really you're getting into the big 3 it bottlenecks, it's like big loops the way that the console thing goes and now we've got a full blown war again
2312369	2314830	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2339638	2343579	and the duties are hard.
2344699	2345819	They're fucking hard.
2347260	2360702	I have a level 13 thaumaturge and I have a... I just made it... Okay, I made a marauder because I wanted to see what pirate stuff looked like and I named her Vriska because she's blue.
2361182	2362163	Well, not blue, she's gray.
2362863	2363083	Anyway...
2363903	2366826	Um, so, uh, I've been playing that.
2366907	2377658	I've been playing, um, Mass Effect, I played some more Mass Effect 3 because I, uh, got all that high res stuff working and I actually have like a mostly high res, uh, Normandy interior now.
2378239	2379761	So I'm going to put that in.
2379801	2381523	I was basically just making sure all my mods worked.
2382103	2382243	Um...
2399232	2427307	I'm trying to go through I did not say duty, bite me chat room I've been looking through my other list of games but to be perfectly honest I have had zero energy all week because I've just had this flu that's kicked my ass and unfortunately I've been, well actually I'm not saying unfortunately because sleep is awesome I've been doing a lot of sleeping I'm playing sleep the game I'm
2428010	2428931	Achievement unlocked.
2428951	2429952	Achievement unlocked.
2430492	2432174	You slept for 24 hours.
2432674	2433335	Yes, I did.
2435536	2437258	All right, let me move on to our guests next.
2437618	2439980	You all are a bunch of five-year-olds.
2440341	2441141	You're done, right?
2442522	2443463	Oh, everybody in chat.
2444464	2446146	All right, let me go to JV Moncler.
2446166	2448047	What did the hero do in the bathroom?
2448107	2449068	He did his duty.
2450569	2452331	JV Mon, how was your gaming week?
2452938	2453519	It was pretty good.
2453539	2457625	I mean, all I have with me is my 3DS, so that's kind of all I've been playing.
2457685	2460870	I've been playing mostly just Kingdom Hearts, Dream Drop Distance.
2461291	2464155	You told me before the show you've never played an Animal Crossing game.
2464716	2465277	That is true.
2465297	2466199	I've never played an Animal Crossing.
2466219	2467060	The fuck is wrong with you?
2467140	2467581	No, I'm kidding.
2468722	2470204	It's like the furry Sims.
2470544	2472286	This is not the furry Sims.
2472326	2472867	Maybe a little bit.
2472887	2474588	It really isn't the furry Sims.
2474628	2474949	I don't know.
2474969	2479694	I never was given the game when it came out on GameCube.
2479834	2482156	So I didn't really care when it came out on DS or Wii.
2482817	2484599	So I kind of just don't care now.
2484619	2486201	Everybody's like, oh my God, Ammo Crossing.
2486261	2487482	And I was like, okay.
2489127	2489968	Hater's gonna hate.
2490348	2491069	I'm not hating.
2492310	2493731	It's not hate when you don't care.
2494112	2494832	Alright, fine.
2496054	2498115	You would rather get Apathy Crossing.
2498656	2499797	Sure, Apathy Crossing.
2502199	2504341	With the little penguin that just says dot dot dot.
2505442	2510147	No, if you're going by the Japanese version, Animal Forest, it would be like Animal Suicide Forest.
2511259	2512100	That's morbid.
2513481	2516504	I'm not against the concept of me playing Animal Crossing.
2516544	2519987	It's just that I'm not going to be the one to go out and buy it for myself.
2520047	2522469	If somebody wants to give me Animal Crossing, I'll play it.
2523129	2524631	Oh, you're being a Jamie right now.
2524911	2532217	I'm not going to buy Minecraft with my own money, but if someone wants to get it for me, I might fall in love with it.
2532377	2539223	But I've also been playing Earthbound on Android Emulator and I think that's
2539443	2540243	Plants vs. Zombies.
2540944	2546545	My best friend got me Plants vs. Zombies and my free time, my free time.
2546605	2548086	Oh God, what has happened to my free time?
2548726	2555148	Looking at some comments in chat at live.vognetwork.com SSJ100 Matt, I haven't played an Animal Crossing game before.
2555528	2558169	It must be a New York thing because you guys don't know what a forest is.
2559250	2560150	It must be something like that.
2561010	2567633	Koopa Kid Jonko says, I'm trying to watch the chat, listen to the show, and hunt beetles in Animal Crossing at the same time.
2567733	2568793	Media overload.
2570174	2571915	At least those are all awesome things to be doing.
2572716	2575637	And Brad from PodCulture says, I never played one either.
2575737	2576778	Tell this new one.
2577478	2578939	Welcome to Crack Forest.
2579359	2579660	Oh, no.
2579740	2585043	The first thing I'm going to do is save up a million bells and buy a crown so I can be the queen of my village.
2585563	2589445	I was excited because I finally got to replace a villager saying.
2589646	2591787	That's my favorite thing to do is to get them to say new things.
2592147	2596650	So in honor of Alan, Bree the Bunny now says, LOL butts after everything.
2597871	2600994	You had a character in my GameCube one saying bitch face.
2602315	2602675	Remember?
2602695	2602795	Maybe.
2602816	2604357	I may have done that.
2604417	2605918	And then you stole my lesbian.
2606439	2607200	Yeah.
2607240	2607740	I'm so mad.
2607880	2608361	I do that.
2608741	2609562	You stole my lesbian.
2611083	2611864	Anything else, Jamie?
2612985	2613986	Uh, no, I think that's about it.
2614526	2614886	Loki.
2616107	2632615	Um, I just played Final Fantasy XIV, um, well, yesterday, pretty much, um, and it's alright, I played it on the PlayStation 3, so the graphics are okay, I don't know if they're gonna be that great compared to the PC, though, obviously not.
2633715	2635236	Um, but it was fun.
2635537	2649365	I am a level 8 Black Mage, because I'm not gonna fucking refer to their... The classes that have been in the goddamn franchise for how many years now, and we're all of a sudden gonna flip them on... Here's the deal, here's the deal.
2649565	2653407	There are Black Mages, like, called a Black Mage in Final Fantasy XIV.
2653427	2654248	It's BLM.
2654748	2659752	Yeah, you don't see them yet because they had to rear-end that into the game.
2659792	2662134	They had to back-park that into the game.
2662194	2670321	Because yes, the original creators of XIV were smoking crack and made up all these new classes like Thaumaturge, Gladiator, and all this stuff that wasn't very Final Fantasy XIV.
2670701	2676986	But when the fans bitched and moaned and complained, now the Black Mage and White Mage, they're there, but they're advanced classes.
2677427	2681870	So at least in old XIV, I think when you got like a Thaumaturge to XX,
2682971	2685793	and Conjurer to 10, you could become a Black Mage.
2685853	2689936	I might be screwing up those numbers, but those jobs do exist later.
2690176	2691677	They're just considered the advanced jobs.
2691958	2695480	So to be fair, Loki, amongst your anger... As I said, level 8 Black Mage.
2696040	2700303	And basically, I am spamming Blizzard to win.
2700684	2702085	And that's kind of...
2703426	2725242	and I have Thunder now and I guess Thunder is like DPS or something and I let my son play the game for a while so there was a good portion where he was running into a wall and jumping in a fountain and I had a video of that but my wife doesn't want me to post it on the internet because she's in it and she doesn't like being in any of the videos
2725971	2727972	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2747197	2754441	and everything is like one of those horses things that you jump over and gym equipment and everything.
2754862	2755842	Her room was a gym.
2756943	2758464	And her house was playing K.K.
2758504	2759004	Lilith Fair.
2759423	2766146	Yeah, it was playing some music or the other that sounded really, you know, very SJW now, I guess.
2766326	2776070	But so we put a rainbow sign outside her house and we like had her say something that was like super gay.
2776130	2776691	I don't know.
2777471	2780832	Because we were just being really awful because she was so stereotypical.
2781013	2781253	Yeah.
2781313	2782633	And we just called her our lesbian.
2782753	2785314	Admittedly, these were horrible stereotypes.
2785454	2788776	But, you know, if you can't poke fun at each other, what can you do?
2789142	2791123	Exactly.
2794423	2797004	Everyone I ever showed this character to said, is she a lesbian?
2797784	2799444	So she ended up being the town lesbian.
2800405	2801305	Apparently she's the only one.
2801325	2801925	She couldn't get a date.
2802865	2805586	I mean, if someone had moved into the house with her, then we would have known.
2805766	2806226	Yeah, right.
2807086	2808066	Bad stereotypes, I know.
2809067	2811427	So anyway, Rob stole her.
2811547	2812388	Rob stole my lesbian.
2812448	2813268	But I got her back.
2814608	2815088	Thank you for watching!
2836039	2836279	Really?
2836299	2837600	The guy's awesome, actually.
2838241	2840422	I don't know if he's British.
2840622	2841403	He kind of looks British.
2841483	2845085	How do you look British?
2845445	2846366	He's extra.
2846786	2848247	He looks like the guy.
2848267	2852450	Welcome to Stereotype Lounge Radio.
2852470	2853771	He walks in with some crumpets.
2853971	2855232	He sounds British.
2855932	2858174	Does he like his beans on toast?
2858314	2859295	He sounds British.
2859455	2863638	Did you just order a fucking crumpet?
2863698	2864938	Get out of here, you dirty Brit.
2866419	2872725	And I hate even referring back to this, but only because I had to watch the whole series of this damn show.
2873005	2874846	He looks like the husband on Medium, okay?
2874866	2875427	Are you the doctor?
2875607	2877689	Do you have to take a lift to get up to the classroom?
2879210	2880231	Do you walk on the pavement?
2882753	2883493	Are you the doctor?
2886216	2888698	It's like I totally forgot what Loki was trying to really say.
2889258	2890279	Look at my face!
2890479	2891300	I ain't bothered!
2892161	2893001	Alright, moving on.
2893061	2893442	My turn.
2894358	2896359	So, games that I've been playing this week.
2896899	2898939	I've also been playing the Final Fantasy XIV beta.
2899239	2901200	And let me tell you, y'all, it's really good.
2901560	2902440	I love it.
2902940	2906641	And I was trying to spend some time thinking about why do I love this game so much.
2906661	2907981	Because I liked XI too.
2908462	2909522	I liked XI an awful lot.
2909542	2910442	I played it for three years.
2910802	2913923	But XI felt like a PC MMO.
2914603	2919105	And I'm going to use that analogy, back-parked again into a PlayStation 2.
2919705	2927429	I realize 11 was a very heavily played on PlayStation 2 in Japan, but it really always felt like a PC.
2927529	2939374	One thing real quick I was going to mention on console, because I don't know if you guys are playing with PC controllers or whatever, keyboard, mouse, and stuff, but the macro system that they have now with the shoulder buttons and stuff is fucking awesome on the console.
2939434	2939694	Yeah.
2941435	2945276	I was going to say, Final Fantasy XIV plays like a console game on the PC.
2945657	2953540	This truly feels like I'm playing a console Final Fantasy game where there just happens to be other people running around and we can go do dungeons together if we want.
2953960	2956501	We can do the guild quest things if we want.
2956541	2957202	We can do all that.
2957342	2959883	Or I could just play it myself and enjoy the story.
2960983	2963344	I really think this new producer kind of gets it.
2963605	2966046	You see it in the last letter that he put out there.
2966286	2967346	That was long.
2967366	2968127	If you really read it,
2969187	2976474	Yeah, he's really trying to talk about, you know, there's a lot of people out there that are afraid to play MMOs because they're like, ooh, other people.
2977174	2981818	So we wanted to create a story that would work without other people.
2982519	2984220	But we weren't necessarily going to make it easy.
2984921	2989205	And I thought that was a great way to approach it, and that's how the game really feels to me.
2990026	2995052	What was the comment about you get caught up in the story of each town?
2996514	3004504	And I really like that each town has its own sort of politics around that area instead of, oh, can you go take this letter to Ironforge?
3005645	3008267	Yeah, the dwarves are doing this, but we live in Stormwind.
3008668	3009108	Fuck them.
3010649	3013611	Basically, you don't have to do the big town hopping thing.
3013711	3015933	You work in your community around your town.
3016553	3021617	And then when you've exhausted your area around your town, then it's logical to move on.
3022578	3023819	Well, I'm just going to level over here now.
3025063	3029584	The one thing that's really interesting to me, this game has potential to be a huge hit.
3029924	3035626	I'm not going to say wow killer because I really think there's room at the table for more than one online game.
3035646	3037246	There's lots of online games people play.
3038127	3046749	I think Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn has the potential to be a huge game, which is interesting because it's not the first time they've released the game, which is a whole other story.
3047409	3055075	The problem is going to be that subscription fee and convincing people that, yes, to run around and play a solo game, I'm going to pay $15 a night.
3055396	3056477	I'm convinced.
3057337	3060260	I'm convinced, too, but there's going to be a lot of people that aren't.
3060480	3066705	I'm not, and the reason why is because there's other MMOs out there that I've played that just are that one-time...
3068646	3072949	What new content are they really adding on a regular basis other than server upkeep?
3073790	3077412	There's other games that you can buy at once and play it.
3078553	3087098	I can't dedicate enough time every month to playing this game when I'm playing a ton of stuff to justify paying a monthly subscription.
3087638	3095824	I'm very curious to see what Endgame looks like because that's going to be the make or break for this game is convincing people once they beat the single player campaign to keep paying for this game.
3096604	3097084	You know what I mean?
3097465	3098145	So we'll see.
3098185	3098505	We'll see.
3098746	3099186	I love it.
3100187	3100527	We'll see.
3100747	3104549	I did have to say in looking at, and again, I didn't try it on PS3.
3104670	3107411	I didn't want to bother with it because I can't use the controller anyway.
3108212	3116457	I did look at video comparisons and to be honest, I think that the PS3 version is going to, it suffers.
3117619	3118883	in the visual department.
3118984	3120610	I have a really important question for everybody.
3120650	3123661	Can somebody please explain to me why this bottle of Patron is still sealed?
3125186	3125846	Super Mario Bros.
3125866	3126706	U Super Luigi Brothers U
3153283	3159372	It really threw me at first because I'm like, Nintendo DLC, this is so weird.
3159513	3165041	I know they had the levels on the 3DS one, but to do it on a console, I was like, this is so weird.
3165482	3166423	But here it is, you guys.
3167004	3168586	It's the exact same map.
3169547	3173309	All the stages in the map have been redone when you play as Luigi.
3173389	3176170	And it's really cute because they threw in some allusions to Luigi.
3176510	3182493	Like there's Luigi shapes in the dirt that you see, like little Luigi fossils or something.
3182773	3185674	You see little statues of Luigi made out of the bush.
3185894	3187115	And they're not all obvious.
3187415	3189435	Like some of them are kind of very subtle.
3189816	3192897	So I really kind of like that they threw all those nods to Luigi in there.
3193477	3198159	But anyway, every level is redone and you only have 100 seconds to clear each level.
3198519	3204301	So honestly, Super Luigi U is like a really good ROM hack that Nintendo endorses.
3204642	3205642	That's not a bad thing.
3206963	3207903	I think it's pretty cool.
3208723	3212464	20 bucks, a little hefty, but it's very, very robust.
3212524	3214685	I mean, it is every single level start to finish.
3215285	3223688	Granted, you only have the 100 seconds, but I think there's going to be a lot of people that are up for the challenge of not only can I clear the level, can I get all three coins?
3223708	3229390	Because some of them are really hard, and it's going to take that Mega Man level of muscle memory in order to be able to do it.
3229690	3233371	And I think there's a lot of people that want that difficulty out of a Mario Bros.
3233411	3233611	game.
3233911	3234632	So here you go.
3235152	3235472	Enjoy.
3236981	3239982	Game Guru in chat says, now it's Luigi's time to shine.
3240283	3241543	Nabbit steals all the power-ups.
3241643	3242163	Dang, Nabbit.
3242884	3246085	Yeah, Nabbit is still, that whole thing is actually still in the game.
3246285	3247206	But you know what else is weird?
3247246	3252068	Because since Mario's not in it, you have Luigi, the two toads, and Nabbit is the fourth player.
3252468	3254249	So you could have Nabbit chasing Nabbit.
3254309	3254929	It's very meta.
3256550	3261652	But Nabbit actually is the kind of easy mode in the game because Nabbit can't die.
3262292	3262732	Oh, really?
3262792	3263232	I didn't know that.
3264153	3264333	Oh.
3264773	3264993	Hmm.
3265553	3267113	I haven't switched away from Luigi.
3267214	3267594	Interesting.
3268354	3272355	TigerClaw reminding us Super Luigi U is also going to be a standalone product as well.
3272755	3276897	You know, I got to give props to Nintendo for really dummy-proofing their DLC.
3277417	3283699	Like, they're not trying to make an easy buck off of somebody stupid because, you know, when you go into the store to download it, it says...
3284199	3286580	Do you own Super Mario Bros.
3286640	3287160	Wii U?
3287460	3288960	You cannot play this without it.
3289180	3291981	And you have to hit, yes, I own it, in order to download it.
3292461	3301202	And it even says, if you download this, or no, it says, if you own the disc of Super Luigi U, you do not need to download this.
3301242	3302023	They are the same.
3302483	3307404	Like, there's a lot of little reminders in there, and I thought, wow, they're really idiot-proofing this so they don't get any angry phone calls.
3307704	3309424	Although somebody's still gonna fuck up.
3309884	3310404	You know it.
3310604	3313645	I think Nintendo's MO, though, is, you know, CYA.
3314544	3315606	True, cover your assets.
3316567	3321333	Koopa Kid, Jeremy in chat pointing out, Nabbit can die in pits, but otherwise invincible.
3321633	3322795	You know what the trick is, though?
3322815	3327981	Get that baby Yoshi and do his little, get the pink one where when you hit the trigger, he blows up like a balloon.
3328642	3330484	So easy to get through a lot of levels of that.
3330885	3331386	Just saying.
3332046	3332427	Good times.
3332507	3332747	All right.
3333668	3337650	GameGuru says, I gotta admit, Nintendo's first attempt at DLC is rather admirable.
3337971	3343794	To be fair, the Gold Coins, Super Mario 2, I can't even keep them straight anymore.
3344114	3345395	That was the first DLC.
3345515	3347156	But first console DLC, yes.
3347836	3348176	There you go.
3349177	3351939	Alright, that's it for Gaming Weeks.
3352439	3353159	We gotta move on.
3353219	3354720	We've got stories to get into.
3356465	3359326	Well, we got this bottle of Patron to open here.
3359506	3360646	I need my one shot.
3360726	3365728	But first, we gotta do housekeeping, and I've got a lot of housekeeping tonight, so I'll try to make this quick.
3366328	3370010	First off, I have to give a wink and a nod to the fact that it is our 11th birthday.
3370610	3373571	Thank you all, OL Army, for your support of this show.
3374151	3377712	And, you know, we may not have the biggest audience on the internet, but we have some of the most loyal.
3378012	3383094	And you guys are amazing, and you turn up here Sunday nights, and you are really our motivation for still doing this.
3383214	3385815	I mean, OLR will have to end someday.
3386255	3387016	I'm not saying tomorrow.
3387056	3387796	I'm not saying next.
3387836	3388396	Don't panic.
3389037	3393159	But I'm just saying it's going to end someday because eventually somebody's going to move away.
3393479	3394340	There's going to be a job.
3394540	3398082	There's just going to be something where we're not going to be able to do the show anymore.
3398623	3407288	But we couldn't have kept it going as long as we have and had the discipline and the motivation to be here every Sunday if it weren't for your guys and your continued support.
3407708	3410190	And it really feels like our family grows every week.
3410270	3413291	I see new people in chat every week and it's amazing.
3413331	3413592	And it's...
3414312	3415193	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3439672	3440733	Other things I want to plug.
3441313	3447057	I would like to give a shout out, and many of them are in chat, so I'm just going to say holla to the Koopa Club podcast.
3447157	3449078	They spell it a little funky, so let me spell that for you.
3449158	3460646	It's Q-O-O-P-A-K-L-U-B, and you can search that on iTunes or what have you, whatever podcasting site, because they had me as a guest on their 25th episode this week.
3460666	3464308	So would it be like it's all the Koopa kids except they're played by John Delancey?
3465495	3467636	Yes, it's just like that, actually.
3468636	3468856	What?
3469136	3470756	All right, so yeah, check that out.
3470796	3473037	I was on their latest episode, and it was a lot of fun.
3473537	3476598	And they asked me some dirty questions about Nintendo.
3476618	3480079	It was a very Nintendo love episode, and the last question was a little bit dirty.
3480919	3485120	They made me pick the Mary Fuck Kill from the Nintendo World, so I'm going to just leave it at that.
3485600	3486060	So there you go.
3488181	3507237	Also, since I brought up Koopa Club, I want to give a shout out to Gamer X, because I haven't been plugging this enough on Orange Lounge Radio, but if you're in Northern California, especially the Bay Area, you've got to go to Gamer X. That's going to be on August 3rd and August 4th, and it's taking place, I forget the name of the hotel, but it's Japan Town.
3507857	3508458	Oh, Miyako.
3508838	3510640	Yeah, it's that whole district.
3511440	3513222	It's the side that's the Miyako Mall, right?
3514178	3515839	Can I just say why Alan is perfect?
3515979	3518421	By the way, those are peanut butter chocolate brownies.
3518641	3520402	Alan, you just got home from work.
3520602	3520803	Yes.
3520963	3522104	You literally walked through the door.
3522264	3522484	Yes.
3522624	3523885	What's the first place you went to?
3524525	3529649	I went into the kitchen and got shot glasses and put them on the dining room table because I was listening to the feed from my phone.
3530309	3534732	So as I'm coming through the apartment complex, I hear, we need to drink the Patron.
3534752	3535733	Why is the Patron still closed?
3535793	3537894	I'm like, I have to grab the shot glasses as soon as I walk through the door.
3538215	3538535	So I did.
3540519	3541199	He's so wonderful.
3541219	3542040	Alan wins a brownie.
3542100	3542640	Here, have one.
3542860	3543600	Have a brownie.
3543760	3544261	Alright, anyway.
3544661	3545321	Where was I?
3545421	3554625	Oh yeah, Gamer X. So Gamer X on Saturday night with Koopa Club and Game Buoy and my other show Horde House and Game Bar and God knows who else.
3555045	3561008	We're going to be doing like a podcast panel and it's going to just be a big party and celebrating indie podcasting.
3561548	3582834	and you can do it too so uh yeah check that out at GamerX and um don't be shy say hello because we're all like regular people and we want to meet cool people and if you listen to this show and you made it this far chances are you're a cool person oh my god Rob I should cosplay you should we can cosplay as I don't know probably do something you should go as your Animal Crossing lesbian
3583544	3583824	No.
3585185	3589426	Because I figured if it's me, I have to do something annoying, so I'm going to Homestuck.
3590607	3591007	Ha ha.
3591687	3591967	All right.
3592968	3593268	Anyhow.
3595108	3597209	And also, I want to put this out there.
3597249	3599210	So GamerX, Koopa Club, and one last thing.
3599550	3612055	If you were listening to the show last week, Bobby Blackwolf, our friend and pal who does the show before ours every Sunday night at 5 o'clock Pacific, 8 o'clock Eastern, his house was struck by lightning in the middle of our show last week.
3612695	3615417	and he lost a lot of video game consoles because of it.
3616057	3622841	I'm not going to repeat the whole thing because you can see his post that will catch you up on it on our vognetwork.com forums.
3623401	3626923	You can also listen to it on his show, kind of the wrap-up and everything and it just...
3628038	3636425	Dude's been going through a lot this week, and to have lightning hit your fucking house, I'm so glad that so many people were able to help him out.
3636805	3640267	However, I'm bringing it up because Bobby still needs help with one thing.
3640888	3650075	He has a Neo Geo AES US version, and he's trying to get this repaired because it did suffer damage, but it is repairable.
3650515	3657581	He says he could do it himself, but he doesn't really have time, so he would love to be able to ship this out, PayPal your money, have you ship it back.
3658915	3667843	I did suggest earlier, seeing if you could find out who it was, that the guy who runs Classic Game Room had an NBS, but the boards are similar.
3668243	3678872	Well, my hope is that one of our listeners, maybe who doesn't talk to us an awful lot, who just listens to this show, my hope is somebody sitting out there going, I do that, or my friend owns a shop and they do that.
3679212	3681554	My hope is that somebody out there is listening that could do that.
3681974	3684175	Someone could be sleeping in a bed of AES boards
3712702	3714223	He can come to my house!
3715604	3717406	Bobby, come to my house and bring all your games.
3717426	3718146	We'll have a party.
3718347	3721529	Well, I think it's actually more of a physical thing.
3721569	3723551	You can switch the... There's a switch on the games themselves, I think.
3723631	3725452	Because our Samurai Shodown 2 is Japanese.
3740194	3742476	I don't know shit about Neo Geos because I never owned one.
3742516	3743777	I only played them in the arcade.
3744017	3746659	Unless it's to do modified MBS cartridges.
3746719	3747080	I don't know.
3747540	3750743	I have a couple of Neo Geo arcade boards.
3751083	3753385	One is modded to play all region stuff.
3753585	3756747	And I have a 48-in-1 cart.
3757248	3762993	And I have a super gun that would plug into that that takes Neo Geo controllers.
3763713	3764174	There you go.
3764214	3765394	There's a killer combo right there.
3766255	3766515	All right.
3766555	3769557	Well, I'm hoping that Bobby gets what he needs.
3769617	3775822	He also mentions the video mod that will put it over S video component and a BIOS mod to affect the lives and stuff.
3775842	3777323	Those are the types of mods he's looking for.
3778323	3778603	All right.
3778784	3779464	Good luck, Bobby.
3780204	3786749	We all are hoping to see you get through that and get your consoles even better than they were before lightning hit your house.
3787229	3788890	All right.
3788910	3789951	7.15 and we have yet to hit the news.
3789991	3792413	So let's jump into a busy week in gaming news.
3792653	3792913	Loki.
3793733	3795174	And this bottle is still closed.
3796175	3800559	Don Matrick
3820536	3825338	It's a lower number than some of the analysts had forecasted.
3825418	3828239	We're over delivering value against other choices.
3828599	3835561	I think consumers can get any modern product these days.
3835701	3839082	You're going to look at it, and $4.99 isn't a ridiculous price point.
3839322	3844684	We're delivering thousands of dollars of value to people, so I think they're going to love it when they use it.
3845504	3858893	So he's basically comparing the $4.99 price point of the Xbox One as kind of like an iPad or something like that, which is a terrible comparison if you ask me.
3859333	3863776	Because, I mean, that's apples and oranges right there versus, you know, game consoles.
3864697	3866418	That's like saying, hey, well, you know what?
3866478	3867699	This console only costs $4.99.
3867759	3868739	I mean, at least it's not a $30,000 car, right?
3868759	3869380	You know, it's way cheaper.
3874952	3875913	Such a lightweight, Rob.
3876093	3879857	Behind the scenes, Rob has done... I have a voice now thanks to tequila.
3881419	3881979	Sorry, Loki.
3882019	3885523	I've totally not been paying attention because we all did a shot while you were reading that story.
3886043	3887184	And that burned so much.
3887204	3892369	I've been doing gay flappy hands around the house while... Just flailing around everywhere.
3893030	3893851	It burns!
3895152	3895593	Oh my god.
3895873	3896734	I'm warm.
3897975	3898716	Meanwhile, I'm sitting here going...
3899815	3901715	I don't usually do shots of hard alcohol.
3901755	3902536	This is Alan, by the way.
3902996	3905316	I've never done a shot of tequila before.
3905476	3909437	It's not as bad as the time I tried a shot of 151, which I was tricked into doing.
3910377	3911518	That's Patron.
3911858	3912538	That's way better.
3913218	3916199	That's the stuff that doesn't... Rob totally got the shivers.
3918239	3920300	Patron is the only tequila that doesn't give me the shivers.
3920640	3926461	I was going to get a little glasses of orange juice in case anyone needs a chaser because I don't know how much it burns, but that was actually very smooth.
3928599	3930540	Kubica Jeremy in chat says, Vine it, Rob.
3930600	3931761	I wish I thought to do that.
3931821	3932882	I guess I'll have to take another shot.
3934223	3935244	Yay, more shots.
3935704	3936145	Bummer.
3936305	3939387	Actually, next up is Fireball because we've still got some of that.
3939547	3940728	Kind of scared about that one.
3940828	3941529	All right, here we go.
3941629	3943350	Anyway, where were we, Loki?
3947233	3948735	Summarize for me real quick.
3948775	3949035	Sorry.
3949758	3952440	What if she asked if I had a Neo Geo emulator?
3952480	3954201	Yes, I do have an emulator for Neo Geo stuff.
3954261	3958725	No, I'm talking actually an MVS board, like arcade Neo Geo boards.
3959085	3966670	I have two single slot arcade boards because I got one with my arcade cabinet and then another one because I don't know why.
3966831	3968092	Because I need to buy another one, I guess.
3969753	3975176	All right, so basically they're saying they're defending the price saying, oh, it's a wonderful piece of electronics.
3975276	3985462	And so $4.99 is not that bad when you compare it to like an iPad or something like that, which I say is a terrible comparison because, you know, they're very different devices.
3990232	3993555	Do you think this decision is going to single-handedly damn the device?
3993575	3995797	Because that's how you were talking earlier in the show.
3996337	4000521	It's definitely going to hurt it because basically now people are comparing the two consoles that are coming out.
4000561	4007547	You have one that spec-wise is more powerful than the other one, that would be the PS4, and it's cheaper and doesn't require Kinect.
4007987	4035243	and I know for some people that you know the fact that you're not getting Kinect in there is kind of you know they're looking at it well you know you still have to buy the camera for the PlayStation 4 and that's gonna be an extra 60 bucks but a lot of people just don't give a shit about that camera and aren't planning on using it anyways same as like you know those people like myself that probably would get you know an Xbox One with the Kinect and not use the Kinect because unless it's like a dancing game or something that you know really relies on it
4035663	4036704	I think you would have an easier time
4052117	4058119	Selling it for $500 if they really showed why that Kinect is so important.
4058239	4067622	Just like how Nintendo did with the Wii, showing why controlling games like this is way better than controlling it with a controller.
4067822	4079626	You know what I would love from a perfectly selfish, I don't care about talking about this on the show because I totally just had a shot, type of standpoint is that if this whole thing about Twitch integration and all that with the Kinect...
4080286	4084608	Wouldn't that be great if we could broadcast our show over the Xbox 360?
4085528	4090631	Or over the Xbox One, excuse me, with Kinect and that whole thing?
4090651	4091791	Because of the Twitch integration?
4092031	4092652	Could we do that?
4094252	4097054	The problem would be you'd have to have some sort of gameplay on there.
4097074	4098634	You can't just broadcast.
4098674	4099475	We used to do that.
4100135	4129567	I know when we had the larger studio you could technically do that because they have it where it's going to pick up audio from the game and it's going to pick up audio from you as well so you could probably rig it somehow to do that I guess it would probably be easier to do that through like a PC though but I guess you could point a camera at it but I mean you could kind of do that now with like Skype or something I guess point a camera at whatever we're doing
4131539	4133340	But, I don't know.
4133620	4134621	I just think that it's ridiculous.
4135362	4136162	Okay, so other stuff.
4136182	4136983	Let's talk about other things.
4137003	4151813	We already mentioned, of course, Kinect's always required, and they're saying that they're not planning on offering the system without the Kinect because it is a core part of the experience, and because I think at this point it's too late to change any of that stuff.
4151853	4155115	I have bad news that's very important that we have to discuss.
4155375	4155735	What?
4155995	4161339	I was reminded by Alan that last time we were entertaining friends, we drank the rest of the Fireball.
4163121	4164642	I'm very sorry, JV Mon.
4165022	4166564	You came out here for nothing.
4167385	4171188	But I would like to say to PodCulture, thanks.
4173550	4175712	I was like, we really finished that whole thing off?
4175792	4178955	But yeah, I guess we did between the 500th episode and all that.
4179836	4180357	Sorry, Loki.
4180457	4184521	And also the other thing that should be mentioned is nothing has changed as far as cloud computing.
4185041	4194443	So whereas, yes, there will be games that can play offline, a lot of them will be online only because they require cloud computing.
4194883	4197824	And I think that also goes for the PlayStation 4 as well.
4198404	4201885	They are able to use cloud computing for their titles as well.
4202225	4205206	So you could still have a SimCity-esque game on the Xbox.
4205226	4206326	Yes, you could have a lot of that.
4207026	4208287	I'm never going to stop calling it the 360.
4208327	4208527	The 361.
4208587	4209347	You're never going to...
4213328	4214868	You're still going to have games like SimCity.
4215509	4216449	You could, yeah.
4217109	4218469	Because we all see how well that went.
4219269	4221650	But I guess it still sold tons.
4221670	4222390	But here's the thing, though.
4223030	4229732	If it's such a big deal or if it's such a problem with those cloud computing things, people are going to be made aware of it.
4230032	4238214	People are going to say, hey, you guys, watch out because the next Forza or whatever is going to be something that requires cloud computing.
4238294	4242295	And if their servers go down, your cars are going to start murdering people or something.
4242315	4242715	I don't know.
4243235	4247936	So, I think that there's going to be a lot of awareness out there.
4248117	4250137	And also, it's probably something that's on the box.
4250257	4251718	Lots of interesting stuff in chat.
4252178	4255199	ShadowNextGen says, The PlayStation camera is so screwed.
4255539	4260880	Developers won't be able to assume people have it and might get the same type of support PlayStation Moved received.
4260980	4262281	That is to say, not much.
4263281	4269586	I'm with you and I'm not because I still feel like at E3, it looks like it's not getting any support anyway.
4270166	4277291	I get as far as the core elements, and I'm using my quotey fingers of the console when it comes to watching TV with friends and other stuff like it has it.
4277712	4281655	And so you can assume that anybody with an Xbox One is going to have that, but I...
4282995	4286917	I have yet to see how that really positively impacts games.
4287037	4288058	I hope that's coming.
4288118	4296762	I don't think that's really a big deal though because once again, like with Kinect even, even though we know that that system uses Kinect all the time.
4298097	4298517	and DarkSakura.com.
4321497	4325401	But, you know, if they're already doing this, what's the big deal if it may not be in there?
4325421	4327764	Just, you know, prepare for both scenarios.
4328304	4330026	I think camera usage is not a big deal.
4330186	4331888	It's back when the 360 was.
4332088	4335292	We can't assume that they have a hard drive was a problem.
4335572	4338035	So just throwing it out there for the live listeners.
4338175	4340057	Apparently our stream just keeps dropping.
4340257	4341919	And again, our stream's junk.
4342179	4342479	I don't know.
4342580	4343721	Oh God, it's doing it again.
4343741	4344562	This is horrible.
4346724	4348966	I tried to just... I did a reconnect from scratch.
4349026	4350548	It like dropped twice in a row there.
4350568	4352129	I just did a reconnect from scratch.
4353050	4356253	I hope that keeps... I reset the internet before the show and everything.
4356313	4356834	I don't get it.
4357074	4357534	I'm a witness.
4357555	4358756	Oh my God, it just went down again.
4360114	4360814	This is horrible.
4361495	4362935	Our stream is a whore.
4363235	4364496	I don't know what to do, you guys.
4364616	4365676	This is really bad.
4365796	4366717	Does she keep going down?
4366877	4367817	She does keep going down.
4367977	4368698	This is it.
4368998	4373100	That's like three times in the scope of like one minute that it went down.
4373180	4375241	And me drinking is not helping any.
4376701	4378302	So, I don't know.
4379442	4380163	Thanks, NSA.
4381183	4385445	Everybody's got their... Alan, you're not running torrents, are you?
4386673	4387394	He says no.
4388294	4388835	Alright.
4389615	4390476	Sorry, guys.
4390716	4391997	I wish we could fix this.
4392037	4393058	I don't know what else to do.
4395580	4396220	I'm thinking.
4397561	4401404	I honestly can't afford any new computer parts right now.
4401684	4405447	I'm like, we could replace that router because that one's really old.
4406968	4409410	But anyway, I guess this is a conversation best had off air.
4410771	4411192	Sorry, guys.
4411212	4414334	Talk to me after.
4415242	4416643	Okay, yeah, that might be a good thing.
4417424	4422507	Alright, well, I'm sorry, but there's literally not on our end.
4422547	4424989	We're not running torrents or anything that would interrupt the stream.
4425029	4426249	This is not reasonable.
4426329	4429411	Two, the other thing is, you know, notice we're not dropping out of chat.
4429632	4430792	It's not anything.
4430892	4431533	It's not us.
4431833	4433034	It's the host.
4433482	4435663	Yeah, I hate to say it.
4435703	4437164	We might need to think about another host.
4437644	4438224	This keeps up.
4439485	4441366	But anyway, that's a conversation for another day.
4442906	4443987	Should we move on with the next story?
4444007	4444607	Are we good?
4444867	4445447	Yeah.
4445648	4445928	All right.
4446448	4449569	The free-to-play franchise out of Nintendo has been announced.
4449629	4450730	It's Steel Diver.
4450950	4451390	Boo!
4451530	4451850	Bleh!
4454586	4455367	and DarkSakura.
4476583	4477123	I don't know.
4478004	4482326	I can't really think of another lame Nintendo first party title that was on the 3DS.
4482366	4483606	Steel Diver was pretty bad.
4484006	4487948	I mean, Pilotwings would be kind of second... I don't know.
4488368	4490449	Do free-to-play Nintendogs or something like that.
4490469	4493810	At least then you could charge DLC for like collars and bullshit hats.
4495271	4522090	well I kind of understand though that you want to dip your big toe into this big scary new world which is free to play with a game that maybe not a lot of you know that doesn't like you don't want to fuck up Pokemon like you're not going to take one of your big big franchises into the free to play world I agree with something maybe like Pilotwings or you know as much as my fanboy self would love it something like F-Zero going free to play would be great you know but I understand that Nintendo has to kind of test this first before they can really do it you know
4523314	4524715	Let's test it with crap.
4524775	4529338	So is this coming to the Wii U, or is this just 3DS still?
4530479	4532181	I believe this is still only 3DS.
4532741	4536123	You got Tank Tank Tank on the Wii U, although that's third party.
4536444	4540807	Yeah, that's still part of that whole Namco experimenting with free plays.
4540827	4543129	And it's more just a glorified demo, honestly.
4544350	4547172	Was Steel Diver that big of a 3DS property?
4547192	4552437	It was like, hey, out of all the things we can make a free-to-play game, how about Steel Diver?
4552577	4554739	No, and I think that's why it is this game.
4554920	4559724	Because, again, if it fucks up and crashes and burns horribly, oh well, it was Steel Diver.
4559744	4562187	So it's only Steel Diver's reputation that got shat on.
4562287	4562807	Exactly.
4563007	4567812	And I think with a big thing like this, that's the type of game that you have to do it with, right?
4567832	4568352	I don't know.
4569253	4580476	Well, let me throw this out there, though, that Nintendo is open to the idea of other free-to-play games, one of them mentioned by the lead designer named Katsuya Iguchi of Animal Crossing.
4581136	4583077	Possibly a free-to-play Animal Crossing.
4583577	4585337	That's a dangerous combination.
4585437	4588198	Which would have the dreaded microtransactions.
4589138	4613375	They have to just consider what would be free at the beginning Nintendo would have to have a business model that works Here's the quote I think the main thing that we need to think about before even considering doing something like that Is to determine what we're going to make available from the beginning I think that's key in deciding whether we do something like that If I find a business model that works, however, that works for Nintendo and the end user Then I can't say free-to-play is something we wouldn't consider
4613875	4614496	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4630256	4638838	I kind of like the pay to play Animal Crossing because I like the fact that one great thing about the new Animal Crossing is how new features kind of slowly roll out to your town.
4639319	4641459	I would really hate it if I had to pay for that.
4641859	4648241	So I would hope if they go to free to play route with a game like Animal Crossing that you can also just buy the game up front.
4648661	4652162	Like Killer Instinct on Xbox One we were talking about last week.
4652542	4656063	You know, it's getting a lot of shit for the free to play thing but you can just buy it all at once too.
4656603	4658504	Either one of those would be great.
4659364	4660225	Moving on, DarkSakura
4682567	4690112	In fact, he was talking about the sort of casual game where you could play it in short bursts and pick it up at any given time.
4690533	4699398	And that's why he's saying Tomodachi Collection, which anyone who doesn't know Tomodachi means friend, saying that that would be definitely a title to consider.
4701020	4710453	We're looking also into wanting to work with the retailers to make sure that they can provide the games in the best format possible.
4710493	4712696	So that's even including digital or physical.
4716000	4717002	What do you think about these comments?
4717748	4719129	I would like to see Tomodachi Collection.
4719189	4721390	I mean, if I had a Wii U, I would be interested.
4721490	4726352	That was the same game that we were talking about the other week that had the bug where you could get gay married in it.
4726592	4727252	Yeah.
4727693	4730574	It sounded interesting, especially with Animal Crossing being as big as it is.
4730614	4731854	I would have married my lesbian.
4733835	4734476	Who wouldn't?
4734876	4738217	I shipped my little kid and the lesbian.
4738838	4739498	Of course you did.
4739538	4740358	Of course I did.
4740438	4742579	Have you seen Reggie's House in Animal Crossing, by the way?
4742659	4742960	No.
4743200	4744520	Comedy.
4744700	4745341	Google it.
4745541	4745941	It's funny.
4747467	4756892	Someone posted a picture a while back of saying, oh, your house is top-notch, blah, blah, blah, and you go inside the person's house and it's all skeletons and wallpaper that says, you will die.
4758153	4758873	That was the best.
4758893	4759574	That's awesome.
4761075	4761355	So, yeah.
4761715	4768639	I mean, that was the big thing that I really wanted to point out with this article is it's got a lot of people jumping on it because people really want to see Tomodachi Collection come out over here.
4769459	4771720	And he's basically saying, yeah, we're considering it.
4771780	4772400	It's a possibility.
4773501	4773781	All right.
4774462	4775262	Loki, what do you have for us?
4775976	4776316	All right.
4776416	4781580	Well, there's a rumor that they're going to bring game sharing to Steam.
4782120	4785582	And this is actually coming from the beta update files.
4786242	4788144	Someone has gone through there.
4788524	4798670	And apparently it makes reference to some different, I guess, pop-up dialog boxes.
4798790	4799271	For example...
4800952	4802914	SharedGameLibrary
4816165	4818186	This shared game is currently unavailable.
4818287	4821308	Please try again later or buy this game for your own library.
4821468	4828473	It sounds like if you have a library of a ton of games that you're just not playing, that other people can access those games and play them.
4829133	4835577	Which, like any Steam user, probably that library would be very expensive.
4835957	4842501	You're probably going to be able to play any game that you want on there.
4842681	4845423	I have like a hundred some games and I probably play about six of them.
4848232	4850073	We'll see if this is something they're actually implementing.
4851614	4853175	Coming to a Steam beta near you.
4854435	4854656	Maybe.
4854676	4858217	I don't know.
4858417	4863220	Do you think that maybe there's something that was being developed in response to Xbox One and now it's like, yeah, we'll do it anyway?
4863640	4867642	I want to say I heard the earlier rumors about this long before Xbox One, though.
4867882	4869123	I think they could do something like this.
4869823	4873185	I think what would be interesting is reselling your games.
4873305	4873865	Like, say...
4876385	4884771	I don't know, through Steam or how you can actually put it up on the marketplace and stuff like that and maybe have the original creator get a portion of the profit from it or something.
4885351	4896259	Maybe you pay a 10% fee or something and whoever buys it, that fee goes to the person that put the game up there.
4896559	4897380	I think that'd be kind of cool.
4899335	4909918	Alright, what we're going to do here before we get into the next story, we're going to take a quick break and what we're going to do for the live folks, we're going to reset our routers here in the house to hopefully get a better connection.
4909958	4913459	We're just going to try it because right now it's pretty miserable right now for the live listeners.
4913839	4919761	So we're going to go down one more time live folks, but this one is planned and we'll be back in just a few minutes.
4920221	4926003	And for those of you guys listening on the podcast, you'll just hear that little musical interlude and we'll be right back with more news right after this.
4928191	4932556	to register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com.
4932936	4934618	Use the passphrase, blood.
4935479	4941245	Okay, we should be back with Orange Lounge Radio live here at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
4942646	4944488	Just a little bit of technical background.
4945550	4947612	Maybe the podcast folks will be interested in this too.
4948012	4954295	The way we have it set up here in the apartment is that we have the main router and the cable modem are in the office.
4954735	4960957	And then we actually have a second router out here in the living room, which everything is tied to, including the show computer.
4961378	4963659	What we've done is we've actually tried to fix the problem.
4963679	4965959	We have bypassed the living room router completely.
4966020	4967100	It's actually unplugged now.
4968160	4971722	That was a crossover router, so it's still the same network or whatever.
4972302	4973682	Alan knows more about this stuff than I do.
4974863	4979003	So we've actually taken the connection and plugged it into the main router directly.
4979023	4981264	Ron, I can give you a switch instead of just the router.
4981324	4982364	Oh, is Alan here to translate?
4983284	4993626	I just want to let people know that the router that we have in the living room is in switch mode or bridge mode, so it's not doing its own set of NAT addresses, because that's bad.
4993906	4999387	So it's just bridging the cable into the office router, but now we're bypassing that altogether.
4999708	5001928	So hopefully that'll fix it.
5003530	5004291	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5021744	5025826	Let's just keep on moving forward with the show, even though I've been drinking.
5026446	5028967	And this next story would have driven me to drink anyway.
5029027	5034689	It has to do with Miyamoto talking about the F-Zero franchise, and it's not what we want to hear.
5035069	5039510	In an interview with IGN, he said, "...I certainly understand that people want a new F-Zero game.
5039990	5046973	I think where I struggle is that I don't really have a good idea for what's new that we could bring to F-Zero that would really turn it into a great game again."
5047353	5052777	Certainly I can see how people looking at Mario Kart 8 could see, through the anti-gravity, a connection to F-Zero.
5053138	5056800	But I don't know at this point what direction we could go in with the new F-Zero.
5056900	5062064	You take F-Zero, GX, make it prettier, add more tracks, done.
5062084	5062745	You don't need to do anything.
5062765	5064186	Rainbow Road, Rainbow Road, Rainbow Road.
5064246	5064466	Right?
5064486	5065527	That's Mario Kart, silly.
5065647	5067188	Although, it would be neat to have a crossover.
5067348	5067549	Yes.
5067669	5068269	But, uh, yeah.
5068649	5074334	Well, no, that's actually what I was saying, is put, like, the whole Rainbow Road thing, do, like, like...
5077034	5079675	Rainbow Track or something, or Rainbow Space or whatever.
5079975	5082355	More of the same would actually be okay.
5082435	5084796	I mean, we were just talking about Ridge Racer earlier.
5084816	5085756	GX was awesome.
5085816	5087177	It was a fantastic game.
5087637	5095099	There's not really much you can really improve on that other than more tracks, because, you know, that's always good, and, you know, better visuals.
5095239	5100200	I mean, it could look really cool, almost like a Wipeout game or something like that, you know?
5100300	5103141	Just think of what the visuals could look like.
5103161	5103841	It'd be amazing.
5104781	5107083	I forgot... Track Editor would be even better, too.
5107403	5108544	I forgot about this.
5108584	5115689	BlackWolfInChat says there was a Rainbow Road in F-Zero X. It was the exact same track as Mario Kart 64, just a lot faster.
5117010	5121073	F-Zero X, I don't think I played nearly as much of because I didn't have a 64 until late.
5122054	5124356	Then I did the GameCube one, which was amazing.
5124616	5128959	Which begs the question, then, are we going to see F-Zero GX tracks in Mario Kart 8?
5130440	5130740	Maybe.
5131200	5131881	Show me your moves.
5132421	5132661	Okay.
5133942	5135304	DarkTetsuya says, oh, I don't know.
5135364	5136665	How about online play?
5137045	5139467	That would take Nintendo understanding online.
5140288	5141969	Nintendo doesn't admit online exists.
5141989	5144311	Which is a whole other Oprah.
5144351	5149535	The equivalent of Nintendo online is them sticking their fingers in their ears, closing their eyes, going la-la-la-la-la.
5149975	5153799	All right, let's jam through these next few stories because we're running long because of all these tech issues and everything else.
5153839	5155320	So DarkSakura and then release date.
5155834	5158635	Well, this is actually a story that came from my honey.
5160176	5175343	There was, I don't know if everyone remembers the big claim for Madden about Robin Antonik, who was one of the, I believe one of the designers for the original Madden series, was owed quite a bit of royalties.
5175383	5182586	Well, they've basically stated that that case has not expired, and this guy's still due a whole bunch of money.
5183346	5191894	I filed the original suit in 2011 that claimed that EA breached contracts signed in 1986 for royalties on derivative versions of the game.
5192375	5194757	And they're basically saying, nope, you still owe you money.
5195358	5196078	You gotta pay.
5196258	5197900	Oopsie-ay, blah.
5200282	5201804	So, he owes money.
5202344	5202885	He's owed money.
5203205	5204126	EA has to suck it.
5205965	5206445	Well, cool.
5206465	5208087	At least we'll see that trial go.
5209267	5215552	I wonder if that could mean anything to the Madden NFL franchise if they'll just say, you know, we're going to change the name or something.
5216452	5217353	They'll have to do whatever.
5217373	5218334	Like Madden's relevant.
5218474	5218774	Yeah.
5219434	5220255	John matters.
5220375	5222076	They'll do whatever they have to do to save it.
5222216	5222617	We'll see.
5223077	5224078	EA Football 2014.
5226039	5227160	Alright, release dates, Loki.
5228000	5231541	This week is actually some decent stuff coming out.

5339483	5339984	I swear.

5366783	5368124	That's just controller stuff.
5369605	5371626	It sounds a little dirty when you hear that, though.
5371786	5373448	I thought it was like another porn title.
5373628	5374128	All right.
5374388	5379092	No, the game is Date A Live, Rine Utopia comes out.
5379372	5381193	And it's got schoolgirls on the cover.

5450282	5450643	Alright.
5452165	5457711	Yeah, I don't know what to think about PlayStation 3 releases in Japan this week, especially after I've had a whopping shot.
5459273	5459814	This is funny.
5459914	5460855	Rob's just had a double.
5461836	5462778	I have had two shots.
5463899	5464480	I had three.
5465561	5465721	Hello.
5465741	5466202	Hello.
5468109	5470370	The only reason I'm stopping it, too, is because I've got to drive.
5470450	5472651	I had a gallbladder removed.
5473111	5480174	On the Xbox 360, Grand Theft Auto 4, the Complete Edition, as well as Skyrim, those are all getting price reductions.
5480514	5485397	A new game, Sniper Ghost Warrior 2, comes out this week on the Xbox 360.
5485497	5489198	So, hey, how about it for 360 releases in Japan?
5489398	5492620	It's about time that Japan can shoot Hitler in the balls.
5493440	5494321	On the PlayStation Vita.
5494341	5497302	Well, we haven't had a Japanese game kill Hitler since, what, Bionic Commando?
5497862	5500644	PlayStation Vita 2 Kaiden comes out this week.

5511389	5512370	And what is this game?
5512830	5515992	Again, ladies that look like they're dressed for the military this time.
5516012	5517873	I swear, any fetish you got, they got it this week.
5517893	5519854	It's probably high school something.
5520362	5521082	In the military?
5521102	5522663	I don't know.
5522743	5530344	And on the 3DS this week, Starry Sky in Summer 3D and Digimon World re-digitized decode.
5530364	5532425	Digimon game!
5532445	5536126	In case you were worried that Digimon... Are we the Digimon fans in the room or what?
5536166	5538026	You're the Digimon fans on the planet.
5538086	5539006	Congratulations.
5539866	5542787	Alright, let's travel to Europe.
5542807	5546248	For the record, Digimon Zero 2 was the best of the Digimon series.
5546288	5546868	Just sayin'.
5547267	5548628	Digimon greater than Pokemon.
5548728	5549148	Just saying.
5549188	5550109	Totally greater than.
5550750	5552091	Sacrilege.
5552871	5556494	So on June 25th, we have Company of Heroes 2 on PC.
5557014	5559216	And on the 28th, we have Dark for PC.
5559796	5563299	Deadpool on Xbox 360, PS3, and PC.
5564099	5569563	We have Game & Wario on the Wii U. And Ride to Hell, Xbox 360, PS3, and PC.
5569924	5572486	And hopefully it's better than Drag Me to Hell because that movie was shit.
5574467	5575748	Chiara made me see that movie.
5577028	5577769	Damn you, Tiara.
5578029	5579651	I didn't pay for it, so neither did she.
5579691	5579971	Oh, okay.
5579991	5580752	Well, thank you, Tiara.
5580932	5582114	That was still an awful movie.
5582134	5583916	And I love Sam Raimi, and that was a bad movie.
5584793	5587674	All right, just a couple more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week, Loki.
5588575	5589655	All right.
5589915	5593437	So let's talk a little bit about bad firmware.
5593857	5600300	And nobody likes bad firmware, especially bad firmware that's pushed out on the PlayStation 3 that kind of bricks consoles.
5601841	5609344	Thankfully, there is a way to fix your console because I guess somehow it removed your cross-media bar or something like that.
5609584	5610064	That's a problem.
5610305	5610645	No menu.
5611745	5631339	um and you can actually boot your console into a recovery mode or debug mode or something and allow you to re-download the update when it is released again on Thursday on June 27th and I guess it's a small number of PS3s that were affected by it but any number is still bad um
5633838	5645164	If you haven't updated your console like myself, it's good to note that they have taken off the bad firmware off the network right now until the update is released.
5645444	5647385	Because I just updated to 4.41.
5647765	5651968	That sucks.
5652788	5655689	Thankfully, though, it doesn't sound like there's any permanent damage.
5655769	5658991	It's just a minor week-long inconvenience.
5661913	5662593	Blesses of you.
5666184	5671027	Well, I have not turned on my PlayStation 30, or three, my PlayStation 30, my PlayStation 30.
5671087	5672148	Rob, our speak good.
5672188	5673348	I was talking in chat.
5673388	5677871	I was giving Drew Nami a hard time because I said, God, he's got to be pushing 30, and he's like, fuck you, I'm 28.
5678011	5679612	One shot at tequila.
5679692	5683515	I remember, I remember Drew Nami being our young Republican.
5683675	5683895	Mm-hmm.
5685107	5686848	Oh, how things have changed.
5687948	5695510	Alright, moving on to a story about Final Fantasy XII, which was a really overlooked Final Fantasy game.
5695550	5696191	I overlooked it.
5696291	5697671	It just came out at a bad time.
5697691	5698851	I own it and I overlooked it.
5699011	5701872	It came out at a time when a lot of people had moved on to other consoles.
5701912	5703793	Well, this is really exciting news.
5704573	5710315	In an interview with the site RPGsite, it's a very descriptive name, you know what you're going to get when you go there,
5711455	5723822	Producer Yoshinoro Kitase, who's producing Final Fantasy X and X-2 HD, was asked about what about other games coming to these HD.
5724842	5728444	We'll have to wait and see if these remasters are going to be successful first.
5728857	5729438	Final Fantasy XII
5743143	5743483	Yes!
5744444	5746406	Balthier and Fran in HD.
5746646	5747007	Yes!
5748048	5748468	Can't wait.
5748488	5749609	There's Seven, hello.
5750370	5754154	And yeah, Seven wasn't the greatest game, but Vincent, hello.
5754234	5756996	You just want Aerith to die over and over.
5757037	5758798	I want Aerith to die repeatedly.
5758818	5760019	1080p Aerith death.
5761500	5786250	1080p Aerith Death, oh my god it would have to have like blood particle physics and everything that's the problem though with bringing 7 7 it was so low poly that you know to up res it's gonna look like crap and also you know with you know I think these PlayStation 2 games is a little easier to do the HD remix plus they've got you know PlayStation 2 emulation engines already built that they can just dump it in up res the assets and they're done
5786710	5788551	I hope they do it.
5788752	5790533	I would really love 12 in HD.
5790993	5791854	I really hope they do it.
5791934	5793415	High res Aerith Death.
5793875	5795776	And high res Vincent, hello.
5796957	5798338	Are you done salvating over there?
5798358	5801500	Because it's time to go back when games weren't in HD.
5801800	5802421	God damn it.
5803001	5806525	Although, well, actually this one kind of did do an HD thing later.
5806565	5806805	Yeah, it did.
5806825	5817276	But anyway, we're going to look back at the classic-ness of this upcoming game here in a segment we call Classic Game of the Week, where DarkSakura's going to jump into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey!
5818575	5819716	Get off my lawn and play this game
5842910	5850231	And I think I put it up on a boss battle Mostly because Rez wasn't really an old game until now
5851192	5854994	Well, you know, I was going with Dreamcast era, and yet it didn't have a PS2 re-release.
5855835	5862799	So anyway, Rez came up when it was developed as under the codenames AK Project, Project Eden, and Vibes.
5863279	5872985	It's a rail shooter that came out by Sega in 2001 for Dreamcast and PS2, and it had a European Dreamcast and a US PS2 release in 2002.
5874386	5880570	The game was the dream child of one Tetsuya Mizuguchi, and you know what?
5881328	5882909	Who I still fanboy over.
5883029	5886271	Like, if I fanboy over anybody, it's Mizuguchi.
5886552	5889033	I even defended 99 Nights, y'all.
5889433	5891215	You mention his name, I need new undies, okay?
5893456	5893876	Excuse me.
5894517	5900881	And there is a prequel that came out, of course, called Child of Eden, which comes from the name Project Eden that they have.
5901862	5911088	So anyway, it's sort of a super futuristic network called Decay Project, and you have to stop an AI called Eden.
5912970	5914691	Excuse me, I'm sorry guys, I'm so sick.
5915972	5922859	So basically you are a hacker trying to basically reboot Eden and destroy viruses and firewalls.
5922939	5926422	And it's basically music, lights, and a vibrator.
5927643	5928864	Or does it get much better than that?
5929425	5929865	Excuse me.
5931527	5935110	And of course, like any tech person would know, to fix a problem you have to reboot.
5936786	5939668	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5964124	5988629	you lock on to the different enemies on the screen and you can lock on to up to eight enemies with what they call the reticule once you release the lock on button you fire your shots all over and if you don't hit an enemy or projectile you may actually collide which will cause your evolution bar to go down by one and it'll actually change the way your avatar looks like if the avatar gets to the lowest possible level and you get hit again you die
5989470	5989850	Dead.
5990492	5990913	Oh, you're back.
5990993	5991614	Good day, sir.
5991915	5992135	Alright.
5992436	5994420	I had to go blow my nose because of the whole thing.
5994440	5995202	Are you going to keep going?
5995522	5995943	Yeah, I'm fine.
5996344	5997467	What about the Overdrive though, Rob?
5997948	5998409	What about it?
5999107	5999607	Thanks for watching!
6019961	6023982	So basically you have five areas and the first four are ten subsections of the boss battle.
6024623	6029904	And the final one is like a boss rush within you battle Eden for the final one.
6031965	6034986	It has no sound effects or spoken dialogue.
6035406	6036427	It's all music.
6036667	6037627	Everything is music.
6037747	6043349	So for being a rail shooter, this one's also been lumped in in the music game genre.
6045350	6048893	And then, that brings me to the Trance Vibrator.
6050154	6051756	What should I say?
6052176	6053257	Buzz!
6054038	6057501	There's the funniest video of a guy and his girlfriend playing Rez.
6057521	6061424	It was basically him playing Rez and her playing the vibrator.
6064167	6064707	It was...
6066621	6087758	Call the trans vibrator, it pulses with the music And it would be something that you would put in your pocket or sit on It had a pouch Or in your butt It came with a pouch You could put it in to protect it Not unlike the Wii condom So the trans vibrator came with a condom, pretty much
6089102	6091504	It's actually a fabric bag.
6091864	6094686	But basically, it would vibrate in time with the music.
6095166	6098829	However, the DualShock was actually supposed to be stronger than that, I think.
6100350	6103852	ScrewAttack ranked it as the number one best gaming peripheral ever.
6106474	6112217	And basically, there were other versions of it that you could buy aftermarket.
6113959	6118842	It was also compatible with Space Channel 5 Part 2 and the Japanese version of Disaster Report.
6119222	6122884	I had no idea that you could use a trans vibrator with Space Channel 5 Part 2 as well.
6123084	6123644	That's amazing.
6123664	6126326	So you can put Ulala on your butt.
6127826	6131328	People have reverse engineered it to have it work on a PC.
6131948	6136051	And they've gotten this to work in Japan where there is a driver out for XP in Windows 2000.
6137691	6139773	There's also a driver that works for Linux kernel.
6141794	6149758	The Xbox 360 version that came out recently, the ResHD, basically will have just other controllers doing the trans-vibration function.
6150018	6154801	Can I say that when I got ResHD on 360, I actually did that with the controller?
6154821	6155401	You actually put a controller?
6155881	6156762	No, I did not.
6157102	6162926	But I did the thing that they suggested where you put one on your back and you lean against the chair and have that on your back.
6162966	6166229	And then I think it said to put the other one... In your butt.
6166269	6167289	Not on your butt.
6167349	6168190	That joke's over.
6168610	6170772	I think you put the other one on your arms.
6170792	6171753	I don't remember where they were.
6171813	6172673	I put it in my bra.
6172753	6173374	In your bra?
6173614	6175395	But it was weird.
6176056	6176616	But fun.
6177837	6178918	Well, speaking of...
6181374	6182315	and Consensual.
6182355	6184256	Most importantly, it was Consensual.
6184476	6186138	Well, actually, this is an interesting thing.
6186218	6191121	The game itself won an award from the Agency for Cultural Affairs Media Art Festival in Japan.
6191762	6198407	It was also one of the Dreamcast games that were chosen to be at the Smithsonian American Art Museum 2012 edition of the Art of Video Games.
6198987	6203651	If only they knew that you could put that trans vibrator in your butt, then I don't think it would be at the Smithsonian.
6204952	6205892	Oh my god, Rob.
6207313	6208074	Anyway, um...
6209702	6217451	RezHD came out for Xbox Live Arcade as Rob was talking about his exploits with the trans vibrator controller and his pants.
6218812	6219613	My back.
6219773	6222096	When did I start wearing pants on my back, Jamie?
6223177	6225239	By back, he means butt.
6225980	6226801	Don't be a betch.
6229484	6230685	After five minutes, I was like, let's go.
6233069	6238774	Anyway, basically Mizuguchi says it's 100% the same as the Dreamcast version.
6239174	6247841	And to do a new version, he would actually have to get the license from Sega because he actually did it as a contractor.
6248782	6253966	And there were no plans for 360 compatible trans-vibrator peripheral because everyone would put it in their butt.
6256748	6257849	Or cooch, or cooch.
6257929	6260031	Not everyone is into butt play.
6260231	6260431	Mm-hmm.
6263077	6266120	So yeah, Res HD came out on January 30th, 2008.
6267902	6269725	And it was included with the Cubits compilation.
6269745	6273549	You could just rest it there on your hoo-ha, and I'm sure it would be just a good old time.
6273569	6274310	You know what, Rob?
6274370	6274610	What?
6275451	6277013	We don't discuss my hoo-ha on the show.
6280217	6283400	to register a participation for this week's episode, use the password hoo-ha.
6305177	6305558	I'm just kidding.
6305578	6306158	Ignore that.
6306239	6306679	Ignore that.
6306719	6307340	It's not hoo-ha.
6307440	6308421	That's not the true word.
6308581	6312866	But anyway, the Cubed compilation came out with Luminous Live in every extent extra extreme.
6313787	6319014	And Mizuguchi was saying that there's no reason to not provide it on other platforms other than the Xbox 360.
6320015	6324440	And it was voted the 13th best Xbox Live arcade game of all time by AGN in 2010.
6325681	6345438	Other games that have come out that are related were Audiosurf, Child of Eden, as I said, was a spiritual successor There's Iz, I guess that's how it's pronounced, and Vibribin Vibribin is crack, and if you don't know about it, tune in to a bajillion episodes ago Where I talked about it, what was it, like five years ago that brought up Vibribin?
6346038	6350362	Yeah, Vibribin's old Everything I talk about's old
6352216	6353796	It has nothing to do with my hoo-ha.
6357457	6361398	Rob, for being... I'm almost questioning your sexuality now.
6363039	6365099	He turns straight when he gets drunk.
6365259	6365639	It's fine.
6365739	6367160	I've seen him kiss a girl when he was drunk.
6367420	6370541	Last week on Orange Lounge Radio, it has nothing to do with my hoo-ha.
6373258	6374200	Damn right, lady.
6374380	6374700	All right.
6374841	6376282	Rob's actually kind of pink in the face.
6376363	6376903	It's adorable.
6377344	6379847	You know us here at Microsoft think that's a great catchphrase.
6381009	6382691	Rob, you had a double shot.
6383252	6383733	Okay, yeah.
6383753	6384654	To be fair, I had a double shot.
6384674	6385395	You had a double shot.
6385555	6388559	I had a single, and then I had another single dumped in my orange juice.
6389140	6390301	Thank you, Alan.
6393530	6396212	We are... For the back here, we're muted.
6396312	6397032	You're welcome.
6398193	6398473	All right.
6398793	6402235	We are not... We are not doing... What's the word?
6402255	6403856	Just think about all those live listeners.
6403896	6406698	We're not hashtagging hoo-ha for this chat.
6407058	6413042	Just think of all the live listeners that left early because they were like, fuck it, I can't stand these connection problems and left.
6413542	6415063	They're missing the hoo-ha chat.
6416252	6417893	I had an equal opportunity stinker Oh my god
6443942	6446244	And that's the classic game of the week, Rez.
6447124	6448686	You want to know what I just remembered, Rob?
6448726	6451307	I've also had a shot of Robitussin before I left for this show.
6451428	6452668	Are you going to be okay to drive home?
6452708	6454190	It's the tussin that does it.
6454510	6457992	It's the tussin and the tuss tequila.
6458012	6459133	It wasn't the Patron that did it.
6459153	6460494	It was the Robitussin.
6460814	6461755	I call it tuss tequila.
6461835	6462276	There it is.
6462396	6464157	It's like, is that bottle gone?
6464177	6465438	That bottle's halfway gone.
6466439	6467299	I'm up to my fourth shot.
6467359	6470141	It took six years for me to finish mine that you got me when I turned 30.
6470201	6470462	Okay?
6472163	6472383	Okay?
6474513	6475934	It's not Queef Latifah.
6478337	6479599	There it is, your classic.
6480600	6481241	Your classic.
6482062	6482643	Can I finish?
6483704	6484205	Bite me.
6484345	6484906	Can I finish?
6485086	6485627	Can I finish?
6486087	6486307	No.
6486528	6488090	That's your classic game of the week.
6488110	6490733	This is DarkSakura for Orange Lodge Radio and suck it.
6494415	6498997	Rez, your classic game of the week featuring the Transvibrator on Yahoo!
6499917	6500297	All right.
6501338	6512142	That does it for part A. But stay tuned because there's plenty more to come with Rapid Fire News, the Fugle Question of the Week, Mailbag, FUs of the Week, and who knows what.
6512242	6513262	OLR is drunk.
6513282	6513802	Go home.
6515723	6516223	Oh, lordy.
6516583	6516804	All right.
6516824	6517424	Stay tuned, guys.
6517444	6520405	We'll be back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6527349	6527949	Congratulations!
6527969	6528409	Congratulations!
6528429	6529070	Congratulations!
6547711	6549032	Congratulations!
6549753	6552175	Oh my god, we're gonna see.
6552195	6554477	Yeah, isn't First Mate Sly Kick here next week?
6554638	6555158	I think so.
6555178	6555799	You better be.
6556319	6558241	Oh my god, I gotta send a picture of a ferret.
6559502	6561984	That is the cutest thing I've seen all day.
6562044	6565848	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
6566429	6566629	What?
6566649	6566749	What?
6566969	6569550	Part B, our 11th anniversary episode.
6569610	6571291	It's been a very weird night so far.
6572552	6576974	Obviously, with the live feed, it was going up and down in Part A. We think we fixed it.
6577014	6578155	Knock on wood, hopefully.
6579235	6580916	And then, yeah, we're having all those problems.
6580936	6582217	Then Jamie started talking about her hoo-ha.
6582557	6584578	You started talking about my hoo-ha.
6584678	6585118	Hello.
6585439	6587600	It was Jamie's hoo-ha that caused the feed to go down.
6587660	6589261	It got started on your ass.
6589921	6591742	Hold on, I've got to pour myself another shot.
6591862	6593103	Oh, you're going to have another shot?
6594223	6595624	I'm from New York, we get drunk.
6595684	6597365	It's not fair, I want another one.
6597445	6599326	I have a double shot here of Patron ready to start this off.
6599346	6600506	Rob, can I sleep on your couch?
6601307	6603488	I gotta get up at 6.30, that's the only thing I'm saying.
6603548	6606129	Although Alan will be here later, so I guess.
6606769	6607390	No, I can't.
6607610	6609191	Okay, good, you should be responsible.
6609591	6609871	Alright.
6610291	6610791	Fuck that.
6610811	6612812	Here we go, heads up, happy 11 years.
6613092	6614093	Yay!
6614393	6616294	Alright, and one, two, three.
6620160	6621160	Oh, I forgot to vine it.
6621420	6622641	Oh, Rob is so funny.
6622721	6624661	He's just doing the complete... He's dying right now.
6625482	6626042	Oh my god.
6626062	6629123	Rob has to run around the room and burn.
6629143	6632844	I know, but it's that warmth is so freaky to me.
6632864	6634564	Rob has to run around the room and do flappy hands.
6634784	6636565	I'm trying to contain it to my chair right now.
6636605	6637025	I'm fine.
6637685	6639786	What were we talking about during the commercial I want to talk about on air?
6639886	6641387	Oh, we were talking about... Your butt.
6641427	6644669	No, we were not talking about... Why were we talking about my butt on break, DarkSakura?
6644689	6645670	Stop being a potty mouth.
6646170	6646510	I don't know.
6646550	6647090	I wasn't here.
6647130	6648171	I was in the bathroom.
6648271	6652554	We were talking about restaurants that you can't eat back east, right?
6653014	6655375	So earlier, before the show, we had to go get food.
6655415	6658137	We went to Jack in the Box, which... You don't have Jack in the Box back east?
6658277	6660118	No, at least not in New York.
6660178	6663760	I don't know about down south on the east coast, but in New York, there's no Jack in the
6663840	6666402	In my experience in the South, there was one Jack in the Box.
6666482	6668804	It was in my birth town of Dothan, Alabama.
6669845	6671446	And it got closed for food poisoning.
6671966	6674028	And what were you excited about to find at Jack in the Box?
6674268	6675349	Breakfast all day.
6676230	6677231	It's pretty amazing.
6678432	6679352	I do like Jack in the Box.
6679432	6679973	They have a diverse menu.
6679993	6681134	But you know what they don't have out here?
6681654	6682094	Hardee's.
6682675	6683315	And Carl's Jr.
6683375	6684076	is not the same.
6684636	6685577	It sort of is, though.
6685697	6686318	No, not really.
6686698	6690401	You cannot get buttermilk biscuits at a fried chicken restaurant.
6690612	6692794	Dunkin' Donuts is what I want out here.
6692834	6693755	We don't have Dunkin' Donuts here.
6693775	6694335	I want Waffle House.
6694635	6695636	You can have Dunkin' Donuts.
6695796	6697077	I'll take back Jack in the Box.
6698298	6699239	I like Jack in the Box, though.
6699259	6699639	You can have it.
6699659	6700660	You can deep fry their tacos.
6700740	6704043	I think In-N-Out is a little bit overrated, so you can have In-N-Out.
6704443	6705905	I will gladly take In-N-Out.
6706265	6707206	I want Waffle House.
6707366	6711389	And I'm just noticing it's taking, what, Part B for us to start talking about food?
6711849	6712490	And, and, and.
6712830	6713791	You know what else I want from Back East?
6713811	6716193	Because we talked about liquor in Part A, and then you know what?
6716213	6716814	I want Crystals.
6717334	6717514	Huh?
6717554	6718335	Because of the corn pops.
6718854	6719674	I don't even know what that is.
6719894	6723015	Crystals is kind of like White Castle sized hamburgers.
6723755	6724595	They're really teeny.
6724615	6726236	You get like four for something.
6726736	6730757	But you can also get these little tiny corn dogs that are called corn pups.
6731297	6732257	And they're so good.
6732517	6733178	I don't know why.
6733218	6735078	Doesn't A&W have those little corn pups?
6735238	6735738	I think they do.
6735758	6736158	I don't know.
6736198	6737719	I haven't been to A&W in forever.
6737739	6740379	Well, they're all A&W KFCs now.
6740399	6741039	They're all hybrid.
6741059	6742940	You know what made me super happy?
6742980	6747281	And it's a totally southern thing, but going to a gas station and getting fried chicken liver.
6749480	6752341	In my time back east, when I think of gas stations, I think of Wawa.
6754142	6756442	Well, the huge convenience stores, anyway.
6756482	6760724	But anyway, I guess that's for another night.
6760844	6762224	We've got to get back into video games.
6762264	6765485	This is already a long show, internet problems aside.
6765545	6767666	So, rapid-fire news time, Loki.
6768126	6775628	Fez is not coming to the Xbox, because apparently they don't like the lack of indie support.
6776008	6782630	Also, basically saying, you know, they're not sure if they're going to come to the PlayStation 4, although it's tempting.
6783130	6788912	It's still too early to tell how everything's going to unfold, but their hearts definitely seem to be in the right place.
6789732	6795394	Whether or not I would develop for it comes down to how the platform holder treats me.
6795734	6799655	With Microsoft, they made it painfully clear they don't want my ilk on their platform.
6799855	6802796	I can't even self-publish there, whereas PS4, I can.
6802836	6803376	That's simple.
6804317	6804897	It's that simple.
6804937	6807361	Microsoft won't let me develop for their console, but Sony will.
6808422	6815231	So, I guess we just won't see Fez 2 on the Xbox One unless they completely change their platform.
6815472	6821720	And that's unfortunately a lot of the things I've been hearing, although I'm wondering if they're going to flip that around too come, you know,
6821860	6827602	Yeah, I was going to say, this whole indie rabble-rabble is not looking good for Microsoft.
6827662	6828923	But, yeah, who knows?
6829003	6829283	Who knows?
6830523	6835385	Drunami in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, The guy behind Fez is a goddamn twat, though.
6835745	6836205	Fuck him.
6836525	6837205	To be fair, yes.
6837325	6837526	Yes.
6838166	6838546	That is true.
6839547	6844711	Um, so, yes, uh, Xbox Live Gold, remember they were giving away those free games?
6845472	6849195	There's a whole bunch of asterisks to that, though.
6849335	6851737	The free games, yes, they are being put out.
6852878	6856882	However, you have to download them within a two-week time frame, I believe.
6857882	6859684	The release sets the way with Fable 3.
6860044	6864007	You have to download it by July, otherwise you can't download it anymore.
6864347	6872832	And now there's going to be new games coming out the 1st and 16th of each month, with next month being Halo 3 and Assassin's Creed 2.
6874213	6885501	And I'm wondering if that's going to still be the same as it was with Fable 3, where you have to download it within those first two weeks that it's available, otherwise you can't download it again.
6886181	6889483	Someone was saying that it might not be that way, but I think it's going to be that way.
6890044	6895408	It's kind of a lame, I guess, way to get you to subscribe to live if you're not already doing that.
6896748	6899871	I mean, I am, so I guess I'll download those free games.
6900071	6902372	I downloaded Halo 3 just for the fuck of it.
6902633	6903933	Halo 3 I already own.
6903954	6907276	I guess I'll download it.
6907356	6909718	Assassin's Creed 2 I don't give a shit about, so we'll see.
6910538	6913060	Although Crackdown, Crackdown would be pretty awesome to have in there.
6913100	6914261	That's old enough, I would say.
6914841	6918664	And I can't find my disc for it anymore, so I'd love to have one of those.
6918704	6919825	I like Crackdown.
6920086	6920746	Crackdown's fun.
6921527	6924889	Remember, most people were just buying it for the Halo 3 preview, but it ended up being pretty good.
6925330	6926691	Yeah, I dig it.
6927431	6931414	Crackdown was more fun when you just add those codes where you just randomly spawn anything.
6931454	6934197	And you're like, haha, I'm just spawning cars off a roof of a building.
6934237	6938180	Yeah, that's like the stuff Loki lives for, though, is the whole hilarious mod things.
6938200	6939301	That's the kind of stuff.
6939981	6941322	Keys to the City Mode was awesome.
6941782	6943643	I didn't play Story Mode in Crackdown.
6943703	6946244	I just wanted to blow shit up and drop cars off the top of buildings.
6946264	6947244	That's like Grand Theft Auto.
6948085	6950766	The story in Grand Theft Auto, who gives a shit?
6950946	6951827	It's really good, though.
6952087	6954308	Speaking of which, have you played Grand Theft Auto 4 yet?
6955468	6955808	Uh-huh.
6956109	6956649	Uh-huh.
6956909	6957669	That's what I thought.
6958149	6958410	No.
6960491	6960991	I haven't.
6962588	6964229	Have you finished Saints Row the Third at least?
6964990	6967652	I haven't finished it, but I have at least played a good chunk of that.
6968112	6969213	That game's hilarious.
6969733	6971695	The funniest, I haven't laughed my ass off that hard in a long time.
6971715	6973576	For just a moment, you sounded like Greg Proops.
6974297	6974757	Okay.
6975257	6976538	Are you sure you're not drunk?
6976739	6982082	No, your voice had that sort of quality that was Proops-like.
6982343	6982963	I'm not sure I take this.
6982983	6983724	Did you do your third story?
6984584	6986585	No, I haven't gotten a chance to do that yet.
6986685	6987485	Sorry, go ahead.
6987585	6998668	And then finally, this is pretty awesome, they are doing a free DLC update for Surgeon Simulator 2013 that of course is going to add in Team Fortress 2 stuff.
6999008	7006170	So you get to play as the doctor there and also you get to work on the heavy.
7006210	7006610	And that's awesome.
7011491	7013212	Can you work on Sandvich?
7013572	7018473	You should actually just pick that up anyways because it's awesome.
7020094	7024035	Alright, on the Xbox 360 there is now a Best of Disney app.
7024135	7029737	And no, that doesn't mean their games like Connect Adventure, Disney, or whatever that thing was called.
7030077	7032778	But trailers, clips, and animated shorts.
7032978	7036019	Oh, I hope they have that short that they had before Wreck-It Ralph with the paper planes.
7036059	7036739	It was so good.
7036759	7037480	Thank you, Paper Man.
7038820	7040302	Xbox One, Google, and Bing
7057962	7062444	A hilarious little meme going around right now where folks, you know that predictive searching?
7062464	7063324	I'm sure you've all played with this.
7063344	7069387	This is going around Tumblr for... Hey, if you go to Google and do a predictive search, you type Orange Lounge, it comes right out.
7069427	7072048	Orange Lounge Radio is right there in the predictive search, which is pretty awesome.
7072088	7072868	Because we're awesome.
7072988	7074629	And I think we've talked about this before.
7074669	7075609	I think it's still the case.
7075649	7080351	If you go and you type Orange Lounge Radio, predictive search brings up Orange Lounge Radio Marissa.
7081345	7082807	Who isn't even a host of the show!
7084289	7085971	But she's infamous, so there you go.
7086051	7087793	But she's great, and I'm totally okay with that.
7087833	7089135	I totally miss Marissa.
7089255	7089815	I do too.
7089875	7092018	God, I was just in LA too, and I didn't have a chance to see her.
7092058	7095042	But anyway, predictive searching on Google.
7095062	7100008	If you search for The Xbox One Is, it will come up and say terrible, ugly, a joke.
7100328	7100808	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7123982	7126584	In my mind, how many people are really using Bing?
7127585	7129806	You're probably... Everybody, says Microsoft.
7130367	7133769	Actually... You're probably a little bit of a Microsoft fanboy to begin with if you're even using Bing.
7133789	7137552	I used Bing for about 10 minutes when they were giving away free live cards.
7138012	7139153	Or no, Xbox Point cards.
7139654	7143256	And then I got like two $20 cards for Xbox Live and then I stopped using Bing forever.
7143276	7144657	They are still technically doing that.
7144717	7146539	You just have to search on their...
7147359	7153401	Make it a point to make some erroneous searches every day and then you can save up to get like five bucks worth of Xbox Live points.
7153461	7154301	It just takes you about a month.
7155061	7155762	So whatever.
7155842	7156802	Predictive searches.
7156882	7157462	Hilarious.
7158242	7169505	Lastly, on PlayStation 4, if you're a fan of DC Universe Online or Planetside 2, you may be worried, am I going to have to get PlayStation Plus because now that's going to be required to do multiplayer?
7169826	7172266	Am I going to need to get PlayStation Plus to play these MMOs?
7172326	7174147	The answer is no.
7174827	7175628	Pretty awesome.
7176729	7182516	So yeah, you do not need to have PlayStation Plus if you want to play games like DC Universe Online and Planetside 2 Online.
7183016	7183637	Very cool.
7184939	7190044	Planetside 2, however, not cross-compatible between PC and PlayStation 4.
7190125	7192808	DC Universe Online, however, will remain so.
7193588	7195651	I think that's the way things are today, to be honest.
7195971	7197733	Except DCU was poopy.
7198514	7199315	We have some fans, though.
7199335	7200957	I know PodCulture's a huge fan of that.
7200977	7203220	You have a hate boner for DC to begin with.
7203240	7204842	No, I don't have a hate boner for DC.
7204882	7207425	I have a hate boner for bad games and bad character development.
7207625	7209327	It's a hate hoo-ha, not a hate.
7209367	7209868	Rob.
7209888	7210048	What?
7215729	7219170	If Gail Simone wrote every book that DC did, I would read it.
7219390	7223351	I thought DC Universe was fun enough, especially because it's free to play now.
7223491	7225431	I see the charm in DC Universe online.
7225491	7231753	It's like Ninja Turtles arcade game, but you get to make your own hero, and you can make your hero as pretty as you want.
7233534	7234934	I didn't think it was very pretty at all.
7234954	7235254	Ugh.
7235694	7236015	You know what?
7236035	7236675	Hate, hate, hate.
7236915	7237435	You know what?
7237455	7240096	The first thing I did was make myself a female version of Hawkeye.
7240116	7240716	Hmm.
7243362	7244823	Blackwolf is correcting me in chat.
7244863	7247945	DC Universe Online does not play PC versus PS3.
7247985	7248626	I thought it did.
7249387	7250367	Well, alright, then I'm wrong.
7250868	7252809	But PS4 will work with PS3.
7254951	7263778	And I believe that they left it up for third parties doing free-to-play games like that, that they can decide whether they want to have that behind the paywall or not.
7264018	7267881	I would imagine that if you're interested in getting more people to play your game, probably not going to put that behind it.
7269843	7270983	Alright, let's move on.
7271023	7271524	DarkSakura.
7272404	7274125	Agent X Flames on the side of my face All that shade
7299819	7302024	I cannot touch the immortal Madeline Kahn.
7302044	7302986	The shade of it all.
7304269	7305852	You know, I don't even watch that show, so whatever.
7306694	7307335	You should.
7307996	7309560	Do you think I would totally dig the drag queens?
7310381	7310862	Uh, yeah.
7311556	7312817	I love drag queens, don't get me wrong.
7312837	7313317	Well, see?
7313677	7313977	Anyway.
7314158	7315898	I just hate sitting down to watch a show.
7316059	7319220	I love doing video game news, which occasionally happens on this show.
7319240	7319601	You know what?
7319621	7319801	Bite me.
7320561	7321802	You're the one who brought up the shade.
7322082	7322522	Rab.
7323943	7332308	So anyway, Arc System Works, who brought us Guilty Gear, said that if people want to see Guilty Gear on the Wii U, then you have to sign a petition.
7332748	7334569	And the petition is online, and I'm not going to link it.
7335189	7337831	It runs on the Unreal 3 engine, so basically, whatever.
7337851	7338151	Whatever.
7339733	7344675	In other news, SEGA has been teasing something called Project 575.
7345515	7346736	We have no idea what it is.
7347276	7348196	It could be a rhythm game.
7348376	7349177	It could be nothing.
7349797	7352138	It could be, looks like a couple of girls.
7352758	7353258	So who knows?
7353558	7356699	Maybe you just spend the whole game being awesome.
7356759	7357080	I don't know.
7358340	7361982	And this is the sad news, Rob.
7362883	7363763	I'm very, very sad.
7364043	7364724	Well, what happened?
7364984	7371328	Well, you remember how we had been covering the whole Knuckles Dawson disappearance?
7371368	7372088	Well, they found him.
7372828	7383675	Which, I mean, I think we pretty much knew it was a suicide issue for the fact that he canceled his accounts and basically up and left.
7383995	7384115	Mm-hmm.
7384415	7386255	But they found him.
7388036	7389576	They're not releasing a cause of death yet.
7389716	7390796	I mean, I'm pretty sure.
7390996	7399918	Well, and to be fair, even saying that is a little bit jump to conclusion because maybe in his mental unwell state, he may have just left, maybe had a plan in mind.
7399978	7400758	So we don't know.
7400878	7402419	And we don't want to fill in the gaps.
7402659	7402979	Yeah.
7403139	7407620	But, well, I'm saying that current evidence is leading that way.
7407640	7408040	Sure, sure.
7408060	7408160	Okay.
7409821	7411864	So yeah, they found his body.
7411884	7412885	He was 28 years old.
7413486	7414367	That's very unfortunate.
7414748	7417732	They found his bike and helmet in Stanley Park.
7418593	7423199	And then he left his wallet, computer, and phone at home.
7423700	7425941	But they found his body in the park across the bay, right?
7426001	7426882	Yeah.
7427562	7429123	So he was on the move.
7429203	7430984	He left everything behind and left.
7431104	7432084	Yeah.
7433105	7434366	It's really too bad.
7434646	7441830	And it's just a reminder that if you know somebody that might be reaching out for help, please try to get them help.
7441950	7443971	Don't just write it off as an attention thing.
7445491	7447232	But make sure that you're not...
7448813	7454175	Okay, this is where I kind of say that's a line because, yeah, some people do want attention.
7455455	7458876	Some people are looking for attention because there's a reason for it.
7459477	7463418	Make sure that you see to it that they get help, don't contribute to the underlying cause.
7464698	7468182	I do want to call attention to this too because I think it's pretty neat.
7468322	7476549	One reason that Knuckles is very popular in the community is that he actually did one achievement a day every day on the 360 for like two or three years.
7476609	7478190	It was a significant amount of time.
7478891	7483355	There's a call right now and a movement to try to get Microsoft to do an achievement in his honor.
7484095	7487598	Some folks are saying even that day one achievement should have a tie-in to him.
7488218	7497285	I think it would be great if Microsoft could do some sort of achievement in his honor, perhaps getting an achievement every day for a month or a week or something.
7497605	7504911	Something that would resonate with what he was known for in the community I think would be a great, great thing and a great way to remember him.
7505922	7509763	Well, I'm also looking through the comments on here to see if they had any other information on here.
7509863	7513885	And basically, the family's already made a Facebook page about it, releasing information.
7513965	7517706	So I would say check Facebook and look for your information there.
7517906	7520787	FineKnuckles.com redirects to his Facebook.
7521367	7524928	Well, the Facebook his family set up in regards to the issue.
7525128	7525889	This is tragic.
7526869	7529610	SSJ100 Matt in chat says, regardless, this was a tragedy.
7529770	7530230	Absolutely.
7530615	7534199	But I do really urge people, don't take it upon yourself to be the diagnosis.
7534660	7538124	Tell the person to seek diagnosis and just be available.
7538724	7539005	All right.
7539866	7541508	Well, let's shift gears here a little bit.
7541568	7548576	Let's take it to the listeners with a question and a segment we do here every week called the Fugle Question of the Week.
7554574	7558316	Facebook and Google, you take those words, you slam them together, you get Fugle.
7558756	7564040	And the Fugle question of the week this week has to do with a Nintendo story.
7564800	7577247	And the Nintendo story that we linked to talks about how Nintendo is hiring more people to strengthen their internal development studios in the development of fan-favorite franchises as well as new intellectual properties.
7577648	7579669	But the question we asked on Fugle was...
7580169	7586214	Which do you hope that Nintendo focuses on more in the development of games for Wii U and 3DS?
7586674	7591558	Development of fan favorite franchise games or new IPs and why?
7592179	7595121	I was looking for people to kind of pick one or the other.
7595261	7599385	I'm not sure I was really clear in that question because we get a lot of answers where people are saying both.
7599845	7601446	I'll go ahead and read those answers anyway.
7601807	7603348	Let's start on Google Plus tonight.
7604089	7609233	Actdeft says, well, it's kind of obvious that they're going to try to focus on the Wii U since they truly need games for that.
7609753	7616481	Don't know if they'll be totally new IPs, but they'll probably incorporate new ideas into the franchises we know and love.
7617222	7619104	And while we already have a new Smash Bros.
7619144	7624049	on the way, I would love to see a new Metroid using the gamepad, and of course, a new F-Zero in Kirby game.
7624930	7627474	Redertainment says, However, we are talking about a corporation here.
7627534	7628515	Corporations live by one mantra.
7628575	7629616	Cash rules everything around me.
7629636	7629837	Cream.
7642914	7665050	while I may want newer IPs in order to get a more diverse gaming landscape older IPs sell better therefore even though I want new IPs old IPs are probably what I'm going to get that's a good answer that kind of tells me what you want that kind of keeps the real side in it I like that answer and I think you are right I think a lot of these answers are right
7666232	7678167	Liam C on Facebook says concentrate on developing new IPs to bring in a new audience that is generally held by the Xbox PlayStation but also give older franchises a chance on the Wii U like Golden Sun and F-Zero.
7679534	7681535	Codeman says, I'm kind of on the fence about this.
7681615	7687920	As much as I would love to see new IPs, I love remakes of such games as the Mario franchise, Smash Bros., F-Zero, etc.
7688400	7691322	I think that Nintendo should begin to focus a bit on indie developers.
7691402	7692383	That's where the fans are.
7692463	7693184	Well, at least me.
7693584	7695986	Although the exclusive Bayonetta 2 looks fantastic.
7696346	7697127	So I just don't know.
7697227	7698327	Very difficult question.
7698848	7699528	Yeah, that was the idea.
7699568	7701470	It was a difficult question.
7703331	7705833	I always mispronounce this name, and especially because I've been drinking.
7705853	7706673	I'm not going to remember it now.
7706733	7706813	It's...
7712096	7723140	I think they should try for an equal focus on the Wii U and 3DS, maybe giving the Wii U slightly more attention due to its issue in the sales department.
7723600	7725961	As for new IPs versus old, that's another.
7726341	7729182	Both, I want more 2D Metroid and another Mega Man game.
7729462	7732903	Nintendo slap the stupid out of Capcom real quick and get on that.
7733304	7736405	However, if they make something real interesting, I will not be disappointed either.
7737466	7746589	Man, how epic would a 2D Mega Man game be on the Wii U where you could have your thing to switch weapons right there on the gamepad so you never have to bring up the little window.
7747099	7749461	You don't ever have to bring it up after SNES games.
7749801	7751082	Oh yeah, that's right, because you have the L and R triggers.
7751102	7751802	You can use the L and R triggers.
7751882	7752382	That's true.
7752683	7754764	But still, still, think about it.
7754844	7756805	And you can keep holding a charge while you switch through your weapons.
7756885	7757986	A map or something.
7758106	7763970	There's so much potential there with the Wii U. Andy R. says, New IPs.
7764350	7764730	There we go.
7764770	7766271	Somebody's saying one or the other.
7766331	7766851	New IPs.
7767252	7773656	Mario and Zelda are cool and all, but I'd love to see a Nintendo mascot that wasn't created more than three console generations ago.
7774156	7775837	Well, you get Steel Diver for free.
7775877	7777138	That was this generation.
7803895	7808980	I'm gonna give you two huge IPs that Nintendo did last generation.
7809780	7815946	In fact, I would say Nintendo's biggest IP of all time came last generation.
7816326	7817227	And y'all are forgetting.
7817728	7818048	Anybody?
7819130	7819550	WeFit.
7819871	7820591	Excite Truck.
7821992	7823353	WeFit is one of the big ones.
7823533	7823994	WeSports?
7824234	7824874	WeSports.
7825495	7826095	Excite Truck.
7826516	7827777	WeSports was last generation.
7827797	7829178	No, the answer is Excite Truck.
7830679	7831459	Okay, fine.
7831479	7832800	There's Excite Truck as well.
7832820	7834021	Excite Truck is awesome.
7834081	7834462	Alright.
7837084	7838024	Let's see, where was I?
7839386	7843269	Speaking of which, now that I think about it, what are those guys working on?
7844470	7854259	The guys at Monster Games that have done two racing games for Nintendo and they're still working on another racing game that hopefully not unemployment, maybe F-Zero?
7855980	7858122	Excite Truck U, that could only be the dream.
7858527	7858847	All right.
7859087	7860608	Did I read SSJ100 Matt's answer?
7861148	7861368	I did.
7861388	7862388	That was the one I was on, right?
7863369	7863809	I think so.
7863929	7864169	Okay.
7864569	7865989	Zether says, New IP.
7866329	7868470	We need more of those, less of Mario and Zelda.
7868510	7870931	When Nintendo experiments, sometimes the result is good.
7871251	7875192	The thing they have to have something that's going to do well.
7875872	7879153	Clover Nikon says, The new talent should work on new IPs.
7879273	7883515	That doesn't mean the new talent could offer a fresh take on our favorite Nintendo classics.
7884415	7885156	Tiger Claw says,
7902112	7904113	Mario Galaxy was kind of a new IP.
7904253	7905633	It's just that it had Mario.
7905673	7907014	But it didn't play like a Mario.
7907154	7908214	Well, I mean, it did and it didn't.
7908254	7910795	It was a platformer, but it was so different.
7910835	7911335	You know what I mean?
7911475	7912815	I like Super Paper Mario.
7912875	7915076	I thought that was a good version of Paper Mario.
7915476	7919817	And I liked it a lot better than, like, I even went back and played Paper Mario and I just like, eh.
7920117	7923739	Nintendo's solution to sell new IPs is to shove Mario into it.
7923919	7924759	And it really works.
7925945	7927066	Thanks for watching!
7946958	7950963	Gamer Girl says I think it would be cool if the new IPs helped work on maybe some new games.
7951384	7955408	Mario and Zelda are fine but what if they steered clear of those two icons for a while?
7955448	7957531	Would it make people dislike Nintendo anymore?
7959244	7959804	Here's the thing.
7959844	7961405	There has to be an HD Zelda.
7961585	7962665	That has to happen.
7962785	7963585	Can you imagine?
7964226	7968007	People will revolt in the streets if there's not an HD Zelda.
7968127	7971068	It's time to bring back Rad Racer.
7971608	7972808	I'm with you, gamer girl.
7972888	7974289	I think they should do some.
7974409	7978270	But to deny an HD Zelda, that's too much.
7979350	7981291	We need to see the rebirth of Snake Rattle and Roll.
7981977	7983958	JVMont, that wasn't a Nintendo game, was it?
7984499	7986480	It was rare, or... Yeah.
7986640	7987541	It was, but Nintendo needs to go.
7987561	7990383	I may get some hate, but Zelda's kind of overrated.
7990403	7990863	Get out!
7990923	7993105	No, I'm just... Actually...
7996651	7998572	People need to move on past Zelda.
7998672	8000753	Ocarina of Time is super overrated.
8000893	8006597	But I have to remember that a lot of people, like, that is literally the game they grew up on.
8006657	8009879	Like, went through their teenage years playing and so forth.
8009939	8014662	So, like, I will always love Link to the Past the best.
8014822	8017683	So when they announced that 3DS sequel, I literally did the...
8018664	8021106	Link to the Past is the only one I can play.
8021346	8023467	I did play through a crapload of Ocarina, though.
8023487	8024848	Twilight Princess was pretty fucking good.
8024868	8025408	That I can't deny.
8025428	8026969	I named my cat after that game.
8026989	8028870	It was pretty for a Wii game, but...
8046485	8047065	Alright, anyhow.
8047885	8051806	Is it me or was Midna just the best new character ever in a Zelda series?
8052846	8054566	There's a reason why you named a creature after her.
8055046	8056447	Alright.
8056787	8061948	Chiggers in our Facebook says, I would like to see a new Mario RPG and not Paper Mario.
8062288	8064548	I think they need to bring Square Enix back to do it too.
8064668	8065208	Good luck.
8065868	8071049	And work on your damn online capabilities like Online Mario Party or even the aforementioned Mario RPG.
8071089	8074490	I think it would be kind of cool to do a Diablo type online Mario game.
8075450	8076451	How would that even work?
8076511	8077152	But I like it.
8077692	8081295	And lastly, Ragenator says, I want to see a mix of new IPs and fan faves.
8081396	8082757	Why does it have to be one or another?
8082777	8083838	Because I said so.
8084278	8085339	That's the question.
8085559	8086180	One or the other.
8087711	8088311	That's fine.
8088512	8088952	That's fine.
8089773	8091334	We appreciate all the answers nonetheless.
8091374	8097338	It sounds like most people are like, we need a little of column A and a little of column B. You can't make me pick one, Rob.
8097378	8098179	You just can't.
8098960	8099940	And I can respect that.
8100261	8105024	Those are some of the answers there at Facebook.com slash Orange Silence Radio and our Google Plus community.
8105265	8106646	Thanks to y'all for participating.
8107006	8107666	Back to the news.
8107927	8108147	Loki.
8108607	8109008	IDLE NINJA
8124363	8128605	and they are kind of doing this mod tool thing.
8128625	8138248	They're actually participating on their forums now pretty actively and helping create all sorts of new mods for Saints Row III, Saints Row II
8139288	8155195	and eventually gonna have a full-blown mod kit for Saints Row 4 and we're talking like all sorts of stuff and even Saints Row 3 already you can do quite a bit like I have some mods running on there where I have some handheld like you know lasers and stuff like that they're pretty sweet
8156636	8160137	So, yeah, I'm pretty excited to see what they're going to do with this.
8160478	8167321	And, I mean, the way it sounds like now is with these tools, you can essentially... It's basically tools they're using to make the game.
8167761	8172344	You can create new maps, new weapons, characters, missions, etc.
8172444	8175646	And it's going to really expand a lot of the game.
8175846	8179247	So, I'm already expecting to get it on PC anyway.
8179308	8180348	So, it makes me excited.
8180468	8181749	I know you love your mods, too.
8182349	8183009	It'll be awesome.
8183230	8183650	All right.
8184470	8186331	Dragon Quest X announced during a 10-hour livestream.
8207984	8213646	It will retail for $40, but there'll also be a deluxe version for 9,800 yen, which would be about, what, 80 bucks?
8214086	8221849	That has a Dragon Quest X PC game controller, a monster encyclopedia book, a map of the world, security token, and additional in-game content.
8222249	8228532	Very interesting because, you know, Dragon Quest obviously is huge in Japan, and this game was a selling point.
8228572	8234854	Dragon Quest X was on Wii and Wii U. Never came here, though, and I don't understand why, but all right.
8234874	8236975	I'm surprised Monster Hunter hasn't really come to PC.
8238101	8239581	Yeah, it's very interesting.
8239621	8241722	Yeah, it's just so interesting.
8241742	8245263	But anyway, you can get a Dragon Quest X PC benchmark.
8245323	8248503	It's available for download at nvidia.co.jp.
8248963	8251304	And there's also a beta sign-up available.
8251444	8252684	So, yeah, there you go.
8252744	8254284	Dragon Quest X coming to PC.
8254805	8257325	Nintendo losing that exclusive in Japan.
8257405	8262746	But maybe the Wii U especially didn't have... It's still console exclusive.
8262946	8263266	Yeah.
8263386	8265267	Well, yeah, it's still console exclusive, which is cool.
8265447	8265627	Well...
8266507	8270391	and Wii U. Final Fantasy XIV will be exclusive to Sony consoles.
8271092	8276957	It's not going to be on Nintendo and it's not going to be on Xbox 360 or One, so kind of a similar situation.
8278699	8279980	Anyhow, DarkSakura.
8281750	8305174	and other news there's a company called the Fulbright Company that has a game I have to actually check this out their little trailer for it called Gone Home which is sort of I guess it's going to go into some sort of point and click survival horror game where basically a girl goes home from college to find her family is completely missing the house is empty and she's trying to look for clues
8305974	8322870	Well, basically, the company is pulling out of their showing at Penny Arcade Expo after some comments that were made regarding some basic transphobia.
8323070	8327054	This was from Mike with Penny Arcade.
8327874	8328014	And...
8328755	8347172	lots of just really negative comments that were going out so basically they're saying that even though this is their biggest form of exposure that they could get for their game they're pulling out because those type of comments and basically the nature of these people is not what they want to associate with their game and their company so they've completely pulled out
8347498	8354260	I honestly get the sense from this guy over at Penny Arcade is that he's not necessarily transphobic by nature.
8354661	8357662	That would mean that he hates them or whatever.
8358102	8361243	But he kind of... He doesn't understand it?
8361623	8362723	Yeah, I think so.
8362944	8366525	I think he kind of misunderstands how to communicate about that in public or whatever.
8367245	8372309	He's very hard-headed, and I think the big problem is how he was lashing out on Twitter.
8372649	8377652	And when he said – he made some comment like, if you use the – and I am totally paraphrasing.
8377672	8387579	Do not quote me on this because I don't have his Twitter in front of me, but it was something like, if you say the word cis around me, then stop doing that because I totally discount you at that point.
8387999	8390740	Really bold-headed, thick-headed statements like that.
8390980	8393021	Oh, there was the dick wolves thing, too.
8393041	8394361	Think before you tweet.
8394561	8396162	You influence a lot of people.
8396322	8398923	My granddaddy had a fantastic phrase.
8399423	8401824	It's put brain in gear before mouth in motion.
8402344	8404044	Well, in this case, fingers in motion.
8404705	8407445	But it's definitely an act, don't react.
8408206	8409226	Take a moment and think about it.
8411718	8416201	And some folks in Extover says they were comments that were taken out of context.
8416782	8422747	But when you influence that many people, a singular tweet like that, that can happen.
8423167	8425469	And you've got to really think about some of these things that you're saying.
8425849	8427531	And again, I'm giving the guy credit.
8427631	8430673	I don't think at heart he hates trans people.
8430693	8432735	That's not the impression I get at all.
8433195	8438660	And it's not like Penny Arcade built its reputation on being the most PC comic there was.
8438800	8442301	The impression I get is that he's saying, it's my way or the highway.
8442561	8449483	And the trans community is trying to say, actually, when you say this, we consider it offensive for these reasons.
8450344	8454085	It's kind of like he's not conveying that he understands that appropriately.
8455225	8458466	Yeah, it's one thing to educate someone who doesn't want to be educated.
8459987	8460107	And...
8462668	8480432	I can understand though where as a company if there's this general conception going on that this is how they feel I can understand wanting to separate your company's image from that conception so yeah they were perfectly and if they wanted to pull out of Penny Arcade Expo whatever their reasons were they were valid
8480672	8481912	Did you see the follow-up, by the way?
8481932	8483053	I don't know if you saw the follow-up.
8483073	8483853	No, I didn't.
8483993	8487834	He actually posted an apology yesterday, the 21st.
8488975	8489875	I guess that would be two days ago.
8489975	8493176	He actually ended up making a donation to the Trevor Project of $20,000.
8494977	8498738	Now, I feel really good and really kind of hmm at that.
8498818	8501399	Like, Trevor Project's an awesome charity.
8501679	8503139	I'm so glad they're getting this.
8503540	8506341	But there's that part of me, I have to go here.
8506401	8507681	There's that part of me that's like,
8508379	8510962	You can't throw money at the problem and expect people to forget it.
8527742	8530044	With the money that they're bringing in from Penny Arcade?
8530184	8530484	Yeah.
8530945	8536349	So, I mean, again, it's a slippery slope because I can't say, oh, $20,000 of charity.
8536369	8537650	What a horrible thing you did.
8538450	8540932	But I'm just kind of... It almost seems like they're trying to buy forgiveness.
8543574	8544996	That's my top impression.
8545136	8547377	This is a... Okay, let me put it this way.
8547518	8548698	I think this is the best way I can put it.
8549339	8554523	This is a good step, but it's not going to fix the problem.
8555404	8556164	Does that make sense?
8556785	8557025	Yeah.
8557045	8557125	Yeah.
8558548	8561870	The problem is the reaction and the tweets.
8562250	8563610	I can give a local example.
8564331	8565571	This is what it makes me think of.
8565991	8574715	Remember when the ice cream chain, Local Leather Bees, was having a problem about them having donated their money to the pro-Prop 8?
8575895	8579257	But we serve ice cream at Pride events.
8580537	8586280	It's sort of almost the same thing where they're trying to put a band-aid over something without getting to what the actual problem was.
8586861	8591103	And in this case, it's like, well, we're giving money to this, but the whole thing is that the damage has been done.
8591523	8596826	It's going to take quite a bit more to turn it around, if at all.
8597707	8598147	You know what I mean?
8599327	8603950	So it's like they're trying to put a band-aid over it and hope people forget.
8605425	8609367	I don't think they feel like it'll fix the problem either, but it doesn't hurt to donate money.
8609427	8609808	Shrug.
8610868	8611409	I agree.
8611649	8621516	Again, I'm certainly not hating on the donation, but there is that part of me that goes like, okay, well, you know, put your mouth where your money is, I guess is what I'm saying.
8623017	8624458	But, you know, nobody's perfect.
8624878	8628121	Lord knows I've said a lot of stupid shit on this show over the past 11 years.
8628801	8629241	So, anyway.
8629542	8634886	But the other thing I want to address, we have a lot of people in chat that are asking, what is cis?
8635286	8636347	And what is cisgender?
8636567	8638068	And teaching moment, teaching moment.
8638228	8639388	It means the gender you were born with.
8639948	8645970	Whatever your physical genitalia indicate that you are or your chromosomes indicate, that's what you are.
8646070	8648471	You agree with what you were born with.
8648571	8654692	Now there's certainly a reaction out there that people will go, well, I have male genitals and I'm male, but isn't that just normal?
8655893	8656433	For you it is.
8657210	8657390	Yes.
8657430	8657490	Yes.
8682337	8687032	as in you find more people biologically who agree with the gender that...
8689139	8694962	They genetically were predisposed towards, I guess.
8695042	8696803	It could be hormonal.
8696843	8699364	You also have people with multiple chromosome issues.
8700205	8705687	You still have people who were born hermaphroditic.
8705787	8714692	What was that story that was making the rounds about the man in China who went to have a problem and says, well, technically you're female.
8716312	8720254	He actually had multiple chromosomal issues, but they said he had female bits.
8720915	8722275	He just thought he was small.
8723156	8732981	But the whole thing, well that's what his doctor told him, but the government upheld, he'd been raised male, he lived male, the government upheld your man.
8733621	8734481	It's that type of thing.
8736102	8752053	Whatever, and I am not a big fan of labels in general because I think that labels are a good way, yeah, maybe you can embrace it to understand who you are for a degree of self-acceptance, but it's also ways that people try to categorize other people.
8753174	8757217	Queen Simeon, our chat says, that's kind of like calling white skin normal.
8758217	8759358	The flesh-colored crayon.
8760079	8761760	Heterosexual normal.
8762543	8767349	Well, and the big thing, and actually, I love people on Tumblr for this.
8767669	8777340	We're getting to see a lot more attention put on the asexuality community for people who just have no interest in it, which, okay, I'll go ahead.
8777360	8779683	For people who define their sexuality as none of the above.
8780223	8788608	You can be romantic, but not have... And it doesn't stop you from not... I've known several people in that category.
8788848	8789168	Exactly.
8789188	8789628	Not just one.
8789648	8790028	And you know what?
8790048	8790729	I'll go ahead and say it.
8790869	8791609	I'm in that category.
8792169	8793390	Don't like it.
8793570	8794050	Don't care.
8794070	8794871	I like reading about it.
8795931	8797392	I think porn is hilarious.
8797952	8800954	But I really don't... I never really have.
8801955	8804896	But you're in a fully functional... But I'm in a functional marriage.
8804936	8807898	And sometimes, you know, it makes me happy to make Dan happy.
8807918	8808278	Mm-hmm.
8808798	8810378	But it has nothing to say about him.
8810439	8811079	It's all me.
8811959	8814079	And he understands that and he's perfectly fine with that.
8814100	8815920	And I have no problem admitting it to anybody.
8817040	8818161	It's just not how I'm wired.
8819521	8834985	And I think that when you get to the point where you have people that are looking at something that they don't understand, where it doesn't fit into what their concept of normal is, there's going to be a reaction to it.
8835165	8837546	There's going to be people who go, oh, well, that's not normal.
8838226	8839648	That's not, I don't think that way.
8839708	8842651	I was raised to think that, well, it doesn't matter what you were raised to think.
8843152	8844253	What matters is what is.
8845154	8849379	Just because you were, oh my God, this actually goes back to the stupid Paula Deen thing too.
8849960	8853324	Just because you were raised to think that does not mean that you are right to think that.
8854629	8882718	let me get another one more comment here because I think this is an important one to end on Chiggers in chat says there's no such thing as a normal human and totally agree but that's kind of where the problem with you know Penny Arcade Guy's reaction lies is that when he says like you know if you use this term then you're an idiot essentially you know he's kind of like you know he's saying it's that he rejects that and I think that's just that's the issue you know among other things
8883228	8886911	I just say, you know, it doesn't matter what bits you were born with.
8886951	8890114	It doesn't matter if you love someone and don't want to sleep with them.
8890234	8892356	It doesn't matter if you want to sleep with them and don't love them.
8892917	8897881	You know, I guess that's kind of... But it just matters that you don't be an asshole.
8898862	8899563	Don't be an asshole.
8899583	8902345	This is a perfect comment to end on and then we'll go to the next story, Loki.
8902926	8904567	Drew Nami, fuck the haters.
8904867	8905248	Be you.
8906088	8906389	Amen.
8906549	8906889	Amen.
8907870	8908871	Well, and don't be an asshole.
8909147	8910308	All right, Loki, fuck the haters.
8910368	8911349	Be you with the next story.
8912830	8919815	So, yes, PlayStation Plus is not going to be required for the automatic updates on your PlayStation 4.
8919975	8927240	Remember, it does automatic updates in the background on the PlayStation 4, and right now that's only a feature that's on PlayStation Plus.
8927721	8931724	However, that's something that's going to change once the PlayStation 4 comes out, at least for the PlayStation 4.
8932845	8943335	It's not going to be tied to that, so you will still be able to do those auto-updates for game and system updates.
8943355	8943895	That's kind of cool.
8945697	8947399	But of course, they would like to encourage that you...
8951463	8952703	I was kind of disappointed.
8953304	8957527	I just signed up for PlayStation Plus and I remember they had the Instant Game Collection.
8957547	8959388	I didn't realize they cycled titles out of that.
8960408	8964511	So you have to kind of download them at the time in order to be able to play some of them.
8964531	8968534	Because I wanted to do the Echo and Shadow of the Colossus collection and stuff like that.
8969214	8970776	Final Fantasy XIV
8991873	8995236	I have yet to play it, so it'll be interesting.
9006162	9007142	It's fun.
9007643	9008063	It looks fun.
9008183	9009043	Yeah, you'll have fun with it.
9009663	9011744	Alright, moving on to this story.
9011764	9012564	I find this interesting.
9012604	9015245	This is about Dungeons & Dragons Chronicles of Mystaria.
9015665	9019266	Now, this game just came out on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network.
9019326	9023327	It's remasters of the old 90s arcade games, which were awesome, by the way.
9023787	9028669	But in Japan, they're getting a special PlayStation 3 retail release.
9029129	9032470	Exclusive features and enhancements not in the digital version.
9032910	9033190	What?
9034391	9042775	I mean, this sounds great, don't get me wrong, but why were there two versions of this game being done, and why is the better one exclusive to Japan?
9043756	9054602	Because the new one has the color edit feature, multiple players can play as the same character, there's an in-depth series of options, you can toggle features like random damage and breakable weapons.
9057503	9058064	I don't get it.
9059614	9059934	Oh well.
9060594	9066877	Luckily the PlayStation 3 is region free so if you feel very strongly about it, ultimately I'll be satisfied with the digital version here.
9067197	9073720	But if you feel strongly, if you really love these games, the good news is PlayStation 3 is region free so import it from Japan.
9073940	9074460	Have a ball.
9074880	9078241	Just hope you can read the Japanese text or know the game well enough to get around it.
9079342	9079862	So there you go.
9080642	9084384	It's that time of the week where we go to the mailbag and read some of your emails.
9084464	9085805	Are you good to do that tonight?
9085845	9086325	I'll be okay.
9086345	9086885	There's only four.
9087478	9089079	Oh my god, there were only two earlier.
9089159	9090919	Okay, let's go to the mailbag.
9091900	9095962	Well, if there were other, they were Russian or Mandarin, which I don't speak either.
9095982	9097142	We have a huge influx.
9097462	9098543	I know a word in Russian.
9098943	9100443	Duh.
9100483	9100703	Yet.
9101084	9116530	Just to throw it out there, our mailbag is still mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com However, I'm strongly contemplating changing that in the coming weeks if for nothing else than to flush out the spam because we're getting too much of it.
9117225	9120328	I actually would recommend that we switch it through a Google account.
9121188	9123230	Unfortunately, you have to pay for those now for business accounts.
9123531	9123751	No.
9124011	9124391	Yes, you do.
9124451	9125392	Well, what about the redirects?
9126773	9127134	I don't know.
9127454	9128235	I will look into that.
9128915	9130517	Because I really like Google's filters.
9130817	9131217	Yeah, I know.
9131517	9132078	I know, me too.
9132258	9132899	We'll talk about it later.
9132939	9134140	You have to pay for that now, unfortunately.
9134160	9135661	But we will talk about that offline.
9135681	9136141	I have a dollar.
9136422	9139624	For now, continue using mailbag at orangelaundry.com.
9139644	9142727	We will flood the Twitter and all that stuff when we change.
9144368	9149890	Dear OLR, I'm sorry I couldn't get through last week as I was eager to discuss my own thoughts on E3 with you.
9150571	9157413	With Next Generation officially across the horizon, I find myself reminiscing about my own journey with gaming.
9158154	9161935	I discovered the arcades in the late 70s and immediately fell in love with video games.
9162035	9164476	I moved off friends that owned 2600s before Christmas.
9164956	9166477	My father bought us an Atari 5200.
9166977	9168018	I got two of those.
9168038	9168578	They're awesome.
9169318	9170919	I love that thing, terrible controllers and all.
9171019	9171739	Yes, thank you.
9171759	9174581	The controllers of 5200 are ass.
9174961	9178503	Dan just rebuilt two controllers so that we could go to Atari party.
9179984	9180224	Okay.
9180604	9186747	My software career began as a game tester for Sega, testing games like Dark Wizard on Sega CD and Aladdin for Game Gear.
9186988	9192771	I even owned my own retail store when I rented out import games and met a lot of local developers from Namco, Capcom, and EA.
9193471	9196692	I have since left the gaming industry but have remained dedicated to the community at large.
9196832	9200354	I have probably owned nearly every major console and portable in the last 20 years.
9202094	9202895	Sorry for being sniffy.
9203675	9205456	I find myself in a strange position these days.
9205516	9208837	I've pre-ordered both the PS4 and the much maligned Xbox One.
9209317	9211778	Rob remains one of my two friends on the Wii U, by the way.
9211878	9212298	Haha.
9213079	9219121	You guys have described coming to E3 as if it was a death march, and I guess that I really didn't perceive it as such.
9220020	9225265	I won't go so far as to say that I agree with every policy that's being introduced, but I'm not frightened either.
9225886	9230470	I wonder if the core gaming community is simply intimidated by what this change might mean.
9230850	9234333	This is, after all, the final transition into a digital delivery only reality.
9234594	9237677	Of course, since then, they've kind of backpedaled.
9238497	9241620	BlackWolfInChat is asking, so can this guy fix my Neo Geo?
9242621	9242902	Maybe.
9244243	9246325	Bobby, I'm still checking some of my resources.
9246705	9247025	Trust me.
9247265	9249527	Who emailed this?
9250148	9250608	DarkCharger.
9250788	9253371	If DarkCharger's listening and you can fix Neo Geos, please let us know.
9253991	9256614	Yeah, and if you can mod my Neo Geo, I'm just kidding.
9256674	9257935	We're going to bring you business, buddy.
9257955	9259296	Did I tell you how we got a Neo Geo?
9260197	9261678	Dan traded his Sega CD for it.
9261698	9262619	That's how we have a Neo Geo.
9265662	9266082	where was I?
9267123	9286376	still I look at all the amazing games at E3 and I couldn't imagine myself not being part of that the 6 year old in me that walked into that first arcade still finds excitement at how gaming is getting better and frankly cheaper the Xbox One makes sense for me as a primary console because I actually am really looking forward to the multimedia features I want an all in one solution for games IPTV etc
9287737	9294341	My relatives are all excited that I will be sharing my gaming library with them because they know I buy a ton of games.
9294901	9299524	For them, this opens up gaming in ways not previously available, especially those that live out of the immediate area.
9300441	9303542	I'm still getting the PS4 for the exclusives, J imports, and indie games.
9305303	9315668	Amidst all the excitement, I find myself a bit sad that I no longer quite fit in the same way with the core gaming community that I identified with for so long.
9316489	9323612	Perhaps the years of my own career as an online gaming software developer have skewed that perceptive, I guess maybe perception is what I meant,
9323772	9324313	Thank you for watching.
9324353	9325414	I'll see you next time.
9342813	9370918	you know there's a lot of passionate opinions right now don't let Twitter and Facebook and the things that people say when there's nobody around there to immediately like yell at them for what they're saying don't take that with too much weight like you know yeah I was pretty miserable going into this year's E3 and I understand where people were excited about pushing things forward and some of these new ideas that Microsoft was going to bring to the table although it was a big nebula we didn't really know um
9372631	9376212	I don't think that means doom and gloom that they didn't go that way either.
9376312	9384914	I think it just says that $60 is a lot to pay for a game and people want control over what they do when they're done with that game.
9386675	9394377	By the time these consoles come out, I think you'll hear a lot more about the games themselves because people will be actually playing them and this will get a lot better.
9395472	9396313	Well, there's a P.S.
9396373	9396673	on this.
9397635	9398235	It says, P.S.
9398375	9403101	If you have never done it, please do a classic game of the week on Treasure's Yu Yu Hakusho for a Mega Drive.
9403441	9404282	That was a good game.
9404963	9410109	But now, though, I'm really sad because my favorite song from that series just popped into my head, Sayonara Bye Bye.
9410870	9412592	I did watch quite a bit of Yu Yu Hakusho.
9412853	9414535	Sounds like it could be a classic game soon.
9415199	9416319	Well, don't let me forget about it.
9416519	9417220	That was a good game.
9418900	9421061	Alright, hello, OLR Radio.
9421101	9424301	That's kind of a redundant R. I love the crew.
9424422	9425662	Hello, ATM machine.
9427322	9428103	Hello, PIN number.
9430363	9432604	To all gamers, can't we all just get along?
9433204	9434984	Please, go and pre-order an Xbox One.
9435465	9437885	We can't let a little negativity take us out of the game.
9437925	9440486	Show Microsoft that we are there through thick and thin.
9440926	9444167	Let's face it, $900 for both consoles ain't bad.
9445453	9446234	Dude, you know what?
9446354	9447975	That's almost a month of rent.
9447995	9454300	Yeah, I hate to say it, but... Whatever your income is, I want it.
9454320	9456381	Yeah, I hate to say it.
9456441	9457522	Tell your daddy to adopt me.
9458002	9470612	Well, or, you know, to give this guy a little credit, if it's $900 spread across a year, and I can buy one console this year and one console next year, that's far more reasonable, and probably what I will do.
9471432	9472453	Okay.
9472473	9472893	Jamie Munn?
9473174	9477457	You could also do it on a payment... I can't speak.
9477517	9478458	A payment plan?
9478678	9480019	Tequila finally caught up with me.
9480179	9480860	Are you dunk?
9481240	9481841	I'm dunk.
9481941	9484163	Or a responsible credit card use.
9484183	9485043	Responsible credit card.
9485143	9489507	I pre-ordered the Xbox One on my Best Buy credit card, and it's like...
9489947	9496110	No interest for 18 months, so I'm going to be paying that off over the 18 months so I don't get hammered with the interest by then.
9496190	9497970	I'll tell you what happened when we got our PS3, right?
9497990	9500591	Because we bought the top model one and controllers and everything.
9501192	9502772	We used our Discover card.
9503092	9504473	We got a $100 rebate back on it.
9504733	9505433	That's right.
9505754	9506734	Discover does cash back, right?
9507518	9521065	it's like for every sum amount you spend you get a percentage back and in this case too because Dan also was a GameStop manager he got a discount on hardware and the games so we actually ended up getting it for cheaper than the lower model
9523795	9524575	I miss those days.
9525656	9527097	Anyway, where was I?
9529079	9529659	One last thing.
9529759	9531521	No need to upgrade those PCs anymore.
9531541	9537866	The consoles have high-end PC specs on a unified platform, which will allow the devs to create high-end PC games for those consoles.
9537926	9538467	Thank you, Sam.
9538947	9541469	Yeah, except I can't use Photoshop on my Xbox.
9541969	9542770	So, wrong.
9544091	9544371	Yet.
9545292	9545512	No.
9546393	9548535	I cannot effectively use Photoshop...
9549844	9550564	What if they hack it?
9550985	9551905	Not true, actually.
9551985	9556307	The next iteration of Photoshop is actually going to be in the cloud.
9556567	9559829	Like I said, effectively use it.
9560629	9561870	Keyboard and mouse support?
9562950	9564951	Think about the whole thing.
9565151	9566452	Using a higher-end monitor?
9567372	9569013	It supports 4K output.
9569033	9571454	You could get a really good level of precision, possibly.
9573175	9574195	But I can't use a controller.
9574276	9574996	Humor the thought.
9576112	9590744	And besides that, I like having my window open while I am looking at my Tumblr and chatting with Becky and playing with Kat and, you know... And wondering why you never got your project done.
9591145	9593967	Do you know what I had to draw the other day?
9594067	9594388	What?
9594908	9595909	A turkey drinking beer.
9597000	9597441	Random.
9597461	9598241	It was awesome.
9599583	9602566	And here I am, high on Robitussin, drawing a turkey, drinking beer.
9602946	9603607	It's for charity.
9604888	9609293	Which, by the way, thank you, Matt, so much for Grandpa Matt.
9610634	9613157	But yeah, I think what you're sort of forgetting.
9613177	9616300	Did somebody literally hire you after all your demands?
9616500	9617962	No, I'm doing pro bono work.
9618782	9621284	It goes in my portfolio.
9621704	9624165	I'm not knocking... Charity is good.
9624645	9625026	It's good.
9625506	9629088	And I'm not knocking anything that's going to... You've done great stuff for Unloud too, so it's all charity.
9629388	9632430	I'm not going to knock anything, especially that's going to feed the homeless.
9633250	9636392	And as soon as I get the okay about this, I will say something on the show.
9636672	9638113	Okay.
9638673	9644016	But at any rate, you've got a lot more versatility with a PC.
9644516	9645337	I'm just putting it there.
9645757	9649442	Multitasking on a PC, far easier.
9649602	9655109	I think the game system should be dedicated towards only the entertainment purposes.
9655509	9660596	And for the record, I can play Star Trek online and watch Episodes of Supernatural at the same time, so shut up.
9661130	9664993	Now, I wasn't really hearing enough of the why in that email.
9665033	9667375	I was hearing you should support Microsoft because you're a gamer.
9667435	9668295	But why?
9668896	9670497	I'm supporting Sony because I'm a gamer.
9670557	9672839	Then Microsoft should support me too.
9673900	9677823	And those old policies, I think they supported corporate interests.
9677863	9678763	They didn't support me.
9679164	9680765	Call me whatever name you want in the book.
9681285	9687550	I just believe that when you invest $60 in the game, it should be up to you what you do with that game when you're done with it and not Microsoft.
9687570	9687650	Okay.
9688190	9704524	and here's the other thing too as an adult consumer I sat and looked at them even after Microsoft did their backpedal and looked at them side by side and said what is going to be the better use of my money what's going to give me more of what I want and less of what I don't
9705876	9707597	But I respect your opinion, emailer.
9707857	9711479	And I think we will hear more about this.
9711699	9719142	And I don't think we'll really have the answer to this whole console war until we know more about what this is going to look like day one.
9719162	9721223	Because we still don't know what day these are coming out.
9721263	9722684	We don't know what games are making launch.
9723084	9725325	There's still a lot of nebulous on both sides.
9726065	9727206	In the end, I'm growing up.
9727246	9727786	I do what I want.
9732106	9741717	Okay, I got logged out of chat too Hey OLR, before we get Oh god, this one's long That's what she said Or he
9745000	9746602	The stare she gave Rob.
9746903	9747984	Rob got the ADS.
9748885	9749566	Hey, LLR.
9749987	9750327	Hey.
9752650	9759359	Before getting into the meat of this letter, I'd like to send my condolences to the family, friends, and associates of David, Knuckles, Dawson, and Dreger for their loss.
9760140	9765923	The loss of a person that meant so much to so many people is saddening and helps to put things in perspective.
9766343	9769945	All the anger and hate on both sides of the Xbox One debate seems to be meaningless in times like this.
9770485	9775448	While it never truly gets better the pain eases with time especially if you hold on to the memories of who that person was.
9776729	9778330	With that said, it's time to get to the point.
9779091	9789118	With the Xbox One's draconian DRM policies being reversed, there are many people, including Bobby Blackwolf and Cliff Blazinski, who are looking at the consumer's victory as a horrible loss of innovation.
9789258	9790960	I already know how this email is signed.
9793281	9793782	But go on.
9794918	9797179	Yeah, I'm going to read it.
9798039	9798999	Every gamer has a voice.
9801019	9804480	Bobby was particularly sarcastic bordering on spiteful earlier tonight.
9805360	9807181	Why don't you send Bobby this letter, not us?
9807561	9808261	Keep going.
9808541	9815242	These people have gotten on my damn nerves and have gotten to the point where I can barely stand to see or hear their exclusive ravings.
9815743	9822024	The narrative they seem to be sticking to is we're blocking, quote, progress and imperiling the industry.
9822504	9825407	My anger towards this is for one simple reason.
9825528	9827950	I do not oppose the existence of digital distribution.
9828451	9831274	While I don't use DRM- God, stop.
9832275	9836640	While I don't use DRM-based services like Steam, I don't even oppose their existence.
9837060	9838942	I understand that lots of people like Steam and that's fine.
9838962	9839863	It just isn't for me.
9840484	9846306	However, the Xbox One was designed in such a way to take away the choice of the traditional disc-based games.
9846746	9852128	People like myself who enjoy a more flexible model of physical distribution were upset because we didn't want it taken away.
9852548	9860070	We didn't want to take away digital, for those of you who prefer that, but the way Bobby Blackwolf, Shadow Next Gen, and the like go on.
9860090	9861170	Oh God, I'm sorry.
9861971	9868733	You think we're all some rabid Luddites in mud huts trying our best to destroy any purpose at all costs.
9868753	9869073	Okay.
9869853	9870774	No, no, no.
9871174	9872435	When I saw the rest of it.
9872575	9873356	Where was that?
9873476	9874317	Okay, look, look.
9874797	9877359	This is a reaction, not an action.
9877479	9879781	I respect your passionate opinion.
9879921	9885987	However, I'm losing respect for this email and the way you're lashing out.
9886067	9887368	Because come on.
9888188	9892172	Bobby didn't say that in that way.
9892212	9893933	And this whole thing with Mud Hudson.
9893973	9894574	So come on.
9896234	9898256	I get your point.
9898876	9907302	I understand the whole, I feel like consumers are trying to take away what's rightfully mine and all this stuff.
9907382	9908002	I get that.
9908483	9911445	But I also understand why Bobby was like,
9912065	9912906	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9937670	9942174	Bobby and Chad is responding right now saying, I'm happy we can get back to talking about the games.
9942474	9944716	And I think that's a good way to put it.
9944956	9956425	I'm trying to see if there's anything... I just... Like... The Cliffy B thing, I'm okay with you dragging him a little bit because Cliffy B can be a little bit bullheaded with his opinions.
9956485	9961268	But my point is that these other guys you're calling out in your email, they're not so bullheaded.
9961428	9961648	Like...
9962909	9964690	But they do have some different opinions.
9965130	9968890	Yes, they are supporting Microsoft because they think a little differently about this stuff.
9968930	9972911	And I don't think that makes them anti-consumer or anti-anything.
9973211	9974372	They're just different.
9974832	9980153	What I was reading further into this email is that I think that... I'll go ahead and say it.
9980213	9983734	Raw Steel UT is under the impression that...
9985194	9996585	There is a backlash against people who prefer the traditional method of distribution, saying that because of people like you, we can't have this.
9997326	10002290	We are being made to suffer because you have, in our opinion, an antiquated point of view.
10002310	10005353	Oh, and I did see some of that on Twitter this week.
10005373	10005613	Yes.
10006154	10008056	Not from the individuals you named, however.
10008817	10013263	And he is trying to say, no, I don't care about digital distribution.
10013423	10016487	I don't like to be limited to digital distribution.
10017047	10017848	And I agree with you.
10017909	10018830	I think there should be both.
10019289	10021451	I think that they can have both methods.
10021911	10023332	They can have their online model.
10023372	10024833	They can have a disc-based model.
10025073	10026174	Make the online model cheaper.
10027334	10032798	If you're going to pay for physical materials, then pay for physical materials and the cost of shipping.
10032858	10033599	You want it physical?
10033819	10034519	Deal with it physically.
10036000	10041144	I buy PC games in equal measure, digital and physical.
10041284	10045527	For example, when I went on my rampage to find Mass Effect 3 before I found out how bad it was, not bad.
10046047	10047008	It's fun to play.
10047228	10048308	It's just story-wise.
10050090	10073483	I got Best Buy to knock down the price and I got a physical copy because I got the better deal for it and I had to pay shipping so by the same token you know if it had been 20 bucks you know on sale on Steam or something which it would have been on Steam but that's just my point I would have bought it on Steam in a heartbeat I would have bought whatever one suited my financial purposes better
10074784	10076025	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10090581	10092722	Steam is really the king of that right now.
10093122	10097524	And if Microsoft had been able to go down that route, Steam would have had a little bit of competition.
10097584	10099764	And that competition would have been healthy for the industry.
10100145	10111469	But because the consumer spoke up and said, we want our disks and we want it this way, we will never know what digital 2.0, for lack of a better term, will look like.
10112566	10119928	I don't think Bobby feels or even Shadow Next Gen feels that that's somebody's fault or it's because of whining or something like that.
10120028	10127910	But it goes without saying, we're not going to know what that future of digital looks like right now because we just weren't ready for it.
10128730	10133992	However, my perspective is, why can't we just have both?
10135942	10138743	and I think that's what Microsoft should work on next.
10138883	10144346	And chat room, I would encourage you not to basically talk shit about Rostel UT behind his back.
10144486	10144686	Mm-hmm.
10145446	10147187	That is immature, unnecessary.
10147207	10148167	You can talk about his attitude.
10148467	10148707	Mm-hmm.
10149108	10153990	You know, you can disagree with the points that he's made but don't dismiss somebody's opinion.
10154190	10154410	Mm-hmm.
10154850	10157031	You know, he has a valid point from his point of view.
10157051	10157531	Mm-hmm.
10157731	10160493	You know... Although I... Although I think it's short-sighted.
10161333	10161473	Mm-hmm.
10162737	10165058	I will go ahead and read his last paragraph.
10165358	10167019	Go ahead.
10167559	10172142	As to the Xbox One now, I'm still not getting it because of the camera, where he and I are in the same boat there.
10172762	10176144	I'm not afraid of the potential for spying as it can be used offline.
10176244	10182527	However, that Microsoft has the balls to ask me to pay $100 more for a console they've already admitted is weaker than the PS4.
10182947	10186168	Not only that, but the PS4 will likely have more exclusive when all is said and done.
10186649	10188810	When MS drops the Kinect and the price to go with it.
10190251	10196362	Between the PS4 and the Wii U, I have more than enough gaming to go for the next six to eight years without Microsoft.
10196402	10197143	Anyway, thanks for reading.
10197164	10198005	Hope you all have a good day.
10198065	10198867	Regards, Rostel UT.
10199747	10206490	And like I said, I think that what I'm seeing going on is a bit of hard-headedness on multiple sides.
10207310	10211912	I think that he's got a misperception of what Bobby and everybody's saying.
10213153	10218395	And I think at the same time, maybe there's a bit of a misperception of where he's coming from.
10219556	10222417	So I think people just need to sit down, drop the attitude, and talk.
10223758	10246070	I agree and I need to say this in defense of my friend and my associate Bobby Blackwolf you don't know the half of what Bobby's been dealing with this week and Bobby puts on the show that he does out of love for the gaming industry and Bobby does not deserve some of what you gave him tonight play nice
10247391	10275514	celebrate the different opinions talk respectfully amongst each other and try to learn from each other don't throw fits and walk off I would have stopped reading where I did regardless if you hadn't called it but I did think though he brought up the valid point with the last paragraph just saying I agree with that too they all have valid points where every gamer has a voice you have a valid point and you have a valid point and you have a valid point
10277406	10296859	You know, and this is my big thing, again, I really hate when people try to single other people out as, and you know, he was accusing, in his letter, I didn't go too far into that part, but he was accusing him and people like him of being scapegoat, being turned into scapegoats.
10297120	10298981	I think you're sort of doing the same thing, so.
10299681	10303324	Yeah, that's, yeah, yeah, that's my, kind of my point exactly.
10303344	10303424	Yeah.
10303973	10318158	You need to, I think, and this actually goes with any issue, anything that people have big disagreements on, whether it be social, political, religious, video games, shit that does not matter, shit that does matter.
10319538	10325400	Respect that people are going to be out there that think differently from you and make your approach to where you were trying to understand them.
10327180	10327821	With anything.
10328261	10331982	You don't know what you're talking about until you've walked into the person's shoes.
10332622	10334743	For the record though, Cliffy B never has a valid point.
10335043	10335443	No, he doesn't.
10338704	10339484	How about the last email?
10339544	10340765	I just wanted to make sure that was clear.
10341285	10345326	Dear OLR, disclaimer, please excuse any and all grammatical errors.
10346386	10348927	I guess for you I could do it, lady.
10349907	10352788	First off, I'd like to say you guys do an amazing job.
10353369	10354429	Love the show as always.
10354629	10357070	This week makes 10 years since my father passed away.
10357090	10357550	I'm sorry.
10358150	10360951	And I will never forget how the show was there for me in my time of need.
10361511	10364574	You guys were always there for others, and I love that about the show.
10365154	10367116	I just wanted to say thanks for everything, you guys.
10367176	10369698	DarkTetsuya had the pleasure of staying with me for about four weeks.
10370179	10371440	I'm enjoying every moment of it.
10371660	10374202	If it weren't for you guys and the show, I don't think we would have even met.
10374662	10375603	Thanks again, you guys.
10375743	10376744	Sincerely, GamerGirl.
10376964	10377505	This is Michelle.
10380287	10381068	DT, HappyHookup
10399930	10403352	Which is so, like, I don't want to say weird because that makes it a negative.
10403392	10404092	It's a happy weird.
10404132	10404912	It's a good weird.
10405273	10406313	Like me, a good weird.
10406653	10408294	Unexpected.
10408594	10413937	It's weird in the good way to me, like, the impact that this show has had on that level.
10414397	10417718	Where, like, people's lives, yo, have been affected by this.
10417738	10418339	It's uncanny.
10418819	10420140	So... How's that, Rob?
10420420	10420600	Uncanny.
10420700	10423401	Yeah, I don't... I mean, it's... There are no cans here.
10423621	10424942	It's... I mean, in a way...
10426607	10433813	I mean, I knew Alan on LiveJournal for years, but it wasn't really until he started listening to this show that he started to get to know me better.
10433953	10437296	Now we live in sin.
10438977	10440258	I'm glad you're adopting that.
10441239	10445402	We were talking about that before the show, when Prop 8's overturned.
10445723	10446183	We hope.
10446363	10448005	Well, it's going to happen.
10448765	10450066	It's only a matter of time.
10450306	10454450	Even if it's not the Supreme Court that does it, it'll just go back to a vote and it'll get overturned then.
10455308	10455809	I like that.
10455829	10455989	Um,
10484226	10496139	Oh yeah, I was actually gonna say, you know, I think when people start sort of discounting the whole internet thing, keep in mind, I met my husband online, okay?
10497160	10501484	Dan and I were two dumb young 20 anime nerds.
10502829	10522744	Light playing Street Fighter and talking about the Japanese versions of Marvel Super Heroes and you know he liked pinball and I thought pinball was cool and then just we talked it out and six months after we started talking on the phone I was like hey I'm about to lose my job can I come live with you?
10523684	10531290	I guess I'm gonna go see Batman which is pretty much how that conversation went and I was on a plane you know a month later
10532290	10536613	I met Dan when his username was DarkRyoga, and I was DarkUchan.
10536633	10538375	How's that?
10538975	10544098	I actually had DarkUchan before I had DarkSakura, just saying.
10546200	10549182	So Ranma calls me by my oldest, oldest nickname.
10551784	10558128	So, how, you know, you met Alan online, although didn't you have a previous sort of meeting with him?
10559261	10559742	S, Actdeft,
10570509	10570869	Oh, wow.
10570889	10571029	Yeah.
10593760	10595582	So our friends over at Gamebuoy.org.
10596784	10604073	So yeah, one of us saw the... I think you friended me through the comments there and we got to know each other for a few years that way.
10604513	10611983	But you were my friend on LiveJournal through the whole X who shall not be named Voldemort thing.
10612583	10614565	Hey, he gave me a sparkly pin.
10614965	10617707	We didn't meet until we met at Video Games Live in Oakland, right?
10617747	10618507	That barely counts because...
10635342	10640427	We shook hands and then the lights went down to say that the show was starting.
10641408	10644270	So, but yeah, we got to look at each other then.
10645671	10651096	And then, when did you, you started listening to OLR and then that's when we started talking more, right?
10651617	10651777	Yeah.
10652958	10654880	So, this show ruining lives.
10656201	10660445	By the way, they're asking if RuPaul would be the Reverend and I said no, Peter's Christ.
10660625	10661466	No, no.
10667207	10668448	Yes, I'm aware.
10668668	10673654	So I just want you all to know I'm skipping drag queens to be here for the 11th birthday.
10673674	10674815	That's how much I love you all.
10676076	10676637	They're amazing.
10677858	10679220	Who, the drag queens or the listeners?
10680101	10680601	Everybody.
10682611	10683712	What a safe answer.
10683772	10684293	I love him.
10684493	10684914	All right.
10685554	10686856	So, yeah.
10687476	10690500	Anyone who ever wants to poo-poo on the internet, say, fuck you.
10690620	10695485	People get married on the internet or together or they get togethered on the internet.
10696266	10696606	Joined.
10696766	10697047	Joined.
10697147	10697808	That's good word, joined.
10698368	10698849	Live in sin.
10699149	10700170	Live in sin.
10700370	10701832	I lived in sin with Dan for seven years.
10702653	10704074	And then we finally just said, fuck it.
10705091	10706212	Nothing wrong with a little sin.
10706572	10706772	Yeah.
10706812	10707092	Alright.
10707152	10708413	I like sin.
10708934	10710074	It tastes like tequila.
10710154	10713316	It's 9.30 and we need to keep the show moving.
10713817	10715658	So let's get to the FUs.
10715758	10718600	Oh, Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com if you want to send us an email.
10718620	10719040	That's it.
10719220	10720001	I'm not reading anymore.
10720841	10721802	That was it though, wasn't it?
10721882	10722622	That's pretty much it.
10722662	10722882	Alright.
10723183	10724664	Mailbag at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
10724684	10725864	In the meanwhile, FUs of the week.
10725904	10726565	Let's try to make them quick.
10742487	10749960	Um, I'd like to say F you to the collision detection on JV Mon's body for hitting his tattoo.
10750921	10756330	And the stupid bitch face, and I'm saying bitch face because I don't know who the fuck it was, but whatever.
10757495	10765159	Okay, people, I don't know if it's a California thing or what, but when people change lanes and they're on the inside lane, you're supposed to stay in the inside lane.
10765239	10770082	When you are on the outside part of the turning lane, you're supposed to go into the second lane, not the third.
10770482	10774384	Well, Bitchface decides to go from the inside lane into the second lane where I was.
10774764	10778826	Where I was legally, because you're not supposed to change lanes in the fucking intersection.
10779206	10779467	Fuck.
10780067	10780267	Okay.
10782340	10783601	Care to follow that, Jvmon?
10785201	10790664	F you to myself because the tequila's just hitting me now and I forgot the F you that I had planned.
10791204	10793025	Sure you're gonna be able to drive?
10793045	10793705	Alright.
10794726	10796186	Maybe.
10796206	10797487	We better talk later.
10797527	10797827	Alright.
10800148	10800508	Loki.
10800769	10801529	Fuck you, deployers.
10803573	10804575	Oh, you and your programming.
10805937	10810465	And my FU of the week goes to having to get up at 6.30 tomorrow for the job.
10810485	10813150	But I love my job, but I don't like getting up early for it, that's all.
10814477	10816498	All right, just a couple quick stories for you guys.
10816519	10817539	We've got to get to the Skype line.
10817859	10818100	Loki.
10818440	10826025	Real quick, there was an opinion piece on Polygon, and I just thought it kind of brought up an interesting point.
10826586	10836673	They're talking about Microsoft and Sony and kind of Microsoft backpedaling in their DRM focus and stuff like that, and they're saying that while this is a good thing right now,
10837373	10850116	There is a very good chance that they are going to introduce some fun features like the game sharing and stuff to kind of draw people more to digital where they're going to implement this DRM.
10850796	10861258	So that basically, very well now we have a good situation where the consumer feels like it has a lot of power that this could very well change
10862458	10867000	over time to kind of be back to where they wanted it to be in the first place.
10869081	10871001	I don't know if that's going to actually happen.
10871041	10874423	I think a lot of people would be kind of hesitant.
10875223	10879725	Once again, it's all about how they explain how they're going to do things.
10880185	10889509	If they have a good way of explaining it and basically it makes it well worth it as far as the incentives to going this route, then...
10890229	10892273	By all means, I mean, I guess they could try doing that.
10892654	10898205	You know, if there's enough pluses to it versus the negatives, that's just, you kind of have to weigh it.
10901141	10901862	So, yeah.
10902663	10904645	I don't think that they're going to go back like that.
10904805	10909830	But I do think that they may bring back some of the features that they took away from the Xbox One.
10910912	10912633	You know, maybe the game sharing and stuff like that.
10913054	10919341	Although, if it was what it, you know, the rumor would be, you know, from that pay spin or whatever, and it was just a demo, that's kind of lame anyways.
10919501	10923105	I mean, they do that with PlayStation Plus where you get demos for a bunch of games.
10924033	10929803	All I'm going to say, again, the simplest way I can put it, what are the positives to outweigh the negatives?
10929984	10930405	Exactly.
10930445	10932889	Explain that better, you'll get it.
10935618	10940801	Real quick, because I want to get to our Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10941201	10945243	Real quick tonight, because we're running long due to the technical difficulties in the studio earlier.
10946024	10949486	And I apologize because it is an anniversary episode, so I'm sure there's a few of you that want to call in.
10950046	10955849	But quickly, quickly on this story here, EA is confirming no online passes.
10956069	10959471	Even in spite of the news this week, online passes will not be coming back.
10959591	10961051	Yay!
10961232	10967234	This is from Senior Director of Corporate Communications, John Reisberg for EA.
10967334	10970315	Quote, There is no change to our decision to discontinue Online Pass.
10970415	10970915	It is dead.
10971275	10977337	As we said a few weeks ago, none of our new EA titles will include Online Pass, and we are removing it from existing games as well.
10977457	10983539	Nothing else on today's news, but did want to be clear that our Online Pass decision was based on player feedback, and there's no change.
10983799	10984899	Long live the Cloud Pass!
10985420	10986320	Hallelujah!
10987200	10989021	Oh yeah, the Cloud Pass.
10990202	10991223	Don't talk like that.
10991383	10991663	Alright.
10991683	10997968	1877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio if you'd like to give us a call.
10998708	11000610	And yeah, we'll get to the phones there.
11001310	11003972	Meanwhile, Twitter topics and last minute stories.
11004733	11012218	I bet you didn't know that today, this day, is actually the 22nd birthday of Sonic the Hedgehog.
11012979	11013379	That's right.
11013419	11014880	I heard we share a birthday with Sonic.
11016300	11017682	It's that 23 thing, you know?
11017962	11018342	Mm-hmm.
11019243	11019523	Mm-hmm.
11019804	11022466	Did you know that I flew out here on the 23rd of January?
11022827	11023407	No, I didn't know that.
11023427	11024008	Years and years ago.
11024228	11026330	Well, I probably did know that, but I just forgot.
11027492	11028232	Jeez, Rab.
11028333	11028813	Jeez.
11029934	11030174	All right.
11030194	11031015	Been out here 15 years.
11031035	11031416	Jeez.
11031836	11034799	Our phones are lighting up, so let's go to them and see who's online.
11034839	11035780	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
11035800	11036141	Who's this?
11037025	11039927	You know, you wanted to go see Raven, but you got me instead.
11039987	11040648	Raven's Dolphin.
11040728	11042609	What up, Raven's Dolphin?
11042850	11043570	It's video.
11043830	11047694	I love special... I know, now you get to see the video that the listeners... And he has ponies.
11047734	11048474	I'm leaving the room.
11049915	11052277	That's exactly why I called, but let's not talk about them.
11052337	11053078	You're a brony.
11053138	11053638	It's cool.
11053678	11054039	It's cool.
11054079	11054319	All right.
11054679	11055340	I didn't say that.
11057201	11057481	I don't know.
11057501	11057702	All right.
11057722	11058822	That's not true.
11059123	11064007	I see two big dolls, and I see one, two, three, four little ones, and two little... What are those?
11064047	11064527	Hamsters?
11064567	11064987	I can't tell.
11065047	11065428	It's fuzzy.
11066044	11068265	I would forgive you if you had a classic one up there
11089004	11091225	You know, I wanted to talk about the whole DRM thing.
11091285	11100867	I know everyone wants to talk about that, but for me, for me being a gamer so long, is I didn't like how Microsoft's tone to everything.
11101508	11112991	Like, when they said about the submarines, about the people like, oh, we got a box for you, the 360, or when they say all kinds of draconian shit, it makes me, my head just explodes.
11113011	11113371	I'm like...
11114451	11115812	You're drowning yourself.
11115852	11121657	So their tone for me is why I bought a PlayStation 4.
11121797	11125820	How did you feel when you heard about the reversal, though, despite that tone?
11125960	11129743	I mean, I know Bobby wanted to push innovation and all that stuff, and I get that.
11130043	11131284	I totally get Bobby's point.
11131565	11133166	I've listened to him.
11133927	11137269	But the reversal, I think, was key.
11137309	11138971	People are like, but this is going to slow growth.
11140034	11163467	but Microsoft tried to force us into what I think of a future that we wasn't ready for me I wasn't ready for that future because I like my internet connection I like all that stuff but I live with a bunch of jackasses that can take it away from me in two seconds so for me it's like I have this thing that is a brick I don't I know your family don't have this but my family's fucked up about the internet
11166386	11172371	What did I say earlier in the show about diversity and everyone's life is different and it affects those opinions that we have, you know?
11173231	11173652	Certainly.
11174592	11177735	Yes, so it would be a big, shiny $500 brick.
11177975	11180858	So for me, it's like the offline mode.
11180898	11183960	And, you know, the online is important, but I don't want to be married to it.
11185602	11186302	I think that's fair.
11186783	11193708	Well, okay, you said you pre-ordered a PlayStation 4, so what do you look... I'm sorry, you said you're going to get a PlayStation 4, so what are you looking forward to on PlayStation 4?
11194885	11199667	You know, believe it or not, I'm looking forward to absolutely none of the exclusives, Battlefield 4.
11201768	11203088	That's fair, though.
11203588	11206310	You know, the third-party games are important, too.
11207130	11211411	And I do a lot of you streaming stuff, so I'm like, that's why I want to get that.
11211451	11214753	I'm like, well, it's the cheapest, Battlefield 4, it's going to look great.
11215513	11216253	It was a done deal.
11217054	11217274	Awesome.
11217294	11217854	The games will come.
11218504	11218864	All right.
11219525	11219926	Fair enough.
11219966	11220386	Sounds good to me.
11220426	11224370	I'll see you online because I ordered a PlayStation 4 as well.
11224851	11227153	I know we have to go, but one more thing.
11227373	11228554	I mean, just one more thing.
11228574	11229015	Sure.
11229235	11231818	You're still sticking with the PS4 even with the reversal?
11232018	11232218	Yes.
11233960	11234520	Good man.
11234640	11235061	Same here.
11235802	11236122	No, no, no.
11236442	11237423	I agree with Rob.
11237603	11240827	I thought I was going to come in here and I'm like, oh, Rob's going to switch.
11242222	11243023	Oh, Rob's gonna switch.
11243203	11244064	No, why would I switch?
11244124	11246146	All the games I want are on PlayStation 4 as well.
11246166	11250770	There's a handful of Xbox-only games, but I can address that in 2014 when they'll actually be out.
11251330	11252371	Because I know me and you.
11252432	11253633	We're excited for Killer Instinct.
11255078	11280120	um killer instinct the way it is especially because rare is not developing it really just isn't enough for me it's not a hundred dollars good i agree totally agree and i'm not hating on microsoft i mean as i've been telling people that are like oh you're sony fanboy and so forth i'm like hey uh attention everybody uh i bought xbox 360 at launch and i bought playstation 3 a year after it launched so i'm just doing the reverse this time what's wrong with that
11280908	11281269	Nothing.
11281369	11283313	And for me, it came down to the price.
11283434	11285618	And I said, okay, this works out for me.
11285859	11286981	I just had enough money.
11287001	11288504	When they said $400, I went like, sold.
11288564	11289226	Where's GameStop?
11289719	11291700	It's the price, and I'm going to be honest.
11291840	11295682	I think Xbox One is going to be under pressure to drop that price.
11296082	11300364	Maybe not holiday, but in 2014, around the time I'm looking to get one.
11302085	11303986	And that's probably when I'll finally pick one up.
11305486	11312029	Despite what folks may be saying otherwise about Kinect and so forth, I just kind of think the $499 price won't last forever, just like the $599 on PlayStation 3 didn't.
11313690	11313911	Nope.
11314391	11315573	It dropped like a rock.
11315933	11316654	Thank you for your time.
11316834	11318136	You are welcome, Raven's Dolphin.
11318196	11319257	Always a delight to hear from you.
11319317	11319798	You take care.
11320338	11320579	I will.
11320639	11320899	Bye.
11320999	11321299	Bye-bye.
11322040	11323082	Let's get to some more calls.
11323322	11324443	Our phone lines are lighting up.
11324503	11325504	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
11325545	11325925	Who's this?
11327247	11328028	Hey, it's Drew.
11328088	11328828	How you guys doing?
11329089	11330210	Oh my gosh, Drew.
11330330	11330971	Intern Drew.
11332088	11350701	And happy first birthday to you, sir Happy birthday to you, three hours left Your show, or I'm sorry, your show Well, I don't know about your show, but our show It's the Drew Show Our show and your life share the same birthday It's the Drew Show, sorry, Drew So you're 30 now, right?
11361004	11368169	I remember when you were 18 and that blows my fucking mind.
11368209	11369650	But anyway, this isn't about me.
11369710	11372072	I remember when you were legal to drink and that was hilarious.
11372652	11375894	What did you call in about tonight?
11375994	11382479	I was just going to chime in on the whole... It's a hot topic these days, you know.
11383569	11388854	Xbox One vs. PS4 thing with Microsoft doing the whole back battle?
11389134	11395159	It's gonna be the hot topic for about four more months until these consoles are out, so by all means, five more months.
11395859	11396600	Oh, jeez.
11396880	11398481	You know, I'm still not convinced.
11398781	11399122	Honest.
11400202	11402144	They thought they could float it past us in a day.
11402985	11408009	They thought, you know, this is gonna be the next big thing, this is gonna change the future of gaming after all Steam is doing it.
11408649	11409330	The difference is...
11410319	11411700	Steam started from nothing.
11411760	11413901	Steam had something going there.
11415042	11417223	That kind of changed the way we looked at PC gaming.
11417664	11420625	I don't think that console gaming is ready for this at all.
11422186	11423607	They might not ever be.
11423807	11428790	Am I understanding you correctly that you're saying you reject both these consoles right now?
11431792	11435074	If I was going to go for it, I'd go for PS4.
11435314	11439297	But for practical reasons, I've got a whole bunch of PS3 games in backlog right now.
11440414	11443819	I only jumped on PS3 in October.
11444929	11446630	So I've got a whole bunch of catch up to do.
11446650	11449132	But if I had to choose between the two, it'd probably be PS4.
11449212	11450433	I'm not getting either one this year.
11474668	11480611	I'm going to just stick with the consoles I have because I got Grand Theft Auto 5 and Saints Row 4.
11480691	11484413	Was it just this week they even announced that Thief is going to be on PS3 and Xbox 360?
11484453	11487375	Yeah, a lot of stuff is still coming out on the current consoles.
11487435	11489656	So where's my real incentive to upgrade?
11489696	11490777	Maybe I'm just not ready until 2014.
11491397	11494819	I'm not a first day adapter for a lot of consoles.
11494919	11498401	I got burned the first time around when I got the DSSat the first time.
11499218	11502219	that has, yeah, that has a hell of a startup game library, doesn't it?
11502599	11528563	yeah, I think there's a lot of people in your camp, there is yeah, you know, I subscribe to, you know, Jamie's mantra, game is only good as the games, uh, system's only good as the games are honest and, for the most part, I'm not impressed with Xbox One yet and I'm not impressed by the PS4, like, okay, fine, Kingdom Hearts 3, after you've got umpteen sequels, you can finally count to three okay, fine, show me more
11529925	11532887	and maybe I'll get it when it comes out, what, two, three years later?
11533067	11542531	So for you, you want the games to be out there?
11542631	11551995	You want the games to be in your hand and then you can have a discussion about the consoles?
11552115	11553076	That's a good question.
11555337	11558398	Alright, well, Drew, I gotta wrap up and let you go, but any other final thoughts for us?
11560050	11561471	That's been a wild ride so far.
11561491	11562411	Hope it keeps on going.
11562691	11564832	Alright, you should come visit the show sometime.
11564872	11568334	I have a nice solid table that the soundboard sits on so you can't knock it over.
11568854	11570915	We intern-proofed the studio.
11571015	11572155	Alright.
11572476	11574517	I'll catch you in the ice.
11574957	11575837	Alright, take care, Drew.
11575877	11576477	I gotta let you go.
11577738	11578118	Peace.
11578518	11578898	Bye.
11580639	11583160	The phone calls are always a little spotty, too.
11586698	11593140	ShadowNextGen in chat says, Rob, could it be argued that your incentive to upgrade to NextGen disappeared with Microsoft's reversal?
11593220	11594020	Just a question.
11595141	11606124	I'm not exactly sure what you mean by that because, I mean, especially when it comes to Microsoft, Microsoft does have some exclusive games that I want to check out at some point.
11606444	11607905	They're not going to be out at launch.
11608325	11614627	To be fair, PlayStation 3 is not going to have all their exclusives out at launch either, but I still feel like there'll be enough third-party stuff available
11614867	11616148	I am less excited about that game now.
11637127	11640308	Okay, let me get back to some more calls because our phone is being off the hook.
11640328	11643710	There's lots of people trying to get through, so I'm hoping we can get as many calls as we can tonight.
11644031	11645291	Hi, on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
11645992	11647272	Well, it's the one and only Ranma.
11647432	11650434	You know, we can't have a birthday celebration without the normal tradition.
11650914	11651995	Oh, you missed it, Ranma.
11652015	11652816	I like your hat.
11652876	11653936	You missed it in Part A, Ranma.
11653956	11655577	I'm glad I didn't see your hat.
11655937	11656978	My fellow New Yorker.
11657398	11658319	That is awesome.
11658779	11660360	You have totally inspired me to make a hat.
11661875	11663596	It's a sailor, what sailor is that?
11664176	11665856	It's an Artemis hat.
11666076	11666997	Oh, Artemis hat.
11667537	11668677	Yes, it is.
11670397	11673498	You know, you guys had me cracking up this whole episode.
11673898	11677039	Before I get into what I called in for, let me just say this.
11677479	11679940	I wish we had an Arby's and a Hardee's here in New York.
11680560	11687262	And I would have loved to have seen Microsoft roll out the whole way it's going to do with the games because it's really been funny.
11687882	11697066	If, let's say, Kingdom Hearts 3 comes out for both systems, you go into the store, PlayStation 4 version, $59.99, Xbox One version, $39.99.
11697527	11698767	Talk about a slap in the face.
11699607	11702229	Now, that would have been a one-up in the war.
11702289	11705210	I would have loved to see if game prices start changing.
11705790	11707211	And that would have been the huge plus.
11707291	11709052	And I think I said that in an earlier episode.
11709412	11715675	If DRM policies, heck yeah, sure, bring them on if it's going to slice all my new game prices in half.
11716095	11740792	But we all know that's not going to happen For the record, Ranma, I believe both companies have come out and said $59.99 is the ceiling for their game prices Outside of collector's editions and all that So we're going to be looking at game prices similar to what we have this generation Except now Nintendo's in that club too Because Wii U games are also $59.99 Although some buck the trend Game and Wario today, only $39.99 So anyway, Ranma
11745103	11748446	Okay, so here on my table are three different alcohols.
11748486	11753731	We have the 12-year-old Glenn Fittich, because the 15-year-old got killed at PAX East.
11754671	11757113	This nice 10-cane rum.
11757133	11766061	And the alcohol that put Joe Videa and almost everybody in my room on their ass, Spiritus, which is 192 proof.
11766141	11766462	Oh, my God.
11769384	11773265	So, you guys get to pick which one I will do the traditional shot for.
11773445	11774406	Spiritus.
11774486	11775586	Spiritus.
11775846	11776846	Spiritus.
11777767	11780648	Actually, I was going to say the Glenfiddich because I'm partial to Scotch.
11781728	11783089	You guys are assholes, okay?
11783569	11785029	Hey, I said Glenfiddich.
11785089	11785689	It's Scotch.
11786970	11787910	I gave him the choice.
11787970	11788690	Mix half and half.
11788750	11789110	Both.
11789411	11789931	No, you don't.
11790431	11793412	You do not dilute Glenfiddich with anything.
11795809	11797050	Let the man take his shot.
11797090	11797470	Here he goes.
11797510	11800132	He's pouring it into the glass.
11800752	11801913	192 proof, ladies and gentlemen.
11803034	11807717	Twilight Sparkle shot glass.
11808498	11809458	Love it.
11810559	11811340	Here's to you.
11811740	11812420	Here's to me.
11812761	11814442	The best of friends will ever be.
11814742	11818925	If you're ever happy to disagree, well, fuck you guys and here's to me.
11818945	11820546	Amazing.
11821707	11822127	Amazing.
11824020	11825580	Oh, oh.
11826561	11829762	He just had a Rob moment right there.
11829802	11830762	It's not just me.
11830782	11834343	No, no, that's not as bad as Rob going, running across.
11834643	11836423	Rob ran in circles doing flappy hands.
11836804	11837404	I really did.
11837944	11839424	Rob, do you wonder how strong this is?
11839704	11842285	Go find a bottle of rubbing alcohol and get a quick whiff.
11843145	11843365	No.
11844706	11848167	Keep in mind, you remember what I was raised with, right?
11848947	11849387	Everclear.
11850835	11853637	I have an ever clear story to tell you later.
11853677	11854218	Wait, wait, Ranma.
11854238	11854578	Tell me later.
11854618	11861723	Because you're here now, I want to make sure we get this out because I forgot to do it in part A because of all the other stuff going on tonight with technical failures and 11 years.
11862144	11870109	But in seven days here at the Voice of Geeks Network, we are gearing up for something really exciting that you guys are going to be bringing to us over at Anime Jam Session.
11870129	11873072	Do you want to kind of kick off the promotion for that this week, Ranma?
11873092	11873532	Yeah.
11873769	11874569	Why certainly!
11874829	11877130	Well, next Sunday is Senshi Matsuri.
11877370	11888832	It's a Sailor Moon themed anime convention to celebrate the birthday of Usagi Tsukino, which is June 30th, and for the excitement of the new anime and the new merchandise that's coming out.
11889152	11897574	What we're going to do is advertise some of the events that will be going on, such as opening and closing ceremonies, and the performance by Senshi Generation as well.
11898974	11901815	Awesome, and that is all going to be streaming here at the Voice Eats Network.
11902435	11902875	That's right.
11927563	11929724	Rob's gotten a lot better, but there's still a few things.
11929784	11933867	Never taken a class, but maybe I will for you guys for the 12 year.
11934167	11937189	All right, Ranma, I got to let you go so we can wrap up, but take care, buddy.
11937329	11937949	Stay fabulous.
11938129	11938910	All right, stay black.
11939170	11939470	Bye.
11939490	11939690	I will.
11939710	11942031	All right.
11942512	11943552	Always love hearing from Ranma.
11943952	11945013	I am so sorry, you guys.
11945033	11946774	There's like five other people trying to get through.
11946914	11951257	I've got to shut off the phones because it's almost 10 o'clock and some of us have to get home.
11951937	11953238	I am home, thank God.
11953898	11958380	But anyway, very much looking forward to that next Sunday.
11959420	11960061	We've got to wrap up.
11960441	11962361	I want to do some Twitter topics quickly.
11962462	11966143	I don't know if you have last-minute stories, Loki, while I bring these up.
11966223	11972506	Just that it's rumored that Sony's going to announce more games for next year at Gamescom.
11974932	11975813	Some tweets tonight.
11976274	11978537	TigerClaw305 sends us a few tweets.
11978937	11981861	Miyamoto on women as characters in Nintendo games.
11982301	11988429	I did see this, because he talked about not just women, but gay characters and so forth in the games.
11989010	11992234	And it did strike me as kind of like a...
11993666	11997229	Progressive, maybe modernizing theme thing.
11998210	12005856	And it talked about how Peach wasn't really considered until... Peach was a late add into this Mario game that's coming out.
12006216	12007057	But it's a great thing.
12007497	12009799	I'm trying to find a quote here to give here.
12010199	12010279	Oh.
12011360	12015762	I guess for me in particular, the structure of the gameplay always comes before story.
12016082	12021664	And so we're always looking at when we're putting that together, what is the most natural story to take place within that structure?
12022064	12033569	So if we end up creating a gameplay structure where it makes sense for whether it's a female to go rescue a male or a gay man to rescue a lesbian woman or a lesbian woman to rescue a gay man, we might take that approach.
12035070	12037711	So he just wants it to feel natural in the games.
12037811	12040852	I want my lesbian from Animal Crossing to be a hero.
12042918	12044539	Animal Crossing Lispy in the game
12072937	12078240	Nobody wants a game where it's like, you know, the roles are reversed just for the sake of the roles being reversed.
12078380	12078600	Yes.
12078941	12080161	I think that was like, what, Super Princess?
12080241	12083383	Although, the ROM hack that guy did for Donkey Kong was pretty cool.
12083403	12086225	I mean, there's exceptions, but that wasn't like an endorsed thing.
12086285	12087986	Otherwise, you'd get like Super Princess Peach.
12091324	12093045	Anyway, I thought that was a good story.
12093065	12094345	I wish we had more time to get into that.
12095105	12100827	TigerClaw also tweeted us, the Heavy Gear Assault Kickstarter was cancelled, but they're going to be doing crowdfunding on their own.
12101367	12104088	Hmm.
12104148	12108949	Spazinator says there's a free table on the Steam version of Pinball FX2 as of a few days ago.
12109049	12110450	Those of you who like free stuff, go get it.
12110470	12111430	I love free stuff.
12112210	12141905	Eric RPG tweeted us Mega Man Unlimited is done and it beams down in July and this is a fan made production of Mega Man very cool lots of well wishes all over Twitter for the 11 year birthday and I just want to say a general thank you thank you for all the well wishes we really couldn't do it without you guys you guys are great you know what I want a game where a woman rescues a man without becoming a romantic interest
12143462	12143923	Just saying.
12144383	12151313	How many movies do you have out there with a female protagonist that ends up with some sort of romantic tanglement with the dude in the movie?
12151393	12151874	Yeah, yeah.
12152114	12154177	I want Hardcore Chick, the game.
12154538	12154658	Mm-hmm.
12155916	12157397	who don't need no man to complete her life.
12157417	12159438	Ain't got time for that.
12160018	12161078	Ain't nobody got time for that.
12161999	12167741	Well, we got about enough time left to wrap up this show and get on out of here because it's almost 1 a.m.
12167781	12169082	for you crazy East Coasters.
12169622	12170623	JV Mon, are you still on East Coast time?
12170643	12171303	You said coasters.
12171743	12172704	Are you still on East Coast time?
12172724	12173464	Can we put drinks on them?
12173504	12174484	I'm on tequila time right now.
12176125	12178486	One tequila, two tequila, three tequila, four.
12178566	12180026	All right.
12180246	12180826	Let's wrap up.
12181486	12182767	JV Mon, thank you for being here tonight.
12182787	12183587	I hope you had a good time.
12183727	12184567	I had a great time.
12184667	12187328	And you drank a little bit, so we'll make sure.
12187348	12188628	I only had like six shots.
12188728	12189449	Oh, my God.
12189629	12190229	Only six.
12190749	12191029	Yeah.
12191049	12193790	Well, then again, I only had two, and it lasted for, what, five minutes?
12194630	12196210	It lasted for a five-minute giggle fit.
12196250	12197851	And after five minutes, I was like, let's go.
12198711	12199871	But thank you for being here.
12199971	12200491	No problem.
12200511	12202032	And we hope to see you for the 12th next year.
12203988	12204268	Sure.
12204609	12206611	All right.
12207111	12210355	Loki, I know we kept you a little late, but thanks as always.
12210395	12211115	Do you have a final thought?
12213458	12215360	Captain Rainbow for Smash Brothers?
12216681	12216881	What?
12216901	12217982	Tingle for Smash Brothers.
12218223	12218703	Yes.
12219124	12220625	Yes, Tingle for Smash Brothers.
12221326	12223568	I didn't give you your actual final thought, JVMong, please.
12225670	12226251	I'm drunk.
12230144	12234406	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?
12235867	12240089	I just got reminded that I really want to play Remember Me.
12241510	12244051	Oh my god, so did I. I didn't even realize that game came out.
12244451	12246292	I fucking want that game on Steam so much.
12247032	12247453	Check it out.
12247493	12248213	I'm gonna get it on PS3.
12249634	12252738	My final thought is I'm just going to end as well with a thank you.
12252798	12255501	Thank you all to your support over the last 11 years.
12256282	12261709	Thank you to the genius here in studio that apparently fixed the broadcasting problem.
12261729	12263091	So hopefully that won't be a problem in the future.
12263131	12266475	We'll do that every week because we held the connection for two hours ever since we reconnected.
12267436	12280349	that'll answer that but I really do want to thank all the listeners for their support over the years and as I say every week Orange Lounge Radio is a free program and if you enjoy what you hear just tell a friend or two or seven about the program and help grow our family
12280751	12283174	And when you're done with us, tune in to Mario Marathon.
12283454	12283894	Last game.
12285396	12286697	We've been watching them all weekend.
12286797	12289060	Yeah, Mario Marathon's raising money for a good cause.
12289220	12292003	These guys really aren't very good at Mario games.
12292343	12301893	I do want to say in general, though, when you're done with Orange Lounge Radio as a podcast and you're ready to go listen to something else this week, please consider supporting other independent broadcasters.
12301913	12303915	There's a lot of people out there who've worked...
12304375	12309922	Maybe not for 11 years, but even one year is something to celebrate who work hard at what they do for free.
12309962	12312504	So please continue to support the indie voice.
12312705	12313646	It would mean a lot to us.
12314687	12317730	Meanwhile, we'll be back to do this all again next week.
12318231	12318551	Good night.
12319192	12319292	Bye!
12349592	12350593	See you next week!
