0	3000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	13000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	21000	Tonight, June 23, 2013, a firmware update on PlayStation 3 bricks some consoles. Saints Row IV will embrace modding.
21000	24000	And could a Final Fantasy XII remake be in the works?
24000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	37000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	45000	It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 509 for this June the 23rd of 2013.
45000	53000	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as she has for the past 11 years to the day, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
54000	59000	And that's how you feel about the past 11 years, all summed up, right?
59000	64000	No, I'm very happy about making 11 years. I just am on the tail end.
64000	66000	It just wouldn't be an episode of OLR if you weren't-
66000	68000	If I hadn't been sick all week.
68000	69000	If you hadn't been sick all week, alright.
69000	74000	I have no idea what's up, but whatever this flu thing is can bite my ass. Actually, it bit my ass.
74000	78000	That's the problem, is it bit your ass a little too hard?
78000	80000	Well, it can stop.
80000	87000	Alright, also say hello, also joining us every week for the past 11 years, probably a better attendance record than both myself and DarkSakura.
87000	89000	Say hello to Loki.
89000	90000	Hi.
90000	91000	How are you doing, Techmaster Loki?
91000	92000	I'm doing alright.
92000	95000	I heard you took up a new programming language in the past couple of weeks.
95000	97000	I've just been learning C++.
97000	98000	Yeah?
98000	99000	And-
99000	100000	You're programming in French.
100000	102000	And, you know, it feels like it sometimes, I swear.
102000	111000	It's like, like I had the- there was- I've been picking up pretty fast. I think I started like on Tuesday, maybe? Or I think it was this week.
111000	113000	Yeah, it was like on Tuesday.
113000	118000	And I've already gone through most of this first book.
118000	122000	I'm now in the object-oriented stuff.
122000	126000	And then they're gonna start, I think- I'm trying to think what's left.
126000	130000	There's polymorphism, which I have no fucking clue what that means.
130000	135000	And Windows programming, because right now it's all console window stuff.
135000	138000	You know, DOS, if you will.
138000	140000	And then very simple things.
140000	143000	Although I've made a lot of gambling games, because that's a lot of the-
143000	145000	I was gonna say, what's the goal with this?
145000	147000	Are you trying to make an OLR dream game into reality in a few years?
147000	149000	I'm just trying to learn how to program games.
149000	154000	Yeah, well, mainly I want to work in Unity, and you know, it's good to know programming stuff.
154000	159000	I think it's healthy, because when you sit here and you bitch about games every week for the past 11 years,
159000	164000	it's good for you to feel the pain a little bit about what it goes in to make some games.
164000	167000	Well, yeah, I just wanted to have like some sort of a language.
167000	174000	Just to get the basics so that I can learn other languages if I want to learn like Java or something like that.
174000	178000	You can take a lot what you learn and apply it to others.
178000	182000	I find source code for games fascinating.
182000	188000	Just randomly today I was on the internet, and I was looking up old Atari 2600 games,
188000	192000	and there was one in particular that I remember from back in the day.
192000	194000	Of course, now I'm gonna forget the name. I think it was called Dragonfire.
194000	199000	It was a game that had like two screens, and in one you were running across the castle bridge,
199000	202000	and you were trying to dodge fireballs, and you would get into the room with the dragon.
202000	205000	You had to pick up all the chalices and everything in the room and get to the door.
205000	208000	Hopefully somebody out there knows what I'm talking about, so I don't sound like I'm smoking crack.
208000	214000	This is an Atari 2600 game. My point is, the source code is out there for you to download and look at,
214000	218000	and it's all commented, so you can see exactly what it went into making those games.
218000	223000	It's like, man, programming for the Atari 2600 was a bitch because...
223000	224000	It's all assembly, yeah.
224000	227000	Well, yeah, and you had like no space. Those cartridges.
227000	233000	The beginning Atari 2600 cartridges were 4K. 4K? It's 4,000 characters.
233000	235000	Yeah, that's not a lot.
235000	240000	Yeah, yeah, that's part of the reason that Pac-Man sucks so bad,
240000	246000	but we'll leave that for another time because there's too much in gaming this week to talk about Atari 2600.
246000	249000	But I do want to introduce, here in our studio, welcome back.
249000	254000	It's been exactly one year since he was last at the show.
254000	257000	Say hello, everybody, to JV Mon is here tonight.
257000	258000	Hello.
258000	259000	Hey, how you doing?
259000	261000	Doing all right, just staring at these peanut butter brownies.
261000	263000	Yeah, we're having a hard time hearing.
263000	264000	You should have another.
264000	265000	Can you hear me now?
265000	266000	Yes, a little bit.
266000	269000	You're still kind of quiet, but I think that's just the mic over there is a little weird.
269000	271000	It's the peanut butter brownies stealing my voice.
273000	277000	Yes, here in studio tonight we have peanut butter brownies, which were baked from Becky, right?
277000	282000	Yes, Becky says happy 11th, and she is going to a movie with her mother tonight.
282000	285000	Tell Becky that I love her and I hate her all at the same time.
285000	286000	I will. She's such a bitch.
286000	289000	I love her for these brownies. I hate her for these brownies.
289000	290000	Mostly love.
291000	298000	I told her that it's basically her contribution for not being here is that she's going to basically make everybody fatties.
300000	302000	She made two pans, by the way, so she's got some herself.
302000	311000	It's also worth noting that JV Mon brought to the show a nice bottle of Silver Patron for us to consume.
311000	316000	So now I can combine worlds a little bit because you were telling me before the show you have yet to have a fireball shot.
316000	317000	I've never had fireball whiskey.
317000	325000	So we're going to take, I'm going to get Pod Culture's bottle that he sent us from the repository and then we're going to have some drinks.
325000	326000	We're going to get drunk.
326000	327000	Yeah.
327000	328000	Girl, we going to drink?
328000	329000	We're going to drink.
329000	336000	Quickly, we got to get into gaming news because there's huge news this week and I want to turn it over to Jamie so we can get into that.
336000	341000	Because the last few episodes, last few episodes of OLR, we don't have time to fuck around.
341000	342000	There's too much-
342000	343000	We ain't got time for this shit.
343000	349000	Gaming news or gaming weeks and what have we been playing? Nobody cares because we had a console war and it's getting good.
349000	350000	It's getting real good.
350000	352000	It's getting classic.
352000	361000	But quickly, JV Mon, since you're here, obviously I want you to comment throughout tonight's show, but you are an indie broadcaster as well, right? Off and on?
361000	365000	Off and on when, you know, I actually get around to uploading my podcasts.
365000	368000	Yeah. And what podcast is it that you do?
368000	377000	I do a mostly Eurobeat based podcast called Super Euro Power Hour, which I don't think, once in the history of the show, I've actually had a show under an hour.
377000	382000	It's more like Super Euro three and a half power hour.
382000	387000	You are still really quiet and I can't figure out why and it's bothering me. So I apologize to the listeners that are like, he's too quiet.
387000	388000	Live radio.
388000	390000	Live radio. I got to adjust things on the fly.
390000	393000	It's the acoustic absorption properties of the brownies.
393000	397000	It wouldn't be 11 years of Orange Launch Radio if there weren't technical problems on the fly.
397000	400000	And people usually say I'm too loud. And it's funny, it's like, they can't hear me.
400000	402000	Actually, now you're good. I think we fixed it.
402000	403000	All right.
403000	407000	All right. I had to turn up the gain so they can probably hear me on your mic back here.
407000	408000	No.
408000	410000	But it works. All right.
410000	419000	OK. Live listeners at live.vogradio.com. Let us know if you're OK with the sound or if we need to change things on the fly.
419000	422000	I'm sorry, did you give out the URL while I was adjusting your sound?
422000	424000	I did not.
424000	425000	Please do.
425000	428000	Just search on iTunes, Super Europe Power Hour.
428000	433000	I mean, I've been sitting on the last latest episode on my hard drive for like the past month.
433000	435000	It was recorded like almost two months ago.
435000	438000	Like, I'm an extreme procrastinator.
438000	440000	So new episode coming soon.
440000	441000	Eventually.
441000	444000	Soon is the word we use in the gaming industry. Soon.
444000	446000	Soon. New episode coming soon.
446000	450000	I mean, it's not like gaming where you got to be first to get the news out there.
450000	452000	It's just like, it'll be out there when it's out there.
453000	458000	Since you haven't been here in a year, you were here for the 10th anniversary, which was a crazy night all in itself.
458000	460000	So now you're 11 years.
460000	461000	That's just another week.
461000	464000	No one car about 11 years is just another week.
464000	465000	Quickly remind us.
465000	467000	What's what's you as a gamer?
467000	468000	What kind of video games do you play?
468000	470000	What do you like? What systems do you own?
470000	472000	I own most of them.
472000	477000	I if it comes out, I'll probably buy it.
477000	479000	I don't have a Vita anymore because I dropped it in a puddle.
479000	481000	And that's probably the saddest day in my life.
481000	484000	That's that's wow, son. Wow.
484000	487000	Yeah, like not even a year and it falls in a puddle.
487000	489000	And that's probably like the slowest 10 seconds in my life.
489000	493000	Just watching it go in a puddle, submerge, watching it power off.
493000	497000	Did it did it have that whole like what you say?
497000	499000	Did you have a dear sister moment with that?
499000	502000	Pretty much like I was like, no.
502000	508000	But yeah, and I'm considering either trying to fix it or buying a new Vita because.
508000	512000	I'm a consumer horror and I want my game systems.
512000	515000	Favorite video game of all time?
515000	519000	Ooh, Super Mario RPG.
519000	520000	And why is that?
520000	523000	I just love the story and the gameplay.
523000	529000	And that final boss battle as a kid, I remember I just remember renting it from Blockbuster, the cartridge,
529000	531000	because my mom was like, you ain't getting a new game.
531000	532000	So I was like, fine, Blockbuster.
532000	539000	So we would rent it like every week and I would play it during the weekends instead of doing my homework,
539000	541000	which, you know, wasn't a very responsible thing to do.
541000	544000	But hey, I was a kid.
544000	546000	Quickly, I think the listeners would enjoy this.
546000	552000	If you're willing to tell it, you ran out on you're visiting here from New York City, you're visiting family in San Francisco.
552000	557000	OLR Studios is only a two hour drive from San Francisco, which by that we appreciate you taking a drive here.
557000	561000	But while you're driving here, it took you about four hours to get here.
561000	562000	Why?
562000	570000	Because even though my Wii U is on the west east coast, I had this compulsion to buy Game & Wario.
570000	573000	Which isn't even getting good reviews.
573000	577000	So that tells me you're a little bit of a Nintendo fanboy. That's okay.
577000	583000	I do enjoy my Nintendo games, but I think it's just more, I need something new to play on my Wii U.
583000	586000	And it's like, oh my God, a new game out on the Wii U.
586000	587000	Stars Alive.
587000	588000	That's fair.
589000	591000	Alright, one more time, the Vita story.
591000	594000	What happened when it, you just dropped it?
594000	595000	Or what happened?
595000	599000	I was getting out of my car, I closed my car door, I left that part out.
599000	604000	My Vita just flew out of my pocket into a puddle.
606000	609000	It's like it's happening all over again.
610000	618000	And as it falls through the water, it just powers down slowly. Longest ten seconds of my life.
618000	625000	It's like the end of Terminator 2, it just sticks to its thumb out and slowly sinking down to the molten metal.
625000	627000	There is no fate but what we make.
627000	629000	Alright, love it, love it.
629000	635000	Tigerclaw in chat is asking, is that superhero power hour? No, that's super Euro power hour.
635000	637000	Euro, like Eurobeat.
638000	640000	Like Pala Pala.
640000	641000	Alright.
641000	643000	Okay, we gotta get into the news.
643000	648000	JVMom, please, as the show is going on tonight, feel free to comment on your thoughts on what's going on.
648000	651000	And I'm sure everybody's got something to say about this hot topic.
651000	653000	Dark Sakura, take it away tonight.
653000	658000	In the most professional language I can say, Microsoft done flipped a bitch.
658000	665000	Yeah, basically they put out a big announcement that said, okay, we're not doing all that other stuff, we're doing this instead.
666000	671000	So basically they're not requiring the internet connection to play offline Xbox One games.
671000	678000	Xboner, Xbox 180, the joke that everybody has been saying.
678000	685000	Basically you can trade in your games, resell, gift, rent discs, blah blah, sit on it, take a crap on it, they don't care.
685000	688000	You can do all of it, it's gonna be physical discs.
688000	693000	So it was sort of like, oh, all that? Oh, we weren't serious, never mind, click.
693000	695000	So yeah, complete reversal.
695000	709000	I have to admit, I was wrong, well I wasn't wrong, but I was mostly incorrect last week because I said there is no way Microsoft would reverse course that fast.
709000	716000	I said it will take a miracle for Microsoft to win the holiday season at this point, and within three days they parted the Red Sea.
716000	720000	Well they rode in on a white horse, like in History of the World.
720000	727000	You know within seconds of those planes getting back to Seattle, Don Mattrick is like, boardroom, now.
729000	731000	Right now, get in that boardroom.
731000	737000	As Don Mattrick said, your feedback matters, investors that have stock in our company.
737000	746000	Oh, consumers, oh fuck them, but yeah, you guys want us to make it so that more people buy our console, so yeah, I guess we better flip this.
747000	757000	Still one thing that's really confusing about the whole thing is that it does require a day one patch to enable this offline mode.
757000	764000	Which begs the question, these consoles aren't even fucking being manufactured yet, why the hell do I need a day one patch?
764000	767000	No system comes out without a day one patch.
767000	774000	Because I'm gonna give Microsoft a bit of a doubt here, I think they were so committed to their vision that they had already coded the firmware.
774000	780000	Because you know, firmware don't write itself, you know coding now, firmware don't write itself.
780000	784000	Somebody's gonna have to write this new firmware and it's just not gonna be done by the time these consoles press.
784000	786000	I'm giving them a bit of a doubt there.
786000	788000	Alright, I'll play that.
788000	795000	Then it needs to be on the disk, like it is with games where they have the firmware update on the disk.
795000	801000	That way, just saving you guys some trouble there Microsoft, that way you don't have a situation where,
801000	807000	Oh shit, I don't have internet, I can't fucking play anything because I can't do my day one patch.
807000	817000	Although, granted, they're probably, data is free, disk costs money even if it's a penny a disk, they have to manufacture how many disks?
817000	822000	No, I'm not talking about manufacturing disks, I'm talking about putting it on their game disks.
822000	825000	Like they're doing with the current gen stuff.
825000	827000	Or you used to be able to download.
828000	833000	Yeah, I understand you can download and burn your own stuff, but once again that requires that you have internet.
833000	838000	So I'm just saying that you put it on the game disk since those disks have not been pressed yet.
838000	841000	And there you go, problem solved.
841000	850000	Since obviously you're gonna have to connect the internet to, or you're gonna have to want to play a game before you can figure out that you can't play a game without that update.
850000	853000	So putting the disk in the drive should solve the problem.
853000	860000	If they were smart, although they flip flopped on levels of intelligence, so it's hard to say.
860000	865000	I don't know, when you talk like that it still sounds like the whole let's kick Microsoft while they're down mentality.
865000	867000	Alright fine, connect is still connected.
867000	871000	Okay, now we can have a real conversation. Yes, connect is still connected.
871000	873000	And it's $100 more.
873000	875000	We'll get into that later in the show.
876000	882000	As far as the $180 on the DRM is concerned, is this a victory or is this a defeat?
882000	889000	Because I saw a lot of very interesting chatter on Twitter and Facebook as soon as this was announced.
889000	891000	There was a lot of people that were like, yay.
891000	892000	And I was probably one of those people.
892000	901000	I was like, my biggest problem, my number one problem with the Xbox One was that if I buy a game, I don't have the right to sell it back on my own terms.
901000	904000	I have to follow Microsoft's predesignated terms.
904000	910000	I didn't really care about the 24 hour thing. The DRM thing didn't bug me nearly as much as that component did.
910000	916000	So the fact that that's not a factor now makes me feel like, okay, I can support Xbox One, I'm good with that.
916000	927000	But there was a lot of people on Twitter and Facebook very hurt about, well, because we're now taking this out, we're going to have to take the quote unquote cool features out with it.
927000	930000	And the one thing I kept hearing over and over again was family sharing, family sharing.
931000	946000	Which to me, I'm like, what does that mean? Because some people honestly have it in their heads, I think, based on the tweets I saw that family sharing was going to allow you to buy a game and share it with 10 people unconditionally.
946000	953000	And if that is really the way you were thinking, then can I have some of the glue that you're huffing to glue your screws back in?
953000	959000	Because, I'm sorry, that is not a win situation for the publisher or for Microsoft or anybody.
959000	969000	Remember, they're in the business to make money. They're going to, if they're getting rid of used games because they're saying, oh, you know what, used games are really hurting the new game sales.
969000	981000	They're not going to put this thing, okay, we're going to get rid of used games, but we're going to have this method where you can buy one game and you can have two people play at the same time.
981000	984000	Nope, that is not going to happen without some sort of restrictions.
984000	991000	Raven's Dolphin in chat says, I don't think family sharing was not going to be that great. I heard it was going to be like a one hour demo.
991000	993000	Yeah, I saw that story floating around the internet too.
993000	994000	Anonymous pace spin.
994000	1001000	We don't know. We don't know what it was supposed to be. So why are people getting so upset about something we didn't know about that we lost?
1001000	1009000	It's sort of like people talking up the fantasy of what they want it to be and, you know, how rumors spread. It's like a giant game of telephone.
1009000	1019000	And they get so excited about what they think that this final thing is going to be without having anything to back it up. So it's like getting excited about Tooth Fairy bringing you a quarter.
1019000	1029000	I guess people just feel that there's such a loss of potential innovation, even though they don't know what exactly it was. It's like, what was it? I don't know, but it could have been something great.
1029000	1031000	It could have been something really terrible.
1031000	1040000	I'm I can see the whole we want to look forward and not backward. I can kind of follow that to an extent.
1040000	1048000	But Varian is the real problem with this whole thing, because Microsoft was so good at communicating the negative and so crappy at communicating the positive.
1048000	1050000	That's why they lost this battle.
1050000	1055000	Well, then on top of that, they the whole issue with Kinect having this still be connected to the console.
1055000	1064000	And I understand why they're doing it so that, you know, it can be assumed that any developer out there is making a game can develop a game that uses a Kinect because the Kinect is going to be there.
1064000	1079000	Blah, blah, blah. My thing is, though, while they just have it where they assume that it's going to be there and then you don't have to have it connected and you don't have to use it, because obviously a lot of those games that they actually all of those games that they showed during their press conference didn't use Kinect.
1079000	1087000	Or it was an optional thing. So if this is so integral into their console, why am I not seeing how it's being used?
1087000	1092000	That's revolutionary, you know, aside from grenade, grenade, reload, grenade, grenade.
1092000	1097000	To be fair, because most of that revolutionary stuff has nothing to do with the games.
1097000	1108000	If you want to see where they were showing that off, go back to their earlier press conference at the end of May when they showed the calling people during the TV shows and the fact that everybody has one of those brings people connected.
1108000	1114000	I'm not saying that's a smart decision, but I'm saying that is the decision. And for me it's not a deal breaker.
1114000	1124000	But, anyway, I want to read some of these other comments in chat. We got Koopa Kid Jeremy says, some of those cool features could still be implemented.
1124000	1128000	Like, why not give the option to gold subscribers? That's kind of where my head's at.
1128000	1139000	My mindset is, okay, so you lost the battle with the disc-based games. Fine. Disc-based games, the way you know it and love it today, right? Why not have that be the market?
1139000	1146000	Digitally-based games? Why can't you just have two license types depending on how you bought the game?
1146000	1156000	I mean, I don't see a lot of advantage to buying games digitally today outside of, all right, well, I get, what, 5, 10% back on the Wii U, right, when I have the deluxe program?
1156000	1159000	You get 10% off on PlayStation Network.
1159000	1172000	Yeah, you get some of those deals. Okay, so financial incentive, that's good. But what if some of the pluses were, okay, when you buy a game digitally, you can instantly send it to JV Mon in New York City without having to mail the disc to him.
1172000	1179000	I could just instantly give him the license. That is kind of cool. Why can't I still have that for a digital game?
1179000	1189000	I'm not really hearing the, why that has to be taken away. I mean, yes, Xbox and Microsoft has to go back to square one to reinvent some of this stuff.
1189000	1201000	Because there's a lot of, unfortunately, the thing is there's a lot of people that have to give approval to that. You have to get the approval from the publishers, you have to get approval from, you know, well, they have to create the infrastructure for it and stuff.
1201000	1217000	And it's just, I don't think there's a lot of incentive for them to do that. Whereas, you know, you could do all sorts of crazy stuff on PC and, you know, you get better pricing with Steam and stuff just because there are multiple places that you can buy Steam, you know, licenses and stuff.
1217000	1225000	And they're all competing with each other for, you know, the lowest prices. Or you can get DRM free or whatever, you know.
1225000	1234000	Desura, I mean, there's a lot of options available. Whereas, that's why it always bugged me when people are like, well, you know, when they get rid of the used games, it's going to drive the price of games down.
1234000	1244000	I'm like, no, it's not going to fucking drive the games down because what they've done now is they've even limited the marketplace so much more that you can only, you know, return your games at certain retailers.
1245000	1258000	So basically, these retailers are going to have an advantage and are they really going to be, you know, wanting to drop the price of their game considering, you know, or the game that they're selling because, you know, you're going to be more likely to go there anyway.
1258000	1263000	So why bother trying to compete when they're kind of limiting the competition?
1263000	1275000	I am very curious about where people's heads are at after all this DRM stuff because for me, I'm, you know, I had the whole discussion last week about I'm out, I'm out, I'm not having this.
1275000	1281000	But now that this is mentioned that they're going to remove this, I'm probably going to get an Xbox One.
1281000	1286000	I'm not going to get one this holiday season because that's too much. Like, just financially, I can't afford it.
1286000	1295000	But next year, especially when more of these exclusives are out, by the time Halo 5 is out, I'll get one. I think I'll get an Xbox One now that the DRM thing has worked out.
1295000	1303000	But that's me. And I'm really curious about you guys. So I want to use this as an excuse to go to a live poll.
1304000	1308000	So if you go to live.vognetwork.com, there's a poll up right now.
1308000	1312000	How do you feel about an Xbox One post 180?
1312000	1314000	Obviously, how do you feel about it after the flip?
1314000	1320000	Four answers. I was going to buy one, and I still am. I was going to buy one, but now I'm not.
1320000	1327000	Maybe, I don't know. I was going to buy one before, or excuse me, I wasn't going to buy one before, but now I am.
1327000	1332000	And then I'm still not buying it. What's your thoughts on Xbox One right now?
1332000	1338000	Live.vognetwork.com if you're a registered VOG Network participant. We'll read the answers here momentarily.
1338000	1343000	Jamie, I was going to ask where your head's at with this. You read us the story, but you didn't tell me where your head's at after it.
1343000	1353000	I still don't care enough about the Xbox One to get one. Dan and I were pretty much already decided on the PS4 because it's an upgraded Blu-ray player.
1353000	1362000	And keep in mind, our PS3 is a release model. So it's been surviving for a very, very long time.
1362000	1367000	And we don't know when it's going to go. So yeah, we had already decided on the PS4.
1368000	1374000	And I think that this is too little, too late. There's still a lot of unknowns. They haven't clarified anything.
1374000	1379000	And I don't really care about the Kinect. I really don't. I don't really care about Move.
1379000	1388000	But at least I have an option of not having to buy Move. I would rather just not deal with it.
1389000	1399000	All right. We'll read the answers momentarily. The Xbox One exclusives were good enough for me that I'm very interested in checking it out.
1399000	1405000	And still, as we learned this week, a lot can change still between now and the day this thing launches.
1405000	1415000	I'm not saying they're necessarily going to go back on the Kinect policy and all that, but it is not without reason that Microsoft couldn't say,
1415000	1421000	hey, we're going to do the subsidized console. We're going to put out our console for $299 with the two-year gold subscription.
1421000	1428000	I mean, there's still more ammo that Microsoft could throw at this thing that, you know, I don't know if we've seen the last of this just yet.
1428000	1436000	But we'll see. Any other comments on the Xbox DRM reversal situation? Anybody? All right.
1436000	1442000	The whole removal of features, it seems like, it was like, fine, you want it this way. We're just going to take our ball of special features and go home with it.
1442000	1448000	It seemed like kind of like a dick move that they probably could have just kept in there. What was the ball? What was it?
1448000	1459000	It was the potential. I brought you a present. But now that you don't want to do things my way, you're never going to find out what the present was.
1459000	1467000	I did like how they fed into like the whole like, oh, you guys, we heard your feedback and we're doing what's good for you.
1467000	1473000	Yes, I'm glad you're concerned about what's good for me now, three days later after your console sucked.
1473000	1478000	As funny as this conversation all is, though, for real, everybody was fucking pissed about it.
1478000	1483000	Sony got a standing ovation when they got there and they got to even interject negatives.
1483000	1487000	Sony got away with saying, we're going to charge you to play multiplayer.
1487000	1496000	The number one reason our fanboys love us more, I mean not the number one, but one of the big things fanboys love to hold over Microsoft fanboys heads is that you can play multiplayer.
1496000	1500000	You can play multiplayer free. We are going to start charging for that and nobody cares.
1500000	1504000	We're getting standing ovations because we went against Microsoft's policies.
1504000	1510000	And now that Microsoft switched those policies to be the same thing, I still feel like a lot of people are like, yeah, fuck them.
1510000	1512000	It doesn't matter.
1512000	1517000	Still charging less and and home still offered some more fun than Gold did.
1517000	1523000	Well, the perception is, too, that, you know, you have Sony who did the right thing the first time.
1523000	1527000	Now, whether we know whether they changed the decision last minute, who knows.
1527000	1532000	But OK, so the perception is that they made the right choice the first time.
1532000	1542000	Then you have Microsoft that made the wrong choice in everybody's eyes and then kind of recanted on that because they they value what the consumer wants.
1542000	1552000	So, I mean, the problem that I have there is either, A, they didn't value what the consumer wants and they were going to do their own damn thing or B, they really didn't know what the consumer wanted.
1552000	1558000	And now they do all of a sudden. I mean, are they really out of touch or they just don't give a shit?
1558000	1566000	So I can't really I don't know. I don't really want to get an Xbox One right now.
1566000	1572000	And the reason and I love the controller and it looks like fun, but I just can't support that kind of thing.
1572000	1575000	And I'm sorry that, you know, OK, so you went back on it.
1575000	1581000	You know, that's kind of like if I called Jamie a giant bitch and then said, sorry, just kidding.
1581000	1587000	I didn't really mean that. It's still hurtful in the beginning. I do that every day.
1587000	1591000	I'm just saying, you know, I call you a bigger bitch. So what's that? That's fact fact.
1591000	1599000	So I'm just saying, like, are we supposed to all of a sudden forget, you know, the bad choices that they made just because they they went ahead and fixed some of it?
1599000	1603000	You know, I'm sorry. I'm just not going to. Well, I don't know.
1603000	1610000	OK, but to be low key, I got to play devil's advocate with you on that, because to be fair, Sony's made their own share of bad decisions.
1610000	1615000	That's true. So why are we so quick to loyally throw ourselves upon Sony?
1615000	1620000	Fuck me now, Sony, you're so wonderful. Give me everything my heart desires.
1620000	1623000	What bad decisions are we talking about here?
1623000	1631000	Well, for one, you're about to read a story later in the show that strikes me as a pretty bad decision to release a firmware when it's clearly not ready.
1631000	1639000	But that's one. The whole fact that the network got hacked and they had to shut down the system for for however long they did because of it.
1639000	1646000	OK. And then they appease everybody. And they also gave away free games as opposed to Microsoft, who said hack.
1646000	1651000	We didn't get fucking hacked. Your money just disappeared by ghosts. Ghosts stole it.
1651000	1659000	You know, like they didn't even fucking you admit that they've been hacked, even though it's been proven over and over and over again that they have been hacked.
1659000	1670000	And then they then they all of a sudden, oh, yeah, we're going to go ahead and increase our authentication for like stuff, make it a little harder to log in, you know, more security, because, you know, because we just we're we're valuing the consumer.
1670000	1677000	We want to make sure that you're protected and not because we got hacked and your money got stolen and we didn't do shit about it for over a year.
1677000	1682000	I I just recalled some other bad decisions that Sony has made in the past.
1682000	1688000	Are you ready? Here we go. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Kaz Harai Ridge Racer.
1689000	1696000	The essence of the PlayStation DNA is real change and the consumers are ready.
1696000	1705000	Genji two is an action game which is based on Japanese history. Ridge Racer being based on history.
1705000	1713000	The stages of the game will also be based on famous battles which took actually took place in ancient Japan.
1713000	1720000	So here's this giant enemy crab ridge racer and new best parts coming up.
1720000	1726000	We point for massive damage. It's Ridge Racer Ridge Racer.
1726000	1734000	PlayStation three will retail for five hundred and ninety nine U.S. dollars. Five hundred and ninety nine U.S. dollars. Five hundred and ninety nine U.S. dollars.
1734000	1742000	Giant enemy crab. Five. There you go. Those were all bad ideas. OK. Bad ideas that didn't affect the consumer really in any way.
1742000	1748000	Five hundred and ninety nine U.S. dollars. Five hundred and ninety nine U.S. dollars. It came down price.
1748000	1754000	So they launched their new system at five hundred ninety nine U.S. dollars. No it was not. It was at three hundred ninety nine.
1754000	1758000	And Microsoft is now launching at four hundred ninety nine. You'd think that they would learn the lesson.
1759000	1769000	But my thing is so that like even look at like PlayStation Plus PlayStation Plus is 10 bucks less a year and you get free games with that.
1769000	1777000	You get them on Xbox now. But only until the one we did buy the most expensive release of it because well Dan managed GameStop.
1777000	1785000	We had the in but we when we had the money for it we put it down. We wanted what what they had to offer the backwards compatibility.
1785000	1793000	It will definitely give in our collection. Yeah. Fully backwards compatible launch with Wi-Fi built in on one system one version of it.
1793000	1799000	But OK. But still though they paid for that with the poor sales and stuff.
1799000	1804000	So I think that they've made up for the fact that you know they basically don't want to repeat their mistakes.
1804000	1811000	However I just don't see a lot of like you know I don't see any decisions that they've made.
1811000	1816000	They've really affected the consumer poorly like you know oh hey we're gonna have this really weird DRM.
1816000	1822000	OK. Online passes they did that first party online passes which is a little ridiculous.
1822000	1828000	So they did that. So I guess that's a fault there. They're not doing it anymore. So they've corrected that mistake.
1828000	1837000	So I think they've taken all the like kind of negatives about their console and kind of corrected their mistakes and trying to go kind of a fresh start for their new thing.
1837000	1844000	Whereas Microsoft said hey you know we had a pretty good ride. Let's just see what we can do to I don't know make our ride go faster.
1844000	1850000	And they started ripping parts out of the car and then just somehow it's going to work better because they don't know what they're doing.
1850000	1854000	All right. Well this debate is going to be continuing for the next several months.
1854000	1858000	All I can say is like now we've got ourselves a console war like for real.
1858000	1865000	Like I I I don't remember one and I think I even said this last week before the reversal.
1865000	1870000	I don't remember a console war this good since the 90s and full page magazine ads.
1870000	1877000	It's like our system does with this one doesn't you know like this is the popcorn dot gift.
1877000	1881000	And yes I said gift. Deal with it. All right.
1881000	1888000	OK. I'm sorry. Bobby says Microsoft made mistakes in but corrected them. But fuck them. No they're still making mistakes right now.
1888000	1894000	And it's a little different saying you paraphrase the quote but that's OK. Whatever I'm OK.
1894000	1898000	His exact quote was Sony made mistakes but corrected them. So they're awesome.
1898000	1904000	Microsoft made mistakes but correct them. But fuck them. There's still a lot of bidding get to you.
1904000	1913000	There's still a lot. Yes. And saying that came for me. So there's still a lot though that they still have to fix that you know needs to be taken care of.
1913000	1920000	Price point connect always required. And basically just I don't know.
1920000	1931000	I just don't like the way that they're kind of looking at the consumers right now. It's kind of is very much like Sony was back at the launch of the PS3 where it's like you're our consumers and not our customers.
1931000	1943000	So I think I was expected though that Microsoft being a company of their size would kind of look at hmm here's what didn't work for the other guy.
1943000	1950000	So maybe we shouldn't try doing that too instead of it didn't work for them. But we're better. So we're going to make it work for us.
1950000	1957000	And that's my thing. All right. Let's get to the results a live poll because I shut this off like a minute ago and haven't read the results.
1957000	1965000	Okay. Here are the results of the live poll. How do you feel about an Xbox One post their 180. I'm surprised at these results. Here we go.
1965000	1972000	Number one answer with fifty three point five seven percent. I'm still not buying it.
1972000	1978000	Zero percent. Not a single single vote for I was going to buy one but now I'm not.
1978000	1987000	That doesn't surprise me much. But that does tell me that even for the fans the whole family share and all that that wasn't the deal maker.
1987000	1991000	There's upsetness over that but it's not it's it's not a done deal now that that's out of the picture.
1991000	2001000	That doesn't surprise me. Zero answers for that. Here's how the rest of it breaks down. Thirty two point one four percent for I was going to buy one anyway and still am.
2001000	2007000	So a third of the listeners buying an Xbox One that's not too shabby and then fourteen point two nine percent.
2007000	2015000	Where are my heads at. I wasn't going to buy one before but now I am. So I guess I am the fourteen point two nine percent.
2015000	2027000	Well I still want a PlayStation 4 just because I don't have to mainly because I'm play both at my work and at home and I don't want to have to lug the system and connect with me every time I'm going back and forth.
2027000	2040000	That's that reason. And it's one hundred dollars cheaper. Also all the first and this applies for both Sony and Microsoft all their first party exclusive tiles aside from the very like two or three at launch.
2040000	2044000	All of the ones that I really wanted to play aren't coming out until like sometime next year.
2044000	2054000	So I'm like I don't really feel the need to like buy an Xbox One now for Sunset Overdrive which by the time we get to next year who knows how many of those titles are going to be delayed beyond next year.
2054000	2068000	So last of us are not last of us the last guardian anybody. I mean so I don't know. To be fair again Loki Sony same problems could be there but I mean I said for both I said it applies to both.
2068000	2077000	I am in the PlayStation 4 camp and that's probably mostly for third party games. But yeah. All right. Anyway we got to move on. Thank you.
2077000	2084000	Thank you. Great discussion in chat. I just I haven't been able to read all the comments but I've been kind of watching so I just want to shout out live on network dot com.
2084000	2093000	And if you haven't been here for a live show you're missing out because some great like fourth host commentary going on and I want to say one thing though and this does apply.
2093000	2103000	This ties back to the PlayStation 3 launch where the fuck is a new Ridge Racer game because seriously there is how many consoles have launched recently and not one single fucking Ridge Racer game.
2103000	2115000	That is the launch game. I kind of think that between what I just played there and the Vita game I think Ridge Racer may not kind of make it may actually be viewed as a bit of a negative right now.
2115000	2123000	It may be not a game people want a bug bear doing it but bears the pretty awesome they did that. Microsoft's got fours as Sony's got this drive club.
2123000	2133000	You know it's they have a free to play Ridge Racer game that's coming. So that was the Vita. No the Vita one was buy to play or buy to get four tracks.
2133000	2143000	But they do have a free to play one by bug bear that's going to be a PC game. But maybe they'll come to the console as well. Jamie I'm looking at these comments in chat.
2143000	2151000	I didn't catch this whole thing but I know it's clear clear 404 talk about about the Intellivision was technology super technologically superior to the Atari.
2151000	2153000	You guys are kicking it old school in chat right now.
2153000	2165000	What got started on is you know all of the comparisons about the meeting it to console war but saying that these two are technologically similar to each other.
2165000	2173000	Well we're going over the console war between the Genesis and the Super Nintendo. Super Nintendo technically was the technologically superior system.
2173000	2183000	And the games did cost more because they were cost more to manufacture but they were in a stat to stat comparison technologically superior.
2183000	2188000	Then we went back to Intellivision versus Atari and I had a Cliccovision which kicked all of them.
2188000	2194000	How about the 80s though man you think what how many consoles do we have right now like maybe I guess maybe four.
2194000	2204000	You have your Xbox ones your PlayStation fours your Wii U and then the Android boxes. I'm going to lump all those in one category.
2204000	2213000	Well are kind of well the reason why I bring that up is that you go back to the 80s. Oh my God it was consoles and family computers all battling each other.
2213000	2219000	Let's start with the 70s we had the first Odyssey the Fairchild Channel F. There was the.
2219000	2229000	Well no I'm just I'm just thinking about those magazine ads I used to see where you would see the screenshots like a Frogger would show you a screenshot from the Atari computer Atari 2600 Commodore 64.
2229000	2238000	TRS-80, Coleco, Intellivision, Apple like the like there was a lot of fucking console like I guess they weren't really consoles.
2238000	2244000	They didn't really run into the exclusive thing so much. Gaming devices. It was like we need to get this shit out there. Yeah.
2244000	2251000	But I mean but if you think about it though I like as far as I can think of it.
2251000	2258000	There started to be that divergence between PC and console gaming but everything always went into a big bottleneck of popularity.
2258000	2269000	While you might have had other systems out you know things eventually slid back into the 8-bit era where it was the Master System versus the NES and the NES really stomped Sega with that.
2269000	2274000	But then you had Genesis versus SNES and then you had versus the TurboGrafx.
2274000	2283000	That's what I was saying is that you had NEC come in and put out their own system PC Engine in Japan which did a lot better over there than it did here.
2283000	2292000	And then you know then you start it just basically goes into this bottleneck you'll see other systems start to come around but now we're in this sort of.
2292000	2308000	It's like three is the sweet number for consoles out two to three systems that has to be that major competition and now we've got like the sitting there we've got phone game we have mobile gaming but really you're getting into the big three bottlenecks and it's like big big loops.
2308000	2312000	The way that the console thing goes and now we've got a full blown war again.
2312000	2314000	It's all just a big mess.
2314000	2315000	Drama.
2315000	2316000	All right.
2316000	2319000	Fun debate but we're almost to seven o'clock here on the west coast.
2319000	2323000	So I want to get into how is your gaming week so we can get into some news.
2323000	2324000	Ladies first dark soccer.
2324000	2327000	How is your gaming week and what type of video games have you been playing this week?
2327000	2328000	Final Fantasy 14.
2328000	2329000	It's purty.
2329000	2330000	It's purty.
2330000	2331000	Oh my God.
2331000	2334000	I have mine so it's like uber graphic everything.
2334000	2338000	And I have absolutely zero draw in.
2338000	2339000	It's amazing.
2339000	2345000	And the, the, the, the duties are hard.
2345000	2347000	They're fucking hard.
2347000	2351000	I have a level 13 thaumaturge.
2351000	2358000	And I have a I just made it okay I made a marauder because I wanted to see what the pirate stuff look like.
2358000	2361000	And I named her Friska because she's blue.
2361000	2363000	Well not blue she's gray.
2363000	2365000	Anyway.
2365000	2378000	So I've been playing that I've been playing massive I played some more Mass Effect three because I got all that high res stuff working and I actually have like a mostly high res Normandy interior now.
2378000	2387000	So I'm going to put that in as basically just making sure all my mods worked, but everything that has worked has been absolutely gorgeous.
2387000	2395000	And then I'm still playing through the first Mass Effect, which I'm also playing in a higher resolution because I've patched that one too.
2395000	2399000	Thank you text mod.
2399000	2405000	I'm trying to go through I did not say duty bite me.
2405000	2416000	I've been looking through my other list of games but to be perfectly honest, I have had zero energy all week because I've just had this flu that's kicked my ass.
2416000	2428000	And, unfortunately, I've been well actually I'm not saying unfortunately because sleep is awesome. I've been doing a lot of sleeping. I'm playing sleep the game.
2428000	2430000	Achievement unlocked.
2430000	2435000	You slept for 24 hours. Yes, I did.
2435000	2438000	All right, let me move on to our guests next.
2438000	2440000	You all are a bunch of five year olds.
2440000	2442000	You're done right.
2442000	2444000	Oh, everybody in chat.
2444000	2446000	All right, let me go to JV Montclair.
2446000	2450000	What did the hero do in the bathroom he did his duty.
2450000	2461000	JV one now is your gaming week. It was pretty good. I mean, all I have with me is my 3ds so that's kind of all I've been playing I've been playing mostly just Kingdom Hearts dream drop distance.
2461000	2466000	You told me before the show you've never played an Animal Crossing game. That is true. I've never played it.
2466000	2468000	Fuck is wrong with you.
2468000	2470000	It's like the furry Sims.
2470000	2482000	This is not the furry Sims maybe a little bit really isn't the first. I don't know, I never was given the game. When it came out on GameCube, so I didn't really care when it came out on DS, or we.
2482000	2489000	So I kind of, I kind of just don't care now everybody's like oh my god I'm crossing and I was like, okay.
2489000	2492000	Haters gonna hate. I'm not hating.
2492000	2495000	It's not hate when you don't care. All right, fine.
2495000	2502000	You would rather get apathy crossing. Sure apathy crossing.
2502000	2505000	With a little penguin that just says dot dot dot.
2505000	2511000	Now if you're going by the Japanese version animal forest, it would be like animal suicide forest.
2511000	2513000	That's morbid.
2513000	2523000	I'm not against the concept of me playing Animal Crossing it's just that I'm not going to be the one to go out and buy it for myself if somebody wants to give me Animal Crossing, I'll play it.
2523000	2530000	Oh, you're being a Jamie right now I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna buy Minecraft with my own money but if someone wants to get it for me.
2531000	2541000	I might fall in love with it, but I've also been playing Earthbound on emulator Android emulator and plants versus zombies.
2541000	2559000	My best friend got me plants versus zombies and my free time my free time Oh God what has happened to my free time, looking at some comments and chat at live.vognetwork.com SSJ 100 Matt, I haven't played an Animal Crossing game before, it must be a New York thing because you guys don't know what a forest is.
2559000	2561000	It must be something like that.
2561000	2570000	Koopa Kid Janko says, I'm trying to watch the chat, listen to the show and hunt beetles and Animal Crossing at the same time media overload.
2570000	2579000	At least those are all awesome things to be doing. And Brad from pop culture says I never played one either tell this new one. Welcome to crack forest.
2579000	2583000	I know the first thing I'm going to do is save up a million bells and buy a crown.
2583000	2592000	So I can be the queen of my village. I just, I was excited because I finally got to replace a villager saying, that's my favorite thing to do is to get them to say new things.
2592000	2597000	So in honor of Alan, my little breathe the bunny now says lol butts after everything.
2598000	2603000	You had a character in my GameCube one saying bitch face. Remember?
2603000	2605000	Maybe. I may have done that.
2605000	2607000	And then you stole my lesbian.
2607000	2608000	Yeah.
2608000	2609000	I'm so mad.
2609000	2611000	I do that. All right.
2611000	2613000	Anything else, Jamie?
2613000	2615000	No, I think that's about it.
2615000	2616000	Loki.
2616000	2620000	I just played Final Fantasy 14. Well, yesterday pretty much.
2620000	2625000	And it's all right. I played it on the PlayStation 3.
2625000	2632000	So the graphics are okay. I don't know if they're going to be that great compared to the PC though. Obviously not.
2632000	2645000	But it was fun. I am a level 8 black mage because I'm not going to fucking refer to their, the classes that have been in the goddamn franchise for how many years now.
2645000	2647000	And we're all of a sudden going to flip them on.
2647000	2653000	Here's the deal. Here's the deal. There are black mages like called a black mage in Final Fantasy 14.
2653000	2654000	It's BLM.
2654000	2655000	Yeah, you don't see.
2655000	2656000	Thaumaturge is different.
2656000	2662000	Yeah, you don't see them yet because they had to rear end that into the game. They had to like back park that into the game.
2662000	2670000	Because yes, the original creators of 14 were smoking crack and made up all these new classes like Thaumaturge, Gladiator and all this stuff that wasn't very Final Fantasy 14.
2670000	2677000	But when the fans bitched and moaned and complained, now the black mage and white mage, they're there, but they're advanced classes.
2677000	2685000	So at least in old 14, I think when you got like a Thaumaturge to 20 and a Conjurer to 10, you could become a black mage.
2685000	2691000	I might be screwing up those numbers, but like those jobs do exist later. They're just considered the advanced jobs.
2691000	2694000	So to be fair, Loki, amongst your anger.
2694000	2703000	As I said, level eight black mage. And basically I am spamming Blizzard to win. And that's, you know, kind of how it goes.
2703000	2710000	And I have thunder now and I can I guess thunder is like DPS or something. And yeah.
2710000	2720000	And I let my son play the game for a while. So there was there was a good portion where he was running into a wall and jumping in a fountain because, you know, and I had video of that.
2720000	2725000	But my wife does want me to post it on the internet because she's in it and she doesn't like being in any of the videos.
2725000	2727000	We may have to explain the lesbian, Rob.
2727000	2731000	All right. Please go ahead. Wasn't she like a duck or something?
2731000	2732000	No, she was an aardvark.
2732000	2734000	Yeah. No, she wasn't an aardvark.
2734000	2737000	She had the big blue nose. Didn't she?
2737000	2740000	No, I don't think she was an aardvark. I think she was a duck.
2740000	2742000	Whatever. But she was totally a gym teacher.
2743000	2754000	OK. Yeah. You go into her house. She's wearing sweats and everything is like one of those horses things that you jump over and gym equipment and everything.
2754000	2756000	Her her room was a gym.
2756000	2759000	So we and her house was playing KK Lilith Fair.
2759000	2766000	Yeah, it was playing some music or the other that sounded really, you know, very SJW now, I guess.
2766000	2776000	But so we put a rainbow sign outside her house and we like had her say something that was like super gay.
2776000	2780000	I don't know, because we were just being really awful because she was so stereotypical.
2780000	2782000	Yeah. And we just called her our lesbian.
2782000	2785000	Admittedly, these were horrible stereotypes.
2785000	2789000	But, you know, all in all, if you can't poke fun at each other, what can you do?
2789000	2794000	Exactly. So and I mean, I even I.
2794000	2800000	Everyone I ever showed this character to said, is she a lesbian? So she ended up being the town lesbian.
2800000	2805000	Apparently, she's the only one. She couldn't get a date. I mean, if someone had moved into the house with her, then we would have known.
2805000	2808000	Yeah, right. Bad stereotypes, I know.
2808000	2814000	OK. So anyway, anyway. So Rob stole her. Rob stole my lesbian, but I got her back.
2814000	2820000	I did want to mention one last thing, because I am taking that C++ course and is game related stuff.
2820000	2831000	So one of the later when I get into the whole racing engine making thing tutorial, there's an example game done by the guy that teaches the course.
2831000	2836000	He sings the theme song for it. And it's fucking fantastic. Really?
2836000	2840000	The guy's awesome, actually, because he's like this like Brit. I don't know if he's like British.
2840000	2843000	He kind of looks British. But how do you look?
2843000	2846000	It sounds pretty. He's extra.
2846000	2851000	He looks like the guy. And this is I hate him to stereotype.
2851000	2853000	Hey, stop, stop, stop.
2853000	2858000	He sounds British. OK, so you like his beans on toast.
2858000	2863000	He sounds British. But OK, so the guy he kind of just order a fucking crumpet.
2863000	2868000	Get out of here, you dirty Brit. And I hate even referring back to this.
2868000	2874000	But only because I had to watch the whole series of this damn show. He looks like the husband on medium.
2874000	2879000	OK, doctor, do you have to take a lift to get up to the classroom?
2879000	2885000	Welcome the pavement. Are you the doctor?
2885000	2890000	It's like I totally forgot what Loki was trying to really say, but it's all look at my face.
2890000	2894000	I ain't bothered. All right. Moving on. My turn.
2894000	2899000	So games that I've been playing this week, I've also been playing the Final Fantasy 14 beta.
2899000	2902000	And let me tell you, y'all, it's really good. I love it.
2902000	2906000	And I was was trying to spend some time thinking about why do I love this game so much?
2906000	2909000	Because I liked 11 to I liked 11 an awful lot.
2909000	2915000	I played it for three years, but 11 felt like a PC MMO that they kind of.
2915000	2919000	And I'm going to use that analogy back parked again into a PlayStation 2.
2919000	2926000	I realize 11 was a very PlayStation 2 or it was a very, very heavily played on PlayStation 2 in Japan.
2926000	2930000	But it really always felt like one thing real quick. I was going to mention about the on console,
2930000	2934000	because I don't know if you guys are playing with PC controllers or whatever keyboard, mouse and stuff,
2934000	2939000	but the macro system that they have now with the shoulder buttons and stuff is fucking awesome on the console.
2939000	2945000	So just mention. Well, I know, but I was going to say Final Fantasy 14 plays like a console game on the PC.
2945000	2950000	This truly feels like I'm playing like a console Final Fantasy game where there just happens to be
2950000	2953000	other people running around and we can go do dungeons together if we want.
2953000	2957000	And we can do the guild quest things if we want. We can do all that.
2957000	2960000	Or I could just play it myself and enjoy the story.
2960000	2963000	And like, I really think this new producer kind of gets it.
2963000	2967000	And you see it in the last letter that he put out there is like, that was long.
2967000	2969000	Well, if you really read it. Yeah.
2969000	2975000	Yeah. He's really trying to talk about, you know, there's a lot of people out there that are afraid to play MMOs
2975000	2982000	because they're like, oh, other people. So we wanted to create a story that would work without other people,
2982000	2987000	but we weren't necessarily going to make it easy. And I just, I thought that was a great way to approach it.
2987000	2989000	And that's how the game really feels to me.
2989000	2996000	Well, and there was the, what was the comment about you get caught up in the story of each town where,
2996000	3002000	and I really like that each town has its own sort of politics around that area instead of, oh,
3002000	3008000	can you go take this letter to Ironforge? Yeah, the dwarves are doing this, but we live in Stormwind.
3008000	3013000	Fuck them. Basically, you don't have to do the big town hopping thing.
3013000	3020000	You work in your community around your town and then when you've exhausted your area around your town,
3020000	3024000	then it's logical to move on. And so just going, well, I'm just going to level over here now.
3024000	3029000	It's the one thing that's really interesting to me. This game has potential to be a huge hit.
3029000	3034000	And I'm not, I don't even, I'm not going to say wow killer because I really think there's room at the table
3034000	3037000	for more than one online game. There's lots of online games people play.
3037000	3042000	I think Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn has the potential to be a huge game,
3042000	3047000	which is interesting because it's not the first time they've released the game, which is a whole nother story.
3047000	3053000	The problem is going to be that subscription fee and convincing people that, yes, to run around and play a solo game,
3053000	3056000	I'm going to pay $15 a month.
3056000	3057000	I'm convinced.
3057000	3060000	I'm convinced too, but there's going to be a lot of people that aren't.
3060000	3067000	I'm not. And the reason why is because there's other MMOs out there that, you know, played that just are that one time.
3067000	3072000	What new content are they really adding on a regular basis other than server upkeep?
3072000	3077000	It's just there's other games that you can buy at once and play it.
3078000	3087000	I can't dedicate enough time every month to playing this game when I'm playing a ton of stuff to justify paying a monthly subscription.
3087000	3092000	I'm very curious to see what Endgame looks like because that's going to be the make or break for this game.
3092000	3096000	It's convincing people once they beat the single player campaign to keep paying for this game.
3096000	3100000	You know what I mean? So we'll see. We'll see. I love it. We'll see.
3100000	3107000	I did have to say in looking at, and again, I didn't try it on PS3. I didn't want to bother with it because I can't use the controller anyway.
3107000	3118000	I did look at video comparisons and to be honest, I think that the PS3 version is going to, it suffers in the visual department.
3118000	3124000	I have a really important question for everybody. Can somebody please explain to me why this bottle of Patron is still sealed?
3124000	3127000	I need to be having a shot of that if I'm going to drive home.
3128000	3131000	I'm like, why is this thing not open yet? Anyway, I'll work on that.
3131000	3133000	I'm curious to see what the PS4 version is going to look like.
3133000	3139000	Me too. I have one other game I got to talk about real quick because everybody's been talking about Final Fantasy XIV, but I do have one other game that's important for me to get out there.
3139000	3147000	Super Mario Brothers U had the DLC come out for Super Luigi. What's it called? Super Luigi Brothers U or something?
3147000	3150000	It's New Super Luigi U.
3150000	3153000	Whatever it's called, y'all know what it is. It's the game with Luigi.
3153000	3159000	It really threw me at first because I'm like, Nintendo DLC, this is so weird.
3159000	3165000	I know they had the levels on the 3DS one, but to do it on a console, this is so weird.
3165000	3173000	But here it is, you guys. It's the exact same map, but all the stages in the map have been redone when you play as Luigi.
3173000	3176000	And it's really cute because they threw in some illusions to Luigi.
3176000	3182000	Like there's Luigi shapes in the dirt that you see, like little Luigi fossils or something.
3182000	3187000	You see little statues of Luigi made out of the bush, and they're not all obvious.
3187000	3193000	Like some of them are kind of very subtle, so I really kind of like that they threw all those nods to Luigi in there.
3193000	3198000	But anyway, every level is redone and you only have 100 seconds to clear each level.
3198000	3204000	So honestly, Super Luigi U is like a really good ROM hack that Nintendo endorses.
3204000	3208000	That's not a bad thing. I think it's pretty cool.
3208000	3212000	20 bucks, a little hefty, but it's very, very robust.
3212000	3215000	I mean, it is every single level start to finish.
3215000	3220000	Granted, you only have the 100 seconds, but I think there's going to be a lot of people that are up for the challenge of,
3220000	3223000	not only can I clear the level, can I get all three coins?
3223000	3229000	Because some of them are really hard and it's going to take that Mega Man level of muscle memory in order to be able to do it.
3229000	3233000	And I think there's a lot of people that want that difficulty out of a Mario Brothers game.
3233000	3235000	So here you go. Enjoy.
3235000	3239000	Gameguru in chat says, now it's Luigi's time to shine.
3239000	3242000	Nabbit steals all the power-ups. Dang, Nabbit.
3242000	3246000	Yeah, Nabbit is still, that whole thing is actually still in the game.
3246000	3252000	But you know what else is weird? Because since Mario's not in it, you have Luigi the two toads and Nabbit is the fourth player.
3252000	3255000	So you could have Nabbit chasing Nabbit. It's very meta.
3256000	3262000	But Nabbit actually is the kind of easy mode in the game because Nabbit can't die.
3262000	3264000	Oh, really? I didn't know that. Oh.
3265000	3268000	I haven't switched away from Luigi. Interesting.
3268000	3272000	Tigerclaw reminding us Super Luigi U is also going to be a standalone product as well.
3272000	3277000	You know, I got to give props to Nintendo for really dummy-proofing their DLC.
3277000	3281000	Like, they're not trying to make an easy buck off of somebody stupid because, you know,
3281000	3287000	when you go into the store to download it, it says, do you own Super Mario Brothers Wii U?
3287000	3292000	You cannot play this without it. And you have to hit yes, I own it in order to download it.
3292000	3301000	And it even says, if you download this, or no, it says, if you own the disc of Super Luigi U, you do not need to download this.
3301000	3307000	They are the same. Like, there's a lot of little reminders in there and I thought, wow, they're really idiot-proofing this so they don't get any angry phone calls.
3307000	3310000	Although somebody's still gonna fuck up. You know it.
3310000	3314000	I think Nintendo's MO, though, is, you know, CYA.
3314000	3321000	True. Cover your assets. Koopakit Jeremy in chat pointing out, Nabbit can die in pits, but otherwise invincible.
3321000	3328000	You know what the trick is, though? Get that baby Yoshi and do his little, get the pink one where when you hit the trigger, he blows up like a balloon.
3328000	3332000	So easy to get through a lot of levels of that. Just saying. Good times.
3332000	3337000	Alright. GameGuru says, I got to admit, Nintendo's first attempt at DLC is rather admirable.
3337000	3345000	To be fair, the gold coins, Super Mario 2, I can't even keep them straight anymore, that was the first DLC.
3345000	3348000	But first console DLC, yes. There you go.
3348000	3354000	Alright. That's it for gaming weeks. We gotta move on. We've got stories to get into.
3354000	3355000	That's all we did.
3355000	3359000	Well, we got this bottle of Patron to open here.
3359000	3360000	I need my one shot.
3360000	3365000	But first, we gotta do housekeeping. And I've got a lot of housekeeping tonight, so I'll try to make this quick.
3365000	3369000	First off, I have to give a wink and a nod to the fact that it is our 11th birthday.
3369000	3373000	Thank you all, OLR me, for your support of this show.
3373000	3377000	And, you know, we may not have the biggest audience on the internet, but we have some of the most loyal.
3377000	3382000	And you guys are amazing, and you turn up here Sunday nights, and you are really our motivation for still doing this.
3382000	3385000	I mean, OLR will have to end some day.
3385000	3388000	Not saying tomorrow, not saying this, so don't panic.
3388000	3390000	But I'm just saying, it's gonna end some day.
3390000	3398000	Because, you know, eventually somebody's gonna move away, there's gonna be a job, there's just gonna be something where we're not gonna be able to do the show anymore.
3398000	3407000	But we couldn't have kept it going as long as we have and had the discipline and the motivation to be here every Sunday if it weren't for you guys and your continued support.
3407000	3413000	And it really feels like our family grows every week. I see new people in chat every week, and it's just amazing.
3413000	3420000	And when people ask me, like, why do you do that? You've done that every Sunday? How on earth? Where do you find your motivation?
3420000	3422000	I'm like, just look at the chat.
3422000	3424000	No, the other thing. You don't get paid?
3424000	3425000	Yeah, yeah.
3425000	3426000	No?
3426000	3428000	Yeah. I got that one today, didn't I?
3428000	3432000	So, you guys are great. Thank you so much.
3432000	3438000	So here's to 11 more years, we hope. We're gonna keep doing this as long as we possibly can.
3439000	3447000	Other things I want to plug. I would like to give a shout out, and many of them are in chat, so I'm just gonna say holla to the Koopa Club podcast.
3447000	3453000	They spell it a little funky, so let me spell that for you. It's Q-O-O-P-A-K-L-U-B.
3453000	3461000	And you can search that on iTunes or what have you, whatever podcasting site, because they had me as a guest on their 25th episode this week.
3461000	3465000	So would it be like it's all the Koopa kids except they're played by John Delancey?
3465000	3473000	Yes. It's just like that, actually. What? Alright, so yeah, check that out. I was on their latest episode, it was a lot of fun.
3473000	3480000	And they asked me some dirty questions about Nintendo. It was a very Nintendo love episode, and the last question was a little bit dirty.
3480000	3486000	They made me pick the Merry Fuck Kill from the Nintendo world, so I'm gonna just leave it at that. So there you go.
3488000	3494000	Also, since I brought up Koopa Club, I want to give a shout out to GamerX, because I haven't been plugging this enough on Orange Launch Radio.
3494000	3501000	But if you're in Northern California, especially the Bay Area, you've got to go to GamerX. That's gonna be on August 3rd and August 4th.
3501000	3506000	And it's taking place, I forget the name of the hotel, but it's Japan Town.
3506000	3508000	Somewhere. Oh, Miyako.
3508000	3510000	Yeah, it's that whole district.
3510000	3513000	This is the side that's the Miyako Mall, right?
3513000	3515000	Can I just say why Allen is perfect?
3515000	3518000	I don't know, because those are peanut butter chocolate brownies.
3518000	3520000	Allen, you just got home from work.
3520000	3521000	Yes.
3521000	3522000	You literally walked through the door.
3522000	3523000	Yes.
3523000	3524000	What was the first place you went to?
3524000	3530000	I went into the kitchen and got shot glasses and put them on the dining room table, because I was listening to the feed from my phone.
3530000	3536000	So as I'm coming through the apartment complex, I hear, we need to drink the Patron, why is the Patron still closed?
3536000	3539000	I'm like, I have to grab the shot glasses as soon as I walk through the door. So I did.
3540000	3541000	He's so wonderful.
3541000	3543000	Allen wins a brownie. Here, have one.
3543000	3544000	Have a brownie.
3544000	3546000	Alright, anyway. Where was I? Oh yeah, GamerX.
3546000	3554000	So GamerX on Saturday night with Koopa Club and Game Buoy and my other show Hoard House and Game Bar and God knows who else.
3554000	3561000	We're going to be doing like a podcast panel and it's going to just be a big party and celebrating indie podcasting.
3561000	3562000	And you can do it too.
3562000	3566000	So yeah, check that out at GamerX and don't be shy.
3566000	3570000	Say hello, because we're all like regular people and we want to meet cool people.
3570000	3574000	And if you listen to this show and you made it this far, chances are you're a cool person.
3574000	3575000	Oh my God, Rob, I should cosplay.
3575000	3577000	What are you going to cosplay as?
3577000	3579000	I don't know, I'll probably do something.
3579000	3582000	You should go as your Animal Crossing lesbian.
3582000	3589000	No, because I figured if it's me, I have to do something annoying so I'm going to homestuck.
3589000	3596000	Alright. Anyhow, and also I want to put this out there.
3596000	3598000	So GamerX, Koopa Club, and one last thing.
3598000	3604000	If you were listening to the show last week, Bobby Blackwolf, our friend and pal who does the show before ours,
3604000	3612000	every Sunday night at 5 o'clock Pacific, 8 o'clock Eastern, his house was struck by lightning in the middle of our show last week.
3612000	3615000	And he lost a lot of video game consoles because of it.
3615000	3623000	I'm not going to repeat the whole thing because you can see his post that will catch you up on it on our vognetwork.com forums.
3623000	3626000	You can also listen to it on his show, kind of the wrap up and everything.
3626000	3629000	And it just, dude's been going through a lot this week.
3629000	3631000	And have lightning hit your fucking house?
3631000	3636000	I'm so glad that so many people were able to help him out.
3636000	3640000	However, I'm bringing it up because Bobby still needs help with one thing.
3640000	3644000	He has a Neo Geo AES US version.
3644000	3650000	And he's trying to get this repaired because it did suffer damage, but it is repairable.
3650000	3653000	He says he could do it himself, but he doesn't really have time.
3653000	3657000	So he would love to be able to ship this out, PayPal you money, have you ship it back.
3657000	3667000	I did suggest earlier, seeing if you could find out who it was that the guy who runs classic game room had an NBS, but the boards are similar.
3667000	3673000	Well, my hope is that one of our listeners, maybe who doesn't talk to us an awful lot, who just listens to this show.
3673000	3678000	My hope is somebody is sitting out there going, I do that, or like my friend owns a shop and they do that.
3678000	3681000	My hope is that somebody out there is listening that could do that.
3681000	3684000	Someone could be sleeping in a bed of AES boards.
3684000	3691000	Please contact us. You can fill out a form at vognetwork.com that will email Bobby directly.
3691000	3693000	You can email me and I'll get you in touch with Bobby.
3693000	3700000	We're super approachable. If you think you can help out with the Neo Geo AES situation, please, please, please reach out and get ahold of us.
3700000	3704000	Go on to vognetwork.com in the contact us page and send Bobby a quick letter.
3704000	3706000	He would deeply appreciate it.
3706000	3711000	We want our friend to get his Neo Geo back because how else is he going to play Fatal Fury Special?
3711000	3718000	He could come to my house. Bobby come to my house and bring all your games. We'll have a party.
3718000	3723000	And Bobby is also pointing out in chat room, bonus if you could also just mod it at the same time.
3723000	3727000	Because, you know, he might want to be able to play more games on that Neo Geo.
3727000	3736000	Well, you actually, I think it's actually more of a physical thing. You can switch the, there's a switch on the games themselves I think.
3736000	3739000	Because our, we can play, our Samurai Showdown 2 is Japanese.
3739000	3743000	I don't know shit about Neo Geos because I never owned one. I only played them in the arcade.
3743000	3747000	Unless it's to do modified MVS cartridges. I don't know.
3747000	3753000	I have a couple Neo Geo arcade boards. One is modded to play all region stuff.
3753000	3763000	And I have a 48-in-1 cart and I have a super gun that would plug into that that takes Neo Geo controllers.
3763000	3765000	There you go. There's a killer combo right there.
3765000	3769000	Alright, well I'm hoping that Bobby gets what he needs.
3769000	3775000	He also mentions the video mod that will put it over S-Video component and a BIOS mod to affect the lives and stuff.
3775000	3777000	Those are the types of mods he's looking for.
3777000	3786000	So, alright, good luck Bobby. We all are hoping to see you get through that and get your consoles even better than they were before lightning hit your house.
3786000	3792000	Alright, 7.15 and we have yet to hit the news. So let's jump into a busy week in gaming news.
3792000	3796000	Loki. And this bottle is still closed. I think we need to...
3796000	3798000	No it's not.
3798000	3800000	Yay. Alright.
3800000	3805000	Alright, so let's talk a little bit more about the Xbox One.
3805000	3817000	Of course one of the wonderful comments that come out before the whole 180 flop on the DRM stuff was them defending the $4.99 price tag.
3817000	3825000	Basically saying, and this is Don Mattrick of course, it's a lower number than some of the analysts had forecasted.
3825000	3828000	We're over delivering value against other choices.
3828000	3839000	I think consumers can get, or I think consumers can get, any modern product these days you're going to look at and $4.99 isn't a ridiculous price point.
3839000	3845000	We're delivering thousands of dollars of value to people so I think they're going to love it when they use it.
3845000	3856000	So he's basically comparing the $4.99 price point of the Xbox One as kind of like an iPad or something like that.
3856000	3864000	Which is a terrible comparison if you ask me because that's apples and oranges right there versus game consoles.
3864000	3871000	That's like saying, hey well you know what? This console only costs $4.99. I mean at least it's not a $30,000 car, right?
3871000	3874000	It's way cheaper.
3874000	3876000	Such a lightweight Rob.
3876000	3880000	Behind the scenes Rob has done, I have a voice now thanks to tequila.
3880000	3885000	Sorry Loki, I've totally not been paying attention because we all did a shot while you were reading that story.
3885000	3889000	And that burns so much. I've been doing gay flappy hands around the house.
3889000	3892000	Just flailing around everywhere.
3892000	3894000	It burns!
3894000	3897000	Oh my gosh, I'm warm.
3898000	3900000	I'm sitting here going.
3900000	3903000	I don't usually do shots of hard alcohol. This is Alan by the way.
3903000	3910000	I've never done a shot of tequila before. It's not as bad as the time I tried a shot of 151 which I was tricked into doing.
3910000	3912000	That's Patron.
3912000	3914000	Smooth tequila.
3914000	3917000	Rob totally got the shivers.
3917000	3920000	Patron is the only tequila that doesn't give me the shivers.
3920000	3924000	I was going to get a little glasses of orange juice in case anyone needs a chaser.
3924000	3927000	Because I don't know how much it burns. But that was actually very smooth.
3927000	3933000	Ah, Koopa Kid Jeremy in chat says, Vine it Rob. I wish I thought to do that. I guess I'll have to take another shot.
3933000	3936000	Yay, more shots.
3936000	3939000	Actually next up is Fireball because we've still got some of that.
3939000	3941000	Kind of scared about that one.
3941000	3944000	Alright, here we go. Anyway, where were we Loki?
3947000	3949000	Summarize for me real quick, sorry.
3949000	3954000	What up GS if I had a Neo Geo emulator. Yes, I do have an emulator for Neo Geo stuff.
3954000	3958000	No, I'm talking actually an MVS board. Like arcade Neo Geo boards.
3958000	3964000	I have two single slot arcade boards because I got one with my arcade cabinet.
3964000	3968000	And then another one because I don't know why. Because I need to buy another one I guess.
3968000	3975000	Alright, so basically they're defending the price of saying, oh it's a wonderful piece of electronics.
3975000	3980000	And so $4.99 is not that bad when you compare it to an iPad or something like that.
3980000	3985000	Which I say is a terrible comparison because they're very different devices.
3990000	3996000	Do you think this decision is going to single handedly damn the device? Because that's how you were talking earlier in the show.
3996000	4000000	It's definitely going to hurt it because basically now people are comparing the two consoles that are coming out.
4000000	4004000	You have one that spec wise is more powerful than the other one. That would be the PS4.
4004000	4007000	And it's cheaper. And doesn't require Kinect.
4007000	4014000	And I know for some people that the fact that you're not getting Kinect in there is kind of, they're looking at it.
4014000	4019000	Well you still have to buy the camera for the Playstation 4 and that's going to be an extra $60.
4019000	4023000	But a lot of people just don't give a shit about that camera and aren't planning on using it anyways.
4023000	4030000	Same as those people like myself that probably would get an Xbox One with the Kinect and not use the Kinect.
4030000	4035000	Unless it's a dancing game or something that really relies on it.
4035000	4046000	But you're not going to probably use it for Forza or Rise. I'm not going to go flailing my arms to do finishing moves in Rise or something.
4046000	4058000	So that's the thing. I think you would have an easier time selling it for $500 if they really showed why that Kinect is so important.
4058000	4067000	Just like how Nintendo did with the Wii showing why controlling the games like this is way better than controlling it with a controller.
4067000	4075000	You know what I would love from a perfectly selfish, I don't care about talking about this on the show because I totally just had a shot, type of standpoint.
4075000	4084000	Is that if this whole thing about Twitch integration and all that with the Kinect, wouldn't that be great if we could broadcast our show over the Xbox 360?
4084000	4093000	Or over the Xbox One, excuse me, with Kinect and that whole thing because of the Twitch integration? Could we do that?
4093000	4098000	The problem would be is you'd have to have some sort of gameplay on there. You can't just broadcast.
4098000	4099000	We used to do that.
4099000	4100000	I know.
4100000	4102000	When we had the larger studio.
4102000	4109000	You could technically do that because they have it where it's going to pick up audio from the game and it's going to pick up audio from you as well.
4109000	4118000	So you could probably rig it somehow to do that I guess. It would probably be easier to do that through a PC though.
4118000	4127000	But I guess you could point a camera at it. But you could kind of do that now with Skype or something I guess.
4127000	4130000	Point a camera at whatever we're doing.
4130000	4135000	But, I don't know. I just think it's ridiculous.
4135000	4139000	Okay, so other stuff. Let's talk about other things. We already mentioned, of course, Kinect's always required.
4139000	4148000	And they're saying that they're not planning on offering the system without the Kinect because it is a core part of the experience.
4148000	4152000	And because I think at this point it's too late to change any of that stuff.
4152000	4155000	I have bad news that's very important that we have to discuss.
4155000	4156000	What?
4156000	4162000	I was reminded by Alan that last time we were entertaining friends, we drank the rest of the Fireball.
4162000	4163000	Aww.
4163000	4167000	I'm very sorry, Jvmon. You came out here for nothing.
4167000	4169000	Well, time to go home.
4169000	4173000	I would like to say to Pod Culture, thanks.
4173000	4179000	I was like, we really finished that whole thing off, but yeah, I guess we did between the 500th episode and all that.
4179000	4180000	Sorry, Logi.
4180000	4185000	And also the other thing we should mention is nothing has changed as far as cloud computing.
4185000	4195000	So, whereas, yes, there will be games that can play offline, a lot of them will be online only because they require cloud computing.
4195000	4202000	And I think that also goes for the PlayStation 4 as well. They are able to use cloud computing for their titles as well.
4202000	4205000	So you could still have a SimCity-esque game on the 360?
4205000	4207000	Yes, you could have a lot of that.
4207000	4213000	I'm never going to stop calling it the 360. The 361, you're never going to...
4213000	4215000	You're still going to have games like SimCity that will...
4215000	4217000	You could, yeah.
4217000	4219000	Because we all see how well that went.
4219000	4221000	But I guess it still sold tons.
4221000	4229000	But here's the thing though, is if it's such a big deal, or if it's such a problem with those cloud computing things, people are going to be made aware of it.
4230000	4238000	People are going to say, hey, you guys, watch out because the next Forza or whatever is going to be something that requires cloud computing.
4238000	4243000	And if their servers go down, your cars are going to start murdering people or something, I don't know.
4243000	4250000	So I think that there's going to be a lot of awareness out there. And also, it's probably something that's on the box.
4250000	4252000	Lots of interesting stuff in chat.
4252000	4261000	ShadowNextGen says, the PlayStation camera is so screwed, developers won't be able to assume people have it and might get the same type of support PlayStation Move received.
4261000	4263000	That is to say, not much.
4263000	4270000	I'm with you and I'm not because I still feel like at E3, it looks like it's not getting any support anyway.
4270000	4278000	I get as far as the core elements, and I'm using my quotey fingers of the console when it comes to watching TV with friends and other stuff like it has it.
4278000	4288000	So you can assume that anybody with an Xbox One is going to have that, but I have yet to see how that really positively impacts games. I hope that's coming.
4288000	4298000	I don't think that's really a big deal though, because once again, like with Kinect even, even though we know that that system uses Kinect all the time,
4298000	4303000	they still have other ways to navigate that menu and stuff. It's not just with gestures.
4303000	4317000	So, what's the difference, I say? You're already implementing other control methods anyways, and most likely are probably going to stick to standardized controller usage and stuff,
4317000	4328000	and not just going to go all gung-ho with just the camera, but if they're already doing this, what's the big deal if it may not be in there? Just prepare for both scenarios.
4328000	4335000	I think camera usage is not a big deal. It's back when the 360 was, we can't assume that they have a hard drive was a problem.
4335000	4342000	So, just throwing it out there for the live listeners. Apparently our stream just keeps dropping, and again, our stream's drunk.
4342000	4345000	I don't know, oh god, it's doing it again. This is horrible.
4345000	4346000	The stream had some Patron.
4346000	4352000	I tried to just, I did a reconnect from scratch. It like dropped twice in a row there. I just did a reconnect from scratch.
4353000	4357000	I hope that keeps, I reset the internet before the show and everything. I don't get it.
4357000	4358000	I'm a witness.
4358000	4361000	Oh my god, it just went down again. This is horrible.
4361000	4363000	Our stream is a whore.
4363000	4366000	I don't know what to do, you guys. This is really bad.
4366000	4367000	Does she keep going down?
4367000	4368000	She does keep going down.
4368000	4376000	This is it, that's like three times in the scope of like one minute that it went down, and me drinking is not helping any.
4376000	4379000	So, I don't know.
4379000	4381000	Thanks NSA.
4381000	4383000	Everybody's got their...
4383000	4386000	Alan, you're not running torrents, are you?
4386000	4388000	He says no.
4388000	4389000	Alright.
4389000	4394000	Sorry guys, I wish we could fix this. I don't know what else to do.
4394000	4397000	I'm thinking.
4397000	4401000	I honestly can't afford any new computer parts right now.
4401000	4406000	I'm like, we could replace that router, because that one's really old.
4406000	4410000	But anyway, I guess this is a conversation best had off air, so.
4410000	4412000	Sorry guys.
4412000	4415000	Talk to me after.
4415000	4417000	Okay, yeah, that might be a good thing.
4417000	4426000	Alright, I'm sorry, but there's literally is not on our end. We're not running torrents or anything that would interrupt the stream. This is not reasonable.
4426000	4430000	Two, the other thing is, you know, notice we're not dropping out chat. It's not anything.
4430000	4433000	It's not us, it's the host.
4433000	4439000	Yeah, I hate to say it, we might need to think about another host. This keeps up.
4439000	4442000	But anyway, that's a conversation for another day.
4442000	4445000	Should we move on with the next story?
4445000	4446000	Yeah.
4446000	4451000	Alright, the free-to-play franchise out of Nintendo has been announced. It's Steel Diver.
4451000	4454000	Boo!
4454000	4457000	Dang, y'all haters. What's wrong with Steel Diver?
4457000	4459000	It's lame. It's a lame...
4459000	4462000	The game wasn't that popular at launch.
4462000	4466000	Granted, it's a first-party title, and it was kind of lame for the 3DS launch.
4466000	4473000	Now that they're coming out free-to-play, it's just like, cool, I'm sure people will download it to try it out, but it's just kind of like, eh, whatever.
4473000	4477000	I mean, it's not that big a deal. It's like, I don't know.
4477000	4484000	I can't really think of another lame Nintendo first-party title that was on the 3DS, and Steel Diver is pretty bad.
4484000	4488000	I mean, pilot wings would be kind of second, I don't know.
4488000	4493000	Do free-to-play Nintendogs or something like that. At least then you could charge DLC for like, callers and bullshit, hats.
4493000	4495000	Puppies for free.
4495000	4504000	Well, I kind of understand, though, that you want to dip your big toe into this big, scary new world which is free-to-play with a game that maybe not a lot of, you know, that doesn't...
4504000	4510000	Like, you don't want to fuck up Pokemon. Like, you're not going to take one of your big, big franchises into the free-to-play world.
4510000	4515000	I agree with something maybe like pilot wings or, you know, as much as my fanboy self would love it, something like F-Zero.
4515000	4522000	Going free-to-play would be great, you know, but I understand that Nintendo has to kind of test this first before they can really do it, you know?
4522000	4524000	Let's test it with crap.
4524000	4529000	Are they very lit? So is this coming to the Wii U or is this just 3DS still?
4529000	4536000	I believe this is still only 3DS. You got tank, tank, tank on the Wii U, although that's third party.
4536000	4541000	Yeah, that's still part of the whole Namco experimenting with free-to-play.
4541000	4543000	And it's more just a glorified demo, honestly.
4543000	4552000	Was Steel Diver that big of a 3DS property that was like, hey, out of all the things we can make a free-to-play game, how about Steel Diver?
4552000	4559000	No, and I think that's why it is this game. Because, you know, again, if it fucks up and crashes and burns horribly, oh well, it was Steel Diver.
4559000	4562000	So it's like, it's only Steel Diver's reputation that got shat on.
4562000	4568000	Exactly! And I think with a big thing like this, that's the type of game that you have to do it with, right?
4568000	4574000	Well, let me throw this out there, though, that Nintendo is open to the idea of other free-to-play games.
4574000	4580000	One of them mentioned by the lead designer named Katsuya Eguchi of Animal Crossing.
4580000	4583000	Possibly a free-to-play Animal Crossing.
4583000	4585000	That's a dangerous combination.
4585000	4588000	Which would have the dreaded microtransactions.
4588000	4591000	They have to just consider what would be free at the beginning.
4591000	4594000	Nintendo would have to have a business model that works. Here's the quote.
4594000	4602000	I think the main thing that we need to think about before even considering doing something like that is to determine what we're gonna make available from the beginning.
4602000	4605000	I think that's key in deciding whether we do something like that.
4605000	4613000	If I find a business model that works, however, that works for Nintendo and the end user, then I can't say free-to-play is something we wouldn't consider.
4613000	4618000	When you look at our main audience in Japan, they are definitely that audience that has smartphones.
4618000	4620000	They are women in their late teens and early twenties.
4620000	4624000	They are certainly paying free-to-play games on their smartphone.
4624000	4628000	Hmm. I'm sure a free-to-play Animal Crossing makes a lot of people happy.
4628000	4639000	But then again, I kind of like the pay-to-play Animal Crossing because I like the fact that one great thing about the new Animal Crossing is how new features kind of slowly roll out to your town.
4639000	4641000	I would really hate it if I had to pay for that.
4641000	4648000	So I would hope if they go to free-to-play route with a game like Animal Crossing that you can also just buy the game up front.
4648000	4652000	Like Killer Instinct on Xbox One we were talking about last week.
4652000	4656000	You know, it's getting a lot of shit for the free-to-play thing, but you can just buy it all at once too.
4656000	4659000	So either one of those would be great.
4659000	4661000	Moving on. Dark Sakura.
4661000	4675000	Well, going in the same vein as talking about Animal Crossing, there's something that Reggie said in a recent interview actually coming out of E3 that has a lot of people really perking up.
4675000	4682000	And that's that they were reviewing the Tomodachi Collection in Japan as far as localization.
4682000	4690000	In fact, he was talking about the sort of casual game where you could play it in short bursts and pick it up at any given time.
4690000	4695000	And that's why he's saying Tomodachi Collection, which anyone who doesn't know Tomodachi means friend.
4695000	4699000	You know, saying that that would be definitely a title to consider.
4699000	4710000	We're looking also into wanting to work with the retailers to make sure that they can provide the games in the best format possible.
4710000	4713000	So that's even including digital or physical.
4713000	4717000	Hmm. What do you think about these comments?
4717000	4721000	I would like to see Tomodachi Collection. I mean, if I had a Wii U I would be interested.
4721000	4726000	That was the same game that we were talking about the other week that had the bug where you could get gay married in it.
4726000	4727000	Yeah.
4727000	4730000	Yeah. It sounded interesting because especially with Animal Crossing being as big as it is.
4730000	4732000	I would have married my lesbian.
4732000	4734000	Who wouldn't?
4734000	4738000	I shipped my little kid and the lesbian.
4738000	4740000	Of course you did. Of course I did.
4740000	4742000	Have you seen Reggie's house in Animal Crossing, by the way?
4742000	4743000	No.
4743000	4746000	Comedy. Google it. It's funny.
4746000	4751000	So someone posted like a picture a while back of say, Oh, your house is top notch, blah, blah, blah.
4751000	4757000	And you go inside the person's house and saw skeletons and wallpaper that says, you will die.
4757000	4759000	That was the best.
4759000	4761000	That's awesome.
4761000	4769000	So, yeah, I mean, that was the big thing that I really wanted to point out with this article is it's got a lot of people jumping on it because people really want to see Tomodachi Collection come out over here.
4769000	4773000	And he's basically saying, yeah, we're considering it. It's a possibility.
4773000	4776000	All right. Loki, what do you have for us?
4776000	4782000	All right. Well, there's a rumor that they're going to bring game sharing to Steam.
4782000	4786000	And this is actually coming from the beta update files.
4786000	4799000	Someone has gone through there and apparently it makes reference to some different, I guess, pop up dialog boxes.
4799000	4815000	For example, it says shared game library and says, just so you know, your games are your games are currently in use by, you know, person that's borrowing and playing now will send whoever's borrowing a notice that it's time to quit.
4815000	4821000	And this shared game is currently unavailable. Please try again later or buy this game for your own library.
4821000	4835000	So it sounds like that, you know, if you have a library of a ton of games that you're just not playing, that other people can access those games and play them, which, like any Steam user, probably that library would be very expansive.
4835000	4847000	There's probably going to be you're probably going to be able to play any game you want on there because, I mean, shit, I have like 100 some games and I probably play about six of them.
4847000	4857000	So we'll see if this is something that actually implementing, you know, coming to a Steam beta near you, maybe.
4857000	4863000	I don't know. Do you think that maybe there's something that was being developed in response to Xbox one and now it's like, yeah, we'll do it anyway.
4863000	4869000	I want to say I heard the earlier rumors about this long before Xbox one, though, I think they could do something like this.
4869000	4885000	I think it would be interesting as reselling and you reselling your games, like, say, I don't know, through like Steam or how you can actually put it up on the marketplace and stuff like that and maybe have the original creator get a portion of the profit from it or something.
4885000	4896000	Maybe like they pay like you pay like a 10 percent fee or something and, you know, whoever buys it, you know, that fee goes to the person that put the game up there.
4896000	4898000	I think that'd be kind of cool.
4898000	4903000	All right. What we're going to do here before we get into the next story, we're going to take a quick break.
4903000	4909000	And what we're going to do for the live folks, we're going to reset our routers here in the house to hopefully get a better connection.
4909000	4913000	We're just going to try it because right now it's pretty miserable right now for the live listeners.
4913000	4919000	So we're going to go down one more time, live folks, but this one is planned and we'll be back in just a few minutes.
4920000	4923000	And for those of you guys listening on the podcast, you'll just hear that little musical interlude.
4923000	4926000	And we'll be right back with more news right after this.
4928000	4935000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, blood.
4935000	4941000	OK. We should be back with Orange Lounge Radio live here at The Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
4941000	4947000	Just a little bit of technical background. Maybe the podcast folks would be interested in this, too.
4947000	4954000	The way we have it set up here in the apartment is that we have the main router and the cable modem are in the office.
4954000	4961000	And then we actually have a second router out here in the living room, which everything is tied to, including the show computer.
4961000	4966000	What we've done is we've actually, to try and fix the problem, we have bypassed the living room router completely.
4966000	4971000	It's actually unplugged now. That was a crossover router. So it's still the same network.
4972000	4979000	Alan knows more about this stuff than I do. So we've actually taken the connection and plugged it into the main router directly.
4979000	4981000	I can give you a switch instead of just the router.
4981000	4983000	Is Alan here to translate?
4983000	4989000	I just want to let people know that the router that we have in the living room is in switch mode or bridge mode.
4989000	4993000	So it's not doing its own set of NAT addresses because that's bad.
4993000	4999000	So it's just bridging the cable into the office router. But now we're bypassing that altogether.
4999000	5002000	So hopefully that'll fix it.
5002000	5006000	Alright, well we'll see how long we can hold the connection. I've got the little clock here.
5006000	5008000	Otherwise I have like three switches at home.
5008000	5012000	Yeah, we might need to look into something like that. I mean, luckily the cord is long enough we can do that.
5012000	5019000	It's just really ugly and unattractive. But if this fixes the problem, then we'll just do this in future weeks and replace that router when we can.
5019000	5025000	But we'll see what happens. Let's just keep on moving forward with the show, even though I've been drinking.
5026000	5033000	And this next story would have driven me to drink anyway. It has to do with Miyamoto talking about the F-Zero franchise.
5033000	5035000	And it's not what we want to hear.
5035000	5037000	In an interview with IGN, he said, quote,
5037000	5040000	I certainly understand that people want a new F-Zero game.
5040000	5047000	I think where I struggle is that I don't really have a good idea for what's new that we could bring to F-Zero that would really turn it into a great game again.
5047000	5053000	Certainly I can see how people looking at Mario Kart 8 could see through the anti-gravity, a connection to F-Zero.
5053000	5057000	But I don't know at this point what direction we could go in with the new F-Zero.
5057000	5062000	You take F-Zero, GX, make it prettier, add more tracks, done.
5062000	5064000	Rainbow Road, Rainbow Road, Rainbow Road.
5064000	5067000	Right? That's Mario Kart, silly. Although, it would be neat to have a crossover.
5067000	5068000	Yes.
5068000	5069000	But, uh, yeah.
5069000	5080000	Well, no, that's actually what I was saying is put, like, the whole Rainbow Road thing, do, like, Rainbow Track or something, or Rainbow Space or whatever.
5080000	5085000	More of the same would actually be okay. I mean, we were just talking about Ridge Racer earlier.
5085000	5095000	GX was awesome. It was a fantastic game. There's not really much you can really improve on that, other than more tracks, because, you know, that's always good, and, you know, better visuals.
5095000	5100000	I mean, it could look really cool, like, almost like a Wipeout game or something like that, you know?
5100000	5104000	Just make it, think of what the visuals could look like. It'd be amazing.
5104000	5107000	Track Editor would be even better, too.
5107000	5115000	I, I forgot about this. BlackWolfInChat says, there was a Rainbow Road in F-Zero X. It was the exact same track as Mario Kart 64, just a lot faster.
5115000	5121000	I, I, you know, F-Zero X, I don't think I played nearly as much of, because I didn't have a 64 until late.
5121000	5124000	Uh, then I did the GameCube one, which was amazing.
5124000	5129000	Which, which base question, then, are we gonna see F-Zero GX tracks in Mario Kart 8?
5129000	5130000	Maybe.
5130000	5132000	Show me your moves.
5133000	5140000	Uh, DarkTetsuya says, oh, I don't know, how about online play? That would take Nintendo understanding online.
5140000	5142000	Nintendo doesn't admit online exists.
5142000	5144000	Which is a whole, whole nother Oprah.
5144000	5149000	The equivalent of Nintendo online is them sticking their fingers in their ears, closing their eyes, and going, lalalalala.
5149000	5153000	Alright, let's jam through these next few stories, because we're running long because of all these tech issues and everything else.
5153000	5155000	So, Dark Sakura, and then release dates.
5155000	5159000	Well, um, this is actually a story that came from my honey.
5159000	5175000	Uh, there was, I don't know if everyone remembers the big claim about, uh, for Madden, about, uh, Robin Antonic, who was, uh, one of the, uh, I believe one of the designers for the original Madden series, um, was owed quite a bit of royalties.
5175000	5183000	Well, they've, uh, basically stated that that case has not expired, and this guy still do a whole bunch of money.
5183000	5195000	I filed the original suit in 2011, um, that claimed that EA breached contract signed in 1986 for royalties on derivative versions of the game, and they're basically saying, nope, you still owe you money.
5195000	5198000	They gotta pay. Oopsie, eh, blah.
5200000	5204000	So, he owes money. He's owed money. EA has to suck it.
5205000	5215000	Well, cool, at least, uh, we'll see that trial go. I wonder if that could mean anything to the Madden NFL franchises. They'll just say, you know, we're gonna change the name or something.
5215000	5217000	They'll have to do whatever-
5217000	5218000	Like Madden's relevant.
5218000	5222000	Yeah. John matters. They'll do whatever they have to do to save it. We'll see.
5222000	5224000	EA football, 2014.
5225000	5227000	Alright, release dates. Loki.
5228000	5238000	This week is actually some decent stuff coming out. Game of Wario was today on the Wii U. This week, Deadpool, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
5238000	5239000	I need this game.
5239000	5250000	Yes, Deadpool will be coming out. Also, uh, what else was there? There was the Company of Heroes 2 on PC. Muramasa Rebirth on the Vita.
5251000	5260000	You get an expansion for The Sims 3 Island Paradise. Also, Best of PlayStation Network Volume 1 on PS3.
5260000	5271000	So, disc-based release was at Fat Princess, Sound Shapes, and I don't remember the other two games in there, but it looked pretty cool.
5272000	5287000	PC, Leisure Suit Larry Reloaded, Vita and 3DS, Lego Legends of Chima, LaValle's Journey, Project X Zone on the 3DS, which is pretty awesome.
5287000	5292000	I mean, that's that Namco Sega Atlas crossover, I want to say.
5293000	5303000	And then, also this week, of course, a game I'm actually going to try to check out, Ride the Hell Retribution on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360.
5303000	5313000	It's a game from Deep Silver, a biker sandbox game set in the 70s. It's like The Lost and the Damned all over again. That's it.
5313000	5321000	Alright, I am traveling over to Japan right now. Let's get on a plane. Let's go. Check out the release dates over there.
5321000	5329000	And, um, going, excuse me, tequila burp. Alright, let's start with the PlayStation.
5329000	5330000	You had one shot.
5330000	5341000	I know, right? I am a sad lightweight. I tried to tell you this earlier, right? Like, one Long Island Iced Tea and I'm, like, taking my top off. I swear, it's horrific.
5341000	5349000	Alright, PlayStation 3 over in Japan. Atler, Escha, and Laji, Tasogari, Nosora, Norenken, Jusushi.
5349000	5354000	I don't know if that's related to the Atler collection we're getting here in the US very soon, probably.
5354000	5359000	Also on the PlayStation 3 this week, June 27th. There's a lot of shit this week, you guys.
5359000	5364000	Date A Live skin seal set for PlayStation 3. What?
5365000	5371000	Oh, a skin seal. That's just controller stuff. You have to, it sounds a little dirty when you hear that, though.
5371000	5373000	I thought it was, like, another porn title.
5373000	5383000	Alright. No, a date, the game is Date A Live, Rine Utopia comes out, and it's got school girls on the cover. You know what that means.
5383000	5384000	Dating sim.
5384000	5386000	Dating sim. Uh oh.
5386000	5387000	She's holding her boobies.
5387000	5392000	Uh oh, that one's, oh my, that one is, that one is sucking on a creamsicle.
5392000	5393000	Nice.
5393000	5395000	She's, she's like 16, perv.
5395000	5398000	Hey, she's just drawn that way.
5398000	5405000	Gundam Breaker. Memories off 6 complete. The other game was panties off 6 complete. This is memories off 6 complete.
5405000	5411000	And memories off Yubikiri no Kyoku. Also Biohazard 5, that's Resident Evil.
5411000	5416000	AEN Revival selection, HD remaster twin pack. I believe that's a price reduction.
5416000	5421000	The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim gets a price reduction over there as well.
5421000	5424000	Tachishio Love Application.
5424000	5429000	What the fuck is wrong with you guys over there and your games this week? You bunch of pervs.
5429000	5433000	This one features ladies in swimming suits who are also underage.
5433000	5434000	And this one-
5434000	5436000	It sounds, uh, seasonally appropriate.
5436000	5440000	This one has a cattail, and you can see her panties. Look at that. This is, this is-
5440000	5442000	Upskirt.
5442000	5444000	And now she has a gun.
5444000	5446000	Oh, don't-
5446000	5447000	Hmm.
5447000	5448000	Hey.
5448000	5449000	Wow, she's a-
5449000	5450000	That was a total camel toe.
5450000	5452000	Alright.
5452000	5458000	Yeah, I don't know what to think about Playstation 3 releases in Japan this week, especially after I've had a whopping shot.
5458000	5459000	Um.
5459000	5461000	This is funny. Rob's just had a double.
5461000	5463000	I have had two shots.
5463000	5465000	I had three.
5465000	5467000	Hello.
5467000	5468000	I had-
5468000	5470000	The only reason I'm stopping at two is because I got to drive.
5470000	5472000	I had a gallbladder removed.
5472000	5480000	Alright. On the Xbox 360, Grand Theft Auto 4, the complete edition, as well as Skyrim, uh, those are all getting price reductions.
5480000	5485000	A new game, Sniper Ghost Warrior 2, uh, comes out this week on the Xbox 360.
5485000	5489000	So, hey, how about it for 360 releases in Japan?
5489000	5493000	It's, it's about time that Japan, you know, can shoot Hitler in the balls.
5493000	5494000	On the Playstation Vita-
5494000	5498000	Well, we haven't had a Japanese game kill Hitler since, what, Bionic Commando?
5498000	5501000	On the Playstation Vita, Tukaidan comes out this week.
5501000	5511000	Uh, also Sengoku Hime 2, Tenka Hato, Shishino Keishusha comes out in regular and luxury limited edition this week.
5511000	5513000	And what is this game?
5513000	5516000	Again, ladies that look like they're dressed for the military this time.
5516000	5518000	I swear, any fetish you got, they got it this week.
5518000	5520000	It's probably high school something.
5520000	5522000	In the military?
5522000	5523000	I don't know.
5523000	5530000	3DS this week, uh, Starry Sky in summer 3D, and Digimon World, redigitize, decode.
5530000	5532000	Digimon game!
5532000	5533000	Yay!
5533000	5534000	In case you were worried that Digimon-
5534000	5536000	Are we the Digimon fans in the room or what?
5536000	5538000	You're the Digimon fans on the planet, congratulations.
5538000	5540000	Hey!
5542000	5543000	Alright, let's travel to Europe.
5543000	5547000	For the record, Digimon Zero 2 was the best of the Digimon series, just sayin'.
5547000	5549000	Digimon greater than Pokemon, just sayin'.
5549000	5550000	Totally greater than.
5550000	5551000	Ugh, sacrilege.
5551000	5552000	Ugh!
5552000	5556000	So, um, on June 25th we have Company of Heroes 2 on PC.
5556000	5563000	And on the 20th we have Dark for PC, Deadpool on Xbox 360, PS3, and PC.
5563000	5569000	We have Game & Wario on the Wii U, and Ride to Hell, Xbox 360, PS3, and PC.
5569000	5572000	And hopefully it's better than Drag Me to Hell, because that movie was shit.
5574000	5576000	Tiara made me see that movie.
5576000	5577000	Damn you, Tiara.
5577000	5579000	It was- I didn't pay for it, so we'll neither to cheat, but-
5579000	5580000	Oh, okay, well thank you, Tiara.
5580000	5584000	It was still an awful movie, and I love Sam Raimi, and that was a bad movie.
5584000	5587000	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.
5587000	5588000	Loki.
5588000	5589000	Alright.
5589000	5595000	Um, so let's talk a little bit about bad firmware, and nobody likes bad firmware.
5595000	5600000	Especially bad firmware that's pushed out on the PlayStation 3 that kind of bricks consoles.
5600000	5608000	Um, thankfully there is a way to fix your console, because I guess somehow it removed your cross-media bar
5608000	5609000	or something like that.
5609000	5610000	That's a problem.
5610000	5611000	No menu.
5611000	5616000	Um, and you can actually boot your console into a recovery mode or debug mode or something,
5616000	5624000	and allow you to re-download the update when it is released again on Thursday, on June 27th.
5624000	5629000	And I guess it's a small number of PS3s that are affected by it, but any number is still bad.
5630000	5638000	Um, and if you haven't updated your console like myself, it's good to note that they have
5638000	5645000	taken off the bad firmware off the network right now until the update is released, because
5645000	5649000	I just updated to 4.41, so.
5649000	5652000	Uh, that sucks.
5652000	5655000	Thankfully, though, it doesn't sound like there's any permanent damage.
5655000	5659000	It's just a minor, week-long inconvenience.
5661000	5663000	Blesses of you.
5666000	5670000	Well, I have not turned on my PlayStation 30, or 3, my PlayStation 30.
5670000	5672000	Rob our speech goods.
5672000	5675000	I was talking in chat, I was giving Drewnami a hard time, because I said,
5675000	5678000	God, he's gotta be pushing 30, and he's like, fuck you, I'm 28.
5678000	5679000	One shot at tequila.
5679000	5683000	I remember, I remember Drewnami being our young Republican.
5683000	5684000	Mhm.
5684000	5687000	Oh, how things have changed.
5687000	5688000	Mhm.
5688000	5694000	Alright, moving on to a story about Final Fantasy XII, which was a really overlooked
5694000	5695000	Final Fantasy game.
5695000	5696000	I overlooked it.
5696000	5697000	It just came out at a bad time.
5697000	5699000	I own it, and I overlooked it.
5699000	5702000	It came out at a time when a lot of people had moved on to other consoles.
5702000	5704000	Well, this is really exciting news.
5704000	5709000	In an interview with the site, RPG site, it's a very descriptive name, you know what you're
5709000	5710000	gonna get when you go there.
5710000	5718000	Producer Yoshinori Kitase, who's producing Final Fantasy X and X-2 HD, was asked about,
5718000	5723000	what about other games coming to these HD?
5723000	5728000	And, quote, we'll have to wait and see if these remasters are going to be successful first.
5728000	5733000	If they do well, I think this will pave the way for more of the previous games to be remade
5733000	5735000	in an HD sort of quality.
5735000	5739000	I mean, if we had to single out one of the vast number of Final Fantasy titles which
5739000	5743000	we could make in HD, it would have to be Final Fantasy XII.
5743000	5744000	Yes!
5744000	5746000	Bothier and Fran in HD.
5746000	5747000	Yes!
5747000	5748000	Can't wait.
5748000	5749000	There's VII, hello.
5749000	5754000	And yeah, VII wasn't the greatest game, but Vincent, hello.
5754000	5756000	You just want Ares to die.
5756000	5758000	I want Aerith to die repeatedly.
5758000	5760000	1080p Aerith death.
5760000	5762000	1080p Aerith death, oh my god.
5763000	5766000	It would have to have, like, blood particle physics and everything.
5766000	5768000	That's the problem though with bringing VII.
5768000	5773000	VII, it was so low poly that, you know, to up-res it's gonna look like crap.
5773000	5777000	And also, you know, with, you know, I think these PlayStation 2 games are a little easier
5777000	5782000	to do the HD remakes, plus they've got, you know, PlayStation 2 emulation engines already
5782000	5786000	built that they can just dump it in, up-res the assets, and they're done.
5786000	5787000	I hope they do it.
5787000	5788000	High-res Aerith.
5788000	5790000	I would really love XII in HD.
5790000	5791000	I really hope they do it.
5791000	5793000	High-res Aerith death.
5793000	5794000	All right.
5794000	5796000	And high-res Vincent, hello.
5796000	5798000	Are you done salivating over there?
5798000	5801000	Because it's time to go back when games weren't in HD.
5801000	5802000	God dammit.
5802000	5806000	Although, well, actually this one kind of did do an HD thing later.
5806000	5807000	Yeah, it did.
5807000	5811000	Anyway, we're gonna look back at the classic-ness of this upcoming game here.
5811000	5815000	In the segment we call Classic Game of the Week, where Dark Soccer's gonna jump into the gaming vault
5815000	5819000	and find a game that she thinks, hey, you should be playing this game.
5819000	5821000	Get off my lawn and play this game.
5821000	5826000	And for our 11th birthday, Dark Soccer has picked a game that's about 11 years old.
5826000	5827000	Pretty much.
5827000	5831000	But it's one that's very fond, I think a good choice to mark our 11th birthday.
5831000	5832000	Yep.
5832000	5833000	So you wanna know what it is, everyone?
5833000	5834000	Of course I do.
5834000	5835000	Res, motherfuckers.
5835000	5837000	Why couldn't I pick Res?
5837000	5841000	I haven't done Res the entire 11 damn years of the show.
5841000	5842000	I picked Res tonight.
5842000	5845000	And I think I put it up on a boss battle on the last-
5845000	5850000	Mostly because Res wasn't really an old game until now.
5850000	5855000	Well, you know, I was going with Dreamcast era and yet I didn't have a PS2 re-release.
5855000	5863000	So anyway, Res came up when it was developed as under the codenames AK Project, Project Eden, and Vibes.
5863000	5868000	It's a rail shooter that came out by Sega in 2001 for Dreamcast and PS2
5868000	5873000	and it had a European Dreamcast and a US PS2 release in 2002.
5874000	5881000	The game was the dream child of one Tetsuya Mizuguchi and you know what?
5881000	5883000	Who I still fanboy over.
5883000	5889000	Like, if I fanboy over anybody, it's Mizuguchi and it's- I even defended 99 Nights, y'all.
5889000	5891000	He mentioned his name, I need new one of these, okay?
5891000	5892000	Yeah.
5893000	5894000	Excuse me.
5894000	5901000	And there is a prequel that came out, of course, called Child of Eden, which comes from the name Project Eden that they have.
5901000	5911000	So anyway, it's sort of a super futuristic network called the K Project and you have to stop an AI called Eden.
5913000	5915000	Excuse me, I'm sorry guys, I'm so sick.
5915000	5923000	So basically you are a hacker trying to basically reboot Eden and destroy viruses and firewalls.
5923000	5927000	And it's basically music, lights, and a vibrator.
5927000	5929000	Or does it get much better than that?
5929000	5930000	Excuse me.
5931000	5935000	And of course, like any tech person would know, to fix a problem you have to reboot.
5936000	5938000	Do you want me to take over? Are you okay?
5938000	5940000	Yeah, if you don't mind just for a second.
5940000	5941000	Okay.
5941000	5950000	Hold on, I wasn't prepared to talk about Rez, but I could just wing it a little bit while Dark Sakura's having a thing there.
5950000	5951000	Okay.
5951000	5954000	So in the game, of course, it's a rail shooter, right?
5954000	5958000	You play the role of an avatar on the screen and so it's a shooter on rails.
5958000	5961000	So fable the journey, not on rails.
5961000	5963000	Rez on rails.
5963000	5970000	You lock onto the different enemies on the screen and you can lock onto up to eight enemies with what they call the reticule.
5970000	5974000	Once you release the lock on button, you fire your shots all over.
5974000	5981000	And if you don't hit an enemy or projectile, you may actually collide, which will cause your evolution bar to go down by one.
5981000	5984000	And it'll actually change the way your avatar looks like.
5984000	5989000	If the avatar gets to the lowest possible level and you get hit again, you die.
5989000	5990000	Dead.
5990000	5991000	Oh, you're back.
5991000	5992000	Good day, sir.
5992000	5993000	All right.
5993000	5994000	I had to go pull my nose because it's the whole problem.
5994000	5995000	Are you going to keep going or?
5995000	5996000	Yeah, I'm fine.
5996000	5997000	Okay.
5997000	5998000	What about the overdrive though, Rob?
5998000	5999000	What about it?
5999000	6003000	Well, you can get power-ups as you go, like you were talking about the evolution bar.
6003000	6006000	And you can get another item that triggers an overdrive.
6006000	6011000	So basically it's a huge, it's basically like the Rez version of the super zapper from Tempest.
6011000	6014000	It just kills everything in a big shower of everything.
6014000	6019000	And also, um, you get like bonus items for your score and everything.
6019000	6024000	So basically you have five areas and the first four are ten subsections of the boss battle.
6024000	6030000	And the final one is like a boss rush within you battle Eden for the final one.
6030000	6035000	Um, it has no sound effects or spoken dialogue.
6035000	6036000	It's all music.
6036000	6037000	Everything is music.
6038000	6045000	So for being in a rail shooter, this one's also been lumped in, in the music game genre.
6045000	6049000	And then that brings me to the trance vibrator.
6049000	6052000	Oh, what should I say?
6052000	6054000	Buzz.
6054000	6062000	There's the funniest video of a guy and his girlfriend playing Rez, which basically him playing Rez and her playing with vibrator.
6062000	6067000	Um, it was, um, called the trance vibrator.
6067000	6072000	It pulses with the music and it would be something that you would put in your pocket or sit on.
6072000	6077000	It had a power in your butt.
6077000	6079000	It came with a pouch.
6079000	6082000	You could put it in to protect it.
6082000	6085000	Not unlike the we condom.
6085000	6089000	So the trans vibrator came with a condom pretty much.
6089000	6095000	It's actually a fabric bag, but basically it would vibrate in time with the music.
6095000	6098000	However, the dual shock was actually supposed to be stronger than that.
6098000	6106000	I think a screw attack brings it as the number one best gaming peripheral ever.
6106000	6113000	And basically there were other versions of it that you could buy an aftermarket.
6114000	6119000	It was also compatible with Space Channel 5 Part 2 and the Japanese version of Disaster Report.
6119000	6123000	I had no idea that you could use the trance vibrator with Space Channel 5 Part 2 as well.
6123000	6125000	That's amazing.
6125000	6128000	So you could put Ulala in your butt.
6128000	6132000	People have reverse engineered it to have it work on a PC.
6132000	6138000	And they've gotten this to work in Japan where there is a driver out for XP and Windows 2000.
6138000	6142000	There's also a driver that works for Linux kernel.
6142000	6150000	The Xbox 360 version that came out recently, the Res HD, basically will have other controllers doing the trance vibration function.
6150000	6155000	Can I say that when I got Res HD on 360, I actually did that with the controller.
6155000	6156000	You actually put a controller in your pants?
6156000	6157000	No, I did not.
6157000	6163000	But I did the thing that they suggested where you put one on your back and you lean against the chair and have that on your back.
6163000	6167000	And then I think it said to put the other one not on your butt.
6167000	6169000	That joke's over.
6169000	6171000	I think you put the other one on your arms.
6171000	6172000	I don't remember where they were.
6172000	6173000	I put it in my bra.
6173000	6174000	In your bra?
6174000	6176000	But it was weird.
6176000	6178000	But fun.
6178000	6181000	Well, speaking of...
6181000	6184000	And consensual. Most importantly, it was consensual.
6184000	6186000	Well, actually, this is an interesting thing.
6186000	6191000	The game itself won an award from the Agency for Cultural Affairs Media Art Festival in Japan.
6191000	6199000	It was also one of the Dreamcast games that was chosen to be at the Smithsonian American Art Museum 2012 edition, the art of video games.
6199000	6203000	If only they knew that you could put that trans vibrator in your butt, then I don't think it would be at the Smithsonian.
6203000	6205000	Rob!
6205000	6207000	Oh my god, Rob.
6207000	6219000	Anyway, Res HD came out for Xbox Live Arcade as Rob was talking about his exploits with the trans vibrator controller and his pants.
6219000	6223000	My back. When did I start wearing pants on my back, Jamie?
6223000	6226000	My back. He means butt.
6226000	6229000	Don't be a bitch.
6229000	6232000	After five minutes, I was like, let's go.
6232000	6239000	Anyway, basically, Mizuguchi says it's 100% the same as the Dreamcast version.
6239000	6248000	And to do a new version, he would actually have to get the license from Sega because he actually did it as a contractor.
6248000	6255000	There were no plans for 360-compatible trans vibrator peripheral because everyone would put it in their butt.
6256000	6262000	Or cooch, or cooch. Not everyone is into butt play.
6262000	6270000	So, yeah, Res HD came out on January 30th, 2008, and it was included with the Cube Company.
6270000	6273000	You could just rest it there on your hoo-ha, and I'm sure it would be just a good old time.
6273000	6274000	You know what, Rob?
6274000	6275000	What?
6275000	6280000	We don't discuss my hoo-ha on the show.
6280000	6285000	Eleven episodes, and my hoo-ha has yet to have any bearing on any video game.
6285000	6287000	Eleven episodes? How much have you had to drink?
6287000	6288000	Five hundred and nine.
6288000	6290000	I've had two shots, okay?
6290000	6291000	Yeah.
6291000	6295000	Rob's over here going, whoa, I'm drunk, and I'm like, oh, I just felt it.
6295000	6297000	Now you're feeling it in your hoo-ha.
6297000	6301000	You know what, it takes a lot more than two shots of tequila for me to feel it in my hoo-ha, okay?
6301000	6305000	To register participation for this week's episode, use the password hoo-ha.
6305000	6307000	Ignore that. Ignore that. It's not hoo-ha.
6307000	6308000	That's not the true word.
6308000	6313000	But anyway, the Cubes compilation came out with Luminous Live and Every Extent Extra Extreme.
6313000	6319000	And Mizuguchi was saying that there's no reason to not provide it on other platforms other than the Xbox 360.
6319000	6325000	And it was voted the 13th best Xbox Live arcade game of all time by IGN in 2010.
6325000	6329000	Other games that have come out that are related were Audio Surf.
6329000	6332000	Child of Eden, as I said, was a spiritual successor.
6333000	6337000	There's Is, I guess it's how it's pronounced, and Vibribin.
6337000	6343000	Vibribin is crack, and if you don't know about it, tune in to a bajillion episodes ago, where I talked about it.
6343000	6345000	What was it, like five years ago that brought up Vibribin?
6345000	6347000	Yeah, Vibribin's old.
6347000	6349000	Yeah, it's so sister.
6349000	6351000	Everything I talk about's old.
6352000	6354000	It has nothing to do with my hoo-ha.
6357000	6361000	Rob, for being, I'm almost questioning your sexuality now.
6363000	6365000	He turns straight when he gets drunk. It's fine.
6365000	6367000	I've seen him kiss a girl when he was drunk.
6367000	6371000	Last week on Orange Lounge Radio, it has nothing to do with my hoo-ha!
6373000	6375000	Damn right, lady. All right.
6375000	6377000	Rob's actually kind of pink in the face. It's adorable.
6377000	6380000	You know us here at Microsoft think that's a great catchphrase.
6381000	6383000	Rob, you had a double shot.
6383000	6385000	Okay, yeah. To be fair, I had a double shot.
6385000	6389000	You had a double shot. I had a single, and then I had another single dumped in my orange juice.
6389000	6391000	Thank you, Alan!
6393000	6396000	We are, for the back here, very muted.
6396000	6398000	You're welcome.
6398000	6399000	All right.
6399000	6402000	We are not, we are not doing, what's the word?
6402000	6404000	Just think about all those live listeners.
6404000	6407000	We are not hashtagging hoo-ha for the chat.
6407000	6410000	Just think of all the live listeners that left early because they were like,
6410000	6413000	fuck it, I can't stand these connection problems and left.
6413000	6415000	They're missing the hoo-ha chat.
6416000	6418000	Well, it was a big change from our dick and fart jokes.
6418000	6421000	Now it's hoo-ha and queef jokes.
6421000	6423000	Wait, who started the queef jokes?
6423000	6425000	There's a queef joke?
6425000	6428000	I'm trying to think of other things that go with dick and fart.
6428000	6432000	If dick and fart would be the male version, then hoo-ha and queef would be the male version.
6432000	6435000	Hey, you know what? It's all about gender equality, so.
6435000	6438000	I had an equal opportunity stinker.
6440000	6442000	Oh my God.
6444000	6447000	And that's the classic game of the week. Res.
6447000	6449000	You want to know what I just remembered, Rob?
6449000	6451000	I also had a shot of Robitussin before I left for the show.
6451000	6453000	Are you going to be okay to drive home?
6453000	6455000	It's the tussin that does it.
6455000	6457000	It's the tussin and tequila.
6457000	6459000	It wasn't the Patron that did it.
6459000	6461000	It was the Robitussin.
6461000	6462000	I call it test tequila.
6462000	6463000	There it is.
6463000	6465000	I was like, is that bottle gone?
6465000	6467000	That bottle's halfway gone.
6467000	6468000	I'm up to my fourth shot.
6468000	6471000	It took six years for me to finish mine that you got me when I turned 30.
6472000	6473000	Okay?
6474000	6476000	It's not Queef Latifah.
6477000	6479000	There it is, your classic.
6480000	6481000	Your classic.
6482000	6483000	Can I finish?
6483000	6484000	Bite me.
6484000	6485000	Can I finish? Can I finish?
6485000	6486000	No.
6486000	6488000	That's your classic game of the week.
6488000	6491000	Use this dark sacra for Orange Lodge Radio and suck it.
6494000	6499000	Res, your classic game of the week featuring the trans vibrator on Yahuah.
6499000	6500000	Alright.
6501000	6503000	That does it for part A.
6503000	6507000	But stay tuned because there's plenty more to come with rapid fire news,
6507000	6512000	the frugal question of the week, mailbag, FUs of the week, and who knows what.
6512000	6514000	O.L.R. is drunk. Go home.
6515000	6516000	Oh lordy.
6516000	6517000	Alright, stay tuned guys.
6517000	6520000	We'll be back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6527000	6528000	Hi there. This is Captain Spike.
6528000	6529000	And First Mate Slagkick.
6529000	6531000	From Gamebooey.org.
6531000	6532000	Gamebooey.org.
6532000	6536000	And you're participating with Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.
6536000	6539000	And we want to use our voice to tell you support indie broadcasting
6539000	6542000	and congratulations to Orange Lounge Radio on 11 wonderful years.
6542000	6543000	Congratulations.
6543000	6544000	Congratulations.
6544000	6546000	Congratulations.
6547000	6549000	Congratulations.
6549000	6552000	Oh my god. We're gonna see.
6552000	6554000	Yeah, isn't First Mate Slagkick here next week?
6554000	6555000	I think so.
6555000	6556000	He better be.
6556000	6558000	Oh my god, I got sent a picture of a ferret.
6559000	6562000	That is the cutest thing I've seen all day.
6562000	6567000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio Part B.
6567000	6569000	Our 11th anniversary episode.
6569000	6571000	It's been a very weird night so far.
6571000	6575000	Obviously, with the live feed, it was going up and down in Part A.
6575000	6578000	We think we fixed it. Knock on wood, hopefully.
6578000	6580000	And then we were having all those problems.
6580000	6582000	Then Jamie started talking about her hoo-ha.
6582000	6585000	You started talking about my hoo-ha. Hello.
6585000	6587000	It was Jamie's hoo-ha that caused the feed to go down.
6587000	6589000	It got started on your ass.
6590000	6592000	Hold on, I gotta pour myself another shot.
6592000	6594000	Oh, you're gonna have another shot?
6594000	6595000	I'm from New York.
6595000	6596000	We get drunk.
6596000	6597000	It's not fair. I want another one.
6597000	6599000	I have a double shot here of Patron.
6599000	6601000	Rob, can I sleep on your couch?
6601000	6603000	I gotta get up at 6.30. That's the only thing I'm saying.
6603000	6606000	Although Alan will be here later, so I guess.
6606000	6607000	No, I can't.
6607000	6609000	Okay, good. Just be responsible.
6609000	6610000	Alright.
6610000	6611000	Fuck that.
6611000	6613000	Here we go. Heads up. Happy 11 years.
6613000	6614000	Yay.
6614000	6616000	Alright. And one, two, three.
6620000	6621000	Oh, I forgot to vine it.
6621000	6623000	Oh, Rob is so funny. He's just doing the complete-
6623000	6625000	He's dying right now.
6625000	6626000	Oh my God.
6627000	6628000	Rob has to run around the room-
6628000	6629000	It doesn't even burn.
6629000	6632000	I know, but it's that warmth is so freaky to me.
6632000	6634000	Rob has to run around the room and do flappy hands.
6634000	6637000	I'm trying to contain it to my chair right now. I'm fine.
6637000	6639000	What were you talking about during the commercial?
6639000	6640000	I wanna talk about it on air. Oh.
6640000	6641000	We were talking about-
6641000	6642000	Butt.
6642000	6643000	No, we were not talking about-
6643000	6645000	My butt on break, Dark Sakura. Stop being a potty mouth.
6645000	6646000	Alright.
6646000	6648000	I don't know. I wasn't here. I was in the bathroom.
6648000	6652000	We were talking about restaurants that you can't eat back east, right?
6652000	6655000	So earlier, before the show, we had to go get food.
6655000	6656000	We went to Jack in the Box, which-
6656000	6658000	You don't have Jack in the Box back east?
6658000	6660000	No, not- at least not in New York.
6660000	6662000	I don't know about like down south on the east coast,
6662000	6664000	but in New York, there's no Jack in the Box.
6664000	6666000	In my experience in the south, there was one Jack in the Box.
6666000	6669000	It was in my birth town of Dothan, Alabama,
6669000	6671000	and it got closed for food poisoning.
6671000	6674000	And what were you excited about to find at Jack in the Box?
6674000	6675000	Breakfast all day.
6675000	6679000	It's pretty amazing. I do like Jack in the Box.
6679000	6680000	They have a diverse menu.
6680000	6681000	But you know what they don't have out here?
6681000	6682000	Huh?
6682000	6684000	Hardee's. And Carl's Jr. is not the same.
6684000	6685000	Sorta is, though.
6685000	6686000	No, not really.
6686000	6687000	Alright, well-
6687000	6690000	You cannot get buttermilk biscuits at our fried chicken.
6690000	6693000	Dunkin' Donuts is what I want out here. We don't have Dunkin' Donuts here.
6693000	6694000	I want Waffle House.
6694000	6697000	You can have Dunkin' Donuts. I'll take back Jack in the Box.
6697000	6699000	I like Jack in the Box, though. You can have-
6699000	6700000	They're gonna deep fry their tacos.
6700000	6701000	They're gonna deep fry their tacos.
6701000	6704000	I think In-N-Out is a little bit overrated, so you can have In-N-Out.
6704000	6706000	How gladly say In-N-Out.
6706000	6707000	I want Waffle House.
6707000	6711000	And I'm just noticing it's taken, what, Part B for us to start talking about food?
6711000	6713000	And, and, and. You know what else I want from back east?
6713000	6716000	It's because we talked about liquor in Part A, and then you know what?
6716000	6717000	I want Crystal's.
6717000	6718000	Huh?
6718000	6719000	Because of the Corn Pots.
6719000	6720000	I don't even know what that is.
6720000	6723000	Crystal's is kinda like White Castle-sized hamburgers.
6723000	6726000	They're really teeny. You get like, you know, four for something.
6726000	6730000	But you can also get corn, uh, these little tiny corn dogs that are called Corn Pups.
6730000	6732000	And they're so good. I don't know why-
6732000	6735000	Doesn't A&W have those little Corn Pups? I think they do.
6735000	6737000	I don't know. I haven't been to A&W in forever, but-
6737000	6738000	Yeah.
6738000	6740000	Well, they're all A&W KFCs now. They're all hybrid.
6740000	6742000	You know what made me super happy?
6742000	6747000	And it's a totally southern thing, but going to a gas station and getting fried chicken liver.
6747000	6752000	Uh, in my time back east, when I think of gas stations, I think of Wawa.
6752000	6756000	That's- that's- that's a gas- well, the convenience- huge convenience stores, anyway.
6756000	6760000	But anyway, I guess that's for another, uh, another night.
6760000	6763000	Uh, we gotta get back into video games. This is already a long show.
6763000	6765000	Uh, internet problems aside.
6765000	6767000	So, rapid fire news time. Loki!
6767000	6770000	Fez is not coming to the Xbox.
6770000	6775000	Uh, because apparently they don't like the lack of indie support.
6775000	6781000	Also, basically saying, you know, um, they're not sure if they're gonna come to the PlayStation 4.
6781000	6785000	Although, it's tempting. It's still too early to tell how everything's going to unfold.
6785000	6789000	But, their hearts definitely seem to be in the right place.
6789000	6793000	Uh, whether or not I would- would develop for it comes down to how the PlayStation platform-
6793000	6795000	or how the platform holder treats me.
6795000	6799000	With Microsoft, they made it painfully clear they don't want my ilk on their platform.
6799000	6802000	I can't even self-publish there, whereas PS4, I can.
6802000	6804000	That's simple. Or, it's that simple.
6804000	6807000	Microsoft won't let me develop for their console, but Sony will.
6808000	6815000	So, I guess we just won't see Fez 2 on the Xbox 1 unless they completely change their platform.
6815000	6817000	And that's unfortunately a lot of the things I've been hearing.
6817000	6821000	Although, I'm wondering if they're gonna flip that around too, come, you know.
6821000	6827000	Yeah, I was gonna say, this whole indie rabble rabble is not looking good for Microsoft.
6827000	6829000	But, yeah, who knows? Who knows?
6829000	6833000	Um, Drunami in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,
6833000	6836000	The guy behind Fez is a goddamn twat, though. Fuck him.
6836000	6839000	To be fair, yes. Yes. That is true.
6839000	6845000	Um, so, yes, uh, Xbox Live Gold. Remember, they're giving away those free games.
6845000	6849000	There's a whole bunch of asterisks to that, though.
6849000	6852000	The free games, yes, they are being put out.
6852000	6857000	However, you have to download them within the two-week time frame, I believe.
6857000	6862000	Um, at least that's the way with Fable 3. You have to download it by July.
6862000	6864000	Otherwise, you can't download it anymore.
6864000	6869000	And, now there's gonna be new games coming out the 1st and 16th of, um, each month.
6869000	6873000	Uh, with next month being Halo 3 and Assassin's Creed 2.
6873000	6880000	Um, and I'm wondering if that's gonna still be the same as, uh, it was with Fable 3.
6880000	6884000	Where you have to download it within those first two weeks that it's available.
6884000	6886000	Otherwise, you can't download it again.
6886000	6890000	Someone was saying that it might not be that way, but I think it's gonna be that way.
6890000	6896000	It's kind of a lame, I guess, way to get you to subscribe to live if you're not already doing that.
6896000	6900000	I mean, I am, so I guess I'll download those free games.
6900000	6902000	I didn't, I downloaded Fable 3 just for the fuck of it.
6902000	6909000	Halo 3, I already own. I guess I'll download it, Assassin's Creed 2, and give a shit about it.
6909000	6910000	So, we'll see.
6910000	6913000	Although, Crackdown. Crackdown would be pretty awesome to have in there.
6913000	6914000	That's old enough, I would say.
6914000	6919000	And, I can't find my disc for it anymore, so I'd love to, you know, have one of those.
6919000	6920000	I liked Crackdown.
6920000	6921000	Yeah, Crackdown was fun.
6921000	6925000	Remember, most people were just buying it for the Halo 3 preview, but it ended up being pretty good.
6925000	6927000	Yeah, I dig it.
6927000	6931000	Crackdown was more fun when you just, like, add those codes where, like, you just randomly spawn anything,
6931000	6934000	and you're like, haha, I'm just spawning cars off a roof of a building!
6934000	6940000	Yeah, that's like the stuff Loki lives for, though, is the whole, like, you know, hilarious mod things.
6940000	6941000	Keys to the City mode was awesome.
6941000	6946000	I didn't play story mode in Crackdown. I just wanted to blow shit up and drop cars off the top of buildings.
6946000	6950000	That's like Grand Theft Auto. Like, I, the story in Grand Theft Auto, who gives a shit?
6950000	6954000	It's really good, though. Speaking of which, have you played Grand Theft Auto IV yet?
6954000	6957000	Uh-huh. Uh-huh. That's what I thought.
6957000	6961000	No. I haven't.
6961000	6964000	Have you finished Saints Row III, at least?
6964000	6967000	No, I haven't finished it, but I have at least played a good chunk of that.
6967000	6971000	That game's hilarious. The funniest, I haven't laughed my ass off that hard in a long time.
6971000	6973000	For just a moment, you sounded like Greg Proops.
6974000	6976000	Okay. Are you sure you're not drunk?
6976000	6982000	No, your voice had that sort of quality that was Proops-like.
6982000	6984000	I'm not sure I'd hate it. Did you do your third story?
6984000	6986000	No, I haven't gotten a chance to do that yet.
6986000	6987000	Sorry, go ahead.
6987000	6996000	And then finally, this is pretty awesome, they are doing a free DLC update for Surgeon Simulator 2013.
6996000	6999000	That, of course, is going to add in Team Fortress 2 stuff.
6999000	7007000	So you get to play as the doctor there, and also you get to work, or the medic, and you get to work on the heavy.
7007000	7011000	And that's awesome.
7011000	7013000	Can you work on Sandvich?
7013000	7019000	You should actually just pick that up anyways, because it's awesome.
7020000	7024000	Alright, on the Xbox 360, there is now a Best of Disney app.
7024000	7030000	And no, that doesn't mean like, you know, there are games like Connect Adventure, Disney, or whatever that thing was called.
7030000	7033000	But trailers, clips, and animated shorts.
7033000	7037000	Oh, I hope they have that short that they had before Wreck-It Ralph with the paper planes. That was so good.
7037000	7038000	Paperman.
7038000	7039000	Thank you, Paperman.
7039000	7043000	Anyway, all that is available on the Best of Disney app.
7043000	7045000	It's a free download for gold subscribers.
7045000	7048000	There's content from Disney Channel, Disney XD, and Walt Disney Studios.
7048000	7053000	I imagine the trailers and the little stuff is free. Some of the other stuff, less free.
7053000	7057000	Xbox One and Google and Bing.
7057000	7063000	Hilarious little meme going around right now where folks, you know that predictive searching? I'm sure you've all played with this.
7063000	7064000	This is going around Tumblr for...
7064000	7068000	Hey, if you go to Google and do a predictive search, you type Orange Lounge.
7068000	7071000	It comes right out of Orange Lounge Radio. It's right there in the predictive search.
7071000	7072000	This is pretty awesome.
7072000	7073000	Because we're awesome.
7073000	7075000	And I think we've talked about this before. I think it's still the case.
7075000	7080000	If you go and you type Orange Lounge Radio, predictive search brings up Orange Lounge Radio Marissa.
7080000	7083000	Who isn't even a host to the show.
7083000	7087000	But she's infamous. So there you go. But she's great. And I'm totally okay with that.
7087000	7089000	I totally miss Marissa.
7089000	7092000	I do too. God, I was just in L.A. too and I didn't have a chance to see her.
7092000	7100000	But anyway, predictive searching on Google. If you search for The Xbox One is, it will come up and say terrible, ugly, a joke.
7100000	7104000	But you go to Bing and it says The Xbox One is amazing.
7104000	7109000	Well, some people took this one step further and started searching for things like Android and things like that.
7109000	7113000	And it's kind of interesting. Like on Google, it does something very similar.
7113000	7118000	So who knows what it is. I'm actually looking right now to see if the same thing happens.
7118000	7122000	Oh yeah, if I type The Xbox One is on Google, it is terrible, ugly, a joke.
7122000	7127000	You know, in my mind, how many people are really using Bing?
7127000	7128000	You're probably...
7128000	7130000	Everybody says Microsoft.
7130000	7131000	Actually...
7131000	7133000	You're probably a little bit of a Microsoft fanboy to begin with.
7133000	7139000	I used Bing for about 10 minutes when they were giving away free live cards or no Xbox point cards.
7139000	7143000	And then I got like two $20 cards for Xbox Live and then I stopped using Bing forever.
7143000	7146000	They are still technically doing that. You just have to search on there.
7146000	7153000	You know, make it a point to make some erroneous searches every day and then you can save up to get like five bucks worth of Xbox Live points.
7153000	7154000	It just takes you about a month.
7154000	7157000	So whatever, predictive searches. Hilarious.
7157000	7164000	Lastly, on PlayStation 4, if you're a fan of DC Universe Online or PlanetSide 2, you may be worried,
7164000	7169000	am I going to have to get PlayStation Plus because now that's going to be required to do multiplayer?
7169000	7172000	Am I going to need to get PlayStation Plus to play these MMOs?
7172000	7175000	The answer is no. Pretty awesome.
7175000	7182000	So yeah, you do not need to have PlayStation Plus if you want to play games like DC Universe Online and PlanetSide 2 online.
7182000	7183000	Very cool.
7183000	7189000	PlanetSide 2, however, not cross-compatible between PC and PlayStation 4.
7189000	7192000	DC Universe Online, however, will remain so.
7192000	7195000	I think that's the way things are today, to be honest.
7195000	7197000	Except DCU was poopy.
7197000	7200000	We have some fans though. I know Pod Culture is a huge fan of that.
7200000	7202000	You have a hate boner for DC to begin with.
7202000	7207000	No, I don't have a hate boner for DC. I have a hate boner for bad games and bad character development.
7207000	7209000	It's a hate hoo-ha, not a hate.
7209000	7211000	Rob?
7211000	7212000	What?
7212000	7219000	If Gail Simone wrote every book that DC did, I would read it.
7219000	7223000	I thought DC Universe was fun enough, especially because it's free to play now.
7223000	7225000	I see the charm in DC Universe Online.
7225000	7228000	It's like Ninja Turtles arcade game, but you get to make your own hero.
7228000	7232000	And you can make your hero as pretty as you want.
7232000	7235000	I didn't think it was very pretty at all.
7235000	7240000	You know what, the first thing I did was make myself a female version of Hawkeye.
7241000	7244000	All right. Black Wolf is correcting me in chat.
7244000	7248000	DC Universe Online does not play PC versus PS3. I thought it did.
7248000	7250000	Huh. Well, all right, then I'm wrong.
7250000	7253000	But PS4 will work with PS3.
7253000	7259000	And I believe that he left it up for third parties doing free to play games like that,
7259000	7263000	that they can decide whether they want to have that behind the paywall or not.
7263000	7266000	I would imagine that if you're interested in getting more people to play your game,
7266000	7268000	probably not going to put that behind it.
7268000	7272000	All right. All right, let's move on. Dark Sakura.
7272000	7275000	I was actually just about to point out in chat room that Gail Simone wrote Agent X,
7275000	7278000	which was a Deadpool book. Just saying, she's awesome.
7279000	7281000	Extover is in chat, by the way. Hey, Extover.
7281000	7282000	Hey.
7282000	7285000	Saying, didn't mind DCU, but it's easy to forget about.
7285000	7288000	It was very easy to forget about after, like, playing it twice.
7291000	7294000	The flames of her hatred are burning intensely.
7294000	7297000	Flames on the side of my face?
7297000	7298000	No.
7298000	7299000	All that shade.
7299000	7302000	I cannot touch the immortal Madeline Kahn.
7302000	7303000	The shade of it all.
7304000	7306000	You know, I don't even watch that show, so whatever.
7306000	7307000	You should.
7308000	7310000	Do you think I would totally dig the drag queens?
7310000	7311000	Uh, yeah.
7311000	7313000	I love drag queens, don't get me wrong.
7313000	7314000	Well, see. Anyway.
7314000	7316000	I just hate sitting down to watch a show.
7316000	7319000	I love doing video game news, which occasionally happens on this show.
7319000	7320000	You know what, bite me.
7320000	7323000	You're the one who brought up the shade. Rab.
7323000	7332000	So anyway, Arc System Works, who brought us Guilty Gear, said that if people want to see Guilty Gear on the Wii U, then you have to sign a petition.
7332000	7334000	And the petition is online, and I'm not going to link it.
7334000	7338000	It runs on the Unreal 3 engine, so basically, whatever.
7339000	7344000	In other news, Sega has been teasing something called Project 575.
7344000	7346000	We have no idea what it is.
7346000	7349000	It could be a rhythm game. It could be nothing.
7349000	7352000	It could be, uh, looks like a couple of girls.
7352000	7357000	So who knows. Maybe you just spend the whole game being awesome. I don't know.
7358000	7362000	And then, and this is the sad news. Rab.
7362000	7363000	Hmm.
7363000	7364000	I'm very, very sad.
7364000	7365000	Well, what happened?
7365000	7369000	Well, you remember how we had been covering, um, the whole Knuckles Dawson?
7369000	7370000	Oh, yeah.
7370000	7372000	Disappearance? Well, they found him.
7372000	7380000	Which, I mean, I think we pretty much knew it was a suicide issue for the fact that he cancelled his accounts.
7380000	7381000	Mm-hmm.
7381000	7383000	And basically up and left.
7383000	7384000	Mm-hmm.
7384000	7391000	But they, uh, found him, um, they're not releasing a cause of death yet. I mean, I'm pretty sure.
7391000	7398000	Well, and to be fair, even saying that is a little bit jump to conclusion because maybe in his mental unwell state, he may have just left.
7398000	7402000	Maybe had a plan in mind, so we don't know, and we don't want to fill in the gaps.
7402000	7407000	Yeah, but, well, I'm saying that current evidence is leading that way.
7407000	7408000	Sure, sure, sure.
7408000	7413000	Okay. Um, so, yeah, they, uh, they found his body. He was 28 years old.
7413000	7414000	That's very unfortunate.
7414000	7423000	And they found his bike and helmet in Stanley Park, and then, um, he left his wallet, computer, and phone at home.
7423000	7425000	But they found his body in the park across the bay, right?
7425000	7426000	Yeah.
7426000	7429000	So he was, he was on the move.
7429000	7431000	He left everything behind and left.
7431000	7442000	Yeah, it's, um, it's, it's really too bad. And, um, it's just a reminder that, uh, if you know somebody that might be reaching out for help, please try to get them help.
7442000	7444000	Don't just write it off as an attention thing.
7444000	7445000	Mm-hmm.
7445000	7455000	But make sure that you're not, okay, this is where I kind of say that's a line because, yeah, some people do want attention.
7455000	7459000	Some people are looking for attention because there's a reason for it.
7459000	7460000	Right.
7460000	7463000	And you see to it that they get help. Don't contribute to the underlying cause.
7463000	7464000	Mm-hmm.
7464000	7467000	Um, I do want to call attention to this, too, because I think it's pretty neat.
7467000	7476000	Um, you know, one reason that Knuckles was very popular in the community is that he actually did one achievement a day every day on the 360 for, like, two or three years.
7476000	7477000	Something like that.
7477000	7478000	It was, it was a significant amount of time.
7478000	7483000	Um, there's a call right now in a movement to try to get Microsoft to do an achievement in his honor.
7483000	7487000	Uh, some folks are saying even that day one achievement should, should have a tie-in to him.
7487000	7491000	Uh, I think it would be great if Microsoft could do some sort of achievement in his honor.
7491000	7500000	Uh, perhaps, you know, getting an achievement every day for a month or a week or something, something that would, uh, resonate with, you know, what he was known for in the community.
7500000	7504000	I think it would be a great, great thing and a great way to, um, uh, remember him.
7504000	7509000	Well, I'm also looking through the comments on here to see if they had any other information on here.
7509000	7513000	And basically the families already made a Facebook page about it releasing information.
7514000	7517000	So, I would say check Facebook and look for your information there.
7517000	7522000	That, uh, fineknuckles.com redirects to his Facebook or not his Facebook.
7522000	7525000	The Facebook his family set up in regards to the issue.
7525000	7526000	It's just tragic.
7526000	7527000	But yeah.
7527000	7530000	SSJ100MattInChat says, regardless, this was a tragedy. Absolutely.
7530000	7534000	But I do really urge people, don't take it upon yourself to be the diagnosis.
7534000	7538000	Tell the person to seek diagnosis and just be available.
7538000	7539000	Alright.
7539000	7541000	Well, let's shift gears here a little bit.
7541000	7548000	Let's take it to the listeners with a question and a, uh, segment we do here every week called the FUGL Question of the Week.
7554000	7558000	Facebook and Google, you take those words, you slam them together, you get FUGL.
7558000	7564000	And the FUGL Question of the Week this week has to do with a Nintendo story.
7564000	7577000	And, uh, the Nintendo story that we link to, um, talks about how Nintendo is hiring more people to strengthen their internal development studios in the development of fan favorite franchises as well as new intellectual properties.
7577000	7586000	But the question we asked on FUGL was, which do you hope that Nintendo focuses on more in the development of games for Wii U and 3DS?
7586000	7591000	Development of fan favorite franchise games or new IPs and why?
7592000	7595000	I was looking for people to kind of pick one or the other.
7595000	7599000	I'm not sure I was really clear in that question because we get a lot of answers where people are saying both.
7599000	7601000	I'll go ahead and read those answers anyway.
7601000	7603000	Let's start on Google Plus tonight.
7603000	7609000	Act Dev says, well, it's kind of obvious that they're going to try to focus on the Wii U since they truly need games for that.
7609000	7616000	Don't know if they'll be totally new IPs, but they'll probably incorporate new ideas into the franchises we know and love.
7617000	7624000	And while we already have a new Smash Brothers on the way, I would love to see a new Metroid using the game pad and, of course, a new F-Zero and Kirby game.
7624000	7629000	Retertainment says, as has been said many times before, variety is the spice of life.
7629000	7633000	If you do the same things over and over again, eventually those things get tiresome, dated, and boring.
7633000	7636000	However, we are talking about a corporation here.
7636000	7642000	Corporations live by one mantra. Cash rules everything around me. Cream.
7643000	7648000	While I may want newer IPs in order to get a more diverse gaming landscape, older IPs sell better.
7648000	7653000	Therefore, even though I want new IPs, old IPs are probably what I'm going to get.
7653000	7660000	That's a good answer that kind of tells me what you want that kind of keeps the real side in it.
7660000	7665000	I like that answer. I think you are right. Well, I think a lot of these answers are right.
7666000	7678000	Liam C. on Facebook says, concentrate on developing new IPs to bring in a new audience that is generally held by the Xbox Playstation, but also give older franchises a chance on the Wii U, like Golden Sun and F-Zero.
7679000	7688000	Codeman says, I'm kind of on the fence about this. As much as I would love to see new IPs, I love remakes of such games as the Mario franchise, Smash Brothers, F-Zero, etc.
7688000	7693000	I think that Nintendo should begin to focus a bit on indie developers. That's where the fans are. Well, at least me.
7693000	7698000	Although the exclusive Bayonetta 2 looks fantastic. So, I just don't know. Very difficult question.
7698000	7701000	Yeah, that was the idea. It was a difficult question.
7701000	7706000	I always mispronounce this name, and especially because I've been drinking. I'm not going to remember it now.
7706000	7713000	It's Sial? Sial? Sial? I probably said it wrong. I'm very sorry.
7714000	7723000	Says in chat, I think they should try for an equal focus on the Wii U and 3DS, maybe giving the Wii U slightly more attention due to its issue in the sales department.
7723000	7729000	As for new IPs versus old, that's another. Both, I want more 2D Metroid and another Mega Man game.
7729000	7736000	Nintendo slapped the stupid out of Capcom real quick and get on that. However, if they make something real interesting, I will not be disappointed either.
7737000	7746000	Man, how epic would a 2D Mega Man game be on the Wii U where you could have your thing to switch weapons right there on the gamepad, so you never have to bring up the little window.
7746000	7749000	You don't ever have to bring it up after SNES games.
7749000	7751000	Oh yeah, that's right, because you have the L and R triggers.
7751000	7752000	You can use the L and R triggers.
7752000	7754000	That's true. But still, still, think about it.
7754000	7756000	And you can keep holding a charge while you switch through your weapons.
7756000	7759000	A map or something. There's so much potential there with the Wii U.
7760000	7766000	Andy R says, new IPs. There we go. Somebody's saying one or the other. New IPs.
7766000	7773000	Mario and Zelda are cool and all, but I'd love to see a Nintendo mascot that wasn't created more than three console generations ago.
7773000	7777000	Well, you get Steel Diver for free. That was this generation.
7777000	7782000	SSG100 Matt says, we have all been waiting for Nintendo to come out with the next new IP for many years.
7782000	7788000	They have flirted with some franchises, but fully expanded them to the length of Mario, Pokemon, Metroid, and Zelda.
7788000	7793000	While we all still respect and love the classics, they will always be there for us in some way, shape, or form.
7793000	7796000	I'm more interested in seeing the next new idea from Nintendo.
7796000	7803000	The thought of something new coming to the table sounds much more exciting than just another Mario, Zelda, or Metroid rehash.
7803000	7809000	I'm going to give you two huge IPs that Nintendo did last generation.
7809000	7816000	In fact, I would say Nintendo's biggest IP of all time came last generation.
7816000	7819000	And y'all are forgetting. Anybody?
7819000	7820000	Wii Fit.
7820000	7821000	Excite Truck.
7821000	7822000	Close.
7822000	7823000	Wii Fit is one of the big ones.
7823000	7824000	Wii Sports.
7824000	7825000	Wii Sports.
7825000	7826000	Excite Truck.
7826000	7827000	Wii Sports was last generation.
7827000	7828000	I would kill for it.
7828000	7830000	No, the answer is Excite Truck.
7830000	7833000	Okay, fine. There's Excite Truck as well.
7833000	7834000	Excite Truck is awesome.
7834000	7837000	Alright.
7837000	7839000	Let's see, where was I?
7839000	7843000	Speaking of which, now that I think about it, what are those guys working on?
7843000	7851000	The guys at Monster Games that have done, you know, two racing games for Nintendo and they're still working on another racing game that...
7851000	7853000	Hopefully not unemployment.
7853000	7854000	Maybe F-Zero?
7854000	7858000	Excite Truck U. That could only be the dream.
7858000	7862000	Alright. Did I read SSG100 Matt's answer? I did. That was the one I was on, right?
7862000	7864000	I think so. Okay.
7864000	7871000	Zether says, new IP. We need more of those, less of Mario and Zelda. When Nintendo experiments, sometimes the result is good.
7871000	7875000	The thing they have to hear, they have to have something that's going to do well.
7875000	7884000	Clover Nikon says, the new talent should work on new IPs. That doesn't mean the new talent could offer a fresh take on our favorite Nintendo classics.
7884000	7893000	Tiger Claw says, I would like Nintendo to work on a brand new Star Fox game, but I think they could take the game in another direction and do it no linear and more open world-ish.
7893000	7901000	Instead of sticking to the rail shooter it was originally. Plus, I would like to see Nintendo develop a brand new IP that doesn't involve their own characters making cameos.
7901000	7908000	You know, Mario Galaxy was kind of a new IP. It's just that it had Mario, but it didn't play like a Mario. Well, I mean, it didn't, it didn't.
7908000	7911000	It was a platformer, but it was so different. You know what I mean?
7911000	7915000	I like Super Paper Mario. I thought that was a good version of Paper Mario.
7915000	7920000	And I liked it a lot better than, like, I even went back and played Paper Mario and I just like, eh.
7920000	7925000	Nintendo's solution to sell new IPs is to shove Mario into it. And it really works.
7925000	7928000	It really works for them in a way that...
7928000	7941000	Not so much for Wario. Remember the Wario game that they had that was fucking amazing? It was all hand drawn and like, it looked just like one of those Rayman games and then it was just, no one bought it.
7941000	7945000	That was Wario Land, shake it. That game was so much fun.
7946000	7955000	Gamergirl says, I think it would be cool if the new IPs helped work on maybe some new games. Mario and Zelda are fine, but what if they steered clear of those two icons for a while?
7955000	7958000	Would it make people dislike Nintendo anymore?
7958000	7968000	Here's the thing, there has to be an HD Zelda. That has to happen. Can you imagine, like, people will revolt in the streets if there's not an HD Zelda and soon.
7968000	7971000	It's time to bring back Rad Racer.
7971000	7978000	I'm with you, Gamergirl. I think they should do some, but to deny an HD Zelda, that's too much.
7978000	7981000	We need to see the rebirth of Snake, Rattle, and Roll.
7981000	7986000	JVMonk? That wasn't a Nintendo game, was it? It was rare or, yeah.
7986000	7987000	It was, but Nintendo needs to...
7987000	7991000	I may get some hate, but Zelda's kind of overrated and has its talent.
7991000	7992000	Get out! No, I'm just kidding.
7992000	7996000	Actually, like Ocarina of Time...
7996000	7998000	People need to move on past Zelda.
7998000	8006000	Ocarina of Time is super overrated, but I have to remember that a lot of people, like, that is literally the game they grew up on.
8006000	8014000	Like, went through their teenage years playing and so forth, so, like, I will always love Link to the Past the best.
8014000	8019000	So when they announced that 3DS sequel, I literally did the eeee thing, right?
8019000	8023000	When they announced that sequel, because I'm so excited, because that's, like, my favorite Zelda.
8023000	8028000	I don't get Ocarina of Time at that same level. Certainly not when we start talking Majora's Mask and, like, yeah.
8028000	8031000	Link to the Past is the only one I can play.
8031000	8032000	However, um...
8032000	8035000	I did play through a crapload of Ocarina, though.
8035000	8039000	Twilight Princess was pretty fucking good. Like, that I can't deny.
8039000	8041000	I named my cat after that game.
8041000	8043000	It was pretty for a Wii game, but...
8046000	8048000	Alright, anyhow. Uh, Chiggers...
8048000	8051000	Is it me or was Midna just the best new character ever in a Zelda series?
8051000	8052000	Yeah.
8052000	8054000	There's a reason why you named a creature after her.
8054000	8055000	Alright, uh...
8055000	8056000	I think she's a little imp.
8056000	8058000	Chiggers in our Facebook says,
8058000	8061000	I would like to see a new Mario RPG and not Paper Mario.
8061000	8065000	I think they need to bring Square Enix back to do it, too. Good luck.
8065000	8070000	And work on your damn online capabilities, like Online Mario Party or even the aforementioned Mario RPG.
8070000	8074000	I think it would be kind of cool to do a Diablo-type online Mario game.
8074000	8077000	How would that even work, but I like it.
8077000	8078000	And lastly, Raginator says,
8078000	8081000	I want to see a mix of new IPs and fan faves.
8081000	8083000	Why does it have to be one or another?
8083000	8084000	Because I said so.
8084000	8086000	That's the question. One or the other.
8087000	8089000	That's fine. That's fine.
8089000	8091000	Uh, we appreciate all the answers nonetheless.
8091000	8093000	It sounds like most people are like,
8093000	8095000	we need a little of column A and a little of column B.
8095000	8097000	That you can't make me pick one, Rob.
8097000	8098000	You just can't.
8098000	8100000	And I can respect that.
8100000	8103000	Those are some of the answers there at facebook.com slash orangehonestradio
8103000	8105000	and our Google Plus community.
8105000	8107000	Thanks to y'all for participating.
8107000	8108000	Back to the news. Loki.
8108000	8109000	Alright.
8109000	8111000	So this is pretty awesome news.
8111000	8116000	Volition has actually kind of partnered up with
8116000	8121000	the guys behind the Gentleman of the Row mod.
8121000	8123000	It's the Idol Ninja.
8123000	8128000	And they are kind of doing this mod tool thing.
8128000	8132000	They're actually participating on their forums now pretty actively
8132000	8138000	and helping create all sorts of new mods for Saints Row the Third, Saints Row 2
8138000	8143000	and eventually going to have a full blown mod kit for Saints Row 4.
8143000	8145000	And we're talking all sorts of stuff.
8145000	8148000	And even Saints Row the Third already you can do quite a bit.
8148000	8154000	Like I have some mods running on there where I have some handheld lasers and stuff like that.
8154000	8155000	They're pretty sweet.
8155000	8160000	So yeah, I'm pretty excited to see what they're going to do with this.
8160000	8165000	And the way it sounds like now is with these tools you can essentially
8165000	8167000	it's basically the tools they're using to make the game.
8167000	8172000	You can create new maps, new weapons, characters, missions, etc.
8172000	8175000	It's going to really expand a lot of the game.
8175000	8179000	So I'm already expecting to get it on PC anyway.
8179000	8180000	So it makes me excited.
8180000	8182000	I know you love your mods too.
8182000	8183000	It'll be awesome.
8183000	8184000	Alright.
8184000	8187000	Well maybe you'll be able to mod this game when it comes to PC.
8187000	8189000	Although probably not because it is an MMO.
8189000	8191000	It's always connected but kind of surprising.
8191000	8196000	Dragon Quest X announced during a 10 hour live stream.
8196000	8197000	I'm hoping that was a lot of gameplay.
8197000	8198000	Oh boy.
8198000	8199000	Yeah it's a lot, huh?
8199000	8203000	But anyway, Square Enix announced during this live stream that the Nintendo exclusive
8203000	8207000	or at least it was, it's coming to PC on September 26th in Japan.
8207000	8212000	It will retail for $40 but there will also be a deluxe version for 9800 yen
8212000	8214000	which would be about what, 80 bucks?
8214000	8218000	That has a Dragon Quest X PC game controller, monster encyclopedia book,
8218000	8222000	a map of the world, security token, and additional in-game content.
8222000	8227000	Very interesting because Dragon Quest obviously is huge in Japan
8227000	8228000	and this game was a selling point.
8228000	8230000	Dragon Quest X was on Wii and Wii U.
8230000	8234000	Never came here though and I don't understand why but alright.
8234000	8237000	I'm surprised Monster Hunter hasn't really come to PC.
8237000	8239000	Yeah it's very interesting.
8239000	8240000	I mean different company but.
8240000	8241000	Yeah it's just so interesting.
8241000	8245000	But anyway, you can get a Dragon Quest X PC benchmark.
8245000	8248000	It's available for download at nvidia.co.jp
8248000	8251000	and there's also a beta sign up available.
8251000	8254000	So yeah, there you go, Dragon Quest X coming to PC.
8254000	8261000	Nintendo losing that exclusive in Japan but maybe the Wii U especially didn't have.
8261000	8262000	So console exclusive.
8262000	8265000	Yeah, well yeah it's still console exclusive which is cool.
8265000	8267000	Well Wii U I mean.
8267000	8270000	Final Fantasy XIV will be exclusive to Sony consoles.
8270000	8274000	It's not going to be on Nintendo and it's not going to be on Xbox 360 or one
8274000	8277000	so kind of a similar situation.
8277000	8280000	Anyhow, Dark Sakura.
8281000	8286000	In other news, there's a company called the Fullbright Company that has a game.
8286000	8288000	I have to actually check this out.
8288000	8291000	Their little trailer for it called Gone Home.
8291000	8297000	Which is sort of, I guess it's going to go into some sort of point and click survival horror game.
8297000	8303000	Where basically a girl goes home from college to find her family is completely missing.
8303000	8305000	The house is empty and she's trying to look for clues.
8305000	8313000	Well, basically the company is pulling out of their showing at Penny Arcade Expo.
8313000	8323000	After some comments that were made regarding some basic transphobia.
8323000	8327000	This was from Mike with Penny Arcade.
8327000	8331000	And lots of just really negative comments that were going out.
8331000	8337000	So basically they're saying that even though this is their biggest form of exposure that they could get for their game.
8337000	8345000	They're pulling out because those type of comments and basically the nature of these people is not what they want to associate with their game and their company.
8345000	8347000	So they've completely pulled out.
8347000	8354000	I honestly get the sense from this guy over at Penny Arcade is that he's not necessarily transphobic by nature.
8354000	8357000	You know that would mean that he like hates them or whatever.
8358000	8360000	But he kind of he has...
8360000	8361000	Doesn't understand it?
8361000	8366000	Yeah, I think so. I think he kind of misunderstands how to communicate about that in public or whatever.
8366000	8368000	And he's very hard headed.
8368000	8372000	And I think the big problem is how he was lashing out on Twitter.
8372000	8376000	And when he said he's made some comment like if you use the...
8376000	8379000	And I am totally paraphrasing. Do not quote me on this because I don't have his Twitter in front of me.
8379000	8387000	But it was something like if you say the word cis around me then stop doing that because I totally discount you at that point.
8387000	8390000	Like really bold headed, thick headed statements like that.
8390000	8392000	Oh there was the dick wolves thing too.
8392000	8396000	Think before you tweet. You influence a lot of people.
8396000	8399000	My granddaddy had a fantastic phrase.
8399000	8402000	Put brain in gear before mouth in motion.
8402000	8404000	Or in this case fingers in motion.
8404000	8407000	But it's definitely an act don't react.
8407000	8409000	Take a moment and think about it.
8409000	8410000	Yeah.
8410000	8416000	So, and you know some folks in extrovert says they were comments that were taken out of context.
8416000	8422000	But when you influence that many people a singular tweet like that, that can happen.
8422000	8425000	You know and you've got to really think about some of these things that you're saying.
8425000	8427000	You know and again I'm giving the guy credit.
8427000	8430000	I don't think at heart he hates trans people.
8430000	8432000	Like that's not the impression I get at all.
8433000	8438000	It's not like Penny Arcade built its reputation on being the most PC comic there was.
8438000	8442000	The impression I get is that he's saying it's my way or the highway.
8442000	8449000	And the trans community is trying to say actually when you say this we consider it offensive for these reasons.
8449000	8454000	You know and it's like it's kind of like he's not conveying that he understands that appropriately.
8454000	8458000	Yeah it's one thing to educate someone who doesn't want to be educated.
8459000	8470000	And I can understand though where as a company if there's this general conception going on that this is how they feel.
8470000	8474000	I can understand wanting to separate your company's image from that conception.
8474000	8480000	So yeah they were perfectly and if they wanted to pull out of Penny Arcade Expo whatever their reasons were they were valid.
8480000	8483000	Did you see the follow up by the way? I don't know if you saw the follow up.
8483000	8484000	No I didn't.
8484000	8488000	He actually posted an apology yesterday the 21st.
8488000	8490000	No I guess that would be two days ago.
8490000	8494000	He actually ended up making a donation to the Trevor Project of $20,000.
8494000	8498000	Now I feel really good and really kind of hmm at that.
8498000	8501000	Like Trevor Project is an awesome charity.
8501000	8503000	I'm so glad they're getting this.
8503000	8506000	But there's that part of me I have to go here.
8506000	8508000	There's that part of me that's like.
8508000	8511000	You can't throw money at the problem and expect people to forget it.
8511000	8514000	It's not so much that but it's like where did that money come from?
8514000	8519000	Because you just told everybody you needed to do this Kickstarter to do this Penny Arcade podcast.
8519000	8524000	And you know you set the bar at $10 and set these stretch goals at hundreds of thousands of dollars.
8524000	8528000	When I can tell you it does not take that kind of money to do a podcast.
8528000	8530000	It's the money that they're bringing in from Penny Arcade?
8530000	8531000	Yeah.
8531000	8538000	So I mean I'm again it's a slippery slope because I'm like I can't say oh $20,000 a charity what a horrible thing you did.
8538000	8539000	But I'm just kind of.
8539000	8541000	It almost seems like they're trying to buy forgiveness.
8543000	8545000	That's my top impression.
8545000	8546000	This is a.
8546000	8547000	Yeah.
8547000	8548000	Okay let me put it this way.
8548000	8549000	I think this is the best way I can put it.
8549000	8555000	This is a good step but it's not going to fix the problem.
8555000	8556000	Does that make sense?
8556000	8558000	Yeah.
8558000	8560000	The problem is.
8560000	8561000	Here's an example.
8561000	8562000	The reaction and the tweets and.
8562000	8564000	I can give a local example.
8564000	8566000	This is what it makes me think of.
8566000	8575000	Remember when the ice cream chain local leather bees was having a problem about them having donated their money to the pro prop eight.
8575000	8580000	They was just but we we serve ice cream at pride events.
8580000	8586000	It's sort of almost the same thing where they're trying to put a bandaid over something without getting to what the actual problem was.
8586000	8591000	And in this case it's like well we're getting money to this but the whole thing is that the damage has been done.
8591000	8597000	It's going to take quite a bit more to turn it around if at all.
8597000	8599000	You know what I mean.
8599000	8604000	So it's it's like they're trying to make put a put a bandaid over it and hope people forget.
8604000	8610000	Extra for in chat says I don't think they feel like it'll fix the problem either but it doesn't hurt to donate money shrug.
8610000	8618000	I agree it's not again I'm not I'm certainly not hating on the donation but there is that part of me that goes like okay well you know.
8618000	8622000	Put your mouth where your money is I guess is what I'm saying.
8622000	8624000	And but you know nobody's perfect.
8624000	8628000	Lord knows I've said a lot of stupid shit on this show over the past 11 years.
8628000	8638000	So anyway but the other thing I want to address we have a lot of people in chat that are asking what does what is says and what is this gender and teaching moment teaching moment.
8638000	8645000	It means a gender you were born with whatever your physical genitalia indicate that you are or your chromosomes indicate right.
8645000	8648000	That's what you are you agree with what you were born with.
8648000	8655000	Now there's certainly a reaction out there that people will go well I have male genitals and I'm male but isn't that just normal.
8655000	8657000	For you it is.
8657000	8659000	Right and that's the point.
8659000	8669000	That's where the transgender community is is having is is having this difficulty because so many people just go well there's no such thing as this gender because that's just normal.
8669000	8673000	And transgender is like well wait a minute transgender is normal too.
8673000	8675000	This is a real thing.
8675000	8676000	I would say.
8676000	8678000	This is how we help you know.
8678000	8681000	Cisgender would be the majority.
8681000	8682000	Yes.
8682000	8693000	As in you find more people biologically who agree with the gender that they genetically were predisposed towards I guess.
8693000	8700000	I mean you know it could be hormonal it could be people you also have people with multiple chromosome issues.
8700000	8705000	You know are you still have people who are born hermaphroditic.
8705000	8715000	And it's whatever like that what was that that that story that was going that was making the rounds about the the man in China who went to have a problem says well technically you're female.
8715000	8720000	Because he actually had multiple chromosomal issues but they said he had female bits.
8720000	8722000	He just thought he was small.
8722000	8732000	But you know the whole thing is that well that's what his doctor told him that the government upheld he'd been raised male he lived male government upheld your your man.
8732000	8734000	You know it's that type of thing.
8734000	8735000	You know.
8736000	8739000	Whatever and I am not.
8739000	8744000	I'm not a big fan of labels in general because I think that labels are a good way.
8744000	8753000	Yeah maybe you can embrace it to understand who you are for a degree of self-acceptance but it's also ways that people try to categorize other people.
8753000	8762000	Queen Simeon our chat says that's kind of like calling white skin normal or less colored crayon heterosexual normal.
8762000	8767000	Well and the big thing and actually I love people on Tumblr for this.
8767000	8774000	We're getting to see a lot more attention put on the asexuality community for people who just have no interest in it.
8774000	8776000	Which.
8776000	8780000	OK I'll go for people who define their sexuality as none of the above.
8780000	8784000	You can be romantic but not have.
8784000	8786000	And it doesn't stop you from not you.
8786000	8788000	I've known several people in that category.
8788000	8789000	Exactly.
8789000	8791000	And you know I'll go ahead and say it. I'm in that category.
8791000	8795000	Don't don't like it. Don't care. I like reading about it.
8795000	8799000	I think porn is hilarious but I really don't.
8799000	8801000	I never really have.
8801000	8808000	But you're in a fully functional but I'm in a functional marriage and sometimes you know it makes me happy to make Dan happy.
8808000	8811000	But it has nothing to say about him. It's all me.
8811000	8816000	And he understands that and he's perfectly fine with that and I have no problem admitting it to anybody.
8816000	8819000	I just it's just not how I'm wired.
8819000	8833000	And you know I think that when you get to the point where you have people that are looking at something that they don't understand where it doesn't fit into what their concept of normal is.
8833000	8835000	There's going to be a reaction to it.
8835000	8838000	There's going to be people who go oh well that's not normal.
8838000	8843000	That's not I don't think that way I was raised to think that well it doesn't matter what you were raised to think.
8843000	8845000	What matters is what is.
8845000	8847000	Just because you were raised. Oh my God.
8847000	8850000	This actually goes back to the stupid Paula Deen thing too.
8850000	8854000	Just because you were raised to think that does not mean that you are right to think that.
8854000	8858000	Let me get another one more comment here because I think this is an important one to end on.
8858000	8862000	Chiggers in chat says there's no such thing as a normal human and totally agree.
8862000	8871000	But that's kind of where the problem with you know Penny Arcade Guy's reaction lies is that when he says like you know if you use this term then you're an idiot essentially.
8871000	8880000	You know he's kind of like you know he's he's saying it's it's he that he rejects that and I think that's just that's that's the issue.
8880000	8890000	You know among other things I just say you know it doesn't matter who what bits you were born with it doesn't matter if you love someone and don't want to sleep with them.
8890000	8892000	It doesn't matter if you want to sleep with them then don't love them.
8892000	8898000	You know I guess that's kind of but it just matters that you don't be an asshole.
8899000	8900000	Don't be an asshole.
8900000	8903000	This is a perfect comment to end on and then we'll go to the next story Loki.
8903000	8906000	Drunami, fuck the haters, be you.
8906000	8907000	Amen.
8907000	8908000	Amen.
8908000	8909000	Well and don't be an asshole.
8909000	8912000	Alright Loki, fuck the haters, be you with the next story.
8912000	8920000	So yes PlayStation Plus is not going to be required for the automatic updates on your PlayStation 4.
8920000	8927000	Remember it does automatic updates in the background on the PlayStation 4 and right now that's only a feature that's on PlayStation Plus.
8927000	8932000	However that's something that's going to change once the PlayStation 4 comes out at least for the PlayStation 4.
8932000	8944000	It's not going to be tied to that so you will still be able to do those auto updates for games game and system updates and yeah so that's kind of cool.
8944000	8952000	But of course they would like to encourage that you buy PlayStation Plus as well but I was kind of disappointed.
8952000	8957000	I just signed up for PlayStation Plus and I remember they have an instant game collection.
8957000	8964000	I didn't realize they cycle titles out of that so you have to kind of download them at the time in order to be able to play some of them.
8964000	8968000	Because I wanted to do the Shadow Eco and Shadow of the Colossus collection and stuff like that.
8968000	8975000	But you know right now it's like Saints were the Third Vanquish which is going away so I downloaded it anyways.
8976000	8982000	And LittleBigPlanetKarting which by the way will be this week's VOG gaming night title.
8982000	8984000	I have that game maybe I'll actually be able to play it for once.
8984000	8985000	Yes Friday night.
8985000	8988000	I was guessing on that other podcast this week that's why I couldn't do it this week.
8988000	8992000	That's right this week I was playing Final Fantasy 14 so I didn't have anything.
8992000	9003000	But yes this week it will be LittleBigPlanetKarting on the PlayStation 3 so if you have PlayStation Plus it's a free title download it and check it out.
9003000	9005000	I have yet to play it so it will be interesting.
9005000	9007000	It's fun.
9007000	9008000	It looks fun.
9008000	9009000	Yeah you'll have fun with it.
9009000	9012000	Alright moving on to this story I find this interesting.
9012000	9015000	This is about Dungeons and Dragons Chronicles of Mystaria.
9015000	9019000	Now this game just came out on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network.
9019000	9023000	It's remasters of the old 90's arcade games which were awesome by the way.
9023000	9028000	But in Japan they're getting a special PlayStation 3 retail release.
9028000	9032000	Exclusive features and enhancements not in the digital version.
9032000	9033000	What?
9033000	9042000	I mean this sounds great don't get me wrong but why were there two versions of this game being done and why is the better one exclusive to Japan?
9042000	9046000	Because the new one has the color edit feature.
9046000	9049000	Multiple players can play as the same character.
9049000	9051000	There's an in depth series of options.
9051000	9054000	You can toggle features like random damage and breakable weapons.
9055000	9058000	I don't get it.
9058000	9060000	Oh well.
9060000	9064000	Luckily the PlayStation 3 is region free so if you feel very strongly about it.
9064000	9067000	Ultimately I'll be satisfied with the digital version here.
9067000	9073000	But if you feel strongly if you really love these games the good news is PlayStation 3 is region free so import it from Japan.
9073000	9074000	Have a ball.
9074000	9078000	Just hope you can read the Japanese text or know the game well enough to get around it.
9078000	9080000	So there you go.
9080000	9084000	It's that time of the week where we go to the mailbag and read some of your emails.
9084000	9086000	Are you good to do that tonight?
9086000	9087000	I'll be okay there's only four.
9087000	9089000	Oh my god there were only two earlier.
9089000	9091000	Okay let's go to the mailbag.
9091000	9095000	Well if there were other they were Russian or Mandarin.
9095000	9097000	We have a huge influx.
9097000	9099000	I know a word in Russian.
9099000	9100000	Duh.
9100000	9107000	Just to throw it out there our mailbag is still mailbag at orangelandradio.com.
9107000	9112000	However I'm strongly contemplating changing that in the coming weeks.
9112000	9116000	If for nothing else than to flush out the spam because we're getting too much of it.
9116000	9120000	I actually would recommend that we switch it through a Google account.
9120000	9123000	Unfortunately you have to pay for those now for business accounts.
9123000	9124000	No.
9124000	9125000	Yes you do.
9125000	9126000	Well what about the redirects?
9126000	9128000	I don't know I will look into that.
9128000	9130000	Because I really like Google's filters.
9130000	9131000	Yeah I know.
9131000	9132000	We'll talk about that later.
9132000	9135000	You have to pay for that now unfortunately but we will talk about that offline.
9135000	9136000	I have a dollar.
9136000	9139000	For now continue using mailbag at orangelandradio.com.
9139000	9141000	We will flood the Twitter and all that stuff.
9141000	9142000	Thanks brownies please.
9142000	9143000	When we change.
9143000	9144000	Alright.
9144000	9145000	Okay.
9145000	9146000	Dear OLR.
9146000	9150000	I'm sorry I couldn't get through last week as I was eager to discuss my own thoughts on E3 with you.
9150000	9154000	With Next Generation officially across the horizon.
9154000	9157000	I find myself reminiscing about my own journey with gaming.
9157000	9162000	I discovered the arcades in the late 70's and immediately fell in love with video games.
9162000	9164000	I met soft friends that owned 2600's before Christmas.
9165000	9167000	My father bought us an Atari 5200.
9167000	9168000	I got two of those.
9168000	9169000	They're awesome.
9169000	9170000	I love that thing.
9170000	9171000	Terrible controllers and all.
9171000	9172000	Yes thank you.
9172000	9175000	The controllers of 5200 are ass.
9175000	9177000	Dan just rebuilt two controllers.
9177000	9179000	So that we could go to Atari party.
9179000	9180000	Okay.
9180000	9187000	My software career began as a game tester for Sega testing games like Dark Wizard on Sega CD and Aladdin for Game Gear.
9187000	9193000	I even owned my own retail store when I rented out import games and met a lot of local developers from Namco, Capcom, and EA.
9193000	9196000	I since left the gaming industry but have remained dedicated to the community at large.
9196000	9200000	I have probably owned nearly every major console and portable in the last 20 years.
9200000	9202000	Sorry for being sniffy.
9202000	9205000	I find myself in a strange position these days.
9205000	9208000	I've pre-ordered both the PS4 and the much maligned Xbox One.
9208000	9211000	Rob remains one of my two friends on the Wii U by the way.
9211000	9212000	Haha.
9212000	9216000	You guys have described coming to E3 as if it was a death march.
9216000	9219000	And I guess that I really didn't perceive it as such.
9219000	9223000	I won't go so far as to say that I agree with every policy that's being introduced.
9223000	9225000	But I'm not frightened either.
9225000	9230000	I wonder if the core gaming community is simply intimidated by what this change might mean.
9230000	9234000	This is after all the final transition into a digital delivery only reality.
9234000	9237000	Of course since then they've kind of backpedaled.
9237000	9241000	BlackWolf and Chad is asking, so can this guy fix my Neo Geo?
9241000	9243000	Maybe.
9243000	9246000	Bobby I'm still checking some of my resources.
9246000	9247000	Trust me.
9247000	9250000	Well if this guy, who emailed this?
9250000	9251000	Dark Charger.
9251000	9254000	If Dark Charger's listening and you can fix Neo Geo's please let us know.
9254000	9257000	Yeah and if you can mod my Neo Geo, I'm just kidding.
9257000	9258000	We're gonna bring you business buddy.
9258000	9260000	Did I tell you how we got a Neo Geo?
9260000	9263000	Dan traded his take a CD for it. That's how we have a Neo Geo.
9263000	9267000	Uh, where was I?
9267000	9271000	Still I look at all the amazing games at E3 and I couldn't imagine myself not being part of that.
9271000	9277000	The six year old enemy that walked into that first arcade still finds excitement at how gaming is getting better and frankly cheaper.
9277000	9283000	The Xbox One makes sense for me as a primary console because I actually am really looking forward to the multimedia features.
9283000	9286000	I want an all in one solution for games, IPTV, etc.
9286000	9294000	My relatives are all excited that I will be sharing my gaming library with them because they know I buy a ton of games.
9294000	9299000	For them this opens up gaming in ways not previously available especially those that live out of the immediate area.
9299000	9303000	I'm still getting the PS4 for the exclusives, JM ports, and indie games.
9303000	9315000	And it's all the excitement I find myself a bit sad that I no longer quite fit in the same way with the core gaming community that I identified with for so long.
9315000	9327000	Perhaps the years of my own career as an online gaming software developer have skewed that perceptive, I guess maybe perception, especially since I know how little game developers actually make.
9327000	9334000	I often find myself these days castigated on forums for my views despite my lifelong dedication to this hobby.
9334000	9339000	I am at least, I am glad at least that every gamer indeed has a voice here.
9339000	9342000	Your friendly neighborhood gaming pariah, Dark Charger.
9342000	9352000	You know there's a lot of passionate opinions right now. Don't let Twitter and Facebook and the things that people say when there's nobody around there to immediately yell at them for what they're saying.
9352000	9359000	Don't take that with too much weight. Like you know, yeah I was pretty miserable going into this year's E3.
9359000	9367000	And I understand where people were excited about pushing things forward and some of these new ideas that Microsoft was going to bring to the table.
9367000	9370000	Although it was a big nebula we didn't really know.
9370000	9376000	But I don't think that means like doom and gloom that they didn't go that way either.
9376000	9384000	I think it just says that you know $60 is a lot to pay for a game and people want control over you know what they do when they're done with that game.
9384000	9395000	So by the time these consoles come out I think you'll hear a lot more about the games themselves because people will be actually playing them and this will get a lot better.
9395000	9399000	Well there's a PS on this. This is PS if you have never done it.
9399000	9403000	Please do a classic game of the week on Treasure's Yu Yu Hawk show for our Mega Drive.
9403000	9410000	That was a good game. But now though I'm really sad because like my favorite song from that series just popped into my head, Sayonara Bye Bye.
9410000	9413000	I did watch quite a bit of Yu Yu Hawk Show.
9413000	9415000	Sounds like it could be a classic game soon.
9415000	9418000	Well don't let me forget about it. That was a good game.
9418000	9424000	Alright, hello OLR radio. That's kind of a redundant R. I love the crew.
9424000	9427000	Hello ATM machine.
9427000	9430000	Hello pin number.
9430000	9435000	To all gamers, can't we all just get along? Please go and pre-order an Xbox One.
9435000	9440000	We can't let a little negativity take us out of the game. Show Microsoft that we are there through thick and thin.
9440000	9444000	Let's face it, $900 for both consoles ain't bad.
9444000	9448000	Dude, you know what? That's almost a month of rent.
9448000	9450000	Yeah, I hate to say it but...
9450000	9454000	What is not that... Whatever your income is, I want it.
9454000	9456000	Yeah, I hate to say it.
9456000	9458000	Tell your daddy to adopt me.
9458000	9469000	Or to give this guy a little credit, if it's $900 spread across a year, and I can buy one console this year and one console next year, that's far more reasonable.
9469000	9471000	And probably what I will do.
9471000	9473000	One last...
9473000	9477000	You could also do like on a payment... I can't speak.
9477000	9479000	A payment plan?
9479000	9481000	Tequila finally caught up with me.
9481000	9484000	Or a responsible credit card.
9485000	9496000	I pre-ordered the Xbox One on my Best Buy credit card and it's like no interest for 18 months so I'm going to be paying that off over the 18 months so I don't get hammered with the interest by then.
9496000	9500000	I'll tell you what happened when we got our PS3, right? Because we bought the top model one and controllers and everything.
9500000	9504000	We used our Discover card. We got $100 rebate back on it.
9504000	9507000	That's right. Discover does cash back, right?
9507000	9511000	It's like for every sum amount you spend, you get a percentage back.
9511000	9517000	And in this case too, because Dan also was a GameStop manager, he got a discount on hardware and the games.
9517000	9521000	So we actually ended up getting it for cheaper than the lower model.
9523000	9525000	I miss those days.
9525000	9527000	Anyway, where was I?
9528000	9538000	One last thing. No need to upgrade those PCs anymore. The consoles have high-end PC specs on a unified platform which will allow the devs to create high-end PC games for those consoles. Thank you, Sam.
9538000	9543000	Yeah, except I can't use Photoshop on my Xbox. So, wrong.
9543000	9545000	Yet.
9545000	9549000	No. I cannot effectively use Photoshop.
9549000	9551000	What if they hack it?
9551000	9557000	That's not true, actually. The next iteration of Photoshop is actually going to be in the cloud.
9557000	9561000	Like I said, effectively use it.
9561000	9563000	Keyboard and mouse support.
9563000	9567000	Think about, though, using a higher-end monitor.
9567000	9569000	It supports 4K output.
9569000	9573000	You could get a really good level of precision, possibly.
9573000	9575000	But I can't use a controller.
9575000	9577000	Humor the thought.
9577000	9587000	I like having my window open while I am looking at my Tumblr and chatting with Becky and playing with Kat and, you know...
9587000	9589000	And wondering why you never got your project done.
9589000	9593000	Do you know what I had to draw the other day?
9593000	9595000	What?
9595000	9597000	A turkey drinking beer.
9597000	9599000	Random.
9599000	9601000	It was awesome.
9601000	9603000	And here I am, high on Robitussin, drawing a turkey drinking beer.
9603000	9605000	It's for charity.
9605000	9609000	Which, by the way, thank you, Matt, so much for... Grandpa Matt.
9609000	9613000	But yeah, I think what you're sort of forgetting to do...
9613000	9615000	Did somebody literally hire you?
9615000	9617000	No.
9617000	9619000	I'm doing pro bono work.
9619000	9621000	It goes in my portfolio.
9621000	9623000	I'm not knocking...
9623000	9625000	Charity is good.
9625000	9627000	It's good. And I'm not knocking anything that's gonna...
9627000	9629000	You've done great stuff for Unloud, too, so it's all charity.
9629000	9633000	I'm not gonna knock anything, especially that's going to feed the homeless.
9633000	9637000	And as soon as I get the okay about this, I will say something on the show.
9637000	9639000	Okay.
9639000	9645000	But at any rate, you've got a lot more versatility with a PC.
9645000	9649000	I'm just putting it there. Multitasking on a PC? Far easier.
9649000	9655000	You know, I think the game system should be dedicated towards only the entertainment purposes.
9655000	9661000	And for the record, I can play Star Trek online and watch episodes of Supernatural at the same time, so shut up.
9661000	9665000	Now, I wasn't really hearing enough of the why in that email.
9665000	9669000	I was hearing you should support Microsoft because you're a gamer, but why?
9669000	9671000	I'm supporting Sony because I'm a gamer.
9671000	9673000	Then Microsoft should support me, too.
9673000	9679000	And those old policies, I think they supported corporate interests, they didn't support me.
9679000	9681000	Call me whatever name you want in the book.
9681000	9687000	I just believe that when you invest $60 in the game, it should be up to you what you do with that game when you're done with it and not Microsoft.
9687000	9689000	Period.
9690000	9699000	As an adult consumer, I sat and looked at them, even after Microsoft did their backpedal, and looked at them side by side and said,
9699000	9705000	What is going to be the better use of my money? What's going to give me more of what I want and less of what I don't?
9705000	9715000	But I respect your opinion, emailer, and I think we will hear more about this, and I don't think we'll really have the answer to this whole console war
9716000	9721000	until we know more about what this is going to look like day one, because we still don't know what day these are coming out.
9721000	9723000	We don't know what games they're making launch.
9723000	9725000	There's still a lot of nebulas on both sides.
9725000	9728000	And in the end, I'm grown up. I do what I want.
9732000	9734000	Okay, a guy got logged out of chat, too.
9734000	9737000	Um, hey, OLR, before getting—oh, God, this one's long.
9738000	9739000	That's what she said.
9741000	9742000	Or he.
9745000	9747000	The stairs she gave Rob.
9747000	9749000	Rob got the A-D-S.
9749000	9751000	Hey, OLR. Hey.
9751000	9760000	Before—before getting into the meat of this letter, I'd like to send my condolences to the family, friends, and associates of David, Knuckles, Dawson, Drueger for their loss.
9760000	9766000	The loss of a person that meant so much to so many people is saddening and helps to put things in perspective.
9766000	9770000	All the anger and hate on both sides of the Xbox One debate seems to be meaningless in times like this.
9770000	9775000	While it never truly gets better, the pain eases with time, especially if you hold onto the memories of who that person was.
9776000	9778000	With that said, it's time to get to the point.
9779000	9789000	With the Xbox One's draconian DRM policies being reversed, there are many people, including Bobby Blackwell and Cliff Bleszinski, who are looking at the consumer's victory as a horrible loss of innovation.
9789000	9791000	I already know how this email is signed.
9793000	9794000	But go on.
9794000	9795000	Yeah.
9796000	9798000	I'm gonna read it. Every gamer has a voice.
9798000	9799000	Every gamer has a voice.
9800000	9804000	Bobby was particularly sarcastic bordering on Spyful earlier tonight.
9804000	9807000	Why don't you send Bobby this letter, not us?
9807000	9808000	Keep going.
9808000	9815000	These people have gotten on my tam nerves and have gotten to the point where I can barely stand to see or hear their exclusive ravings.
9815000	9822000	The narrative they seem to be sticking to is we're blocking, quote, progress and imperiling the industry.
9822000	9825000	My anger towards this is for one simple reason.
9825000	9828000	I do not oppose the existence of digital distribution.
9828000	9831000	While I don't use DRM- God stop.
9832000	9836000	While I don't use DRM-based services like Steam, I don't even oppose their existence.
9836000	9840000	I understand a lot of people like Steam and that's fine. It just isn't for me.
9840000	9846000	However, the Xbox One was designed in such a way to take away the choice of the traditional disc-based games.
9846000	9852000	People like myself, who enjoy a more flexible model of physical distribution, were upset because we didn't want it taken away.
9852000	9860000	We didn't want to take away digital for those of you who prefer that, but the way Bobby Black Wolf, Shadow Next Gen, and the light go on.
9860000	9861000	Oh God, I'm sorry.
9861000	9868000	You think we're all some rabid luddites in mud huts trying our best to destroy any purpose at all costs.
9868000	9870000	Okay. Ah, ah, ah, ah. Nope, nope, nope.
9870000	9872000	When I saw the rest of it.
9872000	9874000	Where was that? Okay, look, look.
9874000	9875000	I respect-
9875000	9877000	This is a reaction, not an action.
9877000	9886000	I respect your passionate opinion. However, I'm losing respect for this email and the way you're lashing out.
9886000	9892000	Because come on, Bobby didn't say that in that way.
9892000	9895000	And this whole thing with the mud huts is a come on.
9896000	9907000	I get your point. Like, I understand the whole, like, I feel like consumers are trying to take away what's rightfully mine and all this stuff.
9907000	9908000	Like, I get that.
9908000	9918000	But I also understand why Bobby was like, but there's new ideas we're not going to get to see because the internet got what they wanted.
9918000	9928000	But nowhere in that did I necessarily hear that he thought that that was like a bad thing or a horrible thing or gamers are doomed or that's, you know, or whatever.
9928000	9930000	Can I interject?
9930000	9931000	Yeah, of course.
9931000	9934000	Shadow next gen. I made the email awesome. High fives, black wolf.
9937000	9938000	Oh, God.
9938000	9945000	Bobby and Chad is responding right now saying, I'm happy we can get back to talking about the games. And I think that's a good way to put it.
9945000	9947000	I'm trying to see if there's anything-
9947000	9956000	I just, like, the Cliffy B thing, I'm okay with you dragging him a little bit because Cliffy B can be a little bit bullheaded with his opinions.
9956000	9964000	But my point is that these other guys are calling out in your email. They're not so bullheaded. Like, you know, but they do have some different opinions.
9964000	9972000	Yes, they are supporting Microsoft because they think a little differently about this stuff. And I don't think that makes them anti-consumer or anti anything.
9972000	9974000	They're just different.
9974000	9990000	What I was reading further into this email is that I think that, I'll go ahead and say it, Rawsteel UT, is under the impression that there is a backlash against people who prefer the traditional method of distribution.
9990000	10002000	Saying that because of people like you, we can't have this. We are being made to suffer because you have, in our opinion, an antiquated point of view.
10003000	10005000	Oh, and I did see some of that on Twitter this week.
10005000	10006000	Yes.
10006000	10008000	Not from the individuals you named, however.
10008000	10016000	And he is trying to say, no, I don't care about digital distribution. I don't like to be limited to digital distribution.
10016000	10019000	And I agree with you. I think there should be both.
10019000	10026000	I think that they can have both methods. They can have their online model. They can have a disk-based model. Make the online model cheaper.
10027000	10035000	If you're going to pay for physical materials, then pay for physical materials and the cost of shipping. You want it physical, deal with it physically.
10035000	10046000	I buy PC games in equal measure, digital and physical. For example, when I went on my rampage to find Mass Effect 3 before I found out how bad it was. Not bad.
10046000	10056000	It's fun to play. It's just story-wise. I got Best Buy to knock down the price. And I got a physical copy because I got the better deal for it and I have to pay shipping.
10056000	10069000	So by the same token, if it had been 20 bucks on sale on Steam or something, which it would have been on Steam, but that's just my point, I would have bought it on Steam in a heartbeat.
10069000	10073000	I would have bought whatever one suited my financial purposes better.
10074000	10084000	Let me say exactly what Bobby was saying in a different way now that we've got that out there. And I'm saying that I agree with you that we should also have the disk-based game and the digital game.
10084000	10092000	And Bobby, I'm going to do my best to sum up what you were saying. As far as the digital distribution goes, Steam is really the king of that right now.
10092000	10099000	And if Microsoft had been able to go down that route, Steam would have had a little bit of competition and that competition would have been healthy for the industry.
10099000	10111000	But because the consumer spoke up and said, we want our disks and we want it this way, we will never know what digital 2.0, for lack of a better term, will look like.
10111000	10119000	I don't think Bobby feels or even Shadow Next Gen feels that that's somebody's fault or it's because of whining or something like that.
10119000	10128000	But it goes without saying, we're not going to know what that future of digital looks like right now because we just weren't ready for it.
10128000	10138000	However, my perspective is, why can't we just have both? And I think that's what Microsoft should work on next.
10138000	10148000	And Chat Room, I would encourage you not to basically talk shit about Rosco, UT behind his back. That is immature, unnecessary. You can talk about his attitude.
10148000	10154000	You can disagree with the points that he's made, but don't dismiss somebody's opinion.
10154000	10161000	He has a valid point from his point of view, although I think it's short-sighted.
10161000	10165000	I will go ahead and read his last paragraph.
10165000	10166000	Go ahead.
10166000	10172000	As to the Xbox One now, I'm still not getting it because of the camera, where he and I are in the same boat there.
10172000	10182000	I'm not afraid of the potential for spying as it can be used offline. However, that Microsoft has the balls to ask me to pay $100 more for a console they've already admitted is weaker than the PS4.
10182000	10189000	Not only that, but the PS4 will likely have more exclusive when all is said and done. When MS drops the Kinect and the price to go with it.
10189000	10196000	Between the PS4 and the Wii U, I have more than enough gaming to go for the next six to eight years without Microsoft.
10196000	10199000	Anyway, thanks for reading. Hope you all have a good day. Regards, Rosco, UT.
10199000	10206000	And like I said, I think that what I'm seeing going on is a bit of hard-headedness on multiple sides.
10206000	10207000	Right.
10207000	10212000	I think that he's got a misperception of what, you know, Bobby and everybody's saying.
10212000	10218000	And I think at the same time, maybe there's a bit of a misperception of where he's coming from.
10218000	10219000	Right.
10219000	10222000	So I think people just need to sit down, drop the attitude, and talk.
10222000	10230000	I agree. And I need to say this in defense of my friend and my associate, Bobby Blackwolf.
10231000	10234000	You don't know the half of what Bobby's been dealing with this week.
10234000	10240000	And Bobby puts on the show that he does, you know, out of love for the gaming industry.
10240000	10241000	Totally.
10241000	10246000	And Bobby does not deserve some of what you gave him tonight. Play nice.
10246000	10247000	Yeah.
10247000	10254000	Celebrate the different opinions. Come, you know, talk respectfully amongst each other and try to learn from each other.
10254000	10257000	Don't throw fits and walk off.
10257000	10261000	I would have stopped reading where I did, regardless, if you hadn't called it.
10261000	10266000	But I did think, though, he brought up the valid point with the last paragraph. Just saying.
10266000	10267000	No, I agree.
10267000	10268000	I agree with that, too.
10268000	10276000	They all have valid points. Where every gamer has a point. You have a valid point. And you have a valid point. And you have a valid point.
10277000	10286000	You know, and this is my big thing again, I really hate when people try to single other people out.
10286000	10291000	As you know, he was accusing in his letter, I didn't go too far into that part.
10291000	10297000	He was accusing him and people like him of being the scapegoat being turned into scapegoats.
10297000	10301000	I think you're sort of doing the same thing. So, yeah, that's that. Yeah.
10301000	10303000	That's my kind of my point. Exactly.
10303000	10318000	You need to, I think, and this actually goes with any issue, anything that people have this big disagreements on, whether it be social, political, religious, video games, shit that does not matter, shit that does matter.
10318000	10326000	Respect that people are going to be out there that think differently from you and make your approach to where you were trying to understand them.
10326000	10332000	With anything. You don't know what you're talking about until you've walked into the other person's shoes.
10332000	10339000	For the record, though, Cliffy B never has a valid point. No, he doesn't. So how about last email?
10339000	10341000	I just want to make sure that was clear.
10341000	10349000	Dear OLR disclaimer, please excuse any and all grammatical errors. I guess for you I could do it, lady.
10349000	10357000	First off, I'd like to say you guys do an amazing job. Love the show as always. This week makes 10 years since my father passed away.
10357000	10361000	I'm sorry. And I will never forget how the show is there for me in my time of need.
10361000	10365000	You guys were always there for others, and I love that about the show.
10365000	10367000	I just wanted to say thanks for everything, you guys.
10367000	10371000	Dark Tetsuya had the pleasure of staying with me for about four weeks. I'm enjoying every moment of it.
10371000	10374000	If it weren't for you guys in the show, I don't think we would have even met.
10374000	10379000	Thanks again, you guys. Sincerely, gamer girl. This is Michelle.
10379000	10389000	And she and I have had a few talks in our time over many things, and she hasn't had an easy time with some things.
10389000	10393000	So I'm glad that we could be there for you. I'm glad that you've become friends of ours.
10393000	10399000	And I'm certainly glad that you and DT have found the happy hookup.
10399000	10403000	Which is so... I don't want to say weird, because that makes it a negative.
10403000	10406000	It's a happy weird. It's a good weird. Like me, a good weird.
10406000	10407000	Unexpected.
10407000	10414000	It's weird in a good way to me, like the impact that this show has had on that level.
10414000	10417000	Where people's lives have been affected by this.
10417000	10418000	It's uncanny.
10418000	10419000	So...
10419000	10420000	How's that, Rob? Un-canny.
10420000	10422000	Yeah, I don't... I mean, it's...
10422000	10423000	There are no cans here.
10423000	10429000	It's amazing. I mean, in a way. I mean, I knew Allen on LiveJournal for years.
10429000	10434000	But it wasn't really until he started listening to this show that he started to get to know me better.
10434000	10438000	And now we live in sin.
10438000	10443000	I'm glad you're adopting that. We were talking about that before the show.
10443000	10445000	When Prop 8's overturned.
10445000	10447000	We hope. We hope.
10447000	10448000	Well, it's gonna happen.
10448000	10450000	It's only a matter of time.
10450000	10455000	Even if it's not the Supreme Court that does it, it'll just go back to a vote and it'll get overturned then.
10455000	10462000	But I was saying that instead of answering the, when you're gonna get married, you should say, we're gonna live in sin.
10462000	10468000	The thing I dread most when Prop 8 gets overturned is that I'm just gonna get that nod.
10468000	10471000	So when are you and Allen gonna get married? When are you and Allen gonna get married?
10471000	10474000	And it's like, when we're damn good and ready.
10474000	10479000	But Jamie said I should answer that question. We enjoy living in sin.
10479000	10481000	I like that.
10484000	10493000	Oh, yeah. You know, I was actually gonna say, you know, I think when people start sort of discounting the whole internet thing.
10493000	10497000	Keep in mind, I met my husband online. Okay?
10497000	10510000	Dan and I were two dumb, young, twinny anime nerds that liked playing Street Fighter and talking about the Japanese versions of Marvel superheroes.
10510000	10517000	And, you know, he liked pinball and I thought pinball was cool. And then just we talked it out.
10517000	10523000	And six months after we started talking on the phone, I was like, hey, I'm about to lose my job. Can I come live with you?
10523000	10532000	I guess. I'm gonna go see Batman, which is pretty much how that conversation went. And I was on a plane, you know, a month later.
10532000	10539000	I met Dan when his username was DarkRioga and I was Dark Uchon. How's that?
10541000	10545000	I actually had Dark Uchon before I had Dark Sakura, just saying.
10546000	10550000	So Ranma calls me by my oldest, oldest nickname.
10551000	10558000	So, how, you know, you met Alan online, although didn't you have a previous sort of meeting?
10559000	10565000	No, we knew each other on LiveJournal. Alan and I knew each other on the website LiveJournal, which I realize some of you don't even know.
10565000	10572000	But we were just friends on there. I don't even remember how we got friended. Alan! He has to be hearing this. Alan!
10573000	10574000	Excuse me.
10574000	10575000	Does he have headphones on?
10575000	10576000	It's a night of honesty.
10576000	10584000	Oh, here he is. Alan, since we're all drunk, we're having real talk. How did we meet on LiveJournal? Like, how did we become friends on LiveJournal? Because I honest to God can't remember.
10586000	10590000	It was through comments of either Slagkicks Journal or Spikes Journal.
10591000	10592000	Oh, wow.
10592000	10593000	Yeah.
10593000	10595000	So, are friends over at GameBooey.org?
10596000	10597000	Yeah.
10598000	10611000	I think you friended me through the comments there and we got to know each other for a few years that way. But, like, you were my friend on LiveJournal through the whole X who shall not be named Voldemort.
10614000	10616000	Republican Voldemort relationship.
10616000	10618000	I knew it and you exactly knew who you were talking about.
10618000	10623000	I had. It's like you knew me then and you kind of saw that play out. But then we didn't-
10623000	10625000	Hey, he gave me a sparkly pin.
10626000	10631000	We didn't meet until we met at Video Games Live in Oakland, right?
10632000	10644000	That barely counts because we shook hands and then the lights went down to suggest, to show, to say that the show was starting. So, but yeah, we got to look at each other then.
10645000	10651000	And then when did you, you started listening to OLR and then that's when we started talking more and writing?
10651000	10652000	Yeah.
10652000	10654000	So, this show, Ruining Lives.
10655000	10656000	By the way-
10656000	10657000	Bringing them together.
10657000	10660000	They're asking if RuPaul would be the Reverend and I said no, Peter's Christ.
10660000	10661000	No, no.
10662000	10666000	Since Jamie said RuPaul, do you know that Raven and Jujubee are playing about that tonight?
10667000	10674000	Yes, I'm aware. So, I just want you all to know I'm skipping drag queens to be here for the 11th birthday. That's how much I love you all.
10675000	10676000	They're amazing.
10677000	10679000	Who, the drag queens or the listeners?
10679000	10680000	Everybody.
10680000	10681000	Everybody.
10682000	10683000	What a safe answer.
10684000	10685000	I love him. All right.
10686000	10697000	So, so yeah, anyone who ever wants to poo poo on the internet say, fuck you. People get married on the internet or together or they get together on the internet joined, joined. That's good, we're joined.
10698000	10699000	Live in sin.
10700000	10704000	Live in sin. I lived in sin with Dan for seven years and then we finally just said, fuck it.
10705000	10706000	Nothing wrong with a little sin.
10707000	10708000	Yeah. I like sin.
10708000	10709000	Are we?
10709000	10710000	It tastes like tequila.
10711000	10718000	It's 9.30 and we need to keep the show moving. So, let's get to the FUs. Oh, mailbag at orangesontrated.com if you want to send us an email.
10719000	10720000	That's it. I'm not reading anymore.
10721000	10722000	That was it though, wasn't it?
10723000	10724000	That's pretty much it.
10725000	10726000	All right. Mailbag at orangesontrated.com. In the meanwhile, FUs of the week. Let's try to make them quick.
10739000	10740000	This is fucked up.
10742000	10749000	I would like to say FU to the collision detection on JB Mon's body for hitting his tattoo.
10750000	10756000	And the stupid bitch face. And I'm saying bitch face because I don't know who the fuck it was, but whatever.
10757000	10764000	Okay, people, I don't know if it's a California thing or what, but when people change lanes and they're on the inside lane, you're supposed to stay in the inside lane.
10765000	10770000	When you are on the outside part of the turn lane, you're supposed to go into the second lane, not the third.
10771000	10774000	Well, bitch face decides to go from the inside lane into the second lane where I was.
10775000	10780000	Where I was legally because you're not supposed to change lanes in the fucking intersection. Fuck. Okay.
10782000	10783000	Care to follow that, JB Mon?
10784000	10785000	Fuck.
10786000	10791000	FUs and myself because the tequila is just hitting me now and I forgot the FU that I had to land.
10792000	10793000	Sure you're going to be able to drive?
10794000	10795000	Maybe.
10796000	10797000	We better talk later. Alright.
10800000	10801000	Loki.
10801000	10802000	Fuck you, the pointers.
10803000	10804000	Oh, you and your programming.
10806000	10810000	And my FU of the week goes to having to get up at 6.30 tomorrow for the job.
10811000	10813000	But I love my job, but I don't like getting up early for it, that's all.
10814000	10818000	Alright, just a couple quick stories for you guys. We got to get to the Skypline. Loki.
10818000	10825000	Real quick, there was an opinion piece on Polygon and I just thought it kind of brought up an interesting point.
10826000	10833000	They're talking about Microsoft and Sony and kind of Microsoft backpedaling in their DRM focus and stuff like that.
10834000	10847000	And they're saying that while this is a good thing right now, there is a very good chance that they're going to introduce some fun features like the game sharing and stuff to kind of draw people more to digital.
10848000	10850000	Where they're going to implement this DRM.
10851000	10867000	So that basically, very well now we have a good situation where the consumer feels like it has a lot of power that this could very well change over time to kind of be back to where they wanted it to be in the first place.
10868000	10873000	I don't know if that's going to actually happen. I think a lot of people would be kind of hesitant.
10874000	10879000	Once again, it's all about how they explain how they're going to do things.
10880000	10892000	If they have a good way of explaining it and basically it makes it well worth it as far as the incentives to going this route, then by all means I guess they could try doing that.
10892000	10898000	If there's enough pluses to it versus the negatives, then it's just going to have to weigh it.
10901000	10909000	I don't think that they're going to go back like that, but I do think that they may bring back some of the features that they took away from the Xbox One.
10910000	10912000	Maybe the game sharing and stuff like that.
10913000	10919000	Although, if it was what the rumor would be from that pay spin or whatever and it was just a demo, that's kind of lame anyways.
10919000	10923000	I mean, they do that with PlayStation Plus where you get demos for a bunch of games.
10924000	10929000	All I'm going to say, again, the simplest way I can put it, what are the positives to outweigh the negatives?
10930000	10931000	Exactly.
10931000	10933000	Explain that better, you'll get it.
10935000	10940000	Alright, real quick, because I want to get to our Skype line at 1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
10941000	10945000	Real quick tonight, because we're running long due to the technical difficulties in the studio earlier.
10945000	10949000	And I apologize because it is an anniversary episode, so I'm sure there's a few of you that want to call in.
10950000	10955000	But quickly, quickly on this story here, EA is confirming no online passes.
10956000	10959000	Even in spite of the news this week, online passes will not be coming back.
10960000	10966000	This is from Senior Director of Corporate Communications John Riesberg for EA.
10966000	10970000	Quote, there is no change to our decision to discontinue online pass. It is dead.
10971000	10976000	As we said a few weeks ago, none of our new EA titles will include online pass and we are removing it from existing games as well.
10977000	10982000	Nothing else on today's news, but did want to be clear that our online pass decision was based on player feedback and there's no change.
10983000	10984000	Long live the Cloud Pass.
10985000	10990000	Hallelujah. Oh yeah, the Cloud Pass. Don't talk like that.
10990000	10997000	Don't talk like that. Alright. 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio if you'd like to give us a call.
10998000	11003000	And yeah, we'll get to the phones there. Meanwhile, Twitter topics and last minute stories.
11004000	11012000	I bet you didn't know that today, this day, is actually the 22nd birthday of Sonic the Hedgehog.
11013000	11015000	That's right. I heard we share a birthday with Sonic.
11016000	11017000	It's that 23 thing, you know?
11017000	11023000	Did you know that I flew out here on the 23rd of January? No, I didn't know that. Years and years ago.
11024000	11026000	Well, I probably did know that, but I just forgot.
11027000	11029000	Jeez, Rab. Jeez.
11030000	11031000	We've been out here 15 years, jeez.
11032000	11036000	Our phones are lighting up, so let's go to them and see who's online. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
11037000	11040000	You know, you wanted to go see Raven, but you got me instead. Raven's Dolphin.
11041000	11043000	What up, Raven's Dolphin? Hi. It's video.
11043000	11045000	I love special occasions. I know now you get to see the video.
11046000	11048000	And he has ponies, I'm leaving the room.
11049000	11051000	That's exactly why I called, but let's not talk about them.
11052000	11053000	You're a brony, it's cool, it's cool.
11054000	11055000	I didn't say that.
11056000	11057000	I don't know, alright.
11058000	11059000	That's not true.
11060000	11065000	I see two big dolls, and I see one, two, three, four little ones, and two little, what are those hamsters? I can't tell, it's fuzzy.
11066000	11068000	I would forgive you if you had a classic one up there.
11069000	11071000	I promise you, there won't be any talk about that.
11071000	11078000	Alright, fair enough. Well, Raven's Dolphin, I love special episodes because it's the only time you ever call in anymore, so what's on your mind, buddy?
11079000	11084000	You make it sound like, oh, Raven just shows up to special events. I listened, I listened to you guys.
11085000	11087000	No, there's nothing wrong with that. I'm just razzing you. What's up, buddy?
11088000	11092000	You know, I wanted to talk about the whole DRM thing. I know everyone wants to talk about that.
11092000	11093000	Of course.
11094000	11100000	For me, for me being a gamer so long is, I didn't like how Microsoft's tone to everything.
11101000	11112000	Like, when they said about the submarines, about the people like, oh, we got a box for you, the 360, or when they say all kinds of draconian shit, it makes me, my head just explodes.
11113000	11119000	I'm like, you're drowning yourself, so their tone for me is why I bought a PlayStation 4.
11119000	11125000	Hmm. How did you feel when you heard about the reversal, though, despite that tone?
11126000	11133000	I mean, I know Bobby wanted to push innovation and all that stuff, and I get that. I totally get Bobby's point. I've listened to him, you know.
11134000	11139000	But the reversal, I think, was key. Like, people are like, but this is going to slow growth.
11140000	11150000	But Microsoft tried to force us into what I think of a future that wasn't ready. For me, I wasn't ready for that future because I like my internet connection.
11151000	11156000	I like all that stuff, but I live with a bunch of jackasses that can take it away from me in two seconds.
11157000	11163000	So for me, it's like I have this thing that is a brick. I know. Your family don't have this, but my family is fucked up about the internet.
11164000	11173000	What did I say earlier in the show about diversity and everyone's life is different and it affects those opinions that we have, you know? Certainly.
11174000	11183000	Yes, so it would be a big, shiny $500 brick. So for me, it's like the offline mode. You know, the online is important, but I don't want to be married to it.
11184000	11194000	I think that's fair. Well, okay, you said you pre-ordered a PlayStation 4. I'm sorry, you said you're going to get a PlayStation 4. So what are you looking forward to on PlayStation 4?
11195000	11200000	You know, believe it or not, I'm looking forward to absolutely none of the exclusives Battlefield 4.
11201000	11206000	That's fair, though. You know, the third-party games are important, too.
11206000	11216000	And I do a lot of you streaming stuff, so I'm like, that's why I want to get that. I'm like, well, it's the cheapest, Battlefield 4, it's going to look great. It was a done deal.
11217000	11218000	The games will come.
11219000	11224000	Alright, fair enough. Sounds good to me. I'll see you online because I ordered a PlayStation 4 as well.
11225000	11231000	I know we have to go, but one more thing. I mean, just one more thing. You're still sticking with the PS4, even with the reversal?
11232000	11233000	Yes.
11234000	11235000	Same here, same here.
11236000	11243000	No, no, I agree with Rob. I thought I was going to come in here and I'm like, oh, Rob's going to switch. Oh, Rob's going to switch.
11244000	11251000	No, why would I switch? All the games I won are on PlayStation 4 as well. There's a handful of Xbox-only games, but I can address that in 2014 when they'll actually be out.
11252000	11254000	Because I know me and you, we're excited for Killer Instinct.
11255000	11262000	Killer Instinct, the way it is, especially because Rare is not developing it, really just isn't enough for me. It's not $100 good.
11263000	11264000	I agree. Totally agree.
11264000	11271000	And I'm not hating on Microsoft. I mean, as I've been telling people that are like, oh, you're Sony fanboy and so forth, I'm like, hey, attention everybody.
11272000	11280000	I bought Xbox 360 at launch and I bought PlayStation 3 a year after it launched. So I'm just doing the reverse this time. What's wrong with that?
11281000	11289000	Nothing. And for me, it came down to the price and I said, okay, this works out for me. I just had enough money. When they said $400, I went like, sold. Where's GameStop?
11289000	11300000	It's the price. And I'm going to be honest, I think Xbox One is going to be under pressure to drop that price. Maybe not holiday, but in 2014, around the time I'm looking to get one.
11301000	11313000	And that's probably when I'll finally pick one up. Despite what folks may be saying otherwise about Kinect and so forth, I just kind of think the $499 price won't last forever, just like the $599 on PlayStation 3 didn't.
11314000	11316000	Nope. It dropped like a rock. Thank you for your time.
11316000	11319000	You are welcome, Ravenstaufen. Always a delight to hear from you. You take care.
11320000	11321000	I will. Bye.
11322000	11326000	Let's get to some more calls. Our phone lines are lighting up. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
11327000	11328000	Hey, it's Drew. How you guys doing?
11329000	11331000	Oh my gosh, Drew. Intern Drew.
11332000	11333000	And happy birthday to you, sir.
11334000	11340000	Happy birthday to you. Three hours left. Your show, well, I don't know about your show, but our show,
11341000	11342000	It's the Drew show.
11343000	11345000	Our show and your life share the same birthday.
11346000	11348000	It's the Drew show. Sorry, Drew.
11349000	11351000	So you're 30 now, right?
11352000	11353000	Twenty-eight.
11354000	11355000	Thirty-thirty.
11356000	11357000	Oh my gosh.
11358000	11360000	Holy crap. I mean, I was 17 when we started out.
11361000	11362000	That is nuts.
11363000	11364000	Our former young Republican.
11365000	11369000	I remember when you were 18 and that blows my fucking mind. But anyway, this isn't about me.
11370000	11372000	I remember when you were legal to drink and that was hilarious.
11373000	11374000	What did you call in about tonight?
11375000	11378000	I was just going to chime in on the whole.
11379000	11381000	It's a hot topic these days.
11382000	11388000	The Xbox One versus PS4 thing with Microsoft doing the whole back barrel.
11389000	11393000	It's going to be the hot topic for about four more months until these consoles are out.
11394000	11395000	So by all means, five more months.
11396000	11398000	Oh, geez. You know, I'm still not convinced.
11399000	11402000	Honest. They thought they could float it past us, didn't they?
11402000	11406000	They thought, oh, this is going to be the next big thing. This is going to change the future of gaming.
11407000	11408000	After all, Steam is doing it.
11409000	11411000	The difference is, Steam started from nothing.
11412000	11417000	Steam had something going there that kind of changed the way we look at PC gaming.
11418000	11420000	I don't think that console gaming is ready for this at all.
11421000	11423000	They might not ever be.
11424000	11428000	Am I understanding you correctly that you're saying you reject both these consoles right now?
11428000	11431000	If I was going to go for it, I'd go for PS4.
11432000	11436000	But for practical reasons, I've got a whole bunch of PS3 games in Backlog right now.
11437000	11440000	I only jumped on PS3 in October.
11441000	11443000	So I've got a whole bunch of catch-up to do.
11444000	11446000	But if I had to choose and came into it, it'd probably be a PS4.
11447000	11448000	You know, I think we do...
11449000	11452000	Although it sounds like if you were going to be getting one, you get the PlayStation 4.
11453000	11456000	I think we oftentimes have been ignoring in the script.
11456000	11459000	I think we oftentimes have been ignoring in this great debate...
11460000	11462000	Debate plus battle equals debattle.
11463000	11466000	In this great debattle that we're having about PlayStation 4 versus Xbox One,
11467000	11469000	I think we oftentimes forget that there are many people, yourself included,
11470000	11472000	and probably many of our chatters that are like,
11473000	11474000	You know what? I'm not getting either one this year.
11475000	11480000	I'm going to just stick with the consoles I have because I got Grand Theft Auto 5 and Saints Row 4.
11481000	11484000	Was it just this week they even announced that Thief is going to be on PS3 and Xbox 360?
11484000	11487000	Yeah, a lot of stuff is still coming out on the current consoles.
11488000	11489000	So where's my real incentive to upgrade?
11490000	11491000	Maybe I'm just not ready until 2015.
11492000	11494000	I'm not a first-day adapter for a lot of consoles.
11495000	11498000	I got burned the first time around when I got the DS app the first time.
11499000	11502000	That had a hell of a sort of game library, didn't it?
11503000	11506000	Yeah, I think there's a lot of people in your camp. There is.
11507000	11510000	Yeah, you know, I subscribe to, you know, Jamie's mantra.
11511000	11513000	Game is only good as the games, uh, systems only good as the games are honest.
11514000	11518000	And for the most part, I'm not impressed with Xbox One yet.
11519000	11521000	And I'm not impressed by the PS4.
11522000	11523000	Like, okay, fine. Kingdom Hearts 3.
11524000	11526000	After you've got 15 sequels, you can finally count to three.
11527000	11528000	Okay, fine. Show me more.
11529000	11532000	And maybe I'll get it when it comes out, what, two, three years later?
11533000	11534000	And it has legs?
11534000	11535000	So for you-
11536000	11539000	You know how I'm waiting on my free order for, uh, Tell the Zillion.
11540000	11542000	So for you, you want the games to be out there.
11543000	11546000	You want the games to be in your hand and then you can have a discussion about the consoles.
11547000	11549000	Yeah, why else would you get a console?
11550000	11551000	You want the games, right?
11552000	11553000	That's a good question.
11554000	11555000	I'm not impressed yet.
11556000	11558000	Alright, well, Drew, I gotta wrap up and let you go, but any other final thoughts for us?
11559000	11562000	Yeah, it's been a wild ride so far. Hope it keeps on going.
11562000	11568000	Alright, you should come visit the show sometime. I have a nice solid table that the soundboard sits on so you can't knock it over.
11569000	11570000	We interned Bruce to see you.
11575000	11576000	Alright, take care, Drew. I gotta let you go.
11577000	11578000	Peace.
11578000	11579000	Bye.
11580000	11583000	The phone calls are always a little spotty, too.
11583000	11593000	Shadownextgen in chat says, Rob, could it be argued that your incentive to upgrade to next-gen disappeared with Microsoft's reversal? Just a question.
11594000	11600000	Um, I'm not exactly sure what you mean by that because, I mean, especially when it comes to Microsoft.
11601000	11605000	Microsoft does have some exclusive games that I want to check out at some point.
11606000	11607000	They're not gonna be out at launch.
11607000	11619000	To be fair, PlayStation 3 is not gonna have all their exclusives out at launch either, but I still feel like there'll be enough third-party stuff where I'm just gonna opt for PlayStation 3 at first because, honestly, it's the cheaper option.
11620000	11629000	There's one exclusive, actually, that Microsoft had, Titanfall, that actually, this week, the news that it's multiplayer only kind of makes me don't want to buy it.
11630000	11631000	I didn't even know that.
11632000	11633000	Yeah, I just heard this week there's no single-player campaign.
11634000	11635000	I am less excited about that game now.
11635000	11643000	Interesting. Okay, let me get back to some more calls because our phone is being off the hook. There's lots of people trying to get through, so I'm hoping we can get as many calls as we can tonight.
11644000	11645000	Hi, on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?
11646000	11650000	Well, it's the one and only Ranma, and, you know, we can't have a birthday celebration without the normal tradition.
11651000	11652000	Oh, you missed it.
11652000	11653000	I like your hat.
11653000	11654000	You missed it in part A, Ranma.
11654000	11655000	Oh, my God, I need to see your hat.
11656000	11657000	My fellow New Yorker.
11658000	11660000	That is awesome. You've totally inspired me to make a hat.
11661000	11663000	It's not. It's a sailor. What sailor is that?
11663000	11664000	It's an Artemis hat.
11665000	11666000	Oh, an Artemis hat.
11667000	11668000	Yes, it is.
11669000	11670000	Okay, all right.
11671000	11686000	You know, you guys had me cracking up this whole episode. Before I get into what I called in for, let me just say this. I wish we had an Arby's and a Hardee's here in New York, and I would have loved to have seen Microsoft roll out the whole way it is going to do with the games.
11686000	11698000	Because it's really been funny if, let's say, Kingdom Hearts 3 comes out for both systems, you go into the store, PlayStation 4 version, $59.99, Xbox One version, $39.99. Talk about a slap in the face.
11699000	11709000	Now, Nat, that would have been a one-up in the war. I would have loved to see if game prices start changing, and that would have been the huge plus, and I think I said that in an earlier episode.
11709000	11717000	If DRM policies, heck yeah, sure, bring them on if it's going to slice all my new game prices in half, but we all know that's not going to happen.
11718000	11728000	For the record, Rama, I believe both companies have come out and said $59.99 is the ceiling for their game prices, outside of collector's editions and all that.
11729000	11736000	So we're going to be looking at game prices similar to what we have this generation, except now Nintendo's in that club, too, because Wii U games are also $59.99.
11736000	11741000	Although some buck the trend. Game and Wario today, only $39.99.
11742000	11743000	Yeah, pretty much.
11744000	11745000	So anyway, Rama.
11746000	11754000	Okay, so here on my table are three different alcohols. We have the 12-year-old Glenn Fittich, because the 15-year-old got killed at PAX East.
11754000	11766000	We have this nice 10-cane rum, and the alcohol that put Jovidea and almost everybody in my room on their ass, Spiritus, which is 192 proof.
11767000	11768000	Oh my god.
11769000	11773000	So you guys get to pick which one I will do the traditional shot for.
11774000	11776000	Spiritus, Spiritus, Spiritus.
11777000	11780000	Actually, I was going to say the Glenn Fittich, because I'm partial to Scotch.
11781000	11782000	You guys are assholes, okay?
11782000	11784000	Hey, I say Glenn Fittich. It's Scotch.
11785000	11787000	Well, it makes half and half.
11788000	11792000	No, you don't make, you do not dilute Glenn Fittich with anything.
11793000	11794000	Then he takes one, then the other.
11795000	11801000	Let the man take his shot. Here he goes. He's pouring it into the glass. 192 proof, ladies and gentlemen.
11802000	11804000	I remember that Fauna making show up for where we polished off a bottle.
11805000	11807000	Twilight Sparkle shot glass, okay?
11808000	11809000	Love it.
11809000	11810000	Good lord.
11810000	11814000	Here's to you, here's to me, the best of friends we'll ever be.
11815000	11819000	If you're ever happy to disagree, well, fuck you guys, and here's to me.
11820000	11821000	Woo!
11822000	11823000	Amazing.
11824000	11825000	Oh. Oh.
11827000	11829000	He just had a Rob moment right there.
11830000	11831000	It's not just me.
11832000	11834000	No, no, that's not as bad as Rob going, running across.
11835000	11836000	Rob ran in circles doing flappy hands.
11837000	11838000	I really did.
11838000	11842000	Rob, do you wonder how strong this is? Go find a bottle of rubbing alcohol and get a quick whiff.
11843000	11849000	No. Keep in mind, you remember what I was raised with, right? Everclear.
11850000	11853000	Have an Everclear story to tell you later.
11854000	11855000	Tell me later.
11856000	11861000	Because you're here now, I want to make sure we get this out because I forgot to do it in part A because of all the other stuff going on tonight with technical failures in 11 years.
11861000	11869000	But in seven days here at the Voice2Geeks network, we are gearing up for something really exciting that you guys are going to be bringing to us over at Anime Jam Session.
11870000	11872000	Do you want to kind of kick off the promotion for that this week, Rama?
11873000	11888000	Why certainly. Well, next Sunday is Senshi Matsuri. It's a Sailor Moon themed anime convention to celebrate the birthday of Usagi Tsukino, which is June 30th, and for the excitement of the new anime and the new merchandise that's coming out.
11888000	11897000	What we're going to do is advertise some of the events that we'll be going on, such as opening, closing ceremonies, and the performance by Senshi Generation as well.
11898000	11901000	Awesome. And that is all going to be streaming here at the Voice2Geeks network.
11902000	11903000	That's right.
11904000	11907000	That's right. So vognetwork.com, Anime Jam Session will be bringing us, can you say the name one more time while I learn it?
11908000	11910000	Sure. It's Senshi Matsuri.
11911000	11915000	Senshi Matsuri will be live at the Voice2Geeks network at bright and early 9 a.m. Pacific.
11916000	11917000	Warrior Festival.
11918000	11919000	That is when that all starts one week from today.
11920000	11923000	And, Rama, I got to admit, your Japanese has come a long way.
11924000	11926000	It really hasn't really. It only took 11 years.
11927000	11929000	Rob's gotten a lot better, but there's still a few things he needs to look at.
11930000	11933000	Never taken a class, but maybe, maybe I will for you guys for the 12 year.
11934000	11936000	All right, Rama, I got to let you go so we can wrap up, but take care, buddy.
11937000	11938000	You stay fabulous.
11939000	11940000	All right, stay black. Bye.
11941000	11943000	All right. Always love hearing from Rama.
11944000	11946000	I am so sorry, you guys. There's like five other people trying to get through.
11947000	11951000	I've got to shut off the phones because it's almost 10 o'clock and some of us have to get home.
11952000	11953000	I am home, thank God.
11954000	11958000	But anyway, very much looking forward to that next Sunday.
11959000	11960000	We got to wrap up.
11961000	11962000	I want to do some Twitter topics quickly.
11963000	11965000	I don't know if you have last minute stories, Loki, while I bring these up.
11965000	11972000	Just that it's rumored that Sony's going to announce more games for next year at Gamescom.
11974000	11978000	Some tweets tonight. TigerClaw305 sends us a few tweets.
11979000	11981000	Miyamoto on women as characters in Nintendo games.
11982000	11988000	I did see this because he talked about not just like women, but like gay characters and so forth in the games.
11988000	11997000	And it did strike me as kind of like a progressive maybe modernizing theme thing.
11998000	12005000	And it talked about how like Peach wasn't really considered until kind of like Peach was a late add into this Mario game that's coming out.
12006000	12009000	But it's a great thing. I'm trying to find a quote here to give here.
12010000	12015000	Oh, I guess for me in particular, the structure of the gameplay always comes before story.
12015000	12021000	And so we're always looking at when we're putting that together, what is the most natural story to take place within that structure?
12022000	12033000	So if we end up creating a gameplay structure where it makes sense for, whether it's a female to go rescue a male or a gay man to rescue a lesbian woman or a lesbian woman to rescue a gay man, we might take that approach.
12034000	12037000	So he just wants it to feel natural in the games.
12038000	12041000	I want my lesbian from Animal Crossing to be a hero.
12042000	12043000	Someday.
12043000	12044000	I'm crossing lesbian the game.
12045000	12051000	I guess I also kind of get the sense that like maybe there's a lot of damsel in distress type stories because it's kind of the easy thing to do.
12052000	12058000	And Nintendo's just more focused on the gameplay, but Miyamoto definitely sounds like open to, you know, if it makes sense, let's do it.
12059000	12060000	This is the world we live in right now.
12061000	12065000	It sounds like he wants to make it organic and not like force it in just for the sake of having it.
12066000	12069000	Yes, which I think is the right thing to do. Nobody wants it to feel forced.
12070000	12071000	That's what she said.
12071000	12072000	Stop.
12073000	12078000	Nobody wants a game where it's like, you know, the roles are reversed just for the sake of the role being reversed.
12079000	12080000	Yes.
12081000	12086000	The ROM hack that guy did for Donkey Kong was pretty cool. I mean, there's exceptions, but that wasn't like an endorsed thing.
12087000	12088000	Otherwise you'd get like Super Princess Peach.
12091000	12094000	Anyway, I thought that was a good story. I wish we had more time to get into that.
12094000	12100000	Tiger Claw also tweeted us the Heavy Gear Assault Kickstarter was canceled, but they're going to be doing crowdfunding on their own.
12101000	12102000	Hmm.
12103000	12108000	Spazinator says there's a free table on the Steam version of Pinball FX2 as of a few days ago.
12109000	12110000	Those of you who like free stuff, go get it.
12111000	12116000	Eric RPG tweeted us Mega Man Unlimited is done and it beams down in July.
12117000	12120000	And this is a fan made production of Mega Man.
12121000	12122000	Very cool.
12122000	12126000	Lots of well wishes all over Twitter for the 11 year birthday.
12127000	12128000	And I just want to say a general thank you.
12129000	12134000	Thank you for all the well wishes. We really couldn't do it without you guys.
12135000	12136000	You guys are great.
12137000	12142000	You know what? I want a game where a woman rescues a man without becoming a romantic interest.
12143000	12144000	Just saying.
12145000	12151000	How many movies do you have out there with a female protagonist that ends up with some sort of romantic tanglement with the dude in the movie?
12152000	12154000	I want Hardcore Chick the game.
12155000	12157000	Who don't need no man to complete her life.
12158000	12159000	Ain't got time for that.
12160000	12161000	Ain't nobody got time for that.
12162000	12166000	Well, we got about enough time left to wrap up the show and get on out of here.
12167000	12169000	Because it's almost 1am for you crazy East Coasters.
12170000	12171000	JVMon, are you still on East Coast time?
12172000	12173000	Are you still on East Coast time?
12174000	12175000	I'm on tequila time right now.
12176000	12178000	One tequila, two tequila, three tequila, four.
12179000	12181000	Alright, let's wrap up.
12182000	12183000	Thank you for being here tonight. I hope you had a good time.
12184000	12185000	I had a great time.
12186000	12187000	And you drank a little bit so we'll make sure.
12188000	12189000	I only had like six shots.
12190000	12191000	Only six.
12192000	12194000	Well then again I only had two and it lasted for what, five minutes?
12195000	12196000	It lasted for a five minute giggle fit.
12197000	12198000	And after five minutes I was like let's go.
12199000	12202000	But thank you for being here and we hope to see you for the 12th next year.
12203000	12204000	Sure.
12205000	12206000	Alright.
12207000	12211000	Loki, I know we kept you a little late but thanks as always. Do you have a final thought?
12212000	12215000	Uh, Captain Rainbow for Smash Brothers?
12216000	12217000	What?
12218000	12219000	Tingle for Smash Brothers.
12220000	12221000	Fuck that.
12222000	12223000	Yes, yes, Tingle for Smash Brothers.
12224000	12225000	I didn't give you your actual final thought JVMon, please.
12226000	12227000	Um, I'm drunk.
12228000	12229000	Woohoo!
12230000	12232000	He will not be leaving this house for a while until he sobers up people.
12233000	12234000	Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?
12235000	12240000	I just got reminded that I really want to play Remember Me.
12240000	12243000	Oh my god, so did I. I didn't even realize that game came out.
12244000	12246000	I fucking want that game on Steam so much.
12247000	12248000	I'm gonna get it on PS3.
12249000	12252000	Um, my final thought is I'm just gonna end as well with a thank you.
12253000	12255000	Thank you all to your support over the last 11 years.
12256000	12261000	Thank you to the genius here in studio that apparently fixed the broadcasting problems.
12262000	12263000	Hopefully that won't be a problem in the future.
12264000	12266000	We'll do that every week because we held the connection for two hours ever since we reconnected.
12267000	12268000	So that'll answer that.
12268000	12271000	But I really do want to thank all the listeners for their support over the years.
12272000	12274000	And as I say every week, Orange Lounge Radio is a free program.
12275000	12280000	And if you enjoy what you hear, just tell a friend or two or seven about the program and help grow our family.
12281000	12284000	And when you're done with us, tune into Mario Marathon. Last game.
12285000	12286000	We've been watching them all weekend.
12287000	12288000	Ah, yeah, Mario Marathon's raising money for a good cause.
12289000	12291000	Those guys really aren't very good at Mario games.
12292000	12299000	I do want to say in general though, when you're done with Orange Lounge Radio as a podcast and you're ready to go listen to something else this week,
12300000	12301000	please consider supporting other independent broadcasters.
12302000	12307000	There's a lot of people out there who've worked, maybe not for 11 years, but even one year is something to celebrate,
12308000	12309000	who work hard at what they do for free.
12310000	12312000	So please continue to support the indie voice.
12313000	12314000	It would mean a lot to us.
12315000	12317000	Meanwhile, we'll be back to do this all again next week.
12318000	12319000	Good night.
12319000	12321000	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
