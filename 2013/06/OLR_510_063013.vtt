00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
The region hosts DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
Tonight, June 30th, 2013, Microsoft reportedly drops Xbox Live patching fees,

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
the Dave & Buster's chain is searching for the next big game,

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
and Nintendo fans start a petition to end region locking on the Wii U.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
where every gamer has a voice.

00:38.000 --> 00:45.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 510, June the 30th of 2013.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
My name is Rob Roberts and I am here to talk with you guys about video games

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
and gaming culture and gaming LOLs and gaming WTFs

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
with my co-host joining me as she has faithfully for the past 11 years.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
Say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Are you still sick 11 years later?

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
Hey, you know what, it's funny, my voice is getting a little bit better,

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
but I still have the cough, so.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Aww.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Ricola!

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
I'm living on a steady diet of Ricola, but you know what?

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
I've gone down a size.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Congratulations, I guess.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Thanks to my diet of Ricola.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
That's not really the way you're supposed to do it, but you-

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Well, that and fruit.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
You look for the silver lining.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
What are you, an Animal Crossing villager?

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Yes, I live on pears.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Alright.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Pears and rainbow trout.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
Also say hello to a man that lives on round table breadsticks.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Say hello to Loki.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Just today.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Just today.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
How are you doing, Loki?

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
I'm doing alright.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
So, for those that-

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
Loki has a bubonic plague.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
Yeah, it's a good thing it's not a video show because if you guys could see Loki,

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
he's got like chicken pox on his hands or something.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
Yeah, it's not really chicken pox.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
I mean, I don't know what chicken pox looks like because I've never had it,

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
but it's an extreme- well, it's not extremely rare, but it's rare.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
It's hand, foot, and mouth disease.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Usually something that, you know-

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Is that where you keep putting your foot in your mouth?

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Because you do that a lot on this show.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
No, no.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
Hand, foot, and mouth disease is like this virus that you get that starts off with a fever.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
So, I had like 102 fever for like a whole 24 hour period.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
That would not go down no matter what kind of medication I took.

02:17.000 --> 02:24.000
And then you break out in a rash on your hands, your feet, and usually your mouth.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
It could be- like, for me, it was on my face.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
Not so much in my mouth, thank goodness.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
A little bit at the back of my throat.

02:31.000 --> 02:38.000
And then like one tip of my tongue, which I always get like a weird thing from like acidic food sometimes.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Gross.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
But yeah, basically they act like blisters.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
So, my hands look like they're all spotted in red and there's some that actually look like blisters.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
And they were hurting quite a bit more earlier in the week.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
Like, I couldn't really pick up things without hurting, you know.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
But actually today's not bad. I don't feel anything.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
So, you're getting better.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
I'm getting better, yes.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Please don't be contagious.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
No, I shouldn't be contagious.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
The listers do not want to catch foot and mouth disease or whatever it is you have.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
No, it's only contagious.

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
Like, it's mainly like, you know, if you're dealing with your children or something like that.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
You can catch it from, you know, changing their diapers or something like that.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
You can catch it from food.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
She had baby butt disease.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
If you share, like, I was sharing food.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
Like, see, you probably wouldn't catch it if you ate some of this stuff.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
Because, like, I was actually eating the same fork and, you know.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
I wouldn't touch those breadsticks.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
In fact, that whole area is getting Lysol'd as soon as you leave.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
That's fine.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
I wouldn't expect you to do anything different any other day.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
We could set up a quarantine.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
I think we've got some canvas somewhere.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
Should we drape a plastic sheet over Loki?

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
God, no, it'll be even hotter than it is.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
You'll be the Loki in the plastic bubble.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
No, but other than that, you know, I've been just staying at home.

03:49.000 --> 03:55.000
Just doing a lot of watching of instructional videos for, you know, Unity stuff.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Your programming stuff is moving on.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
Yeah, I finished, well, I don't know if you'd call it finished.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
I finished slash quit my C++ thing because I was just like,

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
listen, I don't really care about all this stuff that they're talking about.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
When you work with Unity and stuff, it doesn't really apply.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
Like, you know, some of the very low-level things they're teaching you in C++.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
And sure, I'll go back to it someday.

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
But for right now, I just wanted a basic understanding of programming languages.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
And that's what I got.

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
And now when they're showing Unity stuff, I can understand what they're doing.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
I'm not like, what? What's he mean by that?

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Well, I look forward to seeing whatever project,

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
especially the one you were telling me about before the show.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Sounds very ambitious.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
It's like an OLR dream game in the future.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
It's Peter Molyneaux crap.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
Can you imagine if Peter Molyneaux had Loki's ideas?

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
Because this is where we're headed now, is that Loki's learning programming.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
Loki's going to come up with these games. It's going to be crazy.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
So, a couple quick things and then we'll get to our guests.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Because you have a guest here in the studio.

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
First off, I know much of the country is under a heatwave right now.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
But it is hotter than Satan's taint here in Sacramento right now.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
And just as sweaty. It's humid.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
And we bitch here in Sacramento about the humidity when it's above zero.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
This is not humid.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
No, I know. It's not East Coast humid. I know that.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
But it's bad for West Coast. It's bad.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
That was one thing I was going to say.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
And then I think I was going to say something gaming related.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
But I forgot because I was thinking about how fucking hot it was.

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
So, I guess with that, speaking of Satan's taint, let's go introduce our guest.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
No, I'm kidding.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
Say hello everybody. Joining us live in studio tonight.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
A good friend of mine. We go way back years and years.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
And he hosts another show that you all should be listening to.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
It's First Mate Slidekick from the GameBui.org podcast.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Ahoy.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
How you doing?

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
Pretty well aside from the roasting like a chicken part.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Like a pig at a luau.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Yeah, it's pretty bad here in Sacramento right now.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
You're visiting us for the weekend from where do you live usually?

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
The Bay Area.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Yeah.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
Just the big nebula of the Bay.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Yes.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Awesome. Well, welcome.

06:07.000 --> 06:13.000
So, Spike, your co-host at GameBui.org was here about, I think it was about, actually it was about two months ago at this point.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
Yeah.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
So, assuming we picked up any new listeners between now and then, tell us a little bit about GameBui.org.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
What's your show all about?

06:19.000 --> 06:24.000
Well, we're your port of call for gaming news and views that maybe aren't on your radar, but definitely should be.

06:24.000 --> 06:32.000
What we kind of focus on are left of center news and genres that you might not hear on your typical gaming podcast.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
So, we talk about JRPGs a lot.

06:34.000 --> 06:40.000
We talk about different issues in gaming like gay issues and that sort of thing.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
So, you try to talk about stuff before it's cool.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
So, it's like a hipster podcast.

06:46.000 --> 06:58.000
Not really, but we think it's important for people who are interested in this type of content and these sorts of games to have a place to go to hear the news.

06:58.000 --> 07:08.000
Because we find all this stuff on all the big news sites, but with all the big news that happens, it sometimes gets lost.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Yeah, sure.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
All this fuckery about the Xbox One.

07:12.000 --> 07:21.000
That whole talk dominated E3 and I'm sure there's lots of great, and I use my quotey fingers, Kensha Hall games in memory of the hall that used to be there.

07:21.000 --> 07:32.000
They kind of fall off the radar because everybody's too preoccupied with all this crap about Xbox versus Sony and Nintendo out of left field and all that.

07:32.000 --> 07:42.000
Right, yeah. I mean, we talk about Xbox One and some of the bigger stuff too, but we just try to keep our fingers on the pulse of the stuff that you might not hear a lot about.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
So, hopefully we can succeed with that.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
And where can folks hear your show?

07:46.000 --> 07:55.000
We're over at gamebuoy.org and you can get all of our episodes there and also links to all our social networks.

07:55.000 --> 08:00.000
So, hopefully some of you OLR peeps will come and listen to us and say hi.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
So, it's like Game Boy, but you have a U before the L, like a buoy.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
A buoy, like a boat buoy.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
Hence why you're pirates and first mates and all that.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
We're pirates, yeah.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
Sorry, the listeners are complaining that you're too quiet.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Wow, that's a first.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
I know. Actually, no.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
Well, especially since back when we were raiding, I'd have to turn you way down.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
That's true.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.000
And then I'd have to turn Rob even further down because Rob would be like,

08:25.000 --> 08:30.000
Okay, everybody on the main tank, move. Tank, move.

08:30.000 --> 08:35.000
I like to yell at people when I play, wow, I can't help it.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
It's just the way I am.

08:37.000 --> 08:43.000
So, you got some fans in the chatty room over at live.volganetwork.com because this show,

08:43.000 --> 08:48.000
you know, the one that does all the mainstream stuff here where every gamer has a voice.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
We read along with you guys in the chat room. You guys can participate.

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
Live.vognetwork.com, Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern,

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
Although, sadly, he was not live tonight due to a last-minute technical glitch.

09:01.000 --> 09:06.000
Those things happen, but poor Bobby's had a string of bad luck lately with the lightning and everything else.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
So, our thoughts go out to him for like a good week.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
Somebody needs to take Bobby Black Wolf on a cruise, y'all.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Somebody needs to put him on a cruise.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
You know, he likes cruises. He's a cruiser guy.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
That's not good luck at all. Come on.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
Oh, yeah. With everything that happened with the carnival and everything.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Stay away from cruises.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
He'll end up on the poop cruise. We don't want that.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Somebody needs to get him on a good cruise.

09:28.000 --> 09:33.000
No, we just need to win the lottery, go to Georgia, and give him a big hug.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Alright. Let's see.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
Going into our chat room at live.vognetwork.com,

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
Osfer says, I've been recently listening to Game Buoy. Happy face.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Aw, thanks, Osfer.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.000
And Clerical Error 404 says, Game Buoy is great.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Aw, lots of love. Thank you.

09:48.000 --> 09:53.000
He has to say that, though, because we're doing the stuff with Koopa Club and Game Bar and Gamer X.

09:53.000 --> 10:00.000
No, I'm kidding. What a great bunch of guys all around the internet doing those podcasts. Good stuff.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
Clerical Error 404 also suggests a cruise to Alaska.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Hi.

10:04.000 --> 10:09.000
And Code Man says, I love Bobby. We all love Bobby here at the Voice Geese Network.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
That's why we get pissed when all this bad shit keeps happening to him.

10:12.000 --> 10:15.000
How about an open letter to bad shit?

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Knock it off.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Stop it. Not love, O-L-R.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Yeah.

10:19.000 --> 10:27.000
I thought of the other announcement I wanted to make real quick, and then I'll get back to John, or excuse me, First Mate Slidekick.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
Ooh, I just said your real name.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Ooh.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
And then we'll move on with the show.

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
Last week, some of y'all were listening live, and we were having some really bad cutout problems.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
The stream kept dropping every 15 seconds.

10:39.000 --> 10:45.000
Now, originally we blamed that on our service provider, but the blame may have been misplaced.

10:45.000 --> 10:51.000
It turns out it was a router that we were using here in the house, which sucks because we just replaced a router a year ago.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
But now the other one died.

10:53.000 --> 10:58.000
We have a bridge router that we use in the living room here that moves it from the studio.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
So now the show is plugged in directly into the studio router.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
I'll try to save you the full networking spiel.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
But the last half of last week's show streamed fine.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
So I'm sorry to the live audience that was getting really frustrated last week.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Hopefully that will be the end of it.

11:12.000 --> 11:17.000
If anything screws up now, it's this 108 degree weather fuckery's fault.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
No, it's Comcast. It's always Comcast.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
It's always Comcast, exactly.

11:21.000 --> 11:28.000
You know, anytime there's extreme weather changes, Comcast has a big fart, and the sticky bits get left on the customer.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Ew.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
Exactly. That's what everybody says when it happens. It's horrible.

11:33.000 --> 11:38.000
Anyhow, back to First Mate Slidekicks, since I'm supposed to be talking to you.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
What are some of the topics you've talked about on Game Buoy lately?

11:41.000 --> 11:50.000
One thing I kind of like about your show is that since you do a central topic, you pick a lot of stuff that's not necessarily tied into the news.

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
Like your April Fool's show was all about tingle, right?

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Yes, it was our tinglecast.

11:56.000 --> 12:03.000
And you did another show about, I know you did an LGBT show. What was your most recent one?

12:03.000 --> 12:11.000
The most recent one we did was, like the recent full episode was our E3 Blowout, which is a yearly theme now, second year.

12:11.000 --> 12:18.000
Actually, a new thing that we've done on the site is introduce Game Buoy Micro, which are little tiny podcasts.

12:18.000 --> 12:23.000
And by tiny, I mean like a half hour because our podcasts tend to run longer these days.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
Hey, boy, you know you're on a three hour show tonight, right?

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
Maybe that's why we're getting so long on Game Buoy. We were just trying to be like, O-L-R.

12:30.000 --> 12:35.000
Oh, stop. Well, you guys are always really supportive of the other indie shows, and I think that's great.

12:35.000 --> 12:39.000
That's something I've always really tried to champion is that, you know, support each other.

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
Don't cut each other down because nobody wins in that situation.

12:43.000 --> 12:48.000
So you guys are always really great about pimping stuff at the end of your show.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
Since you did, I know one of the Micros you did because I actually listened to it.

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
You guys went and saw the Best Buy Nintendo E3 Blowout.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Yeah, we actually took some YouTube video as well.

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
How was that? Not to steal the thunder of your show, but give us the Cliff Notes version. How was it?

13:01.000 --> 13:06.000
You know, it was kind of cool. You know, I feel like any time you go to a Nintendo event,

13:06.000 --> 13:11.000
whether it's just camping out for a Wii or, you know, going to something like this,

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
that Nintendo crowds are usually pretty cool.

13:14.000 --> 13:19.000
It was a really long wait, but to Nintendo's credit, they didn't cut it off right at, like, six or whatever.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
How long was long?

13:21.000 --> 13:26.000
We were in line for about five and a half hours. You know, we got to play one game, but I mean, for me it was worth it.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Just like the real E3.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Yeah, pretty much. Authentic experience.

13:30.000 --> 13:36.000
That's what they were actually saying. The Nintendo representatives there were saying it's an authentic E3 experience,

13:36.000 --> 13:41.000
but they give us pizza. P-I-Z-Z-A.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
Did they give you whipped cream pouring like waterfalls?

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
No, they didn't. Unfortunately.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
Cheap, cheap bastards.

13:49.000 --> 13:55.000
But yeah, I thought it was really cool that they put it on and that they were so cooperative in that.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
Best Buy, to their credit, was really cooperative, too.

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
They could have just been like, nope, it's five. Everyone who hasn't played yet doesn't get to play,

14:02.000 --> 14:10.000
but they tried to get everyone to play what they wanted and they had little Mario Kart 8 flags to give you

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
just for waiting in lines. I mean, it was really cool.

14:12.000 --> 14:17.000
I still think the best way, you know, approach to E3 was like Xbox.

14:17.000 --> 14:26.000
Oh my god, Xbox. Yeah, 2005 or 2006, when they did that, were bringing E3 home and they had demos for games.

14:26.000 --> 14:30.000
Same demos that were out there. I'm like, why don't they do that?

14:30.000 --> 14:35.000
I don't understand why they can't do that now. I mean, I know a lot of that doesn't run on final hardware and stuff.

14:35.000 --> 14:42.000
I think the reason why they don't is there's too many people that make their final judgement of the game based off the E3 demo

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
and it's too risky in that regard. I honestly think that's a big part of it.

14:46.000 --> 14:52.000
Like, you know, E3 builds are usually really early on in the development and there's too many people that make their decision like,

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
oh, this game sucks based off the demo. Like, you know, demos carry a lot of weight.

14:56.000 --> 15:02.000
Yeah, but these people, though, are the same dumb people that will buy a game based off of a review score from one outlet.

15:02.000 --> 15:07.000
So, I mean, they're very fickle anyways, so I don't know why we should punish every-

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
Considering that, you know, it's gonna get a good review and they're like, well, I guess I'll buy it.

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
Oh, okay. You know, cause, you know, YGIN liked it or something.

15:15.000 --> 15:21.000
Um, quickly, also about the Nintendo experience. What did you play? You got your hands on with, you didn't-

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
Spike did Mario Kart 8, you did the Mario-

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
I did Mario 3D World, yeah.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
The Mario 3D fused with Super Mario 2 game.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
Yeah, cats. Super Mario cats, that's why you need to know.

15:32.000 --> 15:43.000
Super Mario cats, yeah. It was cool, I mean, it was kind of chaotic and I've actually, I think it was over on US Gamer, which is Jeremy Parrish's new outlet.

15:43.000 --> 15:50.000
They were describing it as chaotic too, but I mean, like in a good way, so it was fun, you know.

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
Mario Party's chaotic if you play with me. Mario Party's always chaotic.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
Everything is chaotic if they play with you, Rob.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
Shut up!

15:57.000 --> 16:02.000
Hey, I've been here 11 years, I have the right to say whatever I want to, so nah.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
But did you have fun?

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
I did, I did.

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
Did you make your judgment on the entire game based off that demo?

16:10.000 --> 16:17.000
You know, I mean, I kind of made my judgment on that game based on the Nintendo Direct, honestly, so, I mean-

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
You're like, it's Mario and Princess Floats, I'm in.

16:20.000 --> 16:29.000
Pretty much, you know, I'm a shameless Nintendo fanboy, but you know, it was good to get a chance to play it and to be able to speak to that.

16:29.000 --> 16:37.000
And you know, just being able to see the games that I didn't play, like watching Captain Spike play Mario Kart 8 and Wind Waker HD.

16:37.000 --> 16:42.000
Towards the end, people were starting to just get really, like, annoyed when people were like,

16:42.000 --> 16:49.000
Oh, I want to play Wind Waker HD, because it's actually, what they did is they redid the original GameCube demo.

16:49.000 --> 16:55.000
So you could either do the bird battle, boss battle, or run around Windfall Village.

16:55.000 --> 17:05.000
And, you know, which is cool, but I mean, compared to doing two races on Mario Kart or two levels in 3D World, you know, it was just a little too long.

17:05.000 --> 17:14.000
So, it looked gorgeous though, and Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze looked good, so, you know, it was cool to actually get a chance to see it.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
You know, not just based on an E3 video, so.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
Okay. It was worth it.

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
Going to the chat room for some comments at live.vognetwork.com.

17:24.000 --> 17:31.000
Shadownextgen says, Gamers rush to decisions. A lot of them don't understand the concept of an alpha or beta build that will be buggy.

17:32.000 --> 17:39.000
Yeah, there's a lot of people playing the Final Fantasy XIV online beta right now that are, you know, basically like, Oh, this is just a game trial, right?

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
And not really. There's a lot still missing.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
We've already seen big changes from the last build to this one.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
Oh, God, yes.

17:46.000 --> 17:56.000
Ospfer says, I also did Mario 3D World at the Nintendo E3 experience. It was pretty fun playing the cat form. The dive mechanic is really awesomely integrated in some of the levels.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
Yeah, I agree.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
Very cool.

17:59.000 --> 18:05.000
Okay, well, taking a step back and just kind of getting to know you as a gamer a little bit before we get into tonight's news.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
I always ask the guests this. What's your favorite video game of all time?

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
That's always a really tough question to answer.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
You can name a couple if you have to. One of your favorite video games.

18:13.000 --> 18:20.000
You know, I have to say, if I'm going to just pick one favorite, it would probably be the original Legend of Zelda for NES.

18:20.000 --> 18:29.000
Just because I grew up with that game, I know it inside and out. And that's the game that I can just put on the virtual console or whatever and play through in a weekend.

18:29.000 --> 18:38.000
And I just know where everything is. I mean, not that familiarity, over familiarity is always good, but you know, it just it always feels like going home again.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
What do you love about video games?

18:42.000 --> 18:53.000
I don't know. You know, I just I like exploring worlds. I like being another character. I just kind of get lost in it. And that's I guess that's always appealed to me. I've always been a nerdy kid.

18:53.000 --> 19:00.000
All right. I can identify with that. One other thing and then I'll move on. What possessed you to want to do a podcast?

19:00.000 --> 19:07.000
You know, I've known Captain Spike for actually longer than I've known you. So yes, you have.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
You guys have been besties for a long time.

19:09.000 --> 19:17.000
Yeah, we we were just always talking about games and we just thought, you know, why not give it a try? We were inspired by y'all here at OLR.

19:17.000 --> 19:24.000
So we just thought we'd give it a go. And we've been going for over a year at this point. So that's a great compliment, though.

19:24.000 --> 19:30.000
So thank you. Like any time anybody says like, oh, I mean, you guys did it. So that helped me learn that like I could do it, too.

19:30.000 --> 19:37.000
I'm always like that's that's like actually like a great compliment. So thank you. Of course. You guys rock. So you guys rock.

19:37.000 --> 19:45.000
No, you know, you love fast here at OLR. All right. Not in this heat. Anything else you want to plug in?

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
Any other shows? Twitter, things like that you want to plug?

19:49.000 --> 19:55.000
You know, they can find all of our social links on our website, game buoy dot org.

19:55.000 --> 20:01.000
I guess I just would like to shout out to gamer X convention in San Francisco.

20:02.000 --> 20:10.000
You know, it's for gamers of all genders and that sort of thing. You don't have to be gay to enjoy gamer.

20:10.000 --> 20:19.000
That's true. And Rob and I and Captain Spike and our friends from Game Bar and Koopa Club are going to be doing a podcasting panels there.

20:19.000 --> 20:30.000
So if you happen to be heading out there or you didn't really know about it and you think that sounds like a cool thing, you should go over to gamer connect dot org dot com.

20:30.000 --> 20:37.000
Oh, I feel bad. I think the ticket pre-sale is going to be done real soon. Yeah. In a couple of weeks. And then the ticket price goes up at the door.

20:37.000 --> 20:41.000
If you're in Northern California, really, California at all. You should come with us.

20:41.000 --> 20:46.000
If I drive to Disneyland five times a year, ULA people can come up here for a weekend. The thing is, it's right in Japan town.

20:46.000 --> 20:52.000
So even if you're like not super into the convention experience, but you kind of want to go, you know, just come hang with us.

20:52.000 --> 21:00.000
Go to Japan town. San Francisco. There is plenty to do everywhere. And it's like always 68 degrees.

21:00.000 --> 21:08.000
So I can escape this horrible heat wave. So I don't know about today, though, because, you know, today was the big doesn't matter.

21:08.000 --> 21:17.000
It's cooler than actually 25 degrees cooler. I think it's been in the 70s. Oh, no. The 70s. Oh, my goodness. All right.

21:17.000 --> 21:22.000
OK. Well, thank you. And of course, please continue commenting on tonight's news. Like, certainly here.

21:22.000 --> 21:27.000
For the record, it's 68 degrees in San Francisco right now. Wow. For the all you and us.

21:27.000 --> 21:31.000
Oh, but tomorrow it'll be 80 for all of you.

21:31.000 --> 21:39.000
Let's go, grandpa, if you're listening. Kiss my butt. All right. Anyhow, let's move on into how was your gaming week?

21:39.000 --> 21:44.000
We always like to start off the show with a little bit of what types of video games have you been playing this week in dark soccer?

21:44.000 --> 21:48.000
I know you've had a big week in gaming. I played old stuff.

21:48.000 --> 21:54.000
We hooked up the Super Nintendo last night for my friend Amanda's 30th birthday.

21:54.000 --> 22:05.000
Happy birthday, Amanda. And we played Turtles in Time, which is the most awesome game ever.

22:05.000 --> 22:11.000
And we had some Super Mario World, some rock and roll racing, which is funny.

22:11.000 --> 22:17.000
My my friend's mom turned around and said, is that Black Sabbath coming from the Super Nintendo game?

22:17.000 --> 22:22.000
Yes, ma'am, it was. And that was Blizzard before they were Blizzard.

22:22.000 --> 22:29.000
Yeah, it was pre Blizzard and which led us to a discussion about the lost Vikings and how you can actually find them in WoW.

22:29.000 --> 22:36.000
Yeah, in Alderman. And if you are Horde, though, you can kill them, which is pretty fun.

22:36.000 --> 22:51.000
I was doing that when I was way past level. So I played a little bit of Final Fantasy 14 just because I only played a little because of all the stuff going on, especially with being sick and having to clean house and have the party.

22:51.000 --> 22:56.000
I finally got to play Cards Against Humanity. It's not a video game, I know, but it's totally wrong.

22:56.000 --> 23:05.000
All the nerds are playing it. And I got the best win ever. I should I might say it on air, but it's really horrible.

23:05.000 --> 23:17.000
But I did say that it's like an M. Knight, whatever his name is. The plot twist was that Nickelback was really perpetually handicapped.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
M. Knight Shyamalan. Yeah, whatever.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
Shyamalan Dean Dong. That's what Dan calls him.

23:22.000 --> 23:32.000
So we had the old school SNES stuff last night, and I have played some.

23:32.000 --> 23:37.000
I played Mass Victory on Thursday for the live stream, but I only played for a little bit because I was just feeling rotten.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
I mean, rotten.

23:39.000 --> 23:50.000
Today was a very special day because thanks to the lovely generosity of our first mate here, I have 3DS.

23:50.000 --> 23:56.000
And then thanks to my husband not wanting me to make puppy eyes and wine at him, I have Animal Crossing.

23:56.000 --> 24:00.000
He also got himself the last Fire Emblem game for the DS.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
So there's a little something in it for you both. That's good, though.

24:03.000 --> 24:10.000
And we're probably going to sell my old DSi since we only need to have one of each system.

24:10.000 --> 24:19.000
And we have my pink GBA. I have the clear pink one. We have the Nintendo SP, whatever they're called.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
The one that was done up by the NES.

24:21.000 --> 24:29.000
So usually it's like when the new stuff comes out, we'll have one each of us and then sell off one of the old ones.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
But right now we're poor.

24:33.000 --> 24:38.000
So I've been playing, what, six hours of Animal Crossing today.

24:38.000 --> 24:42.000
And I've already made the down payment on my house and bought a phone booth.

24:42.000 --> 24:49.000
And then one of my friends on Tumblr, who I have to say thank you to my name, Twin, if she's listening.

24:49.000 --> 24:54.000
I got a Dave Strider shirt for anyone who's into Homestuck. It was really cool.

24:54.000 --> 24:59.000
So my character's running around in it wearing pink glasses because ew, pink, but glasses.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
So it's kind of a weird hipster.

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
That's a lot for just one day. You've probably done more in a day than I've done in the three weeks I've owned.

25:05.000 --> 25:11.000
I have all the fruit now. I do not have a watering can and I do not have a slingshot yet.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
You'll get it.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
It better be tomorrow.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Don't forget to buy the fortune cookie every day.

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
Oh, shoot. Well, don't you have to have coins or something?

25:20.000 --> 25:25.000
Yeah, you get those from walking around. So if you've been walking around with your 3DS today, you have coins.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.000
Okay.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
I'll go buy it.

25:28.000 --> 25:33.000
It's so cute. DarkSakura's having to learn about her 3DS and how to add friends and all that stuff. It's fun.

25:33.000 --> 25:43.000
And I played that MeFinder quest, shit, whatever, and the two of you I would expect would be Grade A adventurers, but you couldn't kill a ghost.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
Nope, not until you StreetPass with us several times.

25:45.000 --> 25:51.000
Yeah, it's actually based on how many times you StreetPass with a person. Up to, I think, seven times, I think is where it maxes out.

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
I thought you guys would just run amok through my game.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
No, I'm just like, look at my pretty penguin hat. Isn't it awesome?

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
I love your penguin hat.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
This is why I stopped playing Find Me because I don't need a better hat.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
Rob, I honestly like Slykic's hat better.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
Whatever.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
The Mario hat.

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
I want to have a propeller hat because that would be awesome.

26:09.000 --> 26:15.000
So yeah, Animal Crossing, that's going to be my life from here on out. I did name my town Normandy, like I said I would.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
Congrats.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
So either that, so either all of my townsfolk are going to call me Commander.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
Uh-huh.

26:21.000 --> 26:25.000
I mean, my character is Sakura because every Animal Crossing character I've ever had a Sakura.

26:25.000 --> 26:32.000
Either that or they're all going to have like French words that would be like Merde or Ulala or Zoot.

26:32.000 --> 26:38.000
Today, I made my crappy recreation of the VOG logo in my Animal Crossing town because we finished the custom signboard.

26:38.000 --> 26:42.000
So right when you enter the town, you see now a big little VOG logo, my ghetto logo.

26:42.000 --> 26:46.000
I have a goal for this game though, to find Dina.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
You want to be reunited?

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
I want my lesbian back.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Ours is a love lung tonight.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
She was an aardvark, right?

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
No, she wasn't. I don't think she was an aardvark.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
I thought she was a duck.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
Whatever.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
No, Mallory was a duck.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
There were several ducks, Rob.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
I don't give a duck.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
We have diversity.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
Fine.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.000
You and your only aardvarks can be lesbians.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
Alright, moving on.

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
Loki, I know you haven't been playing Animal Crossing. What have you been playing?

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
I haven't been playing very much at all actually this week.

27:18.000 --> 27:25.000
The two things I did play this week, one being Final Fantasy XIV, the beta.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
I played about an hour of that.

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
I was actually going to play more, but then I just kept getting distracted.

27:30.000 --> 27:35.000
I was supposed to play a little bit of Planet Cardine, but I forgot.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
Hands hurt too much anyways to play anything.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.000
Final Fantasy XIV, I leveled to 9.

27:42.000 --> 27:47.000
I did my first instance battle thing as part of my storyline.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
It was alright.

27:49.000 --> 27:54.000
I keep running into those event things though.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
I'll be just going somewhere and it's like,

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
Oh, you stumbled upon a fate.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Do shit.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
I'm like, okay, I guess I will.

28:02.000 --> 28:06.000
Then I get killed because I don't notice that my health is going down

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
because it's too much on the screen.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
There's a tip I have for fates.

28:10.000 --> 28:14.000
If you happen to find yourself overwhelmed, run through a big crowd of people.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
The thing will not follow you.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Well, it wasn't that at all.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
I didn't even notice it was doing a lot of damage to me.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
It's because I just kept, you know, I'd get done with one

28:22.000 --> 28:25.000
and immediately target the next thing and immediately go.

28:25.000 --> 28:30.000
Also, many people don't realize the UI is completely customizable even on PS3.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
If the health bars are not in a unique place for you, try to move them.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
I should.

28:35.000 --> 28:40.000
Then the other thing I played was a little bit of Excite Truck this morning

28:40.000 --> 28:44.000
because we wanted to entertain Josh.

28:44.000 --> 28:49.000
I was trying to get Mario Kart to work, but my disc wouldn't read in my Wii U,

28:49.000 --> 28:57.000
which is weird because it did before and I was just not.

28:57.000 --> 29:01.000
Then it's just like, okay, I guess we'll do Wii Play,

29:01.000 --> 29:03.000
and then he couldn't understand Wii Play.

29:03.000 --> 29:09.000
So we did Excite Truck, and he just kind of let it sit there and coast in a circle.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
So that was kind of fun.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
But I actually did get to play a couple of races and stuff.

29:13.000 --> 29:21.000
Man, that game looks really basic now that you're not zooming through the landscape at a high rate of speed.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
It's just very basic looking.

29:23.000 --> 29:26.000
I'm like, wow, that is very simple.

29:26.000 --> 29:30.000
But it's still one of the few games that utilizes the SD card for a very awesome reason,

29:30.000 --> 29:34.000
custom sounds, because their music wasn't very good.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
It's all right.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Let's see, what else?

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
A little bit of housekeeping.

29:40.000 --> 29:45.000
Thanks to one of our old listeners of the show

29:45.000 --> 29:51.000
and also one of the old players that used to play on the Minecraft server that we had,

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
LordGally.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
He has actually provided or said, hey, you know what?

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
I have a server that not a lot of people play on.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
You guys want to come play on our server?

30:00.000 --> 30:06.000
So he gave me full access to the admin stuff for it, so we'll be able to set it up.

30:06.000 --> 30:11.000
It's actually a lot more flexible than the old ones, so I can actually do all the kind of mods I wanted to do.

30:11.000 --> 30:15.000
Well, somebody needs to build a shrine to LordGally first thing for that, because that's an awesome gesture.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
Thank you, LordGally.

30:17.000 --> 30:20.000
I have to check with him, because right now it's set to survival and stuff,

30:20.000 --> 30:25.000
so I have to see if he wants to switch it off of that and put it on bucket and everything.

30:25.000 --> 30:29.000
But now that I have all the tools to do that, I've just got to sit down and actually research what I want to do.

30:29.000 --> 30:34.000
I wanted to put a Spoutcraft server on there, because Spout's pretty awesome,

30:34.000 --> 30:38.000
because you can create all the custom shapes and stuff,

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
like other materials that are unique to the game.

30:41.000 --> 30:47.000
So you could have new enemies, you could have planes, cars, guns, all sorts of crazy stuff.

30:47.000 --> 30:52.000
So I'll see how hard that is and may do that, but it looks like it'll be a lot of fun,

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
and hopefully we'll get to play it again.

30:54.000 --> 30:57.000
This man is bouncing off the walls in chat, he's very excited to hear that it's back.

30:57.000 --> 31:03.000
So soon, I'll have the details in the Vaga Minecraft forum.

31:03.000 --> 31:06.000
Slidekick, are you a Minecraft player? You ever tried that out?

31:06.000 --> 31:10.000
I've actually never played Minecraft before, so I probably should.

31:10.000 --> 31:17.000
It's different. It's a game, but it's more like Legos on the computer.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
It's hard to explain.

31:20.000 --> 31:23.000
It's clever. It's never really been a high priority for me,

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
but I should check it out, so give it a chance.

31:26.000 --> 31:30.000
Okay, if that's it for Loki's Gaming Week, then I will move into my gaming week real quick.

31:30.000 --> 31:35.000
I didn't have a lot to play. Honestly, I OD'd on Final Fantasy XIV this weekend during the beta.

31:35.000 --> 31:40.000
I played damn near nonstop. I had a couple other things to do here locally,

31:40.000 --> 31:44.000
but when I wasn't out and about, I was trying to stay out of the heat,

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
and I was playing the crap out of Final Fantasy XIV beta.

31:47.000 --> 31:55.000
My Thaumaturge is level 16. I started with Thaumaturge and switched to Conjurer,

31:55.000 --> 31:59.000
and my Conjurer is now 17, so I've got both those jobs going.

31:59.000 --> 32:03.000
So is Conjurer the XIV version of a Summoner now?

32:03.000 --> 32:07.000
No, that's going to be Arcanist, which isn't in the beta yet, so there's still stuff to add.

32:07.000 --> 32:13.000
Arcanist will lead to Summoner and Scholar eventually,

32:13.000 --> 32:20.000
and then Thaumaturge leads to Black Mage and Conjurer leads to White Mage.

32:20.000 --> 32:24.000
But you don't ever get stuck with just one job.

32:24.000 --> 32:31.000
It's not like the XI system of sub-jobs. It's Final Fantasy V's more system where you choose traits.

32:31.000 --> 32:39.000
Because my Thaumaturge is level 16, when I play a Conjurer, I can have Thunder and Surecast from my Thaumaturge in my bar.

32:39.000 --> 32:46.000
If I were to play a Gladiator, I could actually get weapon skills if they're compatible with my class.

32:46.000 --> 32:50.000
But everybody should level a Conjurer to 2 to get a Cure.

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
You could have Cure with almost any class.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
It makes a lot of stuff easier.

32:55.000 --> 33:01.000
I've just been playing the crap out of Final Fantasy XIV. I love it a lot.

33:01.000 --> 33:06.000
I think because in some ways it's still an MMO in its early stages.

33:06.000 --> 33:10.000
We're not counting 1.0 at this point. I'm just throwing out 1.0.

33:10.000 --> 33:15.000
In many ways, some of the combat I realized when I was healing a dungeon the other day,

33:15.000 --> 33:19.000
I'm like, you know, this game doesn't really have the complexity of World of Warcraft.

33:19.000 --> 33:23.000
All I'm doing is Cure, Cure, Cure, and occasionally I'm doing Medica, which is the group Cure.

33:23.000 --> 33:29.000
Sometimes I'll get to nuke the mob, but I don't have the diversity that I have in World of Warcraft spells.

33:29.000 --> 33:33.000
Granted, World of Warcraft wasn't always like that. World of Warcraft's five expansions in right now.

33:33.000 --> 33:38.000
So it's going to take time for Final Fantasy XIV to build up to that, and I see the potential there.

33:38.000 --> 33:42.000
But I love that the combat is so fast-paced, but it's Final Fantasy.

33:42.000 --> 33:52.000
I like how you can utilize your terrain as well, because now that you can jump and stuff,

33:52.000 --> 34:00.000
you can actually say, okay, I'm going to hop up on here and cast spells from up on top of here,

34:00.000 --> 34:06.000
and the monster can't really get around to me. It doesn't work all the time with goblins and stuff,

34:06.000 --> 34:09.000
but when they do the bomb toss or whatever, it'll show where the bomb's going to be,

34:09.000 --> 34:13.000
and you can run around behind them and you don't take any damage, which is pretty sweet.

34:13.000 --> 34:17.000
I actually liked that, too. That one duty I was having a problem with,

34:17.000 --> 34:21.000
I ended up just sprinting and kiting him the whole time, but it was really neat.

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
It actually worked a lot better than it did him well.

34:24.000 --> 34:30.000
The game is so fanservice-y, too, and it's beautiful. The lighting effects are so beautiful.

34:30.000 --> 34:35.000
Have you played it on PC at all? It still looks pretty good on PS3, but my god,

34:35.000 --> 34:38.000
some of the spell effects are like when you're casting in the water,

34:38.000 --> 34:43.000
and the very first instance you go in is this blue ocean pirate-y thing.

34:43.000 --> 34:47.000
I really hope this game goes free-to-play very fast, because I kind of want to play it.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
Don't hold your breath.

34:48.000 --> 34:53.000
I can tell you one thing. If you've got a high-end graphics card and you have everything bumped up all the way,

34:53.000 --> 34:56.000
it's just, everything is there.

34:56.000 --> 35:01.000
I thought I was going to have to get a new system, but there has been such a jump in performance

35:01.000 --> 35:06.000
from the last beta to this beta. I'm like, oh my god, this game looks great on my not-so-great computer.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
I'm so thrilled.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
It really sets it to optimize to what you got.

35:09.000 --> 35:15.000
Been loving Final Fantasy XIV. One of the other fanservice-y things I have to talk about,

35:15.000 --> 35:19.000
the last boss in Tamtara Deepcroft, which is one of the instances,

35:19.000 --> 35:23.000
it's a mage with a tentacle face, and I didn't catch it at first,

35:23.000 --> 35:28.000
but Alan looks over and goes, dude, that's one of the mage mobs from Final Fantasy I.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
And I'm like, oh my god, it is.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
There's all these subtle fanservice things.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
They changed something, by the way.

35:34.000 --> 35:38.000
When you started off in Gridania, did you remake a character there?

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
No, I don't think so.

35:40.000 --> 35:43.000
Your intro is different now from how it was in the last one.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
You have moogles.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
No, I started in Ulda this time.

35:46.000 --> 35:50.000
Well, I went ahead and made another conjurer because I wanted to see if they added new quests.

35:50.000 --> 35:55.000
And there's moogles, and it's really funny.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.000
That's cute.

35:56.000 --> 36:01.000
Techness in chat says, oh, and where's the VoG link shell for Final Fantasy XIV?

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
I accidentally rolled on one of the JP realms.

36:03.000 --> 36:07.000
My assumption is that Horde House, being the online gaming show,

36:07.000 --> 36:10.000
will kind of pick up the VoG link shell thing and create.

36:10.000 --> 36:14.000
Right now we're on Behemoth, but that's subject to change for Beta 4.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
We will let you know.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
Behemoth is busy.

36:16.000 --> 36:19.000
Yeah, Behemoth is busy, but we want to be on a busy server,

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
just because the first couple weeks might suck,

36:21.000 --> 36:24.000
but later on, when the game starts thinning out,

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
you'll want to be on a busy server to find other people.

36:26.000 --> 36:29.000
Have they announced what the month-to-month price is going to be yet?

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
15.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
Is it really 15? I thought it was lower.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Well, if it's lower, then that's even better.

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
But I was under the impression it was going to be the 1495 thing.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
I'm assuming somebody in chat will yell it out,

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
or if Shane Alinko is listening, he'll join shortly and yell it.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
See, the thing is, I don't know.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
I hate paying for an MMO month-to-month

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
because I want to play so much other stuff.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
I feel locked into having to play that

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
to kind of get my money's worth each month,

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
and that's the thing.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
That's why I quit Final Fantasy XI,

36:55.000 --> 36:58.000
because I just wasn't playing it enough,

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
and I'm kind of afraid to get into something.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
That's why free-to-play, or you buy the game

37:02.000 --> 37:05.000
and then you can play whenever works well for me.

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
I like the game. I like it a lot better.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
It seems to be a lot easier to level up and stuff

37:11.000 --> 37:16.000
than XI, which is nice, but I don't know.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
All right, so anyway, Final Fantasy XIV.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
And then the other game I've played a lot of this week,

37:20.000 --> 37:23.000
Marvel Heroes, the free-to-play MMO,

37:23.000 --> 37:25.000
although it's a little more like Diablo.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
Free my ass.

37:26.000 --> 37:29.000
Yeah, well, it's got little transactions up the wazoo.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
Little?

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
I started as Storm, of course, because I love Storm.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
So I started playing as Storm, and then after I beat the first boss,

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
I got the Scarlet Witch token,

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
so I can play as Scarlet Witch now, too.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.000
That's who I started with.

37:41.000 --> 37:44.000
Yeah, so apparently all the characters will drop in the game.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
It just might take forever.

37:46.000 --> 37:50.000
But I'll give a cheap plug to this week's Hoard House,

37:50.000 --> 37:53.000
because we had Mihail on this week,

37:53.000 --> 37:56.000
and he talked about Marvel Heroes and a lot of League of Legends,

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
which I patched this week so I could play with Mihail

37:59.000 --> 38:02.000
later this week when Final Fantasy XIV is not running.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.000
HoardHouse.com.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.000
It's not running this week?

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Only on the weekends, right?

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Yeah, Final Fantasy XIV is only running on the weekends,

38:08.000 --> 38:11.000
but the rumor is there's going to be a longer stress test before Beta 4,

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
so we'll see.

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
Anyhow, Slidekick, First Mate Slidekick,

38:15.000 --> 38:16.000
what have you been playing this week?

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
What's a week of gaming look like to you?

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
It's pretty much been all Animal Crossing.

38:21.000 --> 38:26.000
It's funny because I picked it up actually at the Nintendo experience

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
because they had a display sitting out, so I was like,

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
oh, I probably should get it.

38:30.000 --> 38:33.000
And for the first couple of days I only played a little bit,

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
but lately I've just been playing for hours at a time,

38:36.000 --> 38:37.000
and I'm like, oh, I've got to sleep now.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
I also played the shit out of Animal Crossing.

38:39.000 --> 38:42.000
That one night we were doing the Google Hangout with everybody.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
Good times.

38:43.000 --> 38:47.000
Yeah, so I just built the upstairs to my house.

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
I've been going to the island a lot, catching bugs.

38:50.000 --> 39:00.000
Oh, I got Reggie's house in my spot pass in the Happy Home model homes gallery,

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
so I've been buying a lot of stuff out of Reggie's house.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
And when you look in his little profile card it says,

39:05.000 --> 39:08.000
my body is ready, so yeah.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
You know it was an intern that did it, people.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
It's not Reggie's actual house.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
An intern did it for him.

39:13.000 --> 39:17.000
I did notice in some of the screenshots or whatever they were showing of the game

39:17.000 --> 39:22.000
that they have a lot of cool niche Japanese arcade stuff you can get.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
I don't know if they have a Japanese arcade set,

39:24.000 --> 39:28.000
but they have a candy cab, claw machine,

39:28.000 --> 39:33.000
and some actual table cabinets and stuff like that.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
They look pretty sweet.

39:34.000 --> 39:37.000
Not sweet enough for me to buy a 3DS for the game, but sweet enough.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
I have a claw machine in my Animal Crossing house.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
It's awesome.

39:40.000 --> 39:44.000
Do you know what I loved in your town was the animal that had the chocolate fondue fountain.

39:44.000 --> 39:48.000
That's what I wanted.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
Who doesn't want a chocolate fondue fountain?

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
Let's be real.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
And some macaroons.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
Come on.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
You know what?

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
The first thing that I bought wasn't making a down payment on my house.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
I bought a phone booth.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
Is that the thing that looks like a TARDIS but red?

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
It's the current British style phone booth.

40:01.000 --> 40:05.000
One of those was for sale in my town the night of the Google Hangout.

40:05.000 --> 40:08.000
Spike was like, open your gates right now.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
I'm coming to town.

40:09.000 --> 40:13.000
That just started this whole wave of Animal Crossing fuckery.

40:13.000 --> 40:17.000
Except then he didn't take my virtual boy that I was saving for him.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
He's a virtual boy fanatic.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
I'll have to get it to him.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.000
Now you're no longer friends.

40:22.000 --> 40:23.000
What?

40:23.000 --> 40:28.000
If they put in virtual boy games it would totally work with the lenticular.

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
Oh, like a 3DS virtual console thing?

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
Yeah.

40:32.000 --> 40:36.000
I don't even know about virtual boy emulation if that's actually a thing.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
I thought there were early rumors it was going to happen.

40:39.000 --> 40:45.000
They just need to make Animal Crossing like the Nintendo version of PlayStation Home.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.000
Done.

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
Well, rumors are it's going to go free to play at some point.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
System seller right there.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
Makes sense.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.000
Anything else?

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
Slidekick?

40:53.000 --> 40:54.000
No.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Actually just Animal Crossing this week.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
I've been meaning to get around to some other stuff.

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
But I'm actually in the process of moving.

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
I've been trying to pack up my console games.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
My 3DS is right here.

41:05.000 --> 41:09.000
That's why I've been focusing on 3DS for the most part.

41:09.000 --> 41:12.000
Not to give out your home address for all the stalkers.

41:12.000 --> 41:13.000
But you're moving to Daly City, right?

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
Yes.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
Which is just Alan's old digs.

41:16.000 --> 41:19.000
Yeah, just Alan's old digs and just a quick bar right away from the city.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
Yes.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
Alright.

41:22.000 --> 41:26.000
Good thing you missed this weekend because I hear it was crazy.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Oh yeah, with all the festivities.

41:28.000 --> 41:29.000
Yes.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
Lots of extra festivities.

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
Lots of stuff in the news to be festive about.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
But we are going to move into gaming news.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
But first I want to go over some housekeeping.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
Of course I always like to plug our Twitter.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.000
And Facebook.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
And I was going to plug this during housekeeping.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.000
We already mentioned it at the top of the show.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
But I'll plug it again.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
GamerX.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
Catch me.

41:50.000 --> 41:54.000
I'll be there live August 4th.

41:54.000 --> 41:55.000
Saturday.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.000
Question mark.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
I think the third is the Saturday.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.000
Yeah.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
It's.

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
Oh yeah.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
I keep thinking.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
Friday's not an official day.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
Friday's the VIP day.

42:03.000 --> 42:04.000
Okay.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
It's the third and it's at seven o'clock in one of the panel rooms.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
It's podcast.

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
I thought it was six o'clock.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
God, I'm so unprepared tonight.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
Look.

42:11.000 --> 42:14.000
You get there and you just look for podcast cross zone.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
And you're going to go to it because it has the word podcast in it.

42:16.000 --> 42:21.000
And that's where you're going to see me and Slidekick and all the kids from Koopa Club

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
and Spike and Game Bar.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
And it's going to be fun.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
Come up and say hello.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
It will be great times.

42:27.000 --> 42:32.000
And earlier today before the show, I was talking about cosplay because I think there is a costume

42:32.000 --> 42:33.000
I can pull off.

42:33.000 --> 42:34.000
That's that's tasteful.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
You're going to pull off your costume?

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
No.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
This is tasteful Slidekick.

42:38.000 --> 42:42.000
He's going to do the gladiator armor from Final Fantasy 14.

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
Oh yeah.

42:44.000 --> 42:45.000
Yes.

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
I'm going to wear the what is the sublegar?

42:46.000 --> 42:47.000
The panties.

42:47.000 --> 42:48.000
The leather mantis.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
No.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
You'd probably be very popular if you wore that.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.000
Yeah.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
No.

42:53.000 --> 42:54.000
No.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
They'll be like, OK, that guy does not have the body to wear something like that.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.000
So.

42:57.000 --> 42:58.000
All right.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
So I will wear something that will keep me covered.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.000
Thank you.

43:01.000 --> 43:05.000
I just turned 35, you know, so I don't need to be showing on my wrinkles.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
Such a press.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
I know.

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
All right.

43:08.000 --> 43:12.000
Anyhow, let's for real get into some of the gaming news this week.

43:12.000 --> 43:18.000
This is the gaming news that may not be on your radar or it's pinging huge on your radar.

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
One or the other.

43:19.000 --> 43:20.000
Right.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
It's like.

43:21.000 --> 43:22.000
Yeah.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.000
All right.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
Start us off.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.000
All right.

43:25.000 --> 43:31.000
So Index Corporation, the I think a pretty recent parent company of Atlas, they are having

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
some problems.

43:32.000 --> 43:41.000
They are basically filing for civil rehabilitation and maybe selling off assets.

43:41.000 --> 43:44.000
I'm assuming.

43:44.000 --> 43:48.400
Basically saying that, you know, the index media or index digital media, Inc. and Atlas

43:48.400 --> 43:53.000
brand are unaffected by the proceedings of, I guess, in Japan.

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
They are going to be carrying on their day to day activities.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
Business as usual.

43:57.000 --> 44:03.000
Shimagami Tensei 4 and Dragon's Crown are still scheduled for release in summer.

44:03.000 --> 44:08.000
And they also have some other titles that they're publishing, including the movie tie

44:08.000 --> 44:12.000
in for R.I.P.D. and I guess Daylight.

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
Oh, yeah.

44:13.000 --> 44:14.000
Daylight.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
I don't even remember what Daylight is.

44:16.000 --> 44:19.000
Daylight is the like survival horror.

44:19.000 --> 44:24.000
You're thrown in a haunted house, I think, with only a flashlight and the PlayStation

44:24.000 --> 44:28.000
I record your scares so that like your friends can laugh at you.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
That's kind of funny.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
So, yeah.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
So I don't know.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
Maybe they're not in too much trouble.

44:35.000 --> 44:39.000
It's hard to say with Atlas because Atlas, they kind of deal with a lot of niche properties.

44:39.000 --> 44:42.000
So for, you know, money seems to be very tight.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
Very small production runs.

44:44.000 --> 44:47.000
Very small everything.

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
Budget.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
So it's hard to say.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
Yeah, I've seen a lot of people worried about them.

44:52.000 --> 44:55.000
But I mean, Atlas is well loved enough that they'll find a home.

44:55.000 --> 44:58.000
A lot of people think that Sony or Nintendo would snap them up.

44:58.000 --> 45:03.000
But I would be wouldn't be surprised if like Gung Ho or somebody would snap them up.

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
Marvelous.

45:04.000 --> 45:07.000
And a lot of people are afraid that EA might snap them up.

45:07.000 --> 45:14.000
I would think it would be like more like a Marvelous or what else?

45:14.000 --> 45:18.000
Access? I don't think it's too big to do that.

45:18.000 --> 45:22.000
But I mean, those are kind of the three niche comp- or three companies that bring over

45:22.000 --> 45:25.000
localized Japanese product nowadays.

45:27.000 --> 45:31.000
I guess maybe there's the other one, too, that's a spinoff of-

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
What the fuck was it called?

45:33.000 --> 45:38.000
There was another spinoff company, too, that does some localization.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
Didn't XSeed just acquire somebody?

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
Yeah, XSeed's Marvelous USA now.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Oh, that's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
They should snap up Atlas, too. That would be great.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
Well, I don't think they're big enough.

45:48.000 --> 45:51.000
I mean, XSeed's, I think, quite small compared to Atlas.

45:51.000 --> 45:54.000
Atlas was kind of growing quite a bit.

45:54.000 --> 45:58.000
I thought they were going to be branching out more into like Western development stuff as well.

45:58.000 --> 46:03.000
Because they tried with Game of Thrones and they have a few Sherlock Holmes games and stuff.

46:03.000 --> 46:06.000
But nothing's really taken off.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
It's too bad because Game of Thrones could have been good.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
Except it was a really bad game.

46:10.000 --> 46:13.000
That PlayStation 3 game you're talking about, the horror game, sounds really good.

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Sounds interesting.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
Better than what they have?

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
Sony I thought had a PlayStation Move game.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
Although I don't know if it's Move anymore.

46:22.000 --> 46:28.000
What was it? That one, it was supposed to be like a teen horror genre type game.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
I don't really know how that was going to work.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
It's like a...

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
I don't even remember the title of it now.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
Because it was that memorable.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
Shadow neck Shannon in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says,

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
What if Microsoft bought Atlas?

46:40.000 --> 46:43.000
They would have a lot of Japanese content on their platform then.

46:45.000 --> 46:49.000
Well, that won't do them any good since they're not putting out the Xbox One in Japan at launch.

46:49.000 --> 46:54.000
It would be an interesting, strategical move, but I think for Microsoft also a risky one.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
You know what I mean?

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
Yeah.

46:58.000 --> 47:04.000
I've heard a couple people say that could be a thing, but I don't think Microsoft really would do it.

47:04.000 --> 47:08.000
I think a lot of Nintendo fanboys would just eat it up if Nintendo would do it though.

47:08.000 --> 47:13.000
That only exists in fanboy imagination, I think.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
But you never know.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
Alright, well let's move on to another story.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
And this is about Saints Row 4.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
Oh, Loki's looking forward to this one.

47:22.000 --> 47:25.000
Well, it's a good thing Loki doesn't live in Australia, or he might be waiting a little bit longer.

47:25.000 --> 47:28.000
Oh, please. Like, Australia stopped me from getting this.

47:28.000 --> 47:31.000
Yeah, right. And I'm sure there's a lot of people in Australia that are saying the same thing.

47:31.000 --> 47:41.000
However, Saints Row 4 is now the first game to be refused classification in the country since Australia released their R18 Plus rating at the start of the year.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
Which doesn't make any sense to me.

47:43.000 --> 47:49.000
Yeah, I thought the whole reason the rating system was out was because when games wouldn't be classified before, they wouldn't be sold.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
Like, I remember Mortal Kombat was in that category.

47:51.000 --> 47:56.000
Yeah, because it was like an R up to 18 or something, or 17 or something.

47:56.000 --> 48:03.000
Well, anyhow, Deep Silver is working on basically a fix for Saints Row 4, but just for that region.

48:03.000 --> 48:09.000
They say they're going to remove the content that could cause offense without reducing the outlandish gameplay the Saints Row fans know and love.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
I don't know how they're going to do that, but good luck.

48:11.000 --> 48:16.000
There's going to be a mod immediately after it comes out that'll put it all right back.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
Especially on PC.

48:18.000 --> 48:24.000
How cute that Australia thinks it could regulate some of that, because on the internet this stuff will just come over instantly.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
I just don't understand.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
It just encourages piracy, too.

48:28.000 --> 48:31.000
But did you hear the reason why it got...

48:31.000 --> 48:34.000
I didn't hear the specific reason why, no. What was it?

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
They have an anal probe.

48:36.000 --> 48:37.000
Oh.

48:37.000 --> 48:38.000
Oh, no.

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
No.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
See, I was wondering where they would take the dildo vat next.

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
No, no, no.

48:42.000 --> 48:43.000
Yeah, they have an anal...

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
Does it have a big satellite?

48:44.000 --> 48:52.000
It basically looks like a giant dildo with a sword hilt or something on it, and you can shove it up the ass of your enemies.

48:52.000 --> 48:55.000
I'm like, this makes me want to buy the game even more.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
I can't wait.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
I got to find...

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
Yeah, you just finished talking there.

49:01.000 --> 49:07.000
I'm going to find the exact description was hilarious.

49:08.000 --> 49:11.000
Didn't an episode of South Park have the anal probe, though?

49:11.000 --> 49:14.000
Wasn't that the first episode? Cartman gets an anal probe?

49:14.000 --> 49:15.000
I think it was.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
The moment he said anal probe, the whole,

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
I like to sing about the moon and the truth,

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
popped into my head in that episode.

49:21.000 --> 49:26.000
Also, I guess games are getting hit left and right in Australia now.

49:26.000 --> 49:31.000
State of Decay is another game that's been refused classification in Australia.

49:31.000 --> 49:35.000
This was just not even that long after Word of Saints Row 4 happened.

49:36.000 --> 49:41.000
Microsoft is evaluating the options with regards to the title's classification.

49:41.000 --> 49:48.000
The Australian classification system plays an important role in ensuring that Australians can only access age-appropriate games and content.

49:48.000 --> 49:51.000
That was one day after Saints Row 4.

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
Wow.

49:55.000 --> 50:00.000
I kind of thought that this was supposed to stop all that censorship stuff, but I guess not.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
Alright, let's see here.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.000
Here we go.

50:03.000 --> 50:06.000
This is the report, or from the report that they filed.

50:06.000 --> 50:11.000
It says, the game includes a weapon referred to the applicant as an alien anal probe.

50:11.000 --> 50:14.000
The applicant states that this weapon can be shoved into enemies' backsides.

50:14.000 --> 50:17.000
The lower half of the weapon resembles a sword hilt.

50:17.000 --> 50:26.000
The upper part contains prong-like appendages which circle around what appears to be a large dildo which runs down the center of the weapon.

50:26.000 --> 50:31.000
When using this weapon, the player approaches a clothed victim from behind and thrusts the weapon between their legs

50:31.000 --> 50:36.000
and then lifts them off the ground before pulling the trigger which launches the victim into the air.

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
Sold!

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
That's not a probe, that's more like a bottle rocket.

50:41.000 --> 50:42.000
You're such a teenager.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
That's an ass launcher.

50:44.000 --> 50:45.000
An ass launcher?

50:45.000 --> 50:46.000
Ass launcher.

50:46.000 --> 50:47.000
Ass master!

50:47.000 --> 50:54.000
Apparently after the probe has been inserted into the victim's anus, the area around their buttocks becomes pixelated,

50:54.000 --> 50:57.000
highlighting that the aim of the weapon is to penetrate the victim's anus.

50:57.000 --> 51:01.000
The weapon can be used during gameplay to enemy characters and civilians.

51:03.000 --> 51:06.000
As long as they don't leave a blood trail, that would just be wrong.

51:06.000 --> 51:15.000
Yeah, and also alien narcotics was the other reason why, I guess, smoking alien narcotics equips the players with superpowers.

51:15.000 --> 51:16.000
Awesome.

51:17.000 --> 51:20.000
Do they actually get superpowers or do they just think they have superpowers?

51:20.000 --> 51:21.000
Who cares.

51:22.000 --> 51:25.000
Alrighty then, let's move on with something else.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
I don't want to be on this planet anymore.

51:27.000 --> 51:32.000
Okay, well, a lot of people are not happy with Microsoft.

51:32.000 --> 51:37.000
And among the people who are unhappy with Microsoft is the creator of Fez, Phil Fish.

51:38.000 --> 51:41.000
Try saying Fez and Phil Fish together three times fast.

51:41.000 --> 51:42.000
Fez, Phil Fish, Phil Fish, Phil Fish.

51:42.000 --> 51:43.000
See?

51:43.000 --> 51:44.000
Cubos.

51:45.000 --> 51:52.000
But basically he's saying that Microsoft was doing nothing to help sell his game on Xbox Live Arcade.

51:53.000 --> 51:54.000
He complained about it on Twitter.

51:54.000 --> 51:58.000
He said Microsoft was our publisher on Xbox 360 and they did nothing.

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
No promotion, no festivals, not a single mention.

52:02.000 --> 52:08.000
In a newsletter or conference, they put us up on their shitty dashboard and somehow fucked that up too.

52:08.000 --> 52:12.000
They put us up on the game marketplace with no cover image.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
The file was missing for a week.

52:15.000 --> 52:23.000
So basically, there's also, he's also saying that Microsoft is charging developers $10,000 for patches and updates.

52:25.000 --> 52:33.000
And there's a lot of crap going on between, with misinformation going from Microsoft,

52:33.000 --> 52:37.000
not telling them about corruption within the file system or anything like that.

52:37.000 --> 52:41.000
So basically, they're like, oh, we don't really care, indie developer.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
We just want you to put your game up there.

52:43.000 --> 52:44.000
We don't, we're not going to promote it.

52:44.000 --> 52:45.000
Just put it there.

52:45.000 --> 52:46.000
We're not going to put anybody behind you.

52:47.000 --> 52:50.000
ActDeft in chat says, Phil Fish, I hate the guy, but he's right in this one.

52:51.000 --> 52:52.000
Yeah.

52:52.000 --> 52:55.000
I mean, yeah, because Microsoft doesn't let people self-publish to the indie.

52:55.000 --> 52:59.000
I mean, they have XNA for self-publishing, although they're not going to be supporting that anymore.

52:59.000 --> 53:06.000
And this is part of why people are mad because you can publish under Microsoft, but then, you know, there's all these other complaints.

53:06.000 --> 53:10.000
Yeah, and Microsoft was charging $10,000 for them to put in a fix in corrupted files.

53:10.000 --> 53:13.000
Yeah, Fez really got screwed by all that business.

53:14.000 --> 53:25.000
And on top of that, Microsoft did confirm that they automatically charged developers for resubmissions of games was scrapped in April, is what they're saying.

53:25.000 --> 53:28.000
But they never told any of the developers about that.

53:28.000 --> 53:32.000
They said that the new policy was retroactive, but they never said anything.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
Well, didn't you have more information on that, Loki?

53:35.000 --> 53:36.000
Nope, I had exactly that information.

53:36.000 --> 53:42.000
And of course, on top of that, you know, Phil Fish is still pissed off about the whole thing.

53:42.000 --> 53:49.000
See, this is kind of funny, I think, because he was complaining that, oh, well, you know, I don't know if he had a patch or something.

53:49.000 --> 53:54.000
First he put out a patch for the game, and it fucked up the game even more than the patch, you know, without the patch.

53:54.000 --> 54:00.000
And so then they pulled the patch, I guess, and he couldn't resubmit the patch or something.

54:00.000 --> 54:03.000
But now that it's free, why isn't he resubmitting the patch?

54:04.000 --> 54:07.000
Perhaps by this point it's just done with the fuckery.

54:07.000 --> 54:15.000
But if he had it done already, if he had that fixed patch done already, I'm assuming he still has the data, why can't he just resubmit it instead of being a complete douche?

54:16.000 --> 54:21.000
I know, because he wants to sell Feds 2, which will be coming out to platforms other than Xbox One.

54:21.000 --> 54:30.000
Unless it's seriously trying to distance himself from Microsoft, which I can see that, trying just to remove any association between your product and Microsoft.

54:30.000 --> 54:37.000
I mean, especially, I mean, keep in mind the bottom line of development is money.

54:38.000 --> 54:44.000
If he's trying to market a next game, it's a smart move to separate it from where it's already been screwed over.

54:44.000 --> 54:48.000
Well, ShadowNextGen in our chat says, Sony was charging for updates too, I believe. It wasn't Microsoft.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
I don't think they were charging that much.

54:50.000 --> 54:55.000
I want to say I remember hearing something like that too, because I remember it was a big deal when Wii U first came out,

54:55.000 --> 54:59.000
is that's why indies were embracing it, is because Nintendo wasn't charging.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
And that was like a huge selling point.

55:04.000 --> 55:07.000
I'm pretty sure, I mean, Sony has to have gotten rid of that since though.

55:07.000 --> 55:15.000
They might have just done it a lot quieter than Microsoft did, because look at all those indies they lured to their E3 press conference.

55:16.000 --> 55:24.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, Earth.

55:25.000 --> 55:31.000
Alright, well speaking of Microsoft, a very interesting patent revealed out of Microsoft.

55:31.000 --> 55:34.000
It was a patent filed back in December of 2011.

55:34.000 --> 55:39.000
This would have been around the time Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary or the Halo remake came out.

55:40.000 --> 55:45.000
It was a patent for a video game that would, quote, have a plurality of game engines running concurrently.

55:45.000 --> 55:53.000
And you might remember, the Halo Anniversary game lets you go between updated visuals and original Xbox back and forth.

55:53.000 --> 56:01.000
Apparently, this is what the patent was out there for, is that it was for remakes of games where you could have original graphics and,

56:01.000 --> 56:07.000
I thought this was interesting, leveraging player emotions tied to the original experience.

56:07.000 --> 56:13.000
However, this may be lost as modern graphics may cause the gamers to lose that feeling of nostalgia.

56:13.000 --> 56:17.000
So it was because of an emotional connection, which I guess I could see that.

56:17.000 --> 56:26.000
I mean like, when I download some of the, there was a whole bunch of these games on Xbox Live Arcade when that first came out, like all the Konami remakes.

56:26.000 --> 56:29.000
And you could play like Gyruss, you could play it with the original graphics or the HD graphics.

56:29.000 --> 56:36.000
You have to play with the original graphics. I can't play with the new graphics because they're not that good and it's hard to see the bullets sometimes.

56:36.000 --> 56:41.000
Well that's a different thing, that's not that you're nostalgic for the old graphics, it's just that you're really lame.

56:41.000 --> 56:42.000
Maybe a little bit.

56:42.000 --> 56:48.000
So, I don't know, sounds like you're smoking some alien narcotics here because I don't see the point.

56:48.000 --> 56:51.000
Weren't we having that discussion though about voice acting today?

56:51.000 --> 56:52.000
Oh, a little bit, yeah.

56:52.000 --> 57:01.000
With Metal Gear, how they updated the voice acting, I mean it was all the same people, but they didn't put the same cheesiness into it, I guess.

57:01.000 --> 57:02.000
I wonder if it's sort of along the same lines.

57:02.000 --> 57:15.000
Well a lot of that happened with the Silent Hill HD remakes too, is that people are extremely partial to the original Silent Hill, but because of contracts and things like that, they couldn't reuse that dialogue in the HD remake, so they redid it.

57:15.000 --> 57:18.000
The original Silent Hill 3 was a lot better.

57:18.000 --> 57:21.000
Slidekick, are you emotionally tied to retro games?

57:21.000 --> 57:28.000
You know what this actually made me think of is when they put out the Star Wars DVDs that had the original video.

57:28.000 --> 57:33.000
I think it might have been like a laser disc transfer or something because that's all they had that wasn't destroyed at that point.

57:33.000 --> 57:34.000
Which one?

57:34.000 --> 57:39.000
The original Star Wars trilogy, they put out a DVD set that was like two discs.

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
Which I have that set.

57:41.000 --> 57:42.000
Yeah, me too.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
That were the theatrical releases.

57:44.000 --> 57:45.000
Yes.

57:45.000 --> 57:48.000
And those I think were redone off of film prints.

57:48.000 --> 57:49.000
Oh, film prints, okay.

57:49.000 --> 57:52.000
So like hand shot first on the laser disc?

57:53.000 --> 58:00.000
I have a version of it. I have the THX remasters on laser disc, or yes indeed he shot first.

58:00.000 --> 58:13.000
We call them the non fucked up remasters because they actually had the whole THX sound, they did all the cleanup, they had the extra, you know where you see the X's flying in the air instead of X wings flying in the air?

58:13.000 --> 58:18.000
They had all of the corrections made but they didn't do any of the changes.

58:18.000 --> 58:21.000
And I got it for 11 bucks.

58:21.000 --> 58:27.000
That's a good point though that people are definitely tied to that emotionally because you bring up the new Star Wars with anybody.

58:27.000 --> 58:32.000
Is there anybody out there, anybody that prefers Lucas's changes in the original trilogy? Anybody?

58:32.000 --> 58:35.000
People with brain damage. I mean, I'm sorry.

58:35.000 --> 58:36.000
Don't offend.

58:36.000 --> 58:37.000
You know what?

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
Diversity, Dark Sakura.

58:39.000 --> 58:40.000
You know what?

58:40.000 --> 58:41.000
What?

58:41.000 --> 58:42.000
Still wrong.

58:42.000 --> 58:46.000
I don't think people are that nostalgic for Xbox One graphics to be honest.

58:47.000 --> 58:56.000
They're redoing the game with, you know, I think it was like Halo 3 or Halo Reach's engine, which is not bad and definitely the graphics look way better.

58:56.000 --> 59:02.000
I don't see the point of having to tax the system that much by running two copies of the game at the same time.

59:02.000 --> 59:06.000
I think it's a little ridiculous because you either sell a copy of the game.

59:06.000 --> 59:14.000
I mean, I wonder if they have the actual data of how many people actually play that game with the new graphics versus old graphics.

59:14.000 --> 59:20.000
And then also a subset of that, how many people play the game with the new graphics and old graphics and use the Kinect to...

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Old graphics, new graphics, old graphics, new graphics.

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
The same people that sit there and yell grenade to throw a grenade.

59:24.000 --> 59:30.000
Grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade.

59:30.000 --> 59:34.000
And you know, HD remasters seem to be pretty popular, so I mean, I don't know why.

59:34.000 --> 59:38.000
But some of them are so good. Like, I am so there for the Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy X.

59:38.000 --> 59:39.000
Oh, that looks gorgeous.

59:39.000 --> 59:45.000
I'm just, I'm running up to the feeder bar. Gimme pellet, gimme pellet. Like, you know, some of that, you know, I'm a sucker for some of it.

59:45.000 --> 59:49.000
You know who I wouldn't want to go up against, you know, using the Kinect and the Halo thing?

59:49.000 --> 59:54.000
The guy that used to do the Micro Machines commercials because, my God, he would fucking own online.

59:54.000 --> 59:57.000
I think he should be relieved that he's dead.

59:57.000 --> 59:58.000
It doesn't matter.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
And John Machida.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000
There's always, there's always a master and an apprentice, okay?

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000
There's somebody out there that's, you know, gonna follow up.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000
For the record.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.000
But if we don't have the proof that he's dead and he's not six feet under, then it's not the real thing.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.000
For the record, he was also Blur in the Transformers movie, just saying.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Did any of you play Mega Man Powered Up for PSP?

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
It was the remake of Mega Man 1.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Yes.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:30.000
It wasn't bad, but they replaced the original Mega Man 1 music, which, you know, one has good music, but I mean, it's not two or three.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000
The GameCube one, too, I think.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Oh, really?

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
I don't think it had the redunk, I can't remember.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
It just had this cutesy music that I was like, no, no, no.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Yeah, it had, like, the new music in it, yeah.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:45.000
It was just too cutesy, so I can understand the nostalgia thing at times, but, you know.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Alright.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Alright, let's move on with some more news.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Dark Soccer's got something for us, then we're gonna get to release dates.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000
I was trying to find out when John Machida died.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Oh, well.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Stories.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000
It was a while ago.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000
It was a while.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000
I hate to say it, it was a while ago.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000
I think it was sometime while I was still in high school, maybe?

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000
I don't know.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Anyway, there is some good news for people who were gonna put some stock into the Xbox

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000
One.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000
They've actually improved the memory performance for the console.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Basically, they, let me see if I can't find exactly the amount.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:31.000
They've actually have now a 32 megabyte of embedded static RAM that's going to make up

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:37.000
the difference in processing speed between what was previously announced for the Xbox

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
One and the PlayStation 4.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:45.000
But, meh, I don't know if it's still gonna be as good.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:51.000
They're saying that right now, that 192 gigabytes a second is theoretically possible.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
I know, what do you think?

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000
32 megabytes of RAM?

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Man, that console must be worth thousands of dollars, said somebody in the 90s.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Well, they're saying it's this embedded static RAM, which I think just means it's a new chip.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:15.000
It just kinda sucks because launch games always are not gonna look as good as games later

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000
in the console's lifespan.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Especially now that they're like, oh, right away we're shipping with more memory.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.000
The games that are prepared for launch probably won't be able to take advantage of that, and

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000
that kinda sucks.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Well, they were saying right now that their original calculations, just as a base calculation,

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:44.000
came up to 128 bytes per block multiplied by 800 megahertz, and that now that they've

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:49.000
been able to reasonably get in their simulations 133 gigabytes a second.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Alright, and I want no excuses if the Xbox One versions are inferior to the PlayStation

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.000
4 versions.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000
That's what I'm just saying.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Now that you're not gonna get your games online, we got more speed.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Hold on a second there.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
You said you added 32 megs of RAM.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000
This should be night and day difference, right?

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
On my 486.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:15.000
I honestly think this is a bunch of just, it's a bullet point to report on and no one

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000
knows what the hell it means.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Why, if they're just gonna add this RAM, why can't the developers just go back and turn

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
up the graphics on level 3?

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Don't they just take a big dial and turn up the graphics?

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000
I guess they could.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000
What they're basically saying this means is that for some of the games that they showed

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.000
in E3 that kind of stuttered along, that it should improve performance dramatically.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
I mean, I'm not sure what this 32 megabyte thing is gonna do.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:40.000
I mean, it has to be something involved with another calculation, like maybe a buffer or

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000
something, I don't know.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.000
It's to save more pictures of you masturbating.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Wow.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.000
On its Kinect.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
It's the fat box one.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:54.000
The 32 megabytes is basically just to put it in its actual, you know, so it runs off

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000
an actual console.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Yeah.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Tigerclaw in chat says, yeah, he's right.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:03.000
The first crop of games won't take full advantage of the hardware until, whoa, what the hell,

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.000
until, don't paste five lines at once when I'm trying to read.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Tigerclaw says, the first crop of games won't take full advantage of the hardware until

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:15.000
a year or so later when the developers finally figured out how to push the hardware to its

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000
limits.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000
But that happens with every console.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000
What was that?

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000
RAM or not?

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000
What was that Rome game?

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Rise.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Rise.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Rise from your wave.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Uh, they were saying that like it looks choppy right now and that like, you know, this might

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.000
smooth out some frame rates or something, but we'll see.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Wow.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:38.000
A fifth dream in that big post he put says the Micro Machines guy is not dead.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Yes.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000
But seriously though, if he was in this, I swore he was dead too.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Well, I mean, I didn't like swear like, God, I hope he's dead.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:50.000
He'd be dead within the first 15 seconds of that, you know, uh, Eddie Murphy movie 1000

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000
kids.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:58.000
So maybe, maybe I'm looking at the Wikipedia article and sure enough, Wiki says he ain't

01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.000
dead.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Huh?

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Well, that's good.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Then maybe I'm thinking of somebody else.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
No, it was, it was, what's his name?

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Um, Chris Lotta.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Hmm.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000
I was thinking of, well, he just needs to come back and do something.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Anything.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.000
I don't care.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.000
I need him talking in something.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.240
Trailer TV movie.

01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:16.240
It doesn't matter.

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:17.240
Yeah.

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:18.240
I was thinking of Chris Lotta.

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:22.320
At least that urban legend, I can understand someone falling for that cause I, I could

01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:25.280
swear, I could swear like I've heard that that guy's dead too.

01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:28.840
It's not like you came on here and said like the kid from the wonder years is Marilyn Manson.

01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:30.720
Like people believe that.

01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:31.720
Yeah.

01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:37.240
It was Chris Lotta that died in 1994 and he was the voice of a Starscream and Cobra commander.

01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:38.240
Oh, okay.

01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:42.240
So I have the stupid transformers analogy in my head.

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:44.320
All right, look, uh, we're getting way off track.

01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:47.280
So why don't we talk about some release dates, some video games that we could play this week

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:49.840
and get our mind off of dead celebrities.

01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:52.720
There is not a much coming out this week.

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:58.320
It's basically just one 3DS game and it's Crash City Mayhem.

01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:02.960
The only reason I think it's kind of cool for the 3DS is it's based off a really old

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:09.040
series called Runabout, which is on the Sega Dreamcast and PlayStation one or, you know,

01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:14.480
if you played it over here in the United States, it was Felony 179, a racing game where the

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:19.160
whole point of the game was a crash in the shit and it was awesome and super glitchy.

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:25.000
I remember one time I took a full size bus, a tour bus, and I tried to go through the

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.600
train tunnel.

01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:29.880
I don't even know how I got it in the train tunnel and I tried to turn around like, you

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:33.960
know, you do an awesome, the Austin Powers movie and it got stuck in there in such a

01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:38.040
way that it started spinning like a helicopter until it got enough speed where it shot straight

01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:39.040
up through the roof.

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:40.040
Hilarious.

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:41.040
Good times.

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:42.040
Yeah, that's it.

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:43.040
That's all that's coming out this week.

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:44.040
All right, well let's go over to Japan.

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:48.920
On July 4th in Japan on the PlayStation three, Loki's really excited.

01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:51.680
Earth Defense Forces four is out.

01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:54.160
I'm may have to import that.

01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:56.440
It'll cost you $71 and 49.

01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:58.000
I may have to import that.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Wow.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Alrighty.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.240
Uh, you could also import for much cheaper, a smart headset three, which is also released

01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:06.720
on the PlayStation three.

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:07.720
Who cares?

01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:08.720
Right?

01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:10.920
How about on the Xbox three 60 also earth defense forces four.

01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:15.000
There's also a limited edition with gold membership for 86 99 I'm assuming that's like

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:19.000
Xbox live Japan cause you know who's paying for Xbox live over there.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Very few people.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000
I'm sure.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.840
Um, nothing of note on the Vita this week.

01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:27.160
I'm just looking at my other releases and nothing really on Wii U either.

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:29.760
Did you know they don't have new super Luigi until July 13th.

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:32.500
Oh, I bet that's the retail release though.

01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:34.800
They probably have the download version, just not the retail release.

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:36.880
Well how about on the Nintendo three as three DS?

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:38.800
There's a couple of games there.

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:44.480
Uh, Toriko gourmet battle comes out as well as mommy Goma, happy sweets farm.

01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:45.800
That sounds nice.

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:49.720
I want to see what, God, I hope it's not another game starring scantily clad characters.

01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:52.280
Oh, it's the little seal cute thing.

01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:53.280
Yes.

01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:56.760
This stars a little seal cute thing and plushies of the little seal.

01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:57.760
Oh God, these things are adorable.

01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:02.060
It looks like they just kind of wither on the ground and they run a farm.

01:08:02.060 --> 01:08:05.000
It's Farmville and they also make sushi rolls.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
It's Farmville.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Rob, that's a sweet roll.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.000
That's a sweet roll.

01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:09.440
That's a Swiss cake.

01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:12.680
Oh, it's a little Debbie roll with the strawberry.

01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:14.840
It's called a Swiss cake.

01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:17.120
Like I said, a little Debbie.

01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:19.760
It's a strawberry shortcake.

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:21.640
I want them to localize that.

01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:23.280
I want a fucking strawberry shortcake.

01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:24.280
Damn.

01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:27.260
You know, we have strawberry cheesecake ice cream at my house.

01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:29.080
That would involve going to my house after the show.

01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:31.000
That would involve no cause that would involve going outside.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.920
I'm sorry to say.

01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:34.280
That's it for Japanese releases.

01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:35.280
Star Sakura.

01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:36.280
How about the UK?

01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:37.600
Stuff.

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:40.120
Stuff and things are coming out.

01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:44.160
What we have on July 3rd is we have Limbo for iPad and iPhone.

01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:45.160
Oh my God.

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:47.120
I need that on my phone.

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:49.120
Not really.

01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:50.840
Mortal Kombat Complete Collection.

01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:52.880
Sorry, Complete Edition.

01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:56.360
They should have called it Complete Collection, but no, I see why because then they would

01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:57.360
have been racist.

01:08:57.360 --> 01:08:58.360
Yeah.

01:08:58.360 --> 01:08:59.360
But that's on PC.

01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:00.720
Well, you know what I mean.

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:03.480
Too many, too many.

01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:10.760
Then we have a scourge outbreak on Xbox 360 and on July 4th we have Trackmania 2 Valley

01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:14.200
and on the 5th we have Dark.

01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:15.200
Sakura?

01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:16.200
No.

01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:17.200
Just Dark.

01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:18.200
Sakura.

01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:20.920
It's a vampire stealth action game.

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:23.640
I don't know why, but that made me think of Craig Ferguson.

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:26.760
Being published by Atlas because they publish Calypso games now.

01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:27.760
Okay.

01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:32.640
It made me think of Craig Ferguson talking about damp being a color.

01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:36.320
Just a couple more news stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week, Loki.

01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:40.000
Or don't.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.560
So there's some cool stuff being added to Steam.

01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:48.840
First off, the source software development kit now is including native support for the

01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:50.080
Oculus Rift.

01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:57.680
So if you have the dev kit, you got more games to play it on or at least hopefully soon.

01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:02.040
So they're really embracing that and that's going to be kind of cool.

01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:06.920
And then finally, the Steam trading cards, it's out of beta.

01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:09.000
Now it's available to everybody.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:15.120
So far it supports 30 games including Team Fortress 2, Faster Than Light, Grid 2, Monaco

01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:23.840
Trying 2, Super Meat Boy, Counter Strike Global Offensive, Portal, Half Life, Don't

01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:25.760
Starve and Borderlands 2.

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:30.520
Okay, so at the risk of sounding like a complete moron, can someone explain to me how the trading

01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:34.560
card thing works because it's not based on achievements.

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:37.560
It's based on time playing the game.

01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:42.440
So I think it might be on achievements, I think it's just based on time playing the

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:43.440
game.

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:44.440
You get so many.

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:45.440
I noticed I have a Steam level now too.

01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:48.200
So you get XP and I think some of that's from the trading cards, right?

01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:51.520
But I got a lot from participating in old sales and things like that.

01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:54.280
Which by the way, July 4th is next week.

01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:55.280
You know what that means.

01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:56.600
Barbecue at my house.

01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:57.600
Well, that and...

01:10:57.600 --> 01:10:58.600
Hide your wallets.

01:10:58.600 --> 01:10:59.600
Hide your wallets.

01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:00.680
Hide your wife.

01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:01.680
Hide your kids.

01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:03.880
Because Steam sales is gonna happen.

01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:05.200
I ain't got cash for that shit.

01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:06.960
And they're slashing all the prices on up here.

01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:07.960
See, here's the thing though.

01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:09.400
I've already bought so much stuff.

01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:12.880
I don't really know if there's much more I need.

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:15.440
All I need is that Civ 5 expansion.

01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:16.880
That's all I need.

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:17.880
Everything else...

01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:18.880
No, Rob.

01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:19.880
You want it.

01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:20.880
You need air.

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:21.880
No.

01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:22.880
I fucking need it.

01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:23.880
The new expansion?

01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:24.880
Which expansion?

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:25.880
Will you die without it?

01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:29.160
Yeah, you need me to get it because otherwise you will not want to be on this program with

01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:30.720
Oh, we'll have Grumpy Dick Rob.

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:33.560
Are you talking about the new expansion coming out in July or the one that's...

01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:34.560
The one that's like a couple weeks.

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:36.120
You know July is tomorrow, right?

01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:40.560
I understand that, but you're talking about the one that's coming out in Brave New World.

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:43.480
It's not gonna be on the Steam sale, but it's something on Steam I need to get.

01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:44.480
Yeah, Brave New World.

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:48.400
I don't remember if that's next week or if that's gonna be the week after next.

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:50.400
I think it's the 8th.

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:53.200
I think they're releasing it just in time for my boyfriend's birthday.

01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:57.200
I think there's like all of two games on Steam right now I'm interested in.

01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:59.240
One of them is that what Miami...

01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:00.240
God, I can't ever...

01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:01.240
Hotline Miami.

01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:02.240
Hotline Miami.

01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:06.640
Because I want to go around shooting people in bloody messes with weird synth music.

01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:08.640
Should have gotten in on that with the Humble Bundle man.

01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:09.640
I know.

01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:10.640
Good prices there.

01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:12.640
But I have bills.

01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:14.640
Oh, bills.

01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:15.640
All right.

01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:16.640
Let's see.

01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:19.640
I just had to do something like go to Alabama.

01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:20.640
All right.

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:21.640
One more story for you guys here.

01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:24.120
And this is a follow up to something we had talked about before.

01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:29.480
Apparently Nintendo may have been easing up a bit on the whole Let's Play video thing.

01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:34.160
Remember that they were really unpopular for a week there because they didn't shut down

01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:38.960
Let's Play videos, but they're like, we're gonna take the money and use it for us if

01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:42.440
you have a Let's Play video that features our newer games.

01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:49.840
Well, a popular YouTuber who goes by Zach Scott at Zach Scott Games on YouTube apparently

01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:54.280
was in an interview with a gaming website where he has returned to making Let's Play

01:12:54.280 --> 01:13:02.040
videos because he heard that high profile Nintendo games were apparently no longer being

01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:03.040
pulled by Nintendo.

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:04.040
Thank you.

01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:06.120
Will you launch?

01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:07.280
You think that's part of it?

01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:09.280
No, no, no.

01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:13.480
Since you mentioned analytics and stuff like that and getting paid on stuff, I just happened

01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:14.960
to check my...

01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:17.420
Well, here's the timing on this.

01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:22.620
It's part of the revenue reports because on May 14th, his ad earnings ceased, but then

01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:25.300
they started again on May 23rd.

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:29.500
So he made a leap of faith since he saw the revenue return and no other claims have been

01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:31.100
made on his videos since.

01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:33.500
So Nintendo may have given up as fast as they implemented it.

01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:36.100
I mean, that's what, two weeks, if even?

01:13:36.100 --> 01:13:39.940
You know, when we talked about this on Game Buoy, this kind of was an unpopular opinion

01:13:39.940 --> 01:13:46.340
actually, but I just didn't really understand people actually making a living off of Let's

01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:47.340
Plays.

01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:48.340
It happens.

01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:52.020
If it works for you, I guess more power to you, but you know.

01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:57.460
Well, as I mentioned before, because I started monetizing some of my YouTube videos, just

01:13:57.460 --> 01:14:04.980
honestly, I wasn't making anything off of them until now, but I only have one video

01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:11.460
that has just about 8,000, 9,000 views on it and 36 bucks right there from just that.

01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:15.200
So if you make a lot of videos and you're consistent about it and a lot of those Let's

01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:18.880
Play videos get a lot more than just 8,000 views.

01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:25.400
So you can make quite a bit of money, you know, and you probably in the wrong fucking

01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:26.400
business.

01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:27.400
This is the last episode.

01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:31.400
Oh, LR, everybody was wonderful these last 11 years, but we're moving to YouTube next

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:35.500
week in our little five minute chunk segments, which will just be Loki and I arguing in dark

01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:36.500
soccer crying.

01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:40.760
Well, no, no, no, Dan and I were actually talking about doing this with our turbo graphics

01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:41.760
games.

01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:42.760
So it'd be fun.

01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:44.080
So yeah, there's money that you made.

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:48.120
I mean, I'm not looking to make a living off of, you know, putting YouTube videos out

01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:54.800
there, but 36, $36 I didn't have before 36 bucks to buy another.

01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:55.800
That's half.

01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:58.720
That's about halfway to the Earth Defense Force for.

01:14:58.720 --> 01:14:59.720
There you go.

01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:00.720
Absolutely.

01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:01.720
Wow.

01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:04.520
Well, you know, and I'm, I'm kind of actually slight kick.

01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:08.880
I know you said that it was an unpopular opinion, but I, I think we talked about this on the

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:09.880
show originally.

01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:12.520
I actually kind of voiced a very similar thing where I'm like, really, you, you can make

01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:13.520
a living off this.

01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:18.640
I mean, it's not, I mean, no shade to those that do very well with let's play videos.

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:19.800
I have a respect it.

01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:21.080
It takes work to do this podcast.

01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:25.040
It takes a lot of work to do is let's play videos, but you have to admit you do owe some

01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:28.600
of the success to the game that you are featuring.

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:29.600
You know what I mean?

01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:30.600
Yeah.

01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:33.280
So if they want to come in and get a cut, but I think Nintendo just kind of did a Dick

01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:35.160
move by cutting it all off.

01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:36.160
You know what I mean?

01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:40.200
Like there should have been some type of sharing, you know, the let's play content gets something,

01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:44.080
Nintendo gets a little something, something too, or, you know, they get their own commercials

01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:47.520
in there, you know, things like that, you know, but yeah, they, they need to take a

01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:51.320
smaller cut, you know, like circumcision, not Lorena Bobbitt.

01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:56.000
That is a great analogy.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Dude.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.280
Oh, thanks.

01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:00.280
I don't want your hands.

01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:02.000
Don't fist bump him for that.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.000
You know, I did.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:08.440
I just, I didn't high five him because I don't, I hope you get the blister thing.

01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:11.600
It's not here, Rob.

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:20.200
You can't get it from touching my hands.

01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:22.160
Clearly you're not afraid of germs.

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:23.360
She starts handling my feces.

01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:29.120
I can't make any promises.

01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:30.120
Do you have a diaper fetish?

01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:31.120
Loki?

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:32.120
No, I do not.

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:33.120
Oh, that's good.

01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:34.120
That's good.

01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:35.120
I thought that was just your dinner.

01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:36.120
That smelled.

01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:42.200
For the record, if you would pay attention, the more you expose yourself to germs, the

01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:43.840
stronger your immune system gets.

01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:44.840
It's very good chance.

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:48.400
If you were a kid that like went to preschool or something like that, you probably already

01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:51.320
have had this and you probably, you won't catch it again.

01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:55.000
So yeah, when you, there's like, for the most part, when kids have this, they don't even

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.520
develop the blisters.

01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:58.240
They'll run a fever and have a sore throat.

01:16:58.240 --> 01:16:59.240
Yeah.

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:02.460
Um, shadow next gen says, YouTube also has a policy where you can't monetize videos for

01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:04.100
content you don't own.

01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:07.880
So this whole thing is a bit confusing to me as to how it was allowed to happen in the

01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:08.880
first place.

01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:14.180
That's a comment from live.vognetwork.com and clerical error 404 follows this up with,

01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:17.540
it's been about 15 years since I heard a Lorena Bobbitt reference.

01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:18.540
You're welcome.

01:17:18.540 --> 01:17:22.020
Keeping it, keeping it classy and old school here at OLR.

01:17:22.020 --> 01:17:23.420
That's way too long.

01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:25.180
Well, here's the thing.

01:17:25.180 --> 01:17:30.700
I think that the whole YouTube policy originally was just to prevent people from, okay, some

01:17:30.700 --> 01:17:36.500
dude makes a video and then I copy said video, put it up on my channel and monetize it.

01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:41.900
Here's me humming along to, uh, this new movie that's out in theaters.

01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:52.900
Um, uh, man of steel, uh, in me and it's my, my little, you know, that would be very bad.

01:17:52.900 --> 01:18:00.380
I think, but anyway, I paid good money for this hue card and I own all the data on it.

01:18:01.380 --> 01:18:06.700
I paid an entire $5 from the garage sale for this hue card.

01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:07.700
I own it.

01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:08.700
All right.

01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:10.900
Dark soccer is clearly stepping into a time portal over there.

01:18:10.900 --> 01:18:11.900
So you know what that means?

01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:16.540
It's time for the classic game of the week.

01:18:16.540 --> 01:18:21.180
Every week, dark soccer goes into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, Hey,

01:18:21.180 --> 01:18:28.220
you kids and your YouTubing and making careers off of Mario, you, you know what you need

01:18:28.220 --> 01:18:29.820
to go back to my day.

01:18:30.260 --> 01:18:35.260
We used to pay $400 for a fricking Neo Geo game and we liked it.

01:18:35.260 --> 01:18:37.940
And really weird games were really cool.

01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:38.940
Yeah.

01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:40.420
Well really weird games are kind of still cool.

01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:41.420
Let's be real.

01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:42.420
All right.

01:18:42.420 --> 01:18:43.420
But this one was weird.

01:18:43.420 --> 01:18:44.420
This one was weird and it's not Neo Geo.

01:18:44.420 --> 01:18:45.420
It's a little newer than that.

01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:46.420
Dark soccer.

01:18:46.420 --> 01:18:47.420
What is the classic game of the week?

01:18:47.420 --> 01:18:49.620
The classic game of the week is Mr. Mosquito.

01:18:49.620 --> 01:18:50.620
It's weird.

01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:55.180
I figured to go for a PS2 era, you know, finally moving up a little bit.

01:18:55.180 --> 01:18:58.740
Mr. Mosquito was, it's Rina's room again.

01:18:58.740 --> 01:18:59.740
Oops.

01:18:59.740 --> 01:19:00.740
You need to skip up slides.

01:19:00.740 --> 01:19:01.740
Go ahead.

01:19:01.740 --> 01:19:02.740
Oh, okay.

01:19:02.740 --> 01:19:08.100
Mr. Mosquito, which was actually spelled M-O-S-K-E-E-T-O in the PAL regions.

01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:15.020
It also is known as KA in Japan, which just means mosquito, was put out by, well developed

01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:17.780
by Zoom Inc for the PS2.

01:19:17.780 --> 01:19:23.740
And it was released in Japan on June 21st, 2001 and the following March in everywhere

01:19:23.740 --> 01:19:24.740
else.

01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:28.100
And it was distributed by Eidos.

01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:36.020
Basically, you play as a mosquito who has taken a residence in the Yamada family's house.

01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:43.140
And it's, I wonder if they were voiced by the Japanese voice actors because the accents

01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:44.140
are really thick.

01:19:44.140 --> 01:19:46.820
I mean, they're legit accents too.

01:19:46.820 --> 01:19:53.220
So anyway, you have to stock up on enough blood in the summer so that you will survive

01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:55.860
through the winter ahead, which is funny because like don't mosquitoes only live for

01:19:55.860 --> 01:19:57.500
like a week.

01:19:57.500 --> 01:20:04.620
Anyway, so you have, you can collect these spheres to save extra blood and you have to

01:20:04.620 --> 01:20:09.220
suck the blood from them while they're going about their everyday business, but you can

01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:12.420
only get it from certain body parts at certain times.

01:20:12.420 --> 01:20:17.580
Like this scene here with the girl on her bed, you can only suck it from like her upper

01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:18.580
thigh.

01:20:18.580 --> 01:20:20.420
He's getting a little close to the no-no spot.

01:20:20.420 --> 01:20:23.460
So this is a little bit of a scandalous game.

01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:26.860
He's actually close to the femoral artery.

01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:33.220
Anyway, if he is swatted while sucking, then instant death occurs.

01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:39.620
Basically, you have a stress meter, so you have to balance your suck with your stress.

01:20:39.620 --> 01:20:41.940
Don't we all?

01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:47.340
And then to calm them, basically they will try to battle you too, like a big boss battle,

01:20:47.340 --> 01:20:52.220
like what we're watching right now in this video, where you have stress points that you

01:20:52.220 --> 01:20:59.100
have to, I guess, sting them on or bite them on that are meant to calm them.

01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:04.140
So it's like you're doing acupressure on them.

01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:05.700
You're doing mosquito shiatsu.

01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:07.340
There you go.

01:21:07.340 --> 01:21:09.340
You can get smacked all over the room and it's really hilarious.

01:21:09.340 --> 01:21:10.900
So you have different stages.

01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:16.220
You can go through different parts of the house and you have different items, different

01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:19.100
things to help you.

01:21:19.100 --> 01:21:27.060
The fun thing about this game too is that your ending depends on how much sucking you did,

01:21:27.060 --> 01:21:32.380
like how successful you were, because for the Yamada family, they're going to have their

01:21:32.380 --> 01:21:35.220
family portrait taken at the end of the summer.

01:21:35.220 --> 01:21:40.020
And it's like if you completed all the missions and everything, they're all puffed up and

01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:43.020
swollen all over their faces and the picture is horrible.

01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:44.740
And it's really funny.

01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:49.140
The voice acting is actually super hilarious too.

01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:54.220
As for the game, it was voted one of the top 10 weirdest games of all time in 2008 by Game

01:21:54.220 --> 01:22:03.940
Informer and G4 put it on its list of weird games.

01:22:03.940 --> 01:22:09.300
It was really weird, but Famitsu said it was the fifth best selling video game in Japan

01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:11.100
during its release.

01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:19.660
It sold 41,006 copies and it also got a release on PlayStation 2 the best.

01:22:19.660 --> 01:22:25.740
And it led to a sequel in Japan on July 3rd, 2003 called KA 2 Let's Go Hawaii.

01:22:25.740 --> 01:22:29.900
And that came out only, of course, like I said, in Japan and it's the Yamada family

01:22:29.900 --> 01:22:33.540
again and they're going on vacation, has like new stuff going on.

01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:38.780
I kind of want the sequel just because it like has extra stuff going on and you can

01:22:38.780 --> 01:22:40.940
suck anywhere on them.

01:22:40.940 --> 01:22:44.300
And a different relaxation system, so I think it would be fun.

01:22:44.300 --> 01:22:47.140
But this game was just wrong and like you could do other stuff too.

01:22:47.140 --> 01:22:50.620
Like you could distract the people in the room by like turning off the light switch

01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:53.260
or changing the music or doing all this other stuff.

01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:55.500
It's just bizarre, but it works.

01:22:55.500 --> 01:22:58.940
It's a very strange game, but it's awesome.

01:22:58.940 --> 01:23:01.420
Like it's you just you have to see it.

01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:05.020
And like this week I wanted to pick games that were along the same vein of Incredible

01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:07.660
Crisis because that game was fucked up.

01:23:07.660 --> 01:23:12.580
And this game, I'd have to put it's fucked up in this level somewhere near Incredible

01:23:12.580 --> 01:23:13.580
Crisis.

01:23:13.580 --> 01:23:14.580
So.

01:23:14.580 --> 01:23:15.580
All right.

01:23:15.580 --> 01:23:16.580
KA.

01:23:16.580 --> 01:23:17.580
There it is.

01:23:17.580 --> 01:23:18.580
Your classic game of the week.

01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:20.460
Mr. Mosquito on the PlayStation 2.

01:23:20.460 --> 01:23:21.460
KA.

01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:22.780
All right.

01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:24.160
Very good pick tonight.

01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:25.160
A little bit edumacational.

01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:26.160
I know.

01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:27.160
All right.

01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:28.160
Don't go anywhere, guys.

01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:30.940
We've got plenty more OLR to come tonight with more Slidekick.

01:23:30.940 --> 01:23:33.140
The Frugal Question of the Week coming at you.

01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:36.060
We're going to talk a little bit about Ouya and the Frugal Question of the Week as well

01:23:36.060 --> 01:23:37.420
as some news.

01:23:37.420 --> 01:23:41.260
And also we'll talk about the upcoming Moli Jam.

01:23:41.260 --> 01:23:42.260
That's always hilarious.

01:23:42.260 --> 01:23:44.380
So we're going to talk about that.

01:23:44.380 --> 01:23:47.740
All that and more including your phone calls, the FUs of the Week, Twitter topics and all

01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:51.540
that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

01:23:51.540 --> 01:23:52.540
Hola.

01:23:52.540 --> 01:23:59.140
This is your friendly neighborhood Mexican actor.

01:23:59.140 --> 01:24:10.780
And you're participating with Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.

01:24:10.780 --> 01:24:14.540
And I want to use my voice to tell you that Kirby does not suck.

01:24:14.540 --> 01:24:19.740
Well, literally he does suck, but not fear of the people.

01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:22.780
Anyways, play more Kirby.

01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:23.780
Play more Kirby.

01:24:23.780 --> 01:24:24.780
Do it now.

01:24:24.780 --> 01:24:25.780
Well, not now.

01:24:25.780 --> 01:24:26.780
Because you're trying to listen to OLR, but.

01:24:26.780 --> 01:24:27.780
Poor guy, man.

01:24:27.780 --> 01:24:36.540
I know we're here pitching.

01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:37.540
That's like tomorrow, though.

01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:38.540
By the way.

01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:40.540
I did look up Phoenix.

01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:43.540
Phoenix is at one hundred and sixteen.

01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:44.540
On fire.

01:24:44.540 --> 01:24:45.860
What about needles in Death Valley?

01:24:45.860 --> 01:24:51.300
That's always the place to look at just like a hundred and twenty two.

01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:53.620
Anyhow, that was a repeat bumper there.

01:24:53.620 --> 01:24:54.980
That means we need more bumpers.

01:24:54.980 --> 01:24:58.960
I mean, I'm sure Act Deft is happy to have his voice played on the show all the time,

01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:01.380
as well as some of our other repeats we'll get into.

01:25:01.380 --> 01:25:06.100
But Orange Lounge Radio, the place where Act Deft has a voice.

01:25:06.100 --> 01:25:10.180
If you want to get your voice heard, go over to our forums at Vogue Network dot com, click

01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:12.220
on forums and check out the Orange Lounge Radio forum.

01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:14.460
The call for bumpers is there.

01:25:14.460 --> 01:25:15.460
And it's very easy.

01:25:15.460 --> 01:25:18.180
You can even Skype them in if you don't know it, like don't you don't have to put the music

01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:19.180
together or anything like that.

01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:21.820
All you got to do is give me give me your voice.

01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:23.540
I'm like Ursula on The Little Mermaid.

01:25:23.540 --> 01:25:24.700
That's all I want is your voice.

01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:26.260
And Rob's going to put it to Eurobeat.

01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:27.260
That's right.

01:25:27.260 --> 01:25:28.980
I may put the next one to Eurobeat.

01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:29.980
Be careful.

01:25:29.980 --> 01:25:30.980
All right.

01:25:30.980 --> 01:25:31.980
That would be awesome.

01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:36.860
So before we get back into gaming news and rapid fire news, Slidekick, I realize there

01:25:36.860 --> 01:25:40.460
was one game neither one of us brought up in our gaming weeks this week.

01:25:40.460 --> 01:25:43.460
But before the show tonight, we played Press Your Luck.

01:25:43.460 --> 01:25:44.460
We did.

01:25:44.460 --> 01:25:45.460
We did.

01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:50.220
And you sure love to rub it in how good a game show video games you are, huh?

01:25:50.220 --> 01:25:52.940
I guess I just have a natural talent.

01:25:52.980 --> 01:25:55.060
Do you practice Wheel of Fortune a lot as a kid?

01:25:55.060 --> 01:25:56.060
No.

01:25:56.060 --> 01:25:57.980
Well, I played a lot of Wheel of Fortune as a kid, but I mean.

01:25:57.980 --> 01:25:58.980
Five thousand pass.

01:25:58.980 --> 01:26:01.220
We've had a Wheel of Fortune winner on the show.

01:26:01.220 --> 01:26:02.220
Yes, I know.

01:26:02.220 --> 01:26:03.220
Yes.

01:26:03.220 --> 01:26:05.140
I kind of think I need to actually go on Wheel of Fortune.

01:26:05.140 --> 01:26:09.020
Our buddy Mel, who needs to come back to the show, by the way, actually won a car on Wheel

01:26:09.020 --> 01:26:10.020
of Fortune like years.

01:26:10.020 --> 01:26:11.020
It was during.

01:26:11.020 --> 01:26:12.020
Wow.

01:26:12.020 --> 01:26:13.020
His price is right.

01:26:13.020 --> 01:26:14.020
No, it was on Wheel of Fortune.

01:26:14.020 --> 01:26:15.020
It was on Wheel of Fortune.

01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:16.020
Because he even put up the clip of him winning.

01:26:16.020 --> 01:26:17.020
Yeah.

01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:21.180
His Facebook cover photo is him solving the pumpkin pie or whatever his final thing was.

01:26:21.180 --> 01:26:24.300
And I have been in that Camaro and it was a bitchin' Camaro.

01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:26.860
I have a coworker that won a car on Price is Right.

01:26:26.860 --> 01:26:27.860
Really?

01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:28.860
Yeah.

01:26:28.860 --> 01:26:29.860
He won the car and like a China cabinet.

01:26:29.860 --> 01:26:30.860
Lord.

01:26:30.860 --> 01:26:33.420
And the sucky thing they never tell you about winning prizes like that is that you have

01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:34.420
to pay taxes.

01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:35.940
All these game show winners.

01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:38.420
Oh, Alan's here to lend his commentary.

01:26:38.420 --> 01:26:39.740
Yes, Alan.

01:26:39.740 --> 01:26:41.620
Talking about Price is Right, just remind me of something.

01:26:41.620 --> 01:26:43.980
There's going to be an all Plinko episode in September.

01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:44.980
What?

01:26:44.980 --> 01:26:45.980
Yeah.

01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:46.980
All Plinko.

01:26:46.980 --> 01:26:47.980
August or September.

01:26:47.980 --> 01:26:48.980
Google it.

01:26:48.980 --> 01:26:49.980
If I'm working, I'm just going to quit and watch.

01:26:50.980 --> 01:26:51.980
Viewing party.

01:26:51.980 --> 01:26:52.980
Kidding.

01:26:52.980 --> 01:26:53.980
Kidding.

01:26:53.980 --> 01:26:57.540
I've never heard of a better reason to quit your job.

01:26:57.540 --> 01:27:01.860
And you get Plinko and you get Plinko and you get Plinko for everyone.

01:27:01.860 --> 01:27:05.740
I'm surprised it's taken them 35 years or something to think about Plinko.

01:27:05.740 --> 01:27:06.740
If they want.

01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:13.340
See, PopCap telling you if you're smart, you market that son of a bitch on that show right

01:27:13.340 --> 01:27:14.340
there.

01:27:14.340 --> 01:27:15.340
Right?

01:27:15.340 --> 01:27:16.340
Pagle 2.

01:27:16.340 --> 01:27:17.340
Plinko.

01:27:17.340 --> 01:27:19.340
Robby, we're getting a little pressed during Press Your Luck, weren't you?

01:27:19.700 --> 01:27:22.060
Well, I was getting very pressed during Press Your Luck.

01:27:22.060 --> 01:27:23.060
How many whammies did you have?

01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:28.540
I had three whammies in the first round and fucking, okay, so like I actually uploaded

01:27:28.540 --> 01:27:32.860
to my Twitter, twitter.com slash SKIE, that's Sky, twitter.com slash Sky.

01:27:32.860 --> 01:27:37.860
I've always liked more followers, but I actually posted a picture of this like slidekick.

01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:42.060
I hate you so much because like it's me and I have three whammies and no money and he

01:27:42.060 --> 01:27:43.060
has like no whammies.

01:27:43.060 --> 01:27:44.060
He has like $7,000.

01:27:44.060 --> 01:27:47.140
And I ended up with like over $50,000.

01:27:47.140 --> 01:27:50.860
Were you like the unemployed man who memorized the patterns and just sat and watched it?

01:27:50.860 --> 01:27:51.860
Yes, he was.

01:27:51.860 --> 01:27:52.860
No, I just got lucky.

01:27:52.860 --> 01:27:53.860
You know what happened to that guy, by the way?

01:27:53.860 --> 01:27:54.860
He died.

01:27:54.860 --> 01:27:55.860
No, besides that.

01:27:55.860 --> 01:27:56.860
What?

01:27:56.860 --> 01:27:58.940
He ended up in, he went on all the trips and everything and ended up investing the money

01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:02.940
in like the scheme and he lost all of it.

01:28:02.940 --> 01:28:03.940
Oh, poor guy.

01:28:03.940 --> 01:28:06.740
If you come into money, be smart.

01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:08.900
You know, you can have one of my two trips to Rio, Rob.

01:28:08.900 --> 01:28:09.900
It's okay.

01:28:09.900 --> 01:28:10.900
Shut up.

01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:11.900
It wasn't real.

01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:15.060
It wasn't real as the lengthy disclaimer when you boot up the game lets you know that the

01:28:15.060 --> 01:28:16.300
prizes are not real.

01:28:16.300 --> 01:28:18.140
It's not a contest.

01:28:18.140 --> 01:28:22.820
If I can make money winning game show video games, I just quit my job and do that in a

01:28:22.820 --> 01:28:23.820
let's plays.

01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:25.940
You know what would be the best job ever?

01:28:25.940 --> 01:28:26.940
You should be a sweeper.

01:28:26.940 --> 01:28:31.180
You'd be one of those soccer moms that does nothing but enter sweepstakes for a living.

01:28:31.180 --> 01:28:32.180
Oh, it's my dream.

01:28:32.180 --> 01:28:33.180
Basically.

01:28:33.180 --> 01:28:34.180
I'm kind of surprised.

01:28:34.180 --> 01:28:35.180
Alan's really into couponing.

01:28:35.180 --> 01:28:37.540
Alan, why aren't you into sweeping?

01:28:37.540 --> 01:28:40.580
That should be your next hobby.

01:28:40.580 --> 01:28:41.580
It says I'm not a 1950.

01:28:41.740 --> 01:28:44.740
We can get you a string of pearls and an apron.

01:28:44.740 --> 01:28:45.740
Okay.

01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:46.740
That's a little bit awkward.

01:28:46.740 --> 01:28:47.740
All right.

01:28:47.740 --> 01:28:48.740
What were you going to say?

01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:49.740
They're sorry.

01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:50.740
I forgot.

01:28:50.740 --> 01:28:51.740
Really cut you off.

01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:52.740
I forgot.

01:28:52.740 --> 01:28:53.740
It's for the best.

01:28:53.740 --> 01:28:54.740
All right.

01:28:54.740 --> 01:28:55.740
No whammies.

01:28:55.740 --> 01:28:56.740
Stop.

01:28:56.740 --> 01:29:01.660
Uh, dark Tetsuya says, I was just going to ask, are the patterns in the video game version

01:29:01.660 --> 01:29:02.860
like the old game show?

01:29:02.860 --> 01:29:03.860
No.

01:29:03.860 --> 01:29:04.860
And they're a lot more randomized.

01:29:04.860 --> 01:29:05.860
I highly doubt.

01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:07.440
Slidekick had the time to memorize them.

01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:11.100
It's if you hit X as fast as you can, you seem to never hit a whammy and slidekick figure

01:29:11.100 --> 01:29:12.780
that out in about five seconds.

01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:19.940
Well, one thing, one thing to is that after this guy basically broke the system, earning

01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:24.180
all that money, um, they changed the patterns and added an extra randomizer.

01:29:24.180 --> 01:29:26.060
So, Oh yeah.

01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:27.340
He made them change the game show.

01:29:27.340 --> 01:29:28.340
Yeah.

01:29:28.340 --> 01:29:33.880
And basically they couldn't actually call him out on cheating because he did what anyone

01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:34.880
could do.

01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:35.880
Yeah, no, he didn't cheat.

01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:39.020
They just told him he's not allowed to play again.

01:29:39.940 --> 01:29:41.980
Uh, I w I, it's not my fault.

01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:44.820
Slidekick was just pushing X as fast as he could and winning everything, but I was trying

01:29:44.820 --> 01:29:45.820
to get all into it.

01:29:45.820 --> 01:29:47.380
I was like, no whammies.

01:29:47.380 --> 01:29:50.220
Don't you fucking give me a whammy because you know, I can swear in my own house.

01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:52.660
Don't you fucking give me a whammy or I'm going to come back there and cut the power

01:29:52.660 --> 01:29:53.660
cord.

01:29:53.660 --> 01:29:54.660
You piece of shit.

01:29:54.660 --> 01:29:55.660
No whammies.

01:29:55.660 --> 01:29:56.660
Stop.

01:29:56.660 --> 01:29:57.660
And then I did a whammy.

01:29:57.660 --> 01:29:59.980
I'm going to take all your money.

01:29:59.980 --> 01:30:03.880
At least it was 80s style pressure luck and not that shitty game show.

01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:06.620
Like an uncensored game show on TV.

01:30:06.620 --> 01:30:10.460
Not necessarily that they have to have all the TNA and stuff, but like I'm just saying,

01:30:10.460 --> 01:30:13.300
you know, we're just like, fuck, God damn it.

01:30:13.300 --> 01:30:15.960
You know, why did I say that?

01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:17.780
That's like the wrong answer completely.

01:30:17.780 --> 01:30:20.020
You know, this is motherfucking jeopardy.

01:30:20.020 --> 01:30:25.340
And then you can also get like bonus points based on how well you're judged.

01:30:25.340 --> 01:30:30.260
We're all the, we're all the, uh, trivia answers have to start with what the fuck, what the

01:30:30.260 --> 01:30:33.740
fuck is, I don't care, Alex.

01:30:33.740 --> 01:30:35.360
That makes me think of the price is right.

01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:39.580
Where you, you're the really hard ones where you have to step on the floor to step out

01:30:39.580 --> 01:30:40.580
the price of the car.

01:30:40.580 --> 01:30:43.940
They always looked at their family members and they can just be like, I fucking hate

01:30:43.940 --> 01:30:44.940
my family.

01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:45.940
You're all fucking walking home.

01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:46.940
Fuck you.

01:30:46.940 --> 01:30:48.620
And like Drew Carey's all really uncomfortable.

01:30:48.620 --> 01:30:50.500
Oh God.

01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:52.620
All right.

01:30:52.620 --> 01:30:55.140
Uh, moving on.

01:30:55.140 --> 01:30:56.540
We're talking too long about game shows.

01:30:56.540 --> 01:30:57.540
Actually.

01:30:57.540 --> 01:30:58.540
You can never talk too long about game shows.

01:30:58.540 --> 01:30:59.540
Okay.

01:30:59.540 --> 01:31:02.420
Is that the pressure like game that I got you like ages ago?

01:31:02.420 --> 01:31:03.420
The DVD game.

01:31:03.420 --> 01:31:04.420
We'll have that.

01:31:04.420 --> 01:31:09.180
Uh, I was going to say, I've talked about before how badly I need to go on a reality

01:31:09.180 --> 01:31:14.820
game show and I don't think I could do survivor because if I didn't eat for 13 days, I would

01:31:14.820 --> 01:31:15.940
be the biggest bitch.

01:31:15.940 --> 01:31:17.260
I get voted out so fast.

01:31:17.260 --> 01:31:19.540
If I didn't eat for one day, I'd be a bitch.

01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:20.540
Let's be real.

01:31:20.540 --> 01:31:21.900
I can't go on big brother.

01:31:21.900 --> 01:31:24.380
No, you would be a big bitch if you didn't have Pinkberry near you.

01:31:24.380 --> 01:31:27.700
I can't go on big brother anymore because I don't know if y'all are following this season,

01:31:27.700 --> 01:31:29.380
but what a bunch of racists.

01:31:29.380 --> 01:31:32.100
I mean, it's pretty sick in that house right now.

01:31:32.300 --> 01:31:36.100
Paula Deen ain't got nothing on some of those people in the big brother house this season.

01:31:36.100 --> 01:31:42.300
Uh, and then, um, so I was going to say there's a new show on ABC that's pretty fucking hilarious.

01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:47.940
It's called who done it and it's like, it's like clue meets the mole, which by the way,

01:31:47.940 --> 01:31:50.940
I know a lot of you judge reality TV shows and that's fine.

01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:56.300
A lot of it needs to be judged, but the mole was the best reality game show they ever had.

01:31:56.300 --> 01:31:59.340
I'm like, if you're going to try any reality TV, do the mole.

01:31:59.340 --> 01:32:02.660
So somebody decided to adapt the mole into like a clue game called who done it.

01:32:02.660 --> 01:32:08.300
But here's the great part is that at the end of the episode, whoever scored the lowest

01:32:08.300 --> 01:32:11.100
on the quiz dies.

01:32:11.100 --> 01:32:13.300
They become the victim in the next episode.

01:32:13.300 --> 01:32:16.740
So the episode literally like the first episode aired, right?

01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:20.860
And so the guy who lost and didn't get the case right and got the lowest on the quiz,

01:32:20.860 --> 01:32:24.980
he runs out at the very end, somebody set him on fire and he falls into the pool dead

01:32:24.980 --> 01:32:28.940
and he's all like, like it's, it's like, obviously it's all fake, it's makeup and all that stuff,

01:32:28.940 --> 01:32:32.220
but all these people on Twitter were like, did they start killing people on TV?

01:32:32.220 --> 01:32:33.220
What the fuck?

01:32:33.220 --> 01:32:34.220
Ratings.

01:32:34.220 --> 01:32:35.220
Oh my God.

01:32:35.220 --> 01:32:36.220
Right.

01:32:36.220 --> 01:32:40.440
But I was like, dude, he lost this game and he literally had to die in a fire.

01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:42.260
That is amazing.

01:32:42.260 --> 01:32:43.380
Like the dark soccer, right?

01:32:43.380 --> 01:32:47.340
This game is the closest we're going to get to battle royale.

01:32:47.340 --> 01:32:49.780
Happy hunger games.

01:32:49.780 --> 01:32:52.660
They're supposed to be a hunger games game show on CW this year.

01:32:52.660 --> 01:32:58.380
Yes, but it's not, it's not hunger games, but it's so fucking obviously a thirsty rip

01:32:58.380 --> 01:32:59.580
off of the hunger games.

01:32:59.580 --> 01:33:02.240
It's like, wait, let me your book.

01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:03.240
What the hunger games?

01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:06.540
It's on his Kindle.

01:33:06.540 --> 01:33:10.060
This is why I hate Kindle shit.

01:33:10.060 --> 01:33:11.060
All right.

01:33:11.060 --> 01:33:18.540
There's a thing called the internet where it's probably there.

01:33:18.540 --> 01:33:21.920
I like books where I can smell paper and ink.

01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:22.920
What is the name?

01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:23.920
And cry.

01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:25.580
Somebody in chat has to know this show I'm talking about.

01:33:25.580 --> 01:33:26.780
It's on the CW.

01:33:26.780 --> 01:33:31.080
It's um, cause you know, the CW doesn't have anything except the whose line is it anyway?

01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:33.620
Reboot starts on a couple of weeks.

01:33:33.620 --> 01:33:34.620
Really soon.

01:33:34.620 --> 01:33:35.620
I'll have to watch that.

01:33:35.620 --> 01:33:40.820
And it has the lady who just Googled CW, a hunger game show.

01:33:40.820 --> 01:33:41.820
It's called the hunt.

01:33:41.820 --> 01:33:42.820
The hunt.

01:33:42.820 --> 01:33:46.940
It's not the hunger games, the hunt.

01:33:46.940 --> 01:33:47.940
It's just like it though.

01:33:47.940 --> 01:33:50.320
I'll tell you the 10 years from now, battle royale.

01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:54.960
The one I can't wait for on ABC is called the quest, which is supposed to be the amazing

01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:57.320
race meets a LARP.

01:33:57.320 --> 01:33:58.320
Oh my God.

01:33:58.320 --> 01:33:59.320
That sounds awesome.

01:33:59.320 --> 01:34:00.320
I would watch that one.

01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:02.480
I was like, how do I get cast for this show?

01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:04.800
Because I want to fuck, like I would want to fucking go on the quest.

01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:05.800
It's like a LARP.

01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:06.800
LARPers of the world unite.

01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:07.800
It'd be amazing.

01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:09.800
Anyway, it's like the producer.

01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:10.800
I am.

01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:12.440
I was a proud former LARPer.

01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:13.440
It's the amazing.

01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:15.760
Well, I did Rocky or a picture show, which is really close.

01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:16.760
Okay.

01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:21.080
It's, it's the amazing race producers and the Lord of the rings producers or something

01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:22.080
like that.

01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:26.240
It's when you go to a live action vampire game and you see the people actually rigged

01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:28.840
up with the fake blood and everything, spraying it everywhere.

01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:29.840
That's awesome.

01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:33.160
I've seen the people throw the magic bags, the little bags that are supposed to be like,

01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:34.160
I'm throwing.

01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:35.160
I see you.

01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:38.400
You can't see me.

01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:39.400
Oh my God.

01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:40.400
Oh my God.

01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:42.720
We need to have an OL LARP.

01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:43.720
No.

01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:47.200
And for, for anyone who would pay money to charity, of course, a charity.

01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:50.000
If we did an OL LARP, who would pay money?

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:51.000
I would.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:57.040
For the record, what I did to Rob was I did the obfuscate thing, which is also stolen

01:34:57.040 --> 01:34:58.040
by John Cena.

01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:02.760
If you watch wrestling, wrestling reference, Bobby, ah, anyway, but he does the waving

01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:06.080
his hand in his face and it's the, you can't see where I am type thing.

01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:10.400
You know, Melody was just asking me how she could raise money for her team and training

01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:11.920
thing that she's doing.

01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:14.160
I will flarp OL LARP.

01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:15.160
I love it.

01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:16.160
Loki.

01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:17.160
Are you going to do it?

01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:18.160
Come on.

01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:19.160
Sounds so ridiculous.

01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:24.440
I'm so fucking excited.

01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:26.720
All right, let's move on.

01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:27.720
And Rob, what?

01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:29.120
Here, here's the rule.

01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:30.120
Okay.

01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:31.120
Here's the rule.

01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:33.520
We each pick a video game character and we have to cosplay.

01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:34.520
Nope.

01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:35.520
Nope.

01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:36.520
Nope.

01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:37.520
Nope.

01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:38.520
You don't have to do tingling.

01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:39.520
Nope.

01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:40.520
You can do your sack boy.

01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:41.520
You should walk around and sass sack boy.

01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:42.520
Yeah.

01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:43.520
Yeah.

01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:48.400
We have to, we have to go out to Vacaville in the nut tree.

01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:51.800
Play in the 112 degree.

01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:57.040
No, for the, for the, for anyone who doesn't know he's on the ground, he's not moving behind

01:35:57.040 --> 01:36:00.680
the nut tree is where the old Ren fairgrounds used to be.

01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:01.680
That would be perfect.

01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:05.620
You know where we used to do LARP, Rob, we used to do it in the courtyard at my college

01:36:05.620 --> 01:36:07.800
of the university of South Alabama.

01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:11.040
And because that's the only thing there is to do that's exciting in Alabama, it's still

01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:12.040
going on.

01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:13.040
Probably.

01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:15.860
Act Def wants to know what does the F in flarp stand for?

01:36:15.860 --> 01:36:17.820
You only know if you, if you like homestuck.

01:36:17.820 --> 01:36:19.180
Oh God.

01:36:19.180 --> 01:36:20.900
All right.

01:36:20.900 --> 01:36:23.740
And of course, Raginator says, uh, Loki should LARP is tingle.

01:36:23.740 --> 01:36:24.740
All right.

01:36:24.740 --> 01:36:25.740
He won't.

01:36:25.740 --> 01:36:26.740
All right.

01:36:26.740 --> 01:36:27.740
Let's do some rapid fire news.

01:36:27.740 --> 01:36:31.220
Cause we're 12 minutes into part B and haven't even touched rapid fire news yet.

01:36:31.220 --> 01:36:32.220
They would slide kick.

01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:33.220
This is all your fault.

01:36:33.220 --> 01:36:37.420
It would be potentially cooler though than wearing that sack boy costume because that

01:36:37.420 --> 01:36:43.100
day is like two or three layers of sweats in the summer.

01:36:43.100 --> 01:36:44.100
Yeah.

01:36:44.620 --> 01:36:45.620
That'll be fun.

01:36:45.620 --> 01:36:46.620
All right.

01:36:46.620 --> 01:36:51.620
Anyways, so Nordic games, you know, they've been acquiring and acquiring and acquiring,

01:36:51.620 --> 01:36:56.220
you know, they bought up a bunch of the old THQ properties and now they're buying up some

01:36:56.220 --> 01:37:01.860
of Atari's properties, including, uh, Desperados and silver.

01:37:01.860 --> 01:37:08.140
Um, and you may remember Atari, you know, they've been selling off parts of their company.

01:37:08.140 --> 01:37:10.540
So I wonder who's buying Marvin Mettis, seriously.

01:37:10.540 --> 01:37:17.140
Um, and I guess they, um, I'm not sure what they're going to do with it, but you know,

01:37:17.140 --> 01:37:19.500
make some Westerns, I guess.

01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:25.420
I don't know, uh, silver I've not really, I'm not familiar with, but I guess that came

01:37:25.420 --> 01:37:31.100
out, uh, was a action RPG in, uh, on the PC and Dreamcast back in 99.

01:37:31.100 --> 01:37:34.060
So huh, interesting.

01:37:34.060 --> 01:37:39.940
Um, Retro City Rampage, the PC version has been adding some new updates, including a

01:37:40.180 --> 01:37:42.260
mod support, which is pretty sweet.

01:37:42.260 --> 01:37:47.060
You can create your own vehicles and characters, fonts, color palettes, et cetera.

01:37:47.060 --> 01:37:53.380
Uh, they have a new retro plus mode, which, uh, adds some more, um, you know, visual effects,

01:37:53.380 --> 01:37:58.820
including soft shadows and doubling the number of colors on screen.

01:37:58.820 --> 01:38:05.820
And um, also, I guess, uh, this is going to be coming, uh, on steam via automatic update

01:38:05.860 --> 01:38:10.860
and then on good old games, uh, you have to log in and just redownload, I guess, grab

01:38:10.860 --> 01:38:12.540
the 1.11 update.

01:38:12.540 --> 01:38:14.920
Uh, so yeah, pretty cool.

01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:19.460
And if you don't have this game already, it's most likely going to be on sale pretty soon.

01:38:19.460 --> 01:38:25.620
I mean, it's already pretty treat, or pretty cheap, uh, 374, uh, was the recent cost of

01:38:25.620 --> 01:38:25.740
that.

01:38:25.740 --> 01:38:29.540
So it's probably going to be even cheaper during the steam sale, but it's an awesome

01:38:29.540 --> 01:38:29.900
game.

01:38:29.900 --> 01:38:34.160
So many like retro homages, it's just ridiculous.

01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:40.280
And then last but not least, uh, Project Anarchy, a brand new, uh, mobile development

01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:42.920
toolkit from Havok.

01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:45.060
And uh, did I mention it's free?

01:38:45.060 --> 01:38:49.760
So you'll be able to use it to create some pretty awesome 3D games and freely publish

01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:56.760
on Android, iOS, uh, Tizen, I'm not sure what Tizen is, but, um, and I guess it also has

01:38:58.020 --> 01:39:02.080
a provisional license to develop for, but not publish on Windows.

01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:03.640
Okay.

01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:10.240
Um, yeah, and I guess it will support, uh, I guess, uh, low level C++ access, Lua, Lua

01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:15.320
scripting, debugging, and, uh, other fun stuff includes tutorials and sample projects as

01:39:15.320 --> 01:39:16.360
well.

01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:21.680
So, uh, if you want to check that out, um, I would imagine you just go to Havok's website

01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:22.200
and it should be there.

01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:23.480
What the hell is Tizen though?

01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:25.880
I've never heard of Tizen.

01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:35.040
It's like a operating system for some smartphones, tablets, and vehicle infotainment, smart TVs.

01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:38.240
Something else to build a console out of.

01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:39.440
I guess, yeah.

01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:43.820
All right, well, uh, the potentials of this could have been Epic, but, uh, it was unearthed

01:39:43.820 --> 01:39:48.400
an old ad from the Consumer Electronics Show from years ago, uh, was unearthed that showed

01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:52.760
a advertisement for Square, you know, before they were Square Enix, uh, promoting upcoming

01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:56.120
Final Fantasy games, which included Final Fantasy II.

01:39:56.120 --> 01:39:59.320
Now I'm not, I'm not talking about the Super Nintendo, I'm talking about the Japanese Final

01:39:59.320 --> 01:39:59.920
Fantasy II.

01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:02.600
I'm going to refer to their Japanese numbers in this whole story.

01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:05.880
Uh, Final Fantasy II was supposedly going to come out here at one point, but we all

01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:06.680
knew that.

01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:10.800
One of those big, like, Lost Levels website or whatever kind of chronicles what happened

01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:12.680
with that game and it didn't come out.

01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:14.200
But a lot of people didn't know this.

01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:18.680
Final Fantasy III was apparently planned at one point, but it clearly didn't get very

01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:19.760
far along.

01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:25.280
There's even some mock-up box art that shows, um, uh, like the neptodragon possibly there,

01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:28.080
some sea monsters clutching wood on a broken ship.

01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:31.760
Now obviously we did end up getting Final Fantasy II and III years later.

01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:36.720
Uh, Final Fantasy II came in the, um, Origins thing that was on PlayStation.

01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:39.560
And Final Fantasy III I don't think could tell the DS game, right?

01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:41.160
I don't think we got it before then.

01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:47.360
So, uh, obviously there were translated ROMs and other types of hacks like that, but, uh,

01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:52.600
it's, um, interesting to imagine what could have been with Final Fantasy II and III.

01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:54.840
Let's be real, it would have been too hard.

01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:58.800
Uh, here's another game that doesn't make any sense, but it sure is a lot of fun.

01:40:58.800 --> 01:40:59.800
Kingdom Hearts.

01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:01.420
That's a hilarious face.

01:41:01.420 --> 01:41:05.880
Kingdom Hearts HD, uh, news coming out that the graphics are actually built from the ground

01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:06.880
up.

01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:10.040
Uh, some of the original assets from the 11-year-old game were lost.

01:41:10.040 --> 01:41:14.360
So the graphics for Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix were recreated from the ground up on

01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:16.440
the PlayStation 3.

01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:20.080
That's really cool because, uh, god, I can't wait to play this game all over again.

01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:21.080
It's so pretty.

01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:22.080
Yeah.

01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:23.080
I'm just like so excited about this.

01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:24.920
So very cool.

01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:28.760
I'm less excited about this, but it's not going to stop me from getting the game.

01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:34.080
Uh, Final Fantasy X and X-II HD Remaster, apparently GameStop could be getting some

01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:36.520
type of limited edition exclusive or something.

01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:41.320
Uh, there's a flyer out there that was dated June 26th that talked about a free limited

01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:44.880
edition upgrade if you pre-ordered the HD thing.

01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:50.720
Uh, however, this is saying this could have been an error on, uh, GameStop's part because

01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:55.440
they apparently removed said mention and Square Enix has not said anything about it and it's

01:41:55.440 --> 01:41:57.400
not on GameStop.com.

01:41:57.400 --> 01:41:59.560
So don't freak y'all.

01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:05.200
It must be rep- reparations for the whole, uh, Deus Ex issue.

01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:06.600
Yeah, that's right.

01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:09.080
That wasn't that long ago, all things considered, huh?

01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:11.080
Uh, anyhow, also, this is cool.

01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:14.840
Well, a lot of people don't even realize there was a Game Gear Mega Man game and it

01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:15.840
was out there.

01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:17.000
It had some different bosses too.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.000
I don't recall.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:21.480
Or was it some of the, the ones from three, it only had like four bosses in it.

01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:25.400
There was a whole series of different, uh, portable Mega Man games.

01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:30.640
Like there's the Wonder Swan one and, um, there was one other that I can't remember,

01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:32.200
but there was the Game Gear one.

01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:36.520
Well, rumor is that the Game Gear version is on its way to the Nintendo 3DS eShop.

01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:39.640
So there's something you might want to get on your new 3DS Dark Sakura.

01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:44.680
Uh, it was developed by Freestyle and published by US Gold in 1995.

01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:47.880
It was parts of four and five, they say mashed together.

01:42:47.880 --> 01:42:53.320
Uh, apparently, uh, these carts go for $40 on eBay, but I would imagine this will cost

01:42:53.320 --> 01:42:54.640
what five bucks on the eShops.

01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:56.120
That'll be kind of interesting.

01:42:56.120 --> 01:42:58.640
Well, $40 isn't that much.

01:42:58.640 --> 01:42:59.640
Right.

01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:04.120
Especially for a collector's game right now, by the way, all six original NES Mega Man

01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:08.120
games, if you didn't know on the 3DS eShop, I think most of them are on the Wii U as well

01:43:08.120 --> 01:43:09.120
at this point.

01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:13.800
So, uh, plenty of places to get your Mega Man fix, just, you know, no new games.

01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:16.840
I'm still hoping for Rockman and Bass.

01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:17.840
You never know.

01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:18.840
That would be happy.

01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:19.840
All right.

01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:20.840
Uh, Dark Sakura.

01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:29.360
Well, we do have, um, well, Xbox One, um, as far as headsets, they have to be wired

01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:31.520
and they're going to be sold separately.

01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:34.160
They're not going to be packed in.

01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:40.120
And, uh, they're basically, uh, saying that, uh, the only thing that you're getting with

01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:44.000
it is going to be the Kinect sensor and the microphone in there, but no actual heads up.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.800
So trying to screw us out of more money, huh?

01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:47.800
Yeah.

01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:51.720
It was sort of like that though, at the launch with, uh, the Xbox 360, only the premium set

01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:53.600
had a headset.

01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:59.800
Oh, not, not every, they're, they're basically saying that you can still talk to people,

01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:00.800
but you can't have a headset.

01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:05.480
Honestly, I don't like the, you know, standard headsets because I wear headphones.

01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:09.240
So you can't wear two sets of headphones at the same time.

01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:13.760
Well, I've tried, but I actually have, that's how I do it on my headset.

01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:19.120
I tape a headset that I ripped apart and I just have the boom part of the microphone

01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:23.400
on there and I tape it to the side of my headphones.

01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:24.800
It works just fine.

01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:27.480
I guess I could use Kinect, but then I'd be yelling across the room.

01:44:27.480 --> 01:44:28.480
So that would be fun.

01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:34.480
Well, in other news, and this has to do with the Wii U, the Super Smash Brothers release

01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:37.480
may actually lose some characters.

01:44:37.480 --> 01:44:40.880
They're saying that they're working on getting as many characters in it as they can, but

01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:44.540
they may not have the full intended roster, although they will have, of course, the Wii

01:44:44.540 --> 01:44:48.560
Fit Trainer fighting you with yoga.

01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:49.560
And I love her.

01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:54.840
Well, it's just like, if I knew that I could punch somebody with the warrior pose and have

01:44:54.840 --> 01:44:57.240
them go across the room, I'd be doing that more often.

01:44:57.500 --> 01:45:00.760
It's one of those things I never realized how much I loved the idea until it was announced

01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:02.360
and I'm like, she should have been a character.

01:45:02.360 --> 01:45:03.360
I love the memes.

01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:05.440
Have you seen this already cosplay?

01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:06.440
Of the Wii Fit Trainer?

01:45:06.440 --> 01:45:07.440
Of the Wii Fit Trainer.

01:45:07.440 --> 01:45:08.440
That's amazing.

01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:12.040
And then, of course, the villager and our Mega Man.

01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:19.080
I almost wonder if we'll see something like, not really like a ultimate Marvel versus Capcom,

01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:22.520
you know, but like a DLC.

01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:23.800
Ultimate Smash.

01:45:23.800 --> 01:45:26.360
Ultimate Smash with like new characters or something.

01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:29.800
Well, what they're saying here is that, I mean, the other big reason they may have to

01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:33.520
cut people is time constraints, so they won't be able to bring everyone back.

01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:39.080
But I mean, then again, there was like, what, Solid Snake before and Sonic and some Fire

01:45:39.080 --> 01:45:40.560
Emblem characters that no one cared about.

01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:41.560
I'm sorry.

01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:43.560
That Dan cared about.

01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:44.840
A lot of people care about.

01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:49.080
Some people will miss them, but yeah, I think some of those more like, like I bet Captain

01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:50.080
Falcon will be in there.

01:45:50.080 --> 01:45:51.920
It was fun to play with Roy and Marth.

01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:56.320
Or no, Star Fox will be in there, but like his little buddy, Falco Lombardi won't be

01:45:56.320 --> 01:45:57.320
there.

01:45:57.320 --> 01:46:01.600
You know, it'll be the more secondary characters in some of those games, like Lucas from Earthbound.

01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:02.600
You mean like the pallets?

01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:05.520
I know people who would probably throw a fit if Lucas wasn't in there, though.

01:46:05.520 --> 01:46:07.200
I'll throw a fit if Ness isn't there.

01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:10.800
Well, you know what, people throw fits for any reason, so, because gamers hate everything.

01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:14.800
They may just get rid of like the pallet swap characters, you know, the ones that are basically

01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:16.640
the same move set and everything, but it's just a different model.

01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:19.440
As long as Zelda still has the Sheik transformation, I'll be happy.

01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:20.440
Oh, I'm sure.

01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:21.440
That's a must.

01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:25.040
But they need to give, they need to put Daisy in there and have her have the back of her

01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:26.040
head eye laser.

01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:29.200
You know about the eyeball in the back of her head, right?

01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:30.200
I heard about that, yeah.

01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:34.880
Okay, in the original Smash Brothers, if you look at the Daisy trophy, if you happen to

01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:40.640
scroll in super close to the back of her head, there's an eyeball in the back of her head.

01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:44.880
And so now it's like this thing that like, you know what Mugen is, right?

01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:47.200
The fighting game creator.

01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:51.640
So for people who put Daisy in Mugen, they actually gave her a back of her head eyeball

01:46:51.640 --> 01:46:52.640
laser.

01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:56.880
It's the big, grandiose eyeball.

01:46:56.880 --> 01:46:57.880
And I think it's hilarious.

01:46:57.880 --> 01:47:01.680
And people have like tried to see, oh, well, it's not there in Mario Kart.

01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:03.120
It doesn't matter.

01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:05.760
She has a great big eye on the back of her head, like a tumor.

01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:06.820
That's why her hair is so big.

01:47:06.820 --> 01:47:08.920
It's full of secrets and eyeballs.

01:47:08.920 --> 01:47:09.920
It's full of secrets.

01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:14.080
You know, I'm going to use that for anybody else that, especially when my hair frizzes

01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:15.080
out into fro mode.

01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:17.840
I'm just going to say it's full of secrets.

01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:18.840
You can thank Mean Girls.

01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:19.840
Okay.

01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:22.260
Well, I haven't seen that.

01:47:22.260 --> 01:47:23.260
She should.

01:47:23.260 --> 01:47:24.260
What?

01:47:24.260 --> 01:47:25.260
Doesn't it have Sarah Michelle Gellar in it?

01:47:25.260 --> 01:47:26.260
No.

01:47:26.260 --> 01:47:28.940
It's Lindsay Lohan before she was on all the drugs.

01:47:28.940 --> 01:47:29.940
And Rachel McAdams.

01:47:29.940 --> 01:47:30.940
Is that her name?

01:47:30.940 --> 01:47:33.460
What was the one that had Sarah Michelle Gellar in it?

01:47:33.460 --> 01:47:34.460
Buffy?

01:47:34.460 --> 01:47:35.460
Buffy?

01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:36.460
No, she was in another movie.

01:47:36.460 --> 01:47:37.460
Cruel Intentions.

01:47:37.460 --> 01:47:38.460
Cruel Intentions.

01:47:38.460 --> 01:47:39.460
That was it.

01:47:39.460 --> 01:47:40.860
Because that movie had a song that I liked, but I've never seen it either.

01:47:40.860 --> 01:47:41.860
Yeah.

01:47:41.860 --> 01:47:45.060
That's the one where you can see Sarah Michelle are going, but I want to fuck.

01:47:45.060 --> 01:47:47.060
Okay.

01:47:47.060 --> 01:47:50.060
Were you volunteering?

01:47:50.860 --> 01:47:53.580
Sarah Michelle Gellar is an attractive lady.

01:47:53.580 --> 01:47:56.460
If you're Freddie Prinze Jr. then yes.

01:47:56.460 --> 01:47:58.420
So anyway, you know what though?

01:47:58.420 --> 01:48:01.820
She does not look as attractive as she did on Buffy because she's all boned thin again

01:48:01.820 --> 01:48:05.420
now and not, you know, in good shape.

01:48:05.420 --> 01:48:06.420
So anyway, okay.

01:48:06.420 --> 01:48:10.900
Former King of Fighters developers are having some issues.

01:48:10.900 --> 01:48:18.540
They were basically, they have an original 2D fighting game that they were looking to

01:48:18.540 --> 01:48:20.420
have some development on.

01:48:20.420 --> 01:48:27.500
It says that right now, and the game is called Yatagarasu, that they want to have it crowdfunded

01:48:27.500 --> 01:48:31.020
so that they can release the character in the game.

01:48:31.020 --> 01:48:34.000
And they're wanting it to be 10 playable characters at launch.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:38.460
They have a funding goal of $68,000 right now and it's on Indiegogo and it can go up

01:48:38.460 --> 01:48:41.860
if it needs to be, so.

01:48:41.860 --> 01:48:47.260
If it's not sucky like the King of Fighters 12 was, then go for it.

01:48:47.260 --> 01:48:48.260
All right.

01:48:48.980 --> 01:48:52.260
I'm a little opinionated when it comes to bad King of Fighters games, Rob.

01:48:52.260 --> 01:48:53.260
Are you?

01:48:53.260 --> 01:48:54.260
I would have never guessed.

01:48:54.260 --> 01:48:55.260
You know what, hush.

01:48:55.260 --> 01:48:58.100
I figured it was appropriate though, considering you just did a King of Fighters, or well,

01:48:58.100 --> 01:48:59.100
sorta.

01:48:59.100 --> 01:49:00.100
Sorta.

01:49:00.100 --> 01:49:01.100
Fatal Fury.

01:49:01.100 --> 01:49:02.100
King of Fighters prequel-ish.

01:49:02.100 --> 01:49:04.060
Yeah, I'm going to do Art of Fighting next week, ooh.

01:49:04.060 --> 01:49:05.060
Are you really?

01:49:05.060 --> 01:49:06.060
No.

01:49:06.060 --> 01:49:07.500
I'm going to do World Heroes Jet.

01:49:07.500 --> 01:49:17.500
Well, you know what I'm going to do is the FUGL Question of the Week right now.

01:49:17.500 --> 01:49:21.740
Make Facebook and Google Plus, slam them together and you get one clusterfuck of a

01:49:21.740 --> 01:49:22.860
social networking site.

01:49:22.860 --> 01:49:27.140
You also get the word FUGL, which we ask a question every week of our Facebook and Google

01:49:27.140 --> 01:49:30.820
fan communities, and we read some of the answers here on the show.

01:49:30.820 --> 01:49:32.060
I might read them all tonight.

01:49:32.060 --> 01:49:33.060
We'll see how I'm feeling.

01:49:33.060 --> 01:49:34.060
I haven't looked.

01:49:34.060 --> 01:49:35.060
How many are on Facebook?

01:49:35.060 --> 01:49:36.060
There's not a ton.

01:49:36.060 --> 01:49:38.900
All right, I can probably get through them all tonight.

01:49:38.900 --> 01:49:40.220
Here we go.

01:49:40.220 --> 01:49:43.420
The Ouya officially hit shelves this week.

01:49:43.420 --> 01:49:44.420
Did you get one?

01:49:44.420 --> 01:49:46.020
Why or why not?

01:49:46.020 --> 01:49:49.580
What do you think about these mobile platform consoles, especially considering there are

01:49:49.580 --> 01:49:54.700
more to come, such as Mojo and the rumors of an official Google Android console?

01:49:54.700 --> 01:49:55.700
And GameStick.

01:49:55.700 --> 01:49:56.700
Oh, yeah.

01:49:56.700 --> 01:49:58.500
Well, I said and more.

01:49:58.500 --> 01:49:59.500
All right.

01:49:59.500 --> 01:50:03.320
Retertainment says, unless the Ouya is something that will make it so it's not so damn fucking

01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:06.500
hot outside, I will not be buying one right now.

01:50:06.500 --> 01:50:09.780
Maybe I'll buy an Ouya in the future when the outside world is not trying to cook me

01:50:09.780 --> 01:50:10.780
alive.

01:50:10.780 --> 01:50:11.780
Well, to be fair...

01:50:11.780 --> 01:50:12.780
That answer wins.

01:50:12.780 --> 01:50:13.780
We're done.

01:50:13.780 --> 01:50:18.060
Well, to be fair, one thing I do like about the Ouya controller is the face plates are

01:50:18.060 --> 01:50:21.980
made of metal, and so they're nice and cool on your hands.

01:50:21.980 --> 01:50:24.260
All right, fine.

01:50:24.260 --> 01:50:25.580
We'll read other answers then.

01:50:25.580 --> 01:50:26.580
All right.

01:50:26.580 --> 01:50:32.620
So moving to Evel, like E3vL, no, unless I see more exclusive content for the system.

01:50:32.620 --> 01:50:37.940
Also, the Ouya seems to have had bad customer service as of late, having shipped their console

01:50:37.940 --> 01:50:42.300
to retailers before providing all their Kickstarter backers with one first.

01:50:42.300 --> 01:50:48.300
At least provide the backers with some store credit or free games instead of just apologizing.

01:50:48.300 --> 01:50:50.380
We'll get into that in a little bit.

01:50:50.380 --> 01:50:52.380
We're definitely going to be getting into that in a little bit.

01:50:52.380 --> 01:50:53.380
All right.

01:50:53.380 --> 01:50:56.700
Nietzsche says, between the reports of horrible controller input lag and poor performance

01:50:56.700 --> 01:50:59.700
due to outdated hardware, I have no desire to get the Ouya.

01:50:59.700 --> 01:51:03.340
It was a fun idea, but in my opinion, didn't work out.

01:51:03.340 --> 01:51:08.780
Travis H says, Asus transformer tablet plus HDMI cable equals an Ouya I can take on the

01:51:08.780 --> 01:51:09.780
go.

01:51:09.780 --> 01:51:13.380
Honestly, the only thing that I think that piqued my interest about the Ouya is having

01:51:13.380 --> 01:51:18.060
a system to throw emulators on, kind of like an all-in-one super nostalgia machine.

01:51:18.060 --> 01:51:20.540
But I already have that with my tablet, so I'm out.

01:51:20.540 --> 01:51:21.540
Wow.

01:51:21.540 --> 01:51:23.020
Lots of hate for the Ouya on Google Plus.

01:51:23.020 --> 01:51:24.660
Let's see if Facebook's any different.

01:51:24.660 --> 01:51:28.700
Galley 89 says, nope, I don't see the need one, not for me at least.

01:51:28.700 --> 01:51:32.620
Daniel S says, everything I hear about the Ouya is that it's a piece of crap, and putting

01:51:32.620 --> 01:51:37.060
more Android-based platforms is exactly what they need because market confusion and dilution

01:51:37.060 --> 01:51:38.060
is great.

01:51:38.220 --> 01:51:40.860
I think there's a slash sark in there.

01:51:40.860 --> 01:51:45.500
Clover Nikon says, my wife and I enjoy playing games on our Google Nexus 7-inch Android jellybean

01:51:45.500 --> 01:51:46.580
tablet.

01:51:46.580 --> 01:51:50.380
My wife playing Simpsons tap game, I play Star Wars pinball, my father-in-law playing

01:51:50.380 --> 01:51:52.940
those pokey magic slot machine games when he borrows it.

01:51:52.940 --> 01:51:56.860
If a shop here near me sold the Ouya, I would definitely buy one.

01:51:56.860 --> 01:51:58.060
Well, there you go.

01:51:58.060 --> 01:52:01.420
Finally, an answer we can say is a positive one.

01:52:01.420 --> 01:52:08.020
Degenerate Johnny says, it all seems oxymoronic to have a stationary platform for mobile games.

01:52:08.020 --> 01:52:12.140
Honestly, I don't very much care for mobile games, 3DS and Vita excluded.

01:52:12.140 --> 01:52:15.820
They don't offer the same amount of excitement and enjoyment that the big three consoles

01:52:15.820 --> 01:52:16.820
offer.

01:52:16.820 --> 01:52:19.980
Console developers, including Valve, should take a lesson from the auto industry, and

01:52:19.980 --> 01:52:24.740
this is my Michigan side talking, there can be only three, and that's currently Nintendo,

01:52:24.740 --> 01:52:26.260
Sony, and Microsoft.

01:52:26.260 --> 01:52:31.340
Otherwise you are doomed to walk the unfortunate path of the 3DO, Jaguar, and God rest its

01:52:31.340 --> 01:52:32.660
soul, the Dreamcast.

01:52:32.660 --> 01:52:33.660
Aww.

01:52:33.660 --> 01:52:34.660
Aww.

01:52:34.660 --> 01:52:35.660
That answer made me sad.

01:52:35.660 --> 01:52:40.740
Yeah, but the difference between the 3DO and the Jaguar and the Dreamcast is that the

01:52:40.740 --> 01:52:42.740
Dreamcast wasn't shit.

01:52:42.740 --> 01:52:43.740
Word.

01:52:43.740 --> 01:52:49.100
Also, the 80s called and would like to tell you that there is room for more than three

01:52:49.100 --> 01:52:51.220
consoles, although then again, it might lead to another crash.

01:52:51.220 --> 01:52:54.500
We had the whole home computing wars, but that's another episode of the show.

01:52:54.500 --> 01:52:56.340
Actually, we talked about that a lot last week.

01:52:56.340 --> 01:53:01.740
All right, Clerical Error 404 left a pretty long answer here, but since I like them, I'll

01:53:01.740 --> 01:53:02.740
read it.

01:53:02.740 --> 01:53:04.460
No, I did not get one.

01:53:04.460 --> 01:53:08.460
It has clever ideas, offering digital copies of games to first demo and then decide to

01:53:08.460 --> 01:53:12.820
upgrade to the full version, having an easy setup of plugging in an HDMI cable, a library

01:53:12.820 --> 01:53:17.460
of 200 games and counting, being able to run emulators to play games from older systems,

01:53:17.460 --> 01:53:21.420
almost a retro gamer's dream come true, but the old saying is true, that a system is only

01:53:21.420 --> 01:53:25.980
as good as the software, and unfortunately so far it has been able to really wow, I'm

01:53:25.980 --> 01:53:29.180
thinking it hasn't been able to really wow anyone yet.

01:53:29.180 --> 01:53:33.180
I am cautiously optimistic of how the Ouya will thrive, so for now I must wait until

01:53:33.220 --> 01:53:35.020
the purchase of it will be warranted.

01:53:35.020 --> 01:53:38.940
As far as mobile platform consoles, this is another format that has a lot of potential

01:53:38.940 --> 01:53:43.140
to be great, but the old adage is true here as well, just like with the Ouya, that a console

01:53:43.140 --> 01:53:44.880
is only as strong as the software.

01:53:44.880 --> 01:53:48.940
If they market it well and have some major developer support, it can definitely be something

01:53:48.940 --> 01:53:50.860
to look forward to.

01:53:50.860 --> 01:53:54.040
Code Man says, no, I don't have a justification for buying one.

01:53:54.040 --> 01:53:58.100
It would just make my wife more addicted to Candy Crush, and I definitely don't need that,

01:53:58.100 --> 01:53:59.100
lol.

01:53:59.100 --> 01:54:00.100
Oh, God.

01:54:00.100 --> 01:54:02.620
There's so much confusion with the platform, I think, to be honest.

01:54:03.420 --> 01:54:06.180
And there's no Candy Crush on it, thank God.

01:54:06.180 --> 01:54:08.820
First off, so what, the console runs Android.

01:54:08.820 --> 01:54:11.860
It doesn't make it a fucking mobile console.

01:54:11.860 --> 01:54:12.860
It's not.

01:54:12.860 --> 01:54:15.220
It's an operating system that runs Android.

01:54:15.220 --> 01:54:18.100
It's just like Android runs on some of those smart TVs.

01:54:18.100 --> 01:54:20.820
Does it mean your TV is a fucking mobile console?

01:54:20.820 --> 01:54:21.820
No it's not.

01:54:21.820 --> 01:54:23.020
It's a TV.

01:54:23.020 --> 01:54:26.220
So it's just an operating system that you're developing games for.

01:54:26.220 --> 01:54:30.020
Yes, a lot of the first games that are coming over are going to be ports of games that are

01:54:30.020 --> 01:54:35.220
on the Android Marketplace, because you're porting an Android game to Android with some

01:54:35.220 --> 01:54:38.740
additional APKs in there, so of course it's going to be like that.

01:54:38.740 --> 01:54:43.060
But that's the thing, it's the whole draw of this console is that it's an indie console.

01:54:43.060 --> 01:54:48.100
Now, I'm not saying that there's everything that's positive about it, because yes, there's

01:54:48.100 --> 01:54:53.460
issues with the controller being, well, especially the first backer controllers, which I'm going

01:54:53.460 --> 01:54:57.660
through an issue right now where I'm trying to get mine replaced because the analog sticks

01:54:57.660 --> 01:54:59.780
don't work correctly.

01:54:59.780 --> 01:55:01.220
And that's on Ouya.

01:55:01.220 --> 01:55:02.940
They need to fix that shit.

01:55:02.940 --> 01:55:09.500
And you know, since we're getting into some topic about, you know, Ouya.

01:55:09.500 --> 01:55:11.620
Alright, can I read the rest of the answers here?

01:55:11.620 --> 01:55:12.620
Yes, go ahead.

01:55:12.620 --> 01:55:13.620
You still want to yell at people.

01:55:13.620 --> 01:55:14.620
No, no, go ahead.

01:55:14.620 --> 01:55:15.620
I'll save that for a second.

01:55:15.620 --> 01:55:16.620
Alright.

01:55:16.620 --> 01:55:19.260
Dart Charger says, I have a MAME cabinet for my emulation needs, and everything else that

01:55:19.260 --> 01:55:23.820
I want can be handled by my consoles or smartphones and tablets, and Ouya would be the epitome

01:55:23.820 --> 01:55:26.580
of a superfluous purchase.

01:55:27.220 --> 01:55:30.980
AZHP says, I didn't get one because I didn't realize it came out this week.

01:55:30.980 --> 01:55:33.500
If there's no advertising, how can I know when it's coming out?

01:55:33.500 --> 01:55:35.900
I might pick one up soon for emulation purposes, though.

01:55:35.900 --> 01:55:38.660
And lastly, Osfer says, I'm just not interested.

01:55:38.660 --> 01:55:42.400
The new consoles from the big three are the only ones that really have my attention.

01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:44.820
That's all the answers from Facebook and Google.

01:55:44.820 --> 01:55:46.700
Thanks to y'all for answering.

01:55:46.700 --> 01:55:49.700
Join us on Facebook and Google Plus for next week's question.

01:55:49.700 --> 01:55:50.700
Alright.

01:55:50.700 --> 01:55:52.580
Slidekick, are you going to get an Ouya?

01:55:52.580 --> 01:55:59.940
You know, I was actually a very early backer, and, you know, honestly, if I kind of saw

01:55:59.940 --> 01:56:03.460
how it played out, I don't think I would have backed them.

01:56:03.460 --> 01:56:04.460
Yeah.

01:56:04.460 --> 01:56:11.340
I don't know, just between, you know, you heard about all the mess with E3 and how rude

01:56:11.340 --> 01:56:12.340
they were.

01:56:12.340 --> 01:56:13.340
Oh yeah, I was there.

01:56:13.340 --> 01:56:16.180
I took a picture of the big truck parked in front of the booth.

01:56:16.180 --> 01:56:20.300
That was, it wasn't even, and the Ouya thing at E3 was more of a developer showcase than

01:56:20.300 --> 01:56:21.300
it was the console.

01:56:21.300 --> 01:56:22.300
Yeah.

01:56:23.020 --> 01:56:27.260
But, you know, I think what I never really thought about is that, you know, they're just

01:56:27.260 --> 01:56:33.900
going to keep trying to do Ouya's like on a, you know, maybe not a yearly basis, but

01:56:33.900 --> 01:56:38.420
you know, I just think that the precedent that it's setting like, oh, the new Ouya is

01:56:38.420 --> 01:56:41.940
out now and it's better than last year's Ouya.

01:56:41.940 --> 01:56:45.900
It's like, you know, I just don't know if that's a good precedent to set for gaming

01:56:45.900 --> 01:56:52.460
consoles, even though it's not directly trying to compete with, you know, the big three.

01:56:52.460 --> 01:56:56.380
But, you know, I just, I don't, I don't know.

01:56:56.380 --> 01:57:02.420
I actually, mine did arrive and I've yet to unbox it, so I probably should at some point.

01:57:02.420 --> 01:57:03.420
Wow.

01:57:03.420 --> 01:57:09.100
But Captain Spike also backed on Kickstarter before I did and he hasn't received his yet.

01:57:09.100 --> 01:57:13.580
So God, you know, I'll hook mine up eventually.

01:57:13.580 --> 01:57:15.740
I hope that I don't have any controller issues.

01:57:15.740 --> 01:57:17.980
When did yours arrive?

01:57:17.980 --> 01:57:23.620
You know, it arrived in late April or May, so your controller's fucked.

01:57:23.620 --> 01:57:24.620
Sorry.

01:57:24.620 --> 01:57:25.620
Yeah.

01:57:25.620 --> 01:57:27.100
It was late May is when they fixed that shit.

01:57:27.100 --> 01:57:28.100
I am.

01:57:28.100 --> 01:57:29.100
Yeah.

01:57:29.100 --> 01:57:30.100
See, I didn't back this for that reason.

01:57:30.100 --> 01:57:31.100
I just knew.

01:57:31.100 --> 01:57:32.100
But it's all fixed now.

01:57:32.100 --> 01:57:33.100
It's fixed now.

01:57:33.100 --> 01:57:34.100
Yeah, but not for you.

01:57:34.100 --> 01:57:37.300
Well, it's fixed if I don't use the new Ouya controller.

01:57:37.300 --> 01:57:42.340
Thank God I can pair a PlayStation 3 controller to it, but the only thing is not all games.

01:57:42.340 --> 01:57:43.580
You have to account for that.

01:57:43.580 --> 01:57:46.140
So they have to program in those button mappings as well.

01:57:46.140 --> 01:57:49.380
I can, you know, for a lot of things like emulators, I can play with the PlayStation

01:57:49.380 --> 01:57:50.860
3 controller and it works great.

01:57:50.860 --> 01:57:52.100
That's how I knew it was.

01:57:52.100 --> 01:57:54.300
It was the controller, not the console.

01:57:54.300 --> 01:57:58.860
You know, I'm going to get into it in just a second.

01:57:58.860 --> 01:57:59.900
Some of the customer service things.

01:57:59.900 --> 01:58:00.900
It's ridiculous.

01:58:00.900 --> 01:58:02.940
Well, if why don't we go back into the gaming news?

01:58:02.940 --> 01:58:05.580
Loki, why don't you start us off with a possibly related topic?

01:58:05.580 --> 01:58:06.580
Let's talk about this.

01:58:06.580 --> 01:58:07.580
This is great.

01:58:07.580 --> 01:58:08.580
This is fantastic.

01:58:08.580 --> 01:58:11.180
Right when they launched, there was two Kickstarter updates.

01:58:11.180 --> 01:58:14.140
One was like, hey, we launched our console.

01:58:14.140 --> 01:58:16.260
You know, we couldn't have done it without you.

01:58:16.260 --> 01:58:19.740
To which there was a bunch of replies, hey, you fucktard, I haven't gotten my fucking

01:58:19.740 --> 01:58:21.860
console yet that I backed last year.

01:58:21.860 --> 01:58:23.060
Where the fuck is it?

01:58:23.060 --> 01:58:26.780
And then Julie comes out and says, I'm pissed.

01:58:26.780 --> 01:58:31.820
I'm so pissed that we haven't been able to get some of those consoles to you.

01:58:31.820 --> 01:58:36.180
You know, I promised that we'd ship them all and I don't know what's going on.

01:58:36.180 --> 01:58:39.500
We have people in, you know, Hong Kong, they're checking into it and stuff.

01:58:39.500 --> 01:58:40.780
I'll tell you what's going on.

01:58:40.780 --> 01:58:46.380
They shipped it via fucking DHL, DHL Global, first off.

01:58:46.380 --> 01:58:49.780
So slow ass ship in the first place.

01:58:49.780 --> 01:58:55.460
And then you had to pass off to, because it was their global logistics mail or something

01:58:55.460 --> 01:59:00.260
like that, where they pass it off to the US Postal Service.

01:59:00.260 --> 01:59:02.440
It takes so fucking long.

01:59:02.440 --> 01:59:04.380
They didn't know what the hell was going on.

01:59:04.380 --> 01:59:06.980
It basically said, oh, yeah, you're going to get an update and your tracking number

01:59:06.980 --> 01:59:09.660
will become active within, you know, like a couple days.

01:59:09.660 --> 01:59:11.100
It took like a week.

01:59:11.100 --> 01:59:12.780
My tracking number was never active.

01:59:12.780 --> 01:59:14.340
It just showed up one day.

01:59:14.340 --> 01:59:16.640
You're lucky if that thing showed up in the first place.

01:59:16.640 --> 01:59:20.580
And then on top of all that, you had the issues where, you know, you're getting bummed controllers

01:59:20.580 --> 01:59:23.980
with the earlier backer editions, which I did.

01:59:23.980 --> 01:59:26.700
And it's annoying because it doesn't work correctly.

01:59:26.700 --> 01:59:30.300
And so I replied, I sent a ticket for it.

01:59:30.300 --> 01:59:34.860
I'm like, hey, I need this shit fixed, you know, so I sent them a ticket.

01:59:34.860 --> 01:59:38.700
And you know, I understand that they're a little busy with their console launch and

01:59:38.740 --> 01:59:39.740
stuff like that.

01:59:39.740 --> 01:59:40.740
I sent it on Tuesday.

01:59:40.740 --> 01:59:43.100
They got back to me today.

01:59:43.100 --> 01:59:44.740
And here's what their response was.

01:59:44.740 --> 01:59:49.660
It's like, as we continue to evolve the, oh yeah, making constant improvements to our

01:59:49.660 --> 01:59:51.460
product and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:59:51.460 --> 01:59:54.580
You got a copy paste from an outsource customer service company.

01:59:54.580 --> 01:59:55.580
I bet anything.

01:59:55.580 --> 01:59:56.580
It's not even outsource.

01:59:56.580 --> 01:59:58.080
It took so long.

01:59:58.080 --> 02:00:01.940
And basically saying, you know, the goal is, you know, you should look into the fact and

02:00:01.940 --> 02:00:04.100
see if you could solve your problem there.

02:00:04.100 --> 02:00:06.120
I'm like, I have a fucking defective controller.

02:00:06.120 --> 02:00:08.300
Your fact doesn't help me there.

02:00:08.300 --> 02:00:10.100
It doesn't say anything.

02:00:10.100 --> 02:00:14.500
So I sent a reply, I'm like, listen, I have a defective controller, I need to replace

02:00:14.500 --> 02:00:17.660
this shit because you know what's going to happen if I can't get it replaced?

02:00:17.660 --> 02:00:19.420
I'm going to go to the store.

02:00:19.420 --> 02:00:21.220
I'm going to buy a controller.

02:00:21.220 --> 02:00:24.860
I'm going to replace it with my controller and I'm going to return it is what I'm going

02:00:24.860 --> 02:00:25.860
to do.

02:00:25.860 --> 02:00:28.020
Oh, shame on you.

02:00:28.020 --> 02:00:30.840
But that's kind of, it's clever.

02:00:30.840 --> 02:00:33.100
I should not be supporting that.

02:00:33.100 --> 02:00:36.800
Something similar to that, but not really.

02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:41.680
When Sonic Spinball came out, I got it for, you know, full price and then Target had it

02:00:41.680 --> 02:00:44.900
for like five or seven dollars less.

02:00:44.900 --> 02:00:50.160
So I bought it at Target and returned it to Toys R Us.

02:00:50.160 --> 02:00:54.280
So I mean, it's not really like repackaging it, but I felt I was like 10 and I felt like

02:00:54.280 --> 02:00:59.760
I was like, ooh, what if they find out that this is actually from Toys R Us?

02:00:59.760 --> 02:01:00.760
Defective allowance.

02:01:00.760 --> 02:01:01.760
It's, it's all right.

02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:06.520
They're usage defectives, but it's seriously, if they're not going to solve my problem because

02:01:06.520 --> 02:01:08.640
they're claiming that they're too busy right now.

02:01:08.640 --> 02:01:13.400
Well, I'm sorry, but you know, it's going to be hard for me to continue supporting your

02:01:13.400 --> 02:01:16.800
console if you're not going to give me a controller that fucking worked.

02:01:16.800 --> 02:01:20.200
Since I only have one controller anyways and your additional controllers is 60 fucking

02:01:20.200 --> 02:01:21.200
dollars.

02:01:21.200 --> 02:01:22.200
Nope.

02:01:22.200 --> 02:01:23.200
Not going to buy those.

02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:24.200
Sorry.

02:01:24.200 --> 02:01:28.840
So you say most of the cost of the system is the one controller that doesn't work?

02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:29.840
That's their claim.

02:01:29.840 --> 02:01:30.840
But here's the thing.

02:01:30.840 --> 02:01:35.240
It's like, I don't understand why, why the whole thing was a clusterfuck to begin with

02:01:35.240 --> 02:01:36.480
and I know it's going to get better.

02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:38.440
I actually haven't touched my console since May.

02:01:38.440 --> 02:01:40.600
I did loan to a friend, a coworker.

02:01:40.600 --> 02:01:43.760
He wanted to check it out for stuff and so he did my updates and everything.

02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:47.600
I guess the interface is a lot nicer now, but you know, a lot of the things that they

02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:51.340
promise, obviously they didn't come through with like one of the major ones.

02:01:51.340 --> 02:01:55.040
This console can be, this console can be easily rooted.

02:01:55.040 --> 02:01:58.180
You're going to be able to root it immediately once you get it.

02:01:58.180 --> 02:01:59.240
Can't do that.

02:01:59.240 --> 02:02:00.240
Can't do that at all.

02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:02.040
Uh, you know, it's very hacker friendly.

02:02:02.040 --> 02:02:03.480
It's no, it's not.

02:02:03.480 --> 02:02:04.480
It's not hacker friendly.

02:02:04.520 --> 02:02:06.520
Aside from the fact that you can sideload.

02:02:06.520 --> 02:02:11.120
Why not channel this energy into a complaint with a better business bureau?

02:02:11.120 --> 02:02:13.200
Because they're not going to do anything.

02:02:13.200 --> 02:02:18.760
No, it's not that whether they do something or not, it's still going to, um, hurt their

02:02:18.760 --> 02:02:20.400
reputation and prevent them from being able to do business.

02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:23.160
I'm sure there's tons of people who have already done that just for their backers.

02:02:23.160 --> 02:02:25.400
Or is that just an excuse not to do it?

02:02:25.400 --> 02:02:27.200
It is an excuse not to do it because I just don't care.

02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:28.680
I don't care enough.

02:02:28.680 --> 02:02:31.320
It's a con- I mean, it's not like I, I dropped a ton of money.

02:02:31.320 --> 02:02:34.120
It was a hundred dollars a year ago and I just don't care.

02:02:34.120 --> 02:02:37.800
And that's why companies get away with this because people don't care.

02:02:37.800 --> 02:02:38.800
He wants the internet rage.

02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:39.800
He wants the internet rage.

02:02:39.800 --> 02:02:41.720
I want my controller to work and that's it.

02:02:41.720 --> 02:02:42.720
Then that's fine.

02:02:42.720 --> 02:02:46.240
So write them about it and tell them you're going to file a complaint and see how long

02:02:46.240 --> 02:02:47.240
it takes them to reply.

02:02:47.240 --> 02:02:48.480
Cause trust me, they will reply.

02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:49.480
They won't reply.

02:02:49.480 --> 02:02:50.480
They just, seriously.

02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:55.080
The moment you bring up the three, you know, the business, the better business bureau,

02:02:55.080 --> 02:02:59.600
especially for any company that wants to continue to do business, they tend to jump on that.

02:02:59.600 --> 02:03:01.480
Especially if they've got other people doing the same.

02:03:01.480 --> 02:03:02.480
Well, fine.

02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:05.880
The next time I send them an update, I'll say, I'll contact the better business bureau

02:03:05.880 --> 02:03:08.600
and we'll see them do nothing because yeah.

02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:11.760
Let me read some of the written word in our chat room at live.vognetware.com.

02:03:11.760 --> 02:03:16.200
Burr says, even the positive reviews are like, I like mine, but I haven't bought a game for

02:03:16.200 --> 02:03:17.200
it yet.

02:03:17.200 --> 02:03:18.200
Just played the demos.

02:03:18.200 --> 02:03:22.080
There is seriously, a lot of the games on there are free to play right now and everything

02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:23.340
has a free version of it.

02:03:23.340 --> 02:03:26.400
So yeah, a lot of it you don't need to necessarily buy.

02:03:26.400 --> 02:03:31.480
Codeman says, this is just a huge shit on the people who backed.

02:03:31.480 --> 02:03:37.680
It is really unexcusable that they, you know, they got limited supply of the stores because

02:03:37.680 --> 02:03:40.340
they wanted to make sure they have that retail presence or whatever.

02:03:40.340 --> 02:03:45.040
But at the same time, they've made a promise to everyone that backed them to, you know,

02:03:45.040 --> 02:03:46.040
deliver on that.

02:03:46.040 --> 02:03:50.520
And if they can't deliver to, you know, people that ordered their console, I'm sorry, back

02:03:50.520 --> 02:03:55.360
their Kickstarter and got a free console, however the fuck you want to word that because

02:03:55.400 --> 02:03:59.520
you're not technically ordering anything, but you know, whatever.

02:03:59.520 --> 02:04:02.720
They made a promise and they couldn't even fulfill that.

02:04:02.720 --> 02:04:05.960
And they kept, they didn't give any firm numbers to what was shipping.

02:04:05.960 --> 02:04:09.680
They just did this really generic line graph thing.

02:04:09.680 --> 02:04:14.160
And you know, at a point at the beginning of June or something, they're like, all consoles

02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:15.160
have shipped.

02:04:15.160 --> 02:04:16.160
Really?

02:04:16.160 --> 02:04:19.480
They've all shipped because no one's gotten them yet.

02:04:19.480 --> 02:04:22.160
So yeah, it was really weird.

02:04:22.160 --> 02:04:27.380
So I would be willing to, I'm kind of curious to see what it's going to look like in three

02:04:27.380 --> 02:04:28.380
months time.

02:04:28.380 --> 02:04:31.760
You know, if they're going to have all of these, you know, if they're going to follow

02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:35.360
through with everything that they promised about this console, cause right now, you know,

02:04:35.360 --> 02:04:38.520
they said they have like how many developers, like 5,000 developers or something like that

02:04:38.520 --> 02:04:41.280
for the Ouya and there's 200 games.

02:04:41.280 --> 02:04:42.960
Are they counting like every console they sold?

02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:46.400
Because technically every console they sell can be a software development kit that you

02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:48.020
can develop a game for.

02:04:48.020 --> 02:04:51.880
So are we counting those as like con, you know, developers?

02:04:52.600 --> 02:04:53.600
All right.

02:04:53.600 --> 02:04:54.800
Well, I got to move on.

02:04:54.800 --> 02:04:59.400
I'm sure Loki could do an entire episode just about his hatred towards this whole thing.

02:04:59.400 --> 02:05:00.400
Lesson learned.

02:05:00.400 --> 02:05:03.080
Would you, would you back another console after what happened to this?

02:05:03.080 --> 02:05:09.740
Yeah, I would, but it'd be, it would have to be, you know, a lot more, um, research

02:05:09.740 --> 02:05:10.740
done into it.

02:05:10.740 --> 02:05:15.640
Like, you know, not that like Google's going to, you know, put a Kickstarter out there

02:05:15.640 --> 02:05:20.360
for a console, but you know, it would have to be like, if, you know, it would be, it

02:05:20.360 --> 02:05:21.640
would be, it'd be different.

02:05:21.640 --> 02:05:26.040
Like there's a different, like a console that's supposed to be, I keep seeing that

02:05:26.040 --> 02:05:30.660
they're trying to pitch this guy is kind of doing this, Oh, it can do everything and stuff

02:05:30.660 --> 02:05:31.720
that you can imagine.

02:05:31.720 --> 02:05:32.720
It's amazing.

02:05:32.720 --> 02:05:36.380
The Oton or whatever, it's like this autonomous console is basically supposed to procedurally

02:05:36.380 --> 02:05:38.720
generate games.

02:05:38.720 --> 02:05:44.760
And that sounds neat, I guess, but it's just like the stuff that he's promising is ridiculous.

02:05:44.760 --> 02:05:49.640
And so like, it's just like, yeah, I'm not going to back in this, but he's playing it

02:05:49.640 --> 02:05:50.640
in a Kickstarter.

02:05:50.640 --> 02:05:54.720
So you'll probably see that at some point, uh, cause he tried to get in, unfortunately

02:05:54.720 --> 02:05:58.980
it was, we had got in and then they started requiring that anything that's electronics

02:05:58.980 --> 02:06:02.960
or something like that has to have an actual prototype, a physical prototype made, not

02:06:02.960 --> 02:06:04.560
just a concept.

02:06:04.560 --> 02:06:06.480
So that's the problem.

02:06:06.480 --> 02:06:11.960
I think it would be reluctant to spend as much on Kickstarter anymore.

02:06:11.960 --> 02:06:16.600
Usually I just put in about 15 to $20 for a game or something, but that was the first

02:06:16.600 --> 02:06:22.880
big, uh, big Kickstarter amount that I put in and I don't think I'd be as likely to do

02:06:22.880 --> 02:06:23.880
it anymore.

02:06:23.880 --> 02:06:26.320
All right, well let's move on.

02:06:26.320 --> 02:06:30.680
Um, speaking of people who aren't likely to do certain things anymore, uh, Bethesda, the

02:06:30.680 --> 02:06:35.320
vice president of PR marketing, Pete Hines, uh, in an interesting statement with, I believe

02:06:35.320 --> 02:06:38.960
it was Eurogamer talking about quote, we don't have Facebook stuff.

02:06:38.960 --> 02:06:40.580
We don't have mobile stuff.

02:06:40.580 --> 02:06:43.440
We feel like we really know who we are, what we're good at.

02:06:43.440 --> 02:06:46.280
So, you know, you know, you don't see Skyrim mobile or anything like that.

02:06:46.280 --> 02:06:49.600
A while ago it was social games that were all the rage and people were asking, why

02:06:49.600 --> 02:06:50.600
aren't we doing Facebook?

02:06:50.600 --> 02:06:53.560
That's not what we do and that's no longer a big deal.

02:06:53.560 --> 02:06:56.180
So we didn't run after it and now we're not running away from it.

02:06:56.180 --> 02:06:59.120
We're just going to kind of stick to what we feel is best.

02:06:59.120 --> 02:07:04.280
By the way, it doesn't just extend to Facebook and mobile quote, we have nothing announced

02:07:04.280 --> 02:07:06.560
in development for Wii U.

02:07:06.560 --> 02:07:08.920
It's not something we've done anything for previously.

02:07:08.920 --> 02:07:11.760
I don't even remember the last time we've done a Nintendo title.

02:07:11.760 --> 02:07:12.760
I do.

02:07:12.760 --> 02:07:13.760
What was it?

02:07:13.760 --> 02:07:16.000
It was Brunswick bowling.

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:17.000
I'm serious.

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:18.280
That's what it was.

02:07:18.280 --> 02:07:19.280
We don't have anything.

02:07:19.280 --> 02:07:22.940
That was just everybody trying to run off of the popularity of Wii Sports of which bowling

02:07:22.940 --> 02:07:24.560
was huge.

02:07:24.560 --> 02:07:28.400
We don't have anything now whether or not we would in the future is to be determined.

02:07:28.400 --> 02:07:31.880
As for why, I guess I'd rather not go into that.

02:07:31.880 --> 02:07:33.840
Oh, well, shit.

02:07:33.840 --> 02:07:37.880
Now we all have to sit here and make it up because he won't go into it.

02:07:37.880 --> 02:07:43.280
So what it is just that the Wii U is a, they don't believe in it.

02:07:43.280 --> 02:07:46.640
They don't think something like Skyrim is capable of running on Wii U?

02:07:46.640 --> 02:07:51.280
I think it's just, once again, it's cost risk type thing.

02:07:51.280 --> 02:07:57.240
The cost it's going to take to develop a game or port a game over to that platform versus

02:07:57.240 --> 02:08:01.920
the amount of money you're going to make with the limited marketplace for it right now because

02:08:01.920 --> 02:08:04.000
there's just not a lot of people that bought the console.

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:05.000
I think it's going to change.

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:08.080
You're going to hear a lot of people more willing to develop for it when there's more

02:08:08.080 --> 02:08:10.020
people that bought the console.

02:08:10.020 --> 02:08:13.860
So it's going to take another year or so with some of these first party games to drive

02:08:13.860 --> 02:08:16.940
some console sales to get more third parties involved.

02:08:16.940 --> 02:08:23.500
But if it doesn't work, if the third parties, or I should say the first party games don't

02:08:23.500 --> 02:08:28.620
drive enough console sales, then yeah, you're going to hear a lot more of this.

02:08:28.620 --> 02:08:32.980
I don't think it's a huge loss because there hasn't really been a Bethesda game since

02:08:32.980 --> 02:08:33.980
Brunswick Bowling.

02:08:33.980 --> 02:08:39.460
So it's not like, I don't know, it is kind of disappointing because you think that something

02:08:39.460 --> 02:08:44.520
that's kind of graphically on par with a Playstation 3 and an Xbox 360 and yet you're

02:08:44.520 --> 02:08:48.580
not getting these games that are on those platforms.

02:08:48.580 --> 02:08:50.380
It's not helping them any.

02:08:50.380 --> 02:08:53.540
Alright, let's shift gears here completely.

02:08:53.540 --> 02:08:56.260
Dark Soccer, you have a very interesting story for us next.

02:08:56.260 --> 02:09:02.920
Yes, I do, and I found it on Game Politics, which I love Game Politics.

02:09:02.920 --> 02:09:06.300
You want to see what goes on in the world around video games.

02:09:06.300 --> 02:09:10.140
It doesn't necessarily have to do with release dates, then that's the place to go.

02:09:10.140 --> 02:09:18.300
But there was a conservative political website called the Daily Caller that said that a Texas

02:09:18.300 --> 02:09:24.120
teenager was making a joke while playing League of Legends, and the joke was, and I'm going

02:09:24.120 --> 02:09:28.780
to quote, oh yeah, I'm real messed up in the head, I'm going to shoot up a school full

02:09:28.780 --> 02:09:34.140
of kids and eat their still beating hearts, followed by a JK and lol.

02:09:34.140 --> 02:09:41.180
Well, there were people who took this seriously, actually a Canadian lady, who looked up the

02:09:41.180 --> 02:09:48.040
teenager's address and noted where he lived and reported it to the police, and he's been

02:09:48.040 --> 02:09:49.680
in jail ever since.

02:09:49.680 --> 02:09:55.520
He actually spent his 19th birthday in jail, and if he's convicted, he's going to spend

02:09:55.520 --> 02:10:03.320
up to eight years in prison, and this is basically for making a terrorist threat.

02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:08.080
It just goes to show what this is, basically it's an ignorant kid.

02:10:08.080 --> 02:10:13.160
His dad said he doesn't watch the news, he doesn't read up on any current events, he's

02:10:13.160 --> 02:10:15.240
just a dumb kid making a threat.

02:10:15.240 --> 02:10:20.380
I'm sorry, but if you're on the internet, how do you not hear about stuff, just hearing

02:10:20.380 --> 02:10:22.520
about stuff that other people are talking about?

02:10:22.520 --> 02:10:30.040
Even apart from that, there's people who will all the time say really horrible things, trying

02:10:30.040 --> 02:10:37.680
to threaten somebody or exert their own personal dominance over somebody else.

02:10:37.680 --> 02:10:43.140
There's actually a petition out, I hate change.org, just because when you sign any petition there,

02:10:43.140 --> 02:10:50.480
you get a bajillion emails, and I hate it, but there is a petition up on change.org right

02:10:50.480 --> 02:10:56.920
now to try to get him out of jail, which I don't know if it's going to work, but the

02:10:56.920 --> 02:11:02.520
whole thing that this boils down to, and it's almost an epidemic when it comes to online

02:11:02.520 --> 02:11:09.720
play, is that, and it's not just the whole terrorist threat type statements, because

02:11:09.720 --> 02:11:13.540
they're saying that there's kids everywhere being gotten in trouble for this, but for

02:11:13.540 --> 02:11:18.840
the ones who go, oh I'm going to rape you, and I'm sure they're not meaning they're going

02:11:18.840 --> 02:11:25.740
to go out and take somebody against their will, it's a means of exerting dominance.

02:11:25.740 --> 02:11:30.660
It's, you know, top of the one says, just relax and let it happen.

02:11:30.660 --> 02:11:31.660
Oh god.

02:11:31.660 --> 02:11:33.660
Rob, I am disgusted.

02:11:33.660 --> 02:11:37.700
You know, like the whole, I'm just, the G-rated version of that.

02:11:37.700 --> 02:11:41.620
Well, but on top of that, there's also ones going, well I'm just going to beat the shit

02:11:41.620 --> 02:11:46.900
out of you, or, just with all the cyberbullying that's been in the recent, or the tits are

02:11:46.900 --> 02:11:47.900
GTFOs.

02:11:47.900 --> 02:11:52.180
A lot of people say stupid shit on the internet, what a shock.

02:11:52.180 --> 02:11:59.140
But what we're looking into now is that people actually taking some of them seriously, where,

02:11:59.140 --> 02:12:05.300
and I firmly believe that this kid was just being a stupid kid, you know, just saying

02:12:05.300 --> 02:12:09.140
something that he thought was going to make himself sound a little, you know, more puffed

02:12:09.140 --> 02:12:11.900
up and a little bit more of a badass.

02:12:11.900 --> 02:12:14.300
You have eight years in prison.

02:12:14.300 --> 02:12:19.300
Yeah, I mean, I would even think by now, even if they dropped the whole thing, he's fucking

02:12:19.300 --> 02:12:20.300
learned his lesson.

02:12:20.500 --> 02:12:23.380
Send the cops to his house to scare the shit out of him.

02:12:23.380 --> 02:12:27.460
You know, like that's, that's how you learn your lesson.

02:12:27.460 --> 02:12:32.660
You know, I would, if I had a way to do that with everyone who said anything that out of

02:12:32.660 --> 02:12:39.860
context could remotely be taken as threatening, or any type of bragging of said threatening

02:12:39.860 --> 02:12:45.820
action, I would do it in a heartbeat just to scare people, you know, to scare people

02:12:45.820 --> 02:12:50.060
into behaving, even though it shouldn't take scaring people into behaving.

02:12:50.060 --> 02:12:53.540
They should just fucking know how to behave like a human being.

02:12:53.540 --> 02:12:54.780
That's asking a lot from people.

02:12:54.780 --> 02:12:58.020
That's asking a lot, I know.

02:12:58.020 --> 02:13:01.380
And I mean, and it goes without saying that when, you know, you put these people behind

02:13:01.380 --> 02:13:07.340
a mask of anonymity, that they think that they've got fair, you know, fair game to say

02:13:07.340 --> 02:13:10.620
anything that they want, that there's no repercussion.

02:13:10.620 --> 02:13:16.100
In this case, the lady knew who he was and called on him.

02:13:16.100 --> 02:13:20.220
You know, I actually, my point with this is that I would actually even express this as

02:13:20.220 --> 02:13:26.620
a cautionary tale, you know, put it out there for any of these people who are going to be

02:13:26.620 --> 02:13:27.620
douches online.

02:13:27.620 --> 02:13:29.060
Not that our listeners would ever do that.

02:13:29.060 --> 02:13:37.900
No, because our listeners are kind, intelligent, beautiful, handsome, non-bigoted, lovely people.

02:13:37.900 --> 02:13:40.620
And if you are bigoted, don't tell me or I'll beat you up.

02:13:40.620 --> 02:13:41.620
I'm kidding.

02:13:41.620 --> 02:13:43.580
No, I wouldn't beat anybody up.

02:13:43.580 --> 02:13:46.300
I would hear sirens heading towards your house, Jamie.

02:13:46.300 --> 02:13:47.300
Wow.

02:13:47.300 --> 02:13:48.460
Popo's coming for Jamie.

02:13:48.460 --> 02:13:49.460
Whatever.

02:13:49.460 --> 02:13:50.460
You know what?

02:13:50.460 --> 02:13:52.740
I would just judge them really harshly.

02:13:52.740 --> 02:14:04.140
But you know, you should never bring up something that you know is going to be triggering.

02:14:04.140 --> 02:14:07.020
I hate to use the word, but something that's going to be triggering to somebody.

02:14:07.020 --> 02:14:11.660
You know, there are people who lost family and friends in any number of terrorist attack.

02:14:11.660 --> 02:14:15.300
I know people personally who have lost family members.

02:14:15.300 --> 02:14:18.540
You know, it's a really awful thing.

02:14:18.540 --> 02:14:26.020
And when you bring up something like that, when there is such a volatile environment

02:14:26.020 --> 02:14:32.340
around that, just that concept, then you are really asking for a pile of shit.

02:14:32.340 --> 02:14:37.420
I mean, I think like games included, but you know, just as everything moves more with more

02:14:37.420 --> 02:14:38.420
online communication.

02:14:38.420 --> 02:14:43.660
I mean, I think people just need to really be more mindful and like we need to educate

02:14:43.660 --> 02:14:46.940
people of, you know, but I mean, again, that's asking a lot.

02:14:46.940 --> 02:14:51.940
I'm going to quote my granddaddy and my granddaddy was a great guy from Bridgeport, Connecticut.

02:14:51.940 --> 02:14:52.940
He was our Yankee.

02:14:52.940 --> 02:14:58.240
When I grew up in the south, he always said, put brain in gear before mouth in motion.

02:14:58.240 --> 02:15:02.580
His other catchphrase was don't be an instigator and an agitator.

02:15:02.580 --> 02:15:07.320
But I mean, those are two really good pieces of advice.

02:15:07.320 --> 02:15:11.580
You don't want to stir up the hornet's nest.

02:15:11.580 --> 02:15:15.320
You have to gently remove it to where you don't get stung in the process or no one else

02:15:15.320 --> 02:15:16.320
get hurt.

02:15:16.320 --> 02:15:17.540
You know, it's the same thing.

02:15:17.540 --> 02:15:21.160
And I think that with this kid, yeah, he doesn't deserve to be locked up, but he did deserve

02:15:21.160 --> 02:15:25.360
to have a stern talking to at least to have some sort of repercussion.

02:15:25.360 --> 02:15:26.360
Scared straight.

02:15:26.360 --> 02:15:27.360
Exactly.

02:15:27.360 --> 02:15:28.360
Or maybe scared gay.

02:15:28.360 --> 02:15:29.360
I don't know.

02:15:29.360 --> 02:15:30.360
Whatever.

02:15:30.360 --> 02:15:31.360
Whatever.

02:15:31.360 --> 02:15:33.240
You're the one who told me to go gaily forward.

02:15:33.240 --> 02:15:34.240
OK.

02:15:34.240 --> 02:15:40.920
Anyway, I think that in any of any of these cases, you know, yeah, they need to drop it

02:15:40.920 --> 02:15:41.920
with the kid.

02:15:41.920 --> 02:15:43.880
He's clearly learned his lesson.

02:15:43.880 --> 02:15:47.440
But to everybody, just think before you speak.

02:15:47.440 --> 02:15:51.440
And instead of reacting to something that someone has said or something that you've

02:15:51.440 --> 02:15:57.960
seen or losing a game, boo hoo, go cry me a fucking river.

02:15:57.960 --> 02:15:59.760
Don't react.

02:15:59.760 --> 02:16:01.560
Think and act.

02:16:01.560 --> 02:16:02.560
So the story.

02:16:02.560 --> 02:16:06.840
I apologize after our press our luck game, slide kick for threatening to kill you and

02:16:06.840 --> 02:16:10.160
leave your corpse out on the porch for the cause of love.

02:16:10.160 --> 02:16:12.680
Can you say you're going to pee on my corpse, too?

02:16:12.680 --> 02:16:13.920
Yeah, I probably did.

02:16:13.920 --> 02:16:17.040
And I was going to hit you with a bug net repeatedly since you like Animal Crossing

02:16:17.040 --> 02:16:18.040
so much.

02:16:18.040 --> 02:16:22.160
So I hear the sirens again, they're coming back this way.

02:16:22.160 --> 02:16:23.160
No.

02:16:23.160 --> 02:16:24.160
All right.

02:16:24.160 --> 02:16:25.160
I'm sorry.

02:16:25.160 --> 02:16:26.160
I shouldn't joke about it.

02:16:26.160 --> 02:16:27.160
I shouldn't laugh.

02:16:27.160 --> 02:16:32.280
I just I would actually just still like to encourage our listeners to keep a level head.

02:16:32.280 --> 02:16:33.360
Don't react.

02:16:33.360 --> 02:16:35.320
Think and act.

02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:36.420
That's my new catchphrase.

02:16:36.420 --> 02:16:42.200
You should have a little McGruff, the crime dog saying you should make some YouTube gaming

02:16:42.200 --> 02:16:43.200
PSAs.

02:16:43.200 --> 02:16:47.320
Get gamey like like Jamie's gaming stern advice.

02:16:47.320 --> 02:16:52.200
I almost said gamey like Wanda Sykes, knock it off.

02:16:52.200 --> 02:16:55.220
And then, you know, what's going to happen is I'm going to get a ton of people commenting

02:16:55.220 --> 02:17:00.760
on YouTube, you know, show me your boobs, get back in the kitchen, rape, blah, blah,

02:17:00.760 --> 02:17:01.760
blah.

02:17:02.240 --> 02:17:05.240
And then you have to just single out each and every one of them, trace their IPs and

02:17:05.240 --> 02:17:06.400
send them a letter.

02:17:06.400 --> 02:17:11.800
Back trace them through the Internet or just disable comments.

02:17:11.800 --> 02:17:12.800
That's what I do.

02:17:12.800 --> 02:17:17.400
But I've actually done that before where I got one of those stupid, you know, so and

02:17:17.400 --> 02:17:18.400
so rape.

02:17:18.400 --> 02:17:20.520
But it came through a source that I was able to track back as IP.

02:17:20.520 --> 02:17:21.520
It was on a forum.

02:17:21.520 --> 02:17:23.840
I think it was a DDR freak back in the day.

02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:27.620
But I traced his IP back and found out where he lived and messaged him.

02:17:27.620 --> 02:17:28.680
You live here and here.

02:17:28.680 --> 02:17:29.960
I have your phone number.

02:17:29.960 --> 02:17:30.960
What are you going to do about it?

02:17:31.160 --> 02:17:32.160
Oh, please don't call me.

02:17:32.160 --> 02:17:33.160
Please don't call me.

02:17:33.160 --> 02:17:35.160
I'm going to call your mother.

02:17:35.160 --> 02:17:36.160
No.

02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:39.440
Well, I love all those people who say, oh, well, I just found your Facebook.

02:17:39.440 --> 02:17:41.200
I'm posting it back where your mom can see it.

02:17:41.200 --> 02:17:42.200
Yeah.

02:17:42.200 --> 02:17:44.960
But then some trolls make it really successfully and it makes me very bitter.

02:17:44.960 --> 02:17:49.240
I'm having a drink as I say that.

02:17:49.240 --> 02:17:54.080
In some cases, it's when you remove that mask of anonymity that they really straighten up.

02:17:54.080 --> 02:17:55.080
You know what I mean?

02:17:55.080 --> 02:17:59.080
Degenerate Johnny in chat says, go to shit senders dot com and send them a cow pie.

02:17:59.080 --> 02:18:00.080
That's a real thing.

02:18:00.200 --> 02:18:01.200
Yes, it is.

02:18:01.200 --> 02:18:02.200
But that's great.

02:18:02.200 --> 02:18:03.200
That happens.

02:18:03.200 --> 02:18:04.200
Spike, if you're listening.

02:18:04.200 --> 02:18:05.200
Happy birthday.

02:18:05.200 --> 02:18:07.560
Actually, you know what I want to do?

02:18:07.560 --> 02:18:10.600
And I don't know if something like this exists because you know how there's like the National

02:18:10.600 --> 02:18:12.280
Sex Offender Registry.

02:18:12.280 --> 02:18:14.480
I want to do the Internet Offender Registry.

02:18:14.480 --> 02:18:16.480
National Gaming Douchebag.

02:18:16.480 --> 02:18:17.480
Yeah.

02:18:17.480 --> 02:18:21.940
Well, you can do slander, slander, lawsuit, slander.

02:18:21.940 --> 02:18:28.780
If you can do as so-and-so parks like an asshole dot com, then you can do shit people said

02:18:28.780 --> 02:18:31.300
on the Internet dot com.

02:18:31.300 --> 02:18:33.220
You know, I'm just saying.

02:18:33.220 --> 02:18:36.740
Captain Spike is in chat, by the way, and says rude.

02:18:36.740 --> 02:18:39.900
All right, moving on.

02:18:39.900 --> 02:18:41.980
I'm sure we have lots of other thoughts on this.

02:18:41.980 --> 02:18:46.460
I invite you guys to email us mailbag at Orange Lounge Radio dot com.

02:18:46.460 --> 02:18:50.300
Although we are definitely going to change that email address in the coming weeks.

02:18:50.300 --> 02:18:51.780
But for now, you can still use that.

02:18:51.780 --> 02:18:54.300
There'll be plenty of announcement when we flip it over.

02:18:54.300 --> 02:18:56.580
Mailbag at Orange Lounge Radio dot com.

02:18:56.580 --> 02:18:59.300
Meanwhile, everyone's doing emails these days.

02:18:59.300 --> 02:19:00.300
I love it.

02:19:00.300 --> 02:19:01.300
What?

02:19:01.300 --> 02:19:05.340
Well, Queen City is a National Doucheburg registry and Fifth Dream says dbag shaming

02:19:05.340 --> 02:19:07.180
dot com.

02:19:07.180 --> 02:19:08.380
I am all for that.

02:19:08.380 --> 02:19:09.380
I would do it.

02:19:09.380 --> 02:19:10.380
All right.

02:19:10.380 --> 02:19:15.820
Let's we have to run it through Sweden so that we don't get low Q. We need something

02:19:15.820 --> 02:19:17.860
a little less serious here.

02:19:17.860 --> 02:19:20.780
All right.

02:19:20.780 --> 02:19:21.780
Let's see here.

02:19:22.780 --> 02:19:28.940
Molly Jam, part two, this this one's going to be a little different instead of basing

02:19:28.940 --> 02:19:35.660
it off of the fake Peter Molyneux Twitter account and those kind of ideas.

02:19:35.660 --> 02:19:42.100
These are based off of actual quotes from Peter Molyneux.

02:19:42.100 --> 02:19:45.020
And it's weird.

02:19:45.020 --> 02:19:46.140
It's really weird.

02:19:46.140 --> 02:19:48.500
Can you read the one that was included in that article?

02:19:48.500 --> 02:19:50.100
Yes, I can do that.

02:19:50.100 --> 02:19:54.020
In fact, here is some of the stuff and I think a lot of this is going to be very dirty.

02:19:54.020 --> 02:19:55.300
It's you Americans.

02:19:55.300 --> 02:19:57.980
There's something about nipples you hate.

02:19:57.980 --> 02:20:03.220
If this were Germany, we'd be romping around naked on stage here.

02:20:03.220 --> 02:20:04.220
So that could become a game.

02:20:04.220 --> 02:20:08.660
I feel like that would be a callback to the Atari days, you know, beat them and eat them.

02:20:08.660 --> 02:20:09.660
Gross.

02:20:09.660 --> 02:20:10.660
Like, OK, there you go.

02:20:10.660 --> 02:20:11.660
I'm in the list.

02:20:11.660 --> 02:20:13.840
I'm going to read off a couple of these for you.

02:20:13.840 --> 02:20:15.660
These are potential games right here.

02:20:15.660 --> 02:20:19.460
You can actually break someone's neck on some railing during combat.

02:20:19.460 --> 02:20:24.300
It could be a spike on a fence or a solid brick wall and you get increased experience

02:20:24.300 --> 02:20:26.540
for that as well.

02:20:26.540 --> 02:20:29.380
Neckbreaker like it.

02:20:29.380 --> 02:20:30.380
Let's see here.

02:20:30.380 --> 02:20:34.620
We're we're explorers who have just discovered this new continent of emotion.

02:20:34.620 --> 02:20:35.620
I'd actually play that.

02:20:35.620 --> 02:20:38.620
It would probably be very cool.

02:20:38.620 --> 02:20:39.620
Let's see.

02:20:39.620 --> 02:20:43.220
I wish I had I had some time machine and could go back two weeks.

02:20:43.220 --> 02:20:46.400
You live by your mistakes for sure.

02:20:46.400 --> 02:20:50.680
When you rip your fingers on the screen, you tear the landscape apart with your physical

02:20:50.680 --> 02:20:51.680
hands.

02:20:51.680 --> 02:20:53.120
It just feels amazing, man.

02:20:53.120 --> 02:20:55.600
It's feels amazing.

02:20:55.600 --> 02:20:57.600
Let's see here.

02:20:57.600 --> 02:21:02.000
They have 48 hours to make a game out of these quotes.

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:03.000
Yeah.

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:04.240
There's like 22 quotes here.

02:21:04.240 --> 02:21:06.800
What about ripping the screen would have to be an iOS title?

02:21:06.800 --> 02:21:09.720
I remember I remember hearing about this last year.

02:21:09.720 --> 02:21:14.280
You can eliminate starvation or you can double it.

02:21:14.280 --> 02:21:19.840
You can empty the treasury or you fill it with gold and rub it all over your body.

02:21:19.840 --> 02:21:21.080
That game sounds hot.

02:21:21.080 --> 02:21:22.080
Yeah.

02:21:22.080 --> 02:21:23.600
Another Atari adult game.

02:21:23.600 --> 02:21:30.760
Well, will the first female nudity give you a success or will it turn off an audience?

02:21:30.760 --> 02:21:32.760
What is that going to be?

02:21:32.760 --> 02:21:33.760
I can't wait.

02:21:33.760 --> 02:21:34.760
I got to see that.

02:21:34.760 --> 02:21:35.760
I'm not punishing you for button mashing.

02:21:35.760 --> 02:21:37.920
I'm rewarding you for not button mashing them.

02:21:37.920 --> 02:21:42.040
That's a really big distinction that could be a rhythm game.

02:21:42.040 --> 02:21:43.040
All right.

02:21:43.040 --> 02:21:44.040
Anyhow.

02:21:44.800 --> 02:21:45.800
Show me the game.

02:21:45.800 --> 02:21:46.800
Wait.

02:21:46.800 --> 02:21:47.800
Last one though.

02:21:47.800 --> 02:21:48.800
All right.

02:21:48.800 --> 02:21:49.800
When you're doing it in multiplayer, it feels incredible.

02:21:49.800 --> 02:21:50.800
I love that.

02:21:50.800 --> 02:21:51.800
Oh.

02:21:51.800 --> 02:21:53.880
So the theme is going to be adult games then.

02:21:53.880 --> 02:21:54.880
Good times.

02:21:54.880 --> 02:21:55.880
All right.

02:21:55.880 --> 02:21:59.040
Well, maybe some of these games that come out of MolyJam could be pitched to Dave and

02:21:59.040 --> 02:22:01.000
Buster's arcade or cage chain.

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:02.000
Oh, God.

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:06.000
You know, Dave and Buster's, of course, it used to be the annual site of my birthday

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:09.240
every year when I would play junk.

02:22:09.240 --> 02:22:10.520
It stopped for some reason.

02:22:10.520 --> 02:22:12.800
Yeah, because they got rid of BattleTech.

02:22:13.560 --> 02:22:19.800
Well, anyhow, Dave and Buster's, along with Comedy Central, VH1, and MTV, that whole network

02:22:19.800 --> 02:22:23.760
thing, is putting on this contest called The Next Big Game Search, and you can see this

02:22:23.760 --> 02:22:26.040
at nextgame.cc.com.

02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:27.700
You can fill out a form.

02:22:27.700 --> 02:22:32.760
You can do its ideas, their pitches for a mobile app, larger than life arcade game,

02:22:32.760 --> 02:22:36.120
or simply some improvements for an already classic game.

02:22:36.120 --> 02:22:39.800
You'll be judged on originality, ease of play, family fun, it has to be suitable for people

02:22:39.800 --> 02:22:44.120
of all ages, so some of those nudity games won't be eligible, gameplay experience, and

02:22:44.120 --> 02:22:46.120
difficulty.

02:22:46.120 --> 02:22:52.100
The prizes, the grand prize is Dave and Buster's Create Your Game and Free Games for Life.

02:22:52.100 --> 02:22:57.060
First runner up, $5,000 in gameplay at Dave and Buster's, and second runner up gets $500

02:22:57.060 --> 02:22:58.060
in gameplay.

02:22:58.060 --> 02:23:02.160
The contest runs through July 15th, you have to be a resident of the U.S.

02:23:02.160 --> 02:23:06.240
I'm telling you what, though, if you go and submit an OLR dream game and you win this

02:23:06.240 --> 02:23:13.080
competition, patent pending, and you owe us a chunk of your winnings, just saying,

02:23:13.080 --> 02:23:16.960
you're going to buy us a hell of a nice meal at Dave and Buster's, that's all I'm saying.

02:23:16.960 --> 02:23:19.080
You can record a live from Dave and Buster's.

02:23:19.080 --> 02:23:21.120
Yes, that's right.

02:23:21.120 --> 02:23:23.640
We should go submit some of our favorite dream game ideas into this.

02:23:23.640 --> 02:23:24.640
Just do them all.

02:23:24.640 --> 02:23:25.640
Just do them all.

02:23:25.640 --> 02:23:27.640
This would be fun.

02:23:27.640 --> 02:23:33.240
Can you imagine if the winner, if the winning game out of this was WhatTheyPlay.com Snap

02:23:33.240 --> 02:23:34.440
or Puzzle Sluts?

02:23:34.440 --> 02:23:38.080
No, it has to be for all ages.

02:23:38.080 --> 02:23:41.640
I don't think that the Roosevelt Dave and Buster's has the DDR anymore.

02:23:41.640 --> 02:23:42.640
That's sad.

02:23:42.640 --> 02:23:44.720
Answering Misty in chat room because she asked.

02:23:44.720 --> 02:23:48.320
Besides that, the Roosevelt Dave and Buster's is the size of a closet.

02:23:48.320 --> 02:23:49.320
No one goes there anyway.

02:23:49.320 --> 02:23:52.640
Yeah, when you have a Dave and Buster's that's smaller than the Times Square Dave and Buster's,

02:23:52.640 --> 02:23:53.640
it's a problem.

02:23:53.640 --> 02:23:55.880
All right, let's go to the mailbag.

02:23:55.880 --> 02:24:01.480
Every week you guys email us mailbag at orangelauntrader.com and we sift through the emails that are mixed

02:24:01.480 --> 02:24:05.120
in with all the Asian spam that we get.

02:24:05.120 --> 02:24:06.920
We have a lot of Asian spam this time.

02:24:06.920 --> 02:24:09.640
Oh my god, and Russian spam and French spam.

02:24:09.640 --> 02:24:13.080
It's like just when we thought the French spam and Russian spam was done with.

02:24:13.080 --> 02:24:15.080
Zoot le porn.

02:24:15.080 --> 02:24:16.080
All right, moving on.

02:24:16.080 --> 02:24:20.280
Mailbag at orangelauntrader.com, DarkStalker.io Dive in the mailbag, pull out some emails.

02:24:20.280 --> 02:24:22.280
Okay, hello guys.

02:24:22.280 --> 02:24:23.280
Hello.

02:24:23.280 --> 02:24:25.880
OOR the video game podcast where every gamer has a voice, right?

02:24:25.880 --> 02:24:29.000
Well, I'm going to offer up mine to say girl please.

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.400
Ocarina of Time is not an overrated game.

02:24:31.400 --> 02:24:34.760
It is as deserving of praise just as much as Link to the Past is.

02:24:34.760 --> 02:24:35.760
Next email.

02:24:35.760 --> 02:24:36.760
Hey, Rob.

02:24:36.760 --> 02:24:37.760
Fine.

02:24:37.760 --> 02:24:43.400
To quote a video game, sit your ass down in that chair and drink your goddamn tea.

02:24:43.400 --> 02:24:46.920
Hearts, hearts, hearts, hearts.

02:24:46.920 --> 02:24:48.520
It is, okay, blah, blah, blah.

02:24:48.520 --> 02:24:52.160
The major thing that determines which you have an affinity for is the one you grew up

02:24:52.160 --> 02:24:53.520
playing first.

02:24:53.520 --> 02:24:58.560
Mine obviously was Ocarina, but I also grew up playing Link to the Past on Game Boy Advance.

02:24:59.360 --> 02:25:02.760
I have many fond memories of playing through that game just as I do with Ocarina of Time,

02:25:02.760 --> 02:25:06.680
but Ocarina moved me on a deeper level and made me into the gamer I am today.

02:25:06.680 --> 02:25:10.400
For the record, I actually really like both of them about equally.

02:25:10.400 --> 02:25:12.480
It depends on the mood I'm in.

02:25:12.480 --> 02:25:14.440
Yeah, I really like them both.

02:25:14.440 --> 02:25:16.160
I really like Majora's Mask too.

02:25:16.160 --> 02:25:22.120
It's like I really love lasagna, but I also really, really like sushi.

02:25:22.120 --> 02:25:26.560
I really like Link to the Past, and that's the end of that sentence.

02:25:26.560 --> 02:25:30.160
This brings me to two questions about your opinions on Ocarina of Time, specifically

02:25:30.160 --> 02:25:31.160
for Rob.

02:25:31.160 --> 02:25:32.160
Thank God.

02:25:32.160 --> 02:25:33.160
Rad.

02:25:33.160 --> 02:25:36.120
One, you mentioned that you really like Twilight Princess.

02:25:36.120 --> 02:25:37.760
Hell, I did too.

02:25:37.760 --> 02:25:43.640
I caused a flood warning for all of Northeast Ohio with how much I came buckets over Link

02:25:43.640 --> 02:25:47.960
turning into a wolf.

02:25:47.960 --> 02:25:48.960
Okay.

02:25:48.960 --> 02:25:49.960
Came buckets?

02:25:49.960 --> 02:25:50.960
Whoa.

02:25:50.960 --> 02:25:52.920
I thought I was thinking cried, but it's came buckets.

02:25:52.920 --> 02:25:53.920
Sexy chat.

02:25:53.920 --> 02:25:54.920
Sticky.

02:25:55.160 --> 02:25:59.200
But why are you so fond of a game that took a lot of cues from Ocarina of Time?

02:25:59.200 --> 02:26:00.200
Yeah, Rob.

02:26:00.200 --> 02:26:01.200
Why?

02:26:01.200 --> 02:26:02.200
Yeah, Rob.

02:26:02.200 --> 02:26:03.200
Why?

02:26:03.200 --> 02:26:04.200
Because.

02:26:04.200 --> 02:26:05.200
Next question.

02:26:05.200 --> 02:26:08.160
No, especially with all the waggle technology being new, and it was something that was a

02:26:08.160 --> 02:26:12.600
little bit outside of Wii Sports, and I think also kind of getting to see the game with

02:26:12.600 --> 02:26:13.600
more...

02:26:13.600 --> 02:26:17.000
Like in Ocarina of Time, the 3D was still so early on, you had a lot of very blocky

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:20.160
textures and very solid colors and things.

02:26:20.160 --> 02:26:24.800
And I realized at the time there were a lot of people that were very imaginative, and

02:26:24.800 --> 02:26:25.800
it didn't matter.

02:26:25.800 --> 02:26:29.480
But you have to remember there were a lot of us in my generation that grew up on the

02:26:29.480 --> 02:26:30.480
2D games.

02:26:30.480 --> 02:26:33.200
Like you say that Ocarina of Time was from your generation.

02:26:33.200 --> 02:26:36.320
We were a little more stubborn when it came to getting into the 3D.

02:26:36.320 --> 02:26:39.080
Like I was cool with Mario Kart.

02:26:39.080 --> 02:26:40.960
I like Mario 64.

02:26:40.960 --> 02:26:44.160
I don't think it deserves all the praise that it gets.

02:26:44.160 --> 02:26:46.640
Are you an N64 hater?

02:26:46.640 --> 02:26:48.080
I'm not an N64 hater.

02:26:48.080 --> 02:26:52.200
So you're saying you didn't pee your pants when Star Fox came out?

02:26:52.200 --> 02:26:53.480
When the first Star Fox came out?

02:26:53.480 --> 02:26:54.480
No.

02:26:54.480 --> 02:26:55.480
That was the shit when that came out.

02:26:55.480 --> 02:26:56.480
But it was different.

02:26:56.480 --> 02:26:57.480
But it was 3D.

02:26:57.480 --> 02:26:58.480
It was different.

02:26:58.480 --> 02:26:59.480
But it was still on rails.

02:26:59.480 --> 02:27:00.480
It was different.

02:27:00.480 --> 02:27:02.160
I can't explain it.

02:27:02.160 --> 02:27:07.440
But Ocarina of Time, it wasn't quite HD Zelda, but it definitely felt like that next big

02:27:07.440 --> 02:27:15.000
step that the Zelda series needed to take to make it so much more immersive.

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:19.080
Number two, a while back I remember you mentioning that you're not a big fan of Metroid Prime.

02:27:19.080 --> 02:27:22.640
You didn't like the direction Nintendo took the series and that it just didn't have the

02:27:22.640 --> 02:27:25.320
same feeling of the older games like Super Metroid.

02:27:25.320 --> 02:27:28.760
Do you think that this has to do with why you didn't like Ocarina of Time and the fact

02:27:28.760 --> 02:27:31.200
that both games were a shift to 3D?

02:27:31.200 --> 02:27:32.200
Yes.

02:27:32.200 --> 02:27:35.400
But I like Metroid Prime 3 for the record.

02:27:35.400 --> 02:27:40.000
Did you just not like that change in which the game stayed as top-down Zelda or side-scrolling

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.480
Metroid games?

02:27:42.480 --> 02:27:47.960
Yes and no because I still stand pretty hard for Zelda 2, which even Miyamoto himself has

02:27:47.960 --> 02:27:48.960
issues with.

02:27:48.960 --> 02:27:49.960
Yeah.

02:27:49.960 --> 02:27:50.960
I don't like Zelda 2.

02:27:51.960 --> 02:27:54.560
But I'll defend that game as pretty fucking awesome.

02:27:54.560 --> 02:27:55.560
Dan will agree with you.

02:27:55.560 --> 02:27:56.560
Just saying.

02:27:56.560 --> 02:27:57.560
Yeah.

02:27:57.560 --> 02:28:01.840
It's hard as hell, but beating that game when I was a kid, I'm not gonna be able to do that

02:28:01.840 --> 02:28:02.840
again.

02:28:02.840 --> 02:28:03.840
I've tried.

02:28:03.840 --> 02:28:05.160
That's tough.

02:28:05.160 --> 02:28:07.920
What do you think about Wind Waker?

02:28:07.920 --> 02:28:11.400
I honestly didn't play enough of it.

02:28:11.400 --> 02:28:13.280
I didn't play enough of it.

02:28:13.280 --> 02:28:15.240
Dan beat Wind Waker and he really liked it.

02:28:15.240 --> 02:28:17.000
I just couldn't get into it.

02:28:17.040 --> 02:28:20.960
If I can borrow the HD one or get it on Gamefly or something, I'll give it another try.

02:28:20.960 --> 02:28:23.360
Well, Rob, I can lend you mine.

02:28:23.360 --> 02:28:28.280
Well, you know, there's the HD remake coming out on the US Play Store.

02:28:28.280 --> 02:28:30.080
Oh, you and your HD.

02:28:30.080 --> 02:28:31.080
Why not?

02:28:31.080 --> 02:28:35.080
Thanks for reading and sorry for the slightly longer email, but I just got to defend my

02:28:35.080 --> 02:28:38.880
first and favorite gaming love that is Ocarina of Time and that's from Ospher.

02:28:38.880 --> 02:28:41.000
Well, every gamer has a voice even when they're-

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.840
And I don't need to know about you coming bucket.

02:28:43.840 --> 02:28:46.160
Every gamer has a voice even when their opinions are not correct.

02:28:46.160 --> 02:28:47.160
There's a PS.

02:28:47.160 --> 02:28:48.160
Oh, that was Ospher?

02:28:48.160 --> 02:28:49.160
Yeah.

02:28:49.160 --> 02:28:50.160
I'm not surprised about the coming buckets.

02:28:50.160 --> 02:28:53.480
Yeah, because Twilight Princess has, like, nevermind.

02:28:53.480 --> 02:28:56.600
I actually just finished a playthrough of Ocarina of Time last night with one of my

02:28:56.600 --> 02:28:57.600
close friends.

02:28:57.600 --> 02:29:01.880
We took turns playing through the dungeons and reminiscing on how we grew up while playing

02:29:01.880 --> 02:29:02.880
it as kids.

02:29:02.880 --> 02:29:04.800
After the end credits, we were both pretty teary-eyed.

02:29:04.800 --> 02:29:07.080
You know, so play it again.

02:29:07.080 --> 02:29:08.080
You know what?

02:29:08.080 --> 02:29:14.560
I actually not too long ago played through Ocarina on the GameCube redo disc.

02:29:14.560 --> 02:29:16.800
You need to get the 3DS version.

02:29:16.800 --> 02:29:17.800
It's really good.

02:29:17.800 --> 02:29:21.080
I still wanted 40 bucks for it and they're charging a premium for it because it's out

02:29:21.080 --> 02:29:22.080
of print now.

02:29:22.080 --> 02:29:23.080
Oh.

02:29:23.080 --> 02:29:26.600
Um, by the way, I just want to make sure this is very clear.

02:29:26.600 --> 02:29:28.360
I don't hate Ocarina of Time.

02:29:28.360 --> 02:29:32.400
I never have and I've never said that word on the show in regards to Ocarina of Time.

02:29:32.400 --> 02:29:37.000
I just don't lavish all the praise upon it that many other people do.

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:38.000
I think it's a good game.

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:39.200
In fact, I think it's a great game.

02:29:39.200 --> 02:29:42.280
I just don't think it's in my top 20.

02:29:42.280 --> 02:29:43.520
Rob, you like it.

02:29:43.520 --> 02:29:45.280
You just don't like like it.

02:29:45.280 --> 02:29:46.280
Exactly.

02:29:46.280 --> 02:29:47.280
You wouldn't date it.

02:29:47.280 --> 02:29:48.440
I wouldn't eat it shield.

02:29:48.440 --> 02:29:50.120
You'd go to Pinkberry with it, but you wouldn't date it.

02:29:50.120 --> 02:29:51.120
Get it?

02:29:51.120 --> 02:29:52.120
Because I don't like like it.

02:29:52.120 --> 02:29:53.120
Ha ha ha ha ha.

02:29:53.120 --> 02:29:55.120
That was a Zelda joke, people!

02:29:55.120 --> 02:29:56.120
Awww.

02:29:56.120 --> 02:29:57.120
Hey.

02:29:57.120 --> 02:29:58.120
I try.

02:29:58.120 --> 02:30:00.800
Mwah mwah mwah mwah.

02:30:00.800 --> 02:30:01.800
Last email.

02:30:01.800 --> 02:30:04.080
Um, this is from Sam.

02:30:04.080 --> 02:30:05.080
Hi, Sam.

02:30:05.080 --> 02:30:06.840
Hello, OLR crew.

02:30:06.840 --> 02:30:07.840
I love the show.

02:30:07.840 --> 02:30:12.160
If the devs stop making single player games, are we really any better off than we were

02:30:12.160 --> 02:30:13.880
before Microsoft's change in plans?

02:30:13.880 --> 02:30:14.880
What do you all think?

02:30:14.880 --> 02:30:16.640
First of all, I don't think the single player games are going away.

02:30:16.640 --> 02:30:18.120
No, single player games won't go away.

02:30:18.120 --> 02:30:20.060
There will always be a demand for single player games.

02:30:20.060 --> 02:30:22.040
There are always antisocial people.

02:30:22.040 --> 02:30:27.440
However, I can see where this guy, unless Sam is for Samantha, could be guy or girl,

02:30:27.440 --> 02:30:38.200
but I'm going to assume guy, where this individual, our lovely writer, where this individual is

02:30:38.200 --> 02:30:40.880
getting this from, because it does seem like a lot of single player games that have come

02:30:40.880 --> 02:30:43.320
out lately have a multiplayer mode suddenly in it.

02:30:43.320 --> 02:30:44.320
What?

02:30:44.320 --> 02:30:45.320
Just within the past few months.

02:30:45.320 --> 02:30:46.320
Tomb Raider.

02:30:46.320 --> 02:30:47.320
Tomb Raider.

02:30:47.320 --> 02:30:48.320
Uncharted 3.

02:30:48.320 --> 02:30:49.320
Last of Us.

02:30:49.320 --> 02:30:50.320
Mass Effect 3.

02:30:50.320 --> 02:30:52.800
Like all the Assassin's Creed ones, even though it's a little bit older.

02:30:52.800 --> 02:30:53.800
Assassin's Creed 3.

02:30:53.800 --> 02:30:55.760
They all have multiplayer modes in them.

02:30:55.760 --> 02:31:00.160
Now, I don't think in any of these cases they've necessarily detracted from the single player

02:31:00.160 --> 02:31:03.600
game, although some people kind of resented that you kind of had to play multiplayer to

02:31:03.600 --> 02:31:05.200
get the edge in Mass Effect 3.

02:31:05.200 --> 02:31:06.200
That's true.

02:31:06.200 --> 02:31:08.600
But Mass Effect 3 multiplayer is great, so whatever.

02:31:08.600 --> 02:31:09.600
Yeah, that's the thing.

02:31:09.600 --> 02:31:10.600
That's the thing.

02:31:10.600 --> 02:31:11.600
It's great.

02:31:11.600 --> 02:31:15.000
It also gives the games more replay value, I guess you could say.

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:16.000
I still have yet to-

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:19.600
Although, for Mass Effect fans, replay value is going and making another Shepard.

02:31:19.600 --> 02:31:20.600
Let's be real.

02:31:20.600 --> 02:31:21.600
You know what?

02:31:21.600 --> 02:31:24.600
Okay, and this is the funny thing.

02:31:24.600 --> 02:31:28.280
I'm now on my third playthrough of the first game, because I'm braving the motion sickness.

02:31:28.280 --> 02:31:32.040
I've beaten two and three 27 bajillion times.

02:31:32.040 --> 02:31:37.760
The fun for that for me is making a new Shepard and completely hacking everything I can possibly

02:31:37.760 --> 02:31:40.160
hack about the appearance.

02:31:40.160 --> 02:31:47.160
I have one wearing Ashley's face like it's ripped off of her flesh as she died on Vermaier.

02:31:47.160 --> 02:31:48.160
Wow.

02:31:48.160 --> 02:31:52.480
And wearing Warren's outfit.

02:31:52.480 --> 02:31:54.480
She has been referred to as Hobag Ashley.

02:31:54.480 --> 02:32:01.480
So, in my discussion there, the original question was Xbox One something- I think you closed

02:32:01.480 --> 02:32:02.480
the email, huh?

02:32:02.480 --> 02:32:03.480
I did.

02:32:03.480 --> 02:32:08.360
Do you think that single players are going away from the past?

02:32:08.360 --> 02:32:11.520
I don't think it was necessarily going away, but I think it has something to do with as

02:32:11.520 --> 02:32:12.920
they fade more and more.

02:32:12.920 --> 02:32:15.760
Is Microsoft's decision a bad one?

02:32:15.760 --> 02:32:25.760
Well, now that they- Well, I still think if Microsoft wanted to- Here's the thing.

02:32:25.760 --> 02:32:30.320
If Microsoft wanted to try and push digital, then there's no reason they can't run two

02:32:30.320 --> 02:32:32.160
separate license systems.

02:32:32.160 --> 02:32:35.520
Your disk-based license and your digital-based license.

02:32:35.520 --> 02:32:38.600
Why not enhance the digital license?

02:32:38.600 --> 02:32:41.960
You know, Nintendo dipped their little pinky in the water when they said, well, if you

02:32:41.960 --> 02:32:46.240
buy the game digitally, you'll get 5%- Was it 10% back in points, which you can trade

02:32:46.240 --> 02:32:47.520
in for cards, right?

02:32:47.520 --> 02:32:52.240
A little bit of- It's a tiny ass incentive, but it's some incentive to get the game online.

02:32:52.240 --> 02:32:54.560
What if Microsoft said, okay, we're going to one up that.

02:32:54.560 --> 02:32:59.240
So, when you digitally buy the game, here's the perk you get over getting it on disk,

02:32:59.400 --> 02:33:03.120
is that you can now share this digital game with a friend.

02:33:03.120 --> 02:33:06.920
You can loan it out to a friend across the country instantly.

02:33:06.920 --> 02:33:08.200
That's the perk you get with it.

02:33:08.200 --> 02:33:10.440
Why can't they run both licenses?

02:33:10.440 --> 02:33:11.960
They can do it.

02:33:11.960 --> 02:33:14.280
It will take time to develop and so on.

02:33:14.280 --> 02:33:20.400
I think if Microsoft really wants to, for the Xbox 2, or whatever their next generation

02:33:20.400 --> 02:33:24.360
system is called after this, assuming this box doesn't kill the company, but I don't

02:33:24.360 --> 02:33:33.840
think it will, they could start getting people used to the idea of digital and why it's better.

02:33:33.840 --> 02:33:39.120
As opposed to, nope, we're going to change the whole fucking thing right now.

02:33:39.120 --> 02:33:40.640
We're turning your world upside down.

02:33:40.640 --> 02:33:46.280
Yeah, even though I don't approve of a lot of what the Xbox One was trying to do, I do

02:33:46.280 --> 02:33:49.840
think it's a shame that we didn't see how it could have developed.

02:33:49.840 --> 02:33:53.160
The positive was never clearly communicated, only the negative.

02:33:53.160 --> 02:33:54.920
Yeah, lesson learned, hopefully.

02:33:56.600 --> 02:33:58.600
Anyhow, that was it for Mailbag, right?

02:33:58.600 --> 02:33:59.240
That was.

02:33:59.240 --> 02:34:02.600
Well then that means we get to the FUs of the week.

02:34:02.600 --> 02:34:05.640
Every week here on this show, we let out a little angst.

02:34:05.640 --> 02:34:06.120
Why?

02:34:06.120 --> 02:34:08.680
Because we're just really angry people.

02:34:23.160 --> 02:34:31.880
You know, I hate bringing up traffic, but this was really fucking stupid.

02:34:31.880 --> 02:34:37.080
When I was driving over that same bridge, over across the American River, coming this

02:34:37.080 --> 02:34:45.480
way to your place, Rob, someone was freaking tailgating me during all that road construction-wise.

02:34:45.480 --> 02:34:50.760
With a cop, expecting me to speed, and I'm like, no.

02:34:50.760 --> 02:34:55.000
And I know everybody and their twin goes 20 miles over the speed limit over that bridge,

02:34:55.000 --> 02:35:00.120
but I was about to do it while there was a CHP parked off to the side.

02:35:00.120 --> 02:35:05.640
Sorry, your convenience isn't worth me having a $300 ticket.

02:35:05.640 --> 02:35:06.920
Loki?

02:35:06.920 --> 02:35:08.920
Fuck you to hand, foot, and mouth disease.

02:35:08.920 --> 02:35:11.800
I don't like having blisters on my hands and feet.

02:35:11.800 --> 02:35:13.480
Or my mouth.

02:35:13.480 --> 02:35:15.080
Slidekick, why don't you go next?

02:35:15.080 --> 02:35:21.800
I want to say FU to the lady in the Target parking lot who gave me a very pressed look

02:35:21.800 --> 02:35:24.520
when I was trying to leave.

02:35:24.520 --> 02:35:31.320
I'm sorry that I delayed you 10 seconds getting to your car so you could go home and eat your

02:35:31.320 --> 02:35:32.600
Panda Express.

02:35:32.600 --> 02:35:34.360
I'm sure it just ruined your day.

02:35:34.360 --> 02:35:36.120
That orange chicken just fucking-

02:35:36.120 --> 02:35:37.160
She glared at me.

02:35:37.160 --> 02:35:38.440
She's like, fine, go.

02:35:38.440 --> 02:35:40.760
The orange chicken would not stay warm in this weather.

02:35:40.760 --> 02:35:45.560
Oh, by the way, I'd like to add a thank you to you.

02:35:45.560 --> 02:35:46.760
Aww.

02:35:46.760 --> 02:35:49.240
Thank you so much for facilitating the crack.

02:35:49.800 --> 02:35:52.840
And thank you for the Groupon for brunch.

02:35:52.840 --> 02:35:57.080
Hey, hey, hey, no rainbow and sunshine shit in the FU segment.

02:35:57.080 --> 02:35:58.120
You better watch it.

02:35:58.120 --> 02:35:58.840
FU Rob.

02:35:58.840 --> 02:35:59.960
Yeah, FU Rob.

02:35:59.960 --> 02:36:01.080
Just kidding, I love you.

02:36:01.080 --> 02:36:01.800
I-L-U.

02:36:01.800 --> 02:36:02.520
FU both.

02:36:02.520 --> 02:36:03.320
Here's my finger.

02:36:04.040 --> 02:36:05.480
Should do an I-L-U section.

02:36:07.480 --> 02:36:09.080
You want to do an I love yous of the week?

02:36:09.080 --> 02:36:10.680
Wait, hold on, because I got to get my FU out.

02:36:11.560 --> 02:36:15.800
Fuck you to this goddamn shitty fucking hateful heat.

02:36:15.800 --> 02:36:16.920
Amen.

02:36:16.920 --> 02:36:18.760
Tim TRP in chat agrees.

02:36:18.760 --> 02:36:19.240
All right.

02:36:19.240 --> 02:36:20.120
It is hateful.

02:36:20.120 --> 02:36:22.520
That's a good word for a Rob, it's hateful.

02:36:22.520 --> 02:36:22.840
Okay.

02:36:22.840 --> 02:36:24.280
I'm sliding on the chair.

02:36:24.280 --> 02:36:24.680
Okay.

02:36:24.680 --> 02:36:27.560
It's time for the I-L-U's of the week.

02:36:29.320 --> 02:36:31.320
Yes, I'm using the same music bumper twice.

02:36:31.320 --> 02:36:33.240
It's the I-L-U's of the week.

02:36:33.240 --> 02:36:34.440
I love you KBB.

02:36:36.280 --> 02:36:37.240
Dark Sakura.

02:36:38.200 --> 02:36:40.680
Thank you for the 3DS.

02:36:40.680 --> 02:36:41.320
Slack kick.

02:36:41.320 --> 02:36:42.920
You are my hero forever.

02:36:43.640 --> 02:36:46.440
And I have Animal Crossing now.

02:36:46.440 --> 02:36:48.680
Thank you because you facilitated it.

02:36:48.680 --> 02:36:50.680
And I'm glad you enjoyed your sausage.

02:36:52.120 --> 02:36:54.120
Oh, I always enjoy my sausage.

02:36:54.680 --> 02:37:01.640
And I have to say I-L-U to Dark Sakura for the Groupon for brunch and for sharing her

02:37:01.640 --> 02:37:02.520
French toast with me.

02:37:02.520 --> 02:37:03.320
It was so good.

02:37:03.320 --> 02:37:09.880
Oh, we should, Sam's should just be a sponsor for, you know.

02:37:09.880 --> 02:37:15.320
And I'm going to give my I-L-U of the week to Alan because he's over there in the kitchen

02:37:15.320 --> 02:37:16.520
clearly making dinner.

02:37:17.080 --> 02:37:18.680
You can't hear the foil in the background.

02:37:18.680 --> 02:37:19.800
Oh, being so domestic.

02:37:19.800 --> 02:37:21.080
You've got an I-L-U, right?

02:37:21.080 --> 02:37:21.640
Nope.

02:37:21.640 --> 02:37:26.120
You know, you know, the quickest way to a man's heart is through his stomach.

02:37:26.120 --> 02:37:28.200
So no, it's through the rib cage.

02:37:29.800 --> 02:37:32.120
Loki, what's your I-L-U of the week?

02:37:32.120 --> 02:37:32.840
I don't have one.

02:37:32.840 --> 02:37:33.340
Sorry.

02:37:34.120 --> 02:37:34.600
What?

02:37:34.600 --> 02:37:35.640
You grumpy cat.

02:37:35.640 --> 02:37:38.760
I love the fact it's really sweltering hot in here.

02:37:38.760 --> 02:37:39.400
That's great.

02:37:40.520 --> 02:37:41.400
There's nothing I can do.

02:37:41.400 --> 02:37:43.240
You don't have I-L-U to breadsticks?

02:37:43.240 --> 02:37:45.480
I-L-U to these five fans.

02:37:45.480 --> 02:37:50.200
One, two, three, four, five.

02:37:50.200 --> 02:37:52.200
And all your fans in the chat room.

02:37:52.920 --> 02:37:54.840
Oh, all right.

02:37:54.840 --> 02:37:55.560
Oops, sorry.

02:37:56.360 --> 02:37:57.960
That was not meant to be followed by Holik.

02:37:58.920 --> 02:38:00.680
Everything is meant to be followed by Holik.

02:38:00.680 --> 02:38:04.200
All right, moving on.

02:38:04.200 --> 02:38:09.480
Loki, if you could possibly do the next story.

02:38:09.480 --> 02:38:10.280
Sure.

02:38:10.280 --> 02:38:18.920
Okay, so unfortunately there was a little bit of an issue with the precursor games.

02:38:19.640 --> 02:38:23.880
Apparently, writer, game designer, and artist Ken McColl,

02:38:24.920 --> 02:38:27.960
he was arrested for possession of child pornography.

02:38:27.960 --> 02:38:31.000
That's not good.

02:38:32.360 --> 02:38:34.680
So, of course, no, that's definitely not good.

02:38:34.680 --> 02:38:38.360
So, of course, you know, the company is now distancing themselves from,

02:38:38.360 --> 02:38:42.440
you know, their co-founder, and he doesn't have anything to do now,

02:38:42.440 --> 02:38:47.080
obviously, with Shadows of the Eternals, which, you know.

02:38:47.960 --> 02:38:52.360
Every time I hear Shadow of the Eternal now, I just, I hear this as the theme song.

02:38:52.360 --> 02:39:01.000
Yeah, as if Precursor needed any more bad press, honestly.

02:39:01.960 --> 02:39:02.280
Right?

02:39:03.800 --> 02:39:05.480
It's, yeah, that sucks.

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:08.440
Oh, well, what are you gonna do?

02:39:08.440 --> 02:39:11.320
I mean, that's all you can do.

02:39:11.320 --> 02:39:14.200
Well, for one, don't download child pornography.

02:39:14.200 --> 02:39:15.320
That's not good.

02:39:15.320 --> 02:39:16.200
That's gross.

02:39:16.920 --> 02:39:17.960
It's beyond gross.

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.800
By the way, Rob, did you hear about the 12-year-old girl

02:39:21.800 --> 02:39:26.920
who shamed a guy in her room janking off over her into leaving?

02:39:26.920 --> 02:39:27.800
Ew!

02:39:27.800 --> 02:39:28.600
What?

02:39:28.600 --> 02:39:30.840
Yeah, it was, what was it?

02:39:30.840 --> 02:39:34.920
It was, it was on the, um, I read it on, like, some news thing.

02:39:34.920 --> 02:39:37.880
It was, like, a legit news thing where this 12-year-old girl says,

02:39:37.880 --> 02:39:39.720
you need to be ashamed of yourself.

02:39:39.720 --> 02:39:40.040
Leave.

02:39:40.680 --> 02:39:41.240
And he did.

02:39:42.200 --> 02:39:44.040
The internet's disgusting.

02:39:44.920 --> 02:39:46.120
Disgusting place.

02:39:46.120 --> 02:39:48.040
Well, no, this was a real life thing, but.

02:39:48.600 --> 02:39:49.320
Well, it's just.

02:39:50.200 --> 02:39:50.840
I have a story.

02:39:50.920 --> 02:39:51.800
That was a weird tangent.

02:39:51.800 --> 02:39:53.400
That was a very weird tangent.

02:39:53.400 --> 02:39:55.000
Our soccer took the show to an awkward place.

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:58.600
People who are just awful people need to be ashamed of themselves.

02:40:00.760 --> 02:40:05.240
All right, uh, moving on to, uh, a campaign about something that really

02:40:05.240 --> 02:40:09.240
pisses people off about the Wii U, and that is region locking.

02:40:09.240 --> 02:40:12.120
You know, I guess some of the fans out there are hoping, you know,

02:40:12.120 --> 02:40:17.400
if Operation Rainfall worked and Microsoft ended up reversing Corus on a lot of their shit,

02:40:17.400 --> 02:40:21.880
maybe, just maybe, we can get Nintendo to end region locking.

02:40:21.880 --> 02:40:25.480
And they're taking to Twitter, you know, because Twitter is a very effective way of protesting.

02:40:25.480 --> 02:40:28.680
Well, it worked for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

02:40:28.680 --> 02:40:32.120
End region locking and Nintendo region free are some hashtags.

02:40:33.240 --> 02:40:38.200
There's, um, let's see, some posts on Miiverse as well, which are actually kind of funny.

02:40:38.200 --> 02:40:40.520
Like, I love some of these Miiverse posts.

02:40:40.520 --> 02:40:43.800
I love the one of Monita with, uh, region free, please.

02:40:43.800 --> 02:40:44.440
That's great.

02:40:45.080 --> 02:40:47.960
And then like a picture of Reggie Fils-Aime, I guess that's supposed to be him.

02:40:47.960 --> 02:40:49.880
My body is region free.

02:40:49.880 --> 02:40:54.600
So it's kind of clever that they're, uh, taking to Miiverse to put some of their opinions.

02:40:54.600 --> 02:40:55.480
It won't happen.

02:40:55.480 --> 02:40:56.520
No, it probably won't happen.

02:40:57.080 --> 02:40:59.320
You know, the thing is, is that Nintendo seems to be really,

02:41:00.920 --> 02:41:03.960
they seem to be trying to bring over a lot of stuff that, you know,

02:41:03.960 --> 02:41:05.400
maybe in the past they wouldn't have.

02:41:05.400 --> 02:41:09.000
I mean, Fire Emblem is the thing that we can basically expect at this point,

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:12.600
but also like Bravely Default, you know, that was kind of uncertain,

02:41:12.600 --> 02:41:14.520
but Nintendo is helping bring that over.

02:41:14.520 --> 02:41:19.640
So even though it would be nice if the Wii U was region free,

02:41:19.640 --> 02:41:22.920
I think that Nintendo is really trying to listen to gamers

02:41:22.920 --> 02:41:27.560
and know that they want these games that are, that are over in Japan.

02:41:28.680 --> 02:41:29.240
Let's hope.

02:41:30.280 --> 02:41:30.680
All right.

02:41:30.680 --> 02:41:34.520
Well, that brings us closer and closer to the end of the show,

02:41:34.520 --> 02:41:37.640
but, uh, we are going to open up the Skype line right now

02:41:37.640 --> 02:41:39.880
to get some of your voices here on the show.

02:41:39.880 --> 02:41:44.040
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:41:44.040 --> 02:41:44.920
That's all one word.

02:41:44.920 --> 02:41:47.160
We are taking your calls right now.

02:41:47.160 --> 02:41:48.840
We'll get to some Twitter topics as well.

02:41:48.840 --> 02:41:50.280
And also any last minute stories.

02:41:50.280 --> 02:41:53.400
I don't know if Dark Soccer or Loki have anything they want to get out real quick.

02:41:53.400 --> 02:41:55.160
I think I just have, I want to get out of the heat.

02:41:56.360 --> 02:42:00.040
Sim City has a wonderful new piece of DLC for $9.

02:42:00.040 --> 02:42:01.080
It's Zeppelin's.

02:42:02.200 --> 02:42:07.960
You get, you get an airship and a hot air balloon park as an, uh, basic.

02:42:08.200 --> 02:42:09.880
Is it piloted by a guy named Sid?

02:42:09.880 --> 02:42:10.600
I don't know.

02:42:10.600 --> 02:42:15.320
Hot air balloon park or an airship and an airship mass transit option.

02:42:15.320 --> 02:42:15.880
$9.

02:42:15.880 --> 02:42:17.480
That's all you get for $9.

02:42:17.480 --> 02:42:19.560
Will it explode like the Hindenburg did?

02:42:19.560 --> 02:42:22.280
I mean, I mean, not to be in poor taste, but.

02:42:22.280 --> 02:42:23.080
Too soon, Rob.

02:42:23.080 --> 02:42:23.560
Too soon.

02:42:23.560 --> 02:42:24.840
Thanks to the power of cloud.

02:42:24.840 --> 02:42:27.160
Part of Sim City is disasters, right?

02:42:27.800 --> 02:42:28.200
Yeah.

02:42:28.200 --> 02:42:29.640
Sim City was a disaster.

02:42:31.960 --> 02:42:32.600
Oh boy.

02:42:32.600 --> 02:42:34.520
It wouldn't be the same without the reporter.

02:42:34.520 --> 02:42:34.840
All right.

02:42:34.840 --> 02:42:36.920
Let's go to the phones because we do have calls coming in.

02:42:36.920 --> 02:42:37.880
Hi, you're on orange songs radio.

02:42:37.880 --> 02:42:38.280
Who's this?

02:42:38.920 --> 02:42:39.400
Hello.

02:42:40.120 --> 02:42:40.360
Hello.

02:42:40.360 --> 02:42:41.320
It's code man.

02:42:41.320 --> 02:42:42.040
Hey, code man.

02:42:42.040 --> 02:42:42.520
How you doing?

02:42:43.160 --> 02:42:44.440
I haven't called in in a while.

02:42:44.440 --> 02:42:45.480
I was going to say a long time.

02:42:45.480 --> 02:42:45.880
No talk.

02:42:45.880 --> 02:42:47.080
What's on your mind, buddy?

02:42:47.080 --> 02:42:49.880
Well, you know, it's, it's busy everywhere.

02:42:50.520 --> 02:42:53.160
Real life is not allowed to get in the way of OLR.

02:42:53.160 --> 02:42:53.480
Okay.

02:42:53.480 --> 02:42:54.120
Thanks.

02:42:54.120 --> 02:42:54.840
It never does.

02:42:55.880 --> 02:42:56.680
Good answer.

02:42:56.680 --> 02:42:57.560
What's up, buddy?

02:42:58.280 --> 02:43:03.240
Um, no, I was just calling, um, about the whole YouTube thing earlier because,

02:43:03.240 --> 02:43:06.440
you know, I, I'm your friendly neighborhood YouTuber, I guess.

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:14.280
Um, but, uh, they, they're actually starting to monetize for minutes watched now.

02:43:14.280 --> 02:43:20.200
So like, it's not so much your video anymore as it is the minutes of like,

02:43:20.200 --> 02:43:21.960
how long somebody watches your video.

02:43:23.720 --> 02:43:25.880
So, so, I mean, it's, it's really, I don't know.

02:43:25.880 --> 02:43:31.000
They keep changing it, but, um, to say something about, I believe square enix

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:37.160
or Squeenix as a lot of people say, um, is they did that for a really long time.

02:43:37.160 --> 02:43:40.280
They would take, they wouldn't let anyone put any of their games up,

02:43:40.280 --> 02:43:43.480
which I always see it as free advertisement for the company.

02:43:43.480 --> 02:43:46.280
But I mean, you're playing their game.

02:43:46.280 --> 02:43:47.080
People are watching it.

02:43:47.080 --> 02:43:49.000
They say, Oh, you know, this is a really good game.

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:49.800
I want to buy it.

02:43:49.800 --> 02:43:52.920
So then they go out and buy it and then that's free advertisement.

02:43:52.920 --> 02:43:56.520
So to me, that's, I mean, that's the way, but I see, I see where everybody's

02:43:56.520 --> 02:43:59.720
coming from, where, you know, you're playing this game, you're, you're

02:43:59.720 --> 02:44:05.160
claiming it as your own video, but it's actually just your voice over

02:44:05.160 --> 02:44:07.160
something else that somebody else made.

02:44:07.160 --> 02:44:12.440
And I can understand that, but, but yeah, that's, I just want to call in

02:44:12.440 --> 02:44:14.760
and, uh, kind of, cause I, cause I missed that whole conversation.

02:44:14.760 --> 02:44:19.640
I had to go put the girl down to sleep, but, uh, but yeah, I just wanted to

02:44:19.640 --> 02:44:22.280
kind of call in and talk about that a little bit.

02:44:22.280 --> 02:44:23.000
No worries.

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:25.800
Um, you probably aren't surprised to hear that people make a living off

02:44:25.800 --> 02:44:27.000
those let's play videos though.

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:27.500
Right?

02:44:28.220 --> 02:44:33.100
Um, there's a lot of people, uh, out there, a lot of really, really big

02:44:33.100 --> 02:44:38.860
YouTubers that make a huge, huge killing off of, uh, off of just doing

02:44:38.860 --> 02:44:42.220
let's plays and doing, uh, Minecraft's real big right now.

02:44:42.220 --> 02:44:45.260
Uh, there's, there's just tons of people out there making so much money

02:44:45.260 --> 02:44:46.140
off of that.

02:44:46.140 --> 02:44:50.780
And yeah, to an extent you make a lot of money, but I don't really think

02:44:50.780 --> 02:44:55.420
unless, unless you partner with a third party, I don't really think, which

02:44:55.420 --> 02:44:57.740
sometimes you kind of get screwed out of that money too.

02:44:57.740 --> 02:45:02.780
So, you know, either way, if you, if you manage yourself correctly on

02:45:02.780 --> 02:45:07.100
YouTube, I think you can make a good amount of money, but other than that,

02:45:07.100 --> 02:45:11.260
I do it just to do it and, and, you know, to show people what I'm playing

02:45:11.260 --> 02:45:13.020
and, you know, all that stuff.

02:45:13.020 --> 02:45:15.180
I mean, I don't do it for the money obviously, cause I'm not making

02:45:15.180 --> 02:45:19.900
anything from it, but, um, but it's just fun to do to me and I love video

02:45:19.900 --> 02:45:20.940
editing and all that stuff.

02:45:20.940 --> 02:45:21.980
So that's what it's got.

02:45:21.980 --> 02:45:23.260
It's like podcasting.

02:45:23.260 --> 02:45:25.660
And I've said this before on an earlier show, if you don't love it, what

02:45:25.660 --> 02:45:26.860
the hell are you doing?

02:45:26.860 --> 02:45:27.500
Well, exactly.

02:45:27.500 --> 02:45:31.100
If you get into YouTube to make money, you're getting into the, you're

02:45:31.100 --> 02:45:32.380
getting into the wrong reasons.

02:45:32.380 --> 02:45:35.500
It's like those companies that are like, we need to hire an agency to make

02:45:35.500 --> 02:45:36.620
a viral video.

02:45:36.620 --> 02:45:40.300
Um, you don't force something to go viral that has to like happen, you

02:45:40.300 --> 02:45:40.540
know?

02:45:40.540 --> 02:45:41.100
Well, no.

02:45:41.100 --> 02:45:42.540
Yeah, that's, that's totally true.

02:45:42.540 --> 02:45:44.140
And you know, that's, that's great.

02:45:44.140 --> 02:45:49.100
Oh, and I also wanted to say, I, you will have a, a buffer from, uh, from

02:45:49.100 --> 02:45:53.180
a one-year-old, uh, well, actually from a, well, she'll be two probably

02:45:53.180 --> 02:45:57.020
by the time that I make the buffer, but I got her to say orange today,

02:45:57.020 --> 02:45:59.820
but, uh, she has to put all of them together.

02:45:59.820 --> 02:46:01.900
I haven't got adorable.

02:46:03.100 --> 02:46:05.740
So that's, that should be fantastic.

02:46:05.740 --> 02:46:06.940
So excited to hear it.

02:46:08.060 --> 02:46:08.380
All right.

02:46:08.380 --> 02:46:11.260
Uh, yeah, that's, I think that's about it really.

02:46:11.260 --> 02:46:15.900
Uh, so, I mean, yeah, I just, I was up late tonight, so I thought I'd

02:46:15.900 --> 02:46:17.500
give you guys a call cause I haven't talked to you in a while.

02:46:17.900 --> 02:46:18.940
Always good to hear from you.

02:46:18.940 --> 02:46:19.100
Yeah.

02:46:19.100 --> 02:46:20.380
Always good to hear from you.

02:46:20.380 --> 02:46:22.140
Uh, you, it's, it's good to hear from you.

02:46:22.140 --> 02:46:25.500
You take care and, uh, I hope everybody's doing well out there in Oklahoma.

02:46:25.500 --> 02:46:28.620
I'm glad to see you've been okay throughout all the, I mean, here I am

02:46:28.620 --> 02:46:29.660
bitching about the heat.

02:46:29.660 --> 02:46:30.700
That was a bad pun.

02:46:30.700 --> 02:46:32.380
At least I don't have what I didn't even.

02:46:32.380 --> 02:46:33.180
He's okay.

02:46:33.180 --> 02:46:34.540
Oh God, shut up.

02:46:34.540 --> 02:46:36.940
At least I don't have these tornadoes running through my backyard.

02:46:36.940 --> 02:46:40.300
So I'm, I'm glad to hear you're all right with all that.

02:46:40.300 --> 02:46:42.060
We're getting the heat right now too.

02:46:42.060 --> 02:46:46.540
We're, I think today we got probably a high of 101, which is not a whole, I

02:46:46.540 --> 02:46:51.180
mean, it's not big here, but I mean, um, we're not getting tornadoes and

02:46:51.180 --> 02:46:52.460
that's all that we care about.

02:46:52.460 --> 02:46:56.940
Although I am getting a shelter put in, um, in September, I think.

02:46:56.940 --> 02:46:58.620
So that's good.

02:46:58.620 --> 02:47:01.740
All right, buddy, I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls, but, uh,

02:47:01.740 --> 02:47:02.300
stay safe.

02:47:03.100 --> 02:47:03.500
All right.

02:47:03.500 --> 02:47:07.100
You guys keep, keep making the podcast for another 16 years.

02:47:07.100 --> 02:47:07.660
How about that?

02:47:07.660 --> 02:47:08.540
We'll try.

02:47:08.540 --> 02:47:08.860
All right.

02:47:09.420 --> 02:47:09.820
All right.

02:47:09.820 --> 02:47:10.380
We'll see you.

02:47:10.380 --> 02:47:10.620
All right.

02:47:10.620 --> 02:47:11.580
Bye bye.

02:47:12.620 --> 02:47:13.580
16 years.

02:47:13.580 --> 02:47:14.780
I will be 50.

02:47:14.780 --> 02:47:16.940
I don't know about that.

02:47:16.940 --> 02:47:17.580
All right, we'll see.

02:47:17.580 --> 02:47:19.260
All right, let's go to some more calls.

02:47:19.260 --> 02:47:20.540
We have phones ringing tonight.

02:47:20.540 --> 02:47:21.580
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

02:47:21.580 --> 02:47:21.980
Who's this?

02:47:22.860 --> 02:47:24.380
Uh, this is Zormay.

02:47:24.380 --> 02:47:25.020
Zormay.

02:47:25.020 --> 02:47:25.820
Hey, Zormay.

02:47:25.820 --> 02:47:27.420
I don't think, have you called the show before?

02:47:27.420 --> 02:47:28.300
I don't recognize your name.

02:47:28.300 --> 02:47:31.820
Uh, yeah, I called a few times back in the day.

02:47:31.820 --> 02:47:32.780
Oh, back in the day.

02:47:32.780 --> 02:47:33.500
Well, welcome back.

02:47:33.500 --> 02:47:34.380
What's on your mind, buddy?

02:47:35.260 --> 02:47:40.700
Um, I know you guys are average gamers of, uh, Final Fantasy 11 and now that

02:47:40.700 --> 02:47:44.300
Final Fantasy 14 has come out and it looks like it's going to be pretty good.

02:47:44.300 --> 02:47:45.100
I've been playing it.

02:47:45.100 --> 02:47:45.980
Have you guys?

02:47:46.620 --> 02:47:47.340
Absolutely.

02:47:47.340 --> 02:47:48.700
You might've missed the beginning of the show.

02:47:48.700 --> 02:47:50.220
I was talking a bit about it.

02:47:50.220 --> 02:47:51.100
Uh, that's all right.

02:47:51.100 --> 02:47:55.020
We, we actually, all of us, except Slidekick, you haven't been able to play it, right?

02:47:55.020 --> 02:47:57.740
No, not lately, but I did play in like an earlier phase.

02:47:57.740 --> 02:47:58.060
Okay.

02:47:58.060 --> 02:47:58.380
Yeah.

02:47:58.380 --> 02:47:58.620
Yeah.

02:47:58.620 --> 02:47:59.580
We've all been playing it.

02:47:59.580 --> 02:48:01.340
I, I especially have been playing it.

02:48:01.340 --> 02:48:02.540
I, I really love it.

02:48:02.540 --> 02:48:06.700
Uh, I have, uh, two classes at 16 on my character that's going to get deleted in

02:48:06.700 --> 02:48:10.700
a week anyway, but I'm having a lot of fun just exploring this gorgeous game.

02:48:10.700 --> 02:48:11.980
That's very fan servicey.

02:48:13.100 --> 02:48:13.660
No.

02:48:13.660 --> 02:48:17.740
Did you, you said that the game is going to delete your, uh, your, uh, I don't

02:48:17.740 --> 02:48:18.620
know if that's official.

02:48:19.260 --> 02:48:24.620
Um, it's, it's out there that right now we're in what's called beta phase three

02:48:24.620 --> 02:48:27.820
and they have said that they're going to wipe the characters at the end of beta

02:48:27.820 --> 02:48:28.620
phase three.

02:48:28.620 --> 02:48:33.340
We just don't know when the end is, but before the original official release of

02:48:33.340 --> 02:48:36.940
the game, there is another character wipe slotted because there's going to be beta

02:48:36.940 --> 02:48:41.500
phase four, which is open beta where everybody's going to get to play.

02:48:41.500 --> 02:48:46.460
And they did say about beta phase four that they're going to try and, uh, let

02:48:46.460 --> 02:48:48.380
those characters carry into the live game.

02:48:48.380 --> 02:48:51.100
But they did clearly say so that people don't about it.

02:48:51.100 --> 02:48:54.700
If it happens, another character wipe at the end of all the betas still may have

02:48:54.700 --> 02:48:55.260
to occur.

02:48:55.260 --> 02:48:57.820
So we may still be looking at two character wipes.

02:48:57.820 --> 02:49:01.500
So don't get too attached to your character, but that's, I mean, considering

02:49:01.500 --> 02:49:04.220
they haven't even opened up our arcanist as a job yet.

02:49:04.220 --> 02:49:08.060
And I mean, you have to, I think have a 1.0 character or something.

02:49:08.060 --> 02:49:10.940
I mean, consider we don't have all of that in there yet.

02:49:10.940 --> 02:49:11.900
I'm okay with them.

02:49:11.900 --> 02:49:14.300
I mean, it is a beta is a beta, not a demo.

02:49:15.420 --> 02:49:17.100
Well, yeah, that's, that's the whole thing.

02:49:17.100 --> 02:49:22.140
I think I've been enjoying playing different characters and it's been quite

02:49:22.140 --> 02:49:27.820
fun because there's just so many different customizations and, um, that

02:49:27.820 --> 02:49:29.580
whole, what do you think about the free company?

02:49:29.580 --> 02:49:33.420
That's what I want because a lot of people see that you have link shells as

02:49:33.420 --> 02:49:35.580
well, but there's no need for them because you're a free company.

02:49:35.580 --> 02:49:35.740
Yeah.

02:49:35.740 --> 02:49:38.940
I haven't been able to test that yet because I don't even really understand it

02:49:38.940 --> 02:49:42.220
is that you have, uh, you have like the link shells or the little like sub

02:49:42.220 --> 02:49:45.500
guilds, but then the free company is like your huge chat channel.

02:49:45.500 --> 02:49:45.740
Right.

02:49:45.740 --> 02:49:48.300
It's like you have big guilds and little guilds as a part of that.

02:49:48.300 --> 02:49:48.620
Right.

02:49:49.420 --> 02:49:49.740
Right.

02:49:49.740 --> 02:49:50.380
It's so weird.

02:49:50.380 --> 02:49:56.940
Basically like it's, it's like, you're able to go ahead and make, make a,

02:49:56.940 --> 02:50:00.620
make a group of people a little bit more organized where you can have like

02:50:00.620 --> 02:50:05.340
cadets and I'm not too sure, but like people are who are in your officers.

02:50:05.340 --> 02:50:08.220
You have like cadets and you have like commanders or some sort of thing like

02:50:08.220 --> 02:50:13.500
that and they can basically distribute money and gill and based off of like

02:50:13.500 --> 02:50:15.100
their prestige inside the link shell.

02:50:15.100 --> 02:50:16.620
I mean inside the free company.

02:50:17.180 --> 02:50:21.660
I don't know exactly on too much detail about it, but it's more than just a

02:50:21.660 --> 02:50:23.340
glorified link shell though.

02:50:23.340 --> 02:50:27.020
My understanding, especially coming from World of Warcraft, which I've played

02:50:27.020 --> 02:50:31.500
for a long time and I'm still continuing to play throughout Final Fantasy 14.

02:50:31.500 --> 02:50:35.020
You had a lot of big guilds in World of Warcraft that had several rating

02:50:35.020 --> 02:50:35.500
groups in it.

02:50:35.580 --> 02:50:39.740
In fact, my own guild for a time that I was reading with had infamously to an

02:50:39.740 --> 02:50:42.460
extent, two rating groups in it, raid group one and raid group two.

02:50:42.460 --> 02:50:44.780
And that actually is what kind of drove that guild apart.

02:50:44.780 --> 02:50:47.900
But you know, I would think that maybe with the free company set up, you would

02:50:47.900 --> 02:50:51.100
still have like that, but then like each raid team would have its own little

02:50:51.100 --> 02:50:54.220
link shell in it for, you know, raid nights and stuff like that.

02:50:55.500 --> 02:50:57.100
It's interesting though, the way they're doing that.

02:50:58.140 --> 02:51:03.980
Yeah, I do think is going to be great for organization because I don't know how,

02:51:03.980 --> 02:51:08.140
well, I do know actually you, you, you played Final Fantasy 11, but you didn't

02:51:08.140 --> 02:51:11.180
play it to extent where you were like in an end game.

02:51:11.180 --> 02:51:12.780
No, I never got that far.

02:51:12.780 --> 02:51:16.380
I played for years and never got a character past like 56.

02:51:16.380 --> 02:51:18.700
I think it was the highest I ever got crazy.

02:51:18.700 --> 02:51:19.020
All right.

02:51:19.020 --> 02:51:24.540
So at the like, so if me, I had a couple of jobs, like it's level 75 and it was

02:51:24.540 --> 02:51:30.940
kind of difficult, um, distributing, um, gill and prizes and, um, drops

02:51:30.940 --> 02:51:34.140
throughout the several instances like dynamics and stuff like that.

02:51:34.140 --> 02:51:38.620
So I think it'll make it a lot easier for people to just know and who is who

02:51:38.620 --> 02:51:39.580
going forward.

02:51:39.580 --> 02:51:43.340
I'm a little bit worried because of, it's a lot of jobs and you know, things

02:51:43.340 --> 02:51:48.220
can get nerfed, like how Lancer got nerfed when Samurai Dragoon tend to go

02:51:48.220 --> 02:51:48.860
out of hand.

02:51:48.860 --> 02:51:51.500
I don't think you remember that with the Penta thrusts.

02:51:51.500 --> 02:51:52.220
Yep, I do.

02:51:52.780 --> 02:51:53.180
Yeah.

02:51:53.180 --> 02:51:55.980
So it's, I don't know, I'm still waiting.

02:51:55.980 --> 02:51:57.900
I mean, like, we'll see how things go.

02:51:57.980 --> 02:52:01.020
I mean, uh, did you play the first one?

02:52:01.740 --> 02:52:03.900
Yes, I did play 1.0.

02:52:03.900 --> 02:52:05.580
I played at the very, very beginning.

02:52:05.580 --> 02:52:10.220
I played the beta for 1.0 and then I played, uh, the very, very early version

02:52:10.220 --> 02:52:12.940
or when it first came out and I hated it.

02:52:12.940 --> 02:52:17.580
And, uh, I tried playing later, uh, after they opened it up and said, all

02:52:17.580 --> 02:52:19.020
right, we're not charging a monthly fee anymore.

02:52:19.020 --> 02:52:21.900
I want to say it was like January, February the next year.

02:52:21.900 --> 02:52:26.060
And it was still like, it just, it wasn't, it was, it made me go back and

02:52:26.060 --> 02:52:27.820
play 11 for a little bit.

02:52:28.700 --> 02:52:29.340
Wow.

02:52:29.340 --> 02:52:31.020
But, um, yeah, I felt the same way.

02:52:31.020 --> 02:52:34.700
I mean, it was kind of weird the way the auction house wasn't available.

02:52:34.700 --> 02:52:40.540
And, um, there was no, like, no directions.

02:52:40.540 --> 02:52:41.180
Crazy.

02:52:41.180 --> 02:52:45.020
But, um, okay, quickly, before I let you go, um, what, since you were a player

02:52:45.020 --> 02:52:48.380
of 11 for so long, what do you think of 14 having come from 11?

02:52:49.020 --> 02:52:51.100
Um, I'm, I'm excited.

02:52:51.100 --> 02:52:55.740
Um, I'm taking my time, you know, because, you know, when I played for

02:52:55.740 --> 02:52:58.620
the 11, I didn't really know what I was, I wanted to do.

02:52:58.620 --> 02:53:02.140
I kind of had like a warrior and we found that we had lack of white mages.

02:53:02.140 --> 02:53:05.340
So I had to go back and kind of like build up a white mage.

02:53:05.340 --> 02:53:09.340
I'm playing like as many jobs as possible on several different servers

02:53:09.340 --> 02:53:12.060
and just trying to get a basic understanding of the game.

02:53:12.620 --> 02:53:15.100
I'm pretty sure, I'm pretty sure I want to be a scholar.

02:53:15.100 --> 02:53:17.900
So I'm hoping Arcanist is open soon.

02:53:17.900 --> 02:53:18.300
Oh God.

02:53:18.300 --> 02:53:21.740
I'm hoping they open soon so I can see it before the real game goes live,

02:53:21.740 --> 02:53:22.620
but we'll see.

02:53:22.620 --> 02:53:25.100
But anyway, I have to let you go, but thank you so much for the call.

02:53:25.100 --> 02:53:25.820
Good to hear from you.

02:53:25.820 --> 02:53:27.900
And I'll, I'll always talk MMOs with people.

02:53:28.540 --> 02:53:29.180
No problem.

02:53:29.180 --> 02:53:29.740
Take care.

02:53:29.740 --> 02:53:30.380
Take care, buddy.

02:53:30.380 --> 02:53:30.880
Bye.

02:53:31.580 --> 02:53:32.460
All right.

02:53:32.460 --> 02:53:32.780
Good call.

02:53:32.780 --> 02:53:35.900
I love hearing from people tonight is people we haven't heard from in a while

02:53:35.900 --> 02:53:37.100
night, apparently.

02:53:37.820 --> 02:53:38.380
All right.

02:53:38.380 --> 02:53:39.420
You all right over there, Loki?

02:53:39.420 --> 02:53:40.060
You're giggling.

02:53:40.060 --> 02:53:45.900
I love these like battlefield three animated GIFs because it just, I kind of

02:53:46.540 --> 02:53:47.040
played even.

02:53:47.740 --> 02:53:48.460
Yes.

02:53:48.460 --> 02:53:51.180
I want to play it even more because it looks so glitchy.

02:53:51.180 --> 02:53:56.460
Sometimes like this guy snipes a jet, makes it blow up in front of his face

02:53:56.460 --> 02:53:57.100
and nothing happens.

02:53:57.100 --> 02:54:01.420
So a one eight seven seven game or a username on Skype, orange lounge radio,

02:54:01.420 --> 02:54:02.140
all one word.

02:54:02.140 --> 02:54:03.820
We'll try to squeeze in at least one more call.

02:54:04.460 --> 02:54:07.820
I wanted to do a Twitter topic that came in here from a tiger claw,

02:54:07.820 --> 02:54:08.700
send us a tweet.

02:54:08.700 --> 02:54:09.340
What is it here?

02:54:10.300 --> 02:54:13.260
Nintendo defends the rapid release of new Mario game.

02:54:13.260 --> 02:54:15.500
Although our phone lines are lighting up our, I'll come back to this in a

02:54:15.580 --> 02:54:16.780
minute for now.

02:54:16.780 --> 02:54:17.820
Let's go to the Skype line.

02:54:17.820 --> 02:54:18.860
Hi, you're on orange launch radio.

02:54:18.860 --> 02:54:19.360
Who's this?

02:54:20.860 --> 02:54:21.660
Hello.

02:54:21.660 --> 02:54:22.160
Hello.

02:54:22.940 --> 02:54:26.540
Oh, we have a, we have a CT and Gigi here.

02:54:26.540 --> 02:54:27.260
Oh my gosh.

02:54:27.260 --> 02:54:28.140
You guys are together.

02:54:28.140 --> 02:54:29.820
It's a, it's a cam thing though.

02:54:29.820 --> 02:54:33.100
Although all I see is like half of dark Tetsuya's head, but that's okay.

02:54:33.100 --> 02:54:33.900
What's up you guys?

02:54:35.020 --> 02:54:36.140
Oh, not a whole lot.

02:54:36.140 --> 02:54:38.540
You know, just been hanging out, playing a lot of games.

02:54:38.540 --> 02:54:39.040
Yeah.

02:54:39.660 --> 02:54:40.540
Good times.

02:54:40.540 --> 02:54:41.260
Like what games?

02:54:41.260 --> 02:54:43.260
I got sucked into unepic.

02:54:43.260 --> 02:54:44.940
That game is so fun.

02:54:44.940 --> 02:54:45.500
Unepic.

02:54:46.060 --> 02:54:46.560
Yeah.

02:54:47.100 --> 02:54:48.460
Tell us a little bit about that one.

02:54:49.100 --> 02:54:50.300
Um, it's pretty fun.

02:54:50.300 --> 02:54:51.980
It's like a dungeon crawler.

02:54:52.700 --> 02:54:53.740
Oh, okay.

02:54:54.460 --> 02:54:54.940
Cool.

02:54:54.940 --> 02:54:57.260
That's like a Metroidvania type thing.

02:54:57.260 --> 02:54:59.260
Uh, I'm here for that.

02:54:59.260 --> 02:55:01.340
Is that free or is that like?

02:55:01.340 --> 02:55:03.580
Um, it's $7.99 on Steam.

02:55:03.580 --> 02:55:04.380
Ooh, that's not bad.

02:55:04.940 --> 02:55:05.580
All right.

02:55:05.580 --> 02:55:05.980
Okay.

02:55:05.980 --> 02:55:07.820
I'll, I'll have to write that one down.

02:55:07.820 --> 02:55:08.380
Very cool.

02:55:10.300 --> 02:55:12.460
So I'm looking at pictures actually.

02:55:12.460 --> 02:55:13.580
It does look kind of neat.

02:55:13.580 --> 02:55:16.700
It is very Castlevania like with big dragons.

02:55:18.060 --> 02:55:18.300
Yeah.

02:55:18.300 --> 02:55:23.420
And you can like level up your character with, with, um, each there's a bar at the top that

02:55:23.420 --> 02:55:25.740
has like a level leveling system.

02:55:25.740 --> 02:55:31.420
And with each level, you can put it into weapons or your, um, or, or yourself, like to get

02:55:31.420 --> 02:55:33.980
more, um, stamina and whatnot.

02:55:33.980 --> 02:55:34.860
It's pretty fun.

02:55:34.860 --> 02:55:35.980
That looks super fun.

02:55:35.980 --> 02:55:37.980
I think I am going to check that out.

02:55:37.980 --> 02:55:38.620
That's awesome.

02:55:39.740 --> 02:55:40.300
Yeah.

02:55:40.300 --> 02:55:41.020
Very cool.

02:55:41.020 --> 02:55:44.140
So did you guys just call in to get me sucked into a new game and make me spend $8?

02:55:44.860 --> 02:55:45.100
Yeah.

02:55:46.540 --> 02:55:47.340
Yeah.

02:55:47.340 --> 02:55:48.140
Well, congrats.

02:55:48.940 --> 02:55:50.860
We're like, we need to suck them into another game.

02:55:50.860 --> 02:55:51.020
Yeah.

02:55:51.660 --> 02:55:51.900
Yeah.

02:55:51.900 --> 02:55:55.180
Cause I haven't been talking about how I've been playing Final Fantasy 14 literally all

02:55:55.180 --> 02:55:56.140
weekend long.

02:55:56.140 --> 02:55:57.580
Just updated League of Legends.

02:55:57.580 --> 02:55:57.900
Oh yeah.

02:55:57.900 --> 02:55:59.020
I got time for another one.

02:55:59.020 --> 02:55:59.500
That's all right.

02:55:59.500 --> 02:56:00.060
Bring it.

02:56:00.060 --> 02:56:00.460
Jelly.

02:56:00.460 --> 02:56:04.060
I want to get, I was trying to get into the beta, but I don't think I made it.

02:56:04.060 --> 02:56:04.700
Good news.

02:56:04.700 --> 02:56:06.140
Beta four is going to be open.

02:56:06.140 --> 02:56:07.580
Anyone who wants to play can play it.

02:56:08.540 --> 02:56:10.940
And then I heard about, um, the pricing system.

02:56:10.940 --> 02:56:14.060
Is that already, have they already fixed it or?

02:56:14.060 --> 02:56:18.220
Uh, you don't have to pay for it yet, but when the game goes live on August 27th, I

02:56:18.220 --> 02:56:21.100
believe it's $12.95 a month is the lower tier.

02:56:21.100 --> 02:56:24.060
And then like $14.95 for eight characters or something.

02:56:24.620 --> 02:56:25.500
Don't quote me on that.

02:56:26.460 --> 02:56:27.660
That seems pretty legit.

02:56:27.660 --> 02:56:31.020
Like I think I can work that into my budget because I want that game so bad.

02:56:31.020 --> 02:56:31.260
Yeah.

02:56:31.260 --> 02:56:31.820
It's going to be fun.

02:56:32.380 --> 02:56:37.820
Oh, cause I started playing, um, final fantasy back when seven came out.

02:56:39.260 --> 02:56:44.460
So unfortunately I was never able to really play the online ones, but I've been a fan

02:56:44.460 --> 02:56:45.580
ever since seven.

02:56:47.420 --> 02:56:49.580
Well, there's a lot of fan service in 14.

02:56:50.700 --> 02:56:50.940
Yeah.

02:56:51.900 --> 02:56:52.380
All right.

02:56:52.380 --> 02:56:53.260
Moogles.

02:56:53.260 --> 02:56:53.580
All right.

02:56:53.580 --> 02:56:58.060
Well you guys, you have fun and uh, go find another game for me to get addicted to.

02:56:59.500 --> 02:56:59.900
All right.

02:56:59.900 --> 02:57:00.700
Take care guys.

02:57:02.140 --> 02:57:02.380
Bye.

02:57:03.100 --> 02:57:06.300
Video calls are always fun, even though I can only see like half of each of their head,

02:57:06.300 --> 02:57:07.580
but it worked.

02:57:07.580 --> 02:57:08.080
All right.

02:57:09.020 --> 02:57:10.860
Uh, one eight seven seven game.

02:57:10.860 --> 02:57:13.100
All our username on Skype is orange lounge radio.

02:57:13.100 --> 02:57:13.500
What do you say?

02:57:13.500 --> 02:57:15.100
It's like, Hey, can we try to fit in one more call?

02:57:15.100 --> 02:57:15.500
Yeah.

02:57:15.500 --> 02:57:18.380
Someone new needs to call someone new.

02:57:18.380 --> 02:57:19.420
Someone new.

02:57:19.420 --> 02:57:19.740
We'll see.

02:57:19.740 --> 02:57:21.740
We'll see what happens when I challenge you.

02:57:22.620 --> 02:57:23.500
All right.

02:57:23.500 --> 02:57:25.580
Listeners of OLR be somebody new.

02:57:25.580 --> 02:57:26.140
Be quick.

02:57:26.140 --> 02:57:27.820
Cause there's been a lot of people trying to get through.

02:57:27.820 --> 02:57:29.900
That's why I'm going to allow one more call to squeeze in here.

02:57:30.380 --> 02:57:31.100
Uh, let's see.

02:57:31.100 --> 02:57:34.860
Oh, I was going to read the tiger claw tweet that said Nintendo defends the rapid release

02:57:34.860 --> 02:57:36.380
of new Mario games.

02:57:36.380 --> 02:57:43.020
Um, quote, who's this quote from Nintendo of America, senior director of corporate communications,

02:57:43.020 --> 02:57:43.580
Mario game.

02:57:43.580 --> 02:57:47.740
Uh, we think we're putting out the right number of Mario games based on what fans are asking

02:57:47.740 --> 02:57:51.020
for based on what our own developers, creative visions are.

02:57:51.020 --> 02:57:54.460
The key to that is as long as there's innovation occurring within the gameplay, as long as

02:57:54.460 --> 02:57:58.300
there's new features, then marrying the characters and the IPs that people love is the right

02:57:58.300 --> 02:57:59.740
call from our standpoint.

02:57:59.820 --> 02:58:01.580
But the phone is ringing again, so let's go to it.

02:58:01.580 --> 02:58:01.740
Hi.

02:58:01.740 --> 02:58:02.620
You're on orange launch radio.

02:58:02.620 --> 02:58:03.020
Who's this?

02:58:03.820 --> 02:58:04.940
Uh, name and lights.

02:58:04.940 --> 02:58:06.220
Name and lights.

02:58:06.220 --> 02:58:09.500
Although it's ironic because your icon is just a solid black square.

02:58:10.780 --> 02:58:11.500
It is.

02:58:11.500 --> 02:58:12.860
Well, at least that's, that's what I'm seeing.

02:58:12.860 --> 02:58:13.100
I don't know.

02:58:13.100 --> 02:58:15.820
Maybe it's not supposed to be, but yeah, I do not see your name in lights.

02:58:15.820 --> 02:58:16.700
That's supposed to be.

02:58:16.700 --> 02:58:17.420
Oh, oops.

02:58:17.420 --> 02:58:17.820
So well.

02:58:17.820 --> 02:58:17.980
All right.

02:58:17.980 --> 02:58:18.780
Well, what's on your mind?

02:58:20.220 --> 02:58:22.540
This is the first time I've listened to the show live.

02:58:23.100 --> 02:58:25.980
Well, I was going to say, I recognize your name, but I don't think you've ever called

02:58:25.980 --> 02:58:26.780
well, dark soccer.

02:58:26.780 --> 02:58:27.100
There you go.

02:58:27.100 --> 02:58:28.060
You got your new person.

02:58:28.060 --> 02:58:28.700
Yay.

02:58:28.700 --> 02:58:29.180
All right.

02:58:29.660 --> 02:58:30.540
Thank you.

02:58:30.540 --> 02:58:31.740
Well, uh, what do you think?

02:58:33.180 --> 02:58:33.980
Uh, interesting.

02:58:34.620 --> 02:58:34.860
Okay.

02:58:35.420 --> 02:58:38.860
I've been, I've been listening to the, uh, uh, orange loans for years.

02:58:38.860 --> 02:58:42.940
Oh, well, and you, you just now were able to make it to a live show?

02:58:42.940 --> 02:58:44.220
Usually busy on Sunday nights?

02:58:44.700 --> 02:58:46.300
Uh, normally I'm sleeping.

02:58:46.300 --> 02:58:47.660
This is flipping late for me.

02:58:47.660 --> 02:58:48.460
Oh my gosh.

02:58:48.460 --> 02:58:49.260
We have a lot of people.

02:58:49.260 --> 02:58:51.100
Code man said earlier, he was staying up late.

02:58:51.100 --> 02:58:55.580
I guess a lot of people maybe for the 4th of July week kind of have a lot less going

02:58:55.580 --> 02:58:55.740
on.

02:58:55.740 --> 02:58:56.140
I don't know.

02:58:56.700 --> 02:59:00.060
You may remember me from a couple of the messages I sent you privately.

02:59:00.780 --> 02:59:01.340
Perhaps.

02:59:02.540 --> 02:59:03.900
My wife passed away.

02:59:03.900 --> 02:59:06.060
Yes, yes, yes I do.

02:59:06.060 --> 02:59:06.460
I do.

02:59:06.460 --> 02:59:06.860
Of course.

02:59:06.860 --> 02:59:09.660
I recognize that and I'm very sorry to hear that.

02:59:09.660 --> 02:59:11.020
Yeah, we're Facebook buddies too.

02:59:11.020 --> 02:59:12.220
Yeah, we're all Facebook friends.

02:59:12.220 --> 02:59:12.540
Yeah.

02:59:12.540 --> 02:59:12.700
Yeah.

02:59:13.260 --> 02:59:16.860
So well, I just got back in the gaming again.

02:59:16.860 --> 02:59:17.660
Yeah.

02:59:17.660 --> 02:59:18.540
What have you been playing?

02:59:20.060 --> 02:59:20.620
Warcraft.

02:59:21.820 --> 02:59:24.460
Like, like old school Warcraft or World of Warcraft?

02:59:24.460 --> 02:59:25.100
World of Warcraft.

02:59:25.100 --> 02:59:25.820
World of Warcraft.

02:59:25.900 --> 02:59:27.340
I'm in the Hoard House Guild.

02:59:27.340 --> 02:59:27.660
Yeah, yeah.

02:59:27.660 --> 02:59:29.900
No, I knew you were over there in the Hoard House Guild.

02:59:29.900 --> 02:59:33.740
Thank you for being loyal to the Hoard House Guild because unfortunately a lot of people

02:59:33.740 --> 02:59:38.220
have quit WoW for things like Final Fantasy XIV or League or whatever it is.

02:59:38.220 --> 02:59:39.100
For real life.

02:59:39.100 --> 02:59:41.340
I mean, I was off a month.

02:59:41.340 --> 02:59:41.980
Yeah.

02:59:41.980 --> 02:59:43.740
Well, understandably so, but.

02:59:43.740 --> 02:59:46.940
I was actually sort of thinking about rebuilding my subscription except that.

02:59:47.580 --> 02:59:48.700
Now you have Animal Crossing.

02:59:48.700 --> 02:59:49.740
I have Animal Crossing.

02:59:49.740 --> 02:59:50.060
Yeah.

02:59:50.060 --> 02:59:51.740
What do you like to do in World of Warcraft?

02:59:53.100 --> 02:59:55.500
Right now I'm leveling a new monk.

02:59:55.500 --> 02:59:55.820
Nice.

02:59:57.340 --> 03:00:00.780
I deleted the monk that I was, because my wife used to play.

03:00:01.980 --> 03:00:06.060
And she wanted to play, but when she had the stroke, she couldn't see.

03:00:07.820 --> 03:00:17.900
So I spent three solid weeks farming for the Vial of the Sands so I could fly her around.

03:00:19.500 --> 03:00:22.940
And it literally took me forever.

03:00:22.940 --> 03:00:27.580
Yeah, those things were a pain in the ass to get, but they're great for being able to.

03:00:27.580 --> 03:00:27.740
Yeah.

03:00:28.460 --> 03:00:31.980
And for those that don't know, because not everybody speaks Warcraft, the Vial of the

03:00:31.980 --> 03:00:37.180
Sands is a mount that you can basically turn yourself into a dragon, but another player

03:00:37.180 --> 03:00:40.300
can ride on your back to get your minds out of the gutter people.

03:00:40.300 --> 03:00:43.260
They can ride on your back and you can fly them to places.

03:00:43.260 --> 03:00:43.980
So it's really great.

03:00:43.980 --> 03:00:47.900
It's like if you have a low level character, you're like, Oh, you need to get to Thunder

03:00:47.900 --> 03:00:50.460
Bluff or a town that might be far for you to walk to.

03:00:50.460 --> 03:00:51.260
Get on my back.

03:00:51.260 --> 03:00:51.580
Let's go.

03:00:51.580 --> 03:00:57.580
And it was 300 flying too, so if you had a lower level character, you could still take

03:00:57.580 --> 03:00:58.940
him at what, epic speed, right?

03:00:58.940 --> 03:01:00.060
Yeah, you could.

03:01:00.780 --> 03:01:08.620
Yeah, so when I was off for five weeks taking care of her after the stroke, I upped my Warcraft

03:01:08.620 --> 03:01:13.820
and the only thing I did was farm archaeology to get the recipe.

03:01:14.860 --> 03:01:19.340
And she passed away three days after I got it.

03:01:19.820 --> 03:01:20.620
Hmm.

03:01:20.620 --> 03:01:22.140
But at least you got it.

03:01:23.420 --> 03:01:23.900
Yeah, I did.

03:01:23.900 --> 03:01:27.900
But I never had a chance for her to use it.

03:01:27.900 --> 03:01:28.860
I'm sorry to hear that.

03:01:30.140 --> 03:01:31.580
So I pretty much stopped.

03:01:31.580 --> 03:01:31.900
Wow.

03:01:31.900 --> 03:01:37.580
I deleted the monk that I leveled with her and it was tough to get back in.

03:01:38.300 --> 03:01:38.540
Yeah.

03:01:41.100 --> 03:01:46.460
Has getting in, I hate to dwell on what might be a difficult topic, but has this been a

03:01:46.540 --> 03:01:53.420
way for you to kind of help get back into after such a tragedy as video games kind of

03:01:53.420 --> 03:01:58.220
helped you a little bit in getting back into what might have been your routine before?

03:01:59.980 --> 03:02:08.940
It took a while to get back into it because I was trying to play after she passed away,

03:02:08.940 --> 03:02:13.820
but I just couldn't play more than a few minutes without getting irritatedly bored and just

03:02:13.820 --> 03:02:14.780
shutting it off.

03:02:14.780 --> 03:02:15.020
Yeah.

03:02:15.580 --> 03:02:18.860
So I didn't up my account until very recently.

03:02:21.020 --> 03:02:23.660
And I named a character after her.

03:02:24.620 --> 03:02:27.580
It's a great way to memorialize somebody.

03:02:27.580 --> 03:02:29.500
I know of other people that have done that in WoW.

03:02:29.500 --> 03:02:30.220
Absolutely.

03:02:30.220 --> 03:02:35.100
And I know that even the developers, you know, when people that they were close to that were

03:02:35.100 --> 03:02:38.940
involved in the game, they've immortalized them in the game too.

03:02:38.940 --> 03:02:39.260
Yes.

03:02:39.260 --> 03:02:41.740
There's some really great memorial.

03:02:42.060 --> 03:02:47.100
Usually this is more for people that were really part of the WoW community and heavy

03:02:47.100 --> 03:02:51.420
raiders and stuff, but they have set up tributes.

03:02:51.420 --> 03:02:53.260
Blizzard has kind of done that in the game.

03:02:53.260 --> 03:02:56.780
And there's some really great compilations out there on YouTube.

03:02:56.780 --> 03:03:03.180
I know somebody that had this for somebody that they were married to.

03:03:03.180 --> 03:03:08.140
And yeah, really great when the companies kind of do that.

03:03:08.220 --> 03:03:14.060
I mean, it just really emphasizes the community that an MMO game and what really makes those

03:03:14.060 --> 03:03:15.980
games great is the community.

03:03:15.980 --> 03:03:19.820
So yeah, it's been hard.

03:03:19.820 --> 03:03:24.540
This has been the last couple of months have been ridiculously hard.

03:03:24.540 --> 03:03:24.780
Right.

03:03:25.900 --> 03:03:26.300
Of course.

03:03:27.260 --> 03:03:32.620
I'm not even going to sit here and try to imagine, but you know, you got friends here

03:03:32.620 --> 03:03:38.860
at OLR and at the voice against network and in out there on in Facebook land and on the

03:03:38.860 --> 03:03:41.980
internet that are trying to help you through it.

03:03:41.980 --> 03:03:46.060
I hope it's getting a little better every day.

03:03:47.340 --> 03:03:48.140
Except for today.

03:03:48.700 --> 03:03:51.100
Oh, I got my eviction notice today.

03:03:51.100 --> 03:03:51.740
Oh, my God.

03:03:55.180 --> 03:03:56.140
I don't know what to say.

03:03:57.500 --> 03:03:58.220
Yeah.

03:03:58.220 --> 03:03:58.540
Yeah.

03:03:59.340 --> 03:04:01.580
I probably should start a support group.

03:04:01.660 --> 03:04:02.940
Well, but I don't know.

03:04:02.940 --> 03:04:03.100
Yeah.

03:04:04.300 --> 03:04:06.940
I need bad news to stop happening to our listeners.

03:04:06.940 --> 03:04:09.020
This is this is this is bad.

03:04:11.100 --> 03:04:17.820
Gosh, I don't know what we can do to help, but I knew this was coming.

03:04:17.820 --> 03:04:21.180
I knew when she passed away, I wasn't going to be able to afford the house that we have.

03:04:21.180 --> 03:04:25.980
So what goes around comes around.

03:04:25.980 --> 03:04:27.740
So I got the eviction notice.

03:04:27.740 --> 03:04:28.460
It opened a beer.

03:04:28.460 --> 03:04:32.220
When in doubt, when in doubt, why not?

03:04:32.780 --> 03:04:33.820
All right, buddy.

03:04:33.820 --> 03:04:35.020
Well, we're all thinking of you.

03:04:35.020 --> 03:04:37.660
And good luck pulling through, pulling through, you know.

03:04:38.860 --> 03:04:40.220
I mean, I love the show.

03:04:40.220 --> 03:04:41.180
I love listening.

03:04:41.180 --> 03:04:43.260
I love I love Hoard House.

03:04:44.140 --> 03:04:45.660
I'm I'm an avid listener.

03:04:45.660 --> 03:04:48.220
This is the first time I've actually had a chance to be up this late.

03:04:49.260 --> 03:04:51.980
My buddy was helping me pack up some stuff tonight.

03:04:51.980 --> 03:04:53.820
It's the only reason why I'm still up.

03:04:53.820 --> 03:04:54.060
Sure.

03:04:54.700 --> 03:04:55.500
He took off.

03:04:55.740 --> 03:04:59.020
I just decided to turn the show on.

03:04:59.020 --> 03:05:03.500
You know, I know you guys, you know, usually end around twelve, one o'clock Eastern time

03:05:03.500 --> 03:05:04.940
because I am on the East Coast.

03:05:06.140 --> 03:05:09.820
But, you know, I listen to you guys on a regular basis for years now.

03:05:09.820 --> 03:05:11.900
I just never have a chance to listen live.

03:05:11.900 --> 03:05:13.900
Well, I'm glad you could make it out tonight.

03:05:13.900 --> 03:05:16.060
I just wish the circumstances have been a little better.

03:05:16.060 --> 03:05:18.940
But, you know, you can send me a message anytime on Facebook.

03:05:18.940 --> 03:05:24.060
Not not to be one of those like like super hippie mega happy people.

03:05:24.060 --> 03:05:29.420
But, you know, I do believe very much so that when when one door closes, another opens,

03:05:29.420 --> 03:05:33.100
like when I was laid off from my job several years ago, it was like the end of the world

03:05:33.100 --> 03:05:35.500
to me and I was worried about a lot of things.

03:05:35.500 --> 03:05:39.820
But I ended up getting a career I've been at for 12 years now since then.

03:05:39.820 --> 03:05:47.180
I mean, I mean, I mean, not to get all preachy and everything when she was happiest ever

03:05:47.180 --> 03:05:47.900
as a teacher.

03:05:49.420 --> 03:05:53.900
She was teaching CNAs, which is certified nursing assistants.

03:05:54.380 --> 03:05:55.740
She loved her job.

03:05:56.380 --> 03:05:57.500
She was an RN.

03:05:58.860 --> 03:06:02.140
You know, she was two credits away from being a bachelor's.

03:06:02.940 --> 03:06:09.100
And, you know, when she lost that job because they changed the qualifications for the job,

03:06:09.100 --> 03:06:12.540
I just simply told her that it's like, you know what, I'll support you.

03:06:12.540 --> 03:06:13.740
I'll do whatever it takes.

03:06:14.700 --> 03:06:18.540
Just, you know, go back to school, get your education

03:06:18.540 --> 03:06:21.580
and get more education than the person that just fired you.

03:06:24.220 --> 03:06:25.660
And that's what she was going to do.

03:06:26.540 --> 03:06:27.020
She was...

03:06:30.220 --> 03:06:31.340
Sorry, but...

03:06:31.340 --> 03:06:32.460
No, I understand.

03:06:35.660 --> 03:06:36.620
Cinco de Mayo.

03:06:39.340 --> 03:06:40.780
She wanted to go back to the school.

03:06:43.500 --> 03:06:46.140
Well, you're getting a lot of support from our chat room right now.

03:06:46.140 --> 03:06:48.620
You know, act deaf saying if there's anything we can help you out with,

03:06:48.620 --> 03:06:50.300
the VOG community is there to help you.

03:06:51.100 --> 03:06:53.420
E-hugs all around from Degenerate Johnny.

03:06:53.420 --> 03:06:59.980
And I know it's really tough.

03:06:59.980 --> 03:07:03.100
She was supposed to start school on the 5th,

03:07:04.220 --> 03:07:10.220
and I told her that the module wasn't going to open up on the 5th because it was a holiday.

03:07:13.980 --> 03:07:18.460
She went to school on Monday and passed away on Tuesday.

03:07:20.300 --> 03:07:32.220
Well, you're getting the world's biggest hug from our chat room right now for this,

03:07:32.220 --> 03:07:33.660
you know, all over the place.

03:07:33.660 --> 03:07:41.260
But how great that you were helping her to achieve this and, you know,

03:07:41.260 --> 03:07:43.420
come out of the circumstance better.

03:07:43.420 --> 03:07:47.180
And I know wherever she is right now, she's thanking you big time for it.

03:07:48.140 --> 03:07:51.500
So getting a lot of really horrible two months.

03:07:52.140 --> 03:07:52.940
I know.

03:07:52.940 --> 03:07:54.940
I bet I was glad May was over with.

03:07:54.940 --> 03:07:57.420
But June is just June's gone.

03:07:57.980 --> 03:07:59.100
It is June.

03:07:59.100 --> 03:08:01.180
Oh, it is July, isn't it?

03:08:02.460 --> 03:08:03.180
Tomorrow.

03:08:03.180 --> 03:08:04.540
Well, today for East Coast.

03:08:05.100 --> 03:08:09.260
Yeah, it's just she went back to school one day.

03:08:13.580 --> 03:08:15.740
But you helped her get back to school.

03:08:15.740 --> 03:08:16.140
You did.

03:08:17.420 --> 03:08:19.820
Well, all she wanted to do was become a teacher.

03:08:21.820 --> 03:08:22.620
And you know what?

03:08:22.620 --> 03:08:26.700
My mom was a teacher, so it's a great profession.

03:08:26.700 --> 03:08:27.980
I'm actually a corporate trainer.

03:08:27.980 --> 03:08:29.420
It's a great profession.

03:08:29.420 --> 03:08:30.780
It's an admirable thing.

03:08:30.780 --> 03:08:32.060
I love my job.

03:08:32.060 --> 03:08:32.560
Absolutely.

03:08:34.140 --> 03:08:35.980
Well, I'm going to let you go.

03:08:35.980 --> 03:08:36.480
Sure.

03:08:36.860 --> 03:08:37.180
All right.

03:08:38.140 --> 03:08:46.700
I'll try to listen again live again when the dust settles and I'll stay in touch.

03:08:46.700 --> 03:08:46.940
All right.

03:08:46.940 --> 03:08:48.940
Please do stay on Facebook.

03:08:48.940 --> 03:08:49.500
I will.

03:08:49.500 --> 03:08:49.900
Okay.

03:08:49.900 --> 03:08:50.220
All right.

03:08:50.220 --> 03:08:50.780
You take care.

03:08:50.780 --> 03:08:51.500
We're all thinking of you.

03:08:51.500 --> 03:08:51.900
All right.

03:08:51.900 --> 03:08:52.380
Bye bye.

03:08:52.380 --> 03:08:52.880
Bye.

03:08:53.820 --> 03:08:54.620
Oh, how's that?

03:08:55.900 --> 03:08:56.780
Tough call.

03:08:56.780 --> 03:08:58.540
I need someone to cut.

03:08:59.340 --> 03:08:59.980
Quick, Loki.

03:08:59.980 --> 03:09:01.020
I need a fart joke.

03:09:01.020 --> 03:09:02.700
Quick, help me.

03:09:03.820 --> 03:09:04.220
You know what?

03:09:04.220 --> 03:09:04.940
Know what?

03:09:04.940 --> 03:09:08.140
I have happy, happy because look at the chat room.

03:09:08.140 --> 03:09:09.580
I mean, yeah, for real.

03:09:09.580 --> 03:09:10.540
Seriously, for real.

03:09:10.540 --> 03:09:15.340
And you know, there's even I'm sure a lot of people are like, wow, that was a heavy call.

03:09:15.340 --> 03:09:16.540
And yes, it was a heavy call.

03:09:16.540 --> 03:09:20.620
But when we say when we say we're there for people, we kind of like mean it and shit.

03:09:20.620 --> 03:09:21.120
So.

03:09:21.580 --> 03:09:27.580
And the biggest thing that me that I like to do for people is I like to find if there's

03:09:27.580 --> 03:09:32.700
a tough situation, I like to find research, everything that has to do with it and offer

03:09:32.700 --> 03:09:37.900
options because especially when you're in the middle of a situation, there's not always

03:09:37.900 --> 03:09:40.540
things that occur to you when you're in that situation.

03:09:41.180 --> 03:09:46.220
And like when Dan and I were, you know, you because, you know, when we got our notice

03:09:46.220 --> 03:09:53.900
for the house that we were staying in rent free, we had to move like in a week and it

03:09:53.900 --> 03:09:57.580
was people helping us and giving us options that opened the door for us, too.

03:09:57.580 --> 03:10:05.020
So, yeah, any if you need to bounce any ideas, if you need just someone outside the situation

03:10:05.020 --> 03:10:07.580
to help you see it clearly, let me know.

03:10:07.580 --> 03:10:08.220
I'm happy to help.

03:10:08.700 --> 03:10:09.820
I'm getting a little verklempt.

03:10:09.820 --> 03:10:11.900
I have to admit it's not just the call.

03:10:11.900 --> 03:10:16.220
I mean, but just just everything I'm seeing in chat right now is just amazing for Bobby

03:10:16.220 --> 03:10:17.980
to be, you know, something.

03:10:17.980 --> 03:10:18.480
Yeah.

03:10:19.660 --> 03:10:20.780
There was a big net split.

03:10:20.780 --> 03:10:23.020
So we just lost like a quarter of the chat room, unfortunately.

03:10:23.020 --> 03:10:24.860
But, you know, yay, tech issues.

03:10:25.420 --> 03:10:25.920
Hooray.

03:10:27.100 --> 03:10:28.700
But what was I gonna say with that?

03:10:29.420 --> 03:10:30.860
My train of thought is derailing.

03:10:31.260 --> 03:10:39.340
This was going to say is that earlier you had that story about the kid who said the

03:10:39.340 --> 03:10:41.260
stupid thing on the Internet and ended up in jail.

03:10:41.260 --> 03:10:44.300
And we have a lot of these words going around the Internet sometime.

03:10:44.300 --> 03:10:46.860
And I would never expect this of people listening to the show.

03:10:46.860 --> 03:10:51.580
But I think one thing we need to keep in mind is that, you know, some people are playing

03:10:51.580 --> 03:10:57.260
video games to kind of escape reality, such as the very difficult thing that he just shared

03:10:57.260 --> 03:11:01.580
with us, which is not an easy thing to get on some radio show and talk about what happened.

03:11:01.580 --> 03:11:05.020
So, you know, I commend him for being able to do that and keeping it together even as

03:11:05.020 --> 03:11:05.660
much as he did.

03:11:06.540 --> 03:11:10.780
But you never know who's going to be on the other end of that game you're playing in that

03:11:10.780 --> 03:11:13.020
MMO or on that Xbox Live.

03:11:13.020 --> 03:11:16.940
So, you know, have a little decency for each other.

03:11:16.940 --> 03:11:19.020
And, you know, anyway.

03:11:20.620 --> 03:11:22.860
Just think, do you want it being said to you?

03:11:22.860 --> 03:11:25.420
And even more, do you want it being said to someone you care about?

03:11:26.140 --> 03:11:29.980
So, because there's people who can take it, but they don't take it when it's somebody

03:11:29.980 --> 03:11:31.340
that they care about.

03:11:31.340 --> 03:11:33.420
So, yeah, just think about it that way.

03:11:33.980 --> 03:11:34.380
All right.

03:11:35.500 --> 03:11:40.300
Well, anyhow, do we have any other last minute stories to try and transition us back onto

03:11:41.100 --> 03:11:42.940
the video game news we were talking about earlier?

03:11:42.940 --> 03:11:46.860
I think, oh, yeah, I got through the Twitter topic, which was the only one that we got.

03:11:47.500 --> 03:11:54.540
But they're selling an Earthbound Zero reproduction NES cart.

03:11:56.380 --> 03:12:02.460
It's an English translated ROM of, you know, the game Mother.

03:12:03.020 --> 03:12:06.140
And, of course, it never came out over here.

03:12:06.140 --> 03:12:11.580
And I guess it's been, I don't know who's doing the reproduction of it or if it even

03:12:11.580 --> 03:12:11.980
works.

03:12:13.580 --> 03:12:17.260
Wasn't that the one that had the piracy enabled, though, that would let the piracy of the

03:12:17.260 --> 03:12:19.580
anti-piracy thing that would like that was shut down the game?

03:12:21.660 --> 03:12:23.180
Yeah, no, I know that would get harder.

03:12:23.260 --> 03:12:27.340
But I thought Earthbound Zero even had the prototype ROM was infamous for having these

03:12:27.340 --> 03:12:28.380
game breaking bugs in it.

03:12:28.380 --> 03:12:29.980
But maybe the hackers fix that.

03:12:29.980 --> 03:12:30.620
I don't remember.

03:12:30.620 --> 03:12:31.500
It's been so long.

03:12:31.500 --> 03:12:32.540
Hackers gonna hack.

03:12:32.540 --> 03:12:35.420
It seems like it was so long ago that that all.

03:12:37.740 --> 03:12:41.580
Yeah, I'm not sure if it actually does anything or if it's just a reproduction of the original.

03:12:42.460 --> 03:12:44.380
I don't know what to say.

03:12:44.380 --> 03:12:47.740
I never played Mother, but I always heard it was kind of a glitchy game to begin with,

03:12:47.740 --> 03:12:49.180
like actual version.

03:12:49.900 --> 03:12:52.380
Like, you mean the Earthbound that was on the SNES here?

03:12:53.340 --> 03:12:57.660
Mother, Mother, I think because it wasn't finished, it was still glitchy.

03:12:57.660 --> 03:12:59.420
Yes, absolutely.

03:13:00.140 --> 03:13:00.540
All right.

03:13:01.500 --> 03:13:03.500
Well, that does it for the Skype line tonight.

03:13:03.500 --> 03:13:04.780
That does it for our Twitter topics.

03:13:04.780 --> 03:13:09.740
I think that did it for the last minute stories as well, unless you have anything else to

03:13:09.740 --> 03:13:10.620
surprise me with over there.

03:13:11.500 --> 03:13:13.980
No, I know.

03:13:14.780 --> 03:13:15.420
Okay.

03:13:15.420 --> 03:13:17.020
I love all the Hello Kitty everywhere.

03:13:17.980 --> 03:13:20.220
Yeah, you can thank Slidekick for some of that.

03:13:20.780 --> 03:13:22.540
Slidekick, I want to thank you for being here.

03:13:22.540 --> 03:13:24.300
Thank you so much for having me.

03:13:24.300 --> 03:13:28.220
You know, I've been listening for years and I'm so glad that I finally was able to come

03:13:28.220 --> 03:13:29.740
up and get on the show.

03:13:29.740 --> 03:13:30.380
11 years.

03:13:30.380 --> 03:13:34.700
You really and you really got to run the gauntlet of an OLR show tonight from the Dick and Fart

03:13:34.700 --> 03:13:36.540
jokes and the stuff at the beginning.

03:13:36.540 --> 03:13:38.380
It's just some real heavy stuff there at the end.

03:13:38.380 --> 03:13:42.300
So it's like you got a whole two years worth of OLR emotions in one show.

03:13:42.300 --> 03:13:43.340
So congratulations.

03:13:43.340 --> 03:13:44.700
Every gamer has their voice here.

03:13:44.700 --> 03:13:45.820
So thank you.

03:13:45.820 --> 03:13:47.340
Yes, that's what we strive for.

03:13:47.340 --> 03:13:49.340
So best of luck with your project.

03:13:49.340 --> 03:13:50.060
Congratulations.

03:13:50.060 --> 03:13:51.900
You've made it a year on gamebuoy.org.

03:13:51.900 --> 03:13:52.400
Thank you.

03:13:53.020 --> 03:13:56.860
And I look forward to sharing the stage with you at GamerX.

03:13:56.860 --> 03:13:57.820
It'll be a lot of fun.

03:13:57.820 --> 03:13:58.940
And it'll be my honor.

03:13:58.940 --> 03:14:00.060
Everybody else.

03:14:00.060 --> 03:14:01.020
Aw, shucks.

03:14:01.020 --> 03:14:02.060
One more time with the plugs.

03:14:02.060 --> 03:14:03.340
How can they find your fine show?

03:14:03.340 --> 03:14:08.060
We're over at gamebuoy.org and you can find all our social links over there.

03:14:08.060 --> 03:14:09.740
You can find us on iTunes.

03:14:09.740 --> 03:14:10.860
It's game and buoy.

03:14:10.860 --> 03:14:12.380
B-U-O-Y.

03:14:12.380 --> 03:14:19.260
And I relinked your website on my Tumblr post.

03:14:20.140 --> 03:14:22.220
When I did my pitch of the show today.

03:14:22.940 --> 03:14:24.700
So you can also find it there.

03:14:25.580 --> 03:14:26.540
We love OLR.

03:14:26.540 --> 03:14:28.300
We love all our OLR listeners.

03:14:28.300 --> 03:14:31.340
You know, we're usually in chat when OLR is going on.

03:14:31.340 --> 03:14:34.460
So if you haven't checked us out yet, we'd love to hear from you.

03:14:34.460 --> 03:14:36.780
And hope you enjoy what you hear.

03:14:36.780 --> 03:14:39.820
We love indie podcasts, period.

03:14:39.820 --> 03:14:44.940
I mean, I don't want to sound shady or anything, but do you think some of the corporate

03:14:44.940 --> 03:14:47.500
cast out there could have done some of these calls we did tonight?

03:14:47.500 --> 03:14:48.000
No.

03:14:48.880 --> 03:14:51.280
You know, I have to do that's the difference, y'all.

03:14:51.280 --> 03:14:52.480
That's the difference.

03:14:52.480 --> 03:14:57.200
We might have to get Alan in here because Tim TRP in chat says we demand a fabulous

03:14:57.200 --> 03:14:58.400
Flames reunion show.

03:14:58.400 --> 03:14:59.120
Where's Alan?

03:14:59.920 --> 03:15:01.680
Oh, I think he ran outside or something.

03:15:02.320 --> 03:15:02.720
Damn.

03:15:02.720 --> 03:15:02.960
All right.

03:15:02.960 --> 03:15:03.520
I mean, the heat.

03:15:04.160 --> 03:15:04.640
Yeah, maybe.

03:15:04.640 --> 03:15:07.200
Maybe he's trying to figure out how to make it cooler in here.

03:15:07.200 --> 03:15:07.520
All right.

03:15:07.520 --> 03:15:08.240
Well, we do have.

03:15:08.240 --> 03:15:08.880
Here he is.

03:15:08.880 --> 03:15:13.440
Oh, Alan, when's the fabulous Flames reunion show, which definitely look that up on iTunes,

03:15:13.440 --> 03:15:13.940
y'all.

03:15:13.940 --> 03:15:19.300
It's one week after I'm in, I win $50 billion in the lottery.

03:15:20.260 --> 03:15:21.300
We're going to win the lottery.

03:15:21.300 --> 03:15:21.800
Yay.

03:15:23.540 --> 03:15:24.040
All right.

03:15:24.660 --> 03:15:25.220
That's it.

03:15:25.220 --> 03:15:28.420
Alan, did you have a final thought for the listeners tonight before you run out?

03:15:29.300 --> 03:15:33.060
I still think it may actually be a few degrees hotter outside than it is in here.

03:15:33.700 --> 03:15:34.340
Sweet Jesus.

03:15:34.340 --> 03:15:34.900
When am I?

03:15:34.900 --> 03:15:36.580
When did I move to Phoenix?

03:15:36.580 --> 03:15:37.080
All right.

03:15:37.620 --> 03:15:42.100
You know what's happening, by the way, next Sunday for me, we're on the house hunt.

03:15:42.100 --> 03:15:43.140
Oh, good luck.

03:15:43.140 --> 03:15:47.380
Which may also, which may end up being a new dedicated studio.

03:15:47.380 --> 03:15:48.340
That would be nice.

03:15:48.340 --> 03:15:49.300
Not going to complain.

03:15:49.300 --> 03:15:49.940
So.

03:15:49.940 --> 03:15:50.440
All right.

03:15:51.220 --> 03:15:54.580
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts so we can wrap up and head on out of here.

03:15:54.580 --> 03:15:56.020
Again, Slidekick, thank you for being here.

03:15:56.020 --> 03:15:57.940
Do you have an official final thought for our listeners tonight?

03:15:59.140 --> 03:16:00.180
I want a burger.

03:16:01.380 --> 03:16:02.100
Oh my God.

03:16:02.100 --> 03:16:02.580
So do I.

03:16:02.580 --> 03:16:03.460
I'm so hungry.

03:16:03.460 --> 03:16:04.740
Burgers are pretty fucking good.

03:16:04.740 --> 03:16:05.220
I gotta say.

03:16:05.220 --> 03:16:06.740
I'm going to hit the drive-through on my way home.

03:16:06.740 --> 03:16:07.240
All right.

03:16:08.340 --> 03:16:08.900
Get it, girl.

03:16:10.260 --> 03:16:10.420
Yeah.

03:16:10.420 --> 03:16:11.940
You got 30 minutes to get to Pinkberry.

03:16:11.940 --> 03:16:12.420
Ooh, girl.

03:16:12.420 --> 03:16:12.980
All right.

03:16:13.540 --> 03:16:15.140
Loki, uh, you're packing up.

03:16:15.140 --> 03:16:15.860
You're ready to go.

03:16:15.860 --> 03:16:18.900
Good luck with all your, uh, uh, disease and everything.

03:16:18.900 --> 03:16:20.260
Hope you're cured by next week.

03:16:20.980 --> 03:16:24.020
Make sure that you find those rats that gave you the bubonic plague.

03:16:24.900 --> 03:16:25.460
Okay.

03:16:25.460 --> 03:16:25.700
All right.

03:16:25.700 --> 03:16:26.980
At least it's not herpes.

03:16:26.980 --> 03:16:28.660
Uh, your final thought tonight.

03:16:28.660 --> 03:16:29.620
And here's only with weather.

03:16:29.620 --> 03:16:30.120
It's hot.

03:16:32.420 --> 03:16:36.580
My final thought is that if you live in Northern California, you should make plans to come see

03:16:36.580 --> 03:16:40.180
Clue at the Colonial Theater in Sacramento on July 27th.

03:16:40.180 --> 03:16:41.220
I'm playing Colonel Mustard.

03:16:41.220 --> 03:16:41.860
It'll be fun.

03:16:41.860 --> 03:16:42.500
Yes, I do.

03:16:42.580 --> 03:16:43.700
Did you finally find a tie?

03:16:43.700 --> 03:16:44.420
I do others too.

03:16:44.420 --> 03:16:45.300
I ordered one online.

03:16:45.300 --> 03:16:45.620
Yes.

03:16:45.620 --> 03:16:49.140
It's not perfect, but it's, it's, I had to get one that's a little more yellow than his

03:16:49.140 --> 03:16:50.900
in the movie, but he is Colonel Mustard, right?

03:16:50.900 --> 03:16:53.060
And he will be like under the screen.

03:16:53.060 --> 03:16:53.860
Exactly.

03:16:53.860 --> 03:16:54.740
That's what I figure.

03:16:54.740 --> 03:16:59.780
And, and, uh, my director who happens to be the cohost of another show on this network

03:16:59.780 --> 03:17:00.980
is like, you know what?

03:17:01.540 --> 03:17:03.380
I'm at the point where just get it close.

03:17:04.180 --> 03:17:06.580
And I can't, I can't blame her for that.

03:17:06.580 --> 03:17:06.980
All right.

03:17:06.980 --> 03:17:09.780
Um, last but not least, Dark Soccer, your final thoughts tonight?

03:17:10.740 --> 03:17:12.820
I actually have an appetite tonight.

03:17:12.820 --> 03:17:16.580
Like I had French toast this morning and I thought I wouldn't be hungry all day.

03:17:16.580 --> 03:17:17.940
I'm actually hungry right now.

03:17:17.940 --> 03:17:18.660
All right.

03:17:18.660 --> 03:17:20.100
Get some Pinkberry girl.

03:17:20.100 --> 03:17:20.420
All right.

03:17:21.380 --> 03:17:22.420
That's it you guys.

03:17:22.420 --> 03:17:27.460
Thank you very much for listening to Orange Lounge Radio and supporting independent podcasting.

It's much more than just some silly little radio show with a bunch of dick and fart jokes.

03:17:32.340 --> 03:17:34.180
I hope tonight's show proved that for y'all.

03:17:34.180 --> 03:17:36.420
Have a wonderful night and we'll see you next time.
