13960	19282	Tonight, June 2nd, 2013, One Country has a strong statement about the Xbox One.
19602	25904	Blizzard postpones its next MMO, and could legendary buried game cartridges in the desert soon be unearthed?
31874	32695	DarkSakura or Jamie Summers
52987	54988	Can we call this one a go-to-mix instead?
55368	56408	Whatever you want it to be.
56428	58048	Can we have True Kiss Destination?
59009	59289	No.
59689	60409	Club Append!
60449	62009	They weren't that good, let's be real.
62329	64210	Well, if their career didn't last that long.
64570	66090	Dreams Come True lasted longer than them.
66490	67991	Also say hello to Tech Master Loki.
68291	68511	Hi.
68751	69511	Hi, how you doing, Loki?
69671	70051	Pretty good.
70271	70611	Excellent.
70811	80934	And of course, my name is Rob Roberts, and we do join you live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf Show at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
81334	82855	All right, so last week was a little weird.
83135	84976	We weren't actually here live on Sunday.
85336	90818	We did a special show earlier in the week, which we called episode number 506, but then it was brought to my attention.
91598	98721	You're going to ruin all the tracking of the classic game of the week and all these segments you usually do if you give a special episode a regular episode number.
99302	100302	So I broke it.
100322	102083	Just put a blank in there.
102263	104044	How damn hard is that?
104104	104764	Give it a letter.
105144	105804	It's fine.
106144	108105	It's episode R. We'll just have 506.
108185	108745	Second mix.
110166	111587	It's a do-over!
112027	112748	We'll do it live!
113308	116050	Because it's not an episode unless I'm here, let's face it.
116431	118252	So episode two was not an episode?
119273	119973	No, it wasn't.
119993	122855	That was when I was sleeping in the Harry Potter room at the Gay Frat House.
124376	127719	Alright, so last week you were in Alabama, right?
127879	128079	Yes.
128279	130080	And you were taking care of mostly some family stuff.
130420	130601	Yes.
130821	135224	But you did get to hang out with, like, you met at least one OLR listener, right?
135244	135324	Yeah.
135632	142394	I got to hang out with Jammer J, who I have known for quite some time, and there's a little bit of background.
142414	149176	About 10 years ago, we met up and played DDR together, and I got his games, and I think I got him dinner.
149556	156898	So this time he paid for my games and got me dinner, and took me to McGuire's in Pensacola, and I got shit-faced.
157978	165021	I drank, okay, Meguiar's is like a small microbrewery, and they do their own stouts and porters.
165041	170884	I had a good porter, but then they served me this drink called an Irish Wake that's very green and served in a mason jar, and I consumed it.
171384	172985	And I was very dizzy the rest of the ride.
173065	182050	And then I got a sunburn in the shape, well, my tan line is in the shape of a seatbelt because we were riding in a convertible and I stopped caring about the sun.
182430	182670	Okay.
183470	192233	But we did go to Pace, Florida and play a lot of DDR and played some Addams Family Pinball at another arcade at the Pensacola Beach.
193374	201657	And then I spent some time with my mama's son and papa's son and their roommates Kristen and Bobby, a different Bobby, of course.
202637	205158	And I got to see Derek, who is one of my very good friends.
205178	206939	And all these people none of our listeners know.
206959	207579	Yeah.
207979	211901	and my good friend Donovan who, they're both fixtures at DragonCon.
211921	212701	You may run into them.
212761	213101	Okay, alright.
213121	214702	And I got to see my very good friend Jen.
214742	217223	She picked me up when my flight was changed from Gulfport to Mobile.
218043	220464	Do not get me started on American Airlines because fuck them.
220884	222485	I heard about your drama going.
222945	223606	No, fuck them.
223826	225806	I'm on an airplane tomorrow and you got me a little worried.
225947	226967	Are you doing American?
227127	227347	No.
227587	228308	Good, fuck them.
229588	231189	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
257643	259383	I don't care if I can wear it or not.
259604	260924	Is there a hot topic in Alabama?
262384	264105	Well, we had Gadzooks, I think.
264505	268926	But at any rate, I bought a Charlie the Unicorn shirt at a Goodwill in Daphne, Alabama.
269066	269286	Nice.
271559	272760	Shine the non-believer!
291735	295377	If you do get dumped from the stream, just click pause and play again.
295497	299498	If you're at live.vognetwork.com and it should reconnect right away as soon as we come back.
299938	301359	Unfortunately, I don't know what to do about it.
301379	302399	The joys of live radio.
302519	304580	I might have upset the cosmic balance by my sewing.
304800	305300	Possibly.
305360	306540	I'm doing matronly things.
306580	308001	Can you sew the internet back together?
308981	309241	No.
309522	310522	Get a really big needle.
311700	313001	I have really tiny needles.
313721	315482	And I keep poking myself in the thumb.
315522	316402	That's not gonna work.
316642	319604	Alright, so you missed our X-Bone special.
319644	321285	Excuse me, our XB1 special.
321465	322765	All the stuff about the Xbox One.
322945	324586	Did you hear anything about Xbox One?
325006	326147	Yes, and fuck all of it.
327890	328470	Not getting it.
328890	329050	No.
329330	332631	Well, now, wait a minute, DarkSakura, and I think I said this on the show.
332771	334791	Isn't it too early to make up your mind on this?
335212	338372	Right now, going by what I have, fuck them.
338792	339933	And why so strongly?
340013	340633	Why the F-bomb?
340673	345534	Because I don't want to have a microphone and or a camera on all the damn time.
346074	348034	The whole used games thing, fuck them.
348074	349935	The whole downloading games, fuck them even more.
350675	353135	If I'm going to download a game, it's going to be on my PC.
353715	355576	Where, you know, if I buy another PC...
356676	357076	Guess what?
357136	358157	My games will transfer.
358437	367943	Okay, well, to be fair, to play devil's advocate, what's the difference between getting a digital copy on your PC that you can't sell back and a digital... Because I can upgrade my video card.
370224	374227	I can upgrade everything on my PC and make everything look amazing.
374287	379170	So, in a way, you're saying a PC is pretty much guaranteed to be backwards compatible, no matter what.
379830	380511	Pretty much.
381171	385614	Okay, I guess that's fair because the Xbox 360, anything you downloaded... I've been playing Loom.
388133	399865	If I can play Loom, thanks to Steam, if I can play all kinds of old PC games, if I can play text-based games, if I can play Oregon Trail on my PC, I have no problem.
401685	430409	um going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com or of course again we do tape live every Sunday night right after Bobby Blackwolf at 6 Pacific 9 Eastern on Sundays uh Gamer Girl says thank you Dark Sakura clap clap that's exactly why I don't want one either uh Koopa Kid Jeremy says I think it's too early to decide that it's not for you I kind of agree could anything but could anything at E3 end up swaying your mind that's what I'm curious about what if they come out and say the big rumor is Killer Instinct it's gonna be one of the games what if one of these 15 games is like OMG gotta have
430549	431871	What if there's a Homestuck game, Jamie?
431951	432671	What if there's a Homestuck game?
432691	437036	Well, I know for a fact already that I don't think it's... Well, I think it's going to be PC anyway.
437216	441982	What if Mass Effect 4 is an Xbox One exclusive?
442462	442943	It's not.
443724	445446	It's already going to be running on PC.
445506	446247	What if, Jamie?
446327	446727	What if?
447528	449991	I don't know that that would be enough because fuck EA.
450011	450051	Um...
454964	456565	DarkSakura.com
477076	477836	Time to change it!
499949	502170	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
521215	528840	I think that for him it's going to be more of the next Gran Turismo game, of course it's just going to be PS3, but he's going to probably stick Sony.
529260	534623	Especially if they say something that's going to counter all of the crap that Microsoft is saying.
535144	537305	So it's sort of a wait and see kind of thing.
538206	542731	Alright, well I'm going to check in with you again after E3 and see if anything that has happened may have changed your mind.
542791	547476	Oh, and to tell Ragenator about Fuck Activision, I did quit WoW before I went to Alabama.
548096	550439	Now that everybody is reuniting in our guild.
550599	552441	Two people came back to WoW, Jamie.
552521	553142	Two people.
553502	554363	It's not everybody.
554483	559749	Well, we better do like an old raid or something before my account expires.
560069	561230	I thought your account already expired.
561270	562811	No, I've got a couple days left on it.
563372	564372	I'll find out when it expires.
564573	564973	There you go.
565333	567695	And then let me do, like, Ice Crown Citadel.
567715	569617	You should go to Karazhan and get the pets.
570597	571098	I want pets.
571118	572439	There's new pets in Karazhan.
572499	573079	Stop it!
573560	574100	Just saying.
574260	574721	Stop it.
574781	575661	I stopped paying for it.
575882	576822	Wow, crack.
576942	577823	Wow, crack.
578444	581426	I did delete the beta, so that did free up a lot of space.
581486	583728	But then I filled it up with, like, more games on Steam.
585017	585938	Isn't that how it always goes?
586058	586398	Shut up.
586498	588939	I just cleared off 100 gigs from my hard drive.
589319	590480	God damn it, Steam sale.
590560	592161	God damn it, Humble Bundle.
592241	592981	God damn it.
593401	593962	Which is funny.
593982	595563	You don't have to install all of them.
595643	596643	No, I don't have them all installed.
596663	597043	Yes, you do.
597063	597624	I have a bunch.
597744	600105	I actually have the majority of them not installed.
600145	600905	How dare you?
601125	602966	I don't know when I might want to play.
603247	604527	You just never know.
605148	608769	And I can never uninstall something because the minute I uninstall it, what happens?
609690	613292	And TigerClaw, Gran Turismo 6 has already been stated to be for PS3.
615655	639903	Alright, anyhow Keep me strong, tie me to the mast I will hear the song but I shall not succumb This is my finger Well, I've got a needle in my hand This is my finger raised at Activision and Blizzard Sit and spin, motherfuckers Or pay for my account Oh boy Is there anything in gaming you do like this week?
640683	641884	I started playing Mass Effect again
643436	644377	And guess what, Rob?
644417	646298	God, I just can't.
646498	648719	She won't get an Xbox One if it's Mass Effect 4.
649119	649699	Right, exactly.
649799	651160	It totally answers my earlier question.
651220	652401	Totally answers my... Who is she?
652461	653381	Fucking kidding, right?
654162	654882	No!
655002	657283	Oh, I can resist playing another Mass Effect game.
657343	657583	Nope.
657764	658144	Nope.
658164	658744	LOL, nope.
658944	666288	The minute Garrus in HD... There will not be a Garrus in... They already said Mass Effect 4 is a different story.
666468	667188	Okay, here we go.
667248	667749	Here we go, guys.
667769	668109	Here we go.
668249	672510	Okay, this is the first OLR comic strip I need somebody to draw, okay?
672630	677152	You can bite my ass along with Activision and Blizzard and EA.
677352	677733	Here it is.
677813	678153	Here it is.
678373	683955	First panel, DarkSakura holding a microphone saying, I will not buy an Xbox One.
684035	684535	Fuck them.
684595	686016	Fuck them and their stupid asses.
686616	687076	No.
687276	687716	Okay, ready?
687956	698460	Second panel is a picture of the E3 press conference where EA and Microsoft are holding hands on a stage saying, Mass Effect Garrus Edition, Xbox One exclusive.
698860	704601	And then the third panel is DarkSakura walking into a Best Buy with a balloon that says, LOL, nope.
707162	707662	Probably.
707962	708803	LOL, nope.
709203	709823	Okay, okay, okay.
710223	716325	Well, first of all, I'm fairly certain that with a franchise like that, they will not make it an exclusive.
717212	727318	I'm only saying this to get you ruffled and it's working you know what you are about to earn yourself the mother of all girl
728840	729300	Just saying.
731362	737488	And... Okay, this is... To go ahead and put the blanket thing out there, yes, I will get Mass Effect 4.
738288	739750	Because I love the universe.
740110	741411	I don't care how shitty the story is.
741831	743213	I don't care how sparkly the turd is.
743293	743873	I love the turd.
745154	746235	I will buy the sparkly turd.
747557	748718	Because I am a fangirl.
748778	750799	There's her little quote for the next show intro.
750959	751680	I love the turd.
754202	754483	Alright.
755183	755704	You know what?
757759	759100	I have pointy things.
759781	761142	You see all these little pins?
787322	790044	answering your questions as you direct him on the show floor.
790084	794087	It's all explained for you at e3.vognetwork.com.
794567	795187	Check it out.
796889	800751	Let's get into how was your gaming week and we'll talk about the types of video games you've been playing this week.
800851	802092	DarkSakura, why don't you start us off?
802232	803353	Lol, Mass Effect.
803633	804073	Of course.
804194	804594	No, no, no.
804654	805114	Guess what?
805214	809057	I bought Dramamine so that I can do the makeup missions.
809137	809937	God, I'm awful.
811599	813280	I have ginger pills and Dramamine.
814269	816711	You bought drugs so you can play Mass Effect.
816871	817071	Yes.
818632	827459	Because last time I played... Okay, last time I had a nice two-hour session of getting side missions out of the way, and I literally had to stop playing after... Stop it.
827699	829980	Do not YouTube me, Rob.
831141	831522	Rob!
831782	833783	Have you ever played... Don't watch what I'm doing over here.
834043	834584	Keep talking.
835012	847402	So I decided that I didn't want to get motion sick again, so I have plenty of things to keep me from getting sick to my stomach.
847502	850805	Hopefully, just because I get super motion sick, I'll make omissions.
852046	859252	I also downloaded a bunch of high-res, it's called the Ultimate High-Res Mod or something, for...
860493	887494	For the first Mass Effect That has made my game look absolutely freaking gorgeous Like, pretty And so I have been I'm still on the stupid first mission Right after Dumbass gets shot Which we all know who Dumbass is Jenkins, sorry So I am right after that part in my game And it kind of doesn't like all the mods But I don't care Because it makes my game pretty And I play DDR
888474	892417	So again, to clarify, you bought drugs so you could play a drug?
892917	893278	No!
894638	895599	I had the gender on it.
895639	904445	Have you ever played Mass Effect?
905266	905466	No.
908628	912931	And for the record, anyone who's a fan of the first Mass Effect that is interested in this mod, talk to me.
915473	922027	So, I played a lot of DVR, my calves hurt for the next two days, and my skin did.
922087	922788	You gotta stretch.
922808	923470	Oh no, I stretched.
923550	925393	I was freaking doing yoga in an arcade, okay?
926621	937546	But it was very fun, and so if you go to the one and only DDR machine in all of Pace, Florida, and you see D. Sakura Explanation Point, that is me.
938466	939327	On two whole songs.
940727	940907	Two.
941227	941828	And I passed Superstar.
941848	943148	Until they reset the leaderboard at night.
943168	943608	Shut up.
944809	949051	But I was feeling old, so I passed Superstar, and it made me good.
949671	950291	Congrats.
951972	959321	So yeah, I... Oh yeah, I also played a lot of Midway Arcade for tickets on my iPad.
959981	963503	Oh, oh, I was like, like the classic midway games like Joust and stuff.
963523	965404	Yeah, well, yeah, but I was playing pool.
965424	968626	I could not stop playing stupid pool.
968686	970947	If you just want tickets in that game, just play the skee-ball.
971087	974829	You can just, you just go like this, fling, fling, fling, fling, fling, fling, fling, tickets, fling, fling, fling, fling, fling.
974909	977470	You play one game of pool and you get 200 points.
977611	979812	Even if you scratch it on your first one, you still get 75 points.
979872	980852	I didn't know that.
981413	981833	So, yeah.
982573	985015	So, I was like, pool, pool.
985275	987176	I was so mind-numbingly bored.
987856	988476	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1011090	1015551	When I laid down on my grandmother's bed, for a moment I was like, oh, the bed's kind of crooked.
1015651	1016611	And then it was daylight.
1017751	1020392	So my time completely reset while I was there.
1021832	1026253	But still my night owl thing was like, it's 8 o'clock and I'm not out doing stuff.
1026893	1027533	This is not me.
1028134	1029734	So it was very bizarre.
1030034	1033015	So yeah, I played a lot of Midware Kid and Blazing Star.
1034195	1037816	Because I have Blazing Star on my iPad and that game is awesome.
1039276	1039556	The end.
1039997	1040438	The end.
1040958	1041619	Loki, how about you?
1043261	1043642	Let's see.
1043682	1049609	Well, this week I played more Saints Row the Third, just trying to finish up my last few achievements on there.
1050631	1053054	And then also played...
1055000	1055980	A bit of track mania.
1056400	1059061	We tried to do VOG Gaming Night on that.
1059081	1061622	It was weird because I did everything correctly.
1063142	1064502	One person was able to join my game.
1064602	1066283	Everybody else was not able to join my game.
1066583	1069183	And then we decided, hey, let's play on a third-party server.
1069263	1072604	So we just picked a server at random that we were able to connect to.
1073524	1077605	And then it just had the weirdest fucking tracks ever.
1077665	1080586	Just these giant maze tracks everywhere.
1080686	1083047	that were impossible to figure out where the hell you were supposed to go.
1084187	1087729	It was ridiculous, but we had a little bit of fun.
1089069	1100033	And then I played a little bit of Cave Story Plus and a very little bit of Call of Duty because everyone was flaking the entire week.
1101654	1102294	That's pretty much it.
1103674	1104255	My gaming week.
1105155	1114817	Over the Memorial Day weekend, I was staying with Captain Spike and Tim, who were on a previous episode a few weeks ago at their Memorial Day soiree.
1114857	1115837	We played a few video games.
1115917	1124739	I watched them play Trivial Pursuit on the Xbox, which was kind of frustrating how long that game was going on because it's Trivial Pursuit and LOL.
1125499	1151186	and uh we went out to GameStop one day randomly to go find a cheap game to play and we ended up buying Wheel of Fortune I should say Spike ended up buying Wheel of Fortune on the Xbox 360 and many lulls ensued uh what can I say about it I'm like you you know exactly what you're gonna get with a game like Wheel of Fortune because you've seen the game show at some point in your life yes although I have to admit the characters are a little bit derpy and some of the unlocks are a
1152426	1152826	For $20, hey!
1154348	1162196	It provided a little bit of entertainment and some really, really hilarious instances where we were solving puzzles incorrectly and throwing each other off and so forth.
1162556	1163197	So that was fun.
1163957	1166860	As far as other stuff I've been playing during the week, I was keeping it retro.
1167441	1175829	And thanks to some conversations I was having on Twitter with not just Spike, but Jeremy from Koopa Club and some of the other people I talk with on Twitter...
1176269	1184254	I was reminded that Mario 2 came out on Virtual Console for Wii U and I was like, oh, I had that on the Wii so I should just spend the dollar or whatever to upgrade it and play it.
1184614	1187336	And not only did I play it, I played it from start to finish.
1187977	1194841	Granted, I cheated and I used warps, but I used only Luigi the whole way through the game.
1194941	1199564	In my nod to Year of Luigi, I beat Mario 2 using only Luigi.
1199584	1203507	And I'm going to tell you what, those ice stages that you have to play even when you warp,
1204367	1205488	Suck with Luigi.
1205588	1206568	Yes, they do.
1206768	1211670	Because I'm used to using the princess to just float through those little, you know, not the shy guys.
1211690	1213190	What do you call the flying ones with the pitchfork?
1213230	1213811	I don't remember their names.
1213831	1214111	The flurries?
1214331	1216192	No, the flurries are the guys on the ground.
1216232	1218392	Yeah, the little dudes on the ground that look like little jigglypuffs.
1218412	1219873	I don't remember what they're called.
1219893	1220733	I call them bastards.
1220913	1222334	Yeah, they're little fuckers.
1222514	1225315	So the little fuckers are flying in the air and the princess is easy.
1225355	1226496	You just float in between them.
1226876	1229077	But not so easy when you're Luigi.
1229117	1229577	But I did it.
1230317	1230657	I did it.
1231217	1231798	And I beat the game.
1231818	1232298	And that was fun.
1233118	1234799	So yeah, I was keeping it retro this week.
1234880	1246809	I gotta say, there's something about Wii U Virtual Console and I'm totally having to eat my words from what I said earlier on this program about a year ago when I was like, Wii U Virtual Console is gonna be stupid and why would I pay money to upgrade and da-da-da.
1247009	1249831	It's just a better experience and I can't put my finger on it.
1250152	1255236	I don't know if it's the HDMI, I don't know if it's the sound from the tablet and the sound from the speakers at the same time.
1255636	1257718	I don't know, but it is a better experience.
1257938	1259099	So, oops, I was wrong.
1260339	1260860	It happens.
1261400	1264242	So yeah, I was having fun with Mario 2 on Virtual Console.
1264302	1267464	And then I was playing Warcraft because, you know, I'm addicted.
1267724	1272026	Well, I hit 90 with my Hunter, my Blood Elf Hunter, my PvP character.
1272046	1273507	So I've been playing more PvP.
1273647	1276229	If you get sassy to 90... Sassy is 87.
1276369	1277650	In a row?
1277790	1278350	No.
1278650	1283373	When you get sassy to 90, I will redo, I will re-up WoW for one month.
1284774	1285774	Just to play with sassy.
1286375	1287275	Because I like the braids.
1287355	1287596	They float.
1287696	1288116	They float.
1289135	1293479	Jeremy is coaching me in chat, I guess, saying, you warped.
1293880	1294840	I said I warped.
1295801	1301707	My next goal is to do it without warping, but unfortunately I'm on a work trip this week, and then I have all the E3 stuff.
1301907	1303728	Oh, I'm not going to E3, but there's other stuff going on.
1304609	1314178	So it's going to be a little while before I can get through the game without warping, but that's on the list, except for the fact that Animal Crossing comes out Sunday, and then the list will be shot, because yay, Animal Crossing.
1315879	1316140	Alright.
1317183	1320012	It actually comes out on Friday.
1320052	1321416	Yeah, it is Sunday.
1321456	1323503	Last of Us is coming out on Friday.
1323897	1324918	Oh, is it this Friday?
1326279	1327260	Uh, next Friday.
1327960	1329161	Oh, the E3 Friday?
1329481	1329802	Wow.
1330982	1331543	I don't know why.
1331763	1332283	Interesting.
1332544	1334925	Well, I mean, if no other big games are coming out, then why not?
1335246	1337808	Most of America doesn't go to E3, so it doesn't really matter.
1337988	1338968	Why Friday, Street Day?
1338988	1340029	Just put it out on Tuesday.
1340069	1340470	Why not?
1340970	1341871	Just in time for the weekend.
1342191	1344413	Why do movies sometimes open on Wednesday?
1344673	1345613	They just, they do.
1346194	1346454	Rob?
1346634	1346854	What?
1347335	1348996	Do you sometimes just wonder why?
1349116	1350277	Do you ever feel not so fresh?
1350297	1351198	Yeah.
1352952	1355214	First of all, I am incredibly crescent fresh.
1355694	1357716	And second of all, the answer to why?
1358437	1358937	Because.
1362100	1362840	And then deal with it.
1362860	1364461	See if that works with a six-year-old, by the way.
1364481	1365442	With the floating sunglasses.
1365943	1369866	Did you tell the child to deal with it and then have sunglasses land on your face?
1369886	1371267	No, but I'm going to do that next time.
1371287	1371507	You should.
1371547	1373429	That would be hilarious to see Julian's reaction.
1375563	1376544	All right, housekeeping.
1377665	1379648	Visit our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
1379668	1383592	And we are on Facebook as well, facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio and on the Google+.
1384093	1392262	And of course, you want to visit our network, vognetwork.com, home to lots of great geeky podcasts and geeky content, including video game reviews.
1392982	1395886	I know Actdeft just reviewed Dust and Elysian Tale.
1396746	1399587	was on the site this week.
1399667	1403209	And then, of course, as I mentioned before, lots of exciting stuff going on for E3.
1403249	1405970	So check out e3.vognetwork.com.
1406030	1407831	We will be the second site that you check.
1407891	1408251	Not the first.
1408271	1408911	We'll be the second.
1409311	1409871	And that's okay.
1410172	1410912	We're number two.
1411532	1412552	Silver medal for VOG.
1413433	1413813	It'll be great.
1414295	1416678	Xbox One, Xbox One, Xbox One, Xbox One
1431094	1435917	1 billion dollars into putting games on the Xbox One.
1436497	1444161	So I'm assuming a lot of that has to do with the 15 exclusives that they, I guess, paid for and will be coming out the first year.
1446222	1454467	And then didn't really hint at a whole lot of what's coming other than, you know, we know there's a Rare game coming and apparently Black Tusk Studios is working on something.
1454487	1456668	Um...
1459135	1461899	Microsoft Studios is obviously working on stuff.
1461939	1463500	We know that there's going to be a new Forza.
1463941	1467385	Remedy's got that Quantum Break game and EA's got some stuff.
1467745	1472731	Not necessarily exclusive, but features that are somewhat exclusive, I guess.
1473031	1475874	I don't know.
1475915	1477636	They're spending quite a bit of money on that stuff.
1478777	1506376	uh of course you know we're gonna have to figure out what that is and um you know maybe one of these announcements has to do with a bunch of these you know domains that they're registering including domains pertaining to a title called Halo Spartan Assault which doesn't sound like a you know it almost sounds like an arcade game or something like a spin-off so I guess we'll have to wait and see could it be maybe an upgrade or something
1507364	1508625	I'm hoping it's not that.
1508985	1515010	Remember, wasn't there supposed to be like a Kinect-powered game or something like that?
1516071	1518313	Remember, they were doing that with Gears of War, I remember.
1518933	1521315	Maybe it's like a Kinect Halo game or something?
1523477	1523817	I don't know.
1523937	1526959	Joy, I can flail around and choose weapons.
1527180	1529902	Didn't one of the Halo games, like ODST or something, incorporate Kinect?
1530613	1533175	Um, well... Like you could shout grenade and it would throw a grenade?
1533195	1536116	No, that was the Halo Combat Evolved HD thing.
1536216	1537077	Oh yeah, that one.
1537877	1539398	The Combat Evolved Anniversary.
1539658	1541659	They had where you can shout grenade.
1541679	1542640	There was a lot of Halo games.
1542740	1545341	I'm sorry, can you shout grenade faster than you can press a button?
1545542	1545642	No.
1545722	1546842	No, you cannot.
1547783	1551085	And that's assuming that the Kinect hears you and understands what you ask for.
1551165	1554307	It would only be useful as if what you're yelling is, how do I throw a grenade?
1554327	1556148	And it just does it.
1556788	1557428	Oh hey, it worked!
1557729	1558469	How do I throw a grenade?
1559963	1561825	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1578780	1583485	Well, anyway, the German Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information.
1583845	1588109	I did not know such a position existed in Germany, but I guess it makes sense.
1588189	1595216	Certainly, you want to make sure that everything is regulated when it comes to those exchanges, but to a fault.
1596318	1601302	Anyhow, he calls it the Xbox One Connect, a monitoring device.
1601723	1602324	That's because it is.
1603004	1603344	It is.
1604024	1614366	And he goes on to say, under the heading Game Device, this is through a translation that he mentioned with the website Spiegel.de, but this is through a translation.
1614386	1614706	Spiegel.
1615226	1619887	Under the heading Game Device, Microsoft pushes a monitoring device in the market.
1620267	1624128	The Xbox continuously records all sorts of personal information about me.
1624508	1632009	Reaction rates, my learning or emotional states, these are then processed on an external server and possibly even passed on to third parties.
1632530	1635786	Whether they will ever be deleted, the person cannot influence
1637125	1637926	It absolutely is.
1638066	1639046	It's what it is.
1639666	1641387	It's marketing metrics is what it is.
1641648	1645029	They're going to be listening to stuff that you're talking about.
1645290	1647051	And they're going to advertise to you.
1647071	1648311	They're going to target advertising.
1648752	1651973	And it's just like on Facebook where they try to target advertising.
1652113	1656656	But they're going to also make sure that, hey, are you paying attention to those ads?
1657136	1659177	What ads are interesting you?
1659217	1659798	That kind of stuff.
1659838	1661239	So they're going into greater detail.
1661319	1663480	And that information is worth a ton.
1663840	1664180	DarkSakura.com
1685485	1686987	Microsoft is a leader in the world of privacy.
1703727	1706329	We aren't using Kinect to snoop on anybody at all.
1706649	1720338	We listen for the word Xbox on, then switch on the machine, but we don't transmit personal data in any way, shape, or form that could be personally identifiable to you unless you explicitly opt into that.
1721038	1723419	What's interesting about that is that basically he's saying it is there.
1724240	1725881	You just have to opt into it, right?
1726101	1729623	And I remember their excuse was, well, but you can turn the console off.
1729783	1732585	You can power the console off and unplug it.
1733703	1734284	That's stupid.
1734444	1737606	So it sounds to me like Microsoft is going to have to really clarify this.
1737646	1739368	And it's a valid concern about this.
1739408	1746073	You know, when I got into this last week is that I don't want no Xbox filming me when I'm running around in my underwear trying to get coffee in the morning or whatever.
1746453	1747374	You know, I don't need that.
1747594	1748535	You know, who knows?
1748875	1756041	Who knows what might be said when I yell to Alan in the other room and suddenly I'm calling DarkSakura on Kinect and things are awkward.
1756481	1757162	You know what I mean?
1759023	1762106	All I got to say is you're going to be getting a lot of targeted Pinkberry advertisements.
1762246	1762326	Yeah.
1763843	1764784	and Keurig.
1766064	1767825	Pinkberry and Keurig.
1768746	1771027	I'll be there with you except for the Keurig part.
1771067	1772928	You said to buy enough of it.
1774009	1778131	Just saying if I ever get the console I'm just talking about pornography whenever I'm in front of it.
1778682	1784868	Here's what I was thinking about, though, with the Xbox One, is that if I get one, which, you know, I'm still on the fence.
1784988	1792055	I don't feel as strongly as Jamie does, what she said earlier in the show, but I kind of have very similar concerns to what she already said.
1792515	1796379	To me, it's very similar to how I felt with the Wii U. It's like, okay, that's cool.
1797080	1798381	Do I feel like buying one right now?
1798621	1799682	No, I don't feel like buying one.
1802725	1803285	You know what I mean?
1803345	1810468	And if I wanted to cover the little camera on the little device, or I can just flip it to the wall or whatever, and it still works just fine.
1810688	1811889	You know, no worries, right?
1813129	1818651	So here's my thing is that I think Microsoft needs to clarify some of this, and I think they will.
1819131	1824753	But in a way, if it's just left at what Phil Harrison is saying, he's basically saying, what?
1825094	1826054	Don't you trust us?
1826494	1828155	We're a leader in privacy information.
1828215	1828935	Don't you trust us?
1828955	1829556	What are you talking about?
1829576	1830656	No one got hacked before.
1831237	1832237	Money wasn't stolen.
1832477	1833458	Fact, guys.
1833738	1834098	Fact.
1834499	1842363	You want me to trust a company that, fact, sold a bunch of broken Xboxes that would break after several days of use.
1843304	1846185	My Xbox 360 Red Ring two days after I bought it.
1846225	1847106	That is a fact.
1847686	1866424	fact I had money stolen from my Xbox Live account by a hacker and to this day Microsoft will not acknowledge that there was a breach and instead they deflect blame on the user that is a fact and you want me to trust you you need to be a little bit more transparent with what's going on that's the reality
1868286	1871727	And if I want to turn that fucker off, then I should be able to turn it off.
1872347	1872808	Period.
1873068	1876029	It should not require that thing to be on for any reason.
1876389	1877529	Here's my other question.
1879010	1882391	What if I just unplug the fucking thing so it doesn't have a power source?
1882751	1885472	What if I just unplug it when I don't want to use it?
1886292	1887632	Is that going to cause it to malfunction?
1888213	1891594	Because I could just put it on a switch and have a little on-off switch.
1891634	1893955	They said, no, you don't even have to do that.
1894435	1900717	It's just like the PlayStation 3 where there's a power switch on the back of the console and you can flip it off.
1901997	1911140	But they're just saying, though, if you're going to leave it in standby mode or whatever, that the microphones are going to be always listening to you so that you can say on and it will turn the Xbox on.
1911361	1911641	You know what?
1911701	1911941	I read 1984.
1914946	1916288	Hey, did we leave the Xbox on?
1916609	1918351	Ah, fuck, it's turned on again.
1920034	1926865	Ranma in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Say what you will about Microsoft, but they handled the security breach a hell of a lot better than Sony.
1928306	1929086	Yes and no.
1929927	1931927	Sony at least admitted there was a problem.
1932387	1936469	I didn't actually have any money stolen from my Sony and that whole thing.
1936529	1939290	Nobody hacked into that or stole anything.
1939470	1944511	Sony did have to give a lot away with that and the whole free games and everything.
1945052	1946512	I'm not saying that makes it right.
1946712	1952074	What happened with Sony was not cool and was something they needed to have their feet to the fire held to.
1952674	1970446	but I kind of feel like that was done and they paid for that in the court of public opinion I'm not so sure Microsoft ever had to pay for that but they're gonna pay for this in the court of public opinion and you're starting to see it in you know what Germany is I mean this this is much bigger news than you guys think Germany is freaking crazy when it comes to privacy laws which
1971306	1973447	I don't think anybody here is going to really have a problem with, right?
1973747	1977149	Germany is a leader in some regards when it comes to the privacy.
1977629	1984153	So, you know, if it's going to come to the point where like, yo, the Xbox will not be sold in Germany unless they allow you to turn it off.
1984473	1985974	That's going to cause policy change.
1986034	1986694	It's going to have to.
1987856	1993438	I think it's stupid anyways to have... I understand that the interface stuff uses the Kinect.
1993878	1995419	Whoop-dee-shit.
1995699	1996859	Do I need to use that?
1996959	1999580	Is that really something I need to use?
2000041	2001381	Why even bother with it?
2002141	2008144	Just have it where you can unplug it, and if it's a game that requires Kinect, and I mean requires it, not like...
2009304	2011405	Shouty and Grenade or some bullshit like that.
2011445	2013266	But if it requires Kinect, then have it plug in.
2013727	2017249	That way they can still program the games because they know that there's going to be a Kinect there.
2017589	2018609	You just plug it in.
2018710	2027615	But the whole thing is, if it's not going to work with the Kinect, what if a cat knocks the Kinect off your shelf and it breaks?
2028435	2035159	Fuck, now you can't play your console because your stupid Kinect that you weren't using anyways for stuff is just broken.
2035779	2038421	In the interest of time, I'm going to go ahead.
2038461	2038922	Final thought.
2039342	2043585	Wasn't it also Germany that sort of had Nintendo by the balls for legalities?
2043625	2049630	Didn't the whole zombie you sell late at night thing, wasn't that a Germany-rooted thing?
2049970	2053372	And we saw how they had to work out a deal to get that to go.
2053453	2061959	So I think that whatever comes out of Germany, if it doesn't fly legally on the international stage, they're going to have to make changes.
2062279	2082474	all right regardless admittedly we are making a lot of opinions here based on cloudy information so Microsoft I look to you to clear up some of this cloudiness at E3 and we will reformulate our opinions at that time if need be but this just shows there are questions that have to be answered let's hope Microsoft answers them in a week we'll know a week and a half in a week and a half we'll know
2083510	2086454	Hopefully this will all be over and it'll all be just a dream.
2087315	2088857	It'll be like that one season of Dallas.
2088958	2089659	Anyway, DarkSakura.
2089819	2094045	Well, speaking of international stage, the Xbox One is going to be region locked.
2094706	2100213	So everything that comes out must match the region and this is something Microsoft told Digital Trends.
2101475	2104176	I mean, we've already pretty much seen this anyway.
2104457	2105657	It's not a big surprise.
2106418	2114604	But they are going to keep everything to country-specific guidelines before they're cleared to sale.
2115604	2122189	I think before they were saying that it was up to the developer or the publisher, whatever, if they wanted it to be region-locked or not.
2122517	2122998	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2145153	2150319	If it is up to the studio, that's one thing, but the quote here says, must match.
2151180	2155125	Here's where I'm at with this.
2155605	2160471	It's one of those things where I hear this and I'm like, okay, yet again, it's something that's a little unclear and it's a little disappointing.
2160831	2166953	But sadly, I can't go, well, Microsoft, I totally blame you for doing this, because it's a real unfortunate trend.
2167294	2170475	The only thing we saw that really bucked the trend recently was the PlayStation 3.
2171175	2174016	And what, the original DS was region-free?
2174216	2180759	The DS, the PS, all the handheld systems up to the 3DS were region-free, and then the PS3 was region-free as well.
2181024	2184808	So I can't fault Microsoft alone for this, but I think it is worth saying.
2184848	2190535	We've said it many times on this show, being that this show started out of a very Japanese-centric video game.
2190795	2196221	A bunch of games, including Beatmania and Dance Dance Revolution and all that.
2197463	2199806	I think there's going to come a time when companies need to realize...
2202639	2204920	Gaming companies tear down this wall.
2206020	2207380	Why do we keep separating?
2207820	2209421	We are a global community.
2209581	2212201	I mean, yeah, we're becoming more and more this global economy.
2212501	2215542	There's a lot of people here who would like to play some of the shit that's out in Japan.
2215802	2218703	There's a lot of people in Europe that would like to play some of the stuff that comes out here.
2218743	2221403	It's like, when are we going to get a global console?
2221443	2223184	Why does everything still have to be separated?
2224784	2230948	I know you're all sitting there answering the question for me that, well, it has to do with licensing, especially when you get into those music-based games.
2230968	2232349	A lot of it is licensed by region.
2232649	2238713	But I'm just saying, you know, the internet has got to force some of our ways of thinking in this dealing to modernize.
2238813	2243637	And we need to globalize some of this stuff a little more and make more games region-free because...
2245027	2246367	I'm going to be open and honest.
2246467	2249608	Region locks on the PlayStation 1 is what drove me to piracy.
2249808	2255530	I don't think there's really a whole ton of region locking on iOS games or anything like that.
2255850	2258250	And I mean, let's be honest here.
2258390	2265272	There's not all these iOS games that have great soundtracks and high development costs, that type of thing.
2265332	2266252	But there are a few.
2266692	2268913	And I know there are some music games out there that...
2269894	2275096	aren't region locked, so why can they get away with it when the consoles can't?
2275970	2277711	Well, you know, this is what I think.
2277811	2292379	If you leave everything completely region-free and then just impose import taxes, you know, it's the same thing like I've sort of suggested being done for companies that outsource, you know, tax the crap out of them so that they'd be more inclined to keep jobs over here.
2292919	2301984	But other than that, if a company is going to have, you know, say that everything's region-free, will then make it a little bit more expensive to import.
2302324	2303485	Have an import, you know,
2304305	2312007	Well, I always thought it was really cool that, you know, there was a handful of games on the 360 that were Japanese where they didn't bother to translate them.
2312027	2312887	Like Death Smiles?
2313047	2314688	Yeah, they just put them up on the marketplace.
2314728	2316408	Like, if you want to pay 40 bucks for it, here you go.
2317288	2317628	Yay!
2317968	2322870	We bought, like, that Death Smiles Special Edition, which was pretty much the exact same.
2322930	2323230	Yeah.
2324390	2326571	I wish more game companies did that stuff.
2327251	2328171	Well, they just did that.
2328191	2330472	They had a new Dawn of Apache game that came out.
2330752	2331012	That's cool.
2332572	2337276	Well, I mean, if they are going to region lock the Xbox One or whatever, I hope we see more stuff like that.
2337436	2340498	But I just think region locking is kind of a dated thing.
2342140	2344061	Anyway, more news.
2346503	2347384	So let's see.
2347824	2349986	Let's talk a little bit about Sony.
2350006	2351687	I can get away from Microsoft here.
2352208	2361395	Sony is going to be forcing all publishers and developers to have their titles that are going to be on the PlayStation 4 compatible with remote play on the Vita.
2363143	2391285	I think that's kind of cool actually more reasons to buy a Vita it's a smart little jab at Nintendo and the fact that a lot of the whole Wii U is the whole off screen play Nintendo won't be able to claim exclusivity to that anymore although granted the Vita is a separate device it's probably going to cost you more to do it via the PS4 it's a logical movement of the chess piece if you will
2391525	2404869	But it's even better than just off-screen play with the Wii U because if you're in a Wi-Fi hotspot somewhere else, and I'm assuming that this is all going to be streamed through their Gaikai stuff now, you're going to be able to play your games away from home.
2406010	2406610	Oh, interesting.
2406650	2407550	I didn't even think of that.
2407990	2408230	Yeah.
2408831	2414412	I was just assuming it would be very... And I didn't even think it would necessarily be Wi-Fi, but that's very interesting.
2414993	2418014	Yeah, so I think it's just going to be wherever you are.
2418794	2419394	That'd be kind of cool.
2419554	2425596	That would be really cool if it would work, but if you have an internet connection like what we have here trying to do the show, it might drop out.
2425976	2426636	LOL, game over.
2426656	2429477	You know what that makes me think of, though, just as a concept?
2429877	2437579	Back in the days in Neo Geo where you had the memory card where you could play on the arcade and then take it home if you had the system, wouldn't it sort of be almost the same thing?
2438999	2441100	Especially if you incorporated the share function?
2441420	2448042	Actually, Jamie, now that I think about it, you know, the PS3 and the PSP, yes, PSP, do this today.
2448122	2452703	We talked about this on the show, how this is a horribly underlooked feature of these consoles.
2452783	2465246	But if I'm at a friend's house on their Wi-Fi, if I have my PlayStation 3 set to listen for it, I can power on my PlayStation 3 from my friend's house and over the Wi-Fi navigate my PlayStation 3.
2465686	2467667	I mean, all this technology is there right now.
2467807	2471408	It's just that it's slow as shit and you can't play games through it.
2471628	2475749	You can only do things like watch movies and even then they're going to be a little bit shoddy.
2476050	2476970	Maybe music.
2477110	2479091	But look at where the technology is going to be in two years.
2479151	2479771	Exactly.
2479871	2489854	Now that Sony has Gaikai, what if PlayStation 4 and Loki, I think you hit the nail on the head, what if the PlayStation 4 is a Gaikai box and they're leveraging that technology to oomph that up a lot?
2490314	2494496	We're already looking into these massive...
2496417	2501342	Well, it's always harder to look ahead in a way because honestly, think back to when we were like 9 and 10 years old or...
2514754	2520656	or even, we'll even go a little later, you know, something that, you know, because I know a lot of our listeners are younger, something that maybe a lot of you guys remember.
2520716	2527038	So think to the time that was like 1990, 91 or so when the Super Nintendo was big and the Super Nintendo was first coming out.
2527398	2534221	It was like when you first saw that Mode 7 for the first time, it's like, oh my God, I'm really flying.
2534261	2535621	This shit is real.
2536041	2537322	Or Star Fox.
2537842	2539103	Stunt Race Stunt Race
2566657	2568638	Who knew that we would be replacing all of our TVs?
2568778	2572398	Who knew we wouldn't have to change sides?
2572898	2578280	Who knew that the government would come in and say, everybody must switch from analog to digital?
2578500	2582161	Like, we are going to switch as a country from analog to digital signals for TV.
2582441	2583581	Like, that's just, you know, you don't know.
2583781	2585781	So who knows where we're going to be in 25 years?
2586081	2586662	Who knew?
2587042	2588082	It's exciting and scary.
2588610	2593994	Back when I was playing Kangaroo on the Atari 2600, that I would be playing Mass Effect today.
2595896	2599619	Who knew three years ago on this show when you were like, I don't want to play that game.
2599639	2601140	It's like a stupid shoot-em-up.
2601420	2602361	I don't want to play that.
2603402	2605344	More like dumb effects.
2605744	2611168	I don't want to romance the blue chick, which I did once just so I could dump her, which was hilarious.
2612469	2612930	Just saying.
2614611	2616051	Alright, anyhow.
2616972	2622093	Well, in about 25 years, that might be the time when you can actually play Blizzard's next MMO.
2622953	2626434	They've been working on a new game that's called Titan, but that's a codename.
2626475	2629055	That is not the final name of the game, that's just the codename internally.
2629435	2634857	But it came out this week from a site named VentureBeat that there have been some big changes with Titan.
2635257	2661046	Blizzard internally has postponed this game there were 100 people working on the project but this has been reduced to 30 the other folks have been put to work on other games Titan never had a release date it was never really confirmed by Blizzard but again rumor and all this you know speak is saying that now the game will not be ready until 2016 well now usually I would just say whatever it's a rumor you know I don't know what to think about this
2661826	2668955	But the network ZAM, which runs some popular World of Warcraft sites like Wowhead, if you've played Wow, you probably know that site, wowhead.com.
2669175	2669916	Oh, Wowhead.
2670217	2674783	They reached out to Blizzard, and Blizzard actually said, quote,
2679949	2681730	They kind of confirmed it by saying that, which is really weird.
2681790	2684831	Like, you just would not expect Blizzard to be that transparent, but they said that.
2684851	2684931	So...
2706368	2707268	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2725874	2729377	I, for one, can't get upset about a game I know literally nothing about
2750376	2753058	Maybe that will be that much better and will actually come out sometime soon.
2753078	2754198	Maybe we'll see that at BlizzCon.
2754519	2754939	Who knows?
2755939	2760142	So I can't say I'm going to get upset about this news, especially hearing that they're going to shift the resources elsewhere.
2760222	2767847	But, you know, it's a little bit, you kind of want to go, I wish I could see what Blizzard's going to do that's not Warcraft.
2767887	2769908	And granted, this could be World of Warcraft 2.
2770948	2771429	It could be.
2772649	2775512	I don't know, it took Ragnarok Online long enough to get to a sequel.
2775832	2786843	I sort of think, I don't know, tinfoil hat maybe, but I sort of think that the next WoW expansion is going to finally give that big graphical upgrade that's going to modernize it, and they're not going to need a World of Warcraft 2.
2787243	2792528	I just don't see Blizzard trying to make that happen because it doesn't always happen so well for other MMOs.
2792908	2793048	But...
2793669	2796472	Then again, Guild Wars and Guild Wars 2 coexisting fine.
2796953	2802960	Final Fantasy XI, Final Fantasy XIV Reborn, too soon to tell, but looks promising.
2803421	2806384	Final Fantasy XIV, sorry, pretty.
2806845	2807585	Yeah, no, I know.
2807726	2808426	Cannot wait.
2808687	2810168	Well, that's the importance of technology.
2811290	2813212	All right, anyhow, one more story and then release dates.
2813432	2813853	DarkSakura.
2814898	2818520	Well, in other news, and God, what a disgusting ad on this page.
2819121	2828707	Okay, who remembers the rumor, the big urban legend, about a bajillion Atari 2600 ET cartridges being buried?
2831953	2832993	I've definitely heard that.
2833273	2835354	But they were melted down before they were buried.
2835834	2836674	That's what I heard.
2836714	2837594	I think that's important to know.
2837834	2849397	Well, there is an Ontario-based production company called Fuel that has signed a deal with the... Basically, it's a town in New Mexico.
2850097	2850997	I'm going to ruin this.
2851537	2852357	Alamogordo?
2852578	2853078	Alamogordo.
2853138	2853858	Alamogordo, thank you.
2855058	2860780	were the landfill that supposedly not just E3 cartridges, but a ton of Atari prototypes.
2861380	2866861	Prototype games, prototype systems, anything that was in development that they ended up not releasing going into this dump.
2867462	2873503	And the city has given this production company permission to go digging through the dump.
2874003	2876984	They're going huge dumpster diving in a landfill.
2877224	2881866	This is digging up a dead body to see what the real cause of death was.
2882026	2882926	This is what this is.
2884332	2885353	To do a DNA test.
2907884	2908525	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2918769	2937701	Well, and you know that there are people who have, I'm saying escaped with prototypes, just in jest, but you find a lot of 5200 prototypes online for sale, where people have gotten legit ROM dumps and reconstituted them for sale.
2938782	2940263	Our copy of Millipede for 5200 was a prototype.
2943405	2944446	But they crushed these.
2944566	2947468	I mean, I'd always heard they melted them down, but crushed makes a lot more sense.
2947588	2949149	You put them in the trash compactor and they crush down.
2949169	2951951	They did that so that looters wouldn't dig them up and try to sell them.
2952431	2954753	So, I mean, but then what's the point?
2954773	2957715	You're going to dig up literally garbage that doesn't work.
2957795	2959116	It's 25 years old.
2959456	2962998	Those things, if a board is sitting outside a case that long, it's not going to work.
2963198	2967281	But if a memory chip happens to have been compressed within... Good luck.
2967701	2969743	I know, but the whole thing is that...
2972906	2974107	There's a chance that exists.
2974808	2987061	And people who especially big video game history buffs, Atari fans, they're going to drop the opportunity to see if there is anything salvageable.
2987835	2996141	Dungeon Buster in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, I hope that doesn't turn into another Capone's vault.
2996581	3000164	Will Geraldo Rivera be there when they unearth the big massive ET cartridges?
3000544	3001505	Will he be there live?
3002425	3003686	Does he have a career still?
3004887	3005187	No?
3005808	3006628	So yes, he will be.
3008799	3015761	Didn't the angry video game nerd, like that was like the basis of his movie, was going to the dump to find if the game exists?
3016001	3016541	I don't even know.
3016561	3017161	I never saw it.
3018281	3018481	All right.
3018501	3024823	Well, if we're done with the Atari story, I want to go back real quick to the Titan thing because Technus in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com made a very good point about this.
3024903	3025823	I want to throw this out there.
3026423	3033825	Technus says, I would speculate that Bungie beat them to the punch with Destiny and they needed to reset after Activision picked up Bungie.
3034565	3062841	that's a really good theory because again rumors and whisperings and you know who knows how much we can lend to this but I did hear that Titan was quite a bit like what Destiny sounds like it's going to be that it was less of a shooter per se but that a lot of the same stuff they're talking about implementing with Destiny was supposed to be the types of stuff they were doing with Titan too you know take with a gigantic grain of salt take with an entire can of salt actually take with all the salt in the ocean salt lick salt lick
3064021	3064502	There you go.
3065242	3067164	I have to quote Queen Semia in chat.
3067244	3068405	They find Hoffa under the pile.
3069166	3069586	Plot twist.
3070847	3073710	Masked Bishop with some strong opinions on Realm Reborn.
3074030	3077253	By the way, Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn will succeed.
3077393	3082097	If you think Square Enix will let the Final Fantasy franchise fail, you're sadly mistaken.
3082617	3085860	Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn will be the next game changer.
3086461	3087341	I'll say this much.
3087862	3089143	It's impressive that they...
3090825	3098547	The second half of what he said at least is true because Square Enix put a lot of money to basically redo the fucking game from scratch.
3099065	3099766	and you can see it.
3100506	3101407	You can really tell.
3102608	3103389	It's going to be interesting.
3103529	3104810	Free to play Final Fantasy XI.
3105070	3105390	Come on.
3105690	3106491	Come on.
3106611	3106911	Come on.
3107352	3108152	Wouldn't that be something?
3108653	3109033	We'll see.
3109333	3109554	All right.
3109874	3116760	Let's check out some games that will be coming out a little bit sooner than Final Fantasy XV or whatever else we're thinking about here.
3117180	3117640	Release dates.
3117880	3118141	All right.
3118161	3121343	So this week we've got PlayStation 3 or on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
3121864	3122284	Remember me?
3122664	3123765	Coming out from Capcom.
3124506	3126888	Receiving kind of mixed reviews but whatever.
3127929	3138098	Animal Crossing on the 3DS or Animal Crossing New Leaf on the 3DS because there's one single new leaf in the game and the rest is all the same as the last one.
3140560	3147727	The Skyrim Elder Scrolls V Skyrim Legendary Edition cover re-released the game with the DLC on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC.
3150469	3178102	and at long last if you don't have the internet and you want to play Minecraft Minecraft on the Xbox 360 the Xbox 360 version is coming out as a disc version that might be a good one for the Xbox 360 in the kids room that's not hooked up to the internet I could see that being a plus because Minecraft's a pretty friendly kids game it is an awesome game so there's that and that's pretty much it this week
3179202	3184633	All right, coming out in Japan on the PlayStation 3, Gal Gun gets a price reduction into the best series.
3184694	3185616	Ha ha, yeah.
3185776	3189564	And there's another game called Narawatera Gakuen...
3190523	3194624	Geki Joban Anime, and Complete Setting Book Hybrid Disc.
3194684	3199865	So I think this is actually the anime and a game based on the anime all on one disc.
3200805	3211068	Because you see this happening more and more in Japan where you get the bundled Blu-ray that has a game and a movie or at least two separate Blu-rays or whatever in a bundled collection.
3211868	3217089	On the Xbox 360, Halo Origin Pack this week in Japan for all you Halo fans in origin.
3217549	3221250	Also, Minecraft Xbox 360 Edition, the standalone game, is out in Japan as well.
3221670	3224751	And a new Camouflage 360 wireless controller in Japan.
3224791	3226652	I guess this is to go with the Halo Origin Pack.
3227252	3236635	Which, by the way, quickly while it's on my mind, do you think Microsoft at E3 is going to have anything to kind of throw something at Japan to try and make it work there?
3236795	3237595	I don't think they're going to try.
3238195	3238455	Really?
3238895	3243378	I thought I read somewhere that they did say they are committed to Japan, but that could have just been smoke up my ass.
3243398	3243698	I don't know.
3243718	3244638	I think it's smoke up their ass.
3244878	3247280	They'll release a game with a pillow and a clock.
3247780	3250361	I think the market's so small there now.
3250421	3252102	I don't know.
3252122	3253763	They're just more focused on the larger market.
3253803	3259586	Microsoft's market is small, but certainly handhelds is really what it seems to be about.
3259606	3259986	I don't know.
3261206	3263868	Nothing of note on the PlayStation Vita this week.
3264529	3266591	Looking at... Oh, I already did Xbox 360.
3266651	3266991	Way to go.
3267831	3269633	Seeing if there's anything on the Wii U. Actually, yes.
3269773	3271935	Rabbids Land is supposed to be out in Japan this week.
3272475	3275117	The game that got delayed here is supposedly coming out in Japan.
3276018	3280621	No, Rabbids Land was a launch title for the Wii U. Oh, I'm thinking of the other Rabbids game.
3280761	3282463	Yeah, you're thinking of Rayman Legends.
3282503	3282863	My bad.
3283944	3284244	My bad.
3285245	3285585	Let's see.
3285845	3288067	On the 3DS in Japan this week...
3289228	3290048	Nothing of note.
3291269	3294612	On the PSP this week, God Eater Burst gets a price reduction.
3295393	3299756	So lots of price reductions this week, but really not a lot of new games until we get to about June 20th.
3300157	3302138	Seems to be when the next batch of big games comes out.
3304100	3305841	Really nothing to say on Nintendo 3DS either.
3305881	3311646	Japan gets Donkey Kong Returns 3D next week on the 13th and a Metallic Red DS to go with that.
3311946	3314587	I did pick up Donkey Kong Country Returns, by the way, for my DS.
3314907	3316788	I haven't really played enough of it yet to review it, though.
3317588	3320389	On my plane ride this week, I plan to play some more of it, so I'll let you know.
3321149	3323050	Did I tell you we might finally be getting three DSs?
3323650	3323930	Oh, no.
3324250	3324531	That's great.
3324551	3333534	Because there's going to be a new massive... I know Apollo Justice is in it.
3333714	3334494	I'm trying to remember.
3334874	3335655	Oh, Phoenix Wright.
3335695	3336415	Phoenix Wright, thank you.
3337135	3339516	A new game coming out and Fire Emblem.
3341192	3342492	and then I've won Animal Crossing.
3343593	3344553	Alright, how about the UK?
3344593	3345293	What's coming out over there?
3345473	3345973	Some stuff.
3347013	3356075	On the 3rd we have Gunpoint for PC and Scrolls for PC and Mac and on 7th we have Remember Me PC, Xbox 360, PS3 and that would be it.
3358336	3364617	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com use the passphrase OVEN
3365868	3369130	Just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.
3369210	3369911	But first, Loki.
3370952	3391646	So, this is kind of, I guess, the best news that could come out of the situation, because we know that this is only alluding to worse things to come on the next-gen consoles, but EA is eliminating... They already went ahead and said that they're not going to have the online pass in any future games, and now they're going back and retroactively taking away the online pass...
3392146	3407010	from all the old games as well so the online pass now is free so if you want to you know play a used EA game that had the online pass you buy the game and then you activate the online pass for free so that's nice
3408051	3409572	There's just something about this.
3409812	3410832	I don't know what it is.
3411193	3417057	As we discontinue online paths for our new EA titles, we're also in the process of eliminating it from our existing EA titles.
3417357	3421119	We heard the feedback from players and decided to do away with the online paths altogether.
3422020	3423341	Yeah.
3423681	3424582	I don't trust them.
3424762	3426563	I totally believe that.
3426663	3428945	Oh, what we're doing is wrong.
3429685	3455932	I don't know what it is I don't know what it is and maybe I am just being a jerk but it's like one of those things where it's like are you sure that when you download the free thing it doesn't say but you are giving us your soul like are you sure there's nothing in there like that I just worry I'm sorry but I know better it's just it's so much bullshit I just don't believe any of that crap I roll my eyes
3456502	3459585	We've made too much money, America and the world.
3460286	3465291	We're just going to stop making extra money now because we have all the money that we need to run those servers now.
3465311	3469615	So we don't need any of your online passes anymore because servers all of a sudden got cheaper to run.
3469955	3470736	No, I'm sorry.
3470896	3474280	This is a company that makes money.
3474520	3477063	They're not going to say, hey, we hate money all of a sudden.
3477143	3477483	Right.
3478084	3478324	No.
3478464	3480326	There's just something I don't trust.
3483257	3484238	Call me a conspiracy theorist.
3484298	3491423	Or maybe if I take this as an actual legit sign, maybe it's them trying to get away from the business tactics of the former CEO.
3493565	3494405	Now you're being nice.
3494926	3495226	I know.
3495326	3497928	I've decided to play Angel's Advocate.
3498508	3505093	Or it could be in-game purchases in Dead Space 3 in future games.
3507615	3512599	But if I want to put it at a non-conspiracy theory point of view, even though I trust...
3513266	3539968	EA as far as I can pick up the entire building and nudge it maybe it is trying to separate themselves from former business practice or it's trying to get people to install Origin which I will not fucking do no TigerClaw with a theory in chat at live.vognetwork.com says EA removes the online pass so people can play the used games online and then a few months later EA shuts down the online servers to those games
3540988	3545129	Actually, that is kind of funny.
3545429	3547330	But here's the thing with some of these games.
3547550	3549691	They're not online games.
3550391	3553572	That was the thing that was kind of the funny part about the online pass.
3553592	3556913	Remember like Dragon Age Origins, Dragon Age 2.
3557673	3562715	Mass Effect 2 had that Cerberus pass and it wasn't really, you didn't play online.
3562835	3563135	It was DLC.
3564035	3571221	My hope is that with all of this that it means I won't have to fucking be online for my DLC in Mass Effect 3 to load because I paid for a lot of it.
3573363	3574644	Okay, I'm a consumer whore.
3574664	3575225	I don't care.
3577307	3577727	And how?
3578988	3583252	Yeah, mister, I'm gonna buy Mass Effect 3 Trilogy and own it on Xbox and PC.
3583312	3583892	You know what?
3584032	3584573	You know what?
3584613	3585714	You're worse than me, okay?
3587475	3589117	Okay, well, okay, maybe I play more than you do.
3589917	3591358	I play other games too, though.
3591559	3591899	All right.
3592162	3616355	You're seriously like my dealer, you and Shane I blame you for everything that happens in my life Shane's worse though, come on Shane is worse Shane is far worse And I haven't started on Persona, so There you go, don't resist I will resist, my will is strong My will is titanium By the way, there's now music from Persona 4 in rotation at vognetwork.com I just put some in today You know what, I actually kind of I'm playing too much shit already
3617782	3618002	All right.
3618923	3620003	Going to one more story here.
3620083	3624306	This actually came up last week, but it's too good for us to skip completely on our show.
3624346	3625186	We've got to mention it.
3625507	3627628	Actually, maybe it... When did this finish?
3627648	3630530	I think it finished on Saturday or Sunday of last week.
3630990	3632291	But anyhow, here's the deal.
3632391	3636593	So did you guys ever check out the iPhone and Android game Curiosity?
3636733	3637654	What's in the cube?
3638863	3640645	It's Peter Molyneux's Dick in a Box.
3640986	3642448	Remember this game where you tap the little keyboard?
3642468	3648135	If this was last week, this was me not having much in the way of internet access except for Tumblr.
3648235	3650718	Finally, what was in the box was revealed.
3651259	3652280	Some dude opened the box.
3652300	3653862	You win nothing!
3654383	3655885	You're so stupid!
3657066	3658587	Well, here's what's amazing.
3658887	3661849	The guy who won is an 18-year-old guy, Brian Henderson.
3661889	3664330	He lives in Edinburgh, and he won.
3664870	3672774	And the great thing about it, he ended up tweeting or saying in an interview, I don't remember where it was, but he said, yeah, I just downloaded the game an hour before I won it.
3676836	3679578	So what was in the goddamn cube?
3679598	3684240	See, I would have played to the very end too if I had remembered that it was ending, but I just like, I don't fucking care.
3684340	3686521	Here's, guess what was in the goddamn cube?
3686541	3689023	I'm sure many of you have heard, but here's what was in the cube.
3690223	3693485	You, again, now 22cans is, they did Curiosity.
3693505	3697067	Their next project is like a populist reimagining called Goddess.
3697768	3701830	Well, Brian will be the god in Goddess.
3703556	3704397	at the Stardust.
3704577	3704717	No.
3706298	3708679	But he will be in... You don't know shit.
3712482	3713362	I can't believe this.
3714243	3716965	Some new kid from the street won this.
3717685	3718546	You don't know shit.
3720467	3721848	You are a whore, darling.
3722168	3725970	A show where we can fall into showgirls quotes is a good show.
3726011	3729413	That game is called Goddess and it just makes me think of showgirls.
3729513	3730433	Sorry, Nomi Malone.
3730453	3730794	That's right.
3730874	3732595	Nomi Malone from Edinburgh.
3734096	3735097	I'm sorry to this kid.
3735117	3737479	This poor kid didn't ask for this, so I'm very sorry.
3738019	3739220	But I'm going to make the joke anyway.
3739320	3742022	I'm doing the hand flashies in my head.
3743403	3745064	Nomi Malone from Edinburgh.
3745605	3749088	Open the cube and we'll get to be the god and goddess.
3750302	3775818	and apparently not only will he be the god but he will have a hand in creating the rules that will govern the game so it's his rules or get out and Brian gets to share in the revenue generated by goddess but they're saying in one year he could be pushed down a flight of stairs or slip on ice and a new goddess could emerge here's the thing
3777489	3781154	When did this whole thing, this cube thing launch?
3781194	3782656	Like what, seven months ago, right?
3783437	3786861	Didn't Goddess get kickstarted midway through this project?
3786941	3787542	Kickstarted?
3787762	3788803	Yeah, that's my new verb.
3788903	3789945	Didn't it get kickstarted?
3790185	3791146	Where would it be kickstarted?
3791507	3792148	Kickstarted.
3792488	3793910	Because the website is Kickstarter.
3794110	3794370	Okay.
3794531	3795211	Not Kickstart.
3795692	3795972	All right.
3796877	3797978	Are you going to kickstart my heart?
3798018	3798158	No.
3799118	3804301	So Goddess got kickstarted halfway through the run of Cube.
3804761	3806662	What if it hadn't gone through?
3807042	3808643	Then what would have been in the Cube?
3809963	3810904	I got you.
3811784	3812385	No.
3812585	3815786	You are making this shit up as you go along, Peter Molyneux.
3816286	3817307	I got you.
3817447	3820469	Was it Schreudner's box or whatever?
3820749	3823370	It's basically... There's a dead cat who's not dead.
3824232	3826974	Yes, so it's Goddess, but not Goddess.
3827574	3833238	We won't know because it was Goddess in the box and not Goddess dead having eaten the poison.
3835139	3836020	You know what it would have been?
3836040	3837941	It would have been a dog.
3838121	3839542	He would have adopted a dog for you.
3839562	3840543	It would have been life-changing.
3842564	3845385	Or, guess what?
3846625	3850886	I've got this boy named Milo and you're going to adopt him.
3852987	3855067	Having kids is going to change your life.
3856048	3857568	Milo will change your life.
3859509	3863250	Milo needs his diaper changed every five seconds and you'll want to die.
3863990	3868671	Alright, well we reached out to Peter Molyneux for comment on Goddess and this is what he had to say.
3869775	3872077	Must be weird not having anybody come on you.
3872898	3873838	What does that even mean?
3875600	3876641	What does that even mean?
3879283	3880304	That was a quote from Showgirls.
3880424	3880664	Get it?
3881365	3883626	I will give you the best Fable game ever made.
3884187	3887249	It's Fable the Journey.
3887490	3888390	It uses Kinect.
3888731	3889391	It's fantastic.
3889411	3890172	It's not on Rails.
3890352	3891313	It's not on Rails.
3895703	3903930	Oh shit, alright, let's go to- Hey, I'll tell you what, you know what would have been inside the box if perhaps Peter Molyneux wasn't backing this and it was the Steam box?
3904270	3904610	Hats!
3904630	3906012	Would have been fucking hats.
3906552	3907193	Lots of hats.
3907533	3908273	Hats, hats, hats.
3909374	3912237	Let's travel back- Do they have like a gif?
3915940	3918722	I think it's funny that we both grunted at him at the same time.
3919975	3920075	Near?
3920095	3920175	Far!
3944417	3948983	Let's travel back to a time when gaming was so much simpler.
3949323	3949844	When you know what?
3949924	3953569	Elizabeth Berkley was Jessie Spano and you hadn't seen her boobies yet.
3953669	3954670	It's a much simpler time.
3954990	3957013	It's the classic game of the week.
3957794	3959696	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
3960417	3960898	Sonic R.
3962495	3977390	Yes, it is Sonic R. I have finally decided to do fucking Sonic R. So, Sonic R was done by Traveler's Tales and Sonic Team, and it came out on the Sega Saturn and Windows.
3978210	3983415	It was out for Windows, which actually, if you've got a decent graphics card, the Windows version actually looks a lot better and plays better.
3984436	3997222	It came out in the US on October 31st, 1997, and then later it came out in Europe, Australia, and Japan all at the same time, and was re-released for PlayStation 2 and the GameCube as part of the Sonic Gems Collection.
3998503	4008568	It is basically the last of the two, I'm sorry, the third Sonic racing game, and the last of two games that was done by Traveler's Tales and Sonic Team.
4009048	4010509	So basically, it's a huge foot race.
4010830	4011550	That's what the game is.
4012331	4014633	And it's single or multiplayer.
4015193	4015874	You can race.
4016354	4018456	You have ten different Sonic characters.
4019437	4027024	And you can pick up, like, you have to collect rings on the way to open up different parts of the racetrack.
4027644	4032829	You also can get, like, different shields, like what's in Sonic 3.
4033189	4035891	Like, you can actually get a lightning shield that attracts rings to you.
4037933	4063728	and you have different areas that are sort of based off of various places in the different Sonic games like you have a place that looks like the Green Hill Zone a place that looks like the Chemical Plant you have those item panels like I was talking about that give you different abilities as you go like you can run on water or attract rings and then you get Sonic Tokens and Chaos Emeralds and the Chaos Emeralds help you unlock secret characters
4064688	4065889	You also have different kinds of weather.
4065929	4067790	You have clear, you have rain, you have snow.
4068971	4074756	But the snow does make the water free so you can run over it instead of being slowed down by it.
4075656	4079139	And you have a time attack mode to see basically who has the fastest time.
4079759	4086044	So the characters in this one is you are, let's see, you have Sonic and he has double jump.
4086704	4087725	He's also the fastest.
4087785	4089867	Tails actually has the ability to fly.
4089967	4090748	Knuckles can glide.
4092409	4121011	and then you have Amy Rose who actually drives a car and she can hover over water and gets extra speed boost for your secret characters you have Robotnik also known as Eggman he has a hovercraft and can resist terrain you have Metal Sonic you have a Tails doll and you have Metal Knuckles you have Egg Robo and Super Sonic so basically when you have all the Chaos Emeralds you can play as Super Sonic and you just sort of float over everything
4123353	4129457	The game actually came out after Sonic 3D Blast when Sega was working with Traveler's Tales on a different Sonic game.
4130538	4138144	And they'd also been working on a 3D graphics engine that they didn't really have anything for, so they decided to work with Sonic Team to make the game.
4139125	4141246	Pretty much just everything that came together.
4142286	4147067	So there's actually even a Sonic R that came out on the Tiger handheld system.
4148668	4155249	Of course, like I said, there was the Sega Saturn version that actually had some really bad problems with draw distance and clipping.
4156450	4163052	But the PC version let you use better rendering and 3D acceleration, and you could adjust the draw distance.
4163072	4166933	So basically, like today, you could have no draw distance at all in the game.
4166973	4167853	It would be gorgeous.
4168533	4176174	The music was done by Richard Jacques of Sega Europe, who also did the music for Sonic 3D Blast.
4177255	4185136	And he basically worked with Yuji Naka to basically design the musical feel of the game.
4185916	4188116	And that's where we got the Super Sonic Racing.
4188956	4197098	And then the singer in this one, now this I didn't know, her name is TJ Davis, and she did all of the singing in it at Yuji Naka's request.
4198358	4202542	So, basically, it was done by a London studio.
4203263	4204243	The music came out of London.
4206105	4207066	I think it's a fun game.
4207166	4212651	It's sort of, you know, not like the world's best Sonic game, but it's a really fun game.
4212871	4220357	And from that, we also got the two games, well, there were two games that came out before Sonic R. There was Sonic Drift and Sonic Drift 2 for Game Gear.
4221378	4231851	and then after that we've gotten Sonic Riders, we've gotten Sonic Riders Zero Gravity, Sonic Free Riders, Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing and the Transformed version as well.
4231951	4234274	Those are all pretty much born out of the Sonic R franchise.
4235851	4240753	and, of course, the music is, you know, pretty much the big iconic thing about it.
4241173	4244454	It's not the most gorgeous game, but it's super fun, like we said.
4246034	4256017	You know, we say a system is only as good as the games that are on it, but the games are also, can be absolutely amazing without having to look, you know, absolutely gorgeous.
4256177	4256658	You know what I mean?
4257418	4260739	And this is one of those that falls into that category.
4261379	4264200	So my game of the week is Sonic R.
4266311	4268372	This is one of those games that to me just made sense.
4268733	4270093	Like Sonic in a racing game.
4270254	4271734	Why did it take so long?
4272275	4272955	Kinda right.
4274176	4275137	And it did have some good music.
4275957	4278499	Super Sonic Racing was in Sonic R, Tiger Call.
4280040	4280320	Alright.
4281060	4284242	There it is, your classic game of the week, Sonic R. Good pick.
4285703	4287104	Have you done every single Sonic game yet?
4287124	4288125	You gotta be getting close.
4288797	4289678	I've done a few of them.
4289818	4292721	But keep in mind, there's a bunch of crap out there in the Sonic franchise.
4293002	4297066	And I would get Sonic herpes or something.
4298127	4298368	All right.
4298868	4299609	We're going to take a break.
4299649	4302933	And when we come back, there is still more news to come in the Fugo Question of the Week.
4302993	4306857	Oh, and to tell what up, G, same music in Japan, all out of the London studio.
4307017	4309358	So there's none of this whole No, there's not.
4309498	4310779	Okay, just making sure.
4310959	4312199	Good, at least we can all agree on something.
4312620	4321944	Okay, plenty more to come when Orange Launch Radio returns with this episode number 506, Second Mix J Append, Part B, right after this.
4333382	4340786	Hola, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican, Actdeft, and you're participating with Orange Nouns Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.
4341347	4344929	And I want to use my voice to tell you that Kirby does not suck.
4345649	4349532	Well, literally he does suck, but not figuratively.
4349952	4351413	Anyways, play more Kirby!
4353203	4354344	That's right, play more Kirby.
4355024	4357366	They have that whole Wii U virtual console thing going on right now.
4357446	4363250	I was tempted to get the Kirby's Dream Course that they had on Super Nintendo.
4363290	4364571	It was like the miniature golf game.
4365111	4365831	It was awesome.
4367112	4367633	Good times.
4368635	4369075	There you go.
4369455	4370956	You too can leave a bumper.
4371016	4375518	Go to vognetwork.com and check out the forums for Orange Lounge Radio and more information on there.
4376118	4380821	If you want to use your voice to tell the gaming world something, maybe you want them to play less Kirby.
4381361	4382862	You could tell us that in a future bumper.
4383122	4385083	That was the last one that I had in the queue, by the way.
4385163	4388464	So you're going to start hearing repeats if I don't get any new ones for the next show.
4388624	4389104	Just saying.
4389565	4390345	That's my little threat.
4390645	4391125	Just saying.
4393427	4418310	During the break tonight, before we get into rapid fire news, I noticed some of the chatters were talking about Civ V, and I don't know how this got brought up, but apparently the Mass Effect mods for Civ V I thought I mentioned this on the show before Yes, they exist, and they're awesome Fun fact, you once said that about Mass Effect I have never liked that type of game
4419321	4424844	I didn't even, I mean, I admit that, shit, what game is it I'm thinking of now?
4426064	4427045	Pop, not Populous.
4427505	4429686	Well, I didn't like Populous either, but... SimCity?
4431467	4431747	Are we?
4431887	4432147	Uh-oh.
4432408	4433948	Oh, I thought I hit all the buttons.
4434669	4439471	You know what, I just happened to look over and saw that we were muted, so all of this conversation that's happening...
4441960	4443461	Professional radio folks.
4443681	4444302	You know what?
4445102	4450166	Rob was giving me crap for not wanting to play Civ even though there's a Mass Effect mod.
4450646	4454409	And I was telling him how I did not like Civ.
4454749	4456890	I don't like SimCity.
4457491	4458852	I do not like SimCoaster.
4459432	4462494	Although I do like watching the coasters that people have made on SimCoaster.
4463235	4464375	I don't like SimPark.
4464856	4469459	I like the Sims, but really I like building houses and dressing them up and murdering them.
4470622	4472376	I don't like SimAnt either.
4473243	4473443	Actraiser
4503021	4504082	Two things about Actraiser.
4504302	4505403	A, the soundtrack.
4506163	4509125	B, when that angel flies around, you can see his butt.
4510106	4510786	It was butt.
4510886	4512467	And this is how Rob first learned.
4512487	4514809	No, it was butt on the Super Nintendo.
4514889	4516450	So it made you giggle a little bit.
4516490	4517070	You know what?
4517230	4517751	It was butt.
4519232	4521853	You know what?
4522153	4522394	Butt.
4524494	4525055	That's what.
4525455	4527158	From now on, instead of chicken butt, it's angel butt.
4527778	4528219	Guess what?
4528359	4528840	Angel butt.
4529060	4529400	All right.
4530382	4534327	Let's go around and talk about rapidly what's happening in the world of gaming.
4534367	4535128	Some quick stories.
4535869	4536910	Rapid Fire News.
4537010	4538993	This may be a bit of a spoiler, but...
4540755	4543719	We think maybe Mirror's Edge 2 might be coming to the Xbox One.
4544199	4550867	Apparently there was first off a listing on the German and Italian storefronts for Amazon.
4551368	4552469	And those are removed.
4553331	4555313	Listing it was for the Xbox One and
4556433	4571799	and then on EA's own website in the help section their help center had a page for Mirror's Edge 2 and now it's gone so makes me think that maybe that's going to be one of the announcements perhaps
4573462	4573742	Yes, please.
4601976	4605779	Last but not least, El Shaddai.
4606680	4608241	I don't know if you guys remember that game.
4608281	4611524	It's kind of an artsy action game from Ignition.
4612225	4617229	Well, now the rights have been transferred to the creator.
4617529	4626416	El Shaddai is now back in the creator's portfolio as far as the rights go.
4626737	4629459	Maybe that means it's going to open up an opportunity for more games.
4629699	4631180	You know what's making me cry right now?
4632440	4635021	Every time anyone talks about that game, I hear Amy Grant.
4636802	4637923	Baby, baby.
4637983	4643445	No, no, no, because when she was heavy into her Christian singing mode, she did a song called El Shaddai.
4643465	4647327	Keep in mind, I was raised Baptist.
4647367	4647927	Here's the thing.
4648668	4651149	The references on this show are getting more and more obscure.
4651409	4655011	Okay, well, the full title was El Shaddai, the Ascension of the Metatron.
4656311	4657712	Did she do a song called Metatron?
4658795	4670634	No, but I just finished watching the season of Supernatural and there was Metatron in it Lordy So, let's see Metatron Yeah
4670799	4671059	That's it.
4671940	4675021	And, sorry, Brad, I adore you to death.
4675401	4677442	It was a decent song, but her Hebrew was awful.
4679243	4680324	Alright, moving on.
4680804	4683526	I'm shocked that so many people know that Amy Grant song.
4683626	4688508	I only remember, baby, baby, something, something lyrics.
4688568	4693571	Okay, there's one song that she did that I really like, and that was the duet she did with Vince Gill, who she married.
4694329	4695590	Just saying Whatever happened to her?
4696391	4700754	She's still recording and still married to Vince Gill She's still recording?
4701094	4722211	Yeah, I actually, believe it or not, the only site I could get working was Wikipedia And I was reading up about, actually Vince Gill, but it linked to Amy Grant, so I was like Isn't that amazing how on Wikipedia you could just She married him She's married to Vince Gill I believe you
4723266	4728029	Mama's watching that Oklahoma relief thing and Vince Gill was on it, so we looked up Vince Gill and it led to Amy Grant.
4733292	4738015	She's back to doing super Christian stuff and singing with Vince.
4740296	4741417	Jamie, Jamie.
4743198	4743998	Oh.
4744679	4744939	Oh.
4745039	4745139	Oh.
4749062	4750683	For the record, she does have a gorgeous voice.
4750703	4750923	Hey!
4750943	4751524	I remember I got...
4767154	4774000	I remember I got dragged to an Amy Grant concert at the State Fair.
4774460	4779064	I got dragged to one of those, and it was just not fun.
4779104	4779844	Did you sing along?
4780044	4780845	No, I didn't.
4781145	4782506	I'm not a fan of Amy Grant.
4783107	4785949	I recognize that song, but I don't know any of her other songs.
4786409	4793455	You know the only concert I've been taken to at a fair against my will was Michael Damien.
4793715	4798958	I think literally that is the only concert I have seen at the State Fair is the Amy Grant one.
4799038	4800459	And I don't remember who opened it.
4800519	4801760	It was another Christian artist.
4801820	4803181	You haven't been to Sea Weird Al?
4803501	4804261	No, I sadly haven't.
4804281	4805642	You haven't been to Sea Weird Al?
4805742	4806503	He's coming this year.
4806523	4808244	I see Weird Al.
4808704	4810645	It's a hundred and some degrees outside.
4810685	4811906	I don't go outside for anybody.
4812166	4812927	He can come to my house.
4814688	4815808	Jamie, Jamie.
4816609	4819110	I went to Fresno to see Weird Al, so...
4820253	4821353	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4845603	4847463	Hotline Miami, and Proteus.
4873917	4878401	I'm going to get this just because I like indie games and I've pretty much gotten every other indie bundle.
4878461	4879221	It's already got it.
4879381	4879682	Did you?
4880482	4881563	Have you checked out any of the games yet?
4882504	4884085	They'll just sit there in my Steam library.
4884686	4887188	I have now in my Steam library 126 games.
4887348	4892872	And that's not all of them because I haven't bothered to put all of the Sonic the Hedgehog games in.
4893213	4900839	I only because I bought the Sonic collection with every single Sonic the Hedgehog game that's on PC and I only put in Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing and Sonic Generations.
4900939	4902460	I didn't bother to put the rest of the ones.
4902642	4904218	Sonic Generations is a damn good game.
4904571	4934112	They also have, well you saw, I don't know if you saw They have a mod that actually, it's Sonic It converts it to the other Sonic 3D game that they had I don't remember I see TigerClaw in the chatroom saying Hotline Miami has a good soundtrack And the good news is you will also be able to get the soundtracks with these games DRM free downloads, Steam keys, Windows, Mac, and Linux versions For the record, for the record Whatever games that I don't keep out of this I'm more than happy to share with some of our listeners
4934927	4943510	And, and, and, I should mention that they also have a humble weekly bundle that's going on right now that's all the Telltale series.
4943530	4944490	Oh yeah, I saw that too.
4944610	4946190	Which I also bought.
4946230	4947591	Those are some great deals right now.
4947611	4949231	Walking Dead, Sam & Max.
4949972	4951992	Walking Dead alone is worth it if you don't already have it.
4952012	4953913	Yeah, if you pay more than average, it's Walking Dead.
4953953	4954973	You get Sam & Max.
4955693	4956253	Also great.
4956674	4957554	Back to the Future.
4957674	4957934	Great.
4959135	4966820	Puzzle Agent, which I've never played, Waltzing Gromit, Poker Night, The Inventory, and... That's a lot.
4968061	4969202	Jurassic Park?
4969703	4970363	No Jurassic Park.
4970383	4971644	Probably because of licensing.
4972445	4972965	Alright, anyhow.
4974366	4975427	So look at stupid kids ruining everybody's fun.
4997981	5001144	Stop DDOSing MMOs and kicking everybody off.
5001164	5002125	This is trying to have a good time.
5002445	5006328	By the way, speaking of DDOS attacks, Bobby asked me to relay the following along.
5007069	5012314	Should we lose the stream at some point during the show tonight, don't hit F5 to refresh the entire page.
5012334	5015396	Because when you all do it at once, it's like a little mini DDOS attack.
5015596	5019440	Because we're not on the servers as big as EVE Online or Dust514.
5019740	5021582	We're running off a tin can that has some...
5022402	5022943	Pause, unpause.
5022963	5023323	Pause, unpause.
5038592	5041373	And that will not do a DDoS attack on our little website.
5043354	5048297	If you are a Vita owner, you'll be excited to know that Flower is coming to the Vita.
5048898	5049598	This is awesome.
5049878	5050679	I love Flower.
5050879	5056162	I played it on the PlayStation 3, but I would say it's the best racing game I've played in a long time.
5056542	5059164	Even though you would not think of Flower as a racing game.
5059404	5060125	It's really great.
5061045	5062326	Flower is going to be on the Vita.
5062446	5065168	It will be one of the IndieCade games coming to E3.
5066248	5066788	DarkSakura
5083120	5085142	Hold on, I'm saying that I only care about R-Type.
5086703	5087464	What, in the chat room?
5087504	5088605	Talking about Irem games.
5089005	5089746	Oh, okay, I'm sorry.
5089926	5091347	Because R-Type is freaking great.
5091607	5096311	Okay, tell me that R-Type does not have the best first stage music of almost any game ever.
5097832	5099213	If you said it doesn't, then you're lying.
5100695	5100895	So...
5102304	5110248	You Don't Know Jack is going to be on OUYA on June 11th and the Jackpad app will make your phone a controller.
5111068	5120453	So folks who have OUYA's and an Android phone or an iOS will get to have a controller out of their phone.
5121133	5121594	Yay!
5123114	5123995	Aren't you special?
5125215	5128197	Square Enix registered Final Fantasy Agito.
5129298	5131941	Which is something that we heard at E3, what, five years ago?
5132162	5132742	Six years ago?
5133884	5134385	Eventually?
5135366	5138009	Because they were supposed to do Final Fantasy Agito 13.
5139431	5142234	So now they've got Final Fantasy Agito.
5142895	5143276	Hooray.
5143356	5143656	There you go.
5143676	5145439	Perfect question for Bobby Blackwolf.
5145979	5146800	So where's Versus 13?
5149366	5150487	Oh, a question for the screeners?
5150807	5153008	Well, here's the thing.
5154229	5156450	Either that's going to be answered once E3 starts.
5157190	5160212	I kind of think it's a game that has to show up in one way or another.
5160272	5165935	Whether it's true that they moved it to 15 or what, I kind of think you'll have something on that well before the show starts.
5166375	5172338	But let's say they do announce Final Fantasy Versus XIII and you want to know, is lightning in it?
5172638	5173899	Or something that they don't say.
5173959	5174279	I don't know.
5174619	5176080	You could go ask that question.
5176431	5177372	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5197125	5198325	It's getting a Steam release date.
5198605	5201626	It's going to be out today already.
5202326	5202946	July 2nd.
5204146	5206367	As announced by developer Two Tribes.
5207147	5210728	And in the PC version is a Steam workshop integration and achievements.
5211708	5218089	So there's also a level editor that was promised for Wii U and well, they don't have that yet.
5218849	5219229	Gee!
5219829	5221089	Nintendo and online?
5221510	5223590	It's coming soon, trademark patent pending.
5224741	5225922	You know what else is coming soon?
5225962	5227082	Hey, you know what, though?
5227122	5235567	At this point, if the Xbox One Connect is going to watch me poop, then, like, give me the Wii U and its outdated technology, all right?
5237168	5237688	You know what?
5238849	5246814	I'm just going to go home and hook up the Turbo Duo and play me some freaking Dracula X and not worry about my system watching me in my pajamas.
5247054	5247394	The end.
5250057	5250838	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5268542	5270684	The Connect did while it was watching you poop.
5272365	5274146	No, seriously guys, I don't have my theme music.
5274166	5275107	Help me fill time.
5276728	5277669	No, not by singing.
5278970	5280231	You don't want to hear me sing anyway.
5282232	5283273	I want that game.
5284734	5286996	Go to Square Enix and tell them to give it to me.
5288157	5289478	Tell them to give me the zero.
5289918	5290539	I want it.
5291379	5292240	Can't you just import it?
5292940	5296103	So what exactly is the downside for... I don't think I can read it.
5296747	5299494	Not voting on Steam Greenlight titles.
5299574	5300576	I never understood that.
5302179	5303623	You don't get your little mini-achievement?
5304111	5308392	Anyhow, I would love to answer Loki's question, but I found music.
5337998	5339099	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5361795	5370062	Well, anyhow, although I'm not going to get into all the details on Final Fantasy IX because it sounds complicated, this had us thinking about rediscovering things in classic games.
5370482	5374625	Have you ever revisited an old game years after its release to find something new?
5375045	5376146	Go back and complete it at 100%?
5377187	5384072	What classic game did you revisit after many years, not necessarily to play it for the first time, but to try and discover new things inside it?
5385051	5385752	DRAGON BOSS GRAPPLING BEAM
5400883	5401623	Pretty neat stuff.
5401663	5404364	I guess it's common knowledge to many, but I had no idea.
5404745	5405965	And he linked us a little YouTube.
5406445	5409326	You know, there's a lot of ways you can kind of trick that game.
5409366	5412307	You can do like wall jumps and get past places you're not supposed to.
5412588	5415349	There's lots of little ways you can kind of like trick it and beat the system.
5415769	5416709	So that's one of the really cool.
5417209	5421791	That's what makes part of what makes Super Metroid the best ever.
5422271	5428053	No, that's where you could get to the top of the castle by doing the double jump and get your final star in Super Mario 64.
5428193	5428594	Just saying.
5430980	5443837	Anyway, Tiara responds and says, I've actually been replaying Final Fantasy IX for the past several weeks and I never knew about this side quest until I stumbled upon the info while looking for Chocobo hot and cold treasure locations.
5444618	5446180	You're going to be one of the first to see it.
5447620	5453722	Sorry for the Facebook noise, but I'm actually on Facebook trying to read these answers.
5454302	5461545	Trust me when I say it is harder than the first quest.
5461805	5462145	Really?
5462245	5462805	That is true.
5463265	5465906	Well, a lot of people go back and beat retro games.
5466746	5467586	It is harder than the first quest.
5467606	5473028	And for the record, for anyone who wants to do it without beating the game first, just type in Zelda for your name.
5473168	5473568	That is true.
5474168	5476669	Zelda's another one of those games where you don't have to have every item.
5476889	5478129	You can get around some of this stuff.
5478330	5480950	Like, you could get through the whole game with a wooden sword, I think.
5481470	5485111	Don't forget to walk headfirst into walls because you never know which one's invisible.
5485211	5485712	You never know.
5486312	5486572	All right.
5487612	5488012	Let's see.
5488773	5496395	Andy R. replied and said, I replayed Okami earlier this year thanks to the HDification version and I found a lot of things I didn't find the first time.
5496515	5500296	Things such as the hidden spider bosses or some of the advanced forms of the brush techniques.
5500916	5508102	Also, knowing what happens in the story before I started made me more cognizant of the foreshadowing I missed the first time I played the game, which was kind of cool.
5509143	5512306	Mary B. replied with another Final Fantasy answer.
5512346	5518671	Final Fantasy VIII learned how to crazy attack with Squall's two-hour, whatever it was, and that it was stronger than his summit.
5518751	5522695	Did they have two-hour abilities in Final Fantasy VIII, or was that your Final Fantasy XI addiction talking?
5523355	5524756	after getting stuck on Bahamut.
5525176	5528058	I had to come back to a save down to Bahamut after not playing for months.
5528478	5531480	Final Fantasy X and X-2 just for fun because I like them so much.
5531880	5533621	Use strategy guide to get 100% though.
5534742	5539885	Ragenator said, well, at least prior to my PS3 being stolen, I regularly went back and played older classics.
5540245	5545609	The closest thing to discovering something new was in terms of tactics for situations where I got stuck in the past.
5546269	5546549	GameFAQs
5567346	5572549	I knew fatalities, not sure all, were possible without the blood code, so I tried it out with Kano.
5572849	5574970	To my surprise, Kano managed to do his finishing move.
5575250	5578612	However, instead of a heart, he pulled out an organ that was dark colored.
5578932	5581533	I can only assume that he pulled out his opponent's liver.
5582934	5584355	It's an evil thing and must be destroyed.
5584755	5589978	Even with no blood code, Mortal Kombat surprised me with the amount of gore it was still able to show on the consoles.
5591058	5595602	All right, going over to Google Plus and some of the answers there.
5596883	5598205	Were there no answers on Google Plus?
5598585	5599466	Oh, no, there's two, sorry.
5599866	5602068	Google Plus changed and now I can't find things.
5602108	5608034	All right, Red Entertainment says, I remember me and my best friend as a kid trying and failing to beat Mega Man 2 on the NES.
5608434	5614960	No matter how many different times or many different ways we tried to beat the game, we could never get past one particular part in Dr. Wily's Fortress at the end.
5615340	5616722	It wasn't until I was older...
5617062	5624925	Bought the Mega Man Collection on PS2 and had access to online walkthroughs that I finally got the item you needed in order to proceed past that one particular part.
5625285	5629586	When I finally beat that game, it felt like I was giving my eight-year-old self a figurative high-five.
5629967	5633028	Not a literal high-five because that would break the space-time continuum.
5633948	5640830	and lastly Travis H on Google Plus says I found myself overjoyed with the amount of PS1 and PSP games I can replay on my Vita.
5641170	5647492	I'm right now in the middle of playing Wild Arms trying to complete it to its fullest and find things that I missed the first time around.
5647793	5654795	It is very refreshing to go back in an older age and enjoy the simple things as the dialogue and some humor you may not have got when you were younger.
5655055	5656976	Talk about a good soundtrack by the way.
5660478	5661781	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
5669492	5696906	Oh my gosh, alright, there you go Thank you to the folks that answered the Facebook question of the week and the Google Plus question of the week Answer in a future week I want to say quickly though about that last answer was very similar to one of the Facebook answers and a couple things we were hearing is that these HD remakes really seem to get people to go back and play them again and I kind of find that to be true too is that when the things get re-released it's like a reason for me to go back I had never tried to beat Mario 2 with just one character before
5697446	5699206	So that was something I kind of did that was new this week.
5699467	5700267	Try doing it with Toad.
5701927	5703708	The desert levels would be manageable.
5703988	5710389	I actually, I only use Toad in the desert levels for the most part, but I did, now this was, keep in mind, when I was a kid, I did a full playthrough with Toad.
5711569	5714670	And you would be surprised at the number of coins you get.
5715230	5717151	I was playing the stupid bonus game for ages.
5717351	5719811	Because you have a faster dig.
5721052	5723052	SSJ100, Matt to the rescue in the chat room.
5723592	5725373	A-B-A-C-A-B-B.
5725693	5726413	That was the blood code.
5727284	5727684	ABA, CABB, Abacab
5746543	5750224	The next Kickstarter for Double Fine has been launched.
5750304	5753626	They're a brand new game called Massive Chalice.
5754206	5761989	And it's kind of a cross between a feudal fantasy tactical strategy game with this weird...
5764440	5785744	I guess they're saying there's like permanent death in the game so you have to create new characters by breeding them I guess so yeah that's gonna be coming I guess and it looks interesting they're most likely gonna hit their goal since they're at 677,500 right now and their goal is 725,000 and they've got 24 days to go so most likely they're gonna make it so yeah
5795953	5796233	I don't know.
5796473	5797234	Looks interesting.
5797754	5802036	It's being headed up, I guess, by the guy that did Iron Brigade, Brad Muir.
5804858	5811141	Speaking of Kickstarter stuff, by the way, the Zelda Kickstarter we had, that guy on the show a couple weeks ago, didn't make it.
5811641	5812042	Didn't make it.
5812062	5813582	Bummer.
5813662	5821086	He says he has some other plans, though, and good luck to him with plan B. I think you gotta have a plan B when you go into this Kickstarter thing, because I think it's like...
5822327	5825389	I think it's like going viral.
5825809	5829372	These ad agencies will hire people saying, we need you to make a viral ad.
5829712	5833475	But sometimes, either it's going to catch or it's not.
5833595	5835176	And it's not that it's necessarily bad.
5836257	5837698	Sometimes it happens and sometimes it doesn't.
5838018	5842921	Now, when you're double fine and you have that name recognition, well, the money's going to come to them pretty easy.
5843401	5849926	But unfortunately for the Zelda movie and all that, it just didn't catch on for whatever reason.
5850006	5851047	And that's going to happen sometimes.
5851067	5851487	Yeah.
5852557	5858385	Good luck to him with whatever he decides to do with his plan B. That makes me quite sad.
5858585	5859386	Yeah, it's unfortunate.
5859606	5860087	Very unfortunate.
5860187	5862771	I had put in some money, but I got it back.
5863432	5865334	Or I should say they never charged it, because that's what happens.
5865374	5866856	They don't charge you until it goes through, so...
5867857	5871361	Alright, going to some news for the 3DS.
5871961	5875685	The 3D Sonic that I remember we talked about was rumored a couple weeks ago.
5876285	5880509	Apparently it is something that's happening because the Australian Classification Board issued ratings.
5880990	5883152	Oh, you gotta love when the ratings board spoils games.
5883392	5890058	Well, not only did they roll out a 3D Sonic the Hedgehog rating, but they also rolled out a 3D Altered Beast rating.
5891279	5915244	apparently 3D Space Harrier, 3D Super Hang-On Space Harrier these are all out in Japan already but the fact that they're rated in Australia means they're probably coming around to the rest of the world too which by the way if I am right and they're the same as the Sega Ages what was it I imported like three of them I had the Phantasy Star, the Phantasy Zone and Space Harrier they're really good if it's in the same line
5915424	5916425	Well, these will be 3D.
5916685	5917325	Here's the thing.
5917565	5921027	I'm all about Space Harrier, Super Hang-On, yeah, Sonic, yeah, Altered Beast.
5921107	5929651	Look, Altered Beast is one of those games that is... Everybody remembers that, and in people's memories, it's awesome, but I played through the game not that long ago.
5929891	5930511	It sucks.
5931332	5932672	Altered Beast sucks.
5932812	5933653	I'm sorry to say it.
5934013	5936214	It is not aged well whatsoever.
5936494	5938415	When I was 12, that game was the shit.
5938615	5940116	When I'm 34, not so much.
5940276	5941397	We need a Marvel Madness.
5942077	5943218	We do need a Marvel Madness.
5943238	5943818	That wasn't Sega.
5944318	5945679	I don't care though, it would be awesome.
5946099	5947700	Wasn't it Williams or Midway?
5948381	5949462	It was Atari.
5949802	5950262	Yeah, Atari.
5950802	5954465	Which their arcade division got snapped up by Midway, I believe.
5954485	5955446	I think that's what I'm thinking of.
5956306	5958267	Which in turn then got snapped up by Warner.
5958988	5960849	The game's great if you've got a trackball to play it with.
5962290	5965372	Well, it could do something with the touchpad, who knows.
5966293	5968014	Alright, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
5969039	5970760	Well, as soon as I can get it up, there we go.
5971341	5973903	Gianna Sisters Twisted Dreams developer.
5974363	5975204	We like them, don't we?
5975244	5977946	Because they gave us that wonderful series back, didn't they?
5978906	5979987	It's Black Forest Games.
5980447	5982849	They've announced another game called Ravensdale.
5983370	5989134	It's a four-player co-op side-scrolling platform shooter set in a medieval oil rig city.
5990393	5995897	Looking at the screen capture here, it's pretty grimy, very oily looking.
5997818	6003622	They wanted it to be an action RPG, but publishers were saying that Steampunk doesn't sell.
6004203	6009867	So that's why they are... It looks like they've changed the method of this.
6009887	6011788	I don't know, has anyone else heard anything about this?
6013609	6015490	No, not this particular game.
6015751	6016191	No, it was...
6016519	6021543	Well, there are likelihoods saying that we're going to see a Kickstarter in about a month or two.
6022484	6026007	Since they're not finding a publisher, they're going to go the Gianna Sisters route.
6026727	6029610	But I mean, if judging by Gianna Sisters, it's probably going to be good.
6030471	6032552	So, they got a good track record.
6033673	6034054	Yes, yes.
6034114	6035415	I still need to play that Twisted Dreams.
6035475	6045423	It's one of those games that's like in my queue waiting to play, but I loved the Commodore 64 one, even though, yes, it was kind of the Mario Brothers ripoff, but soundtrack is part of what I remember most fondly, but
6045737	6046539	It's pretty good.
6046859	6049624	I have it downloaded, but I played it like once.
6050606	6052029	And then I went back to Saints Row the 3rd.
6053652	6054714	I did not like Saints Row the 3rd.
6056257	6056838	What's wrong with you?
6058740	6060682	I just didn't like how the game started off.
6060702	6061503	It's so funny.
6062083	6063445	I laughed and laughed.
6063465	6065287	Did you get to the part where they're skydiving out of the plane?
6065707	6068170	You gotta at least get that far, because I died.
6068210	6068970	It was so funny.
6069951	6071673	I just found I didn't like the control, that's all.
6073195	6075557	Alright, I didn't like Mass Effect the first time I played it, just saying.
6077019	6077860	Loki, what do you have for us?
6078765	6087988	So there's some more announcements coming from Japan for the Wii U. First off, the Wii U is now going to be available in white for the 32GB premium set.
6088428	6090249	That's starting July 13th.
6090969	6094370	And I guess it'll be available in black and white since they already have the black to begin with.
6094950	6096771	And then, of course, they're going to be...
6099457	6105761	I guess doing some sort of... And I'm surprised it's taking so goddamn long for this.
6105861	6112304	But they're doing... Well, first they have a larger capacity battery for the Wii U gamepad.
6112485	6116767	So it's going to be 2500 mAh instead of 1500 mAh.
6117127	6122430	Which will, I guess, equal to 5 to 8 hours of gameplay.
6122650	6123771	As opposed to 3 to 5.
6124211	6125012	And then on top of that...
6125512	6133092	They're having official Wii Remote charge battery packs for it.
6134107	6134848	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6157383	6157723	and DarkSakura.
6170503	6174485	Crypt of the NecroDancer Crypt of the NecroDancer
6199942	6207659	It is a rogue-like game, which is, you know, like a dungeon crawler, like if you think way, way, way back to the old Terminal Game Rogue.
6208080	6209764	But it's mixed with a music game.
6211092	6213634	It's a hardcore rhythm-based roguelike.
6215455	6224222	Notable game composers Danny B and Alec Holowaka are working with Crypt of the NecroDancer, which I think is awesome.
6224282	6226523	And you can also load your own MP3s into the game if you want.
6226644	6228065	Although, I don't know how well that will work.
6228605	6229225	But there you go.
6230326	6231627	That looks awesome.
6232068	6236571	And you can check that out at NecroDancer.com Very cool.
6237772	6239233	I like both those types of games.
6239253	6240594	That's like a game made for Rob.
6241058	6242900	Dungeon Crawler meets DDR.
6243060	6243361	Love it.
6245022	6246003	I just need my dance pad.
6246544	6249247	Alright, let's get to our mailbag.
6249307	6253391	Every week you guys send us emails and DarkSakura reads some of her favorites here on the show.
6254292	6258917	In fact, she's got a couple weeks to catch up on with no official show last week and so forth.
6259198	6259338	So...
6261471	6262712	Unfortunately, she was trying to sew.
6262732	6264273	No, one of my stitches came out.
6264333	6266174	It actually broke when I flipped the foot inside out.
6266814	6268235	So, I was trying to fix it real quick.
6268495	6270036	I thought I had time before mailbag.
6270296	6270516	Oh, well.
6271016	6273077	So, a freaking ton of mail.
6274498	6275999	And a lot of it's in Mandarin Chinese.
6276679	6277680	So, let's skip all those.
6277700	6278660	That was the spam.
6279160	6279961	That was the spam.
6280381	6284583	Except for the stuff in French, which I could actually read, but I don't really care about boobs that much.
6284663	6285564	Spam-durin'.
6287771	6288732	Womp womp.
6289612	6292454	So this comes from Rababababa.
6292814	6295855	I noticed the Curiosity game from 22 Kansas approaching the center.
6296476	6300618	Well, there's a countdown on each cube and I believe it was at 13 when I wrote this on Monday.
6300678	6302719	I made my final cynical conclusions about it.
6302759	6303920	Of course, we've already done a big reveal.
6304580	6306400	But I like reading this stuff.
6307240	6310301	It appears the cubes do not get smaller as you get closer to the center.
6310801	6312681	It isn't fun, not even as bubble wrap.
6312721	6316822	It gets boring easily, and after I toyed with it once or twice, I'm content to just see it end.
6317542	6319303	The payoff at the end will be disappointing.
6319363	6321803	The life-changing promise is way too large a nebulous.
6322343	6323643	I love the word nebulous, by the way.
6324283	6326444	I hope the center is remember to drink your Ovaltine.
6327024	6329984	Stay pound zero zero zero zero zero zero.
6330224	6332425	Of course, you know what that is.
6333826	6334326	Stay Black.
6334426	6334827	Stay Black.
6359941	6367226	Then I realized simply Xbox was literally the last name I expected, so they chose the pen's ultimate name of all I could come up with.
6367866	6379674	Overall, the name is pretty good, as it conveys multiple meanings, is easy to remember and understandable, unlike Wii and Wii U, which sound dumb, even repulsive, and conveyed no obvious meaning.
6379994	6382275	I don't expect a lot of debate over what a terrible name 1 is.
6383636	6384817	Does it have good games?
6385237	6386378	At this point, I don't really care.
6387039	6391162	All I know is that there aren't many good games coming out for any system at the moment.
6391642	6400288	They'll stop making games for PS4 and Xbox 360 very soon, and new consoles will be my only choice for new games on console.
6400849	6401289	Used games?
6401349	6405292	If I can't trade or give used games away, I will probably not buy discs at all.
6406013	6408574	I also believe this is how EA will implement Game Pass.
6409455	6410936	The game DVR is interesting.
6411016	6415478	It requires online to share, so I suspect this will be an exclusive gold feature.
6416739	6422382	I also expect that certain games will not be allowed on this feature, even GASP not allow certain parts to be recorded.
6422762	6423963	That's all I'll bug you with today.
6426564	6432067	And this comes from Elliot B. It's the Oculus Rift report.
6433588	6438390	Dear OLR, this week I was lucky enough to get some hands-on time with the most exciting hardware release of the year.
6438970	6442211	No, not the PS4 or Xbox One, I'm of course talking about the Oculus Rift.
6442871	6449213	For those who don't know, the Rift is a VR headset with low-latency head tracking, providing an immersive 3D experience, in theory at least.
6449913	6454935	While the reality doesn't quite yet live up to the hype, it's still an impressive device, even for a prototype.
6455575	6457556	Oculus have got the basics down pat.
6458876	6462337	The headset is easy to set up, weighs nothing, and lag is unnoticeable.
6462878	6467459	Unfortunately, there is still a pretty major issue standing between the Rift and the mainstream success.
6467960	6471921	Movement with standard FPS controls produce instant motion sickness.
6472441	6477223	Even the peaceful Italian villa demo is nauseating, let alone a fast-paced shooter.
6477543	6478604	DarkSakura, you have been warned.
6478744	6479104	Thank you.
6480453	6487238	My thinking is that rather than adapting existing games for the Rift, devs will need to keep in mind its weaknesses as well as strengths.
6487778	6492841	Still experiencing the Rift for the first time is a breathtaking experience, even despite its teething problems.
6493662	6497965	To be any more than a novelty, it now needs some equally breathtaking custom-built games.
6498125	6499706	Yours virtually, Elliot B.
6501274	6501854	Thank you, Elliot.
6501914	6503856	Good lord, everybody, why are you writing me novels?
6504636	6504856	Okay.
6505577	6510040	Dear OLR, I would like to take this moment to thank Microsoft from the bottom of my heart for the Xbox One announcement.
6510380	6515883	The amount of money I'll be saving by skipping their draconian, unattractive Kinect mandatory disaster is enormous.
6516804	6521589	You know, it's funny, I was worried about skipping this generation because I was afraid the PS4 was going to blow major chunks.
6522369	6525232	I even bought a Wii U out of that fear.
6525612	6531698	Instead, it seems Microsoft is going into the junior year slump that seems to happen with any successful console manufacturer.
6532439	6538564	Seriously, first it was Nintendo with the N64, then Sony with the PS3, now Microsoft with the Xbox One.
6538644	6539926	By the way, lamest name ever.
6540586	6542108	We're getting quite a bit of...
6545633	6551715	The PS3, though, it started off like a great comedy of errors, but after a couple of years, it got better and better.
6551735	6552675	It grew into itself.
6552735	6553015	It did.
6553615	6554835	It fits its big boy pants.
6554996	6556736	Nintendo 64 had its moments.
6558016	6560077	I wouldn't call Nintendo 64 a flop.
6560357	6561137	Pokemon Snap.
6562917	6563378	Among others.
6563418	6568879	Well, Mario 64, some in Ocarina of Time, some considered to be the greatest games ever made, so it had that, too.
6570935	6598091	and even Treasure did a couple of games for it and we know what we think of Treasure okay this isn't to say I'll be completely sitting out on gaming hardware this generation obviously I have my Wii U and actually already have a bunch of games for it and I'll be picking up the Retron 5 and Ouya when they're commercially available also since Sony doesn't appear to be restricting used games or mandating internet connections the PS4 seems to be a viable option unless something disastrous turns up at E3
6599358	6605165	Honestly, if Sony isn't looking at the Xbox One and saying, this is what we don't do, I'll be surprised.
6605406	6611213	However, I can say with absolute certainty that I've got more than enough... You know, that was the first typo I found.
6612174	6613516	He said, then and so than.
6614962	6618043	No, I was just thinking I was impressed, so good on you.
6619363	6625565	More than enough gaming ready to go for the next five or so years, and that doesn't include GOG or Humble Bundles.
6626466	6636869	However, almost as troubling as the DRM encumbrance on the Xbox One is Microsoft's continued commitment of trying to pimp the Xbox to people who don't give a crap about video games.
6637549	6641952	Does Microsoft not understand that there are cheaper alternatives for those who want set-top boxes?
6642633	6653020	Seriously, media centers like Boxee and Apple TV are $80 to $100 and modern Blu-ray players are having more and more of those features put into them for about the same price or less.
6653481	6654822	That's ignoring the obvious
6655702	6677120	plug a cheap PC into your television through HDMI option I shit you guys not I can do the whole Netflix YouTube multimedia thing on my Blu-ray player my PS3 my Nexus 7 tablet and my PC and most of those options are also on my Wii U Microsoft goes full bore with the living room takeover thing at their own peril while I hesitate to wish them ill I do hope they're awakened soon
6678301	6679922	Failing that, however, I'm good to go.
6680102	6686267	Emulators on Ouya, Retro Goodness on the Retron 5, and Modern Gaming on the Wii U, and potentially a future on the PS4.
6686667	6691210	And Japanese developers will likely be able to go right back to ignoring Microsoft, and all's right with the world.
6692011	6694012	Anyway, there's my thoughts on the Xbox One.
6694072	6695453	Have I mentioned it's a stupid name?
6695733	6696073	I have.
6696334	6696694	Don't care.
6697054	6697695	It's a stupid name.
6698095	6699196	Seriously, it's worse than Wii.
6699456	6700436	Regards, RollStillUT.
6701337	6706282	Thank you for the best written email I have ever read in my entire life except for your one typo.
6707302	6710045	It's T-H-A-N, not T-H-E-N.
6710125	6711827	And also... That is totally a lie.
6711967	6712527	Well written.
6712767	6713428	Shut up, Rob.
6714389	6714729	No offense.
6714749	6715450	Mr. Kickstartered.
6715770	6716751	No offense to the emailer.
6716951	6717111	No.
6717892	6720855	Well, you know it's my job to completely fuck up everyone's grammar.
6721135	6726360	I think maybe it's a little bit overly cynical, but I will give until E3.
6726580	6727781	Let's see what happens.
6730517	6736740	And just like Bobby said in the chatroom at live.vognetwork.com Sony never said they weren't doing any of that.
6736860	6738100	They just never answered the question.
6738980	6739421	True dat.
6739921	6741641	So, we'll see.
6742362	6744042	They're not going to be able to dodge it much longer.
6744542	6745043	One foot.
6746383	6747383	I have one scale mate foot.
6747643	6748684	In your behind.
6749440	6750061	In your angel butt?
6752103	6754185	Okay, this comes from Jay, who I was hanging out with.
6754605	6757328	And just let me hop back into the chat long enough to keep from getting logged out.
6757809	6758009	Sure.
6758730	6758950	Okay.
6760992	6765697	This email comes from Jay, Jammer Jay, who I was hanging out with on last Monday.
6765877	6767659	Oh, is it gossip all about your experiences?
6767779	6768379	No, it's not.
6768439	6770461	It's pictures of me being sunburned.
6771442	6771523	Um...
6773424	6777048	The highlight of my gaming week was playing DDR with the legendary DarkSakura.
6777108	6777849	Yes, I know.
6778169	6781332	Anyway, she did a fine job for getting back into DDR.
6781412	6785036	I think it's time for Sky and Loki to brush off the rust and join her back into DDR.
6786817	6789378	Played at Roseville Golf Land a couple months ago.
6789479	6792540	I think when Spike and Tim... That show that Spike and Tim were here.
6792580	6793781	We've gone to Golf Land earlier in the week.
6793801	6797343	I have a pile of tokens, which they don't... Which they don't even use anymore.
6797383	6798244	It's all like a card.
6798604	6799524	Maybe you could trade them in.
6799704	6800045	I don't know.
6800365	6801646	I don't think they'll do that.
6802326	6803867	Well, they had to for a certain time.
6805222	6809246	My summer advice for gamers, be sure to have light sunscreen if planning to be out in the sun a bit.
6809346	6810107	Oh, why?
6810768	6821018	Yeah, because the thing is I'm not supposed to wear sunblock at all because I don't make enough vitamin D normally, so I didn't wear any.
6821639	6825743	And then I forgot what humidity and sunlight really does, and I'm still peeling.
6826904	6828865	Anyways, it was nice seeing you again, DarkSakura.
6828945	6829266	Thank you.
6829286	6830186	It was good to see you too.
6830727	6834149	And I look forward to meeting up with Sky and Loki for California DDR one day.
6834229	6838051	Well, we would love to have you out here and you are more than welcome to crash at my place.
6840653	6841693	And last email.
6843325	6843825	Hello all!
6844566	6846847	Just thought I would drop a line to say hello to the gang.
6847467	6852809	I am in the middle of reading an amazing book called Ready Player One, which we've discussed on the show, by Ernest Cline.
6853830	6858192	I know I'm a little late to the party since the book has been out about two years now, but it's so good.
6859056	6864518	So much gaming culture and influence as well as a lot of great pop culture references from the 80s and 90s.
6864898	6865738	I have two questions.
6865918	6867639	To anyone who has read it, what did you think?
6867739	6868299	No spoilers.
6869159	6870720	Which I think we've discussed in depth.
6870880	6871620	I haven't read it yet.
6871640	6872901	I'm going to be borrowing it from Becky, I think.
6873081	6873721	Okay, good.
6873741	6874681	I still haven't read it.
6875862	6879543	I still need to read Catching Fire, y'all, before the movie's out.
6879663	6881844	So I got a long book queue.
6881944	6884744	You don't need to read the book to watch the movie.
6886545	6898892	Yeah, but like when I... See, reading the book makes the movie better because when I went to see The Hunger Games, like every time they changed something from the book, it was like... And then Alan would know that that was something that changed in the book because he could hear me huffing.
6900973	6904514	So the fact that you got pissed off that they changed things in the book made it better?
6904595	6906215	Yes, it made it a more interactive experience.
6907076	6908036	Who won The Hunger Games?
6908457	6908977	I did.
6909697	6910157	You know what?
6911678	6914200	It's kind of funny doing that with Battle Royale now that I've read the book.
6915365	6933975	and seeing how the movie is just complete blood fest and not really political it's very different the manga is great though so anyway I'm only halfway through and my second question is to Loki when you were doing that challenge a while back this was the book you were doing it for wasn't it yes
6934733	6940780	Anyone who hasn't read the book, stop what you were doing after the OLR show, of course, and go pick it up on Kindle or your local bookstore.
6941120	6942362	You will not be disappointed.
6942802	6943783	Keep up the great work.
6943823	6946386	You three make my Monday at office a lot less miserable.
6946506	6948028	Your friend, Travis.
6948068	6949810	You make our Sunday mailbag a lot less miserable.
6949830	6950591	Thank you, Travis.
6950611	6950831	Thank you.
6955422	6982957	and you know there's pictures that Jay sent but I think they're the same ones that he put up on Facebook and they're not wanting to look yeah my butt playing DDR your butt on a DDR machine lol see I'm not showing any of you in the chat room because no all right well as long as you have fun that's what DDR is about because I'm the diva that's why fun uh speaking of diva moments it's time to get into that segment we do here every week on the show where we get a little bit angry
6999566	7028119	F you to smoking in your house and making all of my clothes smell like smoke and then on top of it okay this is me going into some family shit okay my mom smokes in the house her husband smokes in the house while my grandmother has vasculitis and I was reading about just how badly secondhand smoke can aggravate vasculitis aggravate a lot
7028752	7029292	Exactly.
7029372	7034334	And then my mom's like, my mom has asthma, and she's saying that my shampoo is aggravating her asthma.
7034434	7035115	No, it was not.
7035135	7037636	Your smoking is aggravating your damn asthma.
7038656	7041918	When I smoked, I would always go, which was a long time ago, but I would always go outside.
7043278	7044979	Most smokers I knew would do that.
7045919	7046980	Especially in this state.
7047160	7049181	Like, it's illegal to smoke anywhere that's not outside.
7049481	7051762	And most outdoor places are also banned at this point in time.
7052359	7053940	They actually banned it in Daphne.
7054020	7059963	I had the most pleasant experience in a Waffle House that I've ever had in my life because you couldn't smoke inside.
7060684	7061944	You could actually smell your food.
7062024	7063025	It was amazing.
7063625	7065806	Also, I love you, Daphne Waffle House.
7065846	7069508	Your peanut butter waffles are so freaking good.
7069848	7073791	And even though you're kind of racist assholes, Blue Bell Ice Cream, I love your ice cream too.
7075091	7076652	Thank you for the banana pudding ice cream.
7077413	7079714	And also, F you to Attention Horse.
7079734	7079914	Thanks.
7080299	7081300	Three hour show, Jamie.
7081320	7081740	Three hour show.
7081760	7081940	I'm done.
7082020	7082301	All right.
7082721	7083101	Loki.
7083822	7084582	Fuck you to hot.
7085683	7086043	Right?
7086464	7087725	Because it's going to get hot.
7088185	7088625	All right.
7088705	7092508	It was like 95 today or something, and next week it's 105.
7092548	7093049	Fuck that.
7093109	7093289	Nope.
7094169	7094730	I like the winter.
7095010	7095931	Winter, it's cold.
7096011	7096991	You put more layers on.
7097212	7099633	You can only take off so many layers in the summer.
7099774	7100514	It's going to rain.
7100734	7101495	No, it's going to be hot.
7103345	7103625	All right.
7104245	7104546	That's it?
7104686	7105706	That's it.
7105806	7106046	My F.E.
7106086	7108968	of the Week just goes to the whole, like, when it rains, it pours syndrome.
7109388	7110949	I have a lot of good things going on right now.
7110989	7111889	I can't really complain.
7111929	7118292	Like, there's nothing I'm doing where I'm like, argh, I'm so angry about this, which is like, did Robbie bite off more than he could chew?
7118473	7118953	I don't know.
7119353	7131259	But it's actually one of those things where I'm like, okay, when I have some days off next week, I have some time to catch up on some things, then I can go have fun in L.A., even though I'll have to be driving down there by myself, but...
7131772	7132373	Thanks for watching!
7152344	7162791	Okay, let's get to a couple more news stories for you guys and then Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR and the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
7162931	7164432	Not just yet though, a couple more stories.
7164772	7166914	Yes, unfortunately we got some depressing stories.
7166974	7171517	The first being that unfortunately there was a tragic event that happened this week.
7172117	7180503	One of the engineers for the Oculus Rift, Andrew Scott Reese, was killed in a
7181563	7185985	Basically, a hit and run during a police chase.
7186706	7192048	He was crossing the street in a crosswalk and got hit by a car that the police were chasing and killed.
7195222	7196243	That's awful.
7196283	7196624	That sucks.
7196764	7198085	Especially after we just had an email.
7198105	7199407	Yeah, after that email and everything.
7199507	7199967	It's crazy.
7199987	7208837	I mean, what's really horrible about that is it's like, you know, dude was crossing the street and... Well, didn't it happen to Gunpei... Fuck, I can't remember his name.
7208857	7209618	The dead Metroid?
7209838	7212401	I think he died in a car accident.
7212681	7214263	I thought he was getting out of a car and got hit.
7214423	7216464	He, yeah, yeah, yeah, that sounds familiar.
7216524	7218205	It's on Wikipedia somewhere.
7218806	7220166	But yeah, it was really sad.
7220727	7225490	And it's just, you know, obviously people, car accidents happen every day and we lose great people.
7225510	7228751	And people, pedestrians get hit every day, unfortunately, and we lose great people.
7228811	7235295	It just, it just really sucks that A, this was such a great, you know, young mind that was inventing these things that everybody wanted to play.
7235696	7237577	And B, totally preventable.
7238317	7240139	This guy was not at fault.
7240539	7244903	He wasn't crossing the street in a drug-induced stupor or something.
7244983	7247405	He was hit by a guy who was running from the police.
7247765	7248726	Totally preventable.
7249186	7250587	It's awful.
7251548	7252089	It's awful.
7253470	7255431	But what can you do?
7256653	7258674	When it's time to go, you're gonna go.
7258694	7260316	You know?
7260356	7260636	You know?
7262162	7265344	But at the same time, it's important not to...
7283823	7291725	If there's a police chase going and there's cars with sirens coming your way, you can hear those sirens and, you know, you always want to look.
7291885	7295426	Especially when I'm driving and stuff, even though there's a green light, I'm always looking.
7295446	7300728	I give it a couple seconds before I go because there's always someone that's not paying attention that's going to run the light.
7301008	7305049	So you've got to be defensive and always kind of keep your eye out, even though it may be green or something.
7305289	7306569	I remember, actually, it was funny.
7306589	7312831	The last time I went to E3, even, a bus ran out of control and smashed into a Walgreens.
7313411	7313912	Thanks for watching!
7329813	7331955	All right, so here's the deal with Gunpei Yokoi.
7332356	7335759	And if you don't know that name, he's the guy who produced... He worked for Nintendo for a long time.
7336179	7339363	Producer of Kid Icarus and Metroid, which is huge right there.
7339423	7341004	Designed Rob the Robot.
7341044	7342266	Designed the Game Boy.
7342886	7343647	So you all know that one.
7344007	7349313	Yes, he designed the Virtual Boy 2, for which, you know, there was a lot of shame that came with that, and he left Nintendo, but...
7349873	7352734	They say that he had always planned to leave Nintendo at a certain age.
7353454	7355215	Virtual Boy was not the reason for that.
7355295	7361717	Well, unfortunately, in 1997, he was in a fender bender accident where he rear-ended a truck.
7362097	7365338	He got out of the car to inspect the damage, because, you know, same thing happens here, right?
7365378	7367359	You take the pictures, send them to the insurance company, all that stuff, right?
7367899	7369080	And the passing cars hit him.
7370240	7372061	Yeah, I remembered it was something like that.
7372081	7373441	It's similar-ish, yeah.
7373561	7374821	It's very tragic.
7375561	7376462	Yeah, and Yokoi.
7376882	7379162	I knew it was Yoke, but I didn't remember.
7379182	7379703	Yeah.
7381223	7381543	All right.
7381823	7392746	Well, I hope... I really, really hope this story doesn't have a sad ending, but, you know, somebody in the gaming community is missing right now, and his name... I'm hoping...
7393306	7393806	DarkSakura.com
7409136	7436262	and he was missing in the Vancouver area his bike and helmet were found in Stanley Park but before he left he closed his Twitter account his Xbox Live account reportedly he left his wallet, computer and phone at home and there's really just not a lot of information unfortunately they have been assembling groups in Vancouver to try and find him unfortunately no luck yet I think they were going to search the Waters area next
7436642	7437643	I mean, don't know.
7437763	7440565	He could have... So he took himself off the grid.
7441485	7442006	Essentially.
7442146	7443667	And who knows where he could have gone.
7444127	7447669	Hopefully, he is safe and sound somewhere.
7448150	7452492	Just, you know, for whatever reason, just got away.
7452973	7456775	But I highly doubt he would be listening to this podcast.
7456835	7460618	But if by some strange string of luck he was...
7461638	7463479	A lot of folks miss you, dude.
7464179	7465899	Please call your family.
7466700	7470141	And a lot of people are out looking for this guy, and they really miss him.
7470181	7478663	So if you are in the Vancouver area, please... Even I would say, honestly, if you're in the Pacific Northwest at all, honestly, he could be anywhere at this point.
7478723	7481324	It's not that hard to get on a plane and go somewhere else.
7481884	7483765	or get in a car and go somewhere.
7483785	7484505	He could be in the US.
7484665	7484986	Who knows?
7485626	7487687	FindKnuckles.com is the place to go.
7487727	7489348	That's Knuckles like Sonic and Knuckles.
7489708	7490808	FindKnuckles.com.
7491449	7494550	This guy, by the way, you might have seen his work in the gaming community before.
7494670	7500933	He was pretty well known because he got the one achievement a day on the 360 for like three years.
7501213	7503074	He was really big in the Xbox achievements community.
7503875	7504915	I know I heard his name before.
7504955	7507256	I think he was working with other indie podcasts.
7507276	7508457	I know he did stuff with Rooster Teeth.
7508897	7513900	So, um, I hope they find them and I hope, uh, I hope all as well.
7515421	7515701	Okay.
7516161	7518883	Uh, that was two really horrible stories back to back.
7518903	7523965	I'm sorry we have to end on that note, but, uh, you know, we want to do our due diligence and get some puppies and kittens.
7524205	7529488	Could you, we just need, we need like a kitten playing video or something to play the baby monkey writing backwards on a pig song.
7529728	7531209	Is there a, okay, hold on.
7532190	7534431	It's literally, it's called baby monkey writing backwards on a pig.
7536647	7539089	this will make us feel a little better that will make us feel better yes it will
7556695	7557696	1-877-GAME-OLR.
7557776	7558296	Cheer me up.
7558316	7562337	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
7562657	7568539	If you want to give us a call and comment on anything you've heard about on the show or maybe you didn't hear about on the show tonight but you want to.
7568579	7574561	Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
7574881	7576482	Meanwhile, we will get to Twitter topics.
7576602	7577442	I got to pull those up.
7577582	7580203	Loki, do we have any last minute news while we're working on that?
7581341	7587947	There's a Kickstarter for some sort of vest haptic device or something that they're trying to get off the ground.
7588428	7601299	It's supposed to be the as-close-as-it-gets Kickstarter, and it's like this thing that's supposed to tie in with first-person shooters and stuff like that to make it more immersive, where you actually feel like the bullets are hitting you and stuff.
7601519	7603000	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7623976	7624296	Ragingator
7645903	7650167	Oh, that makes me feel better.
7650267	7651208	It's a kitty.
7651608	7652769	Wait, put it back on the cat.
7653209	7653870	I don't want to see you.
7653890	7654611	I want to see the cat.
7655912	7656292	Thank you.
7656712	7657093	Much better.
7657193	7657833	What's kitty's name?
7660175	7661597	Oh, that's a good name.
7661657	7661977	All right.
7663738	7666481	Hopefully that will be better than the Anakin that was in episodes one through three.
7666521	7667301	What's on your mind tonight?
7668362	7669683	Um, not a whole lot.
7670124	7670224	Um,
7671375	7675316	Just kind of a generic question for tonight.
7677117	7685479	Is there any upcoming games that have been announced that you're possibly looking forward to?
7686520	7700804	And not only that, but as a secondary question, if you have a wish list or something that you would love to see on Steam, like if it was you see on Steam right now,
7701730	7705011	You know, I stole that money for that game and said, buy it.
7706192	7706892	Like anything?
7706912	7709733	Or are you talking about like ports from consoles or something like that?
7710573	7712514	You know, either or.
7712594	7714674	Whatever direction you would like to take the question.
7714995	7725438	Well, I would point you to the OLR Dream Games page on the OLR Wiki because things like WhatTheyPlay.com, Snap, those still have not come to fruition and I think we'd like to see some of those.
7726399	7730060	But on a serious note, things that are on console that I would like to see on Steam...
7731040	7733823	I could be a total fanboy and say Mario, which also wouldn't happen, but
7754560	7757084	Then again, on the keyboard, it wouldn't be the same experience.
7757785	7758786	So, I don't know.
7758806	7759727	I'd have to think about that one.
7759947	7761349	You guys, anything that jumps to your mind?
7761369	7762411	We'll come back to your other question though.
7762731	7763633	Anything that jumps to your mind?
7763693	7765255	Something that isn't on Steam that ought to be?
7767540	7793045	there's so many things that I could come up with to make the list especially in this short of a show let me check in with DarkSakura and Loki I want SNES collections like Genesis collections even better, TurboGrafx I want the revamped Dracula X Alien Crush HD I want to see the whole Crush series up through Jackie Crush Loki?
7793065	7793405	Minecraft
7795868	7797369	You just won Minecraft in Steam.
7797409	7797830	Makes sense.
7797850	7798350	It'd be cool.
7798450	7799991	I run my Minecraft through Steam.
7800652	7802073	I guess it can be done.
7802113	7802814	Yeah, you can do that.
7802834	7805175	All right, let's get to the meatier question that Ragenator asked.
7805215	7808278	What are you personally looking forward to this year, if anything?
7808658	7809138	Let me guess.
7809219	7810179	Loki, Saints Row 4.
7810359	7813822	Grand Theft Auto V. Oh, of course.
7813842	7814322	Both.
7814383	7815123	Come on, both.
7816084	7816464	Is that it?
7817045	7818526	And Earth Defense Force 2025.
7819366	7819647	Okay.
7820167	7821088	And the new Call of Duty.
7822355	7825937	For me, the Kingdom Hearts 1.5 remix is something I'm definitely looking forward to.
7826037	7827678	Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn.
7828158	7832060	So I know I'm sounding like a total Square Enix fanboy, but it is what it is.
7832140	7835922	Disney Infinity, although I'm totally expecting that game to be a flop.
7836282	7842306	That whole collectible figurine thing, I have to admit, if I'm going to get into a Skylanders game, it's going to be this one.
7842626	7843266	You know what?
7843286	7844327	I'm cautiously optimistic.
7844347	7845487	I actually do have to tell you something.
7846047	7850810	Julian does not have any Skylanders games, but he has toys that he plays with.
7851345	7854308	There are people that collect Disney commemorative plates.
7854709	7855630	They will buy this game.
7855910	7857031	People will buy this game.
7857231	7858152	It's not going to matter.
7858693	7859974	It's not going to flop.
7860795	7865780	I'm still holding hope that Phantasy Star Online 2 will make it out this year at some point, although I'm losing hope.
7866421	7867782	E3 is kind of the make or break for that.
7869664	7872447	I kind of want to see the South Park Stick of Truth game, too.
7873808	7894275	the toilet humor potty humor guy in me wants to see that Pokemon X and Y believe it or not I'm loving what it looks like the revamp battle system is going to be or not system but the graphics and everything and how they're making everything 3D it looks really cool I don't usually get into the Pokemon games quite as much as other people I know like Shane but if there's going to be one that's going to win me over it'll probably be X and Y
7895721	7896942	How about you, Spazinator?
7896982	7898002	What do you want this year?
7898022	7899463	What can't you wait for?
7899503	7908628	Well, stuff that would probably run on my PPS computer, probably Magic 2014.
7908948	7911469	Of course, of course.
7912430	7917892	Yeah, well, that's probably one of the few upcoming games that will run on my computer for sure.
7918053	7918293	Yeah.
7919309	7924536	Some of the other stuff, like GTA 5, I know for damn sure it won't run on my computer.
7925918	7933487	If I were to go replace my consoles, I may go get that, but it's not really within my budget right now, but...
7935054	7938115	The short answer is just the next Magic the Gallery.
7938715	7939235	Fair enough.
7939275	7939635	You know what?
7939655	7942996	There's sometimes those reliable series, and we're always waiting for the next entry in them.
7943316	7945477	Some people only get Madden every single year.
7945557	7951899	And if we were like 10 years ago, I would have said, oh, whatever new DDR game is coming out this year.
7951919	7952939	That's what I'm looking forward to.
7953079	7954119	But times have changed.
7954479	7954719	All right.
7955280	7956900	Ragenator, I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls.
7956920	7957760	But take care, buddy, okay?
7958440	7959041	Yep, you too.
7959061	7959381	Take care.
7959501	7959741	Bye.
7960709	7962470	Oh, and bye to Anakin as well, if you hear that.
7962490	7966591	1-877-GAME-OLR or use his name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
7967711	7972353	We didn't get a lot of Twitter topics tonight, but I will read this one from Tigerclaw, because this does look interesting.
7972373	7973013	I didn't know about this.
7974174	7979375	Tigerclaw tweets us, the Tetris creator, Alexey Pajitnov, I totally said that wrong.
7979415	7980996	I haven't heard that guy's name in a long time.
7981336	7985657	But he created Tetris, and he came out with a new mobile phone game.
7985697	7987118	This is where everybody go on iOS.
7987578	7989659	It's an iOS game called Marbly.
7990419	7996142	It's the first title he's ever designed exclusively for a mobile device and that you play with colored balls.
7996422	7997382	Hence the name Marbly.
7998182	7998383	What?
7998803	7999923	Are they blue?
8000103	8002524	Okay, someone had to go the five-year-old route.
8002544	8004585	Why are you giggling over there when I mentioned balls?
8004765	8005045	All right.
8005506	8006646	Because balls are funny.
8006806	8007527	Balls are funny.
8007767	8009748	Let's go to the phones and see who's there.
8009928	8011268	Oh, another video call.
8011308	8011728	I'm loving this.
8012009	8012269	Hi.
8012469	8014089	I love your shirt and I want it.
8014270	8016511	Take it off and send it to me now.
8017971	8019732	Your chest is impressive.
8019752	8021574	Keep it on for the rest of this call, please.
8021634	8022214	It's a family show.
8022234	8023015	You guys are cheating me.
8023035	8023975	I don't see you on video.
8024456	8025296	I know.
8025616	8027998	Well, you've heard how many times the stream has gone down tonight.
8028038	8029079	We can't afford the upload.
8029759	8030960	Who is this for the listeners?
8031881	8032481	This is Osfer.
8032621	8033022	Hi, Osfer.
8033042	8033562	How are you doing?
8034903	8035543	I'm pretty good.
8036064	8039606	You mentioned earlier about how you were really getting into the Wii U virtual console.
8039706	8040006	Yeah.
8041658	8041738	I, uh...
8064522	8071492	I also went and I got Mega Man X because, I don't know, a lot of people seem to really be into the series.
8071532	8074896	I've never played Mega Man X before, but I've played the other games.
8075778	8076999	Now's a great time to catch up.
8078826	8080207	Yeah, it seems pretty good.
8080387	8084289	I'm pretty bad at Mega Man games in general, too, but I have a lot of fun things.
8084569	8086170	I like the dashing and stuff like that.
8086370	8090252	Well, a lot of Mega Man games are really freaking hard, too.
8090932	8092933	You say, I'm not that good at Mega Man games.
8093353	8096074	Nobody is that good at Mega Man games, but you learn.
8096174	8096515	You learn.
8096575	8097135	You get better at them.
8097870	8104333	Yeah, I was actually really mad earlier because I was fighting some mini-boss against... I can't remember the robot's name.
8104353	8105553	It was some electrical guy.
8105813	8107654	And I couldn't even beat the freaking mini-boss.
8107814	8109475	I was getting so angry.
8109555	8110696	And then I fight the actual boss.
8110716	8113317	I'm like, wow, that was the easiest thing I'm going to fight.
8113977	8115117	What did you think of Super Metroid?
8117098	8118659	Well, I actually own it on Super Nintendo.
8118879	8119839	So I've played it before.
8119859	8120400	Yeah, yeah.
8120420	8121620	There you go.
8121660	8122981	But you're very...
8124656	8152586	you're very well thought out and it being your favorite game ever because it is pretty amazing that is the right answer sir I will side with you in your whole Chrono Trigger debate that I think Super Metroid is a far better game than Chrono Trigger it's comparing apples and oranges though I don't care how many times you F5 the site tonight you get a gold star for that comment if you're comparing RPGs Chrono Trigger is up at the top next to Final Fantasy 6 but action games
8154524	8160228	Okay, Jamie, in the RPG department, I will say that I like Chrono Cross better than Chrono Trigger.
8160488	8162029	But if we're sticking to just SNES?
8164511	8165272	Just SNES?
8165532	8165872	Yeah.
8166112	8169635	Final Fantasy VI versus Chrono Trigger, I think, is the great SNES debate.
8169955	8170515	Oh, okay.
8170555	8172897	Well, for me, then that would be Super Mario RPG.
8174891	8175871	Actually, good answer.
8176011	8177332	Fair answer, fair answer.
8178152	8180413	Also, you mentioned this shirt earlier.
8180673	8180893	Yes.
8181353	8184474	You can tell because it's like backwards, but it's the Symphony of the Goddesses shirt.
8184534	8185715	It's not backwards on our end.
8186015	8186935	It's not backwards on our end.
8186975	8188335	I guess the camera flips properly.
8188355	8188875	Yeah, that's weird.
8189096	8189736	Yeah, we see it.
8191576	8193557	Yeah, on my end, it is backwards, so I'm like...
8194501	8195943	That's weird.
8196303	8198606	Have you guys made it out to see Symphony of the Goddesses yet?
8198626	8200568	No, but I want to.
8200728	8203231	But you know what I said earlier about a lot of stuff going on?
8203251	8204672	Yeah.
8205493	8205733	I think...
8207042	8207362	What was that?
8207382	8207843	Sunshine.
8207883	8210866	I think he mentioned something about it coming back to California soon.
8211246	8215590	I believe I heard it's going to be in Oakland or somewhere in the East Bay soon.
8215790	8219074	And I honestly think it was like early June.
8219374	8220895	It's probably when I'm in L.A.
8222717	8223358	Just my luck.
8223898	8224559	Just my luck.
8225160	8225400	All right.
8225740	8228563	Well, as for anything you want to share with our listeners tonight, anything else?
8230447	8231768	That's about it.
8231808	8233088	All your listeners should go drink coffee.
8233228	8233888	That's what they should do.
8236709	8238009	But don't drink crappy coffee.
8238149	8240370	Oh, you're drinking coffee right now.
8240410	8241270	There we go.
8241530	8246992	Your mug is like the size of mine, except mine says the queen is not accepting an audience today.
8248272	8248552	Oh, yeah.
8248592	8250393	This is just like some cheap Walmart mug.
8250433	8250853	I don't know.
8250973	8253133	And it's Starbucks blonde dress, so it's pretty good.
8253153	8253793	I like Starbucks.
8253913	8254714	There you go.
8254754	8256274	All right, Osprey, you take care.
8256334	8256814	Have a good night.
8257054	8257574	Thanks for calling.
8257634	8258975	All right, you too.
8258995	8259615	All right, bye.
8261178	8262959	Everybody's beautiful in their own unique way.
8263039	8263659	Everybody's beautiful.
8288368	8289549	Was that, who was that?
8289569	8290810	That was Ray Stevens, wasn't it?
8291010	8291350	Was it?
8291570	8292051	I think so.
8292191	8292491	I don't know.
8292611	8303659	You know, it's funny, I told, when I was on the way back to Gulfport to get on the plane, I texted Dan from Pascagoula, so he asked if there were Skrulls going berserk, because that was another Ray Stevens song.
8305280	8306781	You guys are such nerds.
8306941	8307321	So?
8307621	8309603	Alright, let's go to another call.
8310323	8312004	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
8312024	8313725	This is Legend of Zaku here.
8313825	8316327	Three video calls in a row, look at that.
8316667	8317268	What's up, Zaku?
8318632	8323559	Nothing much, just trying to stay dry, high and dry right now with all this thunder outside.
8323579	8324480	I've already heard a few rumbles.
8334375	8340678	Which, by the way, I hope everybody's... I know Codeman lives in Oklahoma, so I checked in with him earlier in the week.
8340778	8345140	I don't know who else of our listenership is in that area affected by the tornadoes, but I hope y'all are okay.
8345220	8347181	I hope your stuff's hooked up to surge protectors, too.
8347641	8350002	Oh my god, he's got a shirt I want!
8351283	8352784	I freaking love Dream Theater.
8353004	8353564	Oh my god.
8355425	8356906	Dream Theater's freaking awesome.
8358317	8363759	Alright, Zaku, surely you did not just call in tonight to get complimented by DarkSakura, although I wouldn't blame you if you did.
8364059	8364959	What's on your mind tonight?
8366180	8373422	Well, I guess, well, to put it bluntly, I think we're approaching the next video game crash.
8374142	8384906	Now, call me cynical, but if you look at the rumblings of how Microsoft announced to the world about the Xbox One, how they're basically...
8386841	8393185	You're not getting a straight answer from them regarding used games since each answer is contradicting one another.
8393646	8407334	Kind of like Heisenberg's rule of uncertainty principle where if you study something long enough its properties change dynamically so it keeps shifting around.
8409595	8413998	In other words, you're still left with so many unopened questions and
8415444	8418325	and it's getting to the point where we don't own things anymore.
8418385	8427987	It's kind of like the Steam model being pigeonholed into the console even though it's not the appropriate medium.
8428347	8433908	Wait, do you blame Steam for what Xbox... Let's say worst case scenario is true with Xbox One.
8434208	8435388	Do you blame Steam for that?
8435488	8439789	Do you think that everybody's looking at Steam going, well, they get away with digital downloads?
8440149	8444430	Well, I mean, it's expected that a console which for the...
8445330	8446691	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8469443	8471784	is physical, it's tangible.
8471904	8485651	Even though they do exist as game downloads and that's already accepted as a standard where you only own the license to that particular digital copy.
8486131	8492214	But if you buy something tangible, wouldn't you expect that the first sale doctrine would apply to it?
8493620	8494741	I'm not going to disagree with Zaku.
8494981	8495741	Wait, hold on, hold on.
8495782	8496342	Zaku, Zaku, Zaku.
8496622	8498323	I'm not going to disagree.
8498363	8499344	Zaku, hello?
8500824	8501945	Zaku, Earth to Zaku.
8502105	8502865	Come in, Zaku.
8503266	8504206	Zaku, stop talking.
8504326	8505767	All right, Zaku, I've got to ask you this.
8506628	8511951	Because I want to play devil's advocate, and this is important, because you say that we expect something tangible.
8512211	8513271	I'm not going to disagree with you.
8513652	8514892	I like having the tangibleness.
8515312	8519275	I've been very disappointed that manuals are going away, and instead we're getting these inserts.
8519295	8519595	Me too.
8519915	8520055	N64 N64 N64
8541894	8543015	Yes, that is true.
8543135	8553863	However, even with the disc error, starting with PlayStation and anything slightly earlier than that, you're able to lend it out to anybody, to your friends.
8554404	8559007	Now, all of a sudden, Microsoft wants to impose paying for that game all over again.
8559708	8565952	I mean, when you buy something, you're presuming, it's pretty much common presumption that
8566773	8568254	You pretty much own it.
8568494	8570974	You're able to do what you want to lend it out.
8571375	8575136	But in this case, for the Xbox One, it's a much tighter grip.
8575836	8576396	It's equity.
8576716	8580398	It's equity on your value.
8580478	8583139	Like this huge wall of DVDs I'll never watch.
8583239	8584359	They at least have equity.
8584439	8587440	I could get 50 cents at a dimple or something.
8588260	8616207	which is a local chain that buys these things per those discs it's like a house you buy a house and then you sell it for hopefully more money later on it's like a car you buy it and then you hopefully can sell it later on and I know a lot of people are saying a video game is different than a car but until now our games have had equity and now we're saying we might lose that and that is not good when you're asking me to pay $60 for a game that will be worth zero when I try to resell it
8616627	8617108	Don't know.
8617128	8617508	It's a rumor.
8617528	8617808	It's a rumor.
8636570	8638431	It's an exchange, so to speak.
8638871	8644612	It's almost similar to how the Yankees basically opted out of StubHub to create their own ticket exchange.
8645012	8653675	Up until last year, me and my girl were able to get home tickets for really good seats at below face value.
8654415	8655836	and I think this is what's happening.
8656096	8665643	They're taking the same approach where they want to cut out any other middleman and basically set their own terms and set their own prices for certain games.
8665983	8668385	Holy crap, I just saw lightning in the background.
8668425	8669346	That was crazy.
8669366	8670046	Did you guys see that?
8670386	8671967	Like totally flashed in his window there.
8672328	8672688	Sorry.
8672748	8675890	Yeah, it's definitely the... This is why we don't do a video show.
8675930	8676771	I get too distracted.
8677011	8678652	There's something shiny behind you!
8679352	8680132	Something shiny!
8694878	8695659	DarkSakura.com
8717622	8725549	Well, yeah, that too, and then mobile, which those issues were never a moot point to begin with.
8725689	8728332	I mean, they were never an issue to begin with.
8728972	8735739	I mean, everything on mobile is pretty much digital, so it's the same rules that apply to PC.
8736700	8743145	And if it turns out that Sony's basically pulling the same tricks as Microsoft, then
8744046	8753220	and God help them if they find a way to spin it really well, better than what Microsoft was able to, then yeah, there might be a crash long overdue.
8753260	8757886	It might even happen a lot sooner if they flop at the end of the year or early next.
8758607	8759689	People will still clutch
8760410	8763872	to their existing 360s and PS3s like myself.
8764172	8769794	I hope it's not an all-out crash because I know a lot of people in the industry that would be affected.
8770675	8776398	As I said, I may have exaggerated when saying crash without adding context and scope.
8777018	8779979	It will be a crash with traditional consoles.
8780479	8787783	Mobile and any other casual aspects of gaming will be unscathed because they appeal to a broader audience.
8789639	8789919	All right.
8790379	8792120	Zaku, I got to let you go so we can wrap up the show.
8792140	8793161	But thank you for your opinion.
8793561	8793881	Take care.
8794561	8794841	Bye.
8795582	8795962	You too.
8796122	8796902	Don't get hit by lightning.
8797503	8797763	All right.
8798103	8801584	I love when we get like really in-depth discussion like that, though.
8801744	8802345	Yeah, yeah.
8802425	8807787	Zaku does, you know, love Zaku or hate him when he gets on his train where he won't let me talk.
8808548	8809628	But he's very passionate.
8809768	8810408	And I love that.
8810528	8811709	I love all your guys' passion.
8811729	8812869	That's what this show is all about.
8812990	8813510	All you guys.
8814370	8815991	And I love Utada Hikaru's passion.
8816531	8817352	I do, it's a good song.
8817452	8818292	Yes it is.
8818392	8821735	Thank you guys for putting up with our internet up and down fuckery tonight.
8821775	8822715	We really appreciate it.
8823596	8824677	We'll be back next week.
8824757	8826558	Next week is the big pre-E3 show.
8826838	8829520	That is the week to lock in our predictions and guess what guys?
8829960	8836585	You know we gotta use this as an excuse to bring back Listless and the thing we most wanna happen, wanna see happen at E3 2013.
8837105	8838146	So be thinking about it now.
8838966	8841428	We'll be back one week from tonight to do all that.
8841688	8843549	But in the meantime, it's time to end tonight's show.
8844790	8850373	I just wanted to let you know that there was a mention of a very old joke when I was hanging out with Jammer J. Oh God.
8850714	8851514	Pantsless Rage.
8851574	8852334	Of course, of course.
8852374	8852795	Alright, look.
8853595	8856757	Loki, any other last minute stories before we wrap it up and say print?
8856977	8857958	Yeah, Shadow Warrior.
8858458	8859659	You remember it's being remade?
8859699	8862520	Well, the classic is available free on Steam forever.
8863041	8864041	So go play it.
8864241	8867703	And then finally, the Super Mario Bros.
8867783	8871285	movie has celebrated its 20th anniversary.
8873647	8873947	That's it.
8874907	8875227	Alright.
8876088	8887397	Oh, and one other thing that Steam does better than the Xbox One, the Alan Wake series on the Xbox 360 right now is $20.
8888278	8888758	$4 on Steam.
8889799	8894062	That's why people don't mind DRM, because you can get a series of games for $4.
8894163	8899387	Or the Humble Bundle, where you can get the entire franchise, like 20 games for $5.
8899447	8899647	Alright.
8903670	8907352	Alright, that is going to do it there for another episode of Orange Lawns Radio.
8907472	8917377	Thank you guys very much for tuning into our show, whether it be live and putting up with the connection issues or listening on the podcast feed, taking the time out to download us or through an app like TuneIn or Stitcher or one of those.
8917437	8919858	We really appreciate it no matter how you listen to the show.
8920018	8923180	And I would like to give a shout out to somebody who said she would be downloading the show.
8923980	8925821	To Blue Sigma from Tumblr.
8926201	8927502	More people that I don't know.
8928001	8928842	Thanks for watching!
8949055	8950916	So just spread the word about our show.
8950956	8951416	That's all we have.
8951436	8953517	Don't spam, but spread the word about our show.
8953557	8954097	Tell a friend.
8954837	8956758	Tell somebody who might appreciate what we're doing here.
8957018	8958899	And spread the love of independent podcasting.
8958959	8963680	If you think our show is shit, then thank you for at least listening to the whole thing before you decided it was shit.
8964060	8966161	Go download another great independent podcast.
8966181	8968022	There's lots of great content producers out there.
8968282	8970303	We've got a whole ton of them here at the Voice of Geeks Network.
8970343	8976205	Everybody from Bobby Blackwolf, Understation Live, Girls Gone Wild, Anime Jam Session, PodCulture.
8976245	8976785	Everybody, everybody.
8977185	8977726	E3.vognetwork.com
8996282	8997844	And I think that's really it.
8998344	9000006	Now we can go around and get everybody's final thought.
9000366	9005690	So my final thought tonight, I'll start, is that it's time to check in for my airline because I want a good seat.
9006471	9007472	Loki, your final thought tonight.
9007872	9008733	AC's not working.
9009594	9009714	Boo.
9011240	9015942	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9040471	9046776	And when I am done with him, hopefully, because I never sleep, so it might be tonight, I will post pictures up.
9046976	9047856	Are they happy feet?
9049097	9051339	They're kind of deflated because they have no stuffing.
9051779	9054961	But I could put them on my fingers and pretend they're real feet.
9055862	9056302	See, look.
9057082	9058043	Real feet.
9058844	9060325	You need a little picture of that for OLR.com.
9060365	9061846	I am scale mate feet.
9061966	9062746	Little pictures of your happy feet.
9062766	9067389	I think I'm going to name my scale mate Sir No Stuffing or something.
9067409	9067569	Okay.
9068510	9068770	All right.
9068950	9069811	I'll name him Stouffer.
9070272	9071152	Okay, that's it.
9071272	9071753	We're done.
9071893	9072453	We're out of here.
9072754	9074075	Thank you guys very much for tuning in.
