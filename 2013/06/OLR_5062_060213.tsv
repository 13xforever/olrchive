19000	22000	Blizzard postpones its next MMO.
22000	27000	And could legendary buried game cartridges in the desert soon be unearthed?
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	37000	Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	47000	It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 506, 2nd Mix, J-Append for this June 2, 2013.
47000	49000	I'll explain the title in a minute here.
49000	52000	But welcome back to the show everybody, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers?
52000	55000	Can we call this one a go-to mix instead?
55000	56000	Whatever you want it to be.
56000	58000	Can we have true kiss destination?
58000	59000	No.
59000	60000	Club append!
60000	62000	They weren't that good, let's be real.
62000	64000	Well, if their career didn't last that long.
64000	66000	Dreams come true lasted longer than them.
66000	68000	Also say hello to Techmaster Loki.
68000	69000	Hi.
69000	70000	Hi, how you doing, Loki?
70000	71000	Pretty good.
71000	81000	Excellent. And of course, my name is Rob Roberts and we do join you live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of the Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
81000	83000	Alright, so last week was a little weird.
83000	85000	We weren't actually here live on Sunday.
85000	89000	We did a special show earlier in the week which we called episode number 506.
89000	91000	But then it was brought to my attention.
91000	99000	You're gonna ruin all the like tracking of the classic game of the week and all these segments you usually do if you give a special episode a regular episode number.
99000	100000	So, I broke it.
100000	104000	Just put a blank in there. How damn hard is that?
104000	105000	Give it a letter.
105000	106000	It's fine.
106000	107000	It's episode R.
107000	110000	We'll just have 506, 2nd Mix.
110000	113000	It's a do-over. We'll do it live.
113000	116000	Because it's not an episode unless I'm here, let's face it.
116000	119000	So, episode 2 was not an episode?
119000	124000	No, it wasn't. That was when I was sleeping in the Harry Potter room at the Gay Frat House.
124000	127000	Alright, so last week you were in Alabama, right?
127000	128000	Yes.
128000	130000	And you were taking care of mostly some family stuff.
130000	131000	Yes.
131000	135000	But you did get to hang out with like you met like at least one OLR listener, right?
135000	142000	I got to hang out with Jammer Jay who I have known for quite some time and there's a little bit of background.
142000	149000	About 10 years ago we met up and played DDR together and I got his games and I think I got him like dinner.
149000	157000	So, this time he paid for my games and got me dinner and took me to McGuire's in Pensacola and I got shit-faced.
158000	165000	I drank, okay, McGuire's is like a small microbrewery and they do their own stouts and porters.
165000	171000	I had a good porter, but then they served me this drink called an Irish Wake that's very green and served in a mason jar and I consumed it.
171000	173000	And I was very dizzy the rest of the ride.
173000	182000	And then I got a sunburn in the shape, well my tan line is in the shape of a seatbelt because we were riding in a convertible and I stopped caring about the sun.
182000	192000	So, but we did go to Pace, Florida and play a lot of DDR and played some Addams Family pinball at another arcade at the Pensacola beach.
192000	201000	And then I ran into, I spent some time with my mama's son and papa's son and their roommates Kristen and Bobby, a different Bobby of course.
201000	205000	And I got to see Derek who is one of my very good friends.
205000	207000	And all these people none of our listeners know.
207000	212000	And my good friend Donovan who, they're both fixtures at Dragon Con, you may run into them.
212000	217000	And I got to see my very good friend Jen, she picked me up when my flight was changed from Gulfport to Mobile.
217000	220000	Do not get me started on American Airlines because fuck them.
220000	225000	I heard about your drama going, I'm on an airplane tomorrow and you have me a little worried.
225000	227000	Are you doing American?
227000	228000	No.
228000	229000	Good, fuck them.
229000	231000	Well who owns US Air now, that's United right?
231000	235000	I don't know, yeah I rode United back and I had no problem.
235000	240000	They even had a movie and they had snack boxes that had Nutella in them.
240000	243000	So fuck you American Airlines, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.
243000	248000	At least they're refunding me 75 bucks in toiletries and clothes that I had to buy.
248000	252000	Guess what I found at Goodwill in Alabama, in Daphne, Alabama.
252000	257000	I found a Charlie the Unicorn shirt that says sparkle, sparkle, sparkle, sparkle on it.
257000	259000	I don't care if I can wear it or not.
259000	262000	Is there a hot topic in Alabama that could have come from?
262000	269000	Well we had Gadzooks I think, but at any rate I bought a Charlie the Unicorn shirt at a Goodwill in Daphne, Alabama.
269000	270000	Nice.
270000	271000	So.
271000	273000	Shine the non-believer.
273000	277000	Anyhow, just a special note for our live listeners.
277000	279000	We're aware that there's some errors where it's cutting in and out.
279000	282000	It's nothing on our end. We're not doing anything out of the ordinary.
282000	284000	There's no torrents or anything like that.
284000	287000	So we're going to chalk this up to our amazing internet service provider.
287000	291000	But we just got to keep on right on taping for the sake of the podcast.
291000	297000	If you do get dumped from the stream, just click pause and play again if you're at live.vognetwork.com.
297000	299000	And it should reconnect right away as soon as we come back.
299000	301000	Unfortunately I don't know what to do about it.
301000	302000	The joys of live radio.
302000	304000	I might have upset the cosmic balance by my sewing.
304000	305000	Possibly.
305000	306000	I'm doing matronly things.
306000	308000	Can you sew the internet back together?
308000	309000	Uh, no.
309000	311000	Get a really big needle.
311000	313000	I have really tiny needles.
313000	315000	And I keep poking myself in the thumb.
315000	316000	That's not going to work.
317000	319000	Alright, so you missed our Xbone special.
319000	321000	Excuse me, our XB1 special.
321000	323000	All the stuff about the Xbox One.
323000	325000	Did you hear anything about Xbox One?
325000	327000	Yes, and fuck all of it.
327000	329000	Not getting it. No.
329000	331000	Well, now wait a minute, DarkSakura.
331000	333000	And I think I said this on the show.
333000	335000	Isn't it too early to make up your mind on this?
335000	338000	Right now, going by what I have, fuck them.
338000	340000	And why so strongly?
340000	345000	Because I don't want to have a microphone and or a camera on all the damn time.
346000	348000	The whole used games thing, fuck them.
348000	350000	The whole downloading games, fuck them even more.
350000	353000	If I'm going to download a game, it's going to be on my PC.
353000	357000	Or, you know, if I buy another PC, guess what?
357000	358000	My games will transfer.
358000	365000	Okay, well to be fair, to play devil's advocate, what's the difference between getting a digital copy on your PC that you can't sell back and a digital...
365000	368000	Because I can upgrade my video card.
370000	374000	I can upgrade everything on my PC and make everything look amazing.
374000	379000	So in a way, you're saying a PC is pretty much guaranteed to be backwards compatible, no matter what.
379000	380000	Pretty much.
380000	384000	Where's the X... Okay, I guess that's fair because the Xbox 360, anything you downloaded...
384000	386000	I've been playing Loom.
387000	388000	You're just old school like that.
388000	400000	If I can play Loom, thanks to Steam, if I can play all kinds of old PC, if I can play text-based games, if I can play Oregon Trail on my PC, I have no problem.
401000	405000	Going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
405000	408000	Of course, again, we do tape live every Sunday night right after Bobby Black Wolf.
408000	410000	It's 6 Pacific 9 Eastern on Sundays.
410000	413000	Gamergirl says, thank you Dark Sakura. Clap, clap.
413000	415000	That's exactly why I don't want one either.
415000	419000	Koopa Kid Jeremy says, I think it's too early to decide that it's not for you.
419000	420000	I kind of agree.
420000	423000	Could anything at E3 end up swaying your mind?
423000	424000	That's what I'm curious about.
424000	426000	What if they come out and say, the big rumor is Killer Instinct.
426000	427000	It's going to be one of the games.
427000	430000	What if one of these 15 games is like, OMG, you gotta have.
430000	432000	What if there's a Homestuck game, Jamie?
432000	433000	What if there's a Homestuck game?
433000	437000	Well, I know for a fact already that I don't think it's, well, I think it's going to be PC anyway.
437000	442000	What if, what if, what if Mass Effect 4 is an Xbox One exclusive?
442000	443000	It's not.
443000	445000	It's already going to be running on PC.
445000	447000	What if, Jamie? What if?
447000	450000	I don't know that that would be enough because fuck EA.
450000	463000	Now, keep in mind, as I've said before, I reserve judgment for more information, but as it stands right now, fuck them.
463000	465000	And the horse they rode in on.
465000	467000	So they need to make some big clarifications.
467000	469000	Yes, they do. Or big changes.
469000	476000	They need to realize, because I think that they say statements like this and when they see people going, oh no, they go, oh shit.
476000	478000	Time to change it.
478000	484000	Which is kind of where Sony might be at right now because there's really nothing out there that has said the PlayStation 4 is not going to do the exact same thing.
484000	491000	But I think Sony is very much kind of watching this whole thing. They're kind of like sitting up there with their little opera glasses, looking at what's happening on the stage.
491000	494000	You know, like what is happening to Microsoft?
494000	499000	To tell SSJ100 Matt, is Dan getting it? We're, I think, kind of on the same boat right now.
499000	504000	And keep in mind, you know, we aren't really the console gamers that we used to be.
504000	507000	Did I tell you that my mom gave me an Atari PC game?
507000	510000	We don't own the system, so actually I was looking for one.
510000	515000	But, I mean, other than that, you know, we're not the big console gamers we used to be.
515000	520000	Dan's really into sim racing. He's been, you know, hooking up his PC.
520000	524000	I think that for him it's going to be more of the next Gran Turismo game.
524000	527000	Of course, it's just going to be PS3, but he's going to probably stick Sony.
527000	534000	You know, especially, you know, if they say something that's going to counter all of the crap that Microsoft is saying.
534000	537000	So, it was sort of a wait and see kind of thing.
537000	542000	Alright, well, I'm going to check in with you again after E3 and see if anything that has happened may have changed your mind.
542000	547000	Oh, and to tell RageNator about Fuck Activision, I did quit WoW before I went to Alabama.
547000	550000	Now that everybody is reuniting in our guild.
550000	554000	Two people came back to WoW, Jamie. Two people. It's not everybody.
554000	559000	Well, we better do, like, an old raid or something before my account expires.
559000	561000	I thought your account already expired.
561000	564000	No, I've got a couple days left on it. I'll find out when it expires.
564000	565000	There you go.
565000	568000	And then let me do, like, Ice Crown Citadel.
568000	570000	You should go to Karazhan and get the pets.
570000	571000	I want pets.
571000	572000	There's new pets in Karazhan.
572000	573000	Stop it.
573000	574000	Just saying.
574000	576000	Stop it. I stopped paying for it.
576000	578000	Wow, crack. Wow, crack.
578000	581000	I did delete the beta, so that did free up a lot of space.
581000	584000	But then I filled it up with, like, more games on Steam.
584000	586000	Isn't that how it always goes?
586000	587000	Shut up.
587000	589000	I just cleared off 100 gigs from my hard drive.
589000	593000	God damn it. Steam sale. God damn it. Humble Bundle. God damn it.
593000	595000	You don't have to install all of them.
595000	596000	Yes, you do.
596000	598000	No, I don't have them all installed. I have a bunch.
598000	600000	I actually have, like, the majority of them not installed.
600000	603000	How dare you? I don't know when I might want to play.
603000	605000	You just never know.
605000	609000	And I can never uninstall something, because the minute I uninstall it, what happens?
609000	614000	An entire call. Gran Turismo 6 has already been stated to be for PS3.
615000	617000	All right, anyhow.
617000	619000	Keep me strong. Tie me to the mast.
621000	624000	I will hear the song, but I shall not succumb.
625000	627000	This is my finger. Well, I've got a needle in my hand.
627000	630000	This is my finger raised at Activision and Blizzard.
630000	632000	Sit and spin, motherfuckers.
633000	635000	Or pay for my account.
636000	640000	Oh, boy. You're just... Is there anything in gaming you do like this week?
640000	642000	I started playing Mass Effect again.
643000	644000	And guess what, Rob?
644000	646000	God, I... I just can't. I can't.
646000	649000	Like she won't get an Xbox One if it's Mass Effect 4.
649000	651000	Right, exactly. It totally answers my earlier question.
651000	653000	Totally answers my... Who is she? Fucking kidding, all right?
653000	654000	Who is she?
654000	655000	No!
655000	657000	Oh, I can resist playing another Mass Effect game.
657000	659000	Nope. LOL. Nope.
659000	661000	The minute... The minute Garris in HD...
661000	663000	There will not be a Garris in...
663000	664000	Okay, here's...
664000	666000	They already said Mass Effect 4 is a different story.
666000	668000	Okay, here we go. Here we go, guys. Here we go.
668000	672000	Okay, this is the first OLR comic strip I need somebody to draw, okay?
672000	677000	You can bite my ass along with Activision Lizard and EA.
677000	679000	Here it is. Here it is. First panel.
679000	681000	Dark Sakura holding a microphone saying,
681000	686000	I will not buy an Xbox One. Fuck them. Fuck them and their stupid asses.
686000	687000	No.
687000	691000	Okay, ready? Second panel is a picture of the E3 press conference
691000	695000	where EA and Microsoft are holding hands on a stage saying,
695000	698000	Mass Effect Garris Edition Xbox One exclusive.
698000	702000	And then the third panel is Dark Sakura walking into a Best Buy
702000	705000	with a balloon that says, LOL NOPE.
707000	708000	Probably.
708000	709000	LOL NOPE.
709000	710000	Okay, okay, okay.
710000	714000	Well, first of all, I'm fairly certain that with a franchise like that,
714000	716000	they will not make it an exclusive.
716000	719000	They won't. This is just fan-waking.
719000	722000	I'm only saying this to get you ruffled and it's working.
722000	724000	You know what?
724000	727000	You are about to earn yourself the mother of all girl.
728000	730000	Just saying.
733000	734000	Okay, this is this.
734000	736000	And to go ahead and put the blanket thing out there.
736000	740000	Yes, I will get Mass Effect 4 because I love the universe.
740000	741000	I don't care how shitty the story is.
741000	743000	I don't care how sparkly the turd is.
743000	745000	I love the turd.
745000	748000	I will buy the sparkly turd because I am a fangirl.
748000	750000	There's her little quote for the next show intro.
750000	752000	I love the turd.
754000	755000	All right.
755000	757000	You know what?
757000	759000	I have pointy things.
759000	761000	You see all these little pins?
761000	765000	Yes, and you too can get points at vognetwork.com.
765000	770000	That's vognetwork.com where we announced earlier this evening on Bobby Black Wolf Show.
770000	772000	All sorts of new loot now available on the site
772000	775000	and an awesome new feature for covering conventions.
775000	777000	There's a video to explain it all to you,
777000	782000	but in a nutshell, you will be able to direct our very own network,
782000	785000	Bobby Black Wolf representative, Bobby Black Wolf.
785000	790000	He will be at E3 answering your questions as you direct him on the show floor.
790000	794000	It's all explained for you at e3.vognetwork.com.
794000	796000	Check it out.
796000	798000	Let's get into how was your gaming week,
798000	801000	and we'll talk about the types of video games you've been playing this week.
801000	802000	Dark Soccer, why don't you start us off?
802000	803000	Lul, Mass Effect.
803000	804000	Of course.
804000	805000	No, no, no. Guess what?
805000	809000	I bought Dramamine so that I can do the makeup missions.
809000	811000	God, I'm awful.
811000	814000	I have ginger pills and Dramamine.
814000	817000	You bought drugs so you can play Mass Effect.
817000	818000	Yes.
818000	820000	Because last time I played...
820000	824000	Okay, last time I had a nice two-hour session of getting side missions out of the way,
824000	827000	and I literally had to stop playing after...
827000	828000	Stop it.
828000	831000	Do not YouTube me, Rob.
831000	832000	Rob.
832000	833000	Have you ever played...
833000	834000	Don't watch what I'm doing over here.
834000	835000	Keep talking.
835000	842000	So I decided that I didn't want to get motion sick again,
842000	847000	so I have plenty of things to keep me from getting sick to my stomach,
847000	851000	hopefully, just because I get super motion sick on Mako missions.
851000	855000	I also downloaded a bunch of...
855000	861000	It's called the ultimate high-res mod or something for the first Mass Effect
861000	864000	that has made my game look absolutely freaking gorgeous.
864000	866000	Like, pretty.
866000	868000	And so I have been...
868000	873000	I'm still on the stupid first mission right after a dumbass gets shot,
873000	875000	which we all know who dumbass is.
875000	877000	Jenkins, sorry.
877000	881000	So I am right after that part in my game,
881000	884000	and it kind of doesn't like all the mods,
884000	886000	but I don't care because it makes my game pretty.
886000	888000	And I play DDR.
888000	892000	So again, to clarify, you bought drugs so you could play a drug.
892000	894000	No.
894000	895000	I had the gender on.
895000	899000	Like I'm walking on sunshine.
899000	901000	Have you ever played Mass Effect?
901000	904000	Like I'm walking on sunshine.
904000	907000	No.
907000	910000	And for the record, anyone who's a fan of the first Mass Effect
910000	914000	that is interested in this mod, talk to me.
914000	917000	So I played a lot of DDR.
917000	920000	My calves hurt for the next two days.
920000	922000	And my skin did.
922000	923000	Oh no, I stretched.
923000	926000	I was doing yoga in an arcade, okay?
926000	928000	But it was very fun.
928000	931000	And so if you go to the one and only DDR machine
931000	934000	in all of Pace, Florida,
934000	937000	and you see D-Sakura explanation point,
937000	938000	that is me.
938000	940000	On two whole songs.
940000	941000	Two.
941000	943000	Until they reset the leaderboard at night.
943000	944000	Shut up.
944000	949000	But I was feeling old, so I passed Superstar and it made me good.
950000	957000	So yeah, I also played a lot of Midway Arcade
957000	959000	for tickets on my iPad.
959000	963000	Oh, I was like, the classic Midway games, like Joust and stuff.
963000	965000	Well yeah, but I was playing pool.
965000	968000	I could not stop playing stupid pool.
968000	971000	If you just want tickets in that game, just play the skeeball.
971000	974000	You can just go like this, fling fling fling fling fling fling fling tickets.
974000	977000	You play one game of pool and you get 200 points.
977000	980000	Even if you scratch it on your first one, you still get 75 points.
980000	981000	I didn't know that.
981000	982000	So yeah.
982000	985000	So I was like, pool, pool.
985000	987000	I was so mind numbingly bored.
987000	990000	Because like, people sleep.
990000	993000	It's like, I was still like, okay.
993000	997000	I actually managed to get off of West Coast time
997000	1001000	because of the 40 hours I stayed awake due to
1001000	1005000	nine hour layovers, another three hour layover,
1005000	1007000	flight delays, waiting on my luggage.
1007000	1010000	Then lying to my face about where my luggage was,
1010000	1013000	when I laid down on my grandmother's bed,
1013000	1015000	for a moment I was like, oh, the bed's kind of crooked.
1015000	1017000	And then it was daylight.
1017000	1020000	So my time completely reset while I was there.
1020000	1024000	So I, but my, still my night owl thing was like,
1024000	1026000	it's eight o'clock and I'm not out doing stuff.
1026000	1028000	This is not me.
1028000	1030000	So it was very bizarre.
1030000	1033000	So yeah, I played a lot of Midway Arcade and Blazing Star.
1034000	1036000	Because I have Blazing Star on my iPad
1036000	1038000	and that game is awesome.
1039000	1040000	The end.
1040000	1041000	The end.
1041000	1043000	Loki, how about you?
1043000	1044000	Let's see.
1044000	1046000	Well, this week I played More Saints Row the Third,
1046000	1050000	just trying to finish up my last few achievements on there.
1050000	1056000	And then also played a bit of TrackMania.
1056000	1058000	We tried to do VOG Gaming Night on that
1058000	1060000	and it just wasn't having, it was weird
1060000	1062000	I did everything correctly.
1062000	1064000	Like one person was able to join my game,
1064000	1066000	everybody else was not able to join my game.
1066000	1069000	And then we decided, hey, let's play on a third party server.
1069000	1071000	So we just picked a server at random
1071000	1073000	that we were able to connect to.
1073000	1077000	And then it just like had the weirdest fucking tracks ever.
1077000	1080000	Just these giant maze tracks
1080000	1083000	that were impossible to figure out where the hell you were supposed to go.
1083000	1085000	It was ridiculous.
1085000	1088000	But we had a little bit of fun.
1089000	1092000	And then I played a little bit of Cave Story Plus.
1092000	1098000	And I'll say play a very little bit of Call of Duty
1098000	1101000	because everyone was flaking the entire week.
1101000	1103000	So that's pretty much it.
1103000	1105000	My gaming week.
1105000	1109000	Over the Memorial Day weekend I was staying with Captain Spike and Tim
1109000	1112000	who were on a previous episode a few weeks ago
1112000	1114000	at their Memorial Day soiree.
1114000	1116000	And so we played a few video games.
1116000	1119000	We watched them play Trivial Pursuit on the Xbox.
1119000	1123000	Which was kind of frustrating how long that game was going on
1123000	1125000	because you know it's Trivial Pursuit and LOL.
1125000	1129000	And we went out to GameStop one day randomly
1129000	1131000	to go find a cheap game to play.
1131000	1133000	And we ended up buying Wheel of Fortune.
1133000	1137000	I should say Spike ended up buying Wheel of Fortune on the Xbox 360.
1137000	1139000	And many lulls ensued.
1139000	1141000	What can I say about it?
1141000	1143000	I'm like, you know exactly what you're going to get
1143000	1145000	with a game like Wheel of Fortune.
1145000	1147000	Because you've seen the game show at some point in your life, yes?
1147000	1150000	Although I have to admit the characters are a little bit derpy
1150000	1152000	and some of the unlocks are a little bit silly.
1152000	1154000	But for 20 bucks, hey!
1154000	1156000	It provided a little bit of entertainment.
1156000	1160000	And some really, really hilarious instances where we were solving puzzles incorrectly
1160000	1162000	and throwing each other off and so forth.
1162000	1164000	So that was fun.
1164000	1166000	As far as other stuff I've been playing during the week,
1166000	1168000	I was keeping it retro.
1168000	1170000	And thanks to some conversations I was having on Twitter
1170000	1174000	with not just Spike but Jeremy from Koopa Club
1174000	1176000	and some of the other people I talk with on Twitter,
1176000	1179000	I was reminded that Mario 2 came out on Virtual Console for Wii U.
1179000	1181000	And I was like, oh, I had that on the Wii,
1181000	1184000	so I should just spend the dollar or whatever to upgrade it and play it.
1184000	1187000	And not only did I play it, I played it from start to finish.
1187000	1189000	Granted, I cheated and I used warps.
1189000	1194000	But I used only Luigi the whole way through the game.
1194000	1199000	In my nod to Year of Luigi, I beat Mario 2 using only Luigi.
1199000	1201000	And I'm going to tell you what.
1201000	1205000	Those ice stages that you have to play even when you warp suck with Luigi.
1205000	1207000	Yes, they do.
1207000	1210000	Because I'm used to using the princess to just float through those little,
1210000	1213000	not the shy guys, what do you call the flying ones with the pitchfork?
1213000	1214000	I don't remember their names.
1214000	1216000	The flurries? No, the flurries are the guys on the ground.
1216000	1219000	Yeah, the little dudes on the ground that look like little jiggly cuffs.
1219000	1221000	I don't remember what they're called. I call them bastards.
1221000	1223000	Yeah, they're little fuckers.
1223000	1225000	So the little fuckers are flying in the air and the princess is easy.
1225000	1227000	You just float in between them.
1227000	1229000	But not so easy when you're Luigi.
1229000	1231000	But I did it. I did it.
1231000	1233000	When I beat the game and that was fun.
1233000	1235000	So yeah, I was keeping it retro this week.
1235000	1238000	I got to say, there's something about Wii U Virtual Console
1238000	1241000	and I'm totally having to eat my words from what I said earlier on this program
1241000	1243000	about a year ago when I was like,
1243000	1245000	Wii U Virtual Console is going to be stupid.
1245000	1247000	Why would I pay money to upgrade and dah dah dah.
1247000	1250000	It's just a better experience and I can't put my finger on it.
1250000	1252000	I don't know if it's the HDMI.
1252000	1254000	I don't know if it's the sound from the tablet
1254000	1256000	and the sound from the speakers at the same time.
1256000	1258000	I don't know, but it is a better experience.
1258000	1260000	So, oops, I was wrong.
1260000	1261000	It happens.
1261000	1264000	So yeah, I was having fun with Mario 2 on Virtual Console
1264000	1267000	and then I was playing Warcraft because, you know, I'm...
1267000	1268000	Addict.
1268000	1271000	Well, I hit 90 with my Hunter, my Blood Elf Hunter.
1271000	1273000	My PVP character.
1273000	1275000	If you get sassy to 90...
1275000	1277000	Sassy is 87.
1277000	1279000	In a row? No.
1279000	1284000	When you get sassy to 90, I will re-up WoW for one month.
1284000	1286000	Just to play with sassy.
1286000	1289000	Because I like the braids. They float.
1289000	1292000	Jeremy is coaching me in chat, I guess, saying,
1292000	1295000	You warped. I said I warped.
1295000	1298000	My next goal is to do it without warping,
1298000	1300000	but unfortunately I'm on a work trip this week
1300000	1302000	and then I have all the E3 stuff.
1302000	1304000	Oh, I'm not going to E3. There's other stuff going on.
1304000	1307000	So it's going to be a little while before I can get through the game without warping.
1307000	1309000	But that's on the list.
1309000	1311000	Except for the fact that Animal Crossing comes out Sunday
1311000	1315000	and then the list will be shot because, yay, Animal Crossing.
1315000	1317000	Alright.
1317000	1319000	It actually comes out on Fri-
1319000	1321000	I thought it was Sunday. Yeah.
1321000	1323000	Nintendo games are usually Sunday.
1323000	1325000	Last of Us is coming out on a Friday.
1325000	1327000	Oh, is it this Friday?
1327000	1329000	Next Friday.
1329000	1331000	The E3 Friday? Wow.
1331000	1333000	I don't know why. Interesting.
1333000	1335000	Well, if no other big games are coming out, then why not?
1335000	1338000	Most of America doesn't go to E3, so it doesn't really matter.
1338000	1340000	Why a Friday street day? Just put it on Tuesday.
1340000	1342000	Why not? Just in time for the weekend.
1342000	1344000	Why do movies sometimes open on Wednesday?
1344000	1346000	They just- they do.
1346000	1348000	Rob. What?
1348000	1350000	Do you sometimes just wonder why?
1350000	1352000	Do you ever feel not so fresh?
1352000	1355000	First of all, I am incredibly crescent fresh.
1355000	1358000	And second of all, the answer to why?
1358000	1360000	Because.
1362000	1364000	And then deal with it.
1364000	1366000	See if that works with a six year old, by the way.
1366000	1368000	With the floating sunglasses.
1368000	1370000	Did you tell the child to deal with it and then have sunglasses land on your face?
1370000	1372000	No, but I'm going to do that next time.
1372000	1374000	That's hilarious to see Julian's reaction.
1374000	1376000	Alright, housekeeping.
1376000	1378000	Visit our Twitter.
1378000	1380000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

1388000	1390000	Home to lots of great geeky podcasts
1390000	1392000	and geeky content, including video game reviews.
1392000	1394000	I know Act F just reviewed
1394000	1396000	Dust and Elysian Tail
1396000	1398000	was on the
1398000	1400000	site this week.
1400000	1402000	And of course, as I mentioned before,
1402000	1404000	lots of exciting stuff going on for E3.
1404000	1406000	So check out E3 dot vog network dot com.
1406000	1408000	We will be the second site that you check.
1408000	1410000	Not the first, we'll be the second.
1410000	1412000	And that's okay. We're number two.
1412000	1414000	Silver medal for VOG.
1414000	1416000	It'll be great.
1416000	1418000	Let's get into some news.
1418000	1420000	Speaking of Xbox One and all that.
1420000	1422000	Lots of clarifications since our last show.
1422000	1424000	Yes, Logie?
1424000	1426000	A little bit. This isn't really much of a clarification
1426000	1428000	other than just bragging.
1428000	1430000	Saying that they're investing one billion dollars
1430000	1432000	ONE BILLION DOLLARS
1432000	1434000	into the
1434000	1436000	putting games on the Xbox One.
1436000	1438000	So I'm assuming a lot of that
1438000	1440000	has to do with the 15 exclusives
1440000	1442000	that they, I guess, paid for.
1442000	1444000	And will be coming out the first year.
1444000	1446000	And then
1446000	1448000	didn't really hint at a whole lot
1448000	1450000	of what's coming other than
1450000	1452000	we know there's a Rare game coming.
1452000	1454000	And apparently Black Tusk Studios
1454000	1456000	is working on something.
1456000	1458000	Yeah.
1458000	1460000	Microsoft Studios
1460000	1462000	is obviously working on stuff.
1462000	1464000	We know that there's going to be a new Forza.
1464000	1466000	Remedy's got that Quantum Break game.
1466000	1468000	And EA's got some stuff.
1468000	1470000	Not necessarily exclusive, but
1470000	1472000	features that are somewhat
1472000	1474000	exclusive, I guess. I don't know.
1474000	1476000	So yeah.
1476000	1478000	They're spending quite a bit of money on that stuff.
1478000	1480000	Of course, we're going to have to
1480000	1482000	figure out what that is.
1482000	1484000	Maybe one of these announcements
1484000	1486000	has to do with a bunch of these
1486000	1488000	domains that they're registering, including
1488000	1490000	domains pertaining to a title called
1490000	1492000	Halo Spartan Assault.
1492000	1494000	Which doesn't sound
1494000	1496000	like a
1496000	1498000	you know, it almost sounds like
1498000	1500000	an arcade game or something. Like a
1500000	1502000	spin-off.
1502000	1504000	So, I guess we'll have to wait
1504000	1506000	and see. Could it be maybe an upgrade
1506000	1508000	or something? I'm hoping
1508000	1510000	it's not that. Remember, wasn't
1510000	1512000	there supposed to be like a
1512000	1514000	Kinect-powered
1514000	1516000	game or something like that?
1516000	1518000	Remember, they were doing that with Gears of War,
1518000	1520000	I remember. Maybe it's like a Kinect
1520000	1522000	Halo game or something.
1522000	1524000	I don't know.
1524000	1526000	Joy, I can flail around and choose
1526000	1528000	weapons. Didn't one of the Halo
1528000	1530000	games like ODST or something incorporate Kinect?
1530000	1532000	Like, you could shout
1532000	1534000	grenade and it was your grenade? No, that was the
1534000	1536000	Halo Combat Evolved HD
1536000	1538000	thing. Oh yeah, that one.
1538000	1540000	Combat Evolved Anniversary.
1540000	1542000	Where you can shout grenade. There was a lot
1542000	1544000	of Halo games. I'm sorry, can you shout grenade
1544000	1546000	faster than you can press a button? No.
1546000	1548000	No, you cannot. And that's
1548000	1550000	assuming that the Kinect hears you and understands
1550000	1552000	what you asked for. It would only be useful
1552000	1554000	as if what you're yelling is, how do I throw a grenade?
1554000	1556000	It just does it.
1556000	1558000	Oh hey, it worked! How do I throw
1558000	1560000	a grenade? Anyway.
1560000	1562000	Win!
1562000	1564000	Speaking of
1564000	1566000	the Kinect being able to hear you,
1566000	1568000	one of the controversial things, of course, we
1568000	1570000	got into during last week's show, I
1570000	1572000	expressed that this concerns me a little bit.
1572000	1574000	DarkSakura certainly expressed earlier this
1574000	1576000	concerns her a bit. And you
1576000	1578000	know who else is concerned? Germany.
1578000	1580000	Well, anyway, the
1580000	1582000	German Federal Commissioner for Data Protection
1582000	1584000	and Freedom of Information. I did
1584000	1586000	not know that such a position existed in Germany,
1586000	1588000	but I guess it makes sense.
1588000	1590000	Certainly you want to make sure that
1590000	1592000	everything is regulated
1592000	1594000	when it comes to those exchanges,
1594000	1596000	but to a fault.
1596000	1598000	Anyhow, he calls it the
1598000	1600000	Xbox One Kinect
1600000	1602000	monitoring device.
1602000	1604000	That's because it is. It is.
1604000	1606000	And he goes on to say,
1606000	1608000	under the heading game device, this is through
1608000	1610000	a translation that he mentioned
1610000	1612000	with the website
1612000	1614000	Spiegel.de, but this is through
1614000	1616000	a translation, under the heading
1616000	1618000	game device, Microsoft
1618000	1620000	pushes a monitoring device in the market.
1620000	1622000	The Xbox continuously records
1622000	1624000	all sorts of personal information about me.
1624000	1626000	Reaction rates, my learning
1626000	1628000	or emotional states, these are then
1628000	1630000	processed on an external server and
1630000	1632000	possibly even passed on to third parties.
1632000	1634000	Whether they will ever be deleted,
1634000	1636000	the person cannot influence.
1636000	1638000	It absolutely is.
1638000	1640000	It's what it is. It's marketing
1640000	1642000	metrics is what it is. They're going to be
1642000	1644000	listening to
1644000	1646000	stuff that you're talking about, and they're going to
1646000	1648000	advertise to you. They're going to target advertising.
1648000	1650000	And it's just like on Facebook
1650000	1652000	where they try to target advertising,
1652000	1654000	but they're going to also make sure that
1654000	1656000	hey, are you paying attention to
1656000	1658000	those ads? What ads are
1658000	1660000	interesting you? That kind of stuff.
1660000	1662000	So they're going into greater detail. And that information
1662000	1664000	is worth a ton
1664000	1666000	of money. So on top of
1666000	1668000	them making money off the console
1668000	1670000	and live and all that stuff and advertising
1670000	1672000	on the front page even though
1672000	1674000	you're paying for an online service,
1674000	1676000	they're going to be selling your marketing data
1676000	1678000	for a ton of money because they can do
1678000	1680000	that. That's why you're getting achievements for watching TV.
1680000	1682000	It's because you're watching the ads.
1682000	1684000	Because they're getting all that ad data.
1684000	1686000	Well, in Microsoft's
1686000	1688000	defense, kind of the counter to this
1688000	1690000	was from Microsoft corporate vice
1690000	1692000	president Phil Harrison. And if that
1692000	1694000	name sounds familiar, it's because he used to work for a
1694000	1696000	different video game company, but now he works for Microsoft.
1696000	1698000	And he was talking to Eurogamer about
1698000	1700000	privacy concerns, and he said that Microsoft
1700000	1702000	is a quote, leader in the world of
1702000	1704000	privacy. Continuing, we aren't
1704000	1706000	using Kinect to snoop on anybody at
1706000	1708000	all. We listen for the word
1708000	1710000	box on, then switch on the machine.
1710000	1712000	But we don't transmit personal data
1712000	1714000	in any way, shape or form
1714000	1716000	that could be
1716000	1718000	personally identifiable to you
1718000	1720000	unless you explicitly opt into
1720000	1722000	that. What's interesting about that is
1722000	1724000	that basically he's saying it is there.
1724000	1726000	You just have to opt into it, right?
1726000	1728000	And I remember their excuse was, well, but you can
1728000	1730000	turn the console off. You can
1730000	1732000	power the console off.
1732000	1734000	Unplug it.
1734000	1736000	So it sounds to me like Microsoft is
1736000	1738000	going to have to really clarify this. And it's
1738000	1740000	a valid concern about this. You know, when I got into
1740000	1742000	this last week is that I don't want no
1742000	1744000	Xbox filming me when I'm running around in my underwear
1744000	1746000	trying to get coffee in the morning or whatever.
1746000	1748000	You know, I don't need that. You know?
1748000	1750000	Who knows? Who knows what might be said
1750000	1752000	when I yell to Allen in the other
1752000	1754000	room and suddenly I'm calling dark
1754000	1756000	soccer on Kinect and things are awkward.
1756000	1758000	You know what I mean?
1758000	1760000	All I gotta say is you're going to be
1760000	1762000	getting a lot of targeted Pinkberry advertisements.
1762000	1764000	And
1764000	1766000	and Keurig.
1766000	1768000	Right? Pinkberry and Keurig. Right?
1768000	1770000	I'll be there with you.
1770000	1772000	Except for the Keurig part.
1772000	1774000	You said to buy enough of it.
1774000	1776000	Just saying if I ever get the console, I'm just
1776000	1778000	talking about pornography whenever I'm in front of it.
1778000	1780000	Here's what I was thinking about
1780000	1782000	though with the Xbox One
1782000	1784000	is that if I get one, which you know
1784000	1786000	I'm still on the fence. I don't feel
1786000	1788000	as strongly as Jamie does, what she said
1788000	1790000	earlier in the show, but I kind of have
1790000	1792000	very similar concerns to what she already said.
1792000	1794000	To me it's very similar to how I
1794000	1796000	felt with the Wii U. It's like, okay
1796000	1798000	that's cool. Do I feel like buying one
1798000	1800000	right now? No. I don't feel like buying one.
1800000	1802000	But I like that my Wii U is off.
1802000	1804000	You know what I mean? And if I wanted
1804000	1806000	to cover the little camera on the
1806000	1808000	little device, or I can just
1808000	1810000	flip it to the wall or whatever, and it still works
1810000	1812000	just fine. You know? No worries. Right?
1812000	1814000	So
1814000	1816000	here's my thing is that I think
1816000	1818000	Microsoft needs to clarify some of this.
1818000	1820000	And I think they will, but
1820000	1822000	in a way, if it's just left at what
1822000	1824000	Phil Harrison is saying, he's basically
1824000	1826000	saying, what? Don't you trust us?
1826000	1828000	We're a leader in privacy information.
1828000	1830000	Don't you trust us? What are you talking about? No one got hacked
1830000	1832000	before. Money wasn't stolen.
1832000	1834000	Fact, guys. Fact.
1834000	1836000	You want me to trust a company that
1836000	1838000	fact sold a bunch of
1838000	1840000	broken Xboxes that would break after
1840000	1842000	several days of
1842000	1844000	use. My Xbox
1844000	1846000	360 Red Ring two days after I bought
1846000	1848000	it. That is a fact. Fact.
1848000	1850000	I had money stolen from my Xbox
1850000	1852000	Live account by a hacker, and to this day,
1852000	1854000	Microsoft will not acknowledge that there was
1854000	1856000	a breach, and instead they deflect
1856000	1858000	blame on the user. That is a fact.
1858000	1860000	And you want me to trust you?
1860000	1862000	You need to be a little
1862000	1864000	bit more transparent with what's
1864000	1866000	going on. That's the reality.
1868000	1870000	And if I want to turn that fucker off,
1870000	1872000	then I should be able to turn it off.
1872000	1874000	Period. It should not require
1874000	1876000	that thing to be on for any reason.
1876000	1878000	Here's my other question.
1878000	1880000	What if I just unplug
1880000	1882000	the fucking thing so it doesn't have a power
1882000	1884000	source? What if I just unplug
1884000	1886000	it when I don't want to use it?
1886000	1888000	Is that going to cause it to malfunction?
1888000	1890000	Because I could just put it on a switch
1890000	1892000	and have a little on-off switch.
1892000	1894000	No, you don't even have to do that.
1894000	1896000	It's just like the PlayStation 3
1896000	1898000	where there's a power
1898000	1900000	switch on the back of the console, and you
1900000	1902000	can flip it off.
1902000	1904000	But they're just saying, though, if you're going to leave
1904000	1906000	it in standby mode or whatever, that the
1906000	1908000	microphone's going to be always listening to you so that
1908000	1910000	you can say, on, and it
1910000	1912000	will turn the Xbox on. You know what? I read
1912000	1914000	1984.
1914000	1916000	Hey, did we leave the Xbox
1916000	1918000	on? Ah, fuck. It's turned on
1918000	1920000	again.
1920000	1922000	Rama in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com
1922000	1924000	says, say what you will about Microsoft,
1924000	1926000	but they handled the security breach a hell of a lot
1926000	1928000	better than Sony.
1928000	1930000	Yes and no.
1930000	1932000	Sony at least admitted there was a problem.
1932000	1934000	I didn't actually have any money
1934000	1936000	stolen from my Sony and
1936000	1938000	that whole thing. Nobody hacked into that or stole
1938000	1940000	anything. And Sony did
1940000	1942000	have to give a lot away
1942000	1944000	with that and the whole, you know, free games
1944000	1946000	and everything. I'm not saying that makes
1946000	1948000	it right. What happened with Sony was
1948000	1950000	not cool and was something
1950000	1952000	they needed to have their feet to the fire held to.
1952000	1954000	But I kind of feel like
1954000	1956000	that was done and they paid for that
1956000	1958000	in the court of public opinion. I'm not
1958000	1960000	so sure Microsoft ever had to pay for that.
1960000	1962000	But they're gonna pay for this in the court of public opinion.
1962000	1964000	And you're starting to see it in, you know,
1964000	1966000	what Germany is. I mean, this is much
1966000	1968000	bigger news than you guys think. Germany
1968000	1970000	is freaking crazy when it comes to privacy laws.
1970000	1972000	Which I don't think anybody
1972000	1974000	here is gonna really have a problem with, right? Germany
1974000	1976000	is a leader in some regards in that,
1976000	1978000	when it comes to the privacy. So,
1978000	1980000	you know, if it's gonna come to the point where
1980000	1982000	like, yo, the Xbox will not be sold in Germany
1982000	1984000	unless they allow you to turn it off.
1984000	1986000	That's gonna cause a policy change.
1986000	1988000	It's gonna have to.
1988000	1990000	I think it's stupid anyways to have, cause
1990000	1992000	let's just, I understand that the interface
1992000	1994000	stuff uses the Kinect.
1994000	1996000	Whoopdy shit. Do I really wanna, do I need
1996000	1998000	to use that? I mean, is that really
1998000	2000000	something that I need to use? I mean,
2000000	2002000	why even bother with it?
2002000	2004000	Just have it where you can unplug it and
2004000	2006000	if it's a game that requires Kinect,
2006000	2008000	and I mean, requires it, not like
2008000	2010000	shouting grenade
2010000	2012000	or some bullshit like that. But if it requires
2012000	2014000	Kinect, then have it plug in. That way
2014000	2016000	they can still program the games, cause they know
2016000	2018000	that there's gonna be a Kinect there, you just
2018000	2020000	plug it in. But, you know, the whole thing
2020000	2022000	is, if it's not gonna work with the
2022000	2024000	Kinect, what if the Kinect, you know, what if
2024000	2026000	a cat knocks the Kinect
2026000	2028000	off your shelf and it breaks?
2028000	2030000	Fuck, now you can't play your console because
2030000	2032000	your stupid Kinect that you weren't using anyways
2032000	2034000	for stuff is just,
2034000	2036000	it's broken. Alright, in the interest
2036000	2038000	of time, I'm gonna, go ahead,
2038000	2040000	final thought. Wasn't it also
2040000	2042000	Germany that sorta had Nintendo by the balls
2042000	2044000	for legalities? Yes, it was the, uh,
2044000	2046000	the whole, did the whole zombie you
2046000	2048000	sell late at night thing, wasn't that a
2048000	2050000	Germany rooted thing? Yeah. So, and
2050000	2052000	we saw how, you know, they had to work out
2052000	2054000	a deal to get that to go, so I think
2054000	2056000	that whatever comes out
2056000	2058000	of Germany, if it doesn't, if it doesn't
2058000	2060000	fly legally on the international
2060000	2062000	stage, they're gonna have to make changes.
2062000	2064000	Alright, regardless, admittedly,
2064000	2066000	we are making a lot of
2066000	2068000	opinions here based on
2068000	2070000	cloudy information, so Microsoft,
2070000	2072000	I look to you to clear up some of this cloudiness at
2072000	2074000	E3, and we will reformulate our opinions
2074000	2076000	at that time if need be, but this just
2076000	2078000	shows there are questions that have to be answered.
2078000	2080000	Let's hope Microsoft answers them in a week.
2080000	2082000	We'll know, well, a week and a half, and a week and a
2082000	2084000	half, we'll know. Hopefully, this
2084000	2086000	will all be over, and it'll all be just a
2086000	2088000	dream. It'll be like that one
2088000	2090000	season of Dallas. Anyway, DarkSakura. Well,
2090000	2092000	speaking of international stage, the Xbox
2092000	2094000	One is going to be region locked.
2094000	2096000	So, everything that comes out
2096000	2098000	must match the region, and this
2098000	2100000	is something Microsoft told Digital Trends.
2100000	2102000	We've already
2102000	2104000	pretty much seen this anyway.
2104000	2106000	It's not a big surprise,
2106000	2108000	but they are going to
2108000	2110000	keep everything to country-specific
2110000	2112000	guidelines
2112000	2114000	before they're cleared to sail.
2114000	2116000	I think before
2116000	2118000	they were saying that it was up to the developer
2118000	2120000	or the publisher
2120000	2122000	or whatever they wanted it to be region locked or not.
2122000	2124000	A lot of games for the Xbox,
2124000	2126000	they don't go advertising, but a lot of them
2126000	2128000	are region-free.
2128000	2130000	It's just that not everything
2130000	2132000	is, and a lot of them are not,
2132000	2134000	but it's kind of a mix,
2134000	2136000	whereas everything on the PlayStation 3 is
2136000	2138000	region-free.
2138000	2140000	So, I think if they leave it how it is,
2140000	2142000	then that's fine, but I'm not surprised.
2144000	2146000	If it is up to the studio,
2146000	2148000	that's one thing, but
2148000	2150000	the quote here says,
2150000	2152000	must match.
2152000	2154000	It's very...
2154000	2156000	Here's where I'm at with this.
2156000	2158000	I hear this, and I'm like,
2158000	2160000	yet again, it's something that's a little unclear,
2160000	2162000	and it's a little disappointing, but sadly,
2162000	2164000	I can't go, Microsoft,
2164000	2166000	I totally blame you for doing this, because
2166000	2168000	it's a real unfortunate trend.
2168000	2170000	The only thing we saw that really bucked the trend
2170000	2172000	recently was the PlayStation 3.
2172000	2174000	The original DS was region-free?
2174000	2176000	Yes.
2176000	2178000	All the handheld systems up to the 3DS were region-free,
2178000	2180000	and then the PS3 was
2180000	2182000	region-free as well.
2182000	2184000	So, I can't fault Microsoft alone for this,
2184000	2186000	but it is worth saying, and we've said it many times
2186000	2188000	on this show, being that this show started
2188000	2190000	out of a very Japanese-centric video game,
2190000	2192000	a bunch of games,
2192000	2194000	including BeatMania,
2194000	2196000	and Dance Dance Revolution,
2196000	2198000	and all that.
2198000	2200000	I think there's going to come a time when companies
2200000	2202000	need to realize,
2202000	2204000	gaming companies tear down
2204000	2206000	this wall!
2206000	2208000	Why do we keep separating?
2208000	2210000	We are a global community.
2210000	2212000	I mean, yeah, we're becoming more and more
2212000	2214000	an economy. There's a lot of people here who would like
2214000	2216000	to play some of the shit that's out in Japan.
2216000	2218000	There's a lot of people in Europe that would like to play some of the stuff
2218000	2220000	that comes out here. It's like, when are we going to get
2220000	2222000	a global console? Why does everything
2222000	2224000	still have to be separated?
2224000	2226000	I know you're all sitting there
2226000	2228000	answering the question for me, that
2228000	2230000	it has to do with licensing, especially when you get into
2230000	2232000	those music-based games. A lot of it is licensed by
2232000	2234000	region. But I'm just saying,
2234000	2236000	the internet has got to force
2236000	2238000	some of our ways of thinking in this,
2238000	2240000	to modernize. And we need to globalize
2240000	2242000	some of this stuff a little more and make more
2242000	2244000	games region-free, because
2244000	2246000	I'm going to be open and honest.
2246000	2248000	Region locks on the PlayStation 1
2248000	2250000	is what drove me to piracy.
2250000	2252000	I don't think there's really a whole ton of
2252000	2254000	region locking on
2254000	2256000	IOS games or anything like that.
2256000	2258000	I mean, let's be honest
2258000	2260000	here. There's not all these IOS games
2260000	2262000	that have great
2262000	2264000	soundtracks and high development
2264000	2266000	costs, that type of thing. But there are a few.
2266000	2268000	And I know there are some music games
2268000	2270000	out there that
2270000	2272000	aren't region locked, so
2272000	2274000	why can they get away with it
2274000	2276000	when the consoles can't?
2276000	2278000	Well, this is what I think.
2278000	2280000	If you leave everything completely
2280000	2282000	region-free, and then just
2282000	2284000	impose import taxes,
2284000	2286000	it's the same thing I've sort of suggested
2286000	2288000	being done for companies that outsource.
2288000	2290000	Tax the crap out of them so that
2290000	2292000	they'd be more inclined to keep jobs
2292000	2294000	over here. But other than that,
2294000	2296000	if a company is going to have
2296000	2298000	say that everything's
2298000	2300000	region-free, will then
2300000	2302000	make it a little bit more expensive to import.
2302000	2304000	Have an import, you know.
2304000	2306000	Well, I always thought it was really cool that
2306000	2308000	there was a handful of games
2308000	2310000	on the 360 that were Japanese
2310000	2312000	where they didn't bother to translate them.
2312000	2314000	Like Death Smiles? Yeah, they just put them up
2314000	2316000	on the marketplace like, if you want to pay 40 bucks for it,
2316000	2318000	here you go. Yay!
2318000	2320000	We bought that Death Smiles Special
2320000	2322000	Edition, which was pretty much
2322000	2324000	the exact same. Yeah.
2324000	2326000	I wish more game companies did
2326000	2328000	that stuff. Well, they just did that.
2328000	2330000	They had a new Dawn of Apache game that
2330000	2332000	came out, Slide.io.
2332000	2334000	Well, I mean, if they are going to
2334000	2336000	region-lock the Xbox One or whatever,
2336000	2338000	I hope we see more stuff like that. But I just think
2338000	2340000	region-locking is kind of a dated
2340000	2342000	thing.
2342000	2344000	Anyway, more news.
2344000	2346000	Yeah.
2346000	2348000	So, let's see. Let's talk
2348000	2350000	a little bit about Sony.
2350000	2352000	I can get away from Microsoft here.
2352000	2354000	Sony is going to be
2354000	2356000	forcing all publishers and developers
2356000	2358000	to have their titles that are going to be
2358000	2360000	on the PlayStation 4 compatible with remote play
2360000	2362000	on the Vita.
2362000	2364000	I think that's kind of cool, actually.
2364000	2366000	More reasons than via Vita.
2366000	2368000	It's a smart
2368000	2370000	little jab at Nintendo
2370000	2372000	and the fact that a lot of the whole
2372000	2374000	Wii U is the whole off-screen
2374000	2376000	play, Nintendo won't be able to
2376000	2378000	claim exclusivity
2378000	2380000	to that anymore.
2380000	2382000	Although, granted, the Vita is a
2382000	2384000	separate device, it's probably going to cost you more
2384000	2386000	to do it via the PS4.
2386000	2388000	It's a
2388000	2390000	logical movement of the
2390000	2392000	chess piece, if you will.
2392000	2394000	But it's even better, though, than just off-screen
2394000	2396000	play with the Wii U because if you're in a
2396000	2398000	Wi-Fi hotspot somewhere else,
2398000	2400000	and I'm assuming that this is all going to be streamed
2400000	2402000	through their Gaikai stuff now,
2402000	2404000	you're going to be able to play your games
2404000	2406000	away from home.
2406000	2408000	Oh, interesting. I didn't even think of that.
2408000	2410000	I was just assuming it would be very
2410000	2412000	and I didn't even think it would necessarily
2412000	2414000	be Wi-Fi, but that's very
2414000	2416000	interesting.
2416000	2418000	I think it's just going to be wherever you are.
2418000	2420000	That would be kind of cool.
2420000	2422000	That would be really cool if it would work, but if you have an
2422000	2424000	internet connection like what we have here trying to do the show,
2424000	2426000	it might drop out.
2426000	2428000	LOL game over.
2428000	2430000	As a concept,
2430000	2432000	back in the days of Neo Geo where you had the memory card
2432000	2434000	where you could play on the arcade and then take it
2434000	2436000	home if you had the system, wouldn't
2436000	2438000	it sort of be almost the same thing?
2438000	2440000	Especially if you
2440000	2442000	incorporated the share function?
2442000	2444000	Actually, Jamie, now that I think about it,
2444000	2446000	the PS3 and the PSP,
2446000	2448000	yes, PSP, do this today.
2448000	2450000	We talked about this on the show, how this is a
2450000	2452000	horribly underlooked feature
2452000	2454000	of these consoles, but if I'm
2454000	2456000	at a friend's house on their
2456000	2458000	Wi-Fi, if I have my PlayStation 3
2458000	2460000	set to listen for it, I can power
2460000	2462000	on my PlayStation 3 from my
2462000	2464000	friend's house and over the Wi-Fi,
2464000	2466000	navigate my PlayStation 3.
2466000	2468000	All this technology is there right now.
2468000	2470000	It's just that it's slow as shit
2470000	2472000	and you can't play games through it.
2472000	2474000	You can only do things like watch movies
2474000	2476000	and even then they're going to be a little bit shotty.
2476000	2478000	Maybe music would work.
2478000	2480000	But look at where the technology is going to be in two years.
2480000	2482000	Exactly. Now that Sony has Gaikai, what if
2482000	2484000	PlayStation 4, and Loki, I think you hit the nail on the
2484000	2486000	head, what if the PlayStation 4 is a
2486000	2488000	Gaikai box and they're leveraging that technology
2488000	2490000	to oomph that up a lot?
2490000	2492000	We're already looking
2492000	2494000	into these
2494000	2496000	massive
2496000	2498000	advancements in
2498000	2500000	communication regardless.
2500000	2502000	They're already working on quantum communication.
2502000	2504000	What's
2504000	2506000	to say that in five, ten years
2506000	2508000	this is going to be the norm?
2508000	2510000	It's always harder to look ahead in a way
2510000	2512000	because honestly, think back to when
2512000	2514000	we were like nine and ten years old.
2514000	2516000	We'll even go a little
2516000	2518000	later. I know
2518000	2520000	a lot of our listeners are younger, something that maybe a lot
2520000	2522000	of you guys remember. So think to the time
2522000	2524000	that was like 1990, 91 or so
2524000	2526000	when the Super Nintendo was big.
2526000	2528000	And the Super Nintendo was first coming out.
2528000	2530000	When you first saw that Mode 7 for the first time
2530000	2532000	it's like, oh my
2532000	2534000	god, I'm really flying.
2534000	2536000	This shit is real.
2536000	2538000	Or Star Fox.
2538000	2540000	Right? Stunt Race.
2540000	2542000	That shit was amazing and we were like
2542000	2544000	this is real on my TV.
2544000	2546000	This is the future.
2546000	2548000	And who would have thought
2548000	2550000	anything like Bluray
2550000	2552000	would exist 25 years
2552000	2554000	from then, which is where we are now.
2554000	2556000	And that it would be replacing, you know,
2556000	2558000	all of us back in the day who said laserdisc
2558000	2560000	was the future, we were right.
2560000	2562000	All of that came from laserdisc
2562000	2564000	technology. In a way.
2564000	2566000	Yeah, but digital encoding.
2566000	2568000	Who knew that we would be replacing all of
2568000	2570000	our TVs? Who knew we wouldn't have to change
2570000	2572000	sides? Who knew
2572000	2574000	who knew that the government
2574000	2576000	would come in and say
2576000	2578000	everybody must switch from analog to
2578000	2580000	digital. Like, we are going to switch as a country
2580000	2582000	from analog to digital signals for TV.
2582000	2584000	Like, that's just, you know, you don't know.
2584000	2586000	Who knows where we're going to be in 25 years?
2586000	2588000	Who knew? It's exciting and scary.
2588000	2590000	Back when I was playing kangaroo
2590000	2592000	on the Atari 2600
2592000	2594000	that I would be playing Mass Effect today.
2594000	2596000	Who knew
2596000	2598000	three years ago on this show
2598000	2600000	when you were like, I don't want to play that game.
2600000	2602000	It's like a stupid shoot about, I don't want to play
2602000	2604000	that. More like
2604000	2606000	dumb effect. I don't want to
2606000	2608000	romance the blue chick.
2608000	2610000	Which I did once just so I could dump her.
2610000	2612000	Which is hilarious.
2612000	2614000	Just saying.
2614000	2616000	Alright. Anyhow.
2616000	2618000	Well, in about 25
2618000	2620000	years, that might be the time when you can
2620000	2622000	actually play Blizzard's next MMO.
2622000	2624000	They've been working on a new game
2624000	2626000	that's called Titan, but that's a
2626000	2628000	code name. That is not the final name of the game.
2628000	2630000	That's just the code name internally. But it
2630000	2632000	came out this week from a site named VentureBeat
2632000	2634000	that there had been some big changes
2634000	2636000	with Titan. Blizzard internally
2636000	2638000	has postponed this game. There were
2638000	2640000	100 people working on the project, but this has
2640000	2642000	been reduced to 30. The other
2642000	2644000	folks had been put to work on other games.
2644000	2646000	Titan never had a release
2646000	2648000	date. It was never really confirmed by Blizzard.
2648000	2650000	But again, rumor and
2650000	2652000	all this, you know, speak is
2652000	2654000	saying that now the game will not be ready
2654000	2656000	until 2016. Well now,
2656000	2658000	usually I would just say whatever
2658000	2660000	it's a rumor, you know, I
2660000	2662000	don't know what to think about this. But
2662000	2664000	the network Xam, which
2664000	2666000	runs some popular World of Warcraft
2666000	2668000	sites like Wowhead, if you've played Wow, you probably
2668000	2670000	know that site, wowhead.com. Oh, Wowhead.
2670000	2672000	They reached out to Blizzard
2672000	2674000	and Blizzard actually said,
2674000	2676000	quote, we've always had a
2676000	2678000	highly iterative development process and the
2678000	2680000	unannounced MMO is no exception.
2680000	2682000	We've come to a point where we need to make some large
2682000	2684000	design and technology changes to the game.
2684000	2686000	We're using this opportunity to shift some of
2686000	2688000	our resources to assist with other projects, while
2688000	2690000	the core team adapts our technology
2690000	2692000	and tools to accommodate these new
2692000	2694000	changes. Note that we haven't announced any
2694000	2696000	dates for the MMO.
2696000	2698000	They kind of confirmed it
2698000	2700000	by saying that, which is really weird.
2700000	2702000	Like, you just would not expect Blizzard to
2702000	2704000	be that transparent, but they said
2704000	2706000	that. So,
2706000	2708000	but if you kind of look at what they're saying,
2708000	2710000	they're holding the game back to make technology
2710000	2712000	changes. That says to me, this thing
2712000	2714000	has been in development so long that
2714000	2716000	now it's looking old. It's been in
2716000	2718000	development Duke Nukem forever long.
2718000	2720000	In a way. I mean, I don't think it's been in
2720000	2722000	development Diablo 3 long, but it's getting
2722000	2724000	there. This thing's been in development for quite
2724000	2726000	a while. Now, granted, I
2726000	2728000	for one can't get upset about a game I
2728000	2730000	know literally nothing about. I mean,
2730000	2732000	it's exciting to know that Blizzard is working on
2732000	2734000	some secret unannounced project,
2734000	2736000	but I'm very happy to hear that nobody was laid
2736000	2738000	off. And if they shifted these
2738000	2740000	people to other resources, that just means
2740000	2742000	their other shit will get done faster, like
2742000	2744000	Hearthstone, the next WoW expansion might be
2744000	2746000	that much better for it. Maybe this
2746000	2748000	Blizzard Dota clone
2748000	2750000	that's All-Stars Blizzard characters,
2750000	2752000	maybe that will be that much better and will
2752000	2754000	actually come out sometime soon. Maybe we'll see that at
2754000	2756000	BlizzCon. Who knows? But,
2756000	2758000	so I can't say I'm going to get upset about this news,
2758000	2760000	especially hearing that they're going to shift the resources elsewhere,
2760000	2762000	but, you know,
2762000	2764000	it's a little bit, you kind of want to go,
2764000	2766000	I wish I could see what Blizzard's going to do that's like,
2766000	2768000	that's not Warcraft.
2768000	2770000	And granted, this could be World of Warcraft 2.
2770000	2772000	It could be.
2772000	2774000	Oh no, it took
2774000	2776000	Ragnarok Online long enough to get to a sequel.
2776000	2778000	I sort of think, I don't know, Tinfoil Hat
2778000	2780000	maybe, but I sort of think that the
2780000	2782000	next WoW expansion is going to finally
2782000	2784000	give that big graphical upgrade that's
2784000	2786000	going to modernize it, and they're not going to need
2786000	2788000	a World of Warcraft 2. Like, I just,
2788000	2790000	I just don't see Blizzard trying to make that happen
2790000	2792000	because it doesn't always happen so well for other
2792000	2794000	MMOs. But, then again,
2794000	2796000	Guild Wars and Guild Wars 2, coexisting
2796000	2798000	fine. Final Fantasy 11,
2798000	2800000	Final Fantasy XIV Reborn,
2800000	2802000	too soon to tell, but
2802000	2804000	looks promising.
2804000	2806000	Final Fantasy XIV, sorry,
2806000	2808000	pretty. Yeah, no, I know.
2808000	2810000	Cannot wait. Well, that's the importance of technology.
2810000	2812000	So, alright, anyhow,
2812000	2814000	one more story and then release dates. Dark Sakura.
2814000	2816000	Well, in other news,
2816000	2818000	and, god, what a disgusting ad
2818000	2820000	on this page.
2820000	2822000	Um, there,
2822000	2824000	okay, who remembers the rumor,
2824000	2826000	the big urban legend, about
2826000	2828000	a bajillion Atari
2828000	2830000	2600 ET cartridges
2830000	2832000	being buried.
2832000	2834000	I've definitely heard that, but they were melted
2834000	2836000	down before they were buried.
2836000	2838000	That's what I heard, and I think that's important to know.
2838000	2840000	Well, um, there is an
2840000	2842000	Ontario-based production company
2842000	2844000	called Fuel that
2844000	2846000	has signed a deal with
2846000	2848000	the, uh, basically,
2848000	2850000	it's a town in New Mexico,
2850000	2852000	I'm gonna ruin this, Alamogordo?
2852000	2854000	Alamogordo. Alamogordo, thank you.
2854000	2856000	Where the landfill
2856000	2858000	that supposedly, not just
2858000	2860000	E3 cartridges, but a ton of
2860000	2862000	Atari prototypes, prototype games,
2862000	2864000	prototype systems, anything that
2864000	2866000	was in development that they ended up not releasing
2866000	2868000	going into this dump. And the city
2868000	2870000	has given this production
2870000	2872000	company permission
2872000	2874000	to go digging through the dump.
2874000	2876000	They're going huge dumpster diving
2876000	2878000	in a landfill. This is digging
2878000	2880000	up a dead body
2880000	2882000	to see what the real cause of death was.
2882000	2884000	This is what this is.
2884000	2886000	To do a DNA test.
2886000	2888000	To give history to the urban legend,
2888000	2890000	they basically believed, and it wasn't melted down,
2890000	2892000	that they were crushed.
2892000	2894000	And loaded into, um,
2894000	2896000	semis and then buried.
2896000	2898000	Um,
2898000	2900000	but the, uh,
2900000	2902000	basically the mayor of there is saying
2902000	2904000	that they, uh, want people to find out
2904000	2906000	about the town because of the
2906000	2908000	landfill.
2908000	2910000	They're hoping it's good PR for the town.
2910000	2912000	So now it's a tourist thing. We have a bunch of shit games
2912000	2914000	in the dumpster back here.
2914000	2916000	Although, you know what, if they're prototypes
2916000	2918000	and stuff too though, that's the real gold mine.
2918000	2920000	Well, and you know that, um,
2920000	2922000	there are people who have, I'm saying,
2922000	2924000	escaped with prototypes
2924000	2926000	just in jest.
2926000	2928000	But you find a lot of 5200
2928000	2930000	prototypes, um,
2930000	2932000	online for sale. Where people have
2932000	2934000	gotten legit ROM dumps
2934000	2936000	and reconstituted
2936000	2938000	them for sale.
2938000	2940000	Our copy of Millipede for 5200
2940000	2942000	was, um, a, uh,
2942000	2944000	prototype.
2944000	2946000	But they crushed these, I mean, I had always heard they melted them down
2946000	2948000	but crushed makes a lot more sense.
2948000	2950000	You put them in the trash compactor and they crush down. They did that so that
2950000	2952000	looters wouldn't dig them up and try to sell them.
2952000	2954000	So, I mean, but then,
2954000	2956000	what's the point? You're gonna dig up
2956000	2958000	literally garbage that doesn't work.
2958000	2960000	It's 25 years old. Those things,
2960000	2962000	if a board is sitting outside a case that long
2962000	2964000	it's not gonna work. But if a memory chip
2964000	2966000	happens to have been compressed within
2966000	2968000	Good luck. I know, but
2968000	2970000	but the whole thing is that
2970000	2972000	the
2972000	2974000	there's a chance that it exists.
2974000	2976000	And people who
2976000	2978000	especially big
2978000	2980000	video game history buffs, Atari
2980000	2982000	fans, they're gonna drop
2982000	2984000	you know, the opportunity
2984000	2986000	to take, to see if there is
2986000	2988000	anything salvageable. Uh, Dungeon
2988000	2990000	Buster in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com
2990000	2992000	ET sucks. Dungeon Buster in the chatroom
2992000	2994000	at live.vognetwork.com says, I hope
2994000	2996000	that doesn't turn into another Capone's vault.
2996000	2998000	Will Geraldo Rivera be there when they
2998000	3000000	unearth the big massive ET cartridges?
3000000	3002000	Will he be there, live?
3002000	3004000	Does he have a career still?
3004000	3006000	No? So yes,
3006000	3008000	he will be.
3008000	3010000	He didn't, didn't the angry
3010000	3012000	video game nerd, like that was like the
3012000	3014000	basis of his movie was going to the dump to find
3014000	3016000	if the game exists. I
3016000	3018000	don't even know. I never saw it.
3018000	3020000	All right. Well, if we're done with the Atari story, I want
3020000	3022000	to go back real quick to the Titan thing because Technus
3022000	3024000	in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com made a very
3024000	3026000	good point about this. I want to throw this out there.
3026000	3028000	Technus says, I would speculate that
3028000	3030000	Bungie beat them to the punch with
3030000	3032000	Destiny and they needed to reset
3032000	3034000	after Activision picked up Bungie.
3034000	3036000	That's a really good theory
3036000	3038000	because again, rumors and
3038000	3040000	whisperings and you know, who knows
3040000	3042000	how much we can lend to this, but I did
3042000	3044000	hear that Titan was quite a bit like what
3044000	3046000	Destiny sounds like it's going to be. That
3046000	3048000	it was less of a shooter per se,
3048000	3050000	but that a lot of the same stuff they're talking
3050000	3052000	about implementing with
3052000	3054000	Destiny was supposed to be the types of stuff they
3054000	3056000	were doing with Titan too. You know,
3056000	3058000	take with a gigantic grain of salt.
3058000	3060000	Take with an entire can of salt actually.
3060000	3062000	Take with all the salt in the ocean. Salt lick.
3062000	3064000	Salt lick.
3064000	3066000	There you go. I have to
3066000	3068000	quote Queen Semia in chat. They find Hafa
3068000	3070000	under the pile. Plot twist.
3070000	3072000	Masked Bishop with some strong
3072000	3074000	opinions on Realm Reborn.
3074000	3076000	By the way, Final Fantasy XIV Realm
3076000	3078000	Reborn will succeed. If you think
3078000	3080000	Square Enix will let the Final Fantasy franchise
3080000	3082000	fail, you're sadly mistaken.
3082000	3084000	Final Fantasy XIV Realm
3084000	3086000	Reborn will be the next game changer.
3086000	3088000	I'll say this much, it's
3088000	3090000	impressive that they, I mean,
3090000	3092000	the second half of what he said at least
3092000	3094000	is true because Square
3094000	3096000	Enix put a lot of money to
3096000	3098000	basically redo the fucking game
3098000	3100000	from scratch. And you can see it.
3100000	3102000	You can really tell.
3102000	3104000	It's going to be interesting. Free to play
3104000	3106000	Final Fantasy XI. Come on.
3106000	3108000	Wouldn't that be something?
3108000	3110000	We'll see. Alright, let's check out
3110000	3112000	some games that will be coming out a little bit
3112000	3114000	sooner than Final Fantasy XV
3114000	3116000	or whatever else
3116000	3118000	we're thinking about here. Release dates.
3118000	3120000	Alright, so this week we've got PlayStation 3
3120000	3122000	or on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Remember
3122000	3124000	me? Coming out from Capcom.
3124000	3126000	Receiving kind of mixed reviews, but
3126000	3128000	whatever. Animal
3128000	3130000	Crossing on the 3DS or
3130000	3132000	Animal Crossing New Leaf
3132000	3134000	on the 3DS because there's
3134000	3136000	one single new leaf
3136000	3138000	in the game and the rest is all the same as the last
3138000	3140000	one.
3140000	3142000	The Skyrim,
3142000	3144000	Elder Scrolls V Skyrim Legendary Edition
3144000	3146000	kind of re-released the game with the
3146000	3148000	DLC on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360
3148000	3150000	and PC.
3150000	3152000	And at long
3152000	3154000	last, if you don't have the
3154000	3156000	internet and you
3156000	3158000	want to play Minecraft, Minecraft
3158000	3160000	on the Xbox 360, the Xbox
3160000	3162000	360 version is coming out as a
3162000	3164000	disc version. That might be a
3164000	3166000	good one for the Xbox 360 in the kid's
3166000	3168000	room that's not hooked up to the internet.
3168000	3170000	I could see that being a plus because Minecraft
3170000	3172000	is a pretty friendly kid's game. It is an awesome
3172000	3174000	game. So,
3174000	3176000	there's that. And that's
3176000	3178000	pretty much it this week.
3178000	3180000	Alright, coming out
3180000	3182000	in Japan on the PlayStation 3
3182000	3184000	Galgun gets a price reduction into the
3184000	3186000	best series. Haha, yeah. And there's
3186000	3188000	another game called
3188000	3190000	Narawatera Gakuen
3190000	3192000	Gekijoban Anime
3192000	3194000	and Complete Setting Book Hybrid
3194000	3196000	Disc. So I think this is actually the
3196000	3198000	anime and like a game
3198000	3200000	based on the anime all on one disc.
3200000	3202000	That is my, because you see this happening more
3202000	3204000	and more in Japan where you get
3204000	3206000	like the bundled Blu-ray that
3206000	3208000	has a game and a movie or at least, you know
3208000	3210000	two separate Blu-rays or whatever
3210000	3212000	in a bundle collection. On the
3212000	3214000	Xbox 360, Halo Origin Pack
3214000	3216000	this week in Japan for all
3216000	3218000	you Halo fans in Origin. Also, Minecraft
3218000	3220000	Xbox 360 edition, the standalone game
3220000	3222000	is out in Japan as well. And a new
3222000	3224000	camouflage 360 wireless controller
3224000	3226000	in Japan. I guess this is to go with the Halo
3226000	3228000	Origin Pack. Which by the way
3228000	3230000	quickly while it's on my mind
3230000	3232000	do you think Microsoft at E3
3232000	3234000	is going to have anything to kind of throw something
3234000	3236000	at Japan to try and make it
3236000	3238000	work there? I don't think they're going to try.
3238000	3240000	Really? Yeah. I thought I read somewhere that
3240000	3242000	they did say they are committed to Japan but
3242000	3244000	that could have just been smoke up my ass. I don't know. I think it's smoke
3244000	3246000	up their ass. They'll release a game with
3246000	3248000	a pillow and a clock. It's just
3248000	3250000	I think the market's so small there
3250000	3252000	now. It's just, I don't know
3252000	3254000	they're just more focused on the larger market.
3254000	3256000	Microsoft's market is small but
3256000	3258000	certainly there's, handhelds
3258000	3260000	is really what it seems to be about.
3260000	3262000	Nothing of note on the
3262000	3264000	PlayStation Vita this week.
3264000	3266000	Looking at, oh I already did
3266000	3268000	Xbox 360. Way to go.
3268000	3270000	Seeing if there's anything on the Wii U. Actually yes,
3270000	3272000	Rabbids Land is supposed to be out in Japan this week.
3272000	3274000	The game that got delayed here
3274000	3276000	supposedly coming out in Japan.
3276000	3278000	No, Rabbids Land was a launch title
3278000	3280000	for the Wii U. Oh, I'm thinking of the
3280000	3282000	other Rabbids game. Yeah, you're thinking of Rayman
3282000	3284000	Legends. My bad. My bad.
3284000	3286000	Let's see, on the
3286000	3288000	3DS in Japan this week
3288000	3290000	nothing of note.
3290000	3292000	On the PSP this week
3292000	3294000	God Eater Burst gets a price
3294000	3296000	reduction. So lots of price
3296000	3298000	reductions this week but really not a lot of new games
3298000	3300000	until we get to about June 20th.
3300000	3302000	Seems to be when the next batch of big games comes out.
3302000	3304000	Really
3304000	3306000	nothing to say on Nintendo 3DS either.
3306000	3308000	Japan gets Donkey Kong Returns 3D
3308000	3310000	next week on the 13th
3310000	3312000	and a metallic red DS to go with that.
3312000	3314000	I did pick up Donkey Kong Country Returns by the way
3314000	3316000	for my DS. Haven't really played enough of it yet
3316000	3318000	to review it though. On my plane
3318000	3320000	ride this week I plan to play some more of it so
3320000	3322000	I'll let you know. Did I tell you we might finally
3322000	3324000	be getting 3DSes? Oh no,
3324000	3326000	that's great. Because there's gonna be
3326000	3328000	like a new massive
3328000	3330000	uh
3332000	3334000	I know Apollo Justice is in it.
3334000	3336000	I'm trying to remember. Oh, Phoenix Wright.
3336000	3338000	Phoenix Wright, thank you.
3338000	3340000	A new game coming out and Fire Emblem
3340000	3342000	and then I want
3342000	3344000	Animal Crossing.
3344000	3346000	Alright, how about the UK? What's coming out over there?
3346000	3348000	Some stuff. On the 3rd we have
3348000	3350000	Gunpoint for PC
3350000	3352000	and Scrolls for PC and Mac
3352000	3354000	and on 7th we have Remember Me
3354000	3356000	PC, Xbox 360, PS3 and that would be it.
3358000	3360000	To register participation for this week's
3360000	3362000	episode of Orange Lounge Radio at
3362000	3364000	vognetwork.com, use the passphrase
3364000	3366000	OVEN.
3366000	3368000	Just a couple more stories for you guys than the classic
3368000	3370000	game of the week, but first, Loki.
3370000	3372000	Um, so this is kind of
3372000	3374000	I guess
3374000	3376000	the best news that could come out of the situation
3376000	3378000	because we know that this is only alluding to
3378000	3380000	worse things to come
3380000	3382000	on the next gen consoles
3382000	3384000	but EA is eliminating, they
3384000	3386000	already went ahead and said that they're not gonna have
3386000	3388000	the online pass in any future games
3388000	3390000	and now they're going back and retroactively
3390000	3392000	taking away the online pass
3392000	3394000	from all the old games as well
3394000	3396000	so the online pass now is free
3396000	3398000	so if you wanna, you know
3398000	3400000	play a used EA game
3400000	3402000	that had the online pass, you buy the game
3402000	3404000	and then you activate
3404000	3406000	the online pass for free. So that's
3406000	3408000	nice.
3408000	3410000	There's just something about this.
3410000	3412000	As we just continue
3412000	3414000	online pass for our new EA titles
3414000	3416000	we're also in the process of eliminating it from our
3416000	3418000	existing EA titles. We heard the feedback
3418000	3420000	from players and decided to do away with
3420000	3422000	the online pass altogether.
3422000	3424000	Yeah.
3424000	3426000	I don't trust them. I totally
3426000	3428000	believe that you, oh what we're doing
3428000	3430000	is wrong. You know what?
3430000	3432000	I don't know what it is. I don't know what it is
3432000	3434000	and maybe I am just being
3434000	3436000	a jerk, but it's like one of those things where it's like
3436000	3438000	are you sure that when you download the free
3438000	3440000	thing it doesn't say, uh, but you
3440000	3442000	are giving us your soul? Like are you sure there's
3442000	3444000	nothing in there like that? I just
3444000	3446000	worry. I'm sorry but
3446000	3448000	I know better.
3448000	3450000	It's just, it's
3450000	3452000	so much bullshit. I just don't
3452000	3454000	believe any of that crap.
3454000	3456000	I roll my eyes.
3456000	3458000	We've made too much money
3458000	3460000	America and the world and
3460000	3462000	we're just gonna stop making
3462000	3464000	extra money now because we have all the money that
3464000	3466000	we need to run those servers now so we don't need
3466000	3468000	any of your online passes anymore because
3468000	3470000	servers all of a sudden got cheaper to run.
3470000	3472000	No, I'm sorry. That's
3472000	3474000	this is a company that makes
3474000	3476000	money. They're not gonna say, hey, we
3476000	3478000	hate money all of a sudden. Right?
3478000	3480000	No. There's just something I don't
3480000	3482000	trust.
3482000	3484000	Call me a conspiracy
3484000	3486000	there. Or maybe, you know, if
3486000	3488000	I take this as an actual
3488000	3490000	legit sign, maybe it's them trying to get away from the
3490000	3492000	business tactics of the former CEO.
3492000	3494000	Now you're being
3494000	3496000	nice. I know. I've decided to
3496000	3498000	play angels advocate.
3498000	3500000	Or it could be
3500000	3502000	in-game purchases
3502000	3504000	in Dead Space 3
3504000	3506000	in future games.
3506000	3508000	But if
3508000	3510000	I want to put it at a non-conspiracy
3510000	3512000	theory point of view, even though
3512000	3514000	I trust EA as far as
3514000	3516000	I can pick up the entire building and
3516000	3518000	nudge it,
3518000	3520000	maybe
3520000	3522000	it is trying to separate themselves from former business
3522000	3524000	practice. Or it's trying to get people to
3524000	3526000	install Origin, which I will not fucking
3526000	3528000	do.
3528000	3530000	Tigerclaw with a theory in chat at
3530000	3532000	live.vognetware.com says, EA removes
3532000	3534000	the online pass
3534000	3536000	so people can play the used
3536000	3538000	games online. And then a few months later,
3538000	3540000	EA shuts down the online servers to those games.
3540000	3542000	Actually,
3544000	3546000	that is kind of funny. But here's the thing
3546000	3548000	with some of these games. They're
3548000	3550000	not online games.
3550000	3552000	That was the thing that was
3552000	3554000	kind of the funny part about the online pass. Remember
3554000	3556000	like, Dragon Age Origins,
3556000	3558000	Dragon Age 2.
3558000	3560000	Mass Effect 2 had that Cerberus pass, and it wasn't
3560000	3562000	really, you didn't play online.
3562000	3564000	It was DLC.
3564000	3566000	My hope is that with all of this
3566000	3568000	that it means I won't have to fucking be online
3568000	3570000	for my DLC in Mass Effect 3 to load.
3570000	3572000	Because I paid for a lot of it.
3572000	3574000	Okay, I'm a
3574000	3576000	consumer whore, I don't care.
3576000	3578000	And how.
3578000	3580000	Yeah, mister, I'm gonna
3580000	3582000	buy Mass Effect 3 trilogy and
3582000	3584000	run it on Xbox and PC.
3584000	3586000	You know what, you're worse than me, okay?
3586000	3588000	Okay, well,
3588000	3590000	maybe I play more than you do.
3590000	3592000	I play other games too, though.
3592000	3594000	You're seriously like my dealer, you and
3594000	3596000	Shane. I blame you
3596000	3598000	for everything that happens in my life.
3598000	3600000	Shane is worse. And I haven't started on
3600000	3602000	Persona, so.
3602000	3604000	Don't resist. I will resist.
3604000	3606000	My will is strong.
3606000	3608000	My will is titanium. By the way, there's now
3608000	3610000	music from Persona 4 in rotation at
3610000	3612000	I just put some in today.
3612000	3614000	You know what, I actually kind of
3614000	3616000	I'm playing too much shit already.
3616000	3618000	Alright.
3618000	3620000	Going to one more story here.
3620000	3622000	This actually came up last week, but
3622000	3624000	it's too good for us to skip completely on our
3624000	3626000	show. We've gotta mention it. Actually, maybe
3626000	3628000	it, I don't, when did this finish? I think it
3628000	3630000	finished like on Saturday or Sunday
3630000	3632000	of last week. But anyhow, here's the
3632000	3634000	deal. So, did you guys ever check out the
3634000	3636000	iPhone and Android game? Curiosity!
3636000	3638000	What's in the cube?
3638000	3640000	It's Peter Molyneux's dick
3640000	3642000	in a box. Remember this game where you
3642000	3644000	tap the little cube? If this was last week, this
3644000	3646000	was me not having much in the way of internet
3646000	3648000	access, except for Tumblr.
3648000	3650000	Finally, what was in the box
3650000	3652000	was revealed. Some dude opened
3652000	3654000	the box. You win nothing!
3654000	3656000	You're so stupid!
3656000	3658000	Well, here's what's
3658000	3660000	amazing. The guy who won is an
3660000	3662000	18 year old guy, Brian Henderson. He
3662000	3664000	lives in Edinburgh. And he
3664000	3666000	won. And the great thing about
3666000	3668000	it, he ended up tweeting or saying in an
3668000	3670000	interview, I don't remember where it was, but he said,
3670000	3672000	yeah, I just downloaded the game an hour
3672000	3674000	before I won it.
3676000	3678000	So, what was in
3678000	3680000	the goddamn cube? See, I would have
3680000	3682000	played to the very end, too, if I had remembered
3682000	3684000	that it was ending, but I was just like, eh, I don't fucking
3684000	3686000	care. Here's, guess what was in the
3686000	3688000	goddamn cube. I'm sure many of you have heard, but here's
3688000	3690000	what was in the cube.
3690000	3692000	You, again, now 22Cans
3692000	3694000	is, they did Curiosity. Their next
3694000	3696000	project is like a populous reimagining
3696000	3698000	called Goddess. Well,
3698000	3700000	Brian will be
3700000	3702000	the god in Goddess.
3702000	3704000	At the
3704000	3706000	Stardust. No.
3706000	3708000	But he will be, he will be in...
3708000	3710000	You don't know shit.
3712000	3714000	I can't believe this.
3714000	3716000	Some new kid from the
3716000	3718000	street won this. You don't
3718000	3720000	know shit.
3720000	3722000	You are a whore, darlin'.
3722000	3724000	A show where we can fall into
3724000	3726000	showgirls' quotes is a good show.
3726000	3728000	That game is called Goddess, and it just
3728000	3730000	makes me think of showgirls. Sorry, Nomi Malone.
3730000	3732000	That's right. Nomi Malone from
3732000	3734000	Edinburgh.
3734000	3736000	I'm sorry to this kid. This poor kid didn't ask
3736000	3738000	for this, so I'm very sorry.
3738000	3740000	But I'm gonna make the joke anyway. I'm doing the hand
3740000	3742000	flashies in my head.
3742000	3744000	Nomi Malone
3744000	3746000	from Edinburgh opened the
3746000	3748000	cube and will get to be the god
3748000	3750000	in Goddess.
3750000	3752000	And apparently,
3752000	3754000	not only will he be the god, but he will
3754000	3756000	have a hand in creating the rules that will
3756000	3758000	govern the game. So it's
3758000	3760000	his rules, or get out, and Brian
3760000	3762000	gets to share in the revenue
3762000	3764000	generated by Goddess. But they're saying
3764000	3766000	in one year, he could be
3766000	3768000	pushed down a flight of stairs
3768000	3770000	and a new Goddess
3770000	3772000	could emerge.
3774000	3776000	Here's the thing.
3776000	3778000	When did this
3778000	3780000	whole thing, this cube
3780000	3782000	thing launched, like what, seven months
3782000	3784000	ago, right? Didn't Goddess
3784000	3786000	get kick-started midway through
3786000	3788000	this project? Kick-started? Yeah, that's
3788000	3790000	my new verb. Didn't it get kick-started?
3790000	3792000	Where would it be kick-started? Kick-started.
3792000	3794000	Cause the website is kick-starter.
3794000	3796000	Not kick-start. Alright.
3796000	3798000	Are you gonna kick-start my heart? No.
3798000	3800000	So Goddess got
3800000	3802000	kick-started halfway through
3802000	3804000	the run of
3804000	3806000	cube. What if it hadn't gone
3806000	3808000	through? Then what would have been
3808000	3810000	in the cube?
3810000	3812000	I got you!
3812000	3814000	You are making this shit
3814000	3816000	up as you go along, Peter Molyneux.
3816000	3818000	I got you!
3818000	3820000	Shrugner's box
3820000	3822000	or whatever, it's basically...
3822000	3824000	There's a dead cat who's not dead.
3824000	3826000	Yeah, so it's Goddess, but
3826000	3828000	not Goddess. We won't
3828000	3830000	know, because it was Goddess in the box
3830000	3832000	and not Goddess dead
3832000	3834000	having eaten the poison.
3834000	3836000	You know what it would have been?
3836000	3838000	It would have been a dog.
3838000	3840000	He would have adopted a dog for you. It would have been
3840000	3842000	life-changing.
3842000	3844000	A dog. Or,
3844000	3846000	guess what?
3846000	3848000	I've got this
3848000	3850000	boy named Milo, and you're going to
3850000	3852000	adopt him.
3852000	3854000	Having kids is gonna
3854000	3856000	change your life.
3856000	3858000	Milo will change your life.
3858000	3860000	Milo needs
3860000	3862000	his diaper changed every five seconds
3862000	3864000	and you'll want to die.
3864000	3866000	Alright, well we reached out to Peter Molyneux
3866000	3868000	for comment on Goddess, and this is what
3868000	3870000	he had to say.
3870000	3872000	Must be weird not having anybody come on you.
3872000	3874000	What does that even mean?
3874000	3876000	What does that
3876000	3878000	even mean?
3878000	3880000	That was a quote from
3880000	3882000	Showgirls, get it? Alright. I will give you the
3882000	3884000	best Fable game ever made.
3884000	3886000	It's Fable
3886000	3888000	Fable the Journey. It uses
3888000	3890000	Kinect. It's fantastic. It's not on
3890000	3892000	rails. It's not on rails.
3896000	3898000	Oh, shit. Alright, let's go. Hey, I'll tell you what.
3898000	3900000	You know what? I've been inside the box if
3900000	3902000	perhaps Peter Molyneux wasn't backing this
3902000	3904000	and it was the Steam Box.
3904000	3906000	Hats! Would have been fucking hats.
3906000	3908000	Lots of hats. Hats, hats, hats.
3908000	3910000	Let's travel.
3910000	3912000	Let's travel back. Do we have like a
3912000	3914000	gif?
3914000	3916000	I think
3916000	3918000	it's funny that we both grunted at him
3918000	3920000	at the same time.
3920000	3922000	I don't care what he said.
3922000	3924000	It is gif. I do not care.
3924000	3926000	I disavow him. Anyway, wouldn't it be
3926000	3928000	awesome if they had like an animated gif?
3928000	3930000	They had like, you know, the Matrix thing
3930000	3932000	where all these hats come in. We're gonna need hats.
3932000	3934000	Woof.
3934000	3936000	Okay, Rob, you sounded like
3936000	3938000	Grover slash Yoda.
3938000	3940000	Near
3940000	3942000	far.
3944000	3946000	Let's travel back to a time.
3946000	3948000	When gaming was
3948000	3950000	so much simpler. When you know what
3950000	3952000	Elizabeth Berkley was Jessie Spano
3952000	3954000	and you hadn't seen her boobies yet. It's a much
3954000	3956000	simpler time. It's the classic game
3956000	3958000	of the week. Dark
3958000	3960000	Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?
3960000	3962000	Sonic R.
3962000	3964000	Yes, it is Sonic R. I have finally
3964000	3966000	decided to do fucking Sonic R.
3966000	3968000	So.
3968000	3970000	Sonic R
3970000	3972000	was done by Traveler's Tales
3972000	3974000	and Sonic Team and it came
3974000	3976000	out on the Sega Saturn
3976000	3978000	and Windows.
3978000	3980000	It was out for Windows, which actually,
3980000	3982000	if you've got a decent graphics card, the Windows version
3982000	3984000	actually looks a lot better and plays better.
3984000	3986000	It came out in the US on October 31,
3986000	3988000	1997 and then
3988000	3990000	later it came out in
3990000	3992000	Europe, Australia, and Japan all at the same time
3992000	3994000	and was re-released for PlayStation 2
3994000	3996000	and the GameCube as part of
3996000	3998000	the Sonic Gems collection.
3998000	4000000	It is basically
4000000	4002000	the last of the
4002000	4004000	two, I'm sorry, the third Sonic
4004000	4006000	racing game and the last of
4006000	4008000	two games that was done by Traveler's Tales
4008000	4010000	and Sonic Team. So basically, it's a huge
4010000	4012000	foot race. That's what the game is.
4012000	4014000	And it's single or
4014000	4016000	multiplayer. You can race.
4016000	4018000	You have ten different Sonic characters
4018000	4020000	and
4020000	4022000	you know, you can pick
4022000	4024000	up like, you have to collect
4024000	4026000	rings on the way to open up different parts of
4026000	4028000	the race track. You also
4028000	4030000	can get like
4030000	4032000	different shields like what's
4032000	4034000	in Sonic 3. Like you can actually get a lightning
4034000	4036000	shield that attracts rings to you.
4036000	4038000	And you
4038000	4040000	have different areas
4040000	4042000	that are sort of based off of
4042000	4044000	various places
4044000	4046000	in the different Sonic games. Like you have a place
4046000	4048000	that looks like the Green Hill Zone and a place that looks like
4048000	4050000	the Chemical Plant. You
4050000	4052000	have those item panels like I was talking about
4052000	4054000	that give you different abilities
4054000	4056000	as you go. Like you can run on water
4056000	4058000	or attract rings. And
4058000	4060000	then you get Sonic Tokens and
4060000	4062000	Chaos Emeralds. And the Chaos Emeralds
4062000	4064000	help you unlock secret characters.
4064000	4066000	You also have different kinds of weather.
4066000	4068000	You have clear, you have rain, you have snow.
4068000	4070000	But the snow does
4070000	4072000	make the water free so you can run over
4072000	4074000	it instead of being slowed
4074000	4076000	down by it. And
4076000	4078000	you have a time attack mode to see basically
4078000	4080000	who has the fastest time. So
4080000	4082000	the characters in this one
4082000	4084000	is you are, let's see,
4084000	4086000	you have Sonic and he has double jump.
4086000	4088000	He's also the fastest. Tails
4088000	4090000	actually has the ability to fly. Knuckles
4090000	4092000	can glide.
4092000	4094000	And then you have Amy
4094000	4096000	Rose who actually drives a car. And she
4096000	4098000	can hover over water and gets extra
4098000	4100000	speed boost. For
4100000	4102000	your secret characters you have
4102000	4104000	Robotnik, also known as Eggman.
4104000	4106000	He has a hovercraft
4106000	4108000	and can resist terrain. You have
4108000	4110000	Metal Sonic. You have
4110000	4112000	a Tails doll and you have
4112000	4114000	Metal Knuckles. You have
4114000	4116000	Egg Robo and Super
4116000	4118000	Sonic. So basically when you have all the Chaos
4118000	4120000	Emeralds you can play as Super Sonic and you just
4120000	4122000	sort of float over everything.
4122000	4124000	The game actually
4124000	4126000	came out after Sonic 3D Blast
4126000	4128000	when Sega was working with Traveler's
4128000	4130000	Tails on a different Sonic game.
4130000	4132000	And they had also
4132000	4134000	been working on a 3D graphics
4134000	4136000	engine that they didn't really have anything
4136000	4138000	for so they decided to work with Sonic Team to make
4138000	4140000	the game. Pretty much just
4140000	4142000	everything that came together.
4142000	4144000	So there's actually even
4144000	4146000	a Sonic R that came out on the
4146000	4148000	Tiger handheld system.
4148000	4150000	Of course like I said
4150000	4152000	there was the Sega Saturn version that actually
4152000	4154000	had some really bad problems with draw distance
4154000	4156000	and clipping.
4156000	4158000	But the PC version
4158000	4160000	let you use better rendering
4160000	4162000	and 3D acceleration and you
4162000	4164000	could adjust the draw distance. So basically like
4164000	4166000	today you could have no draw distance
4166000	4168000	at all in the game. It would be gorgeous.
4168000	4170000	The music was done by Richard
4170000	4172000	Jacques of Sega Europe
4172000	4174000	who also did the music
4174000	4176000	for Sonic 3D Blast.
4176000	4178000	And he
4178000	4180000	basically worked with Yuji Naka
4180000	4182000	to
4182000	4184000	basically design the musical
4184000	4186000	feel of the game.
4186000	4188000	And that's where we got the Super Sonic Racing.
4188000	4190000	And then the
4190000	4192000	singer in this one, now this I didn't know, her name
4192000	4194000	is TJ Davis and she did
4194000	4196000	all of the singing in it at
4196000	4198000	Yuji Naka's request.
4198000	4200000	So basically
4200000	4202000	it was done by a London
4202000	4204000	studio. The music came out of
4204000	4206000	London.
4206000	4208000	I think it's a fun game. It's sort of
4208000	4210000	not like the world's best
4210000	4212000	Sonic game. But it's a really
4212000	4214000	fun game. And from that we also
4214000	4216000	got
4216000	4218000	well there were two games that came out before
4218000	4220000	Sonic R. There was Sonic Drift and Sonic Drift 2
4220000	4222000	for Game Gear. And then
4222000	4224000	after that we've gotten Sonic Riders
4224000	4226000	we've gotten Sonic Riders
4226000	4228000	Zero Gravity, Sonic Free Riders,
4228000	4230000	Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing,
4230000	4232000	and the Transformed version as well.
4232000	4234000	Those are all pretty much born out of the Sonic R
4234000	4236000	franchise. And
4236000	4238000	of course the music is
4238000	4240000	you know, pretty much the big
4240000	4242000	iconic thing about it. It's not the most
4242000	4244000	gorgeous game. But it's super fun.
4244000	4246000	Like we said
4246000	4248000	we say a system is only as good as the games
4248000	4250000	that are on it. But the games are also
4250000	4252000	can be
4252000	4254000	absolutely amazing without
4254000	4256000	having to look, you know, absolutely gorgeous.
4256000	4258000	You know what I mean? And this is one of
4258000	4260000	those that falls into that
4260000	4262000	category. So my game
4262000	4264000	of the week is Sonic R.
4266000	4268000	This is one of those games that to me just made
4268000	4270000	sense. Like Sonic in a racing game.
4270000	4272000	Why did it take so long?
4272000	4274000	Kinda right.
4274000	4276000	And it did have some good music.
4276000	4278000	Super Sonic Racing was in Sonic R,
4278000	4280000	Tiger Hall.
4280000	4282000	Alright. There it is, your classic game of the week
4282000	4284000	Sonic R.
4284000	4286000	Good pick.
4286000	4288000	Have you done every single Sonic game yet? You gotta be getting close.
4288000	4290000	I've done a few of them.
4290000	4292000	But keep in mind there's a bunch of crap out there
4292000	4294000	in the Sonic franchise.
4294000	4296000	I would get
4296000	4298000	Sonic herpes or something.
4298000	4300000	Alright. We're gonna take a break and when we
4300000	4302000	come back there is still more news to come in the
4302000	4304000	Fugu question of the week. Oh and to tell what up G?
4304000	4306000	Same music in Japan.
4306000	4308000	All out of the London studio. So there's none of this
4308000	4310000	whole one soundtrack? No there's not.
4310000	4312000	Just making sure. Good. At least we can all agree on something.
4312000	4314000	Okay. Plenty more
4314000	4316000	to come when Orange Lounge Radio returns
4316000	4318000	with this episode number 506
4318000	4320000	Second Mix J Append Part B
4320000	4322000	right after this.
4322000	4324000	Hola.
4324000	4326000	This is your friendly neighborhood Mexican
4326000	4328000	Acta. And you're participating with
4328000	4330000	Orange Lounge Radio. The show where
4330000	4332000	every gamer has a voice.
4332000	4334000	And I want to use my voice to tell you that
4334000	4336000	Kirby does not suck.
4336000	4338000	Well, literally he does suck.
4338000	4340000	But not fear of the blue.
4340000	4342000	Anyways, play more Kirby.
4342000	4344000	I'll see you in the next video.
4344000	4346000	Bye.
4353000	4355000	That's right. Play more Kirby.
4355000	4357000	They have that whole Wii U virtual console thing going on
4357000	4359000	right now. I was tempted to get the
4359000	4361000	Kirby golf
4361000	4363000	was it Kirby's Dream Course that they had at Super
4363000	4365000	Nintendo? It was like the miniature golf game.
4365000	4367000	I think it was awesome.
4367000	4369000	Good times. There you go.
4369000	4371000	You too can leave a bumper.
4371000	4373000	Go to vognetwork.com and check out the
4373000	4375000	forums for Orange Lounge Radio and more information
4375000	4377000	on there if you want to use your voice
4377000	4379000	to tell the gaming world something. Maybe
4379000	4381000	you want them to play less Kirby.
4381000	4383000	You can tell us that in a future bumper.
4383000	4385000	That was the last one that I had in the queue by the way.
4385000	4387000	So you're going to start hearing repeats if I don't
4387000	4389000	get any new ones for the next show. Just saying.
4389000	4391000	That's my little threat. Just saying.
4391000	4393000	Alright.
4393000	4395000	During the break tonight, before we get into rapid fire
4395000	4397000	news, I noticed some of the chatters were talking about
4397000	4399000	Civ 5. And I don't know how this got brought up
4399000	4401000	but apparently the Mass Effect mods
4401000	4403000	for Civ 5. I thought
4403000	4405000	I mentioned this on the show before. Yes, they exist
4405000	4407000	and they're awesome.
4407000	4409000	Fun fact.
4409000	4411000	You once said that about Mass
4411000	4413000	Effects.
4413000	4415000	Here's something.
4415000	4417000	I have never
4417000	4419000	liked that type of game.
4419000	4421000	I didn't even...
4421000	4423000	I admit that...
4423000	4425000	What game is it I'm thinking of now?
4425000	4427000	Not Populous.
4427000	4429000	Well, I didn't like Populous either.
4429000	4431000	SimCity?
4431000	4433000	Are we? Uh oh.
4433000	4435000	I thought I hit all the buttons.
4435000	4437000	I just happened to look over and saw that we were
4437000	4439000	muted so all of this conversation that's
4439000	4441000	happening...
4441000	4443000	Professional radio folks.
4443000	4445000	You know what?
4445000	4447000	Rob was giving me crap for not
4447000	4449000	wanting to play Civ even though there's
4449000	4451000	a Mass Effect mod. And I
4451000	4453000	was telling him how I did not like
4453000	4455000	Civ. I don't
4455000	4457000	like SimCity.
4457000	4459000	I do not like SimCoaster.
4459000	4461000	Although I do like watching the coasters
4461000	4463000	that people have made on SimCoaster.
4463000	4465000	I don't like SimPark.
4465000	4467000	I like the Sims, but really I like building
4467000	4469000	houses and dressing them up.
4469000	4471000	And murdering them. What about SimAnt?
4471000	4473000	I don't like SimAnt either.
4473000	4475000	I loved SimAnt. That game was amazing.
4475000	4477000	I do like semantics.
4477000	4479000	Ha ha ha.
4479000	4481000	But what's the game I'm thinking of? It's not Populous.
4481000	4483000	It's where you're the avatar
4483000	4485000	of the god and you go and you
4485000	4487000	fight demons and you build the town
4487000	4489000	and make them worship you and shit.
4489000	4491000	Actraiser? Thank you, Actraiser. I don't even
4491000	4493000	really care for Actraiser that much.
4493000	4495000	Get out. Let me finish.
4495000	4497000	I like watching other people play
4497000	4499000	Actraiser. I get pissed
4499000	4501000	off. So I
4501000	4503000	don't have the patience for Actraiser.
4503000	4505000	Two things about Actraiser. A. The soundtrack.
4505000	4507000	Is great. B.
4507000	4509000	When that angel flies around you can see his butt.
4509000	4511000	It was butt.
4511000	4513000	And this is how Rob first learned. No.
4513000	4515000	It was butt on the Super Nintendo.
4515000	4517000	So it made you giggle a little bit. You know butt.
4517000	4519000	It was butt.
4521000	4523000	You know what? Butt.
4523000	4525000	Ha ha ha. That's what.
4525000	4527000	No. From now on it's said chicken but it's angel butt.
4527000	4529000	Guess what? Angel butt.
4529000	4531000	Alright. Let's go around
4531000	4533000	and talk about rapidly what's
4533000	4535000	happening in the world of gaming. Some quick stories.
4535000	4537000	Rapid fire news.
4537000	4539000	This may be a bit of a spoiler but
4539000	4541000	we think
4541000	4543000	maybe Mirrors Edge 2 might be coming to the
4543000	4545000	Xbox One. Apparently there was
4545000	4547000	first off a listing on
4547000	4549000	an Italian. The German and
4549000	4551000	Italian storefronts for Amazon.
4551000	4553000	And those are removed.
4553000	4555000	Listing it was for the Xbox One.
4555000	4557000	And then
4557000	4559000	on EA's own website
4559000	4561000	in the help
4561000	4563000	section. Their help center.
4563000	4565000	Had a page for Mirrors Edge 2 and now
4565000	4567000	it's gone. So
4567000	4569000	makes me think that maybe
4569000	4571000	that's going to be one of the announcements.
4571000	4573000	Perhaps.
4573000	4575000	I guess we'll find out. Yes please.
4575000	4577000	And then
4577000	4579000	of course Prey 2
4579000	4581000	has been in development forever.
4581000	4583000	And now apparently
4583000	4585000	it's going to be under development by
4585000	4587000	Arkane Austin which was
4587000	4589000	the studio behind Dishonored.
4589000	4591000	So that sounds good because Dishonored wasn't that bad.
4591000	4593000	And yeah
4593000	4595000	they don't have any. They have no
4595000	4597000	information to share but
4597000	4599000	that's the rumor at least.
4599000	4601000	That hasn't been cancelled.
4601000	4603000	And last but not least
4603000	4605000	um
4605000	4607000	El Shaddai. I don't know if
4607000	4609000	you guys remember that game. It's kind of an
4609000	4611000	artsy action game from
4611000	4613000	Ignition. Well now
4613000	4615000	the rights
4615000	4617000	have been transferred to the creator.
4617000	4619000	So now there's going to be
4619000	4621000	well El Shaddai is now
4621000	4623000	back in the creators
4623000	4625000	I guess portfolio
4625000	4627000	as far as the rights go and maybe
4627000	4629000	that means it's going to open up opportunity
4629000	4631000	for more games. You know what's making me cry right now?
4631000	4633000	Every time
4633000	4635000	anyone talks about that game I hear Amy Grant.
4635000	4637000	Baby baby.
4637000	4639000	No no no because she
4639000	4641000	when she was like heavy heavy into
4641000	4643000	her Christian singing mode she did a song called
4643000	4645000	El Shaddai.
4645000	4647000	Keep in mind I was raised Baptist.
4647000	4649000	Ok here's the thing. The references
4649000	4651000	on this show are getting more and more obscure.
4651000	4653000	Ok well the full title
4653000	4655000	was El Shaddai the Ascension of the Metatron
4655000	4657000	so it's you know. Did she do a song
4657000	4659000	called Metatron? No
4659000	4661000	but I just finished watching the season
4661000	4663000	Supernatural and there's Metatron in it.
4663000	4665000	Lordy.
4665000	4667000	So let's
4667000	4669000	see. Metatron.
4669000	4671000	Yeah.
4671000	4673000	And sorry
4673000	4675000	Brad I adore you to death.
4675000	4677000	It was a decent song but her Hebrew
4677000	4679000	was awful.
4679000	4681000	Alright moving on. I'm
4681000	4683000	shocked that so many people know that
4683000	4685000	Amy Grant song. I only remember
4685000	4687000	baby baby
4687000	4689000	something something lyrics.
4689000	4691000	There's one song that she did that I really
4691000	4693000	like and that was the duet she did with Vince Gill
4693000	4695000	who she married. Just saying.
4695000	4697000	What ever happened to her? She's still
4697000	4699000	recording and still married to Vince Gill.
4699000	4701000	She's still recording?
4701000	4703000	Yeah I actually
4703000	4705000	believe it or not the only
4705000	4707000	side I could get working was Wikipedia.
4707000	4709000	And
4709000	4711000	I
4711000	4713000	was reading up about
4713000	4715000	actually Vince Gill but it linked to
4715000	4717000	Amy Grant so I was like.
4717000	4719000	Isn't that amazing how on Wikipedia
4719000	4721000	you could just. She married him.
4721000	4723000	She's married to Vince Gill. I believe you.
4723000	4725000	Mom was watching that Oklahoma relief
4725000	4727000	thing and Vince Gill was on it so we looked at Vince Gill
4727000	4729000	and it led to Amy Grant.
4733000	4735000	She's back to doing super
4735000	4737000	Christian stuff.
4737000	4739000	And singing with Vince.
4739000	4741000	Jamie
4741000	4743000	Jamie.
4743000	4745000	Oh.
4745000	4747000	Oh.
4747000	4749000	Oh.
4749000	4751000	For the record she does have
4751000	4753000	a gorgeous voice.
4763000	4765000	I remember
4765000	4767000	I got
4767000	4769000	I remember I got dragged
4769000	4771000	to this to an Amy Grant concert
4771000	4773000	at the
4773000	4775000	state fair. I got dragged
4775000	4777000	to one of those and it was just
4777000	4779000	not fun.
4779000	4781000	Did you sing along? No I didn't.
4781000	4783000	I'm not a fan of Amy Grant.
4783000	4785000	I like I recognize that song but I don't know any
4785000	4787000	of her other songs. Hey you know what
4787000	4789000	you know the only show that I
4789000	4791000	the only concert I've been taken to at a fair
4791000	4793000	against my will was Michael
4793000	4795000	Damien. I think literally that is the
4795000	4797000	only concert I have seen at the
4797000	4799000	state fair is the Amy Grant one.
4799000	4801000	And I don't remember who opened it. It was another
4801000	4803000	Christian artist. You haven't been to see where
4803000	4805000	now. No I said you haven't been to
4805000	4807000	see where now this year
4807000	4809000	I see where now it's a
4809000	4811000	hundred and some degrees outside. I don't
4811000	4813000	go outside for anybody. He can come to my house
4813000	4815000	Jamie
4815000	4817000	Jamie. I mean I went to
4817000	4819000	Fresno to see where now.
4819000	4821000	So all right.
4821000	4823000	Moving on back. Oh we were a video game show.
4823000	4825000	I didn't realize
4825000	4827000	one thing you could pick up and you could sing baby
4827000	4829000	baby while you're downloading it in the queue is the
4829000	4831000	Humble Indie Bundle 8. That's right
4831000	4833000	the Humble Indie Bundle 8 is here and
4833000	4835000	it has games such as Thomas was
4835000	4837000	Alone, Awesomenauts, Little Inferno
4837000	4839000	Dear Esther and Capsized
4839000	4841000	and if you pay more than the average purchase
4841000	4843000	price. I don't know what it is right at this moment. It's probably
4843000	4845000	like six or seven bucks. You will
4845000	4847000	also get Hotline Miami and
4847000	4849000	Proteus. Now I'm just going to guess
4849000	4851000	Did you say Proteus? No
4851000	4853000	Proteus. Damn.
4853000	4855000	Not like I don't already have five copies
4855000	4857000	of Proteus. Now here's the thing. If this
4857000	4859000	goes anything like the former bundles did
4859000	4861000	somewhere in the last week they're going to say
4861000	4863000	by the way we're throwing in these Humble Bundle 7
4863000	4865000	games as well. So look out for it.
4865000	4867000	I'm actually going to pay for this for one game.
4867000	4869000	What game? Hotline Miami. Yeah
4869000	4871000	I hear it's really fun. Because it's blood
4871000	4873000	everywhere and you can shoot like Dobermans
4873000	4875000	in the face. I'm going to get this just because
4875000	4877000	I like indie games and I've pretty
4877000	4879000	much gotten every other indie bundle. I already got it.
4879000	4881000	Did you? Have you checked out any
4881000	4883000	of the games yet? No. They'll just sit there
4883000	4885000	in my Steam library. I have
4885000	4887000	now in my Steam library 126
4887000	4889000	games. And that's not all of them
4889000	4891000	because I haven't bothered to put all of the
4891000	4893000	Sonic the Hedgehog games in.
4893000	4895000	I only because I bought the Sonic collection with
4895000	4897000	every single Sonic the Hedgehog game that's on PC.
4897000	4899000	And I only put in Sonic and
4899000	4901000	Sega All-Stars Racing and Sonic Generations.
4901000	4903000	I didn't bother to put the rest of the ones. Okay. Sonic
4903000	4905000	Generations is a damn good game. They also
4905000	4907000	have well you saw I don't know if you saw they have a mod
4907000	4909000	that actually it's Sonic
4909000	4911000	it converts it to
4911000	4913000	the other Sonic 3D game
4913000	4915000	that they had. I don't remember.
4915000	4917000	I see Tiger Claw in the chat room saying
4917000	4919000	Hotline Miami has a good soundtrack
4919000	4921000	and the good news is you will also be
4921000	4923000	able to get the soundtracks with these games.
4923000	4925000	DRM free downloads, Steam keys,
4925000	4927000	Windows, Mac and Linux versions.
4927000	4929000	For the record. For the record.
4929000	4931000	Whatever games that I don't
4931000	4933000	keep out of this I'm more than happy to share with
4933000	4935000	some of our listeners. And
4935000	4937000	and and
4937000	4939000	I should mention that they also
4939000	4941000	have a Humble Weekly Bundle
4941000	4943000	that's going on right now that's all the Telltale
4943000	4945000	series. Oh yeah I saw that too. Which I also
4945000	4947000	bought. That's a great deal.
4947000	4949000	Walking Dead, Sam & Max
4949000	4951000	Walking Dead alone is worth it
4951000	4953000	if you don't already have it. Yeah if you pay more than average
4953000	4955000	it's Walking Dead. You get Sam & Max
4955000	4957000	Also great. You know Back to the
4957000	4959000	Future. Great.
4959000	4961000	Puzzle Agent which I've never played
4961000	4963000	Waltzing Gromit.
4963000	4965000	Poker Night the Inventory
4965000	4967000	and
4967000	4969000	Jurassic Park?
4969000	4971000	No Jurassic Park.
4971000	4973000	Probably because of licensing.
4973000	4975000	Anyhow, apparently
4975000	4977000	earlier this week Eve Online and Dust
4977000	4979000	514 which is the game that ties into it
4979000	4981000	they were taken down. CCP actually
4981000	4983000	took them down due to a significant and
4983000	4985000	sustained DDoS attack.
4985000	4987000	That's a Distributed Denial of Service attack.
4987000	4989000	That was according to Eve Online's
4989000	4991000	Facebook. Don't know who
4991000	4993000	tried to do it or why but
4993000	4995000	yeah the whole game went down so look
4995000	4997000	at stupid kids ruining everybody's
4997000	4999000	fun. Stop DDoSing
4999000	5001000	MMOs and kicking everybody
5001000	5003000	off. This is trying to have a good time. By the way
5003000	5005000	speaking of DDoS attacks, Bobby asked me to
5005000	5007000	relay the following along.
5007000	5009000	Should we lose the stream at some point
5009000	5011000	during the show tonight? Don't hit F5
5011000	5013000	to refresh the entire page because when you all
5013000	5015000	do it at once it's like a little mini DDoS
5015000	5017000	attack because we're not on the servers
5017000	5019000	as big as Eve Online or Dust 514.
5019000	5021000	We're running off a tin can
5021000	5023000	that has some computer chips
5023000	5025000	in it because that's what we paid for you know because
5025000	5027000	we don't have a lot of money at VoG. So when you all
5027000	5029000	refresh it at once it's like a little DDoS attack
5029000	5031000	that could cause everything to break further. So please
5031000	5033000	all you have to do, it's right by
5033000	5035000	the little player, you just hit pause,
5035000	5037000	unpause, pause, unpause.
5037000	5039000	There you go. And that will not
5039000	5041000	do a DDoS attack on our little
5041000	5043000	website.
5043000	5045000	If you are a
5045000	5047000	Vita owner you'll be excited to know that
5047000	5049000	Flower is coming to the Vita.
5049000	5051000	This is awesome. I love Flower.
5051000	5053000	I played it on the Playstation 3 but I would
5053000	5055000	say it's the best racing game
5055000	5057000	I've played in a long time even though
5057000	5059000	you would not think of Flower as a racing
5059000	5061000	game. It's really great.
5061000	5063000	Flower is going to be on the Vita. It will be one
5063000	5065000	of the Indiecade games coming
5065000	5067000	to E3.
5067000	5069000	It was one of the few games that used that tilt
5069000	5071000	control inside the Dualshot controller.
5071000	5073000	It will obviously use that
5073000	5075000	on the Vita because it has a touch screen
5075000	5077000	and all that fun stuff.
5077000	5079000	Cool. Check that out
5079000	5081000	on the Vita.
5081000	5083000	Next up, Dark Sakura.
5083000	5085000	Hold on, I'm saying that I only care about R-Type.
5085000	5087000	What, in the
5087000	5089000	chat room? Talking about Irem games.
5089000	5091000	Oh, okay, I'm sorry. Because R-Type is freaking
5091000	5093000	great. Okay, tell me that R-Type
5093000	5095000	does not have the best first stage music
5095000	5097000	of almost any game ever.
5097000	5099000	If you said it doesn't then you're lying.
5099000	5101000	So,
5101000	5103000	you don't know Jack
5103000	5105000	is going to be on Ouya
5105000	5107000	on June 11th and
5107000	5109000	the Jackpad app
5109000	5111000	will make your phone a controller.
5111000	5113000	So, folks who have
5113000	5115000	Ouya's and an
5115000	5117000	Android phone or an
5117000	5119000	iOS will get to have a
5119000	5121000	controller out of their phone.
5121000	5123000	Yay.
5123000	5125000	Aren't you special.
5125000	5127000	Square Enix registered
5127000	5129000	Final Fantasy Agito.
5129000	5131000	Which is something that we heard at E3
5131000	5133000	what, five years ago? Six years ago?
5133000	5135000	Eventually.
5135000	5137000	Because they were supposed to do
5137000	5139000	Final Fantasy Agito 13.
5139000	5141000	So, now they've got
5141000	5143000	Final Fantasy Agito.
5143000	5145000	Hooray. There you go. Perfect question for Bobby
5145000	5147000	Blackwell. So, where's versus 13?
5149000	5151000	Oh, a question for the screen.
5151000	5153000	Well, here's the thing
5153000	5155000	is that either that's going to be
5155000	5157000	answered once E3 starts.
5157000	5159000	I kind of think it's a game that has to
5159000	5161000	show up in one way or another. Whether it's true
5161000	5163000	that they moved it to 15 or what.
5163000	5165000	I kind of think you'll have something on that well
5165000	5167000	before the show starts. But, let's say
5167000	5169000	they do announce Final Fantasy
5169000	5171000	versus 13 and you want to know
5171000	5173000	is lightning in it? You know, or something
5173000	5175000	that they don't say. I don't know. You could go
5175000	5177000	ask that question. Well, remember the
5177000	5179000	Agito 13 turned into
5179000	5181000	the zero one.
5181000	5183000	I do. I'm happy it's
5183000	5185000	hopefully. Which I wish we would have gotten a
5185000	5187000	release over here because everyone tells me it's
5187000	5189000	sick as anything. Well, maybe this is
5189000	5191000	a sign. I hope.
5191000	5193000	And then last but never least
5193000	5195000	for fans of the game Tookitori 2
5195000	5197000	which is on Wii U
5197000	5199000	it's getting a Steam release date. It's going to be
5199000	5201000	out today.
5201000	5203000	Already. July 2nd.
5203000	5205000	As announced by
5205000	5207000	developer Two Tribes.
5207000	5209000	And in the PC version is a Steam
5209000	5211000	workshop integration and achievements.
5211000	5213000	So, there's also
5213000	5215000	a level editor that was
5215000	5217000	promised for Wii U and
5217000	5219000	well, they don't have that yet.
5219000	5221000	Wii! Nintendo and online?
5221000	5223000	It's coming soon, trademark
5223000	5225000	patent pending. You know what else
5225000	5227000	is coming soon? Hey, you know what though
5227000	5229000	at this point? If the Xbox
5229000	5231000	One connect is going to watch me poop
5231000	5233000	then like give me the Wii U
5233000	5235000	and it's outdated technology
5235000	5237000	alright?
5237000	5239000	You know what? I'm just
5239000	5241000	going to go home and hook up the turbo duo
5241000	5243000	and play me some freaking Dracula X
5243000	5245000	and not worry about my system
5245000	5247000	watching me in my pajamas.
5247000	5249000	The end.
5249000	5251000	Instead of ceiling cat
5251000	5253000	is watching you masturbate. It'll be Xbox One
5253000	5255000	Bill Gates is watching you masturbate.
5255000	5257000	Alright, let's go to the FUGO question
5257000	5259000	of the week. Which thank heavens
5259000	5261000	tonight is not about masturbation.
5261000	5263000	Where's my theme music?
5263000	5265000	Everything is broken tonight. I ate it.
5265000	5267000	Who ate my theme music?
5267000	5269000	The uh
5269000	5271000	connected while it was watching you poop.
5271000	5273000	No, seriously guys
5273000	5275000	I don't have my theme music. Help me feel time.
5275000	5277000	Doo doo doo doo doo
5277000	5279000	No, not by singing.
5279000	5281000	You don't want to hear me sing anyway.
5281000	5283000	I want that game
5283000	5285000	Ikuma. Tell, tell, go
5285000	5287000	to Square Enix and tell them to give it to me.
5287000	5289000	Tell them to give me the
5289000	5291000	zero. I wants it.
5291000	5293000	Can't you just import it?
5293000	5295000	So what exactly is the downside for
5295000	5297000	I don't think I can read it.
5297000	5299000	Not voting on Steam Greenlight
5299000	5301000	titles. I never understood that. Like
5301000	5303000	You don't get your little mini
5303000	5305000	achievement. Well it's like if you
5305000	5307000	don't vote for them then
5307000	5309000	you know, so what? So you
5309000	5311000	thumbs up them and then you don't buy it.
5311000	5313000	They're not holding you to the fire to like
5313000	5315000	oh well you said you'd purchase this game
5315000	5317000	why aren't you purchasing this game?
5317000	5319000	And I actually want to wonder if
5319000	5321000	the chat room actually missed what I said that
5321000	5323000	Agito 13 was zero.
5323000	5325000	Because that's what I said right? Yeah, yeah.
5325000	5327000	Okay. Making sure people are paying attention.
5327000	5329000	Alright. Anyhow I would love to
5329000	5331000	answer Loki's question but
5331000	5333000	I found music.
5337000	5339000	Take Facebook and Google
5339000	5341000	and smash them together you get FUGL.
5341000	5343000	And our way to interact with our fan communities
5343000	5345000	every week with the FUGL question of
5345000	5347000	the week. Now we didn't talk about
5347000	5349000	this story earlier in the show so I'll mention it now.
5349000	5351000	A little known side quest in
5351000	5353000	Final Fantasy 9 came to light via
5353000	5355000	an uploaded YouTube. Apparently some guide
5355000	5357000	in Japan that had been out for years but was
5357000	5359000	always untranslated. Somebody found
5359000	5361000	it and found that there was this extra quest in the game.
5361000	5363000	Well anyhow, although
5363000	5365000	I'm not going to get into all the details on Final Fantasy 9
5365000	5367000	because it sounds complicated.
5367000	5369000	This had us thinking about rediscovering things
5369000	5371000	in classic games. Have you ever
5371000	5373000	revisited an old game years after
5373000	5375000	its release to find something new?
5375000	5377000	Go back and complete it at 100%?
5377000	5379000	What classic game did you revisit after
5379000	5381000	many years? Not necessarily to play it
5381000	5383000	for the first time but to try and discover
5383000	5385000	new things inside it.
5385000	5387000	So let's check out what some of our
5387000	5389000	folks on Facebook thought.
5389000	5391000	We'll start with Jeremy Jay who answered
5391000	5393000	I discovered a trick in Super Metroid
5393000	5395000	five or six years after playing
5395000	5397000	it for the first time. You can call
5397000	5399000	the Dragon boss with your
5399000	5401000	grappling beam.
5401000	5403000	Pretty neat stuff. I guess it's common knowledge
5403000	5405000	to many but I had no idea.
5405000	5407000	And he linked us a little to YouTube. You know there's
5407000	5409000	a lot of ways you can kind of trick that
5409000	5411000	game. You can do like wall jumps and
5411000	5413000	get past places you're not supposed to. There's lots
5413000	5415000	of little ways you can kind of like trick it and beat
5415000	5417000	the system so that's one of the really cool
5417000	5419000	that's what makes part of what makes
5419000	5421000	Super Metroid the best
5421000	5423000	ever. No that's
5423000	5425000	where you could get to the top of the castle by
5425000	5427000	doing the double jump and get your final star
5427000	5429000	in Super Mario 64
5429000	5431000	just saying. Alright
5431000	5433000	anyway Tiara responds
5433000	5435000	and says I've actually been
5435000	5437000	replaying Final Fantasy 9 for the past several
5437000	5439000	weeks and I never knew about this side quest until
5439000	5441000	I stumbled upon the info while
5441000	5443000	looking for Chocobo hot and cold treasure
5443000	5445000	locations. So you're
5445000	5447000	going to be one of the first to see it.
5447000	5449000	DarkTetsuya says up until a couple
5449000	5451000	sorry for the Facebook noise but I'm actually on
5451000	5453000	Facebook trying to read these answers.
5453000	5455000	DarkTetsuya says up until a couple years ago
5455000	5457000	I'd never beaten the fabled second quest
5457000	5459000	in The Legend of Zelda on NES. Trust
5459000	5461000	me when I say it is harder than the first
5461000	5463000	quest. Really? That is true.
5463000	5465000	Well a lot of people go back
5465000	5467000	and beat retro games. Well
5467000	5469000	and for the record for anyone who wants to do
5469000	5471000	it without beating
5471000	5473000	the game first just type in Zelda for your name.
5473000	5475000	That is true. Also Zelda is another one of those
5475000	5477000	games where you don't have to have every item. You
5477000	5479000	can get around some of this stuff. Like you could
5479000	5481000	get through the whole game with a wooden sword I think.
5481000	5483000	Don't forget to walk head first into
5483000	5485000	walls because you never know which one is invisible.
5485000	5487000	You never know. Alright
5487000	5489000	let's see.
5489000	5491000	Andy R. replied and said I replayed Okami
5491000	5493000	earlier this year thanks to the HD-ification
5493000	5495000	version and I found a lot of things
5495000	5497000	I didn't find the first time. Things such as
5497000	5499000	the hidden spider bosses or some of the advanced
5499000	5501000	forms of the brush techniques. Also
5501000	5503000	knowing what happens in the story before I
5503000	5505000	started made me more cognizant of the foreshadowing
5505000	5507000	I missed the first time I played the game
5507000	5509000	which was kind of cool.
5509000	5511000	Mary B. replied
5511000	5513000	with another Final Fantasy answer. Final Fantasy 8
5513000	5515000	learned how to crazy attack with
5515000	5517000	Squall's 2 hour or whatever it was
5517000	5519000	and that it was stronger than his summit. Did they
5519000	5521000	have 2 hour abilities in Final Fantasy 8 or was that
5521000	5523000	your Final Fantasy 11 addiction talking
5523000	5525000	after getting stuck on Bahamut.
5525000	5527000	I had to come back to a save down at Bahamut
5527000	5529000	after not playing for months. Final Fantasy
5529000	5531000	X and X-2 just for fun because I liked
5531000	5533000	them so much. Use strategy guide to get 100%
5533000	5535000	though.
5535000	5537000	Ragenator said well at least prior to my PS3
5537000	5539000	being stolen I regularly went back and played
5539000	5541000	older classics. The closest thing to
5541000	5543000	discovering something new was in terms
5543000	5545000	of tactics for situations where I got stuck
5545000	5547000	in the past. And Degenerate Johnny
5547000	5549000	says a couple years ago I decided to hook up my
5549000	5551000	Genesis to test and see if it still worked after
5551000	5553000	all this time. It did surprisingly.
5553000	5555000	I did
5555000	5557000	excuse me. I decided to fulfill
5557000	5559000	my nostalgic urge to play the original Mortal
5559000	5561000	Kombat. Unfortunately I forgot
5561000	5563000	the blood code. There are some things you
5563000	5565000	just forget as a gamer. I couldn't tell you
5565000	5567000	that I could remember it. Game facts.
5567000	5569000	I knew fatalities not sure
5569000	5571000	all were possible without the blood code
5571000	5573000	so I tried it out with Kano.
5573000	5575000	To my surprise Kano managed to do his finishing move.
5575000	5577000	However instead of a heart he pulled
5577000	5579000	out an organ that was dark colored. I
5579000	5581000	can only assume that he pulled out his opponent's
5581000	5583000	liver.
5583000	5585000	It's an evil thing. It must be destroyed. Even with
5585000	5587000	no blood code Mortal Kombat surprised me
5587000	5589000	with the amount of gore it was still able to show
5589000	5591000	on the consoles.
5591000	5593000	Alright going over to Google Plus
5593000	5595000	and some of the answers
5595000	5597000	there.
5597000	5599000	Are there no answers on Google Plus? Oh no there's
5599000	5601000	two. Sorry. Google Plus changed
5601000	5603000	and now I can't find things. Alright. Redertainment
5603000	5605000	says I remember me and my best friend as a
5605000	5607000	kid trying and failing to beat Mega Man
5607000	5609000	2 on the NES. No matter how many
5609000	5611000	different times or many different ways we tried to beat
5611000	5613000	the game we could never get past one particular
5613000	5615000	part in Dr. Wily's fortress at the end.
5615000	5617000	It wasn't until I was older
5617000	5619000	bought the Mega Man collection on PS2
5619000	5621000	and had access to online walkthroughs that I
5621000	5623000	finally got the item you needed in order
5623000	5625000	to proceed past that one particular part.
5625000	5627000	When I finally beat that game it felt like
5627000	5629000	I was giving my 8 year old self a figurative
5629000	5631000	high five. Not a literal high five
5631000	5633000	because that would break the space time continuum.
5633000	5635000	And lastly Travis H
5635000	5637000	on Google Plus says I have found myself
5637000	5639000	overjoyed with the amount of PS1 and PSP
5639000	5641000	games I can replay on my Vita.
5641000	5643000	I'm right now in the middle of playing Wild Arms
5643000	5645000	trying to complete it to its fullest
5645000	5647000	and find things that I missed the first time
5647000	5649000	around. It is very refreshing to go back
5649000	5651000	at an older age and enjoy the simple things
5651000	5653000	as the dialogue and some humor
5653000	5655000	you may not have got when you were younger.
5655000	5657000	Talk about a good soundtrack by the way.
5659000	5661000	Will anything
5661000	5663000	work during tonight's show?
5663000	5665000	Now Alan is breaking things in the kitchen.
5665000	5667000	I thought it was because I mentioned Wild Arms because that game
5667000	5669000	is hot.
5669000	5671000	Oh my gosh. Alright. There you go.
5671000	5673000	Thank you to the folks that
5673000	5675000	answered the Facebook question of the week and the Google Plus
5675000	5677000	question of the week. Answer
5677000	5679000	in a future week. I want to say quickly though
5679000	5681000	about that last answer was very similar to one of the
5681000	5683000	Facebook answers and a couple things we were hearing
5683000	5685000	is that these HD remakes
5685000	5687000	really seem to get people to go back and play them
5687000	5689000	again. And I kind of find that to
5689000	5691000	be true too. Is that when the things get
5691000	5693000	re-released it's like a reason for me to go back.
5693000	5695000	Like it's why I had never tried
5695000	5697000	to beat Mario 2 with just one character before.
5697000	5699000	So that was something I kind of did that was new this week.
5699000	5701000	Try doing it with Toad.
5701000	5703000	The desert levels would be
5703000	5705000	manageable. I actually only used
5705000	5707000	Toad in the desert levels for the most part but I did
5707000	5709000	now this was keep in mind when I was a
5709000	5711000	kid I did a full playthrough with Toad.
5711000	5713000	And you would be surprised
5713000	5715000	at the number of coins you get.
5715000	5717000	I was playing the stupid bonus game for ages.
5717000	5719000	Because he had
5719000	5721000	a faster dig.
5721000	5723000	SSG100 Matt to the rescue in the chat room.
5723000	5725000	A, B, A, C, A, B, B.
5725000	5727000	That was the blood code.
5727000	5729000	There you go Degenerajani. A, B, A, C, A, B, B.
5729000	5731000	Abacab.
5731000	5733000	Alright.
5733000	5735000	That does it.
5735000	5737000	Let's go into some more news.
5737000	5739000	And then of course the mailbag and the FUs of the week.
5739000	5741000	Loki!
5741000	5743000	Alright, so hey guess what?
5743000	5745000	Even though they haven't released their first
5745000	5747000	game yet, the next
5747000	5749000	Kickstarter for Double Fine
5749000	5751000	has been launched.
5751000	5753000	It's a brand new game called
5753000	5755000	Massive Chalice and it's
5755000	5757000	kind of a cross between like
5757000	5759000	a feudal fantasy
5759000	5761000	tactical strategy game
5761000	5763000	with like this weird
5763000	5765000	I guess
5765000	5767000	they're saying there's like permanent death in the game
5767000	5769000	so you have to create new
5769000	5771000	characters by breeding them I guess.
5771000	5773000	So um
5773000	5775000	yeah.
5775000	5777000	That's going to be coming I guess.
5777000	5779000	And it looks interesting.
5779000	5781000	They're most likely going to hit their goals since
5781000	5783000	they're at 677,500
5783000	5785000	right now and
5785000	5787000	their goal is 725,000
5787000	5789000	and they've got 24 days to go.
5789000	5791000	So most likely they are going to
5791000	5793000	make it.
5793000	5795000	So yeah.
5795000	5797000	I don't know.
5797000	5799000	Looks interesting.
5799000	5801000	It's being headed up I guess by the guy that did
5801000	5803000	Iron Brigade.
5803000	5805000	Bradner.
5805000	5807000	Speaking of Kickstarter stuff by the way
5807000	5809000	the Zelda Kickstarter we had
5809000	5811000	that guy on the show a couple weeks ago didn't make it.
5811000	5813000	Didn't make it. Bummer.
5813000	5815000	He says he has some other plans though
5815000	5817000	and good luck to him with Plan B.
5817000	5819000	I think you got to have a Plan B when you go
5819000	5821000	into this Kickstarter thing because I think
5821000	5823000	it's like going
5823000	5825000	viral you know.
5825000	5827000	And like these ad agencies will
5827000	5829000	hire people saying we need you to make a viral
5829000	5831000	ad but sometimes it just
5831000	5833000	either it's going to catch or it's
5833000	5835000	not and it's not that it's necessarily bad
5835000	5837000	it just sometimes it happens and sometimes
5837000	5839000	it doesn't. Now when you're double fine
5839000	5841000	and you have that name recognition well this
5841000	5843000	you know the money is going to come to him pretty easy
5843000	5845000	but you know unfortunately
5845000	5847000	for the Zelda movie
5847000	5849000	and all that it just didn't catch on
5849000	5851000	for whatever reason and that's going to happen sometimes
5851000	5853000	so good luck
5853000	5855000	to him with whatever he decides
5855000	5857000	to do with his Plan B.
5857000	5859000	That makes me quite sad.
5859000	5861000	Yeah it's unfortunate. Very unfortunate. I had put in some money
5861000	5863000	but I got it back
5863000	5865000	or I should say they never charged it because that's what happens
5865000	5867000	they don't charge it until it goes through.
5867000	5869000	Alright.
5869000	5871000	Going to some news for the 3DS
5871000	5873000	the 3D Sonic that I
5873000	5875000	remember we talked about was rumored
5875000	5877000	a couple weeks ago. Apparently it is something
5877000	5879000	that's happening because the Australian Classification
5879000	5881000	Board issued ratings.
5881000	5883000	You got to love when the ratings board spoils games.
5883000	5885000	Well not only did they roll out a
5885000	5887000	3D Sonic the Hedgehog rating but they
5887000	5889000	also rolled out a 3D Altered
5889000	5891000	Beast rating.
5891000	5893000	Apparently 3D Space Harrier
5893000	5895000	3D Super Hang-On
5895000	5897000	these are all out in Japan already
5897000	5899000	but the fact that they're rated in Australia means
5899000	5901000	they're probably coming around to the rest of the world too.
5901000	5903000	Which by the way if I am right
5903000	5905000	and they're the same as the Sega Ages
5905000	5907000	what was it
5907000	5909000	I imported like 3 of them. I had the Fantasy
5909000	5911000	Star, the Fantasy
5911000	5913000	Zone and Space Harrier. They're really good.
5913000	5915000	If it's in the same line.
5915000	5917000	Well these will be 3D.
5917000	5919000	I'm all about Space Harrier
5919000	5921000	3D Super Hang-On yeah Sonic yeah Altered Beast
5921000	5923000	look Altered Beast is one of those games
5923000	5925000	that everybody
5925000	5927000	remembers that and like in people's memories
5927000	5929000	it's awesome but like I played through the game
5929000	5931000	not that long ago. It sucks.
5931000	5933000	Like Altered Beast sucks. I'm sorry
5933000	5935000	to say it. It is not aged well
5935000	5937000	whatsoever. When I was 12
5937000	5939000	that game was the shit. When I'm 34
5939000	5941000	not so much. We needed a Marble
5941000	5943000	Madness. We do need a Marble Madness.
5943000	5945000	That wasn't Sega. I don't care though.
5945000	5947000	It would be awesome. Wasn't it Williams
5947000	5949000	or Midway?
5949000	5951000	It was Atari. Yeah Atari.
5951000	5953000	Which their arcade division got
5953000	5955000	snapped up by Midway I believe. I think that's what
5955000	5957000	I'm thinking of. Which in turn
5957000	5959000	got snapped up by Warner.
5959000	5961000	The game's great if you've got a track ball to play it with.
5961000	5963000	Well I could
5963000	5965000	do something with the touch pad
5965000	5967000	who knows. Alright
5967000	5969000	Dark Sakura what do you have for us?
5969000	5971000	Well as soon as I can get it up. There we go.
5971000	5973000	Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams
5973000	5975000	developer. We like them don't
5975000	5977000	we because they gave us that wonderful
5977000	5979000	series back didn't they?
5979000	5981000	It's Black Forest Games. They've announced
5981000	5983000	another game called Ravensdale
5983000	5985000	that's a four player co-op
5985000	5987000	side scrolling platform shooter
5987000	5989000	set in a medieval oil rig city.
5989000	5991000	Looking
5991000	5993000	at the screen capture here it's
5993000	5995000	pretty grimy. Very
5995000	5997000	oily looking.
5997000	5999000	They wanted it to be an
5999000	6001000	action RPG
6001000	6003000	but publishers were saying that Steampunk
6003000	6005000	doesn't sell so that's why
6005000	6007000	they are
6007000	6009000	it looks like they've changed
6009000	6011000	the method of this. I don't know has anyone else
6011000	6013000	heard anything about this?
6013000	6015000	No not this particular
6015000	6017000	game. No.
6017000	6019000	Well their likelihood saying that we're
6019000	6021000	going to see a kickstarter in
6021000	6023000	about a month or two. Since they're
6023000	6025000	not finding a publisher they're going to go
6025000	6027000	the Giana Sisters route. But I mean
6027000	6029000	if judging by Giana Sisters it's probably
6029000	6031000	going to be good. So
6031000	6033000	they got a good track record.
6033000	6035000	Yes yes I still need to play that
6035000	6037000	Twisted Dreams. It's one of those games that's like in my queue
6037000	6039000	waiting to play but I loved the
6039000	6041000	Commodore 64 one even though yes it was
6041000	6043000	kind of the Mario Brothers rip off but
6043000	6045000	soundtrack is part of what I remember most
6045000	6047000	fondly but. It's pretty good. I
6047000	6049000	have it downloaded but I played
6049000	6051000	it like once and then I
6051000	6053000	went back to Saints Row the Third.
6053000	6055000	I did not like Saints Row the Third.
6055000	6057000	What's wrong with you?
6057000	6059000	I just
6059000	6061000	didn't like how the game started off.
6061000	6063000	It's so funny. I laughed and
6063000	6065000	laughed. Did you get to the part where they're skydiving out of the plane?
6065000	6067000	You got to at least get that far
6067000	6069000	because I died. It was so funny.
6069000	6071000	I just found I didn't like the
6071000	6073000	control that's all.
6073000	6075000	Alright I didn't like Mass Effect the first time I
6075000	6077000	played it just saying. Alright
6077000	6079000	Loki what do you have for us?
6079000	6081000	So there's some more announcements coming from
6081000	6083000	Japan for the Wii U.
6083000	6085000	First off the Wii U is now going to be
6085000	6087000	available in white for the 32 gigabyte
6087000	6089000	premium set. That's starting
6089000	6091000	July 13th and
6091000	6093000	I guess it will be available in black and white
6093000	6095000	since they already have the black to begin with.
6095000	6097000	And then of course they're going to be
6099000	6101000	I guess
6101000	6103000	doing some sort of
6103000	6105000	and I'm surprised it's taken so god damn
6105000	6107000	long for this but they're doing
6107000	6109000	well first they have a larger
6109000	6111000	capacity battery for the
6111000	6113000	Wii U gamepad so it's going to
6113000	6115000	be 2500 maw
6115000	6117000	instead of 1500 maw
6117000	6119000	which will I guess equal to
6119000	6121000	5-8 hours of
6121000	6123000	you know gameplay as opposed
6123000	6125000	to 3-5 and then on top of that
6125000	6127000	they're having official
6127000	6129000	Wii remote
6129000	6131000	charge
6131000	6133000	battery packs for it.
6133000	6135000	Like woah
6135000	6137000	how many years after the Wii
6137000	6139000	and they finally got around to
6139000	6141000	putting out battery packs for it because
6141000	6143000	hey those Wii remotes
6143000	6145000	eat batteries like you know
6145000	6147000	I thought this was a Wii U battery pack.
6147000	6149000	No they have a Wii U battery pack and they also
6149000	6151000	have battery packs for the Wii.
6151000	6153000	I didn't realize that was a separate thing. It's crazy.
6153000	6155000	They're doing that and they even have like a little
6155000	6157000	charger that goes along with it. Now
6157000	6159000	it's a little late to the game considering
6159000	6161000	that Nyko and you know I think
6161000	6163000	Dream Gear have had battery packs for the
6163000	6165000	longest time for
6165000	6167000	it but it's interesting to see
6167000	6169000	something official from them
6169000	6171000	and yeah
6171000	6173000	so those will be coming soon
6173000	6175000	because they're only in Japan right now.
6175000	6177000	Until they announce something at E3
6177000	6179000	this week where these are coming
6179000	6181000	with a price drop.
6181000	6183000	Maybe, maybe, I don't know
6183000	6185000	might be thinking
6185000	6187000	too positively.
6187000	6189000	We'll see.
6189000	6191000	This game looks very cool.
6191000	6193000	I'm going to play some of the YouTube here in the
6193000	6195000	background so you can hear some of the music
6195000	6197000	but it's a game called
6197000	6199000	Crypt of the Necrodancer.
6199000	6201000	It is a roguelike
6201000	6203000	game which is you know like a
6203000	6205000	dungeon crawler like if you think way, way, way back
6205000	6207000	to the old terminal
6207000	6209000	game Rogue but it's mixed with a
6209000	6211000	music game.
6211000	6213000	It's a hardcore rhythm based
6213000	6215000	roguelike.
6215000	6217000	Notable game composers Danny B
6217000	6219000	and Alec Holowaka
6219000	6221000	or excuse me Holowka are
6221000	6223000	working with Crypt of the Necrodancer
6223000	6225000	which I think is awesome and you can also load
6225000	6227000	your own MP3s into the game if you want although
6227000	6229000	I don't know how well that will work but there you go.
6229000	6231000	That looks
6231000	6233000	awesome and you can check that out at
6233000	6235000	Necrodancer.com
6235000	6237000	Very cool.
6237000	6239000	I like both those types of games
6239000	6241000	that's like a game made for Rob.
6241000	6243000	Dungeon Crawler meets DDR
6243000	6245000	love it.
6245000	6247000	I just need my dance pad. Alright
6247000	6249000	let's get to our mailbag
6249000	6251000	every week you guys send us emails
6251000	6253000	and Dark Soccer reads some of her favorites here on
6253000	6255000	the show. In fact she's got a couple
6255000	6257000	weeks to catch up on with no
6257000	6259000	official show last week and so forth
6259000	6261000	so uh
6261000	6263000	unfortunately she was trying to sell. No one of my
6263000	6265000	stitches came out it actually broke when
6265000	6267000	I flipped the foot inside out so
6267000	6269000	I was trying to fix it real quick. I thought I had time
6269000	6271000	before mailbag. Oh well.
6271000	6273000	So a freaking ton of mail
6273000	6275000	and a lot of it's
6275000	6277000	in Mandarin Chinese so let's
6277000	6279000	skip all those. That was the spam.
6279000	6281000	That was the spam. Except for the stuff
6281000	6283000	in French which I could actually read but I don't really
6283000	6285000	care about beeps that much. Spam-der-in.
6285000	6287000	Womp womp.
6287000	6289000	So this
6289000	6291000	comes from Ra-ba-ba-ba-ba.
6291000	6293000	I noticed
6293000	6295000	the Curiosity game from 22Cans
6295000	6297000	is approaching the center. Well there's
6297000	6299000	a countdown on each cube and I believe it was
6299000	6301000	at 13 when I wrote this on Monday. I made
6301000	6303000	my final cynical conclusions about it. Of course
6303000	6305000	we've already done a big reveal. But I like
6305000	6307000	reading this stuff.
6307000	6309000	It appears the cubes do not get smaller
6309000	6311000	as you get closer to the center. It isn't
6311000	6313000	fun not even as bubble wrap. It gets boring
6313000	6315000	easily and after I toyed with it once or twice
6315000	6317000	I'm content to just see it end.
6317000	6319000	The payoff at the end will be disappointing.
6319000	6321000	The life changing promise is way too
6321000	6323000	large a nebulous. I love the word nebulous
6323000	6325000	by the way. I hope the center is
6325000	6327000	remember to drink your Ovaltine.
6327000	6329000	Stay pound zero zero zero zero
6329000	6331000	zero zero Ra-ba-ba. Of course
6331000	6333000	you know what that is.
6333000	6335000	Stay black.
6337000	6339000	You've been listening. Okay.
6339000	6341000	No you haven't. We have another one from Ra-ba-ba-ba.
6341000	6343000	You guys asked for
6343000	6345000	our reaction to the Xbox One so here's mine.
6345000	6347000	First when listening to the May 19th episode
6347000	6349000	I read up on the Xbox One so the podcast
6349000	6351000	was full of unintentional dramatic irony.
6351000	6353000	It was fun to hear
6353000	6355000	after the reveal. That said my original
6355000	6357000	reaction on the name is that it
6357000	6359000	was literally the last name I'd consider for the new
6359000	6361000	Xbox. Then I realized simply
6361000	6363000	Xbox was literally the last name
6363000	6365000	I expected so they chose the pen's
6365000	6367000	ultimate name of all I could come up
6367000	6369000	with. Overall the name is
6369000	6371000	pretty good as it conveys multiple
6371000	6373000	meanings, is easy to remember and understandable
6373000	6375000	unlike Wii and Wii U which sound dumb even
6375000	6377000	repulsive. The conveyed no
6377000	6379000	obvious meaning
6379000	6381000	I don't expect a lot of debate
6381000	6383000	over what a terrible name one is.
6383000	6385000	Does it have good games?
6385000	6387000	At this point I don't really care.
6387000	6389000	All I know is that there aren't many
6389000	6391000	good games coming out for any system at the moment.
6391000	6393000	They'll stop making games for
6393000	6395000	PS4 and Xbox
6395000	6397000	360 very soon and the new
6397000	6399000	consoles will be my only choice for new
6399000	6401000	games on console. Used games
6401000	6403000	if I can't trade or give used
6403000	6405000	games away I will probably not buy discs at all.
6405000	6407000	I also believe this is how
6407000	6409000	EA will implement Game Pass.
6409000	6411000	The game DVR is interesting.
6411000	6413000	It requires online to share so I suspect
6413000	6415000	this will be an exclusive gold
6415000	6417000	feature. I also
6417000	6419000	expect that certain games will not be allowed on this
6419000	6421000	feature, even gasp not allow
6421000	6423000	certain parts to be recorded. That's all
6423000	6425000	I'll bug you with today.
6425000	6427000	This
6427000	6429000	comes from Elliot B.
6429000	6431000	It's the
6431000	6433000	Oculus Rift report.
6433000	6435000	Dear OLR, this week I was
6435000	6437000	lucky enough to get some hands on time with the most exciting
6437000	6439000	hardware release of the year.
6439000	6441000	No, not the PS4 or Xbox One. I'm of course talking
6441000	6443000	about the Oculus Rift.
6443000	6445000	For those who don't know, the Rift is a VR headset with
6445000	6447000	low latency head tracking providing an
6447000	6449000	immersive 3D experience, in theory at least.
6449000	6451000	While the reality doesn't
6451000	6453000	quite yet live up to the hype, it's still an
6453000	6455000	impressive device, even for a prototype.
6455000	6457000	Oculus have got the basics
6457000	6459000	down pat.
6459000	6461000	The headset is easy to set up, weighs nothing
6461000	6463000	and lag is unnoticeable.
6463000	6465000	Unfortunately there is still a pretty major issue
6465000	6467000	standing between the Rift and the mainstream
6467000	6469000	success. Movement with standard
6469000	6471000	FPS controls produce instant
6471000	6473000	motion sickness. Even the peaceful
6473000	6475000	Italian Villa demo is
6475000	6477000	nauseating, let alone a fast paced shooter.
6477000	6479000	DarkSucker, you have been warned. Thank you.
6479000	6481000	My thinking is that
6481000	6483000	rather than adapting existing games for the
6483000	6485000	Rift, devs will need to keep in mind its weaknesses
6485000	6487000	as well as strengths.
6487000	6489000	Still experiencing the Rift for the first
6489000	6491000	time is a breathtaking experience, even
6491000	6493000	despite its teething problems.
6493000	6495000	To be any more than a novelty,
6495000	6497000	it now needs some equally breathtaking
6497000	6499000	custom built games. Yours virtually,
6499000	6501000	Elliot B.
6501000	6503000	Thank you Elliot. Good lord everybody, why are you
6503000	6505000	writing me novels?
6505000	6507000	Dear OLR, I would like to take this moment
6507000	6509000	to thank Microsoft from the bottom of my heart
6509000	6511000	for the Xbox One announcement. The amount of money
6511000	6513000	I'll be saving by skipping their draconian
6513000	6515000	unattractive Kinect mandatory disaster
6515000	6517000	is enormous. You know
6517000	6519000	it's funny I was worried about skipping this generation
6519000	6521000	because I was afraid the PS4 was going to blow
6521000	6523000	major chunks. How I even bought
6523000	6525000	a Wii U out of that fear.
6525000	6527000	Instead it seems Microsoft is going
6527000	6529000	into the junior year slump that seems
6529000	6531000	to happen with any successful console
6531000	6533000	manufacturer. Seriously,
6533000	6535000	first it was Nintendo with the
6535000	6537000	64, then Sony with the PS3.
6537000	6539000	Now Microsoft with the Xbox One, by the way
6539000	6541000	lamest name ever. We're getting
6541000	6543000	quite a bit of
6543000	6545000	mixed
6545000	6547000	The PS3 though, it
6547000	6549000	started off like a great comedy
6549000	6551000	of errors, but after a couple years it got
6551000	6553000	better and better. It grew into itself. It did.
6553000	6555000	It fits its big boy pants.
6555000	6557000	Nintendo 64 had its moments.
6557000	6559000	You know, I wouldn't call Nintendo 64
6559000	6561000	a flop. Pokemon Snap.
6561000	6563000	Among
6563000	6565000	well, Mario 64, some in
6565000	6567000	Ocarina of Time, some considered to be the greatest games
6567000	6569000	ever made, so it had that too.
6569000	6571000	Well, and
6571000	6573000	even Treasure did a couple of games
6573000	6575000	for it, and we know what we think of Treasure.
6575000	6577000	Okay.
6577000	6579000	This isn't to say
6579000	6581000	I'll be completely sitting out on gaming
6581000	6583000	hardware this generation. Obviously I have
6583000	6585000	my Wii U, and actually already
6585000	6587000	have a bunch of games for it, and I'll be picking up the
6587000	6589000	Retron 5 and Ouya when they're commercially available.
6589000	6591000	Also, since Sony doesn't appear
6591000	6593000	to be restricting news games or mandating
6593000	6595000	internet connections, the PS4 seems to be
6595000	6597000	a viable option, unless something
6597000	6599000	disastrous turns up at E3.
6599000	6601000	Honestly, if Sony isn't looking
6601000	6603000	at the Xbox One and saying, this is
6603000	6605000	what we don't do, I'll be surprised.
6605000	6607000	However, I can say with absolute certainty
6607000	6609000	that I've got more than
6609000	6611000	enough ga- you know, that was the first typo I found.
6611000	6613000	You said then
6613000	6615000	and so then?
6615000	6617000	No, I was just thinking I was impressed, so
6617000	6619000	good on you.
6619000	6621000	More than enough gaming ready to go
6621000	6623000	for the next five or so years, and that
6623000	6625000	doesn't include GOG or humble
6625000	6627000	bundles. However,
6627000	6629000	almost as troubling as the DRM encumbrance
6629000	6631000	on the Xbox One is
6631000	6633000	Microsoft's continued commitment
6633000	6635000	of trying to pimp the Xbox to people
6635000	6637000	who don't give a crap about video games.
6637000	6639000	Does Microsoft not understand
6639000	6641000	that there are cheaper alternatives for those who want
6641000	6643000	set-top boxes? Seriously,
6643000	6645000	media centers like Boxee and Apple TV
6645000	6647000	are $80 to $100,
6647000	6649000	and modern Blu-ray players are having
6649000	6651000	more and more of those features put into them
6651000	6653000	for about the same price or less.
6653000	6655000	That's ignoring the obvious
6655000	6657000	plug a cheap PC into your television
6657000	6659000	through HDMI option. I
6659000	6661000	shit you guys not, I can do the whole
6661000	6663000	Netflix, YouTube, multimedia thing on my
6663000	6665000	Blu-ray player, my PS3, my Nexus
6665000	6667000	7 tablet, and my PC, and
6667000	6669000	most of those options are also on my Wii U.
6669000	6671000	Microsoft goes full bore with the
6671000	6673000	living room takeover thing at
6673000	6675000	their own peril while I hesitate to wish
6675000	6677000	them ill. I do hope they're awakened soon.
6677000	6679000	Failing that, however,
6679000	6681000	I'm good to go. Emulators on Ouya,
6681000	6683000	retro goodness on the RetroN5,
6683000	6685000	and modern gaming on the Wii U, and potentially
6685000	6687000	a future on the PS4, and Japanese
6687000	6689000	developers will likely be able to go right
6689000	6691000	back to ignoring Microsoft, and all is right with the world.
6691000	6693000	Anyway, there's my thoughts
6693000	6695000	on the Xbox One. Have I mentioned it's a stupid
6695000	6697000	name? I have. Don't care.
6697000	6699000	It's a stupid name. Seriously, it's worse than
6699000	6701000	Wii. Regards, we're all still UT.
6701000	6703000	Thank you for the best written email
6703000	6705000	I have ever read in my entire life
6705000	6707000	except for your one type O.
6707000	6709000	It's T-H-A-N,
6709000	6711000	not T-H-E-N, and also... That is
6711000	6713000	totally a lie. Well written. Shut up, Rob.
6713000	6715000	No offense. Mr. KickStarter'd.
6715000	6717000	No offense to the emailer.
6717000	6719000	No. Well, you know it's my job to
6719000	6721000	completely fuck up everyone's grammar.
6721000	6723000	I think maybe it's a little bit overly
6723000	6725000	cynical, but I
6725000	6727000	will give until E3. Let's
6727000	6729000	see what happens.
6729000	6731000	So, you know, and just like
6731000	6733000	Bobby said in the chatroom at live.vognetwork.com,
6733000	6735000	Sony never
6735000	6737000	said they weren't doing any of that.
6737000	6739000	They just never answered the question.
6739000	6741000	True dat. So,
6741000	6743000	we'll see. They're not gonna
6743000	6745000	be able to dodge it much longer. One foot.
6745000	6747000	I have one scalemate foot.
6747000	6749000	In your behind.
6749000	6751000	Kick. In your angel butt.
6751000	6753000	Okay, this comes from
6753000	6755000	Jay, who I was hanging out with, and just
6755000	6757000	let me hop back into the chat long enough to keep from getting
6757000	6759000	logged out. Sure. Okay.
6759000	6761000	This email
6761000	6763000	comes from Jay, Jammer Jay,
6763000	6765000	who I was hanging out with on
6765000	6767000	last Monday. Oh, is it gossip all about your
6767000	6769000	experiences? No, it's not. It's pictures of
6769000	6771000	me being sunburned.
6771000	6773000	This is
6773000	6775000	the highlight of my gaming week was
6775000	6777000	playing DDR with the legendary DarkSakura.
6777000	6779000	Yes, I know. Anyway.
6779000	6781000	She did a fine job for getting back into
6781000	6783000	DDR. I think it's time for Sky and Loki to brush
6783000	6785000	off the rest and join her back into DDR.
6785000	6787000	I played
6787000	6789000	at Roseville Golf Land a couple months ago.
6789000	6791000	I think when Spike and Tim
6791000	6793000	that showed that Spike and Tim were here. We've gone to
6793000	6795000	Golf Land earlier in the week. I have a pile of tokens
6795000	6797000	which they don't even use anymore.
6797000	6799000	It's all like a card. Maybe you could
6799000	6801000	trade them in. I don't know. I mean, I don't think
6801000	6803000	they'll do that. Well, they had to
6803000	6805000	for a certain time. Okay.
6805000	6807000	My summer advice for gamers. Be sure to have
6807000	6809000	light sunscreen if planning to be out in the sun
6809000	6811000	a bit. Oh, why? Yeah,
6811000	6813000	because
6813000	6815000	the thing is I'm not supposed to wear sunblock at all
6815000	6817000	because I have a
6817000	6819000	I don't make enough
6819000	6821000	vitamin D normally so I didn't wear any.
6821000	6823000	And then I forgot what humidity
6823000	6825000	and sunlight really does and I'm
6825000	6827000	still peeling.
6827000	6829000	Anyways, it was nice seeing you again, DarkSakura.
6829000	6831000	Thank you. It was good to see you too.
6831000	6833000	And I look forward to meeting up with Sky and Loki for
6833000	6835000	California DDR one day. Well, we would love to
6835000	6837000	have you out here and you are more than welcome
6837000	6839000	to crash at my place.
6839000	6841000	And
6841000	6843000	last email.
6843000	6845000	Hello all. Just thought I
6845000	6847000	would drop a line to say hello to the gang.
6847000	6849000	I am in the middle of reading an amazing
6849000	6851000	book called Ready Player One, which we've discussed
6851000	6853000	on the show by Ernest Cline.
6853000	6855000	I know I'm a little late to the party
6855000	6857000	since the book has been out about two years now
6857000	6859000	but it's so good.
6859000	6861000	So much gaming culture and influence as well
6861000	6863000	as a lot of great pop culture
6863000	6865000	references from the 80s and 90s.
6865000	6867000	I have two questions. To anyone who has read it
6867000	6869000	what did you think? No spoilers.
6869000	6871000	Which I think we've discussed in depth.
6871000	6873000	I haven't read it yet. I'm going to be borrowing it from Becky I think.
6873000	6875000	Okay, good. I still haven't read it.
6875000	6877000	I still need to read Catching
6877000	6879000	Fire y'all before the movie's
6879000	6881000	out. So I got a long
6881000	6883000	book queue. You don't need to watch them
6883000	6885000	or watch the book, read
6885000	6887000	the book to watch the movie. Yeah, but
6887000	6889000	like when I, see reading the book makes
6889000	6891000	the movie better because when I went to see
6891000	6893000	The Hunger Games, like every time they
6893000	6895000	change something from the book it was like
6895000	6897000	and then Alan would know that that was
6897000	6899000	something that changed in the book because he could hear me huffing.
6899000	6901000	So
6901000	6903000	the fact that you got pissed off that they
6903000	6905000	changed things in the book made it better? Yes, it made
6905000	6907000	it a more interactive experience.
6907000	6909000	Who won The Hunger Games? I did.
6909000	6911000	You know what?
6911000	6913000	It's kind of funny doing that with Battle Royale
6913000	6915000	now that I've read the book.
6915000	6917000	And seeing how the movie is just complete
6917000	6919000	blood fest and not really political.
6919000	6921000	It's very different. The manga is great though.
6921000	6923000	So anyway,
6923000	6925000	I'm only
6925000	6927000	halfway through and my second question
6927000	6929000	is to Loki. When you were doing that
6929000	6931000	challenge a while back, this was the book
6931000	6933000	you were doing it for, wasn't it?
6933000	6935000	Yes. Anyone who
6935000	6937000	hasn't read the book, stop what you were doing
6937000	6939000	after the OLR show of course and go pick it
6939000	6941000	up on Kindle or your local bookstore.
6941000	6943000	You will not be disappointed. Keep up
6943000	6945000	the great work you three make my Monday at
6945000	6947000	office a lot less miserable. Your friend
6947000	6949000	Travis. Ah, you make our Sunday mail bag
6949000	6951000	a lot less miserable. It's our Travis H. You make our Sunday
6951000	6953000	mail bag a lot less miserable. Thank you
6953000	6955000	Travis. Thank you.
6955000	6957000	And you know there's pictures that
6957000	6959000	Jay sent but I think they're the same
6959000	6961000	ones that he put up on Facebook.
6961000	6963000	And they're not wanting to look.
6963000	6965000	Yeah, my butt playing DDR.
6965000	6967000	Your butt on a DDR machine.
6967000	6969000	LOL. See.
6969000	6971000	I'm not showing any of you in the chat room
6971000	6973000	because no.
6973000	6975000	Alright, well as long as you have fun. That's what DDR is about.
6975000	6977000	Because I'm the diva, that's why.
6977000	6979000	Speaking of diva moments
6979000	6981000	it's time to get into that segment we do here
6981000	6983000	every week on the show where we get a little bit angry.
6985000	6987000	All this is bad.
6987000	6989000	Here is justice.
6989000	6991000	Here is punishment.
6991000	6993000	Here.
6993000	6995000	This is fucked up.
6995000	6997000	F you
6997000	6999000	to
6999000	7001000	smoking in
7001000	7003000	your house.
7003000	7005000	And making
7005000	7007000	all of my clothes
7007000	7009000	smell like smoke.
7009000	7011000	And then on top of
7011000	7013000	okay this is me going into some family
7013000	7015000	shit. Okay.
7015000	7017000	My mom smokes in the house.
7017000	7019000	Her husband smokes in the house.
7019000	7021000	While my grandmother has vasculitis.
7021000	7023000	And I was reading about
7023000	7025000	just how badly second hand smoke
7025000	7027000	can aggravate vasculitis.
7027000	7029000	Can aggravate a lot.
7029000	7031000	Exactly. And then my mom's like
7031000	7033000	my mom has asthma and she's saying that my shampoo
7033000	7035000	is aggravating her asthma. No it was not.
7035000	7037000	Your smoking is aggravating your damn asthma.
7037000	7039000	When I smoked
7039000	7041000	I would always go, which was a long time ago
7041000	7043000	but I would always go outside.
7043000	7045000	Most smokers I knew would do that.
7045000	7047000	Especially in this state.
7047000	7049000	Like it's illegal to smoke anywhere that's not outside.
7049000	7051000	And most outdoor places are also banned
7051000	7053000	at this point in time.
7053000	7055000	They actually banned it in Daphne. I had the most
7055000	7057000	pleasant experience in a waffle house
7057000	7059000	that I've ever had in my life.
7059000	7061000	Because you couldn't smoke inside.
7061000	7063000	You could actually smell your food. It was amazing.
7063000	7065000	Also I love you Daphne
7065000	7067000	Waffle House. Your peanut butter
7067000	7069000	waffles are so freaking
7069000	7071000	good. And even though you're kind of
7071000	7073000	racist assholes. Blue Bell Ice Cream.
7073000	7075000	I love your ice cream too.
7075000	7077000	Thank you for the banana pudding ice cream.
7077000	7079000	And also FU2
7079000	7081000	Attention Horse. Three hour show
7081000	7083000	Jamie. Three hour show. I'm done. Alright.
7083000	7085000	Loki. Fuck you to hot.
7085000	7087000	Right? Because it's gonna get
7087000	7089000	hot. Alright. It was like
7089000	7091000	95 today or something
7091000	7093000	and next week it's 105. Fuck that.
7093000	7095000	Nope. I like the winter.
7095000	7097000	Winter. It's cold. You put more layers on.
7097000	7099000	You can only take off so many layers
7099000	7101000	in the summer. It's gonna rain.
7101000	7103000	No. It's gonna be hot.
7103000	7105000	Alright. That's it?
7105000	7107000	My FU of the Week just goes to the whole
7107000	7109000	like when it rains it pours syndrome.
7109000	7111000	I have a lot of good things going on right now.
7111000	7113000	I can't really complain. Like there's nothing I'm doing
7113000	7115000	where I'm like argh I'm so angry about this.
7115000	7117000	But it's just like. Did Robbie
7117000	7119000	bite off more than he could chew? I don't know.
7119000	7121000	But it's actually one of those things where I'm like
7121000	7123000	ok. When I have some
7123000	7125000	days off next week. I have some time to
7125000	7127000	catch up on some things. Then I can
7127000	7129000	go have fun in LA.
7129000	7131000	Even though I'll have to be driving down there by myself.
7131000	7133000	But one of my friends is gonna be meeting me there
7133000	7135000	and that makes everything a lot better. And then I'm meeting
7135000	7137000	another one of my friends there. It makes it a lot better so.
7137000	7139000	But just lots of stuff going
7139000	7141000	on right now. So when it rains
7141000	7143000	it pours. Argh.
7143000	7145000	But it'll be good. It's like
7145000	7147000	one of those things. You're like really
7147000	7149000	upset about it. But then like when it's actually happening
7149000	7151000	you're like I have the best life.
7151000	7153000	Ok.
7153000	7155000	Let's get to a couple more news stories for you guys.
7155000	7157000	And then Twitter topics at
7157000	7159000	twitter.com slash olr and the skype line
7159000	7161000	at 1877 game olr
7161000	7163000	or our username on skype orange lounge radio.
7163000	7165000	Not just yet though. Couple more stories.
7165000	7167000	Yes unfortunately we got some depressing stories.
7167000	7169000	The first being that
7169000	7171000	unfortunately there was a tragic event that happened
7171000	7173000	this week. One of the
7173000	7175000	engineers for the oculus
7175000	7177000	oculus rift
7177000	7179000	Andrew Scott Reese was
7179000	7181000	killed in a
7181000	7183000	basically
7183000	7185000	a hit and run during a
7185000	7187000	police chase. He was
7187000	7189000	crossing the street in a crosswalk and got hit
7189000	7191000	by a car that the police were chasing.
7191000	7193000	And killed.
7195000	7197000	That's awful. That sucks. Especially
7197000	7199000	after we just had an email. Yeah after that email
7199000	7201000	and everything. It's crazy. I mean what's really
7201000	7203000	horrible about that is just like you know dude was crossing
7203000	7205000	the street. And
7205000	7207000	Didn't it happen to
7207000	7209000	Gumpay. Fuck I can't remember his name.
7209000	7211000	He did Metroid. I think he
7211000	7213000	died in a car accident.
7213000	7215000	I thought he was getting out of a car and got hit.
7215000	7217000	Yeah yeah yeah that sounds familiar.
7217000	7219000	It's on Wikipedia somewhere.
7219000	7221000	But yeah it was really sad.
7221000	7223000	And it's just you know obviously people
7223000	7225000	car accidents happen every day and we lose
7225000	7227000	great people. And pedestrians get hit every day
7227000	7229000	unfortunately and we lose great people.
7229000	7231000	It just really sucks that
7231000	7233000	A this was such a great you know young mind
7233000	7235000	that was inventing these things that everybody wanted
7235000	7237000	to play. And B
7237000	7239000	preventable. This guy
7239000	7241000	this guy was not at fault. He wasn't
7241000	7243000	like he wasn't crossing the street in a drug induced
7243000	7245000	stupor or something. You know
7245000	7247000	he was hit by a guy who was running from the
7247000	7249000	police. Totally preventable.
7249000	7251000	Like it's awful.
7251000	7253000	It's awful.
7253000	7255000	But what can
7255000	7257000	you do. When it's
7257000	7259000	time to go. You're gonna go.
7259000	7261000	You know.
7261000	7263000	But at the same time
7263000	7265000	it's important not
7265000	7267000	to. Well
7267000	7269000	yeah you can't live in here.
7269000	7271000	I'm just saying
7271000	7273000	it's important to remember the basics
7273000	7275000	that you learned in elementary school.
7275000	7277000	You got to look both ways before you cross the street.
7277000	7279000	And because I'm sorry but
7279000	7281000	you know and not to say that he's at fault
7281000	7283000	because it's tragic but
7283000	7285000	if there's a police chase going
7285000	7287000	and there's cars with sirens coming
7287000	7289000	your way you can hear those sirens and
7289000	7291000	you know you
7291000	7293000	always want to look especially when I'm driving
7293000	7295000	and stuff even though there's a green light I'm always
7295000	7297000	looking you know you always I give it a couple
7297000	7299000	seconds before I go because there's always
7299000	7301000	someone that's not paying attention that's going to run the light.
7301000	7303000	So you got to be defensive and always kind of
7303000	7305000	keep your eye out even though it may be green or something.
7305000	7307000	I remember actually it was funny the last time I
7307000	7309000	went to E3 even
7309000	7311000	a bus ran out of control
7311000	7313000	and smashed into a Walgreens
7313000	7315000	right through the crosswalk because
7315000	7317000	it turned too fast or something like that.
7317000	7319000	And you know
7319000	7321000	someone could have gotten hurt.
7321000	7323000	Thankfully there was someone that was in the way
7323000	7325000	but they managed to get into the
7325000	7327000	Walgreens before the bus
7327000	7329000	hit but you just have to be careful.
7329000	7331000	Alright so here's the deal
7331000	7333000	with Gunpei Yokoi and if you don't know
7333000	7335000	that name he's the guy who produced he worked for
7335000	7337000	Nintendo for a long time producer of
7337000	7339000	Kid Icarus and Metroid which is huge
7339000	7341000	right there designed Rob the robot
7341000	7343000	designed the Game Boy
7343000	7345000	so you all know that one. Yes he designed the Virtual
7345000	7347000	Boy 2 for which you know there was a lot
7347000	7349000	of shame that came with that and he left Nintendo
7349000	7351000	but they say that he had always
7351000	7353000	planned to leave Nintendo at a certain age
7353000	7355000	Virtual Boy was not the reason for that.
7355000	7357000	Well unfortunately in 1997
7357000	7359000	he was in a fender
7359000	7361000	bender accident where he rear
7361000	7363000	ended a truck he got out of the car
7363000	7365000	to inspect the damage because you know the same thing happens
7365000	7367000	here right you take the pictures send the insurance company all that
7367000	7369000	stuff right and the passing car said
7369000	7371000	Yeah I remembered
7371000	7373000	it was something like that. Similar-ish
7373000	7375000	yeah it's very tragic.
7375000	7377000	Yeah and Yokoi I
7377000	7379000	knew it was a Yoke but I didn't remember
7379000	7381000	Yeah
7381000	7383000	Alright well
7383000	7385000	I hope I really really hope
7385000	7387000	this story doesn't have a sad ending but
7387000	7389000	you know somebody in
7389000	7391000	the gaming community is missing right now
7391000	7393000	and his name I'm hoping
7393000	7395000	if the internet is doing its job correctly
7395000	7397000	then you all already know this and I'm telling you something
7397000	7399000	obvious but in case you don't know
7399000	7401000	David Dredger is currently missing
7401000	7403000	and he goes by Knuckles Dawson online
7403000	7405000	he went missing
7405000	7407000	over last weekend
7407000	7409000	so unfortunately it's been about a week now
7409000	7411000	and he was missing in the Vancouver area
7411000	7413000	his bike and helmet were
7413000	7415000	found in Stanley Park
7415000	7417000	but before he left he closed his Twitter account
7417000	7419000	his Xbox Live account
7419000	7421000	reportedly he left his wallet, computer
7421000	7423000	and phone at home
7423000	7425000	and there's really just
7425000	7427000	not a lot of information unfortunately
7427000	7429000	they have been assembling groups in Vancouver
7429000	7431000	to try and find him
7431000	7433000	unfortunately no luck yet
7433000	7435000	I think they were going to search the
7435000	7437000	waters area next
7437000	7439000	I mean don't know he could have
7439000	7441000	leave the country somehow
7441000	7443000	essentially and who knows
7443000	7445000	where he could have gone
7445000	7447000	hopefully he is safe and sound
7447000	7449000	somewhere
7449000	7451000	for whatever reason
7451000	7453000	just got away
7453000	7455000	but I highly doubt
7455000	7457000	he would be listening to this podcast
7457000	7459000	but if by some strange
7459000	7461000	string of luck he was
7461000	7463000	a lot of folks miss you dude
7463000	7465000	please
7465000	7467000	call your family
7467000	7469000	a lot of people are out looking for this guy
7469000	7471000	and they really miss him
7471000	7473000	so if you are in the Vancouver area
7473000	7475000	even I would say honestly
7475000	7477000	if you are in the Pacific Northwest
7477000	7479000	honestly he could be anywhere at this point
7479000	7481000	it's not that hard to get on a plane
7481000	7483000	go somewhere else
7483000	7485000	or get in a car and go somewhere
7485000	7487000	he could be in the US who knows
7487000	7489000	findknuckles.com is the place to go
7489000	7491000	findknuckles.com
7491000	7493000	this guy by the way you might have seen
7493000	7495000	his work in the gaming community before
7495000	7497000	he was pretty well known because he got
7497000	7499000	the one achievement a day on the 360
7499000	7501000	for like he did something like 3 years
7501000	7503000	so he was really big in the Xbox achievements community
7503000	7505000	and I know I heard his name before
7505000	7507000	he was working with other indie podcasts
7507000	7509000	I know he did stuff with Rooster Teeth
7509000	7511000	so
7511000	7513000	I hope they find him
7513000	7515000	and I hope all is well
7515000	7517000	ok that was two
7517000	7519000	really horrible stories back to back
7519000	7521000	I'm sorry we have to end on that note
7521000	7523000	but we want to do our due diligence
7523000	7525000	I could find some puppies and kittens
7525000	7527000	we need like a kitten playing video
7527000	7529000	play the baby monkey writing backwards on a pig
7529000	7531000	song

7549000	7551000	baby monkey
7551000	7553000	baby monkey

7577000	7579000	I've got to pull those up. Loki do we have any last minute news
7579000	7581000	while we're working on that?
7581000	7583000	there's a kickstarter for some sort of
7583000	7585000	vest
7585000	7587000	haptic device or something
7587000	7589000	that they're trying to get off the ground
7589000	7591000	it's supposed to be the as close as it gets
7591000	7593000	kickstarter and it's
7593000	7595000	like this thing that's supposed to tie in with first person shooters
7595000	7597000	and stuff like that to make it more immersive
7597000	7599000	where you actually feel like the
7599000	7601000	you know bullets are hitting you
7601000	7603000	and stuff it's weird though they had
7603000	7605000	that's a little creepy just saying
7605000	7607000	they had something like that before it had like a
7607000	7609000	bass speaker almost built
7609000	7611000	into it I want to say I forgot what they
7611000	7613000	called it but it was
7613000	7615000	I think it was tied into
7615000	7617000	either your audio
7617000	7619000	or maybe like the
7619000	7621000	rumble on your controller
7621000	7623000	or something like that for like the playstation 2 and
7623000	7625000	xbox it's probably audio
7625000	7627000	if it's going to be tying in with that stuff but
7627000	7629000	they had that
7629000	7631000	yeah they're looking to get $900,000
7631000	7633000	to create that thing
7633000	7635000	alright let's go to the phones we're getting some calls

7653000	7655000	I don't want to see you I want to see the cat
7655000	7657000	thank you much better
7657000	7659000	what's kitty's name
7659000	7661000	Anakin Rorschach
7661000	7663000	oh that's a good name alright
7663000	7665000	hopefully that will be better than the Anakin
7665000	7667000	that was in episodes 1 through 3 what's on your mind tonight
7667000	7669000	not a whole lot
7669000	7671000	just
7671000	7673000	kind of a generic
7673000	7675000	question for tonight
7675000	7677000	is there
7677000	7679000	any upcoming
7679000	7681000	games that have been announced
7681000	7683000	that you're possibly looking for
7683000	7685000	or forwards to
7685000	7687000	and not only that
7687000	7689000	but it's a secondary question
7689000	7691000	if you have
7691000	7693000	like a wish list
7693000	7695000	or something that you would love
7695000	7697000	to see on steam
7697000	7699000	like if it was
7699000	7701000	you see on steam right now
7701000	7703000	you want to throw down money
7703000	7705000	for that game and say buy it
7705000	7707000	like anything
7707000	7709000	or are you talking about ports from consoles
7709000	7711000	or something like that
7711000	7713000	either or whatever direction
7713000	7715000	you would like to take the question
7715000	7717000	well I would point you to the OLR dream
7717000	7719000	games page on the OLR wiki
7719000	7721000	because things like what they
7721000	7723000	play dot com snap those still have not
7723000	7725000	come to fruition and I think we'd like to see
7725000	7727000	some of those but on a serious
7727000	7729000	note things that are on console
7729000	7731000	that I would like to see on steam
7731000	7733000	I think it would be nice if maybe some things
7733000	7735000	that are already out on PC would get
7735000	7737000	integrated into steam a little more like
7737000	7739000	you know I loves me some World of Warcraft
7739000	7741000	might be kind of fun to integrate that and I could
7741000	7743000	talk you know but Blizzard wants to do their
7743000	7745000	own thing with battle net so I understand why that doesn't
7745000	7747000	happen so
7747000	7749000	but as far as like console things
7749000	7751000	on steam I could be a total
7751000	7753000	fanboy and say like Mario which
7753000	7755000	also wouldn't happen but then again
7755000	7757000	on the keyboard it wouldn't be the same experience
7757000	7759000	so I don't know I'd have to
7759000	7761000	think about that one you guys anything that jumps
7761000	7763000	to your mind we'll come back to your other question though anything
7763000	7765000	that jumps to your mind something that isn't on steam that ought
7765000	7767000	to be
7767000	7769000	yeah there's so many things
7769000	7771000	that I can come up with
7771000	7773000	too many to list and especially in this
7773000	7775000	show well let me check in with
7775000	7777000	Dark Soccer and Loki I want SNES collections
7777000	7779000	SNES collections like Genesis
7779000	7781000	collections exactly why not no
7781000	7783000	even better TurboGrafx
7783000	7785000	I want the revamped Dracula
7785000	7787000	X alien crush HD
7787000	7789000	oh my god right that would be our dev
7789000	7791000	no I want to see the whole crush series
7791000	7793000	like up through Jackie crush okay
7793000	7795000	all right Loki Minecraft
7795000	7797000	you just want Minecraft in
7797000	7799000	steam make sense it'd be cool I run my
7799000	7801000	Minecraft through steam I guess
7801000	7803000	you can be done all right
7803000	7805000	let's let's get to the meteor question that rage nator
7805000	7807000	asks what are you personally looking forward to
7807000	7809000	this year if anything let me guess
7809000	7811000	Loki Saints Row 4 Grand Theft Auto 5
7811000	7813000	oh and oh
7813000	7815000	yeah come on yes both
7815000	7817000	is that it
7817000	7819000	and Earth Defense Force 2025
7819000	7821000	okay and the new Call of Duty
7821000	7823000	um for me the
7823000	7825000	Kingdom Hearts 1.5 remix is something
7825000	7827000	I'm definitely looking forward to Final Fantasy 14
7827000	7829000	Realm Reborn so I know I'm sounding like a
7829000	7831000	total Square Enix fanboy but it is
7831000	7833000	what it is Disney Infinity
7833000	7835000	although I'm totally expecting that game
7835000	7837000	to be a flop that whole collectible
7837000	7839000	figurine thing I have to admit
7839000	7841000	I'm like if I'm gonna get into a Skylanders
7841000	7843000	game it's gonna be this one you know
7843000	7845000	I'm cautiously optimistic I actually do have to tell
7845000	7847000	you something Julian does not have
7847000	7849000	any Skylanders games but he has toys
7849000	7851000	that he plays with
7851000	7853000	there are people that collect Disney
7853000	7855000	commemorative plates they will
7855000	7857000	buy this game people will buy this game
7857000	7859000	it's not gonna it's not gonna
7859000	7861000	matter it's not gonna flop uh I'm
7861000	7863000	still holding hope that Phantasy Star Online 2
7863000	7865000	will make it out this year at some point although
7865000	7867000	I'm losing hope but we'll see E3 is kinda the
7867000	7869000	make or break for that um
7869000	7871000	I kinda wanna see the South Park
7871000	7873000	Stick of Truth game too
7873000	7875000	the toilet humor potty
7875000	7877000	humor guy in me wants to see that uh
7877000	7879000	Pokemon X and Y believe it or not I'm
7879000	7881000	loving what it looks like the revamp battle system
7881000	7883000	is gonna be or not system but the graphics
7883000	7885000	and everything and how they're making everything 3D
7885000	7887000	it looks it looks really cool I don't
7887000	7889000	usually get into the Pokemon games quite as much as
7889000	7891000	other people I know like Shane but
7891000	7893000	uh if there's gonna be one that's gonna win
7893000	7895000	me over it'll probably be X and Y
7895000	7897000	how about you Spazinator
7897000	7899000	what do you want this year what can't you wait for?
7899000	7901000	uh well stuff
7901000	7903000	that would probably run on my
7903000	7905000	uh uh KPS
7905000	7907000	computer probably
7907000	7909000	Magic 2014
7909000	7911000	of course
7911000	7913000	yeah well
7913000	7915000	that's probably one of the few upcoming
7915000	7917000	games that will run on my
7917000	7919000	computer for sure
7919000	7921000	some of the other stuff like
7921000	7923000	GTA 5 I know for games
7923000	7925000	sure it won't run on my computer
7925000	7927000	uh if I were to go replace
7927000	7929000	my consoles I may go get
7929000	7931000	that but
7931000	7933000	it's not really within my budget right now
7933000	7935000	but uh
7935000	7937000	the short answer is just the next
7937000	7939000	Magic the gallery so
7939000	7941000	fair enough you know what there's sometimes those reliable
7941000	7943000	series and we're always waiting for the next entry in them
7943000	7945000	some people only get Madden
7945000	7947000	every single year and if you know if
7947000	7949000	if the DDR game if we were like you know
7949000	7951000	10 years ago I would have said oh whatever new
7951000	7953000	DDR game is coming out this year that's what I'm looking forward to
7953000	7955000	but you know times have changed alright
7955000	7957000	uh Raginator I'm gonna let you go so we can get more calls
7957000	7959000	but take care buddy okay?

7982000	7984000	Tetris and he came out with a new

7986000	7988000	everybody's going IOS it's a
7988000	7990000	IOS game called Marbly

8030000	8032000	this for the listeners
8032000	8034000	this is Ospher hi Ospher how you doing
8034000	8036000	pretty good
8036000	8038000	you mentioned earlier about how you were really
8038000	8040000	getting into the Wii U Virtual Console
8040000	8042000	and earlier this week
8042000	8044000	I took advantage of that deal that
8044000	8046000	what is that like 32 cents
8046000	8048000	Super Metroid or whatever
8048000	8050000	if you live in a state that taxes those online
8050000	8052000	purchases yes 32 cents but
8052000	8054000	somehow in California we get away with
8054000	8056000	a measly 30 cents for Super Metroid
8056000	8058000	dang
8058000	8060000	holy crap I know I saved two
8060000	8062000	cents
8062000	8064000	I uh
8064000	8066000	I also went I got a
8066000	8068000	Mega Man X because
8068000	8070000	I don't know like a lot of people
8070000	8072000	seem to really be into the series I've never
8072000	8074000	played Mega Man X before but I've played like
8074000	8076000	you poor thing now's a
8076000	8078000	great time to catch up
8078000	8080000	yeah it seems pretty good
8080000	8082000	like I'm pretty bad at Mega Man
8082000	8084000	games in general too but like had a little fun
8084000	8086000	thing I like the dashing and stuff like that
8086000	8088000	well a lot of Mega Man games
8088000	8090000	are really freaking hard too
8090000	8092000	so it's you know you say I'm not that good
8092000	8094000	at Mega Man games nobody is
8094000	8096000	that good at Mega Man games but you learn
8096000	8098000	you learn you get better at them
8098000	8100000	yeah I was actually really mad earlier because I was
8100000	8102000	like fighting some mini boss
8102000	8104000	against I can't remember the robot
8104000	8106000	names like some electrical guy and
8106000	8108000	I couldn't even beat the freaking mini boss like I was
8108000	8110000	like getting so angry and then I
8110000	8112000	fight the actual boss I'm like wow that was the easiest thing
8112000	8114000	I've ever done
8114000	8116000	what did you think of Super Metroid?
8116000	8118000	um well I actually own it on
8118000	8120000	Super Nintendo so I've played it before
8120000	8122000	yeah yeah there you go
8122000	8124000	but you're very
8124000	8126000	you're very well thought out
8126000	8128000	and it being your favorite game ever because it is
8128000	8130000	pretty amazing
8130000	8132000	that is the right answer sir
8132000	8134000	I will side with you in your whole
8134000	8136000	Chrono Trigger debate that I think Super Metroid
8136000	8138000	is a far better game than Chrono Trigger
8138000	8140000	oh it's comparing
8140000	8142000	apples and oranges though I don't care how many
8142000	8144000	times you have five to cite tonight you get a gold
8144000	8146000	star for that comment
8146000	8148000	if you're comparing RPGs
8148000	8150000	Chrono Trigger is up at the top next to
8150000	8152000	Final Fantasy 6 but
8152000	8154000	action games
8154000	8156000	okay okay Jamie in the
8156000	8158000	RPG department I will say that I
8158000	8160000	like Chrono Cross better than Chrono Trigger
8160000	8162000	but if we're sticking to just SNES
8164000	8166000	just SNES?
8166000	8168000	Final Fantasy 6 vs Chrono Trigger
8168000	8170000	I think is the great SNES debate
8170000	8172000	okay well for me then that would be
8172000	8174000	Super Mario RPG
8174000	8176000	good answer actually good answer
8176000	8178000	fair answer fair answer
8178000	8180000	also you mentioned um this shirt
8180000	8182000	earlier yes you can tell because
8182000	8184000	it's like backwards but it's the Symphony of the
8184000	8186000	Goddesses shirt it's not backwards on our end
8186000	8188000	it's not backwards on our end I guess the camera flips
8188000	8190000	properly yeah that's weird yeah we see it
8190000	8192000	yeah on my
8192000	8194000	end it is backwards so I'm like
8194000	8196000	I don't know that's weird that's weird
8196000	8198000	but have you guys made it out to see Symphony
8198000	8200000	of the Goddesses yet? no but I want
8200000	8202000	to but you know what I said earlier about
8202000	8204000	a lot of stuff going on
8204000	8206000	yeah I think um
8206000	8208000	I was at Sunshine
8208000	8210000	I think you mentioned something about it coming back
8210000	8212000	to California soon I believe I
8212000	8214000	heard it's going to be in Oakland or somewhere
8214000	8216000	in the East Bay soon and
8216000	8218000	I honestly think it was
8218000	8220000	like early June it's probably

8276000	8278000	I'm just kidding I am not
8278000	8280000	I do not judge because I am
8280000	8282000	and we're not those kind of people
8282000	8284000	everybody's and until we totally are
8284000	8286000	everybody's beautiful in their own unique way
8286000	8288000	everybody's beautiful
8288000	8290000	was that was who was that that was
8290000	8292000	ray stevens wasn't it was it I think so
8292000	8294000	I don't know you know it's funny I told
8294000	8296000	when I was on the way back uh to
8296000	8298000	gulf port to get on the plane I
8298000	8300000	texted dan from pascagoula
8300000	8302000	so he asked if there were squirrels going berserk
8302000	8304000	cause that was another ray steven song
8304000	8306000	you guys are such
8306000	8308000	nerds so alright
8308000	8310000	let's go to another call
8310000	8312000	hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this
8312000	8314000	this is the legend of zaku here
8314000	8316000	three video calls in a row
8316000	8318000	look at that what's up zaku
8318000	8320000	uh nothing much just trying to
8320000	8322000	stay dry high and dry right now
8322000	8324000	with all this thunder outside
8324000	8326000	I heard it's raining out there on the east coast
8326000	8328000	oh cause that's probably all the unfortunate
8328000	8330000	tornado weather that was in the midwest probably making
8330000	8332000	its way over there right is that yeah I've already
8332000	8334000	heard a few rumbles ugh
8334000	8336000	which by the way I hope
8336000	8338000	everybody's I know code man lives
8338000	8340000	in oklahoma so I checked in with him earlier in the week
8340000	8342000	I don't know I don't know who else of our listenership
8342000	8344000	is in that area affected by the tornadoes but
8344000	8346000	I hope y'all are okay I hope your stuff's hooked
8346000	8348000	up to surge protectors too well code man
8348000	8350000	was on oh my god he's got a shirt I want
8350000	8352000	I freaking love
8352000	8354000	dream theater oh my god
8354000	8356000	dream theater's
8356000	8358000	freaking awesome
8358000	8360000	alright zaku I surely you
8360000	8362000	did not just call in tonight to get complimented by
8362000	8364000	dark soccer although I wouldn't blame you if you did
8364000	8366000	what's on your mind tonight
8366000	8368000	well I guess well
8368000	8370000	to put it bluntly
8370000	8372000	I think we're approaching
8372000	8374000	the next video game crash
8374000	8376000	now call me cynical
8376000	8378000	but if you look at the rumblings
8378000	8380000	of how microsoft
8380000	8382000	uh announced to the world
8382000	8384000	about the xbox one how
8384000	8386000	they're basically
8386000	8388000	you can't you're not getting a straight answer
8388000	8390000	from them regarding used games
8390000	8392000	it's contradicting each answer is contradicting
8392000	8394000	one another kind of like
8394000	8396000	the like heisenberg's
8396000	8398000	rule of uncertainty
8398000	8400000	it's uncertainty principle where if you study
8400000	8402000	something long enough
8402000	8404000	it's properties change
8404000	8406000	dynamically
8406000	8408000	so it keeps shifting around
8408000	8410000	so there's no in other words
8410000	8412000	you're still left with
8412000	8414000	so many unopened questions and
8414000	8416000	and it's getting to the
8416000	8418000	point where we don't own things
8418000	8420000	anymore it's kind of like the steam
8420000	8422000	model being pigeonholed
8422000	8424000	into the console
8424000	8426000	even though it's not
8426000	8428000	the appropriate medium
8428000	8430000	wait do you blame steam for
8430000	8432000	what xbox let's say worst
8432000	8434000	case scenario is true with xbox one
8434000	8436000	do you blame steam for that do you think
8436000	8438000	that everybody's looking at steam going
8438000	8440000	well they get away with digital downloads
8440000	8442000	well I mean it's expected
8442000	8444000	that a console which
8444000	8446000	for lack of a better
8446000	8448000	word it's just like you know
8448000	8450000	it's a dumb computer it only
8450000	8452000	does certain functions
8452000	8454000	yeah but you know what it does great is connect
8454000	8456000	to online games right Loki that's
8456000	8458000	one thing it does very well
8458000	8460000	yeah anyway sorry
8460000	8462000	well okay
8462000	8464000	but I mean it's like
8464000	8466000	it's expected that all the
8466000	8468000	media for a video named
8468000	8470000	console is physical
8470000	8472000	it's like it's tangible even
8472000	8474000	though they do exist
8474000	8476000	as game downloads
8476000	8478000	and that's already accepted
8478000	8480000	and you know as
8480000	8482000	a standard where you only own
8482000	8484000	the license to that particular
8484000	8486000	digital copy
8486000	8488000	but if you buy something tangible
8488000	8490000	wouldn't you expect that the first
8490000	8492000	sale doctrine would apply to it
8492000	8494000	but I'm thinking Microsoft
8494000	8496000	is thinking about a little
8496000	8498000	decision where the folks
8498000	8500000	from Autodesk
8500000	8502000	come in
8502000	8504000	Zaku stop talking
8504000	8506000	alright I gotta ask you this
8506000	8508000	because I wanna play devil's
8508000	8510000	advocate and this is important because you say that
8510000	8512000	you know we expect something tangible
8512000	8514000	I'm not gonna disagree with you I like
8514000	8516000	having the tangibleness I've been very
8516000	8518000	disappointed that manuals are going away
8518000	8520000	and instead we're eating these inserts
8520000	8522000	these inserts that say go to our website
8522000	8524000	like that really ticks me off
8524000	8526000	but hold on devil's advocate
8526000	8528000	is that at one point in this industry
8528000	8530000	it was cartridges, cartridges
8530000	8532000	cartridges, Atari 26 cartridges, NES
8532000	8534000	cartridges, Super NES cartridges and then all of a
8534000	8536000	sudden disc and there were some people
8536000	8538000	that would say cartridges for life
8538000	8540000	and Nintendo was one of those people and they paid
8540000	8542000	for it on the N64
8542000	8544000	yes that is true however even
8544000	8546000	with the disc era starting with playstation
8546000	8548000	you know and anything
8548000	8550000	slightly earlier than that
8550000	8552000	you're able to lend it out
8552000	8554000	to anybody, to your friends
8554000	8556000	now all of a sudden Microsoft wants
8556000	8558000	to impose like you know paying for that game
8558000	8560000	all over again I mean
8560000	8562000	when you buy something you're
8562000	8564000	presuming it's pretty
8564000	8566000	much common presumption that
8566000	8568000	you pretty much own
8568000	8570000	it you're able to do what you want
8570000	8572000	to lend it out but
8572000	8574000	in this case for the Xbox One
8574000	8576000	it's a much tighter grip
8576000	8578000	it's equity, it's equity on what
8578000	8580000	you value
8580000	8582000	like this huge wall of
8582000	8584000	DVDs I'll never watch they at least have
8584000	8586000	equity I could get 50 cents at
8586000	8588000	a dimple or something
8588000	8590000	which is a local chain that buys
8590000	8592000	these things
8592000	8594000	compared to those discs it's like a house
8594000	8596000	you buy a house and then you sell it
8596000	8598000	for hopefully more money later on it's like a car
8598000	8600000	you buy it and then hopefully you can sell it
8600000	8602000	later on and I know a lot of people are saying
8602000	8604000	a video game is different than a car but
8604000	8606000	until now our games
8606000	8608000	have had equity and now
8608000	8610000	we're saying we might lose that and that is
8610000	8612000	not good when you're asking me to pay
8612000	8614000	$60 for a game that will be
8614000	8616000	worth zero when I try to resell it
8616000	8618000	more importantly it's
8618000	8620000	collusion between not only the
8620000	8622000	game developers
8622000	8624000	the manufacturers
8624000	8626000	they're colluding with GameStop
8626000	8628000	to find a way
8628000	8630000	like maybe
8630000	8632000	well I mean from what I'm hearing
8632000	8634000	it's you have to
8634000	8636000	it's rumor
8636000	8638000	it's an exchange so to speak
8638000	8640000	it's almost similar to how the Yankees
8640000	8642000	basically opted out of
8642000	8644000	StubHub to create their own ticket exchange
8644000	8646000	because up until
8646000	8648000	last year me and my girl were able to get
8648000	8650000	like you know
8650000	8652000	home tickets for really good
8652000	8654000	seats at below face value
8654000	8656000	and I think this is what's happening
8656000	8658000	they're taking the same
8658000	8660000	approach where they want to cut out any other middle
8660000	8662000	man and basically set
8662000	8664000	their own terms and set their own
8664000	8666000	prices for certain games
8666000	8668000	holy crap I just saw lightning in the background
8668000	8670000	that was crazy did you guys see that?
8670000	8672000	like totally flashed in his window there
8672000	8674000	sorry
8674000	8676000	this is why we don't do a video show
8676000	8678000	I get too distracted there's something shiny
8678000	8680000	behind you there's something shiny
8680000	8682000	okay look Zaku I gotta wrap
8682000	8684000	this up for time but I do want to say this about the
8684000	8686000	video game crash I do feel like
8686000	8688000	sometimes as cynical gamers
8688000	8690000	we do sit here with every console generation
8690000	8692000	and go the game crash the game crash the game crash
8692000	8694000	I don't think the video game industry is going to
8694000	8696000	crash necessarily
8696000	8698000	but hold on
8698000	8700000	I feel there is a very real possibility
8700000	8702000	that both the PlayStation 4
8702000	8704000	and the Xbox One
8704000	8706000	and hell the Wii U as well there's a very
8706000	8708000	real possibility all three of them
8708000	8710000	fail and they could call that
8710000	8712000	a video game crash but you know who the winner
8712000	8714000	is in that situation the current generation
8714000	8716000	because people still have those
8716000	8718000	consoles
8718000	8720000	well yeah that too and then mobile which
8720000	8722000	never had those which those nations were
8722000	8724000	were never a
8724000	8726000	a mood point to begin with I mean
8726000	8728000	there were never an issue to begin
8728000	8730000	with I mean all digital
8730000	8732000	everything on mobile is pretty much
8732000	8734000	digital so it's
8734000	8736000	the same rules that apply to PC
8736000	8738000	and you
8738000	8740000	know if it turns out that
8740000	8742000	Sony is basically pulling the same tricks
8742000	8744000	as Microsoft and
8744000	8746000	God help them if they find
8746000	8748000	a way to spin it really well better than
8748000	8750000	what Microsoft was able to then
8750000	8752000	yeah there might be a crash
8752000	8754000	long overdue it might even happen
8754000	8756000	a lot sooner if they flop
8756000	8758000	at the end of the year or early next
8758000	8760000	yeah people will still clutch
8760000	8762000	to their existing 360s
8762000	8764000	and PS3s like myself
8764000	8766000	I hope it's not an all out
8766000	8768000	crash because I know a lot of people in the industry
8768000	8770000	that would be affected
8770000	8772000	as I said it might not
8772000	8774000	I may have exaggerated when saying
8774000	8776000	crash without like adding context and scope
8776000	8778000	it will be a crash
8778000	8780000	with like traditional consoles
8780000	8782000	mobile and any other casual
8782000	8784000	aspects of gaming will
8784000	8786000	be unscathed
8786000	8788000	because they appeal to a broader audience
8788000	8790000	alright
8790000	8792000	Zaku I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show
8792000	8794000	but thank you for your opinion take care
8794000	8796000	bye you too

8798000	8800000	I love when we get like really
8800000	8802000	in depth discussion like that though
8802000	8804000	yeah Zaku doesn't you know
8804000	8806000	love Zaku or hate him when he gets on his
8806000	8808000	train where he won't let me talk
8808000	8810000	but he's very passionate

8828000	8830000	our predictions and guess what guys
8830000	8832000	you know we gotta use this as an excuse
8832000	8834000	to bring back listless and the thing we
8834000	8836000	most want to happen want to see happen
8837000	8839000	so be thinking about it now
8839000	8841000	we'll be back one week from tonight to do
8841000	8843000	all that but in the meantime it's time to
8843000	8845000	end tonight's show
8845000	8847000	I just wanted to let you know that there was a mention of a
8847000	8849000	very old joke when I was hanging out with
8849000	8851000	Jammer Jay oh god
8851000	8853000	Pantsless Rage of course of course alright look
8853000	8855000	Loki any other last minute stories before
8855000	8857000	we wrap it up and say print
8857000	8859000	yeah Shadow Warrior you remember it's
8859000	8861000	being remade well the classic is available
8861000	8863000	free on Steam forever
8863000	8865000	so go play it and then finally
8866000	8868000	the Super Mario Brothers movie
8868000	8870000	has celebrated its 20th
8870000	8872000	anniversary
8872000	8874000	so that's it
8874000	8876000	alright
8876000	8878000	oh and one other thing
8878000	8880000	one other thing that Steam does better than
8880000	8882000	you know the Xbox One
8882000	8884000	the Alan Wake series on
8884000	8886000	the Xbox 360
8886000	8888000	right now is $20
8888000	8890000	$4 on Steam
8890000	8892000	that's why people don't mind DRM
8892000	8894000	you can get a series of games for
8894000	8896000	$4 or the Humble Bundle where you can get
8896000	8898000	the entire franchise
8898000	8900000	like 20 games
8900000	8902000	for 5 bucks

9004000	9006000	in for my airline because I want a good seat
9006000	9008000	Loki, your final thought tonight

9016000	9018000	no, not working well I guess
9018000	9020000	oh, that's still terrible
9020000	9022000	well if the little one gets too warm you and Nellie are welcome to bring him over
9022000	9024000	to my house, it's not gonna be that hot tonight
9024000	9026000	where Midna will nibble his toes
9026000	9028000	get that thing fixed before it gets really bad
9028000	9030000	be thankful you're not going to Phoenix
9030000	9032000	tomorrow then in that case
9032000	9034000	Dark Saga, your final thought tonight
9034000	9036000	I have done two feet
9036000	9038000	and am attaching the major parts of the body
9038000	9040000	of my scale mate
9040000	9042000	and when I am done with him
9042000	9044000	hopefully, because I never sleep so it might be tonight
9044000	9046000	I will post pictures up
9046000	9048000	are they happy feet?
9048000	9050000	they're kind of deflated
9050000	9052000	because they have no stuffing
9052000	9054000	but I could put them on my fingers
9054000	9056000	and pretend they're real feet
9056000	9058000	see, look, real feet
9058000	9060000	you need a little picture of that for
9060000	9062000	I am scale mate feet
