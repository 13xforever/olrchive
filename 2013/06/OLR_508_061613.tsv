7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	19000	Tonight, June 16th, 2013, we discuss the highlights and lowlights of E3 with our listeners.
19000	22000	One company sues another over Duke Nukem Forever.
22000	27000	And could a free-to-play game from Nintendo be in the works?
27000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	38000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
38000	44000	It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 508 for this June 16th, 2013.
44000	47000	My name is Rob Roberts, here with you every week with my co-hosts.
47000	50000	Say hello first off to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
50000	52000	Thank you for the coffee, it's delicious.
52000	54000	You're welcome. You caffeinated and ready to go?
54000	55000	Oh yes.
55000	57000	This week's show tonight, also say hello to Tech Master Loki.
57000	58000	Hi.
58000	59000	Sorry to hear about the Minecraft server.
59000	60000	Eh.
63000	64000	We'll get into that later.
64000	70000	It was a huge week this week and we're not going to fuck around, we're just going to get right into it tonight.
70000	76000	So, honestly, probably one of those huge historical moments in gaming this week.
76000	78000	Let's relive this moment real quick.
78000	91000	In addition to creating an amazing library of new titles on PlayStation 4, we're equally focused on delivering what gamers want most without imposing restrictions or devaluing their PS4 purchases.
91000	98000	For instance, PlayStation 4 won't impose any new restrictions on the use of PS4 gamers.
109000	111000	Let's see how long that applause goes on.
112000	113000	Yep.
114000	119000	That's not just the fanboys in the upper ring, that's the journalists too, who can't contain themselves.
120000	121000	Guess that's a good thing.
123000	124000	Oh, and...
124000	129000	We believe in the model that people embrace today with PlayStation 3 and continue to demand.
129000	131000	Just heard you there.
131000	135000	When a gamer buys a PS4 disc, they have the rights to use that copy of the game.
135000	142000	They can trade in the game at retail, sell it to another person, lend it to a friend, or keep it forever.
142000	143000	Bullet.
143000	144000	Bullet.
144000	145000	Bullet.
145000	146000	Bullet.
146000	147000	That was...
147000	148000	Wow.
155000	157000	Some guy standing and cheering in there.
157000	158000	Sit down, fanboy.
159000	165000	Well, and don't forget over at the Microsoft area where they're watching, this enormous sound of...
166000	168000	Which was a million pants moving.
168000	173000	In addition, PlayStation 4 disc-based games don't need to be connected online to play.
173000	176000	Or for any type of authentication.
176000	180000	If you enjoy playing single-player games offline, PS4 won't require you to check in online periodically.
204000	208000	And it won't stop working if you haven't authenticated within 24 hours.
209000	210000	Sick burn.
210000	211000	Bam.
211000	212000	In the jugular.
212000	218000	That was huge because that was a direct target response to Microsoft right there.
218000	226000	In the 11 years I've been looking at the modern E3, when I say modern E3, I mean like when we've been able to watch the streaming things and all this.
226000	228000	And the show is turning 11 next week.
228000	232000	And all the years I've been watching E3 that closely, I have never seen anything like that.
232000	236000	Where one company systematically takes down the policies of another.
236000	237000	Like, not since the...
237000	240000	I mean, I remember back in the Sega Nintendo days, things would get ugly.
240000	242000	You know, Genesis does, Nintendo don't.
242000	244000	And even the turbo graphics, you know.
244000	245000	Blast processing.
245000	246000	Does all this stuff.
246000	248000	I mean, like, you know, they used to be at each other's throats a lot more.
248000	254000	Not saying that in the modern era it's been civil, but everybody kind of stays off each other's toes.
254000	255000	This...
255000	257000	This was huge.
257000	258000	And then...
258000	261000	And then they're like, oh hey, you like this cake right here?
261000	264000	Well then I got some icing for you too.
264000	266000	That's right, we're only gonna be $3.99.
266000	270000	Dear Microsoft, these are your cornflakes. Watch as we piss in them.
270000	275000	So, like many of you out there, Dark Soccer and I were watching this together.
275000	280000	And honestly, during this part of the press conference, my jaw's on the floor because I did not expect...
280000	286000	Well, like many of you, and we even said it on the show last week, we expected Sony to go down a similar path.
286000	288000	Never in my life have I been happier to be wrong.
288000	293000	I think I go on record saying that I didn't think that...
293000	296000	Don't make me dig up the archive of last week's show.
296000	299000	I said I wasn't sure, but I didn't think they would.
299000	301000	Well, it is what it is.
301000	306000	They didn't go down that same path, and many would say they won E3 because of it.
306000	310000	And never mind the negatives in Sony's press conference.
310000	312000	I'm not trying to sound like a fanboy here.
312000	316000	I will get to some of the positives of Microsoft's in a minute here, because yes, I do believe there are some positives.
316000	319000	But as far as the Sony things go, never mind the whole...
319000	323000	By the way, PlayStation Plus, yeah, is the only way you're going to be able to play online multiplayer now.
323000	328000	I mean, it's glossed right by that. Nobody cares because they squashed the other thing.
328000	333000	Never mind barely a wink and a nod to the PlayStation Vita.
333000	336000	It's the place for indie developers to be at.
336000	339000	But no price cut to announce, nothing really else to announce this time.
339000	342000	Never mind that whole thing.
342000	351000	You know, Sony addressed the things that the people on the internet really wanted to hear the most about, and got everybody talking because of it.
351000	360000	And actually what's kind of funny is I think, if I remember correctly, in between the whole talking about their policies and stuff like that, and the price point, wasn't there like,
360000	364000	Oh, by the way, here's Final Fantasy XV. Oh, and Kingdom Hearts III. You know, that type of thing.
364000	368000	Yeah, and going to our chat room, I always have to acknowledge the live folks.
368000	376000	We do tape live every Sunday night, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice Geeks Network, voggenetwork.com.
376000	379000	We have our live chatters, Shadownextgen in chat saying,
379000	384000	Sony did a masterful job of misleading people in that conference. I give Sony PR a huge amount of credit.
384000	389000	Yeah, things like Kingdom Hearts III, Final Fantasy XV, again, Jaws on the floor.
389000	392000	Those weren't exclusive games. We all know that now.
392000	400000	And they never said they were exclusive games, but now we associate that with PlayStation 4, because those guys were on stage at the Sony press conference.
400000	406000	And there's many, I think there are many people that are like, where they were meant to be played.
406000	415000	Well, and in PlayStation Plus too is, you know, Rocio was saying $5 a month. It's actually cheaper than that, because it's $40, or $50 a year.
415000	420000	So, it's even cheaper than Xbox Live Gold.
420000	425000	Which, what would $50 get you on Gold?
425000	428000	It's about the same. It's close. It's about the same.
428000	430000	How much is Gold per month? I thought it was more than that.
430000	436000	To be fair, Microsoft tried to raise the bar at their own press conference by saying, we're going to start giving away games with an Xbox Gold subscription.
436000	444000	Fable 3 is already up, and then they announced, what, Halo 3 and Assassin's Creed 2, which I know a lot of you guys are like, snore, I already own those games.
444000	450000	Here's the thing, though, and it's only up until the Xbox One launches, though, not afterwards. So, it's kind of lame.
450000	460000	I mean, it's cool if you're buying a 360 for, like, Grand Theft Auto 5 or something like that, and you get your one month free of Gold, and you can go download all these extra games. I mean, that's kind of cool.
461000	476000	Here's the thing, too, is that what a way Sony has come from 2006, when they were the laughing stock of E3, right? Remember, $599 US dollars? Attack the crab's weak point for massive damage.
476000	478000	They did make a joke about that.
478000	487000	Oh, yeah, then the guy had that joke about that. And then, what does Sony do in their press conference? Attack Microsoft's weak points for massive damage. Literally. That's what happened.
487000	496000	Yeah, I mean, I seriously thought when they announced that the price point was $499, you know, when Microsoft did that, it was kind of like, oh, here's Sony's press conference all over again, you know?
496000	514000	And the biggest thing that really, in my opinion, even bigger than the press conference, sticking it to Microsoft, was that YouTube that instantly showed up, floating around with the two guys, what, Yoshida and the other guy from PlayStation, doing the tutorial on how to share used games.
514000	523000	I don't see shade like that thrown outside of an episode of RuPaul's Drag Race. That was some massive shade on Sony's part. Bravo.
523000	530000	Well, and then, of course, you know, it immediately was turned into a series of animated gifs for the internet.
530000	538000	Oh, I'm sorry, just Tumblr has been hilarious all week, all because of seeing everything being repeated.
538000	550000	Let's go back to Microsoft for a minute. Can anyone here at the table think about some positive, before we get into where did Microsoft screw up, let's get into some positives from Microsoft's press conference. What do you think are some positives out of this whole thing?
550000	567000	They had some good games to show off. There are some exclusive games that look kind of cool, like, was it Sunset Overdrive looked pretty awesome. I mean, that looks like a pretty, it's basically, hey, this is the game right here that was supposed to be Fuse, but, you know, Fuse ended up being some generic third-person shooter.
567000	582000	Now, this is the game that, you know, I guess, not Fuse, it was Overstrike, I think what it was. So, it was supposed to be Overstrike, but now it's this game, and it looks pretty sweet.
582000	598000	It's like this very stylized, it reminded me a lot of that Unreal 4 demo, or I guess it's not demo, the actual game, Unreal 4 game, Fortnite, kind of reminded me of that, you know, versus, like, zombies and stuff, but very, you know, stylized.
599000	610000	So, that looked cool. Dead Rising 3, I guess, looks alright. I'm not a huge fan of the shift in tone in the game to more serious. It's kind of, eh.
612000	623000	I guess Mirror's Edge, but that wasn't necessarily at their conference, that was more of EA's, but Mirror's Edge, you know, looks awesome.
624000	637000	And then, not really actually even part of their conference at all, but more clarification on their policy stuff, that 10 friend-sharing thing, where you can have different circles of friends, and basically, you know, I buy a copy of, like, 4 is a 5 or something like that,
637000	646000	and I can play the game at the same time as one of my friends can play the game off of my library that I'm sharing. So, that's kind of cool, in that you can share a bunch of games, but at the same time, it's like,
647000	664000	I thought the whole reason that you're having this stuff where you can't, you know, sell used, you know, easily, is to prevent used sales, but the same, you're basically encouraging people not to buy games, because you can just play, you know, if you have a thousand friends, each one has a library shared with you,
665000	680000	you know, say you have 10 friends, and they have, you know, we're all sharing library of games, you know, or you have 10 different rings or circles or whatever, friends, you could basically be playing, like, all these games without having to buy them, you know, I don't know, it's kind of a weird strategy.
680000	691000	I'm gonna say something nice about Microsoft that I actually might get a little bit of shit for, because I'm sure not everybody will agree with me, but I actually thought overall their exclusives looked better than the PlayStation 4 exclusives,
691000	702000	yet I walked out of there still pre-ordering a PlayStation 4, because I think the third-party stuff that is on both systems, combined with everything we already got into last week about what I don't like about Microsoft's DRM.
702000	704000	But what was exclusive, though, that they were showing off?
704000	719000	On Microsoft, Killer Instinct, which I realize is getting its own bit, but I'm interested enough. Quantum Break looked great. The game that you just checked, the Sunset Overdrive looks really good.
719000	726000	Halo 5, I know not everybody's into first-person shooters, but I do like Halo games, so I'm here for Halo.
727000	733000	And there was one other one that's escaping me right now. Oh, the Crimson Dragon, the Panzer Dragoon sequel that they basically...
733000	734000	Quiet Dragon.
734000	742000	The one that they went back and just basically redid for Xbox One that they had announced at a previous press conference. I mean, there was a lot of good exclusives, whereas I look at Sony and I go,
743000	751000	I'm not really into Infamous, and they all look okay. I'll play them, but I'm not as excited as I was for maybe the Xbox One exclusives.
751000	762000	But what's really selling me is A, the fact that I will own my games on Sony and that whole takedown, and B, the third-party stuff is what I'm really here for,
762000	767000	the Kingdom Hearts and a lot of this other stuff that is going to end up being on both consoles.
767000	771000	Final Fantasy XIV, I'll probably end up picking up on PlayStation 4 and so on and so on.
772000	782000	So, let's talk about... Well, actually, I want to say two. I don't think the $4.99 price is as bad as everyone's making it out to be.
782000	797000	Granted, Sony stuck it to them with the $3.99 price. I think they had a huge advantage by going second, that they probably had three or four PowerPoint slides ready to go with whatever would undercut Microsoft.
797000	799000	And that's what they pulled out of their hat.
799000	810000	I think also that the really big negative is that whole thing with it listening, especially with the whole NSA scandal going out right about now.
810000	816000	Absolutely. We did touch on that a little bit last week, which still hasn't really been resolved. Loki?
816000	825000	Well, I was going to say the one thing, speaking of having Kinect 2.0 or whatever bundled with the system, they didn't really show me any reason.
825000	832000	In fact, they pretty much didn't show any games that utilized Kinect. I don't know if they had a trailer for Fantasia during their conference,
832000	840000	but even the games that were supposed to be for Kinect originally, Rise, for example, is now a regular controlled game.
840000	846000	That Crimson Dragon game, supposed to be a Kinect game, now it's just uses a regular controller.
846000	850000	It's like all these games now are sidestepping the use of Kinect, yet they're saying,
850000	857000	This is integral. You need to have Kinect in there for what reason? You're not using it in any of these games in a meaningful way.
857000	859000	That's my problem with it.
859000	866000	Let's talk about where Microsoft fucked up, because there's a couple key points that really is just fucking them up.
866000	870000	And it's not even just the DRM thing. I mean, obviously that's one of them.
870000	878000	But I think the big thing with that is that Microsoft honestly thinks they're trying to be progressive with this.
878000	883000	There was a really great interview that came out about this, and the interview was with Phil Spencer,
883000	886000	who I think kind of knows a little better how to talk to the media and so forth.
886000	889000	And he talks about this. He says, quote,
889000	892000	You want your library to move with you. You want your friends list to move with you.
892000	898000	We think the investment in live that we've made over the last eight years has been really important to growing that capability.
898000	902000	And when you think your gaming library, associated with your identity, is an incredibly important thing,
902000	906000	we're going through that transition right now, and gamers will come along.
906000	909000	Any other device that you own, your library is digital.
909000	915000	Frankly, if you're on the PC or a Steam customer or an App Store customer on iOS devices,
915000	917000	this is how you think about your library of content.
917000	920000	That's mistake number one Microsoft made.
920000	926000	They believe their competition with this device is Apple, which is fair.
926000	930000	Apple's a huge dominating thing. Everybody wants a piece of that. Somebody wants to take them down.
930000	935000	But while Microsoft had their eyes on Apple, and we're going to copy all these things people do,
935000	938000	because people eat this Apple shit up.
938000	944000	While Microsoft had their eyes fixated on that, they failed to recognize what was coming up right behind them.
944000	946000	Why did they fail to recognize what was coming up right behind them?
946000	953000	Because my digital library of Xbox Live Arcade games is unable to move with me to the next system.
953000	958000	It's stuck behind. Same with my current library of games. I can't move with the new system.
958000	964000	Whereas on the PlayStation 4, once the Gaikai service launches, I will be able to move with my digital purchases.
964000	968000	Or at least some of them, and it will probably slowly roll out.
968000	975000	Here's the other problem, and I believe this to be a way bigger deal than some of you may think,
975000	980000	but I think Microsoft made a huge mistake getting rid of all their community outreach people,
980000	982000	which they did some time ago.
982000	985000	Remember when they got rid of all the people that were doing the Xbox TV thing,
985000	989000	and they got rid of the Gamerscore blog, and they got rid of a lot of their community outreach people?
989000	993000	Oops. Microsoft forgot how to talk to the community.
993000	998000	Hence the embarrassment that's now on par with Sony's 2006 press conference,
998000	1000000	when they forgot how to talk to the community.
1000000	1004000	Luckily, Sony's got their mojo back. Maybe Microsoft will get it back in a couple years.
1004000	1008000	But they screwed up with that. They don't know how to talk.
1008000	1013000	Again, this is all boardroom decisions. This is what gamers want.
1013000	1017000	Gamers want iOS functionality in their console.
1017000	1019000	Hey, you have shitty internet?
1019000	1022000	iOS games are also 99 cents. Sorry, Loki.
1022000	1024000	And if you have shitty internet, you buy a 360.
1024000	1028000	That's our option for you, because the Xbox One needs to be connected.
1028000	1030000	Or if you're in another country.
1030000	1033000	Yes, or another country. Here's the other great thing about that, too.
1033000	1038000	He was like, well, you have to understand, you know, you're not going to buy a cell phone if you don't have cell service.
1039000	1048000	The problem is, your device, it's not a device that, like, I don't buy internet so that my game console works.
1048000	1053000	You know, a phone, you buy to access the phone network.
1053000	1059000	This is a, you know, internet's used for your PC, for TV stuff, for your phone, for whatever.
1059000	1065000	It's a multi, I mean, it's like saying, well, you don't, you know, it's like plugging into the wall and getting power for stuff.
1066000	1068000	It's not just for one thing.
1068000	1075000	So, saying that, oh, well, you know, perhaps if you have terrible internet, then you guess you don't need this new console.
1075000	1078000	I just think it's kind of dumb to limit themselves like that.
1078000	1081000	And many other ways that they're limiting themselves.
1081000	1087000	Also, he comes out and sounds like a complete, or I forget who it was, Phil Spencer, I think, comes out and sounds like a complete jackass.
1087000	1089000	You know, when he's like, I don't even know.
1089000	1096000	You know, he was talking about like, you know, oh, you know, someone was telling me that their friend works on a, you know, nuclear sub and stuff.
1096000	1097000	I don't even know what that means.
1097000	1099000	Actually, I was going to bring that up next.
1099000	1102000	That was a huge faux pas on Microsoft's part.
1102000	1103000	That was Don Mattrick actually that said that.
1103000	1104000	Don Mattrick, my man.
1104000	1112000	And I predict he will be replaced within 365 days because somebody's going to take the fall for this crap and it's going to be him.
1113000	1118000	He will be replaced within 365 days because somebody's going to take the fall for this and it's going to be him.
1118000	1120000	And I'm sorry, Xbox fanboys.
1120000	1122000	I know there's many of you saying, oh, it could still win.
1122000	1124000	They could still win the holiday season.
1124000	1126000	I honestly don't think so.
1126000	1127000	They've already lost the holidays.
1127000	1129000	It's too late to reverse course.
1129000	1131000	Corporations don't know how to talk off script.
1131000	1135000	It's going to take a miracle for Microsoft to pull out the holiday at this point.
1135000	1139000	Xbox fans, your biggest sticking point right now, honestly.
1139000	1146000	A, ask a Nintendo fan how to deal with six months of bullshit coming from the internet because, you know, you can take comfort with them.
1146000	1148000	But we'll get to Nintendo in a minute.
1148000	1157000	And B, stick to the exclusives because that's the big thing that Microsoft has going for it right now is that you won't be able to play a lot of that stuff.
1157000	1159000	Halo 5 is huge and you won't be able to play it anymore.
1159000	1163000	Well, on top of that, too, like, you know, these retailers or whatever.
1163000	1172000	Now that Sony is not following suit with the Xbox One, guess where they're pushing the customers that are preordering stuff.
1172000	1174000	Where their bigger margins are.
1174000	1175000	PlayStation 4.
1175000	1179000	So you have that working against them as well.
1179000	1181000	Unless, you know, they change their mind.
1181000	1184000	But I think even a lot of people are like saying, hey, you know what?
1184000	1192000	Even if they change their mind and, you know, you know, reverse their decision on this stuff, I'm still not going to support them because they took this stance in the first place.
1192000	1195000	And what kind of bullshit are they trying to put us through?
1195000	1199000	Shadow Next Gen in chat says the Internet is a vocal minority.
1199000	1201000	They don't matter in the grand scheme of things.
1201000	1206000	Okay, let's talk about my coworkers who have already decided they won't be buying an Xbox One.
1206000	1219000	Or the random employee at Disneyland that saw we were coming from E3 that was talking to my friend and I about stuff and how he's been an Xbox fanboy all this time and does not plan to get an Xbox One.
1219000	1225000	The Internet may be a vocal minority, but the little ripple starts here and the tidal wave can crash.
1225000	1228000	Or relatives of mine who all they do is play Farmville, but they saw enough.
1228000	1232000	The Internet is really not the minority you like to think it is.
1232000	1242000	You may have more vocal people in the minority, but the majority of people who are in the consumer market are going to have access to the Internet and see this information.
1242000	1243000	End of story.
1243000	1248000	And here's something that came from one of those stupid courses.
1248000	1251000	I'm sorry, I hate to say this, Rob, because I know this is what you do.
1251000	1254000	But you know those little team building courses that you do at work?
1255000	1257000	One of them was called being an advocate.
1257000	1264000	And for every one person that complains, there are eight other people who do not.
1264000	1268000	Who still have that same opinion, who will be swayed by the one that complains.
1268000	1278000	And then RossDielUT in our chat room even points out, and I was going to bring this up, but this shit even got on Rachel Maddow's blog, who was bashing the fact that...
1278000	1279000	I love her.
1279000	1292000	Well, despite however you feel about her with politics and everything, the fact that she is working for MSNBC, her show is on MSNBC, and she's basically bashing what was said about the whole fact that you won't be able to play it on a nuclear submarine.
1292000	1297000	And the whole fact that basically the Xbox is giving the finger to the military and all this stuff.
1297000	1299000	I mean, that was a huge faux pas.
1299000	1301000	And don't forget about the other jokes.
1301000	1302000	Yeah.
1302000	1303000	Alright.
1303000	1314000	One other thing I want to bring up that is a key failure on Microsoft's part, and if Microsoft can pull out the holiday, this is the only way they're going to be able to do it.
1314000	1318000	And that is the fact that the Xbox One is married to Kinect.
1318000	1329000	And it says a lot when not a single game at that press conference, not one of them, used Kinect.
1329000	1333000	I know there were some on the show floor with Just Dance 2014 and the Fantasia game.
1333000	1336000	And some of the games that they did show did support it, but it wasn't shown.
1336000	1337000	Exactly.
1337000	1343000	So what's the big fucking deal about Kinect, and why is there going to be one force included with every single system?
1343000	1351000	Because I'll bet you the way that PlayStation got the price of their console down to $399 is A, they're going to shaft you on memory storage, B...
1351000	1353000	500 gigabytes on the hard drive.
1353000	1354000	On the $399 version?
1354000	1355000	Yep.
1355000	1356000	There is only one version.
1356000	1357000	It's $399.
1357000	1358000	Really?
1358000	1360000	They're not going to try to put out a $499?
1360000	1361000	Nope.
1361000	1362000	Wow.
1362000	1363000	Okay, color me surprised.
1363000	1366000	But they definitely are not including the PlayStation Eye and stuff.
1366000	1372000	And on top of that, it is upgradeable, just like the PlayStation 3.
1372000	1374000	But the Eye and all that stuff, nowhere to be seen.
1374000	1375000	Eye is $60.
1375000	1376000	Separate.
1376000	1377000	Yeah.
1377000	1380000	Even so, that's not enough to bump it up a whole hundred bucks.
1380000	1381000	Yeah.
1381000	1389000	So I think the only way that Microsoft is going to be able, especially with all this negative perception Kinect has right now in the backlash,
1389000	1397000	I really think the only way Microsoft is going to be able to pull the holidays out is to drop the price of the console a hundred bucks, detach itself from Kinect.
1397000	1403000	And now we can have a debate about are the exclusives worth the DRM restrictions and yada, yada, yada.
1403000	1405000	I still don't know that that's going to be enough.
1405000	1407000	For me, it still won't be, honestly.
1407000	1409000	But you never know.
1409000	1412000	I mean, I think the internet is speaking loud and clear.
1412000	1414000	The gamer fan base is upset.
1414000	1420000	I don't think a corporation like Microsoft can move fast enough, but we'll see.
1420000	1426000	Well, and on top of that, just in the general way they've disrespected their user base,
1426000	1432000	I wouldn't give them my money until I could buy one second hand that would assure that they wouldn't get that money.
1432000	1434000	And on top of that, a lot of the stuff that they were-
1434000	1435000	Might be a bit much.
1435000	1437000	Well, you know what? No, I do that stuff. You know me.
1437000	1443000	There were some games that they showed that were Xbox exclusive, and I'm not just talking about Xbox One,
1443000	1445000	both Xbox One and Xbox 360.
1445000	1450000	Like, for example, the new Plants vs. Zombies game, which looks pretty sweet.
1450000	1454000	Whatever. You know what? I don't care. It looks fantastic.
1454000	1459000	And so that'll be one I want to pick up on Xbox 360 when it comes out later on.
1459000	1464000	And Titanfall was another one that was, I think, Xbox One, Xbox 360 exclusive.
1464000	1468000	Hell, I have a 360. I'm going to be gaming on it for a long time, credit without a five.
1468000	1475000	So I'm not worried about all these games coming out that, you know, may be only on the Xbox platforms,
1475000	1477000	because I have an Xbox platform. I'm just, you know-
1479000	1481000	I just- I'm not going to buy two next-gen consoles.
1481000	1488000	And not necessarily because I just don't like- I mean, I don't really like the policies that they have with Xbox One,
1488000	1490000	but I can't afford two consoles right now like that.
1490000	1497000	And I did- I bought all three this generation, and I play one of the three, so I'm not going to throw away my money like that.
1497000	1502000	Just buy one, and then when they drop their price and release a Grand Theft Auto 6 or something like that,
1502000	1506000	that's exclusive to Xbox One, which will never happen, but then we can talk about it.
1506000	1510000	BloodJunk makes a good point that Titanfall is also on PC.
1510000	1512000	Yeah, but my laptop can't run that.
1512000	1514000	But my computer can.
1514000	1517000	Before we get into our gaming weeks and covering the rest of the news tonight,
1517000	1522000	and ultimately getting to your calls at 1877 Game OLR and your further chat comments and so forth,
1522000	1525000	I don't- we've been very focused on Microsoft versus Sony, as a lot of people have.
1525000	1529000	I don't want to ignore Nintendo, because obviously, you know, that's a console too,
1529000	1533000	and they had their own set of expectations going into E3.
1533000	1535000	How did we all feel about Nintendo?
1535000	1539000	I'll start with Nintendo's biggest critic in the room. Loki, how did you feel about what Nintendo-
1539000	1541000	There was nothing surprising from them.
1541000	1545000	Honestly, because all the stuff that we knew was coming, they basically announced.
1545000	1547000	There wasn't anything like, oh, hey, I didn't see that.
1547000	1551000	Okay, the only game I didn't know that was coming was a new Donkey Kong game,
1551000	1553000	and I was like, poof, who cares?
1553000	1555000	You know, we just had a Donkey Kong game come out.
1555000	1559000	I don't really care. This looks exactly like the other one, except, oh, now we go and it's 3D,
1559000	1561000	and it goes into the background, and then who gives a shit?
1561000	1566000	Mario Kart 8 looks nice, and, you know, the gimmick of, you know, the gravity thing looks cool,
1566000	1569000	and there's going to be some interesting tracks, but it doesn't look like it plays that different,
1569000	1574000	so I'm not too excited about that, and usually Mario Kart sells me systems.
1574000	1577000	I mean, I bought all the other Nintendo systems from Mario Kart,
1577000	1580000	but I just don't really care anymore about it.
1580000	1584000	Smash Brothers looked kind of cool, and some of the new characters that they're announcing are kind of,
1584000	1587000	it's neat, I like how they're going with that.
1587000	1594000	Bayonetta 2 just kind of, it was all right, but when's that coming out? No idea.
1594000	1597000	Well, 2014, but that could be Christmas 2014.
1597000	1600000	Originally, it was supposed to be 2013, so I don't know.
1601000	1606000	Zelda Wind Waker HD just doesn't look like they've really done a lot to it.
1606000	1610000	They didn't really add anything to it, other than, you know, now you can travel the seas faster.
1610000	1614000	Well, and that Accel Shaded game looks a lot better on HD, but, you know.
1614000	1621000	I'm still disappointed, though, that a system that plays Wii games isn't able to up-res those things.
1621000	1624000	Yeah, here's the thing about Nintendo for me.
1624000	1628000	You know, I'm a Wii U owner, and originally when I walked away from the Nintendo Direct,
1628000	1636000	which was a mess in itself to watch, and I hope to hell Nintendo just streams with another partner next year,
1636000	1639000	because the Ustream thing was embarrassing, how horrible that was to watch.
1639000	1643000	But anyway, all that aside, when you really kind of looked at the news itself,
1643000	1645000	a lot of it was just kind of par.
1645000	1649000	You know, I'm not like, I wasn't like, woo, Nintendo, like super excited.
1649000	1655000	I mean, certainly the couple games that I was excited about, I'm really excited about.
1655000	1662000	Mario Kart 8 looks killer. The new Mario 3D World, which, I don't get the 3D, not on a 3DS.
1662000	1663000	But whatever, okay, whatever.
1663000	1664000	And Cats.
1664000	1669000	I forgive it, because it's got the floating princess and Luigi legs again, whatever. And Cats.
1669000	1670000	And X looked good.
1670000	1673000	Yeah, and so, you know, yeah, that's all stuff that's cool.
1673000	1677000	And then I was kind of like, that's a lot of 2014 stuff.
1677000	1681000	That's the thing that kind of concerned me about it, is that it's not that the games don't look good,
1681000	1683000	because they all do look really good, and, you know, hey, it's Nintendo.
1683000	1689000	But I was kind of like, man, I kind of wanted Nintendo to really have a come-from-behind holiday,
1689000	1691000	and they're going to really kick some butt this holiday season.
1691000	1694000	And I'm kind of like, maybe they'll kick butt in 2014,
1694000	1697000	because they didn't announce a price drop or anything to really move those consoles this season.
1697000	1702000	They have the same fucking lineup they had, well, two years ago with the 3DS.
1702000	1704000	A new Mario 3D Land and Mario Kart.
1704000	1707000	It's seriously, they're just repeating the steps.
1707000	1710000	So what, are we going to get a price drop? Same strategy as the 3DS.
1710000	1714000	But those games are enough to make me want to go out and buy a Wii U, assuming I had the funds for it.
1714000	1718000	Wait a second, that's actually exactly their strategy, because there's also another new Mario,
1718000	1720000	or, I'm sorry, new Luigi U game in August.
1720000	1721000	Smash Brothers.
1721000	1723000	Yeah, but Smash Brothers is not until 2014.
1723000	1725000	Yeah, but I don't care, that makes me want a Wii U.
1725000	1731000	It's literally the exact same lineup as, like, 2011 for the 3DS on the Wii U.
1731000	1732000	It's, like, exactly.
1732000	1734000	And this is my I don't care face, I want one.
1734000	1738000	I didn't get to finish my thought completely, and now people in chat are like, Rob, you're wrong.
1738000	1744000	The thing is, is that even if Nintendo chooses not to drop the price of their console,
1744000	1747000	which I don't think is the smartest decision, but okay, if they don't do it,
1747000	1750000	there's still the cheapest option out there at the holiday season.
1750000	1757000	And I think there are a lot of families that aren't informed on this whole Microsoft versus Sony thing,
1757000	1760000	and are simply going to go for the cheapest option that the thing is for their kids.
1760000	1764000	Because, you know, yes, the Mario games are going to speak to certain people and so forth.
1765000	1772000	But, this is where I'm torn, because that argument should have worked last year.
1772000	1774000	See, that's my problem.
1774000	1778000	We had a Mario game last year, and the console still didn't sell.
1778000	1783000	Okay, so we have a couple more this year, but we don't have anything else to really push it.
1783000	1789000	So you're just telling me that more of the same is going to move more consoles.
1789000	1792000	I'm not, I mean, I'm skeptical.
1792000	1794000	And I'm not rooting against Nintendo.
1794000	1798000	I really hate that all these publishers are abandoning Nintendo.
1798000	1800000	I think they're being dicks about it.
1800000	1805000	But, I want to see Nintendo do better, but I just kind of, I feel like,
1805000	1810000	I didn't really get it from them how they're going to light a fire under the Wii U.
1810000	1812000	That's what was frustrating for me.
1817000	1821000	Let's see, going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
1821000	1824000	FrosteelUT says, Rob, Nintendo had a good holiday season.
1824000	1827000	The problem is that after holiday it was dead.
1827000	1829000	Well, I mean, that's a problem.
1829000	1834000	And I would argue it didn't have a holiday season like Wii's or Xbox 360's when it launched.
1834000	1837000	It had a pretty decent launch, but the thing was that,
1837000	1841000	yeah, there were no games for like three months after it came out,
1841000	1843000	and a lot of them were ports of older games.
1843000	1846000	And we could very well see that kind of line up,
1846000	1849000	although they're going to have Wii Fit U, big deal.
1849000	1855000	And I don't even know what they're going to have for the first quarter of 2014.
1855000	1859000	So, yeah, there is a lot of stuff that, who knows where this is,
1859000	1860000	they're going to be coming out.
1860000	1863000	Koopakit Jeremy in chat says, third party games would sell more
1863000	1866000	if they took the time to make the games comparable to PlayStation 3 and 360.
1866000	1870000	Injustice is a good example. No DLC for Wii U owners.
1870000	1871000	Actually, Mass Effect 3 was the same way.
1871000	1874000	Yeah, something's up there.
1874000	1877000	Like, is something fucked up with Nintendo Network
1877000	1880000	where DLC isn't as easy to do or something,
1880000	1884000	because why do we keep seeing these subpar games that, you know,
1884000	1889000	they launch and it's eh, and then they're like piss poorly supported after launch?
1889000	1893000	Mass Effect 3 is a great example. It's not a better experience on Wii U.
1893000	1895000	It had nothing to carry over on top of that.
1895000	1900000	All the things that made playing 3 actually kind of mildly worthwhile
1900000	1902000	was carrying over your previous game data,
1902000	1904000	and it didn't even have a good version to do that.
1904000	1907000	Anyway, I want to move on to the other stories and so forth,
1907000	1909000	but I do want to say, like, on a positive note for Nintendo,
1909000	1912000	I think one other thing to keep in mind when I'm talking about that,
1912000	1914000	you know, I'm not seeing enough or whatever.
1914000	1918000	One thing that should be noted is that one thing Nintendo has been doing right
1918000	1920000	is that they're doing more of those Nintendo directs,
1920000	1925000	and they did already put out some surprises that would usually be an E3 thing, right?
1925000	1927000	The Zelda 3D on 3DS and so forth.
1928000	1932000	3DS fucking rules right now. Like, as far as handhelds go,
1932000	1937000	I mean, PlayStation is phoning in the Vita, 3DS is Amazeballs,
1937000	1941000	Animal Crossing, Zelda, Smash Brothers.
1941000	1945000	I mean, 3DS is fucking where it's at for handhelds right now if you're, like, a gamer.
1945000	1947000	Like, that's one thing Nintendo ain't doing wrong.
1947000	1949000	It just took them a long time to get there.
1949000	1952000	But, you know, a lot of that stuff kind of came out before,
1952000	1957000	so I'm hoping that maybe there's another Nintendo Direct in a month
1957000	1959000	that has some other stuff to get us excited.
1959000	1963000	I know there's some news coming up later that maybe Nintendo hasn't played all their cards right now,
1963000	1965000	so that will be interesting to see play out.
1967000	1974000	All right. Any other thoughts on the big three before we get into our gaming weeks quickly and gaming news and all that?
1975000	1981000	Ubisoft. Like always, Ubisoft had a lot of cool stuff to show at their press conference,
1981000	1986000	and I always kind of think that, you know, being able to take E3 each year,
1986000	1990000	they showed off, what was it, The Crew, which looked pretty awesome,
1990000	1994000	like an open world burnout type game, which is pretty sweet,
1994000	1998000	and then they also had the new Tom Clancy game, Division,
1998000	2000000	or The Division, that looked pretty cool as well,
2000000	2004000	like that MMO that ties in with, like, the iPad and stuff.
2004000	2007000	So I thought that was really cool and want to check that out.
2007000	2011000	Those games actually kind of seem like, okay, here's how we're going to use Next Gen.
2011000	2021000	They kind of showed that versus Rise, which is like, cool, you made a knockoff of God of War. Awesome.
2023000	2028000	Before we get into gaming weeks, let me ask this question with my big slash troll face,
2028000	2033000	because this is definitely the question that cynical gamers everywhere are asking.
2033000	2035000	I can't make a troll face. I tried.
2035000	2041000	What do you think will sell more this holiday season, the Xbox One or the Wii U?
2041000	2046000	What will sell more this holiday season, the Xbox One or the Wii U?
2046000	2053000	If everybody had my brain, it would be the Wii U, but not everybody is an intelligent shopper.
2053000	2059000	So I still pretty much think the Wii U is going to be a better seller.
2059000	2063000	It's a tough question to ask or answer, just because not all the data is there,
2063000	2066000	because there's also rumors that they're having trouble with chip yields.
2066000	2070000	So you may end up with a shortage problem at launch.
2070000	2076000	So, you know, to be honest, I think that the Xbox One will sell more than the Wii U.
2076000	2082000	And why is that? Because you think something is, oh, but not PlayStation 4?
2082000	2085000	PlayStation 4 will outsell both, all of them.
2085000	2091000	I think, if anything, you can still have Xbox 360 selling more than the Xbox One,
2091000	2096000	and probably the Wii U as well, just because, granted, that's out of five.
2096000	2099000	No, they have a lot of exclusives for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
2099000	2104000	And honestly, I don't see Wii U as next-gen. I'm sorry.
2104000	2109000	It's still, graphically and performance-wise, it's on par with PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
2109000	2115000	So it's just like, I don't know, in-between-gen or something, whatever you want to call it.
2115000	2122000	I'm going to say Wii U sells more this holiday season because of households with children under 12,
2122000	2126000	and the parents that will have the fond memories of Nintendo and so forth.
2126000	2130000	And I think a lot of the hardcore gamers, I think a lot of them are going Sony.
2130000	2133000	Sorry, Xbox fans, but what's that?
2133000	2139000	But it doesn't really matter, though, because they don't need to buy a new system, though,
2139000	2141000	for these games that they're wanting to play.
2141000	2146000	Everyone eats up Skylanders, and everybody is probably going to eat up Disney Infinity.
2146000	2148000	Those are both on Wii.
2148000	2155000	You're going to have, I don't know, it's another Mario game.
2155000	2158000	I mean, how many Mario games are we going to have come out already?
2158000	2164000	I don't think it's that amazing that 3D Land is coming out.
2164000	2168000	It looks kind of like a slightly better version of the 3DS one,
2168000	2171000	and that's not a big, once again, not a big deal for me,
2171000	2174000	because that was just like New Super Mario Brothers U.
2174000	2181000	But here's the big reason, the other big reason why I think Wii U is going to go over better than Xbox One,
2181000	2185000	and it's like you were saying, but this is apart from brand recognition,
2185000	2188000	you also do have a known quantity.
2188000	2194000	Whereas they are making so many different changes with the X-Bone
2194000	2201000	that I think that a lot of people are going to go towards something that they, as a consumer, can put more trust in.
2201000	2205000	Well, let's see what the listeners think.
2205000	2210000	Live.vognetwork.com and answer this live poll right now.
2210000	2213000	What will sell more this holiday season?
2213000	2216000	Your options are Wii U or Xbox One.
2216000	2219000	Asking the questions of cynical gamers everywhere.
2219000	2224000	What's going to sell out of the two underdogs going into this holiday?
2224000	2225000	Dreamcast.
2225000	2227000	Wii U or Xbox One.
2227000	2231000	Registered participants can vote on the site at live.vognetwork.com.
2231000	2235000	If you're not a registered participant, you should do so, because it's free and we won't spam you.
2235000	2237000	Super promise.
2237000	2241000	Yeah, like I was saying, I don't hate Nintendo first party games,
2241000	2243000	but I just don't think any of them are system sellers.
2243000	2250000	Like for example, if instead of the remake of Wind Waker, they had a brand new next gen Zelda game,
2250000	2253000	yeah, that might be something to sell people on the system.
2253000	2256000	But a game that's basically an upgrade of a 3DS game,
2256000	2262000	I don't think that it didn't really work too well for New Super Mario Brothers U,
2262000	2265000	and I don't think it's going to work too well for New Luigi U.
2265000	2271000	So why is a third Mario game that's just a platformer that doesn't really seem that different from what's already out there,
2271000	2273000	I don't think that's going to be a system seller, that's the thing.
2273000	2276000	Mario Kart or anything? It's Mario Kart.
2276000	2278000	No 3DO Ikuma JP.
2278000	2283000	Alright, we will get to the results of our live poll right after our gaming weeks.
2283000	2285000	Let's try to keep them a little bit shorter tonight because we had a lot of E3 talk,
2285000	2288000	but Dark Soccer, what have you been tapped into this week?
2288000	2292000	Well, we busted out the Atari 5200 for Atari Party coming up, getting everything working.
2292000	2294000	So there was some Panko going on in my house, Rob.
2294000	2295000	Nice.
2295000	2296000	Thought you would have liked it.
2296000	2297000	Loves it.
2297000	2298000	And Super Pac-Man.
2299000	2302000	We have Millipede because we have some prototype re-releases.
2302000	2308000	I could not play Mass Effect 3 because I've been in the middle of upgrading all of my graphics in it so that it looks even more gorgeous,
2308000	2311000	even if it's not the best story-wise.
2311000	2314000	I've been playing the first Mass Effect and I played it on the stream on Thursday,
2314000	2320000	and I'm probably going to end up getting it beaten on the stream next Thursday, if I feel like it.
2323000	2326000	Really? Oh yeah, Final Fantasy XIV.
2326000	2330000	Because we had a beta weekend, and I have a Thaumaturge.
2330000	2332000	Oh yeah, we can talk about that now, huh?
2332000	2335000	Yeah, we can. We just can't say anything about the last beta.
2335000	2337000	Well, I didn't play in this beta weekend, so I guess I can't really.
2337000	2342000	I just got my invite for PlayStation 3, so I will have to download it.
2344000	2351000	I think that, honestly, after as long as I played WoW, it has everything that I liked in Cataclysm,
2351000	2353000	because that's what got me playing WoW.
2353000	2360000	And none of the utter grinding crap that's in the panda version.
2360000	2363000	Panda area. Stupid pandas.
2363000	2366000	Gummy bears, gummy bears. WoW gummy bear edition.
2366000	2369000	So I'm really enjoying it, and I like playing my catgirl.
2369000	2371000	Or my mikote, or whatever she's called.
2371000	2372000	She's a catgirl.
2372000	2373000	Mythra.
2373000	2374000	No.
2374000	2376000	Although they have the same animations.
2376000	2379000	It's so stupid that they change the name.
2379000	2380000	They have the same animations.
2380000	2381000	They're the same races.
2381000	2384000	I think Lalafell is probably the cutest name for that race possible.
2384000	2388000	And it's kind of funny finding gangster Lalafell in the town I started in.
2388000	2390000	They're like, we're badass Lalafell.
2390000	2393000	There's this little Lalafell walking around looking all badass wearing a monocle.
2393000	2396000	And then these two big hulking guys behind him.
2396000	2398000	He's like, look at me, I'm a badass midget.
2398000	2400000	It was pretty funny. So yeah.
2401000	2402000	Loki.
2402000	2409000	I played literally one session of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 this week.
2409000	2414000	Because every other time I was just basically reading E3 news, all my coworkers were gone.
2414000	2417000	So I didn't get to play with anybody.
2417000	2421000	And I was working on 3D modeling in the meantime.
2421000	2423000	So yeah, I didn't play anything.
2423000	2430000	I did buy, though, the Serious Sam collection on Humble Bundle, the weekly sale.
2430000	2431000	So I got that.
2432000	2435000	Fuck, I never got a Humble Bundle 8 and it's done, huh?
2435000	2436000	Yep.
2436000	2437000	Shit.
2437000	2438000	Oh well. That was my bad.
2438000	2439000	Oh well.
2440000	2442000	So, I mean, that was pretty cool.
2442000	2444000	You don't just have to buy Humble Bundle 9, maybe they'll throw a name with it.
2444000	2446000	Yeah, it's true, it's true.
2447000	2451000	So, I mean, I haven't ever played any of that series, but it looked cool.
2451000	2453000	So I wanted to pick that up and I thought it was a good deal.
2454000	2455000	What else?
2456000	2459000	Bought PlayStation Plus for a year.
2459000	2464000	Haven't redeemed it yet, though, but I'm looking forward to trying out the free games that are on there and stuff.
2465000	2468000	Because I have a 500 gig hard drive to fill up with games that I haven't played yet.
2468000	2475000	And a pre-ordered PlayStation 4, because I'm worried that I might not be able to get one if I don't.
2475000	2476000	So, I did.
2477000	2478000	Alright.
2478000	2483000	Oh, and just to say, for those of us who are playing Final Fantasy XIV and want to join us on a beta weekend,
2483000	2486000	we are on the North American Behemoth server.
2486000	2487000	There you go.
2487000	2488000	Do you have a link shell yet?
2488000	2489000	We don't have a link shell yet.
2489000	2490000	We don't have a link shell yet.
2490000	2491000	Okay, I will have to remember that.
2491000	2495000	And you can only add friends if they're online at the same time, so I couldn't get anybody.
2495000	2498000	Remind me later to talk to you about Facebook things.
2498000	2501000	Unless Shane Alinko happens to be listening, then you know what to do.
2501000	2502000	Alright.
2502000	2504000	As far as Loki's concerned.
2504000	2506000	Which I think I did see him in chat earlier.
2506000	2507000	Okay, so my gaming week.
2507000	2513000	So, even though Orange Lawn and Tradio, the world's longest weekly internet show about video games,
2513000	2515000	is not a recognized media outfit of E3,
2515000	2520000	I went down to the show anyway just to, well, to get Bobby.
2520000	2523000	And I did check out the Ouya booth, because it was open to all.
2523000	2524000	It was outside.
2524000	2525000	So, what the heck?
2525000	2526000	I went to go check out the Ouya.
2526000	2530000	Because I didn't get a whole lot of hands on time with Ouya when Loki brought it over, right?
2530000	2532000	So, I did get to check out a few new games on Ouya.
2532000	2534000	One of the games I played was Soul Fjord.
2534000	2538000	And funny enough, it's like the first game I walked up to and I'm like,
2538000	2539000	alright, so tell me about your game.
2539000	2542000	And he's like, well, it's like a rhythm game.
2542000	2543000	He goes, it's hard to explain.
2543000	2546000	He's like, it's a rhythm game mixed with a roguelike.
2546000	2550000	I'm like, this sounds like the perfect game right up my alley.
2550000	2552000	I love dungeon crawlers and I love rhythm games.
2552000	2553000	Tell me more, sir.
2553000	2555000	So, he actually showed me the game.
2555000	2557000	And yes, it is a rhythm game mixed with a roguelike.
2557000	2560000	It's like a dungeon crawler, but you attack to the beat of the music.
2560000	2564000	And your little combos, like when you want to do a combo, you hold down the trigger.
2564000	2566000	And little beat patterns show over your sword.
2566000	2568000	So, you can kind of do the little patterns.
2568000	2570000	And if you do it right, you do like an AoE attack.
2570000	2571000	So, it was kind of cool.
2571000	2572000	Yeah, it was cute.
2572000	2573000	I liked it.
2573000	2574000	So, I have my eye on that.
2574000	2577000	Like, if I'm going to get a new AoE, which I might, depending on finances,
2577000	2579000	I would definitely pick up Solfjord.
2579000	2580000	I like that.
2580000	2581000	That was fun.
2581000	2586000	He did say, if I heard the guy correctly, he said, though, it's going to be a difficult game.
2586000	2588000	And if you die, you die.
2588000	2589000	It's like Dark Souls.
2589000	2591000	You go all the way back to start.
2591000	2593000	So, you know, that whole thing.
2593000	2595000	So, that'll be interesting to see what happens.
2597000	2598000	Let's see.
2598000	2600000	I saw another game called The Amazing Frog.
2600000	2601000	This game was weird.
2602000	2603000	What?
2603000	2605000	No, I want to know about this one because I've heard of it.
2605000	2607000	It looked weird to me.
2607000	2612000	And I'm going to admit, it's a game where you can tell the graphics on the Ouya are a little bit behind.
2612000	2616000	Because the other two games, like Solfjord, looked like any other Xbox Live arcade game to me.
2616000	2617000	It was, like, cartoony.
2617000	2619000	You know, it looked like that to me.
2619000	2624000	I could tell The Amazing Frog was a little weaker graphically.
2624000	2625000	But that's not the developer's fault.
2625000	2628000	I hear the game has really loud boomboxes in it.
2628000	2630000	I couldn't figure it out.
2630000	2633000	Like, it's like this open world frog runner game.
2633000	2637000	And all you can do with the controller is you jump and you fling.
2637000	2642000	And it's like this big open playground and you can fling yourself on a trampoline and go flying.
2642000	2645000	It is the type of open world shit you would eat right out the monkey.
2645000	2646000	No, I've already played it before.
2646000	2650000	So, it's basically like the insurance fraud mode in Saints Row.
2650000	2656000	You basically run around and you try to hit a bunch of explosives and chain your frog to, you know,
2656000	2661000	land in the air and knock shit over and you make cars explode and all that fun stuff.
2661000	2665000	So, I wasn't sure I got the game in there, but as far as, like,
2665000	2666000	Well, it's still very early.
2666000	2668000	Yeah, I'm kind of like giving these guys the benefit of the doubt.
2668000	2671000	I'm like, alright, it's early. It's just a concept. We'll see. We'll see.
2671000	2674000	Keep your eye on it. I'm not saying it's bad. I'm just saying.
2674000	2675000	It's free right now.
2675000	2678000	I didn't get it, but maybe I'll get it later.
2678000	2682000	The other game I checked out, the third one I checked out, was called Chronoblade.
2682000	2685000	And I looked at it because it looked like Diablo from afar.
2685000	2687000	Because it had, like, the little red and blue potions in the corner.
2687000	2689000	You know, I'm like, oh, this is like a Diablo clone.
2689000	2692000	So, I went to play it and it's apparently a free-to-play game.
2692000	2695000	It's not just on Ouya. They have a web browser based thing that's in closed beta right now.
2695000	2698000	Well, here's the thing. It looks like Diablo from a distance.
2698000	2700000	It plays like the Ninja Turtles arcade game.
2700000	2701000	That's awesome.
2701000	2705000	Like, to me, it was like a beat-em-up with, like, the jump and the punch and all that.
2705000	2709000	And you could do, like, the special moves. And as you beat people up, you gain magic.
2709000	2713000	So, that's what it felt like to me. And I was like, alright, this is.
2713000	2715000	And then the guy was kind enough to give me a closed beta key.
2715000	2718000	So, I was like, I think I will be cashing that in. That looks like fun.
2718000	2722000	You can get more information on that one at facebook.com slash Chronoblade Online.
2722000	2726000	All one word. I imagine they're giving away a lot of those closed beta keys.
2726000	2730000	Soulfjord.com was the other game. And I didn't get a website or anything for Amazing Frog.
2730000	2732000	Sorry, but Google it. I'm sure you'll find it.
2732000	2738000	Well, Soulfjord is the folks behind Quantum Conundrum and that kind of stuff.
2738000	2740000	So, they make some pretty awesome games.
2741000	2748000	So, there you go. I mean, other than that, lots of Animal Crossing, but not enough to even, like, pay off my second loan.
2748000	2752000	Like, I just, there's too much. Street passing. I did a lot of street passing.
2752000	2756000	I sat in the lobby at E3 while I waited for Bobby Blackwolf because he took his time.
2756000	2760000	Which I understand. He was trying to get answers to questions and was fishing up a demo. He took his time.
2760000	2765000	And I just street passed over and over. I literally got, like, 120 puzzle pieces over the weekend.
2765000	2772000	I completed, like, two puzzles and, yeah, I'm only, like, 80 panels away from full completion.
2772000	2776000	So, that made me excited. There you go.
2776000	2783000	Dungeonbuster in chat at live.voggetetwork.com says, Uya didn't pay to be at E3, so they rented out a parking lot nearby and held their events there.
2783000	2788000	Yeah, and the ESA rented a big truck and parked it right in front of the booth.
2788000	2789000	That's kind of a dick move.
2790000	2794000	It was kind of a dick move. Like, it wasn't that big a deal, honestly.
2794000	2803000	The Uya thing was like, hey, we've got beer over here and some developer, like, I did not see the Uya being pushed.
2803000	2808000	I saw developers making games on Uya being pushed. That's what I saw.
2808000	2812000	I don't know what the ESA was so afraid of. That was kind of a dick move on their part.
2812000	2815000	I did take a picture of the whole thing. Judge for yourself.
2815000	2821000	E3.voggetetwork.com. It's the one booth I got to do. Go look at the Uya booth over there at E3.voggetetwork.com.
2821000	2826000	And you should look at all the stuff there that Bobby collected. He answered a lot of your questions.
2826000	2829000	Unfortunately, you know, sometimes there's going to be no comment or we're not going to talk about that.
2829000	2841000	But a couple, there was at least more than a couple, like a handful of things, like Square Enix basically flat out saying how to get Kingdom Hearts on Xbox, if that's what you want, giving the answer that.
2841000	2849000	A definitive price for the Disney Infinity figurines. All figured out thanks to you guys and your questions at E3.voggetetwork.com.
2849000	2855000	And more. I could have told you that, though. Just saying.
2855000	2862000	All right. To the results of the live poll. Here it is. The results of the live poll tonight. What will sell more this holiday season?
2862000	2870000	We use 61.90% Xbox One 38.10. We'll call that 60-40. It's close enough to 60-40 split there.
2870000	2872000	So it's not a blowout.
2872000	2880000	It all depends on like what price drops on the Wii U side or even the Xbox One side. And if they reverse their policy, it's just there's a lot of time.
2880000	2889000	Yeah, there is. I mean, yeah. And, you know, admittedly, that question was I said at the beginning, this is the troll face skeptic question.
2889000	2892000	But I thought it was a fun one to ask. I hope you had fun answering it.
2892000	2899000	Okay. Housekeeping. Twitter.com slash O.L.R. or Facebook. Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio.
2899000	2908000	Next week on the program, June 23rd, 2013, our pal J.V. Mohn will be here to help us celebrate 11 years of OrangeLoungeRadio.
2908000	2914000	And this is what's very interesting, too, is that June 23rd is the actual birthday. That doesn't happen every year.
2914000	2916000	So every 11 years, you can expect it's a joke.
2916000	2924000	Well, it's like every five or six years the way the leap years were. Yeah, but but this is one of the few times we actually get to celebrate a birthday on our birthday.
2924000	2928000	Maybe I will have to convince somebody else to make murder brownies again.
2928000	2934000	That would be fantastic. So we hope you guys will join us. We're not planning anything. I mean, you get to a certain age and you just kind of stop caring.
2934000	2936000	No, you can't say that.
2936000	2938000	I don't say you stop caring. I shouldn't say that. No, we are.
2938000	2943000	No, no, no. How about I quote the amazing Wanda Sykes? The older I get, the less of a fuck I give.
2943000	2952000	Kinda, kinda. But it's just one of those, you know, we don't need to have the whole self-serving, hooray, we're 11 show. We've done that before.
2952000	2955000	10 was a big thing. It was, it was.
2955000	2959000	It's great. Now I'm thinking of Patton Oswalt where he talks about what birthdays you're allowed to celebrate.
2959000	2964000	Yeah, yeah. It's like you're 11, no one cares. When you're 13, you're a teenager. That one's big.
2964000	2970000	So if you want to get us a cake, we'll eat it. That's that's what we're going to say about next week's show.
2970000	2973000	Preferably, I like carrot cake. Just saying.
2973000	2976000	Do we have confirmed our guest for two weeks now? Guest host in two weeks?
2976000	2977000	I thought we did.
2977000	2978000	I think we do.
2978000	2981000	Because of another transaction that's occurring around that.
2981000	2987000	Well, I'm just going to say I am fully expecting that in two weeks, first make slidekick from Game Buoy will be here live.
2987000	2988000	Then that'll be a lot of fun.
2988000	2990000	And if not, we're going to go get him.
2990000	2993000	And I'm going to razz the crap out of him on his old show, Fabulous Flames.
2993000	2995000	We're going to duct tape him to a buoy.
2995000	2996000	Good times.
2996000	2997000	And bring him along with us.
2997000	3003000	Good times. All right. Tune in live every Sunday for the antics. Live.vognetwork.com.
3003000	3008000	I'm hoping we can start lining up some interviews, too, now that E3 is over, because I definitely want to talk to some of these OUYA guys.
3008000	3015000	And you know, whatever else we can get now that people are going to be really in that rush to get people to preorder for the holiday.
3015000	3021000	Let's run down more news. Maybe some things you missed. Maybe not. Some clarifications. Setting people straight.
3021000	3023000	Loki, why don't you start us off with the news?
3023000	3032000	Well, Major Nelson was answering a bunch of questions. I think that he even did, like, a thing on NeoGaf where he was answering questions for people and stuff, posting on there.
3032000	3040000	But there was one of the interviews. They were basically asking, you know, obviously, very obvious questions, you know, with the announcements that, you know, Sony made.
3040000	3044000	Will this influence Microsoft and make them change what they're doing with the Xbox One?
3044000	3046000	And here's what basically he commented on.
3046000	3051000	I don't think, I mean, we're really not going to change anything we've done with the Xbox One.
3051000	3056000	We're very happy. Did you see the games on stage during the briefing? Did you see the exclusives?
3056000	3059000	I mean, we're really proud of the system and the games that are coming out.
3059000	3064000	When you look at it, games like Titanfall, have you gone through the Titanfall yet?
3064000	3069000	Enough said. Conversation over. We're really happy what they showed on stage and what's showing here in the booth.
3069000	3072000	So I think it's safe to say that we're confident where we're going.
3072000	3078000	We're also confident that gamers are going to love our vision of the future and what we're going to offer for gaming.
3078000	3084000	So basically, no, they're too stubborn to change their mind so far.
3084000	3091000	But I mean, then again, I mean, he was only being asked that a few days after, you know, the announcement.
3091000	3098000	And sales, I think sales figures, if they're trailing way behind, that could change things.
3098000	3105000	You guys have to understand that corporations and the talking heads for corporations have to stick to talking points at big shows like this.
3105000	3107000	And they have investors, remember?
3107000	3112000	They are all trained on said talking points. They don't deviate from those talking points.
3112000	3116000	And when they do it, that's why it's always news when somebody goes off the cusp.
3116000	3120000	So, you know, they always stick to their talking points.
3120000	3124000	By the way, I was checking to see if Major Nelson had replied to what I told him.
3124000	3127000	I think he's got a lot of people telling things right now.
3127000	3131000	So I thought there was an interesting comment in chat from Ross Steel UT.
3131000	3137000	Major Nelson, the only community outreach guy left, and he only stayed because he's a good enough yes man.
3137000	3140000	Does Microsoft need their Kevin Butler right now?
3142000	3150000	Dude, if they brought Kevin Butler out on stage during that play scene, I think everyone would have about lost it.
3150000	3154000	You know what I think would have been great for their presentation?
3154000	3156000	Bring hard gay out of retirement.
3156000	3160000	Have them just go around humping everybody and going, woo!
3160000	3162000	That would have sold Xbox ones right there.
3162000	3163000	Oh god, alright.
3165000	3172000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, cloud.
3172000	3177000	I only mentioned this game briefly, like really briefly, but obviously it's kind of a big deal.
3177000	3181000	You know, it's the game a lot of people were talking about before E3 is the big Microsoft announcement.
3181000	3183000	Killer Instinct.
3183000	3189000	Killer Instinct was revealed at the Microsoft press briefing, and here's the whole thing.
3189000	3193000	It came out afterwards that Killer Instinct is going to be free to play.
3193000	3197000	But they're actually now saying that that might not actually be part of it.
3197000	3199000	There's some clarifications coming out.
3199000	3208000	The game has said that the game is going to be free to play, and when it launches on Xbox One, you can get Jago for free, and then you can buy all the other characters.
3208000	3214000	However, what's not being said, the full game will also be available on its release.
3214000	3224000	So if you don't want to do the whole nickel and dime model for only certain characters, then you can drop the, assumably, 60 bucks and get the whole thing unlocked at once.
3224000	3228000	I actually think this model isn't as terrible as everyone says it is.
3228000	3231000	Now that we have the clarification, you can still get the game out of the box.
3231000	3234000	Yeah, it's basically a demo, but it's an upgradeable demo.
3234000	3238000	You're in a pretty good situation if your favorite character is Jago.
3238000	3240000	You know what it reminds me of?
3240000	3249000	It reminds me of the Rock Band game on PSP, where you could download the demo, and you could download songs from the marketplace and play them in the demo.
3249000	3254000	You never had to buy the full game unless you wanted the full game's song list.
3254000	3258000	I don't know, it kinda reminds me of that, so, interesting.
3258000	3262000	By the way, Double Helix also has unveiled Glacius as another character in the game.
3262000	3265000	He will be playable at EVO 2013.
3265000	3269000	There's also going to be 40 training lessons in the game to teach players about the game.
3269000	3281000	It is a little disappointing that it's Double Helix, the folks behind the latest Silent Hill game, are making this game and not Rare, the company behind Very Awesome Games.
3281000	3283000	KoopaKa Jeremy in chat says,
3284000	3286000	Then why even focus on the free-to-play thing?
3286000	3288000	They should have made that clear right away.
3288000	3290000	Like everything they've been saying, they need to be crystal clear.
3290000	3294000	Here's a great example of what happens when somebody doesn't stick to talking points.
3294000	3300000	Because I think somebody made a one-off comment about this to a press site.
3300000	3304000	And here we go, gaming industry, copy-paste, copy-paste, copy-paste, copy-paste.
3304000	3308000	It's free-to-play, free-to-play, free-to-play, free-to-play, based off one guy that went off the page.
3308000	3317000	And that's why you didn't see Microsoft doing a backpedaling or an about-face at E3.
3317000	3319000	There is not time to change the script.
3319000	3325000	Well, that's an even bigger reason why, again, canceling all those Q&As and so forth.
3325000	3332000	Also being pointed out in chat amongst the folks there that Rare is not making this game.
3332000	3334000	Which is a little bit surprising.
3334000	3336000	Somebody else is.
3336000	3339000	It's the people that made Silent Hill Homecoming.
3339000	3342000	Which wasn't a bad game.
3342000	3355000	I mean, okay, I have a special warm, fuzzy place in my heart for Killer Instinct because of the same reason I have a warm, fuzzy place in my heart for World Cup Soccer 94.
3355000	3361000	I mean, I played it, yeah, my first year of college. It was a big thing for me. It's what I spent all my time on.
3362000	3368000	And this new version, while I'm mildly interested in it, it doesn't seem like it's going to be...
3368000	3374000	It was about the only thing that they mentioned that made me perk up at all, and it was only for the nostalgia's sake.
3374000	3376000	And I don't think they can really bank on that.
3376000	3382000	Yeah, it's kind of one of those things where it's like, oh, I'd love to check it out if I was going to get an Xbox One, but I'm not going to right now.
3382000	3386000	Maybe I'll get an Xbox One in a year, and I think that's what will end up happening.
3386000	3393000	And to be fair, folks, I bought the 360 at launch, well, soon after launch, and I waited a year to get a PlayStation 3.
3393000	3395000	This is just that in reverse.
3395000	3400000	On the topic of that, you know, they redesigned the 360 to look like the Xbox One, and I think it's fucking ugly.
3400000	3403000	That console looks not good anymore.
3403000	3408000	I think we've, and I've talked about this before, I think we focus way too much on the looks of consoles.
3408000	3410000	It's not that big a deal.
3410000	3415000	Like, a lot of people were talking about the PlayStation 4 in its weird shape, and I'm just like, alright, so it's oddly shaped.
3415000	3417000	But here's the thing, though.
3417000	3421000	I like that it's vertical or horizontal again, and you can put it wherever you want. That's cool.
3421000	3427000	Yeah, here's the thing, though, is why would you redesign your current gen console to make it look like the Xbox One?
3427000	3432000	That's going to be confusing now, because people are going to say, hey, I saw that console on TV.
3432000	3434000	Which console is it? It's one of the Xboxes.
3434000	3438000	Oh, it's this one, and they get a 360, you know, because...
3438000	3440000	You don't think the name is right there on the front?
3441000	3451000	No, they're going to see the 360 with the new branding say, oh, that looks fun, and whoever's going to be selling them the system is going to point out the more expensive, newest one.
3453000	3458000	Anyhow. Yeah, the redesign is weird, but I'm kind of like, I just don't care.
3458000	3462000	Like, there's so much more to worry about with these consoles than the look.
3462000	3464000	And Rob, Betamax forever.
3464000	3466000	Whatever. Move on. Dark Saga.
3466000	3468000	Yeah, okay, I got other stuff.
3468000	3475000	Now, this one, it's a little bit more falls into the conspiracy theory part of...
3475000	3480000	I don't really know exactly how to think about it, but the first time I saw this article, it really made me raise my eyebrow.
3480000	3488000	It's an article of a guy named Jason. I'm trying to see what his full name is.
3489000	3501000	But he was basically at E3 taking photos of the Microsoft booth, or some of the gaming booths, and he took a picture of a laptop being hooked up.
3501000	3512000	And he got pulled aside and was told to delete the photo, which he actually went back and redrew, of basically the games running off of laptops and PCs.
3512000	3522000	Now, there was a big stink going on about this on the Game Facts board, which I was reading through, and they're saying, no, those can't be dev kits.
3522000	3535000	They are running off of Nvidia cards, which, as far as I was aware, the Nvidia GTX cards, which, as far as I was aware, wasn't supposed to be incorporated into the final system.
3535000	3541000	So they're saying that they weren't actually running off of the development PCs. These were running off of regular PCs.
3542000	3546000	And they even had the games crash the PCs.
3546000	3553000	Okay, that makes sense, because I was going to say, when you first brought this up, I'm like, alright, well, you know, having the consoles running off PCs isn't that big a deal.
3553000	3558000	I remember when the 360 was first shown, it was the same thing. Whatever, that's not a big deal.
3558000	3562000	But yeah, if you're talking about, they're like, really different, that's interesting.
3563000	3572000	I don't know, I kind of, I'm going to be honest, I think there is a real desire in the gaming community right now to just dogpile Microsoft.
3572000	3577000	Let's kick the bastards while they're down for daring to fuck with my used games. Beat them up.
3577000	3582000	But then again, Microsoft should have left that guy alone when he took the picture.
3582000	3585000	Well, here's the other thing. That threat on Game Facts is gone.
3585000	3589000	Well, I don't understand how they could say, you better delete that photo. I'd be like, you better fuck off.
3589000	3596000	Hold on, let me see if I can find it. Okay, a guard stood outside to keep me from freaking out and making a run for it.
3596000	3601000	A couple Microsoft PR folks came in, large four smiles on their faces, they just wanted to talk to me.
3601000	3606000	And then going, they made a big point of telling me they were not telling me to delete the photos.
3606000	3613000	That's because they really couldn't, since they never said what could or couldn't be photos, but they also didn't want me to leave that little room with those photos.
3614000	3615000	Share.
3616000	3621000	That's the news story here. Microsoft made a big deal out of something that shouldn't have been a big deal.
3621000	3624000	Now, here's just two more lines.
3624000	3630000	It was weird they were clearly unhappy and concerned, even though they insisted that laptop was just controlling looping video,
3630000	3635000	which it certainly may have been doing, which makes it even weirder that they were so upset at the photos.
3635000	3642000	Not being able to take their intense stares and restrained desire to yank the camera out of my hands any longer, I just deleted the photos.
3642000	3644000	Then they set me free.
3644000	3648000	He redrew the, and I'm actually, I'm going to go ahead and link this article for everybody.
3648000	3653000	It was on Gizmodo, actually the Australian Gizmodo site.
3653000	3657000	But I'm going to link it in the chatroom because it really is worth giving a good read over.
3657000	3660000	And he drew a copy of the photo.
3662000	3669000	It doesn't seem like it would be anything, but what makes it most suspicious is that they made a big stink out of it.
3669000	3675000	You know, if they had just said, oh, whatever, you know, it's sort of like when you tell the little kid they can't have something,
3675000	3679000	and then the kid thinks that that's something big and that they're going to sneak and get it.
3679000	3684000	It's that same type of thing. It makes it a bigger deal than what, you know, if it wasn't a big deal,
3684000	3688000	why are they trying to restrain this guy and browbeat him into deleting a photo?
3688000	3691000	I bet you the PS4s are running off PCs too.
3691000	3693000	Well, yeah, all the dev kits are PCs.
3693000	3700000	But if these aren't exactly the dev kits, if they are trying to run it off of a more beefed up system, then we have a problem.
3700000	3704000	Especially if they're saying that they're being run off of the system hardware.
3704000	3709000	It's a huge risk too, because if the game that comes out doesn't match what was played at E3,
3709000	3712000	the people that played at E3 are going to call it out.
3712000	3715000	It was Colonial Marines all over again.
3715000	3718000	But it's Gearbox not making the game, so they're okay, right?
3718000	3720000	I don't know.
3721000	3723000	Anyhow, let's move on.
3723000	3726000	Alright, so, hey, you want that Xbox One?
3726000	3734000	Well, you better be living in certain regions of the world, because it only supports a few different countries.
3734000	3743000	So at launch, if you're living in a good portion of Asia, well, you're fucked.
3743000	3768000	So basically, the only places, countries that you can access Xbox Live at launch are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and the US.
3768000	3770000	No Japan.
3770000	3771000	No Japan.
3771000	3780000	Even though the first developer up, Japanese developer, and I think the only Japanese developer that showed up at E3's press conference, which I also found interesting.
3780000	3788000	I found it very interesting who was at what press conference. Did you notice there was no EA at Sony's conference?
3788000	3794000	And that they were showing the 2K sports game instead. I just thought it was interesting. Just put it out there. I thought it was very interesting.
3794000	3796000	I think it's noteworthy.
3796000	3798000	Noted.
3798000	3800000	Noted, yeah.
3800000	3813000	Alright. What do you think though about the fact that they left Japan off? I mean, I think we all knew that Microsoft was going to write them off, but that, I mean a lot of great games come out of Japan.
3813000	3815000	It's a little weird to me.
3815000	3822000	But it seems like a lot of them, to me, it seems like they're willing to write off a lot of these people that would buy this console.
3822000	3829000	They're willing to write off Japan as a whole, even though there are some people that did buy the Xbox 360. They're willing to write off people that don't have good internet.
3829000	3836000	They're willing to write those people off. They're willing to write off, you know, people that are in the military. They have to write them off.
3836000	3839000	It's disrespect and being un-inclusive.
3839000	3852000	They're just like, too bad. You can't conform to what we want. So, hey, you guys, and I heard the argument from fanboys saying, well, hey, they had broadband internet on the original Xbox. That was the only way. No dial-up.
3852000	3863000	And people still bought it. Yeah, but you know what? It's a little different to, I don't know if it's an equal comparison because you can still play games offline with the original Xbox.
3863000	3867000	Well, I think IKUMA JP pretty much nailed it. We don't care now.
3867000	3876000	Well, it's just interesting to me because I realize, you know, and I see a lot of folks overall on chat are saying like, well, Microsoft gave up on Japan a long time ago, but I'm kind of like, okay.
3876000	3878000	Japan was ever really into Microsoft.
3878000	3886000	Well, but again, the first developer, first trailer to show up at the Microsoft thing, Japanese developers.
3886000	3896000	What was the biggest response at a Sony's press conference beside the whole, you know, going for the jugular Microsoft policy? Two games developed by a Japanese studio.
3896000	3901000	That happened to be coming to Microsoft system as well, but it wasn't really pointed out.
3901000	3908000	I thought it was interesting. Noted. Make a note. That's all.
3908000	3916000	Anyhow. Well, this isn't from a Japanese developer, but it certainly got a lot of people excited anyway.
3916000	3924000	It's a new Mirror's Edge game and, you know, a lot of people had a sad when it didn't show up at, you know, Microsoft's thing or whatever.
3924000	3930000	But then it showed up later, yay, at EA's press conference that a new Mirror's Edge game is in the works.
3930000	3936000	It is a reboot, actually, of the franchise, which, you know, is weird because there was only one game, so they're rebooting the one game.
3936000	3940000	But that's all right, you know. It's going to be open world this time.
3940000	3947000	And a nice little letter posted on the official Mirror's Edge site from DICE senior producer Sarah Jansen.
3947000	3953000	We introduced Mirror's Edge and Faith to gamers five years ago, and we've waited for the right moment to reunite them.
3953000	3958000	Thanks to the Frostbite engine, which a whole shit ton of those EA games are all running on.
3958000	3962000	That's like EA's bread and butter right now, is that Frostbite engine, if you think about it.
3962000	3970000	And a new generation of platforms. We are now able to deliver a richer world the players will be able to explore with a new level of freedom in both movement and action.
3970000	3974000	And a lot of people very excited about this. And, yeah, I'm curious, too.
3974000	3983000	You know, I didn't, like, love the first game, but I definitely respected it, and I'm looking forward to this reimagining of Mirror's Edge.
3983000	3985000	I am glad that it's multi-platform.
3985000	3987000	Mm-hmm, me too.
3987000	3991000	Very cool. Moving on, Dark Sakura and then release dates.
3991000	4000000	Well, we have, you know, we sort of made a mention of this, I think, a little bit earlier, but we like Minecraft, don't we?
4000000	4005000	I used to hate Minecraft. Now I love it. I don't play it on Xbox, which now I'm glad that I don't.
4005000	4008000	Yeah, you definitely don't play it on the VoG network server anymore.
4008000	4012000	Well, I did, but it wasn't always connecting.
4012000	4021000	Well, here is a really crappy thing for all of you Xbox Minecraft fans. Your save's not going to carry over to the Xbone.
4021000	4022000	Oops!
4022000	4024000	Yeah, I'm not surprised.
4024000	4033000	I'm getting the sense that it's, even though they're both Minecraft, they're still, like, separate games. That's kind of the sense I'm getting from this, you know?
4033000	4037000	They said that they were discussing it, but I don't think it's going to happen.
4037000	4046000	You know, they really do seem to be trying to put this wedge of separation in between the 360 and the bone.
4046000	4055000	I just don't really see that as an issue, just because it's just like, if you were to have, I don't know.
4055000	4065000	It would be hard because those features that are on the original version of Minecraft, like your worlds and stuff, are going to be locked into a certain size and stuff.
4065000	4071000	When you're putting in basically a redone engine, even though it is the same game, it's just not going to transfer over.
4071000	4080000	Just start anew. I mean, seriously, it's not that big a deal. I don't know. But, you know, once again, I think it's a whole dog-pile mentality.
4080000	4083000	But there are people who put a lot of time and effort into their crap on Minecraft.
4083000	4091000	Yeah, I mean, a game like Minecraft, I'm actually like, you know, a lot of people have created these huge things, and maybe Minecraft on Xbox One will fix some of the things.
4091000	4099000	Like, you know, you're not going to have the limits on the world size like 360. Yeah, maybe it's going to fix some of these things, but it would be nice if people could transfer their time and effort over.
4099000	4109000	I've seen people put a lot of effort into building some of the same monumental, ginormous creations on Xbox as they have to doing on a PC.
4109000	4112000	And it's a shame not to be able to carry that over.
4112000	4119000	I think part of what makes this noteworthy is that it shouldn't be that fucking hard. It's Minecraft. It's not that.
4119000	4120000	It's a Java game.
4121000	4129000	I know. It's not. I'm like, you know, I'm not belittling what a huge impact Minecraft has been on gaming and the heavy hitter that it is as far as the game is concerned.
4129000	4134000	But it doesn't seem like to me that it should be that big a fucking deal to transfer a save file over.
4134000	4135000	I don't think it should be at all.
4135000	4136000	Yeah.
4136000	4141000	Well, especially, is there any sort of cloud saving on Xbox? I haven't touched my Xbox in forever.
4141000	4142000	There is.
4142000	4144000	So they've got a cloud saving feature.
4144000	4145000	You're right.
4145000	4147000	Why shouldn't they be able to transfer things over via cloud?
4150000	4151000	Because it's a sad cloud.
4151000	4153000	It's not a happy little cloud.
4153000	4154000	It's a rain cloud.
4154000	4157000	It's a sad cloud that rains shit.
4157000	4161000	Speaking of the cloud, Brad from Pod Culture says,
4161000	4166000	Rob, I wonder how that DCU for the PS4 will tie in with the PS3 version or even if it will.
4166000	4171000	Check Bobby's answers at e3.vognetwork.com because I believe he came back.
4171000	4176000	Was it you or somebody else had asked a question very similar to that.
4176000	4184000	And I believe the response was it is that you will be able to log in and it's the same just with new textures
4184000	4188000	and, you know, everything you would expect from going up to the PlayStation 4.
4188000	4191000	It sounded like the right answer, actually.
4191000	4193000	I'll split it that way.
4193000	4194000	I think everything did transfer over.
4194000	4195000	Yeah.
4195000	4196000	All right.
4196000	4200000	Let's travel around the world and check out some games that are coming out a lot sooner than what we saw at e3.
4200000	4202000	Not a whole lot this week.
4202000	4204000	Actually, some Vita stuff.
4204000	4208000	Jak and Daxter Collection coming out on the Vita.
4208000	4216000	Also this week, Muramasa Rebirth coming out on Vita as well.
4216000	4222000	And then Game & Wario one week from today.
4222000	4224000	Nice.
4224000	4225000	Something for the Wii U.
4225000	4226000	Yeah.
4226000	4227000	Great.
4227000	4230000	Have you checked out The Last of Us yet?
4230000	4232000	I am hearing such amazing, amazing things about that game.
4232000	4233000	I really want to check it out.
4233000	4235000	I just don't care.
4235000	4236000	I mean, I don't know.
4236000	4238000	I just I don't really.
4238000	4239000	I'm not.
4239000	4240000	No.
4240000	4244000	Are you sure you're not going to be like like I originally was with Mass Effect where it's like, I'm not going to like this game.
4244000	4245000	I'm not going to like this game.
4245000	4248000	And then I play the game like the story is so fucking good, though.
4248000	4255000	It's just I don't really want to I don't want to start another game right now.
4255000	4256000	I'll tell you what, though.
4256000	4257000	Fair enough.
4257000	4258000	What?
4258000	4259000	This is a completely off topic here.
4260000	4262000	So Bobby got the information from it.
4262000	4267000	The Earth Defense Force 2025 is fucking coming out next year in 2014.
4267000	4271000	So, you know, that means you got to import the fucking version that's coming out in Japan in July.
4271000	4272000	Good.
4272000	4273000	Good job, Bobby.
4273000	4274000	I'm ruining Loki's day.
4274000	4278000	But as they mentioned, there are some digging.
4278000	4280000	The PlayStation 4 will be region free.
4280000	4281000	And here's the weird thing, though.
4281000	4286000	It's region free, both disc based game and digital games.
4286000	4289000	So that's not true.
4289000	4295000	I think right now on the PlayStation three, I think you can only buy stuff from certain regions, but apparently you can buy.
4295000	4302000	I don't know if you have to create another account like in that region, but that'd be kind of cool if I can buy like Japanese games or something.
4302000	4305000	Bobby Blackwell's in our chat room right now at live dog network dot com.
4305000	4308000	Wanting you to know he took a picture of the banner just for you, Loki.
4308000	4309000	It's all right.
4309000	4311000	They're going to be coming to our game summit in the end of July.
4311000	4317000	And I, you know, our rep over, you know, Phillips, say, justify, justify, justify.
4317000	4319000	She knows I'm a huge fan.
4319000	4320000	And it was last year.
4320000	4324000	Got some fly swatters based on insect Armageddon stuff.
4324000	4327000	So that's why I saw the play through insect Armageddon.
4327000	4329000	I got on one of those humble bundles or whatever.
4329000	4330000	So.
4330000	4331000	All right.
4331000	4338000	Let's talk about release dates in Japan and on the PlayStation three this week, a new dual shock controller in a gray color.
4338000	4341000	Also, The Last of Us making its way to Japan both on June 20th.
4341000	4347000	If for whatever reason, The Last of Us is not up your alley, try Dyson Ryaku.
4347000	4349000	I'm sorry, I said that wrong. Dyson Ryaku.
4349000	4351000	Daitoua Kobushi.
4351000	4355000	Tora Tora Tora Wara Kishuniseko Seri.
4355000	4357000	Yes, that is the full name of the game.
4357000	4359000	Regular and luxury editions.
4359000	4362000	You might have caught from the Tora Tora Tora in there.
4362000	4365000	It is a plane fight type game.
4365000	4366000	There you go.
4366000	4368000	I like that it's called a luxury edition.
4368000	4371000	That makes it seem regular and luxury.
4371000	4372000	It's luxurious.
4372000	4376000	Does it come wrapped in silk on the Xbox 360?
4376000	4380000	I will still cover releases on 360 in Japan as long as they're there.
4380000	4383000	Batman Arkham Twin Pack, a repackaging,
4383000	4388000	assumably of the two Batman games for Japanese audiences there.
4388000	4393000	That's probably like a price drop type of thing on the PlayStation Vita this week.
4393000	4394000	Quite a bit.
4394000	4397000	FIFA 13 World Class Soccer gets a price reduction.
4397000	4401000	I'm sorry, Winning Post 7 2013 comes out this week.
4401000	4402000	Also a new game.
4402000	4408000	Kami Jaigen Idol Neptune PP in limited and regular editions.
4408000	4411000	And I think this looks like some type of,
4411000	4414000	like it might be a music game.
4414000	4416000	I can't tell.
4416000	4421000	I think it's like a pop idol game.
4421000	4422000	Jamie, help me.
4422000	4424000	Do you recognize anything from these screenshots here?
4424000	4425000	Like what type of game this might be?
4425000	4427000	This seems to be the most telling one.
4427000	4429000	You see the little things with the patterns on them.
4429000	4430000	And it seems like maybe it's...
4430000	4432000	I've never, I don't know this one.
4432000	4433000	I don't know.
4433000	4434000	All right.
4434000	4435000	Sorry.
4435000	4436000	Maybe somebody in chat does.
4436000	4437000	What was the name again?
4437000	4439000	Kami Jaigen Idol Neptune PP.
4439000	4441000	No, I don't know that one.
4441000	4443000	Maybe Akuma JP or somebody in chat will know.
4443000	4444000	God Something Idol.
4444000	4445000	I don't know.
4445000	4448000	This is American Idol.
4448000	4450000	No Nicki Minaj in that game.
4450000	4452000	I did mention, I think that,
4452000	4454000	I mentioned this on Twitter actually,
4454000	4458000	cause Nintendo does some weird stuff with their,
4458000	4460000	their item numbers for their games.
4460000	4462000	And what was it for a new Luigi U?
4462000	4465000	It was PPRS is their item number.
4465000	4469000	That's the best.
4469000	4470000	So...
4470000	4471000	Sorry, Akuma is asking for a link.
4471000	4472000	So I just gave it to him.
4472000	4474000	Let me quickly do the other countries.
4474000	4475000	Sorry, Jamie.
4475000	4476000	I know you were ready to go there,
4476000	4478000	but I don't want to neglect the Wii U.
4478000	4479000	I was just going to comment on that game.
4479000	4480000	Oh, okay.
4480000	4481000	That you asked Akuma JP.
4481000	4483000	Oh, okay.
4483000	4485000	So on the Wii U this week, nothing,
4485000	4487000	but you do have F1 Race Stars powered up edition
4487000	4488000	to look forward to next week.
4488000	4489000	So there you go.
4489000	4491000	And lastly, on the 3DS this week,
4491000	4496000	Kuma Tomo and Ninja Jajamaru-kun Sakurahime
4496000	4500000	Tokaryu no Himitsu comes out from Hamster this week
4500000	4502000	on the Nintendo 3DS.
4502000	4505000	So I remember I asked you about like,
4505000	4510000	you know, the lack of F0 at, you know, E3 this year.
4510000	4512000	Are you at least excited that, you know,
4512000	4517000	kind of Mario Kart 8 is sort of F0?
4517000	4518000	Mm-hmm.
4518000	4520000	Slow 0?
4520000	4522000	Before we get to the UK releases,
4522000	4523000	some comments and chat on that game.
4523000	4524000	Queen Simea says,
4524000	4526000	Age of the Gods Idol Neptune?
4526000	4527000	And AlphaKananogram says,
4527000	4530000	Sky, I think it's related to that Neptunia video game system
4530000	4533000	slash company-based girls but idol game.
4533000	4535000	That actually seems like a very lot.
4535000	4537000	That seems like a much better thought out response
4537000	4538000	than what I said.
4538000	4541000	So we'll go with that until Akuma JP can translate for us.
4541000	4542000	All right.
4542000	4543000	Dark Sakura, what about the UK?
4543000	4544000	Two games.
4544000	4549000	Neverwinter on PC and New Super Luigi Brothers U.
4549000	4551000	When you first said Neverwinter,
4551000	4552000	I thought about Neverwinter Nights.
4552000	4553000	So did I.
4553000	4554000	And I looked at it and it's like, no.
4554000	4555000	And I'm like, oh wait, no,
4555000	4557000	there's that free-to-play Neverwinter that actually,
4557000	4558000	I get emails on that all the time.
4558000	4559000	That's it.
4559000	4560000	It looks exciting.
4560000	4561000	That is truly it.
4561000	4562000	No.
4562000	4565000	Sorry UK friends.
4565000	4566000	All right.
4566000	4567000	Just a couple more stories for you guys
4567000	4569000	in the classic game of the week.
4569000	4570000	Loki.
4570000	4573000	All right.
4573000	4575000	So let's see.
4575000	4580000	I guess with the Xbox 360,
4580000	4582000	a lot of people aren't really happy about the fact
4582000	4586000	that they kind of put their video services behind a paywall.
4586000	4588000	Well, with the PlayStation 4,
4588000	4590000	that's not going to be the case.
4590000	4592000	They're not going to kind of,
4592000	4594000	if you want to watch Netflix or something like that,
4594000	4597000	you don't have to have PlayStation Plus to do that.
4597000	4601000	You can actually just view all of their video services,
4601000	4603000	Netflix, Hulu, et cetera.
4603000	4605000	So that's kind of nice that they're doing that.
4605000	4607000	And free-to-play games, I guess,
4607000	4609000	aren't going to require PlayStation Plus,
4609000	4614000	but that's up to the publisher whether they do that or not.
4614000	4617000	So there's still a chance that they might.
4618000	4620000	I think that's kind of cool that they're doing that.
4620000	4623000	I think it's another selling point over Xbox One.
4623000	4626000	I hate to be one of those people dog-piling on Microsoft,
4626000	4628000	but it is what it is, guys.
4628000	4632000	Sony offering that for free does make that PlayStation 4
4632000	4637000	a slightly more attractive living room box for some people.
4637000	4641000	Again, the Xbox One integrated Skype thing is neat.
4641000	4644000	It's not $500 neat for me, but it's neat.
4644000	4647000	Something PS4 doesn't have, I guess.
4650000	4654000	Moving on to some sad news out of E3 for a lot of people,
4654000	4656000	and this is a boo at Sony.
4656000	4659000	So for those of you that are about to call me a Sony fanboy
4659000	4661000	after tonight's episode, nope.
4661000	4667000	Here's a negative for Sony and a big, hearty boo to Sony for this.
4667000	4669000	Jack Trenton talking to Game Trailers saying
4669000	4673000	The Last Guardian is, quote, on hiatus.
4674000	4678000	Further quote, we got so many projects out there from so many great teams.
4678000	4680000	Projects never ultimately go away.
4680000	4682000	So The Last Guardian is certainly not going away,
4682000	4685000	but it's on hiatus right now.
4685000	4688000	A lot of back and forth with this game, you know.
4688000	4691000	Lita a while ago said that the game was still in development,
4691000	4693000	but, you know, now it's not.
4693000	4695000	I heard that it was still in development, too.
4695000	4698000	They were just like, it was kind of confusing.
4698000	4701000	You know, this is just the new Final Fantasy versus XIII.
4701000	4702000	Or better yet, it's the new Duke Nukem Forever.
4702000	4705000	They're putting it out for PlayStation 4.
4705000	4707000	I think that's exactly what's happening,
4707000	4709000	is it's going to be a PlayStation 4 title,
4709000	4711000	and it's just taking its little time.
4711000	4713000	Maybe next year.
4713000	4714000	Maybe next year.
4714000	4716000	But in the meantime, instead of looking forward,
4716000	4720000	let's look back to a more classic time in video games history
4720000	4725000	with a segment we call The Classic Game of the Week.
4725000	4727000	Dark Soccer is going to reach into the gaming vault
4727000	4729000	and find a game that she thinks, hey, you ungrateful children
4729000	4732000	should be playing this game immediately.
4732000	4734000	Right now, break out your Neo Geo.
4734000	4736000	You got a good one this week, Dark Soccer.
4736000	4737000	What is the classic game?
4737000	4739000	I have to do my quote from the anime of this,
4739000	4742000	because the dub was so awful.
4742000	4744000	Feel the storm, it's coming.
4744000	4746000	Yeah, Dan actually quotes that all the time,
4746000	4748000	because my husband is a dork.
4748000	4750000	It's from Fatal Fury.
4750000	4756000	Fatal Fury was the series that pretty much led into King of Fighters, you know.
4756000	4762000	In fact, the first Fatal Fury was called Garo Densetsu, the King of Fighters.
4762000	4766000	So the very first game, well, as it came out over here, actually,
4766000	4768000	it was Fatal Fury, King of Fighters.
4768000	4774000	It came out for the arcade, of course, for Neo Geo CD, Mega Drive.
4774000	4778000	It came out on the Sharp computer, the SNES, the PS2, Virtual Console.
4778000	4779000	It's been on everything.
4779000	4785000	And of course, it spawned its better known sequels, Fatal Fury 2 and Fatal Fury Special.
4785000	4788000	There was also Fatal Fury 3, Road to the Final Victory,
4788000	4791000	a Real Bout Fatal Fury, Real Bout Fatal Fury Special,
4791000	4794000	Real Bout Fatal Fury to the newcomers.
4794000	4797000	There was a Real Bout Garo Densetsu Special,
4797000	4801000	Dominated Mind, Fatal Fury Wild Ambition, Fatal Fury First Contact,
4801000	4805000	and Garo Mark of the Wolves, which is probably my favorite in the series,
4805000	4807000	because it was pretty badass.
4807000	4813000	So anyway, with these games, the big mechanic that these fighting games brought in is that,
4813000	4815000	well, for the first one, you could only play three characters.
4815000	4818000	You had Terry Bogard, you had Andy Bogard, and Joe Higashi,
4818000	4824000	who had to fight against some of the bad guys coming up in their way.
4824000	4831000	The thing about this one is that it had sort of this multi-plane type of setting,
4831000	4837000	where you could dodge moves by jumping from the foreground to the background and vice versa.
4837000	4846000	And as these evolved in later versions, it even had, I think it was on Fatal Fury 3?
4846000	4853000	Yeah, it was. Fatal Fury 3, you could actually throw your enemies into the back platform
4853000	4860000	or into the front, running directly pretty much into the crowd as a special ending move.
4860000	4865000	I remember in the aquarium level, you could throw somebody into the aquarium,
4865000	4869000	and they'd just crack the glass and slump to the floor.
4869000	4876000	So yeah, it was a really neat series, and like I said, it gave us the King of Fighters series,
4876000	4882000	which I'm sure as a lot of people know is probably one of my favorite fighting game series altogether.
4882000	4888000	I myself have two of them on Neo Geo, which if you can play them on the Neo Geo, just do that,
4888000	4893000	because that is the way to play any type of SNK game.
4893000	4899000	As far as the series goes, it actually had a sister series that was called Art of Fighting,
4899000	4906000	that was set in exactly the same universe, so it was why a lot of the characters crossed over.
4906000	4909000	Quick question, was World Heroes in that same universe?
4909000	4913000	I do not think World Heroes was, because none of the characters in World Heroes showed up in King of Fighters.
4913000	4916000	Okay, I thought there was another series where they started showing up in King of Fighters,
4916000	4917000	but I guess that wasn't World Heroes, was it?
4917000	4922000	Because as I started combining those universes, keep in mind that they threw in the Ikari Warriors universe.
4922000	4923000	Oh, yeah.
4923000	4925000	They threw in Psycho Soldier.
4925000	4929000	I kind of lost track of this. I like Fatal Fury a lot, actually, at the time.
4929000	4933000	Not so much the original, although I understand why it's worthy of the Classic Game of the Week,
4933000	4935000	but more like Special probably was my big one.
4935000	4939000	Fatal Fury Special was, I think, the one that I saw in the arcades most.
4939000	4945000	But, I mean, it gave us my Shiranui and her boobs.
4945000	4951000	Which, such a big outcry about the character, I thought she was hilarious.
4951000	4958000	She also was probably my favorite to play in that game next to Kim Kap Wan later on.
4958000	4960000	Kim Kap Wan was my favorite.
4960000	4967000	Yeah, because, well, although if you're really good with Joe Higashi, you could apparently just smack anybody down because it was awesome.
4967000	4972000	Although I've seen a perfect playthrough, actually, I think this is an example of a perfect playthrough with Andy Bogard.
4973000	4986000	Really, all of the characters, in my opinion, were so well-balanced that if you knew them inside and out, you could really destroy anybody in this game.
4986000	4990000	I mean, yeah, you had your good masher characters.
4990000	4992000	I mean, yeah, I think that Mai was a masher character.
4992000	4994000	Yuri was a masher character.
4994000	5001000	I mean, she has a lot of charge moves, but Yuri was a major masher character, especially with her flying butt powers.
5003000	5015000	But for the most part, you know, it gave us such a huge list of characters, too, that, like I said, carried over into King of Fighters.
5015000	5023000	Like, even Ryo Sakazaki was in two of the Fatal Fury games, who was an Art of Fighting character.
5023000	5035000	On top of that, this is the game that also, I mean, basically leading into Art of Fighting gave us one of our first big multi-game crossovers.
5035000	5043000	Which, I mean, now we have a versus series now, I think pretty much because of Fatal Fury and it leading into the King of Fighters series.
5043000	5055000	You know, King of Fury, King of Fighters was pretty much Art of Fighting and Fatal Fury mixed with a few other SNK games.
5055000	5059000	But that was our first big versus thing and led us into...
5059000	5066000	Yeah, Capcom versus SNK 2, which wouldn't have been possible without these games, is probably like my favorite 2D fighter ever, which I'm sure a lot of people feel that way.
5066000	5070000	And a lot of people want to say that it's, you know, the X-Men versus Street Fighter and all that.
5070000	5078000	No, no, no, no. It started with KOF. I really think it started with KOF, which, like I said, came from Fatal Fury.
5078000	5086000	And even in the Fatal Fury universe with Art of Fighting, Art of Fighting led to everybody's favorite joke character, Dan Hibiki.
5086000	5091000	Because it was a combination, his dad was supposed to be like a parody of Mr. Karate.
5091000	5098000	And then he was, what was it, Robert Garcia and Ryo combined.
5098000	5104000	Tung-Fu-Ruu was so badass. I'm looking at the video right now where this guy is fighting Tung-Fu-Ruu. That guy was awesome.
5104000	5109000	You know who else I was pretty good with? Duck King. Just because he was so hilarious.
5109000	5116000	But yeah, and I'm not going to go into any more about the gameplay, because honestly, King of...
5116000	5122000	I'm not going to go back to King of Fighters. Fatal Fury was pretty generic as far as you have punches, you have special moves,
5122000	5128000	you have super moves. In the later games you built up meters, you had combos, you had all of the same stuff.
5128000	5141000	But this one, the thing that really set it apart was that multi-plane fighting and the fact that it gave birth to an entire lineage of fighting games right after that.
5141000	5148000	So I'm going to go for the whole Fatal Fury series just because of what came from it.
5148000	5155000	And again, my favorite in the series is Garo Densetsu because I like playing as a rock coward.
5155000	5156000	Classic Game of the Week.
5156000	5157000	And Blue Mary.
5157000	5161000	Classic Game of the Week. Fatal Fury for the Neo Geo. Great pick.
5161000	5165000	Again, another one of those picks you go, how many weeks have you done a Classic Game of the Week?
5165000	5168000	About 300 weeks now and somehow this never came up before?
5168000	5171000	How many different games have we had that happen with?
5171000	5172000	Daytona.
5172000	5173000	Daytona.
5173000	5174000	It's always funny. It's always funny.
5174000	5179000	You didn't do Fatal Fury Special or Fatal Fury 2 one week?
5179000	5180000	I looked.
5180000	5181000	Wow. Alright.
5181000	5187000	Then again, I didn't look under Garo Densetsu but I figured that if anyone was putting it down there they would have done either.
5187000	5189000	The Wiki people are pretty good about that.
5189000	5191000	Alright, we've got plenty more to come in Part B tonight.
5191000	5195000	Fugu Question of the Week and more news, even stuff that's not just E3.
5195000	5201000	Your emails and yes, your phone calls when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
5203000	5209000	Orange Lounge Radio
5209000	5216000	Hi there, this is Elliott B and you're participating with Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.
5216000	5223000	And I want to use my voice to tell you that Donkey Kong Country 2 is the best game ever released on the Super Nintendo.
5223000	5229000	It has musical apes, fighting reptilian pirates, what more could you ask for?
5230000	5233000	Oh, I don't know, maybe a new Metroid instead, just saying.
5233000	5235000	Just saying, throwing it out there, no.
5235000	5237000	Thank you very much to Elliott for leaving that bumper.
5237000	5239000	I really appreciate it there.
5239000	5242000	If you want to leave a bumper for us, more information available on our forum.
5242000	5248000	The VOG Network forums, vognetwork.com and just look for the word forums at the top of the screen.
5248000	5249000	It's not that hard to find.
5249000	5252000	I appreciate Elliott taking the time to leave that for us.
5252000	5259000	And yeah, it kind of reminds me to say something I didn't say in the first part of the show about the Donkey Kong reveal.
5259000	5263000	Which I realize has people like Elliott probably very excited.
5263000	5271000	For me, I was like, I just bought a Donkey Kong game on 3DS literally weeks ago and now they're announcing another.
5271000	5277000	Now I realize the one on 3DS is a little different, but I was kind of like, I feel like Donkey Kong Overload.
5277000	5278000	I could have gone for a new Metroid.
5278000	5284000	It doesn't look that different, aside from, oh now the barrels will shoot you into the background.
5284000	5287000	It's not exactly just 2D.
5287000	5290000	To be fair though, those games are rock solid platformers.
5290000	5295000	They're super fun and that's where I think that success is going to be in.
5295000	5298000	No, I don't doubt it will be successful.
5298000	5301000	TigerConChat says, Rob, actually I want a new Star Fox.
5301000	5302000	That would be good.
5302000	5304000	And not that adventure is bullshit either, but that would be good.
5304000	5306000	A new Star Fox would be good.
5306000	5308000	But nothing would top a new F-Zero.
5308000	5315000	Maybe after this Mario Kart 8 thing, which does look good, maybe we can get that as our racing game for 2014.
5315000	5317000	A man can dream.
5317000	5318000	A man can dream.
5318000	5321000	I also want to make sure we say at some point tonight a Happy Father's Day.
5321000	5326000	I know we were busy talking about E3 in the beginning there, but let us not forget it is Father's Day.
5326000	5329000	So Happy Father's Day to all the father or fatherly figures out there.
5329000	5331000	Especially our own Loki.
5332000	5337000	Is Josh at the age where he can kind of recognize Father's Day yet?
5337000	5338000	No.
5338000	5339000	And wish you a happy one?
5339000	5340000	No.
5340000	5341000	Not quite?
5341000	5342000	No.
5342000	5343000	Alright.
5343000	5344000	Well, maybe next time.
5344000	5349000	If my BFF is listening, then tell Chris I said Happy Father's Day.
5349000	5350000	There you go.
5350000	5353000	And tell Julian to clean his room to be nice.
5353000	5358000	I'll wish Alan a Happy Father's Day because Sanrio the kitty is very well taken care of.
5358000	5361000	And he sends me videos when I'm out of town and everything.
5361000	5363000	Even though she was very antisocial.
5363000	5364000	Big floof ball.
5364000	5367000	I still need to get a good picture of her to put on the interwebs.
5367000	5371000	Well, is Alan ever going to come over here and talk to me about what he thought about E3 and all this stuff?
5371000	5374000	Oh, we finally had the comment in chat, by the way.
5374000	5376000	Who that is? My baby daddy.
5376000	5377000	Yay, putting him on the spot.
5377000	5378000	Hi, Alan. Long time, no talk.
5378000	5379000	Hello.
5379000	5380000	Welcome to the show.
5380000	5381000	Thank you.
5381000	5383000	Do you have anything you want to plug while you're here?
5383000	5386000	Everyone's saying that Microsoft killed Sony.
5386000	5392000	Or sorry, Sony killed Microsoft at E3, but more like Microsoft killed themselves and then Sony just showed up with pizza and a bag of weed.
5395000	5398000	Why y'all mad and sad? We got good shit here.
5400000	5403000	I asked you if you had anything you wanted to plug and that was your answer.
5403000	5406000	It was essentially pizza and weed, but that's alright.
5406000	5410000	What? I don't run any shows. What would I plug?
5411000	5416000	You listen to other people's shows more than you listen to mine. Do you want to plug The Nerdist?
5416000	5419000	You know what? I'm all for the Alan show. Alan needs his own show.
5419000	5422000	Alan does need his own show, but he's a little shy. Would you do your own show, Alan?
5422000	5423000	No.
5423000	5428000	See? He wouldn't do it. He just walks on here, gives his witty commentary, and then leaves.
5428000	5431000	Any other observations about this year's E3?
5431000	5439000	There's a lot of really bad misinformation about the Xbox One, and I kind of feel bad for Microsoft even though they've brought it on themselves
5439000	5443000	because all the made-up shit about their console is completely believable, even if it's not true.
5443000	5446000	Oh, like the whole it's only launching in 21 states thing?
5446000	5455000	Well, there's the 21 country IP address thing, but no, there was that post about if your account is banned,
5455000	5460000	all of your licenses, even if it's attached to a physical disk, are deactivated, which is not true,
5460000	5467000	but that super fits into what they're legitimately doing, that it's super easy to believe something like that.
5467000	5470000	It's everybody dogpiling on Microsoft. Let's kick them while they're down.
5470000	5474000	How dare they implement these DRMs? Kick, kick, punch, punch.
5474000	5482000	Yeah, at the end of the console cycle that they're not going to shut off the servers, but that's years away.
5482000	5486000	Yeah, and I didn't know either. I just found this out yesterday.
5486000	5491000	The 24-hour ping to make sure that your shit works, the internet connectivity.
5491000	5498000	If you're playing your game at a friend's house under your account, it pings once an hour because it's not your console.
5498000	5500000	It's a mess.
5500000	5507000	And just so you know, Alan at live.vognetwork.com, let's see, rostielut agrees with you in part.
5507000	5509000	Sony really only needed to show up.
5509000	5511000	Misty says, I approve of an Alan show.
5511000	5516000	SSU100Matt says, Alan has plenty of drop the mic moments.
5516000	5519000	Because I'm the best.
5519000	5523000	Drop. All right, anything else quickly before we say bye and get into rapid fire news?
5523000	5525000	Sanrio is shy.
5525000	5528000	Yeah, she is. She's a good kitty though.
5528000	5531000	All right, let's get into rapid fire news, Loki.
5531000	5541000	All right. So, one of the things that they talked about during the Microsoft press conference is that they're going to be getting rid of the Microsoft points.
5541000	5546000	So, how's that going to work now that I have Microsoft points? How's that going to convert?
5546000	5551000	Well, they're just going to convert it over. They're going to take your space bucks and make them into actual bucks.
5551000	5557000	So, in North America, 80 points or less to the dollar will exchange to that dollar.
5557000	5569000	However, there is one little bullet point on there or asterisk, I guess, that when they do convert those into actual dollars, they must be spent within a year.
5569000	5576000	Otherwise, you lose them, which is bullshit if you ask me.
5576000	5581000	But then be the, you know, terms, I guess.
5581000	5583000	That's kind of bullshit, I agree.
5583000	5591000	But hopefully I didn't have enough left in my account where, you know, I'll buy one Xbox Live Arcade game and that's it.
5591000	5598000	I still got 20 bucks because I tried buying a game for 20 bucks and it took money off my credit card instead of using the points that I already had.
5598000	5599000	Thank you.
5599000	5610000	It's funny as I got two points cards for my birthday and I've only used one of them so that I could play stuff on rock band so that I could sing Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots.
5610000	5611000	Thank you.
5611000	5619000	So now I think I'm just going to buy all the Mass Effect gear for my character, even though I don't touch it on the Xbox.
5619000	5630000	Alright, another cool announcement is Twitch was saying that, you know, because they have a partnership with the Xbox One where it's going to be integrated in there so you can stream the Twitch.
5630000	5643000	But it's also got this software development kit that actually will allow anybody to integrate it into their consoles to broadcast from any platform, including PlayStation 4 if they really wanted to.
5643000	5645000	Wasn't the Ouya supposed to be getting a Twitch thing too?
5646000	5652000	Ouya already has, it's a Twitch viewer. Basically it's an app that you can view Twitch streams on.
5652000	5655000	Ouya is probably not powerful enough to broadcast, I'm sorry.
5655000	5656000	No.
5656000	5665000	That's actually what I was thinking of because I think of the Twitch 360 app, I think of a viewer only, and I keep forgetting that this new console generation, oh no, it will broadcast as well.
5665000	5671000	I don't think, yeah, I don't think it has enough power to do that, so whatever.
5672000	5676000	But yeah, it's going to be cool that they can integrate this into a bunch of stuff.
5676000	5684000	So I think it's very possible that we'll see that coming to, you know, the PlayStation 4 because they have Ustream and that's kind of like...
5684000	5694000	I think a little competition is healthy though, even though I don't particularly care for the way Ustream, I think the Nintendo Press, or Nintendo Direct through Ustream kind of says it all about Ustream.
5694000	5698000	I think a little competition is healthy. I'd like to see more options than just Twitch out there.
5698000	5699000	Yeah.
5700000	5705000	And last but not least, of course, they were talking about Summer of Arcade.
5705000	5712000	It's coming August 7th and will include such titles as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows.
5712000	5718000	Also a remake or reboot, if you will, of Flashback, the old 1992 classic.
5718000	5721000	Brother is a Tale of Two Sons.
5721000	5726000	And Charlie Murder, which is being done by the guys that did the Dishwasher game.
5727000	5729000	So that should be good.
5731000	5737000	And of course, no word if they're still doing that deal where you buy all the games and get money back type thing, any pricing.
5737000	5738000	Or free games.
5738000	5740000	Or free games, so we'll have to wait.
5741000	5745000	Alright, I got some news real quick. One of them about the game Ultima Forever.
5745000	5750000	Don't get too excited, it's not really a PC game, it's that iOS game, the Ultima iOS game that's being made.
5750000	5754000	Some of the currency was really balanced this week.
5754000	5760000	It's out in Canada because their EA tends to beta a lot of this type of stuff in Canada and then they release it in the US.
5761000	5765000	How does that make our Canadian listeners feel that they're beta testers for this?
5765000	5767000	Well, whatever, at least you're getting to play it.
5767000	5771000	But they did some really big change with some of the currency prices.
5771000	5780000	Apparently, in the game you have to repair items and it used to cost like 60 keys to repair certain items, so they've lowered that to like 8 to 10.
5780000	5785000	And increasing storage space in your stash was lowered and so on and so on.
5785000	5790000	So they're trying to not make it so crazy, I guess, where you're going to feel like you're forced to buy things.
5790000	5797000	However, the highest quality chests, they went up in price as part of this balancing, so I guess not everything was a win.
5798000	5802000	Interesting talk out there about the new Zelda game.
5802000	5805000	Look, we all know there's going to be a new Zelda game.
5805000	5809000	It will probably be the big thing that Nintendo shows in 2014.
5809000	5812000	But the producer of the series said something interesting this week.
5812000	5817000	Eiji Aonuma said this week that he's a big fan of Skyrim.
5817000	5820000	And this is very interesting.
5820000	5825000	So he was asked if he was looking at any other titles for inspiration for the new Zelda game.
5825000	5827000	He said, Skyrim.
5827000	5831000	Obviously, I play other games and I'm curious what Zelda fans like about the Skyrim experience.
5831000	5834000	Maybe there are some Zelda fans who are looking for something similar out of a Zelda game.
5834000	5837000	But I don't look at the technology that made these games possible.
5837000	5839000	I don't look at what's happening in the game, but how it made me feel.
5839000	5844000	What in the game moved me and how I can bring out those same emotions to players who play my games.
5844000	5848000	My intent isn't to copy them, but those are the things that stay with you as a player.
5848000	5851000	It's not what you see about the game that makes you feel...
5851000	5853000	Excuse me.
5853000	5857000	It's not what you see, but how the game makes you feel that makes you feel closer to the experience.
5857000	5860000	It's more about the feeling and expression of emotions in the game.
5860000	5863000	And I do take that into consideration when working on my own projects.
5864000	5868000	So, could Link be taking the arrow to the knee in the next installment?
5868000	5869000	Alright, no. Obviously, it's not...
5869000	5870000	I think open world is what they're...
5870000	5873000	Well, actually, most of the games are open world, so...
5873000	5876000	Yeah, I'm thinking, too, like, you know, maybe a lot of the...
5876000	5880000	In Skyrim, you tend to really be able to interact with everything.
5880000	5882000	Maybe that's part of it, too.
5882000	5885000	Maybe building more side quests. I don't know. It could be interesting.
5885000	5888000	I always thought, you know how in Wind Waker, how there...
5888000	5889000	Well, spoiler.
5889000	5892000	There's a portion of it where you go under the sea.
5892000	5894000	And you see, under the sea.
5894000	5896000	You see the 3D world that's down there.
5896000	5899000	And I'm like, why wasn't this Wind Waker?
5899000	5901000	Because that would have been amazing.
5901000	5905000	So, I'm hoping that it's something like that, but, you know, better graphics.
5907000	5913000	Did they maybe include that in the remake of Wind Waker HD?
5922000	5926000	Life under the sea is better than anything they got up there.
5926000	5929000	To seaweed is always greener.
5929000	5931000	Everything looks better in HD.
5931000	5932000	You dream of...
5932000	5933000	Alright, forget it.
5933000	5935000	Also, something else about Nintendo.
5935000	5937000	Retro is actually coming out.
5937000	5940000	Funny, we had that discussion earlier in the show.
5940000	5944000	Retro saying that it was hard to decide between Metroid and Donkey Kong.
5944000	5946000	You made the wrong choice. Just saying.
5946000	5949000	I'm just kidding. Alright, Donkey Kong fans, put your torches down.
5949000	5951000	Put your torches down.
5951000	5955000	I think that was just kind of an off-the-cusp comment that Michael Kelbaugh,
5955000	5957000	who's the president and CEO of Retro Studios,
5957000	5962000	told the official Nintendo magazine via Twitter between the two.
5962000	5966000	I'm sure the Metroid game will happen sometime this generation.
5966000	5968000	It's just not right now.
5968000	5971000	Also, what I found interesting about the new Super Mario 3D world,
5971000	5973000	I think what a lot of people are very excited about is that
5973000	5976000	the Mario and Luigi characters that are in the game
5976000	5980000	play like they do in Super Mario 2 on the NES.
5980000	5982000	And if you think about it, we haven't really seen a game
5982000	5986000	implement the characterization of those characters since that game.
5986000	5988000	You know, with Peach floating and all that.
5988000	5990000	So that was really cool that they brought that back.
5990000	5994000	Well, Peach wasn't originally planned as a playable character in Mario 3D World.
5994000	5997000	Because you know in the last few games, it's been Mario, Luigi, and the two totes.
5997000	6000000	Because female protagonists do not sell games.
6000000	6002000	Really?
6002000	6006000	Obviously, he said that with his tongue firmly planted in cheek.
6006000	6011000	Well, you know, Nintendo got a lot of kudos this week for announcing
6011000	6013000	some really awesome female characters.
6013000	6018000	Not just Peach, but the Wii Fit Trainer as a character in Super Smash Bros.
6018000	6021000	I thought that was cool, and I'm glad that there were no rape jokes
6021000	6023000	during their presentation of Smash Bros.
6023000	6025000	That's a whole other Oprah.
6025000	6027000	Alright, anyhow.
6027000	6030000	And he's referring to what happened to the Microsoft thing if you didn't know.
6030000	6036000	Anyhow, a comment from Yoshiaki Koizumi said,
6036000	6039000	quote, I think she adds a lot of the sense of completion
6039000	6041000	when you get in multiplayer.
6041000	6043000	You can have different people choosing different characters
6043000	6045000	based on their personality or whoever they like.
6045000	6048000	And Princess Peach is just really a lot of fun to play.
6048000	6051000	But yeah, Peach was not originally a playable character in the game.
6051000	6056000	Which means the plot isn't that they're rescuing her for a change.
6056000	6059000	So that's good, I think.
6059000	6061000	And hell, I like playing as Princess Peach.
6061000	6063000	That float ability is badass.
6063000	6067000	She's kind of actually like way better than the others
6067000	6068000	because of that ability.
6068000	6070000	But maybe this game will be more balanced than Mario 2 was.
6070000	6072000	We'll see.
6072000	6073000	Dark Sakura.
6073000	6075000	Oh, my iPad just completely crashed on me.
6075000	6076000	Give me a second.
6076000	6077000	Oh, hooray.
6077000	6078000	I know.
6078000	6081000	All that porn, you know, Rob.
6081000	6083000	It's crashing our show.
6083000	6086000	So coming out is going to be Pac-Man Museum Collection.
6086000	6091000	It's going to be on various different digital releases.
6091000	6097000	It's supposed to include the Championship Edition and Pac-Man Battle Royale.
6097000	6102000	And it's going to be on Xbox Live Arcade, PSN, PC, 3DS, and the Wii U eShop.
6102000	6105000	So that is going to be super awesome cool.
6105000	6109000	Which is funny because I was playing Super Pac-Man just the other day.
6109000	6113000	And then also a trademark in the US is Contra Run and Gun.
6114000	6121000	It's a – well, they did tease a new Contra at E3 in 2011.
6121000	6123000	But now we actually have a trademark to go with it.
6123000	6132000	And last but not least, the inspiration for our Neil before VOG logo that went a while back.
6132000	6134000	Which not a lot of people got, unfortunately.
6134000	6135000	It was our teaser.
6135000	6137000	But maybe now that there's a movie out, which I want to see.
6137000	6138000	You want to see the new movie, The Man of Steel?
6138000	6139000	I want to see that.
6139000	6142000	Becky went and saw it today and said it was okay, but the end of it took forever.
6142000	6143000	Hmm, interesting.
6143000	6146000	So anyway – oh, thank you, Geico ad for running.
6146000	6153000	Anyway, so for Injustice Gods Among Us, a new character is going to be added and it is Zod.
6153000	6156000	Neil before Zod, son of Jor-El.
6156000	6158000	Which better be said in the movie.
6158000	6160000	He better freaking – yeah.
6160000	6162000	I don't want spoilers in chat.
6162000	6164000	I will slap you with a trout if you spoil.
6164000	6166000	If you spoil, we spank.
6166000	6168000	All right.
6168000	6172000	Let's get to the foogle question of the week.
6172000	6176000	Every week we ask a question on our Facebook and Google Plus communities.
6176000	6181000	Slam it together and you get foogle.
6181000	6183000	This week's question was all about E3.
6183000	6185000	Because, you know, that's what every show wants to know.
6185000	6187000	What did you think about E3, right?
6187000	6190000	But we put a little twist on it.
6190000	6195000	Because, you know, everybody's talking about the freaking consoles and the whole, you know,
6195000	6197000	everything we talked about in the first 30 minutes of the show tonight.
6197000	6201000	So I want to say, what were you excited about that maybe other people missed?
6201000	6203000	So that was the question.
6203000	6205000	We'd like to know your thoughts on E3, but with a twist.
6205000	6208000	You can't talk about the big press conferences or the new consoles.
6208000	6211000	I know, I know, but there will be plenty of other time on tonight's show to talk about all that.
6211000	6216000	We're looking for what you were excited to hear about that maybe slipped off someone else's radar
6216000	6222000	amongst all the Sony versus Microsoft press conference with a side of Nintendo Direct chatter.
6222000	6223000	So let's get to some of the answers.
6223000	6226000	I'll start with Google Plus tonight, because I haven't been starting with them a lot lately,
6226000	6228000	so I want to show them some love.
6228000	6232000	ActDeft on Google Plus says, well, this technically counts as one of the big announcements,
6232000	6235000	but I'm hyped to see a new Mirror's Edge in the works.
6235000	6236000	I'll let it slide.
6236000	6241000	Hopefully the wait won't be as long and the game will be great as the first one, if not more.
6241000	6243000	Deft, I'm going to say 2014.
6243000	6246000	It's definitely not, they're not talking like it's 2013 game.
6246000	6248000	It's not 2013.
6248000	6251000	Flaco Jones says, I was excited to see gameplay from the enemy within.
6251000	6255000	If they keep to their word and go back to the roots of what makes survival horror great,
6255000	6257000	then it should be an awesome experience.
6257000	6259000	Yeah, that was a comment from Bethesda coming through.
6259000	6265000	One of the first things on the E3.MOG network experience was that they are going back to survival horror roots
6265000	6266000	with the enemy within.
6266000	6269000	I heard that it's supposed to be really, really gross.
6269000	6272000	Yay, gross games, except not really.
6272000	6277000	I don't like gross games, but I know there are other people that are into the gross games, so enjoy it.
6277000	6280000	Going to some of the responses on Facebook.
6280000	6287000	James S says, I feel like the game Killer is Dead might be the one that a lot of people didn't see anything on,
6287000	6290000	but it's definitely a current gen title that people should be checking out.
6290000	6296000	It looks pretty damn awesome and it's one of the very few current gen titles that are coming out during the remainder of this year.
6296000	6299000	Also, Dark Souls 2, need I say more?
6299000	6303000	Sadly, I don't think it's going to do very well because it comes out right at the same time as Splinter Cell
6303000	6309000	and Saints Row and Madden and...
6309000	6311000	I think there's an audience for it.
6311000	6317000	As long as we can still get that mod on the PC version that instead of whenever you get you died,
6317000	6319000	when you die it goes, thanks Obama.
6319000	6321000	Have you heard about that hack?
6321000	6322000	What?
6322000	6325000	You know the thanks Obama meme, right?
6325000	6330000	Well, somebody made a hack for Dark Souls where every time you die,
6330000	6335000	instead of it coming up saying you died in the big dramatic text, it comes up and says, thanks Obama.
6335000	6337000	It's funny.
6337000	6339000	It's funny.
6339000	6344000	All right, Clerical Error 404, one of the peeps from Koopa Club.
6344000	6348000	By the way, I'm supposed to be going on that show in the near future, so stay tuned for that.
6348000	6353000	The Clerical Error 404 says, there were a number of games that were announced that I was excited to hear about.
6353000	6357000	Mirrors Edge 2, Super Mario 3D World, because you can play as Peach in the cat suits,
6358000	6362000	Super Smash Brothers for the 3DS version and the additional characters, Kingdom Hearts 3, duh.
6362000	6366000	I wasn't happy with the announcement of the direction that Metroid is planning to take,
6366000	6371000	basically expanding on the characters of the universe and making a gallery of other bounty hunters besides Samus.
6371000	6374000	And why no new 2D cel-shaded Castlevania?
6374000	6376000	I know a pipe dream, but still.
6376000	6378000	All right.
6378000	6383000	Haseo Sumeruwagawa says, Mirrors Edge 2, my boyfriend and I are so excited,
6383000	6387000	but I'm also excited for Kingdom Hearts 3 and Final Fantasy XIV and XV.
6387000	6393000	Burr says, I'm a bit excited about what I saw of the new Sonic game, Lost World.
6393000	6398000	I know I'm probably in for a letdown, but Sonic Generations was a bit of a surprise, so this could be too.
6398000	6401000	Mason D, I love this answer. This is so win.
6401000	6406000	The thing most out of E3, Miyamoto likes In-N-Out Burger, confirmed,
6406000	6410000	with the picture of Miyamoto at the In-N-Out truck that was in the parking lot at E3.
6410000	6414000	I kept seeing that popping up all over Facebook. It was hilarious.
6414000	6416000	That is great, though.
6416000	6419000	Ronnie B says, The Mirrors Edge reboot is all I care about.
6419000	6424000	I think it's extremely impressive EA of all companies managed to seemingly keep everything in its original format.
6424000	6428000	I hope they don't nickel and dime the game to death, though, otherwise it looks impressive like the first.
6428000	6432000	I hope the music is equally respected. A lot of love for that new Mirrors Edge game.
6432000	6434000	The trailer music was awesome.
6434000	6438000	Clover N says, The Metal Gear Solid V trailer looks absolutely amazing.
6438000	6443000	I hope the controls, for the most part, don't stray too far from the controls of the past Metal Gear Solid games.
6443000	6447000	That was a hell of a way to start off the Microsoft conference.
6447000	6452000	Say what you will about what went down there, but that was a great kickoff.
6452000	6459000	Rageinator says, I was excited to hear about Killer Instinct, one of my favorite fighter series from back in the day, being brought back from the dead.
6459000	6465000	I was also kind of hoping for some major E3 flubs that would become memes akin to Sony's 2006 presser.
6465000	6469000	Well, I think there were some. Nuclear subs, anybody?
6469000	6475000	Matt J says, While I haven't read too much about it, I'm currently most excited for Deus Ex The Fall.
6475000	6479000	Haters can say what they want, but I think it's an interesting chapter in the Deus Ex game series.
6479000	6482000	In case you don't know, Deus Ex The Fall is an iOS Android title.
6482000	6485000	It's a sequel to the Deus Ex novel, Icarus Effect.
6485000	6488000	A lot of folks are bitching because it's a mobile title, not a console or PC title.
6488000	6491000	However, I find it looks interesting and potentially a fun game.
6491000	6498000	I'm a die-hard Deus Ex fan and excited by the prospect of a mobile, on-the-go game, something not easily done with the other titles.
6498000	6502000	I'm willing to at least give it a shot, unlike most folks who refuse to even acknowledge it.
6502000	6509000	You know, a lot of people have a smartphone, and they might say they're not going to play it all they want, but then when it's like 99 cents, they're like, ooh, gimme.
6509000	6517000	Tigerclaw says, I'm pretty excited about New Super Mario 3D World, Mario in a catsuit, but Princess Peach would look cuter in the catsuit in my opinion.
6517000	6525000	She does look cute, but the keyword is cute, and not, like, oversexed, which I think is a good thing. Right, Jamie?
6525000	6528000	Yes, it's actually, it looks like those little pajamas.
6528000	6529000	It's tasteful.
6529000	6530000	Yes it is, it's adorable too.
6530000	6536000	By the way, I saw somebody at E3 in a Pikachu footy pajama thing, head to toe.
6536000	6537000	Yeah.
6537000	6544000	And I'm kinda like, alright dude, you go on with your bad self, but then I'm kinda like, why do people dress up for E3 like that?
6544000	6545000	It's not the place for that.
6545000	6546000	It's not the place for that.
6546000	6548000	It's not Tokyo Game Show.
6548000	6549000	No.
6549000	6550000	Or actually it would be Comiket.
6550000	6551000	And it's not PAX.
6551000	6553000	But anyway, that's a whole nother episode.
6553000	6558000	I'm also looking forward to Mario Kart 8. Too bad we'll have to wait to 2014 for those two.
6558000	6563000	The new game on Mad Max would be interesting, even though there has already been a Mad Max game on the NES.
6563000	6568000	This one being made by the developers of Just Cause. I remember the Mad Max game on the NES.
6568000	6571000	That's, uh, boy oh boy.
6571000	6580000	Anyway, Gamer Girl says, mostly excited for, I know it's not PS4 exclusive, but Final Fantasy Realm Reborn, Lightning Returns, and the new Kingdom Hearts.
6580000	6582000	I think you're a Square Enix fangirl.
6582000	6591000	Andy R. says, I listened to last week's OLR after Monday and hearing all the ragging on, well if Microsoft's doing it then Sony must be doing it too, was really amusing to me.
6591000	6594000	Sorry Loki, I'll admit I chuckled at your cynicism a few times.
6594000	6597000	Before the pressers I was worried too though, so I can't be too hard on you.
6597000	6600000	That aside, I was rather impressed with Destiny.
6600000	6604000	I don't care for MMOs or FPSs, but the gameplay shown looked really fun.
6604000	6609000	And though we were all, although we all knew a new Smash Brothers was coming, I was pretty excited to buy the reveal.
6609000	6612000	That and Bayonetta 2 might convince me to buy a Wii U.
6612000	6618000	Shane replied, saying nothing but Final Fantasy XIV about 14 times, copy pasted.
6618000	6620000	It's beautiful.
6620000	6624000	And then Let's Have Tea, I always love that name, good to hear from you Let's Have Tea.
6625000	6630000	Let's Have Tea says, your thoughts on the Xbox One family sharing feature and if you guys have even heard of it.
6630000	6635000	It's probably the best feature of the Xbox One and a feature that Microsoft keeps seeming to forget to mention.
6635000	6639000	Now Let's Have Tea, as much as I love your name, I said no talking about the pressers.
6639000	6642000	But yes, I do believe we did mention that earlier in the show, right Loki?
6642000	6643000	Yeah.
6643000	6644000	So, there you go.
6644000	6650000	And yes, it does sound interesting, it's just that it's not worth the DRM trade off, that's my opinion.
6650000	6651000	And I'm sticking to it.
6651000	6656000	Those are your answers at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and Google Plus.
6656000	6658000	Search for Orange Lounge Radio.
6658000	6660000	There you go.
6660000	6662000	That's the FUGO Question of the Week.
6662000	6663000	Some more news for you guys.
6663000	6667000	Mailbag, FUs of the Week, Twitter, Skype, all coming up in a little bit.
6667000	6668000	Loki.
6668000	6669000	Who reads the mail anyway?
6669000	6670000	You do.
6670000	6671000	Get ready for it.
6671000	6672000	Okay.
6673000	6684000	Alright, so Gearbox is facing a lawsuit, and now it's not over aliens, colonial marines, but it's Duke Nukem Forever.
6684000	6691000	Apparently, Gearbox, of course, you know, after the resumed development of Duke Nukem Forever,
6692000	6705000	kind of failed to give the, I guess, was it the payoff, a 2.9 million dollar loan that 3D Realms owed, I guess, to an unnamed company.
6705000	6716000	And apparently also there are some royalties that were due as well, and they just haven't taken care of that yet.
6716000	6727000	And apparently, according to the Gearbox VP of Marketing, Steve Gibson,
6727000	6736000	the reality is Apogee and 3D Realms receive the full benefit of its bargain, Gearbox in fulfillment of its commitments.
6736000	6740000	I don't know if you've fulfilled your commitments because the game is kind of crap, but whatever.
6740000	6742000	I guess, finished game.
6743000	6750000	EnRish 3DR saved 3DR from its debts and rescued 3DR from its litigation surrounding failed dozens.
6750000	6762000	So I guess the way it sounds like that they think that because they kind of paid off their debts that they don't get any sort of kickback from Duke Nukem Forever.
6762000	6765000	Although, I can't imagine it would be that big because I don't think it sold that well.
6767000	6769000	But yeah, court case.
6770000	6776000	It's always sad when they're fighting over a game that really wasn't worth fighting over in the end.
6776000	6778000	But money's money, right?
6778000	6786000	Well, I mean, it was really weird with Aliens, Clone-O, Marines, and 3D Realms and stuff,
6786000	6792000	because I remember they were talking about misappropriation of money with Aliens, Clone-O, Marines, and going to Borderlands 2.
6792000	6801000	I'm wondering if anything similar happened with the royalties for Duke Nukem Forever and going to Borderlands 2 as well.
6803000	6807000	Alright, well, Loki, I know you cared about this because you were asking some questions about it at E3.
6807000	6810000	I didn't see it at E3, but I think Bobby got a quick look at it.
6810000	6814000	It's Mad Catz's Android console. It's just called Mojo now.
6814000	6817000	It's not Project Mojo or any of that anymore. It's called Mojo.
6817000	6824000	And unlike Ouya or what have you, Mojo will run stock Android and connects to the Google Play Store, just like any other smartphone or tablet.
6824000	6830000	So all you need for a game to be playable on Mojo is that it has to come out for Android.
6830000	6833000	And you can tie the Mojo device to your Google Play account.
6833000	6839000	So essentially, this is just literally an Android box for your TV. Literally.
6839000	6845000	Yeah, and what's kind of cool about it, though, is it does support games that don't support controllers.
6845000	6853000	So you can map your controls on the system. They also have emulation for touch controls using a mouse.
6853000	6861000	You can plug in a mouse and keyboard, or you can just use the analog sticks to emulate touch controls as well.
6861000	6866000	And then you can also map all your controls for whatever game on there.
6866000	6868000	I mean, that's pretty awesome that you can do that.
6868000	6871000	And on the show floor, it was running on a Tegra 3 processor.
6871000	6880000	It had HDMI output at 1080p, two USB inputs, 16 gigs of onboard storage that you can expand with Mini SD, Bluetooth Classic, Bluetooth Smart.
6880000	6883000	And they're saying, though, this is all subject to change.
6883000	6890000	Yeah, and I like how they have the two different Bluetooth protocols there, too, because right now they support the classic Bluetooth stuff.
6890000	6899000	But they also have the new Bluetooth 4.0 stuff where it's going to drop the latency down to very little, and it's going to make it pretty good for gaming.
6899000	6907000	And I'm wondering if they will increase or put a better processor in there, but Tegra 3 still, though, that means it's pretty cheap.
6907000	6914000	It runs on Tegra 3, and that's going to be, you know, that's 100 bucks, so probably looking around that price range.
6914000	6921000	And it's nice so that it supports Android apps, just generic Android apps, because, you know, probably a lot of people have that stuff.
6921000	6926000	It's going to be a very interesting little counter to the Ouya. We'll see what happens.
6926000	6927000	Yeah.
6927000	6928000	Moving on.
6928000	6936000	Yes, we have some Nintendo news. Actually, something come, I can never pronounce his last name right, Reggie Fils-Aime, right?
6936000	6937000	Yeah, Fils-Aime.
6937000	6939000	That's exactly it, okay. Very French.
6939000	6948000	He basically has gone on record saying that he has the key to limiting used game sales, and that's making better games.
6948000	6954000	Making games that people are going to want to replay, making them, like, here's a quote from him.
6954000	6958000	He says, the consumer wants to keep playing Mario Kart. The consumer wants to keep playing New Super Mario Brothers.
6958000	6960000	They want to keep playing Pikmin.
6960000	6968000	So we see that the trade-in frequency on Nintendo content is much less than the industry average, much, much less.
6968000	6972000	And, you know, I have to look at it in terms of my own collection.
6972000	6978000	We really do get, when we trade anything in, it's almost always something that was on the 360.
6979000	6985000	Most of our PS3 games and our Wii games actually still have a lot of replayability. We still play our GameCube games.
6985000	6988000	So, yeah, I actually really do agree.
6988000	6995000	You know, you may be thinking that these are really simplistic games, but they do have high replayability value.
6995000	7002000	Like, for example, out of your collection, Rob, what do you say that you've played the most of?
7002000	7004000	Out of all?
7004000	7007000	What games do you always find yourself going back to play?
7007000	7008000	MMOs.
7008000	7011000	Well, okay. Besides MMOs. Those don't count.
7011000	7016000	Games with the solid multi-, things that I can play with my friends. I mean, that usually is MMOs.
7016000	7021000	But, like, Mass Effect 3 was a good example because the multiplayer mode added a lot of life to that game.
7021000	7023000	It did a whole lot with that one.
7023000	7029000	But I think the thing, too, is that, like, okay, for example, any time that we have a party at my house, what happens?
7029000	7031000	We bust out Rock Band.
7031000	7032000	Good point, yeah.
7032000	7034000	It's the big thing that has the replayability.
7034000	7040000	It used to be back in the day we'd bust out Smash Brothers or Mario Party or Mario Kart.
7040000	7042000	We'd bring out a racing game that we could four screen.
7042000	7047000	Something that, you know, you could kind of screw with your friends and not feel bad about it because it was cute.
7047000	7051000	Solid multiplayer goes a long way in a game's life.
7051000	7056000	And I'm not necessarily talking about just online, but, like, you know, having that old standby.
7056000	7060000	What was the first thing, though, that everybody else was saying, though, when Animal Crossing came out?
7060000	7062000	Give me your friend code. I need your village code.
7062000	7064000	Yeah, right.
7064000	7066000	I need a peach. Who's got a peach?
7066000	7068000	Come over to shake your trees.
7068000	7076000	I think the whole strength that Nintendo games have like this is that instead of just having your friends list, you're building a community around the IP.
7076000	7079000	And I think that that also adds to their replayability.
7079000	7083000	And, yeah, you do see a lot fewer Nintendo games traded in.
7083000	7087000	The street passing on Animal Crossing is so smart, too, because I love looking at other people's homes.
7087000	7089000	Yeah.
7089000	7093000	I also, by the way, was enjoying the Sahara quotes.
7093000	7095000	I can't wait till I get my coffee.
7095000	7097000	All right.
7097000	7099000	I love that, though.
7099000	7102000	Just make better games. You want people to stop selling them? Make them better.
7102000	7104000	Well, and it's simple.
7104000	7107000	I mean, I'll tell you this even.
7107000	7111000	I go back and play SNES games all the time.
7111000	7115000	I mean, we're all kind of in that boat where we're classic gamers, too.
7115000	7125000	But I like to go back and play older games that I think are just still fun.
7125000	7128000	I mean, we've even gone back and had Bomberman parties.
7128000	7131000	I mean, who doesn't like a good game of Bomberman?
7131000	7136000	It's a game that's pretty much lasted through the years.
7136000	7140000	It's solid. And that's what I think Nintendo's focusing on is making solid games.
7140000	7142000	So, anyway.
7143000	7146000	Queen Simia in our chat room is, I think, singing about Peaches, saying,
7146000	7149000	Really love your Peaches. Want to shake your tree?
7149000	7152000	I can't help it. Suddenly I'm thinking of the Teaches of Peaches.
7152000	7154000	It's a song.
7154000	7156000	It's the lyric from a song.
7156000	7161000	I know, but now I'm thinking of Peaches, the dirty, dirty musician from Canada who sings all the, you know.
7161000	7164000	Or now I'm thinking of the presidents of the United States.
7164000	7167000	What else is in the Teaches of Peaches?
7167000	7170000	Oh, millions of Peaches.
7171000	7174000	I don't know. You can't go wrong with the Joker, so.
7174000	7177000	All right, save us from the Peach talk, Logie.
7177000	7179000	Really? We have to do that? No.
7179000	7180000	Okay.
7180000	7182000	We can talk Princess Peach.
7182000	7184000	Okay.
7184000	7190000	So, one of the theories, and definitely a theory I had, you know, with a whole, you know, a lot of people suspected,
7190000	7199000	EA getting rid of their online pass just before the announcement of the Xbox One and its features.
7200000	7210000	EA, though, saying that, hey, even though PlayStation 4 came out and revealed that they're not going to be kind of following suit with the Xbox One,
7210000	7214000	they are still not going to bring back the online pass.
7214000	7220000	And also set, you know, of course reaffirmed that, you know, getting rid of the online pass was not because of the Xbox One.
7220000	7222000	They say that it just wasn't working out for them.
7222000	7224000	And I don't know the belief from it.
7224000	7228000	I kind of, on one hand, want to just say, I don't buy it.
7228000	7232000	Because I think that they were kind of banking on both systems doing that.
7232000	7237000	But at the same time, maybe they have figured out that they're just making a lot more money from DLC.
7237000	7243000	And instead of making it harder for people to, you know, or less desirable for people to buy their games, you know,
7243000	7248000	whether it be buying it new or buying used and have them pay an online pass,
7248000	7253000	just make it easier for people to buy games and then just have a ton of DLC.
7253000	7259000	You know, I don't know if necessarily nickelene and diamond, but they've attempted to do that with, you know, like Dead Space 3 and stuff.
7259000	7262000	So maybe that's where they're kind of seeing it.
7262000	7267000	And I think that kind of makes sense also with the Xbox One and their game sharing,
7267000	7269000	is that's where they're probably going to try to make a lot of their money,
7269000	7274000	is since you're not buying copies of the games and you're going to get a lot less sales now because of that,
7274000	7277000	that DLC is going to be more profitable.
7277000	7281000	I know you all love it when we keep bringing this game up, but Mass Effect 3 really did it great.
7281000	7288000	I mean, there's not just the free DLC, but, you know, then there's the, all the story DLC was so good, you know.
7288000	7290000	Well, especially with the big apology.
7290000	7296000	To be fair, it was probably better in Mass Effect 2 overall, but I mean, still a good example of DLC done right.
7296000	7302000	None of it flat out sucked. You can't sit there and go to the DLC. Well, maybe like the armor packs.
7302000	7304000	There were things that you could complain about later.
7304000	7305000	Yeah.
7305000	7310000	Like, really? Is that what happens in Omega? I'm sorry, did I mention a particular one? Sorry.
7310000	7316000	Although I did completely find the Citadel DLC absolutely hilarious. Just saying.
7316000	7325000	And then, of course, they're saying that now they're working on this gamer first use game policy for next gen.
7325000	7333000	Basically, I don't know what exactly that means. Gamers first and customer first.
7333000	7339000	Does that mean that there are going to be no restrictions at all, or are they going to try something else?
7340000	7354000	I don't know. I'm guessing that it's not this idea. Although, I think it's made it, you know, definitely the response to the Xbox One DRM and, you know, limiting use game sales and online passings.
7354000	7363000	I definitely think that publishers are aware of the perception of that, and I think they will maybe think twice about implementing that in the future.
7364000	7374000	Especially if Sony's not doing it anymore, and EA's not doing it anymore, who's really left? Warner Games and Ubisoft. That's it.
7374000	7379000	Ubisoft has their whole little tie-in service to Uplay. They can invest in that.
7379000	7383000	It's still, though, they have, that could still be free, but right now they're still passing.
7383000	7390000	THQs can't do it anymore because they're out of business, and Deep Silver is not continuing with that, I think. I'm pretty sure they're not, because they didn't with Metro.
7391000	7394000	So, it's kind of on its way out already.
7395000	7404000	Alright, before we get to the next story, a very interesting breaking news that a lot of our chatters are talking about is a tweet that just showed up from Bobby.
7404000	7413000	My house just got struck by lightning. That's why he disappeared from chat. Most of my electronics are fried. I'm fine.
7413000	7414000	Holy crap.
7414000	7423000	But Bobby seems like the type that would have had a surge protector on everything. He was telling me to get the power source for the computer when all that stuff went down with one of the live shows.
7423000	7427000	But a surge protector isn't a cure-all, trust me.
7428000	7430000	Well, I hope everything's okay. I hope when he's...
7430000	7432000	I've had a hard drive melted that was hooked to a surge protector.
7432000	7439000	Yeah, I'm hoping when he says fried that he means like they're just, you know, all they need is a quick little fix or something, but that's...
7439000	7444000	Seeing that Bobby does a lot with electronics, especially the VOG, that's a big deal.
7444000	7447000	Well, just stay in touch with us and let us know what we need to do if he can hear.
7447000	7451000	What's up with lightning and taking out people that do like tech blog stuff?
7451000	7453000	Because usually they're connected.
7453000	7456000	Ours Technica, you know, the guy actually got hit by lightning.
7456000	7459000	Because they can't stop cranking out lightning video games.
7459000	7465000	Well, when I was living with my ex-remate, and this is, you know, back in the days of dial-up,
7465000	7476000	but we still had a surge protector on both the power supply and on the cable, the internet cable,
7476000	7484000	and still with a direct shot from lightning to her antenna, we fried her hard drive. And the modem.
7484000	7487000	It's really good that he didn't have, you know, an Xbox One connected at this time,
7487000	7491000	because literally a lightning strike would turn it into a killing death machine.
7491000	7495000	So, you know, it's a good thing that we're still months away.
7495000	7501000	Well, I hope everything's alright, because I know his day job relies on electronics and all that.
7501000	7505000	Yeah, I agree with VX JasonXV who said hopefully you just meant that figuratively.
7505000	7509000	Yeah, I hope so too. I hope so too. We'll find out soon.
7510000	7515000	Moving on, let me get back to the gaming news we had on deck tonight.
7515000	7522000	Nintendo could be releasing a free-to-play game. I know. It would be within the fiscal year,
7522000	7528000	which would end on March 2014. It was during an analyst briefing at E3 that this was announced.
7528000	7532000	So this is something that's actually happening. It's not a Mario game, it's not a Pokemon game.
7532000	7536000	But it could be an already existing franchise to a brand new IP.
7536000	7541000	Now, Destructoid had an interesting theory that it could be an Advance Wars game,
7541000	7546000	because that would seem to fit in very well. I mean, it makes a lot of sense for what could show up on the Wii U,
7546000	7549000	and would work with the free-to-play model generally well.
7549000	7556000	Even though a lot of people associate free-to-play with shit games, there's some free-to-play games that are pretty cool.
7556000	7560000	What about, like, if it's an MMO, they could be Dragon Quest X?
7561000	7565000	No, because that would involve Square Enix. This is a Nintendo thing.
7565000	7567000	Nintendo would not have announced a Square Enix game like that.
7567000	7569000	They could be publishing it over here.
7569000	7572000	I love your thought, but no. Just no.
7575000	7580000	I would love to be wrong about that. I would love to, but I kind of doubt it.
7580000	7585000	Alright, let's get to the mailbag. I don't doubt that you guys send us emails every week.
7585000	7587000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
7588000	7590000	And we answer the emails here on the program.
7591000	7592000	Yeah, yeah.
7592000	7595000	I'm sure it's been filling up a little bit after E3.
7595000	7596000	Well, we have four.
7596000	7596500	Okay.
7596500	7598000	Four legit. Four legit.
7599000	7601000	The first one comes from Robert M.
7601000	7605000	Right now, MCPE is my only Minecraft.
7605000	7607000	Excuse me, not counting the Lego set.
7607000	7611000	Because it's much more convenient for me during commuting and breaks.
7611000	7618000	Unfortunately, Realms won't be of much use to me at home, since the app freezes when I open it connected to my home Wi-Fi.
7618000	7625000	This does not seem to affect other apps, and I can't access local multiplayer with no issue on other Wi-Fi.
7626000	7627000	Sorry.
7627000	7631000	I don't expect anyone to be able to tech support on this, just odd.
7632000	7637000	Setting fireplace in log cabin with Neather, rack flame, poor outcome.
7637000	7639000	That says haiku.
7639000	7641000	No. Cute.
7641000	7642000	Yeah.
7642000	7643000	So yeah.
7644000	7647000	Well, I'm not sure why the issue is with your local Wi-Fi.
7648000	7658000	Although, oddly enough, there's certain apps that I have that require a connection that won't necessarily work on my Wi-Fi, but they'll work on the 3G and they'll work elsewhere.
7659000	7663000	Maybe the problem is related to why the station keeps fucking dropping while we're trying to do a show.
7664000	7666000	Maybe we have the same provider. I don't know.
7667000	7669000	Howdy sentient creatures.
7669000	7672000	After listening to episode 507, I have two thoughts.
7672000	7674000	First of all, a haiku.
7674000	7677000	I was right, but I didn't want to be right.
7677000	7679000	Damn, The Last Guardian.
7679000	7682000	Second, I have a holiday-style greeting for E3.
7682000	7685000	Happy hyperbolic statement period.
7685000	7687000	Stay black, redertainment trainer.
7689000	7690000	Alright.
7691000	7693000	Sometimes it's painful to be right.
7695000	7696000	This is from Sam.
7697000	7699000	And the message is, happy E3, OLR crew.
7700000	7705000	One game I failed to see from Ubisoft this E3 is Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Patriots.
7705000	7709000	Do you think the game has been renamed and re-revealed as Tom Clancy's The Division?
7710000	7711000	I wouldn't think-
7711000	7712000	No, no.
7712000	7715000	Do you think Ubisoft has more than one team on Tom Clancy games?
7715000	7716000	Yeah, I think so.
7716000	7717000	Well, yeah, they definitely do.
7717000	7718000	I wouldn't be surprised.
7718000	7721000	I don't think- no, it's not even- doesn't even look similar at all.
7721000	7724000	It's probably just something- they have Blacklist coming out now.
7724000	7729000	I think it's probably being made now for next gen, and so it's just, you know-
7729000	7730000	Bump back a little bit.
7730000	7731000	Yeah, I think so.
7731000	7732000	Fair enough.
7734000	7735000	Sorry, I was answering your question.
7735000	7736000	I'm with Loki.
7736000	7737000	It could be quarter four next year.
7737000	7739000	That makes sense, I think.
7740000	7742000	So I was answering your question in chat.
7742000	7745000	I happened to mention that my ex-roommate from college got struck by lightning.
7746000	7748000	Came in smelling that buzzy smell.
7748000	7749000	Ew.
7749000	7750000	With her hair sticking up.
7750000	7751000	Ew.
7751000	7752000	And she just said,
7752000	7754000	I got struck by lightning.
7754000	7756000	And I was like, Meglet, are you okay?
7756000	7757000	Her name was Meg, we called her Meglet.
7757000	7759000	I was like, are you okay?
7759000	7761000	Yeah, I'm gonna lay down.
7761000	7763000	And she didn't get up the rest of the day.
7763000	7764000	I kept checking on her.
7764000	7766000	She got up and she was just fine.
7769000	7770000	You have a lot of weird stories.
7770000	7773000	And then she said it was the second time in her life she'd been struck by lightning.
7773000	7775000	Go buy a lottery ticket, Meglet.
7775000	7776000	Seriously.
7776000	7778000	I just asked Bobby if it took out the fence.
7779000	7782000	You're such an asshole.
7782000	7785000	He probably lost some of his computers and stuff.
7785000	7787000	You're like, did I hit the fence?
7787000	7788000	Bobby, I'm sorry for laughing.
7788000	7790000	It makes me a horrible human being.
7790000	7792000	I've been in your place.
7792000	7795000	His kitties were at the boarding thing.
7795000	7797000	He can't pick them up until Monday.
7797000	7799000	So the cats aren't affected, just so you guys know.
7799000	7800000	That's important.
7800000	7801000	Yay for the kitties.
7801000	7803000	Think of the kitties.
7803000	7804000	Last email, Rob.
7804000	7806000	And this one is a poem.
7806000	7808000	Written by Degenerate Johnny.
7808000	7810000	Shall I read it?
7810000	7811000	Yes.
7811000	7813000	Once again, E3 has lived up to its name.
7813000	7815000	The event has proven it's still relevant.
7815000	7818000	Gamers rejoiced at the sight of upcoming titles.
7818000	7822000	And judging from the drool puddles, E3 is also salivant.
7822000	7826000	Microsoft promises a year of excitement.
7826000	7828000	One full of fun features and games.
7828000	7830000	Unfortunately, some of them seem to be disappointing.
7830000	7833000	Especially the ones that suffer drops in sound and frames.
7833000	7836000	Indeed, Microsoft did not address the hard issues.
7836000	7838000	It seems this year they're rolling the dice.
7838000	7843000	Without explanation of online benefits, $500 is too steep of a price.
7843000	7845000	Sony's conference was impressive.
7845000	7847000	It was full of exciting announcements and games.
7847000	7850000	With the announcement of no restrictions on used titles.
7850000	7853000	It almost made up for Sony's previous shames.
7853000	7856000	Indeed, Jack Tretton was on Cloud 9.
7856000	7858000	You can see it on his face.
7858000	7860000	The chanting of Sony's name was most telling.
7860000	7863000	The PS4 will start ahead in the console race.
7863000	7865000	It's like generation 6 all over again.
7865000	7867000	Sony will come out on top real fast.
7867000	7870000	Wii U started with no games just like the GameCube.
7870000	7872000	But will X-Bone go the way of the Dreamcast?
7872000	7876000	The excitement and energy never stops at E3.
7876000	7878000	It's an event full of comedy and tragedy.
7878000	7881000	All I can say is that I can't wait for this holiday season.
7881000	7885000	And I'm sure the same can be said for the O.L. Army.
7885000	7889000	Wishing a tubular E3 to all gamers and fathers.
7889000	7891000	Degenerate Johnny.
7891000	7893000	I think I cried a little.
7893000	7896000	That was a very clever little poem.
7896000	7897000	Thank you.
7897000	7898000	Good job.
7898000	7900000	It should be posted on our forums.
7900000	7903000	So there's an update from Bobby.
7903000	7905000	I know this is not gaming news.
7905000	7908000	But obviously we care about Bobby and want him to be alright.
7908000	7912000	As of right now, it looks like I lost all my routers and switches.
7912000	7916000	My audio receiver, my 360, and my Wii U.
7916000	7918000	Ooh.
7918000	7920000	Wow.
7920000	7923000	Are Acts of God under warranty?
7923000	7925000	I don't know.
7925000	7927000	Hopefully he's got insurance or something.
7927000	7929000	There's got to be a homeowner's insurance.
7929000	7936000	Yeah, most homeowner's insurance will have some type of personal property.
7936000	7937000	Christ.
7937000	7938000	If it's not just dwelling.
7938000	7944000	If not for some reason, anyone from Microsoft or Nintendo listening that can help them out?
7944000	7946000	One thing I can tell you is that...
7946000	7950000	Oh, God, I wonder if that was his special 360.
7950000	7954000	I don't want to say too much, but he had a very special 360.
7954000	7956000	I hope that wasn't it.
7956000	7961000	I can tell you that most insurances in the South, as far as I'm aware,
7961000	7964000	definitely have some sort of hard weather coverage.
7964000	7966000	It's required, so...
7966000	7970000	VXJ's next V says Acts of God are explicitly not covered by warranty.
7970000	7974000	I would still hope, though, that there would be some type of...
7974000	7976000	I think homeowner's insurance would cover something like that.
7976000	7978000	Homeowner's insurance or something, yeah.
7978000	7979000	Lordy.
7979000	7981000	Yeah.
7981000	7982000	Alrighty.
7982000	7984000	I've been in that position. I feel that pain.
7984000	7988000	People underestimate the weather, especially back east.
7988000	7990000	Right?
7990000	7992000	Alright, is that it for the mailbag?
7992000	7993000	Yes, it is.
7993000	7997000	Alright, mailbag at orangelandtrader.com.
7997000	8000000	Another reason I keep reporting on what's going on with Bobby,
8000000	8003000	he may not be back to do a show next week.
8003000	8006000	Not confirmed yet. Just let him make that announcement.
8006000	8009000	Watch his Twitter, because clearly his cell phone still works.
8009000	8012000	Bobby will be calling us and doing it on Skype.
8012000	8015000	He's more than welcome to. We'll be here.
8015000	8020000	Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week.
8020000	8021000	How appropriate.
8021000	8022000	Absolutely timed.
8022000	8024000	Well then, first off...
8024000	8042000	First off, I think an FU from all of us to Lightning.
8042000	8047000	I would like to go ahead though and give, especially Brad in the chat room,
8047000	8049000	but people have already been bringing it up.
8049000	8052000	Already thinking of ways to help Bobby replace his stuff.
8052000	8055000	We seriously have the best listeners in the universe.
8055000	8056000	We do. You know what?
8056000	8058000	And actually this is one of the things Bobby and I were talking about,
8058000	8060000	is that, you know, at the Voice Geek Network,
8060000	8062000	we don't have the biggest audience.
8062000	8067000	And that's okay, because I seriously think we have the most loyal audience.
8067000	8068000	We do.
8068000	8071000	And we are so fortunate to have that. You guys are amazing.
8071000	8075000	We have people listening to us that not just give of their time to listen,
8075000	8077000	they give of themselves.
8077000	8080000	And we'd like to give back to you as much as we can.
8080000	8089000	It's like, I don't need 10,000 listeners if we have 100 awesome, loyal listeners.
8089000	8091000	You know what I mean? Like, it means so much more.
8091000	8094000	And how many of our listeners are we actually, like, totally good friends with now?
8094000	8095000	Yeah, I know.
8095000	8098000	I probably don't need five 360s either.
8098000	8100000	You probably don't, sir.
8100000	8102000	I could probably lend him or give him one.
8102000	8104000	Well, we'll see. Hopefully he's got insurance. We'll find out.
8104000	8105000	He's probably trying...
8105000	8107000	I have banned ones. That doesn't do you any well.
8107000	8110000	He's probably trying to process a lot right now, so let's give him a little space,
8110000	8113000	and then I'm sure he'll be able to clear up what's up.
8113000	8116000	I can lend him an NES. No.
8116000	8122000	But yeah, my FU for today goes towards people who drive like assholes.
8122000	8127000	And I'm not just talking about, you know, speeding a little bit here or not signaling.
8127000	8134000	I'm talking about the BMW driver that I saw cut off a Lexus just because the Lexus had managed to get...
8134000	8139000	They closed off one lane where they're doing that construction back on Eastern.
8139000	8147000	And so the Lexus just happened to pull ahead of where the BMW had tried to get up in the front
8147000	8150000	and cut that person off, but the Lexus was just a better driver.
8150000	8158000	And so the BMW driver swerves around and cuts off the BMW driver as soon as there's two lanes again.
8158000	8162000	And I swear that was almost a Miranda.
8162000	8168000	Yeah, Mako drivers. Fuck them. No. That would be me. I drive the Mako horribly.
8168000	8175000	And then I think that I've got a sore throat.
8175000	8179000	And FU to not having a job. I need one of those.
8179000	8184000	Everybody that I've ever sent applications to, hire me, because I'm a really good person.
8184000	8186000	I will work hard for you.
8186000	8189000	That, and I'm really good with InDesign.
8190000	8192000	Loki?
8192000	8200000	Fuck you to FPSbox.com, our previous host of the Minecraft server for the VoG network.
8200000	8208000	And basically, I guess it got sold off or something happened, and basically the website's running in autopilot.
8208000	8211000	So when the servers go down, nobody answers support.
8211000	8216000	There's no phone anymore. There's no email. Nobody cares.
8216000	8221000	And so actually, taking a look at some of the servers that are online, most of them are down right now.
8221000	8227000	And what sucks is the FTP portion of it's down as well, so I can't, I have backups of the server.
8227000	8232000	I can make backups, but I can't access any of them, because they're on the FTP server.
8232000	8235000	And there's something, it's something with the authentication.
8235000	8238000	It keeps saying that I have the wrong password, even though I don't.
8238000	8245000	And it doesn't matter, so you can't reset it either, because the reset password thing's broken, so.
8246000	8249000	Yeah, I'll just have to start anew if we're actually gonna do it.
8249000	8252000	And who knows, we haven't been getting a lot of people on there anyways.
8252000	8255000	Might as well just save myself ten bucks a month.
8257000	8261000	I may change my mind. There's other hosts out there that'll actually let me upload my own JAR files,
8261000	8267000	which I wanted to do in the first place, so that we could have cool things like airplanes and cars and guns.
8268000	8270000	I totally want a gun.
8270000	8271000	They have Mass Effect guns too.
8271000	8277000	You know what, I totally just redid my little sprite to look like my Minecraft person to look like Shepard.
8278000	8283000	Alright, I'm just gonna give an F.U. to traffic as well, because some bitch cut me off today on the freeway,
8283000	8285000	and it's like, when you're going 80 miles an hour, don't be cutting people off.
8285000	8286000	Did she drive a BMW?
8286000	8289000	No, but I did see a couple asshole BMW drivers.
8289000	8292000	I'm not saying that all BMW drivers are assholes, but I'm just saying, I see a lot of them.
8292000	8296000	I'm starting to agree with Jeremy Clarkson, by the way. BMW drivers.
8296000	8298000	Otherwise, I had a pretty good week, I can't complain.
8298000	8300000	Although, Matt is a good BMW driver.
8301000	8305000	F.U. to Disneyland for me missing it so much.
8306000	8308000	F.U. to awkward moments.
8308000	8309000	Awkward?
8309000	8313000	I'll say that too. Oh yeah, very awkward moment, I'll have to tell you off air, it's not appropriate for on air.
8313000	8314000	There's nothing to do with the show.
8314000	8317000	Well, how about also F.U.'s to elusive ties?
8319000	8325000	Alright, let's move on with a couple more stories, and then we'll get to Skypline.
8326000	8335000	Alright, so the new thing for Xbox One, of course, they're talking about their system for achievements and stuff.
8335000	8336000	It's going to be a little bit different.
8336000	8341000	Which, by the way, I gotta add, this is one thing we didn't talk about at the press conference.
8341000	8347000	They have the day one edition that gives you DLC that is an achievement.
8348000	8349000	So that's kind of lame.
8350000	8355000	I'm sure it's just stupid, like, you know, we were, you know, we bought it day one type thing.
8355000	8357000	But that's still lame.
8358000	8362000	But anyways, so the challenges, I guess they're saying that it's going to be a little bit different than achievements.
8362000	8363000	It's alongside it.
8363000	8371000	It may not necessarily be, it may be like time limited, so you may have a certain amount of time to do a certain challenge in a game.
8371000	8373000	It may actually be tied to multiple games.
8374000	8381000	It could be tied to some community based thing, like, you know, playing X amount of hours of Halo or something like that during lunch.
8381000	8385000	Remember they did something like that, I think with Halo 4, it gave you some discounts and stuff.
8385000	8389000	And everybody that participated got some stuff.
8389000	8392000	I want to say, I think it was Halo, maybe Halo Reach.
8393000	8406000	And then they're saying that also Xbox One video and music apps can also use achievements to reward people that would seek peak content to early access or subscription extensions.
8408000	8410000	So it's interesting that they're going to be doing all that stuff.
8411000	8414000	It sounds interesting that they're kind of revamping their achievement system.
8416000	8419000	I didn't think they would change what wasn't super broken.
8419000	8428000	I knew there were a few things here and there that they were talking about, like the whole achievements that they could build on the fly as memes come out for the game and so forth.
8431000	8434000	Doesn't Nintendo call them challenges, by the way, on StreetPass?
8434000	8435000	I don't know.
8436000	8437000	Just curious.
8437000	8444000	Alright, before we get to your calls tonight, one more story tonight, and it's to kind of put the wrap on all the E3 stories tonight.
8444000	8451000	E3 this year, 48,200 attendees. That's an increase of 2,500 from the prior year.
8451000	8453000	Bite my tongue, bite my tongue, bite my tongue.
8455000	8458000	Forty million dollars in revenue brought to the city of Los Angeles from that.
8458000	8463000	Next year's E3, June 10th through the 12th, also at the LA Convention Center.
8463000	8471000	But what will be interesting about next year's show, this isn't in the news story, but if you've been paying attention, there will be no more West Hall.
8471000	8474000	That's what they're tearing down to make Farmer's Field.
8474000	8479000	So it will be interesting to see, which is the football stadium for the football team that LA doesn't have yet.
8479000	8480000	Hello, Kensha Hall.
8480000	8484000	I don't know. Yeah, does that mean Kensha Hall is used next year?
8484000	8491000	Or the rumor is they're going to build, well it's not a rumor, but they're going to build an expansion on the other side of the street.
8491000	8494000	But when will that be done is anyone's guess.
8494000	8496000	Buy my Ouya parking lot.
8497000	8499000	Who knows, who knows. But there you go.
8500000	8503000	There was a question I didn't get to ask about E3 this year.
8503000	8504000	Sure.
8504000	8506000	Is if they were still handing out balls.
8508000	8509000	Like they did every year.
8511000	8514000	Because that used to be the only time I would ever get balls.
8515000	8516000	So, just saying.
8518000	8521000	And Bobby says his podcast gear is fine.
8521000	8522000	Yay!
8522000	8523000	So he should be there.
8523000	8524000	Huzzah!
8524000	8528000	The audio receiver is for my surround sound, so it sounds like his living room got fucked up most of all.
8528000	8529000	That's what it sounds like.
8529000	8532000	He could probably have my audio receiver too because I don't use that either.
8532000	8536000	Everybody's all nice around. I just got to say, you guys rule.
8536000	8546000	I have like a surround sound system that we don't use anymore because Josh is asleep when we watch TV and so we don't need a blast surround sound anymore.
8546000	8551000	Alright, I haven't even given out the damn number and already the Skype line lighting up.
8551000	8557000	1877 Game O-L-R, or user name on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, but you'll have to wait for this guy.
8558000	8559000	Who's on the line here?
8559000	8560000	You're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
8561000	8562000	OrangeLoungeRadio?
8562000	8564000	I thought I was calling Best Buy to pre-order my PlayStation 4.
8567000	8569000	Sure, just give me your credit card number.
8570000	8571000	I don't think so, Tim.
8572000	8573000	What's up, buddy?
8574000	8576000	Not too much, not too much.
8576000	8582000	I just want to say that I have to thank Sony.
8582000	8588000	I mean, their presser made me feel like what it was like to be an actual gamer.
8589000	8590000	That's how it hit home for me.
8591000	8594000	You know, there was a very interesting comment left on the VoG network.
8594000	8598000	I think it was Flaco Jones who said it on last week's show at VoGnetwork.com.
8598000	8601000	He said last week's show was kind of Doom and Gloom.
8601000	8602000	What was that?
8602000	8603000	Macabre?
8603000	8604000	He said it was very...
8604000	8605000	Morbid?
8605000	8606000	Morbid kind of episode.
8606000	8610000	Because, yeah, we were playing the funeral march to the Xbox stuff and all that.
8610000	8614000	I was sitting here going, this is a sad fucking day to be a gamer.
8614000	8618000	But at the Sony press conference when they hit bullet after bullet after bullet, it was like...
8619000	8622000	Celebrate good times, come on.
8623000	8626000	If everyone was on board with the Xbox One stuff,
8626000	8629000	then I wasn't really that excited about the next gen.
8629000	8631000	I was like, okay, what am I going to do now?
8631000	8635000	And now that they came out with that, I was like, cool, I can be excited about these games now.
8637000	8638000	Very much so.
8638000	8641000	I mean, I was so excited after seeing the Kingdom Hearts 3 trailer.
8641000	8644000	I'm playing through Kingdom Hearts 1 right now.
8646000	8650000	Is the internet as a whole being too fanboy with this?
8650000	8656000	Are we being too blinded by Sony's tackling of Microsoft?
8656000	8659000	Are we not seeing the big picture here?
8659000	8663000	Are we refusing to acknowledge that Microsoft may actually have some good ideas?
8663000	8666000	That maybe Sony doesn't have the good exclusives?
8666000	8667000	What do you think?
8667000	8669000	Do you think we are being too fanboy?
8670000	8672000	Yes and no.
8672000	8678000	Coming from the cosplay fandom, anime fandom, I'll say this much.
8678000	8687000	You take something away, the fans will never forgive you no matter how well you fix it.
8687000	8690000	If Microsoft say that, oh, we're not going to do the DRM thing.
8690000	8694000	The fans will still look at Microsoft and be like, it doesn't matter.
8694000	8697000	You gone and done fucked up.
8697000	8705000	It's no different from when the anime companies were jumping on the whole streaming and shutting down the fan suburbs.
8705000	8708000	We're like, we're good companies. We're giving you the stuff that you want.
8708000	8713000	But then the fans are like, you shut down my favorite fan suburbs. Why should I buy from you?
8713000	8720000	I think just a more direct comparison would be Sony really fucked up in 2006 and now they're back.
8720000	8723000	It's not even necessarily just now they're back.
8723000	8727000	They slowly were getting their groove back over the past few years.
8727000	8732000	But I think Microsoft made some really bad personnel decisions in the past few years and it's starting to show.
8732000	8733000	Sorry about it.
8733000	8738000	And you're absolutely right. I'm looking at the breakdown of the consoles.
8738000	8744000	I read the article how the cost of the PS4 is about $325.
8744000	8751000	If the PS4 and Xbox One are similar in hardware and if that's the case,
8751000	8757000	then you're actually paying an extra hundred bucks for Kinect, something that somebody may not even want.
8757000	8763000	I think that's one of Microsoft's huge mistakes is clinging to that Kinect.
8763000	8768000	And I think that's one of the two big, big mistakes they made.
8768000	8772000	And to point out, I've actually gone on record saying that I don't want to Kinect.
8772000	8779000	I mean, I wanted to Kinect at first because I wanted to do Para Para games, but it doesn't really mean anything to me anymore.
8779000	8780000	I don't care.
8780000	8789000	Exactly. And I was saying to people when Xbox One, everyone was talking about the designs, I'm like, what are you talking about?
8789000	8793000	I've had an Xbox One sitting in my living room for about a year and a half.
8793000	8798000	It's called the Verizon Files DVR box. They look exactly the same.
8798000	8801000	All right, Rama, anything else before we let you go?
8801000	8804000	Yeah, for Ucchan.
8804000	8805000	Ooh, what?
8805000	8809000	Well, I know you miss your Coke Black, but I want to try to ship this out to you.
8809000	8816000	Here in New York, they have what's called Manhattan Special. It's cola and espresso as a soft drink.
8816000	8818000	I need this in my life.
8818000	8819000	So good.
8819000	8820000	I need this in my life.
8820000	8822000	Rama, I'm going to let you go. Take care, buddy.
8822000	8823000	All right, you too, bro.
8823000	8824000	All right, bye.
8824000	8825000	Bye.
8825000	8830000	1877 game OLR. Our user's name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, but let's go to the phones.
8830000	8832000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
8832000	8833000	Hey, it's Bobby.
8833000	8835000	Hey, Bobby. How you doing?
8835000	8836000	Hi, Bobby.
8836000	8837000	Little shook up.
8837000	8838000	Little shook up.
8838000	8841000	Yeah, okay, what happened?
8841000	8847000	I'm sitting there listening to OLR, and I hear a huge, really loud clap over my head.
8847000	8855000	And all my lights flicker, and I'm like, okay, that was close.
8855000	8861000	And then I notice that my brand new Netgear router is not on anymore.
8861000	8866000	And then I look over to my right, and my brand new Netgear 8-port switch is not on anymore.
8866000	8872000	And then I go upstairs, and my brand new Netgear 8-port switch that's upstairs is not on anymore.
8872000	8881000	And then I start looking around, and I try to, you know, assume the worst, and I try to turn on my TV and my receiver.
8881000	8887000	The TV comes on, but it's at the setup screen, and my audio receiver doesn't come on at all.
8887000	8891000	The red light on my Wii U is no longer on.
8891000	8893000	The PS3's red light was on.
8893000	8896000	The 360 didn't turn on when I pressed it.
8896000	8904000	And, let's see, I've come upstairs, my old 32-inch Trinitron TV for my retro games, that doesn't work anymore.
8904000	8906000	And the PS2 up here is dead.
8906000	8914000	Well, I guess the first question I asked, do you have homeowners insurance or something that will hopefully replace some of this?
8914000	8919000	I absolutely do. I haven't pulled it out to see if it covers this, but I'm sure it does.
8919000	8926000	You might check also with the 360 and the Wii U, maybe just the replacement power supply might be all it needs for that.
8926000	8927000	Yeah.
8927000	8933000	And I think that we've actually got spares for those, because we've inherited dead systems from Dan's days at GameCrazy.
8933000	8938000	Well, and that just goes to show, Bobby, within literally two minutes of your tweet going up,
8938000	8944000	everybody in the VOG Network chat room was like, let's take up a collection, let's donate, let's send,
8944000	8949000	I've got an extra 360, I can send him if he needs it. I think it goes a long way.
8949000	8953000	And I was mentioning to the live listeners, I know you didn't hear this, because lightning,
8953000	8959000	it's one of the things you and I were talking about in the car when we were driving to Anaheim the other night,
8959000	8965000	was that we may not have the biggest audience here at the Voice of the East Network, but we have the most loyal.
8965000	8968000	And we are so fucking thankful for that. You guys are amazing.
8968000	8969000	Yeah.
8970000	8976000	But my computers are fine, they stayed up, my two monitors, I even checked my old classic box, it came right back up.
8976000	8983000	So it seems like it hits certain floors of your house more than others, because it's probably a circuit.
8983000	8984000	Yeah.
8984000	8990000	Yeah, well, I mean, it hit, I mean, because the router, but my router is down next to my computer.
8990000	8996000	And so it hits some things. Everything's on surge protectors, but this was, you know, they don't protect every surge,
8996000	9003000	and this one must have been pretty direct. And, but yeah, it kind of hit different things, like my GameCube still works,
9003000	9005000	and it's sitting right next to my PS2.
9005000	9007000	Well.
9007000	9012000	But that TV doesn't work too well anymore, so I think something inside the TV got fried.
9012000	9019000	Take some time to process, call the insurance company on Monday, see what, you know, steps you have to take.
9019000	9025000	And if there's anything you need, you know you've got the three of us, you've got 61 people in chat right now,
9025000	9029000	and I know every single one of them is willing to help, and then add on to that the podcast listeners,
9029000	9034000	the other folks at VoGnetwork.com. We'll get you through this.
9034000	9035000	Yeah.
9035000	9037000	It just sucks. It sucks.
9037000	9040000	Yeah, I've spent a lot of money this past week.
9040000	9044000	Yeah, he did. He did, folks. Disneyland ain't cheap, you guys.
9044000	9050000	But, most important, you're okay. The cats were still in kitty daycare due to your trip.
9050000	9054000	They don't open again until Monday, so your cats are okay, and you're okay.
9054000	9055000	Yep.
9055000	9057000	Most important, everything else is just stuff.
9057000	9060000	Weren't we saying that Nintendo goes last?
9060000	9063000	I haven't checked on my classic consoles yet, so.
9063000	9066000	It's just stuff. It's just stuff.
9066000	9067000	Yeah.
9067000	9069000	Well, I'm sure I've got spare Nintendos if you need one.
9069000	9073000	I know, I know. Well, everybody's here willing to help, Bobby.
9073000	9077000	Otherwise, anything else you want to say, turning it over to you.
9077000	9082000	You're open forum for you. I don't want to rush you out of here, if you have anything else you want to say.
9082000	9086000	Not really. I just figured I'd fill people in.
9086000	9087000	Well, we do.
9087000	9088000	Somebody send me a chat log.
9088000	9095000	We do appreciate the update. I think mine logs, but if not, I'm sure somebody in chat will have you covered.
9095000	9096000	Okay, cool.
9096000	9097000	All right.
9097000	9098000	All right.
9098000	9105000	Keep us posted via Twitter. I know a lot of folks here at VOG Network follow you on Twitter, twitter.com slash bobbyblackwolf,
9105000	9111000	and will be a great way to get the updates on how it goes with the insurance company and all that throughout the week.
9111000	9112000	All right.
9112000	9113000	All right.
9113000	9114000	Bye, guys.
9114000	9117000	All right. Take care, buddy. Bye bye.
9117000	9120000	I don't know what else to tell them right now.
9120000	9121000	I've been there.
9121000	9122000	Yeah.
9122000	9130000	So, which is actually kind of funny because that same storm that I fried my roommate's hard drive in,
9130000	9136000	one of my friends lost their Genesis, but their Super Nintendo worked.
9136000	9138000	And they were both on the same circuit.
9138000	9139000	All right.
9139000	9145000	I'm going to need a dick or a fart joke, please, to help cheer us up a little bit here and lighten the mood a little bit.
9145000	9146000	But let's try this call.
9146000	9147000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9147000	9150000	Who's this?
9150000	9153000	Hi, this is Haseo Tsumurugawa.
9153000	9154000	Hi.
9154000	9155000	Hello.
9155000	9156000	You said Haseo Tsumurugawa?
9156000	9157000	Yeah.
9157000	9158000	Hey, what's up?
9158000	9159000	I don't know if I've heard you call in before.
9159000	9160000	What's on your mind, buddy?
9160000	9163000	Actually, I've called in like two or three times.
9163000	9164000	Oh.
9164000	9165000	Yeah, Rob.
9165000	9166000	I forgot.
9166000	9171000	I don't remember a video call except I think I'm seeing a statue on your cam.
9171000	9181000	Actually, I chose that statue for a reason because the VoG network has earned good karma and had the hero shift to hero.
9181000	9184000	It's the statue from Infamous 2.
9184000	9185000	Oh, okay.
9185000	9187000	It's a little dark in your room or something.
9187000	9188000	It's a little fuzzy coming through.
9188000	9189000	It's hard to make out.
9189000	9190000	But I get it.
9190000	9191000	I get it now.
9191000	9193000	Crappy PlayStation way.
9193000	9195000	So, what's up, buddy?
9195000	9202000	Actually, I was going to talk about the whole virtual E3 booth that Sony was doing this week or whatever.
9202000	9203000	Oh, okay.
9203000	9204000	Yeah.
9204000	9205000	I didn't have a chance to really check that out.
9205000	9206000	Tell me about that.
9206000	9218000	It was actually pretty interesting because they booth pretty much everything major that's coming out like Infamous 2nd Son, Assassin's Creed IV, and all that stuff.
9218000	9221000	And they had like little quests and whatnot.
9221000	9228000	You could earn a free month of Music Unlimited, PlayStation Plus, all those lovely things.
9228000	9230000	That's pretty cool.
9230000	9233000	Yeah, I heard about the free month of PlayStation Plus on home.
9233000	9234000	That's pretty awesome.
9234000	9248000	The best thing actually about it was it told me about Tekken Revolution, even though Tekken Revolution kind of sucked because it's one of those Facebook type-y games.
9248000	9249000	Oh, yeah.
9249000	9250000	That free-to-play Tekken game.
9250000	9252000	Free-to-play Tekken game we were talking about last week.
9252000	9253000	I forgot.
9253000	9254000	Yeah, it was supposed to come out.
9254000	9255000	That's too bad.
9255000	9263000	Yeah, my boyfriend was playing it because, you know, he wanted to play a new game and I said, well, why don't you try Tekken?
9263000	9267000	He got about four or five fights into it and then it stopped.
9267000	9270000	So, that's kind of sad.
9270000	9271000	Womp womp.
9271000	9277000	That was like me exploring, what was that god-awful MMO that's on PlayStation 3?
9277000	9278000	Free Realms?
9278000	9279000	Free.
9279000	9282000	God, what a stinker.
9282000	9285000	That's unfortunate.
9285000	9297000	So, I'm assuming if you actually do all the stuff in PlayStation Home and all that, you've been a little bit of a Sony fanboy or I shouldn't say the word fanboy because that has a negative connotation.
9297000	9299000	Actually, Sony fanboy is on my senior shirt.
9299000	9300000	Okay, then fine.
9300000	9301000	Sony fanboy.
9301000	9304000	So, you must have been eating this shit up at E3.
9304000	9309000	You must have just been like, this is the day I've been waiting for.
9309000	9312000	Xbox fans can go eat it today.
9312000	9316000	How are you feeling after Sony's press conference?
9316000	9327000	I actually feel really good because mostly Sony got the rights to, you know, Air, Final Fantasy XIV, XV, which is actually versus XIII.
9327000	9332000	And pretty much all the good stuff Square Enix is putting out.
9332000	9337000	And the last 25 minutes, it was pretty much Sony saying, suck it, Microsoft.
9337000	9341000	Yeah, it was pretty interesting.
9341000	9344000	So, no hope on you getting an Xbox One?
9344000	9346000	Absolutely not.
9346000	9350000	I have internet troubles and I do not.
9350000	9358000	Now, okay, since you said you're a Sony fanboy, I said earlier in the show, you know, I think Xbox's exclusives actually look a little better.
9358000	9364000	Even though I ended up ordering a PlayStation 4 because the overall picture, I think, is better for PlayStation 4.
9364000	9368000	And I'll get the Xbox One later when they sort out all their bullshit.
9368000	9378000	But what I want to ask you is, explain to me why I'm wrong.
9378000	9390000	Actually, I haven't really seen any exclusives for Xbox One that really, you know, kind of, I'd say, jump out at me as far as that goes.
9390000	9398000	But, I mean, the exclusives for PlayStation 4 are superior in a sense.
9398000	9403000	I mean, you know, you got...
9403000	9405000	I can't really think of any right now.
9405000	9409000	Yeah, I'm not really convinced right now.
9409000	9413000	I'm just giving you a hard time. I'm putting you on the spot. It ain't easy. It ain't easy.
9413000	9421000	Well, assuming you're buying a PlayStation 4 on day one, what are you most looking forward to? The Square Enix games or...?
9421000	9435000	The Square Enix games and Infamous Second Son because, spoiler alert, the end of the second one is kind of states why there's a whole new character and storyline and all that.
9435000	9441000	Fair enough. All right, well, anything else you want to get off your chest before we let you go?
9441000	9443000	Mirrors Edge 2 looks pretty.
9443000	9445000	Mirrors Edge 2 does look pretty. I think we can agree on that.
9445000	9447000	All right, thanks so much for the call, buddy.
9447000	9449000	Absolutely no problem.
9449000	9451000	Take care. Have a good one.
9451000	9455000	1877 Game OLR. Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
9455000	9461000	What the heck? We're getting call after call tonight. Lots of people wanted to comment on E3. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
9461000	9463000	Hey, this. I'm Deft.
9463000	9464000	Hey, Agdeft.
9464000	9465000	Hi, Agdeft.
9465000	9466000	How are you doing?
9466000	9467000	Pretty good.
9467000	9469000	What's on your mind, buddy?
9469000	9480000	Well, something that not many people are talking about Sony and Microsoft, that they're both doing, and it's pretty great in my opinion,
9480000	9495000	is that you only need to buy one subscription to PlayStation Plus and to Xbox One to everyone in the console or in your house to enjoy it.
9496000	9503000	Oh, so meaning that if you just have to have the one account and then you can have all the TVs in your house,
9503000	9506000	because I'm assuming they would all go back to the same IP at the end of the day,
9506000	9512000	can all kind of use that central account to do Netflix and all that.
9512000	9522000	Yeah, it's something that I find pretty useful because in my household, me and my brother do have each one on Xbox.
9522000	9528000	So we do have, like, I am the only one that has a gold account.
9528000	9536000	So in the future, if we decide either to get a PS4 or an Xbox One in this case,
9536000	9543000	it's pretty good that we only need to buy one subscription to enjoy the gold or Plus benefits.
9543000	9545000	Loki's wearing a question mark on his face right now.
9545000	9548000	I'm not sure if that's actually, if it's just going to be on the console or not,
9548000	9554000	because I know, like, if I have live gold on one of my accounts, like an account on my 360,
9554000	9559000	I can play multiplayer on that, but if I have a second account that's not live gold,
9559000	9565000	you know, I still can't play online with that. I have to have a separate live gold account for that.
9565000	9569000	And I know they have the family plans and got rid of it. I think it's just for one console.
9569000	9574000	Basically, one console, any of the accounts that are on there, you can play live on,
9574000	9578000	because it's tied to the console, not necessarily to your account.
9578000	9582000	I mean, it's still tied to your account, but it's also tied to that console.
9582000	9587000	Same with how the PlayStation 3, well, PlayStation 3 was, you know, free online,
9587000	9591000	but pretty much you can have as many PlayStation Network accounts as you wanted,
9591000	9593000	but I think they would kind of do it in a similar way.
9593000	9597000	I'm not sure if, I could be wrong because I haven't really read the details on it yet,
9597000	9602000	but I don't think that they're having it where, like, I buy Xbox Live gold or whatever,
9602000	9606000	and, you know, a sibling of mine has a separate console.
9606000	9609000	We can both play them live at the same time. I don't think it works that way.
9609000	9613000	Because otherwise, you know, what's to say if they're doing that 10 friend thing or whatever,
9613000	9618000	that I buy gold and then everybody else plays for free. I mean, I just don't think they're going to do that.
9618000	9625000	Yeah, I do think it's also just one console, but it's still pretty good,
9625000	9631000	because even right now, you have to buy a subscription for each account you have.
9631000	9638000	So with that, even if you cannot share it with another console, even in the same household,
9638000	9647000	having just buying one subscription instead of two or even three in some cases, it's pretty good.
9647000	9651000	Let me ask you this question, Akdeft, on kind of a little bit of a random tangent,
9651000	9656000	but obviously you call into the show quite a bit, and you're kind of known as our friendly neighborhood Mexican,
9656000	9659000	and you give a lot of perspective from living in Mexico,
9659000	9662000	and sometimes our perspectives are a little shifted here in the US,
9662000	9666000	because a lot of this stuff is really tailored for us here in the US, you know,
9666000	9672000	and to some extent, Britain and the immediate UK territories like Germany, France, Spain, and so on,
9672000	9679000	and Japan as well. How do these systems look from your perspective in Mexico?
9679000	9681000	Is Xbox One launching in Mexico?
9681000	9688000	Yeah, the Xbox One is launching in Mexico. Don't know if it's launching in November,
9688000	9698000	but it has a retail price. They're already launching pre-orders, and it's around 8,500 pesos,
9698000	9703000	which is around 600 or 700 dollars, I think.
9703000	9705000	Okay, and how does PlayStation 4 look?
9705000	9713000	And PlayStation 4 also seems that they're launching in November. I'm not sure at all,
9713000	9722000	but it looks like it, though it's launching for 1,000 pesos less, which is 7,500 pesos,
9722000	9730000	and dollars would be, I think, around 550 and 600 dollars.
9730000	9735000	So you're paying a premium similar to what our friends over across the Atlantic pay,
9735000	9739000	because in the European territories, it's a little bit higher as well.
9739000	9744000	Well, I mean, is this something, you've mentioned, you've crossed into America before
9744000	9747000	to sometimes buy things at a cheaper price with this stuff.
9747000	9750000	Is this something you're thinking about doing with the consoles, or no,
9750000	9753000	because you want to be able to play the download stuff, or?
9754000	9762000	Maybe I will, because at least Microsoft, something that has done in the past, even with the 360,
9762000	9772000	is that it has most of the digital content on par with the US, at least most of it.
9772000	9778000	Though the Xbox One doesn't look as appealing as the PS4 right now,
9778000	9782000	because the Xbox TV stuff won't work here.
9783000	9788000	At least not at launch, and I don't think it will work even in the first year.
9788000	9793000	So that is a feature that won't be used here,
9793000	9799000	and so the console will probably mostly be used as a gaming console,
9799000	9801000	and it's way too expensive.
9801000	9805000	Though, on the other hand, a Wii U costs the same.
9805000	9809000	And if you're going to live in Mexico, you've got to be able to watch the telenovelas,
9809000	9812000	because that, those are the bomb.
9812000	9817000	No way, it's all about lucha libre. Forget the drama, I like watching the wrestlers.
9817000	9824000	No, well it used to be all about sabarogicante, but that's gone now, if I am not mistaken.
9824000	9826000	They finally pulled that.
9826000	9831000	So telenovelas, they show some of them here, and they're great.
9831000	9834000	I like watching the wrestlers, they are absolutely fun.
9835000	9838000	I have a spicy telenovela, so no comments.
9839000	9842000	Alright, ActDeaf, thank you so much for the perspective, we appreciate it.
9842000	9844000	Have a good one, okay?
9844000	9845000	You too, thanks for having me.
9845000	9847000	No problem, any time, bye.
9847000	9851000	1877 GameOLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
9851000	9854000	You know what's interesting, I didn't even ask ActDeaf about Nintendo at all,
9854000	9856000	and he's such a big Kirby fan.
9856000	9859000	I know he must have been squeaking at the Kirby in the Smash Brothers trailer.
9859000	9862000	I mean, duh, Kirby's going to be in a Smash Brothers game,
9862000	9864000	but I'm sure he was excited to see that.
9864000	9867000	I think we can squeeze in one more call, if somebody wants to try and get it.
9867000	9870000	It was just lighting up a minute ago, so we'll try to squeeze in one more.
9870000	9873000	We're just after 9 o'clock, but we've got a little bit of a late start tonight,
9873000	9876000	and we had a really awkward beginning here live,
9876000	9880000	which I'm going to edit out all that dead air for the podcast, sorry, but it was weird.
9880000	9882000	Alright, we've got at least one more call coming in, so let's try to take it.
9882000	9884000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
9884000	9886000	Hey, this is Tiki.
9886000	9887000	Hey, what's up?
9887000	9894000	Hey, not much. I just want to say one thing and ask a question for Doc Sakura.
9894000	9895000	Oh?
9895000	9896000	Okay.
9896000	9899000	Sony 1E3, that's it for me.
9901000	9905000	That's it, huh? There's nothing, there's nothing, no convincing you otherwise.
9905000	9907000	Sony 1E3, huh?
9907000	9912000	Like, the way that Microsoft handled their DRM, they treat you like you're a criminal,
9912000	9915000	and that's, no, there's no way.
9915000	9919000	They're alienating their audience, plain and simple.
9919000	9922000	Alright, what's your question for Doc Sakura, and then I'm going to throw you a curveball.
9922000	9926000	Okay, um, I saw, like, the trailer for...
9928000	9933000	He likes the trailer for, you just cut out, The Joys of Live Radio.
9933000	9941000	Okay, um, I saw the trailer for Final Fantasy XIV, Realm Reborn, on the PS3.
9941000	9944000	What's the game play like on the, since you're in the closed beta?
9944000	9950000	I'm not playing it on PS3, I'm playing it on PC, and it's pretty much standard, you know, Momofare.
9950000	9957000	It's, uh, you know, what I like about the combat in the game is that you don't have to stop to loot,
9957000	9959000	it will automatically auto-loot.
9959000	9967000	Um, you actually get to choose, I mean, well, they've sort of incorporated this in Mists of Pandaria lately,
9967000	9973000	is actually getting, um, items from doing quests that are for your class specifically,
9973000	9976000	as opposed to getting just everybody's stuff.
9976000	9983000	Um, I'd like, um, the server that we're on is pretty crowded, I'll go ahead and say that right now,
9983000	9984000	I don't like that so much.
9984000	9991000	But, um, it's really fun, the game is smooth, even if you have a little bit of slowdown,
9991000	9997000	it's not like a really horrible lag, you don't find yourself being stuck anywhere, if that makes sense.
9997000	10004000	And, uh, the whole fate system, I enjoy that, basically you have these big group battles that give you extra experience.
10004000	10010000	There's really just a lot of positive to be said about it, and on top of that, it looks like, you know,
10010000	10018000	whereas even with the current graphical updates on World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy XIV looks like a new game.
10019000	10022000	It looks and plays like a new game.
10022000	10028000	The gameplay from it looks like, kinda looks like a, on par with Guild Wars 2 graphically.
10028000	10033000	I would say so, and on top of that, you know, keep in mind the last time I played Final Fantasy XI,
10033000	10038000	was in its original sort of play style with your group dynamics.
10038000	10042000	The group dynamics in this are a lot different, I think I like it a lot better.
10042000	10047000	Is it still like our Grand Fest, like it is in XI in the beginning?
10047000	10049000	I haven't noticed any problems grinding.
10049000	10050000	Okay.
10050000	10053000	Yeah, I'm enjoying it, I'm enjoying it a lot.
10053000	10059000	Actually, I hate being under NDA for saying stuff about the last beta,
10059000	10064000	but the improvements that they're making are noticeable and very good.
10064000	10066000	It's gonna be a really rich game when it boots.
10066000	10071000	I might try it out on my first MMO on the PS3.
10071000	10075000	Well, I can't speak for how it plays on the PS3,
10075000	10079000	because I play on a PC just because of the problems with my hands,
10079000	10084000	but I enjoy it, that's all I can say, I like it.
10084000	10086000	Shane would vouch for it.
10086000	10088000	Yes he will, yes he will.
10088000	10092000	Shane would probably jump up and down on a trampoline saying how much he likes it, but you know.
10092000	10096000	Alright, here's the curveball I wanted to throw at you before you guys got on Final Fantasy XIV.
10096000	10098000	No, no, this is important, because this is for a lot of people,
10098000	10104000	because everybody's turned E3 into Sony versus Microsoft, Sony versus Microsoft, da-da-da-da-da.
10104000	10106000	Where does Nintendo sit with you?
10106000	10107000	That's my curveball.
10107000	10109000	Where does Nintendo sit right now?
10109000	10114000	Funny you should ask that, I actually watched the Nintendo Direct the day of,
10114000	10117000	on that day that they streamed it,
10117000	10123000	and what my general overall feeling for that is,
10123000	10127000	2014 is the year that we, for me.
10127000	10131000	So, in other words, it's kind of one of my earlier tweets I'd put out there was like,
10131000	10136000	boy, Nintendo's sure setting up a great season for 2014, too bad about this year.
10136000	10141000	Yeah, it's like there's nothing really that catches my eye, this year at all.
10141000	10144000	There's the Mario game, the Mario 3D game looks great,
10144000	10149000	but I mean, the Donkey Kong game, again, Donkey Kong's a solid platformer,
10149000	10154000	but I think that's the problem, you've got two platformers with Mario and Donkey Kong.
10154000	10160000	Yeah, I kind of wish they'd gone a different direction, but they could have done a lot worse.
10160000	10167000	I guess there's nothing hardcore for me to play, that's why I like playing.
10167000	10171000	So platformers are the party games.
10171000	10173000	Alright buddy, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show,
10173000	10175000	but do you have any other final thoughts?
10175000	10177000	No, that's it.
10177000	10179000	Alright, thank you, have a good one.
10179000	10180000	You too.
10180000	10181000	Alright, bye-bye.
10181000	10183000	Alright, that's going to do it for the Skypline tonight,
10183000	10185000	I'm sorry to those of you that didn't get through tonight,
10185000	10187000	but I do have this very important update.
10187000	10190000	According to Tigerclaw, and I went to the wiki to verify it,
10190000	10192000	Sabado Higante is still on the air.
10192000	10196000	I thought they were canceling it in 2011 or 2012,
10196000	10200000	but no, it celebrated its 50th anniversary on October 27th, 2012.
10200000	10208000	They have some new co-hosts, but maybe they just stopped carrying it here locally or something,
10208000	10209000	but that would seem weird.
10209000	10213000	I think a show that's as old as that, it wouldn't stop.
10213000	10216000	I guess I'm just not watching enough Mexican TV,
10216000	10219000	but for what it's worth, I don't watch enough American TV either,
10219000	10221000	so at least that's equal.
10221000	10223000	Alright, well there's your very important update.
10223000	10224000	Thank you to the chatters.
10224000	10227000	Alright, that's it for the Skypline tonight.
10227000	10229000	I got to get to some of these tweets we were getting,
10229000	10231000	because we were getting some good tweets.
10231000	10236000	And Loki, I always like to put a call out for last minute stories if you have anything.
10236000	10243000	Yeah, real quick, I was going to mention that, well, it's kind of funny,
10243000	10246000	we talk about porn a lot on this show,
10246000	10253000	and one of the things that they're looking to bring to the Oculus Rift, porn.
10253000	10259000	And it's actually being done by this startup studio.
10259000	10265000	The game's called Wicked Paradise, and they're getting funding for it right now,
10265000	10271000	but they're trying to make, I guess, a game that will get people horny.
10271000	10273000	Genuinely horny.
10273000	10275000	Wow.
10275000	10278000	Yeah, so they've got information on that.
10278000	10281000	So I thought that was kind of funny.
10281000	10285000	And then I forgot to mention in the releases this week,
10285000	10292000	a new Luigi U is going to be on the eShop this week.
10292000	10297000	Yeah, when I heard about that, I was like, oh, yeah, that is real soon.
10297000	10299000	So, pretty neat.
10299000	10302000	Let me get to some of the tweets here real quick.
10302000	10308000	sj100matt tweeted us about comedian Lewis Black talking about Xbox One and Google Glass on the Daily Show.
10308000	10310000	I have seen that YouTube floating around.
10310000	10313000	Because I was out of town, I haven't watched it yet.
10313000	10317000	DarkSakura, some folks saying it should be maybe a fortune cookie in a future week.
10317000	10319000	Because I know you do like Lewis Black, so check that out.
10319000	10321000	Yeah, I love Lewis Black.
10322000	10328000	Let's see, we got a tweet here from Ionotropic who notices that storm is heading his way.
10328000	10330000	The one that got Bobby.
10330000	10332000	So stay safe.
10332000	10334000	Unplug stuff if you want.
10334000	10340000	Let's see, DarkTetsuya says Bemani may be dead in the States, but it lives on in Japan.
10340000	10344000	BeatMania 2DX21's Spada is on location test.
10344000	10346000	And they said they weren't doing it anymore.
10346000	10351000	Please tell me that somebody is saying this is Spada.
10351000	10353000	Please tell me that's a joke.
10353000	10354000	Somebody?
10354000	10356000	Alright, fair enough.
10356000	10361000	Let's see, Act F tweeting us that Pacman CEDX is coming to Steam.
10361000	10365000	I did not know. That's kind of cool. I think that would be a fun game to play on PC.
10365000	10369000	Is that part of that PC? No, I guess it's a separate thing.
10369000	10375000	Tigerclaw tweeting us, Sega launching a new Sonic the Hedgehog series titled Sonic Boom.
10375000	10381000	It's by the creators of My Little Pony Friendship is Magic. Oh God. Oh man.
10381000	10382000	Don't care anymore.
10382000	10387000	That's some fandom skill. You gotta give it at least a chance. You gotta try at least one episode, DarkSakura.
10387000	10388000	You gotta try it before you know it's really-
10388000	10389000	I did. It was stupid.
10389000	10392000	No, I'm not talking about My Little Pony. I'm talking about Sonic Boom.
10392000	10394000	Oh, maybe.
10394000	10397000	That does- Are we sure that's legit? Are we sure that's legit?
10397000	10401000	Because that does sound a little bit fan wanky. I'm just saying. I'm just saying. Alright.
10402000	10409000	And lastly, Rama tweeting us a story about Tekken producer Katsuhiro Harada missing.
10409000	10416000	But actually, I think this was on our show roll last week but got bumped because of all the Microsoft news that was happening.
10416000	10422000	I want to say there was a late-breaking update that he kind of just ran away for a little bit.
10422000	10425000	But he's fine. He's safe. Don't worry. He's okay.
10425000	10426000	What about the other dude?
10426000	10427000	Which one?
10427000	10432000	The guy that was Knuckles Dasa was?
10432000	10436000	We haven't heard an update on him. I don't think. Thank you for asking.
10439000	10444000	I'm gonna look. I don't know. I haven't heard.
10446000	10447000	That's too bad.
10449000	10450000	Oh well.
10450000	10457000	I'm actually trying to find real quick where that Facebook is that might have an update.
10458000	10462000	Live radio, guys, while I try to find this.
10464000	10465000	Trying to see if there's anything-
10465000	10467000	We're talking about Mexican wrestling now.
10467000	10468000	Really?
10468000	10469000	What the hell?
10469000	10470000	There it is.
10471000	10479000	Unfortunately, I'm looking at- and the website is, if you want more information on this, findknuckles.com.
10479000	10486000	And they say that they're still out searching as often as they can when weather permits over the past week.
10486000	10490000	They went out to Bowen Island. These are some places around Vancouver and so forth.
10490000	10492000	So unfortunately, it sounds like he's still missing.
10492000	10499000	So guys, especially if you're in the Pacific Northwest, and that goes double if you're in the Vancouver area, please check out findknuckles.com.
10499000	10504000	It's gonna redirect you to a Facebook page, but just trying to get the latest on that.
10508000	10509000	Boy oh boy.
10514000	10517000	Let me see if I have any other tweet stories here.
10517000	10522000	I don't think so, but I'm giving private messages.
10524000	10527000	I'm getting told to take Sonic Boom with a grain of salt.
10528000	10533000	Stay tuned for Anime Jam Session for all the latest on that. They'll tell you what is going on there.
10533000	10536000	People are welcome to like what they like.
10536000	10537000	That's right.
10537000	10539000	I don't have to like it.
10539000	10541000	I got sent this story here.
10541000	10546000	Microsoft looking into playing games offline on Xbox One.
10546000	10547000	Oh, sure they are.
10547000	10553000	That was the one that, if I remember correctly, this is the one that's from the NeoGaf thing where someone had proposed,
10553000	10556000	hey, you can have it so that it's optional so that, you know.
10556000	10561000	Oh, the Major Nelson thing where he tweeted or whatever saying, yes, we could do that.
10561000	10563000	It's possible. I think that's what this is.
10563000	10565000	Here's the thing with this story.
10565000	10568000	Anything is, there's gonna be a lot of discussions after E3.
10568000	10575000	You know, Microsoft, Microsoft really thought they were doing the right thing here.
10575000	10580000	You know, and I think that's one thing I might have neglected to say in the beginning, so if, you know, I missed that, then I'm sorry.
10580000	10586000	But Microsoft, I think in their minds, as twisted as it is, is trying to do the right thing.
10586000	10594000	And go back to what I said earlier about they think that people want an Apple-like device, not necessarily the same thing they saw with 360.
10594000	10601000	And that's the huge difference you heard in their press conferences was that, you know, when Jack Trenton was there stabbing Microsoft in the jugular,
10601000	10605000	he said, we know that gamers like it just the way they are.
10605000	10609000	When you hear what Microsoft is saying, no, gamers want something different.
10609000	10613000	So in their mind, whether they're right or wrong, they're doing the right thing here.
10613000	10618000	So a lot can change.
10618000	10625000	I kind of think it's too late to reverse course and backpedal for this holiday season, and I think they're gonna pay for it, but you never know.
10625000	10627000	A lot can happen. We'll see what happens.
10627000	10630000	But I think it goes without saying anything is possible.
10630000	10636000	But don't expect anything next week, because there's gonna be a lot of board meetings and a lot of conferences that happen
10636000	10640000	and a lot of consulting that happens over the next and focus groups.
10640000	10644000	I would say you're not going to hear anything for about three months,
10644000	10648000	although they need to get something out a lot sooner if they want to get more preorders to the holiday season.
10648000	10654000	But technically they could do it right up until the day it's out and still sell a lot of them.
10654000	10657000	We'll see. Anything's possible.
10657000	10665000	OK, I'm just looking at stuff in the chat at live.vognetwork.com.
10665000	10667000	The chat room is all over the place.
10667000	10668000	Yeah, all over the place.
10668000	10673000	Akuma JP says, an Apple-like device. Xbox One looks like my grandpa's VCR.
10673000	10675000	Betamax!
10675000	10679000	Shadow Next Gen says, Microsoft could do something at PAX Prime since it's in their backyard.
10679000	10683000	You know, Bobby and I were talking about that a little bit in the car or at Disneyland. I wanted to.
10683000	10685000	We had some time together talking about all this stuff.
10686000	10696000	And yeah, actually that was brought up that PAX Prime would be a very good place to make your case directly to the gamers
10696000	10699000	that you seem to have ruffled feathers with.
10699000	10701000	It's going to be a very interesting PAX Prime.
10701000	10703000	Too bad we're all going to Dragon Con.
10703000	10712000	We'll be following everything on Twitter and news and all that stuff as it goes on.
10712000	10718000	Alright, that's it. We're about to the end of the show. It's been a very, very busy night tonight.
10718000	10724000	So I think it's about time we wrap up and take it back to the other shows here, The Voice Geeks Network
10724000	10727000	and our big 11th birthday show next week.
10727000	10731000	Any other last minute stories before we get to that?
10731000	10733000	Nope.
10734000	10746000	There's a small thing. There's some people being suspended from eSports or whatever for some Dota 2 match fixing.
10746000	10751000	I guess it's allegedly that one team bet against themselves and threw the match.
10751000	10755000	Apparently. And now they're banned.
10755000	10757000	Some people.
10757000	10761000	All for about a $100 bet.
10761000	10763000	Well, cheating's cheating.
10763000	10767000	Alright, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
10767000	10772000	Hey, if you enjoyed the show tonight and if you disagree with us wholeheartedly,
10772000	10774000	thank you for sticking with it for three hours.
10774000	10781000	But if you think we're not being fair to Microsoft or maybe being too fair to Microsoft or Sony or Nintendo,
10781000	10783000	send us your feedback.
10783000	10786000	It is a show where every gamer has a voice and we're interested in what you have to say.
10786000	10789000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is our email address.
10789000	10792000	Or you can also reach out to us on Twitter at Twitter.com slash O-L-R
10792000	10796000	or post on our Facebook page at Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio.
10796000	10800000	We do read all of it even if we don't always respond to it right away.
10800000	10806000	And we thank you guys for your support and especially with all the bullshit that's going on
10806000	10810000	with Bobby's house getting hit by lightning right now which really sucks.
10811000	10816000	The way you guys are really banding together in chat just really shows why this network is an amazing place
10816000	10820000	and I'm really happy to have you all as a part of it going into next week's birthday show.
10820000	10822000	I think that's a great thing to keep in mind.
10822000	10825000	We will be back to do it all again next week with our 11th birthday.
10825000	10830000	JV Mohn will be here in the house in the East Coast representing New York City peeps.
10830000	10832000	I really need to get back to New York City.
10832000	10834000	I want to go.
10834000	10835000	I know.
10835000	10837000	I haven't been since I was a senior in high school.
10837000	10838000	I haven't been in a while either.
10838000	10842000	But anyway, let's go around and get everybody's final thought before we wrap up tonight.
10842000	10848000	My final thought tonight is I need to download and play Marvel Heroes this week
10848000	10850000	because I keep hearing about it and I keep forgetting to play it.
10850000	10852000	So I will play it this week.
10852000	10853000	Yes, I know, DarkSakura.
10853000	10855000	But I want to give it a try for myself.
10855000	10857000	Loki, your final thought tonight?
10857000	10858000	Hopefully my...
10858000	10864000	I've got these, what is it, Ethernet Overpower adapters that I'm getting
10864000	10868000	so that I can hook up my PlayStation 3 to the front room TV
10868000	10872000	instead of having to have to drag a 50-foot Ethernet cable into that room
10872000	10877000	because remember, I have a launched 20-gig system that doesn't have Wi-Fi.
10877000	10878000	Yeah.
10878000	10881000	So hopefully that will come soon so I can do that.
10881000	10885000	And I need to download and install and play Final Fantasy XIV.
10885000	10889000	Lastly and certainly not leastly, DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?
10889000	10891000	The sore throat.
10891000	10892000	Aw.
10892000	10896000	It started during the mailbag and I will try not to breathe on anybody just in case.

10899000	10900000	I'd like a lozenge.
10900000	10901000	Or both.
10901000	10902000	Sadly, I don't have any.
10902000	10905000	But I could totally do Jewish mother voice now.
10905000	10906000	All right.
10906000	10907000	That does it.

10984000	10985000	Be quiet.
10985000	10986000	I wasn't ready for you.
10986000	10988000	I guess that thing was looping.
10988000	10991000	We gotta get to our fortune cookie message of the day.
10991000	10995000	I've had such a long day today.

11001000	11002000	Early bedtime for Rob.
11002000	11005000	It wasn't a super funny show, but I felt the discussion was good.
11005000	11007000	It can't always be dick and fart jokes.
11007000	11008000	We had a lot of fun.
11008000	11009000	It can't always be dick and fart jokes.
11009000	11010000	We had a lot happen.
11010000	11011000	Yeah.
11011000	11012000	So thank you guys.
11012000	11013000	You guys really contributed to that.
11013000	11014000	All right.
11014000	11015000	Let's get to the fortune cookie message of the day, guys.
