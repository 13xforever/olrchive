14244	15044	Thank you for watching.
15064	15825	See you next time.
32537	37818	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37878	41019	It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 508.
41379	43119	For this, June the 16th of 2013.
44439	47260	My name is Rob Roberts, here with you every week with my co-host.
47300	50541	Say hello first off to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
50701	52221	Thank you for the coffee, it's delicious.
52241	54021	You're welcome, you caffeinated and ready to go?
54421	54722	Oh yes.
54862	55542	Big show tonight.
55582	57102	Also say hello to TechMasterLoki.
57282	57542	Hi.
57722	59082	Sorry to hear about the Minecraft server.
59843	59963	Eh.
61083	61883	Meh, meh, meh.
63072	64072	We'll get into that later.
65313	68854	It was a huge week this week, and we're not going to fuck around.
68874	70334	We're just going to get right into it tonight.
70414	76216	So honestly, probably one of those huge historical moments in gaming this week.
76296	78397	Let's relive this moment real quick.
78777	91201	In addition to creating an amazing library of new titles on PlayStation 4, we're equally focused on delivering what gamers want most without imposing restrictions or devaluing their PS4 purchases.
92233	97716	For instance, PlayStation 4 won't impose any new restrictions on the use of PO4 gamers.
97756	111904	Listen to how long that applause goes on.
113945	116166	That's not just the fanboys in the upper ring.
116586	119088	That's the journalists, too, who can't contain themselves.
120548	121509	Guess that's a good thing.
123979	129524	We believe in the model that people embrace today with PlayStation 3 and continue to demand.
130144	130945	Just heard you there.
131365	135609	When a gamer buys a PS4 disc, they have the rights to use that copy of the game.
136130	142555	They can trade in the game at retail, sell it to another person, lend it to a friend, or keep it forever.
143296	143756	Bullet.
144497	144837	Bullet.
145398	145838	Bullet.
146419	146879	Bullet.
147039	148400	That was... wow.
155740	157461	Some guy standing and cheering there.
157481	158341	Sit down, fanboy.
160662	169626	Well, and don't forget over at the Microsoft area where they're watching, this enormous sound of which was a million hands moving.
170146	174268	PlayStation 4 disc-based games don't need to be connected online to play.
186849	189090	or for any type of authentication.
189871	196154	If you enjoy playing single player games offline, PS4 won't require you to check in online periodically.
204039	207580	And it won't stop working if you haven't authenticated within 24 hours.
209489	210070	Sick burn.
226772	255020	and the show is turning 11 next week and all the years I've been watching E3 that closely I have never seen anything like that where one company systematically takes down the policies of another like not since the Sega I mean I remember back in the Sega Nintendo days things would get ugly you know Genesis does when Nintendo don't and even the TurboGrafx you know Blast Processing yeah does all this stuff I mean like you know they used to be at each other's throats a lot more not saying that in the modern era it's been civil but everybody kind of stays off each other's toes this
255740	257163	This was huge!
257363	261310	And then, and then they're like, oh hey, you like this cake right here?
261710	263554	Well then I got some icing for you too!
264773	265213	That's right.
265333	266634	We're only going to be $3.99.
267035	269176	Dear Microsoft, these are your cornflakes.
269237	270177	Watch as we piss in them.
270257	286170	So, like many of you out there, DarkSakura and I were watching this together and honestly, during this part of the press conference, my jaw's on the floor because I did not expect, well, like many of you, and we even said it on the show last week, we expected Sony to go down a similar path.
286330	288231	Never in my life have I been happier to be wrong.
289773	292755	I think I go on record saying that I didn't think that
293633	295654	Don't make me dig up the archive of last week's show.
296714	298995	I said I wasn't sure, but I didn't think they would.
300036	301517	Well, it is what it is.
302017	306339	They didn't go down that same path, and many would say they won E3 because of it.
307019	310440	And never mind the negatives in Sony's press conference.
310460	312041	I'm not trying to sound like a fanboy here.
312081	315983	I will get to some of the positives of Microsoft's in a minute here because, yes, I do believe there are some positives.
316283	317324	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
340903	350926	Um, you know, Sony addressed the things that the people on the internet really wanted to hear the most about and got everybody talking because of it.
350946	361710	And actually what's kind of funny is I think, if I remember correctly, in between the whole talking about their policies and stuff like that and the price point, wasn't there like, oh, by the way, here's Final Fantasy 15.
362030	364191	Oh, and Kingdom Hearts 3, you know, that type of thing.
364591	368353	Yeah, and going to our chat room, I always have to acknowledge the live folks.
368393	376278	We do tape live every Sunday night, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
376298	382102	We have our live chatter, Shadow Next Gen in chat saying, Sony did a masterful job of misleading people in that conference.
382162	384123	I give Sony PR a huge amount of credit.
385004	389428	Yeah, things like Kingdom Hearts 3, Final Fantasy 15, again, Jaws on the floor.
389488	390629	Those weren't exclusive games.
391149	392030	We all know that now.
392450	400678	And they never said they were exclusive games, but now we associate that with PlayStation 4 because those guys were on stage at the Sony press conference.
400718	405502	And there's many, I think there are many people that are like, where they were meant to be played.
405522	406023	Yeah.
407099	411685	Well, and then PlayStation Plus, too, is, you know, Ross Steele was saying $5 a month.
411725	415349	It's actually cheaper than that because it's $40 or $50 a year.
416070	419755	So it's even cheaper than Xbox Live Gold.
420115	423159	Which, what would $50 get you on Gold?
423199	423359	What?
425960	426540	It's close.
426740	427440	It's about the same.
427460	429241	How much is gold per month?
429281	430241	I thought it was more than that.
430261	436462	To be fair, Microsoft tried to raise the bar at their own press conference by saying we're going to start giving away games with an Xbox Gold subscription.
436522	437602	Fable 3 is already up.
437943	443804	And then they announced, what, Halo 3 and Assassin's Creed 2, which I know a lot of you guys are like, snore, I already own those games.
443824	448625	But here's the thing, though, and it's only up until the Xbox One launches, though, not afterwards.
448705	449985	So it's kind of lame.
450465	458449	It's cool if you're buying a 360 for like Grand Theft Auto 5 or something like that and you get your one month free of gold and you can go download all these extra games.
458509	460850	I mean, that's kind of cool.
461050	471514	Here's the thing too is that what a way Sony has come from 2006 when they were the laughing stock of E3, right?
471574	476016	Remember 599 US dollars attacked the crab's weak point for massive damage.
476296	477297	They did make a joke about that.
478117	480158	Oh yeah, oh yeah, then the guy had that joke about that.
480678	483019	And then, what does Sony do in their press conference?
483119	485480	Attacks Microsoft's weak points for massive damage.
485680	486100	Literally.
486420	487460	That's what happened.
487580	495283	I seriously thought when they announced that the price point was $4.99, when Microsoft did that, it was kind of like, here's Sony's press conference all over again.
495763	513370	And the biggest thing that really, in my opinion, even bigger than the Press Conference, sticking it to Microsoft, was that YouTube that instantly showed up, floating around with the two guys, Yoshida and the other guy from PlayStation, doing the tutorial on how to share used games.
514051	518072	I don't see shade like that thrown outside of an episode of RuPaul's Drag Race.
518913	521053	That was some massive shade on Sony's part.
521794	522194	Bravo.
523038	528602	Well, and then, of course, you know, it immediately was turned into a series of animated GIFs for the internet.
530204	534247	Oh, I'm sorry, just, Tumblr has been hilarious.
534447	534787	All week.
535267	537189	All because of seeing everything being repeated.
538081	539782	Let's go back to Microsoft for a minute.
560834	567938	This is the game right here that was supposed to be Fuse, but Fuse ended up being some generic third-person shooter.
567998	575961	Now, this is the game that, I guess, not Fuse, it was Overstrike, I think what it was.
577522	582043	It was supposed to be Overstrike, but now it's this game, and it looks pretty sweet.
582343	592186	It's like this very stylized... It reminded me a lot of that Unreal 4 demo, or I guess it's not a demo, it's an actual game, Unreal 4 game, Fortnite.
593567	598608	Kind of reminded me of that, versus zombies and stuff, but very stylized.
599028	599709	So that looked cool.
601290	603091	Dead Rising 3, I guess, looks alright.
603932	608515	I'm not a huge fan of the shift in tone in the game to more serious.
608636	611057	It's kind of eh.
612158	616201	I guess Mirror's Edge, but that wasn't necessarily at their conference.
616221	622406	That was more of EA's, but Mirror's Edge looks awesome.
622426	622766	Yeah.
624528	646001	and then not really actually even part of their conference at all but more clarification on their policy stuff that 10 friend sharing thing where you can have different circles of friends and basically you know I buy a copy of like fours of five or something like that and I can play the game at the same time as one of my friends can play the game off of my library that I'm sharing so that's kind of cool and that you can share a bunch of games but at the same time it's like
647472	647832	DarkSakura.com
678232	678512	I don't know.
678572	679753	It's kind of a weird strategy.
680553	686576	I'm going to say something nice about Microsoft that I actually might get a little bit of shit for because I'm sure not everybody will agree with me.
686616	691058	But I actually thought overall their exclusives looked better than the PlayStation 4 exclusives.
691718	702163	Yet I walked out of there still pre-ordering a PlayStation 4 because I think the third-party stuff that is on both systems combined with everything we already got into last week about what I don't like about Microsoft's DRM.
702183	703043	But what was exclusive?
704103	731593	on Microsoft Killer Instinct which I realize is getting its own bit but I'm interested enough Quantum Break looked great the game that you just checked the Sunset Overdrive looks really good Halo 5 I know not everybody's into first person shooters but I do like Halo games so I'm here for Halo and there was one other one that's escaping me right now oh the Crimson Dragon Panzer Dragoon
732213	732734	and DarkSakura.com.
743402	744783	I'm not really into Infamous.
745203	746084	They all look okay.
746564	767138	I'll play them, but I'm not as excited as I was for maybe the Xbox One exclusives, but what's really selling me is A, the fact that I will own my games on Sony and that whole takedown, and B, the third-party stuff is what I'm really here for, the Kingdom Hearts and a lot of this other stuff that is going to end up being on both consoles.
768139	771621	Final Fantasy XIV, I'll probably end up picking up on PlayStation 4 and so on and so on.
776664	798975	let's talk about well actually I want to say too I don't think the $4.99 price is as bad as everyone's making it out to be granted Sony stuck it to them with the $3.99 price I think they were I think they were it had a huge advantage by going second that they probably had three or four PowerPoint slides ready to go with whatever would undercut Microsoft and that's what they pulled out of their hat
799695	809824	I think also that the really big negative is that whole thing with listening, especially with the whole NSA scandal going out right about now.
810124	814688	Absolutely, which we did touch on that a little bit last week, which still hasn't really been resolved.
815649	815849	Loki?
816129	817751	Well, I was going to say one thing.
817952	824681	Speaking of having Kinect 2.0 or whatever bundled with the system, they didn't really show me any reason.
824942	827926	In fact, they pretty much didn't show any games that utilize Kinect.
828567	832032	I don't know if they had a trailer for Fantasia during their conference, but...
832772	839513	Um, you know, even the games that were supposed to be for Kinect originally, Rise, for example, is now a regular controlled game.
839833	842494	That Crimson Dragon game is supposed to be a Kinect game.
842814	845374	Now it's just, you know, it uses a regular controller.
845735	850535	It's like all these games now are sidestepping the use of Kinect, yet they're saying, oh, this is integral.
850575	853776	You need to have Kinect in there for, for what reason?
853836	856497	You're not using it in these games in a meaningful way.
856917	858077	That's my problem with it.
859037	865699	Let's talk about where Microsoft fucked up because there's a couple key points that really is just fucking them up.
866979	868639	And it's not even just the DRM thing.
868659	870100	I mean, obviously, that's one of them.
870600	877782	But I think the big thing with that is that Microsoft honestly thinks they're trying to be progressive with this.
877842	881643	And there was a really great interview that came out about this.
881743	886384	And the interview was with Phil Spencer, who I think kind of knows a little better how to talk to the media and so forth.
887204	888184	and he talks about this.
888244	888945	He says, quote,
909870	917677	Frankly, if you're on the PC or a Steam customer or an App Store customer on iOS devices, this is how you think about your library of content.
918057	920519	That's mistake number one Microsoft made.
920699	924403	They believe their competition with this device is Apple, which...
925423	940634	is fair Apple's a huge dominating thing everybody wants a piece of that somebody wants to take them down but while Microsoft had their eyes on Apple and we're going to copy all these things people do because people eat this Apple shit up while Microsoft had their eyes fixated on that
940874	943495	They failed to recognize what was coming up right behind them.
944155	946416	Why did they fail to recognize what was coming up right behind them?
946516	952799	Because my digital library of Xbox Live Arcade games is unable to move with me to the next system.
953439	954280	It's stuck behind.
954340	955940	Same with my current library of games.
956100	957901	I can't move with the new system.
958021	964244	Whereas on the PlayStation 4, once the Gaikai service launches, I will be able to move with my digital purchases.
965084	966024	Or at least some of them.
966124	968165	And it will probably slowly roll out.
968385	969486	Here's the other problem.
970206	992776	and I believe this to be a way bigger deal than some of you may think but I think Microsoft made a huge mistake getting rid of all their community outreach people which they did some time ago remember when they got rid of all the people that were doing the Xbox TV thing and they got rid of the Gamerscore blog and they got rid of a lot of their community outreach people oops, Microsoft forgot how to talk to the community
993903	994564	and DarkSakura.
1018303	1019764	Hey, you have shitty internet?
1019784	1021626	iOS games are also 99 cents.
1021806	1022267	Sorry, Loki.
1022307	1023808	And if you have shitty internet, you buy a 360.
1023868	1028432	That's our option for you because the Xbox One needs to be connected.
1028913	1030014	Or if you're in another country.
1030294	1031135	Yes, or another country.
1031195	1033537	And here's the other great thing about that, too.
1033817	1038722	He was like, well, you have to understand, you know, you're not going to buy a cell phone if you don't have cell service.
1039823	1041585	The problem is your device...
1044155	1048118	It's not a device that... I don't buy internet so that my game console works.
1048438	1053462	A phone, you buy to access the phone network.
1055023	1059686	Internet's used for your PC, for TV stuff, for your phone, for whatever.
1060106	1063129	It's a multi... It's like saying, well, you don't...
1063629	1064110	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1081349	1087271	Also, he comes out and sounds like a complete, or I forget who it was, Phil Spencer, I think, comes out and sounds like a complete jackass.
1087852	1089312	You know, he's like, I don't even know.
1089372	1096015	He was talking about like, you know, oh, you know, someone was telling me that their friend works on a, you know, nuclear sub and stuff.
1096115	1097236	I don't even know what that means.
1097256	1098936	Actually, I was going to bring that up next.
1098996	1101917	That was a huge faux pas on Microsoft's part.
1101937	1103518	That was Don Matrick, actually, that said that.
1103538	1103958	Don Matrick.
1104318	1105399	And I predict...
1106380	1111857	he will be replaced within 365 days because somebody's gonna take the fall for this crap and it's gonna be him
1113641	1117482	He will be replaced within 365 days because somebody's going to take the fall for this.
1117802	1118522	And it's going to be him.
1118942	1120543	And I'm sorry, Xbox fanboys.
1120583	1124464	I know there's many of you saying, oh, they could still win the holiday season.
1124964	1126164	I honestly don't think so.
1126224	1127605	They've already lost the holidays.
1127945	1129325	It's too late to reverse course.
1129665	1131826	Corporations don't know how to talk off script.
1132226	1135727	It's going to take a miracle for Microsoft to pull out the holiday at this point.
1136207	1139848	Xbox fans, your biggest sticking point right now, honestly, A,
1140908	1146852	Ask a Nintendo fan how to deal with six months of bullshit coming from the internet because, you know, you can take comfort with them.
1146892	1147973	But we'll get to Nintendo in a minute.
1148573	1157299	And B, stick to the exclusives because that's the big thing that Microsoft has going for it right now is that you won't be able to play a lot of that stuff.
1157399	1159420	Halo 5 is huge and you won't be able to play it anywhere else.
1159440	1167526	Well, and on top of that too, like, you know, these retailers or whatever, now that Sony is not following suit with the Xbox One,
1169267	1195325	guess where they're pushing the customers that are pre-ordering stuff where their bigger margins are PlayStation 4 so you have that working against them as well unless they change their mind but I think even a lot of people are saying hey you know what even if they change their mind and reverse their decision on this stuff I'm still not going to support them because they took this stance in the first place and what kind of bullshit are they trying to put us through sure
1196386	1224837	ShadowNextGen in chat says the internet is a vocal minority they don't matter in the grand scheme of things okay let's talk about my co-workers who have already decided they won't be buying an Xbox One or the random employee at Disneyland that saw we were coming from E3 that was talking to my friend and I about stuff and how he's been an Xbox fanboy all this time and does not plan to get an Xbox One the internet may be a vocal minority but the little ripple starts here and the tidal wave can crash
1225057	1228220	or relatives of mine who all they do is play Farmville but they saw enough.
1229601	1232903	The internet is really not the minority you like to think it is.
1233163	1242791	You may have more vocal people in the minority but the majority of people who are in the consumer market are going to have access to the internet and see this information.
1243452	1243992	End of story.
1244032	1251298	Whether or not they say anything and here's something that came from one of those stupid courses I'm sorry I hate to say this Rob because I know that's what you do.
1252079	1258225	Those little team building courses that you do at work, one of them was called being an advocate.
1258305	1268296	For every one person that complains, there are eight other people who do not, who still have that same opinion, who will be swayed by the one that complains.
1270812	1271972	and then Ross D.O.U.T.
1271992	1298893	in our chat room even points out and I was going to bring this up but this shit even got on Rachel Maddow's blog who was bashing the fact that well you know despite however you feel about her with politics and everything the fact that she is working for MSNBC her show is on MSNBC and she's basically bashing what was said about the whole fact you won't be able to play it on a nuclear submarine and the whole fact that you know basically the Xbox is giving the finger to the military and all this stuff I mean that was a huge faux pas
1299306	1301027	And don't forget about the other jokes.
1301547	1301707	Yeah.
1302267	1302508	All right.
1304048	1308450	One other thing I want to bring up that is a key failure on Microsoft's part.
1308710	1313953	And if Microsoft can pull out the holiday, this is the only way they're going to be able to do it.
1314053	1317594	And that is the fact that the Xbox One is married to Kinect.
1318435	1322457	And it says a lot when not a single...
1323177	1328400	Game, at that press conference, not one of them used Kinect.
1329300	1333262	I know there were some on the show floor with Just Dance 2014 and the Fantasia game.
1333302	1336244	And some of the games that they did show did support it, but it wasn't shown.
1336284	1336784	Exactly.
1337164	1343107	So what's the big fucking deal about Kinect and why is there going to be one force included with every single system?
1343347	1350131	Because I'll bet you the way that PlayStation got the price of their console down to $399 is A, they're going to shaft you on memory storage.
1350571	1352792	B, 500 gigabytes on the hard drive.
1353232	1354453	On the $3.99 version?
1354633	1354793	Yep.
1355033	1356013	There is only one version.
1356173	1356273	It's $3.99.
1356353	1357353	Really?
1358514	1359494	They're not going to try to put out a $4.99, $5.99?
1360575	1360855	Wow.
1360935	1361535	That's okay.
1362075	1362875	Color me surprised.
1363576	1366557	But they definitely are not including the PlayStation 9 and stuff.
1366757	1370858	And on top of that, it is upgradable, just like the PlayStation 3.
1372699	1375019	But the i and all that stuff, nowhere to be seen.
1375099	1376380	i is $60 separate.
1376540	1376700	Yeah.
1377518	1380519	Even so, that's not enough to bump it up a whole hundred bucks.
1381440	1396807	So I think the only way that Microsoft is going to be able, especially with all this negative perception Kinect has right now in the backlash, I really think the only way Microsoft is going to be able to pull the holidays out is to drop the price of the console a hundred bucks to attach itself from Kinect.
1397287	1403350	And now we can have a debate about are the exclusives worth the DRM restrictions and yada, yada, yada.
1403897	1432090	I still don't know that that's going to be enough for me it still won't be honestly but you never know I mean I think the internet is speaking loud and clear the gamer fan base is upset I don't think a corporation like Microsoft can move fast enough but we'll see well and on top of that just in the general way they've disrespected their user base I wouldn't give them my money until I could buy one second hand that would assure that they wouldn't get that money
1432662	1437180	and on top of that a lot of the stuff that they might be a bit much well you know no I do that stuff you know me
1437841	1445023	There were some games that they showed that were Xbox exclusive, and I'm not just talking about Xbox One, both Xbox One and Xbox 360.
1445223	1450644	Like, for example, the new Plants vs. Zombies game, which looks pretty sweet.
1451965	1452245	Whatever.
1452485	1452905	You know what?
1453005	1453345	I don't care.
1453685	1454905	It looks fantastic.
1456106	1459807	So that'll be one I want to pick up on Xbox 360 when it comes out later on.
1460087	1464088	And Titanfall was another one that was, I think, Xbox One, Xbox 360 exclusive.
1464528	1464988	Hell, I have a 360.
1465088	1467170	I'm going to be gaming on it for a long time.
1468330	1476355	So I'm not worried about all these games coming out that may be only on the Xbox platforms because I have an Xbox platform.
1476416	1477016	I'm just, you know...
1479159	1481421	I'm not going to buy two next-gen consoles.
1481561	1490768	And not necessarily because I just don't like... I mean, I don't really like the policies that they have with Xbox One, but I can't afford two consoles right now like that.
1490908	1494992	And I bought all three this generation, and I play one of the three.
1495152	1497514	So I'm not going to throw away my money like that.
1497754	1504539	Just buy one, and then when they drop their price and release a Grand Theft Auto VI or something like that, that's exclusive to Xbox One, which will never happen.
1504960	1506541	But then we can talk about it.
1506667	1509665	Bloodjunk makes a good point that Titanfall is also on PC.
1511431	1512732	Yeah, but my laptop can't run that.
1513573	1514434	But my computer can.
1514874	1525603	Before we get into our gaming weeks and covering the rest of the news tonight and ultimately getting to your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR and your further chat comments and so forth, we've been very focused on Microsoft versus Sony, as a lot of people have.
1526043	1532928	I don't want to ignore Nintendo because, obviously, that's a console, too, and they had their own set of expectations going into E3.
1533369	1535350	How did we all feel about Nintendo?
1535931	1537772	I'll start with Nintendo's biggest critic in the room.
1537812	1539314	Loki, how did you feel about what Nintendo did?
1539334	1540875	There was nothing surprising from them.
1541135	1545316	Honestly, because all the stuff that we knew was coming, they basically announced.
1545336	1547637	There wasn't anything like, oh, hey, I didn't see that.
1547977	1552779	Okay, the only game I didn't know that was coming was a new Donkey Kong game, and I was like, who cares?
1553319	1555000	We just had a Donkey Kong game come out.
1555120	1555840	I don't really care.
1555880	1561642	This looks exactly like the other one, except, oh, now it's 3D, and it goes into the background, and who gives a shit?
1562382	1563143	Thanks for watching!
1578072	1580413	But I just don't really care anymore about it.
1580613	1581853	Smash Brothers look kind of cool.
1582554	1585455	And some of the new characters that they're announcing are kind of... It's neat.
1585575	1588256	I like how they're going with that.
1588336	1591437	Bayonetta 2 just kind of... It was alright.
1591737	1593077	But when's that coming out?
1593698	1594278	No idea.
1594598	1594738	Well, 2014.
1594778	1597019	But that could be Christmas 2014.
1597779	1600361	Originally it was supposed to be 2013, so I don't know.
1601942	1606145	Zelda Wind Waker HD just doesn't look like they've really done a lot to it.
1606166	1610189	They didn't really add anything to it other than, you know, now you can travel the seas faster.
1610369	1614452	Well, and that Accel Shaded game looks a lot better on HD, but, you know.
1614552	1621077	I'm still disappointed, though, that a system that plays Wii games isn't able to up-res those things.
1621368	1623889	Yeah, here's the thing about Nintendo for me.
1640918	1645040	All that aside, when you really kind of looked at the news itself, a lot of it was just kind of par.
1645400	1649421	You know, I'm not like, I wasn't like, woo, Nintendo, like super excited.
1649761	1655283	I mean, certainly the couple games that I was excited about, I'm really excited about.
1655303	1656563	Mario Kart 8 looks killer.
1657284	1663205	The new Mario 3D World, which I don't get the 3D, not on a 3DS, but whatever, okay, whatever.
1663286	1664226	And cats.
1664346	1667707	I forgive it because it's got the floating princess and Luigi legs again, whatever.
1668747	1669168	and Cats.
1669508	1670549	And X looked good.
1670849	1671069	Yeah.
1671169	1673530	And so, you know, yeah, that's all stuff that's cool.
1673550	1676732	And then I was kind of like, that's a lot of 2014 stuff.
1677153	1683576	That's the thing that kind of concerned me about it is that it's not that the games don't look good because they all do look really good and, you know, hey, it's Nintendo.
1683596	1684157	But I was kind of like...
1684697	1691339	Man, I kind of wanted Nintendo to really have a come-from-behind holiday and they're going to really kick some butt this holiday season.
1691399	1697421	And I'm kind of like, maybe they'll kick butt in 2014 because they didn't announce a price drop or anything to really move those consoles this season.
1697441	1702043	They have the same fucking lineup they had two years ago with the 3DS.
1702643	1704964	Mario 3D Land and Mario Kart.
1705044	1707085	Seriously, they're just repeating the steps.
1707345	1708725	So what, are we going to get a price drop?
1708945	1710226	Same strategy as the 3DS.
1710526	1713967	But those games are enough to make me want to go out and buy a Wii U assuming I had the funds for it.
1714363	1721229	Wait a second, that's actually exactly their strategy because there's also another new Mario, or I'm sorry, new Luigi U game in August.
1721590	1722170	Yeah, but Smash Bros.
1722210	1722631	is not until 2014.
1722691	1723852	Yeah, but I don't care.
1723872	1732600	That makes me want a Wii U. It's literally the exact same lineup as like 2011 for the 3DS on the Wii U. It's like exactly.
1732660	1734102	And this is my I don't care face.
1734142	1734602	I want one.
1735223	1736664	I didn't get to finish my thought completely.
1736704	1738506	Now people in chat are like, Rob, you're wrong.
1739966	1765876	the thing is is that even if Nintendo chooses not to drop the price of their console which I don't think is the smartest decision but okay if they don't do it they're still the cheapest option out there at the holiday season and I think there are a lot of families that aren't informed on this whole Microsoft versus Sony thing and are simply going to go for the cheapest option that the thing is for their kids because you know yes the Mario games are going to speak to certain people and so forth but
1767259	1772044	This is where I'm torn because that argument should have worked last year.
1772965	1774146	See, that's my problem.
1774206	1778050	We had a Mario game last year and the console still didn't sell.
1778551	1783035	Okay, so we have a couple more this year, but we don't have anything else to really push it.
1783396	1788721	So you're just telling me that more of the same is going to move more consoles.
1789662	1814214	I'm not I mean I'm skeptical and I'm not rooting against Nintendo I really hate that all these publishers are abandoning Nintendo I think they're being dicks about it but I want to see Nintendo do better but I just kind of I feel like I didn't really get it from them how they're going to light a fire under the Wii U that's what was frustrating for me so
1817589	1821352	Let's see, going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com Well, I mean, that's a problem.
1821412	1824473	And I would argue it didn't have a holiday season like Wii's.
1832418	1834019	or Xbox 360s when it launched.
1834099	1841124	It had a pretty decent launch, but the thing was that, yeah, there were no games for like three months after it came out.
1841184	1842945	And a lot of them were ports of older games.
1843565	1848268	And we could very well see that kind of lineup, although they're going to have like Wii Fit U, big deal.
1849769	1854913	And I don't even know what they're going to have for like, you know, the first quarter of 2014.
1855033	1859956	So, yeah, there is a lot of stuff that who knows where this is going to be coming out.
1859976	1860136	Yeah.
1860276	1862720	Kubica Jeremy in chat says, Actually, Mass Effect 3 was the same way.
1862760	1863381	Yeah, something's up there.
1863461	1863541	Like...
1875499	1880063	Is something fucked up with Nintendo Network where DLC isn't as easy to do or something?
1880103	1885547	Because why do we keep seeing these subpar games that, you know, they launch and it's eh.
1885967	1888689	And then they're like piss poorly supported after launch.
1889049	1891671	Mass Effect 3 is a great example.
1891851	1895294	It's not a better experience on Wii U. It had nothing to carry over on top of that.
1895354	1903580	All the things that made playing 3 actually kind of mildly worthwhile was carrying over your previous game data and it didn't even have a good version to do that.
1904272	1906913	Anyway, I want to move on to the other stories and so forth.
1906933	1913996	But I do want to say on a positive note for Nintendo, I think one other thing to keep in mind when I'm talking about that I'm not seeing enough or whatever.
1914736	1920298	One thing that should be noted is that one thing Nintendo has been doing right is that they're doing more of those Nintendo Directs.
1920618	1924780	And they did already put out some surprises that would usually be an E3 thing, right?
1924820	1927161	The Zelda 3D on 3DS and so forth.
1928502	1948804	3DS fucking rules right now like as far as handhelds go I mean PlayStation is phoning in the Vita 3DS is Amazeballs, Animal Crossing, Zelda, Smash Brothers I mean 3DS is fucking where it's at for handhelds right now if you're like a gamer like that's one thing Nintendo ain't doing wrong it just took them a long time to get there
1949645	1974351	but you know a lot of that stuff kind of came out before so I'm hoping that maybe there's another Nintendo Direct in a month that has some other stuff to get us excited and I know there's some news coming up later that maybe Nintendo hasn't played all their cards right now so that will be interesting to see play out so all right uh any other thoughts on the big three before we get into our gaming weeks quickly and gaming news and all that
1975852	1976373	Ubisoft.
1976813	1980936	Like always, Ubisoft had a lot of cool stuff to show at their press conference.
1981336	1994425	And I always kind of think that being able to take E3 each year, they showed off, what was it, The Crew, which looked pretty awesome, like an open world burnout type game, which is pretty sweet.
1994525	2003231	And then they also had the new Tom Clancy game, Division, or The Division, that looked pretty cool as well, like that MMO that ties in with the iPad and stuff.
2004171	2005152	So I thought that was really cool.
2006072	2006673	Want to check that out?
2006873	2011016	Those games actually kind of seem like, okay, here's how we're going to use next gen.
2011056	2018642	They kind of showed that versus Rise, which is like, cool, you made a knockoff of God of War.
2019642	2020763	Awesome.
2022765	2032632	Before we get into Gaming Weeks, let me ask this question with my big slash troll face because this is definitely the question that cynical gamers everywhere are asking.
2034274	2036955	What do you think will sell more this holiday season?
2037435	2040116	The Xbox One or the Wii U?
2041416	2043136	What will sell more this holiday season?
2043156	2045137	The Xbox One or the Wii U?
2046557	2051418	If everybody had my brain, it would be the Wii U. But not everybody is an intelligent shopper.
2053719	2057840	So, I still pretty much think the Wii U is going to be a better seller.
2058806	2059146	PlayStation 4
2082898	2084979	PlayStation 4 will outsell all of them.
2085479	2092883	I think, if anything, you can still have Xbox 360 selling more than Xbox One and probably the Wii U as well.
2093503	2099446	Just because... No, they have a lot of exclusives for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
2099486	2103208	And honestly, I don't see Wii U as next-gen.
2103348	2103808	I'm sorry.
2103908	2106569	It's still up graphically and performance-wise.
2106930	2108810	It's on par with the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, so...
2111092	2115436	It's just like, I don't know, in-between gen or something, whatever you want to call it.
2116016	2126586	I'm going to say Wii U sells more this holiday season because of households with children under 12 and the parents that will have the fond memories of Nintendo and so forth.
2126626	2130269	And I think a lot of the hardcore gamers, I think a lot of them are going Sony.
2130329	2132511	Sorry, Xbox fans, but what's that?
2134751	2142597	But it doesn't really matter though because they don't need to buy a new system though for these games that they're wanting to play.
2142697	2146740	Everyone eats up Skylanders and everybody is probably going to eat up Disney Infinity.
2146820	2147881	Those are both on Wii.
2149482	2150303	You're going to have...
2152780	2155142	I don't know if there's, I mean, it's another Mario game.
2155182	2158784	I mean, how many Mario games are we going to have come out, you know, already?
2159504	2164427	It's not, I don't think it's that, like, amazing that, you know, 3D Land is coming out.
2164467	2168669	It just, it looks kind of like a slightly better version of the 3DS one.
2168750	2174013	And that's not a big, once again, not a big deal for me because that was just like New Super Mario Bros.
2174033	2174053	U.
2175407	2181848	Here's the big reason, the other big reason why I think Wii U is going to go over better than Xbox One.
2181988	2185169	And it's like you were saying, but this is apart from brand recognition.
2185709	2187689	You also do have a known quantity.
2188950	2201112	Whereas they are making so many different changes with the Xbone that I think that a lot of people are going to go towards something that they, as a consumer, can put more trust in.
2202392	2204893	Well, let's see what the listeners think.
2206471	2209853	live.vognetwork.com and answer this live poll right now.
2209933	2212615	What will sell more this holiday season?
2213476	2215917	Your options are Wii U or Xbox One.
2217699	2219720	Asking the questions of cynical gamers everywhere.
2219760	2222382	What's going to sell out of the two underdogs?
2223772	2224792	Dreamcast!
2224872	2225332	Dreamcast!
2249977	2252978	Yeah, that might be something to sell people on the system.
2253038	2257279	But a game that's basically an upgrade of a 3DS game, I don't think that's that.
2257919	2260840	It didn't really work too well for New Super Mario Bros.
2261160	2270743	U. And I don't think it's going to work too well for New Luigi U. So why is a third Mario game that's just a platformer that doesn't really seem that different from what's already out there?
2271403	2272703	I don't think that's going to be a system seller.
2272743	2273304	That's the thing.
2273464	2274264	Mario Kart, anything?
2275184	2275804	It's Mario Kart.
2276304	2277905	No 3DO Ikuma JP.
2278959	2282865	Alright, we will get to the results of our live poll right after our gaming weeks.
2282905	2287912	Let's try to keep them a little bit shorter tonight because we had a lot of E3 talk, but DarkSakura, what have you been tapped into this week?
2288180	2292301	Well, we busted out the Atari 5200 for Atari Party coming up, getting everything working.
2292341	2294162	So there was some pango going on in my house, Rob.
2294402	2294682	Nice.
2294742	2295443	Thought you would have liked it.
2295583	2295883	Loves it.
2295963	2296683	And Super Pac-Man.
2297343	2301465	We also have Millipede because we have some prototype re-releases.
2302265	2310388	I could not play Mass Effect 3 because I've been in the middle of upgrading all of my graphics in it so that it looks even more gorgeous, even if it's not the best story-wise.
2310828	2313689	I've been playing the first Mass Effect and I played it on the stream on Thursday.
2314849	2321233	and I'm probably going to end up getting it beaten on the stream next Thursday if I feel like it.
2323474	2330338	Really not... Oh yeah, Final Fantasy XIV because we had a beta weekend and I have a Thaumaturge.
2330678	2331838	Oh yeah, we can talk about that now, huh?
2331878	2332859	Yeah, we can.
2332879	2334840	We just can't say anything about last beta.
2335120	2338122	Well, I didn't play in this beta weekend so I guess I can't really say anything.
2338182	2342124	I just got my invite for PlayStation 3 so I will have to download it.
2343380	2365530	Um, I think that, honestly, after as long as I played WoW, it has everything that I liked in Cataclysm, because that's what got me playing WoW, and none of the utter grinding crap that's in, um, you know, Panda, Panda version, Pandaria, Stupid Pandas, Gummy Bears, Gummy Bears, WoW Gummy Bear Edition.
2366371	2371193	So, uh, I'm really enjoying it, and I like playing my cat girl, or my Mikote, or whatever she's called.
2371493	2372174	She's a cat girl.
2372334	2372574	Mithra.
2373419	2375100	It was pretty funny.
2375120	2375260	So yeah.
2402787	2408592	I played literally one session of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 this week.
2408953	2414617	Because every other time I was just basically reading E3 news, all my coworkers were gone.
2414738	2416739	So I didn't get to play with anybody.
2417600	2420643	And I was working on 3D modeling in the meantime.
2421183	2423165	So yeah, I didn't play anything.
2423325	2425727	I did buy, though, the... What was it?
2425807	2425987	The...
2427228	2430449	Serious Sam Collection on Humble Bundle, the weekly sale.
2430509	2431310	So I got that.
2432830	2435151	Fuck, I never got a Humble Bundle 8 and it's done, huh?
2436172	2436412	Yep.
2436732	2437012	Shit.
2437432	2437672	Oh, well.
2437872	2438472	That was my bad.
2438953	2439993	Oh, well.
2440853	2442254	So, I mean, that was pretty cool.
2442534	2443814	You don't have to buy Humble Bundle 9.
2444035	2444635	Maybe they'll throw an 8.
2444695	2445775	Yeah, it's true.
2445835	2446095	It's true.
2447916	2454261	So, I mean, I haven't ever played any of that series, but it looked cool, so I wanted to pick that up, and I thought it was a good deal.
2455161	2455522	What else?
2456683	2460305	I bought PlayStation Plus for a year.
2460325	2467911	I haven't redeemed it yet, though, but I'm looking forward to trying out the free games that are on there and stuff, because I have a 500 gig hard drive to fill up with games I haven't played yet.
2469532	2475677	And I pre-ordered PlayStation 4, because I'm worried that I may not be able to get one if I don't.
2476077	2476978	So, I did.
2478815	2486699	Oh, and just to say, for those of us who are playing Final Fantasy XIV and want to join us on a beta weekend, we are on the North American Behemoth server.
2487199	2487559	There you go.
2487579	2488960	Do you have a link shell yet?
2489000	2489901	We don't have a link shell yet.
2490161	2494883	And you can only add friends if they're online at the same time, so I couldn't get anybody.
2495365	2498007	Remind me later to talk to you about Facebook things.
2498087	2500729	Unless Shane Alinko happens to be listening, then you know what to do.
2501249	2501509	Alright.
2502930	2503931	As far as Loki's concerned.
2504611	2505892	Which I think I did see him in chat earlier.
2506332	2507233	Okay, so my gaming week.
2507353	2514978	So, even though Orange Launch Radio, the world's longest weekly internet show about video games, is not a recognized media outfit of E3...
2515738	2518001	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2536299	2539241	It's like the first game I walked up to and I'm like, alright, so tell me about your game.
2539261	2541843	And he's like, well, it's like a rhythm game.
2542504	2543564	He goes, it's hard to explain.
2543584	2546326	He's like, it's a rhythm game mixed with a roguelike.
2546506	2549928	I'm like, this sounds like the perfect game right up my alley.
2549989	2551970	I love dungeon crawlers and I love rhythm games.
2552310	2553291	Tell me more, sir.
2553692	2555093	So he actually showed me the game.
2555153	2557476	And yes, it is a rhythm game mixed with a roguelike.
2557496	2561901	It's like a dungeon crawler, but you attack to the beat of the music in your little combos.
2561941	2566626	Like when you want to do a combo, you hold down the trigger and little beat patterns show over your sword.
2566646	2568007	So you can kind of do the little patterns.
2568268	2570090	And if you do it right, you do like an AoE attack.
2570430	2596677	so it was kind of cool yeah it was cute i liked it uh so i have my eye on that like if i'm gonna get a new year which i might depending on finances uh i would definitely pick up Sylfjord i like that that was fun um he did say if i heard the guy correctly he said though it's it's going to be a difficult game and if you die you die it's like dark souls you go all the way back to start so you know that whole thing so uh that'll be interesting to see what happens um
2598214	2600495	Let's see, I saw another game called The Amazing Frog.
2600755	2601615	This game was weird.
2602836	2603056	What?
2603376	2605357	No, I want to know about this one, because I've heard of it.
2605677	2612700	It looked weird to me, and I'm going to admit, it's a game where you can tell the graphics on the Ouya are a little bit behind.
2613140	2616661	Because the other two games, like Soul Fjord, looked like any other Xbox Live Arcade game to me.
2616801	2617682	It was like cartoony.
2617822	2618842	It looked like that to me.
2619703	2624204	I could tell The Amazing Frog was a little weaker graphically.
2624244	2625605	But that's not the developer's fault.
2625645	2627906	I hear the game has really loud boomboxes in it.
2628486	2630107	I couldn't figure it out.
2630567	2637390	It's like this open world frog runner game and all you can do with the controller is you jump and you fling.
2638030	2642552	And it's like this big open playground and you can fling yourself on a trampoline and go flying.
2642952	2643592	It is the type of...
2643692	2645735	Open World shit you would eat right up, Loki.
2661567	2662048	Chrono Blade
2682489	2700236	and I looked at it because it looked like Diablo from afar and I'm like because I had like the little red and blue potions in the corner you know I'm like oh this is like a Diablo clone so I went to play it and it's apparently a free-to-play game it's not just on Ouya they have a web browser based thing that's in closed beta right now well here's the thing it looks like Diablo from a distance it plays like the Ninja Turtles arcade game
2700356	2724677	that's awesome like to me it was like a beat-em-up with like the jump and the punch and all that and you could do like the special moves and as you beat people up you you gain magic so that's what it felt like to me and I was like all right this is and then the guy was kind enough to give me a closed beta key so I was like I think I will be cashing that in that looks like fun uh you can get more information on that one at facebook.com slash chronoblade online all one word I imagine they're giving away a
2726398	2730563	SoulFjord.com was the other game and I didn't get a website or anything for Amazing Frog.
2730623	2731745	Sorry, but Google it.
2731785	2732486	I'm sure you'll find it.
2732506	2738333	Well, SoulFjord is the folks behind Quantum Conundrum and that kind of stuff.
2738833	2740475	So, they make some pretty awesome games.
2742277	2742397	So...
2743218	2765485	uh there you go those are i mean other than that lots of animal crossing but not enough to even like pay off my second loan like i just there's too much street passing i did a lot of street passing i sat in the lobby at e3 while i waited for bobby blackwolf because he he took his time which i understand he was trying to get answers to questions was fishing up a demo he took his time and i just street passed over and over i literally got like 120 puzzle pieces over the weekend
2766666	2772831	I completed like two puzzles and yeah, I'm only like 80 panels away from full completion.
2772871	2774312	So that made me excited.
2775594	2775994	There you go.
2777115	2783520	DungeonBuster in chat at live.vognetwork.com says, Uya didn't pay to be at E3 so they rented out a parking lot nearby and held their events there.
2783961	2788365	Yeah, and the ESA rented a big truck and parked it right in front of the booth.
2788385	2789806	That's kind of a dick move.
2789826	2791067	That was kind of a dick move.
2791127	2791728	Like it was...
2792268	2794471	It wasn't that big a deal, honestly.
2794872	2803084	The Ouya thing was like, hey, we've got beer over here and some developers... I did not see the Ouya being pushed.
2803605	2807430	I saw developers making games on Ouya being pushed.
2807650	2808412	That's what I saw.
2808792	2809152	E3.VOGnetwork.com
2835918	2850329	basically flat out saying how to get Kingdom Hearts on Xbox if that's what you want, giving the answer to that a definitive price for the Disney Infinity figurines all figured out thanks to you guys and your questions at e3.vognetwork.com and more
2851397	2852437	I could have told you that though.
2872742	2878725	It all depends on what price drops on the Wii U side or even the Xbox One side and if they reverse their policy.
2879845	2881546	There's a lot of time.
2883927	2886688	Admittedly, that question was I said at the beginning.
2886708	2889289	This is the troll face skeptic question.
2890150	2891410	But I thought it was a fun one to ask.
2891450	2892431	I hope you had fun answering it.
2894191	2894752	Housekeeping.
2895672	2899574	Twitter.com slash OLR or our Facebook, Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
2899954	2908859	Next week on the program, June 23rd, 2013, our pal JV Mon will be here to help us celebrate 11 years of Orange Lounge Radio.
2909340	2913122	And this is what's very interesting, too, is that June 23rd is the actual birthday.
2913162	2914242	That doesn't happen every year.
2914482	2916203	So every 11 years we can expect it to be.
2916384	2918565	It's like every five or six years, the way the leap years work.
2918625	2924268	Yeah, but this is one of the few times we actually get to celebrate a birthday on our birthday.
2924528	2927869	Maybe I will have to convince somebody else to make murder brownies again.
2927909	2929170	That would be fantastic.
2929270	2930150	So we hope you guys will join us.
2930470	2931471	We're not planning anything.
2931631	2934492	I mean, you get to a certain age and you just kind of stop caring.
2935452	2936492	I don't say you stop caring.
2936732	2937313	I shouldn't say that.
2937393	2938073	No, we are.
2938213	2938653	No, no, no.
2938693	2940774	How about I quote the amazing Wanda Sykes?
2941374	2943335	The older I get, the less of a fuck I give
2965169	2968190	So we'll say, if you want to get us a cake, we'll eat it.
2968290	2970450	That's what we're going to say about next week's show.
2970690	2973071	Preferably, I like carrot cake, just saying.
2973231	2975612	Do we have confirmed our guest for two weeks from now?
2975712	2976512	Guest host in two weeks?
2976532	2977112	I thought we did.
2977252	2977812	I think we do.
2978192	2981393	Because of another transaction that's occurring around that?
2981433	2987375	Well, I'm just going to say, I am fully expecting that in two weeks, first make slide kick from Game Buoy will be here live.
2987715	2988575	Then that'll be a lot of fun.
2988815	2990076	And if not, we're going to go get him.
2990216	2993378	And I'm going to razz the crap out of him on his old show, Fabulous Times.
2993398	2994919	We're going to duct tape him to a buoy.
2995199	2995660	Good times.
2995780	2997081	And bring him along with us.
2997361	2997721	Good times.
2998001	2998282	All right.
3000203	3002184	Tune in live every Sunday for the antics.
3002264	3006547	Live.VogNetwork.com I'm hoping we can start lining up some interviews, too, now that E3's over.
3006567	3008428	Because I definitely want to talk to some of these Ouya guys.
3008989	3013172	And, you know, whatever else we can get now that people are going to be really in that rush, too.
3013212	3014673	I get people to pre-order for the holiday.
3014693	3015213	Okay.
3015413	3016714	Let's run down more news.
3017054	3018876	Maybe some things you missed, maybe not.
3018936	3021138	Some clarifications, setting people straight.
3021478	3022899	Loki, why don't you start us off with the news?
3022999	3025301	Well, Major Nelson was answering a bunch of questions.
3026041	3031606	I think that he even did like a thing on NeoGAF where he was answering questions for people and stuff, posting on there.
3032146	3032927	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3062289	3063050	Thank you for watching!
3081443	3084447	No, they're too stubborn to change their mind so far.
3085248	3098265	But I mean, then again, I mean, he was only being asked that a few days after, you know, the announcement and sales, I think sales figures that they're trailing way behind that could change things.
3098465	3123151	you guys have to understand that corporations and the talking heads for corporations have to stick to talking points at big shows like this and they have investors remember they are all trained on said talking points they don't deviate from those talking points and when they do that's why it's always news when somebody goes off the cusp so you know they always stick to their talking points by the way I was checking to see if Major Nelson had replied to what I told him
3124757	3126898	I think he's got a lot of people telling him things right now.
3128458	3130919	I thought there was an interesting comment in chat from Ross Steel UT.
3131699	3136840	Major Nelson, the only community outreach guy left and he only stayed because he's a good enough yes man.
3137260	3139361	Does Microsoft need their Kevin Butler right now?
3142101	3149883	Dude, if they brought Kevin Butler out on stage during that placing tour thing, I think everyone would have lost it.
3150163	3153124	You know what I think would have been great for their presentation?
3154517	3155959	Bring Hard Gay out of retirement.
3156860	3159684	Have them just go around humping everybody and going, Woo!
3160425	3162328	That would have sold Xbox Ones right there.
3162348	3163048	Oh, God.
3163109	3163369	All right.
3165272	3170980	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase
3171460	3172821	Cloud.
3172881	3176864	I only mentioned this game briefly, like really briefly, but obviously it's kind of a big deal.
3176944	3178865	You know, it's the game a lot of people were talking about before E3.
3178885	3180606	It's the big Microsoft announcement.
3181247	3182087	Killer Instinct.
3182928	3186330	Killer Instinct was revealed at the Microsoft press briefing.
3186870	3188772	And here's the whole thing.
3188812	3192995	It came out afterwards that Killer Instinct is going to be free to play.
3193874	3197096	But they're actually now saying that that might not actually be part of it.
3197677	3199078	There's some clarifications coming out.
3199698	3208424	It's said that the game is going to be free to play, and when it launches on Xbox One, you can get Jago for free, and then you can buy all the other characters.
3208784	3213867	However, what's not being said, the full game will also be available on its release.
3214328	3223674	So if you don't want to do the whole nickel and dime model for only certain characters, then you can drop the assumably $60 and get the whole thing unlocked at once.
3224595	3227997	I actually think this model isn't as terrible as everyone says it is.
3228077	3231279	Now that we have the clarification that you can still get the game out of the box.
3231299	3233500	Yeah, it's basically a demo, but it's an upgradable demo.
3234881	3238104	You're in a pretty good situation if your favorite character is Jago.
3238804	3240245	You know what it reminds me of?
3240305	3249291	It reminds me of the Rock Band game on PSP where you could download the demo and you could download songs from the marketplace and play them in the demo.
3249731	3253674	You never had to buy the full game unless you wanted the full game's song list.
3255115	3256675	I don't know, it kind of reminds me of that.
3256775	3257936	So, interesting.
3258656	3262578	By the way, Double Helix also has unveiled Glacius as another character in the game.
3263318	3264679	He will be playable at EVO 2013.
3265019	3269761	There's also going to be 40 training lessons in the game to teach players about the game.
3269842	3280887	It is a little disappointing that Double Helix, the folks behind the latest Silent Hill game, are making this game and not Rare, the company behind very awesome games.
3282675	3286018	Kubica Jeremy in chat says, then why even focus on the free-to-play thing?
3286058	3287560	They should have made that clear right away.
3287980	3290242	Like everything they've been saying, they need to be crystal clear.
3290683	3294586	Here's a great example of what happens when somebody doesn't stick to talking points.
3294967	3308179	Because I think somebody made a one-off comment about this to a press site, and here we go, gaming industry, copy-paste, copy-paste, copy-paste, copy-paste, it's free-to-play, free-to-play, free-to-play, free-to-play, based off one guy that went off the page.
3311232	3319280	and that's why you didn't see Microsoft doing a backpedaling or an about face at E3 there is not time to change the script
3320725	3321305	Silent Hill Homecoming
3344468	3348471	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3362743	3374667	And this new version, while I'm mildly interested in it, it doesn't seem like it's going to be... It was about the only thing that they mentioned that made me perk up at all, and it was only for the nostalgia's sake.
3375008	3376328	And I don't think they can really bank on that.
3377051	3382535	Yeah, it's kind of one of those things where it's like, oh, I'd love to check it out if I was going to get an Xbox One, but I'm not going to right now.
3382895	3386257	Maybe I'll get an Xbox One in a year, and I think that's what'll end up happening.
3386818	3393282	And to be fair, folks, I bought the 360 at launch, well, soon after launch, and I waited a year to get a PlayStation 3.
3393842	3395203	It's just that in reverse.
3395243	3400607	On the topic of that, they redesigned the 360 to look like the Xbox One, and I think it's fucking ugly.
3400827	3403489	That console looks not good anymore.
3404143	3406263	I think we've... I've talked about this on the show before.
3406283	3408584	I think we focus way too much on the looks of consoles.
3409344	3410444	It's not that big a deal.
3410584	3416085	Like, a lot of people were talking about the PlayStation 4 and its weird shape, and I'm just like, all right, so it's oddly shaped.
3416105	3416865	But here's the thing, though.
3417406	3420926	I like that it's vertical or horizontal again, and you can put it wherever you want.
3421006	3421706	That's cool.
3421886	3427327	Here's the thing, though, is why would you redesign your current-gen console to make it look like the Xbox One?
3427767	3430508	That's going to be confusing now because people are going to say...
3430808	3432729	Hey, I saw that console on TV.
3432789	3433489	Which console is it?
3433549	3434630	It's one of the Xboxes.
3434910	3435590	Oh, it's this one.
3435910	3440213	And they get a 360, you know, because... You don't think the name is right there on the front?
3441153	3445495	No, they're going to see the 360 with the new branding and say, oh, that looks fun.
3445935	3450717	And whoever is going to be selling them the system is going to point out the more expensive newest one.
3453279	3453559	Anyhow...
3454594	3458181	Yeah, the redesign is weird, but I'm kind of like, I just don't care.
3458742	3462108	There's so much more to worry about with these consoles than the look.
3462208	3463851	And Rob, Betamax forever.
3464633	3465073	Whatever.
3465354	3465775	Move on.
3465815	3466336	DarkSakura.
3467263	3468104	Okay, I got other stuff.
3468464	3480650	Now this one, it's a little bit more falls into the conspiracy theory part of... I don't really know exactly how to think about it, but the first time I saw this article, it really made me raise my eyebrow.
3480730	3486093	It's an article of a guy named Jason.
3486313	3488054	I'm trying to see what his full name is.
3489114	3494777	But he was basically at E3 taking photos of the Microsoft booth and
3495497	3512026	or some of the gaming booths and he took a picture of a laptop being hooked up and he got pulled aside and was told to delete the photo which he actually went back and redrew of basically the games running off of laptops and PCs.
3512546	3518609	Now there was a big stink going on about this on the GameFAQs board and
3519109	3546083	which I was reading through and they're saying no those can't be dev kits they are running off of NVIDIA cards which as far as I was aware let me see if I can the NVIDIA GTX cards which as far as I was aware wasn't supposed to be incorporated into the final system so they're saying that they weren't actually running off of the development PCs these were running off of regular PCs and they even had the games crash the PCs and
3546986	3547647	Thanks for watching!
3564069	3565250	I don't know.
3565990	3566871	I'm going to be honest.
3567351	3575999	I think there's a real desire in the gaming community right now to just dogpile Microsoft and let's kick the bastards while they're down for daring to fuck with my used games.
3576919	3577380	Beat them up.
3577940	3581783	But then again, Microsoft should have left that guy alone when he took the picture.
3581803	3583204	Well, here's the other thing.
3583245	3584806	That thread on GameFAQs is gone.
3585464	3587945	Well, I don't understand how they could say, you better delete that photo.
3587965	3588965	I'd be like, you better fuck off.
3588985	3590645	Hold on, let me see if I can find it.
3592066	3596247	Okay, a guard stood outside to keep me from freaking out and making a run for it.
3596307	3600228	A couple Microsoft PR folks came in, large forced smiles on their faces.
3600268	3601488	They just wanted to talk to me.
3602228	3606589	And then going, they made the big point of telling me they were not telling me to delete the photos.
3606629	3610370	That's because they really couldn't since they never said what could or couldn't be photos.
3610390	3612971	But they also didn't want me to leave that little room with those photos.
3616446	3617806	That's the news story here.
3617907	3620868	Microsoft made a big deal out of something that shouldn't have been a big deal.
3621988	3624169	Here's just a few lines.
3625030	3625490	It was weird.
3625510	3635314	They were clearly unhappy and concerned even though they insisted that laptop was just controlling a looping video which it certainly may have been doing which makes it even weirder that they were so upset at the photos.
3635814	3642057	Not being able to take their intense stares and restrained desire to yank the camera out of my hands any longer I just deleted the photos.
3642137	3642897	Then they set me free.
3644538	3648180	He redrew the... And I'm actually... I'm going to go ahead and link this article for everybody.
3649341	3650261	It was on Gizmodo.
3650961	3652962	Actually, the Australian Gizmodo site.
3653663	3657665	But I'm going to link it in the chat room because it really is worth giving a good read over.
3657705	3659266	And he drew a copy of the photo.
3662228	3669129	It doesn't seem like it would be anything, but what makes it most suspicious is that they made a big stink out of it.
3669729	3679291	You know, if they had just said, oh, whatever, you know, it's sort of like when you tell the little kid they can't have something and then the kid thinks that that's something big and that they're going to sneak and get it.
3679831	3681692	It's that same type of thing.
3681732	3688773	It makes it a bigger deal than what, you know, if it wasn't a big deal, why are they trying to restrain this guy and browbeat him into deleting a photo?
3689033	3691294	I bet you the PS4s are running off PCs, too.
3691534	3692014	Well, yeah.
3692294	3693455	All the dev kits are PCs.
3693835	3700517	But if these aren't exactly the dev kits, if they are trying to run it off of a more beefed-up system, then we have a problem.
3700877	3706159	Yeah, well... Especially if they're saying that they're being run off of the system hardware.
3706259	3712002	It's a huge risk, too, because if the game that comes out doesn't match what was played at E3, the people that played at E3 are going to call it out.
3712482	3714943	It is Colonial Marines all over again!
3716203	3718304	But it's Gearbox not making the game, so they're okay, right?
3719571	3720272	I don't know.
3720792	3721133	All right.
3721233	3722034	Anyhow, let's move on.
3722074	3722314	Loki.
3722935	3723295	All right.
3723435	3726178	So, hey, you want that Xbox One?
3726238	3733686	Well, you better be living in certain regions of the world because it only supports a few different countries.
3735527	3742314	So at launch, if you're living in a good portion of Asia, well, you're fucked.
3743876	3766714	So basically, the only places, countries that you can access Xbox Live at launch can be Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and the U.S.,
3768827	3769447	No Japan.
3770327	3770848	No Japan.
3771068	3779410	Even though the first developer up, Japanese developer, and I think the only Japanese developer that showed up at E3's press conference, which I also found interesting.
3781150	3783711	I found it very interesting who was at what press conference.
3783751	3787672	Did you notice there was no EA at Sony's conference?
3788332	3790233	And that they were showing the 2K sports game instead.
3790273	3791533	I just thought it was interesting.
3791593	3792273	Just put it out there.
3792293	3793874	Thought it was very interesting.
3793994	3794814	I think it's noteworthy.
3797297	3797598	Noted.
3798619	3799280	Noted, yeah.
3800862	3801122	All right.
3802263	3804186	What do you think, though, about the fact that they left Japan off?
3805627	3806869	They're not trying anymore.
3806889	3810353	I think we all knew that Microsoft was going to write them off.
3811154	3813276	I mean, a lot of great games come out of Japan.
3813457	3815379	It's a little weird to me.
3815399	3816680	It seems like a lot of them...
3817341	3818382	It's disrespect in being uninclusive.
3839656	3842218	They're just like, too bad, you can't conform to what we want.
3842338	3853148	So, hey, you guys, and I heard the argument from fanboys saying, well, hey, they had broadband internet on the original Xbox, that was the only way, no dial-up, and people still bought it.
3853649	3854590	Yeah, but you know what?
3854810	3862957	It's a little different to, I don't know if it's an equal comparison, because you can still play games offline with the original Xbox.
3863157	3865239	Well, I think IkumaJP pretty much nailed it.
3865339	3866000	We don't care now.
3867202	3876004	Well, it's just interesting to me because, and I realize, you know, and I see a lot of folks overall in chat are saying, like, well, Microsoft gave up on Japan a long time ago, but I'm kind of like, okay.
3876024	3878204	I don't think Japan was ever really into Microsoft.
3878324	3885966	Well, but, again, the first developer, first trailer to show up at the Microsoft thing, Japanese developers.
3886506	3893087	What was the biggest response at a Sony's press conference beside the whole, you know, going for the jugular on Microsoft's policy?
3893567	3896128	Two games developed by a Japanese studio.
3897188	3907704	That happened to be coming to Microsoft's system as well, but wasn't really pointed out I just thought it was interesting Noted Make a note That's all
3909560	3909820	Anyhow.
3911981	3916083	Well, this isn't from a Japanese developer, but it certainly got a lot of people excited anyway.
3916483	3924567	It's a new Mirror's Edge game, and a lot of people had a sad when it didn't show up at Microsoft's thing or whatever.
3924587	3930110	But then it showed up later, yay, at EA's press conference that a new Mirror's Edge game is in the works.
3930570	3936012	It is a reboot, actually, of the franchise, which is weird because there was only one game, so they're rebooting the one game.
3936032	3937053	But that's all right, you know.
3938233	3939513	It's going to be open world this time.
3940794	3947115	And a nice little letter posted on the official Mirror's Edge site from DICE senior producer Sarah Jansen.
3947575	3952796	We introduced Mirror's Edge and Faith to gamers five years ago, and we've waited for the right moment to reunite them.
3953176	3957797	Thanks to the Frostbite engine, which a whole shit ton of those EA games are all running on.
3958097	3961438	That's like EA's bread and butter right now is that Frostbite engine, if you think about it.
3962258	3990694	and a new generation of platforms we are now able to deliver a richer world the players will be able to explore with a new level of freedom in both movement and action and a lot of people very excited about this and yeah I'm curious too you know I didn't like love the first game but I definitely respected it and I'm looking forward to this reimagining I am glad that it's multi-platform me too very cool moving on Dark Sakura and then release dates
3991781	4000170	Well, we have, now, we sort of made a mention of this, I think, a little bit earlier, but we like Minecraft, don't we?
4000271	4001372	I used to hate Minecraft.
4002293	4002813	Now I love it.
4003054	4005596	I don't play it on Xbox, which now I'm glad that I don't.
4005697	4007919	And you definitely don't play it on the VOG Network server anymore.
4007939	4008420	Yeah.
4009013	4011795	Well, I did, but it wasn't always connecting.
4012656	4018339	Well, here is a really crappy thing for all of you Xbox Minecraft fans.
4018840	4020821	Your save's not going to carry over to the Xbone.
4021982	4022362	Oops!
4023743	4024424	I'm not surprised.
4024464	4029947	I'm getting the sense that even though they're both Minecraft, they're still like separate games.
4030087	4032509	That's kind of the sense I'm getting from this.
4033310	4036532	They said that they were discussing it, but I don't think it's going to happen.
4039448	4045776	They really do seem to be trying to put this wedge of separation in between the 360 and the bone.
4046937	4054447	I just don't really see that as an issue just because it's just like if you were to have... I don't mean... I don't know...
4056078	4065221	It would be hard because those features that are on the original version of Minecraft, like your worlds and stuff, are going to be locked into a certain size and stuff.
4065241	4071563	And when you're putting in basically a redone engine, even though it is the same game, it's just not going to transfer over.
4071643	4072944	Just start anew.
4073284	4075304	I mean, seriously, it's not that big a deal.
4075785	4076225	I don't know.
4076985	4079826	But once again, I think it's that whole dogpile mentality.
4080106	4109398	but there are people who put a lot of time and effort into their crap on Minecraft I mean a game like Minecraft I'm actually like you know a lot of people have created these huge things and maybe Minecraft on Xbox One will fix some of the things like you know like you're not going to have the limits on the world size like 360 maybe it's going to fix some of these things but it would be nice if people could transfer their time and effort over I've seen people put a lot of effort into building some of the same monumental ginormous creations on Xbox as they have to doing on a PC
4110898	4112359	It's a shame not to be able to carry that over.
4112499	4116262	I think part of what makes this noteworthy is that it shouldn't be that fucking hard.
4116302	4117243	It's Minecraft.
4118184	4120345	It's not that... It's a Java game.
4121086	4121326	I know.
4121366	4133414	I'm not belittling what a huge impact Minecraft has been on gaming and the heavy hitter that it is as far as the game is concerned, but it doesn't seem like to me that it should be that big a fucking deal to transfer a save file over.
4134495	4136956	I don't think it should be at all.
4137697	4140158	Is there any sort of cloud saving on Xbox?
4140198	4141438	I haven't touched my Xbox in forever.
4141759	4144380	So they've got a cloud saving feature.
4144600	4147261	Why shouldn't they be able to transfer things over via cloud?
4150023	4151363	Because it's a sad cloud.
4152364	4155225	It's a rain cloud.
4155645	4157166	It's a sad cloud that rains shit.
4159310	4166397	Speaking of the cloud, Brad from PodCulture says, Rob, I wonder how that DCU for the PS4 will tie in with the PS3 version, or even if it will.
4167177	4171822	Check Bobby's answers at e3.vognetwork.com because I believe he came back.
4173183	4179228	Was it you or somebody else had asked a question very similar to that, and I believe the response was, it is...
4180410	4188019	You will be able to log in and it's the same just with new textures and everything you would expect from going up to the PlayStation 4.
4188680	4191023	It sounded like the right answer, actually.
4192105	4193046	I'll put it that way.
4193306	4194728	I think everything did transfer over.
4194948	4195109	Yeah.
4196209	4200290	Let's travel around the world and check out some games that are coming out a lot sooner than what we saw at E3.
4201210	4202210	Not a whole lot this week.
4203230	4204191	Actually, some Vita stuff.
4204651	4207831	Jak and Daxter Collection coming out on the Vita.
4208331	4216373	Also this week, Muramasa Rebirth coming out on Vita as well.
4216873	4221714	And then Game & Wario one week from today.
4223579	4227781	I don't really want to start another game right now.
4254930	4255471	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4271888	4273670	Good job, Bobby, on ruining Loki's day.
4274350	4279894	But, as they mentioned, or some digging, the PlayStation 4 will be region free.
4280034	4281195	And here's the weird thing, though.
4281255	4286319	It's region free both disc-based game and digital games.
4286920	4290682	So that's not true, I think, right now on the PlayStation 3.
4290882	4294745	I think you can only buy stuff from certain regions, but apparently you can buy...
4295706	4301449	I don't know if you have to create another account in that region, but that'd be kind of cool if I could buy Japanese games or something.
4302509	4307892	Bobby Blackwell is in our chatroom right now at live.vognetwork.com wanting you to know he took a picture of the banner just for you, Loki.
4308032	4311614	It's alright, they're going to be coming to our game summit at the end of July.
4312754	4315635	You know, our rep over at, you know, Phillip Sales or whatever.
4315655	4317996	Justify, justify, justify.
4318016	4325920	She knows I'm a huge fan, and last year I got some fly swatters based on Insect Armageddon and stuff, so that's fine.
4325940	4330062	I still have to play through Insect Armageddon that I got on one of those Humble Bundles or whatever, so...
4331262	4334485	All right, let's talk about release dates in Japan.
4334645	4338248	And on the PlayStation 3 this week, a new DualShock controller in a gray color.
4338428	4341591	Also, The Last of Us making its way to Japan, both on June 20th.
4342111	4346915	If, for whatever reason, The Last of Us is not up your alley, try Daisenraikyoku.
4347715	4348516	I'm sorry, I said that wrong.
4348576	4349637	Daisenraikyoku.
4350257	4351999	Daituokobushi.com.
4355964	4357286	Yes, that is the full name of the game.
4357747	4359409	Regular and luxury editions.
4360350	4362353	You might have caught from the Tora Tora Tora in there.
4362774	4365337	It is a plain fight type game.
4365978	4366339	There you go.
4367569	4390652	I like that it's called a luxury edition that makes it seem regular and luxury it's luxurious does it come wrapped in silk on the Xbox 360 I will still cover releases on 360 in Japan as long as they're there Batman Arkham Twin Pack a repackaging assumably of the two Batman games for Japanese audiences there that's probably like a price drop type of thing
4392138	4393759	on the PlayStation Vita this week.
4393899	4394299	Quite a bit.
4394359	4396821	FIFA 13 World Class Soccer gets a price reduction.
4397681	4400963	I'm sorry, Winning Post 7 2013 comes out this week.
4401903	4407746	Also a new game, Kami Jaigen Idol Neptune PP in limited and regular editions.
4408647	4412889	And I think this looks like some type of, like it might be a music game.
4414690	4415530	I can't tell.
4416511	4419092	I think it's like a pop idol game.
4421673	4422354	Jamie, help me.
4422374	4424355	Do you recognize anything from these screenshots here?
4424375	4425476	Like what type of game this might be?
4425516	4426797	This seems to be the most telling one.
4427077	4428678	You see the little things with the patterns on them?
4429218	4431740	And it seems like maybe it's... I don't know this one.
4432401	4432821	I don't know.
4433041	4433341	Alright.
4433682	4434002	Sorry.
4434122	4434902	Maybe somebody in chat does.
4434922	4435543	What was the name again?
4436163	4437805	Kami, Jigen, Idol.
4437905	4439566	Jigen, Idol, Neptune, PP.
4439686	4440466	No, I don't know that one.
4441047	4442548	Maybe AkumaJP or somebody in chat will know.
4442568	4443208	God, something, Idol.
4444149	4444549	I don't know.
4444850	4447071	This is American Idol.
4448312	4449513	No Nicki Minaj in that game.
4449781	4461851	I did mention, I think that I mentioned this on Twitter actually because Nintendo does some weird stuff with their item numbers for their games and what was it for a new Luigi U?
4461911	4464333	It was PPRs is their item number.
4464353	4465253	That's the best.
4468856	4471638	Sorry, Akuma is asking for a link so I just gave it to him.
4472279	4473540	Let me quickly do the other countries.
4473740	4477043	Sorry Jamie, I know you were ready to go there but I don't want to neglect the Wii U.
4477557	4478778	I was just going to comment on that game.
4479078	4479699	Oh, okay.
4479859	4480960	That you asked IkumaJP.
4481200	4482841	Oh, okay.
4483001	4485123	So, on the Wii U this week, nothing.
4485183	4488525	But you do have F1 Race Stars Powered Up Edition to look forward to next week.
4488625	4489185	So, there you go.
4489786	4500974	And lastly, on the 3DS this week, Kumatomo and Ninja Jajamaru-kun Sakura-hime to Karyu no Himitsu comes out from Hamster this week on the Nintendo 3DS.
4502395	4509564	So I remember I asked you about the lack of F-Zero at E3 this year.
4509964	4513869	Are you at least excited that Mario Kart 8 is sort of F-Zero now?
4514050	4514250	Mm-hmm.
4518054	4518755	DarkSakura.com
4544597	4569308	Neverwinter on PC and New Super Luigi Brothers U when you first said Neverwinter I thought about Neverwinter Nights so did I and then I look at it and it's like no oh wait no there's that free to play Neverwinter that actually I get emails on that all the time that's it it looks exciting that is truly it no it's a slow week sorry sorry UK friends alright just a couple more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week Loki
4570936	4571417	All right.
4573299	4573979	So let's see.
4577143	4585792	I guess with the Xbox 360, a lot of people weren't really happy about the fact that they kind of put their video services behind a paywall.
4586332	4590033	Well, with the PlayStation 4, that's not going to be the case.
4591154	4596756	If you want to watch Netflix or something like that, you don't have to have PlayStation Plus to do that.
4596816	4602378	You can actually just view all of their video services, Netflix, Hulu, etc.
4602978	4604939	So that's kind of nice that they're doing that.
4605479	4612790	And free-to-play games, I guess, aren't going to require PlayStation Plus, but that's up to the publisher whether they do that or not.
4614152	4616296	So there's still a chance that they might.
4616576	4619721	But I think it's kind of cool that they're doing that.
4620320	4622761	I think it's another selling point over Xbox One.
4622801	4627084	I hate to be one of those people dogpiling on Microsoft, but it is what it is, guys.
4627824	4635728	Sony offering that for free does make that PlayStation 4 a slightly more attractive living room box for some people.
4637129	4640210	Again, the Xbox One integrated Skype thing is neat.
4640871	4643152	It's not $500 neat for me, but it's neat.
4643772	4645293	That's something PS4 doesn't have, I guess.
4647654	4647914	Alright.
4650538	4654761	Jack Trenton talking to GameTrailers saying the last Guardian is quote on hiatus.
4673944	4697884	further quote we got so many projects out there from so many great teams projects never ultimately go away so The Last Guardian is certainly not going away but it's on hiatus right now a lot of back and forth with this game you know Lita a while ago said that the game was still in development but you know now it's not I heard that it was still in development too it was kind of confusing
4698044	4700826	You know, this is just the new Final Fantasy Versus XIII.
4700867	4702628	Or better yet, it's the new Duke Nukem Forever.
4703549	4704850	They're putting it out for PlayStation 4.
4705450	4710215	I think that's exactly what's happening is it's going to be a PlayStation 4 title and it's just taking its little time.
4711776	4712497	Maybe next year.
4713658	4714238	Maybe next year.
4714278	4724347	But in the meantime, instead of looking forward, let's look back to a more classic time in video games history with a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week.
4725444	4731687	DarkSakura is going to reach into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you ungrateful children should be playing this game immediately.
4732127	4734749	Right now, break out your Neo Geo.
4734769	4736069	You got a good one this week, DarkSakura.
4736329	4736910	What is the classic?
4737010	4741592	I have to do my quote from the anime of this because the dub was so awful.
4742252	4743973	Feel the storm, it's coming.
4744814	4747895	Yeah, Dan actually quotes that all the time because my husband is a dork.
4748535	4749256	It's from Fatal Fury.
4751197	4755341	Fatal Fury was the series that pretty much led into King of Fighters.
4755481	4761787	In fact, the first Fatal Fury was called Garou Densetsu, the King of Fighters.
4762587	4767652	So the very first game, well, as it came out over here actually, was Fatal Fury, King of Fighters.
4768753	4774197	It came out for the arcade, of course, for Neo Geo CD, Mega Drive.
4774217	4777860	It came out on the Sharp computer, the SNES, PS2, Virtual Console.
4777880	4778761	It's been on everything.
4779201	4784585	And of course it spawned its better known sequels, Fatal Fury 2 and Fatal Fury Special.
4785486	4793473	There was also Fatal Fury 3, Road to the Final Victory, Real Bout Fatal Fury, Real Bout Fatal Fury Special, Real Bout Fatal Fury 2, The Newcomers.
4794773	4804476	There was a real bout, Gairo Densetsu Special, Dominated Mind, Fatal Fury Wild Ambition, Fatal Fury First Contact, and Gairo Mark of the Wolves, which is probably my favorite in the series.
4805196	4807296	Because it was pretty badass.
4807656	4815658	So anyway, with these games, the big mechanic that these fighting games brought in is that, well, for the first one you could only play three characters.
4815678	4818359	You had Terry Bogard, you had Andy Bogard, and Joe Higashi.
4819099	4824523	Who had to fight against some of the bad guys coming up in their way.
4825723	4831687	The thing about this one is that it had sort of this multi-plane type of setting.
4832007	4837091	Where you could dodge moves by jumping from the foreground to the background and vice versa.
4838131	4845656	And as these evolved in later versions, it even had... I think it was on Fatal Fury 3...
4847037	4847297	Fatal Fury 3
4865337	4868238	and they just crack the glass and slump to the floor.
4869378	4880540	So yeah, it is a really neat series and like I said, it gave us the King of Fighters series, which is, I'm sure as a lot of people know, is probably one of my favorite fighting game series altogether.
4882340	4891822	I myself have two of them on Neo Geo, which if you can play them on the Neo Geo, just do that because that is the way to play any type of SNK game.
4893542	4904306	As far as the series goes, it actually had a sister series that was called Art of Fighting that was set in exactly the same universe so it was why a lot of the characters crossed over.
4906286	4908327	Quick question, was World Heroes in that same universe?
4909033	4913220	I do not think World of Heroes was because none of the characters in World of Heroes showed up in King of Fighters.
4913400	4917146	Okay, I thought there was another series where they started showing up in King of Fighters, but I guess that wasn't World of Heroes.
4917226	4921813	As they started combining those universes, keep in mind that they threw in the Ikari Warriors universe.
4922234	4922494	Oh, yeah.
4922514	4923876	They threw in Psycho Soldier.
4924673	4925794	I kind of lost track of this.
4925895	4928458	I like Fatal Fury a lot, actually, at the time.
4929179	4934865	Not so much the original, although I understand why it's worthy of a Classic Game of the Week, but more like Special probably was my big one.
4935106	4938250	Fatal Fury Special was, I think, the one that I saw in the arcades most.
4939551	4943977	But, I mean, it gave us Mai Shiranui and her boobs.
4945200	4948423	Which, such a big outcry about the character.
4948583	4949764	I thought she was hilarious.
4950685	4958051	But, you know, she also was probably my favorite to play in that game next to Kim Capone later on.
4958888	4960649	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4987276	4990138	I mean, yeah, you had your good masher characters.
4990178	4992419	I mean, yeah, I think that Mai was a masher character.
4992759	4994140	Yuri was a masher character.
4994440	4998583	I mean, she was a lot of charge moves, but Yuri was a major masher character.
4999323	5000744	Especially with her flying butt powers.
5003303	5014928	But for the most part, it gave us such a huge list of characters, too, that, like I said, carried over into King of Fighters.
5015348	5022511	Even Ryo Sakazaki was in two of the Fatal Fury games, who was an Art of Fighting character.
5023331	5025292	On top of that, this is the game that also...
5028399	5034905	I mean, basically, leading into Art of Fighting gave us one of our first big multi-game crossovers.
5035085	5038007	Which, I mean, now we have a Versus series now.
5038488	5042191	I think pretty much because of Fatal Fury and it leading into the King of Fighters series.
5042971	5045233	You know, King of Fury... King of Fury.
5045874	5049217	King of Fighters was pretty much Art of Fighting and...
5051118	5054819	Fatal Fury, mixed with a few other SNK games.
5055439	5062601	But that was our first big versus thing and led us into... Yeah, Capcom versus SNK 2, which wouldn't have been possible without these games.
5062941	5066402	It's probably like my favorite 2D fighter ever, which I'm sure a lot of people feel that way.
5066482	5070363	And a lot of people want to say that it's, you know, the X-Men versus Street Fighter and all that.
5070503	5071103	No, no, no, no.
5071543	5072363	It started with KLF.
5072923	5075884	I really think it started with KLF, which, like I said...
5076704	5085707	came from Fatal Fury, and even in the Fatal Fury universe with Art of Fighting, Art of Fighting led to everybody's favorite joke character, Dan Hibiki.
5086507	5097650	Because it was a combination, his dad was supposed to be like a parody of Mr. Karate, and then he was, what was it, Robert Garcia and Ryo combined.
5098294	5099835	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5115123	5117224	King of... Not going back to King of Fighters.
5117484	5123907	Fatal Fury was pretty generic as far as you have punches, you have special moves, you have super moves.
5124527	5128149	The later games you built up meters, you had combos, you had all of the same stuff.
5128990	5136834	But this one, the thing that really set it apart was that multi-plane fighting and the fact that it gave birth to an entire...
5137754	5141156	Lineage of fighting games right after that.
5141596	5148319	So I'm going to go for the whole Fatal Fury series just because of what came from it.
5148619	5151140	And again, my favorite in the series is Garou Densetsu.
5152780	5154581	because I like playing as Rock Howard.
5155481	5156381	Classic Game of the Week.
5156461	5156981	And Blue Mary.
5157321	5160302	Classic Game of the Week, Fatal Fury for the Neo Geo.
5161142	5161582	Great pick.
5161602	5165423	Again, another one of those picks you go, like how many weeks have you done a Classic Game of the Week?
5165443	5168244	About 300 weeks now and somehow this never came up before?
5168424	5170444	How many different games have we had that happen with?
5172205	5173005	It's always funny.
5173545	5174165	It's always funny.
5174565	5179007	Alright, well, you may have done you didn't do like Fatal Fury Special or Fatal Fury 2 one week?
5179107	5179628	I looked.
5179828	5180128	Wow.
5180468	5180888	Alright.
5181349	5186891	Then again, I didn't look under Garou Densetsu, but I figured that if anyone was putting it down there, they would have done either.
5186911	5188993	Yeah, the wiki people are pretty good about that.
5189273	5191634	Alright, we got plenty more to come in Part B tonight.
5191714	5193975	Fugle Question of the Week and more news.
5194415	5195616	Even stuff that's not just E3.
5195896	5201199	Your emails and yes, your phone calls when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
5210455	5216522	Hi there, this is Elliot B, and you're participating with Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.
5217163	5223591	And I want to use my voice to tell you that Donkey Kong Country 2 is the best game ever released on the Super Nintendo.
5223931	5227015	It has musical apes fighting reptilian pirates.
5227475	5228637	What more could you ask for?
5230071	5230491	Oh, I don't know.
5230531	5231792	Maybe a new Metroid instead.
5231892	5232412	Just saying.
5233133	5233633	Just saying.
5233673	5234313	Throwing it out there.
5234373	5234513	No.
5234994	5236775	Thank you very much to Elliot for leaving that bumper.
5237515	5238676	I really appreciate it there.
5238716	5248180	If you want to leave a bumper for us, more information available on our forum, the VOG Network forums, vognetwork.com and just look for the word forums at the top of the screen.
5248200	5249001	It's not that hard to find.
5249541	5253423	I just bought a Donkey Kong game on 3DS literally weeks ago, and now they're announcing another...
5271189	5276994	Now I realize the one on 3DS is a little different, but I feel like Donkey Kong Overload.
5277014	5278115	I could have gone for a new Metroid.
5278155	5284041	It just doesn't look that different, aside from, oh, now the barrels will shoot you into the background.
5284401	5287004	It's not exactly just 2D.
5287164	5290447	To be fair, though, those games are rock-solid platformers.
5290867	5294971	They're super fun, and that's just where I think that success is going to be in.
5296708	5301093	TigerClaw on chat says, Rob, actually I want a new Star Fox.
5301413	5302013	That would be good.
5302033	5304616	And not that adventures bullshit either, but that would be good.
5305056	5306117	A new Star Fox would be good.
5306157	5308380	But nothing would top a new F-Zero.
5309220	5314505	Maybe after this Mario Kart 8 thing, which does look good, maybe we can get that as our racing game for 2014.
5314546	5314626	Okay.
5316247	5317228	A man can dream.
5318028	5318668	A man can dream.
5319048	5321789	I also want to make sure we say at some point tonight a happy Father's Day.
5322390	5326251	I know we were busy talking about E3 in the beginning there, but let us not forget it is Father's Day.
5326552	5331754	So happy Father's Day to all the father or fatherly figures out there, especially our own Loki.
5332574	5332774	Yeah.
5332834	5333695	I don't know.
5334035	5338817	Is Josh at the age where he can kind of recognize Father's Day yet and wish you a happy one?
5339117	5339257	No.
5339297	5339697	Not quite?
5340257	5340438	No.
5340618	5340918	All right.
5341338	5342118	Well, maybe next time.
5342658	5342738	Eh.
5344079	5348961	If my BFF is listening, then tell Chris I said Happy Father's Day.
5348981	5349661	There you go.
5350562	5352623	And tell Julian to clean his room to be nice.
5353723	5358505	I'll wish Alan a Happy Father's Day because Sanrio the kitty is very well taken care of.
5358845	5361046	And he sends me videos when I'm out of town and everything.
5361727	5363747	Even though she was very antisocial.
5364068	5366669	I still need to get a good picture of her to put on the interwebs.
5367749	5371291	Is Alan ever going to come over here and talk to me about what he thought about E3 and all this stuff?
5372211	5374752	Oh, we finally had the comment in chat, by the way.
5374812	5375333	Who dat is?
5375393	5376033	My baby daddy.
5376593	5377473	Yay, putting him on the spot.
5377513	5377974	Hi, Alan.
5377994	5378614	Long time no talk.
5379074	5379354	Hello.
5379754	5380415	Welcome to the show.
5380595	5380895	Thank you.
5380915	5382456	Do you have anything you want to plug while you're here?
5383316	5385717	Everyone's saying that Microsoft killed Sony.
5386397	5392280	Or, sorry, Sony killed Microsoft at E3, but more like Microsoft killed themselves and then Sony just showed up with pizza and a bag of weed.
5395522	5397122	Why y'all mad and sad?
5397162	5398163	We got good shit here.
5400515	5403700	I asked you if you had anything you wanted to plug and that was your answer.
5403720	5407304	It was essentially pizza and weed, but that's alright.
5407665	5408887	I don't run any shows.
5409327	5410028	What would I plug?
5412799	5415321	You listen to other people's shows more than you listen to mine.
5415341	5416462	Do you want to plug the Nerdist?
5416502	5416842	You know what?
5416902	5418023	I'm all for the Alan show.
5418263	5419244	Alan needs his own show.
5419344	5421746	Alan does need his own show, but he's a little shy.
5421806	5422767	Would you do your own show, Alan?
5423207	5423407	No.
5423727	5423968	See?
5424128	5425048	He wouldn't do it.
5425689	5428171	He walks on here, gives his witty commentary, and then leaves.
5429032	5430593	Any other observations about this year's E3?
5432586	5443134	There's a lot of really bad misinformation about the Xbox One, and I kind of feel bad for Microsoft even though they've brought it on themselves because all the made-up shit about their console is completely believable, even if it's not true.
5443695	5446237	Oh, like the whole it's only launching in 21 states thing?
5447535	5466794	There's the 21 country IP address thing, but no, there was that post about if your account is banned, all of your licenses, even if it's attached to a physical disk, are deactivated, which is not true, but that super fits into what they're legitimately doing, that it's super easy to believe something like that.
5467294	5469055	It's everybody dogpiling on Microsoft.
5469075	5470896	Let's kick them while they're down.
5471176	5472696	How dare they implement these DRMs?
5472756	5473737	Kick, kick, punch, punch.
5473757	5477738	They also said at the end of the console cycle that they're not going to shut off the servers.
5479939	5481159	That's years away.
5482751	5482911	Yeah.
5483612	5484533	And I didn't know either.
5484593	5486256	I just found this out yesterday.
5486896	5497730	The 24-hour ping to make sure that your shit works, the internet connectivity, if you're playing your game at a friend's house under your account, it pings once an hour because it's not your console.
5499012	5499372	It's a mess.
5500994	5507415	and just so you know, Alan at live.vognetwork.com Let's see, RawSteelUT agrees with you in part.
5507455	5509036	Sony really only needed to show up.
5509656	5511676	Misty says, I approve of an Alan show.
5511896	5514737	SSU100Matt says, Alan has plenty of drop the mic moments.
5516897	5517597	Because I'm the best.
5519438	5519718	Drop.
5520138	5523199	Alright, anything else quickly before we say bye and get into rapid fire news?
5524379	5525119	Stanley, I was shy.
5525996	5526537	Yeah, she is.
5527417	5528238	She's a good kitty, though.
5528558	5530740	All right, let's get into rapid-fire news.
5531141	5531381	Loki.
5532262	5532602	All right.
5534384	5541270	So, one of the things that they talked about during the Microsoft press conference is that they're going to be getting rid of the Microsoft points.
5541830	5542111	So...
5542631	5545113	How's that going to work now that I have Microsoft Points?
5545173	5546094	How's that going to convert?
5546534	5547955	Well, they're just going to convert it over.
5547975	5550877	They're going to take your space bucks and make them into actual bucks.
5550937	5557082	So in North America, 80 points or less to the dollar will exchange to that dollar.
5557982	5569551	However, there is one little bullet point on there, or asterisk, I guess, that when they do convert those into actual dollars, they must be spent within a year.
5569751	5571733	Otherwise, you lose them.
5573877	5599711	which is bullshit if you ask me but them be the you know terms I guess that's kind of bullshit I agree but hopefully I didn't have enough left in my account where you know I'll buy one Xbox Live Arcade game and that's it I still got 20 bucks because I tried buying a game for 20 bucks and it took money off my credit card instead of using the points that I already had thank you
5600259	5607244	It's funny, I got two points cards for my birthday and I've only used one of them so that I could play stuff on Rock Band.
5607785	5611427	So that I could sing Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots, thank you.
5612688	5617252	So now I think I'm just going to buy all the Mass Effect gear for my character even though I don't touch it on the Xbox.
5619747	5630455	Alright, another cool announcement is Twitch was saying that, you know, because they have a partnership with the Xbox One where it's going to be integrated in there so you can stream to Twitch.
5631396	5643385	But it's also got this software development kit that actually will allow anybody to integrate it into their consoles to broadcast from any platform, including the PlayStation 4 if they really wanted to.
5644006	5645767	Wasn't the OUYA supposed to be getting a Twitch thing too?
5646035	5646495	Thanks for watching!
5665470	5668633	Um, I don't think, yeah, I don't think it has enough power to do that.
5669174	5671016	Um, so, whatever.
5672058	5676723	Um, but yeah, it's gonna be cool that they can integrate this into a bunch of stuff.
5676783	5679867	So, I think it's very possible that we'll see that coming to, um...
5682270	5684932	I think a little competition is healthy I'd like to see more options than just Twitch out there
5701025	5728321	and last but not least of course they were talking about Summer of Arcade it's coming August 7th and will include such titles as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows also a remake or reboot if you will of Flashback the old 1992 classic Brothers A Tale of Two Sons and Charlie Murder which is being done by the guys that did the Dishwasher game so that should be good
5731235	5760067	and of course no word if they're still doing that deal where you buy all the games you get money back type thing any pricing or free games or free games all the way alright I got some news real quick one of them about the game Ultima Forever don't get too excited it's not really a PC game it's that iOS game the Ultima iOS game that's being made some of the currency was really balanced this week it's out in Canada because EA tends to beta a lot of this type of stuff in Canada and then they release it in the US
5761488	5764992	How does that make our Canadian listeners feel that they're beta testers for this?
5780929	5784834	and increasing storage space and your stash was lowered and so on and so on.
5785335	5790321	So they're trying to not make it so crazy, I guess, where you're going to feel like you're forced to buy things.
5790781	5795367	However, the highest quality chests, they went up in price as part of this balancing.
5795427	5796849	So I guess not everything was a win.
5798671	5799212	Interesting...
5800373	5802294	Talk out there about the new Zelda game.
5802374	5804916	Look, we all know there's going to be a new Zelda game.
5804956	5807977	It will probably be the big thing that Nintendo shows in 2014.
5809158	5811739	But the producer of the series said something interesting this week.
5812399	5812760	E.G.
5813100	5816362	Anuma said this week that he's a big fan of Skyrim.
5817683	5839484	and uh this is very interesting uh so he was asked if he was looking at any other titles for inspiration for the new Zelda game he said Skyrim obviously I play other games and I'm curious what Zelda fans like about the Skyrim experience maybe there are some Zelda fans who are looking for something similar out of a Zelda game but I don't look at the technology that made these games possible I don't look at what's happening in the game but how it made me feel
5840024	5867846	what in the game moved me and how I can bring out those same emotions to players who play my games my intent isn't to copy them but those are the things that stay with you as a player it's not what you see about the game that makes you feel excuse me it's not what you see but how the game makes you feel that makes you feel closer to the experience it's more about the feeling and expression of emotions in the game and I do take that into consideration when working on my own projects so could Link be taking the arrow to the knee in the next installment?
5868166	5870067	I think open world is what they're talking about.
5870267	5872688	Well, actually, most of the games are open world.
5873028	5880091	Yeah, I'm thinking, too, like, you know, maybe a lot of the... In Skyrim, you tend to really be able to interact with everything.
5880751	5881932	Maybe that's part of it, too.
5882372	5883832	Maybe building more side quests.
5883852	5884273	I don't know.
5884293	5884933	It could be interesting.
5885493	5896199	I always thought, you know how in Wind Waker, well, spoiler, there's a portion of it where you go under the sea and you see the 3D world that's down there.
5896659	5898921	And I'm like, why wasn't this Wind Waker?
5899181	5900662	Because that would have been amazing.
5900982	5904584	So I'm hoping that it's something like that, but, you know, better graphics.
5907595	5912898	Did they maybe include that in the remake of Wind Waker HD?
5926727	5928730	to seaweed is always greener.
5929090	5930812	Everything looks better in HD.
5931393	5932575	Alright, forget it.
5933756	5935218	Also, something else about Nintendo.
5935538	5936980	Retro is actually coming out.
5937201	5939524	Funny we had that discussion earlier in the show.
5939984	5943589	Retro saying that it was hard to decide between Metroid and Donkey Kong.
5944758	5946940	I'm sure the Metroid game will happen sometime this generation.
5946960	5947601	It's just not right now.
5968493	5979785	Also, what I found interesting about the new Super Mario 3D World, I think what a lot of people are very excited about is that the Mario and Luigi and characters that are in the game play like they do in Super Mario 2 on the NES.
5980205	5988033	And if you think about it, we haven't really seen a game implement the characterization of those characters since that game, you know, with Peach floating and all that.
5988073	5989635	So that was really cool that they brought that back.
5990035	5993757	Well, Peach wasn't originally planned as a playable character in Mario 3D World.
5993777	5997019	Because you know, in the last few games, it's been Mario, Luigi, and the Two Toes.
5997039	5999641	Because female protagonists do not sell games.
6001102	6001502	Really?
6002803	6005605	Obviously, he said that with his tongue firmly planted in cheek.
6005685	6007066	But, well, you know...
6008223	6012866	Nintendo got a lot of kudos this week for announcing some really awesome female characters.
6012946	6017669	Not just Peach, but the Wii Fit Trainer as a character in Super Smash Bros.
6017689	6023032	Yeah, I thought that was cool, and I'm glad that there were no rape jokes during their presentation of Smash Bros.
6023212	6025234	That's a whole nother Oprah.
6025334	6025694	All right.
6026214	6030037	Anyhow, and he's referring to what happened at the Microsoft thing, if you didn't know.
6030557	6030877	Anyhow...
6032618	6040641	A comment from Yoshiaki Koizumi said, I think she adds a lot of the sense of completion when you get in multiplayer.
6040961	6044863	You can have different people choosing different characters based on their personality or whoever they like.
6045223	6047464	And Princess Peach is just really a lot of fun to play.
6048044	6051085	But yeah, Peach was not originally the greatest playable character in the game.
6052306	6056067	Which means the plot isn't that they're rescuing her for a change.
6056167	6057548	So that's good, I think.
6059440	6061423	And hell, I like playing as Princess Peach.
6061483	6063045	That float ability is badass.
6063986	6067972	She's kind of actually way better than the others because of that ability.
6067992	6070575	But maybe this game will be more balanced than Mario 2 was.
6070695	6071076	We'll see.
6072297	6073118	DarkSakura.
6073159	6075662	My iPad just completely crashed on me.
6075702	6076283	Give me a second.
6076543	6076944	Oh, hooray.
6077304	6078365	PC, 3DS, and the Wii U eShop.
6103622	6109083	So that is going to be super awesome cool, which is funny because I was playing Super Pac-Man just the other day.
6110003	6112064	And then also a trademark in the U.S.
6112124	6113664	is Contra Run and Gun.
6115545	6123526	They did tease a new Contra at E3 in 2011, but now we actually have a trademark to go with it.
6124207	6125787	And last but not least...
6126767	6132394	The inspiration for our kneel before VOG logo that went a while back.
6132494	6133876	Which not a lot of people got, unfortunately.
6133936	6134757	It was our teaser.
6134837	6136820	But maybe now that there's a movie out, which I want to see.
6136860	6138181	You want to see the new movie, The Man of Steel?
6138201	6138802	I want to see that.
6138842	6141826	Becky went and saw it today and said it was okay, but the end of it took forever.
6142386	6142707	Interesting.
6143862	6146104	So anyway, oh thank you GeicoAd for running.
6146684	6152869	Anyway, so for Injustice Gods Among Us, a new character is going to be added and it is Zod.
6153469	6154830	Mew before Zod.
6156011	6156571	Son of Jor-El.
6156591	6157952	Which better be said in the movie.
6158213	6160894	He better freaking, yeah.
6160934	6162155	I don't want spoilers in chat.
6162696	6164217	I will slap you with a trout if you spoil.
6164237	6165778	If you spoil, we spank.
6166318	6172047	Alright, let's get to the Fugle question of the week.
6172128	6175833	Every week we ask a question on our Facebook and Google Plus communities.
6176314	6177796	Slam it together and you get Fugle.
6181140	6182081	So that was the question.
6202694	6204734	We'd like to know your thoughts on E3, but with a twist.
6204774	6207495	You can't talk about the big press conferences or the new consoles.
6207995	6211096	I know, I know, but there will be plenty of other time on tonight's show to talk about all that.
6211176	6221178	We're looking for what you were excited to hear about that maybe slipped off someone else's radar amongst all the Sony vs. Microsoft press conference with a side of Nintendo Direct chatter.
6221758	6223178	So, let's get to some of the answers.
6223218	6227679	I'll start with Google Plus tonight, because I haven't been starting with them a lot lately, so I want to show them some love.
6228679	6235183	Actdeft on Google Plus says, well, this technically counts as one of the big announcements, but I'm hyped to see a new Mirror's Edge in the works.
6235523	6236144	I'll let it slide.
6236664	6240387	Hopefully the wait won't be as long and the game will be great as the first one, if not more.
6241327	6242868	Deft, I'm going to say 2014.
6243268	6245270	It's definitely not, they're not talking like it's a 2013 game.
6245290	6245490	It's not 2013.
6248051	6251433	Flaco Jones says, I was excited to see gameplay from the enemy within.
6251854	6257637	If they keep to their word and go back to the roots of what makes survival horror great, then it should be an awesome experience.
6257917	6259898	Yeah, that was a comment from Bethesda coming through.
6259958	6266602	One of the first things on the E3.blog network experience was that they are going back to survival horror roots with the enemy within.
6266763	6268964	I heard that it's supposed to be really, really gross.
6270157	6278740	Yay, gross games, except not really, I don't like gross games, but I know there are other people that are into the gross games, so enjoy it.
6278820	6290505	Going to some of the responses on Facebook, James S. says, I feel like the game Killer is Dead might be the one that a lot of people didn't see anything on, but it's definitely a current gen title that people should be checking out.
6290865	6296427	It looks pretty damn awesome, and it's one of the very few current gen titles that are coming out during the remainder of this year.
6296907	6299168	Also, Dark Souls 2, need I say more?
6299488	6311693	Sadly, I don't think it's going to do very well because it comes out right at the same time as Splinter Cell and Saints Row and Madden and... I think there's an audience for it.
6312433	6313013	Yeah, something else.
6313173	6319656	As long as we can still get that mod on the PC version that instead of whenever you get you died, when you die it goes, thanks Obama.
6320276	6320516	What?
6320536	6320737	It's funny!
6338721	6339321	Super Smash Bros.
6339341	6343503	for the 3DS version and the additional characters, Kingdom Hearts 3, duh.
6362490	6370997	I wasn't happy with the announcement of the direction that Metroid is planning to take, basically expanding on the characters of the universe and making a gallery of other bounty hunters besides Samus.
6371497	6374079	And why no new 2D cel-shaded Castlevania?
6374159	6375420	I know a pipe dream, but still.
6378463	6380624	Haseo Sumiwagawa says, Mirror's Edge 2.
6381085	6386109	My boyfriend and I are so excited, but I'm also excited for Kingdom Hearts 3 and Final Fantasy XIV and XV.
6389192	6415658	Burr says I'm a bit excited about what I saw of the new Sonic game Lost World I know I'm probably in for a letdown but Sonic Generations was a bit of a surprise so this could be too Mason D I love this answer this is so win the thing most out of E3 Miyamoto likes In-N-Out Burger confirmed with the picture of Miyamoto at the In-N-Out truck that was in the parking lot I kept seeing that popping up all over Facebook that is hilarious that is great though
6416398	6433615	Ronnie B says the Mirror's Edge reboot is all I care about I think it's extremely impressive EA of all companies managed to seemingly keep everything in its original format I hope they don't nickel and dime the game to death though otherwise it looks impressive like the first I hope the music is equally respected a lot of love for that new Mirror's Edge game the trailer music was awesome
6434131	6438057	Clover N says the Metal Gear Solid 5 trailer looks absolutely amazing.
6438157	6442904	Hope the controls for the most part don't stray too far from the controls of the past Metal Gear Solid games.
6443384	6447049	That was a hell of a way to start off the Microsoft conference.
6447110	6450895	Say what you will about what went down there, but that was a great kickoff.
6452307	6454368	Ragenator says, Well, I think there were some.
6454408	6455128	Nuclear subs, anybody?
6455188	6455428	Matt J says,
6471414	6472695	Well, I haven't read too much about it.
6472735	6475097	I'm currently most excited for Deus Ex The Fall.
6475497	6479200	Haters can say what they want, but I think it's an interesting chapter in the Deus Ex game series.
6479480	6482283	In case you don't know, Deus Ex The Fall is an iOS Android title.
6482323	6484745	It's a sequel to the Deus Ex novel, Icarus Effect.
6485165	6488407	A lot of folks are bitching because it's a mobile title, not a console or PC title.
6488468	6491350	However, I find it looks interesting and potentially a fun game.
6491610	6497775	I'm a diehard Deus Ex fan and excited by the prospect of a mobile, on-the-go game, something not easily done with the other titles.
6498095	6501797	I'm willing to at least give it a shot, unlike most folks who refuse to even acknowledge it.
6502657	6508980	You know, a lot of people have a smartphone, and they might say they're not going to play it all they want, but then when it's like 99 cents, they're like, ooh, gimme.
6510360	6517003	Tigerclaw says, I'm pretty excited about new Super Mario 3D World, Mario in a catsuit, but Princess Peach would look cuter in the catsuit, in my opinion.
6517904	6524046	She does look cute, but the keyword is cute, and not, like, oversexed, which I think is a good thing.
6524847	6525247	Right, Jamie?
6525267	6525367	Right.
6525888	6528230	Yes, it's actually, it looks like those little pajamas.
6528450	6529170	It's tasteful.
6529410	6529911	Yes, it is.
6530031	6530771	It's adorable too.
6530831	6536355	By the way, I saw somebody at E3 in a Pikachu footie pajama thing, head to toe.
6536595	6536916	Yeah.
6537316	6543800	And I'm kind of like, alright dude, you go on with your bad self, but then I'm kind of like, why do people dress up for E3 like that?
6544121	6545061	It's not the place for that.
6545081	6545922	It's not the place for that.
6546442	6547383	It's not Tokyo Game Show.
6548795	6549815	Actually, it would be Comiket.
6549916	6550776	And it's not PAX.
6551596	6553277	But anyway, that's a whole other episode.
6553977	6555658	I'm also looking forward to Mario Kart 8.
6555718	6557799	Too bad we'll have to wait until 2014 for those two.
6558219	6563141	The new game on Mad Max would be interesting, even though there has already been a Mad Max game on the NES.
6563581	6565702	This one being made by the developers of Just Cause.
6565762	6567843	I remember the Mad Max game on the NES.
6568383	6570544	Boy, oh boy.
6571504	6579669	Anyway, GamerGirl says, mostly excited for, I know it's not PS4 exclusive, but Final Fantasy Realm Reborn, Lightning Returns, and the new Kingdom Hearts.
6579990	6581651	I think you're a Square Enix fangirl.
6582891	6591116	Andy R. says, I listened to last week's OLR after Monday and hearing all the ragging on, well, if Microsoft's doing it, then Sony must be doing it too, was really amusing to me.
6591477	6594278	Sorry, Loki, I'll admit I chuckled at your cynicism a few times.
6594619	6597420	Before the pressers, I was worried too, though, so I can't be too hard on you.
6597801	6599962	That aside, I was rather impressed with Destiny.
6600302	6603847	I don't care for MMOs or FPSs, but the gameplay shown looked really fun.
6604307	6607211	And though we all knew a new Smash Bros.
6607231	6609654	was coming, I was pretty excited to buy the reveal.
6609774	6617224	That and Bayonetta 2 might convince me to buy a Wii U. Shane replied saying nothing but Final Fantasy XIV about 14 times.
6617264	6617905	Copy-pasted.
6618665	6619486	It's beautiful.
6620666	6621847	And then Let's Have Tea.
6622588	6623528	I always love that name.
6623568	6624589	Good to hear from you, Let's Have Tea.
6624869	6630092	Let's Have Tea says, your thoughts on the Xbox One family sharing feature and if you guys have even heard of it.
6630152	6635035	It's probably the best feature of the Xbox One and a feature that Microsoft keeps seeming to forget to mention.
6635395	6639298	Now, Let's Have Tea, as much as I love your name, I said no talking about the pressers.
6639798	6642659	But yes, I do believe we did mention that earlier in the show, right, Loki?
6642759	6642979	Yeah.
6643019	6644019	So, there you go.
6645020	6646440	And yes, it does sound interesting.
6646700	6649261	It's just that it's not worth the DRM trade-off.
6649301	6650061	That's my opinion.
6650462	6651182	And I'm sticking to it.

6659285	6660265	There you go.
6660925	6662386	That's the Fugle Question of the Week.
6662826	6664086	Some more news for you guys.
6664166	6667387	Mailbag, FU's of the Week, Twitter, Skype, all coming up in a little bit.
6667827	6668048	Loki.
6668228	6669288	Who reads the mail anyway?
6669728	6670088	You do.
6670509	6671669	Get ready for it.
6671849	6672069	Okay.
6672850	6673230	All right.
6673370	6678032	So Gearbox is facing a lawsuit.
6678653	6683735	And no, it's not over aliens, colonial marines, but it's Duke Nukem Forever.
6684376	6690719	Apparently, Gearbox, of course, after they resumed development of Duke Nukem Forever...
6692125	6699753	I kind of failed to give the payoff of a $2.9 million loan that 3D Realms owed to an unnamed company.
6708677	6712340	Apparently, also, there are some royalties that were due as well.
6714342	6716244	And they just haven't taken care of that yet.
6716724	6732818	And apparently, according to the Gearbox VP of Marketing, Steve Gibson, the reality is Apogee and 3D Realms receive the full benefit of its bargain.
6732858	6736301	Gearbox, in fulfillment of its commitment...
6737061	6741364	I don't know if you've fulfilled your commitments because the game's kind of crap, but whatever.
6741544	6742585	I guess, finished game.
6743565	6749749	Enriched 3DR, saved 3DR from its debts and rescued 3DR from its litigation surrounding failed dozens.
6750109	6765138	So I guess the way it sounds like that they think that because they kind of paid off their debts that they don't get any sort of kickback from Duke Nukem Forever, although I can't imagine it would be that big because I don't think it sold that well.
6765438	6765538	So...
6767519	6768980	But yeah, court case.
6771241	6775643	It's always sad when they're fighting over a game that really wasn't worth fighting over in the end.
6776623	6777724	But money's money, right?
6778244	6780685	Well, I mean, it was really weird with...
6784963	6792508	I remember they were talking about misappropriation of money with Aliens Colonial Marines and going to Borderlands 2.
6792668	6801475	I'm wondering if anything similar happened with the royalties for Duke Nukem Forever and going to Borderlands 2 as well.
6803496	6807619	All right, well, Loki, I know you cared about this because you were asking some questions about it at E3.
6807979	6810661	I didn't see it at E3, but I think Bobby got a quick look at it.
6811381	6813143	It's Mad Catz's Android console.
6813183	6814343	It's just called Mojo now.
6814363	6815924	It's not Project Mojo or any of that anymore.
6815964	6816865	It's called Mojo.
6817465	6824630	And unlike Ouya or what have you, Mojo will run stock Android and connects to the Google Play Store, just like any other smartphone or tablet.
6825050	6830174	So all you need for a game to be playable on Mojo is that it has to come out for Android.
6830774	6833296	And you can tie the Mojo device to your Google Play account.
6833756	6838899	So essentially, this is just literally an Android box for your TV.
6839139	6839559	Literally.
6839799	6844842	Yeah, and what's kind of cool about it, though, is it does support games that don't support controllers.
6845282	6849084	So you can map your controls on the system.
6849124	6853606	They also have emulation for touch controls using a mouse.
6853646	6860770	You can plug in a mouse and keyboard, or you can just use the analog sticks to emulate touch controls as well.
6861190	6866734	And then you can also map all your controls for whatever game on there.
6866754	6868635	I mean, that's pretty awesome that you can do that.
6868775	6871677	And on the show floor, it was running on a Tegra 3 processor.
6871717	6880623	It had HDMI output at 1080p, two USB inputs, 16 gigs of onboard storage that you can expand with mini SD, Bluetooth Classic, Bluetooth Smart.
6880963	6882964	And they're saying, though, this is all subject to change.
6883965	6884846	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6899945	6907030	and I'm wondering if they will increase or put a better processor in there but Taker 3 still though that means it's pretty cheap.
6907370	6921440	It runs on Taker 3 and that's going to be $100 so probably looking around that price range and it's nice so that it supports Android apps just generic Android apps because probably a lot of people have that stuff.
6921640	6924862	It's going to be a very interesting little counter to the Ouya.
6925362	6926143	We'll see what happens.
6927103	6927524	Moving on.
6928536	6930917	Yes, we have some Nintendo news.
6931077	6933938	Actually, something come... I can never pronounce his last name right.
6934478	6935679	Reggie Fils-Aimé, right?
6936099	6936979	Yeah, Fils-Aimé.
6937219	6937919	Exactly, okay.
6938319	6938820	Very French.
6940100	6948143	He basically has gone on record saying that he has the key to limiting used game sales, and that's making better games.
6949113	6951816	Making games that people are going to want to replay.
6953117	6953978	Here's a quote from him.
6953998	6957221	He says, So we see that the trade-in frequency on Nintendo content is much less than the industry average.
6957261	6957661	Much, much less.
6968363	6971725	and, you know, I have to look at it in terms of my own collection.
6972566	6976829	We really do get, when we trade anything in, it's almost always something that was on the 360.
6978370	6983313	We, most of our PS3 games and our Wii games actually still have a lot of replayability.
6983333	6984674	We still play our GameCube games.
6985354	6988536	So, yeah, I actually really do agree, you know.
6989697	6994999	You may be thinking that these are really simplistic games but they do have high replayability value.
6995860	7001762	Like, for example, out of your collection, Rob, what do you say that you've played the most of?
7003723	7007186	Out of all... What games do you always find yourself going back to play?
7007306	7007747	MMOs.
7008287	7009028	Well, okay.
7010109	7010929	Besides MMOs.
7010949	7011950	Those don't count.
7012030	7015133	Games with the solid multi... Things I can play with my friends.
7015173	7016654	I mean, that usually is MMOs.
7017295	7021439	But like Mass Effect 3 was a good example because the multiplayer mode added a lot of life to that game.
7021459	7022740	We did a whole lot with that one.
7023220	7029706	But I think the thing, too, is that, like, okay, for example, any time that we have a party at my house, what happens?
7029746	7030647	We bust out Rock Band.
7031268	7031888	Good point, yeah.
7031908	7034210	But it's the big thing that has the replayability.
7034291	7039816	It used to be back in the day we'd bust out Smash Brothers or Mario Party or Mario Kart.
7039836	7042018	We'd bring out a racing game that we could four-screen.
7042038	7047203	Something that, you know, you could kind of screw with your friends and not feel bad about it because it was cute.
7047223	7047323	Right.
7047643	7050647	Solid multiplayer goes a long way in a game's life.
7051148	7055174	And I'm not necessarily talking about just online, but having that old standby.
7056312	7059734	What was the first thing that everybody else was saying when Animal Crossing came out?
7060135	7060975	Give me your friend code.
7061636	7064077	I need your village code.
7064157	7064958	I need a peach.
7065018	7065758	Who's got a peach?
7065999	7067700	Come over to shake your trees.
7067800	7075685	I think the whole strength that Nintendo games have like this is that instead of just having your friends list, you're building a community around the IP.
7076706	7078967	And I think that that also adds to their replayability.
7079087	7082630	And yeah, you do see a lot fewer Nintendo games traded in.
7083137	7087279	The street passing on Animal Crossing is so smart, too, because I love looking at other people's homes.
7087819	7088060	Yeah.
7089020	7089240	Fun.
7089780	7092462	I also, by the way, was enjoying the Sahara quotes.
7093682	7094823	I can't wait till I get my coffee.
7096221	7096481	Alright.
7097822	7098543	I love that though.
7098863	7099083	Yeah.
7099684	7100584	Just make better games.
7100684	7101805	You want people to stop selling them?
7101825	7102266	Make them better.
7102386	7103907	Well, and it's simple.
7104547	7107149	I mean, I'll tell you this even.
7108450	7110672	I go back and play SNES games all the time.
7111333	7114895	I mean, we're all kind of in that boat where we're classic gamers too.
7115616	7120820	But I like to go back and play older games that I think are...
7124068	7125250	Just still fun.
7125811	7127735	We've even gone back and had Bomberman parties.
7129257	7131221	Who doesn't like a good game of Bomberman?
7131261	7133905	It's a game that's pretty much lasted through...
7135268	7136429	through the years.
7136870	7140232	It's solid, and that's what I think Nintendo's focusing on is making solid games.
7141373	7142915	So anyway.
7142995	7147739	Queen Simia in our chat room is, I think, singing about peaches, saying, really love your peaches, want to shake your tree.
7149020	7149921	I can't help it.
7149961	7151322	Suddenly I'm thinking of the teaches of peaches.
7151342	7151883	It's a song.
7154125	7155526	It's the lyric from a song.
7155546	7160550	I know, but now I'm thinking of peaches, the dirty, dirty musician from Canada who sings all the, you know.
7161711	7164293	or now I'm thinking of the President of the United States.
7164493	7166595	What else is in the teaches of peaches?
7166795	7168716	Oh, millions of peaches.
7169097	7171859	Yeah, but I don't know.
7171939	7173460	You can't go wrong with a joker.
7173820	7175461	All right, save us from the peach talk, Loki.
7177062	7177322	Really?
7177503	7178283	We have to do that?
7178343	7179664	No.
7179724	7180725	We can talk princess peach.
7182762	7197830	Okay, so one of the theories, and definitely a theory I had, with a lot of people suspected, EA getting rid of their online pass just before the announcement of the Xbox One and its features.
7200151	7209336	EA, though, saying that, hey, even though PlayStation 4 came out and revealed that they're not going to be kind of following suit with the Xbox One,
7209996	7231879	they are still not going to bring back the online pass and also said you know of course reaffirmed that you know the getting rid of the online pass was not because of the Xbox One they say that it just wasn't working out for them and I don't know what to believe from it I kind of want one hand want to just say I don't buy it because I think that they were kind of banking on both systems doing that but
7232079	7232740	and DarkSakura.com.
7248157	7276380	just make it easier for people to buy games and then just have a ton of DLC I don't know if necessarily Nickelodeon and Diamond but they've attempted to do that with Dead Space 3 and stuff so maybe that's where they're kind of seeing it and I think that kind of makes sense also with the Xbox One and their game sharing is that's where they're probably going to try to make a lot of the money is since you're not buying copies of the games and you're going to get a lot less sales now because of that that DLC is going to be more
7277160	7282123	I know you all love it when we keep bringing this game up, but Mass Effect 3 really did it great.
7282403	7287525	Not just the free DLC, but all the story DLC was so good.
7288046	7289706	Especially with the big apology.
7290107	7296830	To be fair, it was probably better in Mass Effect 2 overall, but still, a good example of DLC done right.
7296890	7298211	None of it flat out sucked.
7298731	7299911	You can't sit there and go to the DLC.
7300172	7304414	There were things you could complain about later.
7304514	7304794	Yeah.
7305494	7305915	Really?
7306175	7307656	Is that what happens in Omega?
7307756	7309438	I'm sorry, did I mention a particular one?
7309578	7309938	Sorry.
7311499	7315402	Although I did completely find the Citadel DLC absolutely hilarious.
7315663	7316123	Just saying.
7317424	7325150	And then, of course, they're saying that now they're working on this gamer-first use game policy for next-gen.
7325170	7326331	Yeah.
7327652	7331175	Basically, I don't know what exactly that means.
7331595	7333296	Gamers first and customer first?
7333416	7339380	Does that mean that there are going to be no restrictions at all or they're going to try something else?
7341682	7342062	I don't know.
7342142	7342963	I'm guessing that...
7344341	7345021	It's not this idea.
7345362	7354346	Although I think it's made it definitely the response to the Xbox One DRM and limiting news game sales and online passings.
7354566	7359549	I definitely think that publishers are aware of the perception of that.
7359609	7363091	And I think they will maybe think twice about implementing that in the future.
7364892	7368574	Especially if Sony's not doing it anymore and EA's not doing it anymore.
7369114	7369814	Who's really left?
7370074	7373076	Warner Games and Ubisoft.
7373116	7373196	Yeah.
7374236	7374616	That's it.
7375137	7378118	Ubisoft has their whole little tie-in service to Uplay.
7378458	7380438	They can invest in that.
7380778	7383339	That could still be free, but right now they're still passing.
7383559	7387541	THQ can't do it anymore because they're out of business and Deep Silver is not continuing with that, I think.
7388341	7390462	I'm pretty sure they're not because they didn't with Metro.
7393322	7394763	It's kind of on its way out already.
7396212	7404581	Alright, before we get to the next story, a very interesting breaking news that a lot of our chatters are talking about is a tweet that just showed up from Bobby.
7406183	7408345	My house just got struck by lightning.
7409066	7410347	That's why he disappeared from chat.
7410467	7412510	Most of my electronics are fried.
7412990	7413551	I'm fine.
7413571	7413811	Holy crap.
7414151	7426841	But Bobby seems like the type that would have had a surge protector on everything He was telling me to get the power source for the computer When all that stuff went down with one of the live shows But a surge protector isn't a cure-all, trust me
7428154	7429215	Well, I hope everything's okay.
7429275	7432376	I've had a hard drive melted that was hooked to a surge protector.
7432396	7437839	Yeah, I'm hoping when he says fried that he means like they're just, you know, all they need is a quick little fix or something.
7437859	7444322	But seeing that Bobby does a lot with electronics, especially with the VOG, that's a big deal.
7444342	7447463	Well, just stay in touch with us and let us know what we need to do if he can hear.
7447724	7451005	What's up with Lightning and taking out people that do like tech blog stuff?
7451285	7452966	Because usually they're connected.
7453106	7454407	Ars Technica, you know, they...
7455327	7456468	The guy actually got hit by lightning.
7456488	7458969	They can't stop cranking out lightning video games.
7459730	7475478	When I was living with my extra mate, and this was back in the days of dial-up, but we still had a surge protector on both the power supply and on the cable, the internet cable.
7476439	7481962	And still with the direct shot from lightning to her antenna, we fried her hard drive.
7482782	7483503	And the modem.
7484013	7490916	It's really good that you didn't have an Xbox One connected at this time because literally a lightning strike would turn it into a killing death machine.
7490996	7495018	So, you know, it's a good thing that we're still months away.
7495478	7501241	Well, I hope everything's all right because I know his day job relies on electronics and all that.
7501601	7505403	Yeah, I agree with VXJasonXV who said, hopefully you just meant that figuratively.
7505523	7506624	Yeah, I hope so too.
7507584	7508124	I hope so too.
7508545	7509305	We'll find out soon.
7510426	7514369	Moving on, let me get back to the gaming news we had on deck tonight.
7515650	7518933	Nintendo could be releasing a free-to-play game.
7519994	7523437	I know, it would be within the fiscal year, which would end on March 2014.
7524678	7528220	It was during an analyst briefing at E3 that this was announced.
7528261	7529882	So this is something that's actually happening.
7529922	7532204	It's not a Mario game, it's not a Pokemon game.
7532604	7535567	But it could be an already existing franchise to a brand new IP.
7536207	7542809	Now Destructoid had an interesting theory that it could be an Advance Wars game because that would seem to fit in very well.
7543109	7548231	I mean it makes a lot of sense for what could show up on the Wii U and would work with the free-to-play model generally well.
7549871	7555593	Even though a lot of people associate free-to-play with shit games, there's some free-to-play games that are pretty cool.
7556073	7557313	What about like if it's an MMO?
7557593	7559014	MMO, it could be Dragon Quest X.
7561616	7562497	I love your thought, but no.
7562537	7562898	Just no.
7562978	7563979	I would love to be wrong about that, but...
7578092	7580055	I would love to, but I kind of doubt it.
7580916	7582398	Alright, let's get to the mailbag.
7583119	7584961	I don't doubt that you guys send us emails every week.
7585021	7590308	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com And we answer the emails here on the program.
7591289	7592290	Yeah, yeah.
7592471	7594553	I'm sure it's been filling up a little bit after E3.
7595194	7595995	Well, we have four.
7596355	7596575	Okay.
7596695	7597316	Four legit.
7597416	7597916	Four legit.
7599397	7604781	The first one comes from Robert M. Right now, MCPE is my only Minecraft.
7605341	7605721	Excuse me.
7605822	7607002	Not counting the Lego set.
7607623	7610765	Because it's much more convenient for me during commuting and breaks.
7611806	7618070	Unfortunately, Realms won't be of much use to me at home since the app freezes when I open it connected to my home Wi-Fi.
7618490	7621472	This does not seem to affect other apps and I can't access...
7622393	7622653	Sorry.
7622673	7624234	I don't expect anyone to be able to tech support on this.
7624254	7624674	Just odd.
7624814	7625274	That's his haiku.
7625314	7625494	Oh, cute.
7626135	7626275	Yeah.
7626475	7627195	So, yeah.
7644649	7647312	I'm not sure why the issue is with your local Wi-Fi.
7648193	7658624	Although, oddly enough, there's certain apps that I have that require a connection that won't necessarily work on my Wi-Fi, but they'll work on the 3G and they'll work elsewhere.
7659085	7663309	Maybe the problem is related to why the station keeps fucking dropping while we're trying to do a show.
7665031	7666673	Maybe we have the same provider, I don't know.
7666693	7666853	Maybe.
7667520	7668821	Howdy, sentient creatures.
7669781	7672823	After listening to episode 507, I have two thoughts.
7672883	7673983	First of all, a haiku.
7674924	7677345	I was right, but I didn't want to be right.
7677465	7678726	Damn, The Last Guardian.
7679946	7682508	Second, I have a holiday-style greeting for E3.
7683048	7684769	Happy hyperbolic statement period.
7685489	7687270	Stay black, Redertainment Trainer.
7689931	7690291	All right.
7691392	7693193	Sometimes it's painful to be right.
7695441	7696402	This is from Sam.
7697722	7699663	And the message is, Happy E3, OLR Crew.
7700844	7705106	One game I failed to see from Ubisoft this E3 is Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Patriots.
7705527	7709749	Do you think the game has been renamed and re-revealed as Tom Clancy's The Division?
7711201	7715422	I wouldn't think Do you think Ubisoft has more than one team on Tom Clancy games?
7715642	7738927	Yeah, I think so I wouldn't be surprised It doesn't even look similar at all It's probably just something They have Blacklist coming out now I think it's probably being made now for next gen and so it's just Bump back a little bit Fair enough I'm with Loki It could be quarter four next year It makes sense, I think
7740560	7741881	So I was answering a question in chat.
7742321	7745524	I happened to mention that my ex-roommate from college got struck by lightning.
7746465	7748566	Came in smelling that buzzy smell.
7748927	7749067	Ew.
7749167	7750528	With her hair sticking up.
7750908	7751048	Ew.
7751148	7754151	And she just said, I got struck by lightning.
7754391	7755752	And I was like, Meglet, are you okay?
7755792	7756272	Her name was Meg.
7756292	7756873	We called her Meglet.
7757233	7758874	I was like, are you okay?
7759275	7760716	Yeah, I'm gonna lay down.
7761616	7763438	And she didn't get up the rest of the day.
7763458	7764519	I kept checking on her.
7764859	7765960	She got up and she was just fine.
7768953	7770273	You have a lot of weird stories.
7770654	7773274	And then she said it was the second time in her life she'd been struck by lightning.
7773535	7774695	Go buy a lottery ticket.
7774735	7775435	Seriously.
7775475	7778216	I just asked Bobby if it took out the fence.
7780417	7782618	You're such an asshole.
7783178	7785639	He probably lost some of his computers and stuff.
7785659	7786959	You're like, did it hit the fence?
7787539	7788740	Bobby, I'm sorry for laughing.
7788780	7790140	It makes me a horrible human being.
7790760	7791921	I've been in your place.
7792718	7795460	His kitties were at the boarding thing.
7795480	7796741	He can't pick them up till Monday.
7797141	7799642	So the cats aren't affected, just so you guys know.
7799922	7800503	That's important.
7800583	7801363	Yay for the kitties.
7801904	7802604	Think of the kitties.
7803264	7804065	Last email, Rob.
7804525	7808127	And this one is a poem written by Degenerate Johnny.
7808748	7809288	Shall I read it?
7811302	7821687	Once again, E3 has lived up to its name, the event has proven it's still relevant, gamers rejoiced at the sight of upcoming titles, and judging from the drill pedals, E3 is also salivant.
7823107	7833272	Microsoft promises a year of excitement, one full of fun features and games, unfortunately some of them seem to be disappointing, especially the ones that suffer drops in sound and frames.
7834452	7836754	Indeed, Microsoft did not address the hard issues.
7836894	7838455	It seems this year they're rolling the dice.
7838955	7843238	Without explanation of online benefits, $500 is too steep of a price.
7844379	7845800	Sony's conference was impressive.
7845900	7847881	It was full of exciting announcements and games.
7848401	7853205	With the announcement of no restrictions on used titles, it almost made up for Sony's previous shames.
7853965	7857287	Indeed, Jack Trenton was on Cloud9.
7857327	7858288	You could see it on his face.
7858708	7860710	The chanting of Sony's name was most telling.
7860770	7863752	The PS4 will start ahead in the console race.
7864512	7866293	It's like Generation 6 all over again.
7866333	7868073	Sony will come out on top real fast.
7868433	7872594	Wii U started with no games just like the GameCube but will Xbone go the way of the Dreamcast?
7873915	7876675	The excitement and energy never stops at E3.
7877076	7878856	It's an event full of comedy and tragedy.
7879416	7885758	All I can say is that I can't wait for this holiday season and I'm sure the same can be said for the OL Army.
7886758	7889479	Wishing a tubular E3 to all gamers and fathers.
7890179	7890819	Degenerate Johnny.
7892660	7893560	I think I cried a little.
7894051	7896512	That was a very clever little poem.
7896672	7897112	Thank you.
7897152	7897572	Good job.
7898192	7899792	It should be posted on our forums.
7901873	7903193	So there's an update from Bobby.
7904073	7908555	I know this is not gaming news, but obviously we care about Bobby and want him to be alright.
7909375	7917557	As of right now, it looks like I lost all my routers and switches, my audio receiver, my 360, and my Wii U. Ooh.
7918737	7919157	Wow.
7920818	7922718	Are acts of God under warranty?
7923805	7924425	I don't know.
7925186	7926706	Hopefully he's got insurance or something.
7926746	7928927	I mean, there's got to be like a homeowner's insurance.
7928947	7929848	Yeah, homeowner's insurance.
7929868	7935850	Well, most homeowner's insurance will have some type of personal property.
7935930	7936510	Christ.
7936610	7937771	If it's not just dwelling.
7938091	7943473	Anyone from, if not for some reason, anyone from Microsoft or Nintendo listening that can help him out?
7943553	7948015	Oh, one thing I can tell you is that... Oh, God, I wonder if that was his special 360.
7948055	7948135	Yeah.
7950529	7953010	I don't want to say too much, but he had a very special 360.
7953330	7954551	I hope that wasn't it.
7955811	7963854	Well, I can tell you that most insurances in the South, as far as I'm aware, definitely have some sort of hard weather coverage.
7964734	7969776	It's required, so... VXJSXV says acts of God are explicitly not covered by warranty.
7970897	7975738	I would still hope, though, that there would be some type of... I think homeowners insurance would cover something like that.
7975758	7979640	Homeowners insurance or something, yeah.
7979660	7979740	Oof.
7979760	7979860	Lordy.
7979880	7979960	Yeah.
7981489	7983230	I've been in that position.
7983270	7983971	I feel that pain.
7984591	7988174	People underestimate the weather, especially back east.
7990444	7990704	All right.
7991204	7992404	Is that it for the mailbag?
7992645	7993145	Yes, it is.
7993305	7993485	All right.
7993525	7994985	Mailbag at OrangeLawnTrader.com.
7997486	8001747	Another reason I keep reporting on what's going on with Bobby, he may not be back to do a show next week.
8003467	8004567	I'm not confirmed yet.
8004747	8006168	Just let him make that announcement.
8006208	8008268	Watch his Twitter because clearly his cell phone still works.
8008328	8011709	Bobby will be calling us and doing it on Skype.
8012689	8041733	He's more than welcome to, we'll be here Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week How appropriate Well then, first off First off, I think an FU from all of us to Lightning
8042549	8051814	I would like to go ahead, though, and give, especially Brad in the chat room, but people have already been bringing it up, already thinking of ways to help Bobby replace his stuff.
8052634	8054935	We seriously have the best listeners.
8055476	8055896	We do.
8055996	8056456	You know what?
8056556	8067582	And actually, this is one of the things Bobby and I were talking about, is that, you know, if the Voice Geeks Network, we don't have the biggest audience, and that's okay, because I seriously think we have the most loyal audience.
8067682	8069183	And we are so fortunate to have that.
8069243	8069883	You guys are awesome.
8070883	8076265	We have people listening to us that not just give of their time to listen, they give of themselves.
8077045	8079685	And we like to give back to you as much as we can.
8080166	8089108	It's like, I don't need 10,000 listeners if we have 100 awesome, loyal listeners.
8089148	8089768	You know what I mean?
8089828	8090628	It means so much more.
8090768	8093949	And how many of our listeners are we actually totally good friends with now?
8094069	8094789	Yeah, I know.
8094869	8096230	I probably don't need five 360s either.
8098243	8099623	You probably don't, sir.
8099744	8101844	I could probably lend him one.
8101864	8102324	Well, we'll see.
8102344	8103285	Hopefully he's got insurance.
8103305	8103905	We'll find out.
8103985	8105586	I have bad ones.
8105686	8106686	That doesn't do you any well.
8106726	8113448	He's probably trying to process a lot right now, so let's give him a little space, and then I'm sure he'll be able to clear up what's up.
8113468	8114649	I can lend him an NES.
8115649	8115789	No.
8116609	8121891	But yeah, my FU for today goes towards people who drive like assholes.
8121991	8123352	And I'm not just talking about...
8124292	8125273	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8146352	8150377	had tried to get up in the front and cut that person off, but Lexus was just a better driver.
8150957	8157685	And so the BMW driver swerves around and cuts off the BMW driver as soon as there's two lanes again.
8158566	8161990	And I swear that was almost a Rurander.
8162350	8163912	Yeah, Mako drivers, fuck them.
8164252	8165393	No, that would be me.
8165734	8167155	I drive the Mako horribly.
8168757	8176464	and then I think that I've got a sore throat and F you to not having a job.
8177225	8178066	I need one of those.
8179127	8183310	Everybody that I've ever sent applications to, hire me because I'm a really good person.
8184451	8185372	I will work hard for you.
8186653	8188395	That and I'm really good with InDesign.
8191218	8191418	Loki?
8192713	8200436	Fuck you to FPSbox.com, our previous host of the Minecraft server for the VOG Network.
8201076	8205578	And basically, I guess it got sold off or something happened.
8205818	8208439	And basically, the website's running in autopilot.
8208519	8211520	So when the servers go down, nobody answers support.
8211920	8213460	There's no phone anymore.
8213821	8214861	There's no email.
8215361	8216401	Nobody cares.
8216681	8221083	And so actually taking a look at some of the servers that are online, most of them are down right now.
8221403	8224704	And what sucks is the FTP portion of it's down as well.
8224744	8227425	So I can't... I have backups of the server.
8227985	8232106	I can make backups, but I can't access any of them because they're on the FTP server.
8232506	8234847	And it's something with the authentication.
8234867	8234927	It
8235507	8237829	It keeps saying that I have the wrong password even though I don't.
8239610	8240531	And it doesn't matter.
8240711	8244334	So you can't reset it either because their reset password thing is broken.
8246256	8248717	Yeah, I'll just have to start anew if we're actually going to do it.
8248998	8249898	And who knows?
8249958	8251700	We haven't been getting a lot of people on there anyways.
8251720	8252861	Might as well just save myself $10 a month.
8252881	8253121	We'll see.
8257182	8257883	I may change my mind.
8257963	8266492	There's other hosts out there that'll actually let me upload my own JAR files, which I wanted to do in the first place so that we could have cool things like airplanes and cars and guns.
8268054	8268915	I totally want a gun.
8269956	8271097	They have Mass Effect guns, too.
8271277	8271598	You know what?
8271658	8277564	I totally just redid my little sprite to look like my Minecraft person to look like Shepard.
8277584	8277744	Nice.
8278493	8285535	Alright, I'm just going to give an F you to traffic as well because some bitch cut me off today on the freeway and it's like when you're going 80 miles an hour, don't be cutting me off.
8285555	8286215	Does she drive a BMW?
8286815	8289176	No, but I did see a couple of asshole BMW drivers.
8289216	8292617	I'm not saying that all BMW drivers are assholes, but I'm just saying I see a lot of them.
8292837	8294997	I'm starting to agree with Jeremy Clarkson, by the way.
8295558	8296398	BMW drivers.
8297018	8298218	Otherwise, I had a pretty good week.
8298258	8298858	I can't complain.
8298918	8300679	Although, Matt is a good BMW driver.
8302802	8305825	F you to Disneyland for me missing it so much.
8306986	8308026	F you to awkward moments.
8308807	8309568	I'll say that too.
8309808	8310268	Oh, yeah.
8310588	8311729	Very awkward moment.
8311769	8312590	I'll tell you off air.
8312610	8313671	It's not appropriate for on air.
8313731	8314572	It has nothing to do with the show.
8314652	8317414	Well, how about also F yous to elusive ties?
8319756	8320076	All right.
8321017	8324780	Let's move on with a couple more stories and then we'll get to Skyblind.
8324800	8325000	Skyblind.
8326565	8335211	All right, so the new thing for Xbox One, of course, they're talking about their system for achievements and stuff.
8335251	8347059	It's going to be a little bit different, which, by the way, I got to add, you know, this is one thing we didn't talk about, but press conference, they have the day one edition that gives you DLC that is an achievement.
8348020	8348780	So that's kind of lame.
8350822	8355545	I'm sure it's just stupid, like, you know, we were, you know, we bought it day one type thing.
8355905	8356605	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8385991	8389213	and everybody that participated got some stuff.
8389613	8391654	I want to say, I think it was Halo, maybe Halo Reach.
8393174	8405900	And then they're saying that also Xbox One video and music apps can also use achievements to reward people that seek peak content to early access or subscription extensions.
8408041	8409901	So it's interesting that they're going to be doing all that stuff.
8411122	8413663	It sounds interesting that they're kind of revamping their achievement system.
8416085	8416506	I don't know.
8416526	8416826	Just curious.
8437611	8444456	Alright, before we get to your calls tonight, one more story tonight, and it's to kind of put the wrap on all the E3 stories tonight.
8445197	8448620	E3 this year, 48,200 attendees.
8448680	8451342	That's an increase of 2,500 from the prior year.
8451362	8453884	I'm going to bite my tongue, bite my tongue, bite my tongue.
8455644	8480012	40 million dollars in revenue brought to the city of Los Angeles from that next year's E3 June 10th through the 12th also at the LA Convention Center but what will be interesting about next year's show this isn't in the news story but I just if you've been paying attention there will be no more West Hall that's what they're tearing down to make Farmers Field so it'll be interesting to see which is the football stadium for the football team that LA doesn't have yet hello Kensha Hall
8481513	8481873	I don't know.
8481893	8482153	Yeah.
8482513	8484134	Does that mean Kensha Hall is used next year?
8484474	8486836	Or the rumor is they're going to build it.
8486856	8491039	Well, it's not a rumor, but they're going to build an expansion on the other side of the street.
8491939	8494461	But when will that be done is anyone's guess.
8495161	8495942	We have parking a lot.
8497623	8498063	Who knows?
8498163	8498463	Who knows?
8498823	8499604	But there you go.
8501305	8504047	There was a question I didn't get to ask about E3 this year.
8504247	8504487	Sure.
8504527	8509490	Is if they were still handing out balls like they did every year.
8511721	8514311	That used to be the only time I would ever get balls.
8515836	8516720	So, just saying.
8518363	8521624	and Bobby says his podcast gear is fine.
8521964	8523685	Yay!
8523805	8526026	The audio receiver is for my surround sound.
8526066	8528787	So it sounds like his living room got fucked up most of all.
8528867	8530047	That's what it sounds like.
8530107	8532628	He could probably have my audio receiver too because I don't use that either.
8533208	8534689	Everybody's all nice.
8534889	8537010	I just gotta say, you guys rule.
8537110	8546373	I have like a surround sound system that we don't use anymore because Josh is asleep when we watch TV and so we don't need a blast surround sound anymore.
8546593	8551738	Alright, I haven't even given out the damn number and already the Skype line lighting up.
8551758	8557064	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, but you'll have to wait for this guy.
8558445	8559306	Who's on the line here?
8559606	8560287	You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8560307	8560607	Who's this?
8561228	8562069	Orange Lounge Radio?
8562209	8564632	I thought I was calling Best Buy to pre-order my PlayStation 4.
8567735	8569557	Sure, just give me your credit card number.
8570527	8571568	I don't think so, Tim.
8572808	8573369	What's up, buddy?
8574289	8575950	Not too much, not too much.
8577031	8581874	I just want to say that I have to thank Sony.
8582594	8588038	I mean, their presser made me feel like what it was like to be an actual gamer.
8589025	8590205	That's how it hit home for me.
8591046	8594386	You know, there was a very interesting comment left on the VOG Network.
8594406	8601628	I think it was Flaco Jones who said it on last week's show at vognetwork.com said that last week's show was kind of doom and gloom.
8601648	8601928	I don't know.
8601948	8603129	What was the macabre?
8603369	8610611	He said this was very morbid kind of episode because, yeah, I mean, we were playing the funeral march to the Xbox stuff and all that.
8610651	8614432	And I was sitting here going, this is a sad fucking day to be a gamer.
8614772	8618653	But like at the Sony press conference when they hit bullet after bullet after bullet, it was like,
8619333	8621435	Celebrate good times
8637088	8638328	Very much so.
8638408	8641530	I mean, I was so excited after seeing the Kingdom Hearts 3 trailer.
8642050	8644130	I'm playing through Kingdom Hearts 1 right now.
8645591	8649892	Now, are we being... Is the internet as a whole being too fanboy with this?
8649932	8653334	Like, are we being too blinded by Sony's, you know...
8654554	8655034	Yes and no.
8655054	8657875	Coming from the cosplay fandom, anime fandom, I'll say this much.
8657895	8658495	You take something away...
8682031	8685644	fans will never forgive you no matter how well
8686840	8688001	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8714143	8720084	I think just a more direct comparison would be Sony really fucked up in 2006 and now they're back, you know?
8720605	8723445	I mean, well, it's not even necessarily just now they're back.
8723525	8727486	I mean, they slowly were getting their groove back, you know, over the past few years.
8727546	8732667	But I think Microsoft made some really bad personnel decisions in the past few years and it's starting to show.
8732827	8733348	Sorry about it.
8734328	8735188	And you're absolutely right.
8735388	8738269	And I mean, I'm looking at the breakdown of the consoles.
8738309	8738569	I mean...
8739689	8743812	I read the article how the cost of the PS4 is about $325.
8744673	8756722	If the PS4 and Xbox One are similar in hardware and if that's the case, then you're actually paying an extra $100 for Kinect, something that somebody may not even want.
8757883	8763507	I think that's one of Microsoft's huge mistakes is clinging to that Kinect.
8763967	8768250	And I think that's one of the two big, big mistakes they made.
8768690	8771692	And to point out, I've actually gone on record saying that I don't want to Kinect.
8772352	8775454	I mean, I wanted to Kinect at first because I wanted to do Parapari games.
8776495	8779217	But it doesn't really mean anything to me anymore.
8779437	8779797	I don't care.
8780965	8781606	Ooh, what?
8805987	8809608	Well, I know you missed your Coke Black, but I'm going to try to ship this out to you.
8809869	8812510	Here in New York, they have what's called Manhattan Special.
8813030	8816531	It's cola and espresso as a soft drink.
8817352	8818372	I need this in my life.
8818932	8819572	So good.
8819933	8820893	I need this in my life.
8821073	8822013	Ranma, I'm going to let you go.
8822073	8822574	Take care, buddy.
8822594	8823674	All right, you too, bro.
8823734	8826335	All right, bye.
8826415	8826535	Bye.
8826555	8827256	1-877-GAME-OLR.
8827336	8830637	Our user's name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, but let's go to the phones.
8830657	8831537	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
8831557	8831937	Who's this?
8833138	8833938	Hey, it's Bobby.
8834118	8834719	Hey, Bobby.
8834759	8835299	How you doing?
8835319	8835659	Hi, Bobby.
8837080	8837781	Little shook up.
8838101	8838481	Yeah?
8838561	8839421	Okay, what happened?
8841302	8845964	I'm sitting there listening to OLR and I hear a huge, really loud clap over my head.
8847825	8854728	And all my lights flicker and I'm like, okay, that was close.
8855608	8859570	And then I notice that my brand new Netgear router is not on anymore.
8861290	8865472	And then I look over to my right and my brand new Netgear 8 port switch is not on anymore.
8866786	8870887	and then I go upstairs and my brand new Netgear A port switch that's upstairs is not on anymore.
8873128	8881671	And then I start looking around and I try, you know, assume the worst and I try to turn on my TV and my receiver.
8881711	8887132	The TV comes on but it's at the setup screen and my audio receiver doesn't come on at all.
8888173	8890293	The red light on my Wii U is no longer on.
8891574	8892934	The PS3's red light was on.
8894134	8895955	The 360 didn't turn on when I pressed it.
8897709	8906212	and I've come upstairs, my old 32-inch Trinitron TV for my retro games, that doesn't work anymore and the PS2 up here is dead.
8908273	8913975	Well, I guess the first question to ask, do you have homeowner's insurance or something that will hopefully replace some of this?
8915333	8916134	I absolutely do.
8916494	8919558	I haven't pulled it out to see if it covers this, but I'm sure it does.
8919838	8919918	Yeah.
8919958	8920058	Yeah.
8934073	8946958	And that just goes to show, Bobby, within literally two minutes of your tweet going up, everybody in the VOG Network chat room was like, let's take up a collection, let's donate, I've got an extra 360, I can send him if he needs it.
8948378	8949558	I think it goes a long way.
8949658	8959822	And I was mentioning to the live listeners, I know you didn't hear this because Lightning, it's one of the things you and I were talking about in the car when we were driving to Anaheim the other night was that
8960762	8965444	You know, we may not have the biggest audience here at the Voice of Geese Network, but we have the most loyal.
8965604	8967305	And we are so fucking thankful for that.
8967525	8968225	You guys are amazing.
8968325	8969486	Yeah.
8969886	8971307	But my computers are fine.
8971347	8972027	They stayed up.
8972047	8973227	My two monitors stayed up.
8973247	8974988	I even checked my old classic box.
8975028	8975968	It came right back up.
8976289	8980110	So it seems like it hits certain floors of your house more than others.
8980250	8982171	Because it's probably a circuit.
8983151	8983372	Yeah.
8984552	8985392	Yeah, well, I mean, it hit.
8985552	8989354	I mean, because the router, but my router is down next to my computer.
8990623	9012419	and so it hits some things everything's on surge protectors but this was a you know they don't protect every surge and this one must have been pretty direct and um but yeah it kind of hit different things like my GameCube still works and it's sitting right next to my PS2 well but that TV doesn't work too well anymore so I think something inside the TV got fried
9013584	9015185	Take some time to process.
9015765	9017406	Call the insurance company on Monday.
9017506	9019447	See what steps you have to take.
9020168	9023629	And if there's anything you need, you know you've got the three of us.
9023729	9027271	You've got 61 people in chat right now, and I know every single one of them is willing to help.
9027732	9031394	And then add on to that the podcast listeners, the other folks at VOGnetwork.com.
9032734	9033535	We'll get you through this.
9034835	9035035	Yeah.
9035316	9035976	It just sucks.
9036616	9036996	It sucks.
9037257	9039658	Yeah, I've spent a lot of money this past week.
9040640	9041861	Yeah, he did.
9042142	9042802	He did, folks.
9042862	9044264	Disneyland ain't cheap, you guys.
9044784	9047647	But, most important, you're okay.
9047967	9050529	The cats were still in kitty daycare due to your trip.
9050569	9053192	They don't open again until Monday, so your cats are okay and you're okay.
9054373	9054533	Yep.
9054853	9055494	Most important.
9055534	9056615	Everything else is just stuff.
9057816	9059858	And weren't we saying that Nintendo don't last?
9060118	9062521	I haven't checked all my classic consoles yet, so...
9063877	9065938	It's just stuff.
9066338	9068640	Well, I'm sure I've got spare Nintendos if you need one.
9068880	9069460	I know, I know.
9070401	9072142	Well, everybody's here willing to help, Bobby.
9073863	9075984	Otherwise, anything else you want to say?
9076064	9076985	Turning it over to you.
9077905	9078906	Open forum for you.
9079226	9080427	I don't want to rush you out of here.
9080467	9081788	If you have anything else you want to say.
9083008	9083509	Not really.
9084608	9086149	I just figured I'd fill people in.
9086509	9088090	Somebody send me a chat log.
9088530	9089831	We do appreciate the update.
9090831	9094453	I think mine logs, but if not, I'm sure somebody in chat will have you covered.
9095774	9096254	Okay, cool.
9096934	9097174	All right.
9097795	9098915	All right.
9098935	9100136	Keep us posted via Twitter.
9100636	9110001	I know a lot of folks here at VOG Network follow you on Twitter, twitter.com slash bobbyblackwolf, and will be a great way to get the updates on how it goes with the insurance company and all that throughout the week.
9111281	9111562	All right.
9112062	9112382	All right.
9112762	9113162	Bye, guys.
9113262	9113483	All right.
9113503	9113963	Take care, buddy.
9114003	9114263	Bye-bye.
9117826	9119208	I don't know what else to tell him right now.
9119768	9121830	I've been there.
9123372	9134464	Which is actually kind of funny because that same storm that I fried my roommate's hard drive in, one of my friends lost their Genesis, but their Super Nintendo worked.
9136487	9137588	And they were both on the same circuit.
9138702	9145185	I'm going to need a dick or a fart joke, please, to help cheer us up a little bit here and lighten the mood a little bit.
9145605	9146446	But let's try this call.
9146486	9147406	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9147426	9147806	Who's this?
9151008	9152929	Hi, this is Haseo Sumerugawa.
9153649	9153889	Hi.
9154009	9154509	Hello.
9154549	9155850	You said Haseo Sumerugawa?
9156490	9156690	Yep.
9156930	9157731	Hey, what's up?
9157791	9159492	I don't know if I've heard you call in before.
9159532	9160152	What's on your mind, buddy?
9161151	9163092	Actually, I've called him like two or three times.
9163932	9164632	Yeah, Rob.
9164892	9165513	I forgot.
9165573	9170294	Well, I don't remember a video call except I think I'm seeing a statue on your cam.
9170995	9177717	Actually, I chose that statue for a reason because the VOG Network has earned good karma and had the hero shift to hero.
9181596	9183677	It's the statue from Infamous 2.
9184617	9185497	Oh, okay.
9185558	9187278	It's a little dark in your room or something.
9187318	9188379	It's a little fuzzy coming through.
9188399	9189539	It's hard to make out, but I get it.
9189659	9190139	I get it now.
9190819	9191880	Crappy PlayStation Lite.
9193440	9194021	So what's up, buddy?
9195201	9201743	Actually, I was going to talk about the whole virtual E3 booth that Sony was doing this week or whatever.
9202044	9202484	Okay, yeah.
9202544	9204825	I didn't have a chance to really check that out.
9204845	9205365	Tell me about that.
9206265	9208446	It was actually pretty interesting because...
9209096	9218140	They boothed pretty much everything major that's coming out, like Infamous Second Son, Assassin's Creed 4, all that stuff.
9218380	9221541	And they had little quests and whatnot.
9222121	9227663	You could earn a free month of Music Unlimited, PlayStation Plus, all those lovely things.
9229744	9230725	That's pretty cool.
9230745	9233386	Yeah, I heard about the free month of PlayStation Plus on home.
9233426	9234106	That's pretty awesome.
9235512	9243538	The best thing actually about it was it told me about Tekken Revolution, even though Tekken Revolution kind of sucked.
9245319	9248161	Because it's one of those Facebook type-y games.
9248921	9252044	Oh yeah, that free-to-play Tekken game we were talking about last week.
9252104	9253545	I forgot, yeah, it was supposed to come out.
9253565	9254065	That's too bad.
9255666	9263371	Yeah, my boyfriend was playing it because, you know, he wanted to play a new game and I said, well, why don't you try Tekken?
9263391	9264132	He got, well,
9264973	9269777	4 or 5 fights into it and then it stopped so that's kind of sad
9282348	9284651	That's unfortunate.
9285652	9293361	So I'm assuming if you actually do all the stuff in PlayStation Home and all that, you've been a little bit of a Sony fanboy.
9294402	9297245	Or I shouldn't say the word fanboy because that has a negative connotation.
9297265	9299448	Actually, Sony fanboy is on my senior shirt.
9299688	9307071	I actually feel really good because mostly Sony got the rights to, you know, air Final Fantasy XIV, XV, which is actually Versus XIII.
9307091	9307231	Yeah.
9329068	9343642	and pretty much all the good stuff Square Enix is putting out and the last 25 minutes was pretty much Sony saying suck it Microsoft yeah it was pretty interesting so no hope on you getting an Xbox One
9344836	9345657	Absolutely not.
9346337	9349638	I have internet troubles and I do not.
9350199	9357742	Now, okay, since you said you're a Sony fanboy, I said earlier in the show, you know, I think Xbox's exclusives actually look a little better.
9357822	9363525	Even though I ended up ordering a PlayStation 4 because the overall picture I think is better for PlayStation 4.
9363805	9367287	And I'll get the Xbox One later when they sort out all their bullshit.
9367727	9368408	But I...
9371488	9374769	What I want to ask you is explain to me why I'm wrong.
9377409	9396614	Actually, I haven't really seen any exclusives for Xbox One that really kind of I'd say jump out at me as far as that goes, but I mean, the exclusives for PlayStation 4 are superior in a sense.
9398415	9399395	I mean, you know, you got
9401387	9404929	I can't really think of any right now.
9405570	9407571	Yeah, I'm not really convinced right now.
9408111	9409993	I'm just giving you a hard time.
9410273	9411333	I'm putting you on the spot.
9411393	9411954	It ain't easy.
9411994	9412494	It ain't easy.
9414235	9418598	Assuming you're buying a PlayStation 4 on day one, what are you most looking forward to?
9418698	9419899	The Square Enix games?
9421239	9429825	The Square Enix games and Infamous Second Son because, spoiler alert, the end of the second one is kind of
9430675	9434577	states why there's a whole new character and storyline and all that.
9435298	9435798	Fair enough.
9436338	9439360	Alright, well, anything else you want to get off your chest before we let you go?
9441281	9442582	Mirror's Edge 2 looks pretty.
9443062	9444363	Mirror's Edge 2 does look pretty.
9444403	9445423	I think we can agree on that.
9445784	9446924	Alright, thanks so much for the call, buddy.
9447905	9448525	Absolutely no problem.
9448605	9449146	Alright, take care.
9449546	9449946	Have a good one.
9451724	9454887	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9455488	9455928	What the heck?
9455948	9457170	We're getting call after call tonight.
9457190	9458251	Lots of people want to comment on E3.
9458311	9459492	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9459512	9459872	Who's this?
9462535	9463376	Hey, this is Actdeft.
9463616	9464177	Hey, Actdeft.
9464217	9464717	Hi, Actdeft.
9464917	9465458	How are you doing?
9466659	9467120	Pretty good.
9467480	9468061	What's on your mind, buddy?
9469059	9493679	Well, something that not many people are talking about Sony and Microsoft, that they're both doing, and that's pretty great in my opinion, is that you only need to buy one subscription to PlayStation Plus and to Xbox One to everyone in the console or in your house to enjoy it.
9495941	9511191	Oh, so meaning that like if one, you just have to have the one account and then you can have all the TVs in your house because I'm assuming they would all go back to the same IP at the end of the day, can all kind of use that central account to do Netflix and all that.
9512321	9521289	Yeah, it's something that I find pretty useful because in my household, me and my brother do have each one an Xbox.
9522130	9527354	So we do have like... I am the only one that has a gold account.
9527935	9534661	So in the future, if we decide either to get a PS4 or an Xbox One, in this case...
9536722	9542583	It's pretty good that we only need to buy one subscription to enjoy the gold or plus benefits.
9542883	9544504	Loki's wearing a question mark on his face right now.
9544524	9547904	I wasn't sure if it's just going to be on the console or not.
9547924	9555986	Because I know if I have live gold on one of my accounts, like an account on my 360, I can play multiplayer on that.
9556046	9559127	But if I have a second account that's not live gold...
9561127	9561647	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9581357	9582438	It's also tied to that console.
9582458	9593302	Same with how the PlayStation 3, well, PlayStation 3 was free online, but pretty much you can have as many of PlayStation Network accounts as you wanted, but I think they would kind of do it in a similar way.
9593402	9608308	I'm not sure if, I mean, I could be wrong because I haven't really read the details on it yet, but I don't think that they're having it where, like, I buy Xbox Live Gold or whatever and, you know, a sibling of mine has a separate console we can both play on live at the same time.
9608328	9609529	I don't think it works that way.
9610070	9615726	because otherwise, you know, what's to say if they're doing that 10 friend thing or whatever that I buy gold and then everybody else plays for free?
9615746	9617832	I mean, I just don't think they're going to do that.
9619130	9630632	Yeah, I do think it's also just one console, but it's still pretty good because even right now you have to buy a subscription for each account you have.
9631512	9647115	So with that, even if you cannot share it with another console, even in the same household, having just buying one subscription instead of two or even three in some cases, it's pretty good.
9647912	9648292	Let's get started.
9675769	9679410	How do these systems look from your perspective in Mexico?
9679530	9681330	Is Xbox One launching in Mexico?
9682611	9685871	Yeah, the Xbox One is launching in Mexico.
9686191	9692392	Don't know if it's launching in November, but it has a retail price.
9692533	9697674	They're already launching pre-orders, and it's around $8,500, which is around $600 or $700, I think.
9697694	9699374	Okay, and how's PlayStation 4 look?
9705889	9723276	and PlayStation 4 also it seems that they're launching in November I'm not sure at all but it looks like it though it's launching for 1000 pesos less which is 7500 pesos and dollars would be I think 500 around 550 and 600 dollars
9730299	9738442	So you're paying a premium similar to what our friends across the Atlantic pay, because in the European territories it's a little bit higher as well.
9741943	9747765	You've mentioned you've crossed into America before to sometimes buy things at a cheaper price with this stuff.
9747805	9749766	Is this something you're thinking about doing with the consoles?
9750526	9752487	No, because you want to be able to play the download stuff?
9752507	9752607	No.
9754150	9770282	Maybe I will because at least Microsoft, something that has done in the past, even with the 360, is that it has most of the digital content on par with the US.
9770943	9771823	At least most of it.
9772524	9782251	Though the Xbox One doesn't look as appealing as the PS4 right now because the Xbox TV stuff won't work here.
9782811	9783031	Right.
9783232	9788218	At least not at launch, and I don't think it will work even in the first year.
9788278	9793245	So that is a feature that won't be used here.
9793325	9798772	And so the console will probably mostly be used as a gaming console.
9799213	9800434	And it's way too expensive.
9801335	9804699	Though, on the other hand, a Wii U costs the same.
9805180	9809305	And if you're going to live in Mexico, you've got to be able to watch the telenovelas.
9809726	9812629	Because that, those are the bomb.
9812990	9814171	It's all about Lucha Libre.
9814191	9817656	Forget the drama, I like watching the wrestlers.
9817796	9819118	Well, it used to be all about Sabado...
9820479	9824780	and Sábado Gigante but that's gone now if I am not mistaken.
9824840	9826080	They finally pulled that.
9826780	9828721	So telenovelas.
9828761	9831261	They show some of them here and they're great.
9832522	9833542	I like watching the wrestlers.
9833662	9834962	They are absolutely fun.
9835042	9838723	I despise telenovelas so no comments.
9839183	9839443	All right.
9840203	9841864	Actdeft, thank you so much for the perspective.
9841884	9842564	We appreciate it.
9842664	9843384	Have a good one, okay?
9844164	9844444	You too.
9844504	9845205	Thanks for having me.
9845245	9845585	No problem.
9845605	9845925	Anytime.
9846045	9846225	Bye.
9847005	9847245	1-877-GAME-OLR
9864062	9864602	Hey, this is Techie.
9864642	9865042	Hey, what's up?
9865062	9865543	Hey, not much.
9865563	9866323	I just want to say to you
9891421	9894043	Say one thing and ask a question for DarkSakura.
9894344	9894424	Oh.
9894704	9896325	Okay.
9896345	9898547	Sony 1E3 and that's it for me.
9901730	9902991	That's it, huh?
9903071	9905493	There's nothing, no convincing you otherwise.
9905513	9906533	Sony 1E3, huh?
9907314	9913199	Like the way that Microsoft handled their DRM, they treat you like you're a criminal and that's, no.
9914160	9914800	There's no way.
9915461	9916882	They're alienating their audience.
9919209	9922871	What's your question for DarkSakura and then I'm going to throw you a curveball.
9924111	9930933	I saw the trailer for... He likes the trailer for... You just cut out.
9931774	9932934	The Joys of Live Radio.
9934595	9941117	I saw the trailer for Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn on the PS3.
9941457	9944478	What's the gameplay like since you're in the closed beta?
9945655	9950661	I'm not playing it on PS3, I'm playing it on PC, and it's pretty much standard, you know, Momo fare.
9951482	9959651	It's, uh, you know, what I like about the combat in the game is that you don't have to stop to loot, it will automatically auto-loot.
9960632	9961173	Um, you...
9961793	9975689	Actually get to choose... Well, they've sort of incorporated this in Mists of Pandaria lately, is actually getting items from doing quests that are for your class specifically, as opposed to getting just everybody's stuff.
9977310	9977811	I like...
9980293	9981834	The server that we're on is pretty crowded.
9981854	9983014	I'll go ahead and say that right now.
9983034	9983995	I don't like that so much.
9986976	9987776	It's really fun.
9987796	9988996	The game is smooth.
9989316	9994218	Even if you have a little bit of slowdown, it's not like a really horrible lag.
9994238	9996899	You don't find yourself being stuck anywhere, if that makes sense.
9998540	10001061	The whole fate system, I enjoy that.
10001101	10003962	Basically, you have these big group battles that give you extra experience.
10005263	10007825	There's really just a lot of positive to be said about it.
10007845	10018394	And on top of that, it looks like, you know, whereas even with the current graphical updates on World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy XIV looks like a new game.
10020475	10023318	It looks and plays like a new game.
10023338	10028202	The gameplay from it looks like, kind of looks like a, on par with Guild Wars 2 graphically.
10028715	10031237	Is it still like a grind fest like it is in Eleven in the beginning?
10031257	10031357	Okay.
10051622	10052203	I'm enjoying it.
10052463	10053223	I'm enjoying it a lot.
10054643	10063827	Actually, I hate being under NDA for saying stuff about the last beta, but the improvements that they're making are noticeable and very good.
10064147	10066128	It's going to be a really rich game when it boots.
10067148	10070809	I might try it out on my first MMO on the PS3.
10071649	10080672	I can't speak for how it plays on the PS3 because I play on a PC just because of the problems with my hands, but I enjoy it.
10081613	10082433	That's all I can say.
10082513	10082973	I like it.
10084234	10085314	Shane would vouch for it.
10086254	10086934	Yes, he will.
10087115	10091436	Shane would probably jump up and down on a trampoline saying how much he likes it, but you know.
10091690	10095812	Alright, here's the curveball I wanted to throw at you before you guys got on Final Fantasy XIV.
10095872	10104157	No, no, this is important because this is for a lot of people because everybody's turned E3 into Sony vs. Microsoft, Sony vs. Microsoft, da-da-da-da-da.
10104197	10105557	Where's Nintendo sit with you?
10105777	10106698	That's my curveball.
10106918	10108239	Where's Nintendo sit right now?
10108259	10109199	You know what?
10109219	10110060	Funny you should ask that.
10110240	10116103	I actually watched the Nintendo Direct the day of on that day that they streamed it.
10117664	10120045	And what my general...
10121131	10123919	A feeling for that is, 2014 is the year that we, for me,
10127685	10134890	So in other words, it's kind of one of my earlier tweets I'd put out there was like, boy, Nintendo's sure setting up a great season for 2014.
10135250	10136171	Too bad about this year.
10137051	10141334	Yeah, it's like there's nothing really that catches my eye this year at all.
10141554	10142535	There's the Mario game.
10142655	10144576	The Mario 3D game looks great.
10144836	10149019	But I mean, the Donkey Kong game, again, Donkey Kong's a solid platformer.
10149059	10151741	But I think that's the problem.
10151761	10154583	You've got two platformers with Mario and Donkey Kong.
10155043	10160005	I kind of wish they'd gone a different direction, but they could have done a lot worse.
10162627	10165628	I guess there's nothing hardcore for me to play.
10165668	10167069	That's what I like playing.
10168650	10170891	Platform Wars are part of the games.
10171671	10172031	Alright, buddy.
10172051	10173772	I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show.
10173812	10174773	Do you have any other final thoughts?
10176491	10177111	No, that's it.
10177871	10178152	Thank you.
10178212	10178632	Have a good one.
10179232	10179572	You too.
10179992	10180292	Bye-bye.
10200316	10207724	They have some new co-hosts, but maybe they just stopped carrying it here locally or something.
10207784	10208725	But that would seem weird.
10208765	10212348	I would think a show that's as old as that, it wouldn't stop.
10213389	10215632	I guess I'm just not watching enough Mexican TV.
10215732	10218455	But for what it's worth, I don't watch enough American TV either.
10218575	10220517	So at least that's equal.
10221017	10222799	All right, well, there's your very important update.
10222819	10223620	Thank you to the chatters.
10223960	10226482	Alright, that's it for the Sky Blind tonight.
10226882	10229904	I gotta get to some of these tweets we were getting because we were getting some good tweets.
10231265	10234487	And Loki, I always like to put a call out for last minute stories if you have anything.
10235928	10237169	Yeah, real quick.
10238750	10242652	I was gonna mention that, well, it's kind of funny.
10243773	10249397	We talk about porn a lot on this show and one of the things that they're looking to bring to the Oculus Rift is
10250765	10252847	Horn.
10253687	10258751	And it's actually being done by this startup studio.
10259192	10261073	The game's called Wicked Paradise.
10262114	10270500	And they're getting funding for it right now, but they're trying to make, I guess, a game that will get people horny.
10271421	10272342	Genuinely horny.
10274083	10274444	Wow.
10275404	10277566	Yeah, so they've got information on that.
10278206	10279708	So I thought that was kind of funny.
10282458	10291912	I forgot to mention in the releases this week, a new Luigi U is going to be on the eShop this week.
10292052	10295678	Yeah, when I heard about that, I was like, oh yeah, that is like real soon.
10298108	10298468	Pretty neat.
10299148	10300549	Let me get to some of the tweets here real quick.
10301969	10307370	SSJ100Matt tweeted us about comedian Louis Black talking about Xbox One and Google Glass on the Daily Show.
10307970	10309491	I have seen that YouTube floating around.
10309791	10311831	Because I was out of town, I haven't watched it yet.
10312771	10316132	DarkSakura, some folks saying it should be maybe a fortune cookie in a future week.
10316632	10318892	Because I know you do like Louis Black, so check that out.
10319093	10320353	Yeah, I love Louis Black.
10320393	10321093	Look at the tweets there.
10322013	10333496	Uh, let's see, we got a tweet here from Ionotropic, who, uh, notices that Storm is heading his way, the one that got Bobby, so, uh, stay safe, um, um, unplug stuff, if you want.
10334136	10339797	Um, let's see, Dartetsuya says, uh, Bomani may be dead in the States, but it lives on in Japan.
10340197	10341318	Beatmania2DX21's Spada says,
10343218	10344559	is on location test.
10344599	10345879	And they said they weren't doing any more.
10346139	10350621	Please tell me that somebody is saying, this is Spada.
10351681	10352682	Please tell me that's a joke.
10353422	10353762	Somebody?
10354602	10354843	All right.
10355443	10355763	Fair enough.
10356563	10357063	Let's see.
10357384	10360865	Actdeft tweeting us that Pac-Man CEDX is coming to Steam.
10361865	10362566	I did not know.
10362626	10363246	That's kind of cool.
10363266	10364786	I think that would be a fun game to play on PC.
10365827	10366967	Is that part of that PC?
10367007	10368188	No, I guess it's a separate thing.
10369388	10374330	Um, Tigerclaw tweeting us, Sega launching a new Sonic the Hedgehog series titled Sonic Boom.
10375290	10378652	It's by the creators of My Little Pony Friendship is Magic.
10378872	10379532	Oh, God.
10380452	10381033	Oh, man.
10381093	10381953	Don't care anymore.
10382053	10383433	That's some fandom stuff.
10383453	10384594	You gotta give it at least a chance.
10384614	10386695	You gotta try at least one episode, DarkSakura.
10387175	10388435	You gotta try it before you know it.
10388475	10388595	I did.
10388635	10389336	It was stupid.
10389396	10390876	No, I'm not talking about My Little Pony.
10390916	10392197	I'm talking about Sonic Boom.
10392457	10392937	Oh, maybe.
10395145	10396246	Are we sure that's legit?
10396506	10397246	Are we sure that's legit?
10397266	10398987	Because that does sound a little bit fan wanky.
10399027	10399587	I'm just saying.
10400107	10400607	I'm just saying.
10400687	10402308	All right.
10403929	10409631	And lastly, Rama tweeting us a story about a Tekken producer, Katsuhiro Harada, missing.
10410391	10416398	But actually, I think this was on our show roll last week, but got bumped because of all the Microsoft news that was happening.
10416778	10422945	I want to say there was a late-breaking update that he kind of just ran away for a little bit, but he's fine.
10423065	10423465	He's safe.
10423605	10423966	Don't worry.
10424246	10425127	He's okay.
10425147	10425888	What about the other dude?
10427149	10427590	Which one?
10427850	10428951	The guy that was...
10433113	10434373	We haven't heard an update on him.
10434533	10435154	I don't think.
10435394	10436454	Thank you for asking.
10439495	10440195	I'm going to look.
10440435	10442956	I don't know.
10444096	10444596	I haven't heard.
10444616	10447357	That's too bad.
10450418	10457140	I'm actually trying to find real quick where that Facebook is that might have an update.
10458724	10461406	Live radio guys, while I try to find this.
10464309	10465209	Trying to see if there's anything.
10465229	10466691	We're talking about Mexican wrestling now.
10467591	10467731	Really?
10467751	10468352	What the hell?
10469052	10469413	There it is.
10473185	10485993	Uh, unfortunately I'm looking at, and the website is, if you want more information on this, findknuckles.com and, uh, they say that they're still out searching as often as they can when weather permits over the past week.
10486313	10487774	They went out to Bowen Island.
10487814	10490036	These are some places around Vancouver and so forth.
10490076	10492557	So unfortunately it sounds like he's still missing.
10492617	10495639	So guys, um, especially if you're in the Pacific Northwest, uh,
10495979	10518790	and that goes double if you're in the Vancouver area please check out findknuckles.com it's going to redirect you to a Facebook page but I'm just trying to get the latest on that so boy oh boy all right let me see if I have any other tweet stories here I don't think so
10520965	10527071	I'm getting told to take Sonic Boom with a grain of salt.
10528332	10530914	Stay tuned for Anime Jam Session for all the latest on that.
10530974	10533056	They'll tell you what is going on there.
10534177	10535759	People are welcome to like what they like.
10536259	10536680	That's right.
10537668	10538529	I don't have to like it.
10539891	10541113	I got sent this story here.
10541574	10545680	Microsoft looking into playing games offline on Xbox One.
10546221	10547363	Oh, sure they are.
10547883	10553452	That was the one that, if I remember correctly, this is the one that's from the NeoGAF thing where someone had proposed
10553672	10560858	Hey, you can have it so that it's optional so that, you know... Oh, the Major Nelson thing where he tweeted or whatever saying, yes, we could do that.
10561539	10562139	It's possible.
10562219	10563521	I think that's what this is.
10563741	10566123	Here's the thing with this story.
10566183	10568445	There's going to be a lot of discussions after E3.
10568565	10569686	You know, Microsoft...
10571536	10572257	and DarkSakura.
10594938	10614355	that's the huge difference you heard in their press conferences was that you know when Jack Trenton was there stabbing Microsoft in the jugular he said we know that gamers like it just the way they are when you hear what Microsoft is saying no gamers want something different so in their mind whether they're right or wrong they're doing the right thing here um
10615797	10643312	so a lot can change I kind of think it's too late to reverse course and backpedal for this holiday season and I think they're going to pay for it but you never know a lot can happen we'll see what happens but I think it goes without saying anything is possible but don't expect anything next week because there's going to be a lot of board meetings and a lot of conferences that happen and a lot of consulting that happens over the next and focus groups I would say you're not going to hear anything for about three months
10644252	10647894	Although they need to get something out a lot sooner if they want to get more pre-orders for the holiday season.
10647934	10653577	But technically, they could do it right up until the day it's out and still sell a lot of them.
10654638	10654998	We'll see.
10655958	10656618	Anything's possible.
10657359	10657579	Okay.
10661721	10665203	I'm just looking at stuff in the chat at live.vognetwork.com.
10665223	10666704	The chat room is all over the place.
10666744	10667984	Yeah, all over the place.
10668745	10670746	Akuma JP says, an Apple-like device.
10671126	10673107	Xbox One looks like my grandpa's VCR.
10674335	10675596	Betamax!
10675676	10679497	Shadow Next Gen says Microsoft could do something at PAX Prime since it's in their backyard.
10679817	10683659	You know, Bobby and I were talking about that a little bit in the car, or at Disneyland, one of the two.
10683679	10685640	We had some time together talking about all this stuff.
10686080	10689641	And yeah, actually that was brought up that...
10691562	10698649	PAX Prime would be a very good place to make your case directly to the gamers that you seem to have ruffled feathers with.
10699109	10700931	It's going to be a very interesting PAX Prime.
10701532	10703293	Too bad we're all going to DragonCon.
10703854	10711722	We'll be following everything on Twitter and news and all that stuff as it goes on.
10712242	10730760	Alright, that's it We're about to the end of the show It's been a very, very busy night tonight So I think it's about time we wrap up and take it back to the other shows here at the Voice Geeks Network and our big 11th birthday show next week Any other last minute stories before we get to that?
10731680	10731941	Nope
10733021	10734022	Alright.
10734302	10735143	There's a small thing.
10736203	10746409	There's some people being suspended from I guess esports or whatever for some Dota 2 match fixing.
10746489	10750811	I guess it's allegedly that one team I guess bet against themselves and threw the match.
10752692	10753112	Apparently.
10753953	10754693	And now they're banned.
10756574	10756934	Some people.
10757895	10759035	All for about like a $100 bet.
10759055	10759156	Well...
10762267	10762907	Cheatin's cheatin'.
10763528	10763808	All right.
10765049	10767190	That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

10801309	10810352	and we thank you guys for your support and especially with all the bullshit that's going on with Bobby's house getting hit by lightning right now which really sucks.
10810892	10820234	The way you guys are really banding together in chat just really shows why this network is an amazing place and I'm really happy to have you all as a part of it going into next week's birthday show.
10820274	10822175	I think that's a great thing to keep in mind.
10822816	10832312	we will be back to do it all again next week with our 11th birthday JV Mon will be here in the house on the east coast representing New York City peeps I really need to get back to New York City
10833103	10833543	I wanna go.
10834323	10834563	I know.
10834583	10836664	I haven't been since I was a senior in high school.
10836824	10837884	I haven't been in a while either.
10838245	10841586	But anyway, let's go around and get everybody's final thought before we wrap up tonight.
10843006	10850428	My final thought tonight is I need to download and play Marvel Heroes this week because I keep hearing about it and I keep forgetting to play it.
10850488	10851469	So I will play it this week.
10852649	10854710	Yes, I know DarkSakura, but I want to give it a try for myself.
10855891	10856931	Loki, your final thoughts tonight.
10857232	10870379	Hopefully my, I've got these, what is it, Ethernet over power adapters that I'm getting so that I can hook up my PlayStation 3 to the front room TV instead of having to have to drag a 50 foot TV.
10871385	10876966	Ethernet cable into that room because remember, I have a launched 20 gig system that doesn't have Wi-Fi.
10877706	10878787	Yeah.
10878887	10881227	So hopefully that'll come soon so I can do that.
10881547	10884248	And I need to download and install and play Final Fantasy 14.
10885828	10889349	Lastly, and certainly not leastly, DarkSakura, your final thought tonight.
10889589	10890529	I've got a sore throat.
10891409	10891850	Aw.
10891890	10896151	It started during the mailbag and I will try not to breathe on anybody just in case.
10896251	10898111	You need another cup of coffee or a lozenge.
10899266	10900246	I'd like a lozenge.
10900486	10900887	Or both.
10901147	10901987	Sadly, I don't have any.
10902027	10904368	But I could totally do Jewish Mother Voice now.
10905168	10905408	All right.
10906148	10906569	That does it.

10986711	10987532	I wasn't ready for you.

11004204	11007485	It wasn't a super funny show, but I felt the discussion was good.
11007745	11008125	It was.
11008265	11009666	It can't always be dick and fart jokes.
11009686	11010446	We had a lot happen.

11013187	11017589	All right, let's get to the fortune cookie message of the day, guys, and then we'll be back to wrap it all up.
11019689	11023951	There's this idea that people are meaner than they used to be because the internet, you know, that people are meaner.
11023971	11024491	They're not meaner.
