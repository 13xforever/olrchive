Orange Lounge Radio

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The region hosts DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Tonight, June 30th, 2013, Microsoft reportedly drops Xbox Live patching fees,

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
the Dave & Buster's chain is searching for the next big game,

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and Nintendo fans start a petition to end region locking on the Wii U.

Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 510, June the 30th of 2013.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
My name is Rob Roberts and I am here to talk with you guys about video games

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and gaming culture and gaming LOLs and gaming WTFs

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
with my co-host joining me as she has faithfully for the past 11 years.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Are you still sick 11 years later?

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Hey, you know what, it's funny, my voice is getting a little bit better,

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
but I still have the cough, so.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Aww.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Ricola!

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm living on a steady diet of Ricola, but you know what?

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I've gone down a size.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Congratulations, I guess.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Thanks to my diet of Ricola.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
That's not really the way you're supposed to do it, but you-

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Well, that and fruit.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You look for the silver lining.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What are you, an Animal Crossing villager?

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yes, I live on pears.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Alright.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Pears and rainbow trout.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Also say hello to a man that lives on round table breadsticks.

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Say hello to Loki.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Just today.

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Just today.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
How are you doing, Loki?

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm doing alright.

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So, for those that-

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Loki has a bubonic plague.

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yeah, it's a good thing it's not a video show because if you guys could see Loki,

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
he's got like chicken pox on his hands or something.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yeah, it's not really chicken pox.

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I mean, I don't know what chicken pox looks like because I've never had it,

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
but it's an extreme- well, it's not extremely rare, but it's rare.

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's hand, foot, and mouth disease.

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Usually something that, you know-

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Is that where you keep putting your foot in your mouth?

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Because you do that a lot on this show.

47
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
No, no.

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Hand, foot, and mouth disease is like this virus that you get that starts off with a fever.

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So, I had like 102 fever for like a whole 24 hour period.

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
That would not go down no matter what kind of medication I took.

51
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And then you break out in a rash on your hands, your feet, and usually your mouth.

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It could be- like, for me, it was on my face.

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Not so much in my mouth, thank goodness.

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
A little bit at the back of my throat.

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And then like one tip of my tongue, which I always get like a weird thing from like acidic food sometimes.

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Gross.

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
But yeah, basically they act like blisters.

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So, my hands look like they're all spotted in red and there's some that actually look like blisters.

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And they were hurting quite a bit more earlier in the week.

60
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Like, I couldn't really pick up things without hurting, you know.

61
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But actually today's not bad. I don't feel anything.

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So, you're getting better.

63
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm getting better, yes.

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Please don't be contagious.

65
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
No, I shouldn't be contagious.

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The listers do not want to catch foot and mouth disease or whatever it is you have.

67
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
No, it's only contagious.

68
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Like, it's mainly like, you know, if you're dealing with your children or something like that.

69
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You can catch it from, you know, changing their diapers or something like that.

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You can catch it from food.

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
She had baby butt disease.

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
If you share, like, I was sharing food.

73
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Like, see, you probably wouldn't catch it if you ate some of this stuff.

74
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Because, like, I was actually eating the same fork and, you know.

75
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I wouldn't touch those breadsticks.

76
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
In fact, that whole area is getting Lysol'd as soon as you leave.

77
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
That's fine.

78
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I wouldn't expect you to do anything different any other day.

79
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
We could set up a quarantine.

80
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I think we've got some canvas somewhere.

81
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Should we drape a plastic sheet over Loki?

82
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
God, no, it'll be even hotter than it is.

83
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You'll be the Loki in the plastic bubble.

84
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
No, but other than that, you know, I've been just staying at home.

85
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Just doing a lot of watching of instructional videos for, you know, Unity stuff.

86
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Your programming stuff is moving on.

87
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yeah, I finished, well, I don't know if you'd call it finished.

88
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I finished slash quit my C++ thing because I was just like,

89
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
listen, I don't really care about all this stuff that they're talking about.

90
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
When you work with Unity and stuff, it doesn't really apply.

91
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Like, you know, some of the very low-level things they're teaching you in C++.

92
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And sure, I'll go back to it someday.

93
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
But for right now, I just wanted a basic understanding of programming languages.

94
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And that's what I got.

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And now when they're showing Unity stuff, I can understand what they're doing.

96
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm not like, what? What's he mean by that?

97
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Well, I look forward to seeing whatever project,

98
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
especially the one you were telling me about before the show.

99
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Sounds very ambitious.

100
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's like an OLR dream game in the future.

101
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's Peter Molyneaux crap.

102
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Can you imagine if Peter Molyneaux had Loki's ideas?

103
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Because this is where we're headed now, is that Loki's learning programming.

104
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Loki's going to come up with these games. It's going to be crazy.

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So, a couple quick things and then we'll get to our guests.

106
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Because you have a guest here in the studio.

107
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
First off, I know much of the country is under a heatwave right now.

108
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
But it is hotter than Satan's taint here in Sacramento right now.

109
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And just as sweaty. It's humid.

110
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And we bitch here in Sacramento about the humidity when it's above zero.

111
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
This is not humid.

112
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
No, I know. It's not East Coast humid. I know that.

113
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But it's bad for West Coast. It's bad.

114
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
That was one thing I was going to say.

115
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And then I think I was going to say something gaming related.

116
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
But I forgot because I was thinking about how fucking hot it was.

117
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So, I guess with that, speaking of Satan's taint, let's go introduce our guest.

118
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
No, I'm kidding.

119
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Say hello everybody. Joining us live in studio tonight.

120
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
A good friend of mine. We go way back years and years.

121
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And he hosts another show that you all should be listening to.

122
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's First Mate Slidekick from the GameBui.org podcast.

123
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Ahoy.

124
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
How you doing?

125
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Pretty well aside from the roasting like a chicken part.

126
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Like a pig at a luau.

127
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Yeah, it's pretty bad here in Sacramento right now.

128
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You're visiting us for the weekend from where do you live usually?

129
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The Bay Area.

130
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Yeah.

131
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Just the big nebula of the Bay.

132
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yes.

133
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Awesome. Well, welcome.

134
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So, Spike, your co-host at GameBui.org was here about, I think it was about, actually it was about two months ago at this point.

135
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yeah.

136
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So, assuming we picked up any new listeners between now and then, tell us a little bit about GameBui.org.

137
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What's your show all about?

138
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Well, we're your port of call for gaming news and views that maybe aren't on your radar, but definitely should be.

139
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What we kind of focus on are left of center news and genres that you might not hear on your typical gaming podcast.

140
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So, we talk about JRPGs a lot.

141
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
We talk about different issues in gaming like gay issues and that sort of thing.

142
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So, you try to talk about stuff before it's cool.

143
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So, it's like a hipster podcast.

144
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Not really, but we think it's important for people who are interested in this type of content and these sorts of games to have a place to go to hear the news.

145
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Because we find all this stuff on all the big news sites, but with all the big news that happens, it sometimes gets lost.

146
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yeah, sure.

147
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
All this fuckery about the Xbox One.

148
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:21,000
That whole talk dominated E3 and I'm sure there's lots of great, and I use my quotey fingers, Kensha Hall games in memory of the hall that used to be there.

149
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:32,000
They kind of fall off the radar because everybody's too preoccupied with all this crap about Xbox versus Sony and Nintendo out of left field and all that.

150
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Right, yeah. I mean, we talk about Xbox One and some of the bigger stuff too, but we just try to keep our fingers on the pulse of the stuff that you might not hear a lot about.

151
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So, hopefully we can succeed with that.

152
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And where can folks hear your show?

153
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:55,000
We're over at gamebuoy.org and you can get all of our episodes there and also links to all our social networks.

154
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So, hopefully some of you OLR peeps will come and listen to us and say hi.

155
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So, it's like Game Boy, but you have a U before the L, like a buoy.

156
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
A buoy, like a boat buoy.

157
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Hence why you're pirates and first mates and all that.

158
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
We're pirates, yeah.

159
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Sorry, the listeners are complaining that you're too quiet.

160
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Wow, that's a first.

161
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I know. Actually, no.

162
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Well, especially since back when we were raiding, I'd have to turn you way down.

163
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
That's true.

164
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And then I'd have to turn Rob even further down because Rob would be like,

165
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Okay, everybody on the main tank, move. Tank, move.

166
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I like to yell at people when I play, wow, I can't help it.

167
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's just the way I am.

168
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So, you got some fans in the chatty room over at live.volganetwork.com because this show,

169
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
you know, the one that does all the mainstream stuff here where every gamer has a voice.

170
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
We read along with you guys in the chat room. You guys can participate.

171
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Live.vognetwork.com, Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern,

172
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

173
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Although, sadly, he was not live tonight due to a last-minute technical glitch.

174
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Those things happen, but poor Bobby's had a string of bad luck lately with the lightning and everything else.

175
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So, our thoughts go out to him for like a good week.

176
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Somebody needs to take Bobby Black Wolf on a cruise, y'all.

177
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Somebody needs to put him on a cruise.

178
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You know, he likes cruises. He's a cruiser guy.

179
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
That's not good luck at all. Come on.

180
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Oh, yeah. With everything that happened with the carnival and everything.

181
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Stay away from cruises.

182
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
He'll end up on the poop cruise. We don't want that.

183
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Somebody needs to get him on a good cruise.

184
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
No, we just need to win the lottery, go to Georgia, and give him a big hug.

185
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Alright. Let's see.

186
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Going into our chat room at live.vognetwork.com,

187
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Osfer says, I've been recently listening to Game Buoy. Happy face.

188
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Aw, thanks, Osfer.

189
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And Clerical Error 404 says, Game Buoy is great.

190
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Aw, lots of love. Thank you.

191
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
He has to say that, though, because we're doing the stuff with Koopa Club and Game Bar and Gamer X.

192
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:00,000
No, I'm kidding. What a great bunch of guys all around the internet doing those podcasts. Good stuff.

193
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Clerical Error 404 also suggests a cruise to Alaska.

194
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Hi.

195
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And Code Man says, I love Bobby. We all love Bobby here at the Voice Geese Network.

196
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
That's why we get pissed when all this bad shit keeps happening to him.

197
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
How about an open letter to bad shit?

198
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Knock it off.

199
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Stop it. Not love, O-L-R.

200
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yeah.

201
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I thought of the other announcement I wanted to make real quick, and then I'll get back to John, or excuse me, First Mate Slidekick.

202
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Ooh, I just said your real name.

203
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Ooh.

204
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And then we'll move on with the show.

205
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Last week, some of y'all were listening live, and we were having some really bad cutout problems.

206
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
The stream kept dropping every 15 seconds.

207
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Now, originally we blamed that on our service provider, but the blame may have been misplaced.

208
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It turns out it was a router that we were using here in the house, which sucks because we just replaced a router a year ago.

209
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
But now the other one died.

210
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
We have a bridge router that we use in the living room here that moves it from the studio.

211
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So now the show is plugged in directly into the studio router.

212
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'll try to save you the full networking spiel.

213
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
But the last half of last week's show streamed fine.

214
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So I'm sorry to the live audience that was getting really frustrated last week.

215
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Hopefully that will be the end of it.

216
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
If anything screws up now, it's this 108 degree weather fuckery's fault.

217
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
No, it's Comcast. It's always Comcast.

218
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's always Comcast, exactly.

219
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You know, anytime there's extreme weather changes, Comcast has a big fart, and the sticky bits get left on the customer.

220
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Ew.

221
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Exactly. That's what everybody says when it happens. It's horrible.

222
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Anyhow, back to First Mate Slidekicks, since I'm supposed to be talking to you.

223
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
What are some of the topics you've talked about on Game Buoy lately?

224
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:50,000
One thing I kind of like about your show is that since you do a central topic, you pick a lot of stuff that's not necessarily tied into the news.

225
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Like your April Fool's show was all about tingle, right?

226
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Yes, it was our tinglecast.

227
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And you did another show about, I know you did an LGBT show. What was your most recent one?

228
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:11,000
The most recent one we did was, like the recent full episode was our E3 Blowout, which is a yearly theme now, second year.

229
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Actually, a new thing that we've done on the site is introduce Game Buoy Micro, which are little tiny podcasts.

230
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And by tiny, I mean like a half hour because our podcasts tend to run longer these days.

231
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Hey, boy, you know you're on a three hour show tonight, right?

232
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Maybe that's why we're getting so long on Game Buoy. We were just trying to be like, O-L-R.

233
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Oh, stop. Well, you guys are always really supportive of the other indie shows, and I think that's great.

234
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
That's something I've always really tried to champion is that, you know, support each other.

235
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Don't cut each other down because nobody wins in that situation.

236
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So you guys are always really great about pimping stuff at the end of your show.

237
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Since you did, I know one of the Micros you did because I actually listened to it.

238
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You guys went and saw the Best Buy Nintendo E3 Blowout.

239
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Yeah, we actually took some YouTube video as well.

240
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
How was that? Not to steal the thunder of your show, but give us the Cliff Notes version. How was it?

241
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You know, it was kind of cool. You know, I feel like any time you go to a Nintendo event,

242
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
whether it's just camping out for a Wii or, you know, going to something like this,

243
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
that Nintendo crowds are usually pretty cool.

244
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It was a really long wait, but to Nintendo's credit, they didn't cut it off right at, like, six or whatever.

245
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
How long was long?

246
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
We were in line for about five and a half hours. You know, we got to play one game, but I mean, for me it was worth it.

247
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Just like the real E3.

248
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Yeah, pretty much. Authentic experience.

249
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
That's what they were actually saying. The Nintendo representatives there were saying it's an authentic E3 experience,

250
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
but they give us pizza. P-I-Z-Z-A.

251
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Did they give you whipped cream pouring like waterfalls?

252
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
No, they didn't. Unfortunately.

253
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Cheap, cheap bastards.

254
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
But yeah, I thought it was really cool that they put it on and that they were so cooperative in that.

255
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Best Buy, to their credit, was really cooperative, too.

256
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
They could have just been like, nope, it's five. Everyone who hasn't played yet doesn't get to play,

257
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:10,000
but they tried to get everyone to play what they wanted and they had little Mario Kart 8 flags to give you

258
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
just for waiting in lines. I mean, it was really cool.

259
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I still think the best way, you know, approach to E3 was like Xbox.

260
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Oh my god, Xbox. Yeah, 2005 or 2006, when they did that, were bringing E3 home and they had demos for games.

261
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Same demos that were out there. I'm like, why don't they do that?

262
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I don't understand why they can't do that now. I mean, I know a lot of that doesn't run on final hardware and stuff.

263
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I think the reason why they don't is there's too many people that make their final judgement of the game based off the E3 demo

264
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
and it's too risky in that regard. I honestly think that's a big part of it.

265
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Like, you know, E3 builds are usually really early on in the development and there's too many people that make their decision like,

266
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
oh, this game sucks based off the demo. Like, you know, demos carry a lot of weight.

267
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Yeah, but these people, though, are the same dumb people that will buy a game based off of a review score from one outlet.

268
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
So, I mean, they're very fickle anyways, so I don't know why we should punish every-

269
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Considering that, you know, it's gonna get a good review and they're like, well, I guess I'll buy it.

270
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Oh, okay. You know, cause, you know, YGIN liked it or something.

271
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Um, quickly, also about the Nintendo experience. What did you play? You got your hands on with, you didn't-

272
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Spike did Mario Kart 8, you did the Mario-

273
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I did Mario 3D World, yeah.

274
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
The Mario 3D fused with Super Mario 2 game.

275
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Yeah, cats. Super Mario cats, that's why you need to know.

276
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Super Mario cats, yeah. It was cool, I mean, it was kind of chaotic and I've actually, I think it was over on US Gamer, which is Jeremy Parrish's new outlet.

277
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:50,000
They were describing it as chaotic too, but I mean, like in a good way, so it was fun, you know.

278
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Mario Party's chaotic if you play with me. Mario Party's always chaotic.

279
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Everything is chaotic if they play with you, Rob.

280
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Shut up!

281
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Hey, I've been here 11 years, I have the right to say whatever I want to, so nah.

282
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
But did you have fun?

283
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I did, I did.

284
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Did you make your judgment on the entire game based off that demo?

285
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You know, I mean, I kind of made my judgment on that game based on the Nintendo Direct, honestly, so, I mean-

286
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You're like, it's Mario and Princess Floats, I'm in.

287
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Pretty much, you know, I'm a shameless Nintendo fanboy, but you know, it was good to get a chance to play it and to be able to speak to that.

288
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:37,000
And you know, just being able to see the games that I didn't play, like watching Captain Spike play Mario Kart 8 and Wind Waker HD.

289
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Towards the end, people were starting to just get really, like, annoyed when people were like,

290
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Oh, I want to play Wind Waker HD, because it's actually, what they did is they redid the original GameCube demo.

291
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,000
So you could either do the bird battle, boss battle, or run around Windfall Village.

292
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And, you know, which is cool, but I mean, compared to doing two races on Mario Kart or two levels in 3D World, you know, it was just a little too long.

293
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:14,000
So, it looked gorgeous though, and Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze looked good, so, you know, it was cool to actually get a chance to see it.

294
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
You know, not just based on an E3 video, so.

295
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Okay. It was worth it.

296
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Going to the chat room for some comments at live.vognetwork.com.

297
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Shadownextgen says, Gamers rush to decisions. A lot of them don't understand the concept of an alpha or beta build that will be buggy.

298
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Yeah, there's a lot of people playing the Final Fantasy XIV online beta right now that are, you know, basically like, Oh, this is just a game trial, right?

299
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And not really. There's a lot still missing.

300
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
We've already seen big changes from the last build to this one.

301
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Oh, God, yes.

302
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Ospfer says, I also did Mario 3D World at the Nintendo E3 experience. It was pretty fun playing the cat form. The dive mechanic is really awesomely integrated in some of the levels.

303
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Yeah, I agree.

304
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Very cool.

305
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Okay, well, taking a step back and just kind of getting to know you as a gamer a little bit before we get into tonight's news.

306
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I always ask the guests this. What's your favorite video game of all time?

307
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
That's always a really tough question to answer.

308
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You can name a couple if you have to. One of your favorite video games.

309
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:20,000
You know, I have to say, if I'm going to just pick one favorite, it would probably be the original Legend of Zelda for NES.

310
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Just because I grew up with that game, I know it inside and out. And that's the game that I can just put on the virtual console or whatever and play through in a weekend.

311
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:38,000
And I just know where everything is. I mean, not that familiarity, over familiarity is always good, but you know, it just it always feels like going home again.

312
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
What do you love about video games?

313
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I don't know. You know, I just I like exploring worlds. I like being another character. I just kind of get lost in it. And that's I guess that's always appealed to me. I've always been a nerdy kid.

314
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:00,000
All right. I can identify with that. One other thing and then I'll move on. What possessed you to want to do a podcast?

315
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You know, I've known Captain Spike for actually longer than I've known you. So yes, you have.

316
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You guys have been besties for a long time.

317
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Yeah, we we were just always talking about games and we just thought, you know, why not give it a try? We were inspired by y'all here at OLR.

318
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:24,000
So we just thought we'd give it a go. And we've been going for over a year at this point. So that's a great compliment, though.

319
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,000
So thank you. Like any time anybody says like, oh, I mean, you guys did it. So that helped me learn that like I could do it, too.

320
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I'm always like that's that's like actually like a great compliment. So thank you. Of course. You guys rock. So you guys rock.

321
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:45,000
No, you know, you love fast here at OLR. All right. Not in this heat. Anything else you want to plug in?

322
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Any other shows? Twitter, things like that you want to plug?

323
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You know, they can find all of our social links on our website, game buoy dot org.

324
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I guess I just would like to shout out to gamer X convention in San Francisco.

325
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:10,000
You know, it's for gamers of all genders and that sort of thing. You don't have to be gay to enjoy gamer.

326
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:19,000
That's true. And Rob and I and Captain Spike and our friends from Game Bar and Koopa Club are going to be doing a podcasting panels there.

327
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:30,000
So if you happen to be heading out there or you didn't really know about it and you think that sounds like a cool thing, you should go over to gamer connect dot org dot com.

328
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Oh, I feel bad. I think the ticket pre-sale is going to be done real soon. Yeah. In a couple of weeks. And then the ticket price goes up at the door.

329
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
If you're in Northern California, really, California at all. You should come with us.

330
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
If I drive to Disneyland five times a year, ULA people can come up here for a weekend. The thing is, it's right in Japan town.

331
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,000
So even if you're like not super into the convention experience, but you kind of want to go, you know, just come hang with us.

332
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Go to Japan town. San Francisco. There is plenty to do everywhere. And it's like always 68 degrees.

333
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:08,000
So I can escape this horrible heat wave. So I don't know about today, though, because, you know, today was the big doesn't matter.

334
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:17,000
It's cooler than actually 25 degrees cooler. I think it's been in the 70s. Oh, no. The 70s. Oh, my goodness. All right.

335
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
OK. Well, thank you. And of course, please continue commenting on tonight's news. Like, certainly here.

336
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
For the record, it's 68 degrees in San Francisco right now. Wow. For the all you and us.

337
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Oh, but tomorrow it'll be 80 for all of you.

338
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Let's go, grandpa, if you're listening. Kiss my butt. All right. Anyhow, let's move on into how was your gaming week?

339
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
We always like to start off the show with a little bit of what types of video games have you been playing this week in dark soccer?

340
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I know you've had a big week in gaming. I played old stuff.

341
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,000
We hooked up the Super Nintendo last night for my friend Amanda's 30th birthday.

342
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Happy birthday, Amanda. And we played Turtles in Time, which is the most awesome game ever.

343
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And we had some Super Mario World, some rock and roll racing, which is funny.

344
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
My my friend's mom turned around and said, is that Black Sabbath coming from the Super Nintendo game?

345
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Yes, ma'am, it was. And that was Blizzard before they were Blizzard.

346
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Yeah, it was pre Blizzard and which led us to a discussion about the lost Vikings and how you can actually find them in WoW.

347
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Yeah, in Alderman. And if you are Horde, though, you can kill them, which is pretty fun.

348
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I was doing that when I was way past level. So I played a little bit of Final Fantasy 14 just because I only played a little because of all the stuff going on, especially with being sick and having to clean house and have the party.

349
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I finally got to play Cards Against Humanity. It's not a video game, I know, but it's totally wrong.

350
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:05,000
All the nerds are playing it. And I got the best win ever. I should I might say it on air, but it's really horrible.

351
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:17,000
But I did say that it's like an M. Knight, whatever his name is. The plot twist was that Nickelback was really perpetually handicapped.

352
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
M. Knight Shyamalan. Yeah, whatever.

353
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Shyamalan Dean Dong. That's what Dan calls him.

354
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:32,000
So we had the old school SNES stuff last night, and I have played some.

355
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I played Mass Victory on Thursday for the live stream, but I only played for a little bit because I was just feeling rotten.

356
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I mean, rotten.

357
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Today was a very special day because thanks to the lovely generosity of our first mate here, I have 3DS.

358
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
And then thanks to my husband not wanting me to make puppy eyes and wine at him, I have Animal Crossing.

359
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
He also got himself the last Fire Emblem game for the DS.

360
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
So there's a little something in it for you both. That's good, though.

361
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:10,000
And we're probably going to sell my old DSi since we only need to have one of each system.

362
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:19,000
And we have my pink GBA. I have the clear pink one. We have the Nintendo SP, whatever they're called.

363
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
The one that was done up by the NES.

364
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:29,000
So usually it's like when the new stuff comes out, we'll have one each of us and then sell off one of the old ones.

365
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
But right now we're poor.

366
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
So I've been playing, what, six hours of Animal Crossing today.

367
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
And I've already made the down payment on my house and bought a phone booth.

368
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:49,000
And then one of my friends on Tumblr, who I have to say thank you to my name, Twin, if she's listening.

369
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I got a Dave Strider shirt for anyone who's into Homestuck. It was really cool.

370
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
So my character's running around in it wearing pink glasses because ew, pink, but glasses.

371
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
So it's kind of a weird hipster.

372
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
That's a lot for just one day. You've probably done more in a day than I've done in the three weeks I've owned.

373
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I have all the fruit now. I do not have a watering can and I do not have a slingshot yet.

374
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
You'll get it.

375
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
It better be tomorrow.

376
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Don't forget to buy the fortune cookie every day.

377
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Oh, shoot. Well, don't you have to have coins or something?

378
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Yeah, you get those from walking around. So if you've been walking around with your 3DS today, you have coins.

379
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Okay.

380
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I'll go buy it.

381
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
It's so cute. DarkSakura's having to learn about her 3DS and how to add friends and all that stuff. It's fun.

382
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:43,000
And I played that MeFinder quest, shit, whatever, and the two of you I would expect would be Grade A adventurers, but you couldn't kill a ghost.

383
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Nope, not until you StreetPass with us several times.

384
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Yeah, it's actually based on how many times you StreetPass with a person. Up to, I think, seven times, I think is where it maxes out.

385
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I thought you guys would just run amok through my game.

386
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
No, I'm just like, look at my pretty penguin hat. Isn't it awesome?

387
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I love your penguin hat.

388
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
This is why I stopped playing Find Me because I don't need a better hat.

389
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Rob, I honestly like Slykic's hat better.

390
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Whatever.

391
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
The Mario hat.

392
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I want to have a propeller hat because that would be awesome.

393
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,000
So yeah, Animal Crossing, that's going to be my life from here on out. I did name my town Normandy, like I said I would.

394
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Congrats.

395
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
So either that, so either all of my townsfolk are going to call me Commander.

396
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Uh-huh.

397
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I mean, my character is Sakura because every Animal Crossing character I've ever had a Sakura.

398
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Either that or they're all going to have like French words that would be like Merde or Ulala or Zoot.

399
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Today, I made my crappy recreation of the VOG logo in my Animal Crossing town because we finished the custom signboard.

400
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
So right when you enter the town, you see now a big little VOG logo, my ghetto logo.

401
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I have a goal for this game though, to find Dina.

402
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
You want to be reunited?

403
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I want my lesbian back.

404
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Ours is a love lung tonight.

405
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
She was an aardvark, right?

406
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
No, she wasn't. I don't think she was an aardvark.

407
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I thought she was a duck.

408
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Whatever.

409
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
No, Mallory was a duck.

410
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
There were several ducks, Rob.

411
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I don't give a duck.

412
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
We have diversity.

413
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Fine.

414
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
You and your only aardvarks can be lesbians.

415
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Alright, moving on.

416
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Loki, I know you haven't been playing Animal Crossing. What have you been playing?

417
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I haven't been playing very much at all actually this week.

418
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:25,000
The two things I did play this week, one being Final Fantasy XIV, the beta.

419
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I played about an hour of that.

420
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I was actually going to play more, but then I just kept getting distracted.

421
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I was supposed to play a little bit of Planet Cardine, but I forgot.

422
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Hands hurt too much anyways to play anything.

423
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Final Fantasy XIV, I leveled to 9.

424
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I did my first instance battle thing as part of my storyline.

425
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
It was alright.

426
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I keep running into those event things though.

427
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I'll be just going somewhere and it's like,

428
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Oh, you stumbled upon a fate.

429
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Do shit.

430
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I'm like, okay, I guess I will.

431
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Then I get killed because I don't notice that my health is going down

432
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
because it's too much on the screen.

433
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
There's a tip I have for fates.

434
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
If you happen to find yourself overwhelmed, run through a big crowd of people.

435
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
The thing will not follow you.

436
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Well, it wasn't that at all.

437
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I didn't even notice it was doing a lot of damage to me.

438
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
It's because I just kept, you know, I'd get done with one

439
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
and immediately target the next thing and immediately go.

440
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Also, many people don't realize the UI is completely customizable even on PS3.

441
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
If the health bars are not in a unique place for you, try to move them.

442
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I should.

443
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Then the other thing I played was a little bit of Excite Truck this morning

444
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
because we wanted to entertain Josh.

445
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I was trying to get Mario Kart to work, but my disc wouldn't read in my Wii U,

446
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:57,000
which is weird because it did before and I was just not.

447
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Then it's just like, okay, I guess we'll do Wii Play,

448
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
and then he couldn't understand Wii Play.

449
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,000
So we did Excite Truck, and he just kind of let it sit there and coast in a circle.

450
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
So that was kind of fun.

451
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
But I actually did get to play a couple of races and stuff.

452
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Man, that game looks really basic now that you're not zooming through the landscape at a high rate of speed.

453
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
It's just very basic looking.

454
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I'm like, wow, that is very simple.

455
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
But it's still one of the few games that utilizes the SD card for a very awesome reason,

456
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
custom sounds, because their music wasn't very good.

457
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
It's all right.

458
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Let's see, what else?

459
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
A little bit of housekeeping.

460
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Thanks to one of our old listeners of the show

461
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:51,000
and also one of the old players that used to play on the Minecraft server that we had,

462
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
LordGally.

463
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
He has actually provided or said, hey, you know what?

464
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I have a server that not a lot of people play on.

465
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
You guys want to come play on our server?

466
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,000
So he gave me full access to the admin stuff for it, so we'll be able to set it up.

467
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,000
It's actually a lot more flexible than the old ones, so I can actually do all the kind of mods I wanted to do.

468
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Well, somebody needs to build a shrine to LordGally first thing for that, because that's an awesome gesture.

469
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Thank you, LordGally.

470
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I have to check with him, because right now it's set to survival and stuff,

471
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
so I have to see if he wants to switch it off of that and put it on bucket and everything.

472
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
But now that I have all the tools to do that, I've just got to sit down and actually research what I want to do.

473
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I wanted to put a Spoutcraft server on there, because Spout's pretty awesome,

474
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
because you can create all the custom shapes and stuff,

475
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
like other materials that are unique to the game.

476
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:47,000
So you could have new enemies, you could have planes, cars, guns, all sorts of crazy stuff.

477
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,000
So I'll see how hard that is and may do that, but it looks like it'll be a lot of fun,

478
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
and hopefully we'll get to play it again.

479
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
This man is bouncing off the walls in chat, he's very excited to hear that it's back.

480
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:03,000
So soon, I'll have the details in the Vaga Minecraft forum.

481
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Slidekick, are you a Minecraft player? You ever tried that out?

482
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I've actually never played Minecraft before, so I probably should.

483
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:17,000
It's different. It's a game, but it's more like Legos on the computer.

484
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
It's hard to explain.

485
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
It's clever. It's never really been a high priority for me,

486
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
but I should check it out, so give it a chance.

487
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Okay, if that's it for Loki's Gaming Week, then I will move into my gaming week real quick.

488
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I didn't have a lot to play. Honestly, I OD'd on Final Fantasy XIV this weekend during the beta.

489
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I played damn near nonstop. I had a couple other things to do here locally,

490
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
but when I wasn't out and about, I was trying to stay out of the heat,

491
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
and I was playing the crap out of Final Fantasy XIV beta.

492
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:55,000
My Thaumaturge is level 16. I started with Thaumaturge and switched to Conjurer,

493
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
and my Conjurer is now 17, so I've got both those jobs going.

494
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
So is Conjurer the XIV version of a Summoner now?

495
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
No, that's going to be Arcanist, which isn't in the beta yet, so there's still stuff to add.

496
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Arcanist will lead to Summoner and Scholar eventually,

497
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:20,000
and then Thaumaturge leads to Black Mage and Conjurer leads to White Mage.

498
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
But you don't ever get stuck with just one job.

499
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:31,000
It's not like the XI system of sub-jobs. It's Final Fantasy V's more system where you choose traits.

500
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Because my Thaumaturge is level 16, when I play a Conjurer, I can have Thunder and Surecast from my Thaumaturge in my bar.

501
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:46,000
If I were to play a Gladiator, I could actually get weapon skills if they're compatible with my class.

502
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
But everybody should level a Conjurer to 2 to get a Cure.

503
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
You could have Cure with almost any class.

504
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
It makes a lot of stuff easier.

505
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I've just been playing the crap out of Final Fantasy XIV. I love it a lot.

506
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I think because in some ways it's still an MMO in its early stages.

507
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
We're not counting 1.0 at this point. I'm just throwing out 1.0.

508
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
In many ways, some of the combat I realized when I was healing a dungeon the other day,

509
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I'm like, you know, this game doesn't really have the complexity of World of Warcraft.

510
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
All I'm doing is Cure, Cure, Cure, and occasionally I'm doing Medica, which is the group Cure.

511
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Sometimes I'll get to nuke the mob, but I don't have the diversity that I have in World of Warcraft spells.

512
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Granted, World of Warcraft wasn't always like that. World of Warcraft's five expansions in right now.

513
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
So it's going to take time for Final Fantasy XIV to build up to that, and I see the potential there.

514
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
But I love that the combat is so fast-paced, but it's Final Fantasy.

515
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I like how you can utilize your terrain as well, because now that you can jump and stuff,

516
00:33:52,000 --> 00:34:00,000
you can actually say, okay, I'm going to hop up on here and cast spells from up on top of here,

517
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,000
and the monster can't really get around to me. It doesn't work all the time with goblins and stuff,

518
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
but when they do the bomb toss or whatever, it'll show where the bomb's going to be,

519
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
and you can run around behind them and you don't take any damage, which is pretty sweet.

520
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I actually liked that, too. That one duty I was having a problem with,

521
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I ended up just sprinting and kiting him the whole time, but it was really neat.

522
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
It actually worked a lot better than it did him well.

523
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,000
The game is so fanservice-y, too, and it's beautiful. The lighting effects are so beautiful.

524
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Have you played it on PC at all? It still looks pretty good on PS3, but my god,

525
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
some of the spell effects are like when you're casting in the water,

526
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,000
and the very first instance you go in is this blue ocean pirate-y thing.

527
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I really hope this game goes free-to-play very fast, because I kind of want to play it.

528
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Don't hold your breath.

529
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I can tell you one thing. If you've got a high-end graphics card and you have everything bumped up all the way,

530
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
it's just, everything is there.

531
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I thought I was going to have to get a new system, but there has been such a jump in performance

532
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
from the last beta to this beta. I'm like, oh my god, this game looks great on my not-so-great computer.

533
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I'm so thrilled.

534
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
It really sets it to optimize to what you got.

535
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Been loving Final Fantasy XIV. One of the other fanservice-y things I have to talk about,

536
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
the last boss in Tamtara Deepcroft, which is one of the instances,

537
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
it's a mage with a tentacle face, and I didn't catch it at first,

538
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,000
but Alan looks over and goes, dude, that's one of the mage mobs from Final Fantasy I.

539
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
And I'm like, oh my god, it is.

540
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
There's all these subtle fanservice things.

541
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
They changed something, by the way.

542
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
When you started off in Gridania, did you remake a character there?

543
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
No, I don't think so.

544
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Your intro is different now from how it was in the last one.

545
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
You have moogles.

546
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
No, I started in Ulda this time.

547
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Well, I went ahead and made another conjurer because I wanted to see if they added new quests.

548
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,000
And there's moogles, and it's really funny.

549
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
That's cute.

550
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Techness in chat says, oh, and where's the VoG link shell for Final Fantasy XIV?

551
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I accidentally rolled on one of the JP realms.

552
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
My assumption is that Horde House, being the online gaming show,

553
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
will kind of pick up the VoG link shell thing and create.

554
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Right now we're on Behemoth, but that's subject to change for Beta 4.

555
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
We will let you know.

556
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Behemoth is busy.

557
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Yeah, Behemoth is busy, but we want to be on a busy server,

558
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
just because the first couple weeks might suck,

559
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
but later on, when the game starts thinning out,

560
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
you'll want to be on a busy server to find other people.

561
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Have they announced what the month-to-month price is going to be yet?

562
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
15.

563
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Is it really 15? I thought it was lower.

564
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Well, if it's lower, then that's even better.

565
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
But I was under the impression it was going to be the 1495 thing.

566
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I'm assuming somebody in chat will yell it out,

567
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
or if Shane Alinko is listening, he'll join shortly and yell it.

568
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
See, the thing is, I don't know.

569
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I hate paying for an MMO month-to-month

570
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
because I want to play so much other stuff.

571
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I feel locked into having to play that

572
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
to kind of get my money's worth each month,

573
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
and that's the thing.

574
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
That's why I quit Final Fantasy XI,

575
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
because I just wasn't playing it enough,

576
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
and I'm kind of afraid to get into something.

577
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
That's why free-to-play, or you buy the game

578
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
and then you can play whenever works well for me.

579
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I like the game. I like it a lot better.

580
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
It seems to be a lot easier to level up and stuff

581
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,000
than XI, which is nice, but I don't know.

582
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
All right, so anyway, Final Fantasy XIV.

583
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
And then the other game I've played a lot of this week,

584
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Marvel Heroes, the free-to-play MMO,

585
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
although it's a little more like Diablo.

586
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Free my ass.

587
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Yeah, well, it's got little transactions up the wazoo.

588
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Little?

589
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I started as Storm, of course, because I love Storm.

590
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
So I started playing as Storm, and then after I beat the first boss,

591
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I got the Scarlet Witch token,

592
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
so I can play as Scarlet Witch now, too.

593
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
That's who I started with.

594
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Yeah, so apparently all the characters will drop in the game.

595
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
It just might take forever.

596
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
But I'll give a cheap plug to this week's Hoard House,

597
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
because we had Mihail on this week,

598
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
and he talked about Marvel Heroes and a lot of League of Legends,

599
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
which I patched this week so I could play with Mihail

600
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
later this week when Final Fantasy XIV is not running.

601
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
HoardHouse.com.

602
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
It's not running this week?

603
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Only on the weekends, right?

604
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Yeah, Final Fantasy XIV is only running on the weekends,

605
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
but the rumor is there's going to be a longer stress test before Beta 4,

606
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
so we'll see.

607
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Anyhow, Slidekick, First Mate Slidekick,

608
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
what have you been playing this week?

609
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
What's a week of gaming look like to you?

610
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
It's pretty much been all Animal Crossing.

611
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,000
It's funny because I picked it up actually at the Nintendo experience

612
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
because they had a display sitting out, so I was like,

613
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
oh, I probably should get it.

614
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
And for the first couple of days I only played a little bit,

615
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
but lately I've just been playing for hours at a time,

616
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
and I'm like, oh, I've got to sleep now.

617
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
I also played the shit out of Animal Crossing.

618
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
That one night we were doing the Google Hangout with everybody.

619
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Good times.

620
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Yeah, so I just built the upstairs to my house.

621
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I've been going to the island a lot, catching bugs.

622
00:38:50,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Oh, I got Reggie's house in my spot pass in the Happy Home model homes gallery,

623
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
so I've been buying a lot of stuff out of Reggie's house.

624
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
And when you look in his little profile card it says,

625
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
my body is ready, so yeah.

626
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
You know it was an intern that did it, people.

627
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
It's not Reggie's actual house.

628
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
An intern did it for him.

629
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I did notice in some of the screenshots or whatever they were showing of the game

630
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,000
that they have a lot of cool niche Japanese arcade stuff you can get.

631
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I don't know if they have a Japanese arcade set,

632
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
but they have a candy cab, claw machine,

633
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
and some actual table cabinets and stuff like that.

634
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
They look pretty sweet.

635
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Not sweet enough for me to buy a 3DS for the game, but sweet enough.

636
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I have a claw machine in my Animal Crossing house.

637
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
It's awesome.

638
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Do you know what I loved in your town was the animal that had the chocolate fondue fountain.

639
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
That's what I wanted.

640
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Who doesn't want a chocolate fondue fountain?

641
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Let's be real.

642
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
And some macaroons.

643
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Come on.

644
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
You know what?

645
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
The first thing that I bought wasn't making a down payment on my house.

646
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I bought a phone booth.

647
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Is that the thing that looks like a TARDIS but red?

648
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
It's the current British style phone booth.

649
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
One of those was for sale in my town the night of the Google Hangout.

650
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Spike was like, open your gates right now.

651
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I'm coming to town.

652
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
That just started this whole wave of Animal Crossing fuckery.

653
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Except then he didn't take my virtual boy that I was saving for him.

654
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
He's a virtual boy fanatic.

655
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I'll have to get it to him.

656
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Now you're no longer friends.

657
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
What?

658
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,000
If they put in virtual boy games it would totally work with the lenticular.

659
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Oh, like a 3DS virtual console thing?

660
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Yeah.

661
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I don't even know about virtual boy emulation if that's actually a thing.

662
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I thought there were early rumors it was going to happen.

663
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:45,000
They just need to make Animal Crossing like the Nintendo version of PlayStation Home.

664
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Done.

665
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Well, rumors are it's going to go free to play at some point.

666
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
System seller right there.

667
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Makes sense.

668
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Anything else?

669
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Slidekick?

670
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
No.

671
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Actually just Animal Crossing this week.

672
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I've been meaning to get around to some other stuff.

673
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
But I'm actually in the process of moving.

674
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I've been trying to pack up my console games.

675
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
My 3DS is right here.

676
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
That's why I've been focusing on 3DS for the most part.

677
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Not to give out your home address for all the stalkers.

678
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
But you're moving to Daly City, right?

679
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Yes.

680
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Which is just Alan's old digs.

681
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Yeah, just Alan's old digs and just a quick bar right away from the city.

682
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Yes.

683
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Alright.

684
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Good thing you missed this weekend because I hear it was crazy.

685
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Oh yeah, with all the festivities.

686
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Yes.

687
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Lots of extra festivities.

688
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Lots of stuff in the news to be festive about.

689
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
But we are going to move into gaming news.

690
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
But first I want to go over some housekeeping.

691
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Of course I always like to plug our Twitter.

692
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

693
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
And Facebook.

694
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

695
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
And I was going to plug this during housekeeping.

696
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
We already mentioned it at the top of the show.

697
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
But I'll plug it again.

698
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
GamerX.

699
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Catch me.

700
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I'll be there live August 4th.

701
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Saturday.

702
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Question mark.

703
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I think the third is the Saturday.

704
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Yeah.

705
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
It's.

706
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Oh yeah.

707
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I keep thinking.

708
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Friday's not an official day.

709
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Friday's the VIP day.

710
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Okay.

711
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
It's the third and it's at seven o'clock in one of the panel rooms.

712
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
It's podcast.

713
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I thought it was six o'clock.

714
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
God, I'm so unprepared tonight.

715
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Look.

716
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
You get there and you just look for podcast cross zone.

717
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
And you're going to go to it because it has the word podcast in it.

718
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,000
And that's where you're going to see me and Slidekick and all the kids from Koopa Club

719
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
and Spike and Game Bar.

720
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
And it's going to be fun.

721
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Come up and say hello.

722
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
It will be great times.

723
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,000
And earlier today before the show, I was talking about cosplay because I think there is a costume

724
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I can pull off.

725
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
That's that's tasteful.

726
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
You're going to pull off your costume?

727
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
No.

728
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
This is tasteful Slidekick.

729
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
He's going to do the gladiator armor from Final Fantasy 14.

730
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Oh yeah.

731
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Yes.

732
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I'm going to wear the what is the sublegar?

733
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
The panties.

734
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
The leather mantis.

735
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
No.

736
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
You'd probably be very popular if you wore that.

737
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Yeah.

738
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
No.

739
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
No.

740
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
They'll be like, OK, that guy does not have the body to wear something like that.

741
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
So.

742
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
All right.

743
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
So I will wear something that will keep me covered.

744
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Thank you.

745
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I just turned 35, you know, so I don't need to be showing on my wrinkles.

746
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Such a press.

747
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
I know.

748
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
All right.

749
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Anyhow, let's for real get into some of the gaming news this week.

750
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:18,000
This is the gaming news that may not be on your radar or it's pinging huge on your radar.

751
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
One or the other.

752
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Right.

753
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
It's like.

754
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Yeah.

755
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
All right.

756
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Start us off.

757
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
All right.

758
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,000
So Index Corporation, the I think a pretty recent parent company of Atlas, they are having

759
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
some problems.

760
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:41,000
They are basically filing for civil rehabilitation and maybe selling off assets.

761
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I'm assuming.

762
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,400
Basically saying that, you know, the index media or index digital media, Inc. and Atlas

763
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:53,000
brand are unaffected by the proceedings of, I guess, in Japan.

764
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
They are going to be carrying on their day to day activities.

765
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Business as usual.

766
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Shimagami Tensei 4 and Dragon's Crown are still scheduled for release in summer.

767
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,000
And they also have some other titles that they're publishing, including the movie tie

768
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
in for R.I.P.D. and I guess Daylight.

769
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Oh, yeah.

770
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Daylight.

771
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I don't even remember what Daylight is.

772
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Daylight is the like survival horror.

773
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,000
You're thrown in a haunted house, I think, with only a flashlight and the PlayStation

774
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I record your scares so that like your friends can laugh at you.

775
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
That's kind of funny.

776
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
So, yeah.

777
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
So I don't know.

778
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Maybe they're not in too much trouble.

779
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
It's hard to say with Atlas because Atlas, they kind of deal with a lot of niche properties.

780
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
So for, you know, money seems to be very tight.

781
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Very small production runs.

782
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Very small everything.

783
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Budget.

784
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
So it's hard to say.

785
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Yeah, I've seen a lot of people worried about them.

786
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
But I mean, Atlas is well loved enough that they'll find a home.

787
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
A lot of people think that Sony or Nintendo would snap them up.

788
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,000
But I would be wouldn't be surprised if like Gung Ho or somebody would snap them up.

789
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Marvelous.

790
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
And a lot of people are afraid that EA might snap them up.

791
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I would think it would be like more like a Marvelous or what else?

792
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Access? I don't think it's too big to do that.

793
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
But I mean, those are kind of the three niche comp- or three companies that bring over

794
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
localized Japanese product nowadays.

795
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I guess maybe there's the other one, too, that's a spinoff of-

796
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
What the fuck was it called?

797
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,000
There was another spinoff company, too, that does some localization.

798
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Didn't XSeed just acquire somebody?

799
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Yeah, XSeed's Marvelous USA now.

800
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Oh, that's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

801
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
They should snap up Atlas, too. That would be great.

802
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Well, I don't think they're big enough.

803
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I mean, XSeed's, I think, quite small compared to Atlas.

804
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Atlas was kind of growing quite a bit.

805
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I thought they were going to be branching out more into like Western development stuff as well.

806
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Because they tried with Game of Thrones and they have a few Sherlock Holmes games and stuff.

807
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
But nothing's really taken off.

808
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
It's too bad because Game of Thrones could have been good.

809
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Except it was a really bad game.

810
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
That PlayStation 3 game you're talking about, the horror game, sounds really good.

811
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Sounds interesting.

812
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Better than what they have?

813
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Sony I thought had a PlayStation Move game.

814
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Although I don't know if it's Move anymore.

815
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:28,000
What was it? That one, it was supposed to be like a teen horror genre type game.

816
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I don't really know how that was going to work.

817
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
It's like a...

818
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I don't even remember the title of it now.

819
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Because it was that memorable.

820
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Shadow neck Shannon in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says,

821
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
What if Microsoft bought Atlas?

822
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
They would have a lot of Japanese content on their platform then.

823
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Well, that won't do them any good since they're not putting out the Xbox One in Japan at launch.

824
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,000
It would be an interesting, strategical move, but I think for Microsoft also a risky one.

825
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
You know what I mean?

826
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Yeah.

827
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I've heard a couple people say that could be a thing, but I don't think Microsoft really would do it.

828
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I think a lot of Nintendo fanboys would just eat it up if Nintendo would do it though.

829
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,000
That only exists in fanboy imagination, I think.

830
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
But you never know.

831
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Alright, well let's move on to another story.

832
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
And this is about Saints Row 4.

833
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Oh, Loki's looking forward to this one.

834
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Well, it's a good thing Loki doesn't live in Australia, or he might be waiting a little bit longer.

835
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Oh, please. Like, Australia stopped me from getting this.

836
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Yeah, right. And I'm sure there's a lot of people in Australia that are saying the same thing.

837
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:41,000
However, Saints Row 4 is now the first game to be refused classification in the country since Australia released their R18 Plus rating at the start of the year.

838
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Which doesn't make any sense to me.

839
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Yeah, I thought the whole reason the rating system was out was because when games wouldn't be classified before, they wouldn't be sold.

840
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Like, I remember Mortal Kombat was in that category.

841
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Yeah, because it was like an R up to 18 or something, or 17 or something.

842
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Well, anyhow, Deep Silver is working on basically a fix for Saints Row 4, but just for that region.

843
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:09,000
They say they're going to remove the content that could cause offense without reducing the outlandish gameplay the Saints Row fans know and love.

844
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
I don't know how they're going to do that, but good luck.

845
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,000
There's going to be a mod immediately after it comes out that'll put it all right back.

846
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Especially on PC.

847
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:24,000
How cute that Australia thinks it could regulate some of that, because on the internet this stuff will just come over instantly.

848
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
I just don't understand.

849
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
It just encourages piracy, too.

850
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
But did you hear the reason why it got...

851
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I didn't hear the specific reason why, no. What was it?

852
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
They have an anal probe.

853
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Oh.

854
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Oh, no.

855
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
No.

856
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
See, I was wondering where they would take the dildo vat next.

857
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
No, no, no.

858
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Yeah, they have an anal...

859
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Does it have a big satellite?

860
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:52,000
It basically looks like a giant dildo with a sword hilt or something on it, and you can shove it up the ass of your enemies.

861
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I'm like, this makes me want to buy the game even more.

862
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
I can't wait.

863
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
I got to find...

864
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Yeah, you just finished talking there.

865
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I'm going to find the exact description was hilarious.

866
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Didn't an episode of South Park have the anal probe, though?

867
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Wasn't that the first episode? Cartman gets an anal probe?

868
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I think it was.

869
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
The moment he said anal probe, the whole,

870
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
I like to sing about the moon and the truth,

871
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
popped into my head in that episode.

872
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Also, I guess games are getting hit left and right in Australia now.

873
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,000
State of Decay is another game that's been refused classification in Australia.

874
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
This was just not even that long after Word of Saints Row 4 happened.

875
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Microsoft is evaluating the options with regards to the title's classification.

876
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:48,000
The Australian classification system plays an important role in ensuring that Australians can only access age-appropriate games and content.

877
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
That was one day after Saints Row 4.

878
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Wow.

879
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:00,000
I kind of thought that this was supposed to stop all that censorship stuff, but I guess not.

880
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Alright, let's see here.

881
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Here we go.

882
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
This is the report, or from the report that they filed.

883
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,000
It says, the game includes a weapon referred to the applicant as an alien anal probe.

884
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
The applicant states that this weapon can be shoved into enemies' backsides.

885
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
The lower half of the weapon resembles a sword hilt.

886
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:26,000
The upper part contains prong-like appendages which circle around what appears to be a large dildo which runs down the center of the weapon.

887
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:31,000
When using this weapon, the player approaches a clothed victim from behind and thrusts the weapon between their legs

888
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,000
and then lifts them off the ground before pulling the trigger which launches the victim into the air.

889
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Sold!

890
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
That's not a probe, that's more like a bottle rocket.

891
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
You're such a teenager.

892
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
That's an ass launcher.

893
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
An ass launcher?

894
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Ass launcher.

895
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Ass master!

896
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Apparently after the probe has been inserted into the victim's anus, the area around their buttocks becomes pixelated,

897
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
highlighting that the aim of the weapon is to penetrate the victim's anus.

898
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,000
The weapon can be used during gameplay to enemy characters and civilians.

899
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
As long as they don't leave a blood trail, that would just be wrong.

900
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Yeah, and also alien narcotics was the other reason why, I guess, smoking alien narcotics equips the players with superpowers.

901
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Awesome.

902
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Do they actually get superpowers or do they just think they have superpowers?

903
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Who cares.

904
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Alrighty then, let's move on with something else.

905
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
I don't want to be on this planet anymore.

906
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Okay, well, a lot of people are not happy with Microsoft.

907
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,000
And among the people who are unhappy with Microsoft is the creator of Fez, Phil Fish.

908
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Try saying Fez and Phil Fish together three times fast.

909
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Fez, Phil Fish, Phil Fish, Phil Fish.

910
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,000
See?

911
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Cubos.

912
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:52,000
But basically he's saying that Microsoft was doing nothing to help sell his game on Xbox Live Arcade.

913
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
He complained about it on Twitter.

914
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,000
He said Microsoft was our publisher on Xbox 360 and they did nothing.

915
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
No promotion, no festivals, not a single mention.

916
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:08,000
In a newsletter or conference, they put us up on their shitty dashboard and somehow fucked that up too.

917
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
They put us up on the game marketplace with no cover image.

918
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
The file was missing for a week.

919
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:23,000
So basically, there's also, he's also saying that Microsoft is charging developers $10,000 for patches and updates.

920
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:33,000
And there's a lot of crap going on between, with misinformation going from Microsoft,

921
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000
not telling them about corruption within the file system or anything like that.

922
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,000
So basically, they're like, oh, we don't really care, indie developer.

923
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
We just want you to put your game up there.

924
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
We don't, we're not going to promote it.

925
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Just put it there.

926
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,000
We're not going to put anybody behind you.

927
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
ActDeft in chat says, Phil Fish, I hate the guy, but he's right in this one.

928
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Yeah.

929
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
I mean, yeah, because Microsoft doesn't let people self-publish to the indie.

930
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,000
I mean, they have XNA for self-publishing, although they're not going to be supporting that anymore.

931
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:06,000
And this is part of why people are mad because you can publish under Microsoft, but then, you know, there's all these other complaints.

932
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Yeah, and Microsoft was charging $10,000 for them to put in a fix in corrupted files.

933
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Yeah, Fez really got screwed by all that business.

934
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:25,000
And on top of that, Microsoft did confirm that they automatically charged developers for resubmissions of games was scrapped in April, is what they're saying.

935
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
But they never told any of the developers about that.

936
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
They said that the new policy was retroactive, but they never said anything.

937
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Well, didn't you have more information on that, Loki?

938
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Nope, I had exactly that information.

939
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:42,000
And of course, on top of that, you know, Phil Fish is still pissed off about the whole thing.

940
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:49,000
See, this is kind of funny, I think, because he was complaining that, oh, well, you know, I don't know if he had a patch or something.

941
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:54,000
First he put out a patch for the game, and it fucked up the game even more than the patch, you know, without the patch.

942
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:00,000
And so then they pulled the patch, I guess, and he couldn't resubmit the patch or something.

943
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
But now that it's free, why isn't he resubmitting the patch?

944
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Perhaps by this point it's just done with the fuckery.

945
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:15,000
But if he had it done already, if he had that fixed patch done already, I'm assuming he still has the data, why can't he just resubmit it instead of being a complete douche?

946
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,000
I know, because he wants to sell Feds 2, which will be coming out to platforms other than Xbox One.

947
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Unless it's seriously trying to distance himself from Microsoft, which I can see that, trying just to remove any association between your product and Microsoft.

948
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:37,000
I mean, especially, I mean, keep in mind the bottom line of development is money.

949
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:44,000
If he's trying to market a next game, it's a smart move to separate it from where it's already been screwed over.

950
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Well, ShadowNextGen in our chat says, Sony was charging for updates too, I believe. It wasn't Microsoft.

951
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
I don't think they were charging that much.

952
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I want to say I remember hearing something like that too, because I remember it was a big deal when Wii U first came out,

953
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,000
is that's why indies were embracing it, is because Nintendo wasn't charging.

954
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
And that was like a huge selling point.

955
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I'm pretty sure, I mean, Sony has to have gotten rid of that since though.

956
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:15,000
They might have just done it a lot quieter than Microsoft did, because look at all those indies they lured to their E3 press conference.

957
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:24,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, Earth.

958
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Alright, well speaking of Microsoft, a very interesting patent revealed out of Microsoft.

959
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
It was a patent filed back in December of 2011.

960
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,000
This would have been around the time Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary or the Halo remake came out.

961
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:45,000
It was a patent for a video game that would, quote, have a plurality of game engines running concurrently.

962
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:53,000
And you might remember, the Halo Anniversary game lets you go between updated visuals and original Xbox back and forth.

963
00:55:53,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Apparently, this is what the patent was out there for, is that it was for remakes of games where you could have original graphics and,

964
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:07,000
I thought this was interesting, leveraging player emotions tied to the original experience.

965
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:13,000
However, this may be lost as modern graphics may cause the gamers to lose that feeling of nostalgia.

966
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,000
So it was because of an emotional connection, which I guess I could see that.

967
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:26,000
I mean like, when I download some of the, there was a whole bunch of these games on Xbox Live Arcade when that first came out, like all the Konami remakes.

968
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
And you could play like Gyruss, you could play it with the original graphics or the HD graphics.

969
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:36,000
You have to play with the original graphics. I can't play with the new graphics because they're not that good and it's hard to see the bullets sometimes.

970
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Well that's a different thing, that's not that you're nostalgic for the old graphics, it's just that you're really lame.

971
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Maybe a little bit.

972
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:48,000
So, I don't know, sounds like you're smoking some alien narcotics here because I don't see the point.

973
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Weren't we having that discussion though about voice acting today?

974
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Oh, a little bit, yeah.

975
00:56:52,000 --> 00:57:01,000
With Metal Gear, how they updated the voice acting, I mean it was all the same people, but they didn't put the same cheesiness into it, I guess.

976
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
I wonder if it's sort of along the same lines.

977
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Well a lot of that happened with the Silent Hill HD remakes too, is that people are extremely partial to the original Silent Hill, but because of contracts and things like that, they couldn't reuse that dialogue in the HD remake, so they redid it.

978
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
The original Silent Hill 3 was a lot better.

979
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Slidekick, are you emotionally tied to retro games?

980
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:28,000
You know what this actually made me think of is when they put out the Star Wars DVDs that had the original video.

981
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:33,000
I think it might have been like a laser disc transfer or something because that's all they had that wasn't destroyed at that point.

982
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Which one?

983
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:39,000
The original Star Wars trilogy, they put out a DVD set that was like two discs.

984
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Which I have that set.

985
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Yeah, me too.

986
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
That were the theatrical releases.

987
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Yes.

988
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,000
And those I think were redone off of film prints.

989
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Oh, film prints, okay.

990
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
So like hand shot first on the laser disc?

991
00:57:53,000 --> 00:58:00,000
I have a version of it. I have the THX remasters on laser disc, or yes indeed he shot first.

992
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:13,000
We call them the non fucked up remasters because they actually had the whole THX sound, they did all the cleanup, they had the extra, you know where you see the X's flying in the air instead of X wings flying in the air?

993
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:18,000
They had all of the corrections made but they didn't do any of the changes.

994
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
And I got it for 11 bucks.

995
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:27,000
That's a good point though that people are definitely tied to that emotionally because you bring up the new Star Wars with anybody.

996
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Is there anybody out there, anybody that prefers Lucas's changes in the original trilogy? Anybody?

997
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,000
People with brain damage. I mean, I'm sorry.

998
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Don't offend.

999
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
You know what?

1000
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Diversity, Dark Sakura.

1001
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
You know what?

1002
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
What?

1003
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Still wrong.

1004
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,000
I don't think people are that nostalgic for Xbox One graphics to be honest.

1005
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:56,000
They're redoing the game with, you know, I think it was like Halo 3 or Halo Reach's engine, which is not bad and definitely the graphics look way better.

1006
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:02,000
I don't see the point of having to tax the system that much by running two copies of the game at the same time.

1007
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,000
I think it's a little ridiculous because you either sell a copy of the game.

1008
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:14,000
I mean, I wonder if they have the actual data of how many people actually play that game with the new graphics versus old graphics.

1009
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:20,000
And then also a subset of that, how many people play the game with the new graphics and old graphics and use the Kinect to...

1010
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Old graphics, new graphics, old graphics, new graphics.

1011
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
The same people that sit there and yell grenade to throw a grenade.

1012
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade.

1013
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,000
And you know, HD remasters seem to be pretty popular, so I mean, I don't know why.

1014
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,000
But some of them are so good. Like, I am so there for the Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy X.

1015
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Oh, that looks gorgeous.

1016
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:45,000
I'm just, I'm running up to the feeder bar. Gimme pellet, gimme pellet. Like, you know, some of that, you know, I'm a sucker for some of it.

1017
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,000
You know who I wouldn't want to go up against, you know, using the Kinect and the Halo thing?

1018
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:54,000
The guy that used to do the Micro Machines commercials because, my God, he would fucking own online.

1019
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,000
I think he should be relieved that he's dead.

1020
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
It doesn't matter.

1021
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
And John Machida.

1022
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
There's always, there's always a master and an apprentice, okay?

1023
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
There's somebody out there that's, you know, gonna follow up.

1024
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
For the record.

1025
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,000
But if we don't have the proof that he's dead and he's not six feet under, then it's not the real thing.

1026
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,000
For the record, he was also Blur in the Transformers movie, just saying.

1027
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Did any of you play Mega Man Powered Up for PSP?

1028
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
It was the remake of Mega Man 1.

1029
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Yes.

1030
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:30,000
It wasn't bad, but they replaced the original Mega Man 1 music, which, you know, one has good music, but I mean, it's not two or three.

1031
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,000
The GameCube one, too, I think.

1032
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Oh, really?

1033
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
I don't think it had the redunk, I can't remember.

1034
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
It just had this cutesy music that I was like, no, no, no.

1035
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Yeah, it had, like, the new music in it, yeah.

1036
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:45,000
It was just too cutesy, so I can understand the nostalgia thing at times, but, you know.

1037
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Alright.

1038
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Alright, let's move on with some more news.

1039
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Dark Soccer's got something for us, then we're gonna get to release dates.

1040
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
I was trying to find out when John Machida died.

1041
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Oh, well.

1042
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Stories.

1043
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
It was a while ago.

1044
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
It was a while.

1045
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
I hate to say it, it was a while ago.

1046
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
I think it was sometime while I was still in high school, maybe?

1047
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
I don't know.

1048
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Anyway, there is some good news for people who were gonna put some stock into the Xbox

1049
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
One.

1050
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,000
They've actually improved the memory performance for the console.

1051
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Basically, they, let me see if I can't find exactly the amount.

1052
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:31,000
They've actually have now a 32 megabyte of embedded static RAM that's going to make up

1053
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:37,000
the difference in processing speed between what was previously announced for the Xbox

1054
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
One and the PlayStation 4.

1055
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:45,000
But, meh, I don't know if it's still gonna be as good.

1056
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:51,000
They're saying that right now, that 192 gigabytes a second is theoretically possible.

1057
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
I know, what do you think?

1058
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
32 megabytes of RAM?

1059
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Man, that console must be worth thousands of dollars, said somebody in the 90s.

1060
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Well, they're saying it's this embedded static RAM, which I think just means it's a new chip.

1061
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:15,000
It just kinda sucks because launch games always are not gonna look as good as games later

1062
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,000
in the console's lifespan.

1063
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Especially now that they're like, oh, right away we're shipping with more memory.

1064
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,000
The games that are prepared for launch probably won't be able to take advantage of that, and

1065
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
that kinda sucks.

1066
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Well, they were saying right now that their original calculations, just as a base calculation,

1067
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:44,000
came up to 128 bytes per block multiplied by 800 megahertz, and that now that they've

1068
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:49,000
been able to reasonably get in their simulations 133 gigabytes a second.

1069
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Alright, and I want no excuses if the Xbox One versions are inferior to the PlayStation

1070
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,000
4 versions.

1071
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
That's what I'm just saying.

1072
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Now that you're not gonna get your games online, we got more speed.

1073
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Hold on a second there.

1074
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
You said you added 32 megs of RAM.

1075
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,000
This should be night and day difference, right?

1076
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
On my 486.

1077
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:15,000
I honestly think this is a bunch of just, it's a bullet point to report on and no one

1078
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
knows what the hell it means.

1079
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Why, if they're just gonna add this RAM, why can't the developers just go back and turn

1080
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
up the graphics on level 3?

1081
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Don't they just take a big dial and turn up the graphics?

1082
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
I guess they could.

1083
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,000
What they're basically saying this means is that for some of the games that they showed

1084
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:33,000
in E3 that kind of stuttered along, that it should improve performance dramatically.

1085
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
I mean, I'm not sure what this 32 megabyte thing is gonna do.

1086
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:40,000
I mean, it has to be something involved with another calculation, like maybe a buffer or

1087
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
something, I don't know.

1088
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,000
It's to save more pictures of you masturbating.

1089
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Wow.

1090
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,000
On its Kinect.

1091
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
It's the fat box one.

1092
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:54,000
The 32 megabytes is basically just to put it in its actual, you know, so it runs off

1093
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
an actual console.

1094
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Yeah.

1095
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Tigerclaw in chat says, yeah, he's right.

1096
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:03,000
The first crop of games won't take full advantage of the hardware until, whoa, what the hell,

1097
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:07,000
until, don't paste five lines at once when I'm trying to read.

1098
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Tigerclaw says, the first crop of games won't take full advantage of the hardware until

1099
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:15,000
a year or so later when the developers finally figured out how to push the hardware to its

1100
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
limits.

1101
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
But that happens with every console.

1102
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
What was that?

1103
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,000
RAM or not?

1104
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,000
What was that Rome game?

1105
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Rise.

1106
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Rise.

1107
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Rise from your wave.

1108
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Uh, they were saying that like it looks choppy right now and that like, you know, this might

1109
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,000
smooth out some frame rates or something, but we'll see.

1110
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Wow.

1111
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:38,000
A fifth dream in that big post he put says the Micro Machines guy is not dead.

1112
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Yes.

1113
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,000
But seriously though, if he was in this, I swore he was dead too.

1114
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Well, I mean, I didn't like swear like, God, I hope he's dead.

1115
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:50,000
He'd be dead within the first 15 seconds of that, you know, uh, Eddie Murphy movie 1000

1116
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,000
kids.

1117
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:58,000
So maybe, maybe I'm looking at the Wikipedia article and sure enough, Wiki says he ain't

1118
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,000
dead.

1119
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Huh?

1120
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Well, that's good.

1121
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Then maybe I'm thinking of somebody else.

1122
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
No, it was, it was, what's his name?

1123
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Um, Chris Lotta.

1124
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Hmm.

1125
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
I was thinking of, well, he just needs to come back and do something.

1126
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Anything.

1127
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
I don't care.

1128
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000
I need him talking in something.

1129
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,240
Trailer TV movie.

1130
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:16,240
It doesn't matter.

1131
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:17,240
Yeah.

1132
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:18,240
I was thinking of Chris Lotta.

1133
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:22,320
At least that urban legend, I can understand someone falling for that cause I, I could

1134
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:25,280
swear, I could swear like I've heard that that guy's dead too.

1135
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:28,840
It's not like you came on here and said like the kid from the wonder years is Marilyn Manson.

1136
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:30,720
Like people believe that.

1137
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:31,720
Yeah.

1138
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:37,240
It was Chris Lotta that died in 1994 and he was the voice of a Starscream and Cobra commander.

1139
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:38,240
Oh, okay.

1140
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:42,240
So I have the stupid transformers analogy in my head.

1141
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:44,320
All right, look, uh, we're getting way off track.

1142
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:47,280
So why don't we talk about some release dates, some video games that we could play this week

1143
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:49,840
and get our mind off of dead celebrities.

1144
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:52,720
There is not a much coming out this week.

1145
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:58,320
It's basically just one 3DS game and it's Crash City Mayhem.

1146
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:02,960
The only reason I think it's kind of cool for the 3DS is it's based off a really old

1147
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:09,040
series called Runabout, which is on the Sega Dreamcast and PlayStation one or, you know,

1148
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:14,480
if you played it over here in the United States, it was Felony 179, a racing game where the

1149
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:19,160
whole point of the game was a crash in the shit and it was awesome and super glitchy.

1150
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:25,000
I remember one time I took a full size bus, a tour bus, and I tried to go through the

1151
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,600
train tunnel.

1152
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:29,880
I don't even know how I got it in the train tunnel and I tried to turn around like, you

1153
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:33,960
know, you do an awesome, the Austin Powers movie and it got stuck in there in such a

1154
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:38,040
way that it started spinning like a helicopter until it got enough speed where it shot straight

1155
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:39,040
up through the roof.

1156
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:40,040
Hilarious.

1157
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:41,040
Good times.

1158
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,040
Yeah, that's it.

1159
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:43,040
That's all that's coming out this week.

1160
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:44,040
All right, well let's go over to Japan.

1161
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:48,920
On July 4th in Japan on the PlayStation three, Loki's really excited.

1162
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:51,680
Earth Defense Forces four is out.

1163
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:54,160
I'm may have to import that.

1164
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:56,440
It'll cost you $71 and 49.

1165
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,000
I may have to import that.

1166
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Wow.

1167
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Alrighty.

1168
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,240
Uh, you could also import for much cheaper, a smart headset three, which is also released

1169
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:06,720
on the PlayStation three.

1170
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:07,720
Who cares?

1171
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:08,720
Right?

1172
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:10,920
How about on the Xbox three 60 also earth defense forces four.

1173
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:15,000
There's also a limited edition with gold membership for 86 99 I'm assuming that's like

1174
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Xbox live Japan cause you know who's paying for Xbox live over there.

1175
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Very few people.

1176
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
I'm sure.

1177
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,840
Um, nothing of note on the Vita this week.

1178
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:27,160
I'm just looking at my other releases and nothing really on Wii U either.

1179
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:29,760
Did you know they don't have new super Luigi until July 13th.

1180
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:32,500
Oh, I bet that's the retail release though.

1181
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:34,800
They probably have the download version, just not the retail release.

1182
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:36,880
Well how about on the Nintendo three as three DS?

1183
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,800
There's a couple of games there.

1184
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:44,480
Uh, Toriko gourmet battle comes out as well as mommy Goma, happy sweets farm.

1185
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:45,800
That sounds nice.

1186
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:49,720
I want to see what, God, I hope it's not another game starring scantily clad characters.

1187
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:52,280
Oh, it's the little seal cute thing.

1188
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:53,280
Yes.

1189
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:56,760
This stars a little seal cute thing and plushies of the little seal.

1190
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:57,760
Oh God, these things are adorable.

1191
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:02,060
It looks like they just kind of wither on the ground and they run a farm.

1192
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:05,000
It's Farmville and they also make sushi rolls.

1193
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
It's Farmville.

1194
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Rob, that's a sweet roll.

1195
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,000
That's a sweet roll.

1196
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:09,440
That's a Swiss cake.

1197
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:12,680
Oh, it's a little Debbie roll with the strawberry.

1198
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:14,840
It's called a Swiss cake.

1199
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:17,120
Like I said, a little Debbie.

1200
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:19,760
It's a strawberry shortcake.

1201
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:21,640
I want them to localize that.

1202
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:23,280
I want a fucking strawberry shortcake.

1203
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:24,280
Damn.

1204
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:27,260
You know, we have strawberry cheesecake ice cream at my house.

1205
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:29,080
That would involve going to my house after the show.

1206
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:31,000
That would involve no cause that would involve going outside.

1207
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,920
I'm sorry to say.

1208
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:34,280
That's it for Japanese releases.

1209
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:35,280
Star Sakura.

1210
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:36,280
How about the UK?

1211
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:37,600
Stuff.

1212
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:40,120
Stuff and things are coming out.

1213
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:44,160
What we have on July 3rd is we have Limbo for iPad and iPhone.

1214
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:45,160
Oh my God.

1215
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:47,120
I need that on my phone.

1216
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:49,120
Not really.

1217
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:50,840
Mortal Kombat Complete Collection.

1218
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,880
Sorry, Complete Edition.

1219
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:56,360
They should have called it Complete Collection, but no, I see why because then they would

1220
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:57,360
have been racist.

1221
01:08:57,360 --> 01:08:58,360
Yeah.

1222
01:08:58,360 --> 01:08:59,360
But that's on PC.

1223
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:00,720
Well, you know what I mean.

1224
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:03,480
Too many, too many.

1225
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:10,760
Then we have a scourge outbreak on Xbox 360 and on July 4th we have Trackmania 2 Valley

1226
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:14,200
and on the 5th we have Dark.

1227
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:15,200
Sakura?

1228
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:16,200
No.

1229
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:17,200
Just Dark.

1230
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:18,200
Sakura.

1231
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:20,920
It's a vampire stealth action game.

1232
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:23,640
I don't know why, but that made me think of Craig Ferguson.

1233
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:26,760
Being published by Atlas because they publish Calypso games now.

1234
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:27,760
Okay.

1235
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:32,640
It made me think of Craig Ferguson talking about damp being a color.

1236
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:36,320
Just a couple more news stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week, Loki.

1237
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:40,000
Or don't.

1238
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:44,560
So there's some cool stuff being added to Steam.

1239
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:48,840
First off, the source software development kit now is including native support for the

1240
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:50,080
Oculus Rift.

1241
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:57,680
So if you have the dev kit, you got more games to play it on or at least hopefully soon.

1242
01:09:57,680 --> 01:10:02,040
So they're really embracing that and that's going to be kind of cool.

1243
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:06,920
And then finally, the Steam trading cards, it's out of beta.

1244
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:09,000
Now it's available to everybody.

1245
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:15,120
So far it supports 30 games including Team Fortress 2, Faster Than Light, Grid 2, Monaco

1246
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:23,840
Trying 2, Super Meat Boy, Counter Strike Global Offensive, Portal, Half Life, Don't

1247
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,760
Starve and Borderlands 2.

1248
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:30,520
Okay, so at the risk of sounding like a complete moron, can someone explain to me how the trading

1249
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:34,560
card thing works because it's not based on achievements.

1250
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:37,560
It's based on time playing the game.

1251
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:42,440
So I think it might be on achievements, I think it's just based on time playing the

1252
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:43,440
game.

1253
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:44,440
You get so many.

1254
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:45,440
I noticed I have a Steam level now too.

1255
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:48,200
So you get XP and I think some of that's from the trading cards, right?

1256
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:51,520
But I got a lot from participating in old sales and things like that.

1257
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:54,280
Which by the way, July 4th is next week.

1258
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:55,280
You know what that means.

1259
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:56,600
Barbecue at my house.

1260
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:57,600
Well, that and...

1261
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:58,600
Hide your wallets.

1262
01:10:58,600 --> 01:10:59,600
Hide your wallets.

1263
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:00,680
Hide your wife.

1264
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:01,680
Hide your kids.

1265
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:03,880
Because Steam sales is gonna happen.

1266
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:05,200
I ain't got cash for that shit.

1267
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:06,960
And they're slashing all the prices on up here.

1268
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:07,960
See, here's the thing though.

1269
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:09,400
I've already bought so much stuff.

1270
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:12,880
I don't really know if there's much more I need.

1271
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:15,440
All I need is that Civ 5 expansion.

1272
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:16,880
That's all I need.

1273
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:17,880
Everything else...

1274
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:18,880
No, Rob.

1275
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:19,880
You want it.

1276
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:20,880
You need air.

1277
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:21,880
No.

1278
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:22,880
I fucking need it.

1279
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:23,880
The new expansion?

1280
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:24,880
Which expansion?

1281
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:25,880
Will you die without it?

1282
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:29,160
Yeah, you need me to get it because otherwise you will not want to be on this program with

1283
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:30,720
Oh, we'll have Grumpy Dick Rob.

1284
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:33,560
Are you talking about the new expansion coming out in July or the one that's...

1285
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:34,560
The one that's like a couple weeks.

1286
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:36,120
You know July is tomorrow, right?

1287
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:40,560
I understand that, but you're talking about the one that's coming out in Brave New World.

1288
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:43,480
It's not gonna be on the Steam sale, but it's something on Steam I need to get.

1289
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:44,480
Yeah, Brave New World.

1290
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:48,400
I don't remember if that's next week or if that's gonna be the week after next.

1291
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:50,400
I think it's the 8th.

1292
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:53,200
I think they're releasing it just in time for my boyfriend's birthday.

1293
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:57,200
I think there's like all of two games on Steam right now I'm interested in.

1294
01:11:57,240 --> 01:11:59,240
One of them is that what Miami...

1295
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:00,240
God, I can't ever...

1296
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:01,240
Hotline Miami.

1297
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:02,240
Hotline Miami.

1298
01:12:02,240 --> 01:12:06,640
Because I want to go around shooting people in bloody messes with weird synth music.

1299
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,640
Should have gotten in on that with the Humble Bundle man.

1300
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:09,640
I know.

1301
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:10,640
Good prices there.

1302
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:12,640
But I have bills.

1303
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:14,640
Oh, bills.

1304
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:15,640
All right.

1305
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:16,640
Let's see.

1306
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:19,640
I just had to do something like go to Alabama.

1307
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:20,640
All right.

1308
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:21,640
One more story for you guys here.

1309
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:24,120
And this is a follow up to something we had talked about before.

1310
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:29,480
Apparently Nintendo may have been easing up a bit on the whole Let's Play video thing.

1311
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:34,160
Remember that they were really unpopular for a week there because they didn't shut down

1312
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:38,960
Let's Play videos, but they're like, we're gonna take the money and use it for us if

1313
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:42,440
you have a Let's Play video that features our newer games.

1314
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:49,840
Well, a popular YouTuber who goes by Zach Scott at Zach Scott Games on YouTube apparently

1315
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:54,280
was in an interview with a gaming website where he has returned to making Let's Play

1316
01:12:54,280 --> 01:13:02,040
videos because he heard that high profile Nintendo games were apparently no longer being

1317
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:03,040
pulled by Nintendo.

1318
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:04,040
Thank you.

1319
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:06,120
Will you launch?

1320
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:07,280
You think that's part of it?

1321
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:09,280
No, no, no.

1322
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:13,480
Since you mentioned analytics and stuff like that and getting paid on stuff, I just happened

1323
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:14,960
to check my...

1324
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:17,420
Well, here's the timing on this.

1325
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:22,620
It's part of the revenue reports because on May 14th, his ad earnings ceased, but then

1326
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:25,300
they started again on May 23rd.

1327
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:29,500
So he made a leap of faith since he saw the revenue return and no other claims have been

1328
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:31,100
made on his videos since.

1329
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:33,500
So Nintendo may have given up as fast as they implemented it.

1330
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:36,100
I mean, that's what, two weeks, if even?

1331
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:39,940
You know, when we talked about this on Game Buoy, this kind of was an unpopular opinion

1332
01:13:39,940 --> 01:13:46,340
actually, but I just didn't really understand people actually making a living off of Let's

1333
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:47,340
Plays.

1334
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:48,340
It happens.

1335
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:52,020
If it works for you, I guess more power to you, but you know.

1336
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:57,460
Well, as I mentioned before, because I started monetizing some of my YouTube videos, just

1337
01:13:57,460 --> 01:14:04,980
honestly, I wasn't making anything off of them until now, but I only have one video

1338
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:11,460
that has just about 8,000, 9,000 views on it and 36 bucks right there from just that.

1339
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:15,200
So if you make a lot of videos and you're consistent about it and a lot of those Let's

1340
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:18,880
Play videos get a lot more than just 8,000 views.

1341
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:25,400
So you can make quite a bit of money, you know, and you probably in the wrong fucking

1342
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:26,400
business.

1343
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:27,400
This is the last episode.

1344
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:31,400
Oh, LR, everybody was wonderful these last 11 years, but we're moving to YouTube next

1345
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:35,500
week in our little five minute chunk segments, which will just be Loki and I arguing in dark

1346
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:36,500
soccer crying.

1347
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:40,760
Well, no, no, no, Dan and I were actually talking about doing this with our turbo graphics

1348
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:41,760
games.

1349
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:42,760
So it'd be fun.

1350
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:44,080
So yeah, there's money that you made.

1351
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:48,120
I mean, I'm not looking to make a living off of, you know, putting YouTube videos out

1352
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:54,800
there, but 36, $36 I didn't have before 36 bucks to buy another.

1353
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:55,800
That's half.

1354
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:58,720
That's about halfway to the Earth Defense Force for.

1355
01:14:58,720 --> 01:14:59,720
There you go.

1356
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:00,720
Absolutely.

1357
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:01,720
Wow.

1358
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:04,520
Well, you know, and I'm, I'm kind of actually slight kick.

1359
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:08,880
I know you said that it was an unpopular opinion, but I, I think we talked about this on the

1360
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:09,880
show originally.

1361
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:12,520
I actually kind of voiced a very similar thing where I'm like, really, you, you can make

1362
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:13,520
a living off this.

1363
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:18,640
I mean, it's not, I mean, no shade to those that do very well with let's play videos.

1364
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:19,800
I have a respect it.

1365
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:21,080
It takes work to do this podcast.

1366
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:25,040
It takes a lot of work to do is let's play videos, but you have to admit you do owe some

1367
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:28,600
of the success to the game that you are featuring.

1368
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:29,600
You know what I mean?

1369
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:30,600
Yeah.

1370
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:33,280
So if they want to come in and get a cut, but I think Nintendo just kind of did a Dick

1371
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,160
move by cutting it all off.

1372
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:36,160
You know what I mean?

1373
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:40,200
Like there should have been some type of sharing, you know, the let's play content gets something,

1374
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:44,080
Nintendo gets a little something, something too, or, you know, they get their own commercials

1375
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:47,520
in there, you know, things like that, you know, but yeah, they, they need to take a

1376
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:51,320
smaller cut, you know, like circumcision, not Lorena Bobbitt.

1377
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:56,000
That is a great analogy.

1378
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Dude.

1379
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,280
Oh, thanks.

1380
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:00,280
I don't want your hands.

1381
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:02,000
Don't fist bump him for that.

1382
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
You know, I did.

1383
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:08,440
I just, I didn't high five him because I don't, I hope you get the blister thing.

1384
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:11,600
It's not here, Rob.

1385
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:20,200
You can't get it from touching my hands.

1386
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,160
Clearly you're not afraid of germs.

1387
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:23,360
She starts handling my feces.

1388
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:29,120
I can't make any promises.

1389
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:30,120
Do you have a diaper fetish?

1390
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:31,120
Loki?

1391
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:32,120
No, I do not.

1392
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:33,120
Oh, that's good.

1393
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:34,120
That's good.

1394
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:35,120
I thought that was just your dinner.

1395
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:36,120
That smelled.

1396
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:42,200
For the record, if you would pay attention, the more you expose yourself to germs, the

1397
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:43,840
stronger your immune system gets.

1398
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:44,840
It's very good chance.

1399
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:48,400
If you were a kid that like went to preschool or something like that, you probably already

1400
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:51,320
have had this and you probably, you won't catch it again.

1401
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:55,000
So yeah, when you, there's like, for the most part, when kids have this, they don't even

1402
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,520
develop the blisters.

1403
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:58,240
They'll run a fever and have a sore throat.

1404
01:16:58,240 --> 01:16:59,240
Yeah.

1405
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:02,460
Um, shadow next gen says, YouTube also has a policy where you can't monetize videos for

1406
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:04,100
content you don't own.

1407
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:07,880
So this whole thing is a bit confusing to me as to how it was allowed to happen in the

1408
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:08,880
first place.

1409
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:14,180
That's a comment from live.vognetwork.com and clerical error 404 follows this up with,

1410
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:17,540
it's been about 15 years since I heard a Lorena Bobbitt reference.

1411
01:17:17,540 --> 01:17:18,540
You're welcome.

1412
01:17:18,540 --> 01:17:22,020
Keeping it, keeping it classy and old school here at OLR.

1413
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:23,420
That's way too long.

1414
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:25,180
Well, here's the thing.

1415
01:17:25,180 --> 01:17:30,700
I think that the whole YouTube policy originally was just to prevent people from, okay, some

1416
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:36,500
dude makes a video and then I copy said video, put it up on my channel and monetize it.

1417
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:41,900
Here's me humming along to, uh, this new movie that's out in theaters.

1418
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:52,900
Um, uh, man of steel, uh, in me and it's my, my little, you know, that would be very bad.

1419
01:17:52,900 --> 01:18:00,380
I think, but anyway, I paid good money for this hue card and I own all the data on it.

1420
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:06,700
I paid an entire $5 from the garage sale for this hue card.

1421
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:07,700
I own it.

1422
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:08,700
All right.

1423
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:10,900
Dark soccer is clearly stepping into a time portal over there.

1424
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:11,900
So you know what that means?

1425
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:16,540
It's time for the classic game of the week.

1426
01:18:16,540 --> 01:18:21,180
Every week, dark soccer goes into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, Hey,

1427
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:28,220
you kids and your YouTubing and making careers off of Mario, you, you know what you need

1428
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:29,820
to go back to my day.

1429
01:18:30,260 --> 01:18:35,260
We used to pay $400 for a fricking Neo Geo game and we liked it.

1430
01:18:35,260 --> 01:18:37,940
And really weird games were really cool.

1431
01:18:37,940 --> 01:18:38,940
Yeah.

1432
01:18:38,940 --> 01:18:40,420
Well really weird games are kind of still cool.

1433
01:18:40,420 --> 01:18:41,420
Let's be real.

1434
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:42,420
All right.

1435
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:43,420
But this one was weird.

1436
01:18:43,420 --> 01:18:44,420
This one was weird and it's not Neo Geo.

1437
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:45,420
It's a little newer than that.

1438
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:46,420
Dark soccer.

1439
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:47,420
What is the classic game of the week?

1440
01:18:47,420 --> 01:18:49,620
The classic game of the week is Mr. Mosquito.

1441
01:18:49,620 --> 01:18:50,620
It's weird.

1442
01:18:50,620 --> 01:18:55,180
I figured to go for a PS2 era, you know, finally moving up a little bit.

1443
01:18:55,180 --> 01:18:58,740
Mr. Mosquito was, it's Rina's room again.

1444
01:18:58,740 --> 01:18:59,740
Oops.

1445
01:18:59,740 --> 01:19:00,740
You need to skip up slides.

1446
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:01,740
Go ahead.

1447
01:19:01,740 --> 01:19:02,740
Oh, okay.

1448
01:19:02,740 --> 01:19:08,100
Mr. Mosquito, which was actually spelled M-O-S-K-E-E-T-O in the PAL regions.

1449
01:19:08,100 --> 01:19:15,020
It also is known as KA in Japan, which just means mosquito, was put out by, well developed

1450
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:17,780
by Zoom Inc for the PS2.

1451
01:19:17,780 --> 01:19:23,740
And it was released in Japan on June 21st, 2001 and the following March in everywhere

1452
01:19:23,740 --> 01:19:24,740
else.

1453
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:28,100
And it was distributed by Eidos.

1454
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:36,020
Basically, you play as a mosquito who has taken a residence in the Yamada family's house.

1455
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:43,140
And it's, I wonder if they were voiced by the Japanese voice actors because the accents

1456
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:44,140
are really thick.

1457
01:19:44,140 --> 01:19:46,820
I mean, they're legit accents too.

1458
01:19:46,820 --> 01:19:53,220
So anyway, you have to stock up on enough blood in the summer so that you will survive

1459
01:19:53,220 --> 01:19:55,860
through the winter ahead, which is funny because like don't mosquitoes only live for

1460
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:57,500
like a week.

1461
01:19:57,500 --> 01:20:04,620
Anyway, so you have, you can collect these spheres to save extra blood and you have to

1462
01:20:04,620 --> 01:20:09,220
suck the blood from them while they're going about their everyday business, but you can

1463
01:20:09,220 --> 01:20:12,420
only get it from certain body parts at certain times.

1464
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:17,580
Like this scene here with the girl on her bed, you can only suck it from like her upper

1465
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:18,580
thigh.

1466
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:20,420
He's getting a little close to the no-no spot.

1467
01:20:20,420 --> 01:20:23,460
So this is a little bit of a scandalous game.

1468
01:20:23,460 --> 01:20:26,860
He's actually close to the femoral artery.

1469
01:20:26,860 --> 01:20:33,220
Anyway, if he is swatted while sucking, then instant death occurs.

1470
01:20:33,220 --> 01:20:39,620
Basically, you have a stress meter, so you have to balance your suck with your stress.

1471
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:41,940
Don't we all?

1472
01:20:41,940 --> 01:20:47,340
And then to calm them, basically they will try to battle you too, like a big boss battle,

1473
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:52,220
like what we're watching right now in this video, where you have stress points that you

1474
01:20:52,220 --> 01:20:59,100
have to, I guess, sting them on or bite them on that are meant to calm them.

1475
01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:04,140
So it's like you're doing acupressure on them.

1476
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:05,700
You're doing mosquito shiatsu.

1477
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:07,340
There you go.

1478
01:21:07,340 --> 01:21:09,340
You can get smacked all over the room and it's really hilarious.

1479
01:21:09,340 --> 01:21:10,900
So you have different stages.

1480
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:16,220
You can go through different parts of the house and you have different items, different

1481
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:19,100
things to help you.

1482
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:27,060
The fun thing about this game too is that your ending depends on how much sucking you did,

1483
01:21:27,060 --> 01:21:32,380
like how successful you were, because for the Yamada family, they're going to have their

1484
01:21:32,380 --> 01:21:35,220
family portrait taken at the end of the summer.

1485
01:21:35,220 --> 01:21:40,020
And it's like if you completed all the missions and everything, they're all puffed up and

1486
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:43,020
swollen all over their faces and the picture is horrible.

1487
01:21:43,020 --> 01:21:44,740
And it's really funny.

1488
01:21:44,740 --> 01:21:49,140
The voice acting is actually super hilarious too.

1489
01:21:49,140 --> 01:21:54,220
As for the game, it was voted one of the top 10 weirdest games of all time in 2008 by Game

1490
01:21:54,220 --> 01:22:03,940
Informer and G4 put it on its list of weird games.

1491
01:22:03,940 --> 01:22:09,300
It was really weird, but Famitsu said it was the fifth best selling video game in Japan

1492
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:11,100
during its release.

1493
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:19,660
It sold 41,006 copies and it also got a release on PlayStation 2 the best.

1494
01:22:19,660 --> 01:22:25,740
And it led to a sequel in Japan on July 3rd, 2003 called KA 2 Let's Go Hawaii.

1495
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:29,900
And that came out only, of course, like I said, in Japan and it's the Yamada family

1496
01:22:29,900 --> 01:22:33,540
again and they're going on vacation, has like new stuff going on.

1497
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:38,780
I kind of want the sequel just because it like has extra stuff going on and you can

1498
01:22:38,780 --> 01:22:40,940
suck anywhere on them.

1499
01:22:40,940 --> 01:22:44,300
And a different relaxation system, so I think it would be fun.

1500
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:47,140
But this game was just wrong and like you could do other stuff too.

1501
01:22:47,140 --> 01:22:50,620
Like you could distract the people in the room by like turning off the light switch

1502
01:22:50,620 --> 01:22:53,260
or changing the music or doing all this other stuff.

1503
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:55,500
It's just bizarre, but it works.

1504
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:58,940
It's a very strange game, but it's awesome.

1505
01:22:58,940 --> 01:23:01,420
Like it's you just you have to see it.

1506
01:23:01,420 --> 01:23:05,020
And like this week I wanted to pick games that were along the same vein of Incredible

1507
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:07,660
Crisis because that game was fucked up.

1508
01:23:07,660 --> 01:23:12,580
And this game, I'd have to put it's fucked up in this level somewhere near Incredible

1509
01:23:12,580 --> 01:23:13,580
Crisis.

1510
01:23:13,580 --> 01:23:14,580
So.

1511
01:23:14,580 --> 01:23:15,580
All right.

1512
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:16,580
KA.

1513
01:23:16,580 --> 01:23:17,580
There it is.

1514
01:23:17,580 --> 01:23:18,580
Your classic game of the week.

1515
01:23:18,580 --> 01:23:20,460
Mr. Mosquito on the PlayStation 2.

1516
01:23:20,460 --> 01:23:21,460
KA.

1517
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:22,780
All right.

1518
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:24,160
Very good pick tonight.

1519
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:25,160
A little bit edumacational.

1520
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:26,160
I know.

1521
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:27,160
All right.

1522
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:28,160
Don't go anywhere, guys.

1523
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:30,940
We've got plenty more OLR to come tonight with more Slidekick.

1524
01:23:30,940 --> 01:23:33,140
The Frugal Question of the Week coming at you.

1525
01:23:33,140 --> 01:23:36,060
We're going to talk a little bit about Ouya and the Frugal Question of the Week as well

1526
01:23:36,060 --> 01:23:37,420
as some news.

1527
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:41,260
And also we'll talk about the upcoming Moli Jam.

1528
01:23:41,260 --> 01:23:42,260
That's always hilarious.

1529
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:44,380
So we're going to talk about that.

1530
01:23:44,380 --> 01:23:47,740
All that and more including your phone calls, the FUs of the Week, Twitter topics and all

1531
01:23:47,740 --> 01:23:51,540
that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1532
01:23:51,540 --> 01:23:52,540
Hola.

1533
01:23:52,540 --> 01:23:59,140
This is your friendly neighborhood Mexican actor.

1534
01:23:59,140 --> 01:24:10,780
And you're participating with Orange Lounge Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.

1535
01:24:10,780 --> 01:24:14,540
And I want to use my voice to tell you that Kirby does not suck.

1536
01:24:14,540 --> 01:24:19,740
Well, literally he does suck, but not fear of the people.

1537
01:24:19,740 --> 01:24:22,780
Anyways, play more Kirby.

1538
01:24:22,780 --> 01:24:23,780
Play more Kirby.

1539
01:24:23,780 --> 01:24:24,780
Do it now.

1540
01:24:24,780 --> 01:24:25,780
Well, not now.

1541
01:24:25,780 --> 01:24:26,780
Because you're trying to listen to OLR, but.

1542
01:24:26,780 --> 01:24:27,780
Poor guy, man.

1543
01:24:27,780 --> 01:24:36,540
I know we're here pitching.

1544
01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:37,540
That's like tomorrow, though.

1545
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:38,540
By the way.

1546
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:40,540
I did look up Phoenix.

1547
01:24:40,540 --> 01:24:43,540
Phoenix is at one hundred and sixteen.

1548
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:44,540
On fire.

1549
01:24:44,540 --> 01:24:45,860
What about needles in Death Valley?

1550
01:24:45,860 --> 01:24:51,300
That's always the place to look at just like a hundred and twenty two.

1551
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:53,620
Anyhow, that was a repeat bumper there.

1552
01:24:53,620 --> 01:24:54,980
That means we need more bumpers.

1553
01:24:54,980 --> 01:24:58,960
I mean, I'm sure Act Deft is happy to have his voice played on the show all the time,

1554
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:01,380
as well as some of our other repeats we'll get into.

1555
01:25:01,380 --> 01:25:06,100
But Orange Lounge Radio, the place where Act Deft has a voice.

1556
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:10,180
If you want to get your voice heard, go over to our forums at Vogue Network dot com, click

1557
01:25:10,180 --> 01:25:12,220
on forums and check out the Orange Lounge Radio forum.

1558
01:25:12,220 --> 01:25:14,460
The call for bumpers is there.

1559
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:15,460
And it's very easy.

1560
01:25:15,460 --> 01:25:18,180
You can even Skype them in if you don't know it, like don't you don't have to put the music

1561
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:19,180
together or anything like that.

1562
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:21,820
All you got to do is give me give me your voice.

1563
01:25:21,820 --> 01:25:23,540
I'm like Ursula on The Little Mermaid.

1564
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:24,700
That's all I want is your voice.

1565
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:26,260
And Rob's going to put it to Eurobeat.

1566
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:27,260
That's right.

1567
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:28,980
I may put the next one to Eurobeat.

1568
01:25:28,980 --> 01:25:29,980
Be careful.

1569
01:25:29,980 --> 01:25:30,980
All right.

1570
01:25:30,980 --> 01:25:31,980
That would be awesome.

1571
01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:36,860
So before we get back into gaming news and rapid fire news, Slidekick, I realize there

1572
01:25:36,860 --> 01:25:40,460
was one game neither one of us brought up in our gaming weeks this week.

1573
01:25:40,460 --> 01:25:43,460
But before the show tonight, we played Press Your Luck.

1574
01:25:43,460 --> 01:25:44,460
We did.

1575
01:25:44,460 --> 01:25:45,460
We did.

1576
01:25:45,460 --> 01:25:50,220
And you sure love to rub it in how good a game show video games you are, huh?

1577
01:25:50,220 --> 01:25:52,940
I guess I just have a natural talent.

1578
01:25:52,980 --> 01:25:55,060
Do you practice Wheel of Fortune a lot as a kid?

1579
01:25:55,060 --> 01:25:56,060
No.

1580
01:25:56,060 --> 01:25:57,980
Well, I played a lot of Wheel of Fortune as a kid, but I mean.

1581
01:25:57,980 --> 01:25:58,980
Five thousand pass.

1582
01:25:58,980 --> 01:26:01,220
We've had a Wheel of Fortune winner on the show.

1583
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:02,220
Yes, I know.

1584
01:26:02,220 --> 01:26:03,220
Yes.

1585
01:26:03,220 --> 01:26:05,140
I kind of think I need to actually go on Wheel of Fortune.

1586
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:09,020
Our buddy Mel, who needs to come back to the show, by the way, actually won a car on Wheel

1587
01:26:09,020 --> 01:26:10,020
of Fortune like years.

1588
01:26:10,020 --> 01:26:11,020
It was during.

1589
01:26:11,020 --> 01:26:12,020
Wow.

1590
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:13,020
His price is right.

1591
01:26:13,020 --> 01:26:14,020
No, it was on Wheel of Fortune.

1592
01:26:14,020 --> 01:26:15,020
It was on Wheel of Fortune.

1593
01:26:15,020 --> 01:26:16,020
Because he even put up the clip of him winning.

1594
01:26:16,020 --> 01:26:17,020
Yeah.

1595
01:26:17,020 --> 01:26:21,180
His Facebook cover photo is him solving the pumpkin pie or whatever his final thing was.

1596
01:26:21,180 --> 01:26:24,300
And I have been in that Camaro and it was a bitchin' Camaro.

1597
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:26,860
I have a coworker that won a car on Price is Right.

1598
01:26:26,860 --> 01:26:27,860
Really?

1599
01:26:27,860 --> 01:26:28,860
Yeah.

1600
01:26:28,860 --> 01:26:29,860
He won the car and like a China cabinet.

1601
01:26:29,860 --> 01:26:30,860
Lord.

1602
01:26:30,860 --> 01:26:33,420
And the sucky thing they never tell you about winning prizes like that is that you have

1603
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:34,420
to pay taxes.

1604
01:26:34,420 --> 01:26:35,940
All these game show winners.

1605
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:38,420
Oh, Alan's here to lend his commentary.

1606
01:26:38,420 --> 01:26:39,740
Yes, Alan.

1607
01:26:39,740 --> 01:26:41,620
Talking about Price is Right, just remind me of something.

1608
01:26:41,620 --> 01:26:43,980
There's going to be an all Plinko episode in September.

1609
01:26:43,980 --> 01:26:44,980
What?

1610
01:26:44,980 --> 01:26:45,980
Yeah.

1611
01:26:45,980 --> 01:26:46,980
All Plinko.

1612
01:26:46,980 --> 01:26:47,980
August or September.

1613
01:26:47,980 --> 01:26:48,980
Google it.

1614
01:26:48,980 --> 01:26:49,980
If I'm working, I'm just going to quit and watch.

1615
01:26:50,980 --> 01:26:51,980
Viewing party.

1616
01:26:51,980 --> 01:26:52,980
Kidding.

1617
01:26:52,980 --> 01:26:53,980
Kidding.

1618
01:26:53,980 --> 01:26:57,540
I've never heard of a better reason to quit your job.

1619
01:26:57,540 --> 01:27:01,860
And you get Plinko and you get Plinko and you get Plinko for everyone.

1620
01:27:01,860 --> 01:27:05,740
I'm surprised it's taken them 35 years or something to think about Plinko.

1621
01:27:05,740 --> 01:27:06,740
If they want.

1622
01:27:06,740 --> 01:27:13,340
See, PopCap telling you if you're smart, you market that son of a bitch on that show right

1623
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:14,340
there.

1624
01:27:14,340 --> 01:27:15,340
Right?

1625
01:27:15,340 --> 01:27:16,340
Pagle 2.

1626
01:27:16,340 --> 01:27:17,340
Plinko.

1627
01:27:17,340 --> 01:27:19,340
Robby, we're getting a little pressed during Press Your Luck, weren't you?

1628
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:22,060
Well, I was getting very pressed during Press Your Luck.

1629
01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:23,060
How many whammies did you have?

1630
01:27:23,060 --> 01:27:28,540
I had three whammies in the first round and fucking, okay, so like I actually uploaded

1631
01:27:28,540 --> 01:27:32,860
to my Twitter, twitter.com slash SKIE, that's Sky, twitter.com slash Sky.

1632
01:27:32,860 --> 01:27:37,860
I've always liked more followers, but I actually posted a picture of this like slidekick.

1633
01:27:37,860 --> 01:27:42,060
I hate you so much because like it's me and I have three whammies and no money and he

1634
01:27:42,060 --> 01:27:43,060
has like no whammies.

1635
01:27:43,060 --> 01:27:44,060
He has like $7,000.

1636
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:47,140
And I ended up with like over $50,000.

1637
01:27:47,140 --> 01:27:50,860
Were you like the unemployed man who memorized the patterns and just sat and watched it?

1638
01:27:50,860 --> 01:27:51,860
Yes, he was.

1639
01:27:51,860 --> 01:27:52,860
No, I just got lucky.

1640
01:27:52,860 --> 01:27:53,860
You know what happened to that guy, by the way?

1641
01:27:53,860 --> 01:27:54,860
He died.

1642
01:27:54,860 --> 01:27:55,860
No, besides that.

1643
01:27:55,860 --> 01:27:56,860
What?

1644
01:27:56,860 --> 01:27:58,940
He ended up in, he went on all the trips and everything and ended up investing the money

1645
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:02,940
in like the scheme and he lost all of it.

1646
01:28:02,940 --> 01:28:03,940
Oh, poor guy.

1647
01:28:03,940 --> 01:28:06,740
If you come into money, be smart.

1648
01:28:06,740 --> 01:28:08,900
You know, you can have one of my two trips to Rio, Rob.

1649
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:09,900
It's okay.

1650
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:10,900
Shut up.

1651
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:11,900
It wasn't real.

1652
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:15,060
It wasn't real as the lengthy disclaimer when you boot up the game lets you know that the

1653
01:28:15,060 --> 01:28:16,300
prizes are not real.

1654
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:18,140
It's not a contest.

1655
01:28:18,140 --> 01:28:22,820
If I can make money winning game show video games, I just quit my job and do that in a

1656
01:28:22,820 --> 01:28:23,820
let's plays.

1657
01:28:23,820 --> 01:28:25,940
You know what would be the best job ever?

1658
01:28:25,940 --> 01:28:26,940
You should be a sweeper.

1659
01:28:26,940 --> 01:28:31,180
You'd be one of those soccer moms that does nothing but enter sweepstakes for a living.

1660
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:32,180
Oh, it's my dream.

1661
01:28:32,180 --> 01:28:33,180
Basically.

1662
01:28:33,180 --> 01:28:34,180
I'm kind of surprised.

1663
01:28:34,180 --> 01:28:35,180
Alan's really into couponing.

1664
01:28:35,180 --> 01:28:37,540
Alan, why aren't you into sweeping?

1665
01:28:37,540 --> 01:28:40,580
That should be your next hobby.

1666
01:28:40,580 --> 01:28:41,580
It says I'm not a 1950.

1667
01:28:41,740 --> 01:28:44,740
We can get you a string of pearls and an apron.

1668
01:28:44,740 --> 01:28:45,740
Okay.

1669
01:28:45,740 --> 01:28:46,740
That's a little bit awkward.

1670
01:28:46,740 --> 01:28:47,740
All right.

1671
01:28:47,740 --> 01:28:48,740
What were you going to say?

1672
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:49,740
They're sorry.

1673
01:28:49,740 --> 01:28:50,740
I forgot.

1674
01:28:50,740 --> 01:28:51,740
Really cut you off.

1675
01:28:51,740 --> 01:28:52,740
I forgot.

1676
01:28:52,740 --> 01:28:53,740
It's for the best.

1677
01:28:53,740 --> 01:28:54,740
All right.

1678
01:28:54,740 --> 01:28:55,740
No whammies.

1679
01:28:55,740 --> 01:28:56,740
Stop.

1680
01:28:56,740 --> 01:29:01,660
Uh, dark Tetsuya says, I was just going to ask, are the patterns in the video game version

1681
01:29:01,660 --> 01:29:02,860
like the old game show?

1682
01:29:02,860 --> 01:29:03,860
No.

1683
01:29:03,860 --> 01:29:04,860
And they're a lot more randomized.

1684
01:29:04,860 --> 01:29:05,860
I highly doubt.

1685
01:29:05,860 --> 01:29:07,440
Slidekick had the time to memorize them.

1686
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:11,100
It's if you hit X as fast as you can, you seem to never hit a whammy and slidekick figure

1687
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:12,780
that out in about five seconds.

1688
01:29:12,780 --> 01:29:19,940
Well, one thing, one thing to is that after this guy basically broke the system, earning

1689
01:29:19,940 --> 01:29:24,180
all that money, um, they changed the patterns and added an extra randomizer.

1690
01:29:24,180 --> 01:29:26,060
So, Oh yeah.

1691
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:27,340
He made them change the game show.

1692
01:29:27,340 --> 01:29:28,340
Yeah.

1693
01:29:28,340 --> 01:29:33,880
And basically they couldn't actually call him out on cheating because he did what anyone

1694
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:34,880
could do.

1695
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:35,880
Yeah, no, he didn't cheat.

1696
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:39,020
They just told him he's not allowed to play again.

1697
01:29:39,940 --> 01:29:41,980
Uh, I w I, it's not my fault.

1698
01:29:41,980 --> 01:29:44,820
Slidekick was just pushing X as fast as he could and winning everything, but I was trying

1699
01:29:44,820 --> 01:29:45,820
to get all into it.

1700
01:29:45,820 --> 01:29:47,380
I was like, no whammies.

1701
01:29:47,380 --> 01:29:50,220
Don't you fucking give me a whammy because you know, I can swear in my own house.

1702
01:29:50,220 --> 01:29:52,660
Don't you fucking give me a whammy or I'm going to come back there and cut the power

1703
01:29:52,660 --> 01:29:53,660
cord.

1704
01:29:53,660 --> 01:29:54,660
You piece of shit.

1705
01:29:54,660 --> 01:29:55,660
No whammies.

1706
01:29:55,660 --> 01:29:56,660
Stop.

1707
01:29:56,660 --> 01:29:57,660
And then I did a whammy.

1708
01:29:57,660 --> 01:29:59,980
I'm going to take all your money.

1709
01:29:59,980 --> 01:30:03,880
At least it was 80s style pressure luck and not that shitty game show.

1710
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:06,620
Like an uncensored game show on TV.

1711
01:30:06,620 --> 01:30:10,460
Not necessarily that they have to have all the TNA and stuff, but like I'm just saying,

1712
01:30:10,460 --> 01:30:13,300
you know, we're just like, fuck, God damn it.

1713
01:30:13,300 --> 01:30:15,960
You know, why did I say that?

1714
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:17,780
That's like the wrong answer completely.

1715
01:30:17,780 --> 01:30:20,020
You know, this is motherfucking jeopardy.

1716
01:30:20,020 --> 01:30:25,340
And then you can also get like bonus points based on how well you're judged.

1717
01:30:25,340 --> 01:30:30,260
We're all the, we're all the, uh, trivia answers have to start with what the fuck, what the

1718
01:30:30,260 --> 01:30:33,740
fuck is, I don't care, Alex.

1719
01:30:33,740 --> 01:30:35,360
That makes me think of the price is right.

1720
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:39,580
Where you, you're the really hard ones where you have to step on the floor to step out

1721
01:30:39,580 --> 01:30:40,580
the price of the car.

1722
01:30:40,580 --> 01:30:43,940
They always looked at their family members and they can just be like, I fucking hate

1723
01:30:43,940 --> 01:30:44,940
my family.

1724
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:45,940
You're all fucking walking home.

1725
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:46,940
Fuck you.

1726
01:30:46,940 --> 01:30:48,620
And like Drew Carey's all really uncomfortable.

1727
01:30:48,620 --> 01:30:50,500
Oh God.

1728
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:52,620
All right.

1729
01:30:52,620 --> 01:30:55,140
Uh, moving on.

1730
01:30:55,140 --> 01:30:56,540
We're talking too long about game shows.

1731
01:30:56,540 --> 01:30:57,540
Actually.

1732
01:30:57,540 --> 01:30:58,540
You can never talk too long about game shows.

1733
01:30:58,540 --> 01:30:59,540
Okay.

1734
01:30:59,540 --> 01:31:02,420
Is that the pressure like game that I got you like ages ago?

1735
01:31:02,420 --> 01:31:03,420
The DVD game.

1736
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:04,420
We'll have that.

1737
01:31:04,420 --> 01:31:09,180
Uh, I was going to say, I've talked about before how badly I need to go on a reality

1738
01:31:09,180 --> 01:31:14,820
game show and I don't think I could do survivor because if I didn't eat for 13 days, I would

1739
01:31:14,820 --> 01:31:15,940
be the biggest bitch.

1740
01:31:15,940 --> 01:31:17,260
I get voted out so fast.

1741
01:31:17,260 --> 01:31:19,540
If I didn't eat for one day, I'd be a bitch.

1742
01:31:19,540 --> 01:31:20,540
Let's be real.

1743
01:31:20,540 --> 01:31:21,900
I can't go on big brother.

1744
01:31:21,900 --> 01:31:24,380
No, you would be a big bitch if you didn't have Pinkberry near you.

1745
01:31:24,380 --> 01:31:27,700
I can't go on big brother anymore because I don't know if y'all are following this season,

1746
01:31:27,700 --> 01:31:29,380
but what a bunch of racists.

1747
01:31:29,380 --> 01:31:32,100
I mean, it's pretty sick in that house right now.

1748
01:31:32,300 --> 01:31:36,100
Paula Deen ain't got nothing on some of those people in the big brother house this season.

1749
01:31:36,100 --> 01:31:42,300
Uh, and then, um, so I was going to say there's a new show on ABC that's pretty fucking hilarious.

1750
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:47,940
It's called who done it and it's like, it's like clue meets the mole, which by the way,

1751
01:31:47,940 --> 01:31:50,940
I know a lot of you judge reality TV shows and that's fine.

1752
01:31:50,940 --> 01:31:56,300
A lot of it needs to be judged, but the mole was the best reality game show they ever had.

1753
01:31:56,300 --> 01:31:59,340
I'm like, if you're going to try any reality TV, do the mole.

1754
01:31:59,340 --> 01:32:02,660
So somebody decided to adapt the mole into like a clue game called who done it.

1755
01:32:02,660 --> 01:32:08,300
But here's the great part is that at the end of the episode, whoever scored the lowest

1756
01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:11,100
on the quiz dies.

1757
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:13,300
They become the victim in the next episode.

1758
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:16,740
So the episode literally like the first episode aired, right?

1759
01:32:16,740 --> 01:32:20,860
And so the guy who lost and didn't get the case right and got the lowest on the quiz,

1760
01:32:20,860 --> 01:32:24,980
he runs out at the very end, somebody set him on fire and he falls into the pool dead

1761
01:32:24,980 --> 01:32:28,940
and he's all like, like it's, it's like, obviously it's all fake, it's makeup and all that stuff,

1762
01:32:28,940 --> 01:32:32,220
but all these people on Twitter were like, did they start killing people on TV?

1763
01:32:32,220 --> 01:32:33,220
What the fuck?

1764
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:34,220
Ratings.

1765
01:32:34,220 --> 01:32:35,220
Oh my God.

1766
01:32:35,220 --> 01:32:36,220
Right.

1767
01:32:36,220 --> 01:32:40,440
But I was like, dude, he lost this game and he literally had to die in a fire.

1768
01:32:40,440 --> 01:32:42,260
That is amazing.

1769
01:32:42,260 --> 01:32:43,380
Like the dark soccer, right?

1770
01:32:43,380 --> 01:32:47,340
This game is the closest we're going to get to battle royale.

1771
01:32:47,340 --> 01:32:49,780
Happy hunger games.

1772
01:32:49,780 --> 01:32:52,660
They're supposed to be a hunger games game show on CW this year.

1773
01:32:52,660 --> 01:32:58,380
Yes, but it's not, it's not hunger games, but it's so fucking obviously a thirsty rip

1774
01:32:58,380 --> 01:32:59,580
off of the hunger games.

1775
01:32:59,580 --> 01:33:02,240
It's like, wait, let me your book.

1776
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:03,240
What the hunger games?

1777
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:06,540
It's on his Kindle.

1778
01:33:06,540 --> 01:33:10,060
This is why I hate Kindle shit.

1779
01:33:10,060 --> 01:33:11,060
All right.

1780
01:33:11,060 --> 01:33:18,540
There's a thing called the internet where it's probably there.

1781
01:33:18,540 --> 01:33:21,920
I like books where I can smell paper and ink.

1782
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:22,920
What is the name?

1783
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:23,920
And cry.

1784
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:25,580
Somebody in chat has to know this show I'm talking about.

1785
01:33:25,580 --> 01:33:26,780
It's on the CW.

1786
01:33:26,780 --> 01:33:31,080
It's um, cause you know, the CW doesn't have anything except the whose line is it anyway?

1787
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:33,620
Reboot starts on a couple of weeks.

1788
01:33:33,620 --> 01:33:34,620
Really soon.

1789
01:33:34,620 --> 01:33:35,620
I'll have to watch that.

1790
01:33:35,620 --> 01:33:40,820
And it has the lady who just Googled CW, a hunger game show.

1791
01:33:40,820 --> 01:33:41,820
It's called the hunt.

1792
01:33:41,820 --> 01:33:42,820
The hunt.

1793
01:33:42,820 --> 01:33:46,940
It's not the hunger games, the hunt.

1794
01:33:46,940 --> 01:33:47,940
It's just like it though.

1795
01:33:47,940 --> 01:33:50,320
I'll tell you the 10 years from now, battle royale.

1796
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:54,960
The one I can't wait for on ABC is called the quest, which is supposed to be the amazing

1797
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:57,320
race meets a LARP.

1798
01:33:57,320 --> 01:33:58,320
Oh my God.

1799
01:33:58,320 --> 01:33:59,320
That sounds awesome.

1800
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:00,320
I would watch that one.

1801
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:02,480
I was like, how do I get cast for this show?

1802
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:04,800
Because I want to fuck, like I would want to fucking go on the quest.

1803
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:05,800
It's like a LARP.

1804
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:06,800
LARPers of the world unite.

1805
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:07,800
It'd be amazing.

1806
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:09,800
Anyway, it's like the producer.

1807
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:10,800
I am.

1808
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:12,440
I was a proud former LARPer.

1809
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:13,440
It's the amazing.

1810
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:15,760
Well, I did Rocky or a picture show, which is really close.

1811
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:16,760
Okay.

1812
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:21,080
It's, it's the amazing race producers and the Lord of the rings producers or something

1813
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:22,080
like that.

1814
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:26,240
It's when you go to a live action vampire game and you see the people actually rigged

1815
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:28,840
up with the fake blood and everything, spraying it everywhere.

1816
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:29,840
That's awesome.

1817
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:33,160
I've seen the people throw the magic bags, the little bags that are supposed to be like,

1818
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:34,160
I'm throwing.

1819
01:34:34,160 --> 01:34:35,160
I see you.

1820
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:38,400
You can't see me.

1821
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:39,400
Oh my God.

1822
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:40,400
Oh my God.

1823
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:42,720
We need to have an OL LARP.

1824
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:43,720
No.

1825
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:47,200
And for, for anyone who would pay money to charity, of course, a charity.

1826
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:50,000
If we did an OL LARP, who would pay money?

1827
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,000
I would.

1828
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:57,040
For the record, what I did to Rob was I did the obfuscate thing, which is also stolen

1829
01:34:57,040 --> 01:34:58,040
by John Cena.

1830
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:02,760
If you watch wrestling, wrestling reference, Bobby, ah, anyway, but he does the waving

1831
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:06,080
his hand in his face and it's the, you can't see where I am type thing.

1832
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:10,400
You know, Melody was just asking me how she could raise money for her team and training

1833
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:11,920
thing that she's doing.

1834
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:14,160
I will flarp OL LARP.

1835
01:35:14,160 --> 01:35:15,160
I love it.

1836
01:35:15,160 --> 01:35:16,160
Loki.

1837
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:17,160
Are you going to do it?

1838
01:35:17,160 --> 01:35:18,160
Come on.

1839
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:19,160
Sounds so ridiculous.

1840
01:35:19,160 --> 01:35:24,440
I'm so fucking excited.

1841
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:26,720
All right, let's move on.

1842
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:27,720
And Rob, what?

1843
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:29,120
Here, here's the rule.

1844
01:35:29,120 --> 01:35:30,120
Okay.

1845
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:31,120
Here's the rule.

1846
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:33,520
We each pick a video game character and we have to cosplay.

1847
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:34,520
Nope.

1848
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:35,520
Nope.

1849
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:36,520
Nope.

1850
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:37,520
Nope.

1851
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:38,520
You don't have to do tingling.

1852
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:39,520
Nope.

1853
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:40,520
You can do your sack boy.

1854
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:41,520
You should walk around and sass sack boy.

1855
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:42,520
Yeah.

1856
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:43,520
Yeah.

1857
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:48,400
We have to, we have to go out to Vacaville in the nut tree.

1858
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:51,800
Play in the 112 degree.

1859
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:57,040
No, for the, for the, for anyone who doesn't know he's on the ground, he's not moving behind

1860
01:35:57,040 --> 01:36:00,680
the nut tree is where the old Ren fairgrounds used to be.

1861
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:01,680
That would be perfect.

1862
01:36:01,680 --> 01:36:05,620
You know where we used to do LARP, Rob, we used to do it in the courtyard at my college

1863
01:36:05,620 --> 01:36:07,800
of the university of South Alabama.

1864
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:11,040
And because that's the only thing there is to do that's exciting in Alabama, it's still

1865
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:12,040
going on.

1866
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:13,040
Probably.

1867
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:15,860
Act Def wants to know what does the F in flarp stand for?

1868
01:36:15,860 --> 01:36:17,820
You only know if you, if you like homestuck.

1869
01:36:17,820 --> 01:36:19,180
Oh God.

1870
01:36:19,180 --> 01:36:20,900
All right.

1871
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:23,740
And of course, Raginator says, uh, Loki should LARP is tingle.

1872
01:36:23,740 --> 01:36:24,740
All right.

1873
01:36:24,740 --> 01:36:25,740
He won't.

1874
01:36:25,740 --> 01:36:26,740
All right.

1875
01:36:26,740 --> 01:36:27,740
Let's do some rapid fire news.

1876
01:36:27,740 --> 01:36:31,220
Cause we're 12 minutes into part B and haven't even touched rapid fire news yet.

1877
01:36:31,220 --> 01:36:32,220
They would slide kick.

1878
01:36:32,220 --> 01:36:33,220
This is all your fault.

1879
01:36:33,220 --> 01:36:37,420
It would be potentially cooler though than wearing that sack boy costume because that

1880
01:36:37,420 --> 01:36:43,100
day is like two or three layers of sweats in the summer.

1881
01:36:43,100 --> 01:36:44,100
Yeah.

1882
01:36:44,620 --> 01:36:45,620
That'll be fun.

1883
01:36:45,620 --> 01:36:46,620
All right.

1884
01:36:46,620 --> 01:36:51,620
Anyways, so Nordic games, you know, they've been acquiring and acquiring and acquiring,

1885
01:36:51,620 --> 01:36:56,220
you know, they bought up a bunch of the old THQ properties and now they're buying up some

1886
01:36:56,220 --> 01:37:01,860
of Atari's properties, including, uh, Desperados and silver.

1887
01:37:01,860 --> 01:37:08,140
Um, and you may remember Atari, you know, they've been selling off parts of their company.

1888
01:37:08,140 --> 01:37:10,540
So I wonder who's buying Marvin Mettis, seriously.

1889
01:37:10,540 --> 01:37:17,140
Um, and I guess they, um, I'm not sure what they're going to do with it, but you know,

1890
01:37:17,140 --> 01:37:19,500
make some Westerns, I guess.

1891
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:25,420
I don't know, uh, silver I've not really, I'm not familiar with, but I guess that came

1892
01:37:25,420 --> 01:37:31,100
out, uh, was a action RPG in, uh, on the PC and Dreamcast back in 99.

1893
01:37:31,100 --> 01:37:34,060
So huh, interesting.

1894
01:37:34,060 --> 01:37:39,940
Um, Retro City Rampage, the PC version has been adding some new updates, including a

1895
01:37:40,180 --> 01:37:42,260
mod support, which is pretty sweet.

1896
01:37:42,260 --> 01:37:47,060
You can create your own vehicles and characters, fonts, color palettes, et cetera.

1897
01:37:47,060 --> 01:37:53,380
Uh, they have a new retro plus mode, which, uh, adds some more, um, you know, visual effects,

1898
01:37:53,380 --> 01:37:58,820
including soft shadows and doubling the number of colors on screen.

1899
01:37:58,820 --> 01:38:05,820
And um, also, I guess, uh, this is going to be coming, uh, on steam via automatic update

1900
01:38:05,860 --> 01:38:10,860
and then on good old games, uh, you have to log in and just redownload, I guess, grab

1901
01:38:10,860 --> 01:38:12,540
the 1.11 update.

1902
01:38:12,540 --> 01:38:14,920
Uh, so yeah, pretty cool.

1903
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:19,460
And if you don't have this game already, it's most likely going to be on sale pretty soon.

1904
01:38:19,460 --> 01:38:25,620
I mean, it's already pretty treat, or pretty cheap, uh, 374, uh, was the recent cost of

1905
01:38:25,620 --> 01:38:25,740
that.

1906
01:38:25,740 --> 01:38:29,540
So it's probably going to be even cheaper during the steam sale, but it's an awesome

1907
01:38:29,540 --> 01:38:29,900
game.

1908
01:38:29,900 --> 01:38:34,160
So many like retro homages, it's just ridiculous.

1909
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:40,280
And then last but not least, uh, Project Anarchy, a brand new, uh, mobile development

1910
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:42,920
toolkit from Havok.

1911
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:45,060
And uh, did I mention it's free?

1912
01:38:45,060 --> 01:38:49,760
So you'll be able to use it to create some pretty awesome 3D games and freely publish

1913
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:56,760
on Android, iOS, uh, Tizen, I'm not sure what Tizen is, but, um, and I guess it also has

1914
01:38:58,020 --> 01:39:02,080
a provisional license to develop for, but not publish on Windows.

1915
01:39:02,720 --> 01:39:03,640
Okay.

1916
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:10,240
Um, yeah, and I guess it will support, uh, I guess, uh, low level C++ access, Lua, Lua

1917
01:39:10,240 --> 01:39:15,320
scripting, debugging, and, uh, other fun stuff includes tutorials and sample projects as

1918
01:39:15,320 --> 01:39:16,360
well.

1919
01:39:16,360 --> 01:39:21,680
So, uh, if you want to check that out, um, I would imagine you just go to Havok's website

1920
01:39:21,680 --> 01:39:22,200
and it should be there.

1921
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:23,480
What the hell is Tizen though?

1922
01:39:23,480 --> 01:39:25,880
I've never heard of Tizen.

1923
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:35,040
It's like a operating system for some smartphones, tablets, and vehicle infotainment, smart TVs.

1924
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:38,240
Something else to build a console out of.

1925
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:39,440
I guess, yeah.

1926
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:43,820
All right, well, uh, the potentials of this could have been Epic, but, uh, it was unearthed

1927
01:39:43,820 --> 01:39:48,400
an old ad from the Consumer Electronics Show from years ago, uh, was unearthed that showed

1928
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:52,760
a advertisement for Square, you know, before they were Square Enix, uh, promoting upcoming

1929
01:39:52,760 --> 01:39:56,120
Final Fantasy games, which included Final Fantasy II.

1930
01:39:56,120 --> 01:39:59,320
Now I'm not, I'm not talking about the Super Nintendo, I'm talking about the Japanese Final

1931
01:39:59,320 --> 01:39:59,920
Fantasy II.

1932
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:02,600
I'm going to refer to their Japanese numbers in this whole story.

1933
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:05,880
Uh, Final Fantasy II was supposedly going to come out here at one point, but we all

1934
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:06,680
knew that.

1935
01:40:06,680 --> 01:40:10,800
One of those big, like, Lost Levels website or whatever kind of chronicles what happened

1936
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:12,680
with that game and it didn't come out.

1937
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:14,200
But a lot of people didn't know this.

1938
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:18,680
Final Fantasy III was apparently planned at one point, but it clearly didn't get very

1939
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:19,760
far along.

1940
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:25,280
There's even some mock-up box art that shows, um, uh, like the neptodragon possibly there,

1941
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:28,080
some sea monsters clutching wood on a broken ship.

1942
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:31,760
Now obviously we did end up getting Final Fantasy II and III years later.

1943
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:36,720
Uh, Final Fantasy II came in the, um, Origins thing that was on PlayStation.

1944
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:39,560
And Final Fantasy III I don't think could tell the DS game, right?

1945
01:40:39,560 --> 01:40:41,160
I don't think we got it before then.

1946
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:47,360
So, uh, obviously there were translated ROMs and other types of hacks like that, but, uh,

1947
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:52,600
it's, um, interesting to imagine what could have been with Final Fantasy II and III.

1948
01:40:52,600 --> 01:40:54,840
Let's be real, it would have been too hard.

1949
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:58,800
Uh, here's another game that doesn't make any sense, but it sure is a lot of fun.

1950
01:40:58,800 --> 01:40:59,800
Kingdom Hearts.

1951
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:01,420
That's a hilarious face.

1952
01:41:01,420 --> 01:41:05,880
Kingdom Hearts HD, uh, news coming out that the graphics are actually built from the ground

1953
01:41:05,880 --> 01:41:06,880
up.

1954
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:10,040
Uh, some of the original assets from the 11-year-old game were lost.

1955
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:14,360
So the graphics for Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix were recreated from the ground up on

1956
01:41:14,360 --> 01:41:16,440
the PlayStation 3.

1957
01:41:16,440 --> 01:41:20,080
That's really cool because, uh, god, I can't wait to play this game all over again.

1958
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:21,080
It's so pretty.

1959
01:41:21,080 --> 01:41:22,080
Yeah.

1960
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:23,080
I'm just like so excited about this.

1961
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:24,920
So very cool.

1962
01:41:24,920 --> 01:41:28,760
I'm less excited about this, but it's not going to stop me from getting the game.

1963
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:34,080
Uh, Final Fantasy X and X-II HD Remaster, apparently GameStop could be getting some

1964
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:36,520
type of limited edition exclusive or something.

1965
01:41:36,520 --> 01:41:41,320
Uh, there's a flyer out there that was dated June 26th that talked about a free limited

1966
01:41:41,320 --> 01:41:44,880
edition upgrade if you pre-ordered the HD thing.

1967
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:50,720
Uh, however, this is saying this could have been an error on, uh, GameStop's part because

1968
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:55,440
they apparently removed said mention and Square Enix has not said anything about it and it's

1969
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:57,400
not on GameStop.com.

1970
01:41:57,400 --> 01:41:59,560
So don't freak y'all.

1971
01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:05,200
It must be rep- reparations for the whole, uh, Deus Ex issue.

1972
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:06,600
Yeah, that's right.

1973
01:42:06,600 --> 01:42:09,080
That wasn't that long ago, all things considered, huh?

1974
01:42:09,080 --> 01:42:11,080
Uh, anyhow, also, this is cool.

1975
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:14,840
Well, a lot of people don't even realize there was a Game Gear Mega Man game and it

1976
01:42:14,840 --> 01:42:15,840
was out there.

1977
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:17,000
It had some different bosses too.

1978
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,000
I don't recall.

1979
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:21,480
Or was it some of the, the ones from three, it only had like four bosses in it.

1980
01:42:21,480 --> 01:42:25,400
There was a whole series of different, uh, portable Mega Man games.

1981
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:30,640
Like there's the Wonder Swan one and, um, there was one other that I can't remember,

1982
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:32,200
but there was the Game Gear one.

1983
01:42:32,200 --> 01:42:36,520
Well, rumor is that the Game Gear version is on its way to the Nintendo 3DS eShop.

1984
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:39,640
So there's something you might want to get on your new 3DS Dark Sakura.

1985
01:42:39,680 --> 01:42:44,680
Uh, it was developed by Freestyle and published by US Gold in 1995.

1986
01:42:44,680 --> 01:42:47,880
It was parts of four and five, they say mashed together.

1987
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:53,320
Uh, apparently, uh, these carts go for $40 on eBay, but I would imagine this will cost

1988
01:42:53,320 --> 01:42:54,640
what five bucks on the eShops.

1989
01:42:54,640 --> 01:42:56,120
That'll be kind of interesting.

1990
01:42:56,120 --> 01:42:58,640
Well, $40 isn't that much.

1991
01:42:58,640 --> 01:42:59,640
Right.

1992
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:04,120
Especially for a collector's game right now, by the way, all six original NES Mega Man

1993
01:43:04,120 --> 01:43:08,120
games, if you didn't know on the 3DS eShop, I think most of them are on the Wii U as well

1994
01:43:08,120 --> 01:43:09,120
at this point.

1995
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:13,800
So, uh, plenty of places to get your Mega Man fix, just, you know, no new games.

1996
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:16,840
I'm still hoping for Rockman and Bass.

1997
01:43:16,840 --> 01:43:17,840
You never know.

1998
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:18,840
That would be happy.

1999
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:19,840
All right.

2000
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:20,840
Uh, Dark Sakura.

2001
01:43:20,840 --> 01:43:29,360
Well, we do have, um, well, Xbox One, um, as far as headsets, they have to be wired

2002
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:31,520
and they're going to be sold separately.

2003
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:34,160
They're not going to be packed in.

2004
01:43:34,160 --> 01:43:40,120
And, uh, they're basically, uh, saying that, uh, the only thing that you're getting with

2005
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:44,000
it is going to be the Kinect sensor and the microphone in there, but no actual heads up.

2006
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,800
So trying to screw us out of more money, huh?

2007
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:47,800
Yeah.

2008
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:51,720
It was sort of like that though, at the launch with, uh, the Xbox 360, only the premium set

2009
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:53,600
had a headset.

2010
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:59,800
Oh, not, not every, they're, they're basically saying that you can still talk to people,

2011
01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:00,800
but you can't have a headset.

2012
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:05,480
Honestly, I don't like the, you know, standard headsets because I wear headphones.

2013
01:44:05,480 --> 01:44:09,240
So you can't wear two sets of headphones at the same time.

2014
01:44:09,240 --> 01:44:13,760
Well, I've tried, but I actually have, that's how I do it on my headset.

2015
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:19,120
I tape a headset that I ripped apart and I just have the boom part of the microphone

2016
01:44:19,120 --> 01:44:23,400
on there and I tape it to the side of my headphones.

2017
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:24,800
It works just fine.

2018
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:27,480
I guess I could use Kinect, but then I'd be yelling across the room.

2019
01:44:27,480 --> 01:44:28,480
So that would be fun.

2020
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:34,480
Well, in other news, and this has to do with the Wii U, the Super Smash Brothers release

2021
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:37,480
may actually lose some characters.

2022
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:40,880
They're saying that they're working on getting as many characters in it as they can, but

2023
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:44,540
they may not have the full intended roster, although they will have, of course, the Wii

2024
01:44:44,540 --> 01:44:48,560
Fit Trainer fighting you with yoga.

2025
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:49,560
And I love her.

2026
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:54,840
Well, it's just like, if I knew that I could punch somebody with the warrior pose and have

2027
01:44:54,840 --> 01:44:57,240
them go across the room, I'd be doing that more often.

2028
01:44:57,500 --> 01:45:00,760
It's one of those things I never realized how much I loved the idea until it was announced

2029
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:02,360
and I'm like, she should have been a character.

2030
01:45:02,360 --> 01:45:03,360
I love the memes.

2031
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:05,440
Have you seen this already cosplay?

2032
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:06,440
Of the Wii Fit Trainer?

2033
01:45:06,440 --> 01:45:07,440
Of the Wii Fit Trainer.

2034
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:08,440
That's amazing.

2035
01:45:08,440 --> 01:45:12,040
And then, of course, the villager and our Mega Man.

2036
01:45:12,040 --> 01:45:19,080
I almost wonder if we'll see something like, not really like a ultimate Marvel versus Capcom,

2037
01:45:19,080 --> 01:45:22,520
you know, but like a DLC.

2038
01:45:22,520 --> 01:45:23,800
Ultimate Smash.

2039
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:26,360
Ultimate Smash with like new characters or something.

2040
01:45:26,840 --> 01:45:29,800
Well, what they're saying here is that, I mean, the other big reason they may have to

2041
01:45:29,800 --> 01:45:33,520
cut people is time constraints, so they won't be able to bring everyone back.

2042
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:39,080
But I mean, then again, there was like, what, Solid Snake before and Sonic and some Fire

2043
01:45:39,080 --> 01:45:40,560
Emblem characters that no one cared about.

2044
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:41,560
I'm sorry.

2045
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:43,560
That Dan cared about.

2046
01:45:43,560 --> 01:45:44,840
A lot of people care about.

2047
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:49,080
Some people will miss them, but yeah, I think some of those more like, like I bet Captain

2048
01:45:49,080 --> 01:45:50,080
Falcon will be in there.

2049
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:51,920
It was fun to play with Roy and Marth.

2050
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:56,320
Or no, Star Fox will be in there, but like his little buddy, Falco Lombardi won't be

2051
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:57,320
there.

2052
01:45:57,320 --> 01:46:01,600
You know, it'll be the more secondary characters in some of those games, like Lucas from Earthbound.

2053
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:02,600
You mean like the pallets?

2054
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:05,520
I know people who would probably throw a fit if Lucas wasn't in there, though.

2055
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:07,200
I'll throw a fit if Ness isn't there.

2056
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:10,800
Well, you know what, people throw fits for any reason, so, because gamers hate everything.

2057
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:14,800
They may just get rid of like the pallet swap characters, you know, the ones that are basically

2058
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:16,640
the same move set and everything, but it's just a different model.

2059
01:46:16,640 --> 01:46:19,440
As long as Zelda still has the Sheik transformation, I'll be happy.

2060
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:20,440
Oh, I'm sure.

2061
01:46:20,440 --> 01:46:21,440
That's a must.

2062
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:25,040
But they need to give, they need to put Daisy in there and have her have the back of her

2063
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:26,040
head eye laser.

2064
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:29,200
You know about the eyeball in the back of her head, right?

2065
01:46:29,200 --> 01:46:30,200
I heard about that, yeah.

2066
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:34,880
Okay, in the original Smash Brothers, if you look at the Daisy trophy, if you happen to

2067
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:40,640
scroll in super close to the back of her head, there's an eyeball in the back of her head.

2068
01:46:40,640 --> 01:46:44,880
And so now it's like this thing that like, you know what Mugen is, right?

2069
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:47,200
The fighting game creator.

2070
01:46:47,200 --> 01:46:51,640
So for people who put Daisy in Mugen, they actually gave her a back of her head eyeball

2071
01:46:51,640 --> 01:46:52,640
laser.

2072
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:56,880
It's the big, grandiose eyeball.

2073
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:57,880
And I think it's hilarious.

2074
01:46:57,880 --> 01:47:01,680
And people have like tried to see, oh, well, it's not there in Mario Kart.

2075
01:47:01,680 --> 01:47:03,120
It doesn't matter.

2076
01:47:03,120 --> 01:47:05,760
She has a great big eye on the back of her head, like a tumor.

2077
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:06,820
That's why her hair is so big.

2078
01:47:06,820 --> 01:47:08,920
It's full of secrets and eyeballs.

2079
01:47:08,920 --> 01:47:09,920
It's full of secrets.

2080
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:14,080
You know, I'm going to use that for anybody else that, especially when my hair frizzes

2081
01:47:14,080 --> 01:47:15,080
out into fro mode.

2082
01:47:15,080 --> 01:47:17,840
I'm just going to say it's full of secrets.

2083
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:18,840
You can thank Mean Girls.

2084
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:19,840
Okay.

2085
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:22,260
Well, I haven't seen that.

2086
01:47:22,260 --> 01:47:23,260
She should.

2087
01:47:23,260 --> 01:47:24,260
What?

2088
01:47:24,260 --> 01:47:25,260
Doesn't it have Sarah Michelle Gellar in it?

2089
01:47:25,260 --> 01:47:26,260
No.

2090
01:47:26,260 --> 01:47:28,940
It's Lindsay Lohan before she was on all the drugs.

2091
01:47:28,940 --> 01:47:29,940
And Rachel McAdams.

2092
01:47:29,940 --> 01:47:30,940
Is that her name?

2093
01:47:30,940 --> 01:47:33,460
What was the one that had Sarah Michelle Gellar in it?

2094
01:47:33,460 --> 01:47:34,460
Buffy?

2095
01:47:34,460 --> 01:47:35,460
Buffy?

2096
01:47:35,460 --> 01:47:36,460
No, she was in another movie.

2097
01:47:36,460 --> 01:47:37,460
Cruel Intentions.

2098
01:47:37,460 --> 01:47:38,460
Cruel Intentions.

2099
01:47:38,460 --> 01:47:39,460
That was it.

2100
01:47:39,460 --> 01:47:40,860
Because that movie had a song that I liked, but I've never seen it either.

2101
01:47:40,860 --> 01:47:41,860
Yeah.

2102
01:47:41,860 --> 01:47:45,060
That's the one where you can see Sarah Michelle are going, but I want to fuck.

2103
01:47:45,060 --> 01:47:47,060
Okay.

2104
01:47:47,060 --> 01:47:50,060
Were you volunteering?

2105
01:47:50,860 --> 01:47:53,580
Sarah Michelle Gellar is an attractive lady.

2106
01:47:53,580 --> 01:47:56,460
If you're Freddie Prinze Jr. then yes.

2107
01:47:56,460 --> 01:47:58,420
So anyway, you know what though?

2108
01:47:58,420 --> 01:48:01,820
She does not look as attractive as she did on Buffy because she's all boned thin again

2109
01:48:01,820 --> 01:48:05,420
now and not, you know, in good shape.

2110
01:48:05,420 --> 01:48:06,420
So anyway, okay.

2111
01:48:06,420 --> 01:48:10,900
Former King of Fighters developers are having some issues.

2112
01:48:10,900 --> 01:48:18,540
They were basically, they have an original 2D fighting game that they were looking to

2113
01:48:18,540 --> 01:48:20,420
have some development on.

2114
01:48:20,420 --> 01:48:27,500
It says that right now, and the game is called Yatagarasu, that they want to have it crowdfunded

2115
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:31,020
so that they can release the character in the game.

2116
01:48:31,020 --> 01:48:34,000
And they're wanting it to be 10 playable characters at launch.

2117
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:38,460
They have a funding goal of $68,000 right now and it's on Indiegogo and it can go up

2118
01:48:38,460 --> 01:48:41,860
if it needs to be, so.

2119
01:48:41,860 --> 01:48:47,260
If it's not sucky like the King of Fighters 12 was, then go for it.

2120
01:48:47,260 --> 01:48:48,260
All right.

2121
01:48:48,980 --> 01:48:52,260
I'm a little opinionated when it comes to bad King of Fighters games, Rob.

2122
01:48:52,260 --> 01:48:53,260
Are you?

2123
01:48:53,260 --> 01:48:54,260
I would have never guessed.

2124
01:48:54,260 --> 01:48:55,260
You know what, hush.

2125
01:48:55,260 --> 01:48:58,100
I figured it was appropriate though, considering you just did a King of Fighters, or well,

2126
01:48:58,100 --> 01:48:59,100
sorta.

2127
01:48:59,100 --> 01:49:00,100
Sorta.

2128
01:49:00,100 --> 01:49:01,100
Fatal Fury.

2129
01:49:01,100 --> 01:49:02,100
King of Fighters prequel-ish.

2130
01:49:02,100 --> 01:49:04,060
Yeah, I'm going to do Art of Fighting next week, ooh.

2131
01:49:04,060 --> 01:49:05,060
Are you really?

2132
01:49:05,060 --> 01:49:06,060
No.

2133
01:49:06,060 --> 01:49:07,500
I'm going to do World Heroes Jet.

2134
01:49:07,500 --> 01:49:17,500
Well, you know what I'm going to do is the FUGL Question of the Week right now.

2135
01:49:17,500 --> 01:49:21,740
Make Facebook and Google Plus, slam them together and you get one clusterfuck of a

2136
01:49:21,740 --> 01:49:22,860
social networking site.

2137
01:49:22,860 --> 01:49:27,140
You also get the word FUGL, which we ask a question every week of our Facebook and Google

2138
01:49:27,140 --> 01:49:30,820
fan communities, and we read some of the answers here on the show.

2139
01:49:30,820 --> 01:49:32,060
I might read them all tonight.

2140
01:49:32,060 --> 01:49:33,060
We'll see how I'm feeling.

2141
01:49:33,060 --> 01:49:34,060
I haven't looked.

2142
01:49:34,060 --> 01:49:35,060
How many are on Facebook?

2143
01:49:35,060 --> 01:49:36,060
There's not a ton.

2144
01:49:36,060 --> 01:49:38,900
All right, I can probably get through them all tonight.

2145
01:49:38,900 --> 01:49:40,220
Here we go.

2146
01:49:40,220 --> 01:49:43,420
The Ouya officially hit shelves this week.

2147
01:49:43,420 --> 01:49:44,420
Did you get one?

2148
01:49:44,420 --> 01:49:46,020
Why or why not?

2149
01:49:46,020 --> 01:49:49,580
What do you think about these mobile platform consoles, especially considering there are

2150
01:49:49,580 --> 01:49:54,700
more to come, such as Mojo and the rumors of an official Google Android console?

2151
01:49:54,700 --> 01:49:55,700
And GameStick.

2152
01:49:55,700 --> 01:49:56,700
Oh, yeah.

2153
01:49:56,700 --> 01:49:58,500
Well, I said and more.

2154
01:49:58,500 --> 01:49:59,500
All right.

2155
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:03,320
Retertainment says, unless the Ouya is something that will make it so it's not so damn fucking

2156
01:50:03,320 --> 01:50:06,500
hot outside, I will not be buying one right now.

2157
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:09,780
Maybe I'll buy an Ouya in the future when the outside world is not trying to cook me

2158
01:50:09,780 --> 01:50:10,780
alive.

2159
01:50:10,780 --> 01:50:11,780
Well, to be fair...

2160
01:50:11,780 --> 01:50:12,780
That answer wins.

2161
01:50:12,780 --> 01:50:13,780
We're done.

2162
01:50:13,780 --> 01:50:18,060
Well, to be fair, one thing I do like about the Ouya controller is the face plates are

2163
01:50:18,060 --> 01:50:21,980
made of metal, and so they're nice and cool on your hands.

2164
01:50:21,980 --> 01:50:24,260
All right, fine.

2165
01:50:24,260 --> 01:50:25,580
We'll read other answers then.

2166
01:50:25,580 --> 01:50:26,580
All right.

2167
01:50:26,580 --> 01:50:32,620
So moving to Evel, like E3vL, no, unless I see more exclusive content for the system.

2168
01:50:32,620 --> 01:50:37,940
Also, the Ouya seems to have had bad customer service as of late, having shipped their console

2169
01:50:37,940 --> 01:50:42,300
to retailers before providing all their Kickstarter backers with one first.

2170
01:50:42,300 --> 01:50:48,300
At least provide the backers with some store credit or free games instead of just apologizing.

2171
01:50:48,300 --> 01:50:50,380
We'll get into that in a little bit.

2172
01:50:50,380 --> 01:50:52,380
We're definitely going to be getting into that in a little bit.

2173
01:50:52,380 --> 01:50:53,380
All right.

2174
01:50:53,380 --> 01:50:56,700
Nietzsche says, between the reports of horrible controller input lag and poor performance

2175
01:50:56,700 --> 01:50:59,700
due to outdated hardware, I have no desire to get the Ouya.

2176
01:50:59,700 --> 01:51:03,340
It was a fun idea, but in my opinion, didn't work out.

2177
01:51:03,340 --> 01:51:08,780
Travis H says, Asus transformer tablet plus HDMI cable equals an Ouya I can take on the

2178
01:51:08,780 --> 01:51:09,780
go.

2179
01:51:09,780 --> 01:51:13,380
Honestly, the only thing that I think that piqued my interest about the Ouya is having

2180
01:51:13,380 --> 01:51:18,060
a system to throw emulators on, kind of like an all-in-one super nostalgia machine.

2181
01:51:18,060 --> 01:51:20,540
But I already have that with my tablet, so I'm out.

2182
01:51:20,540 --> 01:51:21,540
Wow.

2183
01:51:21,540 --> 01:51:23,020
Lots of hate for the Ouya on Google Plus.

2184
01:51:23,020 --> 01:51:24,660
Let's see if Facebook's any different.

2185
01:51:24,660 --> 01:51:28,700
Galley 89 says, nope, I don't see the need one, not for me at least.

2186
01:51:28,700 --> 01:51:32,620
Daniel S says, everything I hear about the Ouya is that it's a piece of crap, and putting

2187
01:51:32,620 --> 01:51:37,060
more Android-based platforms is exactly what they need because market confusion and dilution

2188
01:51:37,060 --> 01:51:38,060
is great.

2189
01:51:38,220 --> 01:51:40,860
I think there's a slash sark in there.

2190
01:51:40,860 --> 01:51:45,500
Clover Nikon says, my wife and I enjoy playing games on our Google Nexus 7-inch Android jellybean

2191
01:51:45,500 --> 01:51:46,580
tablet.

2192
01:51:46,580 --> 01:51:50,380
My wife playing Simpsons tap game, I play Star Wars pinball, my father-in-law playing

2193
01:51:50,380 --> 01:51:52,940
those pokey magic slot machine games when he borrows it.

2194
01:51:52,940 --> 01:51:56,860
If a shop here near me sold the Ouya, I would definitely buy one.

2195
01:51:56,860 --> 01:51:58,060
Well, there you go.

2196
01:51:58,060 --> 01:52:01,420
Finally, an answer we can say is a positive one.

2197
01:52:01,420 --> 01:52:08,020
Degenerate Johnny says, it all seems oxymoronic to have a stationary platform for mobile games.

2198
01:52:08,020 --> 01:52:12,140
Honestly, I don't very much care for mobile games, 3DS and Vita excluded.

2199
01:52:12,140 --> 01:52:15,820
They don't offer the same amount of excitement and enjoyment that the big three consoles

2200
01:52:15,820 --> 01:52:16,820
offer.

2201
01:52:16,820 --> 01:52:19,980
Console developers, including Valve, should take a lesson from the auto industry, and

2202
01:52:19,980 --> 01:52:24,740
this is my Michigan side talking, there can be only three, and that's currently Nintendo,

2203
01:52:24,740 --> 01:52:26,260
Sony, and Microsoft.

2204
01:52:26,260 --> 01:52:31,340
Otherwise you are doomed to walk the unfortunate path of the 3DO, Jaguar, and God rest its

2205
01:52:31,340 --> 01:52:32,660
soul, the Dreamcast.

2206
01:52:32,660 --> 01:52:33,660
Aww.

2207
01:52:33,660 --> 01:52:34,660
Aww.

2208
01:52:34,660 --> 01:52:35,660
That answer made me sad.

2209
01:52:35,660 --> 01:52:40,740
Yeah, but the difference between the 3DO and the Jaguar and the Dreamcast is that the

2210
01:52:40,740 --> 01:52:42,740
Dreamcast wasn't shit.

2211
01:52:42,740 --> 01:52:43,740
Word.

2212
01:52:43,740 --> 01:52:49,100
Also, the 80s called and would like to tell you that there is room for more than three

2213
01:52:49,100 --> 01:52:51,220
consoles, although then again, it might lead to another crash.

2214
01:52:51,220 --> 01:52:54,500
We had the whole home computing wars, but that's another episode of the show.

2215
01:52:54,500 --> 01:52:56,340
Actually, we talked about that a lot last week.

2216
01:52:56,340 --> 01:53:01,740
All right, Clerical Error 404 left a pretty long answer here, but since I like them, I'll

2217
01:53:01,740 --> 01:53:02,740
read it.

2218
01:53:02,740 --> 01:53:04,460
No, I did not get one.

2219
01:53:04,460 --> 01:53:08,460
It has clever ideas, offering digital copies of games to first demo and then decide to

2220
01:53:08,460 --> 01:53:12,820
upgrade to the full version, having an easy setup of plugging in an HDMI cable, a library

2221
01:53:12,820 --> 01:53:17,460
of 200 games and counting, being able to run emulators to play games from older systems,

2222
01:53:17,460 --> 01:53:21,420
almost a retro gamer's dream come true, but the old saying is true, that a system is only

2223
01:53:21,420 --> 01:53:25,980
as good as the software, and unfortunately so far it has been able to really wow, I'm

2224
01:53:25,980 --> 01:53:29,180
thinking it hasn't been able to really wow anyone yet.

2225
01:53:29,180 --> 01:53:33,180
I am cautiously optimistic of how the Ouya will thrive, so for now I must wait until

2226
01:53:33,220 --> 01:53:35,020
the purchase of it will be warranted.

2227
01:53:35,020 --> 01:53:38,940
As far as mobile platform consoles, this is another format that has a lot of potential

2228
01:53:38,940 --> 01:53:43,140
to be great, but the old adage is true here as well, just like with the Ouya, that a console

2229
01:53:43,140 --> 01:53:44,880
is only as strong as the software.

2230
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:48,940
If they market it well and have some major developer support, it can definitely be something

2231
01:53:48,940 --> 01:53:50,860
to look forward to.

2232
01:53:50,860 --> 01:53:54,040
Code Man says, no, I don't have a justification for buying one.

2233
01:53:54,040 --> 01:53:58,100
It would just make my wife more addicted to Candy Crush, and I definitely don't need that,

2234
01:53:58,100 --> 01:53:59,100
lol.

2235
01:53:59,100 --> 01:54:00,100
Oh, God.

2236
01:54:00,100 --> 01:54:02,620
There's so much confusion with the platform, I think, to be honest.

2237
01:54:03,420 --> 01:54:06,180
And there's no Candy Crush on it, thank God.

2238
01:54:06,180 --> 01:54:08,820
First off, so what, the console runs Android.

2239
01:54:08,820 --> 01:54:11,860
It doesn't make it a fucking mobile console.

2240
01:54:11,860 --> 01:54:12,860
It's not.

2241
01:54:12,860 --> 01:54:15,220
It's an operating system that runs Android.

2242
01:54:15,220 --> 01:54:18,100
It's just like Android runs on some of those smart TVs.

2243
01:54:18,100 --> 01:54:20,820
Does it mean your TV is a fucking mobile console?

2244
01:54:20,820 --> 01:54:21,820
No it's not.

2245
01:54:21,820 --> 01:54:23,020
It's a TV.

2246
01:54:23,020 --> 01:54:26,220
So it's just an operating system that you're developing games for.

2247
01:54:26,220 --> 01:54:30,020
Yes, a lot of the first games that are coming over are going to be ports of games that are

2248
01:54:30,020 --> 01:54:35,220
on the Android Marketplace, because you're porting an Android game to Android with some

2249
01:54:35,220 --> 01:54:38,740
additional APKs in there, so of course it's going to be like that.

2250
01:54:38,740 --> 01:54:43,060
But that's the thing, it's the whole draw of this console is that it's an indie console.

2251
01:54:43,060 --> 01:54:48,100
Now, I'm not saying that there's everything that's positive about it, because yes, there's

2252
01:54:48,100 --> 01:54:53,460
issues with the controller being, well, especially the first backer controllers, which I'm going

2253
01:54:53,460 --> 01:54:57,660
through an issue right now where I'm trying to get mine replaced because the analog sticks

2254
01:54:57,660 --> 01:54:59,780
don't work correctly.

2255
01:54:59,780 --> 01:55:01,220
And that's on Ouya.

2256
01:55:01,220 --> 01:55:02,940
They need to fix that shit.

2257
01:55:02,940 --> 01:55:09,500
And you know, since we're getting into some topic about, you know, Ouya.

2258
01:55:09,500 --> 01:55:11,620
Alright, can I read the rest of the answers here?

2259
01:55:11,620 --> 01:55:12,620
Yes, go ahead.

2260
01:55:12,620 --> 01:55:13,620
You still want to yell at people.

2261
01:55:13,620 --> 01:55:14,620
No, no, go ahead.

2262
01:55:14,620 --> 01:55:15,620
I'll save that for a second.

2263
01:55:15,620 --> 01:55:16,620
Alright.

2264
01:55:16,620 --> 01:55:19,260
Dart Charger says, I have a MAME cabinet for my emulation needs, and everything else that

2265
01:55:19,260 --> 01:55:23,820
I want can be handled by my consoles or smartphones and tablets, and Ouya would be the epitome

2266
01:55:23,820 --> 01:55:26,580
of a superfluous purchase.

2267
01:55:27,220 --> 01:55:30,980
AZHP says, I didn't get one because I didn't realize it came out this week.

2268
01:55:30,980 --> 01:55:33,500
If there's no advertising, how can I know when it's coming out?

2269
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:35,900
I might pick one up soon for emulation purposes, though.

2270
01:55:35,900 --> 01:55:38,660
And lastly, Osfer says, I'm just not interested.

2271
01:55:38,660 --> 01:55:42,400
The new consoles from the big three are the only ones that really have my attention.

2272
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:44,820
That's all the answers from Facebook and Google.

2273
01:55:44,820 --> 01:55:46,700
Thanks to y'all for answering.

2274
01:55:46,700 --> 01:55:49,700
Join us on Facebook and Google Plus for next week's question.

2275
01:55:49,700 --> 01:55:50,700
Alright.

2276
01:55:50,700 --> 01:55:52,580
Slidekick, are you going to get an Ouya?

2277
01:55:52,580 --> 01:55:59,940
You know, I was actually a very early backer, and, you know, honestly, if I kind of saw

2278
01:55:59,940 --> 01:56:03,460
how it played out, I don't think I would have backed them.

2279
01:56:03,460 --> 01:56:04,460
Yeah.

2280
01:56:04,460 --> 01:56:11,340
I don't know, just between, you know, you heard about all the mess with E3 and how rude

2281
01:56:11,340 --> 01:56:12,340
they were.

2282
01:56:12,340 --> 01:56:13,340
Oh yeah, I was there.

2283
01:56:13,340 --> 01:56:16,180
I took a picture of the big truck parked in front of the booth.

2284
01:56:16,180 --> 01:56:20,300
That was, it wasn't even, and the Ouya thing at E3 was more of a developer showcase than

2285
01:56:20,300 --> 01:56:21,300
it was the console.

2286
01:56:21,300 --> 01:56:22,300
Yeah.

2287
01:56:23,020 --> 01:56:27,260
But, you know, I think what I never really thought about is that, you know, they're just

2288
01:56:27,260 --> 01:56:33,900
going to keep trying to do Ouya's like on a, you know, maybe not a yearly basis, but

2289
01:56:33,900 --> 01:56:38,420
you know, I just think that the precedent that it's setting like, oh, the new Ouya is

2290
01:56:38,420 --> 01:56:41,940
out now and it's better than last year's Ouya.

2291
01:56:41,940 --> 01:56:45,900
It's like, you know, I just don't know if that's a good precedent to set for gaming

2292
01:56:45,900 --> 01:56:52,460
consoles, even though it's not directly trying to compete with, you know, the big three.

2293
01:56:52,460 --> 01:56:56,380
But, you know, I just, I don't, I don't know.

2294
01:56:56,380 --> 01:57:02,420
I actually, mine did arrive and I've yet to unbox it, so I probably should at some point.

2295
01:57:02,420 --> 01:57:03,420
Wow.

2296
01:57:03,420 --> 01:57:09,100
But Captain Spike also backed on Kickstarter before I did and he hasn't received his yet.

2297
01:57:09,100 --> 01:57:13,580
So God, you know, I'll hook mine up eventually.

2298
01:57:13,580 --> 01:57:15,740
I hope that I don't have any controller issues.

2299
01:57:15,740 --> 01:57:17,980
When did yours arrive?

2300
01:57:17,980 --> 01:57:23,620
You know, it arrived in late April or May, so your controller's fucked.

2301
01:57:23,620 --> 01:57:24,620
Sorry.

2302
01:57:24,620 --> 01:57:25,620
Yeah.

2303
01:57:25,620 --> 01:57:27,100
It was late May is when they fixed that shit.

2304
01:57:27,100 --> 01:57:28,100
I am.

2305
01:57:28,100 --> 01:57:29,100
Yeah.

2306
01:57:29,100 --> 01:57:30,100
See, I didn't back this for that reason.

2307
01:57:30,100 --> 01:57:31,100
I just knew.

2308
01:57:31,100 --> 01:57:32,100
But it's all fixed now.

2309
01:57:32,100 --> 01:57:33,100
It's fixed now.

2310
01:57:33,100 --> 01:57:34,100
Yeah, but not for you.

2311
01:57:34,100 --> 01:57:37,300
Well, it's fixed if I don't use the new Ouya controller.

2312
01:57:37,300 --> 01:57:42,340
Thank God I can pair a PlayStation 3 controller to it, but the only thing is not all games.

2313
01:57:42,340 --> 01:57:43,580
You have to account for that.

2314
01:57:43,580 --> 01:57:46,140
So they have to program in those button mappings as well.

2315
01:57:46,140 --> 01:57:49,380
I can, you know, for a lot of things like emulators, I can play with the PlayStation

2316
01:57:49,380 --> 01:57:50,860
3 controller and it works great.

2317
01:57:50,860 --> 01:57:52,100
That's how I knew it was.

2318
01:57:52,100 --> 01:57:54,300
It was the controller, not the console.

2319
01:57:54,300 --> 01:57:58,860
You know, I'm going to get into it in just a second.

2320
01:57:58,860 --> 01:57:59,900
Some of the customer service things.

2321
01:57:59,900 --> 01:58:00,900
It's ridiculous.

2322
01:58:00,900 --> 01:58:02,940
Well, if why don't we go back into the gaming news?

2323
01:58:02,940 --> 01:58:05,580
Loki, why don't you start us off with a possibly related topic?

2324
01:58:05,580 --> 01:58:06,580
Let's talk about this.

2325
01:58:06,580 --> 01:58:07,580
This is great.

2326
01:58:07,580 --> 01:58:08,580
This is fantastic.

2327
01:58:08,580 --> 01:58:11,180
Right when they launched, there was two Kickstarter updates.

2328
01:58:11,180 --> 01:58:14,140
One was like, hey, we launched our console.

2329
01:58:14,140 --> 01:58:16,260
You know, we couldn't have done it without you.

2330
01:58:16,260 --> 01:58:19,740
To which there was a bunch of replies, hey, you fucktard, I haven't gotten my fucking

2331
01:58:19,740 --> 01:58:21,860
console yet that I backed last year.

2332
01:58:21,860 --> 01:58:23,060
Where the fuck is it?

2333
01:58:23,060 --> 01:58:26,780
And then Julie comes out and says, I'm pissed.

2334
01:58:26,780 --> 01:58:31,820
I'm so pissed that we haven't been able to get some of those consoles to you.

2335
01:58:31,820 --> 01:58:36,180
You know, I promised that we'd ship them all and I don't know what's going on.

2336
01:58:36,180 --> 01:58:39,500
We have people in, you know, Hong Kong, they're checking into it and stuff.

2337
01:58:39,500 --> 01:58:40,780
I'll tell you what's going on.

2338
01:58:40,780 --> 01:58:46,380
They shipped it via fucking DHL, DHL Global, first off.

2339
01:58:46,380 --> 01:58:49,780
So slow ass ship in the first place.

2340
01:58:49,780 --> 01:58:55,460
And then you had to pass off to, because it was their global logistics mail or something

2341
01:58:55,460 --> 01:59:00,260
like that, where they pass it off to the US Postal Service.

2342
01:59:00,260 --> 01:59:02,440
It takes so fucking long.

2343
01:59:02,440 --> 01:59:04,380
They didn't know what the hell was going on.

2344
01:59:04,380 --> 01:59:06,980
It basically said, oh, yeah, you're going to get an update and your tracking number

2345
01:59:06,980 --> 01:59:09,660
will become active within, you know, like a couple days.

2346
01:59:09,660 --> 01:59:11,100
It took like a week.

2347
01:59:11,100 --> 01:59:12,780
My tracking number was never active.

2348
01:59:12,780 --> 01:59:14,340
It just showed up one day.

2349
01:59:14,340 --> 01:59:16,640
You're lucky if that thing showed up in the first place.

2350
01:59:16,640 --> 01:59:20,580
And then on top of all that, you had the issues where, you know, you're getting bummed controllers

2351
01:59:20,580 --> 01:59:23,980
with the earlier backer editions, which I did.

2352
01:59:23,980 --> 01:59:26,700
And it's annoying because it doesn't work correctly.

2353
01:59:26,700 --> 01:59:30,300
And so I replied, I sent a ticket for it.

2354
01:59:30,300 --> 01:59:34,860
I'm like, hey, I need this shit fixed, you know, so I sent them a ticket.

2355
01:59:34,860 --> 01:59:38,700
And you know, I understand that they're a little busy with their console launch and

2356
01:59:38,740 --> 01:59:39,740
stuff like that.

2357
01:59:39,740 --> 01:59:40,740
I sent it on Tuesday.

2358
01:59:40,740 --> 01:59:43,100
They got back to me today.

2359
01:59:43,100 --> 01:59:44,740
And here's what their response was.

2360
01:59:44,740 --> 01:59:49,660
It's like, as we continue to evolve the, oh yeah, making constant improvements to our

2361
01:59:49,660 --> 01:59:51,460
product and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2362
01:59:51,460 --> 01:59:54,580
You got a copy paste from an outsource customer service company.

2363
01:59:54,580 --> 01:59:55,580
I bet anything.

2364
01:59:55,580 --> 01:59:56,580
It's not even outsource.

2365
01:59:56,580 --> 01:59:58,080
It took so long.

2366
01:59:58,080 --> 02:00:01,940
And basically saying, you know, the goal is, you know, you should look into the fact and

2367
02:00:01,940 --> 02:00:04,100
see if you could solve your problem there.

2368
02:00:04,100 --> 02:00:06,120
I'm like, I have a fucking defective controller.

2369
02:00:06,120 --> 02:00:08,300
Your fact doesn't help me there.

2370
02:00:08,300 --> 02:00:10,100
It doesn't say anything.

2371
02:00:10,100 --> 02:00:14,500
So I sent a reply, I'm like, listen, I have a defective controller, I need to replace

2372
02:00:14,500 --> 02:00:17,660
this shit because you know what's going to happen if I can't get it replaced?

2373
02:00:17,660 --> 02:00:19,420
I'm going to go to the store.

2374
02:00:19,420 --> 02:00:21,220
I'm going to buy a controller.

2375
02:00:21,220 --> 02:00:24,860
I'm going to replace it with my controller and I'm going to return it is what I'm going

2376
02:00:24,860 --> 02:00:25,860
to do.

2377
02:00:25,860 --> 02:00:28,020
Oh, shame on you.

2378
02:00:28,020 --> 02:00:30,840
But that's kind of, it's clever.

2379
02:00:30,840 --> 02:00:33,100
I should not be supporting that.

2380
02:00:33,100 --> 02:00:36,800
Something similar to that, but not really.

2381
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:41,680
When Sonic Spinball came out, I got it for, you know, full price and then Target had it

2382
02:00:41,680 --> 02:00:44,900
for like five or seven dollars less.

2383
02:00:44,900 --> 02:00:50,160
So I bought it at Target and returned it to Toys R Us.

2384
02:00:50,160 --> 02:00:54,280
So I mean, it's not really like repackaging it, but I felt I was like 10 and I felt like

2385
02:00:54,280 --> 02:00:59,760
I was like, ooh, what if they find out that this is actually from Toys R Us?

2386
02:00:59,760 --> 02:01:00,760
Defective allowance.

2387
02:01:00,760 --> 02:01:01,760
It's, it's all right.

2388
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:06,520
They're usage defectives, but it's seriously, if they're not going to solve my problem because

2389
02:01:06,520 --> 02:01:08,640
they're claiming that they're too busy right now.

2390
02:01:08,640 --> 02:01:13,400
Well, I'm sorry, but you know, it's going to be hard for me to continue supporting your

2391
02:01:13,400 --> 02:01:16,800
console if you're not going to give me a controller that fucking worked.

2392
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:20,200
Since I only have one controller anyways and your additional controllers is 60 fucking

2393
02:01:20,200 --> 02:01:21,200
dollars.

2394
02:01:21,200 --> 02:01:22,200
Nope.

2395
02:01:22,200 --> 02:01:23,200
Not going to buy those.

2396
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:24,200
Sorry.

2397
02:01:24,200 --> 02:01:28,840
So you say most of the cost of the system is the one controller that doesn't work?

2398
02:01:28,840 --> 02:01:29,840
That's their claim.

2399
02:01:29,840 --> 02:01:30,840
But here's the thing.

2400
02:01:30,840 --> 02:01:35,240
It's like, I don't understand why, why the whole thing was a clusterfuck to begin with

2401
02:01:35,240 --> 02:01:36,480
and I know it's going to get better.

2402
02:01:36,480 --> 02:01:38,440
I actually haven't touched my console since May.

2403
02:01:38,440 --> 02:01:40,600
I did loan to a friend, a coworker.

2404
02:01:40,600 --> 02:01:43,760
He wanted to check it out for stuff and so he did my updates and everything.

2405
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:47,600
I guess the interface is a lot nicer now, but you know, a lot of the things that they

2406
02:01:47,600 --> 02:01:51,340
promise, obviously they didn't come through with like one of the major ones.

2407
02:01:51,340 --> 02:01:55,040
This console can be, this console can be easily rooted.

2408
02:01:55,040 --> 02:01:58,180
You're going to be able to root it immediately once you get it.

2409
02:01:58,180 --> 02:01:59,240
Can't do that.

2410
02:01:59,240 --> 02:02:00,240
Can't do that at all.

2411
02:02:00,240 --> 02:02:02,040
Uh, you know, it's very hacker friendly.

2412
02:02:02,040 --> 02:02:03,480
It's no, it's not.

2413
02:02:03,480 --> 02:02:04,480
It's not hacker friendly.

2414
02:02:04,520 --> 02:02:06,520
Aside from the fact that you can sideload.

2415
02:02:06,520 --> 02:02:11,120
Why not channel this energy into a complaint with a better business bureau?

2416
02:02:11,120 --> 02:02:13,200
Because they're not going to do anything.

2417
02:02:13,200 --> 02:02:18,760
No, it's not that whether they do something or not, it's still going to, um, hurt their

2418
02:02:18,760 --> 02:02:20,400
reputation and prevent them from being able to do business.

2419
02:02:20,400 --> 02:02:23,160
I'm sure there's tons of people who have already done that just for their backers.

2420
02:02:23,160 --> 02:02:25,400
Or is that just an excuse not to do it?

2421
02:02:25,400 --> 02:02:27,200
It is an excuse not to do it because I just don't care.

2422
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:28,680
I don't care enough.

2423
02:02:28,680 --> 02:02:31,320
It's a con- I mean, it's not like I, I dropped a ton of money.

2424
02:02:31,320 --> 02:02:34,120
It was a hundred dollars a year ago and I just don't care.

2425
02:02:34,120 --> 02:02:37,800
And that's why companies get away with this because people don't care.

2426
02:02:37,800 --> 02:02:38,800
He wants the internet rage.

2427
02:02:38,800 --> 02:02:39,800
He wants the internet rage.

2428
02:02:39,800 --> 02:02:41,720
I want my controller to work and that's it.

2429
02:02:41,720 --> 02:02:42,720
Then that's fine.

2430
02:02:42,720 --> 02:02:46,240
So write them about it and tell them you're going to file a complaint and see how long

2431
02:02:46,240 --> 02:02:47,240
it takes them to reply.

2432
02:02:47,240 --> 02:02:48,480
Cause trust me, they will reply.

2433
02:02:48,480 --> 02:02:49,480
They won't reply.

2434
02:02:49,480 --> 02:02:50,480
They just, seriously.

2435
02:02:50,480 --> 02:02:55,080
The moment you bring up the three, you know, the business, the better business bureau,

2436
02:02:55,080 --> 02:02:59,600
especially for any company that wants to continue to do business, they tend to jump on that.

2437
02:02:59,600 --> 02:03:01,480
Especially if they've got other people doing the same.

2438
02:03:01,480 --> 02:03:02,480
Well, fine.

2439
02:03:02,480 --> 02:03:05,880
The next time I send them an update, I'll say, I'll contact the better business bureau

2440
02:03:05,880 --> 02:03:08,600
and we'll see them do nothing because yeah.

2441
02:03:08,600 --> 02:03:11,760
Let me read some of the written word in our chat room at live.vognetware.com.

2442
02:03:11,760 --> 02:03:16,200
Burr says, even the positive reviews are like, I like mine, but I haven't bought a game for

2443
02:03:16,200 --> 02:03:17,200
it yet.

2444
02:03:17,200 --> 02:03:18,200
Just played the demos.

2445
02:03:18,200 --> 02:03:22,080
There is seriously, a lot of the games on there are free to play right now and everything

2446
02:03:22,080 --> 02:03:23,340
has a free version of it.

2447
02:03:23,340 --> 02:03:26,400
So yeah, a lot of it you don't need to necessarily buy.

2448
02:03:26,400 --> 02:03:31,480
Codeman says, this is just a huge shit on the people who backed.

2449
02:03:31,480 --> 02:03:37,680
It is really unexcusable that they, you know, they got limited supply of the stores because

2450
02:03:37,680 --> 02:03:40,340
they wanted to make sure they have that retail presence or whatever.

2451
02:03:40,340 --> 02:03:45,040
But at the same time, they've made a promise to everyone that backed them to, you know,

2452
02:03:45,040 --> 02:03:46,040
deliver on that.

2453
02:03:46,040 --> 02:03:50,520
And if they can't deliver to, you know, people that ordered their console, I'm sorry, back

2454
02:03:50,520 --> 02:03:55,360
their Kickstarter and got a free console, however the fuck you want to word that because

2455
02:03:55,400 --> 02:03:59,520
you're not technically ordering anything, but you know, whatever.

2456
02:03:59,520 --> 02:04:02,720
They made a promise and they couldn't even fulfill that.

2457
02:04:02,720 --> 02:04:05,960
And they kept, they didn't give any firm numbers to what was shipping.

2458
02:04:05,960 --> 02:04:09,680
They just did this really generic line graph thing.

2459
02:04:09,680 --> 02:04:14,160
And you know, at a point at the beginning of June or something, they're like, all consoles

2460
02:04:14,160 --> 02:04:15,160
have shipped.

2461
02:04:15,160 --> 02:04:16,160
Really?

2462
02:04:16,160 --> 02:04:19,480
They've all shipped because no one's gotten them yet.

2463
02:04:19,480 --> 02:04:22,160
So yeah, it was really weird.

2464
02:04:22,160 --> 02:04:27,380
So I would be willing to, I'm kind of curious to see what it's going to look like in three

2465
02:04:27,380 --> 02:04:28,380
months time.

2466
02:04:28,380 --> 02:04:31,760
You know, if they're going to have all of these, you know, if they're going to follow

2467
02:04:31,760 --> 02:04:35,360
through with everything that they promised about this console, cause right now, you know,

2468
02:04:35,360 --> 02:04:38,520
they said they have like how many developers, like 5,000 developers or something like that

2469
02:04:38,520 --> 02:04:41,280
for the Ouya and there's 200 games.

2470
02:04:41,280 --> 02:04:42,960
Are they counting like every console they sold?

2471
02:04:42,960 --> 02:04:46,400
Because technically every console they sell can be a software development kit that you

2472
02:04:46,400 --> 02:04:48,020
can develop a game for.

2473
02:04:48,020 --> 02:04:51,880
So are we counting those as like con, you know, developers?

2474
02:04:52,600 --> 02:04:53,600
All right.

2475
02:04:53,600 --> 02:04:54,800
Well, I got to move on.

2476
02:04:54,800 --> 02:04:59,400
I'm sure Loki could do an entire episode just about his hatred towards this whole thing.

2477
02:04:59,400 --> 02:05:00,400
Lesson learned.

2478
02:05:00,400 --> 02:05:03,080
Would you, would you back another console after what happened to this?

2479
02:05:03,080 --> 02:05:09,740
Yeah, I would, but it'd be, it would have to be, you know, a lot more, um, research

2480
02:05:09,740 --> 02:05:10,740
done into it.

2481
02:05:10,740 --> 02:05:15,640
Like, you know, not that like Google's going to, you know, put a Kickstarter out there

2482
02:05:15,640 --> 02:05:20,360
for a console, but you know, it would have to be like, if, you know, it would be, it

2483
02:05:20,360 --> 02:05:21,640
would be, it'd be different.

2484
02:05:21,640 --> 02:05:26,040
Like there's a different, like a console that's supposed to be, I keep seeing that

2485
02:05:26,040 --> 02:05:30,660
they're trying to pitch this guy is kind of doing this, Oh, it can do everything and stuff

2486
02:05:30,660 --> 02:05:31,720
that you can imagine.

2487
02:05:31,720 --> 02:05:32,720
It's amazing.

2488
02:05:32,720 --> 02:05:36,380
The Oton or whatever, it's like this autonomous console is basically supposed to procedurally

2489
02:05:36,380 --> 02:05:38,720
generate games.

2490
02:05:38,720 --> 02:05:44,760
And that sounds neat, I guess, but it's just like the stuff that he's promising is ridiculous.

2491
02:05:44,760 --> 02:05:49,640
And so like, it's just like, yeah, I'm not going to back in this, but he's playing it

2492
02:05:49,640 --> 02:05:50,640
in a Kickstarter.

2493
02:05:50,640 --> 02:05:54,720
So you'll probably see that at some point, uh, cause he tried to get in, unfortunately

2494
02:05:54,720 --> 02:05:58,980
it was, we had got in and then they started requiring that anything that's electronics

2495
02:05:58,980 --> 02:06:02,960
or something like that has to have an actual prototype, a physical prototype made, not

2496
02:06:02,960 --> 02:06:04,560
just a concept.

2497
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:06,480
So that's the problem.

2498
02:06:06,480 --> 02:06:11,960
I think it would be reluctant to spend as much on Kickstarter anymore.

2499
02:06:11,960 --> 02:06:16,600
Usually I just put in about 15 to $20 for a game or something, but that was the first

2500
02:06:16,600 --> 02:06:22,880
big, uh, big Kickstarter amount that I put in and I don't think I'd be as likely to do

2501
02:06:22,880 --> 02:06:23,880
it anymore.

2502
02:06:23,880 --> 02:06:26,320
All right, well let's move on.

2503
02:06:26,320 --> 02:06:30,680
Um, speaking of people who aren't likely to do certain things anymore, uh, Bethesda, the

2504
02:06:30,680 --> 02:06:35,320
vice president of PR marketing, Pete Hines, uh, in an interesting statement with, I believe

2505
02:06:35,320 --> 02:06:38,960
it was Eurogamer talking about quote, we don't have Facebook stuff.

2506
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:40,580
We don't have mobile stuff.

2507
02:06:40,580 --> 02:06:43,440
We feel like we really know who we are, what we're good at.

2508
02:06:43,440 --> 02:06:46,280
So, you know, you know, you don't see Skyrim mobile or anything like that.

2509
02:06:46,280 --> 02:06:49,600
A while ago it was social games that were all the rage and people were asking, why

2510
02:06:49,600 --> 02:06:50,600
aren't we doing Facebook?

2511
02:06:50,600 --> 02:06:53,560
That's not what we do and that's no longer a big deal.

2512
02:06:53,560 --> 02:06:56,180
So we didn't run after it and now we're not running away from it.

2513
02:06:56,180 --> 02:06:59,120
We're just going to kind of stick to what we feel is best.

2514
02:06:59,120 --> 02:07:04,280
By the way, it doesn't just extend to Facebook and mobile quote, we have nothing announced

2515
02:07:04,280 --> 02:07:06,560
in development for Wii U.

2516
02:07:06,560 --> 02:07:08,920
It's not something we've done anything for previously.

2517
02:07:08,920 --> 02:07:11,760
I don't even remember the last time we've done a Nintendo title.

2518
02:07:11,760 --> 02:07:12,760
I do.

2519
02:07:12,760 --> 02:07:13,760
What was it?

2520
02:07:13,760 --> 02:07:16,000
It was Brunswick bowling.

2521
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:17,000
I'm serious.

2522
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:18,280
That's what it was.

2523
02:07:18,280 --> 02:07:19,280
We don't have anything.

2524
02:07:19,280 --> 02:07:22,940
That was just everybody trying to run off of the popularity of Wii Sports of which bowling

2525
02:07:22,940 --> 02:07:24,560
was huge.

2526
02:07:24,560 --> 02:07:28,400
We don't have anything now whether or not we would in the future is to be determined.

2527
02:07:28,400 --> 02:07:31,880
As for why, I guess I'd rather not go into that.

2528
02:07:31,880 --> 02:07:33,840
Oh, well, shit.

2529
02:07:33,840 --> 02:07:37,880
Now we all have to sit here and make it up because he won't go into it.

2530
02:07:37,880 --> 02:07:43,280
So what it is just that the Wii U is a, they don't believe in it.

2531
02:07:43,280 --> 02:07:46,640
They don't think something like Skyrim is capable of running on Wii U?

2532
02:07:46,640 --> 02:07:51,280
I think it's just, once again, it's cost risk type thing.

2533
02:07:51,280 --> 02:07:57,240
The cost it's going to take to develop a game or port a game over to that platform versus

2534
02:07:57,240 --> 02:08:01,920
the amount of money you're going to make with the limited marketplace for it right now because

2535
02:08:01,920 --> 02:08:04,000
there's just not a lot of people that bought the console.

2536
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:05,000
I think it's going to change.

2537
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:08,080
You're going to hear a lot of people more willing to develop for it when there's more

2538
02:08:08,080 --> 02:08:10,020
people that bought the console.

2539
02:08:10,020 --> 02:08:13,860
So it's going to take another year or so with some of these first party games to drive

2540
02:08:13,860 --> 02:08:16,940
some console sales to get more third parties involved.

2541
02:08:16,940 --> 02:08:23,500
But if it doesn't work, if the third parties, or I should say the first party games don't

2542
02:08:23,500 --> 02:08:28,620
drive enough console sales, then yeah, you're going to hear a lot more of this.

2543
02:08:28,620 --> 02:08:32,980
I don't think it's a huge loss because there hasn't really been a Bethesda game since

2544
02:08:32,980 --> 02:08:33,980
Brunswick Bowling.

2545
02:08:33,980 --> 02:08:39,460
So it's not like, I don't know, it is kind of disappointing because you think that something

2546
02:08:39,460 --> 02:08:44,520
that's kind of graphically on par with a Playstation 3 and an Xbox 360 and yet you're

2547
02:08:44,520 --> 02:08:48,580
not getting these games that are on those platforms.

2548
02:08:48,580 --> 02:08:50,380
It's not helping them any.

2549
02:08:50,380 --> 02:08:53,540
Alright, let's shift gears here completely.

2550
02:08:53,540 --> 02:08:56,260
Dark Soccer, you have a very interesting story for us next.

2551
02:08:56,260 --> 02:09:02,920
Yes, I do, and I found it on Game Politics, which I love Game Politics.

2552
02:09:02,920 --> 02:09:06,300
You want to see what goes on in the world around video games.

2553
02:09:06,300 --> 02:09:10,140
It doesn't necessarily have to do with release dates, then that's the place to go.

2554
02:09:10,140 --> 02:09:18,300
But there was a conservative political website called the Daily Caller that said that a Texas

2555
02:09:18,300 --> 02:09:24,120
teenager was making a joke while playing League of Legends, and the joke was, and I'm going

2556
02:09:24,120 --> 02:09:28,780
to quote, oh yeah, I'm real messed up in the head, I'm going to shoot up a school full

2557
02:09:28,780 --> 02:09:34,140
of kids and eat their still beating hearts, followed by a JK and lol.

2558
02:09:34,140 --> 02:09:41,180
Well, there were people who took this seriously, actually a Canadian lady, who looked up the

2559
02:09:41,180 --> 02:09:48,040
teenager's address and noted where he lived and reported it to the police, and he's been

2560
02:09:48,040 --> 02:09:49,680
in jail ever since.

2561
02:09:49,680 --> 02:09:55,520
He actually spent his 19th birthday in jail, and if he's convicted, he's going to spend

2562
02:09:55,520 --> 02:10:03,320
up to eight years in prison, and this is basically for making a terrorist threat.

2563
02:10:03,320 --> 02:10:08,080
It just goes to show what this is, basically it's an ignorant kid.

2564
02:10:08,080 --> 02:10:13,160
His dad said he doesn't watch the news, he doesn't read up on any current events, he's

2565
02:10:13,160 --> 02:10:15,240
just a dumb kid making a threat.

2566
02:10:15,240 --> 02:10:20,380
I'm sorry, but if you're on the internet, how do you not hear about stuff, just hearing

2567
02:10:20,380 --> 02:10:22,520
about stuff that other people are talking about?

2568
02:10:22,520 --> 02:10:30,040
Even apart from that, there's people who will all the time say really horrible things, trying

2569
02:10:30,040 --> 02:10:37,680
to threaten somebody or exert their own personal dominance over somebody else.

2570
02:10:37,680 --> 02:10:43,140
There's actually a petition out, I hate change.org, just because when you sign any petition there,

2571
02:10:43,140 --> 02:10:50,480
you get a bajillion emails, and I hate it, but there is a petition up on change.org right

2572
02:10:50,480 --> 02:10:56,920
now to try to get him out of jail, which I don't know if it's going to work, but the

2573
02:10:56,920 --> 02:11:02,520
whole thing that this boils down to, and it's almost an epidemic when it comes to online

2574
02:11:02,520 --> 02:11:09,720
play, is that, and it's not just the whole terrorist threat type statements, because

2575
02:11:09,720 --> 02:11:13,540
they're saying that there's kids everywhere being gotten in trouble for this, but for

2576
02:11:13,540 --> 02:11:18,840
the ones who go, oh I'm going to rape you, and I'm sure they're not meaning they're going

2577
02:11:18,840 --> 02:11:25,740
to go out and take somebody against their will, it's a means of exerting dominance.

2578
02:11:25,740 --> 02:11:30,660
It's, you know, top of the one says, just relax and let it happen.

2579
02:11:30,660 --> 02:11:31,660
Oh god.

2580
02:11:31,660 --> 02:11:33,660
Rob, I am disgusted.

2581
02:11:33,660 --> 02:11:37,700
You know, like the whole, I'm just, the G-rated version of that.

2582
02:11:37,700 --> 02:11:41,620
Well, but on top of that, there's also ones going, well I'm just going to beat the shit

2583
02:11:41,620 --> 02:11:46,900
out of you, or, just with all the cyberbullying that's been in the recent, or the tits are

2584
02:11:46,900 --> 02:11:47,900
GTFOs.

2585
02:11:47,900 --> 02:11:52,180
A lot of people say stupid shit on the internet, what a shock.

2586
02:11:52,180 --> 02:11:59,140
But what we're looking into now is that people actually taking some of them seriously, where,

2587
02:11:59,140 --> 02:12:05,300
and I firmly believe that this kid was just being a stupid kid, you know, just saying

2588
02:12:05,300 --> 02:12:09,140
something that he thought was going to make himself sound a little, you know, more puffed

2589
02:12:09,140 --> 02:12:11,900
up and a little bit more of a badass.

2590
02:12:11,900 --> 02:12:14,300
You have eight years in prison.

2591
02:12:14,300 --> 02:12:19,300
Yeah, I mean, I would even think by now, even if they dropped the whole thing, he's fucking

2592
02:12:19,300 --> 02:12:20,300
learned his lesson.

2593
02:12:20,500 --> 02:12:23,380
Send the cops to his house to scare the shit out of him.

2594
02:12:23,380 --> 02:12:27,460
You know, like that's, that's how you learn your lesson.

2595
02:12:27,460 --> 02:12:32,660
You know, I would, if I had a way to do that with everyone who said anything that out of

2596
02:12:32,660 --> 02:12:39,860
context could remotely be taken as threatening, or any type of bragging of said threatening

2597
02:12:39,860 --> 02:12:45,820
action, I would do it in a heartbeat just to scare people, you know, to scare people

2598
02:12:45,820 --> 02:12:50,060
into behaving, even though it shouldn't take scaring people into behaving.

2599
02:12:50,060 --> 02:12:53,540
They should just fucking know how to behave like a human being.

2600
02:12:53,540 --> 02:12:54,780
That's asking a lot from people.

2601
02:12:54,780 --> 02:12:58,020
That's asking a lot, I know.

2602
02:12:58,020 --> 02:13:01,380
And I mean, and it goes without saying that when, you know, you put these people behind

2603
02:13:01,380 --> 02:13:07,340
a mask of anonymity, that they think that they've got fair, you know, fair game to say

2604
02:13:07,340 --> 02:13:10,620
anything that they want, that there's no repercussion.

2605
02:13:10,620 --> 02:13:16,100
In this case, the lady knew who he was and called on him.

2606
02:13:16,100 --> 02:13:20,220
You know, I actually, my point with this is that I would actually even express this as

2607
02:13:20,220 --> 02:13:26,620
a cautionary tale, you know, put it out there for any of these people who are going to be

2608
02:13:26,620 --> 02:13:27,620
douches online.

2609
02:13:27,620 --> 02:13:29,060
Not that our listeners would ever do that.

2610
02:13:29,060 --> 02:13:37,900
No, because our listeners are kind, intelligent, beautiful, handsome, non-bigoted, lovely people.

2611
02:13:37,900 --> 02:13:40,620
And if you are bigoted, don't tell me or I'll beat you up.

2612
02:13:40,620 --> 02:13:41,620
I'm kidding.

2613
02:13:41,620 --> 02:13:43,580
No, I wouldn't beat anybody up.

2614
02:13:43,580 --> 02:13:46,300
I would hear sirens heading towards your house, Jamie.

2615
02:13:46,300 --> 02:13:47,300
Wow.

2616
02:13:47,300 --> 02:13:48,460
Popo's coming for Jamie.

2617
02:13:48,460 --> 02:13:49,460
Whatever.

2618
02:13:49,460 --> 02:13:50,460
You know what?

2619
02:13:50,460 --> 02:13:52,740
I would just judge them really harshly.

2620
02:13:52,740 --> 02:14:04,140
But you know, you should never bring up something that you know is going to be triggering.

2621
02:14:04,140 --> 02:14:07,020
I hate to use the word, but something that's going to be triggering to somebody.

2622
02:14:07,020 --> 02:14:11,660
You know, there are people who lost family and friends in any number of terrorist attack.

2623
02:14:11,660 --> 02:14:15,300
I know people personally who have lost family members.

2624
02:14:15,300 --> 02:14:18,540
You know, it's a really awful thing.

2625
02:14:18,540 --> 02:14:26,020
And when you bring up something like that, when there is such a volatile environment

2626
02:14:26,020 --> 02:14:32,340
around that, just that concept, then you are really asking for a pile of shit.

2627
02:14:32,340 --> 02:14:37,420
I mean, I think like games included, but you know, just as everything moves more with more

2628
02:14:37,420 --> 02:14:38,420
online communication.

2629
02:14:38,420 --> 02:14:43,660
I mean, I think people just need to really be more mindful and like we need to educate

2630
02:14:43,660 --> 02:14:46,940
people of, you know, but I mean, again, that's asking a lot.

2631
02:14:46,940 --> 02:14:51,940
I'm going to quote my granddaddy and my granddaddy was a great guy from Bridgeport, Connecticut.

2632
02:14:51,940 --> 02:14:52,940
He was our Yankee.

2633
02:14:52,940 --> 02:14:58,240
When I grew up in the south, he always said, put brain in gear before mouth in motion.

2634
02:14:58,240 --> 02:15:02,580
His other catchphrase was don't be an instigator and an agitator.

2635
02:15:02,580 --> 02:15:07,320
But I mean, those are two really good pieces of advice.

2636
02:15:07,320 --> 02:15:11,580
You don't want to stir up the hornet's nest.

2637
02:15:11,580 --> 02:15:15,320
You have to gently remove it to where you don't get stung in the process or no one else

2638
02:15:15,320 --> 02:15:16,320
get hurt.

2639
02:15:16,320 --> 02:15:17,540
You know, it's the same thing.

2640
02:15:17,540 --> 02:15:21,160
And I think that with this kid, yeah, he doesn't deserve to be locked up, but he did deserve

2641
02:15:21,160 --> 02:15:25,360
to have a stern talking to at least to have some sort of repercussion.

2642
02:15:25,360 --> 02:15:26,360
Scared straight.

2643
02:15:26,360 --> 02:15:27,360
Exactly.

2644
02:15:27,360 --> 02:15:28,360
Or maybe scared gay.

2645
02:15:28,360 --> 02:15:29,360
I don't know.

2646
02:15:29,360 --> 02:15:30,360
Whatever.

2647
02:15:30,360 --> 02:15:31,360
Whatever.

2648
02:15:31,360 --> 02:15:33,240
You're the one who told me to go gaily forward.

2649
02:15:33,240 --> 02:15:34,240
OK.

2650
02:15:34,240 --> 02:15:40,920
Anyway, I think that in any of any of these cases, you know, yeah, they need to drop it

2651
02:15:40,920 --> 02:15:41,920
with the kid.

2652
02:15:41,920 --> 02:15:43,880
He's clearly learned his lesson.

2653
02:15:43,880 --> 02:15:47,440
But to everybody, just think before you speak.

2654
02:15:47,440 --> 02:15:51,440
And instead of reacting to something that someone has said or something that you've

2655
02:15:51,440 --> 02:15:57,960
seen or losing a game, boo hoo, go cry me a fucking river.

2656
02:15:57,960 --> 02:15:59,760
Don't react.

2657
02:15:59,760 --> 02:16:01,560
Think and act.

2658
02:16:01,560 --> 02:16:02,560
So the story.

2659
02:16:02,560 --> 02:16:06,840
I apologize after our press our luck game, slide kick for threatening to kill you and

2660
02:16:06,840 --> 02:16:10,160
leave your corpse out on the porch for the cause of love.

2661
02:16:10,160 --> 02:16:12,680
Can you say you're going to pee on my corpse, too?

2662
02:16:12,680 --> 02:16:13,920
Yeah, I probably did.

2663
02:16:13,920 --> 02:16:17,040
And I was going to hit you with a bug net repeatedly since you like Animal Crossing

2664
02:16:17,040 --> 02:16:18,040
so much.

2665
02:16:18,040 --> 02:16:22,160
So I hear the sirens again, they're coming back this way.

2666
02:16:22,160 --> 02:16:23,160
No.

2667
02:16:23,160 --> 02:16:24,160
All right.

2668
02:16:24,160 --> 02:16:25,160
I'm sorry.

2669
02:16:25,160 --> 02:16:26,160
I shouldn't joke about it.

2670
02:16:26,160 --> 02:16:27,160
I shouldn't laugh.

2671
02:16:27,160 --> 02:16:32,280
I just I would actually just still like to encourage our listeners to keep a level head.

2672
02:16:32,280 --> 02:16:33,360
Don't react.

2673
02:16:33,360 --> 02:16:35,320
Think and act.

2674
02:16:35,320 --> 02:16:36,420
That's my new catchphrase.

2675
02:16:36,420 --> 02:16:42,200
You should have a little McGruff, the crime dog saying you should make some YouTube gaming

2676
02:16:42,200 --> 02:16:43,200
PSAs.

2677
02:16:43,200 --> 02:16:47,320
Get gamey like like Jamie's gaming stern advice.

2678
02:16:47,320 --> 02:16:52,200
I almost said gamey like Wanda Sykes, knock it off.

2679
02:16:52,200 --> 02:16:55,220
And then, you know, what's going to happen is I'm going to get a ton of people commenting

2680
02:16:55,220 --> 02:17:00,760
on YouTube, you know, show me your boobs, get back in the kitchen, rape, blah, blah,

2681
02:17:00,760 --> 02:17:01,760
blah.

2682
02:17:02,240 --> 02:17:05,240
And then you have to just single out each and every one of them, trace their IPs and

2683
02:17:05,240 --> 02:17:06,400
send them a letter.

2684
02:17:06,400 --> 02:17:11,800
Back trace them through the Internet or just disable comments.

2685
02:17:11,800 --> 02:17:12,800
That's what I do.

2686
02:17:12,800 --> 02:17:17,400
But I've actually done that before where I got one of those stupid, you know, so and

2687
02:17:17,400 --> 02:17:18,400
so rape.

2688
02:17:18,400 --> 02:17:20,520
But it came through a source that I was able to track back as IP.

2689
02:17:20,520 --> 02:17:21,520
It was on a forum.

2690
02:17:21,520 --> 02:17:23,840
I think it was a DDR freak back in the day.

2691
02:17:23,840 --> 02:17:27,620
But I traced his IP back and found out where he lived and messaged him.

2692
02:17:27,620 --> 02:17:28,680
You live here and here.

2693
02:17:28,680 --> 02:17:29,960
I have your phone number.

2694
02:17:29,960 --> 02:17:30,960
What are you going to do about it?

2695
02:17:31,160 --> 02:17:32,160
Oh, please don't call me.

2696
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:33,160
Please don't call me.

2697
02:17:33,160 --> 02:17:35,160
I'm going to call your mother.

2698
02:17:35,160 --> 02:17:36,160
No.

2699
02:17:36,160 --> 02:17:39,440
Well, I love all those people who say, oh, well, I just found your Facebook.

2700
02:17:39,440 --> 02:17:41,200
I'm posting it back where your mom can see it.

2701
02:17:41,200 --> 02:17:42,200
Yeah.

2702
02:17:42,200 --> 02:17:44,960
But then some trolls make it really successfully and it makes me very bitter.

2703
02:17:44,960 --> 02:17:49,240
I'm having a drink as I say that.

2704
02:17:49,240 --> 02:17:54,080
In some cases, it's when you remove that mask of anonymity that they really straighten up.

2705
02:17:54,080 --> 02:17:55,080
You know what I mean?

2706
02:17:55,080 --> 02:17:59,080
Degenerate Johnny in chat says, go to shit senders dot com and send them a cow pie.

2707
02:17:59,080 --> 02:18:00,080
That's a real thing.

2708
02:18:00,200 --> 02:18:01,200
Yes, it is.

2709
02:18:01,200 --> 02:18:02,200
But that's great.

2710
02:18:02,200 --> 02:18:03,200
That happens.

2711
02:18:03,200 --> 02:18:04,200
Spike, if you're listening.

2712
02:18:04,200 --> 02:18:05,200
Happy birthday.

2713
02:18:05,200 --> 02:18:07,560
Actually, you know what I want to do?

2714
02:18:07,560 --> 02:18:10,600
And I don't know if something like this exists because you know how there's like the National

2715
02:18:10,600 --> 02:18:12,280
Sex Offender Registry.

2716
02:18:12,280 --> 02:18:14,480
I want to do the Internet Offender Registry.

2717
02:18:14,480 --> 02:18:16,480
National Gaming Douchebag.

2718
02:18:16,480 --> 02:18:17,480
Yeah.

2719
02:18:17,480 --> 02:18:21,940
Well, you can do slander, slander, lawsuit, slander.

2720
02:18:21,940 --> 02:18:28,780
If you can do as so-and-so parks like an asshole dot com, then you can do shit people said

2721
02:18:28,780 --> 02:18:31,300
on the Internet dot com.

2722
02:18:31,300 --> 02:18:33,220
You know, I'm just saying.

2723
02:18:33,220 --> 02:18:36,740
Captain Spike is in chat, by the way, and says rude.

2724
02:18:36,740 --> 02:18:39,900
All right, moving on.

2725
02:18:39,900 --> 02:18:41,980
I'm sure we have lots of other thoughts on this.

2726
02:18:41,980 --> 02:18:46,460
I invite you guys to email us mailbag at Orange Lounge Radio dot com.

2727
02:18:46,460 --> 02:18:50,300
Although we are definitely going to change that email address in the coming weeks.

2728
02:18:50,300 --> 02:18:51,780
But for now, you can still use that.

2729
02:18:51,780 --> 02:18:54,300
There'll be plenty of announcement when we flip it over.

2730
02:18:54,300 --> 02:18:56,580
Mailbag at Orange Lounge Radio dot com.

2731
02:18:56,580 --> 02:18:59,300
Meanwhile, everyone's doing emails these days.

2732
02:18:59,300 --> 02:19:00,300
I love it.

2733
02:19:00,300 --> 02:19:01,300
What?

2734
02:19:01,300 --> 02:19:05,340
Well, Queen City is a National Doucheburg registry and Fifth Dream says dbag shaming

2735
02:19:05,340 --> 02:19:07,180
dot com.

2736
02:19:07,180 --> 02:19:08,380
I am all for that.

2737
02:19:08,380 --> 02:19:09,380
I would do it.

2738
02:19:09,380 --> 02:19:10,380
All right.

2739
02:19:10,380 --> 02:19:15,820
Let's we have to run it through Sweden so that we don't get low Q. We need something

2740
02:19:15,820 --> 02:19:17,860
a little less serious here.

2741
02:19:17,860 --> 02:19:20,780
All right.

2742
02:19:20,780 --> 02:19:21,780
Let's see here.

2743
02:19:22,780 --> 02:19:28,940
Molly Jam, part two, this this one's going to be a little different instead of basing

2744
02:19:28,940 --> 02:19:35,660
it off of the fake Peter Molyneux Twitter account and those kind of ideas.

2745
02:19:35,660 --> 02:19:42,100
These are based off of actual quotes from Peter Molyneux.

2746
02:19:42,100 --> 02:19:45,020
And it's weird.

2747
02:19:45,020 --> 02:19:46,140
It's really weird.

2748
02:19:46,140 --> 02:19:48,500
Can you read the one that was included in that article?

2749
02:19:48,500 --> 02:19:50,100
Yes, I can do that.

2750
02:19:50,100 --> 02:19:54,020
In fact, here is some of the stuff and I think a lot of this is going to be very dirty.

2751
02:19:54,020 --> 02:19:55,300
It's you Americans.

2752
02:19:55,300 --> 02:19:57,980
There's something about nipples you hate.

2753
02:19:57,980 --> 02:20:03,220
If this were Germany, we'd be romping around naked on stage here.

2754
02:20:03,220 --> 02:20:04,220
So that could become a game.

2755
02:20:04,220 --> 02:20:08,660
I feel like that would be a callback to the Atari days, you know, beat them and eat them.

2756
02:20:08,660 --> 02:20:09,660
Gross.

2757
02:20:09,660 --> 02:20:10,660
Like, OK, there you go.

2758
02:20:10,660 --> 02:20:11,660
I'm in the list.

2759
02:20:11,660 --> 02:20:13,840
I'm going to read off a couple of these for you.

2760
02:20:13,840 --> 02:20:15,660
These are potential games right here.

2761
02:20:15,660 --> 02:20:19,460
You can actually break someone's neck on some railing during combat.

2762
02:20:19,460 --> 02:20:24,300
It could be a spike on a fence or a solid brick wall and you get increased experience

2763
02:20:24,300 --> 02:20:26,540
for that as well.

2764
02:20:26,540 --> 02:20:29,380
Neckbreaker like it.

2765
02:20:29,380 --> 02:20:30,380
Let's see here.

2766
02:20:30,380 --> 02:20:34,620
We're we're explorers who have just discovered this new continent of emotion.

2767
02:20:34,620 --> 02:20:35,620
I'd actually play that.

2768
02:20:35,620 --> 02:20:38,620
It would probably be very cool.

2769
02:20:38,620 --> 02:20:39,620
Let's see.

2770
02:20:39,620 --> 02:20:43,220
I wish I had I had some time machine and could go back two weeks.

2771
02:20:43,220 --> 02:20:46,400
You live by your mistakes for sure.

2772
02:20:46,400 --> 02:20:50,680
When you rip your fingers on the screen, you tear the landscape apart with your physical

2773
02:20:50,680 --> 02:20:51,680
hands.

2774
02:20:51,680 --> 02:20:53,120
It just feels amazing, man.

2775
02:20:53,120 --> 02:20:55,600
It's feels amazing.

2776
02:20:55,600 --> 02:20:57,600
Let's see here.

2777
02:20:57,600 --> 02:21:02,000
They have 48 hours to make a game out of these quotes.

2778
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:03,000
Yeah.

2779
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:04,240
There's like 22 quotes here.

2780
02:21:04,240 --> 02:21:06,800
What about ripping the screen would have to be an iOS title?

2781
02:21:06,800 --> 02:21:09,720
I remember I remember hearing about this last year.

2782
02:21:09,720 --> 02:21:14,280
You can eliminate starvation or you can double it.

2783
02:21:14,280 --> 02:21:19,840
You can empty the treasury or you fill it with gold and rub it all over your body.

2784
02:21:19,840 --> 02:21:21,080
That game sounds hot.

2785
02:21:21,080 --> 02:21:22,080
Yeah.

2786
02:21:22,080 --> 02:21:23,600
Another Atari adult game.

2787
02:21:23,600 --> 02:21:30,760
Well, will the first female nudity give you a success or will it turn off an audience?

2788
02:21:30,760 --> 02:21:32,760
What is that going to be?

2789
02:21:32,760 --> 02:21:33,760
I can't wait.

2790
02:21:33,760 --> 02:21:34,760
I got to see that.

2791
02:21:34,760 --> 02:21:35,760
I'm not punishing you for button mashing.

2792
02:21:35,760 --> 02:21:37,920
I'm rewarding you for not button mashing them.

2793
02:21:37,920 --> 02:21:42,040
That's a really big distinction that could be a rhythm game.

2794
02:21:42,040 --> 02:21:43,040
All right.

2795
02:21:43,040 --> 02:21:44,040
Anyhow.

2796
02:21:44,800 --> 02:21:45,800
Show me the game.

2797
02:21:45,800 --> 02:21:46,800
Wait.

2798
02:21:46,800 --> 02:21:47,800
Last one though.

2799
02:21:47,800 --> 02:21:48,800
All right.

2800
02:21:48,800 --> 02:21:49,800
When you're doing it in multiplayer, it feels incredible.

2801
02:21:49,800 --> 02:21:50,800
I love that.

2802
02:21:50,800 --> 02:21:51,800
Oh.

2803
02:21:51,800 --> 02:21:53,880
So the theme is going to be adult games then.

2804
02:21:53,880 --> 02:21:54,880
Good times.

2805
02:21:54,880 --> 02:21:55,880
All right.

2806
02:21:55,880 --> 02:21:59,040
Well, maybe some of these games that come out of MolyJam could be pitched to Dave and

2807
02:21:59,040 --> 02:22:01,000
Buster's arcade or cage chain.

2808
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:02,000
Oh, God.

2809
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:06,000
You know, Dave and Buster's, of course, it used to be the annual site of my birthday

2810
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:09,240
every year when I would play junk.

2811
02:22:09,240 --> 02:22:10,520
It stopped for some reason.

2812
02:22:10,520 --> 02:22:12,800
Yeah, because they got rid of BattleTech.

2813
02:22:13,560 --> 02:22:19,800
Well, anyhow, Dave and Buster's, along with Comedy Central, VH1, and MTV, that whole network

2814
02:22:19,800 --> 02:22:23,760
thing, is putting on this contest called The Next Big Game Search, and you can see this

2815
02:22:23,760 --> 02:22:26,040
at nextgame.cc.com.

2816
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:27,700
You can fill out a form.

2817
02:22:27,700 --> 02:22:32,760
You can do its ideas, their pitches for a mobile app, larger than life arcade game,

2818
02:22:32,760 --> 02:22:36,120
or simply some improvements for an already classic game.

2819
02:22:36,120 --> 02:22:39,800
You'll be judged on originality, ease of play, family fun, it has to be suitable for people

2820
02:22:39,800 --> 02:22:44,120
of all ages, so some of those nudity games won't be eligible, gameplay experience, and

2821
02:22:44,120 --> 02:22:46,120
difficulty.

2822
02:22:46,120 --> 02:22:52,100
The prizes, the grand prize is Dave and Buster's Create Your Game and Free Games for Life.

2823
02:22:52,100 --> 02:22:57,060
First runner up, $5,000 in gameplay at Dave and Buster's, and second runner up gets $500

2824
02:22:57,060 --> 02:22:58,060
in gameplay.

2825
02:22:58,060 --> 02:23:02,160
The contest runs through July 15th, you have to be a resident of the U.S.

2826
02:23:02,160 --> 02:23:06,240
I'm telling you what, though, if you go and submit an OLR dream game and you win this

2827
02:23:06,240 --> 02:23:13,080
competition, patent pending, and you owe us a chunk of your winnings, just saying,

2828
02:23:13,080 --> 02:23:16,960
you're going to buy us a hell of a nice meal at Dave and Buster's, that's all I'm saying.

2829
02:23:16,960 --> 02:23:19,080
You can record a live from Dave and Buster's.

2830
02:23:19,080 --> 02:23:21,120
Yes, that's right.

2831
02:23:21,120 --> 02:23:23,640
We should go submit some of our favorite dream game ideas into this.

2832
02:23:23,640 --> 02:23:24,640
Just do them all.

2833
02:23:24,640 --> 02:23:25,640
Just do them all.

2834
02:23:25,640 --> 02:23:27,640
This would be fun.

2835
02:23:27,640 --> 02:23:33,240
Can you imagine if the winner, if the winning game out of this was WhatTheyPlay.com Snap

2836
02:23:33,240 --> 02:23:34,440
or Puzzle Sluts?

2837
02:23:34,440 --> 02:23:38,080
No, it has to be for all ages.

2838
02:23:38,080 --> 02:23:41,640
I don't think that the Roosevelt Dave and Buster's has the DDR anymore.

2839
02:23:41,640 --> 02:23:42,640
That's sad.

2840
02:23:42,640 --> 02:23:44,720
Answering Misty in chat room because she asked.

2841
02:23:44,720 --> 02:23:48,320
Besides that, the Roosevelt Dave and Buster's is the size of a closet.

2842
02:23:48,320 --> 02:23:49,320
No one goes there anyway.

2843
02:23:49,320 --> 02:23:52,640
Yeah, when you have a Dave and Buster's that's smaller than the Times Square Dave and Buster's,

2844
02:23:52,640 --> 02:23:53,640
it's a problem.

2845
02:23:53,640 --> 02:23:55,880
All right, let's go to the mailbag.

2846
02:23:55,880 --> 02:24:01,480
Every week you guys email us mailbag at orangelauntrader.com and we sift through the emails that are mixed

2847
02:24:01,480 --> 02:24:05,120
in with all the Asian spam that we get.

2848
02:24:05,120 --> 02:24:06,920
We have a lot of Asian spam this time.

2849
02:24:06,920 --> 02:24:09,640
Oh my god, and Russian spam and French spam.

2850
02:24:09,640 --> 02:24:13,080
It's like just when we thought the French spam and Russian spam was done with.

2851
02:24:13,080 --> 02:24:15,080
Zoot le porn.

2852
02:24:15,080 --> 02:24:16,080
All right, moving on.

2853
02:24:16,080 --> 02:24:20,280
Mailbag at orangelauntrader.com, DarkStalker.io Dive in the mailbag, pull out some emails.

2854
02:24:20,280 --> 02:24:22,280
Okay, hello guys.

2855
02:24:22,280 --> 02:24:23,280
Hello.

2856
02:24:23,280 --> 02:24:25,880
OOR the video game podcast where every gamer has a voice, right?

2857
02:24:25,880 --> 02:24:29,000
Well, I'm going to offer up mine to say girl please.

2858
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,400
Ocarina of Time is not an overrated game.

2859
02:24:31,400 --> 02:24:34,760
It is as deserving of praise just as much as Link to the Past is.

2860
02:24:34,760 --> 02:24:35,760
Next email.

2861
02:24:35,760 --> 02:24:36,760
Hey, Rob.

2862
02:24:36,760 --> 02:24:37,760
Fine.

2863
02:24:37,760 --> 02:24:43,400
To quote a video game, sit your ass down in that chair and drink your goddamn tea.

2864
02:24:43,400 --> 02:24:46,920
Hearts, hearts, hearts, hearts.

2865
02:24:46,920 --> 02:24:48,520
It is, okay, blah, blah, blah.

2866
02:24:48,520 --> 02:24:52,160
The major thing that determines which you have an affinity for is the one you grew up

2867
02:24:52,160 --> 02:24:53,520
playing first.

2868
02:24:53,520 --> 02:24:58,560
Mine obviously was Ocarina, but I also grew up playing Link to the Past on Game Boy Advance.

2869
02:24:59,360 --> 02:25:02,760
I have many fond memories of playing through that game just as I do with Ocarina of Time,

2870
02:25:02,760 --> 02:25:06,680
but Ocarina moved me on a deeper level and made me into the gamer I am today.

2871
02:25:06,680 --> 02:25:10,400
For the record, I actually really like both of them about equally.

2872
02:25:10,400 --> 02:25:12,480
It depends on the mood I'm in.

2873
02:25:12,480 --> 02:25:14,440
Yeah, I really like them both.

2874
02:25:14,440 --> 02:25:16,160
I really like Majora's Mask too.

2875
02:25:16,160 --> 02:25:22,120
It's like I really love lasagna, but I also really, really like sushi.

2876
02:25:22,120 --> 02:25:26,560
I really like Link to the Past, and that's the end of that sentence.

2877
02:25:26,560 --> 02:25:30,160
This brings me to two questions about your opinions on Ocarina of Time, specifically

2878
02:25:30,160 --> 02:25:31,160
for Rob.

2879
02:25:31,160 --> 02:25:32,160
Thank God.

2880
02:25:32,160 --> 02:25:33,160
Rad.

2881
02:25:33,160 --> 02:25:36,120
One, you mentioned that you really like Twilight Princess.

2882
02:25:36,120 --> 02:25:37,760
Hell, I did too.

2883
02:25:37,760 --> 02:25:43,640
I caused a flood warning for all of Northeast Ohio with how much I came buckets over Link

2884
02:25:43,640 --> 02:25:47,960
turning into a wolf.

2885
02:25:47,960 --> 02:25:48,960
Okay.

2886
02:25:48,960 --> 02:25:49,960
Came buckets?

2887
02:25:49,960 --> 02:25:50,960
Whoa.

2888
02:25:50,960 --> 02:25:52,920
I thought I was thinking cried, but it's came buckets.

2889
02:25:52,920 --> 02:25:53,920
Sexy chat.

2890
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:54,920
Sticky.

2891
02:25:55,160 --> 02:25:59,200
But why are you so fond of a game that took a lot of cues from Ocarina of Time?

2892
02:25:59,200 --> 02:26:00,200
Yeah, Rob.

2893
02:26:00,200 --> 02:26:01,200
Why?

2894
02:26:01,200 --> 02:26:02,200
Yeah, Rob.

2895
02:26:02,200 --> 02:26:03,200
Why?

2896
02:26:03,200 --> 02:26:04,200
Because.

2897
02:26:04,200 --> 02:26:05,200
Next question.

2898
02:26:05,200 --> 02:26:08,160
No, especially with all the waggle technology being new, and it was something that was a

2899
02:26:08,160 --> 02:26:12,600
little bit outside of Wii Sports, and I think also kind of getting to see the game with

2900
02:26:12,600 --> 02:26:13,600
more...

2901
02:26:13,600 --> 02:26:17,000
Like in Ocarina of Time, the 3D was still so early on, you had a lot of very blocky

2902
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:20,160
textures and very solid colors and things.

2903
02:26:20,160 --> 02:26:24,800
And I realized at the time there were a lot of people that were very imaginative, and

2904
02:26:24,800 --> 02:26:25,800
it didn't matter.

2905
02:26:25,800 --> 02:26:29,480
But you have to remember there were a lot of us in my generation that grew up on the

2906
02:26:29,480 --> 02:26:30,480
2D games.

2907
02:26:30,480 --> 02:26:33,200
Like you say that Ocarina of Time was from your generation.

2908
02:26:33,200 --> 02:26:36,320
We were a little more stubborn when it came to getting into the 3D.

2909
02:26:36,320 --> 02:26:39,080
Like I was cool with Mario Kart.

2910
02:26:39,080 --> 02:26:40,960
I like Mario 64.

2911
02:26:40,960 --> 02:26:44,160
I don't think it deserves all the praise that it gets.

2912
02:26:44,160 --> 02:26:46,640
Are you an N64 hater?

2913
02:26:46,640 --> 02:26:48,080
I'm not an N64 hater.

2914
02:26:48,080 --> 02:26:52,200
So you're saying you didn't pee your pants when Star Fox came out?

2915
02:26:52,200 --> 02:26:53,480
When the first Star Fox came out?

2916
02:26:53,480 --> 02:26:54,480
No.

2917
02:26:54,480 --> 02:26:55,480
That was the shit when that came out.

2918
02:26:55,480 --> 02:26:56,480
But it was different.

2919
02:26:56,480 --> 02:26:57,480
But it was 3D.

2920
02:26:57,480 --> 02:26:58,480
It was different.

2921
02:26:58,480 --> 02:26:59,480
But it was still on rails.

2922
02:26:59,480 --> 02:27:00,480
It was different.

2923
02:27:00,480 --> 02:27:02,160
I can't explain it.

2924
02:27:02,160 --> 02:27:07,440
But Ocarina of Time, it wasn't quite HD Zelda, but it definitely felt like that next big

2925
02:27:07,440 --> 02:27:15,000
step that the Zelda series needed to take to make it so much more immersive.

2926
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:19,080
Number two, a while back I remember you mentioning that you're not a big fan of Metroid Prime.

2927
02:27:19,080 --> 02:27:22,640
You didn't like the direction Nintendo took the series and that it just didn't have the

2928
02:27:22,640 --> 02:27:25,320
same feeling of the older games like Super Metroid.

2929
02:27:25,320 --> 02:27:28,760
Do you think that this has to do with why you didn't like Ocarina of Time and the fact

2930
02:27:28,760 --> 02:27:31,200
that both games were a shift to 3D?

2931
02:27:31,200 --> 02:27:32,200
Yes.

2932
02:27:32,200 --> 02:27:35,400
But I like Metroid Prime 3 for the record.

2933
02:27:35,400 --> 02:27:40,000
Did you just not like that change in which the game stayed as top-down Zelda or side-scrolling

2934
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,480
Metroid games?

2935
02:27:42,480 --> 02:27:47,960
Yes and no because I still stand pretty hard for Zelda 2, which even Miyamoto himself has

2936
02:27:47,960 --> 02:27:48,960
issues with.

2937
02:27:48,960 --> 02:27:49,960
Yeah.

2938
02:27:49,960 --> 02:27:50,960
I don't like Zelda 2.

2939
02:27:51,960 --> 02:27:54,560
But I'll defend that game as pretty fucking awesome.

2940
02:27:54,560 --> 02:27:55,560
Dan will agree with you.

2941
02:27:55,560 --> 02:27:56,560
Just saying.

2942
02:27:56,560 --> 02:27:57,560
Yeah.

2943
02:27:57,560 --> 02:28:01,840
It's hard as hell, but beating that game when I was a kid, I'm not gonna be able to do that

2944
02:28:01,840 --> 02:28:02,840
again.

2945
02:28:02,840 --> 02:28:03,840
I've tried.

2946
02:28:03,840 --> 02:28:05,160
That's tough.

2947
02:28:05,160 --> 02:28:07,920
What do you think about Wind Waker?

2948
02:28:07,920 --> 02:28:11,400
I honestly didn't play enough of it.

2949
02:28:11,400 --> 02:28:13,280
I didn't play enough of it.

2950
02:28:13,280 --> 02:28:15,240
Dan beat Wind Waker and he really liked it.

2951
02:28:15,240 --> 02:28:17,000
I just couldn't get into it.

2952
02:28:17,040 --> 02:28:20,960
If I can borrow the HD one or get it on Gamefly or something, I'll give it another try.

2953
02:28:20,960 --> 02:28:23,360
Well, Rob, I can lend you mine.

2954
02:28:23,360 --> 02:28:28,280
Well, you know, there's the HD remake coming out on the US Play Store.

2955
02:28:28,280 --> 02:28:30,080
Oh, you and your HD.

2956
02:28:30,080 --> 02:28:31,080
Why not?

2957
02:28:31,080 --> 02:28:35,080
Thanks for reading and sorry for the slightly longer email, but I just got to defend my

2958
02:28:35,080 --> 02:28:38,880
first and favorite gaming love that is Ocarina of Time and that's from Ospher.

2959
02:28:38,880 --> 02:28:41,000
Well, every gamer has a voice even when they're-

2960
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,840
And I don't need to know about you coming bucket.

2961
02:28:43,840 --> 02:28:46,160
Every gamer has a voice even when their opinions are not correct.

2962
02:28:46,160 --> 02:28:47,160
There's a PS.

2963
02:28:47,160 --> 02:28:48,160
Oh, that was Ospher?

2964
02:28:48,160 --> 02:28:49,160
Yeah.

2965
02:28:49,160 --> 02:28:50,160
I'm not surprised about the coming buckets.

2966
02:28:50,160 --> 02:28:53,480
Yeah, because Twilight Princess has, like, nevermind.

2967
02:28:53,480 --> 02:28:56,600
I actually just finished a playthrough of Ocarina of Time last night with one of my

2968
02:28:56,600 --> 02:28:57,600
close friends.

2969
02:28:57,600 --> 02:29:01,880
We took turns playing through the dungeons and reminiscing on how we grew up while playing

2970
02:29:01,880 --> 02:29:02,880
it as kids.

2971
02:29:02,880 --> 02:29:04,800
After the end credits, we were both pretty teary-eyed.

2972
02:29:04,800 --> 02:29:07,080
You know, so play it again.

2973
02:29:07,080 --> 02:29:08,080
You know what?

2974
02:29:08,080 --> 02:29:14,560
I actually not too long ago played through Ocarina on the GameCube redo disc.

2975
02:29:14,560 --> 02:29:16,800
You need to get the 3DS version.

2976
02:29:16,800 --> 02:29:17,800
It's really good.

2977
02:29:17,800 --> 02:29:21,080
I still wanted 40 bucks for it and they're charging a premium for it because it's out

2978
02:29:21,080 --> 02:29:22,080
of print now.

2979
02:29:22,080 --> 02:29:23,080
Oh.

2980
02:29:23,080 --> 02:29:26,600
Um, by the way, I just want to make sure this is very clear.

2981
02:29:26,600 --> 02:29:28,360
I don't hate Ocarina of Time.

2982
02:29:28,360 --> 02:29:32,400
I never have and I've never said that word on the show in regards to Ocarina of Time.

2983
02:29:32,400 --> 02:29:37,000
I just don't lavish all the praise upon it that many other people do.

2984
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:38,000
I think it's a good game.

2985
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:39,200
In fact, I think it's a great game.

2986
02:29:39,200 --> 02:29:42,280
I just don't think it's in my top 20.

2987
02:29:42,280 --> 02:29:43,520
Rob, you like it.

2988
02:29:43,520 --> 02:29:45,280
You just don't like like it.

2989
02:29:45,280 --> 02:29:46,280
Exactly.

2990
02:29:46,280 --> 02:29:47,280
You wouldn't date it.

2991
02:29:47,280 --> 02:29:48,440
I wouldn't eat it shield.

2992
02:29:48,440 --> 02:29:50,120
You'd go to Pinkberry with it, but you wouldn't date it.

2993
02:29:50,120 --> 02:29:51,120
Get it?

2994
02:29:51,120 --> 02:29:52,120
Because I don't like like it.

2995
02:29:52,120 --> 02:29:53,120
Ha ha ha ha ha.

2996
02:29:53,120 --> 02:29:55,120
That was a Zelda joke, people!

2997
02:29:55,120 --> 02:29:56,120
Awww.

2998
02:29:56,120 --> 02:29:57,120
Hey.

2999
02:29:57,120 --> 02:29:58,120
I try.

3000
02:29:58,120 --> 02:30:00,800
Mwah mwah mwah mwah.

3001
02:30:00,800 --> 02:30:01,800
Last email.

3002
02:30:01,800 --> 02:30:04,080
Um, this is from Sam.

3003
02:30:04,080 --> 02:30:05,080
Hi, Sam.

3004
02:30:05,080 --> 02:30:06,840
Hello, OLR crew.

3005
02:30:06,840 --> 02:30:07,840
I love the show.

3006
02:30:07,840 --> 02:30:12,160
If the devs stop making single player games, are we really any better off than we were

3007
02:30:12,160 --> 02:30:13,880
before Microsoft's change in plans?

3008
02:30:13,880 --> 02:30:14,880
What do you all think?

3009
02:30:14,880 --> 02:30:16,640
First of all, I don't think the single player games are going away.

3010
02:30:16,640 --> 02:30:18,120
No, single player games won't go away.

3011
02:30:18,120 --> 02:30:20,060
There will always be a demand for single player games.

3012
02:30:20,060 --> 02:30:22,040
There are always antisocial people.

3013
02:30:22,040 --> 02:30:27,440
However, I can see where this guy, unless Sam is for Samantha, could be guy or girl,

3014
02:30:27,440 --> 02:30:38,200
but I'm going to assume guy, where this individual, our lovely writer, where this individual is

3015
02:30:38,200 --> 02:30:40,880
getting this from, because it does seem like a lot of single player games that have come

3016
02:30:40,880 --> 02:30:43,320
out lately have a multiplayer mode suddenly in it.

3017
02:30:43,320 --> 02:30:44,320
What?

3018
02:30:44,320 --> 02:30:45,320
Just within the past few months.

3019
02:30:45,320 --> 02:30:46,320
Tomb Raider.

3020
02:30:46,320 --> 02:30:47,320
Tomb Raider.

3021
02:30:47,320 --> 02:30:48,320
Uncharted 3.

3022
02:30:48,320 --> 02:30:49,320
Last of Us.

3023
02:30:49,320 --> 02:30:50,320
Mass Effect 3.

3024
02:30:50,320 --> 02:30:52,800
Like all the Assassin's Creed ones, even though it's a little bit older.

3025
02:30:52,800 --> 02:30:53,800
Assassin's Creed 3.

3026
02:30:53,800 --> 02:30:55,760
They all have multiplayer modes in them.

3027
02:30:55,760 --> 02:31:00,160
Now, I don't think in any of these cases they've necessarily detracted from the single player

3028
02:31:00,160 --> 02:31:03,600
game, although some people kind of resented that you kind of had to play multiplayer to

3029
02:31:03,600 --> 02:31:05,200
get the edge in Mass Effect 3.

3030
02:31:05,200 --> 02:31:06,200
That's true.

3031
02:31:06,200 --> 02:31:08,600
But Mass Effect 3 multiplayer is great, so whatever.

3032
02:31:08,600 --> 02:31:09,600
Yeah, that's the thing.

3033
02:31:09,600 --> 02:31:10,600
That's the thing.

3034
02:31:10,600 --> 02:31:11,600
It's great.

3035
02:31:11,600 --> 02:31:15,000
It also gives the games more replay value, I guess you could say.

3036
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:16,000
I still have yet to-

3037
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:19,600
Although, for Mass Effect fans, replay value is going and making another Shepard.

3038
02:31:19,600 --> 02:31:20,600
Let's be real.

3039
02:31:20,600 --> 02:31:21,600
You know what?

3040
02:31:21,600 --> 02:31:24,600
Okay, and this is the funny thing.

3041
02:31:24,600 --> 02:31:28,280
I'm now on my third playthrough of the first game, because I'm braving the motion sickness.

3042
02:31:28,280 --> 02:31:32,040
I've beaten two and three 27 bajillion times.

3043
02:31:32,040 --> 02:31:37,760
The fun for that for me is making a new Shepard and completely hacking everything I can possibly

3044
02:31:37,760 --> 02:31:40,160
hack about the appearance.

3045
02:31:40,160 --> 02:31:47,160
I have one wearing Ashley's face like it's ripped off of her flesh as she died on Vermaier.

3046
02:31:47,160 --> 02:31:48,160
Wow.

3047
02:31:48,160 --> 02:31:52,480
And wearing Warren's outfit.

3048
02:31:52,480 --> 02:31:54,480
She has been referred to as Hobag Ashley.

3049
02:31:54,480 --> 02:32:01,480
So, in my discussion there, the original question was Xbox One something- I think you closed

3050
02:32:01,480 --> 02:32:02,480
the email, huh?

3051
02:32:02,480 --> 02:32:03,480
I did.

3052
02:32:03,480 --> 02:32:08,360
Do you think that single players are going away from the past?

3053
02:32:08,360 --> 02:32:11,520
I don't think it was necessarily going away, but I think it has something to do with as

3054
02:32:11,520 --> 02:32:12,920
they fade more and more.

3055
02:32:12,920 --> 02:32:15,760
Is Microsoft's decision a bad one?

3056
02:32:15,760 --> 02:32:25,760
Well, now that they- Well, I still think if Microsoft wanted to- Here's the thing.

3057
02:32:25,760 --> 02:32:30,320
If Microsoft wanted to try and push digital, then there's no reason they can't run two

3058
02:32:30,320 --> 02:32:32,160
separate license systems.

3059
02:32:32,160 --> 02:32:35,520
Your disk-based license and your digital-based license.

3060
02:32:35,520 --> 02:32:38,600
Why not enhance the digital license?

3061
02:32:38,600 --> 02:32:41,960
You know, Nintendo dipped their little pinky in the water when they said, well, if you

3062
02:32:41,960 --> 02:32:46,240
buy the game digitally, you'll get 5%- Was it 10% back in points, which you can trade

3063
02:32:46,240 --> 02:32:47,520
in for cards, right?

3064
02:32:47,520 --> 02:32:52,240
A little bit of- It's a tiny ass incentive, but it's some incentive to get the game online.

3065
02:32:52,240 --> 02:32:54,560
What if Microsoft said, okay, we're going to one up that.

3066
02:32:54,560 --> 02:32:59,240
So, when you digitally buy the game, here's the perk you get over getting it on disk,

3067
02:32:59,400 --> 02:33:03,120
is that you can now share this digital game with a friend.

3068
02:33:03,120 --> 02:33:06,920
You can loan it out to a friend across the country instantly.

3069
02:33:06,920 --> 02:33:08,200
That's the perk you get with it.

3070
02:33:08,200 --> 02:33:10,440
Why can't they run both licenses?

3071
02:33:10,440 --> 02:33:11,960
They can do it.

3072
02:33:11,960 --> 02:33:14,280
It will take time to develop and so on.

3073
02:33:14,280 --> 02:33:20,400
I think if Microsoft really wants to, for the Xbox 2, or whatever their next generation

3074
02:33:20,400 --> 02:33:24,360
system is called after this, assuming this box doesn't kill the company, but I don't

3075
02:33:24,360 --> 02:33:33,840
think it will, they could start getting people used to the idea of digital and why it's better.

3076
02:33:33,840 --> 02:33:39,120
As opposed to, nope, we're going to change the whole fucking thing right now.

3077
02:33:39,120 --> 02:33:40,640
We're turning your world upside down.

3078
02:33:40,640 --> 02:33:46,280
Yeah, even though I don't approve of a lot of what the Xbox One was trying to do, I do

3079
02:33:46,280 --> 02:33:49,840
think it's a shame that we didn't see how it could have developed.

3080
02:33:49,840 --> 02:33:53,160
The positive was never clearly communicated, only the negative.

3081
02:33:53,160 --> 02:33:54,920
Yeah, lesson learned, hopefully.

3082
02:33:56,600 --> 02:33:58,600
Anyhow, that was it for Mailbag, right?

3083
02:33:58,600 --> 02:33:59,240
That was.

3084
02:33:59,240 --> 02:34:02,600
Well then that means we get to the FUs of the week.

3085
02:34:02,600 --> 02:34:05,640
Every week here on this show, we let out a little angst.

3086
02:34:05,640 --> 02:34:06,120
Why?

3087
02:34:06,120 --> 02:34:08,680
Because we're just really angry people.

3088
02:34:23,160 --> 02:34:31,880
You know, I hate bringing up traffic, but this was really fucking stupid.

3089
02:34:31,880 --> 02:34:37,080
When I was driving over that same bridge, over across the American River, coming this

3090
02:34:37,080 --> 02:34:45,480
way to your place, Rob, someone was freaking tailgating me during all that road construction-wise.

3091
02:34:45,480 --> 02:34:50,760
With a cop, expecting me to speed, and I'm like, no.

3092
02:34:50,760 --> 02:34:55,000
And I know everybody and their twin goes 20 miles over the speed limit over that bridge,

3093
02:34:55,000 --> 02:35:00,120
but I was about to do it while there was a CHP parked off to the side.

3094
02:35:00,120 --> 02:35:05,640
Sorry, your convenience isn't worth me having a $300 ticket.

3095
02:35:05,640 --> 02:35:06,920
Loki?

3096
02:35:06,920 --> 02:35:08,920
Fuck you to hand, foot, and mouth disease.

3097
02:35:08,920 --> 02:35:11,800
I don't like having blisters on my hands and feet.

3098
02:35:11,800 --> 02:35:13,480
Or my mouth.

3099
02:35:13,480 --> 02:35:15,080
Slidekick, why don't you go next?

3100
02:35:15,080 --> 02:35:21,800
I want to say FU to the lady in the Target parking lot who gave me a very pressed look

3101
02:35:21,800 --> 02:35:24,520
when I was trying to leave.

3102
02:35:24,520 --> 02:35:31,320
I'm sorry that I delayed you 10 seconds getting to your car so you could go home and eat your

3103
02:35:31,320 --> 02:35:32,600
Panda Express.

3104
02:35:32,600 --> 02:35:34,360
I'm sure it just ruined your day.

3105
02:35:34,360 --> 02:35:36,120
That orange chicken just fucking-

3106
02:35:36,120 --> 02:35:37,160
She glared at me.

3107
02:35:37,160 --> 02:35:38,440
She's like, fine, go.

3108
02:35:38,440 --> 02:35:40,760
The orange chicken would not stay warm in this weather.

3109
02:35:40,760 --> 02:35:45,560
Oh, by the way, I'd like to add a thank you to you.

3110
02:35:45,560 --> 02:35:46,760
Aww.

3111
02:35:46,760 --> 02:35:49,240
Thank you so much for facilitating the crack.

3112
02:35:49,800 --> 02:35:52,840
And thank you for the Groupon for brunch.

3113
02:35:52,840 --> 02:35:57,080
Hey, hey, hey, no rainbow and sunshine shit in the FU segment.

3114
02:35:57,080 --> 02:35:58,120
You better watch it.

3115
02:35:58,120 --> 02:35:58,840
FU Rob.

3116
02:35:58,840 --> 02:35:59,960
Yeah, FU Rob.

3117
02:35:59,960 --> 02:36:01,080
Just kidding, I love you.

3118
02:36:01,080 --> 02:36:01,800
I-L-U.

3119
02:36:01,800 --> 02:36:02,520
FU both.

3120
02:36:02,520 --> 02:36:03,320
Here's my finger.

3121
02:36:04,040 --> 02:36:05,480
Should do an I-L-U section.

3122
02:36:07,480 --> 02:36:09,080
You want to do an I love yous of the week?

3123
02:36:09,080 --> 02:36:10,680
Wait, hold on, because I got to get my FU out.

3124
02:36:11,560 --> 02:36:15,800
Fuck you to this goddamn shitty fucking hateful heat.

3125
02:36:15,800 --> 02:36:16,920
Amen.

3126
02:36:16,920 --> 02:36:18,760
Tim TRP in chat agrees.

3127
02:36:18,760 --> 02:36:19,240
All right.

3128
02:36:19,240 --> 02:36:20,120
It is hateful.

3129
02:36:20,120 --> 02:36:22,520
That's a good word for a Rob, it's hateful.

3130
02:36:22,520 --> 02:36:22,840
Okay.

3131
02:36:22,840 --> 02:36:24,280
I'm sliding on the chair.

3132
02:36:24,280 --> 02:36:24,680
Okay.

3133
02:36:24,680 --> 02:36:27,560
It's time for the I-L-U's of the week.

3134
02:36:29,320 --> 02:36:31,320
Yes, I'm using the same music bumper twice.

3135
02:36:31,320 --> 02:36:33,240
It's the I-L-U's of the week.

3136
02:36:33,240 --> 02:36:34,440
I love you KBB.

3137
02:36:36,280 --> 02:36:37,240
Dark Sakura.

3138
02:36:38,200 --> 02:36:40,680
Thank you for the 3DS.

3139
02:36:40,680 --> 02:36:41,320
Slack kick.

3140
02:36:41,320 --> 02:36:42,920
You are my hero forever.

3141
02:36:43,640 --> 02:36:46,440
And I have Animal Crossing now.

3142
02:36:46,440 --> 02:36:48,680
Thank you because you facilitated it.

3143
02:36:48,680 --> 02:36:50,680
And I'm glad you enjoyed your sausage.

3144
02:36:52,120 --> 02:36:54,120
Oh, I always enjoy my sausage.

3145
02:36:54,680 --> 02:37:01,640
And I have to say I-L-U to Dark Sakura for the Groupon for brunch and for sharing her

3146
02:37:01,640 --> 02:37:02,520
French toast with me.

3147
02:37:02,520 --> 02:37:03,320
It was so good.

3148
02:37:03,320 --> 02:37:09,880
Oh, we should, Sam's should just be a sponsor for, you know.

3149
02:37:09,880 --> 02:37:15,320
And I'm going to give my I-L-U of the week to Alan because he's over there in the kitchen

3150
02:37:15,320 --> 02:37:16,520
clearly making dinner.

3151
02:37:17,080 --> 02:37:18,680
You can't hear the foil in the background.

3152
02:37:18,680 --> 02:37:19,800
Oh, being so domestic.

3153
02:37:19,800 --> 02:37:21,080
You've got an I-L-U, right?

3154
02:37:21,080 --> 02:37:21,640
Nope.

3155
02:37:21,640 --> 02:37:26,120
You know, you know, the quickest way to a man's heart is through his stomach.

3156
02:37:26,120 --> 02:37:28,200
So no, it's through the rib cage.

3157
02:37:29,800 --> 02:37:32,120
Loki, what's your I-L-U of the week?

3158
02:37:32,120 --> 02:37:32,840
I don't have one.

3159
02:37:32,840 --> 02:37:33,340
Sorry.

3160
02:37:34,120 --> 02:37:34,600
What?

3161
02:37:34,600 --> 02:37:35,640
You grumpy cat.

3162
02:37:35,640 --> 02:37:38,760
I love the fact it's really sweltering hot in here.

3163
02:37:38,760 --> 02:37:39,400
That's great.

3164
02:37:40,520 --> 02:37:41,400
There's nothing I can do.

3165
02:37:41,400 --> 02:37:43,240
You don't have I-L-U to breadsticks?

3166
02:37:43,240 --> 02:37:45,480
I-L-U to these five fans.

3167
02:37:45,480 --> 02:37:50,200
One, two, three, four, five.

3168
02:37:50,200 --> 02:37:52,200
And all your fans in the chat room.

3169
02:37:52,920 --> 02:37:54,840
Oh, all right.

3170
02:37:54,840 --> 02:37:55,560
Oops, sorry.

3171
02:37:56,360 --> 02:37:57,960
That was not meant to be followed by Holik.

3172
02:37:58,920 --> 02:38:00,680
Everything is meant to be followed by Holik.

3173
02:38:00,680 --> 02:38:04,200
All right, moving on.

3174
02:38:04,200 --> 02:38:09,480
Loki, if you could possibly do the next story.

3175
02:38:09,480 --> 02:38:10,280
Sure.

3176
02:38:10,280 --> 02:38:18,920
Okay, so unfortunately there was a little bit of an issue with the precursor games.

3177
02:38:19,640 --> 02:38:23,880
Apparently, writer, game designer, and artist Ken McColl,

3178
02:38:24,920 --> 02:38:27,960
he was arrested for possession of child pornography.

3179
02:38:27,960 --> 02:38:31,000
That's not good.

3180
02:38:32,360 --> 02:38:34,680
So, of course, no, that's definitely not good.

3181
02:38:34,680 --> 02:38:38,360
So, of course, you know, the company is now distancing themselves from,

3182
02:38:38,360 --> 02:38:42,440
you know, their co-founder, and he doesn't have anything to do now,

3183
02:38:42,440 --> 02:38:47,080
obviously, with Shadows of the Eternals, which, you know.

3184
02:38:47,960 --> 02:38:52,360
Every time I hear Shadow of the Eternal now, I just, I hear this as the theme song.

3185
02:38:52,360 --> 02:39:01,000
Yeah, as if Precursor needed any more bad press, honestly.

3186
02:39:01,960 --> 02:39:02,280
Right?

3187
02:39:03,800 --> 02:39:05,480
It's, yeah, that sucks.

3188
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:08,440
Oh, well, what are you gonna do?

3189
02:39:08,440 --> 02:39:11,320
I mean, that's all you can do.

3190
02:39:11,320 --> 02:39:14,200
Well, for one, don't download child pornography.

3191
02:39:14,200 --> 02:39:15,320
That's not good.

3192
02:39:15,320 --> 02:39:16,200
That's gross.

3193
02:39:16,920 --> 02:39:17,960
It's beyond gross.

3194
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,800
By the way, Rob, did you hear about the 12-year-old girl

3195
02:39:21,800 --> 02:39:26,920
who shamed a guy in her room janking off over her into leaving?

3196
02:39:26,920 --> 02:39:27,800
Ew!

3197
02:39:27,800 --> 02:39:28,600
What?

3198
02:39:28,600 --> 02:39:30,840
Yeah, it was, what was it?

3199
02:39:30,840 --> 02:39:34,920
It was, it was on the, um, I read it on, like, some news thing.

3200
02:39:34,920 --> 02:39:37,880
It was, like, a legit news thing where this 12-year-old girl says,

3201
02:39:37,880 --> 02:39:39,720
you need to be ashamed of yourself.

3202
02:39:39,720 --> 02:39:40,040
Leave.

3203
02:39:40,680 --> 02:39:41,240
And he did.

3204
02:39:42,200 --> 02:39:44,040
The internet's disgusting.

3205
02:39:44,920 --> 02:39:46,120
Disgusting place.

3206
02:39:46,120 --> 02:39:48,040
Well, no, this was a real life thing, but.

3207
02:39:48,600 --> 02:39:49,320
Well, it's just.

3208
02:39:50,200 --> 02:39:50,840
I have a story.

3209
02:39:50,920 --> 02:39:51,800
That was a weird tangent.

3210
02:39:51,800 --> 02:39:53,400
That was a very weird tangent.

3211
02:39:53,400 --> 02:39:55,000
Our soccer took the show to an awkward place.

3212
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:58,600
People who are just awful people need to be ashamed of themselves.

3213
02:40:00,760 --> 02:40:05,240
All right, uh, moving on to, uh, a campaign about something that really

3214
02:40:05,240 --> 02:40:09,240
pisses people off about the Wii U, and that is region locking.

3215
02:40:09,240 --> 02:40:12,120
You know, I guess some of the fans out there are hoping, you know,

3216
02:40:12,120 --> 02:40:17,400
if Operation Rainfall worked and Microsoft ended up reversing Corus on a lot of their shit,

3217
02:40:17,400 --> 02:40:21,880
maybe, just maybe, we can get Nintendo to end region locking.

3218
02:40:21,880 --> 02:40:25,480
And they're taking to Twitter, you know, because Twitter is a very effective way of protesting.

3219
02:40:25,480 --> 02:40:28,680
Well, it worked for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

3220
02:40:28,680 --> 02:40:32,120
End region locking and Nintendo region free are some hashtags.

3221
02:40:33,240 --> 02:40:38,200
There's, um, let's see, some posts on Miiverse as well, which are actually kind of funny.

3222
02:40:38,200 --> 02:40:40,520
Like, I love some of these Miiverse posts.

3223
02:40:40,520 --> 02:40:43,800
I love the one of Monita with, uh, region free, please.

3224
02:40:43,800 --> 02:40:44,440
That's great.

3225
02:40:45,080 --> 02:40:47,960
And then like a picture of Reggie Fils-Aime, I guess that's supposed to be him.

3226
02:40:47,960 --> 02:40:49,880
My body is region free.

3227
02:40:49,880 --> 02:40:54,600
So it's kind of clever that they're, uh, taking to Miiverse to put some of their opinions.

3228
02:40:54,600 --> 02:40:55,480
It won't happen.

3229
02:40:55,480 --> 02:40:56,520
No, it probably won't happen.

3230
02:40:57,080 --> 02:40:59,320
You know, the thing is, is that Nintendo seems to be really,

3231
02:41:00,920 --> 02:41:03,960
they seem to be trying to bring over a lot of stuff that, you know,

3232
02:41:03,960 --> 02:41:05,400
maybe in the past they wouldn't have.

3233
02:41:05,400 --> 02:41:09,000
I mean, Fire Emblem is the thing that we can basically expect at this point,

3234
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:12,600
but also like Bravely Default, you know, that was kind of uncertain,

3235
02:41:12,600 --> 02:41:14,520
but Nintendo is helping bring that over.

3236
02:41:14,520 --> 02:41:19,640
So even though it would be nice if the Wii U was region free,

3237
02:41:19,640 --> 02:41:22,920
I think that Nintendo is really trying to listen to gamers

3238
02:41:22,920 --> 02:41:27,560
and know that they want these games that are, that are over in Japan.

3239
02:41:28,680 --> 02:41:29,240
Let's hope.

3240
02:41:30,280 --> 02:41:30,680
All right.

3241
02:41:30,680 --> 02:41:34,520
Well, that brings us closer and closer to the end of the show,

3242
02:41:34,520 --> 02:41:37,640
but, uh, we are going to open up the Skype line right now

3243
02:41:37,640 --> 02:41:39,880
to get some of your voices here on the show.

3244
02:41:39,880 --> 02:41:44,040
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

3245
02:41:44,040 --> 02:41:44,920
That's all one word.

3246
02:41:44,920 --> 02:41:47,160
We are taking your calls right now.

3247
02:41:47,160 --> 02:41:48,840
We'll get to some Twitter topics as well.

3248
02:41:48,840 --> 02:41:50,280
And also any last minute stories.

3249
02:41:50,280 --> 02:41:53,400
I don't know if Dark Soccer or Loki have anything they want to get out real quick.

3250
02:41:53,400 --> 02:41:55,160
I think I just have, I want to get out of the heat.

3251
02:41:56,360 --> 02:42:00,040
Sim City has a wonderful new piece of DLC for $9.

3252
02:42:00,040 --> 02:42:01,080
It's Zeppelin's.

3253
02:42:02,200 --> 02:42:07,960
You get, you get an airship and a hot air balloon park as an, uh, basic.

3254
02:42:08,200 --> 02:42:09,880
Is it piloted by a guy named Sid?

3255
02:42:09,880 --> 02:42:10,600
I don't know.

3256
02:42:10,600 --> 02:42:15,320
Hot air balloon park or an airship and an airship mass transit option.

3257
02:42:15,320 --> 02:42:15,880
$9.

3258
02:42:15,880 --> 02:42:17,480
That's all you get for $9.

3259
02:42:17,480 --> 02:42:19,560
Will it explode like the Hindenburg did?

3260
02:42:19,560 --> 02:42:22,280
I mean, I mean, not to be in poor taste, but.

3261
02:42:22,280 --> 02:42:23,080
Too soon, Rob.

3262
02:42:23,080 --> 02:42:23,560
Too soon.

3263
02:42:23,560 --> 02:42:24,840
Thanks to the power of cloud.

3264
02:42:24,840 --> 02:42:27,160
Part of Sim City is disasters, right?

3265
02:42:27,800 --> 02:42:28,200
Yeah.

3266
02:42:28,200 --> 02:42:29,640
Sim City was a disaster.

3267
02:42:31,960 --> 02:42:32,600
Oh boy.

3268
02:42:32,600 --> 02:42:34,520
It wouldn't be the same without the reporter.

3269
02:42:34,520 --> 02:42:34,840
All right.

3270
02:42:34,840 --> 02:42:36,920
Let's go to the phones because we do have calls coming in.

3271
02:42:36,920 --> 02:42:37,880
Hi, you're on orange songs radio.

3272
02:42:37,880 --> 02:42:38,280
Who's this?

3273
02:42:38,920 --> 02:42:39,400
Hello.

3274
02:42:40,120 --> 02:42:40,360
Hello.

3275
02:42:40,360 --> 02:42:41,320
It's code man.

3276
02:42:41,320 --> 02:42:42,040
Hey, code man.

3277
02:42:42,040 --> 02:42:42,520
How you doing?

3278
02:42:43,160 --> 02:42:44,440
I haven't called in in a while.

3279
02:42:44,440 --> 02:42:45,480
I was going to say a long time.

3280
02:42:45,480 --> 02:42:45,880
No talk.

3281
02:42:45,880 --> 02:42:47,080
What's on your mind, buddy?

3282
02:42:47,080 --> 02:42:49,880
Well, you know, it's, it's busy everywhere.

3283
02:42:50,520 --> 02:42:53,160
Real life is not allowed to get in the way of OLR.

3284
02:42:53,160 --> 02:42:53,480
Okay.

3285
02:42:53,480 --> 02:42:54,120
Thanks.

3286
02:42:54,120 --> 02:42:54,840
It never does.

3287
02:42:55,880 --> 02:42:56,680
Good answer.

3288
02:42:56,680 --> 02:42:57,560
What's up, buddy?

3289
02:42:58,280 --> 02:43:03,240
Um, no, I was just calling, um, about the whole YouTube thing earlier because,

3290
02:43:03,240 --> 02:43:06,440
you know, I, I'm your friendly neighborhood YouTuber, I guess.

3291
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:14,280
Um, but, uh, they, they're actually starting to monetize for minutes watched now.

3292
02:43:14,280 --> 02:43:20,200
So like, it's not so much your video anymore as it is the minutes of like,

3293
02:43:20,200 --> 02:43:21,960
how long somebody watches your video.

3294
02:43:23,720 --> 02:43:25,880
So, so, I mean, it's, it's really, I don't know.

3295
02:43:25,880 --> 02:43:31,000
They keep changing it, but, um, to say something about, I believe square enix

3296
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:37,160
or Squeenix as a lot of people say, um, is they did that for a really long time.

3297
02:43:37,160 --> 02:43:40,280
They would take, they wouldn't let anyone put any of their games up,

3298
02:43:40,280 --> 02:43:43,480
which I always see it as free advertisement for the company.

3299
02:43:43,480 --> 02:43:46,280
But I mean, you're playing their game.

3300
02:43:46,280 --> 02:43:47,080
People are watching it.

3301
02:43:47,080 --> 02:43:49,000
They say, Oh, you know, this is a really good game.

3302
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:49,800
I want to buy it.

3303
02:43:49,800 --> 02:43:52,920
So then they go out and buy it and then that's free advertisement.

3304
02:43:52,920 --> 02:43:56,520
So to me, that's, I mean, that's the way, but I see, I see where everybody's

3305
02:43:56,520 --> 02:43:59,720
coming from, where, you know, you're playing this game, you're, you're

3306
02:43:59,720 --> 02:44:05,160
claiming it as your own video, but it's actually just your voice over

3307
02:44:05,160 --> 02:44:07,160
something else that somebody else made.

3308
02:44:07,160 --> 02:44:12,440
And I can understand that, but, but yeah, that's, I just want to call in

3309
02:44:12,440 --> 02:44:14,760
and, uh, kind of, cause I, cause I missed that whole conversation.

3310
02:44:14,760 --> 02:44:19,640
I had to go put the girl down to sleep, but, uh, but yeah, I just wanted to

3311
02:44:19,640 --> 02:44:22,280
kind of call in and talk about that a little bit.

3312
02:44:22,280 --> 02:44:23,000
No worries.

3313
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:25,800
Um, you probably aren't surprised to hear that people make a living off

3314
02:44:25,800 --> 02:44:27,000
those let's play videos though.

3315
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:27,500
Right?

3316
02:44:28,220 --> 02:44:33,100
Um, there's a lot of people, uh, out there, a lot of really, really big

3317
02:44:33,100 --> 02:44:38,860
YouTubers that make a huge, huge killing off of, uh, off of just doing

3318
02:44:38,860 --> 02:44:42,220
let's plays and doing, uh, Minecraft's real big right now.

3319
02:44:42,220 --> 02:44:45,260
Uh, there's, there's just tons of people out there making so much money

3320
02:44:45,260 --> 02:44:46,140
off of that.

3321
02:44:46,140 --> 02:44:50,780
And yeah, to an extent you make a lot of money, but I don't really think

3322
02:44:50,780 --> 02:44:55,420
unless, unless you partner with a third party, I don't really think, which

3323
02:44:55,420 --> 02:44:57,740
sometimes you kind of get screwed out of that money too.

3324
02:44:57,740 --> 02:45:02,780
So, you know, either way, if you, if you manage yourself correctly on

3325
02:45:02,780 --> 02:45:07,100
YouTube, I think you can make a good amount of money, but other than that,

3326
02:45:07,100 --> 02:45:11,260
I do it just to do it and, and, you know, to show people what I'm playing

3327
02:45:11,260 --> 02:45:13,020
and, you know, all that stuff.

3328
02:45:13,020 --> 02:45:15,180
I mean, I don't do it for the money obviously, cause I'm not making

3329
02:45:15,180 --> 02:45:19,900
anything from it, but, um, but it's just fun to do to me and I love video

3330
02:45:19,900 --> 02:45:20,940
editing and all that stuff.

3331
02:45:20,940 --> 02:45:21,980
So that's what it's got.

3332
02:45:21,980 --> 02:45:23,260
It's like podcasting.

3333
02:45:23,260 --> 02:45:25,660
And I've said this before on an earlier show, if you don't love it, what

3334
02:45:25,660 --> 02:45:26,860
the hell are you doing?

3335
02:45:26,860 --> 02:45:27,500
Well, exactly.

3336
02:45:27,500 --> 02:45:31,100
If you get into YouTube to make money, you're getting into the, you're

3337
02:45:31,100 --> 02:45:32,380
getting into the wrong reasons.

3338
02:45:32,380 --> 02:45:35,500
It's like those companies that are like, we need to hire an agency to make

3339
02:45:35,500 --> 02:45:36,620
a viral video.

3340
02:45:36,620 --> 02:45:40,300
Um, you don't force something to go viral that has to like happen, you

3341
02:45:40,300 --> 02:45:40,540
know?

3342
02:45:40,540 --> 02:45:41,100
Well, no.

3343
02:45:41,100 --> 02:45:42,540
Yeah, that's, that's totally true.

3344
02:45:42,540 --> 02:45:44,140
And you know, that's, that's great.

3345
02:45:44,140 --> 02:45:49,100
Oh, and I also wanted to say, I, you will have a, a buffer from, uh, from

3346
02:45:49,100 --> 02:45:53,180
a one-year-old, uh, well, actually from a, well, she'll be two probably

3347
02:45:53,180 --> 02:45:57,020
by the time that I make the buffer, but I got her to say orange today,

3348
02:45:57,020 --> 02:45:59,820
but, uh, she has to put all of them together.

3349
02:45:59,820 --> 02:46:01,900
I haven't got adorable.

3350
02:46:03,100 --> 02:46:05,740
So that's, that should be fantastic.

3351
02:46:05,740 --> 02:46:06,940
So excited to hear it.

3352
02:46:08,060 --> 02:46:08,380
All right.

3353
02:46:08,380 --> 02:46:11,260
Uh, yeah, that's, I think that's about it really.

3354
02:46:11,260 --> 02:46:15,900
Uh, so, I mean, yeah, I just, I was up late tonight, so I thought I'd

3355
02:46:15,900 --> 02:46:17,500
give you guys a call cause I haven't talked to you in a while.

3356
02:46:17,900 --> 02:46:18,940
Always good to hear from you.

3357
02:46:18,940 --> 02:46:19,100
Yeah.

3358
02:46:19,100 --> 02:46:20,380
Always good to hear from you.

3359
02:46:20,380 --> 02:46:22,140
Uh, you, it's, it's good to hear from you.

3360
02:46:22,140 --> 02:46:25,500
You take care and, uh, I hope everybody's doing well out there in Oklahoma.

3361
02:46:25,500 --> 02:46:28,620
I'm glad to see you've been okay throughout all the, I mean, here I am

3362
02:46:28,620 --> 02:46:29,660
bitching about the heat.

3363
02:46:29,660 --> 02:46:30,700
That was a bad pun.

3364
02:46:30,700 --> 02:46:32,380
At least I don't have what I didn't even.

3365
02:46:32,380 --> 02:46:33,180
He's okay.

3366
02:46:33,180 --> 02:46:34,540
Oh God, shut up.

3367
02:46:34,540 --> 02:46:36,940
At least I don't have these tornadoes running through my backyard.

3368
02:46:36,940 --> 02:46:40,300
So I'm, I'm glad to hear you're all right with all that.

3369
02:46:40,300 --> 02:46:42,060
We're getting the heat right now too.

3370
02:46:42,060 --> 02:46:46,540
We're, I think today we got probably a high of 101, which is not a whole, I

3371
02:46:46,540 --> 02:46:51,180
mean, it's not big here, but I mean, um, we're not getting tornadoes and

3372
02:46:51,180 --> 02:46:52,460
that's all that we care about.

3373
02:46:52,460 --> 02:46:56,940
Although I am getting a shelter put in, um, in September, I think.

3374
02:46:56,940 --> 02:46:58,620
So that's good.

3375
02:46:58,620 --> 02:47:01,740
All right, buddy, I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls, but, uh,

3376
02:47:01,740 --> 02:47:02,300
stay safe.

3377
02:47:03,100 --> 02:47:03,500
All right.

3378
02:47:03,500 --> 02:47:07,100
You guys keep, keep making the podcast for another 16 years.

3379
02:47:07,100 --> 02:47:07,660
How about that?

3380
02:47:07,660 --> 02:47:08,540
We'll try.

3381
02:47:08,540 --> 02:47:08,860
All right.

3382
02:47:09,420 --> 02:47:09,820
All right.

3383
02:47:09,820 --> 02:47:10,380
We'll see you.

3384
02:47:10,380 --> 02:47:10,620
All right.

3385
02:47:10,620 --> 02:47:11,580
Bye bye.

3386
02:47:12,620 --> 02:47:13,580
16 years.

3387
02:47:13,580 --> 02:47:14,780
I will be 50.

3388
02:47:14,780 --> 02:47:16,940
I don't know about that.

3389
02:47:16,940 --> 02:47:17,580
All right, we'll see.

3390
02:47:17,580 --> 02:47:19,260
All right, let's go to some more calls.

3391
02:47:19,260 --> 02:47:20,540
We have phones ringing tonight.

3392
02:47:20,540 --> 02:47:21,580
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

3393
02:47:21,580 --> 02:47:21,980
Who's this?

3394
02:47:22,860 --> 02:47:24,380
Uh, this is Zormay.

3395
02:47:24,380 --> 02:47:25,020
Zormay.

3396
02:47:25,020 --> 02:47:25,820
Hey, Zormay.

3397
02:47:25,820 --> 02:47:27,420
I don't think, have you called the show before?

3398
02:47:27,420 --> 02:47:28,300
I don't recognize your name.

3399
02:47:28,300 --> 02:47:31,820
Uh, yeah, I called a few times back in the day.

3400
02:47:31,820 --> 02:47:32,780
Oh, back in the day.

3401
02:47:32,780 --> 02:47:33,500
Well, welcome back.

3402
02:47:33,500 --> 02:47:34,380
What's on your mind, buddy?

3403
02:47:35,260 --> 02:47:40,700
Um, I know you guys are average gamers of, uh, Final Fantasy 11 and now that

3404
02:47:40,700 --> 02:47:44,300
Final Fantasy 14 has come out and it looks like it's going to be pretty good.

3405
02:47:44,300 --> 02:47:45,100
I've been playing it.

3406
02:47:45,100 --> 02:47:45,980
Have you guys?

3407
02:47:46,620 --> 02:47:47,340
Absolutely.

3408
02:47:47,340 --> 02:47:48,700
You might've missed the beginning of the show.

3409
02:47:48,700 --> 02:47:50,220
I was talking a bit about it.

3410
02:47:50,220 --> 02:47:51,100
Uh, that's all right.

3411
02:47:51,100 --> 02:47:55,020
We, we actually, all of us, except Slidekick, you haven't been able to play it, right?

3412
02:47:55,020 --> 02:47:57,740
No, not lately, but I did play in like an earlier phase.

3413
02:47:57,740 --> 02:47:58,060
Okay.

3414
02:47:58,060 --> 02:47:58,380
Yeah.

3415
02:47:58,380 --> 02:47:58,620
Yeah.

3416
02:47:58,620 --> 02:47:59,580
We've all been playing it.

3417
02:47:59,580 --> 02:48:01,340
I, I especially have been playing it.

3418
02:48:01,340 --> 02:48:02,540
I, I really love it.

3419
02:48:02,540 --> 02:48:06,700
Uh, I have, uh, two classes at 16 on my character that's going to get deleted in

3420
02:48:06,700 --> 02:48:10,700
a week anyway, but I'm having a lot of fun just exploring this gorgeous game.

3421
02:48:10,700 --> 02:48:11,980
That's very fan servicey.

3422
02:48:13,100 --> 02:48:13,660
No.

3423
02:48:13,660 --> 02:48:17,740
Did you, you said that the game is going to delete your, uh, your, uh, I don't

3424
02:48:17,740 --> 02:48:18,620
know if that's official.

3425
02:48:19,260 --> 02:48:24,620
Um, it's, it's out there that right now we're in what's called beta phase three

3426
02:48:24,620 --> 02:48:27,820
and they have said that they're going to wipe the characters at the end of beta

3427
02:48:27,820 --> 02:48:28,620
phase three.

3428
02:48:28,620 --> 02:48:33,340
We just don't know when the end is, but before the original official release of

3429
02:48:33,340 --> 02:48:36,940
the game, there is another character wipe slotted because there's going to be beta

3430
02:48:36,940 --> 02:48:41,500
phase four, which is open beta where everybody's going to get to play.

3431
02:48:41,500 --> 02:48:46,460
And they did say about beta phase four that they're going to try and, uh, let

3432
02:48:46,460 --> 02:48:48,380
those characters carry into the live game.

3433
02:48:48,380 --> 02:48:51,100
But they did clearly say so that people don't about it.

3434
02:48:51,100 --> 02:48:54,700
If it happens, another character wipe at the end of all the betas still may have

3435
02:48:54,700 --> 02:48:55,260
to occur.

3436
02:48:55,260 --> 02:48:57,820
So we may still be looking at two character wipes.

3437
02:48:57,820 --> 02:49:01,500
So don't get too attached to your character, but that's, I mean, considering

3438
02:49:01,500 --> 02:49:04,220
they haven't even opened up our arcanist as a job yet.

3439
02:49:04,220 --> 02:49:08,060
And I mean, you have to, I think have a 1.0 character or something.

3440
02:49:08,060 --> 02:49:10,940
I mean, consider we don't have all of that in there yet.

3441
02:49:10,940 --> 02:49:11,900
I'm okay with them.

3442
02:49:11,900 --> 02:49:14,300
I mean, it is a beta is a beta, not a demo.

3443
02:49:15,420 --> 02:49:17,100
Well, yeah, that's, that's the whole thing.

3444
02:49:17,100 --> 02:49:22,140
I think I've been enjoying playing different characters and it's been quite

3445
02:49:22,140 --> 02:49:27,820
fun because there's just so many different customizations and, um, that

3446
02:49:27,820 --> 02:49:29,580
whole, what do you think about the free company?

3447
02:49:29,580 --> 02:49:33,420
That's what I want because a lot of people see that you have link shells as

3448
02:49:33,420 --> 02:49:35,580
well, but there's no need for them because you're a free company.

3449
02:49:35,580 --> 02:49:35,740
Yeah.

3450
02:49:35,740 --> 02:49:38,940
I haven't been able to test that yet because I don't even really understand it

3451
02:49:38,940 --> 02:49:42,220
is that you have, uh, you have like the link shells or the little like sub

3452
02:49:42,220 --> 02:49:45,500
guilds, but then the free company is like your huge chat channel.

3453
02:49:45,500 --> 02:49:45,740
Right.

3454
02:49:45,740 --> 02:49:48,300
It's like you have big guilds and little guilds as a part of that.

3455
02:49:48,300 --> 02:49:48,620
Right.

3456
02:49:49,420 --> 02:49:49,740
Right.

3457
02:49:49,740 --> 02:49:50,380
It's so weird.

3458
02:49:50,380 --> 02:49:56,940
Basically like it's, it's like, you're able to go ahead and make, make a,

3459
02:49:56,940 --> 02:50:00,620
make a group of people a little bit more organized where you can have like

3460
02:50:00,620 --> 02:50:05,340
cadets and I'm not too sure, but like people are who are in your officers.

3461
02:50:05,340 --> 02:50:08,220
You have like cadets and you have like commanders or some sort of thing like

3462
02:50:08,220 --> 02:50:13,500
that and they can basically distribute money and gill and based off of like

3463
02:50:13,500 --> 02:50:15,100
their prestige inside the link shell.

3464
02:50:15,100 --> 02:50:16,620
I mean inside the free company.

3465
02:50:17,180 --> 02:50:21,660
I don't know exactly on too much detail about it, but it's more than just a

3466
02:50:21,660 --> 02:50:23,340
glorified link shell though.

3467
02:50:23,340 --> 02:50:27,020
My understanding, especially coming from World of Warcraft, which I've played

3468
02:50:27,020 --> 02:50:31,500
for a long time and I'm still continuing to play throughout Final Fantasy 14.

3469
02:50:31,500 --> 02:50:35,020
You had a lot of big guilds in World of Warcraft that had several rating

3470
02:50:35,020 --> 02:50:35,500
groups in it.

3471
02:50:35,580 --> 02:50:39,740
In fact, my own guild for a time that I was reading with had infamously to an

3472
02:50:39,740 --> 02:50:42,460
extent, two rating groups in it, raid group one and raid group two.

3473
02:50:42,460 --> 02:50:44,780
And that actually is what kind of drove that guild apart.

3474
02:50:44,780 --> 02:50:47,900
But you know, I would think that maybe with the free company set up, you would

3475
02:50:47,900 --> 02:50:51,100
still have like that, but then like each raid team would have its own little

3476
02:50:51,100 --> 02:50:54,220
link shell in it for, you know, raid nights and stuff like that.

3477
02:50:55,500 --> 02:50:57,100
It's interesting though, the way they're doing that.

3478
02:50:58,140 --> 02:51:03,980
Yeah, I do think is going to be great for organization because I don't know how,

3479
02:51:03,980 --> 02:51:08,140
well, I do know actually you, you, you played Final Fantasy 11, but you didn't

3480
02:51:08,140 --> 02:51:11,180
play it to extent where you were like in an end game.

3481
02:51:11,180 --> 02:51:12,780
No, I never got that far.

3482
02:51:12,780 --> 02:51:16,380
I played for years and never got a character past like 56.

3483
02:51:16,380 --> 02:51:18,700
I think it was the highest I ever got crazy.

3484
02:51:18,700 --> 02:51:19,020
All right.

3485
02:51:19,020 --> 02:51:24,540
So at the like, so if me, I had a couple of jobs, like it's level 75 and it was

3486
02:51:24,540 --> 02:51:30,940
kind of difficult, um, distributing, um, gill and prizes and, um, drops

3487
02:51:30,940 --> 02:51:34,140
throughout the several instances like dynamics and stuff like that.

3488
02:51:34,140 --> 02:51:38,620
So I think it'll make it a lot easier for people to just know and who is who

3489
02:51:38,620 --> 02:51:39,580
going forward.

3490
02:51:39,580 --> 02:51:43,340
I'm a little bit worried because of, it's a lot of jobs and you know, things

3491
02:51:43,340 --> 02:51:48,220
can get nerfed, like how Lancer got nerfed when Samurai Dragoon tend to go

3492
02:51:48,220 --> 02:51:48,860
out of hand.

3493
02:51:48,860 --> 02:51:51,500
I don't think you remember that with the Penta thrusts.

3494
02:51:51,500 --> 02:51:52,220
Yep, I do.

3495
02:51:52,780 --> 02:51:53,180
Yeah.

3496
02:51:53,180 --> 02:51:55,980
So it's, I don't know, I'm still waiting.

3497
02:51:55,980 --> 02:51:57,900
I mean, like, we'll see how things go.

3498
02:51:57,980 --> 02:52:01,020
I mean, uh, did you play the first one?

3499
02:52:01,740 --> 02:52:03,900
Yes, I did play 1.0.

3500
02:52:03,900 --> 02:52:05,580
I played at the very, very beginning.

3501
02:52:05,580 --> 02:52:10,220
I played the beta for 1.0 and then I played, uh, the very, very early version

3502
02:52:10,220 --> 02:52:12,940
or when it first came out and I hated it.

3503
02:52:12,940 --> 02:52:17,580
And, uh, I tried playing later, uh, after they opened it up and said, all

3504
02:52:17,580 --> 02:52:19,020
right, we're not charging a monthly fee anymore.

3505
02:52:19,020 --> 02:52:21,900
I want to say it was like January, February the next year.

3506
02:52:21,900 --> 02:52:26,060
And it was still like, it just, it wasn't, it was, it made me go back and

3507
02:52:26,060 --> 02:52:27,820
play 11 for a little bit.

3508
02:52:28,700 --> 02:52:29,340
Wow.

3509
02:52:29,340 --> 02:52:31,020
But, um, yeah, I felt the same way.

3510
02:52:31,020 --> 02:52:34,700
I mean, it was kind of weird the way the auction house wasn't available.

3511
02:52:34,700 --> 02:52:40,540
And, um, there was no, like, no directions.

3512
02:52:40,540 --> 02:52:41,180
Crazy.

3513
02:52:41,180 --> 02:52:45,020
But, um, okay, quickly, before I let you go, um, what, since you were a player

3514
02:52:45,020 --> 02:52:48,380
of 11 for so long, what do you think of 14 having come from 11?

3515
02:52:49,020 --> 02:52:51,100
Um, I'm, I'm excited.

3516
02:52:51,100 --> 02:52:55,740
Um, I'm taking my time, you know, because, you know, when I played for

3517
02:52:55,740 --> 02:52:58,620
the 11, I didn't really know what I was, I wanted to do.

3518
02:52:58,620 --> 02:53:02,140
I kind of had like a warrior and we found that we had lack of white mages.

3519
02:53:02,140 --> 02:53:05,340
So I had to go back and kind of like build up a white mage.

3520
02:53:05,340 --> 02:53:09,340
I'm playing like as many jobs as possible on several different servers

3521
02:53:09,340 --> 02:53:12,060
and just trying to get a basic understanding of the game.

3522
02:53:12,620 --> 02:53:15,100
I'm pretty sure, I'm pretty sure I want to be a scholar.

3523
02:53:15,100 --> 02:53:17,900
So I'm hoping Arcanist is open soon.

3524
02:53:17,900 --> 02:53:18,300
Oh God.

3525
02:53:18,300 --> 02:53:21,740
I'm hoping they open soon so I can see it before the real game goes live,

3526
02:53:21,740 --> 02:53:22,620
but we'll see.

3527
02:53:22,620 --> 02:53:25,100
But anyway, I have to let you go, but thank you so much for the call.

3528
02:53:25,100 --> 02:53:25,820
Good to hear from you.

3529
02:53:25,820 --> 02:53:27,900
And I'll, I'll always talk MMOs with people.

3530
02:53:28,540 --> 02:53:29,180
No problem.

3531
02:53:29,180 --> 02:53:29,740
Take care.

3532
02:53:29,740 --> 02:53:30,380
Take care, buddy.

3533
02:53:30,380 --> 02:53:30,880
Bye.

3534
02:53:31,580 --> 02:53:32,460
All right.

3535
02:53:32,460 --> 02:53:32,780
Good call.

3536
02:53:32,780 --> 02:53:35,900
I love hearing from people tonight is people we haven't heard from in a while

3537
02:53:35,900 --> 02:53:37,100
night, apparently.

3538
02:53:37,820 --> 02:53:38,380
All right.

3539
02:53:38,380 --> 02:53:39,420
You all right over there, Loki?

3540
02:53:39,420 --> 02:53:40,060
You're giggling.

3541
02:53:40,060 --> 02:53:45,900
I love these like battlefield three animated GIFs because it just, I kind of

3542
02:53:46,540 --> 02:53:47,040
played even.

3543
02:53:47,740 --> 02:53:48,460
Yes.

3544
02:53:48,460 --> 02:53:51,180
I want to play it even more because it looks so glitchy.

3545
02:53:51,180 --> 02:53:56,460
Sometimes like this guy snipes a jet, makes it blow up in front of his face

3546
02:53:56,460 --> 02:53:57,100
and nothing happens.

3547
02:53:57,100 --> 02:54:01,420
So a one eight seven seven game or a username on Skype, orange lounge radio,

3548
02:54:01,420 --> 02:54:02,140
all one word.

3549
02:54:02,140 --> 02:54:03,820
We'll try to squeeze in at least one more call.

3550
02:54:04,460 --> 02:54:07,820
I wanted to do a Twitter topic that came in here from a tiger claw,

3551
02:54:07,820 --> 02:54:08,700
send us a tweet.

3552
02:54:08,700 --> 02:54:09,340
What is it here?

3553
02:54:10,300 --> 02:54:13,260
Nintendo defends the rapid release of new Mario game.

3554
02:54:13,260 --> 02:54:15,500
Although our phone lines are lighting up our, I'll come back to this in a

3555
02:54:15,580 --> 02:54:16,780
minute for now.

3556
02:54:16,780 --> 02:54:17,820
Let's go to the Skype line.

3557
02:54:17,820 --> 02:54:18,860
Hi, you're on orange launch radio.

3558
02:54:18,860 --> 02:54:19,360
Who's this?

3559
02:54:20,860 --> 02:54:21,660
Hello.

3560
02:54:21,660 --> 02:54:22,160
Hello.

3561
02:54:22,940 --> 02:54:26,540
Oh, we have a, we have a CT and Gigi here.

3562
02:54:26,540 --> 02:54:27,260
Oh my gosh.

3563
02:54:27,260 --> 02:54:28,140
You guys are together.

3564
02:54:28,140 --> 02:54:29,820
It's a, it's a cam thing though.

3565
02:54:29,820 --> 02:54:33,100
Although all I see is like half of dark Tetsuya's head, but that's okay.

3566
02:54:33,100 --> 02:54:33,900
What's up you guys?

3567
02:54:35,020 --> 02:54:36,140
Oh, not a whole lot.

3568
02:54:36,140 --> 02:54:38,540
You know, just been hanging out, playing a lot of games.

3569
02:54:38,540 --> 02:54:39,040
Yeah.

3570
02:54:39,660 --> 02:54:40,540
Good times.

3571
02:54:40,540 --> 02:54:41,260
Like what games?

3572
02:54:41,260 --> 02:54:43,260
I got sucked into unepic.

3573
02:54:43,260 --> 02:54:44,940
That game is so fun.

3574
02:54:44,940 --> 02:54:45,500
Unepic.

3575
02:54:46,060 --> 02:54:46,560
Yeah.

3576
02:54:47,100 --> 02:54:48,460
Tell us a little bit about that one.

3577
02:54:49,100 --> 02:54:50,300
Um, it's pretty fun.

3578
02:54:50,300 --> 02:54:51,980
It's like a dungeon crawler.

3579
02:54:52,700 --> 02:54:53,740
Oh, okay.

3580
02:54:54,460 --> 02:54:54,940
Cool.

3581
02:54:54,940 --> 02:54:57,260
That's like a Metroidvania type thing.

3582
02:54:57,260 --> 02:54:59,260
Uh, I'm here for that.

3583
02:54:59,260 --> 02:55:01,340
Is that free or is that like?

3584
02:55:01,340 --> 02:55:03,580
Um, it's $7.99 on Steam.

3585
02:55:03,580 --> 02:55:04,380
Ooh, that's not bad.

3586
02:55:04,940 --> 02:55:05,580
All right.

3587
02:55:05,580 --> 02:55:05,980
Okay.

3588
02:55:05,980 --> 02:55:07,820
I'll, I'll have to write that one down.

3589
02:55:07,820 --> 02:55:08,380
Very cool.

3590
02:55:10,300 --> 02:55:12,460
So I'm looking at pictures actually.

3591
02:55:12,460 --> 02:55:13,580
It does look kind of neat.

3592
02:55:13,580 --> 02:55:16,700
It is very Castlevania like with big dragons.

3593
02:55:18,060 --> 02:55:18,300
Yeah.

3594
02:55:18,300 --> 02:55:23,420
And you can like level up your character with, with, um, each there's a bar at the top that

3595
02:55:23,420 --> 02:55:25,740
has like a level leveling system.

3596
02:55:25,740 --> 02:55:31,420
And with each level, you can put it into weapons or your, um, or, or yourself, like to get

3597
02:55:31,420 --> 02:55:33,980
more, um, stamina and whatnot.

3598
02:55:33,980 --> 02:55:34,860
It's pretty fun.

3599
02:55:34,860 --> 02:55:35,980
That looks super fun.

3600
02:55:35,980 --> 02:55:37,980
I think I am going to check that out.

3601
02:55:37,980 --> 02:55:38,620
That's awesome.

3602
02:55:39,740 --> 02:55:40,300
Yeah.

3603
02:55:40,300 --> 02:55:41,020
Very cool.

3604
02:55:41,020 --> 02:55:44,140
So did you guys just call in to get me sucked into a new game and make me spend $8?

3605
02:55:44,860 --> 02:55:45,100
Yeah.

3606
02:55:46,540 --> 02:55:47,340
Yeah.

3607
02:55:47,340 --> 02:55:48,140
Well, congrats.

3608
02:55:48,940 --> 02:55:50,860
We're like, we need to suck them into another game.

3609
02:55:50,860 --> 02:55:51,020
Yeah.

3610
02:55:51,660 --> 02:55:51,900
Yeah.

3611
02:55:51,900 --> 02:55:55,180
Cause I haven't been talking about how I've been playing Final Fantasy 14 literally all

3612
02:55:55,180 --> 02:55:56,140
weekend long.

3613
02:55:56,140 --> 02:55:57,580
Just updated League of Legends.

3614
02:55:57,580 --> 02:55:57,900
Oh yeah.

3615
02:55:57,900 --> 02:55:59,020
I got time for another one.

3616
02:55:59,020 --> 02:55:59,500
That's all right.

3617
02:55:59,500 --> 02:56:00,060
Bring it.

3618
02:56:00,060 --> 02:56:00,460
Jelly.

3619
02:56:00,460 --> 02:56:04,060
I want to get, I was trying to get into the beta, but I don't think I made it.

3620
02:56:04,060 --> 02:56:04,700
Good news.

3621
02:56:04,700 --> 02:56:06,140
Beta four is going to be open.

3622
02:56:06,140 --> 02:56:07,580
Anyone who wants to play can play it.

3623
02:56:08,540 --> 02:56:10,940
And then I heard about, um, the pricing system.

3624
02:56:10,940 --> 02:56:14,060
Is that already, have they already fixed it or?

3625
02:56:14,060 --> 02:56:18,220
Uh, you don't have to pay for it yet, but when the game goes live on August 27th, I

3626
02:56:18,220 --> 02:56:21,100
believe it's $12.95 a month is the lower tier.

3627
02:56:21,100 --> 02:56:24,060
And then like $14.95 for eight characters or something.

3628
02:56:24,620 --> 02:56:25,500
Don't quote me on that.

3629
02:56:26,460 --> 02:56:27,660
That seems pretty legit.

3630
02:56:27,660 --> 02:56:31,020
Like I think I can work that into my budget because I want that game so bad.

3631
02:56:31,020 --> 02:56:31,260
Yeah.

3632
02:56:31,260 --> 02:56:31,820
It's going to be fun.

3633
02:56:32,380 --> 02:56:37,820
Oh, cause I started playing, um, final fantasy back when seven came out.

3634
02:56:39,260 --> 02:56:44,460
So unfortunately I was never able to really play the online ones, but I've been a fan

3635
02:56:44,460 --> 02:56:45,580
ever since seven.

3636
02:56:47,420 --> 02:56:49,580
Well, there's a lot of fan service in 14.

3637
02:56:50,700 --> 02:56:50,940
Yeah.

3638
02:56:51,900 --> 02:56:52,380
All right.

3639
02:56:52,380 --> 02:56:53,260
Moogles.

3640
02:56:53,260 --> 02:56:53,580
All right.

3641
02:56:53,580 --> 02:56:58,060
Well you guys, you have fun and uh, go find another game for me to get addicted to.

3642
02:56:59,500 --> 02:56:59,900
All right.

3643
02:56:59,900 --> 02:57:00,700
Take care guys.

3644
02:57:02,140 --> 02:57:02,380
Bye.

3645
02:57:03,100 --> 02:57:06,300
Video calls are always fun, even though I can only see like half of each of their head,

3646
02:57:06,300 --> 02:57:07,580
but it worked.

3647
02:57:07,580 --> 02:57:08,080
All right.

3648
02:57:09,020 --> 02:57:10,860
Uh, one eight seven seven game.

3649
02:57:10,860 --> 02:57:13,100
All our username on Skype is orange lounge radio.

3650
02:57:13,100 --> 02:57:13,500
What do you say?

3651
02:57:13,500 --> 02:57:15,100
It's like, Hey, can we try to fit in one more call?

3652
02:57:15,100 --> 02:57:15,500
Yeah.

3653
02:57:15,500 --> 02:57:18,380
Someone new needs to call someone new.

3654
02:57:18,380 --> 02:57:19,420
Someone new.

3655
02:57:19,420 --> 02:57:19,740
We'll see.

3656
02:57:19,740 --> 02:57:21,740
We'll see what happens when I challenge you.

3657
02:57:22,620 --> 02:57:23,500
All right.

3658
02:57:23,500 --> 02:57:25,580
Listeners of OLR be somebody new.

3659
02:57:25,580 --> 02:57:26,140
Be quick.

3660
02:57:26,140 --> 02:57:27,820
Cause there's been a lot of people trying to get through.

3661
02:57:27,820 --> 02:57:29,900
That's why I'm going to allow one more call to squeeze in here.

3662
02:57:30,380 --> 02:57:31,100
Uh, let's see.

3663
02:57:31,100 --> 02:57:34,860
Oh, I was going to read the tiger claw tweet that said Nintendo defends the rapid release

3664
02:57:34,860 --> 02:57:36,380
of new Mario games.

3665
02:57:36,380 --> 02:57:43,020
Um, quote, who's this quote from Nintendo of America, senior director of corporate communications,

3666
02:57:43,020 --> 02:57:43,580
Mario game.

3667
02:57:43,580 --> 02:57:47,740
Uh, we think we're putting out the right number of Mario games based on what fans are asking

3668
02:57:47,740 --> 02:57:51,020
for based on what our own developers, creative visions are.

3669
02:57:51,020 --> 02:57:54,460
The key to that is as long as there's innovation occurring within the gameplay, as long as

3670
02:57:54,460 --> 02:57:58,300
there's new features, then marrying the characters and the IPs that people love is the right

3671
02:57:58,300 --> 02:57:59,740
call from our standpoint.

3672
02:57:59,820 --> 02:58:01,580
But the phone is ringing again, so let's go to it.

3673
02:58:01,580 --> 02:58:01,740
Hi.

3674
02:58:01,740 --> 02:58:02,620
You're on orange launch radio.

3675
02:58:02,620 --> 02:58:03,020
Who's this?

3676
02:58:03,820 --> 02:58:04,940
Uh, name and lights.

3677
02:58:04,940 --> 02:58:06,220
Name and lights.

3678
02:58:06,220 --> 02:58:09,500
Although it's ironic because your icon is just a solid black square.

3679
02:58:10,780 --> 02:58:11,500
It is.

3680
02:58:11,500 --> 02:58:12,860
Well, at least that's, that's what I'm seeing.

3681
02:58:12,860 --> 02:58:13,100
I don't know.

3682
02:58:13,100 --> 02:58:15,820
Maybe it's not supposed to be, but yeah, I do not see your name in lights.

3683
02:58:15,820 --> 02:58:16,700
That's supposed to be.

3684
02:58:16,700 --> 02:58:17,420
Oh, oops.

3685
02:58:17,420 --> 02:58:17,820
So well.

3686
02:58:17,820 --> 02:58:17,980
All right.

3687
02:58:17,980 --> 02:58:18,780
Well, what's on your mind?

3688
02:58:20,220 --> 02:58:22,540
This is the first time I've listened to the show live.

3689
02:58:23,100 --> 02:58:25,980
Well, I was going to say, I recognize your name, but I don't think you've ever called

3690
02:58:25,980 --> 02:58:26,780
well, dark soccer.

3691
02:58:26,780 --> 02:58:27,100
There you go.

3692
02:58:27,100 --> 02:58:28,060
You got your new person.

3693
02:58:28,060 --> 02:58:28,700
Yay.

3694
02:58:28,700 --> 02:58:29,180
All right.

3695
02:58:29,660 --> 02:58:30,540
Thank you.

3696
02:58:30,540 --> 02:58:31,740
Well, uh, what do you think?

3697
02:58:33,180 --> 02:58:33,980
Uh, interesting.

3698
02:58:34,620 --> 02:58:34,860
Okay.

3699
02:58:35,420 --> 02:58:38,860
I've been, I've been listening to the, uh, uh, orange loans for years.

3700
02:58:38,860 --> 02:58:42,940
Oh, well, and you, you just now were able to make it to a live show?

3701
02:58:42,940 --> 02:58:44,220
Usually busy on Sunday nights?

3702
02:58:44,700 --> 02:58:46,300
Uh, normally I'm sleeping.

3703
02:58:46,300 --> 02:58:47,660
This is flipping late for me.

3704
02:58:47,660 --> 02:58:48,460
Oh my gosh.

3705
02:58:48,460 --> 02:58:49,260
We have a lot of people.

3706
02:58:49,260 --> 02:58:51,100
Code man said earlier, he was staying up late.

3707
02:58:51,100 --> 02:58:55,580
I guess a lot of people maybe for the 4th of July week kind of have a lot less going

3708
02:58:55,580 --> 02:58:55,740
on.

3709
02:58:55,740 --> 02:58:56,140
I don't know.

3710
02:58:56,700 --> 02:59:00,060
You may remember me from a couple of the messages I sent you privately.

3711
02:59:00,780 --> 02:59:01,340
Perhaps.

3712
02:59:02,540 --> 02:59:03,900
My wife passed away.

3713
02:59:03,900 --> 02:59:06,060
Yes, yes, yes I do.

3714
02:59:06,060 --> 02:59:06,460
I do.

3715
02:59:06,460 --> 02:59:06,860
Of course.

3716
02:59:06,860 --> 02:59:09,660
I recognize that and I'm very sorry to hear that.

3717
02:59:09,660 --> 02:59:11,020
Yeah, we're Facebook buddies too.

3718
02:59:11,020 --> 02:59:12,220
Yeah, we're all Facebook friends.

3719
02:59:12,220 --> 02:59:12,540
Yeah.

3720
02:59:12,540 --> 02:59:12,700
Yeah.

3721
02:59:13,260 --> 02:59:16,860
So well, I just got back in the gaming again.

3722
02:59:16,860 --> 02:59:17,660
Yeah.

3723
02:59:17,660 --> 02:59:18,540
What have you been playing?

3724
02:59:20,060 --> 02:59:20,620
Warcraft.

3725
02:59:21,820 --> 02:59:24,460
Like, like old school Warcraft or World of Warcraft?

3726
02:59:24,460 --> 02:59:25,100
World of Warcraft.

3727
02:59:25,100 --> 02:59:25,820
World of Warcraft.

3728
02:59:25,900 --> 02:59:27,340
I'm in the Hoard House Guild.

3729
02:59:27,340 --> 02:59:27,660
Yeah, yeah.

3730
02:59:27,660 --> 02:59:29,900
No, I knew you were over there in the Hoard House Guild.

3731
02:59:29,900 --> 02:59:33,740
Thank you for being loyal to the Hoard House Guild because unfortunately a lot of people

3732
02:59:33,740 --> 02:59:38,220
have quit WoW for things like Final Fantasy XIV or League or whatever it is.

3733
02:59:38,220 --> 02:59:39,100
For real life.

3734
02:59:39,100 --> 02:59:41,340
I mean, I was off a month.

3735
02:59:41,340 --> 02:59:41,980
Yeah.

3736
02:59:41,980 --> 02:59:43,740
Well, understandably so, but.

3737
02:59:43,740 --> 02:59:46,940
I was actually sort of thinking about rebuilding my subscription except that.

3738
02:59:47,580 --> 02:59:48,700
Now you have Animal Crossing.

3739
02:59:48,700 --> 02:59:49,740
I have Animal Crossing.

3740
02:59:49,740 --> 02:59:50,060
Yeah.

3741
02:59:50,060 --> 02:59:51,740
What do you like to do in World of Warcraft?

3742
02:59:53,100 --> 02:59:55,500
Right now I'm leveling a new monk.

3743
02:59:55,500 --> 02:59:55,820
Nice.

3744
02:59:57,340 --> 03:00:00,780
I deleted the monk that I was, because my wife used to play.

3745
03:00:01,980 --> 03:00:06,060
And she wanted to play, but when she had the stroke, she couldn't see.

3746
03:00:07,820 --> 03:00:17,900
So I spent three solid weeks farming for the Vial of the Sands so I could fly her around.

3747
03:00:19,500 --> 03:00:22,940
And it literally took me forever.

3748
03:00:22,940 --> 03:00:27,580
Yeah, those things were a pain in the ass to get, but they're great for being able to.

3749
03:00:27,580 --> 03:00:27,740
Yeah.

3750
03:00:28,460 --> 03:00:31,980
And for those that don't know, because not everybody speaks Warcraft, the Vial of the

3751
03:00:31,980 --> 03:00:37,180
Sands is a mount that you can basically turn yourself into a dragon, but another player

3752
03:00:37,180 --> 03:00:40,300
can ride on your back to get your minds out of the gutter people.

3753
03:00:40,300 --> 03:00:43,260
They can ride on your back and you can fly them to places.

3754
03:00:43,260 --> 03:00:43,980
So it's really great.

3755
03:00:43,980 --> 03:00:47,900
It's like if you have a low level character, you're like, Oh, you need to get to Thunder

3756
03:00:47,900 --> 03:00:50,460
Bluff or a town that might be far for you to walk to.

3757
03:00:50,460 --> 03:00:51,260
Get on my back.

3758
03:00:51,260 --> 03:00:51,580
Let's go.

3759
03:00:51,580 --> 03:00:57,580
And it was 300 flying too, so if you had a lower level character, you could still take

3760
03:00:57,580 --> 03:00:58,940
him at what, epic speed, right?

3761
03:00:58,940 --> 03:01:00,060
Yeah, you could.

3762
03:01:00,780 --> 03:01:08,620
Yeah, so when I was off for five weeks taking care of her after the stroke, I upped my Warcraft

3763
03:01:08,620 --> 03:01:13,820
and the only thing I did was farm archaeology to get the recipe.

3764
03:01:14,860 --> 03:01:19,340
And she passed away three days after I got it.

3765
03:01:19,820 --> 03:01:20,620
Hmm.

3766
03:01:20,620 --> 03:01:22,140
But at least you got it.

3767
03:01:23,420 --> 03:01:23,900
Yeah, I did.

3768
03:01:23,900 --> 03:01:27,900
But I never had a chance for her to use it.

3769
03:01:27,900 --> 03:01:28,860
I'm sorry to hear that.

3770
03:01:30,140 --> 03:01:31,580
So I pretty much stopped.

3771
03:01:31,580 --> 03:01:31,900
Wow.

3772
03:01:31,900 --> 03:01:37,580
I deleted the monk that I leveled with her and it was tough to get back in.

3773
03:01:38,300 --> 03:01:38,540
Yeah.

3774
03:01:41,100 --> 03:01:46,460
Has getting in, I hate to dwell on what might be a difficult topic, but has this been a

3775
03:01:46,540 --> 03:01:53,420
way for you to kind of help get back into after such a tragedy as video games kind of

3776
03:01:53,420 --> 03:01:58,220
helped you a little bit in getting back into what might have been your routine before?

3777
03:01:59,980 --> 03:02:08,940
It took a while to get back into it because I was trying to play after she passed away,

3778
03:02:08,940 --> 03:02:13,820
but I just couldn't play more than a few minutes without getting irritatedly bored and just

3779
03:02:13,820 --> 03:02:14,780
shutting it off.

3780
03:02:14,780 --> 03:02:15,020
Yeah.

3781
03:02:15,580 --> 03:02:18,860
So I didn't up my account until very recently.

3782
03:02:21,020 --> 03:02:23,660
And I named a character after her.

3783
03:02:24,620 --> 03:02:27,580
It's a great way to memorialize somebody.

3784
03:02:27,580 --> 03:02:29,500
I know of other people that have done that in WoW.

3785
03:02:29,500 --> 03:02:30,220
Absolutely.

3786
03:02:30,220 --> 03:02:35,100
And I know that even the developers, you know, when people that they were close to that were

3787
03:02:35,100 --> 03:02:38,940
involved in the game, they've immortalized them in the game too.

3788
03:02:38,940 --> 03:02:39,260
Yes.

3789
03:02:39,260 --> 03:02:41,740
There's some really great memorial.

3790
03:02:42,060 --> 03:02:47,100
Usually this is more for people that were really part of the WoW community and heavy

3791
03:02:47,100 --> 03:02:51,420
raiders and stuff, but they have set up tributes.

3792
03:02:51,420 --> 03:02:53,260
Blizzard has kind of done that in the game.

3793
03:02:53,260 --> 03:02:56,780
And there's some really great compilations out there on YouTube.

3794
03:02:56,780 --> 03:03:03,180
I know somebody that had this for somebody that they were married to.

3795
03:03:03,180 --> 03:03:08,140
And yeah, really great when the companies kind of do that.

3796
03:03:08,220 --> 03:03:14,060
I mean, it just really emphasizes the community that an MMO game and what really makes those

3797
03:03:14,060 --> 03:03:15,980
games great is the community.

3798
03:03:15,980 --> 03:03:19,820
So yeah, it's been hard.

3799
03:03:19,820 --> 03:03:24,540
This has been the last couple of months have been ridiculously hard.

3800
03:03:24,540 --> 03:03:24,780
Right.

3801
03:03:25,900 --> 03:03:26,300
Of course.

3802
03:03:27,260 --> 03:03:32,620
I'm not even going to sit here and try to imagine, but you know, you got friends here

3803
03:03:32,620 --> 03:03:38,860
at OLR and at the voice against network and in out there on in Facebook land and on the

3804
03:03:38,860 --> 03:03:41,980
internet that are trying to help you through it.

3805
03:03:41,980 --> 03:03:46,060
I hope it's getting a little better every day.

3806
03:03:47,340 --> 03:03:48,140
Except for today.

3807
03:03:48,700 --> 03:03:51,100
Oh, I got my eviction notice today.

3808
03:03:51,100 --> 03:03:51,740
Oh, my God.

3809
03:03:55,180 --> 03:03:56,140
I don't know what to say.

3810
03:03:57,500 --> 03:03:58,220
Yeah.

3811
03:03:58,220 --> 03:03:58,540
Yeah.

3812
03:03:59,340 --> 03:04:01,580
I probably should start a support group.

3813
03:04:01,660 --> 03:04:02,940
Well, but I don't know.

3814
03:04:02,940 --> 03:04:03,100
Yeah.

3815
03:04:04,300 --> 03:04:06,940
I need bad news to stop happening to our listeners.

3816
03:04:06,940 --> 03:04:09,020
This is this is this is bad.

3817
03:04:11,100 --> 03:04:17,820
Gosh, I don't know what we can do to help, but I knew this was coming.

3818
03:04:17,820 --> 03:04:21,180
I knew when she passed away, I wasn't going to be able to afford the house that we have.

3819
03:04:21,180 --> 03:04:25,980
So what goes around comes around.

3820
03:04:25,980 --> 03:04:27,740
So I got the eviction notice.

3821
03:04:27,740 --> 03:04:28,460
It opened a beer.

3822
03:04:28,460 --> 03:04:32,220
When in doubt, when in doubt, why not?

3823
03:04:32,780 --> 03:04:33,820
All right, buddy.

3824
03:04:33,820 --> 03:04:35,020
Well, we're all thinking of you.

3825
03:04:35,020 --> 03:04:37,660
And good luck pulling through, pulling through, you know.

3826
03:04:38,860 --> 03:04:40,220
I mean, I love the show.

3827
03:04:40,220 --> 03:04:41,180
I love listening.

3828
03:04:41,180 --> 03:04:43,260
I love I love Hoard House.

3829
03:04:44,140 --> 03:04:45,660
I'm I'm an avid listener.

3830
03:04:45,660 --> 03:04:48,220
This is the first time I've actually had a chance to be up this late.

3831
03:04:49,260 --> 03:04:51,980
My buddy was helping me pack up some stuff tonight.

3832
03:04:51,980 --> 03:04:53,820
It's the only reason why I'm still up.

3833
03:04:53,820 --> 03:04:54,060
Sure.

3834
03:04:54,700 --> 03:04:55,500
He took off.

3835
03:04:55,740 --> 03:04:59,020
I just decided to turn the show on.

3836
03:04:59,020 --> 03:05:03,500
You know, I know you guys, you know, usually end around twelve, one o'clock Eastern time

3837
03:05:03,500 --> 03:05:04,940
because I am on the East Coast.

3838
03:05:06,140 --> 03:05:09,820
But, you know, I listen to you guys on a regular basis for years now.

3839
03:05:09,820 --> 03:05:11,900
I just never have a chance to listen live.

3840
03:05:11,900 --> 03:05:13,900
Well, I'm glad you could make it out tonight.

3841
03:05:13,900 --> 03:05:16,060
I just wish the circumstances have been a little better.

3842
03:05:16,060 --> 03:05:18,940
But, you know, you can send me a message anytime on Facebook.

3843
03:05:18,940 --> 03:05:24,060
Not not to be one of those like like super hippie mega happy people.

3844
03:05:24,060 --> 03:05:29,420
But, you know, I do believe very much so that when when one door closes, another opens,

3845
03:05:29,420 --> 03:05:33,100
like when I was laid off from my job several years ago, it was like the end of the world

3846
03:05:33,100 --> 03:05:35,500
to me and I was worried about a lot of things.

3847
03:05:35,500 --> 03:05:39,820
But I ended up getting a career I've been at for 12 years now since then.

3848
03:05:39,820 --> 03:05:47,180
I mean, I mean, I mean, not to get all preachy and everything when she was happiest ever

3849
03:05:47,180 --> 03:05:47,900
as a teacher.

3850
03:05:49,420 --> 03:05:53,900
She was teaching CNAs, which is certified nursing assistants.

3851
03:05:54,380 --> 03:05:55,740
She loved her job.

3852
03:05:56,380 --> 03:05:57,500
She was an RN.

3853
03:05:58,860 --> 03:06:02,140
You know, she was two credits away from being a bachelor's.

3854
03:06:02,940 --> 03:06:09,100
And, you know, when she lost that job because they changed the qualifications for the job,

3855
03:06:09,100 --> 03:06:12,540
I just simply told her that it's like, you know what, I'll support you.

3856
03:06:12,540 --> 03:06:13,740
I'll do whatever it takes.

3857
03:06:14,700 --> 03:06:18,540
Just, you know, go back to school, get your education

3858
03:06:18,540 --> 03:06:21,580
and get more education than the person that just fired you.

3859
03:06:24,220 --> 03:06:25,660
And that's what she was going to do.

3860
03:06:26,540 --> 03:06:27,020
She was...

3861
03:06:30,220 --> 03:06:31,340
Sorry, but...

3862
03:06:31,340 --> 03:06:32,460
No, I understand.

3863
03:06:35,660 --> 03:06:36,620
Cinco de Mayo.

3864
03:06:39,340 --> 03:06:40,780
She wanted to go back to the school.

3865
03:06:43,500 --> 03:06:46,140
Well, you're getting a lot of support from our chat room right now.

3866
03:06:46,140 --> 03:06:48,620
You know, act deaf saying if there's anything we can help you out with,

3867
03:06:48,620 --> 03:06:50,300
the VOG community is there to help you.

3868
03:06:51,100 --> 03:06:53,420
E-hugs all around from Degenerate Johnny.

3869
03:06:53,420 --> 03:06:59,980
And I know it's really tough.

3870
03:06:59,980 --> 03:07:03,100
She was supposed to start school on the 5th,

3871
03:07:04,220 --> 03:07:10,220
and I told her that the module wasn't going to open up on the 5th because it was a holiday.

3872
03:07:13,980 --> 03:07:18,460
She went to school on Monday and passed away on Tuesday.

3873
03:07:20,300 --> 03:07:32,220
Well, you're getting the world's biggest hug from our chat room right now for this,

3874
03:07:32,220 --> 03:07:33,660
you know, all over the place.

3875
03:07:33,660 --> 03:07:41,260
But how great that you were helping her to achieve this and, you know,

3876
03:07:41,260 --> 03:07:43,420
come out of the circumstance better.

3877
03:07:43,420 --> 03:07:47,180
And I know wherever she is right now, she's thanking you big time for it.

3878
03:07:48,140 --> 03:07:51,500
So getting a lot of really horrible two months.

3879
03:07:52,140 --> 03:07:52,940
I know.

3880
03:07:52,940 --> 03:07:54,940
I bet I was glad May was over with.

3881
03:07:54,940 --> 03:07:57,420
But June is just June's gone.

3882
03:07:57,980 --> 03:07:59,100
It is June.

3883
03:07:59,100 --> 03:08:01,180
Oh, it is July, isn't it?

3884
03:08:02,460 --> 03:08:03,180
Tomorrow.

3885
03:08:03,180 --> 03:08:04,540
Well, today for East Coast.

3886
03:08:05,100 --> 03:08:09,260
Yeah, it's just she went back to school one day.

3887
03:08:13,580 --> 03:08:15,740
But you helped her get back to school.

3888
03:08:15,740 --> 03:08:16,140
You did.

3889
03:08:17,420 --> 03:08:19,820
Well, all she wanted to do was become a teacher.

3890
03:08:21,820 --> 03:08:22,620
And you know what?

3891
03:08:22,620 --> 03:08:26,700
My mom was a teacher, so it's a great profession.

3892
03:08:26,700 --> 03:08:27,980
I'm actually a corporate trainer.

3893
03:08:27,980 --> 03:08:29,420
It's a great profession.

3894
03:08:29,420 --> 03:08:30,780
It's an admirable thing.

3895
03:08:30,780 --> 03:08:32,060
I love my job.

3896
03:08:32,060 --> 03:08:32,560
Absolutely.

3897
03:08:34,140 --> 03:08:35,980
Well, I'm going to let you go.

3898
03:08:35,980 --> 03:08:36,480
Sure.

3899
03:08:36,860 --> 03:08:37,180
All right.

3900
03:08:38,140 --> 03:08:46,700
I'll try to listen again live again when the dust settles and I'll stay in touch.

3901
03:08:46,700 --> 03:08:46,940
All right.

3902
03:08:46,940 --> 03:08:48,940
Please do stay on Facebook.

3903
03:08:48,940 --> 03:08:49,500
I will.

3904
03:08:49,500 --> 03:08:49,900
Okay.

3905
03:08:49,900 --> 03:08:50,220
All right.

3906
03:08:50,220 --> 03:08:50,780
You take care.

3907
03:08:50,780 --> 03:08:51,500
We're all thinking of you.

3908
03:08:51,500 --> 03:08:51,900
All right.

3909
03:08:51,900 --> 03:08:52,380
Bye bye.

3910
03:08:52,380 --> 03:08:52,880
Bye.

3911
03:08:53,820 --> 03:08:54,620
Oh, how's that?

3912
03:08:55,900 --> 03:08:56,780
Tough call.

3913
03:08:56,780 --> 03:08:58,540
I need someone to cut.

3914
03:08:59,340 --> 03:08:59,980
Quick, Loki.

3915
03:08:59,980 --> 03:09:01,020
I need a fart joke.

3916
03:09:01,020 --> 03:09:02,700
Quick, help me.

3917
03:09:03,820 --> 03:09:04,220
You know what?

3918
03:09:04,220 --> 03:09:04,940
Know what?

3919
03:09:04,940 --> 03:09:08,140
I have happy, happy because look at the chat room.

3920
03:09:08,140 --> 03:09:09,580
I mean, yeah, for real.

3921
03:09:09,580 --> 03:09:10,540
Seriously, for real.

3922
03:09:10,540 --> 03:09:15,340
And you know, there's even I'm sure a lot of people are like, wow, that was a heavy call.

3923
03:09:15,340 --> 03:09:16,540
And yes, it was a heavy call.

3924
03:09:16,540 --> 03:09:20,620
But when we say when we say we're there for people, we kind of like mean it and shit.

3925
03:09:20,620 --> 03:09:21,120
So.

3926
03:09:21,580 --> 03:09:27,580
And the biggest thing that me that I like to do for people is I like to find if there's

3927
03:09:27,580 --> 03:09:32,700
a tough situation, I like to find research, everything that has to do with it and offer

3928
03:09:32,700 --> 03:09:37,900
options because especially when you're in the middle of a situation, there's not always

3929
03:09:37,900 --> 03:09:40,540
things that occur to you when you're in that situation.

3930
03:09:41,180 --> 03:09:46,220
And like when Dan and I were, you know, you because, you know, when we got our notice

3931
03:09:46,220 --> 03:09:53,900
for the house that we were staying in rent free, we had to move like in a week and it

3932
03:09:53,900 --> 03:09:57,580
was people helping us and giving us options that opened the door for us, too.

3933
03:09:57,580 --> 03:10:05,020
So, yeah, any if you need to bounce any ideas, if you need just someone outside the situation

3934
03:10:05,020 --> 03:10:07,580
to help you see it clearly, let me know.

3935
03:10:07,580 --> 03:10:08,220
I'm happy to help.

3936
03:10:08,700 --> 03:10:09,820
I'm getting a little verklempt.

3937
03:10:09,820 --> 03:10:11,900
I have to admit it's not just the call.

3938
03:10:11,900 --> 03:10:16,220
I mean, but just just everything I'm seeing in chat right now is just amazing for Bobby

3939
03:10:16,220 --> 03:10:17,980
to be, you know, something.

3940
03:10:17,980 --> 03:10:18,480
Yeah.

3941
03:10:19,660 --> 03:10:20,780
There was a big net split.

3942
03:10:20,780 --> 03:10:23,020
So we just lost like a quarter of the chat room, unfortunately.

3943
03:10:23,020 --> 03:10:24,860
But, you know, yay, tech issues.

3944
03:10:25,420 --> 03:10:25,920
Hooray.

3945
03:10:27,100 --> 03:10:28,700
But what was I gonna say with that?

3946
03:10:29,420 --> 03:10:30,860
My train of thought is derailing.

3947
03:10:31,260 --> 03:10:39,340
This was going to say is that earlier you had that story about the kid who said the

3948
03:10:39,340 --> 03:10:41,260
stupid thing on the Internet and ended up in jail.

3949
03:10:41,260 --> 03:10:44,300
And we have a lot of these words going around the Internet sometime.

3950
03:10:44,300 --> 03:10:46,860
And I would never expect this of people listening to the show.

3951
03:10:46,860 --> 03:10:51,580
But I think one thing we need to keep in mind is that, you know, some people are playing

3952
03:10:51,580 --> 03:10:57,260
video games to kind of escape reality, such as the very difficult thing that he just shared

3953
03:10:57,260 --> 03:11:01,580
with us, which is not an easy thing to get on some radio show and talk about what happened.

3954
03:11:01,580 --> 03:11:05,020
So, you know, I commend him for being able to do that and keeping it together even as

3955
03:11:05,020 --> 03:11:05,660
much as he did.

3956
03:11:06,540 --> 03:11:10,780
But you never know who's going to be on the other end of that game you're playing in that

3957
03:11:10,780 --> 03:11:13,020
MMO or on that Xbox Live.

3958
03:11:13,020 --> 03:11:16,940
So, you know, have a little decency for each other.

3959
03:11:16,940 --> 03:11:19,020
And, you know, anyway.

3960
03:11:20,620 --> 03:11:22,860
Just think, do you want it being said to you?

3961
03:11:22,860 --> 03:11:25,420
And even more, do you want it being said to someone you care about?

3962
03:11:26,140 --> 03:11:29,980
So, because there's people who can take it, but they don't take it when it's somebody

3963
03:11:29,980 --> 03:11:31,340
that they care about.

3964
03:11:31,340 --> 03:11:33,420
So, yeah, just think about it that way.

3965
03:11:33,980 --> 03:11:34,380
All right.

3966
03:11:35,500 --> 03:11:40,300
Well, anyhow, do we have any other last minute stories to try and transition us back onto

3967
03:11:41,100 --> 03:11:42,940
the video game news we were talking about earlier?

3968
03:11:42,940 --> 03:11:46,860
I think, oh, yeah, I got through the Twitter topic, which was the only one that we got.

3969
03:11:47,500 --> 03:11:54,540
But they're selling an Earthbound Zero reproduction NES cart.

3970
03:11:56,380 --> 03:12:02,460
It's an English translated ROM of, you know, the game Mother.

3971
03:12:03,020 --> 03:12:06,140
And, of course, it never came out over here.

3972
03:12:06,140 --> 03:12:11,580
And I guess it's been, I don't know who's doing the reproduction of it or if it even

3973
03:12:11,580 --> 03:12:11,980
works.

3974
03:12:13,580 --> 03:12:17,260
Wasn't that the one that had the piracy enabled, though, that would let the piracy of the

3975
03:12:17,260 --> 03:12:19,580
anti-piracy thing that would like that was shut down the game?

3976
03:12:21,660 --> 03:12:23,180
Yeah, no, I know that would get harder.

3977
03:12:23,260 --> 03:12:27,340
But I thought Earthbound Zero even had the prototype ROM was infamous for having these

3978
03:12:27,340 --> 03:12:28,380
game breaking bugs in it.

3979
03:12:28,380 --> 03:12:29,980
But maybe the hackers fix that.

3980
03:12:29,980 --> 03:12:30,620
I don't remember.

3981
03:12:30,620 --> 03:12:31,500
It's been so long.

3982
03:12:31,500 --> 03:12:32,540
Hackers gonna hack.

3983
03:12:32,540 --> 03:12:35,420
It seems like it was so long ago that that all.

3984
03:12:37,740 --> 03:12:41,580
Yeah, I'm not sure if it actually does anything or if it's just a reproduction of the original.

3985
03:12:42,460 --> 03:12:44,380
I don't know what to say.

3986
03:12:44,380 --> 03:12:47,740
I never played Mother, but I always heard it was kind of a glitchy game to begin with,

3987
03:12:47,740 --> 03:12:49,180
like actual version.

3988
03:12:49,900 --> 03:12:52,380
Like, you mean the Earthbound that was on the SNES here?

3989
03:12:53,340 --> 03:12:57,660
Mother, Mother, I think because it wasn't finished, it was still glitchy.

3990
03:12:57,660 --> 03:12:59,420
Yes, absolutely.

3991
03:13:00,140 --> 03:13:00,540
All right.

3992
03:13:01,500 --> 03:13:03,500
Well, that does it for the Skype line tonight.

3993
03:13:03,500 --> 03:13:04,780
That does it for our Twitter topics.

3994
03:13:04,780 --> 03:13:09,740
I think that did it for the last minute stories as well, unless you have anything else to

3995
03:13:09,740 --> 03:13:10,620
surprise me with over there.

3996
03:13:11,500 --> 03:13:13,980
No, I know.

3997
03:13:14,780 --> 03:13:15,420
Okay.

3998
03:13:15,420 --> 03:13:17,020
I love all the Hello Kitty everywhere.

3999
03:13:17,980 --> 03:13:20,220
Yeah, you can thank Slidekick for some of that.

4000
03:13:20,780 --> 03:13:22,540
Slidekick, I want to thank you for being here.

4001
03:13:22,540 --> 03:13:24,300
Thank you so much for having me.

4002
03:13:24,300 --> 03:13:28,220
You know, I've been listening for years and I'm so glad that I finally was able to come

4003
03:13:28,220 --> 03:13:29,740
up and get on the show.

4004
03:13:29,740 --> 03:13:30,380
11 years.

4005
03:13:30,380 --> 03:13:34,700
You really and you really got to run the gauntlet of an OLR show tonight from the Dick and Fart

4006
03:13:34,700 --> 03:13:36,540
jokes and the stuff at the beginning.

4007
03:13:36,540 --> 03:13:38,380
It's just some real heavy stuff there at the end.

4008
03:13:38,380 --> 03:13:42,300
So it's like you got a whole two years worth of OLR emotions in one show.

4009
03:13:42,300 --> 03:13:43,340
So congratulations.

4010
03:13:43,340 --> 03:13:44,700
Every gamer has their voice here.

4011
03:13:44,700 --> 03:13:45,820
So thank you.

4012
03:13:45,820 --> 03:13:47,340
Yes, that's what we strive for.

4013
03:13:47,340 --> 03:13:49,340
So best of luck with your project.

4014
03:13:49,340 --> 03:13:50,060
Congratulations.

4015
03:13:50,060 --> 03:13:51,900
You've made it a year on gamebuoy.org.

4016
03:13:51,900 --> 03:13:52,400
Thank you.

4017
03:13:53,020 --> 03:13:56,860
And I look forward to sharing the stage with you at GamerX.

4018
03:13:56,860 --> 03:13:57,820
It'll be a lot of fun.

4019
03:13:57,820 --> 03:13:58,940
And it'll be my honor.

4020
03:13:58,940 --> 03:14:00,060
Everybody else.

4021
03:14:00,060 --> 03:14:01,020
Aw, shucks.

4022
03:14:01,020 --> 03:14:02,060
One more time with the plugs.

4023
03:14:02,060 --> 03:14:03,340
How can they find your fine show?

4024
03:14:03,340 --> 03:14:08,060
We're over at gamebuoy.org and you can find all our social links over there.

4025
03:14:08,060 --> 03:14:09,740
You can find us on iTunes.

4026
03:14:09,740 --> 03:14:10,860
It's game and buoy.

4027
03:14:10,860 --> 03:14:12,380
B-U-O-Y.

4028
03:14:12,380 --> 03:14:19,260
And I relinked your website on my Tumblr post.

4029
03:14:20,140 --> 03:14:22,220
When I did my pitch of the show today.

4030
03:14:22,940 --> 03:14:24,700
So you can also find it there.

4031
03:14:25,580 --> 03:14:26,540
We love OLR.

4032
03:14:26,540 --> 03:14:28,300
We love all our OLR listeners.

4033
03:14:28,300 --> 03:14:31,340
You know, we're usually in chat when OLR is going on.

4034
03:14:31,340 --> 03:14:34,460
So if you haven't checked us out yet, we'd love to hear from you.

4035
03:14:34,460 --> 03:14:36,780
And hope you enjoy what you hear.

4036
03:14:36,780 --> 03:14:39,820
We love indie podcasts, period.

4037
03:14:39,820 --> 03:14:44,940
I mean, I don't want to sound shady or anything, but do you think some of the corporate

4038
03:14:44,940 --> 03:14:47,500
cast out there could have done some of these calls we did tonight?

4039
03:14:47,500 --> 03:14:48,000
No.

4040
03:14:48,880 --> 03:14:51,280
You know, I have to do that's the difference, y'all.

4041
03:14:51,280 --> 03:14:52,480
That's the difference.

4042
03:14:52,480 --> 03:14:57,200
We might have to get Alan in here because Tim TRP in chat says we demand a fabulous

4043
03:14:57,200 --> 03:14:58,400
Flames reunion show.

4044
03:14:58,400 --> 03:14:59,120
Where's Alan?

4045
03:14:59,920 --> 03:15:01,680
Oh, I think he ran outside or something.

4046
03:15:02,320 --> 03:15:02,720
Damn.

4047
03:15:02,720 --> 03:15:02,960
All right.

4048
03:15:02,960 --> 03:15:03,520
I mean, the heat.

4049
03:15:04,160 --> 03:15:04,640
Yeah, maybe.

4050
03:15:04,640 --> 03:15:07,200
Maybe he's trying to figure out how to make it cooler in here.

4051
03:15:07,200 --> 03:15:07,520
All right.

4052
03:15:07,520 --> 03:15:08,240
Well, we do have.

4053
03:15:08,240 --> 03:15:08,880
Here he is.

4054
03:15:08,880 --> 03:15:13,440
Oh, Alan, when's the fabulous Flames reunion show, which definitely look that up on iTunes,

4055
03:15:13,440 --> 03:15:13,940
y'all.

4056
03:15:13,940 --> 03:15:19,300
It's one week after I'm in, I win $50 billion in the lottery.

4057
03:15:20,260 --> 03:15:21,300
We're going to win the lottery.

4058
03:15:21,300 --> 03:15:21,800
Yay.

4059
03:15:23,540 --> 03:15:24,040
All right.

4060
03:15:24,660 --> 03:15:25,220
That's it.

4061
03:15:25,220 --> 03:15:28,420
Alan, did you have a final thought for the listeners tonight before you run out?

4062
03:15:29,300 --> 03:15:33,060
I still think it may actually be a few degrees hotter outside than it is in here.

4063
03:15:33,700 --> 03:15:34,340
Sweet Jesus.

4064
03:15:34,340 --> 03:15:34,900
When am I?

4065
03:15:34,900 --> 03:15:36,580
When did I move to Phoenix?

4066
03:15:36,580 --> 03:15:37,080
All right.

4067
03:15:37,620 --> 03:15:42,100
You know what's happening, by the way, next Sunday for me, we're on the house hunt.

4068
03:15:42,100 --> 03:15:43,140
Oh, good luck.

4069
03:15:43,140 --> 03:15:47,380
Which may also, which may end up being a new dedicated studio.

4070
03:15:47,380 --> 03:15:48,340
That would be nice.

4071
03:15:48,340 --> 03:15:49,300
Not going to complain.

4072
03:15:49,300 --> 03:15:49,940
So.

4073
03:15:49,940 --> 03:15:50,440
All right.

4074
03:15:51,220 --> 03:15:54,580
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts so we can wrap up and head on out of here.

4075
03:15:54,580 --> 03:15:56,020
Again, Slidekick, thank you for being here.

4076
03:15:56,020 --> 03:15:57,940
Do you have an official final thought for our listeners tonight?

4077
03:15:59,140 --> 03:16:00,180
I want a burger.

4078
03:16:01,380 --> 03:16:02,100
Oh my God.

4079
03:16:02,100 --> 03:16:02,580
So do I.

4080
03:16:02,580 --> 03:16:03,460
I'm so hungry.

4081
03:16:03,460 --> 03:16:04,740
Burgers are pretty fucking good.

4082
03:16:04,740 --> 03:16:05,220
I gotta say.

4083
03:16:05,220 --> 03:16:06,740
I'm going to hit the drive-through on my way home.

4084
03:16:06,740 --> 03:16:07,240
All right.

4085
03:16:08,340 --> 03:16:08,900
Get it, girl.

4086
03:16:10,260 --> 03:16:10,420
Yeah.

4087
03:16:10,420 --> 03:16:11,940
You got 30 minutes to get to Pinkberry.

4088
03:16:11,940 --> 03:16:12,420
Ooh, girl.

4089
03:16:12,420 --> 03:16:12,980
All right.

4090
03:16:13,540 --> 03:16:15,140
Loki, uh, you're packing up.

4091
03:16:15,140 --> 03:16:15,860
You're ready to go.

4092
03:16:15,860 --> 03:16:18,900
Good luck with all your, uh, uh, disease and everything.

4093
03:16:18,900 --> 03:16:20,260
Hope you're cured by next week.

4094
03:16:20,980 --> 03:16:24,020
Make sure that you find those rats that gave you the bubonic plague.

4095
03:16:24,900 --> 03:16:25,460
Okay.

4096
03:16:25,460 --> 03:16:25,700
All right.

4097
03:16:25,700 --> 03:16:26,980
At least it's not herpes.

4098
03:16:26,980 --> 03:16:28,660
Uh, your final thought tonight.

4099
03:16:28,660 --> 03:16:29,620
And here's only with weather.

4100
03:16:29,620 --> 03:16:30,120
It's hot.

4101
03:16:32,420 --> 03:16:36,580
My final thought is that if you live in Northern California, you should make plans to come see

4102
03:16:36,580 --> 03:16:40,180
Clue at the Colonial Theater in Sacramento on July 27th.

4103
03:16:40,180 --> 03:16:41,220
I'm playing Colonel Mustard.

4104
03:16:41,220 --> 03:16:41,860
It'll be fun.

4105
03:16:41,860 --> 03:16:42,500
Yes, I do.

4106
03:16:42,580 --> 03:16:43,700
Did you finally find a tie?

4107
03:16:43,700 --> 03:16:44,420
I do others too.

4108
03:16:44,420 --> 03:16:45,300
I ordered one online.

4109
03:16:45,300 --> 03:16:45,620
Yes.

4110
03:16:45,620 --> 03:16:49,140
It's not perfect, but it's, it's, I had to get one that's a little more yellow than his

4111
03:16:49,140 --> 03:16:50,900
in the movie, but he is Colonel Mustard, right?

4112
03:16:50,900 --> 03:16:53,060
And he will be like under the screen.

4113
03:16:53,060 --> 03:16:53,860
Exactly.

4114
03:16:53,860 --> 03:16:54,740
That's what I figure.

4115
03:16:54,740 --> 03:16:59,780
And, and, uh, my director who happens to be the cohost of another show on this network

4116
03:16:59,780 --> 03:17:00,980
is like, you know what?

4117
03:17:01,540 --> 03:17:03,380
I'm at the point where just get it close.

4118
03:17:04,180 --> 03:17:06,580
And I can't, I can't blame her for that.

4119
03:17:06,580 --> 03:17:06,980
All right.

4120
03:17:06,980 --> 03:17:09,780
Um, last but not least, Dark Soccer, your final thoughts tonight?

4121
03:17:10,740 --> 03:17:12,820
I actually have an appetite tonight.

4122
03:17:12,820 --> 03:17:16,580
Like I had French toast this morning and I thought I wouldn't be hungry all day.

4123
03:17:16,580 --> 03:17:17,940
I'm actually hungry right now.

4124
03:17:17,940 --> 03:17:18,660
All right.

4125
03:17:18,660 --> 03:17:20,100
Get some Pinkberry girl.

4126
03:17:20,100 --> 03:17:20,420
All right.

4127
03:17:21,380 --> 03:17:22,420
That's it you guys.

4128
03:17:22,420 --> 03:17:27,460

4129

It's much more than just some silly little radio show with a bunch of dick and fart jokes.

4130
03:17:32,340 --> 03:17:34,180
I hope tonight's show proved that for y'all.

4131
03:17:34,180 --> 03:17:36,420
Have a wonderful night and we'll see you next time.
