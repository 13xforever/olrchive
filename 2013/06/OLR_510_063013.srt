1
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:26,437
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, June 30, 2013, Microsoft reportedly drops Xbox Live patching fees, the Dave & Buster's chain is searching for the next big game, and Nintendo fans start a petition to end region locking on the Wii U.

2
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:37,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:00:37,701 --> 00:00:43,524
[SPEAKER_06]: It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 510, June the 30th of 2013.

4
00:00:45,264 --> 00:00:57,049
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Rob Roberts and I am here to talk with you guys about video games and gaming culture and gaming roles and gaming WTFs with my co-host, joining me as she has faithfully for the past 11 years,

5
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

6
00:01:00,551 --> 00:01:00,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Bleh.

7
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:02,112
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you?

8
00:01:02,132 --> 00:01:03,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you still sick 11 years later?

9
00:01:04,033 --> 00:01:04,393
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey.

10
00:01:05,394 --> 00:01:05,914
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

11
00:01:05,994 --> 00:01:06,534
[SPEAKER_11]: It's funny.

12
00:01:06,795 --> 00:01:10,036
[SPEAKER_11]: My voice is getting a little bit better, but I still have the cough, so.

13
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:10,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Aw.

14
00:01:11,017 --> 00:01:11,937
[SPEAKER_11]: Ricola.

15
00:01:12,598 --> 00:01:14,819
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm living on a steady diet of Ricola, but you know what?

16
00:01:15,699 --> 00:01:16,720
[SPEAKER_11]: I've gone down a size.

17
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:19,960
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks to my diet of Ricola

18
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:38,194
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing alright.

19
00:01:38,354 --> 00:01:41,196
[SPEAKER_06]: So, for those that... Loki has a bubonic plague.

20
00:01:41,456 --> 00:01:48,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's a good thing it's not a video show because if you guys could see Loki, he's got like chicken pox on his hands or something.

21
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's not really chicken pox.

22
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:57,327
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know what chicken pox look like because I've never had it, but it's an extreme... Well, it's not extremely rare, but it's rare.

23
00:01:58,328 --> 00:01:59,789
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hand, foot, and mouth disease.

24
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:04,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually something that, you know... Is that where you keep putting your foot in your mouth?

25
00:02:04,292 --> 00:02:05,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you do that a lot on this show.

26
00:02:06,053 --> 00:02:07,493
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

27
00:02:28,678 --> 00:02:29,560
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

28
00:02:41,004 --> 00:02:41,644
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

29
00:03:00,771 --> 00:03:03,855
[SPEAKER_06]: The listeners do not want to catch foot and mouth disease or whatever it is you have.

30
00:03:03,915 --> 00:03:05,177
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's only contagious.

31
00:03:05,397 --> 00:03:10,044
[SPEAKER_04]: It's mainly if you're dealing with your children or something like that.

32
00:03:10,544 --> 00:03:13,829
[SPEAKER_04]: You can catch it from changing their diapers or something like that.

33
00:03:13,909 --> 00:03:15,071
[SPEAKER_04]: You can catch it from...

34
00:03:16,152 --> 00:03:18,093
[SPEAKER_04]: She had baby butt disease

35
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:35,919
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't expect you to do anything different any other day.

36
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:37,980
[SPEAKER_11]: We could set up a quarantine.

37
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,100
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we've got some canvas somewhere.

38
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Should we drape a plastic sheet over Loki?

39
00:03:43,021 --> 00:03:45,522
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll be the Loki in the plastic bubble.

40
00:03:46,122 --> 00:03:55,125
[SPEAKER_04]: But other than that, I've been just staying at home, just doing a lot of watching of instructional videos for Unity stuff.

41
00:03:55,185 --> 00:03:56,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Your programming stuff is...

42
00:03:57,026 --> 00:04:00,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I finished, well, I don't know if you'd call it finished.

43
00:04:00,827 --> 00:04:08,590
[SPEAKER_04]: I finished slash quit my C++ thing because I was just like, listen, I don't really care about all this stuff that they're talking about.

44
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:12,891
[SPEAKER_04]: And really, it doesn't, when you work with Unity and stuff, it doesn't really apply.

45
00:04:13,431 --> 00:04:30,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, some of the very low-level things they're teaching you in C++, and sure, I'll go back to it someday, but for right now, I just wanted a basic understanding of, like, programming languages, and that's what I got, and that, you know, now when they're showing Unity stuff, I can understand what they're doing, and I'm not like, what?

46
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,801
[SPEAKER_04]: What's he mean by that?

47
00:04:33,682 --> 00:04:37,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I look forward to seeing whatever project, especially the one you were telling me about before the show.

48
00:04:37,606 --> 00:04:38,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds very ambitious.

49
00:04:39,288 --> 00:04:41,029
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like an OLR dream game in the future.

50
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,212
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Peter Molyneux crap.

51
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:47,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you imagine if Peter Molyneux had Loki's ideas?

52
00:04:47,796 --> 00:04:49,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Because this is where we're headed now.

53
00:04:49,838 --> 00:04:51,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki's learning programming.

54
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,821
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki's going to come up with these games.

55
00:04:52,881 --> 00:04:53,642
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be crazy.

56
00:04:54,282 --> 00:04:57,624
[SPEAKER_06]: So a couple quick things and then we'll get to our guests because we have a guest here in the studio.

57
00:04:58,605 --> 00:05:07,850
[SPEAKER_06]: First off, I know much of the country is under a heat wave right now, but it is hotter than Satan's taint here in Sacramento right now and just as sweaty.

58
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:13,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's humid and we bitch here in Sacramento about the humidity when it's like above zero.

59
00:05:13,953 --> 00:05:14,313
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I know.

60
00:05:14,393 --> 00:05:15,434
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not East Coast humid.

61
00:05:15,454 --> 00:05:18,015
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that, but it's bad for West Coast.

62
00:05:18,056 --> 00:05:18,476
[SPEAKER_06]: It's bad.

63
00:05:20,417 --> 00:05:21,377
[SPEAKER_06]: That was one thing I was going to say.

64
00:05:21,397 --> 00:05:26,078
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I think I was going to say something gaming related, but I forgot because I was thinking about how fucking hot it was.

65
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:31,740
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess with that, speaking of Satan's taint, let's go introduce our guest.

66
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,300
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm kidding.

67
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:33,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Say hello, everybody.

68
00:05:34,061 --> 00:05:37,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Joining us live in studio tonight, a good friend of mine.

69
00:05:37,582 --> 00:05:41,644
[SPEAKER_06]: We go way back years and years, and he hosts another show that you all should be listening to.

70
00:05:42,044 --> 00:05:45,505
[SPEAKER_06]: It's First Mate Slidekick from the GameBooey.org podcast.

71
00:05:45,825 --> 00:05:46,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Ahoi!

72
00:05:46,565 --> 00:05:47,226
[SPEAKER_06]: How you doing?

73
00:05:48,006 --> 00:05:50,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty well, aside from the roasting like a chicken part.

74
00:05:50,907 --> 00:05:53,068
[SPEAKER_07]: More like a pig at a luau.

75
00:05:53,328 --> 00:05:55,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's pretty bad here in Sacramento, right?

76
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:59,671
[SPEAKER_06]: You're visiting us for the weekend from, where do you live usually?

77
00:05:59,731 --> 00:06:00,371
[SPEAKER_06]: The Bay Area.

78
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:00,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

79
00:06:02,592 --> 00:06:04,833
[SPEAKER_06]: The big nebula of the Bay.

80
00:06:05,453 --> 00:06:05,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

81
00:06:05,854 --> 00:06:06,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, welcome.

82
00:06:07,474 --> 00:06:13,157
[SPEAKER_06]: So Spike, your co-host at Gamebuoy.org was here about, I think it was about, actually it was about two months ago at this point.

83
00:06:13,257 --> 00:06:13,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

84
00:06:13,697 --> 00:06:18,259
[SPEAKER_06]: So assuming we've picked up any new listeners between now and then, tell us a little bit about Gamebuoy.org.

85
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:19,339
[SPEAKER_07]: What's your show all about?

86
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:24,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we're your port of call for gaming news and views that maybe aren't on your radar, but definitely should be.

87
00:06:24,701 --> 00:06:28,003
[SPEAKER_07]: What we kind of focus on are left of center news and...

88
00:06:28,883 --> 00:06:29,484
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

89
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:59,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really, but we think it's important for people who are interested in this type of content and these sorts of games to have a place to go to hear the news.

90
00:06:59,973 --> 00:07:08,282
[SPEAKER_07]: We find all this stuff on all the big news sites, but with all the big news that happens, it sometimes gets lost, so we try to...

91
00:07:08,502 --> 00:07:31,629
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, sure, like, all this fuckery about the Xbox One, I mean, that whole talk dominated E3, and I'm sure there's lots of great, and I use my quotey fingers, Kensha Hall games, in memory of the hall that used to be there, that kind of fall off the radar, because, you know, everybody's too preoccupied with all this crap about Xbox versus Sony and Nintendo out of left field and all that.

92
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:44,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, yeah, and I mean, we talk about Xbox One and some of the bigger stuff, too, but, you know, we just try to keep our fingers on the pulse of the stuff that you might not hear a lot about, so hopefully we succeed with that.

93
00:07:44,742 --> 00:07:46,364
[SPEAKER_07]: And where can folks hear your show?

94
00:07:46,624 --> 00:07:55,953
[SPEAKER_07]: We're over at GameBooey.org, and you can get all of our episodes there, and also links to all our social networks, so...

95
00:07:57,034 --> 00:08:00,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully some of you, all our peeps, will come and listen to us and say hi.

96
00:08:00,716 --> 00:08:04,738
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like Game Boy, but you have a U before the O, like a buoy.

97
00:08:04,878 --> 00:08:05,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, like a boat buoy.

98
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:09,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Hence why you're pirates and first mates and all that.

99
00:08:09,301 --> 00:08:13,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, the listeners are complaining that you're too quiet, so I'm trying to turn you in.

100
00:08:13,223 --> 00:08:14,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, that's a first.

101
00:08:15,084 --> 00:08:15,324
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

102
00:08:15,344 --> 00:08:20,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, especially since back when we were raiding, I'd have to turn you way down.

103
00:08:20,287 --> 00:08:20,847
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

104
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,829
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I'd have to turn Rob even further down, because...

105
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:28,871
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob would be like, okay, everybody on the main... Tank, move!

106
00:08:29,331 --> 00:08:30,092
[SPEAKER_11]: Tank, move!

107
00:08:30,772 --> 00:08:32,693
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to yell at people when I play WoW.

108
00:08:32,773 --> 00:08:35,034
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't help it.

109
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:36,215
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just the way I am.

110
00:08:37,075 --> 00:08:47,280
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you got some fans in the chatty room over at live.vognetwork.com because this show, you know, the one that does all the mainstream stuff here where every gamer has a voice.

[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

121
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:54,224
[SPEAKER_06]: He has to say that, though, because we're doing the stuff with Koopa Club and Game Bar and Gamer X. No, I'm kidding.

122
00:09:54,684 --> 00:09:55,184
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kidding.

123
00:09:55,545 --> 00:09:58,507
[SPEAKER_06]: What a great bunch of guys all around the internet doing those podcasts.

124
00:09:58,767 --> 00:09:59,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Good stuff.

125
00:10:00,508 --> 00:10:03,270
[SPEAKER_06]: ClericalEra404 also suggests a cruise to Alaska.

126
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi!

127
00:10:04,591 --> 00:10:06,893
[SPEAKER_06]: And Codeman says, I love Bobby.

128
00:10:07,513 --> 00:10:09,174
[SPEAKER_06]: We all love Bobby here at the Voice Geeks Network.

129
00:10:09,194 --> 00:10:11,676
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why we get pissed when all this bad shit keeps happening to him.

130
00:10:12,597 --> 00:10:12,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

131
00:10:13,557 --> 00:10:15,099
[SPEAKER_11]: How about an open letter to bad shit?

132
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,421
[SPEAKER_11]: Knock it off.

133
00:10:16,722 --> 00:10:17,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop it.

134
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:18,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Not love, OLR.

135
00:10:18,844 --> 00:10:20,907
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

136
00:10:21,107 --> 00:10:27,375
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought of the other announcement I wanted to make real quick, and then I'll get back to John, or excuse me, First Mate Slidekick.

00:10:29,118 --> 00:10:31,421
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we'll move on with the show.

[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

141
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,611
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

142
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:18,559
[SPEAKER_04]: and DarkSakura.

143
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:37,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, back to First Mate Slidekick since I'm supposed to be talking to you.

144
00:11:38,743 --> 00:11:41,405
[SPEAKER_06]: What are some of the topics you've talked about on Game Buoy lately?

145
00:11:41,966 --> 00:11:50,312
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing I kind of like about your show is that since you do a central topic, you pick a lot of stuff that's not necessarily tied into the news.

146
00:11:52,073 --> 00:11:54,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Your April Fool's show was all about Tingle, right?

147
00:11:54,155 --> 00:11:55,756
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it was our Tingle cast.

148
00:11:56,276 --> 00:12:02,462
[SPEAKER_06]: and what you did another show about I know you did an LGBT show you did what was your most recent one?

149
00:12:03,163 --> 00:12:20,900
[SPEAKER_07]: The most recent one we did was like the recent full episode was our E3 blowout which is a yearly thing now second year actually a new thing that we've done on the site is introduce Game Buoy Micro which are little tiny podcasts and by tiny I mean like a half hour because our podcast is

150
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,200
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

151
00:12:47,972 --> 00:12:54,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Since you did, I know one of the micros you did, because I actually listened to it, you guys went and saw the Best Buy Nintendo E3.

152
00:12:54,795 --> 00:12:56,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we actually took some YouTube video as well.

153
00:12:57,225 --> 00:12:57,645
[SPEAKER_06]: How was that?

154
00:12:57,685 --> 00:13:00,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Not to steal the thunder of your show, but give us the Cliff Notes version.

155
00:13:00,086 --> 00:13:00,446
[SPEAKER_06]: How was it?

156
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,907
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it was kind of cool.

157
00:13:02,927 --> 00:13:13,090
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like any time you go to a Nintendo event, whether it's just camping out for a Wii or going to something like this, Nintendo crowds are usually pretty cool.

158
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:19,012
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a really long wait, but to Nintendo's credit, they didn't cut it off right at 6 or whatever.

159
00:13:19,172 --> 00:13:20,212
[SPEAKER_07]: How long was long?

160
00:13:21,072 --> 00:13:23,534
[SPEAKER_07]: We were in line for about five and a half hours.

161
00:13:24,134 --> 00:13:24,995
[SPEAKER_07]: We got to play one game.

162
00:13:25,675 --> 00:13:26,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like the real E3.

163
00:13:27,537 --> 00:13:28,497
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, pretty much.

164
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Authentic experience.

165
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,219
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what they were actually saying.

166
00:13:31,499 --> 00:13:35,942
[SPEAKER_07]: The Nintendo representatives there were saying it's an authentic E3 experience.

167
00:13:36,543 --> 00:13:37,483
[SPEAKER_07]: They give us pizza.

168
00:13:38,544 --> 00:13:44,148
[SPEAKER_07]: P-I-Z-Z-A Did they give you whipped cream pouring like waterfalls?

169
00:13:44,188 --> 00:13:44,948
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they didn't.

170
00:13:44,968 --> 00:13:46,509
[SPEAKER_07]: Cheap bastards.

171
00:13:48,837 --> 00:13:55,363
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I thought it was really cool that they put it on and that they were so cooperative in that.

172
00:13:55,403 --> 00:13:57,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Best Buy, to their credit, was really cooperative too.

173
00:13:58,426 --> 00:13:59,787
[SPEAKER_07]: They could have just been like, nope, it's five.

174
00:14:00,187 --> 00:14:02,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone who hasn't played yet doesn't get to play.

175
00:14:02,289 --> 00:14:11,397
[SPEAKER_07]: But they tried to get everyone to play what they wanted and they had little Mario Kart 8 flags to give you just for waiting in line.

176
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:12,218
[SPEAKER_07]: So I mean, it was really cool.

177
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:17,303
[SPEAKER_04]: I still think the best way, you know, approach to E3 was like Xbox.

178
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:18,824
[SPEAKER_04]: I only got Xbox.

179
00:14:19,205 --> 00:14:28,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, 2005 or 2006 when they did that, we're bringing E3 home and they had like demos for games, like same demos that were out there.

180
00:14:28,193 --> 00:14:29,694
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, why don't they do that?

181
00:14:29,715 --> 00:14:32,077
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand why they can't do that now.

182
00:14:32,117 --> 00:14:35,360
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I know a lot of that doesn't run on like final hardware and stuff, but...

183
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:44,107
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the reason why they don't is there's too many people that make their final judgment of the game based off the E3 demo, and it's too risky in that regard.

184
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:47,590
[SPEAKER_06]: I honestly think that's a big part of it.

185
00:14:47,931 --> 00:14:55,037
[SPEAKER_06]: E3 builds are usually really early on in the development, and there's too many people that make their decision like, oh, this game sucks, based off the demo.

186
00:14:55,097 --> 00:14:56,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Demos carry a lot of weight.

187
00:14:56,678 --> 00:15:02,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but these people, though, are the same dumb people that will buy a game based off of a review score from one outlet.

188
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:07,222
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, they're very fickle anyways, so I don't know why we should punish them.

189
00:15:07,262 --> 00:15:11,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Considering that, you know, it's going to get a good review and they're like, well, I guess I'll buy it.

190
00:15:11,984 --> 00:15:12,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.

191
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:15,046
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, because, you know, iGen liked it or something.

192
00:15:17,386 --> 00:15:19,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Quickly, also about the Nintendo experience.

193
00:15:19,067 --> 00:15:19,767
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you play?

194
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:22,687
[SPEAKER_06]: You got your hands on with... Spike did Mario Kart 8.

195
00:15:22,747 --> 00:15:25,268
[SPEAKER_06]: You did the Mario... I did Mario 3D World, yeah.

196
00:15:26,168 --> 00:15:28,689
[SPEAKER_06]: The Mario 3D fused with Super Mario 2 game.

197
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:29,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

198
00:15:29,609 --> 00:15:29,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Cats.

199
00:15:30,789 --> 00:15:31,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Super Mario Cats.

200
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:32,310
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why you need to know.

201
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Super Mario Cats, yeah.

202
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,470
[SPEAKER_07]: It was cool.

203
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:42,612
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it was kind of chaotic, and I've actually... I think it was over on US Gamer, which is Jeremy Parrish's new...

204
00:15:43,152 --> 00:15:43,472
[SPEAKER_07]: Outlet.

205
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:48,256
[SPEAKER_07]: They were describing it as chaotic too, but I mean like in a good way.

206
00:15:48,316 --> 00:15:50,078
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was fun, you know.

207
00:15:50,578 --> 00:15:52,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Mario Party's chaotic if you play with me.

208
00:15:53,221 --> 00:15:54,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Mario Party's always chaotic.

209
00:15:54,622 --> 00:15:56,443
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything is chaotic if they play with you, Rob.

210
00:15:56,463 --> 00:15:56,944
[SPEAKER_11]: Shut up!

211
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:57,424
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey.

212
00:15:58,985 --> 00:15:59,866
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been here 11 years.

213
00:15:59,886 --> 00:16:01,127
[SPEAKER_11]: I have the right to say whatever I want to.

214
00:16:03,618 --> 00:16:04,278
[SPEAKER_06]: But did you have fun?

215
00:16:04,638 --> 00:16:05,339
[SPEAKER_06]: I did, I did.

216
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:09,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you make your judgment on the entire game based off that demo?

217
00:16:10,901 --> 00:16:20,265
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I mean, I kind of made my judgment on that game based on the Nintendo Direct, honestly, so... You're like, it's Mario and Princess Floats, I'm in.

218
00:16:20,765 --> 00:16:29,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty much, you know, I'm a shameless Nintendo fanboy, but, you know, it was good to get a chance to play it and to be able to, like, speak to that, and...

219
00:16:30,109 --> 00:16:37,615
[SPEAKER_07]: And just being able to see the games that I didn't play, like watching Captain Spike play Mario Kart 8 and Wind Waker HD.

220
00:16:38,135 --> 00:16:47,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Towards the end, people were starting to just get really annoyed when people were like, oh, I want to play Wind Waker HD because it's actually what they did is they redid the...

221
00:16:48,163 --> 00:16:56,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Original GameCube demo, so you could either do the bird battle, boss battle, or run around Windfall Village.

222
00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:06,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is cool, but compared to doing two races on Mario Kart or two levels in 3D World, it was just a little too long.

223
00:17:06,998 --> 00:17:07,799
[SPEAKER_07]: It looked gorgeous, though.

224
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:12,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze looked good.

225
00:17:12,443 --> 00:17:17,046
[SPEAKER_07]: It was cool to actually get a chance to see it, not just based on E3 videos, though.

226
00:17:18,027 --> 00:17:18,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

227
00:17:19,448 --> 00:17:20,209
[SPEAKER_06]: It was worth it.

228
00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:27,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Going to the chat room for some comments at live.vognetwork.com ShadowNextGen says, Gamers rush to decisions.

229
00:17:27,554 --> 00:17:31,618
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of them don't understand the concept of an alpha or beta build that will be buggy.

230
00:17:31,978 --> 00:17:38,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there's a lot of people playing the Final Fantasy XIV online beta right now that are basically like, oh, this is just a game trial, right?

231
00:17:39,824 --> 00:17:40,845
[SPEAKER_06]: And not really.

232
00:17:40,905 --> 00:17:41,786
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot still missing.

233
00:17:41,866 --> 00:17:45,208
[SPEAKER_11]: We've already seen big changes from the last build to this one.

234
00:17:45,268 --> 00:17:45,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God, yes.

235
00:17:46,769 --> 00:17:50,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Oscar says, I also did Mario 3D World at the Nintendo E3 experience.

236
00:17:51,033 --> 00:17:52,834
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty fun playing the cat form.

237
00:17:52,874 --> 00:17:56,237
[SPEAKER_06]: The dive mechanic is really awesomely integrated in some of the levels.

238
00:17:56,337 --> 00:17:56,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I agree.

239
00:17:58,239 --> 00:17:58,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.

240
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, we'll take it a step back and just kind of getting to know you as a gamer a little bit before we get into tonight's news.

241
00:18:05,465 --> 00:18:06,525
[SPEAKER_06]: I always ask the guests this.

242
00:18:06,806 --> 00:18:08,387
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your favorite video game of all time?

243
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,488
[SPEAKER_07]: That's always a really tough question to answer.

244
00:18:10,508 --> 00:18:11,629
[SPEAKER_06]: You can name a couple if you have to.

245
00:18:12,069 --> 00:18:14,490
[SPEAKER_07]: One of your favorite video games.

246
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:20,394
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to say, if I'm going to just pick one favorite, it would probably be Original Legend of Zelda for NES.

247
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:31,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Just because I grew up with that game, I know it inside and out, and that's the game that I can just put on a virtual console or whatever and play through in a weekend, and I just know where everything is.

248
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:38,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that over-familiarity is always good, but it always feels like going home again.

249
00:18:39,554 --> 00:18:40,735
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you love about video games?

250
00:18:40,755 --> 00:18:43,257
[SPEAKER_07]: What possessed you to want to do a podcast?

251
00:19:00,971 --> 00:19:07,415
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I've known Captain Spike for actually longer than I've known you, so... Yes, you have.

252
00:19:08,035 --> 00:19:09,556
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys have been besties for a long time.

253
00:19:09,576 --> 00:19:15,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we were just always talking about games, and we just thought, you know, why not give it a try?

254
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:23,003
[SPEAKER_07]: We were inspired by y'all here at OLR, so we just thought we'd give it a go, and we've been going for over a year at this point, so...

255
00:19:23,527 --> 00:19:25,269
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a great compliment, though, so thank you.

256
00:19:25,389 --> 00:19:30,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, anytime anybody says, like, oh, I mean, you guys did it, so that helped me learn that, like, I could do it, too.

257
00:19:30,395 --> 00:19:32,717
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm always like, that's, like, actually, like, a great compliment.

258
00:19:33,178 --> 00:19:33,938
[SPEAKER_06]: So, thank you.

259
00:19:34,179 --> 00:19:34,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.

260
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:35,720
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys rock.

261
00:19:36,361 --> 00:19:37,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Aw, you guys rock.

262
00:19:37,502 --> 00:19:38,043
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you.

263
00:19:38,423 --> 00:19:38,964
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you.

264
00:19:39,004 --> 00:19:39,485
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you.

265
00:19:39,905 --> 00:19:41,607
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, love fest here at OLR.

266
00:19:41,687 --> 00:19:41,927
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

267
00:19:42,908 --> 00:19:43,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Not in this heat.

268
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:45,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else you want to plug?

269
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:46,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Ew, sticky.

270
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:50,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other shows, Twitter, things like that you want to plug?

271
00:19:50,294 --> 00:19:55,258
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, they can find all of our social links on our website, GameBooey.org.

272
00:19:55,578 --> 00:20:00,942
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I just would like to shout out to Gamer X Convention in San Francisco.

273
00:20:02,063 --> 00:20:08,108
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's for gamers of all genders and that sort of thing.

274
00:20:08,148 --> 00:20:09,989
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to be gay to enjoy Gamer X.

275
00:20:10,069 --> 00:20:10,529
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true.

276
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:18,832
[SPEAKER_07]: And Rob and I and Captain Spike and our friends from Game Bar and Koopa Club are going to be doing a podcasting panel there.

277
00:20:18,872 --> 00:20:28,275
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you happen to be heading out there or you didn't really know about it and you think that sounds like a cool thing, you should go over to gamerconnect.com.

278
00:20:29,415 --> 00:20:30,256
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.org.com

279
00:20:51,613 --> 00:20:52,614
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

280
00:21:17,471 --> 00:21:21,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well thank you and of course, please continue commenting on tonight's news slide kick.

281
00:21:21,512 --> 00:21:22,372
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why we're here.

282
00:21:22,612 --> 00:21:25,472
[SPEAKER_11]: For the record, it's 68 degrees in San Francisco right now.

283
00:21:26,073 --> 00:21:26,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

284
00:21:26,733 --> 00:21:27,713
[SPEAKER_06]: For all you in San Francisco.

285
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:28,613
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, but tomorrow it'll be 80.

286
00:21:29,893 --> 00:21:31,474
[SPEAKER_06]: For all of you in San Francisco.

287
00:21:31,614 --> 00:21:33,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Grandpa, if you're listening, kiss my butt.

288
00:21:34,014 --> 00:21:34,334
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

289
00:21:35,414 --> 00:21:39,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, let's move on into how was your gaming week?

290
00:21:39,655 --> 00:21:44,336
[SPEAKER_06]: We always like to start off the show with a little bit of what types of video games have you been playing this week in Dark Sakura?

291
00:21:44,356 --> 00:21:45,536
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you've had a big week in gaming.

292
00:21:46,356 --> 00:21:47,237
[SPEAKER_11]: I played old stuff.

293
00:21:48,918 --> 00:21:54,142
[SPEAKER_11]: We hooked up the Super Nintendo last night for my friend Amanda's 30th birthday.

294
00:21:54,483 --> 00:21:55,383
[SPEAKER_11]: Happy birthday, Amanda.

295
00:21:56,444 --> 00:22:00,888
[SPEAKER_11]: And we played Turtles in Time.

296
00:22:01,468 --> 00:22:02,489
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

297
00:22:30,848 --> 00:22:34,831
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you are whored, though, you can kill them, which is pretty fun.

298
00:22:36,312 --> 00:22:38,393
[SPEAKER_11]: I always liked doing that when I was way past level.

299
00:22:39,354 --> 00:22:50,861
[SPEAKER_11]: So I played a little bit of Final Fantasy XIV just because I only played a little because of all the stuff going on, especially with being sick and having to clean house and having a party.

300
00:22:51,782 --> 00:22:53,283
[SPEAKER_11]: I finally got to play Cards Against Humanity.

301
00:22:53,383 --> 00:22:55,744
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not a video game, I know, but it's totally wrong.

302
00:22:56,064 --> 00:22:56,905
[SPEAKER_06]: All the nerds are playing it.

303
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:59,606
[SPEAKER_11]: And I got the best win ever.

304
00:23:01,507 --> 00:23:03,908
[SPEAKER_11]: I might say it on air, but it's really horrible.

305
00:23:05,088 --> 00:23:09,810
[SPEAKER_11]: But I did say that it's like an M. Night, whatever his name is.

306
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:16,213
[SPEAKER_11]: The plot twist was that Nickelback was really the perpetually handicapped.

307
00:23:17,532 --> 00:23:18,333
[SPEAKER_06]: and Night Shyamalan.

308
00:23:18,493 --> 00:23:18,954
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, whatever.

309
00:23:18,994 --> 00:23:19,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Shyamalan Dean Dong.

310
00:23:20,356 --> 00:23:21,197
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what Dan calls him.

311
00:23:21,938 --> 00:23:29,429
[SPEAKER_11]: So we had the old school SNES stuff last night and I have played some...

312
00:23:32,234 --> 00:23:32,634
[SPEAKER_11]: Mass Effect 3 3DS

313
00:23:50,341 --> 00:23:55,148
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks to my husband not wanting me to make puppy eyes and whine at him, I have Animal Crossing.

314
00:23:56,049 --> 00:24:00,015
[SPEAKER_11]: He also got himself the last Fire Emblem game for the DS.

315
00:24:00,235 --> 00:24:01,838
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a little something in it for you both.

316
00:24:02,238 --> 00:24:03,781
[SPEAKER_11]: That's good, though.

317
00:24:03,801 --> 00:24:05,724
[SPEAKER_11]: We're probably going to sell my old DSi.

318
00:24:07,725 --> 00:24:09,486
[SPEAKER_11]: We only need to have one of each system.

319
00:24:10,246 --> 00:24:13,328
[SPEAKER_11]: We have my pink GBA.

320
00:24:14,308 --> 00:24:15,569
[SPEAKER_11]: I have the clear pink one.

321
00:24:15,609 --> 00:24:21,732
[SPEAKER_11]: We have the Nintendo SP, whatever they were called, the one that was done up by the NES.

322
00:24:23,013 --> 00:24:27,895
[SPEAKER_11]: Usually it's like when the new stuff comes out, we'll have one each of us and then sell off one of the old ones.

323
00:24:29,776 --> 00:24:30,517
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now we're poor.

324
00:24:31,864 --> 00:24:37,228
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so, uh, I've been playing, what, six hours of Animal Crossing today.

325
00:24:37,869 --> 00:24:41,391
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've already, uh, made the down payment on my house and bought a phone booth.

326
00:24:42,532 --> 00:24:47,796
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, uh, one of my friends on Tumblr, who, uh, I have to say thank you to my name twin if she's listening.

327
00:24:47,816 --> 00:24:53,560
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, we, uh, I got a Dave Strider shirt for anyone who's into Homestuck.

328
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,160
[SPEAKER_11]: It was really cool.

329
00:24:54,601 --> 00:24:58,383
[SPEAKER_11]: So my character's running around in it wearing pink glasses because, ew, pink, but glasses.

330
00:24:59,324 --> 00:25:00,585
[SPEAKER_11]: She looks kind of weird hipster.

331
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,291
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a lot for just one day.

332
00:25:02,311 --> 00:25:04,932
[SPEAKER_06]: You've probably done more in a day than I've done in the three weeks I've owned this.

333
00:25:04,952 --> 00:25:05,933
[SPEAKER_11]: I have all the fruit now.

334
00:25:06,613 --> 00:25:11,135
[SPEAKER_11]: I do not have a watering can and I do not have a slingshot yet.

335
00:25:11,235 --> 00:25:11,655
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll get it.

336
00:25:12,235 --> 00:25:13,356
[SPEAKER_11]: It better be tomorrow.

337
00:25:15,416 --> 00:25:16,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't forget to buy the fortune cookie every day.

338
00:25:18,097 --> 00:25:18,678
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, shoot.

339
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:20,638
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, don't you have to have coins or something?

340
00:25:20,878 --> 00:25:22,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you get those from walking around.

341
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:24,940
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you've been walking around with your 3DS day, you have coins.

342
00:25:25,612 --> 00:25:29,916
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

343
00:25:49,372 --> 00:25:52,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Up to, I think, seven times, I think is where it maxes out.

344
00:25:52,095 --> 00:25:55,319
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought you guys would just run amok through my game.

345
00:25:55,399 --> 00:25:57,382
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm just like, look at my pretty penguin hat.

346
00:25:57,502 --> 00:25:58,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't it awesome?

347
00:25:58,062 --> 00:25:58,683
[SPEAKER_06]: I love your penguin hat.

348
00:25:58,703 --> 00:26:01,166
[SPEAKER_06]: This is why I stopped playing Find Me, because I don't need a better hat.

349
00:26:01,466 --> 00:26:04,330
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob, I honestly like Slakic's hat better.

350
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:04,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

351
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:05,291
[SPEAKER_06]: The Mario hat.

352
00:26:05,311 --> 00:26:05,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

353
00:26:06,172 --> 00:26:08,555
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to have a propeller hat, because that would be awesome.

354
00:26:10,023 --> 00:26:12,744
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, Animal Crossing, that's going to be my life from here on out.

355
00:26:13,264 --> 00:26:15,105
[SPEAKER_11]: I did name my town Normandy, like I said I would.

356
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:16,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Congrats.

357
00:26:16,165 --> 00:26:24,408
[SPEAKER_11]: So either that, so either all of my townsfolk are going to call me Commander, I mean my character Sakura, because every Animal Crossing character I've ever had is Sakura.

358
00:26:24,928 --> 00:26:30,110
[SPEAKER_11]: Either that, or they're all going to have like French words, they'll be like Merred or Ulala or...

359
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:58,964
[SPEAKER_06]: or Zoot today I made my crappy recreation of the VOG logo in my Animal Crossing town because we finished the custom signboard so right when you enter the town you see now a big little VOG logo my ghetto logo I have a goal for this game though to find Dina you want to be reunited I want my lesbian back ours is a love long denied Dina was an aardvark I don't think she was an aardvark I thought she was a duck whatever no Mallory was a duck

360
00:26:59,355 --> 00:27:07,548
[SPEAKER_11]: There were several ducks, Rob I don't give a duck We have diversity You and your only aardvarks can be lesbians

361
00:27:09,972 --> 00:27:11,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, moving on.

362
00:27:11,473 --> 00:27:13,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, I know you haven't been playing Animal Crossing.

363
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:14,076
[SPEAKER_06]: What have you been playing?

364
00:27:14,416 --> 00:27:16,518
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't been playing very much at all, actually, this week.

365
00:27:16,538 --> 00:27:18,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

366
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:25,005
[SPEAKER_04]: The two things I did play this week, one being Final Fantasy XIV, the beta.

367
00:27:25,025 --> 00:27:27,166
[SPEAKER_04]: I played about an hour of that.

368
00:27:27,327 --> 00:27:29,528
[SPEAKER_04]: I was actually going to play more, but then I just kept getting distracted.

369
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:34,392
[SPEAKER_04]: I was supposed to play LittleBigPlanet Karting, but I forgot.

370
00:27:35,413 --> 00:27:37,155
[SPEAKER_04]: Hands are too much anyways to play anything, so...

371
00:27:39,097 --> 00:27:39,917
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

372
00:27:59,376 --> 00:28:01,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, okay, I guess I will.

373
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:07,885
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I get killed because I don't notice that my health is going down because it's too much on the screen.

374
00:28:08,405 --> 00:28:12,570
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a tip I have for fates if you happen to find yourself overwhelmed.

375
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:14,331
[SPEAKER_11]: Run through a big crowd of people.

376
00:28:14,752 --> 00:28:15,773
[SPEAKER_11]: The thing will not follow you.

377
00:28:16,673 --> 00:28:17,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it wasn't that at all.

378
00:28:17,814 --> 00:28:20,136
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even notice it was doing a lot of damage to me.

379
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:25,020
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because I'd get done with one and immediately target the next thing and immediately go.

380
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:29,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, many people don't realize the UI is completely customizable, even on PS3.

381
00:28:30,164 --> 00:28:33,047
[SPEAKER_06]: So if the health bars are not in a unique place for you, try to move them.

382
00:28:33,807 --> 00:28:34,067
[SPEAKER_04]: I should.

383
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:43,770
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the other thing I played was a little bit of Excite Truck this morning because we wanted to entertain Josh.

384
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:51,052
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was trying to get Mario Kart to work, but my disc wouldn't read in my Wii U, which is weird because it did before and now it's not.

385
00:28:57,074 --> 00:29:23,270
[SPEAKER_04]: and then so it's just like okay well I guess we'll do you know we play and then he couldn't understand we play so we did excite truck and he just kind of let it sit there and just coast in a circle so that was kind of fun but I actually did get to play a couple races and stuff and man that game looks really basic now that actually like you know now that you're not zooming through the landscape you know at a high rate of speed it's just very basic looking I'm like wow

386
00:29:24,758 --> 00:29:25,119
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew,

387
00:29:40,018 --> 00:29:52,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks to one of our old listeners of the show and also one of the old players that used to play on the Minecraft server that we had, Lord Gally.

388
00:29:53,067 --> 00:29:57,930
[SPEAKER_04]: He has actually provided or said, hey, you know what, I have a server that not a lot of people play on.

389
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,571
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys want to come play on our server?

390
00:30:00,631 --> 00:30:06,333
[SPEAKER_04]: So he gave me full access to the admin stuff for it, so we'll be able to set it up.

391
00:30:06,373 --> 00:30:11,274
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's actually a lot more flexible than the old one, so I can actually do all the kind of mods I want to do.

392
00:30:11,334 --> 00:30:15,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, somebody needs to build a shrine to Lord Gally first thing for that, because that's an awesome gesture.

393
00:30:15,916 --> 00:30:16,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Lord Gally.

394
00:30:16,676 --> 00:30:24,979
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to check with him, because right now it's set to survival and stuff, so I have to see if he wants to switch it off of that and put it on bucket and everything, so...

395
00:30:25,619 --> 00:30:53,546
[SPEAKER_04]: but now that I have all the tools to do that I just got to sit down and actually research what I want to do I wanted to put a spout craft server on there because spouts pretty awesome because you can create all the custom shapes and stuff like other materials that are unique to the game so you can have new enemies you could have planes cars guns you know all sorts of crazy stuff so I'll see how hard that is and may do that but it looks like it'll be a lot of fun and hopefully we'll get to play it again

396
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:55,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Codeman is bouncing off the walls in chat.

397
00:30:55,447 --> 00:30:56,928
[SPEAKER_06]: He's very excited to hear that it's back.

398
00:30:57,128 --> 00:31:02,930
[SPEAKER_04]: So soon, I'll have the details in the VOG Minecraft forum.

399
00:31:03,151 --> 00:31:05,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Slidekick, are you a Minecraft player?

400
00:31:05,172 --> 00:31:05,892
[SPEAKER_06]: You ever tried that out?

401
00:31:06,357 --> 00:31:09,439
[SPEAKER_06]: I've actually never played Minecraft before, so I probably should.

402
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,061
[SPEAKER_06]: It's different.

403
00:31:12,281 --> 00:31:16,444
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a game, but it's more like Legos on the computer.

404
00:31:17,405 --> 00:31:18,106
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hard to explain.

405
00:31:18,446 --> 00:31:19,326
[SPEAKER_06]: I've watched people play it.

406
00:31:19,907 --> 00:31:20,327
[SPEAKER_07]: It's clever.

407
00:31:20,367 --> 00:31:23,970
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just never really been a high priority for me, but I should check it out.

408
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:25,411
[SPEAKER_07]: Give it a chance.

409
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:26,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Good times.

410
00:31:26,812 --> 00:31:30,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, if that's it for Loki's Gaming Week, then I will move into my Gaming Week real quick.

411
00:31:30,394 --> 00:31:31,395
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't have a lot to play.

412
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:35,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, I OD'd on Final Fantasy XIV this weekend during the beta.

413
00:31:35,157 --> 00:31:37,359
[SPEAKER_06]: I played damn near nonstop.

414
00:31:37,819 --> 00:31:45,584
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I had a couple other things to do here locally, but when I wasn't out and about, I was trying to stay out of the heat and I was playing the crap out of Final Fantasy XIV beta.

415
00:31:45,624 --> 00:31:54,951
[SPEAKER_06]: For those that would understand that they've been playing the beta too, my Thaumaturge is level 16 and then my main... I started with Thaumaturge and I switched to Conjure.

416
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:56,811
[SPEAKER_06]: And my Conjurer is now 17.

417
00:31:57,872 --> 00:31:59,493
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've got both those jobs going.

418
00:31:59,553 --> 00:32:03,434
[SPEAKER_04]: So is Conjurer like the 14 version of a Summoner now?

419
00:32:03,794 --> 00:32:06,095
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's going to be Arcanist, which isn't in the beta yet.

420
00:32:06,195 --> 00:32:07,596
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's still stuff to add.

421
00:32:07,636 --> 00:32:12,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Arcanist will lead to Summoner and Scholar eventually.

422
00:32:13,238 --> 00:32:15,559
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Conjurer leads to Black Mage.

423
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Or no, excuse me.

424
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:16,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoop!

425
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:46,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Thaumaturge leads to Black Mage Conjurer leads to White Mage but like you don't ever get stuck with just one job it's kind of more the final it's not like 11 system of sub jobs it's Final Fantasy 5 more system where you choose traits like because my Thaumaturge is level 16 when I play a Conjurer I can have Thunder and Surecast from my Thaumaturge in my bar so that's kind of like and like if I were to play a Gladiator or something I could actually get like maybe weapon skills if they're usable if they're compatible with my class but

426
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,300
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

427
00:33:10,509 --> 00:33:19,076
[SPEAKER_06]: In many ways, some of the combat I realized when I was healing a dungeon the other night, I'm like, you know, this game doesn't really have the complexity of World of Warcraft.

428
00:33:19,316 --> 00:33:23,379
[SPEAKER_06]: All I'm doing is Cure, Cure, Cure, and occasionally I'm doing Medica, which is the group Cure.

429
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:29,064
[SPEAKER_06]: And sometimes I'll get to nuke the mob, but I don't have the diversity that I have in World of Warcraft spells.

430
00:33:29,504 --> 00:33:31,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Now granted, World of Warcraft wasn't always like that.

431
00:33:31,525 --> 00:33:33,307
[SPEAKER_06]: World of Warcraft's five expansions in right now.

432
00:33:33,647 --> 00:33:42,551
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's going to take time for Final Fantasy XIV to build up to that, and I see the potential there, but I love that the combat is so fast-paced, but it's Final Fantasy.

433
00:33:42,631 --> 00:33:54,137
[SPEAKER_04]: I also like how the combat, well, you can kind of utilize your terrain as well, because now that you can jump and stuff, you can actually, you know, okay, I'm going to...

434
00:33:54,617 --> 00:34:02,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Hop up on here and, you know, shoot stuff from, you know, cast spells from up on top of here and the monster can't really get around to me.

435
00:34:02,301 --> 00:34:12,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, like, I found with, like, it doesn't work all the time with goblins and stuff, but when they do the bomb toss or whatever, it'll show where the bomb's going to be and you can run around behind them and you don't take any damage, which is pretty sweet.

436
00:34:13,467 --> 00:34:14,447
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually liked that, too.

437
00:34:14,507 --> 00:34:21,791
[SPEAKER_11]: Like, that one duty I was having a problem with, I ended up just sprinting and kiting him the whole time, but it was really neat.

438
00:34:21,811 --> 00:34:23,392
[SPEAKER_11]: It actually worked a lot better than it did in WoW.

439
00:34:24,366 --> 00:34:25,807
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

440
00:34:54,964 --> 00:34:56,625
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just... Everything is there.

441
00:34:56,745 --> 00:35:02,687
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought I was going to have to get a new system, but there has been such a jump in performance from the last beta to this beta.

442
00:35:02,747 --> 00:35:03,468
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, oh my god.

443
00:35:03,828 --> 00:35:06,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, this game looks great on my not-so-great computer.

444
00:35:06,449 --> 00:35:07,289
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so thrilled.

445
00:35:07,349 --> 00:35:09,330
[SPEAKER_11]: It really sets it to optimize to what you have.

446
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,310
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

447
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:13,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Been loving Final Fantasy XIV.

448
00:35:13,552 --> 00:35:15,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, one of the other fanservice-y things I have to talk about.

449
00:35:15,692 --> 00:35:18,994
[SPEAKER_06]: The last boss in Tamtara Deepcroft, which is one of the instances...

450
00:35:19,674 --> 00:35:37,639
[SPEAKER_06]: it's a it's a mage with a tentacle face and I didn't catch it at first but Alan looks over and goes dude that's one of the mage mobs from Final Fantasy 1 and I'm like oh my god it is like there's just all these little like subtle fan service things they change something by the way um when you start off in Gridania did you remake a character there

451
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:40,231
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't think so.

452
00:35:40,331 --> 00:35:42,935
[SPEAKER_11]: Your intro is different now from how it was in the last one.

453
00:35:42,955 --> 00:35:43,736
[SPEAKER_11]: You have moogles.

454
00:35:44,336 --> 00:35:46,239
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I started an olda this time.

455
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,944
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I went ahead and made another conjurer because I wanted to see if they had a new quest.

456
00:35:50,845 --> 00:35:53,609
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's moogles.

457
00:35:54,129 --> 00:35:54,930
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's really funny.

458
00:35:55,251 --> 00:35:55,671
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cute.

459
00:35:56,832 --> 00:36:00,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Techness in chat says, Oh, and where's the VOG link shell for Final Fantasy 14?

460
00:36:01,255 --> 00:36:03,496
[SPEAKER_06]: I accidentally rolled on one of the JP realms.

461
00:36:04,156 --> 00:36:10,099
[SPEAKER_06]: My assumption is that Horde House being the online gaming show will kind of pick up the VOG link shell thing and create.

462
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now we're on Behemoth, but that's subject to change for Beta 4.

463
00:36:14,782 --> 00:36:15,622
[SPEAKER_06]: We will let you know.

464
00:36:15,662 --> 00:36:16,783
[SPEAKER_10]: Behemoth is busier.

465
00:36:16,943 --> 00:36:17,424
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

466
00:36:32,344 --> 00:36:34,065
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's lower, then that's even better.

467
00:36:34,085 --> 00:36:37,648
[SPEAKER_11]: But I had the impression it was going to be the $14.95 thing.

468
00:36:37,848 --> 00:36:42,511
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm assuming somebody in chat will yell it out, or if Shane Alinko is listening, he'll join shortly and yell it.

469
00:36:42,571 --> 00:36:43,772
[SPEAKER_04]: See, the thing is, I don't know.

470
00:36:43,892 --> 00:36:48,215
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate paying for an MMO month-to-month because I want to play so much other stuff.

471
00:36:48,495 --> 00:36:52,078
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel locked into having to play that to kind of get my money's worth each month.

472
00:36:52,638 --> 00:37:13,930
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's the thing it's like that's why I quit Final Fantasy XI because I just wasn't playing it enough and I kind of afraid to get into something like that's why free to play or you buy the game and you can play whenever you know works well for me it's just I like the game I like it a lot better it seems to be a lot easier to level up and stuff than XI which is nice but

473
00:37:15,322 --> 00:37:15,702
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

474
00:37:16,422 --> 00:37:17,743
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so anyway, Final Fantasy XIV.

475
00:37:17,783 --> 00:37:24,506
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the other game I've played a lot of this week, Marvel Heroes, the free-to-play MMO, although it's a little more like Diablo.

476
00:37:24,746 --> 00:37:25,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Free my ass.

477
00:37:26,006 --> 00:37:28,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, it's got little transactions up the wazoo.

478
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:30,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Little?

479
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:32,949
[SPEAKER_06]: I started a storm, of course, because I love storm.

480
00:37:33,229 --> 00:37:39,571
[SPEAKER_06]: So I started playing a storm, and then after I beat the first boss, I got the Scarlet Witch token, so I can play a Scarlet Witch now, too.

481
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:40,112
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of cool.

482
00:37:40,152 --> 00:37:40,932
[SPEAKER_11]: That's who I started with.

483
00:37:41,112 --> 00:37:44,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so apparently all the characters will drop in the game.

484
00:37:44,413 --> 00:37:45,714
[SPEAKER_06]: It just might take forever.

485
00:37:46,354 --> 00:38:01,141
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'll give a cheap plug to this week's Horde House because we had Mihail on this week and he talked about Marvel Heroes and a lot of League of Legends, which I patched this week so I could play with Mihail later this week when Final Fantasy XIV is not running.

486
00:38:02,181 --> 00:38:02,621
[SPEAKER_04]: HordeHouse.com.

487
00:38:02,701 --> 00:38:03,602
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not running this week?

488
00:38:04,909 --> 00:38:05,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Only on the weekends, right?

489
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:10,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Final Fantasy XIV is only running on the weekends, but the rumor is there's going to be a longer stress test before Beta 4.

490
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:11,481
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see.

491
00:38:12,495 --> 00:38:37,670
[SPEAKER_07]: anyhow uh slide kick first mate slide kick what have you been playing this week what's a week of gaming look like to you it's pretty much been all animal crossing uh you know it's funny because i picked it up actually at the nintendo experience because you know they had a display sitting out so i was like oh i probably should get it and for the first couple of days i only played a little bit but lately i've just been playing for like hours at a time and i'm like oh i've got to sleep now

492
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:39,511
[SPEAKER_06]: I also played the shit out of Animal Crossing.

493
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:42,132
[SPEAKER_06]: That one night we were doing the Google Hangout with everybody.

494
00:38:42,392 --> 00:38:42,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Good times.

495
00:38:43,012 --> 00:38:43,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

496
00:38:43,912 --> 00:38:47,654
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just built the upstairs to my house.

497
00:38:48,074 --> 00:38:50,615
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been going to the island a lot, catching bugs.

498
00:38:51,755 --> 00:39:00,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I got Reggie's house in my spot pass in the Happy Home model homes gallery.

499
00:39:00,458 --> 00:39:02,679
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've been buying a lot of stuff out of Reggie's house.

500
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,181
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you look in his little profile card, it says my body is ready.

501
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:06,441
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

502
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:10,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you know it was an intern that did it, people.

503
00:39:10,242 --> 00:39:11,842
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not Reggie's actual house.

504
00:39:11,862 --> 00:39:12,962
[SPEAKER_06]: An intern did it for him.

505
00:39:13,582 --> 00:39:22,644
[SPEAKER_04]: I did notice in some of the screenshots or whatever they were showing of the game that they have a lot of cool niche Japanese arcade stuff you can get.

506
00:39:22,684 --> 00:39:32,867
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if they have a Japanese arcade set, but they have a candy cab, a claw machine, some actual table cabinets and stuff like that.

507
00:39:33,047 --> 00:39:33,847
[SPEAKER_04]: They look pretty sweet.

508
00:39:34,427 --> 00:39:37,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Not sweet enough for me to buy a 3DS for the game, but sweet enough.

509
00:39:37,548 --> 00:39:39,228
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a claw machine in my Animal Crossing house.

510
00:39:39,248 --> 00:39:39,689
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awesome.

511
00:39:39,929 --> 00:39:44,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know what I loved in your town was the animal that had the chocolate fondue fountain.

512
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:44,970
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I want.

513
00:39:48,331 --> 00:39:49,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Who doesn't want a chocolate fondue fountain?

514
00:39:50,031 --> 00:39:50,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's be real.

515
00:39:50,712 --> 00:39:50,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

516
00:39:50,952 --> 00:39:51,612
[SPEAKER_06]: And some McCroons.

517
00:39:51,812 --> 00:39:52,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.

518
00:39:52,252 --> 00:39:52,672
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

519
00:39:53,072 --> 00:39:53,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh?

520
00:39:53,632 --> 00:39:56,433
[SPEAKER_11]: First thing that I bought wasn't making a down payment on my house.

521
00:39:56,573 --> 00:39:57,193
[SPEAKER_11]: I bought a phone booth.

522
00:39:57,814 --> 00:39:59,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that the thing that looks like a TARDIS but red?

523
00:39:59,716 --> 00:40:01,737
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the current British style phone booth.

524
00:40:01,797 --> 00:40:02,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

525
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:02,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

526
00:40:02,718 --> 00:40:05,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Like one of those was for sale in my town the night of the Google Hangout.

527
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,501
[SPEAKER_06]: And Spike was like, open your gates right now.

528
00:40:08,521 --> 00:40:09,081
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm coming to town.

529
00:40:09,362 --> 00:40:13,384
[SPEAKER_06]: And that just started this whole like wave of Animal Crossing fuckery.

530
00:40:13,564 --> 00:40:14,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

531
00:40:14,425 --> 00:40:17,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Except then he didn't take my virtual boy that I was saving for him.

532
00:40:17,246 --> 00:40:18,807
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a virtual boy fanatic.

533
00:40:19,868 --> 00:40:21,389
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll have to get it to him.

534
00:40:21,429 --> 00:40:22,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Now you're no longer friends.

535
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:27,372
[SPEAKER_11]: If they put in like virtual boy games, it would totally work with the lenticular game.

536
00:40:28,573 --> 00:40:30,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, as like a 3DS Virtual Console thing?

537
00:40:30,814 --> 00:40:31,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

538
00:40:31,475 --> 00:40:36,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I don't even know about like Virtual Boy emulation, if that's actually a thing.

539
00:40:36,538 --> 00:40:38,579
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought there were early rumors it was going to happen.

540
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:44,663
[SPEAKER_04]: They just need to make Animal Crossing like the Nintendo version of PlayStation Home.

541
00:40:45,864 --> 00:40:46,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Done.

542
00:40:46,344 --> 00:40:48,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, rumors are it's going to go free to play at some point.

543
00:40:48,665 --> 00:40:49,666
[SPEAKER_06]: System seller right there.

544
00:40:49,806 --> 00:40:50,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Makes sense.

545
00:40:51,027 --> 00:40:51,367
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

546
00:40:51,947 --> 00:40:52,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything else?

547
00:40:52,588 --> 00:40:52,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Slide kick.

548
00:40:53,308 --> 00:40:55,871
[SPEAKER_07]: No, actually just Animal Crossing this week.

549
00:40:55,891 --> 00:40:59,594
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been meaning to get around to some other stuff, but I'm actually in the process of moving.

550
00:40:59,715 --> 00:41:02,557
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've been kind of trying to pack up my console games.

551
00:41:02,617 --> 00:41:04,359
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm like, oh, my 3DS is right here.

552
00:41:04,459 --> 00:41:08,844
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why I've kind of been focusing on 3DS for the most part.

553
00:41:09,364 --> 00:41:13,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Not to give out your home address for all the stalkers, but you're moving to Daily City, right?

554
00:41:13,167 --> 00:41:15,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, which is Alan's old digs, kind of.

555
00:41:15,648 --> 00:41:18,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, just Alan's old digs and just a quick part right away from the city.

556
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:19,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

557
00:41:19,151 --> 00:41:20,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you're having fun.

558
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:20,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

559
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:21,432
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

560
00:41:22,893 --> 00:41:25,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Good thing you missed this weekend because I hear it was crazy.

561
00:41:26,907 --> 00:41:28,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, with all the festivities.

562
00:41:28,608 --> 00:41:30,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, lots of extra festivities.

563
00:41:31,309 --> 00:41:33,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of stuff in the news to be festive about.

564
00:41:34,051 --> 00:41:35,531
[SPEAKER_06]: But we are going to move into gaming news.

565
00:41:35,871 --> 00:41:37,712
[SPEAKER_06]: But first, I want to go over some housekeeping.

566
00:41:38,132 --> 00:41:43,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, I always like to plug our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, and Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

567
00:41:44,135 --> 00:41:45,756
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was going to plug this during housekeeping.

568
00:41:45,796 --> 00:41:47,897
[SPEAKER_06]: We already mentioned it at the top of the show, but I'll plug it again.

569
00:41:48,477 --> 00:41:50,698
[SPEAKER_06]: GamerX, catch me.

570
00:41:50,818 --> 00:41:53,300
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be there live August 4th.

571
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

572
00:42:10,775 --> 00:42:25,242
[SPEAKER_06]: You get there and you just look for Podcast Cross Zone and you're going to go to it because it has the word podcast in it and that's where you're going to see me and Slag Kick and all the kids from Koopa Club and Spike and Game Bar and it's going to be fun.

573
00:42:25,722 --> 00:42:26,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Come up and say hello.

574
00:42:26,242 --> 00:42:27,163
[SPEAKER_06]: It will be great times.

575
00:42:27,443 --> 00:42:34,666
[SPEAKER_06]: And earlier today before the show, I was talking about cosplay because I think there is a costume I can pull off that's tasteful.

576
00:42:34,786 --> 00:42:35,907
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to pull off your costume?

577
00:42:36,227 --> 00:42:38,068
[SPEAKER_06]: No, this is tasteful, Slag Kick.

578
00:42:38,368 --> 00:42:42,270
[SPEAKER_11]: He's going to do the gladiator armor from Final Fantasy XIV.

579
00:42:43,451 --> 00:42:44,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

580
00:42:44,512 --> 00:42:46,132
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to wear the, what is it?

581
00:42:46,152 --> 00:42:47,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Subligar, the panties.

582
00:42:47,453 --> 00:42:48,274
[SPEAKER_06]: The leather mantis.

583
00:42:48,334 --> 00:42:48,654
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

584
00:42:48,954 --> 00:42:50,995
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd probably be very popular if you wore that.

585
00:42:51,055 --> 00:42:51,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, right.

586
00:42:51,676 --> 00:42:52,616
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.

587
00:42:52,656 --> 00:42:56,238
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll be like, okay, that guy does not have the body to wear something like that.

588
00:42:56,338 --> 00:42:57,539
[SPEAKER_06]: So, all right.

589
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,441
[SPEAKER_06]: So I will wear something that will keep me covered.

590
00:43:00,481 --> 00:43:00,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

591
00:43:01,341 --> 00:43:04,883
[SPEAKER_06]: I just turned 35, you know, so I don't need to be showing all my wrinkles.

592
00:43:05,043 --> 00:43:05,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Such a press.

593
00:43:06,024 --> 00:43:06,224
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

594
00:43:06,824 --> 00:43:12,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anyhow, let's for real get into some of the gaming news this week.

595
00:43:13,053 --> 00:43:19,242
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the gaming news that may not be on your radar, or it's pinging huge on your radar, one or the other, right?

596
00:43:19,403 --> 00:43:19,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Slidekick?

597
00:43:19,923 --> 00:43:20,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

598
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:21,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, start us off, Loki.

599
00:43:22,307 --> 00:43:32,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so Index Corporation, the, I think, pretty recent parent company of Atlas, they are having some problems.

600
00:43:32,178 --> 00:43:41,609
[SPEAKER_04]: They are basically filing for civil rehabilitation and maybe selling off assets, I'm assuming.

601
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:44,312
[SPEAKER_04]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

602
00:44:03,268 --> 00:44:12,433
[SPEAKER_04]: and they also have some other titles that they're publishing including the movie tie-in for RIPD and I guess Daylight.

603
00:44:12,993 --> 00:44:13,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, Daylight.

604
00:44:13,774 --> 00:44:15,955
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even remember what Daylight is.

605
00:44:15,995 --> 00:44:18,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Daylight is the survival horror.

606
00:44:18,997 --> 00:44:27,541
[SPEAKER_07]: You're thrown in a haunted house, I think, with only a flashlight and the PlayStation Eye records your scares so that your friends can laugh at you.

607
00:44:28,502 --> 00:44:29,042
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of funny.

608
00:44:30,443 --> 00:44:31,043
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, so

609
00:44:32,631 --> 00:44:32,951
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

610
00:44:33,051 --> 00:44:35,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they're not in too much trouble.

611
00:44:35,794 --> 00:44:42,480
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to say with Atlas because Atlas, they kind of deal with a lot of niche properties, so money seems to be very tight.

612
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:50,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Very small production runs, very small everything, budget, so it's hard to say if

613
00:44:50,467 --> 00:44:55,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I've seen a lot of people worried about them, but I mean, Atlus is well-loved enough that they'll find a home.

614
00:44:55,692 --> 00:45:02,658
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people think that Sony or Nintendo would snap them up, but I wouldn't be surprised if, like, GungHo or somebody snapped them up.

615
00:45:02,678 --> 00:45:07,142
[SPEAKER_06]: I would think, like, Marvelous... And a lot of people are afraid that EA might snap them up.

616
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:11,366
[SPEAKER_04]: I would think it would be more like Marvelous or...

617
00:45:13,508 --> 00:45:13,889
[SPEAKER_04]: What else?

618
00:45:15,731 --> 00:45:17,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Axis, I don't think it's too big to do that.

619
00:45:18,053 --> 00:45:24,501
[SPEAKER_04]: But those are kind of the three companies that bring over localized Japanese product nowadays.

620
00:45:26,943 --> 00:45:28,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

621
00:45:46,476 --> 00:45:47,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't think they're big enough.

622
00:45:47,697 --> 00:45:51,300
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, XSEED's, I think, quite small compared to Atlas.

623
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:53,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Atlas was kind of growing quite a bit.

624
00:45:53,922 --> 00:45:57,885
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought they were going to be branching out more into, like, Western development stuff as well.

625
00:45:57,905 --> 00:46:02,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they tried, you know, with, like, Game of Thrones and they have a few Sherlock Holmes games and stuff.

626
00:46:03,549 --> 00:46:05,570
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's just nothing's really taken off.

627
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:07,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is too bad, because Game of Thrones could have been good.

628
00:46:08,212 --> 00:46:08,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

629
00:46:08,592 --> 00:46:09,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Except it was a really bad game.

630
00:46:09,873 --> 00:46:12,774
[SPEAKER_06]: That PlayStation 3 game you're talking about, the horror game, sounds really good.

631
00:46:13,954 --> 00:46:14,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds interesting.

632
00:46:14,894 --> 00:46:16,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Better than what they have.

633
00:46:16,794 --> 00:46:20,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Sony had a PlayStation Move game, although I don't know if it's Move anymore.

634
00:46:21,955 --> 00:46:22,335
[SPEAKER_04]: What was it?

635
00:46:22,656 --> 00:46:28,337
[SPEAKER_04]: That one was supposed to be a teen horror genre type game.

636
00:46:28,417 --> 00:46:29,777
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really know how that was going to work.

637
00:46:30,197 --> 00:46:33,818
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even remember the title of it now.

638
00:46:34,118 --> 00:46:35,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it was that memorable.

639
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:40,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Shadow Next Gen in our chat at live.vognetwork.com says, what if Microsoft bought Atlas?

640
00:46:40,521 --> 00:46:43,002
[SPEAKER_06]: They would have a lot of Japanese content on their platform then.

641
00:46:44,962 --> 00:46:49,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that won't do them any good since they're not putting out the Xbox One in Japan at launch.

642
00:46:49,784 --> 00:46:54,025
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be an interesting strategical move, but I think for Microsoft also a risky one.

643
00:46:54,525 --> 00:46:54,965
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

644
00:46:56,434 --> 00:46:57,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

645
00:46:58,116 --> 00:47:03,882
[SPEAKER_07]: I've heard a couple people say that could be a thing, but I don't think Microsoft really would do it.

646
00:47:04,282 --> 00:47:07,766
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a lot of Nintendo fanboys would just eat it up if Nintendo would do it, though.

647
00:47:08,286 --> 00:47:10,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

648
00:47:10,409 --> 00:47:13,612
[SPEAKER_06]: That kind of only exists in fanboy imagination, I think, but you never know.

649
00:47:14,853 --> 00:47:14,953
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

650
00:47:15,854 --> 00:47:19,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well let's move on to another story, and this is about Saints Row 4.

651
00:47:19,737 --> 00:47:21,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Loki's looking forward to this one.

652
00:47:21,918 --> 00:47:25,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's a good thing Loki doesn't live in Australia, or he might be waiting a little bit longer.

653
00:47:25,101 --> 00:47:27,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, please, like an Australian, stop me from getting this.

654
00:47:27,622 --> 00:47:31,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, right, and I'm sure there's a lot of people in Australia that are saying the same thing.

655
00:47:31,345 --> 00:47:41,132
[SPEAKER_06]: However, Saints Row 4 is now the first game to be refused classification in the country since Australia released their R18 plus rating at the start of the year.

656
00:47:41,172 --> 00:47:42,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Which doesn't make any sense to me.

657
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:44,694
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how they're going to do that, but good luck.

658
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:15,914
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be a mod immediately after it comes out that'll put it all right back.

659
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:17,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially on PC.

660
00:48:18,276 --> 00:48:18,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

661
00:48:19,658 --> 00:48:24,503
[SPEAKER_06]: How cute that Australia thinks it could regulate some of that because on the internet this stuff will just come over instantly.

662
00:48:24,603 --> 00:48:25,764
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't understand.

663
00:48:26,344 --> 00:48:27,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Just encourages piracy too.

664
00:48:28,086 --> 00:48:33,892
[SPEAKER_04]: But did you hear the reason why it got... I didn't hear the specific reason why, no.

665
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:34,432
[SPEAKER_04]: What was it?

666
00:48:34,572 --> 00:48:35,613
[SPEAKER_04]: They have an anal probe.

667
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:38,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no.

668
00:48:38,795 --> 00:48:41,076
[SPEAKER_07]: See, I was wondering where they would take the dildo vat next.

669
00:48:41,156 --> 00:48:41,696
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.

670
00:48:41,716 --> 00:48:44,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they have a... Does it have a big satellite?

671
00:48:44,357 --> 00:48:52,260
[SPEAKER_04]: It basically looks like a giant dildo with a sword hilt or something on it, and you can shove it up the ass of your enemies.

672
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:55,001
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, this makes me want to buy the game even more.

673
00:48:55,561 --> 00:48:56,322
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait.

674
00:48:57,302 --> 00:49:00,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I gotta find... Yeah, you just finished talking there.

675
00:49:00,884 --> 00:49:05,947
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna find the exact description was hilarious.

676
00:49:08,069 --> 00:49:10,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't an episode of South Park have the anal probe, though?

677
00:49:11,051 --> 00:49:12,852
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, wasn't that the first episode?

678
00:49:12,872 --> 00:49:13,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Cartman gets an anal probe?

679
00:49:13,732 --> 00:49:14,213
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was.

680
00:49:14,473 --> 00:49:21,017
[SPEAKER_11]: The moment he said anal probe, like, the whole, I like to sing about the moon and the trees popped into my head in that episode.

681
00:49:21,536 --> 00:49:25,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, also, I guess games are getting hit left and right in Australia now.

682
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:31,023
[SPEAKER_06]: State of Decay is another game that's been refused classification in Australia.

683
00:49:31,743 --> 00:49:34,926
[SPEAKER_06]: This was just not even that long after word of Saints Row 4 happened.

684
00:49:35,926 --> 00:49:40,590
[SPEAKER_06]: So this was Microsoft is evaluating the options with regards to the title's classification.

685
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:47,615
[SPEAKER_06]: The Australian classification system plays an important role in ensuring that Australians can only access age-appropriate games and content.

686
00:49:48,175 --> 00:49:50,317
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was one day after Saints Row 4.

687
00:49:53,007 --> 00:49:57,470
[SPEAKER_06]: The game includes a weapon referred to the applicant as an alien anal probe.

688
00:49:57,490 --> 00:50:00,452
[SPEAKER_06]: The applicant states that this weapon can be shoved into enemies' backsides.

689
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:14,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Sold!

690
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,181
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not a probe.

691
00:50:16,201 --> 00:50:17,261
[SPEAKER_04]: That's more like a bottle rocket.

692
00:50:17,281 --> 00:50:18,102
[SPEAKER_04]: You're such a teenager.

693
00:50:18,122 --> 00:50:19,202
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an ass-launcher.

694
00:50:44,013 --> 00:51:02,747
[SPEAKER_04]: an ass launcher ass launcher ass master apparently after the probe has been inserted into the victim's anus the area around the buttocks becomes pixelated highlighting that the aim of the weapon is to penetrate the victim's anus the weapon can be used during gameplay to enemy characters and civilians so the weapon

695
00:51:03,607 --> 00:51:26,862
[SPEAKER_04]: as long as they don't leave a blood trail that would just be wrong and also alien narcotics was the other reason why I guess smoking alien narcotics equips the players with superpowers awesome do they actually get superpowers or do they just think they have superpowers who cares alrighty then let's move on with something else I don't want to be on this planet anymore

696
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:31,889
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, well, a lot of people are not happy with Microsoft.

697
00:51:31,989 --> 00:51:37,093
[SPEAKER_11]: And among the people who are unhappy with Microsoft is the creator of Fez, Phil Fish.

698
00:51:38,354 --> 00:51:41,036
[SPEAKER_11]: Try saying Fez and Phil Fish together three times fast.

699
00:51:41,076 --> 00:51:42,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Fez, Phil Fish, Phil Fish, Phil Fish.

700
00:51:42,657 --> 00:51:43,037
[SPEAKER_07]: See?

701
00:51:43,418 --> 00:51:45,119
[SPEAKER_11]: You lose.

702
00:51:45,539 --> 00:51:52,304
[SPEAKER_11]: But basically he's saying that Microsoft was doing nothing to help sell his game on Xbox Live Arcade.

703
00:51:53,405 --> 00:51:54,566
[SPEAKER_11]: He complained about it on Twitter.

704
00:51:54,586 --> 00:51:58,207
[SPEAKER_11]: He said Microsoft was our publisher on the Xbox 360 and they did nothing.

705
00:51:58,247 --> 00:52:00,748
[SPEAKER_11]: No promotion, no festivals, not a single mention.

706
00:52:03,029 --> 00:52:08,231
[SPEAKER_11]: In a newsletter or conference, they put us up on their shitty dashboard and somehow fucked that up too.

707
00:52:09,092 --> 00:52:12,733
[SPEAKER_11]: They put us up on the game marketplace with no cover image.

708
00:52:12,773 --> 00:52:14,254
[SPEAKER_11]: The file was missing for a week.

709
00:52:15,797 --> 00:52:24,130
[SPEAKER_11]: So basically, he's also saying that Microsoft has stopped charging developers $10,000 for patches and updates.

710
00:52:25,612 --> 00:52:29,999
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's a lot of crap going on between...

711
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:46,376
[SPEAKER_11]: with misinformation going from Microsoft not telling them about corruption within the file system or anything like that so basically they're like oh we don't really care indie developer we just want you to put your game up there we're not going to promote it just put it there we're not going to put any money behind you

712
00:52:47,206 --> 00:52:50,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft in chat says, Phil Fish, I hate the guy, but he's right in this one.

713
00:52:52,029 --> 00:52:59,334
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, yeah, because Microsoft doesn't let people self-publish to the... I mean, they have XNA for self-publishing, although they're not going to be supporting that anymore.

714
00:52:59,934 --> 00:53:05,998
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is part of why people are mad, because you can publish under Microsoft, but then, you know, there's all these other complaints.

715
00:53:06,018 --> 00:53:10,401
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, yeah, and Microsoft was charging $10,000 for them to put in a fix in corrupted files.

716
00:53:10,501 --> 00:53:13,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Fez really got screwed by all that business.

717
00:53:14,156 --> 00:53:32,539
[SPEAKER_11]: and on top of that Microsoft did confirm that they automatically charged developers for resubmissions of games was scrapped in April is what they're saying but they never told any of the developers about that they said that the new policy was retroactive but they never said anything

718
00:53:33,288 --> 00:53:34,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, didn't you have more information on that, Loki?

719
00:53:35,169 --> 00:53:36,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope, I had exactly that information.

720
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:42,074
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, on top of that, you know, Phil Fish is still pissed off about the whole thing.

721
00:53:42,334 --> 00:53:49,679
[SPEAKER_04]: See, this is kind of funny, I think, because he was complaining that, oh, well, you know, I don't know if he had a patch or something.

722
00:53:49,799 --> 00:53:54,522
[SPEAKER_04]: First, he put out a patch for the game, and it fucked up the game even more than without the patch.

723
00:53:55,083 --> 00:53:59,866
[SPEAKER_04]: And so then they pulled the patch, I guess, and he couldn't resubmit the patch or something.

724
00:54:00,446 --> 00:54:03,168
[SPEAKER_04]: But now that it's free, why isn't he resubmitting the patch?

725
00:54:04,969 --> 00:54:07,189
[SPEAKER_10]: Perhaps by this point it's just done with the fuckery.

726
00:54:07,409 --> 00:54:14,872
[SPEAKER_04]: But if he had it done already, if he had that fixed patch done already, I'm assuming he still has the data, why can't he just resubmit it instead of being a complete douche?

727
00:54:16,252 --> 00:54:21,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I know, because he wants to sell Feds 2, which will be coming out to platforms other than Xbox One.

728
00:54:21,414 --> 00:54:25,095
[SPEAKER_11]: Unless it's seriously trying to distance himself from Microsoft.

729
00:54:25,515 --> 00:54:30,457
[SPEAKER_11]: Which I can see that, trying just to remove any association between your product to Microsoft...

730
00:54:31,129 --> 00:54:36,819
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you keep in mind the bottom line of development is money.

731
00:54:38,582 --> 00:54:43,671
[SPEAKER_11]: If he's trying to market a next game, it's a smart move to separate it from where it's already been screwed over.

732
00:54:44,465 --> 00:54:47,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Shadow Next Gen in our chat says Sony was charging for updates too, I believe.

733
00:54:47,869 --> 00:54:48,689
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't Microsoft specific.

734
00:54:48,709 --> 00:54:50,251
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if they were charging that much.

735
00:54:51,612 --> 00:54:59,380
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say I remember hearing something like that too because I remember it was a big deal when Wii U first came out is that's why indies were embracing it is because Nintendo wasn't charging.

736
00:54:59,881 --> 00:55:01,463
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was like a huge selling point.

737
00:55:01,763 --> 00:55:02,684
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

738
00:55:04,318 --> 00:55:07,420
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pretty sure Sony has to have gotten rid of that since, though.

739
00:55:07,861 --> 00:55:14,966
[SPEAKER_06]: They might have just done it a lot quieter than Microsoft did, because look at all those indies they lured to their E3 press conference.

740
00:55:17,268 --> 00:55:23,952
[SPEAKER_06]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, EARTH.

741
00:55:25,433 --> 00:55:31,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well speaking of Microsoft, a very interesting patent revealed out of Microsoft.

742
00:55:31,417 --> 00:55:32,938
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a patent filed back in December of 2011.

743
00:55:33,278 --> 00:55:39,022
[SPEAKER_06]: This would have been around the time Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary or the Halo remake came out.

744
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:45,666
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a patent for a video game that would, quote, have a plurality of game engines running concurrently.

745
00:55:46,006 --> 00:55:51,329
[SPEAKER_06]: And you might remember the Halo Anniversary game lets you go between updated visuals and original Xbox...

746
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:53,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Back and forth.

747
00:55:54,191 --> 00:56:06,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, this is what the patent was out there for, is that it was for remakes of games where you could have original graphics and, I thought this was interesting, leveraging player emotions tied to the original experience.

748
00:56:07,401 --> 00:56:13,165
[SPEAKER_06]: However, this may be lost as modern graphics may cause the gamers to lose that feeling of nostalgia.

749
00:56:13,625 --> 00:56:15,707
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was because of an emotional connection.

750
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:18,208
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I could see that.

751
00:56:18,528 --> 00:56:25,872
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a whole bunch of these games on Xbox Live Arcade when that first came out, like all the Konami remakes.

752
00:56:26,253 --> 00:56:27,293
[SPEAKER_06]: You could play like Gyruss.

753
00:56:27,313 --> 00:56:29,554
[SPEAKER_06]: You could play it with the original graphics or the HD graphics.

754
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:31,796
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to play with the original graphics.

755
00:56:31,816 --> 00:56:35,918
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't play with the new graphics because they're not that good and it's hard to see the bullets.

756
00:56:36,198 --> 00:56:37,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's a different thing.

757
00:56:37,219 --> 00:56:39,120
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not that you're nostalgic for the old graphics.

758
00:56:39,181 --> 00:56:41,202
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just the new ones are really lame.

759
00:56:41,302 --> 00:56:42,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe a little bit.

760
00:56:42,223 --> 00:56:43,724
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know.

761
00:56:44,024 --> 00:56:48,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like you're smoking some alien narcotics here because I don't see the point.

762
00:56:48,528 --> 00:56:50,810
[SPEAKER_11]: Weren't we having that discussion, though, about voice acting today?

763
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:52,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, a little bit, yeah.

764
00:56:52,291 --> 00:56:55,654
[SPEAKER_11]: With Metal Gear, how they updated the voice acting.

765
00:56:55,674 --> 00:57:01,018
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it was all the same people, but they didn't put the same cheesiness into it, I guess.

766
00:57:01,058 --> 00:57:02,459
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if it's sort of along the same lines.

767
00:57:02,813 --> 00:57:03,273
[SPEAKER_06]: SILENT HILL 3

768
00:57:19,338 --> 00:57:21,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Slidekick, are you emotionally tied to retro games?

769
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:28,264
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what this actually made me think of is when they put out the Star Wars DVDs that had the original video.

770
00:57:28,284 --> 00:57:33,087
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it might have been like a laser disc transfer or something because that's all they had that wasn't destroyed at that point.

771
00:57:33,407 --> 00:57:33,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Which one?

772
00:57:34,208 --> 00:57:36,389
[SPEAKER_07]: The original Star Wars trilogy.

773
00:57:36,429 --> 00:57:38,931
[SPEAKER_07]: They put out a DVD set that was like two discs.

774
00:57:39,611 --> 00:57:41,172
[SPEAKER_11]: Which I have that set.

775
00:57:41,413 --> 00:57:42,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, me too.

776
00:57:42,153 --> 00:57:44,375
[SPEAKER_11]: That were the theatrical releases.

777
00:57:44,835 --> 00:57:45,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

778
00:57:45,375 --> 00:57:47,897
[SPEAKER_11]: And those I think were redone off of film prints.

779
00:57:47,917 --> 00:57:47,977
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

780
00:57:48,687 --> 00:57:49,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, film prints, okay.

781
00:57:49,387 --> 00:57:51,608
[SPEAKER_06]: So like hand shot first on the Laserdisc?

782
00:57:53,688 --> 00:57:55,169
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a version of it.

783
00:57:55,289 --> 00:57:59,810
[SPEAKER_11]: I have the THX remasters on Laserdisc, where yes indeedy, he shot first.

784
00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:14,274
[SPEAKER_11]: We call them the non-fucked up remasters, because they actually had the whole THX sound, they did all the cleanup, they had the extra, you know where you see the X's flying in the air, instead of X-wings flying in the air?

785
00:58:14,294 --> 00:58:17,875
[SPEAKER_11]: They had all of the corrections made, but they didn't do any of the changes.

786
00:58:19,873 --> 00:58:38,486
[SPEAKER_06]: and I got it for 11 bucks that's a good point though that people are definitely tied to that emotionally because you bring up the new Star Wars with anybody is there anybody out there anybody that prefers Lucas's changes in the original trilogy anybody people with brain damage I mean I'm sorry don't offend you know what diversity DarkSakura

787
00:58:39,195 --> 00:58:39,715
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

788
00:58:40,076 --> 00:58:40,296
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

789
00:58:40,396 --> 00:58:41,137
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still wrong.

790
00:58:41,577 --> 00:58:45,740
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think people are that nostalgic for Xbox One graphics, to be honest.

791
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:56,409
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, and if they're redoing the game with, you know, I think it was like Halo 3 or Halo Reaches Engine, which is not bad and definitely the graphics look way better.

792
00:58:56,749 --> 00:59:02,454
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see the point of having to tax the system that much by running two copies of the game at the same time.

793
00:59:02,494 --> 00:59:04,776
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a little ridiculous because you either...

794
00:59:05,436 --> 00:59:06,537
[SPEAKER_04]: sell a copy of the game.

795
00:59:06,737 --> 00:59:13,963
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I wonder if they have the actual data of how many people actually play that game with the new graphics versus old graphics.

796
00:59:14,603 --> 00:59:22,349
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also a subset of that, how many people play the game with the new graphics and old graphics and use the Kinect to old graphics, new graphics, old graphics, new graphics.

797
00:59:22,409 --> 00:59:24,851
[SPEAKER_06]: The same people that sit there and yell grenade to throw a grenade.

798
00:59:24,871 --> 00:59:29,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade, grenade.

799
00:59:30,896 --> 00:59:34,118
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, HD remasters seem to be pretty popular, so I mean, I don't know why.

800
00:59:34,218 --> 00:59:35,659
[SPEAKER_06]: But some of them are so good.

801
00:59:35,699 --> 00:59:39,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I am so there for the Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy X. Oh, that was gorgeous.

802
00:59:39,822 --> 00:59:42,204
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm running up to the feeder bar, give me pellet, give me pellet.

803
00:59:42,244 --> 00:59:45,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, some of that, you know, I'm a sucker for some of it.

804
00:59:45,686 --> 00:59:49,369
[SPEAKER_04]: You know who I wouldn't want to go up against, you know, using the Kinect and the Halo thing?

805
00:59:49,569 --> 00:59:54,432
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy that used to do the Micro Machines commercials because, my God, he would fucking own online.

806
00:59:54,472 --> 00:59:56,814
[SPEAKER_10]: I think he should be relieved that he's dead.

807
00:59:57,174 --> 00:59:57,934
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter.

808
00:59:58,875 --> 01:00:00,176
[SPEAKER_10]: And John Machida.

809
01:00:00,489 --> 01:00:00,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

810
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:17,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Did any of you play Mega Man Powered Up for PSP?

811
01:00:18,733 --> 01:00:20,034
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the remake of Mega Man 1.

812
01:00:20,734 --> 01:00:21,214
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

813
01:00:21,294 --> 01:00:25,357
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't bad, but they replaced the original Mega Man 1 music.

814
01:00:25,377 --> 01:00:27,178
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awful.

815
01:00:27,318 --> 01:00:29,800
[SPEAKER_07]: One has good music, but it's not 2 or 3.

816
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:33,422
[SPEAKER_06]: The GameCube one, too, I think of.

817
01:00:34,183 --> 01:00:35,744
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it had the re-dunk.

818
01:00:36,064 --> 01:00:38,626
[SPEAKER_07]: They just had this cutesy music that I was like, I don't know.

819
01:00:38,646 --> 01:00:40,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it had the new music in it.

820
01:00:40,407 --> 01:00:41,368
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just too cutesy.

821
01:00:41,408 --> 01:00:43,909
[SPEAKER_07]: I can understand the nostalgia thing at times.

822
01:00:47,912 --> 01:00:50,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's move on with some more news.

823
01:00:50,493 --> 01:00:52,814
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura's got something for us and then we're going to get to release dates.

824
01:00:52,894 --> 01:00:55,316
[SPEAKER_11]: I was trying to find out when John Machida died.

825
01:00:55,616 --> 01:00:55,836
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh well.

826
01:00:56,696 --> 01:00:57,637
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a while ago.

827
01:00:57,717 --> 01:00:59,678
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate to say it, it was a while ago.

828
01:00:59,938 --> 01:01:03,060
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it was sometime while I was still in high school, maybe?

829
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:04,080
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

830
01:01:04,461 --> 01:01:11,467
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, there is some good news for people who were going to put some stock into the Xbox One.

831
01:01:12,208 --> 01:01:14,810
[SPEAKER_11]: They've actually improved the memory performance for the console.

832
01:01:15,851 --> 01:01:21,116
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, they... Let me see if I can't find exactly the amount.

833
01:01:22,177 --> 01:01:22,277
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

834
01:01:23,968 --> 01:01:38,598
[SPEAKER_11]: They've actually have now a 32 megabyte of embedded static RAM that's going to make up the difference in processing speed between what was previously announced for the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4.

835
01:01:39,659 --> 01:01:43,422
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't know if it's still going to be as good.

836
01:01:44,963 --> 01:01:50,807
[SPEAKER_11]: They're saying that right now that 192 gigabytes a second is theoretically possible.

837
01:01:52,483 --> 01:01:54,304
[SPEAKER_04]: 32 megabytes of RAM.

838
01:01:54,344 --> 01:01:58,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, that console must be worth thousands of dollars, said somebody in the 90s.

839
01:02:01,528 --> 01:02:08,372
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they're saying it's this embedded static RAM, which I think just means it's a new chip.

840
01:02:09,557 --> 01:02:17,139
[SPEAKER_07]: It just kind of sucks because launch games always are not going to look as good as games later in the console's lifespan.

841
01:02:17,399 --> 01:02:23,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially now that they're like, oh, right away we're shipping with more memory.

842
01:02:23,441 --> 01:02:28,463
[SPEAKER_07]: So the games that are prepared for launch probably won't be able to take advantage of that, and that kind of sucks.

843
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:41,682
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, they were saying right now that their original calculations, just as a base calculation, came up to 128 bytes per block multiplied by 800 megahertz.

844
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:47,624
[SPEAKER_11]: And that now that they've been able to reasonably get in their simulations 133 gigabytes a second, so...

845
01:02:49,164 --> 01:02:54,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, then I want no excuses if the Xbox One versions are inferior to the PlayStation 4 versions.

846
01:02:54,469 --> 01:02:55,390
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I'm just saying.

847
01:02:55,430 --> 01:02:58,673
[SPEAKER_11]: Now that you're not going to get your games online, we got more speed.

848
01:02:59,033 --> 01:02:59,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on a second there.

849
01:02:59,854 --> 01:03:01,536
[SPEAKER_04]: You said you added 32 megs of RAM.

850
01:03:02,597 --> 01:03:04,358
[SPEAKER_04]: This should be night and day difference, right?

851
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:05,239
[SPEAKER_11]: On my 486.

852
01:03:05,499 --> 01:03:05,680
[SPEAKER_11]: Ah.

853
01:03:07,601 --> 01:03:08,642
[SPEAKER_11]: Womp womp.

854
01:03:08,662 --> 01:03:09,143
[SPEAKER_11]: Womp womp.

855
01:03:10,725 --> 01:03:16,454
[SPEAKER_04]: I honestly think this is a bunch of just... It's a bullet point to report on and no one knows what the hell it means.

856
01:03:17,696 --> 01:03:21,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Why, if they're just going to add this RAM, why can't the developers just go back and turn up the graphics on level 3?

857
01:03:21,842 --> 01:03:24,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't they just take a big dial and turn up the graphics?

858
01:03:25,767 --> 01:03:32,993
[SPEAKER_11]: What they're basically saying this means is that for some of the games that they showed at E3 that kind of stuttered along, that it should improve performance dramatically.

859
01:03:33,033 --> 01:03:35,735
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I'm not sure what this 32 megabyte thing is going to do.

860
01:03:35,755 --> 01:03:41,059
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it has to be something involved with another calculation, like maybe a buffer or something.

861
01:03:41,099 --> 01:03:43,761
[SPEAKER_06]: It's to save more pictures of you masturbating.

862
01:03:44,002 --> 01:03:44,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

863
01:03:44,862 --> 01:03:45,783
[SPEAKER_06]: On its Kinect.

864
01:03:46,023 --> 01:03:47,444
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the fat box one.

865
01:03:48,906 --> 01:03:56,192
[SPEAKER_04]: The 32 megabytes is basically just to put it in its actual, so it runs off an actual console.

866
01:03:56,292 --> 01:03:58,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Tigerclaw in chat says, yeah, he's right.

867
01:03:58,493 --> 01:04:03,257
[SPEAKER_06]: The first crop of games won't take full advantage of the hardware until, whoa, what the hell?

868
01:04:03,337 --> 01:04:06,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Until, don't paste five lines at once when I'm trying to read.

869
01:04:07,381 --> 01:04:15,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Tigerclaw says, the first crop of games won't take full advantage of the hardware until like a year or so later when the developers finally figured out how to push the hardware to its limits.

870
01:04:15,768 --> 01:04:16,849
[SPEAKER_06]: But that happens with every console.

871
01:04:17,449 --> 01:04:21,816
[SPEAKER_07]: What was that Rome game?

872
01:04:22,337 --> 01:04:23,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Rise from York Wave.

873
01:04:24,621 --> 01:04:30,591
[SPEAKER_07]: They were saying that it looks choppy right now and that this might smooth out some frame rates or something, but we'll see.

874
01:04:32,808 --> 01:04:37,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, a fifth dream in that big post he put says the Micro Machines guy is not dead.

875
01:04:38,012 --> 01:04:38,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes!

876
01:04:39,233 --> 01:04:41,815
[SPEAKER_06]: But seriously though, if he was in that... I could have swore he was dead.

877
01:04:41,855 --> 01:04:42,996
[SPEAKER_06]: I swore he was dead too.

878
01:04:43,176 --> 01:04:45,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, I didn't like swear like, God, I hope he's dead.

879
01:04:45,238 --> 01:04:50,102
[SPEAKER_04]: He'd be dead within the first 15 seconds of that, you know, Eddie Murphy movie, One Thousand Words.

880
01:04:50,742 --> 01:04:54,205
[SPEAKER_11]: So... Well, maybe, maybe not.

881
01:04:54,225 --> 01:04:57,587
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking at the Wikipedia article and sure enough, Wiki says he ain't dead.

882
01:04:57,607 --> 01:04:57,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh.

883
01:04:57,828 --> 01:04:58,048
[SPEAKER_11]: Huh.

884
01:04:59,397 --> 01:04:59,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's good.

885
01:04:59,957 --> 01:05:01,618
[SPEAKER_11]: Then maybe I'm thinking of somebody else.

886
01:05:01,999 --> 01:05:03,860
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it was... What was his name?

887
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:05,421
[SPEAKER_11]: Chris Latta.

888
01:05:06,321 --> 01:05:06,902
[SPEAKER_11]: I was thinking of.

889
01:05:07,262 --> 01:05:09,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, he just needs to come back and do something.

890
01:05:09,123 --> 01:05:09,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything.

891
01:05:09,523 --> 01:05:09,883
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.

892
01:05:09,903 --> 01:05:11,204
[SPEAKER_04]: I need him talking in something.

893
01:05:11,804 --> 01:05:15,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Trailer, TV, movie, it doesn't matter.

894
01:05:16,605 --> 01:05:17,846
[SPEAKER_11]: I was thinking of Chris Latta.

895
01:05:18,306 --> 01:05:25,249
[SPEAKER_06]: At least that urban legend, I can understand someone falling for that because I could swear I've heard that that guy's dead too.

896
01:05:25,289 --> 01:05:28,930
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like you came on here and said the kid from The Wonder Years is Marilyn Manson.

897
01:05:29,431 --> 01:05:30,311
[SPEAKER_06]: People believe that?

898
01:05:31,031 --> 01:05:36,634
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it was Chris Latta that died in 1994 and he was the voice of Starscream in Cobra Commander.

899
01:05:37,434 --> 01:05:38,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

900
01:05:39,455 --> 01:05:41,956
[SPEAKER_11]: I have the stupid Transformers analogy in my head.

901
01:05:42,352 --> 01:05:48,995
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, look, we're getting way off track, so why don't we talk about some release dates, some video games that we could play this week and get our mind off of dead celebrities.

902
01:05:49,696 --> 01:05:52,557
[SPEAKER_04]: There is not a much coming out this week.

903
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:57,240
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically just one 3DS game, and it's Crash City Mayhem.

904
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:07,685
[SPEAKER_04]: The only reason I think it's kind of cool for the 3DS is it's based off a really old series called Runabout, which is on the Sega Dreamcast and PlayStation 1.

905
01:06:08,406 --> 01:06:16,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, you know, if you played it over here in the United States, it was Felony 179, a racing game where the whole point of the game was to crash in the shit.

906
01:06:16,450 --> 01:06:18,672
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was awesome and super glitchy.

907
01:06:19,212 --> 01:06:25,856
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember one time I took a full-size bus, a tour bus, and I tried to go through the train tunnel

908
01:06:26,656 --> 01:06:28,316
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know how I got it in the train tunnel.

909
01:06:28,577 --> 01:06:31,997
[SPEAKER_04]: And I tried to turn around like you know you do in the Austin Powers movie.

910
01:06:32,418 --> 01:06:38,599
[SPEAKER_04]: And it got stuck in there in such a way that it started spinning like a helicopter until it got enough speed where it shot straight up through the roof.

911
01:06:39,199 --> 01:06:39,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Hilarious.

912
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:40,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

913
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:40,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

914
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:41,380
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

915
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:42,340
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all that's coming out this week.

916
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:42,820
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

917
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:43,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's go over to Japan.

918
01:06:43,921 --> 01:06:48,442
[SPEAKER_06]: And on July 4th in Japan on the PlayStation 3, Loki's really excited.

919
01:06:48,482 --> 01:06:48,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

920
01:06:49,062 --> 01:06:51,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Earth Defense Forces 4 is out.

921
01:06:51,844 --> 01:06:53,906
[SPEAKER_06]: I may have to import that.

922
01:06:54,166 --> 01:06:55,467
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll cost you $71.49.

923
01:06:56,348 --> 01:06:58,610
[SPEAKER_06]: I may have to import that.

924
01:06:59,170 --> 01:07:05,295
[SPEAKER_06]: You could also import for much cheaper a Smart Headset 3, which is also released on the PlayStation 3.

925
01:07:06,716 --> 01:07:07,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Who cares, right?

926
01:07:07,637 --> 01:07:08,998
[SPEAKER_06]: How about on the Xbox 360?

927
01:07:09,198 --> 01:07:10,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, Earth Defense Forces 4.

928
01:07:10,839 --> 01:07:13,841
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also a limited edition with gold membership for $86.99.

929
01:07:13,961 --> 01:07:18,464
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm assuming that's like Xbox Live Japan, because you know who's paying for Xbox Live over there.

930
01:07:18,864 --> 01:07:20,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Very few people, I'm sure.

931
01:07:21,486 --> 01:07:23,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing of note on the Vita this week.

932
01:07:23,888 --> 01:07:25,148
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just looking at my other releases.

933
01:07:25,589 --> 01:07:27,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, nothing really on Wii U either.

934
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:29,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you know they don't have new Super Luigi U until July 13th?

935
01:07:30,132 --> 01:07:31,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I bet that's the retail release, though.

936
01:07:32,473 --> 01:07:34,495
[SPEAKER_06]: They probably have the download version, just not the retail release.

937
01:07:34,756 --> 01:07:35,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, how about on the Nintendo 3DS?

938
01:07:36,337 --> 01:07:38,479
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a couple games there.

939
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:43,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Toriko Gourmet Battle comes out, as well as Mame Goma Happy Sweets Farm.

940
01:07:44,285 --> 01:07:45,667
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds nice.

941
01:07:45,867 --> 01:07:49,630
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see... God, I hope it's not another game starring scantily clad characters.

942
01:07:49,791 --> 01:07:51,893
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, it's the little seal cute thing!

943
01:07:52,529 --> 01:07:54,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that stars a little seal cute thing.

944
01:07:54,830 --> 01:07:56,651
[SPEAKER_11]: I love the plushies of the little seal.

945
01:07:56,791 --> 01:07:58,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh God, these things are adorable.

946
01:07:58,032 --> 01:07:59,633
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like they just kind of wither on the ground.

947
01:07:59,653 --> 01:08:00,513
[SPEAKER_10]: They're so adorbs.

948
01:08:00,913 --> 01:08:01,834
[SPEAKER_06]: And they run a farm.

949
01:08:01,954 --> 01:08:04,735
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Farmville and they also make sushi rolls.

950
01:08:06,016 --> 01:08:06,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob, that's a sweet roll.

951
01:08:07,157 --> 01:08:08,117
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a sweet roll, my bad.

952
01:08:08,277 --> 01:08:09,178
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a Swiss cake.

953
01:08:10,118 --> 01:08:12,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's a little Debbie roll with the strawberry.

954
01:08:12,639 --> 01:08:13,660
[SPEAKER_10]: It's called a Swiss cake.

955
01:08:14,730 --> 01:08:16,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, a little Debbie roll.

956
01:08:17,031 --> 01:08:18,732
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a strawberry shortcake.

957
01:08:19,852 --> 01:08:21,473
[SPEAKER_06]: I want them to localize that.

958
01:08:21,713 --> 01:08:23,714
[SPEAKER_06]: I want a fucking strawberry shortcake, damn.

959
01:08:23,874 --> 01:08:25,715
[SPEAKER_11]: You know we have strawberry cheesecake ice cream at my house.

960
01:08:27,196 --> 01:08:28,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's going to my house after the show?

961
01:08:29,077 --> 01:08:31,618
[SPEAKER_06]: No, because that would involve going outside, I'm sorry to say.

962
01:08:32,779 --> 01:08:34,119
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it for Japanese releases.

963
01:08:34,219 --> 01:08:35,220
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, how about the UK?

964
01:08:35,899 --> 01:08:36,679
[SPEAKER_11]: Some stuff.

965
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,021
[SPEAKER_11]: Stuff and things are coming out.

966
01:08:40,041 --> 01:08:44,363
[SPEAKER_11]: What we have on July 3rd is we have Limbo for iPad and iPhone.

967
01:08:44,423 --> 01:08:46,284
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god, I need that on my phone.

968
01:08:48,305 --> 01:08:48,645
[SPEAKER_11]: Not really.

969
01:08:49,086 --> 01:08:50,626
[SPEAKER_11]: Mortal Kombat Complete Collection.

970
01:08:51,027 --> 01:08:52,467
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, Complete Edition.

971
01:08:52,848 --> 01:08:57,150
[SPEAKER_11]: They should have called it Complete Collection, but no, I see why, because then they would have been racist.

972
01:08:58,090 --> 01:08:58,851
[SPEAKER_11]: That's on PC.

973
01:08:59,111 --> 01:08:59,951
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, you know what I mean.

974
01:09:00,651 --> 01:09:01,572
[SPEAKER_11]: Too many, too many...

975
01:09:03,399 --> 01:09:12,326
[SPEAKER_11]: and we have a Scourge Outbreak on Xbox 360 and on July 4th we have Trackmania 2 Valley and on the 5th we have Dark.

976
01:09:14,108 --> 01:09:14,568
[SPEAKER_08]: Sakura?

977
01:09:15,049 --> 01:09:15,989
[SPEAKER_11]: No, just Dark.

978
01:09:16,490 --> 01:09:16,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Sakura.

979
01:09:17,371 --> 01:09:19,092
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a vampire stealth action game.

980
01:09:20,954 --> 01:09:23,115
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know why but that made me think of Craig Ferguson.

981
01:09:23,496 --> 01:09:26,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Being published by Atlas because they publish Calypso games now.

982
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:31,362
[SPEAKER_11]: It made me think of Craig Ferguson talking about damp being a color.

983
01:09:32,475 --> 01:09:35,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a couple more news stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week, Loki.

984
01:09:36,298 --> 01:09:37,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Or don't.

985
01:09:39,940 --> 01:09:43,743
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's some cool stuff being added to Steam.

986
01:09:44,283 --> 01:09:49,707
[SPEAKER_04]: First off, the Source Software Development Kit now is including native support for the Oculus Rift.

987
01:09:50,027 --> 01:09:56,031
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have the dev kit, you got more games to play it on, or at least hopefully soon.

988
01:09:57,653 --> 01:10:00,635
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're really embracing that, and that's going to be kind of cool.

989
01:10:00,655 --> 01:10:00,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

990
01:10:01,755 --> 01:10:05,318
[SPEAKER_04]: And then finally, the Steam trading cards.

991
01:10:05,818 --> 01:10:06,519
[SPEAKER_04]: It's out of beta.

992
01:10:06,919 --> 01:10:07,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's available to everybody.

993
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:25,131
[SPEAKER_04]: So far it supports 30 games, including Team Fortress 2, Faster Than Light, Grid 2, Monaco, Trying 2, Super Meat Boy, Counter-Strike Global Offensive, Portal, Half-Life, Don't Starve, and Borderlands 2.

994
01:10:25,811 --> 01:10:31,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so at the risk of sounding like a complete moron, can someone explain to me how the trading card thing works?

995
01:10:31,535 --> 01:10:34,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's not based on achievements.

996
01:10:34,537 --> 01:10:35,878
[SPEAKER_06]: It's based on time playing the game.

997
01:10:36,458 --> 01:10:37,439
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

998
01:10:37,559 --> 01:10:40,561
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, I think it might be on achievements.

999
01:10:40,921 --> 01:10:42,742
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's just based on time playing the game.

1000
01:10:43,242 --> 01:10:45,204
[SPEAKER_06]: I noticed I have a Steam level now, too.

1001
01:10:45,304 --> 01:10:48,185
[SPEAKER_06]: So you get, like, XP, and I think some of that's from the trading cards, right?

1002
01:10:48,205 --> 01:10:51,187
[SPEAKER_06]: But I got a lot from participating in old sales and things like that.

1003
01:10:51,488 --> 01:10:54,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Which, by the way, July 4th is next week.

1004
01:10:54,289 --> 01:10:55,070
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what that means.

1005
01:10:55,390 --> 01:11:16,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Barbecue at my house Hide your wallets Hide your wife, hide your kids Cause steam sales is gonna happen I ain't got cash for that shit And they slashing all the prices on up here See, here's the thing though, I've already bought so much stuff I don't really know if there's much more I need All I need is that Civ 5 expansion That's all I need No, Rob, you want it

1006
01:11:19,366 --> 01:11:20,447
[SPEAKER_06]: You need air.

1007
01:11:20,847 --> 01:11:21,688
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I fucking need it.

1008
01:11:21,708 --> 01:11:22,548
[SPEAKER_04]: The new expansion?

1009
01:11:22,588 --> 01:11:23,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Which expansion?

1010
01:11:23,569 --> 01:11:24,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Will you die without it?

1011
01:11:24,770 --> 01:11:29,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you need me to get it because otherwise you will not want to be on this program with me.

1012
01:11:29,753 --> 01:11:30,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we'll have grumpy Nick Trump.

1013
01:11:30,734 --> 01:11:34,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you talking about the new expansion coming out in July or the one that's... The one that's like a couple weeks.

1014
01:11:34,496 --> 01:11:35,797
[SPEAKER_06]: You know July is tomorrow, right?

1015
01:11:36,218 --> 01:11:40,220
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand that, but no, you're talking about the one that's coming out in... Brave New World.

1016
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:43,502
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not going to be on the Steam sale, but it's something on Steam I need to get.

1017
01:11:43,542 --> 01:11:44,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Brave New World.

1018
01:11:45,526 --> 01:11:48,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't remember if that's next week or if that's going to be the week after next.

1019
01:11:48,628 --> 01:11:49,308
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's the 8th.

1020
01:11:49,888 --> 01:11:53,110
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're releasing it just in time for my boyfriend's birthday.

1021
01:11:53,230 --> 01:11:55,912
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there's like all of two games on Steam right now I'm interested in.

1022
01:11:57,012 --> 01:11:59,113
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of them is that Miami.

1023
01:11:59,734 --> 01:12:00,594
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't ever remember.

1024
01:12:00,634 --> 01:12:01,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Hotline Miami.

1025
01:12:01,835 --> 01:12:06,417
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I want to go around shooting people in bloody messes with weird synth music.

1026
01:12:06,517 --> 01:12:08,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Should have gotten in on that with the Humble Bundle, man.

1027
01:12:08,718 --> 01:12:09,719
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I know.

1028
01:12:09,739 --> 01:12:10,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Good prices there.

1029
01:12:10,739 --> 01:12:11,700
[SPEAKER_11]: But I have Bill's.

1030
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:14,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Bills.

1031
01:12:15,451 --> 01:12:17,492
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's see.

1032
01:12:17,512 --> 01:12:19,313
[SPEAKER_11]: I just had to do something like go to Alabama.

1033
01:12:19,953 --> 01:12:23,735
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, one more story for you guys here, and this is a follow-up to something we had talked about before.

1034
01:12:24,095 --> 01:12:29,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, Nintendo may have been easing up a bit on the whole Let's Play video thing.

1035
01:12:29,238 --> 01:12:41,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember that they were really unpopular for a week there because they didn't shut down Let's Play videos, but they were like, we're going to take the money and use it for us if you have a Let's Play video that features our newer games.

1036
01:12:42,404 --> 01:12:43,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, OuyaLaunch.

1037
01:13:06,098 --> 01:13:06,958
[SPEAKER_06]: You think that's part of it?

1038
01:13:07,218 --> 01:13:07,839
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.

1039
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:17,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Since you mentioned analytics and stuff like that and getting paid on stuff, I just happened to check my... Well, here's the timing on this.

1040
01:13:17,565 --> 01:13:24,809
[SPEAKER_06]: It's part of the revenue reports because on May 14th, his ad earnings ceased, but then they started again on May 23rd.

1041
01:13:25,290 --> 01:13:30,713
[SPEAKER_06]: So he made a leap of faith since he saw the revenue return and no other claims have been made on his videos since.

1042
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:33,555
[SPEAKER_06]: So Nintendo may have given up as fast as they implemented it.

1043
01:13:33,575 --> 01:13:34,176
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's what?

1044
01:13:34,396 --> 01:13:35,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Two weeks, if even?

1045
01:13:36,097 --> 01:13:40,581
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, when we talked about this on Game Buoy, this kind of was an unpopular opinion, actually.

1046
01:13:40,641 --> 01:13:46,826
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just didn't really understand people actually making a living off of Let's Plays.

1047
01:13:48,007 --> 01:13:48,668
[SPEAKER_07]: It happens.

1048
01:13:48,728 --> 01:13:50,870
[SPEAKER_07]: If it works for you, I guess more power to you.

1049
01:13:50,930 --> 01:13:57,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, as I mentioned before, because I started monetizing some of my YouTube videos just...

1050
01:13:58,836 --> 01:13:59,157
[SPEAKER_04]: and so on.

1051
01:14:23,783 --> 01:14:25,824
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm in the wrong fucking business.

1052
01:14:26,065 --> 01:14:28,066
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the last episode of OLR, everybody.

1053
01:14:28,086 --> 01:14:36,410
[SPEAKER_06]: It was wonderful these last 11 years, but we're moving to YouTube next week in our little five-minute chunk segments, which will just be Loki and I arguing and DarkSakura crying.

1054
01:14:36,790 --> 01:14:38,091
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, no, no, no.

1055
01:14:38,491 --> 01:14:40,893
[SPEAKER_11]: Dan and I were actually talking about doing this with our TurboGrafx games.

1056
01:14:40,913 --> 01:14:42,373
[SPEAKER_11]: It'll be fun.

1057
01:14:43,034 --> 01:14:44,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's money to be made.

1058
01:14:44,134 --> 01:14:48,617
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm not looking to make a living off of putting YouTube videos out there, but...

1059
01:14:50,146 --> 01:14:52,887
[SPEAKER_04]: It's $36 I didn't have before.

1060
01:14:52,907 --> 01:14:52,887
$36?

1061
01:14:53,007 --> 01:14:58,290
[SPEAKER_04]: That's about halfway to the Earth Defense Force 4.

1062
01:14:58,630 --> 01:14:59,331
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

1063
01:15:00,171 --> 01:15:00,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

1064
01:15:00,711 --> 01:15:01,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

1065
01:15:01,452 --> 01:15:11,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, and I'm kind of actually, Slidekick, I know you said that it was an unpopular opinion, but I think when we talked about this on the show originally, I actually kind of voiced a very similar thing where I'm like, really?

1066
01:15:12,277 --> 01:15:13,157
[SPEAKER_06]: You can make a living off this?

1067
01:15:13,478 --> 01:15:13,678
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean...

1068
01:15:14,418 --> 01:15:18,640
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, no shade to those that do very well with Let's Play videos.

1069
01:15:18,740 --> 01:15:19,501
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a respect.

1070
01:15:19,821 --> 01:15:21,202
[SPEAKER_06]: It takes work to do this podcast.

1071
01:15:21,242 --> 01:15:22,823
[SPEAKER_06]: It takes a lot of work to do those Let's Play videos.

1072
01:15:23,183 --> 01:15:28,305
[SPEAKER_06]: But you have to admit you do owe some of the success to the game that you are featuring.

1073
01:15:28,546 --> 01:15:28,986
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

1074
01:15:29,446 --> 01:15:29,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1075
01:15:29,846 --> 01:15:35,529
[SPEAKER_06]: So, if they want to come in and get a cut... But I think Nintendo just kind of did a dick move by cutting it all off, you know what I mean?

1076
01:15:35,829 --> 01:15:37,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, there should have been some type of sharing, you know?

1077
01:15:38,210 --> 01:15:42,091
[SPEAKER_06]: The Let's Play content gets something, but Nintendo gets a little something-something too.

1078
01:15:42,332 --> 01:15:45,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, you know, they get their own commercials in there, you know, things like that.

1079
01:15:45,713 --> 01:15:48,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they need to take a smaller cut, you know?

1080
01:15:48,414 --> 01:15:50,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, circumcision, not Lorena Bobbitt.

1081
01:15:53,216 --> 01:15:54,277
[SPEAKER_11]: What is wrong with you?

1082
01:15:54,317 --> 01:15:56,778
[SPEAKER_11]: That is a great analogy.

1083
01:15:57,579 --> 01:15:57,819
[SPEAKER_11]: Bump.

1084
01:15:58,419 --> 01:15:58,679
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks.

1085
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:00,260
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want your hand disease.

1086
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:01,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't fist bump him for that.

1087
01:16:02,141 --> 01:16:02,521
[SPEAKER_11]: I did.

1088
01:16:03,042 --> 01:16:06,684
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't high five him because I don't like... I hope you get the blister thing.

1089
01:16:06,704 --> 01:16:08,865
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not going to happen.

1090
01:16:09,185 --> 01:16:09,926
[SPEAKER_11]: Here, Rob.

1091
01:16:10,426 --> 01:16:11,687
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't touch me.

1092
01:16:11,727 --> 01:16:12,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't wash your hands.

1093
01:16:13,207 --> 01:16:13,568
[SPEAKER_11]: Fine.

1094
01:16:14,248 --> 01:16:16,149
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't get it from touching my hands.

1095
01:16:16,950 --> 01:16:18,570
I'm not afraid of germs.

1096
01:16:20,148 --> 01:16:21,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Clearly you're not afraid of germs.

1097
01:16:22,057 --> 01:16:24,288
[SPEAKER_04]: If she starts handling my feces, I can't make any promises.

1098
01:16:29,107 --> 01:16:30,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have a diaper fetish, Loki?

1099
01:16:30,667 --> 01:16:31,287
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I do not.

1100
01:16:31,367 --> 01:16:32,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's good.

1101
01:16:32,068 --> 01:16:32,548
[SPEAKER_06]: That's good.

1102
01:16:33,408 --> 01:16:35,568
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that was just your dinner that smelled.

1103
01:16:36,769 --> 01:16:43,650
[SPEAKER_11]: For the record, if you would pay attention, the more you expose yourself to germs, the stronger your immune system gets.

1104
01:16:43,670 --> 01:16:51,152
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's very good chance if you were a kid that went to preschool or something like that, you probably already have had this and you won't catch it again.

1105
01:16:52,292 --> 01:16:55,993
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, for the most part, when kids have this, they don't even develop the blisters.

1106
01:16:56,473 --> 01:16:57,953
[SPEAKER_11]: They'll run a fever and have a sore throat.

1107
01:16:58,113 --> 01:16:58,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1108
01:16:58,773 --> 01:17:03,698
[SPEAKER_06]: ShadowNextGen says, YouTube also has a policy where you can't monetize videos for content you don't own.

1109
01:17:04,078 --> 01:17:08,642
[SPEAKER_06]: So this whole thing is a bit confusing to me as to how it was allowed to happen in the first place.

1110
01:17:08,722 --> 01:17:10,544
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a comment from live.vognetwork.com.

1111
01:17:11,284 --> 01:17:17,109
[SPEAKER_06]: And ClericalError404 follows this up with, it's been about 15 years since I heard a Lorena Bobbitt reference.

1112
01:17:17,510 --> 01:17:18,150
[SPEAKER_06]: You're welcome.

1113
01:17:18,410 --> 01:17:21,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep it classy and old school here at OLR.

1114
01:17:21,974 --> 01:17:22,874
[SPEAKER_06]: That's way too long.

1115
01:17:22,894 --> 01:17:23,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1116
01:17:24,358 --> 01:17:25,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's the thing.

1117
01:17:25,179 --> 01:17:36,206
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that the whole YouTube policy originally was just to prevent people from, okay, some dude makes a video and then I copy said video, put it up on my channel and monetize it.

1118
01:17:36,287 --> 01:17:44,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's me humming along to this new movie that's out in theaters, Man of Steel.

1119
01:17:44,412 --> 01:17:48,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Man of Steel, Man of Steel, Man of Steel.

1120
01:17:48,955 --> 01:17:53,359
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's my little, you know, that would be very bad, I think.

1121
01:17:55,801 --> 01:18:00,064
[SPEAKER_11]: I paid good money for this hue card and I own all the data on it.

1122
01:18:01,686 --> 01:18:06,310
[SPEAKER_11]: I paid an entire $5 from the garage sale for this hue card.

1123
01:18:06,870 --> 01:18:07,351
[SPEAKER_11]: I own it.

1124
01:18:07,811 --> 01:18:11,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, DarkSakura is clearly stepping into a time portal over there so you know what that means.

1125
01:18:12,095 --> 01:18:15,158
[SPEAKER_06]: It's time for the classic game of the week.

1126
01:18:16,477 --> 01:18:27,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Every week, DarkSakura goes into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey, you kids and your YouTubing and making careers off of Mario U, you know what?

1127
01:18:28,123 --> 01:18:34,626
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to go back to my day when we used to pay $400 for a frickin' Neo Geo game and we liked it.

1128
01:18:35,206 --> 01:18:37,949
[SPEAKER_10]: and really weird games were really cool.

1129
01:18:38,009 --> 01:18:41,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, really weird games are kind of still cool, let's be real.

1130
01:18:41,252 --> 01:18:42,133
[SPEAKER_06]: But this one was weird.

1131
01:18:42,193 --> 01:18:44,875
[SPEAKER_06]: This one was weird, and it's not in the OTO, it's a little newer than that.

1132
01:18:45,116 --> 01:18:46,557
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1133
01:18:46,817 --> 01:18:48,499
[SPEAKER_11]: The classic game of the week is Mr. Mosquito.

1134
01:18:48,519 --> 01:18:50,040
[SPEAKER_11]: It's weird.

1135
01:18:50,180 --> 01:18:54,465
[SPEAKER_11]: I figured to go for a PS2 era, you know, finally moving up a little bit.

1136
01:18:55,205 --> 01:18:58,689
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Mosquito was... This is Rina's room again.

1137
01:18:58,949 --> 01:18:59,069
[SPEAKER_11]: Oops.

1138
01:18:59,329 --> 01:19:00,169
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1139
01:19:21,276 --> 01:19:24,078
[SPEAKER_11]: and the following March in everywhere else.

1140
01:19:24,639 --> 01:19:26,440
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was distributed by Eidos.

1141
01:19:28,782 --> 01:19:34,986
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, you play as a mosquito who has taken up residence in the Yamada family's house.

1142
01:19:36,968 --> 01:19:43,993
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if they were voiced by the Japanese voice actors because the accents are really thick.

1143
01:19:44,273 --> 01:19:46,394
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, they're legit accents too, so...

1144
01:19:47,515 --> 01:19:56,502
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, you have to stock up on enough blood in the summer so that you will survive through the winter ahead, which is funny because don't mosquitoes only live for like a week?

1145
01:19:57,262 --> 01:20:03,187
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, so you can collect these spheres to save extra blood.

1146
01:20:03,767 --> 01:20:25,802
[SPEAKER_11]: and you have to suck the blood from them while they're going about their everyday business but you can only get it from certain body parts at certain times like this scene here with the girl on her bed you can only suck it from her upper thigh he's getting a little close to the no-no spot so this is a little bit of a scandalous game he's actually close to the femoral artery

1147
01:20:27,984 --> 01:20:33,231
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, if he is swatted while sucking, then instant death occurs.

1148
01:20:33,271 --> 01:20:38,017
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically you have a stress meter so you have to balance your suck with your stress.

1149
01:20:39,439 --> 01:20:40,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't we all?

1150
01:20:41,866 --> 01:21:09,359
[SPEAKER_11]: and then to calm them basically they will try to battle you too like a big boss battle like what we're watching right now on this video where you have stress points that you have to I guess sting them on or bite them on that are meant to calm them so it's like you're doing acupressure on them you're doing mosquito shiatsu there you go you can get smacked all over the room and it's really hilarious

1151
01:21:09,761 --> 01:21:11,022
[SPEAKER_11]: So you have different stages.

1152
01:21:11,042 --> 01:21:13,284
[SPEAKER_11]: You can go through different parts of the house.

1153
01:21:13,805 --> 01:21:17,088
[SPEAKER_11]: And you have different items, different things to help you.

1154
01:21:19,530 --> 01:21:26,216
[SPEAKER_11]: The fun thing about this game too is that your ending depends on how much sucking you did.

1155
01:21:27,122 --> 01:21:28,263
[SPEAKER_11]: Like how successful you were.

1156
01:21:28,283 --> 01:21:34,306
[SPEAKER_11]: Because for the Yamada family, they're going to have their family portrait taken at the end of the summer.

1157
01:21:35,547 --> 01:21:42,291
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's like if you completed all the missions and everything, they're all puffed up and swollen all over their faces and the picture's horrible.

1158
01:21:43,312 --> 01:22:01,091
[SPEAKER_11]: and it's really funny the voice acting is actually super hilarious too um as for the game it was voted one of the top 10 weirdest games of all time in 2008 by Game Informer and um G4 put it on its list of weird games and uh

1159
01:22:03,093 --> 01:22:10,215
[SPEAKER_11]: It was really weird, but Famitsu said it was the fifth best-selling video game in Japan during its release.

1160
01:22:11,035 --> 01:22:13,295
[SPEAKER_11]: It sold 41,006 copies.

1161
01:22:15,796 --> 01:22:22,617
[SPEAKER_11]: It also got a release on PlayStation 2 the best, and it led to a sequel in Japan on July 3, 2003 called K2 Let's Go Hawaii.

1162
01:22:25,658 --> 01:22:26,219
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1163
01:22:44,256 --> 01:23:00,525
[SPEAKER_11]: but this game was just wrong and like you could do other stuff too like you could distract the people in the room by like turning off the light switch or changing the music or doing all this other stuff it's just bizarre but it works it's a very strange game but it's awesome like it's you just you have to see it

1164
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:14,976
[SPEAKER_11]: and like this week I wanted to pick games that were all in the same vein of Incredible Crisis because that game was fucked up and this game I'd have to put it's fucked upness level somewhere near Incredible Crisis so alright

1165
01:23:16,532 --> 01:23:18,053
[SPEAKER_06]: There it is, your classic game of the week.

1166
01:23:18,113 --> 01:23:19,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Mosquito on the PlayStation 2.

1167
01:23:21,855 --> 01:23:23,555
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, very good pick tonight.

1168
01:23:24,256 --> 01:23:25,797
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit edumacational, too.

1169
01:23:26,397 --> 01:23:27,557
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, don't go anywhere, guys.

1170
01:23:27,577 --> 01:23:30,559
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got plenty more OLR to come tonight with more Slidekick.

1171
01:23:30,939 --> 01:23:33,020
[SPEAKER_06]: The Fugle Question of the Week coming at you.

1172
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:36,662
[SPEAKER_06]: Going to talk a little bit about Ouya in the Fugle Question of the Week as well as some news.

1173
01:23:37,262 --> 01:23:40,623
[SPEAKER_06]: And also we'll talk about the upcoming Moley Jam.

1174
01:23:41,704 --> 01:23:42,764
[SPEAKER_06]: That's always hilarious.

1175
01:23:42,965 --> 01:23:43,785
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to talk about that.

1176
01:23:44,326 --> 01:23:50,916
[SPEAKER_06]: All that and more including your phone calls, CFUs of the week, Twitter topics and all that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1177
01:24:02,754 --> 01:24:10,123
[SPEAKER_01]: Hola, this is your friendly neighborhood Mexican, Actdeft, and you're participating with Orange Noun Radio, the show where every gamer has a voice.

1178
01:24:10,723 --> 01:24:14,307
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to use my voice to tell you that Kirby does not suck.

1179
01:24:15,028 --> 01:24:18,893
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, literally he does suck, but not figuratively.

1180
01:24:19,333 --> 01:24:20,795
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, play more Kirby!

1181
01:24:22,674 --> 01:24:23,494
[SPEAKER_06]: Play more Kirby.

1182
01:24:23,754 --> 01:24:24,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Do it now.

1183
01:24:24,535 --> 01:24:29,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, not now, because you're trying to listen to LLR.

1184
01:24:29,337 --> 01:24:30,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Poor guy, man.

1185
01:24:30,517 --> 01:24:33,659
[SPEAKER_04]: We put forums in chat that it was like 112 degrees or something.

1186
01:24:34,079 --> 01:24:34,319
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

1187
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:35,399
[SPEAKER_04]: We're here bitching.

1188
01:24:36,380 --> 01:24:37,841
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like tomorrow, though, by the way.

1189
01:24:38,001 --> 01:24:39,041
[SPEAKER_11]: I did look up Phoenix.

1190
01:24:40,342 --> 01:24:40,882
[SPEAKER_11]: Phoenix was at 116.

1191
01:24:40,922 --> 01:24:44,023
[SPEAKER_11]: So Phoenix is like on fire.

1192
01:24:44,163 --> 01:24:45,664
[SPEAKER_06]: What about Needles in Death Valley?

1193
01:24:45,704 --> 01:24:47,605
[SPEAKER_06]: That's always the lousy place to look at.

1194
01:24:49,005 --> 01:24:49,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't we say 122?

1195
01:24:51,761 --> 01:24:53,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, that was a repeat bumper there.

1196
01:24:53,562 --> 01:24:54,904
[SPEAKER_06]: That means we need more bumpers.

1197
01:24:55,004 --> 01:25:00,868
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm sure Actdeft is happy to have his voice played on the show all the time, as well as some of our other repeats we'll get into.

1198
01:25:01,248 --> 01:25:06,032
[SPEAKER_11]: We're Orange Lounge Radio, the place where Actdeft has a voice.

1199
01:25:06,092 --> 01:25:10,055
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to get your voice heard, go over to our forums at vognetwork.com.

1200
01:25:10,095 --> 01:25:11,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Click on forums and check out the Orange Lounge Radio forum.

1201
01:25:12,217 --> 01:25:15,259
[SPEAKER_06]: The call for bumpers is there, and it's very easy.

1202
01:25:15,299 --> 01:25:16,721
[SPEAKER_06]: You can even Skype them in if you don't know.

1203
01:25:16,781 --> 01:25:17,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, don't...

1204
01:25:17,341 --> 01:25:18,002
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1205
01:25:43,439 --> 01:25:44,059
[SPEAKER_06]: We did.

1206
01:25:44,139 --> 01:25:44,660
[SPEAKER_06]: We did.

1207
01:25:45,180 --> 01:25:50,023
[SPEAKER_06]: And you sure love to rub it in how good at game show video games you are, huh?

1208
01:25:50,443 --> 01:25:51,864
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I just have a natural talent.

1209
01:25:52,924 --> 01:25:55,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you practice Wheel of Fortune a lot as a kid?

1210
01:25:56,006 --> 01:25:57,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I played a lot of Wheel of Fortune as a kid.

1211
01:25:57,627 --> 01:25:58,427
[SPEAKER_07]: 5,000 paths.

1212
01:25:58,467 --> 01:26:00,909
[SPEAKER_11]: We've had a Wheel of Fortune winner on the show.

1213
01:26:02,139 --> 01:26:02,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I know, yes.

1214
01:26:02,899 --> 01:26:04,920
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of think I need to actually go on Wheel of Fortune.

1215
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:09,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Our buddy Mel, who needs to come back to the show, by the way, actually won a car on Wheel of Fortune like years ago.

1216
01:26:09,923 --> 01:26:10,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

1217
01:26:10,043 --> 01:26:11,323
[SPEAKER_06]: It was during Price is Right.

1218
01:26:11,704 --> 01:26:12,984
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it was on Wheel of Fortune.

1219
01:26:13,004 --> 01:26:13,684
[SPEAKER_06]: It was on Wheel of Fortune.

1220
01:26:13,704 --> 01:26:15,505
[SPEAKER_11]: Because he even put up the clip of him winning.

1221
01:26:15,885 --> 01:26:20,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, his Facebook cover photo is him solving the pumpkin pie or whatever his final thing was.

1222
01:26:21,148 --> 01:26:23,989
[SPEAKER_11]: And I have been in that Camaro, and it was a bitchin' Camaro.

1223
01:26:24,389 --> 01:26:26,711
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a co-worker that won a car on Price is Right.

1224
01:26:26,751 --> 01:26:27,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

1225
01:26:27,211 --> 01:26:29,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he won a car and like a China cabinet.

1226
01:26:30,292 --> 01:26:33,953
[SPEAKER_11]: And the sucky thing they never tell you about winning prizes like that is that you have to pay taxes.

1227
01:26:34,293 --> 01:26:35,493
[SPEAKER_06]: All these game show winners.

1228
01:26:36,394 --> 01:26:38,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Alan's here to lend his commentary.

1229
01:26:38,074 --> 01:26:38,494
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Alan.

1230
01:26:39,554 --> 01:26:41,275
[SPEAKER_12]: Talking about prices right just reminded me of something.

1231
01:26:41,515 --> 01:26:43,815
[SPEAKER_12]: There's going to be an all Plinko episode in September.

1232
01:26:44,176 --> 01:26:44,656
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1233
01:26:44,756 --> 01:26:45,476
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, all Plinko.

1234
01:26:45,956 --> 01:26:46,756
[SPEAKER_12]: August or September.

1235
01:26:46,816 --> 01:26:47,196
[SPEAKER_12]: Google it.

1236
01:26:47,396 --> 01:26:49,257
[SPEAKER_11]: If I'm working, I'm just going to quit and watch.

1237
01:26:51,474 --> 01:26:51,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Viewing party.

1238
01:26:51,994 --> 01:26:52,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Kidding, kidding.

1239
01:26:53,435 --> 01:26:55,555
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never heard of a better reason to quit your job.

1240
01:26:57,496 --> 01:26:59,657
[SPEAKER_06]: And you get Plinko, and you get Plinko.

1241
01:27:00,497 --> 01:27:01,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone gets a Plinko.

1242
01:27:01,958 --> 01:27:05,619
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm surprised it's taken them 35 years or something to think about Plinko.

1243
01:27:05,719 --> 01:27:13,462
[SPEAKER_04]: If they want, see, PopCap, telling you, if you're smart, you market that son of a bitch on that show right there.

1244
01:27:13,962 --> 01:27:14,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?

1245
01:27:14,542 --> 01:27:16,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Peggle 2, Plinko.

1246
01:27:17,103 --> 01:27:19,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, you were getting a little pressed during Press Your Luck, weren't you?

1247
01:27:19,404 --> 01:27:21,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I was getting very pressed during Press Your Luck.

1248
01:27:21,986 --> 01:27:23,106
[SPEAKER_06]: How many whammies did you have?

1249
01:27:23,226 --> 01:27:32,411
[SPEAKER_06]: I had three whammies in the first round and fucking... Okay, so I actually uploaded to my Twitter, twitter.com slash S-K-I-E, that's Sky, twitter.com slash Sky.

1250
01:27:33,051 --> 01:27:35,093
[SPEAKER_06]: I've always liked more followers.

1251
01:27:35,433 --> 01:27:38,775
[SPEAKER_06]: But I actually posted a picture that's like, Slidekick, I hate you so much.

1252
01:27:39,055 --> 01:27:41,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's me and I have three whammies and no money.

1253
01:27:41,937 --> 01:27:43,238
[SPEAKER_06]: And he has no whammies.

1254
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:43,678
[SPEAKER_06]: He has like $7,000.

1255
01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:46,981
[SPEAKER_06]: And I ended up with over $50,000.

1256
01:27:47,161 --> 01:27:50,783
[SPEAKER_10]: Were you like the unemployed man who memorized the patterns and just sat and watched it?

1257
01:27:50,803 --> 01:27:51,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, he was.

1258
01:27:51,484 --> 01:27:53,045
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what happened to that guy, by the way?

1259
01:27:53,245 --> 01:27:53,665
[SPEAKER_06]: He died.

1260
01:27:53,965 --> 01:27:54,926
[SPEAKER_11]: No, besides that.

1261
01:27:55,106 --> 01:27:55,766
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

1262
01:27:56,687 --> 01:28:00,470
[SPEAKER_11]: He went on all the trips and everything and ended up investing the money in this scheme.

1263
01:28:00,490 --> 01:28:01,310
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yeah, he lost it all.

1264
01:28:01,330 --> 01:28:02,631
[SPEAKER_11]: And he lost all of it.

1265
01:28:02,991 --> 01:28:03,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, poor guy.

1266
01:28:03,732 --> 01:28:05,814
[SPEAKER_11]: If you come into money, be smart.

1267
01:28:06,735 --> 01:28:08,958
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you can have one of my two trips to Rio, Rob.

1268
01:28:08,978 --> 01:28:09,278
[SPEAKER_07]: It's okay.

1269
01:28:09,318 --> 01:28:09,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, shut up.

1270
01:28:09,839 --> 01:28:10,479
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't real.

1271
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:16,206
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't real as the lengthy disclaimer when you boot up the game lets you know that the prizes are not real.

1272
01:28:16,266 --> 01:28:17,207
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a contest.

1273
01:28:18,148 --> 01:28:23,514
[SPEAKER_07]: If I could make money winning game show video games, I'd just quit my job and do that in Let's Plays.

1274
01:28:24,054 --> 01:28:25,995
[SPEAKER_11]: We could get you a string of pearls and an apron.

1275
01:28:45,740 --> 01:28:46,600
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, that's a little bit awkward.

1276
01:28:46,620 --> 01:28:47,341
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1277
01:28:47,601 --> 01:28:50,022
[SPEAKER_06]: What were you going to say, DarkSakura, before I rudely cut you off?

1278
01:28:50,042 --> 01:28:51,062
[SPEAKER_11]: I forgot.

1279
01:28:51,883 --> 01:28:52,623
[SPEAKER_06]: It's for the best.

1280
01:28:52,803 --> 01:28:53,103
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1281
01:28:53,783 --> 01:28:54,624
[SPEAKER_11]: No whammies.

1282
01:28:55,084 --> 01:28:55,724
[SPEAKER_11]: Stop.

1283
01:28:57,785 --> 01:29:02,927
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkTetsuya says, I was just going to ask, are the patterns in the video game version like the old game show?

1284
01:29:03,167 --> 01:29:03,347
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1285
01:29:03,407 --> 01:29:04,608
[SPEAKER_11]: They're a lot more randomized.

1286
01:29:04,708 --> 01:29:07,049
[SPEAKER_06]: I highly doubt Slidekick had the time to memorize them.

1287
01:29:07,769 --> 01:29:10,430
[SPEAKER_06]: If you hit X as fast as you can, you seem to never hit a whammy.

1288
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:12,371
[SPEAKER_06]: And Slidekick figured that out in about five seconds.

1289
01:29:13,035 --> 01:29:14,316
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, one thing... Cheater.

1290
01:29:14,456 --> 01:29:15,377
[SPEAKER_11]: One thing, too... Cheater!

1291
01:29:15,657 --> 01:29:23,985
[SPEAKER_11]: ...is that after this guy basically broke the system, earning all that money, they changed the patterns and added in an extra randomizer.

1292
01:29:24,986 --> 01:29:27,107
[SPEAKER_06]: So... Oh, yeah, he made them change the game show.

1293
01:29:27,248 --> 01:29:34,294
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and basically, they couldn't actually call him out on cheating because he did what anyone could do.

1294
01:29:34,494 --> 01:29:36,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, he didn't cheat.

1295
01:29:36,135 --> 01:29:37,997
[SPEAKER_11]: They just told him he's not allowed to play again.

1296
01:29:38,457 --> 01:29:38,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

1297
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:41,301
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna take all your money

1298
01:30:00,287 --> 01:30:06,255
[SPEAKER_06]: I would love, like, an uncensored game show on TV.

1299
01:30:06,535 --> 01:30:12,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Not necessarily that they have to have all the TNA and stuff, but, like, I'm just saying, you know, we're just like, fuck!

1300
01:30:12,183 --> 01:30:13,024
[SPEAKER_04]: God damn it!

1301
01:30:13,264 --> 01:30:13,705
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

1302
01:30:14,679 --> 01:30:15,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did I say that?

1303
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:17,603
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like the wrong answer completely.

1304
01:30:18,143 --> 01:30:19,865
[SPEAKER_06]: This is motherfucking Jeopardy.

1305
01:30:19,985 --> 01:30:23,229
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you also get bonus points based on how well you're judged.

1306
01:30:25,251 --> 01:30:28,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Where all the trivia answers have to start with what the fuck.

1307
01:30:30,077 --> 01:30:31,919
[SPEAKER_06]: What the fuck is I don't care, Alex?

1308
01:30:33,681 --> 01:30:40,390
[SPEAKER_12]: That makes me think of The Price is Right where you're the really hard ones where you have to step on the floor to step out the price of the car.

1309
01:30:40,450 --> 01:30:44,455
[SPEAKER_12]: They always look to their family members and they can just be like, I fucking hate my family.

1310
01:30:44,475 --> 01:30:45,776
[SPEAKER_12]: You're all fucking walking home.

1311
01:30:46,137 --> 01:30:46,637
[SPEAKER_12]: Fuck you.

1312
01:30:46,678 --> 01:30:48,400
[SPEAKER_12]: And like Drew Carey's all really uncomfortable.

1313
01:30:52,322 --> 01:31:02,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh god, alright Moving on, we're talking too long about game shows Actually you can never talk too long about game shows Is that the Press Your Luck game that I got you like ages ago?

1314
01:31:02,085 --> 01:31:20,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, the DVD game, I still have that I was gonna say I've talked about before how badly I need to go on a reality game show And I don't think I could do Survivor Because if I didn't eat for 13 days I would be the biggest bitch I would get voted out so fast If I didn't eat for one day I'd be a bitch, let's be real

1315
01:31:20,832 --> 01:31:22,013
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't go on Big Brother.

1316
01:31:22,133 --> 01:31:24,395
[SPEAKER_11]: No, you would be a big bitch if you didn't have Pinkberry near you.

1317
01:31:24,515 --> 01:31:29,138
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't go on Big Brother anymore because I don't know if y'all are following this season, but what a bunch of racists.

1318
01:31:29,538 --> 01:31:31,599
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's pretty sick in that house right now.

1319
01:31:32,300 --> 01:31:35,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Paula Deen ain't got nothing on some of those people in the Big Brother house this season.

1320
01:31:37,803 --> 01:31:41,846
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was going to say there's a new show on ABC that's pretty fucking hilarious.

1321
01:31:42,286 --> 01:31:43,267
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called Whodunit.

1322
01:31:43,947 --> 01:32:10,073
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like Clue meets The Mole Which by the way, I know a lot of you judge reality TV shows And that's fine, a lot of it needs to be judged But The Mole was the best reality game show they ever had I'm like, if you're gonna try any reality TV, do The Mole So somebody decided to adapt The Mole into a Clue game called Whodunit But here's the great part Is that at the end of the episode Whoever scored the lowest on the quiz dies

1323
01:32:11,113 --> 01:32:16,356
[SPEAKER_06]: They become the victim in the next episode So the episode, literally, like the first episode aired, right?

1324
01:32:16,697 --> 01:32:32,086
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the guy who lost and didn't get the case right and got the lowest on the quiz He runs out at the very end, somebody set him on fire and he falls into the pool dead And he's all like, obviously it's all fake, it's makeup and all that stuff But all these people on Twitter were like, did they start killing people on TV?

1325
01:32:32,126 --> 01:32:32,706
[SPEAKER_06]: What the fuck?

1326
01:32:33,207 --> 01:32:34,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Ratings, oh my god Right?

1327
01:32:35,028 --> 01:32:36,109
[SPEAKER_06]: But I was like, dude

1328
01:32:36,869 --> 01:32:40,132
[SPEAKER_06]: He lost this game and he literally had to die in a fire.

1329
01:32:40,332 --> 01:32:41,393
[SPEAKER_06]: That is amazing.

1330
01:32:42,193 --> 01:32:43,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, did DarkSakura write this game?

1331
01:32:43,795 --> 01:32:45,776
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the closest we're going to get to Battle Royale.

1332
01:32:47,317 --> 01:32:48,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy Hunger Games.

1333
01:32:49,719 --> 01:32:52,542
[SPEAKER_06]: There's supposed to be a Hunger Games game show on CW this year.

1334
01:32:52,722 --> 01:32:59,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, but it's not Hunger Games, but it's so fucking obviously a thirsty ripoff of the Hunger Games.

1335
01:32:59,507 --> 01:33:00,768
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, what?

1336
01:33:00,788 --> 01:33:01,509
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, let me hear your book.

1337
01:33:02,149 --> 01:33:02,890
[SPEAKER_06]: What, the Hunger Games?

1338
01:33:02,950 --> 01:33:03,771
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on his Kindle.

1339
01:33:04,411 --> 01:33:04,551
Okay.

1340
01:33:06,373 --> 01:33:09,294
[SPEAKER_11]: This is why I hate Kindle.

1341
01:33:09,754 --> 01:33:10,135
[SPEAKER_11]: Shit.

1342
01:33:11,595 --> 01:33:16,418
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a thing called the internet where it's probably there.

1343
01:33:18,659 --> 01:33:23,122
[SPEAKER_10]: I like books where I can smell paper and ink and cry.

1344
01:33:23,382 --> 01:33:25,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody in chat has to know this show I'm talking about.

1345
01:33:25,543 --> 01:33:28,205
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on the CW.

1346
01:33:28,225 --> 01:33:32,747
[SPEAKER_06]: The CW doesn't have anything except the Whose Line Is It Anyway reboot starts in a couple weeks.

1347
01:33:33,067 --> 01:33:33,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Really soon.

1348
01:33:34,668 --> 01:33:35,468
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll have to watch that.

1349
01:33:36,088 --> 01:33:37,809
[SPEAKER_11]: And it has the lady.

1350
01:33:38,469 --> 01:33:40,709
[SPEAKER_06]: I just googled CW Hunger Games show.

1351
01:33:40,769 --> 01:33:41,530
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called The Hunt.

1352
01:33:43,210 --> 01:33:43,610
[SPEAKER_06]: The Hunt.

1353
01:33:44,290 --> 01:33:45,250
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not The Hunger Games.

1354
01:33:45,270 --> 01:33:45,911
[SPEAKER_06]: It's The Hunt.

1355
01:33:46,891 --> 01:33:47,731
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like it, though.

1356
01:33:47,771 --> 01:33:49,631
[SPEAKER_11]: I tell you, 10 years from now, Battle Royale.

1357
01:33:50,312 --> 01:33:56,213
[SPEAKER_06]: The one I can't wait for on ABC is called The Quest, which is supposed to be The Amazing Race meets a LARP.

1358
01:33:57,429 --> 01:33:58,730
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god, that sounds awesome.

1359
01:33:58,830 --> 01:33:59,771
[SPEAKER_11]: I would watch that one.

1360
01:34:00,151 --> 01:34:02,253
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, how do I get cast for this show?

1361
01:34:02,333 --> 01:34:05,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I would want to fucking go on the quest as a LARP.

1362
01:34:05,716 --> 01:34:06,816
[SPEAKER_11]: LARPers of the world unite.

1363
01:34:06,837 --> 01:34:07,937
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be amazing.

1364
01:34:08,037 --> 01:34:12,501
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway, it's like the producer of... I was a proud former LARPer, so whatever.

1365
01:34:12,541 --> 01:34:15,724
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the amazing... Well, I did Rocky Horror Picture Show, which is really close, okay?

1366
01:34:15,744 --> 01:34:16,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1367
01:34:16,204 --> 01:34:16,324
[SPEAKER_06]: It's...

1368
01:34:17,805 --> 01:34:21,268
[SPEAKER_06]: The Amazing Race producers and the Lord of the Rings producers or something like that.

1369
01:34:21,688 --> 01:34:22,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Making it.

1370
01:34:22,268 --> 01:34:28,653
[SPEAKER_11]: It's when you go to a live action vampire game and you see the people actually rigged up with the fake blood and everything spraying it everywhere.

1371
01:34:28,713 --> 01:34:29,413
[SPEAKER_11]: That's awesome.

1372
01:34:29,974 --> 01:34:31,755
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen the people throw the magic bags.

1373
01:34:31,835 --> 01:34:34,197
[SPEAKER_06]: The little bags that are supposed to be like, I'm throwing ice at you.

1374
01:34:34,937 --> 01:34:35,558
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't see me.

1375
01:34:38,502 --> 01:34:41,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, oh my god, we need to have an OLARP.

1376
01:34:43,328 --> 01:34:46,712
[SPEAKER_06]: No, and for anyone... Who would pay money to charity, of course?

1377
01:34:46,792 --> 01:34:47,132
[SPEAKER_06]: A charity.

1378
01:34:47,192 --> 01:34:49,635
[SPEAKER_06]: If we did an OLARP, who would pay money?

1379
01:34:50,156 --> 01:34:50,456
[SPEAKER_06]: I would.

1380
01:34:51,698 --> 01:34:52,118
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm broke.

1381
01:34:52,519 --> 01:34:58,546
[SPEAKER_11]: For the record, what I did to Rob was I did the Obfuscate thing, which is also stolen by John Cena if you watch wrestling.

1382
01:34:58,906 --> 01:35:01,069
[SPEAKER_11]: Wrestling Reference Bobby, uh, anyway.

1383
01:35:01,830 --> 01:35:05,995
[SPEAKER_11]: He does the waving his hand in his face and it's the you can't see where I am type thing.

1384
01:35:06,035 --> 01:35:11,381
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Melody was just asking me how she could raise money for her team and training thing that she's doing.

1385
01:35:12,703 --> 01:35:12,963
[SPEAKER_06]: O.L.

1386
01:35:12,983 --> 01:35:13,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Flarp.

1387
01:35:13,504 --> 01:35:13,724
[SPEAKER_06]: O.L.

1388
01:35:13,744 --> 01:35:13,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Larp.

1389
01:35:14,265 --> 01:35:14,665
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it.

1390
01:35:15,546 --> 01:35:16,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, are you gonna do it?

1391
01:35:16,708 --> 01:35:17,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on, Loki.

1392
01:35:17,188 --> 01:35:18,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds so ridiculous.

1393
01:35:18,270 --> 01:35:18,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah!

1394
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:24,301
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so fucking excited.

1395
01:35:24,381 --> 01:35:24,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1396
01:35:25,581 --> 01:35:26,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's move on.

1397
01:35:26,682 --> 01:35:27,042
[SPEAKER_11]: And Rob?

1398
01:35:27,262 --> 01:35:27,482
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1399
01:35:28,523 --> 01:35:29,023
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's the rule.

1400
01:35:29,304 --> 01:35:30,004
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, here's the rule.

1401
01:35:30,064 --> 01:35:31,465
[SPEAKER_11]: We each pick a video game character.

1402
01:35:32,385 --> 01:35:33,526
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have to cosplay.

1403
01:35:33,886 --> 01:35:34,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.

1404
01:35:34,687 --> 01:35:35,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.

1405
01:35:36,448 --> 01:35:36,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.

1406
01:35:36,588 --> 01:35:37,448
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to do Tingle.

1407
01:35:37,488 --> 01:35:38,189
[SPEAKER_06]: You can do your Sackboy.

1408
01:35:38,209 --> 01:35:40,030
[SPEAKER_11]: You should walk around in Sackboy.

1409
01:35:40,050 --> 01:35:42,351
[SPEAKER_06]: I already have a costume.

1410
01:35:42,371 --> 01:35:43,352
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll do it when it's cold.

1411
01:35:43,832 --> 01:35:44,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

1412
01:35:45,293 --> 01:35:47,654
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to go out to Vacaville and the Nut Tree.

1413
01:35:49,775 --> 01:35:52,796
[SPEAKER_06]: and play in the 112 degree heat.

1414
01:35:52,816 --> 01:35:53,977
[SPEAKER_11]: No, for anyone who doesn't know.

1415
01:35:53,997 --> 01:35:54,337
[SPEAKER_04]: He's dead.

1416
01:35:54,537 --> 01:35:55,257
[SPEAKER_04]: He's on the ground.

1417
01:35:55,277 --> 01:35:56,037
[SPEAKER_04]: He's not moving.

1418
01:35:56,658 --> 01:35:59,699
[SPEAKER_11]: Behind the nut tree is where the old Wren Fairgrounds used to be.

1419
01:36:00,579 --> 01:36:01,339
[SPEAKER_11]: That would be perfect.

1420
01:36:01,359 --> 01:36:02,960
[SPEAKER_11]: You know where we used to do LARP, Rob?

1421
01:36:03,700 --> 01:36:07,321
[SPEAKER_11]: We used to do it in the courtyard at my college at the University of South Alabama.

1422
01:36:07,742 --> 01:36:11,903
[SPEAKER_11]: And because that's the only thing there is to do that's exciting in Alabama, it's still going on probably.

1423
01:36:12,383 --> 01:36:15,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft wants to know what does the F in FLARP stand for?

1424
01:36:15,824 --> 01:36:17,485
[SPEAKER_11]: You only know if you like Homestuck.

1425
01:36:18,417 --> 01:36:19,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God.

1426
01:36:19,638 --> 01:36:19,959
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1427
01:36:20,819 --> 01:36:23,602
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, Ragenator says Loki should LARP his tingle.

1428
01:36:23,682 --> 01:36:24,002
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1429
01:36:24,523 --> 01:36:24,863
[SPEAKER_06]: He won't.

1430
01:36:24,943 --> 01:36:25,223
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1431
01:36:25,323 --> 01:36:31,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do some rapid-fire news because we're 12 minutes into Part B and haven't even touched rapid-fire news yet.

1432
01:36:31,189 --> 01:36:32,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Slag Kick.

1433
01:36:32,109 --> 01:36:32,890
[SPEAKER_06]: This is all your fault.

1434
01:36:32,930 --> 01:36:42,499
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be potentially cooler, though, than wearing that Zack Boy costume because that thing is like two or three layers of sweats in the summer.

1435
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:45,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that'll be fun.

1436
01:36:46,042 --> 01:36:46,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anyways.

1437
01:36:47,143 --> 01:36:51,407
[SPEAKER_04]: So Nordic Games, they've been acquiring and acquiring and acquiring.

1438
01:36:51,768 --> 01:37:01,196
[SPEAKER_04]: They bought up a bunch of the old THQ properties and now they're buying up some of Atari's properties including Desperados and Silver.

1439
01:37:02,397 --> 01:37:07,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and you may remember, Atari, you know, they've been selling off parts of their company.

1440
01:37:08,060 --> 01:37:10,001
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I wonder who's buying Marvel Metas, seriously.

1441
01:37:10,861 --> 01:37:18,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I guess they, um, I'm not sure what they're gonna do with it, but, you know, make some westerns, I guess?

1442
01:37:19,645 --> 01:37:19,966
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1443
01:37:21,666 --> 01:37:30,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Silver, I've not really, I'm not familiar with, but I guess that came out, um, was an action RPG in, uh, on the PC and Dreamcast back in 99, so...

1444
01:37:33,245 --> 01:37:41,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Retro City Rampage has been adding some new updates, including mod support, which is pretty sweet.

1445
01:37:42,249 --> 01:37:46,731
[SPEAKER_04]: You can create your own vehicles and characters, fonts, color palettes, etc.

1446
01:37:47,571 --> 01:37:57,495
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a new Retro Plus mode, which adds some more visual effects, including soft shadows and doubling the number of colors on screen.

1447
01:37:58,675 --> 01:38:11,279
[SPEAKER_04]: and also I guess this is going to be coming on Steam via automatic update and then on Good Old Games you have to log in and just re-download I guess grab the 1.11 update

1448
01:38:13,300 --> 01:38:14,441
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1449
01:38:34,102 --> 01:38:41,865
[SPEAKER_04]: And then last but not least, Project Anarchy, a brand new mobile development toolkit from Havok.

1450
01:38:42,785 --> 01:38:44,745
[SPEAKER_04]: And did I mention it's free?

1451
01:38:45,005 --> 01:38:53,328
[SPEAKER_04]: So you'll be able to use it to create some pretty awesome 3D games and freely publish on Android, iOS, Tizen.

1452
01:38:54,268 --> 01:38:55,509
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure what Tizen is.

1453
01:38:56,449 --> 01:39:01,071
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess it also has a provisional license to develop for but not publish on Windows.

1454
01:39:02,842 --> 01:39:04,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1455
01:39:05,765 --> 01:39:13,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I guess it will support low-level C++ access, Lua scripting, debugging, and other fun stuff.

1456
01:39:13,153 --> 01:39:15,596
[SPEAKER_04]: It includes tutorials and sample projects as well.

1457
01:39:16,557 --> 01:39:22,263
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to check that out, I would imagine you just go to Havoc's website, and it should be there.

1458
01:39:22,283 --> 01:39:23,544
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell is Tizen, though?

1459
01:39:23,564 --> 01:39:24,845
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never heard of Tizen.

1460
01:39:25,987 --> 01:39:35,137
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like an operating system for some smartphones, tablets, and vehicle infotainment, smart TVs.

1461
01:39:35,277 --> 01:39:36,879
[SPEAKER_04]: I have not heard of that.

1462
01:39:36,919 --> 01:39:38,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Something else to build a console out of.

1463
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:39,141
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess, yeah.

1464
01:39:39,722 --> 01:39:46,770
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, the potentials of this could have been epic, but it was unearthed an old ad from the Consumer Electronics Show from years ago.

1465
01:39:47,210 --> 01:39:48,171
[SPEAKER_06]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1466
01:40:03,148 --> 01:40:06,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy 2 was supposedly going to come out here at one point, but we all knew that.

1467
01:40:06,650 --> 01:40:11,992
[SPEAKER_06]: One of those big Lost Levels website or whatever kind of chronicles what happened with that game, and it didn't come out.

1468
01:40:12,532 --> 01:40:13,932
[SPEAKER_06]: But a lot of people didn't know this.

1469
01:40:14,012 --> 01:40:19,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy 3 was apparently planned at one point, but it clearly didn't get very far along.

1470
01:40:19,635 --> 01:40:27,618
[SPEAKER_06]: There's even some mock-up box art that shows the Nepto Dragon possibly there, some sea monsters clutching wood on a broken ship.

1471
01:40:27,998 --> 01:40:28,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy 2 and 3

1472
01:40:54,588 --> 01:40:55,989
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1473
01:41:16,169 --> 01:41:19,910
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really cool because, God, I can't wait to play this game all over again in HD.

1474
01:41:19,950 --> 01:41:20,310
[SPEAKER_06]: So pretty.

1475
01:41:20,410 --> 01:41:20,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1476
01:41:21,270 --> 01:41:22,750
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just, like, so excited about this.

1477
01:41:23,050 --> 01:41:24,851
[SPEAKER_06]: So, very cool.

1478
01:41:25,071 --> 01:41:28,492
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm less excited about this, but it's not going to stop me from getting the game.

1479
01:41:29,112 --> 01:41:31,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy X and X-2 HD Remaster.

1480
01:41:31,892 --> 01:41:36,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently, GameStop could be getting some type of limited edition exclusive or something.

1481
01:41:36,853 --> 01:41:44,595
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a flyer out there that was dated June 26 that talked about a free limited edition upgrade if you pre-ordered the HD thing.

1482
01:41:45,295 --> 01:41:56,987
[SPEAKER_06]: However, this is saying this could have been an error on GameStop's part because they apparently removed said mention and Square Enix has not said anything about it and it's not on GameStop.com.

1483
01:41:57,347 --> 01:41:59,189
[SPEAKER_04]: So don't freak, y'all.

1484
01:41:59,570 --> 01:42:05,355
[SPEAKER_04]: It must be reparations for the whole Deus Ex issue.

1485
01:42:05,375 --> 01:42:06,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's right.

1486
01:42:06,577 --> 01:42:08,318
[SPEAKER_06]: That wasn't that long ago, all things considered.

1487
01:42:09,479 --> 01:42:31,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, also, this is cool, a lot of people don't even realize there was a Game Gear Mega Man game And it was out there, it had some different bosses too, I don't recall Or was it some of the ones from 3, it only had like 4 bosses in it There was a whole series of different portable Mega Man games Like there was the WonderSwan one, and there was one other that I can't remember But there was the Game Gear one

1488
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:35,341
[SPEAKER_06]: The Game Gear version is on its way to the Nintendo 3DS eShop.

1489
01:42:56,212 --> 01:42:56,492
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura

1490
01:43:20,495 --> 01:43:30,937
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we do have, well, Xbox One, as far as headsets, they have to be wired and they're going to be sold separately.

1491
01:43:31,418 --> 01:43:32,778
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not going to be packed in.

1492
01:43:33,998 --> 01:43:43,680
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're basically saying that the only thing that you're getting with it is going to be the Kinect sensor and the microphone in there, but no actual headset.

1493
01:43:43,940 --> 01:43:46,481
[SPEAKER_11]: So, trying to screw us out of more money, huh?

1494
01:43:46,989 --> 01:43:52,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was sort of like that, though, at the launch with the Xbox 360, only the premium set had a headset.

1495
01:43:52,955 --> 01:43:54,297
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1496
01:43:55,856 --> 01:44:00,697
[SPEAKER_04]: They're basically saying that you can still talk to people, but you can't have a headset.

1497
01:44:00,757 --> 01:44:09,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, I don't like the standard headsets because I wear headphones, so you can't wear two sets of headphones at the same time.

1498
01:44:09,559 --> 01:44:10,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I've tried.

1499
01:44:11,260 --> 01:44:13,440
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, that's how I do it on my headset.

1500
01:44:13,900 --> 01:44:21,442
[SPEAKER_04]: I tape a headset that I ripped apart, and I just have the boom part of the microphone on there, and I tape it to the side of my...

1501
01:44:22,262 --> 01:44:23,102
[SPEAKER_04]: on my headphones.

1502
01:44:23,403 --> 01:44:24,183
[SPEAKER_04]: It works just fine.

1503
01:44:24,883 --> 01:44:28,165
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I could use Kinect, but then I'd be yelling across the room, so that wouldn't be fun.

1504
01:44:29,025 --> 01:44:33,027
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, in other news, and this has to do with the Wii U, the Super Smash Bros.

1505
01:44:34,267 --> 01:44:36,968
[SPEAKER_11]: release may actually lose some characters.

1506
01:44:37,389 --> 01:44:47,093
[SPEAKER_11]: They're saying that they're working on getting as many characters in it as they can, but they may not have the full intended roster, although they will have, of course, the Wii Fit trainer fighting you with yoga.

1507
01:44:48,414 --> 01:44:49,234
[SPEAKER_07]: I love her.

1508
01:44:51,132 --> 01:44:56,755
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, it's just like, if I knew that I could punch somebody with the warrior pose and have them go across the room, I'd be doing that more often.

1509
01:44:57,155 --> 01:45:00,797
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of those things I never realized how much I loved the idea until it was announced.

1510
01:45:00,857 --> 01:45:02,398
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, she should have been a character.

1511
01:45:02,418 --> 01:45:03,358
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the memes.

1512
01:45:03,418 --> 01:45:04,459
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you seen this already, cosplay?

1513
01:45:05,419 --> 01:45:25,750
[SPEAKER_07]: of the Wii Fit Trainer of the Wii Fit Trainer that's amazing and then of course the Villager and our Mega Man I almost wonder if we'll see something like not really like a Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom you know but like a DLC Ultimate Smash Ultimate Smash with like new characters or something

1514
01:45:27,023 --> 01:45:31,686
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, what they're saying here is that, I mean, the other big reason they may have to cut people is time constraints.

1515
01:45:32,066 --> 01:45:33,447
[SPEAKER_11]: So they won't be able to bring everyone back.

1516
01:45:33,487 --> 01:45:40,530
[SPEAKER_11]: But I mean, then again, there was like, what, Solid Snake before and Sonic and some Fire Emblem characters that no one cared about?

1517
01:45:40,650 --> 01:45:41,031
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

1518
01:45:42,512 --> 01:45:43,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Dan cared about.

1519
01:45:43,533 --> 01:45:44,674
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people care about.

1520
01:45:44,734 --> 01:45:45,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people will miss them.

1521
01:45:46,036 --> 01:45:53,305
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, I think some of those more like like I bet Captain Falcon will be in there with Roy and Mars or or no Star Fox will be in there.

1522
01:45:53,325 --> 01:45:56,649
[SPEAKER_06]: But like his little buddy, like Falco won't won't be there.

1523
01:45:57,299 --> 01:45:59,760
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be the more secondary characters in some of those games.

1524
01:46:00,140 --> 01:46:01,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Lucas from Earthbound.

1525
01:46:01,540 --> 01:46:02,640
[SPEAKER_06]: You mean like the palettes?

1526
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:05,561
[SPEAKER_06]: I know people who would probably throw a fit if Lucas wasn't there.

1527
01:46:05,681 --> 01:46:07,181
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll throw a fit if Ness isn't there.

1528
01:46:07,281 --> 01:46:07,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know what?

1529
01:46:07,821 --> 01:46:09,342
[SPEAKER_11]: People throw fits for any reason.

1530
01:46:09,702 --> 01:46:10,762
[SPEAKER_11]: Because gamers hate everything.

1531
01:46:10,842 --> 01:46:13,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe just get rid of the palette swap characters.

1532
01:46:13,762 --> 01:46:16,543
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the ones that are basically the same moveset and everything.

1533
01:46:16,603 --> 01:46:19,344
[SPEAKER_11]: As long as Zelda still has the chic transformation, I'll be happy.

1534
01:46:19,424 --> 01:46:19,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sure.

1535
01:46:20,104 --> 01:46:20,944
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a must.

1536
01:46:21,384 --> 01:46:25,745
[SPEAKER_11]: But they need to put Daisy in there and have the back of her head eye laser.

1537
01:46:27,467 --> 01:46:29,188
[SPEAKER_11]: You know about the eyeball in the back of her head, right?

1538
01:46:29,208 --> 01:46:30,028
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard about that, yeah.

1539
01:46:30,068 --> 01:46:39,351
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, in the original Smash Bros., if you look at the Daisy trophy, if you happen to scroll in super close to the back of her head, there's an eyeball in the back of her head.

1540
01:46:40,592 --> 01:46:43,933
[SPEAKER_11]: And so now it's like this thing that like, you know what Mugen is, right?

1541
01:46:44,853 --> 01:46:46,914
[SPEAKER_11]: The fighting game creator?

1542
01:46:47,154 --> 01:46:51,956
[SPEAKER_11]: So for people who put Daisy in Mugen, they actually gave her a back of her head eyeball laser.

1543
01:46:52,176 --> 01:46:52,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

1544
01:46:52,496 --> 01:46:54,917
[SPEAKER_11]: Which is the big, grandiose eyeball laser.

1545
01:46:56,970 --> 01:46:57,811
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's hilarious.

1546
01:46:57,851 --> 01:47:01,533
[SPEAKER_11]: And people have tried to say, oh, well, it's not there in Mario Kart.

1547
01:47:02,314 --> 01:47:02,914
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't matter.

1548
01:47:03,074 --> 01:47:05,456
[SPEAKER_11]: She has a great big eye on the back of her head like a tumor.

1549
01:47:05,676 --> 01:47:06,737
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why her hair is so big.

1550
01:47:06,777 --> 01:47:08,558
[SPEAKER_07]: It's full of secrets and eyeballs.

1551
01:47:08,858 --> 01:47:09,679
[SPEAKER_11]: It's full of secrets.

1552
01:47:10,199 --> 01:47:10,459
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

1553
01:47:10,479 --> 01:47:15,143
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to use that for anybody else, especially when my hair frizzes out into fro mode.

1554
01:47:15,623 --> 01:47:16,864
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just going to say it's full of secrets.

1555
01:47:17,824 --> 01:47:18,745
[SPEAKER_06]: You can thank Mean Girls.

1556
01:47:19,906 --> 01:47:20,206
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1557
01:47:20,766 --> 01:47:21,567
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I haven't seen that.

1558
01:47:22,227 --> 01:47:22,588
[SPEAKER_06]: You should.

1559
01:47:22,808 --> 01:47:23,028
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1560
01:47:23,048 --> 01:47:23,128
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1561
01:47:23,464 --> 01:47:24,865
[SPEAKER_11]: Doesn't it have Sarah Michelle Gellar in it?

1562
01:47:25,086 --> 01:47:28,589
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's Lindsay Lohan before she was on with the drugs.

1563
01:47:28,849 --> 01:47:30,551
[SPEAKER_06]: And Rachel McAdams, is that her name?

1564
01:47:30,731 --> 01:47:32,653
[SPEAKER_11]: What was the one that had Sarah Michelle Gellar in it?

1565
01:47:33,413 --> 01:47:33,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Buffy?

1566
01:47:33,934 --> 01:47:34,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Buffy?

1567
01:47:34,314 --> 01:47:36,076
[SPEAKER_11]: No, she was in another movie.

1568
01:47:36,096 --> 01:47:36,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Cruel Intentions.

1569
01:47:36,816 --> 01:47:38,118
[SPEAKER_11]: Cruel Intentions, that was it.

1570
01:47:38,778 --> 01:47:40,760
[SPEAKER_11]: That movie had a song that I liked, but I've never seen it either.

1571
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:43,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's the one where you can see Sarah Michelle going, but I wanna fuck.

1572
01:47:44,824 --> 01:47:45,064
Okay.

1573
01:47:48,187 --> 01:47:49,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Were you volunteering?

1574
01:47:51,963 --> 01:47:53,544
[SPEAKER_11]: Sarah Michelle Gellar is an attractive lady.

1575
01:47:53,584 --> 01:47:55,165
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're Freddie Prinze Jr., then yes.

1576
01:47:56,426 --> 01:47:58,387
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyway, you know what, though?

1577
01:47:58,407 --> 01:48:02,109
[SPEAKER_11]: She does not look as attractive as she did on Buffy because she's all bone thin again now.

1578
01:48:02,729 --> 01:48:04,530
[SPEAKER_11]: And not, you know, in good shape.

1579
01:48:05,371 --> 01:48:05,931
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyway, okay.

1580
01:48:06,271 --> 01:48:10,033
[SPEAKER_11]: Former King of Fighters developers are having some issues.

1581
01:48:10,874 --> 01:48:16,437
[SPEAKER_11]: They were basically... They have an original 2D fighting game that they were...

1582
01:48:18,254 --> 01:48:20,335
[SPEAKER_11]: Looking to have some development on.

1583
01:48:20,435 --> 01:48:33,583
[SPEAKER_11]: It says that right now, and the game is called Yatagarasu, that they want to have it crowdfunded so that they can release the character in the game, and they're wanting it to be 10 playable characters at launch.

1584
01:48:33,963 --> 01:48:39,506
[SPEAKER_11]: They have a funding goal of $68,000 right now, and it's on Indiegogo, and it can go up if it needs to be.

1585
01:48:41,847 --> 01:48:44,889
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's not sucky like The King of Fighters 12 was, then go for it.

1586
01:48:47,283 --> 01:48:49,305
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I guess that does it for Rapid Fire News.

1587
01:48:49,385 --> 01:48:52,068
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a little opinionated when it comes to bad King of Fighters games, Rob.

1588
01:48:52,268 --> 01:48:52,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you?

1589
01:48:52,768 --> 01:48:53,509
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have never guessed.

1590
01:48:53,709 --> 01:48:54,150
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

1591
01:48:54,390 --> 01:48:58,353
[SPEAKER_06]: I figured it was appropriate, though, considering you just did a King of Fighters, or, well, sorta.

1592
01:48:58,654 --> 01:48:58,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorta.

1593
01:48:59,014 --> 01:48:59,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Fatal Fury.

1594
01:48:59,715 --> 01:49:01,416
[SPEAKER_06]: King of Fighters prequel-ish.

1595
01:49:01,716 --> 01:49:03,858
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm going to do Art of Fighting next week, ew.

1596
01:49:04,038 --> 01:49:04,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you really?

1597
01:49:04,679 --> 01:49:04,839
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1598
01:49:06,240 --> 01:49:07,622
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to do World Heroes Jet.

1599
01:49:07,762 --> 01:49:10,144
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know what I'm going to do is the Fugle Question of the Week right now.

1600
01:49:10,484 --> 01:49:12,186
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Radio Fugle.

1601
01:49:17,403 --> 01:49:22,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Take Facebook and Google+, slam them together, and you get one clusterfuck of a social networking site.

1602
01:49:22,844 --> 01:49:30,806
[SPEAKER_06]: You also get the word foogle, which we ask a question every week of our Facebook and Google fan communities, and we read some of the answers here on the show.

1603
01:49:30,986 --> 01:49:32,106
[SPEAKER_06]: I might read them all tonight.

1604
01:49:32,146 --> 01:49:32,946
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see how I'm feeling.

1605
01:49:32,966 --> 01:49:33,406
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't looked.

1606
01:49:33,446 --> 01:49:34,426
[SPEAKER_06]: How many are on Facebook?

1607
01:49:36,227 --> 01:49:37,147
[SPEAKER_06]: There's not a ton.

1608
01:49:37,567 --> 01:49:38,847
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I can probably get through them all tonight.

1609
01:49:38,867 --> 01:49:39,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.

1610
01:49:40,207 --> 01:49:42,468
[SPEAKER_06]: The Ouya officially hit shelves this week.

1611
01:49:43,376 --> 01:49:44,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you get one?

1612
01:49:44,677 --> 01:49:45,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Why or why not?

1613
01:49:45,958 --> 01:49:54,243
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think about these mobile platform consoles, especially considering there are more to come, such as Mojo and the rumors of an official Google Android console?

1614
01:49:54,703 --> 01:49:55,344
[SPEAKER_06]: And GameSick.

1615
01:49:56,224 --> 01:49:57,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, I said and more.

1616
01:49:58,266 --> 01:50:06,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, Red Entertainment says, unless the Ouya is something that'll make it so it's not so damn fucking hot outside, I will not be buying one right now.

1617
01:50:06,391 --> 01:50:10,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I'll buy an Ouya in the future when the outside world is not trying to cook me alive.

1618
01:50:10,556 --> 01:50:12,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, to be fair... That answer wins.

1619
01:50:12,598 --> 01:50:12,999
[SPEAKER_06]: We're done.

1620
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:21,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, to be fair, one thing I do like about the Ouya controller is the face plates are made of metal, and so they're nice and cool on your hands.

1621
01:50:23,592 --> 01:50:24,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, fine.

1622
01:50:24,173 --> 01:50:25,414
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll read other answers then.

1623
01:50:25,994 --> 01:50:29,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so moving to Evil, E3VL.

1624
01:50:29,657 --> 01:50:32,279
[SPEAKER_06]: No, unless I see more exclusive content for the system.

1625
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:41,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, the Ouya seems to have had bad customer service as of late, having shipped their console to retailers before providing all their Kickstarter backers with one first.

1626
01:50:42,287 --> 01:50:47,151
[SPEAKER_06]: At least provide the backers with some store credit or free games instead of just apologizing.

1627
01:50:47,712 --> 01:50:47,892
Excellent.

1628
01:50:48,232 --> 01:50:49,454
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get into that in a little bit.

1629
01:50:49,474 --> 01:50:52,017
[SPEAKER_04]: We're definitely going to be getting into that in a little bit.

1630
01:50:52,197 --> 01:50:59,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Nietzsche says, Between the reports of horrible controller input lag and poor performance due to outdated hardware, I have no desire to get the Ouya.

1631
01:50:59,686 --> 01:51:02,429
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a fun idea, but in my opinion, didn't work out.

1632
01:51:03,270 --> 01:51:09,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Travis H says, Asus transformer tablet plus HDMI cable equals an Ouya I can take on the go.

1633
01:51:09,616 --> 01:51:14,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, the only thing that I think that piqued my interest about the Ouya is having a system to throw emulators on.

1634
01:51:15,301 --> 01:51:17,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of like an all-in-one super nostalgia machine.

1635
01:51:17,864 --> 01:51:19,945
[SPEAKER_06]: But I already have that with my tablet, so I'm out.

1636
01:51:20,686 --> 01:51:22,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, lots of hate for the Ouya on Google+.

1637
01:51:22,887 --> 01:51:24,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see if Facebook's any different.

1638
01:51:24,688 --> 01:51:26,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Gally89 says, Nope, I don't see the need.

1639
01:51:26,890 --> 01:51:28,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Juan, not for me at least.

1640
01:51:28,711 --> 01:51:31,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Daniel S says, Everything I hear about the Ouya is that it's a piece of crap.

1641
01:51:32,273 --> 01:51:37,656
[SPEAKER_06]: And putting more Android-based platforms is exactly what they need because market confusion and dilution is great.

1642
01:51:38,396 --> 01:51:40,117
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's a slash Sark in there.

1643
01:51:40,797 --> 01:51:46,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Clover Nikon says, My wife and I enjoy playing games on our Google Nexus 7-inch Android Jelly Bean tablet.

1644
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:52,803
[SPEAKER_06]: My wife playing Simpsons Tap Game, I play Star Wars Pinball, and my father-in-law playing those Pokey Magic slot machine games when he borrows it.

1645
01:51:53,223 --> 01:51:56,725
[SPEAKER_06]: If a shop here near me sold the Ouya, I would definitely buy one.

1646
01:51:57,345 --> 01:51:57,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there you go.

1647
01:51:58,146 --> 01:52:00,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Finally, an answer we can say is a positive one.

1648
01:52:01,407 --> 01:52:02,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Degenerate Johnny says,

1649
01:52:03,641 --> 01:52:07,803
[SPEAKER_06]: says, it all seems oxymoronish to have a stationary platform for mobile games.

1650
01:52:08,224 --> 01:52:11,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, I don't very much care for mobile games, 3DS and Vita excluded.

1651
01:52:12,086 --> 01:52:16,028
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't offer the same amount of excitement and enjoyment that the big three consoles offer.

1652
01:52:16,348 --> 01:52:25,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Console developers, including Valve, should take a lesson from the auto industry, and this is my Michigan side talking, there can be only three, and that's currently Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft.

1653
01:52:26,194 --> 01:52:32,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, you are doomed to walk the unfortunate path of the 3DO, Jaguar, and God rest its soul, the Dreamcast.

1654
01:52:32,818 --> 01:52:32,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Aww.

1655
01:52:33,498 --> 01:52:35,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Aw, that answer made me sad.

1656
01:52:35,819 --> 01:52:41,560
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but the difference between the 3DO and the Jaguar and the Dreamcast is that the Dreamcast wasn't shit.

1657
01:52:42,740 --> 01:52:43,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Word.

1658
01:52:44,061 --> 01:52:51,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, the 80s called and would like to tell you that there is room for more than three consoles, although then again it might lead to another crash.

1659
01:52:51,203 --> 01:52:54,363
[SPEAKER_06]: We had the whole home computing wars, but that's another episode of the show.

1660
01:52:54,763 --> 01:52:56,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, we talked about that a lot last week.

1661
01:52:56,564 --> 01:53:00,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, ClericalEra404 left a pretty long answer here, but...

1662
01:53:00,965 --> 01:53:02,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Since I like them, I'll read it.

1663
01:53:03,306 --> 01:53:04,286
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I did not get one.

1664
01:53:04,466 --> 01:53:17,110
[SPEAKER_06]: It has clever ideas, offering digital copies of games to first demo and then decide to upgrade to the full version, having an easy setup of plugging in an HDMI cable, a library of 200 games and counting, being able to run emulators to play games from older systems.

1665
01:53:17,470 --> 01:53:19,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Almost a retro gamer's dream come true.

1666
01:53:19,470 --> 01:53:22,551
[SPEAKER_06]: But the old saying is true that a system is only as good as the software.

1667
01:53:22,851 --> 01:53:28,553
[SPEAKER_06]: And unfortunately, so far, it has been able to really wow... I'm thinking it hasn't been able to really wow anyone yet.

1668
01:53:29,273 --> 01:53:29,453
[SPEAKER_06]: and more.

1669
01:53:50,777 --> 01:53:53,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Code Man says, no, I don't have a justification for buying one.

1670
01:53:54,019 --> 01:53:57,881
[SPEAKER_06]: It would just make my wife more addicted to Candy Crush, and I definitely don't need that.

1671
01:53:58,062 --> 01:53:58,462
[SPEAKER_06]: LOL.

1672
01:53:59,042 --> 01:54:01,744
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so much confusion with the platform, I think.

1673
01:54:02,524 --> 01:54:05,406
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's no Candy Crush on it, thank God.

1674
01:54:05,966 --> 01:54:07,527
[SPEAKER_04]: First off, okay, so what?

1675
01:54:07,547 --> 01:54:08,768
[SPEAKER_04]: The console runs Android.

1676
01:54:08,828 --> 01:54:10,709
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't make it a fucking mobile console.

1677
01:54:10,930 --> 01:54:11,030
[SPEAKER_04]: It's...

1678
01:54:11,790 --> 01:54:12,210
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not.

1679
01:54:12,330 --> 01:54:14,851
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an operating system that runs Android.

1680
01:54:15,151 --> 01:54:17,992
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like Android runs on some of those smart TVs.

1681
01:54:18,032 --> 01:54:20,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it mean your TV is a fucking mobile console?

1682
01:54:20,793 --> 01:54:21,493
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not.

1683
01:54:21,553 --> 01:54:22,354
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a TV.

1684
01:54:22,954 --> 01:54:26,095
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just an operating system that you're developing games for.

1685
01:54:26,195 --> 01:54:36,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, a lot of the first games that are coming over are going to be ports of games that are on the Android marketplace because you're porting an Android game to Android with some additional APKs in there.

1686
01:54:36,598 --> 01:54:38,119
[SPEAKER_04]: So, of course, it's going to be like that.

1687
01:54:38,620 --> 01:54:39,884
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's the thing.

1688
01:54:40,125 --> 01:54:42,393
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole draw of this console is that it's an indie console.

1689
01:54:43,024 --> 01:54:58,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I'm not saying that there's everything that's positive about it, because yes, there's issues with the controller being, well, especially the first backer controllers, which I'm going through an issue right now where I'm trying to get mine replaced, because the analog sticks don't work correctly.

1690
01:54:59,698 --> 01:55:00,939
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's on Ouya.

1691
01:55:01,200 --> 01:55:02,521
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to fix that shit.

1692
01:55:02,781 --> 01:55:09,006
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, since we're getting into some topic about, you know, Ouya...

1693
01:55:09,827 --> 01:55:11,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, can I read the rest of the answers here?

1694
01:55:11,630 --> 01:55:11,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, go ahead.

1695
01:55:11,930 --> 01:55:12,731
[SPEAKER_04]: You still want to yell at people.

1696
01:55:12,751 --> 01:55:13,292
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, go ahead.

1697
01:55:13,312 --> 01:55:14,654
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll save that for a second.

1698
01:55:14,674 --> 01:55:14,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1699
01:55:15,235 --> 01:55:22,124
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkCharger says, I have a main cabinet for my emulation needs and everything else that I want can be handled by my consoles or smartphones and tablets.

1700
01:55:22,545 --> 01:55:26,390
[SPEAKER_06]: An Ouya would be the epitome of a superfluous purchase.

1701
01:55:27,431 --> 01:55:52,309
[SPEAKER_06]: AZHP says I didn't get one because I didn't realize it came out this week if there's no advertising how can I know when it's coming out I might pick one up soon for emulation purposes though and lastly Osfer says I'm just not interested the new consoles from the big three are the only ones that really have my attention that's all the answers from Facebook and Google thanks to y'all for answering join us on Facebook and Google Plus for next week's question alright slide kick you gonna get a new yeah

1702
01:55:52,769 --> 01:55:56,230
[SPEAKER_07]: I was actually a very early backer.

1703
01:55:57,551 --> 01:56:03,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, if I saw how it played out, I don't think I would have backed them.

1704
01:56:04,313 --> 01:56:07,274
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1705
01:56:07,434 --> 01:56:12,075
[SPEAKER_07]: You heard about all the mess with E3 and how rude they were.

1706
01:56:12,715 --> 01:56:13,195
[SPEAKER_06]: I was there.

1707
01:56:13,596 --> 01:56:16,076
[SPEAKER_06]: I took a picture of the big truck parked in front of the booth.

1708
01:56:16,917 --> 01:56:21,078
[SPEAKER_06]: The Ouya thing at E3 was more of a developer showcase than it was the console.

1709
01:56:21,718 --> 01:56:22,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1710
01:56:22,058 --> 01:56:22,539
[SPEAKER_06]: It's too bad.

1711
01:56:40,228 --> 01:56:41,849
[SPEAKER_07]: It's better than last year's Yu-Gi-Oh!

1712
01:56:41,909 --> 01:56:46,492
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, you know, I just don't know if that's a good precedent to set for gaming consoles.

1713
01:56:46,992 --> 01:56:54,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though it's not directly trying to compete with the big three, but, you know, I just, I don't...

1714
01:56:55,877 --> 01:56:56,317
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1715
01:56:56,737 --> 01:57:02,099
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually, mine did arrive, and I've yet to unbox it, so I probably should at some point.

1716
01:57:02,119 --> 01:57:02,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wow.

1717
01:57:03,279 --> 01:57:08,941
[SPEAKER_07]: But Captain Spike also backed on Kickstarter before I did, and he hasn't received it yet.

1718
01:57:09,201 --> 01:57:09,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god.

1719
01:57:10,921 --> 01:57:13,582
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'll hook mine up eventually.

1720
01:57:13,622 --> 01:57:15,622
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope that I don't have any controller issues.

1721
01:57:16,203 --> 01:57:17,223
[SPEAKER_07]: When did yours arrive?

1722
01:57:17,952 --> 01:57:21,997
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it arrived in late April or May.

1723
01:57:22,017 --> 01:57:23,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, your controller's fucked.

1724
01:57:23,499 --> 01:57:25,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

1725
01:57:25,141 --> 01:57:27,124
[SPEAKER_04]: It was late May is when they fixed that shit.

1726
01:57:28,586 --> 01:57:30,608
[SPEAKER_06]: See, I didn't back this for that reason.

1727
01:57:30,628 --> 01:57:31,830
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's all fixed now.

1728
01:57:31,990 --> 01:57:32,771
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fixed now.

1729
01:57:32,791 --> 01:57:33,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but not for you.

1730
01:57:33,973 --> 01:57:34,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Well...

1731
01:57:35,194 --> 01:57:37,116
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fixed if I don't use the NUYA controller.

1732
01:57:37,156 --> 01:57:45,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank God I can pair a PlayStation 3 controller to it, but the only thing is, not all games, you have to account for that, so they have to program in those button mappings as well.

1733
01:57:46,285 --> 01:57:50,529
[SPEAKER_04]: I can, you know, for a lot of things, like emulators, I can play with the PlayStation 3 controller and it works great.

1734
01:57:50,749 --> 01:57:53,592
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how I knew it was the controller, not the console.

1735
01:57:54,253 --> 01:57:54,433
[SPEAKER_04]: You know,

1736
01:57:56,113 --> 01:57:57,454
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna get into it in just a second.

1737
01:57:58,815 --> 01:57:59,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the customer service things.

1738
01:57:59,856 --> 01:58:00,457
[SPEAKER_04]: It's ridiculous.

1739
01:58:00,557 --> 01:58:02,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if... Why don't we go back into the gaming news?

1740
01:58:03,039 --> 01:58:05,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, why don't you start us off with a possibly related topic?

1741
01:58:05,521 --> 01:58:06,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about this.

1742
01:58:06,381 --> 01:58:06,882
[SPEAKER_04]: This is great.

1743
01:58:06,902 --> 01:58:07,642
[SPEAKER_04]: This is fantastic.

1744
01:58:07,682 --> 01:58:10,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Right when they launched, there was two Kickstarter updates.

1745
01:58:11,025 --> 01:58:12,246
[SPEAKER_04]: First there was one like, Hey!

1746
01:58:12,306 --> 01:58:13,687
[SPEAKER_04]: We launched our console!

1747
01:58:14,067 --> 01:58:15,949
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we couldn't have done it without you.

1748
01:58:16,249 --> 01:58:18,511
[SPEAKER_04]: To which there was a bunch of replies, Hey, you fucktard!

1749
01:58:18,551 --> 01:58:21,633
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't gotten my fucking console yet that I backed last year.

1750
01:58:21,734 --> 01:58:22,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Where the fuck is it?

1751
01:58:22,975 --> 01:58:23,235
[SPEAKER_04]: And then...

1752
01:58:23,775 --> 01:58:26,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Julie comes out and says, I'm pissed!

1753
01:58:26,937 --> 01:58:31,339
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so pissed that we haven't been able to get some of those consoles to you.

1754
01:58:31,719 --> 01:58:36,101
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I promised that we'd ship them all, and I don't know what's going on.

1755
01:58:36,121 --> 01:58:39,323
[SPEAKER_04]: We have people in, you know, Hong Kong that are checking into it and stuff.

1756
01:58:39,543 --> 01:58:40,683
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you what's going on.

1757
01:58:40,723 --> 01:58:43,185
[SPEAKER_04]: You shipped it via fucking DHL.

1758
01:58:43,785 --> 01:58:47,647
[SPEAKER_04]: DHL Global, first off, so slow-ass ship...

1759
01:58:48,737 --> 01:58:58,305
[SPEAKER_04]: in the first place, and then you had to pass off to, because it was their global logistics mail or something like that, where they pass it off to the U.S.

1760
01:58:58,385 --> 01:58:59,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Postal Service.

1761
01:59:00,227 --> 01:59:02,089
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes so fucking long.

1762
01:59:02,409 --> 01:59:04,251
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't know what the hell was going on.

1763
01:59:04,331 --> 01:59:06,993
[SPEAKER_04]: It basically said, oh, yeah, you're going to get an update on your tracking number.

1764
01:59:07,013 --> 01:59:09,195
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll become active within a couple days.

1765
01:59:09,595 --> 01:59:10,836
[SPEAKER_04]: It took a week.

1766
01:59:11,096 --> 01:59:12,718
[SPEAKER_07]: My tracking number was never active.

1767
01:59:12,798 --> 01:59:13,879
[SPEAKER_07]: It just showed up one day.

1768
01:59:14,246 --> 01:59:16,286
[SPEAKER_04]: You were lucky if that thing showed up in the first place.

1769
01:59:16,567 --> 01:59:23,008
[SPEAKER_04]: And then on top of all that, you had the issues where you were getting bummed controllers with the earlier backer additions, which I did.

1770
01:59:23,808 --> 01:59:26,389
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's annoying because it doesn't work correctly.

1771
01:59:26,649 --> 01:59:28,009
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I replied.

1772
01:59:28,309 --> 01:59:30,010
[SPEAKER_04]: I sent a ticket for it.

1773
01:59:30,050 --> 01:59:32,250
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, hey, I need this shit fixed.

1774
01:59:32,770 --> 01:59:33,851
[SPEAKER_04]: So I sent them a ticket.

1775
01:59:34,691 --> 01:59:39,252
[SPEAKER_04]: And I understand that they're a little busy with their console launch and stuff like that.

1776
01:59:39,372 --> 01:59:40,472
[SPEAKER_04]: I sent it on Tuesday.

1777
01:59:40,773 --> 01:59:42,133
[SPEAKER_04]: They got back to me today.

1778
01:59:42,993 --> 01:59:44,574
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's what their response was.

1779
01:59:44,694 --> 01:59:51,297
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, as we continue to evolve the OUYA, making constant improvements to our product and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1780
01:59:51,417 --> 01:59:54,558
[SPEAKER_04]: You got a copy-paste from an outsourced customer service company.

1781
01:59:54,598 --> 01:59:55,058
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet anything.

1782
01:59:55,098 --> 01:59:56,278
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not even outsourced.

1783
01:59:56,639 --> 01:59:57,479
[SPEAKER_04]: It took so long.

1784
01:59:57,999 --> 02:00:04,121
[SPEAKER_04]: And basically saying, you know, the goal is you should look into the fact and see if you can solve your problem there.

1785
02:00:04,141 --> 02:00:06,042
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I have a fucking defective controller.

1786
02:00:06,082 --> 02:00:07,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Your fact doesn't help me there.

1787
02:00:08,263 --> 02:00:09,424
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't say anything.

1788
02:00:10,044 --> 02:00:11,905
[SPEAKER_04]: So I sent a reply.

1789
02:00:11,925 --> 02:00:13,986
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, listen, I have a defective controller.

1790
02:00:14,006 --> 02:00:14,967
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to replace this shit.

1791
02:00:15,387 --> 02:00:17,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you know what's going to happen if I can't get it replaced?

1792
02:00:17,728 --> 02:00:18,929
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go to the store.

1793
02:00:19,449 --> 02:00:20,590
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to buy a controller.

1794
02:00:21,290 --> 02:00:22,811
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to replace it with my controller.

1795
02:00:23,051 --> 02:00:23,872
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to return it.

1796
02:00:24,452 --> 02:00:25,713
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good idea.

1797
02:00:26,333 --> 02:00:27,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, shame on you.

1798
02:00:27,914 --> 02:00:28,895
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's kind of...

1799
02:00:29,915 --> 02:00:30,816
[SPEAKER_06]: It's clever.

1800
02:00:30,976 --> 02:00:32,637
[SPEAKER_06]: I should not be supporting that.

1801
02:00:32,657 --> 02:00:35,740
[SPEAKER_07]: I did something similar to that, but not really.

1802
02:00:36,740 --> 02:00:49,150
[SPEAKER_07]: When Sonic Spinball came out, I got it for full price, and then Target had it for like $5 or $7 less, so I bought it at Target and returned it to Toys R Us.

1803
02:00:50,131 --> 02:00:58,918
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, it's not really like repackaging it, but I was like 10, and I felt like, ooh, what if they find out that this is actually from Toys R Us?

1804
02:00:59,318 --> 02:01:00,318
[SPEAKER_04]: and Defective Allowments.

1805
02:01:00,678 --> 02:01:01,379
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all right.

1806
02:01:01,419 --> 02:01:20,563
[SPEAKER_04]: They're used to Defectives, but seriously, if they're not going to solve my problem because they're claiming that they're too busy right now, well, I'm sorry, but it's going to be hard for me to continue supporting your console if you're not going to give me a controller that fucking works since I only have one controller anyways and your additional controller is $60 fucking dollars.

1807
02:01:20,763 --> 02:01:21,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope, not going to buy those.

1808
02:01:22,404 --> 02:01:22,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1809
02:01:24,284 --> 02:01:28,027
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're saying most of the cost of the system is the one controller that doesn't work?

1810
02:01:28,687 --> 02:01:29,388
[SPEAKER_04]: That's their claim.

1811
02:01:29,428 --> 02:01:30,228
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the thing.

1812
02:01:30,308 --> 02:01:34,991
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like I don't understand why the whole thing was a clusterfuck to begin with.

1813
02:01:35,392 --> 02:01:36,312
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know it's going to get better.

1814
02:01:36,352 --> 02:01:38,293
[SPEAKER_04]: And I actually haven't touched my console since May.

1815
02:01:38,614 --> 02:01:40,555
[SPEAKER_04]: I did loan it to a friend, a co-worker.

1816
02:01:40,595 --> 02:01:43,437
[SPEAKER_04]: He wanted to check it out for stuff, and so he did my updates and everything.

1817
02:01:43,877 --> 02:01:45,778
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess the interface is a lot nicer now.

1818
02:01:45,838 --> 02:01:49,581
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot of the things that they promised, obviously, they didn't come through with.

1819
02:01:50,021 --> 02:01:52,843
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the major ones, this console can be easily rooted.

1820
02:01:54,925 --> 02:01:56,786
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to be able to root it immediately once you get it.

1821
02:01:58,027 --> 02:01:58,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't do that.

1822
02:01:59,068 --> 02:01:59,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't do that at all.

1823
02:02:00,650 --> 02:02:02,111
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very hacker friendly.

1824
02:02:02,551 --> 02:02:03,232
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not.

1825
02:02:03,412 --> 02:02:04,393
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not hacker friendly.

1826
02:02:04,753 --> 02:02:06,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Aside from the fact that you can sideload.

1827
02:02:06,515 --> 02:02:09,838
[SPEAKER_10]: Why not channel this energy into a complaint with the Better Business Bureau?

1828
02:02:10,905 --> 02:02:12,266
[SPEAKER_11]: Because they're not going to do anything.

1829
02:02:12,587 --> 02:02:12,827
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1830
02:02:14,088 --> 02:02:20,714
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not that whether they do something or not, it's still going to hurt their reputation and prevent them from being able to do business.

1831
02:02:20,734 --> 02:02:23,357
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure there's tons of people who have already done that just for their backers.

1832
02:02:23,377 --> 02:02:24,498
[SPEAKER_11]: Or is that just an excuse not to do it?

1833
02:02:25,398 --> 02:02:27,200
[SPEAKER_04]: It is an excuse not to do it because I just don't care.

1834
02:02:27,360 --> 02:02:28,401
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care enough.

1835
02:02:28,621 --> 02:02:31,504
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like I dropped a ton of money.

1836
02:02:31,544 --> 02:02:33,666
[SPEAKER_04]: It was $100 a year ago, and I just don't care.

1837
02:02:34,827 --> 02:02:37,751
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's why companies get away with this because people don't care.

1838
02:02:37,811 --> 02:02:38,633
[SPEAKER_04]: He wants to internet rage.

1839
02:02:38,873 --> 02:02:41,517
[SPEAKER_04]: I want my controller to work and that's it.

1840
02:02:41,597 --> 02:02:42,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Then that's fine.

1841
02:02:42,758 --> 02:02:48,366
[SPEAKER_11]: So write them about it and tell them you're going to file a complaint and see how long it takes them to reply because trust me, they will reply.

1842
02:02:48,487 --> 02:02:49,107
[SPEAKER_04]: They won't reply.

1843
02:02:50,509 --> 02:02:50,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

1844
02:02:51,010 --> 02:03:01,454
[SPEAKER_11]: The moment you bring up the three, you know, the Better Business Bureau, especially for any company that wants to continue to do business, they tend to jump on that, especially if they've got other people doing the same.

1845
02:03:01,474 --> 02:03:01,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, fine.

1846
02:03:01,894 --> 02:03:08,016
[SPEAKER_04]: The next time I send them an update, I'll say I'll contact the Better Business Bureau and we'll see them do nothing because, you know.

1847
02:03:08,556 --> 02:03:11,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me read some of the written word in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

1848
02:03:11,797 --> 02:03:16,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Burr says, even the positive reviews are like, I like mine, but I haven't bought a game for it yet.

1849
02:03:16,679 --> 02:03:17,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Just played the demos.

1850
02:03:18,200 --> 02:03:25,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, a lot of the games on there are free to play right now, and everything has a free version of it, so yeah, a lot of it you don't need to necessarily buy.

1851
02:03:26,332 --> 02:03:29,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Codeman says this is just a huge shit on the people who backed.

1852
02:03:31,491 --> 02:03:45,519
[SPEAKER_04]: It is really inexcusable that they, you know, they got limited supply of the stores because they wanted to make sure they had that retail presence or whatever, but at the same time, they made a promise to everyone that backed them to, you know, deliver on that.

1853
02:03:45,559 --> 02:03:58,167
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they can't deliver to, you know, people that ordered their console, I'm sorry, backed their Kickstarter and got a free console, however the fuck you want to word that, because you're not technically ordering anything, but, you know, whatever.

1854
02:03:59,528 --> 02:04:02,750
[SPEAKER_04]: They made a promise and they couldn't even fulfill that.

1855
02:04:02,810 --> 02:04:05,932
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't give any firm numbers to what was shipping.

1856
02:04:05,972 --> 02:04:09,075
[SPEAKER_04]: They just did this really generic line graph thing.

1857
02:04:09,615 --> 02:04:14,779
[SPEAKER_04]: At a point at the beginning of June or something, they were like, all the consoles have shipped.

1858
02:04:15,439 --> 02:04:15,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?

1859
02:04:15,759 --> 02:04:18,401
[SPEAKER_04]: They've all shipped because no one's gotten them yet.

1860
02:04:19,442 --> 02:04:22,383
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, it was really weird.

1861
02:04:23,764 --> 02:04:28,067
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of curious to see what it's going to look like in three months' time.

1862
02:04:28,687 --> 02:04:33,830
[SPEAKER_04]: If they're going to follow through with everything they promised about this console.

1863
02:04:33,850 --> 02:04:34,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Because right now...

1864
02:04:35,171 --> 02:04:35,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1865
02:04:53,096 --> 02:04:54,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, I gotta move on.

1866
02:04:55,158 --> 02:04:58,641
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure Loki could do an entire episode just about his hatred towards this whole thing.

1867
02:04:59,381 --> 02:05:00,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Lesson learned.

1868
02:05:00,622 --> 02:05:02,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you back another console after what happened to this?

1869
02:05:03,204 --> 02:05:10,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I would, but it would have to be a lot more research done into it.

1870
02:05:11,111 --> 02:05:11,932
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how I feel, too.

1871
02:05:11,972 --> 02:05:17,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that Google's gonna put a Kickstarter out there for a console, but it would have to be like if...

1872
02:05:19,998 --> 02:05:21,540
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be different.

1873
02:05:22,301 --> 02:05:27,206
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a different console that I keep seeing that they're trying to pitch.

1874
02:05:27,266 --> 02:05:31,650
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy is kind of doing this, oh, it can do everything and stuff that you can't imagine.

1875
02:05:31,690 --> 02:05:32,271
[SPEAKER_04]: It's amazing.

1876
02:05:32,631 --> 02:05:37,356
[SPEAKER_04]: The Oton or whatever, it's like this autonomous console is basically supposed to procedurally generate games.

1877
02:05:38,597 --> 02:06:05,940
[SPEAKER_04]: and that sounds neat I guess but it's just like the stuff that he's promising is ridiculous and so like it's just like yeah I'm not gonna back in any of this but he's planning on doing a Kickstarter so you'll probably see that at some point because he tried to get in unfortunately it was we got in and then they started requiring that anything that's electronics or something like that has to have an actual prototype a physical prototype made not just a concept so that's a problem

1878
02:06:06,620 --> 02:06:11,401
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I would be reluctant to spend as much on Kickstarter anymore.

1879
02:06:11,842 --> 02:06:23,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually I just put in about $15 to $20 for a game or something, but that was the first big Kickstarter amount that I put in, and I don't think I'd be as likely to do it anymore.

1880
02:06:24,625 --> 02:06:25,826
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, let's move on.

1881
02:06:26,927 --> 02:06:38,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of people who aren't likely to do certain things anymore, Bethesda, the vice president of PR and marketing, Pete Hines, in an interesting statement with, I believe it was Eurogamer, talking about, quote, We don't have Facebook stuff.

1882
02:06:38,977 --> 02:06:40,538
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have mobile stuff.

1883
02:06:40,618 --> 02:06:43,381
[SPEAKER_06]: We feel like we really know who we are and what we're good at.

1884
02:06:43,461 --> 02:06:45,963
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, you don't see Skyrim mobile or anything like that.

1885
02:06:46,583 --> 02:06:50,604
[SPEAKER_06]: A while ago it was social games that were all the rage and people were asking, why aren't we doing Facebook?

1886
02:06:50,884 --> 02:06:53,445
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not what we do and that's no longer a big deal.

1887
02:06:53,565 --> 02:06:55,885
[SPEAKER_06]: So we didn't run after it and now we're not running away from it.

1888
02:06:56,166 --> 02:06:58,366
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just going to kind of stick to what we feel is best.

1889
02:06:59,146 --> 02:07:02,567
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, it doesn't just extend to Facebook and mobile.

1890
02:07:02,987 --> 02:07:08,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Quote, we have nothing announced in development for Wii U. It's not something we've done anything for previously.

1891
02:07:08,989 --> 02:07:11,690
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even remember the last time we've done a Nintendo title.

1892
02:07:11,950 --> 02:07:12,270
[SPEAKER_06]: I do.

1893
02:07:12,650 --> 02:07:13,110
[SPEAKER_06]: What was it?

1894
02:07:13,590 --> 02:07:15,411
[SPEAKER_04]: It was Brunswick Bowling.

1895
02:07:16,111 --> 02:07:17,031
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm serious.

1896
02:07:17,051 --> 02:07:17,851
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it was.

1897
02:07:18,272 --> 02:07:19,232
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have anything.

1898
02:07:19,252 --> 02:07:23,313
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was just everybody trying to run off of the popularity of Wii Sports, of which bowling was huge.

1899
02:07:23,353 --> 02:07:23,733
[SPEAKER_04]: It was.

1900
02:07:24,554 --> 02:07:28,155
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have anything now whether or not we would in the future is to be determined.

1901
02:07:28,415 --> 02:07:31,276
[SPEAKER_06]: As for why, I guess I'd rather not go into that.

1902
02:07:33,090 --> 02:07:37,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well, shit, now we all have to sit here and make it up, because he won't go into it.

1903
02:07:37,858 --> 02:07:42,966
[SPEAKER_06]: So, what it is just that the Wii U is a... They don't believe in it?

1904
02:07:43,286 --> 02:07:46,171
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't think something like Skyrim is capable of running on Wii U?

1905
02:07:46,884 --> 02:07:50,888
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's just, once again, it's cost-risk type thing.

1906
02:07:51,309 --> 02:08:03,821
[SPEAKER_04]: The cost it's going to take to develop a game or port a game over to that platform versus the amount of money you're going to make with the limited marketplace for it right now because there's just not a lot of people that bought the console.

1907
02:08:04,121 --> 02:08:05,283
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's going to change.

1908
02:08:05,303 --> 02:08:09,226
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to hear a lot of people more willing to develop for it when there's more people that bought the console.

1909
02:08:09,987 --> 02:08:28,338
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's going to take another year or so with some of these first party games to kind of drive some console sales to get more third parties involved, but if it doesn't work, if the third parties, or I should say the first party games don't drive enough console sales, then yeah, you're going to hear a lot more of this.

1910
02:08:28,699 --> 02:08:35,543
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's a huge loss because, I mean, what, there hasn't really been a Bethesda game, like I said, since Brunswick Bowling, so it's not like

1911
02:08:37,728 --> 02:08:38,688
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1912
02:08:56,434 --> 02:09:01,538
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I do, and I found it on Game Politics, which I love Game Politics.

1913
02:09:02,539 --> 02:09:09,164
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to see what goes on in the world around video games, it doesn't necessarily have to do with release dates, then that's the place to go.

1914
02:09:10,064 --> 02:09:21,193
[SPEAKER_11]: But there was a conservative political website called The Daily Caller that said that a Texas teenager was making a joke while playing League of Legends.

1915
02:09:21,993 --> 02:09:39,381
[SPEAKER_11]: and the joke was and I'm going to quote oh yeah I'm real messed up in the head I'm going to shoot up a school full of kids and eat their still beating hearts followed by a JK and lol well there were people who took this seriously actually a Canadian lady

1916
02:09:39,861 --> 02:10:00,992
[SPEAKER_11]: Who looked up the teenager's address and noted where he lived and reported it to the police And he's been in jail ever since He actually spent his 19th birthday in jail And if he's convicted, he's going to spend up to 8 years in prison And this is basically for making a terrorist threat

1917
02:10:03,312 --> 02:10:06,014
[SPEAKER_11]: It just goes to show what this is.

1918
02:10:06,414 --> 02:10:07,636
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, it's an ignorant kid.

1919
02:10:08,016 --> 02:10:12,420
[SPEAKER_11]: His dad said he doesn't watch the news, he doesn't read up on any current events.

1920
02:10:13,101 --> 02:10:15,182
[SPEAKER_11]: He's just a dumb kid making a threat.

1921
02:10:15,363 --> 02:10:19,146
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, but if you're on the internet, how do you not hear about stuff?

1922
02:10:20,227 --> 02:10:22,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Hearing about stuff that other people are talking about.

1923
02:10:22,149 --> 02:10:24,091
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, even apart from that, there's people...

1924
02:10:24,691 --> 02:10:29,554
[SPEAKER_11]: Who will all the time say really horrible things.

1925
02:10:29,634 --> 02:10:33,876
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, trying to threaten somebody or exert their own personal dominance over somebody else.

1926
02:10:34,777 --> 02:10:39,520
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's actually a petition out.

1927
02:10:39,560 --> 02:10:44,763
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate change.org just because when you sign any petition there, you get a bajillion emails.

1928
02:10:45,243 --> 02:10:45,923
[SPEAKER_11]: And I hate it.

1929
02:10:46,544 --> 02:10:53,588
[SPEAKER_11]: But there is a petition up on change.org right now to try to get him out of jail.

1930
02:10:54,168 --> 02:10:55,689
[SPEAKER_11]: Which, I don't know if it's going to work.

1931
02:10:55,829 --> 02:11:02,991
[SPEAKER_11]: But the whole thing that this boils down to, and it's sort of almost an epidemic when it comes to online play.

1932
02:11:03,251 --> 02:11:04,411
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1933
02:11:04,471 --> 02:11:09,093
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's not just the whole terrorist threat type statements.

1934
02:11:09,153 --> 02:11:12,794
[SPEAKER_11]: Because they're saying that there's kids everywhere being gotten in trouble for this.

1935
02:11:13,174 --> 02:11:16,195
[SPEAKER_11]: But for the ones who go, oh, I'm going to rape you.

1936
02:11:16,775 --> 02:11:21,656
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm sure they're not meaning they're going to go out and take somebody against their will.

1937
02:11:22,096 --> 02:11:23,637
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a means of exerting dominance.

1938
02:11:24,966 --> 02:11:29,690
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's, you know, a top of the ones says, you know, I will... Just relax and let it happen.

1939
02:11:31,131 --> 02:11:31,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God.

1940
02:11:31,792 --> 02:11:33,413
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob, I am disgusted.

1941
02:11:33,433 --> 02:11:37,537
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, like the whole... I'm just the G-rated version of that.

1942
02:11:37,637 --> 02:11:47,726
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, but on top of that, there's also ones going, well, I'm just going to beat the shit out of you or... I mean, just with all the cyberbullying that's been in the recent... Or the tits or GTFO.

1943
02:11:47,846 --> 02:11:50,328
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people say stupid shit on the internet.

1944
02:11:50,428 --> 02:11:51,389
[SPEAKER_06]: What a shock.

1945
02:11:51,949 --> 02:11:57,752
[SPEAKER_11]: But what we're looking into now is that people actually taking some of them seriously.

1946
02:11:58,832 --> 02:12:04,395
[SPEAKER_11]: And I firmly believe that this kid was just being a stupid kid.

1947
02:12:04,915 --> 02:12:11,599
[SPEAKER_11]: Just saying something that he thought was going to make himself sound a little more puffed up and a little bit more of a badass.

1948
02:12:12,719 --> 02:12:14,080
[SPEAKER_06]: You have eight years in prison.

1949
02:12:14,761 --> 02:12:20,006
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I mean, I would even think by now, even if they dropped the whole thing, he's fucking learned his lesson.

1950
02:12:20,066 --> 02:12:23,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, send the cops to his house to scare the shit out of him.

1951
02:12:23,369 --> 02:12:26,873
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like, that's how you learn your lesson.

1952
02:12:28,089 --> 02:12:49,740
[SPEAKER_11]: If I had a way to do that with everyone who said anything that out of context could remotely be taken as threatening or any type of bragging of said threatening action, I would do it in a heartbeat just to scare people into behaving even though it shouldn't take scaring people into behaving.

1953
02:12:50,020 --> 02:12:52,161
[SPEAKER_11]: They should just fucking know how to behave like a human being.

1954
02:12:53,061 --> 02:12:54,642
[SPEAKER_07]: That's asking a lot from people.

1955
02:12:54,682 --> 02:12:55,943
[SPEAKER_11]: That's asking a lot, I know.

1956
02:12:57,978 --> 02:13:21,143
[SPEAKER_11]: and I mean and it goes without saying that when you know you put these people behind a mask of anonymity that they think that they've got fair you know fair game to say anything that they want that there's no repercussion in this case the lady knew who he was and called on him you know I actually my point with this is that I would actually even express this as a cautionary tale

1957
02:13:22,615 --> 02:13:27,398
[SPEAKER_11]: Put it out there for any of these people who are going to be douches online.

1958
02:13:27,438 --> 02:13:28,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Not that our listeners would ever do that.

1959
02:13:28,998 --> 02:13:33,341
[SPEAKER_11]: No, because our listeners are kind, intelligent, beautiful, handsome.

1960
02:13:34,711 --> 02:13:37,434
[SPEAKER_11]: non-bigoted lovely people.

1961
02:13:37,874 --> 02:13:40,136
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you are bigoted, don't tell me or I'll beat you up.

1962
02:13:40,176 --> 02:13:40,516
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm kidding.

1963
02:13:42,018 --> 02:13:43,599
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I wouldn't beat anybody up.

1964
02:13:43,679 --> 02:13:46,182
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I hear sirens heading towards your house, Jamie.

1965
02:13:46,502 --> 02:13:48,363
[SPEAKER_07]: A po-po is coming for Jamie.

1966
02:13:48,404 --> 02:13:48,824
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever.

1967
02:13:49,124 --> 02:13:49,464
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

1968
02:13:49,525 --> 02:13:51,266
[SPEAKER_11]: I would just judge them really harshly.

1969
02:13:52,567 --> 02:14:00,855
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, you should never bring up something that you know is going to be

1970
02:14:03,521 --> 02:14:04,001
[SPEAKER_11]: Triggering.

1971
02:14:04,221 --> 02:14:07,642
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate to use the word, but something that's going to be triggering to somebody.

1972
02:14:07,662 --> 02:14:11,703
[SPEAKER_11]: There are people who lost family and friends in any number of terrorist attacks.

1973
02:14:11,783 --> 02:14:15,364
[SPEAKER_11]: I know people personally who have lost family members.

1974
02:14:16,604 --> 02:14:18,424
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a really awful thing.

1975
02:14:18,504 --> 02:14:31,927
[SPEAKER_11]: And when you bring up something like that, when there's such a volatile environment around just that concept, then you are really asking for a pile of shit.

1976
02:14:32,463 --> 02:14:46,954
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I think, like, games included, but, you know, just as everything moves more with more online communication, I mean, I think people just need to really be more mindful, and, like, we need to, you know, educate people of, you know, but, I mean, again, that's asking a lot.

1977
02:14:46,994 --> 02:14:51,898
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to quote my granddaddy, and my granddaddy was a great guy from, you know, Bridgeport, Connecticut.

1978
02:14:51,938 --> 02:14:54,260
[SPEAKER_11]: He was our Yankee when I grew up in the South.

1979
02:14:54,761 --> 02:14:57,403
[SPEAKER_11]: He always said, put brain and gear before mouth in motion.

1980
02:14:58,183 --> 02:15:01,586
[SPEAKER_11]: His other catchphrase was, don't be an instigator and an agitator.

1981
02:15:03,226 --> 02:15:06,549
[SPEAKER_11]: But, I mean, those are two really good pieces of advice.

1982
02:15:07,269 --> 02:15:11,052
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't want to stir up the hornet's nest.

1983
02:15:11,532 --> 02:15:15,816
[SPEAKER_11]: You have to gently remove it to where you don't get stung in the process or no one else get hurt.

1984
02:15:15,936 --> 02:15:16,937
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's the same thing.

1985
02:15:17,497 --> 02:15:23,322
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that with this kid, yeah, he doesn't deserve to be locked up, but he did deserve to have a stern talking to, at least.

1986
02:15:23,822 --> 02:15:25,063
[SPEAKER_11]: To have some sort of repercussion.

1987
02:15:25,083 --> 02:15:25,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Scared straight.

1988
02:15:25,804 --> 02:15:26,324
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.

1989
02:15:26,764 --> 02:15:28,285
[SPEAKER_11]: Or maybe he's scared gay, I don't know.

1990
02:15:28,926 --> 02:15:29,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever, whatever.

1991
02:15:30,447 --> 02:15:31,928
[SPEAKER_11]: You're the one who told me to go gaily forward.

1992
02:15:32,768 --> 02:15:33,048
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1993
02:15:33,928 --> 02:15:41,470
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyway, I think that in any of these cases, yeah, they need to drop it with Kid.

1994
02:15:42,251 --> 02:15:43,431
[SPEAKER_11]: He's clearly learned his lesson.

1995
02:15:43,811 --> 02:15:46,752
[SPEAKER_11]: But to everybody, just think before you speak.

1996
02:15:47,392 --> 02:15:55,875
[SPEAKER_11]: And instead of reacting to something that someone has said or something that you've seen or losing a game, boo-hoo, go cry me a fucking river.

1997
02:15:56,335 --> 02:15:56,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

1998
02:15:57,765 --> 02:15:59,025
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't react.

1999
02:15:59,546 --> 02:16:00,586
[SPEAKER_11]: Think and act.

2000
02:16:01,626 --> 02:16:02,367
[SPEAKER_06]: End of story.

2001
02:16:02,467 --> 02:16:10,150
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize after our press our luck game slide kick for threatening to kill you and leave your corpse out on the porch for the crows to pick at.

2002
02:16:10,210 --> 02:16:12,611
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't you say you were going to pee on my corpse too?

2003
02:16:12,831 --> 02:16:14,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I probably did.

2004
02:16:14,091 --> 02:16:17,613
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was going to hit you with a bug net repeatedly since you like Animal Crossing so much.

2005
02:16:19,404 --> 02:16:33,748
[SPEAKER_11]: I hear the sirens again, they're coming back this way I'm sorry, I shouldn't joke about that I would actually still like to encourage our listeners to keep a level head Don't react, think and act

2006
02:16:35,202 --> 02:16:35,982
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my new catchphrase.

2007
02:16:36,403 --> 02:16:39,684
[SPEAKER_06]: You should have a little McGruff the Crime Dog saying at the end of every episode.

2008
02:16:39,704 --> 02:16:44,687
[SPEAKER_06]: You should make some YouTube gaming PSAs.

2009
02:16:44,887 --> 02:16:47,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Jamie's Gaming Stern Advice.

2010
02:16:47,648 --> 02:16:48,909
[SPEAKER_06]: I almost said gameys.

2011
02:16:48,949 --> 02:16:51,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Wanda Sykes' Knock It Off.

2012
02:16:52,151 --> 02:16:55,952
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you know what's going to happen is I'm going to get a ton of people commenting on YouTube.

2013
02:16:57,722 --> 02:17:00,925
[SPEAKER_11]: Show Me Your Boobs, Get Back in the Kitchen, Rape, blah, blah, blah.

2014
02:17:00,985 --> 02:17:06,249
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I'm going to have to just single out each and every one of them, trace their IPs, and send them a letter.

2015
02:17:06,289 --> 02:17:09,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Backtrace them through the internet, through the cyber.

2016
02:17:10,012 --> 02:17:11,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Or just disable comments.

2017
02:17:11,693 --> 02:17:12,294
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I do.

2018
02:17:12,974 --> 02:17:17,918
[SPEAKER_11]: But I've actually done that before where I got one of those stupid, you know, so-and-so rape.

2019
02:17:18,179 --> 02:17:20,380
[SPEAKER_11]: But it came through a source that I was able to track back as IP.

2020
02:17:20,540 --> 02:17:21,761
[SPEAKER_11]: It was on a forum.

2021
02:17:22,002 --> 02:17:23,363
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it was a DDR Freak back in the day.

2022
02:17:23,823 --> 02:17:27,306
[SPEAKER_11]: I love all those people who say, oh, well, I just found your Facebook.

2023
02:17:27,326 --> 02:17:30,028
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm posting it back where your mom can see it.

2024
02:17:30,048 --> 02:17:32,730
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but then some trolls make it really successfully and it makes me very bitter.

2025
02:17:32,750 --> 02:17:33,611
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm having a drink as I say that.

2026
02:17:49,258 --> 02:17:53,920
[SPEAKER_11]: In some cases, it's when you remove that mask of anonymity that they really straighten up.

2027
02:17:54,020 --> 02:17:54,540
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?

2028
02:17:55,041 --> 02:17:58,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Degenerate Johnny in chat says, go to shitsenders.com and send them a cow pie.

2029
02:17:58,942 --> 02:17:59,743
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a real thing?

2030
02:18:00,043 --> 02:18:00,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it is.

2031
02:18:00,683 --> 02:18:01,764
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god, that's great.

2032
02:18:01,784 --> 02:18:03,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Captain Spike, if you're listening, happy birthday.

2033
02:18:05,166 --> 02:18:06,587
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, you know what I want to do?

2034
02:18:07,507 --> 02:18:11,809
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't know if something like this exists, because you know how there's like the National Sex Offender Registry?

2035
02:18:12,369 --> 02:18:13,970
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to do the Internet Offender Registry.

2036
02:18:14,130 --> 02:18:17,011
[SPEAKER_07]: National Gaming Douchebag Registry?

2037
02:18:17,151 --> 02:18:21,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, if you can do... Slander, slander, lawsuit, slander.

2038
02:18:21,933 --> 02:18:29,437
[SPEAKER_11]: If you can do soandsoparkslikeanasshole.com, then you can do shitpeoplesaidontheinternet.com.

2039
02:18:31,246 --> 02:18:32,707
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I'm just saying.

2040
02:18:33,187 --> 02:18:35,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Captain Spike is in chat, by the way, and says, rude.

2041
02:18:37,928 --> 02:18:38,249
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2042
02:18:39,169 --> 02:18:39,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on.

2043
02:18:40,249 --> 02:18:41,890
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure we have lots of other thoughts on this.

2044
02:18:42,270 --> 02:18:46,111
[SPEAKER_06]: I invite you guys to email us, mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com.

2045
02:18:46,452 --> 02:18:49,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Although we are definitely going to change that email address in the coming weeks.

2046
02:18:50,153 --> 02:18:51,733
[SPEAKER_06]: But for now, you can still use that.

2047
02:18:51,753 --> 02:18:53,474
[SPEAKER_06]: There'll be plenty of announcement when we flip it over.

2048
02:18:53,954 --> 02:18:55,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com.

2049
02:18:56,455 --> 02:18:58,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Meanwhile... Everyone's doing emails these days.

2050
02:18:59,397 --> 02:18:59,897
[SPEAKER_11]: I love it.

2051
02:19:00,317 --> 02:19:00,557
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

2052
02:19:00,938 --> 02:19:06,120
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Queen City has a national douche burr registry, and Fifth Dream says dbagshaming.com.

2053
02:19:07,321 --> 02:19:08,402
[SPEAKER_11]: I am all for that.

2054
02:19:08,482 --> 02:19:09,042
[SPEAKER_11]: I would do it.

2055
02:19:10,023 --> 02:19:10,363
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2056
02:19:11,123 --> 02:19:16,866
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to run it through Sweden so that we don't get... Loki, we need something a little less serious here.

2057
02:19:17,847 --> 02:19:18,247
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2058
02:19:20,668 --> 02:19:21,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see here.

2059
02:19:21,329 --> 02:19:21,489
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

2060
02:19:23,226 --> 02:19:25,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Molly Jam, Part 2.

2061
02:19:26,970 --> 02:19:28,011
[SPEAKER_04]: This one's going to be a little different.

2062
02:19:28,071 --> 02:19:40,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of basing it off of the fake Peter Molyneux Twitter account and those kind of ideas, these are based off of actual quotes from Peter Molyneux.

2063
02:19:41,984 --> 02:19:43,646
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's weird.

2064
02:19:44,967 --> 02:19:45,988
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really weird.

2065
02:19:46,088 --> 02:19:48,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you read the one that was included in that article?

2066
02:19:48,948 --> 02:19:49,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I can do that.

2067
02:19:49,849 --> 02:19:52,032
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, here is some of the stuff.

2068
02:19:52,052 --> 02:19:53,715
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think a lot of this is going to be very dirty.

2069
02:19:53,955 --> 02:19:55,077
[SPEAKER_04]: It's you Americans.

2070
02:19:55,197 --> 02:19:57,520
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something about nipples you hate.

2071
02:19:57,981 --> 02:20:01,766
[SPEAKER_04]: If this were Germany, we'd be romping around naked on stage here.

2072
02:20:03,208 --> 02:20:04,109
[SPEAKER_04]: So that could become a game.

2073
02:20:04,395 --> 02:20:04,895
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2074
02:20:26,451 --> 02:20:27,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Neckbreaker!

2075
02:20:27,752 --> 02:20:28,873
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.

2076
02:20:29,253 --> 02:20:29,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see here.

2077
02:20:29,954 --> 02:20:34,457
[SPEAKER_04]: We're explorers who have just discovered this new continent of emotion.

2078
02:20:34,557 --> 02:20:35,458
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd actually play that.

2079
02:20:35,478 --> 02:20:38,800
[SPEAKER_04]: It would probably be very cool.

2080
02:20:38,841 --> 02:20:42,844
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I had some time machine and could go back two weeks.

2081
02:20:43,184 --> 02:20:44,985
[SPEAKER_04]: You live by your mistakes for sure.

2082
02:20:46,306 --> 02:20:50,770
[SPEAKER_04]: When you rip your fingers on the screen, you tear the landscape apart with your physical hands.

2083
02:20:51,170 --> 02:20:52,671
[SPEAKER_04]: It just feels amazing, man.

2084
02:20:53,071 --> 02:20:54,312
[SPEAKER_04]: It feels amazing.

2085
02:20:55,453 --> 02:20:56,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see here.

2086
02:20:59,675 --> 02:21:02,016
[SPEAKER_06]: They have 48 hours to make a game out of these quotes.

2087
02:21:02,036 --> 02:21:04,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there's like 22 quotes here.

2088
02:21:04,037 --> 02:21:06,559
[SPEAKER_07]: The one about ripping the screen would have to be an iOS title.

2089
02:21:06,899 --> 02:21:09,300
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember hearing about this last year.

2090
02:21:09,720 --> 02:21:13,782
[SPEAKER_04]: You can eliminate starvation or you can double it.

2091
02:21:14,262 --> 02:21:18,004
[SPEAKER_04]: You can empty the treasury or you can fill it with gold and rub it all over your body.

2092
02:21:19,785 --> 02:21:20,826
[SPEAKER_07]: That game sounds hot.

2093
02:21:21,346 --> 02:21:22,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, another Atari adult game.

2094
02:21:24,607 --> 02:21:53,307
[SPEAKER_04]: will the first female nudity give you a success or will it turn off an audience what is that gonna be I gotta see that I'm not punishing you for button mashing I'm rewarding you for not button mashing and that's a really big distinction that could be a rhythm game alright anyhow show me the games when you're doing it in multiplayer it feels incredible I love that so the theme is gonna be adult games then

2095
02:21:53,587 --> 02:21:54,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Good times.

2096
02:21:55,429 --> 02:22:01,014
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, maybe some of these games that come out of Moley Jam could be pitched to Dave & Buster's Arcade Chain.

2097
02:22:01,194 --> 02:22:01,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God.

2098
02:22:01,815 --> 02:22:04,237
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Dave & Buster's, of course, it's Chuck G's results.

2099
02:22:04,257 --> 02:22:08,641
[SPEAKER_11]: It used to be the annual site of my birthday every year where I would play Chuck.

2100
02:22:09,261 --> 02:22:10,422
[SPEAKER_06]: It stopped for some reason.

2101
02:22:10,643 --> 02:22:13,125
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, because they got rid of Battletech.

2102
02:22:14,186 --> 02:22:22,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, anyhow, Dave and Busters, along with Comedy Central, VH1, and MTV, that whole network thing, is putting on this contest called the Next Big Game Search.

2109
02:23:00,424 --> 02:23:01,885
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to be a resident of the U.S.

2110
02:23:02,365 --> 02:23:03,306
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm telling you what, though.

2111
02:23:03,326 --> 02:23:12,570
[SPEAKER_06]: If you go and submit an OLR Dream Game and you win this competition, patent pending, and you owe us a chunk of your winnings.

2112
02:23:12,630 --> 02:23:13,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Just saying.

2113
02:23:13,650 --> 02:23:16,032
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to buy us a hell of a nice meal at Dave & Buster's.

2114
02:23:16,072 --> 02:23:16,752
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I'm saying.

2115
02:23:16,932 --> 02:23:18,653
[SPEAKER_07]: You can record live from Dave & Buster's.

2116
02:23:19,662 --> 02:23:20,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's right.

2117
02:23:21,082 --> 02:23:23,263
[SPEAKER_06]: We should go submit some of our favorite dream game ideas.

2118
02:23:23,283 --> 02:23:23,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Just do them all.

2119
02:23:24,343 --> 02:23:25,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Just do them all.

2120
02:23:26,884 --> 02:23:27,504
[SPEAKER_06]: This will be fun.

2121
02:23:28,944 --> 02:23:34,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you imagine if the winning game out of this was WhatTheyPlay.com, Snap, or Puzzle Sluts?

2122
02:23:34,726 --> 02:23:35,926
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it has to be for all ages.

2123
02:23:38,166 --> 02:23:41,047
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think that the Roseville Dave & Buster's has the DDR anymore.

2124
02:23:41,527 --> 02:23:41,967
[SPEAKER_11]: That's sad.

2125
02:23:42,787 --> 02:23:44,548
[SPEAKER_11]: Answering Misty in chat room because she asked.

2126
02:23:45,048 --> 02:23:47,989
[SPEAKER_11]: Besides that, the Roseville Dave & Buster's is the size of a closet.

2127
02:23:48,329 --> 02:23:49,029
[SPEAKER_11]: No one goes there anyway.

2128
02:23:49,329 --> 02:23:53,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, when you have a Dave & Buster's that's smaller than Times Square Dave & Buster's, it's a problem.

2129
02:23:53,851 --> 02:23:55,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's go to the mailbag.

2130
02:23:55,751 --> 02:24:03,614
[SPEAKER_06]: Every week you guys email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we sift through the emails that are mixed in with all the Asian spam that we get.

2131
02:24:04,934 --> 02:24:06,835
[SPEAKER_11]: and... We have a lot of Asian spam this time.

2132
02:24:06,855 --> 02:24:08,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, and Russian spam.

2133
02:24:08,716 --> 02:24:09,496
[SPEAKER_06]: And French spam.

2134
02:24:09,916 --> 02:24:13,958
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, just when we thought the French spam and Russian spam was done with, now it's... Zoot le porn!

2135
02:24:14,278 --> 02:24:15,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, moving on.

2136
02:24:15,819 --> 02:24:18,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at orangeauntradio.com, DarkSakura, dive in the mailbag, pull out some emails.

2137
02:24:19,100 --> 02:24:21,161
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, um... Hello, guys.

2138
02:24:21,601 --> 02:24:21,941
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello.

2139
02:24:23,182 --> 02:24:25,903
[SPEAKER_11]: OLR, the video game podcast where every gamer has a voice, right?

2140
02:24:25,943 --> 02:24:28,184
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'm gonna offer up mine to say, girl, please.

2141
02:24:29,104 --> 02:24:31,105
[SPEAKER_11]: Ocarina of Time is not an overrated game.

2142
02:24:31,405 --> 02:24:34,166
[SPEAKER_11]: It is as deserving of praise just as much as Link to the Past is.

2143
02:24:34,486 --> 02:24:35,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Next email.

2144
02:24:35,629 --> 02:24:36,370
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, Rob.

2145
02:24:37,352 --> 02:24:37,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Fine.

2146
02:24:38,535 --> 02:24:42,082
[SPEAKER_11]: To quote a video game, sit your ass down in that chair and drink your goddamn tea.

2147
02:24:45,236 --> 02:24:46,177
[SPEAKER_11]: Hearts, hearts, hearts, hearts.

2148
02:24:46,937 --> 02:24:48,037
[SPEAKER_11]: It is, okay, blah, blah, blah.

2149
02:24:48,077 --> 02:24:52,920
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, the major thing that determines which you have an affinity for is the one you grew up playing first.

2150
02:24:53,440 --> 02:24:58,303
[SPEAKER_11]: Mine obviously was Ocarina, but I also grew up playing A Link to the Past on Game Boy Advance.

2151
02:24:59,283 --> 02:25:06,227
[SPEAKER_11]: I have many fond memories of playing through that game, just as I do with Ocarina of Time, but Ocarina moved me on a deeper level and made me into the gamer I am today.

2152
02:25:06,647 --> 02:25:10,329
[SPEAKER_11]: For the record, I actually really like both of them about equally.

2153
02:25:10,469 --> 02:25:11,590
[SPEAKER_11]: It depends on the mood I'm in.

2154
02:25:12,631 --> 02:25:13,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I really like them both.

2155
02:25:14,612 --> 02:25:16,213
[SPEAKER_07]: I really like Majora's Mask too.

2156
02:25:16,293 --> 02:25:21,856
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like, I really love lasagna, but I also really, really like sushi.

2157
02:25:22,396 --> 02:25:26,118
[SPEAKER_06]: I really like Link to the Past, and that's the end of that sentence.

2158
02:25:26,519 --> 02:25:30,761
[SPEAKER_11]: This brings me to two questions about your opinions on Ocarina of Time specifically for Rob.

2159
02:25:33,483 --> 02:25:36,224
[SPEAKER_11]: 1.

2160
02:25:34,023 --> 02:25:36,224
[SPEAKER_11]: You mentioned that you really like Twilight Princess.

2161
02:25:36,385 --> 02:25:37,245
[SPEAKER_11]: Hell, I did too.

2162
02:25:37,866 --> 02:25:47,852
[SPEAKER_11]: I caused a flood warning for all of Northeast Ohio with how much I came buckets over Link turning into a wolf.

2163
02:25:48,272 --> 02:25:49,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Came buckets?

2164
02:25:49,713 --> 02:25:52,615
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought I was thinking cried, but it's came buckets.

2165
02:25:52,735 --> 02:25:53,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Sexy chat.

2166
02:25:53,576 --> 02:25:53,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Sticky.

2167
02:25:55,117 --> 02:25:59,180
[SPEAKER_11]: But why are you so fond of a game that took a lot of cues from Ocarina of Time?

2168
02:25:59,220 --> 02:26:00,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Rob, why?

2169
02:26:00,140 --> 02:26:00,741
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, Rob, why?

2170
02:26:01,721 --> 02:26:03,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, next question.

2171
02:26:04,444 --> 02:26:09,607
[SPEAKER_06]: No, especially with all the waggle technology being new and it was something that was a little bit outside of Wii Sports.

2172
02:26:10,028 --> 02:26:15,912
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think also kind of getting to see the game with more, like, you know, in Ocarina of Time, the 3D was still so early on.

2173
02:26:15,932 --> 02:26:20,035
[SPEAKER_06]: You had a lot of very blocky textures and very solid colors and, you know, things.

2174
02:26:20,135 --> 02:26:25,379
[SPEAKER_06]: And I realized at the time there were a lot of people that were very imaginative and it didn't matter.

2175
02:26:25,439 --> 02:26:27,621
[SPEAKER_06]: But you have to remember, there were a lot of us

2176
02:26:28,061 --> 02:26:30,142
[SPEAKER_06]: and my generation that grew up on the 2D games.

2177
02:26:30,182 --> 02:26:32,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you say that, you know, Ocarina of Time was from your generation.

2178
02:26:33,144 --> 02:26:35,925
[SPEAKER_06]: We were a little more stubborn when it came to getting into the 3D.

2179
02:26:36,206 --> 02:26:38,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I was cool with Mario Kart.

2180
02:26:39,367 --> 02:26:40,788
[SPEAKER_06]: I like Mario 64.

2181
02:26:41,088 --> 02:26:43,490
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it deserves all the praise that it gets.

2182
02:26:45,031 --> 02:26:46,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you an N64 hater?

2183
02:26:46,711 --> 02:26:47,892
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not an N64 hater.

2184
02:26:47,912 --> 02:26:51,034
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're saying you didn't pee your pants when Star Fox came out?

2185
02:26:52,082 --> 02:26:53,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Ocarina of Time Ocarina of Time

2186
02:27:13,809 --> 02:27:30,564
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright Number two, a while back I remember you mentioning that you're not a big fan of Metroid Prime You didn't like the direction Nintendo took the series and that it just didn't have the same feeling of the older games like Super Metroid Do you think that this has to do with why you didn't like Ocarina of Time and the fact that both games were a shift to 3D?

2187
02:27:30,804 --> 02:27:40,773
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, but I like Metroid Prime 3 for the record Did you just not like that change and wish the game stayed as top-down Zelda or side-scrolling Metroid games?

2188
02:27:42,364 --> 02:27:48,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes and no, because I still stand pretty hard for Zelda 2, which even Miyamoto himself has issues with.

2189
02:27:49,247 --> 02:27:50,087
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't like Zelda 2.

2190
02:27:50,267 --> 02:27:54,128
[SPEAKER_06]: And that shifted back and forth, but I'll defend that game as pretty fucking awesome.

2191
02:27:54,449 --> 02:27:56,249
[SPEAKER_11]: Dan will agree with you, just saying.

2192
02:27:57,110 --> 02:28:02,231
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hard as hell, but beating that game when I was a kid, I'm not going to be able to do that again.

2193
02:28:02,411 --> 02:28:02,952
[SPEAKER_06]: I've tried.

2194
02:28:03,852 --> 02:28:04,412
[SPEAKER_07]: That's tough.

2195
02:28:05,092 --> 02:28:06,293
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think about Wind Waker?

2196
02:28:08,027 --> 02:28:09,748
[SPEAKER_06]: I honestly didn't play enough of it.

2197
02:28:11,748 --> 02:28:13,309
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't play enough of it.

2198
02:28:13,349 --> 02:28:15,150
[SPEAKER_11]: Dan beat Wind Waker and he really liked it.

2199
02:28:15,390 --> 02:28:16,730
[SPEAKER_11]: I just couldn't get into it.

2200
02:28:16,970 --> 02:28:20,912
[SPEAKER_06]: If I can borrow the HD one or get it on Gamefly or something, I'll give it another try.

2201
02:28:21,012 --> 02:28:22,612
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Rob, I can lend you mine.

2202
02:28:23,352 --> 02:28:26,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, there's the HD remake coming out on the Wii U. I'd like to try it.

2203
02:28:28,454 --> 02:28:29,555
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you and your HD.

2204
02:28:30,055 --> 02:28:30,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

2205
02:28:31,331 --> 02:28:38,131
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for reading and sorry for the slightly longer email, but I just got to defend my first and favorite gaming love that is Ocarina of Time, and that's from Osfer.

2206
02:28:40,101 --> 02:28:46,226
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't need to know about you, Coming Bucket.

2207
02:28:46,246 --> 02:28:46,846
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a PS.

2208
02:28:46,946 --> 02:28:47,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that was Osfer?

2209
02:28:48,047 --> 02:28:48,247
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

2210
02:28:48,448 --> 02:28:49,929
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not surprised about the Coming Buckets.

2211
02:28:50,269 --> 02:28:53,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, because Twilight Princess has, like, never mind.

2212
02:28:53,352 --> 02:28:57,235
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually just finished a playthrough of Ocarina of Time last night with one of my close friends.

2213
02:28:57,615 --> 02:29:02,599
[SPEAKER_11]: We took turns playing through the dungeons and reminiscing on how we grew up while playing it as kids.

2214
02:29:02,900 --> 02:29:05,021
[SPEAKER_11]: After the end credits, we were both pretty teary-eyed.

2215
02:29:05,041 --> 02:29:06,363
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, she played again.

2216
02:29:07,043 --> 02:29:07,444
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

2217
02:29:07,624 --> 02:29:14,470
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually, not too long ago, played through Ocarina on the GameCube Redo disc.

2218
02:29:14,510 --> 02:29:16,713
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to get the 3DS version.

2219
02:29:16,753 --> 02:29:17,373
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really good.

2220
02:29:17,393 --> 02:29:21,657
[SPEAKER_11]: I still wanted $40 for it, and they're charging a premium for it because it's out of print now.

2221
02:29:22,458 --> 02:29:22,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

2222
02:29:23,959 --> 02:29:26,361
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, I just want to make sure this is very clear.

2223
02:29:26,642 --> 02:29:28,063
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't hate Ocarina of Time.

2224
02:29:28,423 --> 02:29:32,006
[SPEAKER_06]: I never have, and I've never said that word on the show in regards to Ocarina of Time.

2225
02:29:32,526 --> 02:29:36,609
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't lavish all the praise upon it that many other people do.

2226
02:29:37,090 --> 02:29:37,990
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a good game.

2227
02:29:38,030 --> 02:29:39,211
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, I think it's a great game.

2228
02:29:39,331 --> 02:29:41,853
[SPEAKER_06]: I just don't think it's in my top 20.

2229
02:29:42,054 --> 02:29:44,756
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob, you like it, you just don't like like it.

2230
02:29:44,896 --> 02:29:45,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

2231
02:29:46,037 --> 02:29:46,597
[SPEAKER_11]: You wouldn't date it.

2232
02:29:46,697 --> 02:29:47,738
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't eat at S.H.I.E.L.D.

2233
02:29:48,379 --> 02:29:50,060
[SPEAKER_11]: You'd go to Pinkberry with it, but you wouldn't date it.

2234
02:29:50,080 --> 02:29:50,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Get it?

2235
02:29:50,300 --> 02:29:51,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I don't like like it?

2236
02:29:53,223 --> 02:29:57,104
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a Zelda joke, people!

2237
02:29:57,345 --> 02:29:57,745
[SPEAKER_06]: I try.

2238
02:30:00,546 --> 02:30:01,226
[SPEAKER_11]: Last email.

2239
02:30:02,947 --> 02:30:04,528
[SPEAKER_11]: This is from Sam.

2240
02:30:04,928 --> 02:30:05,348
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Sam.

2241
02:30:05,949 --> 02:30:06,829
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, OLR crew.

2242
02:30:06,949 --> 02:30:07,690
[SPEAKER_11]: I love the show.

2243
02:30:08,150 --> 02:30:13,753
[SPEAKER_11]: If the devs stop making single player games, are we really any better off than we were before Microsoft's change in plans?

2244
02:30:13,813 --> 02:30:14,453
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you all think?

2245
02:30:14,833 --> 02:30:16,474
[SPEAKER_11]: First of all, I don't think single player games are going away.

2246
02:30:16,634 --> 02:30:17,995
[SPEAKER_06]: No, single player games won't go away.

2247
02:30:18,055 --> 02:30:19,976
[SPEAKER_06]: There will always be a demand for single player games.

2248
02:30:19,996 --> 02:30:21,677
[SPEAKER_11]: There are always antisocial people.

2249
02:30:21,937 --> 02:30:28,941
[SPEAKER_06]: However, I can see where this guy, unless Sam is for Samantha, it could be guy or girl, but I'm going to assume guy.

2250
02:30:30,262 --> 02:30:31,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Way to assume, Rob.

2251
02:30:31,262 --> 02:30:32,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Where this individual...

2252
02:30:34,584 --> 02:30:35,385
[SPEAKER_10]: Our lovely writer.

2253
02:30:36,266 --> 02:30:36,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2254
02:30:37,087 --> 02:30:42,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Where this individual is getting this from, because it does seem like a lot of single player games that have come out lately have a multiplayer mode suddenly in it.

2255
02:30:42,993 --> 02:30:43,213
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

2256
02:30:43,453 --> 02:30:44,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Just within the past few months.

2257
02:30:45,055 --> 02:30:45,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Tomb Raider.

2258
02:30:45,476 --> 02:30:49,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Tomb Raider, Uncharted 3, Last of Us, Mass Effect 3.

2259
02:30:50,561 --> 02:30:52,583
[SPEAKER_06]: All the Assassin's Creed ones, even though it's a little bit older.

2260
02:30:52,803 --> 02:30:53,524
[SPEAKER_06]: Assassin's Creed 3.

2261
02:30:53,784 --> 02:30:55,386
[SPEAKER_06]: They all have multiplayer modes in them.

2262
02:30:55,746 --> 02:31:04,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I don't think in any of these cases they've necessarily detracted from the single-player game, although some people kind of resented that you kind of had to play multiplayer to get the edge in Mass Effect 3.

2263
02:31:04,834 --> 02:31:05,835
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

2264
02:31:05,855 --> 02:31:08,257
[SPEAKER_07]: But Mass Effect 3 multiplayer is great.

2265
02:31:08,537 --> 02:31:09,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's the thing.

2266
02:31:09,698 --> 02:31:10,058
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the thing.

2267
02:31:10,118 --> 02:31:10,579
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great.

2268
02:31:11,019 --> 02:31:14,983
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it also gives the games more replay value, I guess you could say.

2269
02:31:15,143 --> 02:31:20,047
[SPEAKER_07]: I still have yet to... Although, for Mass Effect fans, replay value is going and making another Shepard, let's be real.

2270
02:31:20,802 --> 02:31:21,422
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

2271
02:31:22,182 --> 02:31:23,403
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, and this is the funny thing.

2272
02:31:24,723 --> 02:31:28,224
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm now on my third playthrough of the first game because I'm braving the motion sickness.

2273
02:31:28,404 --> 02:31:31,525
[SPEAKER_11]: I've beaten two and three 27 bajillion times.

2274
02:31:32,045 --> 02:31:38,666
[SPEAKER_11]: The fun for that for me is making a new Shepard and completely hacking everything I can possibly hack about the appearance.

2275
02:31:40,287 --> 02:31:46,548
[SPEAKER_11]: I have one wearing Ashley's face like it's ripped off of her flesh as she died on Vermeier.

2276
02:31:47,628 --> 02:31:48,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.

2277
02:31:48,769 --> 02:31:49,929
[SPEAKER_11]: And wearing Warren's outfit.

2278
02:31:52,478 --> 02:31:53,960
[SPEAKER_11]: She's been referred to as Hobag Ashley.

2279
02:31:54,500 --> 02:32:00,106
[SPEAKER_06]: So in my discussion there, the original question was Xbox One something.

2280
02:32:01,147 --> 02:32:02,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you closed the email, huh?

2281
02:32:02,308 --> 02:32:02,689
[SPEAKER_09]: I did.

2282
02:32:02,709 --> 02:32:07,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think that single players are going away?

2283
02:32:07,614 --> 02:32:12,739
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it was necessarily going away, but I think it has something to do with as they fade more and more.

2284
02:32:12,920 --> 02:32:14,401
[SPEAKER_11]: Is Microsoft's decision a bad one?

2285
02:32:14,922 --> 02:32:15,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

2286
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:24,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I still think if Microsoft wanted to do... Here's the thing.

2287
02:32:25,760 --> 02:32:35,022
[SPEAKER_06]: If Microsoft wanted to try and push digital, then there's no reason they can't run two separate license systems, your disk-based license and your digital-based license.

2288
02:32:35,442 --> 02:32:37,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not enhance the digital license?

2289
02:32:38,542 --> 02:32:47,304
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Nintendo dipped their little pinky in the water when they said, well, if you buy the game digitally, you'll get 5%, what is it, 10% back in points, which you can trade in for cards, right?

2290
02:32:47,604 --> 02:32:51,805
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit of a tiny-ass incentive, but it's some incentive to get the game online.

2291
02:32:52,145 --> 02:32:54,386
[SPEAKER_06]: What if Microsoft said, okay, we're going to one-up that.

2292
02:32:54,706 --> 02:33:03,091
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you digitally buy the game, here's the perk you get over getting it on disc, is that you can now share this digital game with a friend.

2293
02:33:03,111 --> 02:33:05,572
[SPEAKER_06]: You can loan it out to a friend across the country instantly.

2294
02:33:05,893 --> 02:33:07,914
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the perk you get with it.

2295
02:33:07,954 --> 02:33:10,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, why can't they run both licenses?

2296
02:33:10,415 --> 02:33:11,456
[SPEAKER_06]: They can do it.

2297
02:33:11,956 --> 02:33:13,897
[SPEAKER_06]: It will take time to develop and so on.

2298
02:33:14,497 --> 02:33:17,519
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if Microsoft really wants to, for the Xbox...

2299
02:33:18,259 --> 02:33:24,864
[SPEAKER_06]: S2 or whatever their next generation system is called after this, assuming this box doesn't kill the company, but I don't think it will.

2300
02:33:27,286 --> 02:33:36,894
[SPEAKER_06]: They could start getting people used to the idea of digital and why it's better as opposed to, nope, we're going to change the whole fucking thing.

2301
02:33:37,765 --> 02:33:40,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, we're turning your world upside down.

2302
02:33:40,787 --> 02:33:49,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, even though I don't approve of a lot of what the Xbox One was trying to do, I do think it's a shame that we didn't see how it could have developed.

2303
02:33:49,793 --> 02:33:52,835
[SPEAKER_06]: The positive was never clearly communicated, only the negative.

2304
02:33:53,196 --> 02:33:54,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, lesson learned, hopefully.

2305
02:33:56,718 --> 02:33:58,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, that was it for Mailbag, right?

2306
02:33:59,519 --> 02:34:02,565
[SPEAKER_06]: That means we get to the FUs of the week.

2307
02:34:02,705 --> 02:34:05,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Every week here on this show we let out a little angst.

2308
02:34:05,711 --> 02:34:06,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

2309
02:34:06,172 --> 02:34:08,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we're just really angry people.

2310
02:34:24,761 --> 02:34:29,142
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I hate bringing up traffic, but this was really fucking stupid.

2311
02:34:31,772 --> 02:34:48,163
[SPEAKER_11]: When I was driving over that same bridge over across the American River coming this way to your place, Rob, someone was freaking tailgating me while all that road construction was with a cop expecting me to speed.

2312
02:34:49,024 --> 02:34:50,645
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm like, no.

2313
02:34:50,725 --> 02:34:59,170
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know everybody and their twin goes 20 miles over the speed limit over that bridge, but I wasn't about to do it while there was a CHP parked off to the side.

2314
02:35:00,231 --> 02:35:05,056
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, your convenience isn't worth me having a $300 ticket.

2315
02:35:05,777 --> 02:35:06,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki?

2316
02:35:07,038 --> 02:35:08,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you to hand, foot, and mouth disease.

2317
02:35:09,080 --> 02:35:10,822
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like having blisters on my hands and feet.

2318
02:35:12,003 --> 02:35:12,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Or my mouth.

2319
02:35:13,665 --> 02:35:14,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Slide kick?

2320
02:35:14,165 --> 02:35:14,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't you go next?

2321
02:35:15,465 --> 02:35:23,947
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say F you to the lady in the Target parking lot who gave me a very pressed look when I was trying to leave.

2322
02:35:24,687 --> 02:35:32,249
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry that I delayed you like 10 seconds getting to your car so you could go home and eat your Panda Express.

2323
02:35:32,769 --> 02:35:34,169
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure it just ruined your day.

2324
02:35:34,509 --> 02:35:37,250
[SPEAKER_07]: That orange chicken just fucking... She glared at me.

2325
02:35:37,330 --> 02:35:38,530
[SPEAKER_06]: She's like, fine, go.

2326
02:35:38,590 --> 02:35:40,771
[SPEAKER_06]: The orange chicken would not stay warm in this weather.

2327
02:35:43,024 --> 02:35:45,666
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, by the way, I'd like to add a thank you to you.

2328
02:35:46,607 --> 02:35:46,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Aww.

2329
02:35:46,907 --> 02:35:49,349
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much for facilitating the crack.

2330
02:35:49,990 --> 02:35:52,852
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you for the Groupon for brunch.

2331
02:35:52,932 --> 02:35:53,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, hey, hey.

2332
02:35:54,313 --> 02:35:57,215
[SPEAKER_06]: No rainbow and sunshine shit in the FU segment.

2333
02:35:57,235 --> 02:35:58,176
[SPEAKER_11]: You better watch it.

2334
02:35:58,396 --> 02:35:59,017
[SPEAKER_06]: FU, Rob.

2335
02:35:59,257 --> 02:36:00,198
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, FU, Rob.

2336
02:36:00,218 --> 02:36:01,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Just kidding, I love you.

2337
02:36:01,319 --> 02:36:01,779
[SPEAKER_06]: I-L-U.

2338
02:36:02,059 --> 02:36:02,680
[SPEAKER_06]: F-U both.

2339
02:36:02,720 --> 02:36:03,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's my finger.

2340
02:36:03,961 --> 02:36:05,662
[SPEAKER_06]: You should do an I-L-U section.

2341
02:36:06,603 --> 02:36:09,245
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to do an I-L-U's of the week?

2342
02:36:09,285 --> 02:36:10,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, hold on, because I've got to get my F-U out.

2343
02:36:11,647 --> 02:36:15,629
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck you to this goddamn shitty fucking hateful heat.

2344
02:36:16,049 --> 02:36:16,670
[SPEAKER_11]: Amen!

2345
02:36:17,070 --> 02:36:18,451
[SPEAKER_06]: TimTRP in chat agrees.

2346
02:36:19,371 --> 02:36:20,072
[SPEAKER_11]: It is hateful.

2347
02:36:20,332 --> 02:36:21,572
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a good word for a robot.

2348
02:36:21,612 --> 02:36:22,193
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very hateful.

2349
02:36:22,233 --> 02:36:24,274
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sliding on the chair.

2350
02:36:24,434 --> 02:36:27,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, it's time for the ILUs of the week.

2351
02:36:29,477 --> 02:36:31,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I'm using the same music bumper twice.

2352
02:36:31,538 --> 02:36:33,299
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the ILUs of the week.

2353
02:36:33,439 --> 02:36:34,599
[SPEAKER_06]: I love you, KBB.

2354
02:36:36,460 --> 02:36:37,401
[SPEAKER_11]: Dark Sakura.

2355
02:36:38,280 --> 02:36:40,801
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for the 3DS!

2356
02:36:40,841 --> 02:36:43,162
[SPEAKER_11]: Slack kick, you are my hero forever.

2357
02:36:45,163 --> 02:36:48,424
[SPEAKER_11]: And I have Animal Crossing now, thank you, because you facilitated it.

2358
02:36:49,125 --> 02:36:50,745
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm glad you enjoyed your sausage.

2359
02:36:52,326 --> 02:36:54,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I always enjoy my sausage.

2360
02:36:54,927 --> 02:37:02,670
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have to say ILU to DarkSakura for the Groupon, for brunch, and for sharing her French toast with me.

2361
02:37:02,690 --> 02:37:03,431
[SPEAKER_07]: It was so good.

2362
02:37:06,026 --> 02:37:22,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Sam's should be a sponsor and I'm going to give my ILU of the week to Alan because he's over there in the kitchen clearly making dinner you can't hear the foil in the background you've got an ILU right?

2363
02:37:23,074 --> 02:37:32,137
[SPEAKER_06]: you know the quickest way to a man's heart is through his stomach no, it's through the rib cage Loki, what's your ILU of the week?

2364
02:37:32,157 --> 02:37:33,218
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have one, sorry

2365
02:37:34,238 --> 02:37:34,578
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

2366
02:37:34,758 --> 02:37:35,858
[SPEAKER_04]: You grumpy cat.

2367
02:37:35,879 --> 02:37:38,799
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the fact that it's really sweltering hot in here.

2368
02:37:38,879 --> 02:37:40,660
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.

2369
02:37:40,680 --> 02:37:41,380
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nothing I can do.

2370
02:37:41,500 --> 02:37:43,041
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have ILU to breadsticks?

2371
02:37:43,441 --> 02:37:45,481
[SPEAKER_06]: ILU to these five fans.

2372
02:37:45,781 --> 02:37:48,122
[SPEAKER_06]: One, two, three, four.

2373
02:37:49,042 --> 02:37:49,703
[SPEAKER_06]: I made one up.

2374
02:37:49,723 --> 02:37:50,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Five.

2375
02:37:50,323 --> 02:37:52,363
[SPEAKER_09]: And all your fans in the chat room.

2376
02:37:54,004 --> 02:37:54,204
[SPEAKER_11]: Aww.

2377
02:37:54,624 --> 02:37:54,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

2378
02:37:54,984 --> 02:37:55,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Oops.

2379
02:37:55,384 --> 02:37:55,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

2380
02:37:56,565 --> 02:37:58,025
[SPEAKER_06]: That was not meant to be followed by holic.

2381
02:37:59,091 --> 02:38:00,791
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything is meant to be followed by Holic.

2382
02:38:02,892 --> 02:38:03,972
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, moving on.

2383
02:38:04,312 --> 02:38:09,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, if you could possibly do the next story.

2384
02:38:09,594 --> 02:38:09,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

2385
02:38:10,434 --> 02:38:19,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so unfortunately there was a little bit of an issue with the precursor games.

2386
02:38:19,797 --> 02:38:28,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, writer, game designer, and artist Ken McColl, he was arrested for possession of child pornography.

2387
02:38:30,447 --> 02:38:33,290
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not good.

2388
02:38:33,430 --> 02:38:34,791
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's definitely not good.

2389
02:38:34,951 --> 02:38:45,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, the company is now distancing themselves from their co-founder, and he doesn't have anything to do now, obviously, with Shadows of the Eternals.

2390
02:38:48,144 --> 02:38:52,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Every time I hear Shadow of the Eternal, now I hear this as the theme song.

2391
02:38:54,722 --> 02:39:01,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, as if Precursor needed any more bad press, honestly.

2392
02:39:02,109 --> 02:39:02,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?

2393
02:39:04,431 --> 02:39:05,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that sucks.

2394
02:39:07,293 --> 02:39:08,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh well, what are you going to do?

2395
02:39:10,509 --> 02:39:11,430
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all you can do.

2396
02:39:11,450 --> 02:39:14,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, for one, don't download child pornography.

2397
02:39:14,373 --> 02:39:15,274
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not good.

2398
02:39:15,455 --> 02:39:16,396
[SPEAKER_11]: That's gross.

2399
02:39:17,156 --> 02:39:18,137
[SPEAKER_06]: It's beyond gross.

2400
02:39:18,178 --> 02:39:18,778
[SPEAKER_06]: You're nasty.

2401
02:39:19,179 --> 02:39:26,186
[SPEAKER_11]: By the way, Rob, did you hear about the 12-year-old girl who shamed a guy in her room drinking off over her?

2402
02:39:26,547 --> 02:39:26,587
[SPEAKER_11]: Ew!

2403
02:39:27,928 --> 02:39:28,269
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

2404
02:39:28,809 --> 02:39:31,332
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it was kind of unpleasant.

2405
02:39:31,412 --> 02:39:34,576
[SPEAKER_11]: It was on the, I read it on like some news thing.

2406
02:39:35,236 --> 02:39:40,162
[SPEAKER_11]: It was like a legit news thing where this 12 year old girl says, you need to be ashamed of yourself, leave.

2407
02:39:40,943 --> 02:39:41,363
[SPEAKER_11]: And he did.

2408
02:39:42,424 --> 02:39:44,206
[SPEAKER_06]: The internet's disgusting.

2409
02:39:45,067 --> 02:39:46,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Disgusting place.

2410
02:39:46,289 --> 02:39:48,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, no, this was a real life thing, but.

2411
02:39:48,823 --> 02:39:50,586
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

2412
02:40:00,925 --> 02:40:08,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, moving on to a campaign about something that really pisses people off about the Wii U, and that is region locking.

2413
02:40:09,411 --> 02:40:22,020
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I guess some of the fans out there are hoping, you know, if Operation Rainfall worked, and Microsoft ended up reversing course on a lot of their shit, maybe, just maybe, we can get Nintendo to end region locking.

2414
02:40:22,040 --> 02:40:25,262
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're taking to Twitter, you know, because Twitter is a very effective way of protesting.

2415
02:40:25,702 --> 02:40:28,384
[SPEAKER_04]: It worked for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2416
02:40:28,604 --> 02:40:56,609
[SPEAKER_06]: and region locking and Nintendo region free are some hashtags there's let's see some posts on Miiverse as well which are actually kind of funny like I love some of these Miiverse posts I love the one of Monita with region free please that's great and then like a picture of Reggie Fils-Aimé or I guess that's supposed to be him my body is region free so it's kind of clever that they're taking to Miiverse to put some of their opinions it won't happen no it probably won't happen

2417
02:40:57,502 --> 02:41:05,745
[SPEAKER_07]: The thing is that Nintendo seems to be trying to bring over a lot of stuff that maybe in the past they wouldn't have.

2418
02:41:06,165 --> 02:41:14,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Fire Emblem is a thing that we can basically expect at this point, but also Bravely Default, that was kind of uncertain, but Nintendo is helping bring that over.

2419
02:41:16,168 --> 02:41:25,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though it would be nice if the Wii U was region-free, I think that Nintendo is really trying to listen to gamers and know that they want these games that are...

2420
02:41:26,718 --> 02:41:30,579
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2421
02:41:56,488 --> 02:41:59,155
[SPEAKER_04]: SimCity has a wonderful new piece of DLC for $9.

2422
02:41:59,335 --> 02:41:59,816
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Zeppelins.

2423
02:42:02,389 --> 02:42:06,752
[SPEAKER_04]: You get an airship and a hot air balloon park.

2424
02:42:08,393 --> 02:42:09,814
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it piloted by a guy named Sid?

2425
02:42:09,834 --> 02:42:10,495
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2426
02:42:10,775 --> 02:42:15,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Hot air balloon park and an airship mass transit option.

2427
02:42:15,939 --> 02:42:15,178
$9.

2428
02:42:15,959 --> 02:42:16,939
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all you get for $9.

2429
02:42:17,560 --> 02:42:19,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Will it explode like the Hindenburg did?

2430
02:42:19,781 --> 02:42:21,823
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, not to be in poor taste.

2431
02:42:21,843 --> 02:42:23,204
[SPEAKER_10]: Too soon, Rob.

2432
02:42:23,224 --> 02:42:23,664
[SPEAKER_10]: Too soon.

2433
02:42:23,704 --> 02:42:25,245
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks to the power of cloud processing.

2434
02:42:25,265 --> 02:42:27,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Part of SimCity is disasters, right?

2435
02:42:28,027 --> 02:42:29,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, SimCity was a disaster.

2436
02:42:29,929 --> 02:42:30,449
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

2437
02:42:32,253 --> 02:42:32,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh boy.

2438
02:42:32,633 --> 02:42:34,474
[SPEAKER_11]: It wouldn't be the same without the reporter.

2439
02:42:34,714 --> 02:42:37,035
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's go to the phones because we do have calls coming in.

2440
02:42:37,055 --> 02:42:37,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

2441
02:42:37,935 --> 02:42:38,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

2442
02:42:39,036 --> 02:42:39,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

2443
02:42:40,336 --> 02:42:40,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

2444
02:42:40,656 --> 02:42:41,377
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Codeman.

2445
02:42:41,457 --> 02:42:42,097
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Codeman.

2446
02:42:42,117 --> 02:42:42,817
[SPEAKER_06]: How you doing?

2447
02:42:43,337 --> 02:42:44,498
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't called in in a while.

2448
02:42:44,518 --> 02:42:46,018
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to say, long time no talk.

2449
02:42:46,058 --> 02:42:46,959
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind, buddy?

2450
02:42:47,239 --> 02:42:50,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, it's busy everywhere.

2451
02:42:50,660 --> 02:42:53,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Real life is not allowed to get in the way of OLR.

2452
02:42:53,081 --> 02:42:53,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thanks.

2453
02:42:54,342 --> 02:42:55,042
[SPEAKER_13]: It never does.

2454
02:42:55,282 --> 02:42:55,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Hardly.

2455
02:42:56,002 --> 02:42:56,562
[SPEAKER_13]: Good answer.

2456
02:42:56,862 --> 02:42:57,583
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind, buddy?

2457
02:42:59,143 --> 02:43:06,547
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I was just calling about the whole YouTube thing earlier because I'm your friendly neighborhood YouTuber, I guess.

2458
02:43:06,567 --> 02:43:07,487
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, you are.

2459
02:43:07,987 --> 02:43:14,090
[SPEAKER_13]: But they're actually starting to monetize for minutes watched now.

2460
02:43:14,450 --> 02:43:22,014
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's not so much your video anymore as it is the minutes of how long somebody watches your video.

2461
02:43:23,878 --> 02:43:51,489
[SPEAKER_13]: so I mean it's really I don't know they keep changing it but to say something about I believe Square Enix or Squeenix as a lot of people say is they did that for a really long time they wouldn't let anyone put any of their games up which I always see it as free advertisement for the company but I mean you're playing their game people are watching it they say oh you know this is a really good game I want to buy it so then they go out and buy it and then

2462
02:43:51,969 --> 02:43:53,050
[SPEAKER_13]: That's free advertisement.

2463
02:43:53,070 --> 02:43:54,752
[SPEAKER_13]: So to me, that's the way.

2464
02:43:54,792 --> 02:44:07,205
[SPEAKER_13]: But I see where everybody's coming from, where you're playing this game, you're claiming it as your own video, but it's actually just your voice over something else that somebody else made.

2465
02:44:07,285 --> 02:44:08,707
[SPEAKER_13]: And I can understand that, but...

2466
02:44:11,293 --> 02:44:14,837
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to call in because I missed that whole conversation.

2467
02:44:14,877 --> 02:44:19,203
[SPEAKER_13]: I had to go put the girl down to sleep.

2468
02:44:19,243 --> 02:44:22,227
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to call in and talk about that a little bit.

2469
02:44:22,487 --> 02:44:23,008
[SPEAKER_06]: No worries.

2470
02:44:23,448 --> 02:44:27,353
[SPEAKER_06]: You probably aren't surprised to hear that people make a living off those Let's Play videos though, right?

2471
02:44:28,734 --> 02:44:42,145
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, there's a lot of people out there, a lot of really, really big YouTubers that make a huge, huge killing off of just doing Let's Plays and doing... Minecraft's real big right now.

2472
02:44:42,665 --> 02:44:45,867
[SPEAKER_13]: There's just tons of people out there making so much money off of that.

2473
02:44:46,608 --> 02:44:53,733
[SPEAKER_13]: And, yeah, to an extent, you make a lot of money, but I don't really think, unless you partner with a third party...

2474
02:44:54,474 --> 02:44:57,776
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't really think, which sometimes you kind of get screwed out of that money too.

2475
02:44:57,896 --> 02:45:05,681
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, either way, if you manage yourself correctly on YouTube, I think you can make a good amount of money.

2476
02:45:05,761 --> 02:45:13,206
[SPEAKER_13]: But other than that, I do it just to do it and, you know, to show people what I'm playing and, you know, all that stuff.

2477
02:45:13,246 --> 02:45:15,908
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I don't do it for the money, obviously, because I'm not making anything from it.

2478
02:45:15,988 --> 02:45:19,030
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's just fun to do to me.

2479
02:45:19,270 --> 02:45:21,071
[SPEAKER_13]: And I love video editing and all that stuff.

2480
02:45:21,091 --> 02:45:21,291
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

2481
02:45:21,536 --> 02:45:26,451
[SPEAKER_06]: that's what's got it's like podcasting I've said this before on an earlier show if you don't love it what the hell are you doing

2482
02:45:27,059 --> 02:45:27,619
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, exactly.

2483
02:45:27,639 --> 02:45:32,323
[SPEAKER_13]: If you get into YouTube to make money, you're getting into the wrong reasons.

2484
02:45:32,824 --> 02:45:36,527
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like those companies that are like, we need to hire an agency to make a viral video.

2485
02:45:37,647 --> 02:45:39,189
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't force something to go viral.

2486
02:45:39,209 --> 02:45:40,650
[SPEAKER_06]: That has to happen.

2487
02:45:40,730 --> 02:45:41,130
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, no.

2488
02:45:41,250 --> 02:45:42,631
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's totally true.

2489
02:45:43,933 --> 02:45:44,293
[SPEAKER_13]: That's great.

2490
02:45:44,373 --> 02:45:51,679
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, and I also wanted to say, you will have a buffer from a one-year-old... Well, actually, from a...

2491
02:45:52,179 --> 02:45:59,963
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, she'll be two probably by the time that I make the buffer, but I got her to say orange today, but she has to put all of them together.

2492
02:46:00,023 --> 02:46:02,064
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't got... Adorable!

2493
02:46:02,644 --> 02:46:05,826
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, so that should be fantastic.

2494
02:46:06,266 --> 02:46:07,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Excited to hear it.

2495
02:46:08,227 --> 02:46:08,527
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

2496
02:46:09,368 --> 02:46:11,349
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I think that's about it, really.

2497
02:46:12,250 --> 02:46:17,593
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I mean, yeah, I was up late tonight, so I thought I'd give you guys a call because I haven't talked to you in a while.

2498
02:46:17,613 --> 02:46:18,734
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm glad you did.

2499
02:46:19,034 --> 02:46:20,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, always good to hear from you.

2500
02:46:21,436 --> 02:46:22,196
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good to hear from you.

2501
02:46:22,237 --> 02:46:25,599
[SPEAKER_06]: You take care, and I hope everybody's doing well out there in Oklahoma.

2502
02:46:25,639 --> 02:46:29,621
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad to see you've been okay throughout all the – I mean, here I am bitching about the heat.

2503
02:46:29,641 --> 02:46:30,762
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob, that was a bad pun.

2504
02:46:30,842 --> 02:46:31,943
[SPEAKER_06]: At least I don't have – what?

2505
02:46:32,083 --> 02:46:33,184
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't even – Please, okay.

2506
02:46:33,204 --> 02:46:33,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2507
02:46:33,584 --> 02:46:34,265
[SPEAKER_06]: God, shut up.

2508
02:46:34,745 --> 02:46:39,948
[SPEAKER_06]: At least I don't have these tornadoes running through my backyard, so I'm glad to hear you're alright with all that.

2509
02:46:40,449 --> 02:46:41,930
[SPEAKER_13]: We're getting the heat right now, too.

2510
02:46:42,790 --> 02:46:52,517
[SPEAKER_13]: I think today we got probably a high of 101, which is not a whole... I mean, it's not big here, but I mean, we're not getting tornadoes, and that's all that we care about.

2511
02:46:52,657 --> 02:46:58,401
[SPEAKER_13]: Although I am getting a shelter put in in September, I think, so... Phew, that's good.

2512
02:46:58,861 --> 02:47:02,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, buddy, I'm gonna let you go so we can get more calls, but stay safe.

2513
02:47:03,340 --> 02:47:07,101
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, you guys, keep making the podcast for another 16 years.

2514
02:47:07,301 --> 02:47:07,742
[SPEAKER_13]: How about that?

2515
02:47:07,822 --> 02:47:08,322
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll try.

2516
02:47:08,782 --> 02:47:09,362
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2517
02:47:09,622 --> 02:47:10,423
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we'll see you.

2518
02:47:10,523 --> 02:47:10,963
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, bye.

2519
02:47:11,523 --> 02:47:12,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

2520
02:47:12,843 --> 02:47:14,324
[SPEAKER_06]: In 16 years, I will be 50.

2521
02:47:14,584 --> 02:47:17,085
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know about that.

2522
02:47:17,145 --> 02:47:17,665
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we'll see.

2523
02:47:17,725 --> 02:47:19,286
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's go to some more calls.

2524
02:47:19,726 --> 02:47:20,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Phone's ringing tonight.

2525
02:47:20,726 --> 02:47:21,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

2526
02:47:21,667 --> 02:47:22,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

2527
02:47:23,307 --> 02:47:24,127
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Zorme.

2528
02:47:24,528 --> 02:47:25,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Zorme.

2529
02:47:25,248 --> 02:47:25,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Zorme.

2530
02:47:26,008 --> 02:47:27,549
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think... Have you called the show before?

2531
02:47:27,689 --> 02:47:28,329
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't recognize your name.

2532
02:47:29,471 --> 02:47:31,693
[SPEAKER_06]: I call him a few times back in the day.

2533
02:47:32,033 --> 02:47:32,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, back in the day.

2534
02:47:32,914 --> 02:47:33,675
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, welcome back.

2535
02:47:33,735 --> 02:47:34,435
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind, buddy?

2536
02:47:36,777 --> 02:47:42,322
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you guys are average gamers of Final Fantasy XI, and now that Final Fantasy XIV has come out...

2537
02:47:43,348 --> 02:47:44,389
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like it's going to be pretty good.

2538
02:47:44,429 --> 02:47:45,129
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been playing it.

2539
02:47:45,249 --> 02:47:46,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you guys?

2540
02:47:46,891 --> 02:47:47,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

2541
02:47:47,531 --> 02:47:48,852
[SPEAKER_06]: You might have missed the beginning of the show.

2542
02:47:48,892 --> 02:47:50,273
[SPEAKER_06]: I was talking a bit about it.

2543
02:47:50,833 --> 02:47:51,214
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all right.

2544
02:47:51,574 --> 02:47:54,916
[SPEAKER_06]: We actually, all of us, except Slidekick, you haven't been able to play it, right?

2545
02:47:55,236 --> 02:47:57,738
[SPEAKER_07]: No, not lately, but I did play in like an earlier phase.

2546
02:47:57,958 --> 02:47:58,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2547
02:47:58,579 --> 02:47:59,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we've all been playing it.

2548
02:48:00,080 --> 02:48:01,401
[SPEAKER_06]: I especially have been playing it.

2549
02:48:01,841 --> 02:48:02,581
[SPEAKER_06]: I really love it.

2550
02:48:03,022 --> 02:48:11,968
[SPEAKER_06]: I have two classes at 16 on my character that's going to get deleted in a week anyway, but I'm having a lot of fun just exploring this gorgeous game that's very fanservice-y.

2551
02:48:13,238 --> 02:48:17,674
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you said that they're going to delete your character.

2552
02:48:17,755 --> 02:48:18,678
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think that's official.

2553
02:48:20,703 --> 02:48:28,165
[SPEAKER_06]: It's out there that right now we're in what's called Beta Phase 3, and they have said that they're going to wipe the characters at the end of Beta Phase 3.

2554
02:48:28,785 --> 02:48:30,686
[SPEAKER_06]: We just don't know when the end is.

2555
02:48:31,066 --> 02:48:41,468
[SPEAKER_06]: But before the official release of the game, there is another character wipe slotted because there's going to be Beta Phase 4, which is open beta, where everybody's going to get to play.

2556
02:48:41,688 --> 02:48:44,589
[SPEAKER_06]: And they did say about Beta Phase 4 that they're going to try...

2557
02:48:45,629 --> 02:49:14,300
[SPEAKER_06]: and let those characters carry into the live game but they did clearly say so that people don't bitch about it if it happens another character wipe at the end of all the betas still may have to occur so we may still be looking at two character wipes so don't get too attached to your character but that's I mean considering they haven't even opened up Arcanist as a job yet and I mean you have to I think have a 1.0 character or something I mean considering we don't have all of that in there yet I'm okay with them I mean it is a beta it is a beta not a demo

2558
02:49:15,583 --> 02:49:17,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yeah, that's the whole thing.

2559
02:49:17,225 --> 02:49:25,494
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I've been enjoying playing different characters and it's been quite fun because there's just so many different customizations.

2560
02:49:26,455 --> 02:49:29,479
[SPEAKER_08]: And that whole, what do you think about the free company?

2561
02:49:29,699 --> 02:49:31,401
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I want because a lot of people...

2562
02:49:32,270 --> 02:49:35,613
[SPEAKER_08]: See that you have link shells as well, but there's no need for them because you have free company.

2563
02:49:35,673 --> 02:49:38,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I haven't been able to test that yet because I don't even really understand it.

2564
02:49:39,676 --> 02:49:45,822
[SPEAKER_06]: You have the link shells or the little sub guilds, but then the free company is like your huge chat channel, right?

2565
02:49:45,862 --> 02:49:48,704
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like you have big guilds and little guilds as a part of that, right?

2566
02:49:49,585 --> 02:49:49,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

2567
02:49:49,985 --> 02:49:55,050
[SPEAKER_08]: It's basically like you're able to go ahead and

2568
02:49:56,658 --> 02:50:08,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Make a group of people a little bit more organized where you can have like cadets and I'm not too sure, but like people who are in your officers, you have like cadets and you have like commanders, some sort of thing like that.

2569
02:50:08,524 --> 02:50:11,646
[SPEAKER_08]: And they can basically distribute money and kill and.

2570
02:50:12,677 --> 02:50:16,739
[SPEAKER_08]: based off of like their prestige inside the link shell, I mean inside the free company.

2571
02:50:17,319 --> 02:50:23,243
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know exactly on too much detail about it, but it's more than just a glorified link shell though.

2572
02:50:23,463 --> 02:50:30,707
[SPEAKER_06]: My understanding, especially coming from World of Warcraft, which I've played for a long time and I'm still continuing to play even throughout Final Fantasy XIV,

2573
02:50:31,647 --> 02:50:35,610
[SPEAKER_06]: You had a lot of big guilds in World of Warcraft that had several raiding groups in it.

2574
02:50:35,670 --> 02:50:44,517
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, my own guild for a time that I was raiding with had, infamously to an extent, two raiding groups in it, Raid Group 1 and Raid Group 2, and that actually is what kind of drove that guild apart.

2575
02:50:44,937 --> 02:50:54,344
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would think that maybe with a free company set up, you would still have that, but then each raid team would have its own little link shell in it for raid nights and stuff like that.

2576
02:50:55,645 --> 02:50:57,146
[SPEAKER_06]: It's interesting, though, the way they're doing that.

2577
02:50:58,240 --> 02:51:05,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I do think it's going to be great for organization, because I don't know how... Well, I do know, actually.

2578
02:51:05,443 --> 02:51:11,165
[SPEAKER_08]: You played Final Fantasy XI, but you didn't play it to the extent where you were in an endgame.

2579
02:51:11,325 --> 02:51:12,886
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I never got that far.

2580
02:51:12,926 --> 02:51:15,407
[SPEAKER_06]: I played for years and never got a character past 56.

2581
02:51:15,527 --> 02:51:17,768
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was the highest I ever got.

2582
02:51:17,788 --> 02:51:18,408
[SPEAKER_06]: It's crazy.

2583
02:51:20,689 --> 02:51:27,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Me, I had a couple of jobs, like level 75, and it was kind of difficult distributing...

2584
02:51:28,234 --> 02:51:34,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Skill and prizes and drops throughout the several instances like Dynamis and stuff like that.

2585
02:51:34,317 --> 02:51:39,540
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it'll make it a lot easier for people to just know who is who going forward.

2586
02:51:39,800 --> 02:51:48,925
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a little bit worried because it's a lot of jobs and things can get nerfed, like how Lancer got nerfed when Samurai Dragoon tend to go out of hand.

2587
02:51:49,125 --> 02:51:51,466
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think you remember that with the Pentathrust.

2588
02:51:51,687 --> 02:51:52,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, I do.

2589
02:51:52,947 --> 02:51:53,768
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so it's...

2590
02:51:54,775 --> 02:51:55,999
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, I'm still waiting.

2591
02:51:56,200 --> 02:51:57,985
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we'll see how things go.

2592
02:51:59,993 --> 02:52:01,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you play the first one?

2593
02:52:01,894 --> 02:52:02,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I did play 1.0.

2594
02:52:04,115 --> 02:52:05,656
[SPEAKER_06]: I played at the very, very beginning.

2595
02:52:05,676 --> 02:52:12,580
[SPEAKER_06]: I played the beta for 1.0, and then I played the very, very early version, or when it first came out, and I hated it.

2596
02:52:13,280 --> 02:52:19,184
[SPEAKER_06]: And I tried playing later after they opened it up and said, all right, we're not charging a monthly fee anymore.

2597
02:52:19,204 --> 02:52:21,565
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say it was like January, February of the next year.

2598
02:52:22,105 --> 02:52:28,409
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was still like it just wasn't – it made me go back and play 11 for a little bit.

2599
02:52:28,849 --> 02:52:29,069
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

2600
02:52:29,889 --> 02:52:31,090
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I felt the same way.

2601
02:52:31,110 --> 02:52:38,813
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it was kind of weird the way the auction house wasn't available, and there was no direction.

2602
02:52:38,833 --> 02:52:39,573
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no chocobos.

2603
02:52:39,613 --> 02:52:40,333
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no direction.

2604
02:52:40,373 --> 02:52:41,034
[SPEAKER_06]: It's crazy.

2605
02:52:41,354 --> 02:52:48,416
[SPEAKER_06]: But okay, quickly, before I let you go, since you were a player of XI for so long, what do you think of XIV, having come from XI?

2606
02:52:49,317 --> 02:52:50,997
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm excited.

2607
02:52:51,338 --> 02:52:57,400
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm taking my time, you know, because, you know, when I played XI, I didn't really know what I was

2608
02:52:57,836 --> 02:53:02,180
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm playing as many jobs as possible on several different servers and just trying to get a basic understanding of the game.

2609
02:53:13,519 --> 02:53:17,962
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pretty sure I want to be a scholar, so I'm hoping Arcanist is open soon.

2610
02:53:18,402 --> 02:53:22,265
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm hoping they open soon so I can see it before the real game goes live, but we'll see.

2611
02:53:22,845 --> 02:53:25,226
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, I have to let you go, but thank you so much for the call.

2612
02:53:25,286 --> 02:53:27,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Good to hear from you, and I'll always talk MMOs with people.

2613
02:53:28,628 --> 02:53:29,289
[SPEAKER_08]: No problem.

2614
02:53:29,349 --> 02:53:29,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care.

2615
02:53:29,929 --> 02:53:30,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care, buddy.

2616
02:53:30,530 --> 02:53:30,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

2617
02:53:31,771 --> 02:53:32,251
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2618
02:53:32,611 --> 02:53:32,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Good call.

2619
02:53:32,971 --> 02:53:33,912
[SPEAKER_06]: I love hearing from people.

2620
02:53:34,292 --> 02:53:37,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Tonight is people we haven't heard from in a while, apparently.

2621
02:53:38,035 --> 02:53:38,395
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2622
02:53:38,595 --> 02:53:39,496
[SPEAKER_06]: You all right over there, Loki?

2623
02:53:39,576 --> 02:53:40,076
[SPEAKER_06]: You're giggling.

2624
02:53:40,176 --> 02:53:48,022
[SPEAKER_04]: I love these Battlefield 3 animated GIFs because it just... I kind of want to play it even... GIF.

2625
02:53:48,622 --> 02:53:51,943
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to play it even more because it looks so glitchy sometimes.

2626
02:53:52,263 --> 02:53:58,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Like this guy snipes a jet and makes it blow up in front of his face and nothing happens.

2627
02:53:58,446 --> 02:54:02,247
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

2628
02:54:02,287 --> 02:54:03,908
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll try to squeeze in at least one more call.

2629
02:54:04,688 --> 02:54:07,389
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to do a Twitter topic that came in here from Tigerclaw.

2630
02:54:07,989 --> 02:54:08,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Sent us a tweet.

2631
02:54:08,849 --> 02:54:09,470
[SPEAKER_06]: What is it here?

2632
02:54:10,510 --> 02:54:13,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo defends the rapid release of new Mario games.

2633
02:54:13,411 --> 02:54:14,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Although our phone lines are lighting up.

2634
02:54:14,651 --> 02:54:15,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, I'll come back to this in a minute.

2635
02:54:16,192 --> 02:54:17,892
[SPEAKER_06]: For now, let's go to the Skype line.

2636
02:54:17,932 --> 02:54:18,873
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawn Radio.

2637
02:54:18,893 --> 02:54:19,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

2638
02:54:20,993 --> 02:54:21,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

2639
02:54:21,793 --> 02:54:22,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

2640
02:54:23,234 --> 02:54:23,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, we have a web.

2641
02:54:23,734 --> 02:54:24,034
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, hey.

2642
02:54:24,054 --> 02:54:24,934
[SPEAKER_09]: How's it going?

2643
02:54:24,994 --> 02:54:25,654
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a web.

2644
02:54:25,674 --> 02:54:26,514
[SPEAKER_09]: It's DT and Gigi here.

2645
02:54:26,754 --> 02:54:28,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my gosh, you guys are together.

2646
02:54:28,315 --> 02:54:32,956
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a cam thing, though, although all I see is like half of Dark Tetsuya's head, but that's okay.

2647
02:54:33,336 --> 02:54:33,956
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up, you guys?

2648
02:54:35,316 --> 02:54:36,276
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, not a whole lot.

2649
02:54:36,316 --> 02:54:38,437
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, just been hanging out, playing a lot of games.

2650
02:54:38,657 --> 02:54:38,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2651
02:54:38,917 --> 02:54:38,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2652
02:54:39,773 --> 02:54:40,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times.

2653
02:54:40,693 --> 02:54:41,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Like what games?

2654
02:54:41,213 --> 02:54:43,294
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I got sucked into Unepic.

2655
02:54:43,414 --> 02:54:44,554
[SPEAKER_09]: That game was so fun.

2656
02:54:45,134 --> 02:54:45,635
[SPEAKER_06]: Unepic?

2657
02:54:46,135 --> 02:54:46,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2658
02:54:47,275 --> 02:54:48,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell us a little bit about that one.

2659
02:54:49,676 --> 02:54:50,376
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty fun.

2660
02:54:50,416 --> 02:54:51,996
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like a dungeon crawler.

2661
02:54:53,397 --> 02:54:53,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

2662
02:54:54,557 --> 02:54:54,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

2663
02:54:55,017 --> 02:54:57,118
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually like a Metroidvania type thing.

2664
02:54:58,418 --> 02:54:59,278
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm here for that.

2665
02:54:59,358 --> 02:55:02,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that free or is that like a Steam game?

2666
02:55:02,979 --> 02:55:03,580
[SPEAKER_09]: It's $7.99 on Steam.

2667
02:55:03,780 --> 02:55:04,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's not bad.

2668
02:55:05,080 --> 02:55:05,420
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2669
02:55:05,740 --> 02:55:06,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2670
02:55:06,160 --> 02:55:07,761
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll have to write that one down.

2671
02:55:07,921 --> 02:55:08,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.

2672
02:55:10,376 --> 02:55:13,338
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I'm looking at pictures, actually, it does look kind of neat.

2673
02:55:13,739 --> 02:55:16,701
[SPEAKER_11]: It is very Castlevania-like, with big dragons.

2674
02:55:18,162 --> 02:55:33,713
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and you can level up your character with each, there's a bar at the top that has a leveling system, and with each level you can put it into weapons or yourself to get more stamina and whatnot.

2675
02:55:34,134 --> 02:55:34,794
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty fun.

2676
02:55:34,954 --> 02:55:35,895
[SPEAKER_06]: That looks super fun.

2677
02:55:36,195 --> 02:55:38,037
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I am going to check that out.

2678
02:55:38,137 --> 02:55:38,617
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.

2679
02:55:39,835 --> 02:55:40,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2680
02:55:40,375 --> 02:55:41,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.

2681
02:55:41,176 --> 02:55:44,057
[SPEAKER_06]: So did you guys just call in to get me sucked into a new game and make me spend $8?

2682
02:55:44,097 --> 02:55:44,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2683
02:55:44,237 --> 02:55:44,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2684
02:55:47,499 --> 02:55:48,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, congrats.

2685
02:55:48,360 --> 02:55:49,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that was a plan.

2686
02:55:49,080 --> 02:55:50,841
[SPEAKER_09]: We're like, we need to suck him into another game.

2687
02:55:51,001 --> 02:55:51,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2688
02:55:51,821 --> 02:55:56,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because I haven't been talking about how I've been playing Final Fantasy XIV literally all weekend long.

2689
02:55:56,304 --> 02:55:57,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Just updated League of Legends.

2690
02:55:57,745 --> 02:55:58,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

2691
02:55:58,085 --> 02:55:59,125
[SPEAKER_06]: I got time for another one.

2692
02:55:59,145 --> 02:55:59,586
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all right.

2693
02:55:59,626 --> 02:56:01,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Bring it.

2694
02:56:01,567 --> 02:56:03,988
[SPEAKER_09]: I was trying to get into the beta, but I don't think I made it.

2695
02:56:04,228 --> 02:56:04,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Good news.

2696
02:56:04,828 --> 02:56:06,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Beta 4 is going to be open.

2697
02:56:06,309 --> 02:56:07,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone who wants to play can play it.

2698
02:56:08,749 --> 02:56:12,211
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I heard about the pricing system.

2699
02:56:12,271 --> 02:56:13,992
[SPEAKER_09]: Have they already fixed it?

2700
02:56:14,592 --> 02:56:24,097
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to pay for it yet, but when the game goes live on August 27th, I believe it's $12.95 a month is the lower tier and then like $14.95 for eight characters or something.

2701
02:56:24,817 --> 02:56:25,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't quote me on that.

2702
02:56:26,638 --> 02:56:27,779
[SPEAKER_09]: That seems pretty legit.

2703
02:56:27,859 --> 02:56:30,961
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I can work that into my budget because I want that game so bad.

2704
02:56:31,161 --> 02:56:31,981
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's going to be fun.

2705
02:56:32,962 --> 02:56:37,905
[SPEAKER_09]: I started playing Final Fantasy back when VII came out.

2706
02:56:40,246 --> 02:56:45,150
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, I was never able to really play the online ones, but I've been a fan ever since VII.

2707
02:56:47,628 --> 02:56:49,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's a lot of fan service in 14.

2708
02:56:49,189 --> 02:56:49,309
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

2709
02:56:49,409 --> 02:56:52,912
[SPEAKER_06]: There's Moogles.

2710
02:56:53,432 --> 02:56:58,135
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, you guys, you have fun, and go find another game for me to get addicted to.

2711
02:56:59,656 --> 02:57:00,777
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, take care, guys.

2712
02:57:01,377 --> 02:57:02,218
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, you too, bye.

2713
02:57:02,278 --> 02:57:02,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

2714
02:57:03,238 --> 02:57:07,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Video calls are always fun, even though I can only see like half of each of their head, but it worked.

2715
02:57:07,721 --> 02:57:08,062
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2716
02:57:10,803 --> 02:57:13,245
[SPEAKER_06]: 1877GAMEOLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2717
02:57:13,265 --> 02:57:13,886
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you say it's like?

2718
02:57:13,926 --> 02:57:15,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, can we try to fit in one more call?

2719
02:57:15,266 --> 02:57:15,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2720
02:57:15,727 --> 02:57:17,208
[SPEAKER_11]: Someone new needs to call.

2721
02:57:17,728 --> 02:57:18,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone new?

2722
02:57:18,569 --> 02:57:19,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone new.

2723
02:57:19,509 --> 02:57:19,869
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

2724
02:57:19,909 --> 02:57:20,590
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see what happens.

2725
02:57:20,930 --> 02:57:21,951
[SPEAKER_11]: I challenge you.

2726
02:57:22,771 --> 02:57:23,151
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2727
02:57:23,692 --> 02:57:25,793
[SPEAKER_11]: Listeners of OLR, be somebody new.

2728
02:57:25,813 --> 02:57:27,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Be quick because there's been a lot of people trying to get through.

2729
02:57:27,974 --> 02:57:29,915
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I'm going to allow one more call to squeeze in here.

2730
02:57:30,976 --> 02:57:31,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

2731
02:57:31,336 --> 02:57:35,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I was going to read the Tiger Claw tweet that said Nintendo defends the rapid release of new Mario games.

2732
02:57:38,610 --> 02:57:40,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Quote, who's this quote from?

2733
02:57:40,391 --> 02:58:03,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo of America Senior Director of Corporate Communications We think we're putting out the right number of Mario games based on what fans are asking for Based on what our own developers' creative visions are The key to that is as long as there's innovation occurring within the gameplay As long as there's new features Then marrying the characters and the IPs that people love is the right call from our standpoint But the phone is ringing again, so let's go to it Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio, who's this?

2734
02:58:04,142 --> 02:58:05,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, Name and Lights Name and Lights!

2735
02:58:06,363 --> 02:58:11,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, it's ironic, because your icon is just a solid black square It is?

2736
02:58:11,667 --> 02:58:18,811
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, at least that's what I'm seeing, I don't know, maybe it's not supposed to be But yeah, I do not see your name in lights That's not supposed to be Oh, oops, oh well Alright, well, what's on your mind?

2737
02:58:20,492 --> 02:58:31,839
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the first time I've listened to the show live Well, I was gonna say, I recognize your name, but I don't think you've ever called Well, DarkSakura, there you go, you got your new person Yay, thank you Well, uh, what do you think?

2738
02:58:33,674 --> 02:58:34,054
[SPEAKER_14]: Interesting.

2739
02:58:35,255 --> 02:58:38,576
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been listening to the Orange Lawns for years.

2740
02:58:39,036 --> 02:58:42,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well, and you just now were able to make it to a live show?

2741
02:58:43,117 --> 02:58:45,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually busy on Sunday nights?

2742
02:58:45,398 --> 02:58:46,358
[SPEAKER_14]: Normally I'm sleeping.

2743
02:58:46,398 --> 02:58:47,679
[SPEAKER_14]: This is flipping late for me.

2744
02:58:47,759 --> 02:58:48,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my gosh.

2745
02:58:48,579 --> 02:58:49,339
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a lot of people.

2746
02:58:49,359 --> 02:58:51,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Codeman said earlier he was staying up late.

2747
02:58:51,200 --> 02:58:55,821
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess a lot of people maybe for the 4th of July week kind of have a lot less going on.

2748
02:58:55,861 --> 02:58:56,241
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

2749
02:58:56,861 --> 02:59:00,102
[SPEAKER_14]: You may remember me from a couple of the messages I sent you privately.

2750
02:59:00,883 --> 02:59:01,423
[SPEAKER_14]: Perhaps.

2751
02:59:02,655 --> 02:59:03,656
[SPEAKER_14]: My wife passed away.

2752
02:59:03,676 --> 02:59:04,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's right.

2753
02:59:04,857 --> 02:59:06,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yes, yes, I do, I do.

2754
02:59:06,618 --> 02:59:09,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course I recognize that, and I'm very sorry to hear that.

2755
02:59:09,820 --> 02:59:11,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, yeah, we're Facebook buddies, too.

2756
02:59:11,141 --> 02:59:12,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we're all Facebook friends.

2757
02:59:12,382 --> 02:59:12,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2758
02:59:13,423 --> 02:59:16,705
[SPEAKER_14]: So, well... I just got back in the gaming again.

2759
02:59:17,005 --> 02:59:17,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah?

2760
02:59:17,806 --> 02:59:18,586
[SPEAKER_06]: And what have you been playing?

2761
02:59:20,168 --> 02:59:20,668
[SPEAKER_14]: Warcraft.

2762
02:59:21,960 --> 02:59:24,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Like old school Warcraft or World of Warcraft?

2763
02:59:24,601 --> 02:59:25,501
[SPEAKER_06]: World of Warcraft.

2764
02:59:25,981 --> 02:59:27,402
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm in the Horde House Guild.

2765
02:59:27,482 --> 02:59:27,802
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

2766
02:59:27,862 --> 02:59:29,482
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I knew you were over there in the Horde House Guild.

2767
02:59:30,043 --> 02:59:38,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for being loyal to the Horde House Guild because unfortunately a lot of people have quit WoW for things like Final Fantasy XIV or League or whatever it is.

2768
02:59:38,405 --> 02:59:38,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Or real life.

2769
02:59:39,306 --> 02:59:41,186
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean... I was off a month.

2770
02:59:41,466 --> 02:59:41,746
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

2771
02:59:42,146 --> 02:59:47,008
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, understandably so, but... I was actually sort of thinking about rebuilding my subscription except that

2772
02:59:47,785 --> 02:59:48,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you have Animal Crossing.

2773
02:59:48,866 --> 02:59:49,847
[SPEAKER_06]: I have Animal Crossing.

2774
02:59:50,227 --> 02:59:53,170
[SPEAKER_06]: What would you like to do in World of Warcraft?

2775
02:59:53,250 --> 02:59:55,131
[SPEAKER_14]: Right now I'm leveling a new monk.

2776
02:59:55,632 --> 02:59:55,972
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice.

2777
02:59:57,473 --> 03:00:00,876
[SPEAKER_14]: I deleted the monk that I was... Because my wife used to play.

2778
03:00:02,357 --> 03:00:06,281
[SPEAKER_14]: And she wanted to play, but when she had the stroke she couldn't see.

2779
03:00:08,002 --> 03:00:11,105
[SPEAKER_14]: So I spent three solid weeks...

2780
03:00:11,846 --> 03:00:13,067
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2781
03:00:38,926 --> 03:00:40,247
[SPEAKER_06]: to get your minds out of the gutter, people.

2782
03:00:40,528 --> 03:00:43,370
[SPEAKER_06]: They can ride on your back and, like, you can fly them to places.

2783
03:00:43,410 --> 03:00:44,071
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's really great.

2784
03:00:44,091 --> 03:00:50,276
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like if you have a low-level character, you're like, oh, you need to get to Thunder Bluff or a town that might be far for you to walk to.

2785
03:00:50,656 --> 03:00:51,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Get on my back.

2786
03:00:51,457 --> 03:00:52,137
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's go.

2787
03:00:52,197 --> 03:00:53,839
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was 300 flying, too.

2788
03:00:54,079 --> 03:00:55,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

2789
03:00:55,140 --> 03:00:58,943
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you had a lower-level character, you could still take him at, what, epic speed, right?

2790
03:00:59,083 --> 03:00:59,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

2791
03:00:59,824 --> 03:01:00,124
[SPEAKER_06]: You could.

2792
03:01:00,905 --> 03:01:05,468
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, so when I was off for five weeks taking care of her after the stroke...

2793
03:01:06,949 --> 03:01:13,854
[SPEAKER_14]: I upped my warcraft, and the only thing I did was farm archaeology to get the recipe.

2794
03:01:14,714 --> 03:01:14,895
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

2795
03:01:15,195 --> 03:01:19,378
[SPEAKER_14]: And she passed away three days after I got it.

2796
03:01:20,859 --> 03:01:22,240
[SPEAKER_06]: But at least you got it.

2797
03:01:23,580 --> 03:01:26,342
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I did, but I never had a chance for her to use it.

2798
03:01:26,542 --> 03:01:27,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no.

2799
03:01:27,963 --> 03:01:29,004
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry to hear that.

2800
03:01:30,345 --> 03:01:32,066
[SPEAKER_14]: So I pretty much stopped WoW.

2801
03:01:32,126 --> 03:01:34,448
[SPEAKER_14]: I deleted the monk that I leveled with her.

2802
03:01:35,669 --> 03:01:35,949
[SPEAKER_14]: Mm-hmm.

2803
03:01:36,434 --> 03:02:03,904
[SPEAKER_06]: and it was tough to get back in yeah has kind of getting in I mean I hate to dwell on what might be a difficult topic but has this been a way for you to kind of help get back into you know after such a tragedy as video games kind of helped you a little bit in getting back into what might have been your routine before it took a while to get back into it because

2804
03:02:05,945 --> 03:02:14,568
[SPEAKER_14]: I was trying to play after she passed away, but I just couldn't play more than a few minutes without getting irritatedly bored and just shutting it off.

2805
03:02:15,768 --> 03:02:18,969
[SPEAKER_14]: So I didn't up my account until very recently.

2806
03:02:21,350 --> 03:02:23,691
[SPEAKER_14]: And I named a character after her.

2807
03:02:24,651 --> 03:02:27,632
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a great way to memorialize somebody.

2808
03:02:27,732 --> 03:02:29,433
[SPEAKER_06]: I know of other people that have done that in WoW.

2809
03:02:29,633 --> 03:02:30,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

2810
03:02:30,708 --> 03:02:38,836
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that even the developers, when people that they were close to that were involved in the game, they've immortalized them in the game too.

2811
03:02:39,037 --> 03:02:41,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, there's some really great memorial.

2812
03:02:41,940 --> 03:02:48,227
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, usually this is more for people that were really part of the WoW community and heavy raiders and stuff that...

2813
03:02:48,647 --> 03:02:51,529
[SPEAKER_06]: But they have set up tributes.

2814
03:02:51,590 --> 03:02:53,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Blizzard has kind of done that in the game.

2815
03:02:53,391 --> 03:02:56,574
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's some really great compilations out there on YouTube.

2816
03:02:57,034 --> 03:03:03,119
[SPEAKER_06]: I know somebody that had this for somebody that they were married to.

2817
03:03:03,419 --> 03:03:08,223
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, really great when the companies kind of do that.

2818
03:03:08,363 --> 03:03:15,869
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it just really emphasizes the community that an MMO game and what really makes those games great is the community.

2819
03:03:16,110 --> 03:03:16,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2820
03:03:17,822 --> 03:03:19,643
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's been hard.

2821
03:03:20,003 --> 03:03:21,504
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course.

2822
03:03:21,524 --> 03:03:24,325
[SPEAKER_14]: The last couple months have been ridiculously hard.

2823
03:03:24,665 --> 03:03:24,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

2824
03:03:26,005 --> 03:03:26,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.

2825
03:03:27,466 --> 03:03:42,532
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not even going to sit here and try to imagine, but you know you got friends here at OLR and at the Voice of Geeks Network and out there in Facebook land and on the internet that are trying to help you through it.

2826
03:03:42,772 --> 03:03:46,114
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope it's getting a little better every day.

2827
03:03:47,492 --> 03:03:48,194
[SPEAKER_14]: Except for today.

2828
03:03:49,637 --> 03:03:51,080
[SPEAKER_14]: I got my eviction notice today.

2829
03:03:51,240 --> 03:03:51,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god.

2830
03:03:55,396 --> 03:03:56,537
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what to say.

2831
03:03:59,738 --> 03:04:01,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Bobby should start a support group.

2832
03:04:02,339 --> 03:04:07,021
[SPEAKER_06]: I need bad news to stop happening to our listeners.

2833
03:04:08,302 --> 03:04:09,102
[SPEAKER_06]: This is bad.

2834
03:04:11,203 --> 03:04:14,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Gosh, I don't know what we can do to help.

2835
03:04:17,006 --> 03:04:17,926
[SPEAKER_14]: I knew this was coming.

2836
03:04:17,946 --> 03:04:21,247
[SPEAKER_14]: I knew when she passed away I wasn't going to be able to afford the house that we have.

2837
03:04:21,327 --> 03:04:22,368
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure, sure.

2838
03:04:24,904 --> 03:04:26,048
[SPEAKER_14]: What goes around comes around.

2839
03:04:26,088 --> 03:04:28,436
[SPEAKER_14]: So I got the eviction notice that opened a beer.

2840
03:04:30,589 --> 03:04:32,309
[SPEAKER_06]: When in doubt, when in doubt, why not?

2841
03:04:32,949 --> 03:04:33,549
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, buddy.

2842
03:04:33,950 --> 03:04:37,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we're all thinking of you, and good luck pulling through.

2843
03:04:38,991 --> 03:04:40,252
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I love the show.

2844
03:04:40,352 --> 03:04:41,212
[SPEAKER_14]: I love listening.

2845
03:04:41,352 --> 03:04:43,313
[SPEAKER_14]: I love Horde House.

2846
03:04:44,713 --> 03:04:45,733
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm an avid listener.

2847
03:04:45,793 --> 03:04:48,314
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the first time I've actually had a chance to be up this late.

2848
03:04:49,415 --> 03:04:51,635
[SPEAKER_14]: My buddy was helping me pack up some stuff tonight.

2849
03:04:52,195 --> 03:04:53,576
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the only reason why I'm still up.

2850
03:04:54,917 --> 03:04:55,677
[SPEAKER_14]: He took off.

2851
03:04:56,758 --> 03:04:59,420
[SPEAKER_14]: I just decided to turn the show on.

2852
03:04:59,460 --> 03:05:05,044
[SPEAKER_14]: I know you guys don't usually end around 12, 1 o'clock Eastern Time because I am on the East Coast.

2853
03:05:06,305 --> 03:05:09,968
[SPEAKER_14]: But I listen to you guys on a regular basis for years now.

2854
03:05:10,008 --> 03:05:11,549
[SPEAKER_14]: I just never have a chance to listen live.

2855
03:05:12,042 --> 03:05:13,043
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2856
03:05:36,121 --> 03:05:41,404
[SPEAKER_06]: I ended up getting a career I've been at for 12 years now.

2857
03:05:41,524 --> 03:05:47,927
[SPEAKER_14]: Not to get all preachy and everything, she was happiest ever as a teacher.

2858
03:05:49,628 --> 03:05:53,870
[SPEAKER_14]: She was teaching CNAs, which is Certified Nursing Assistants.

2859
03:05:54,490 --> 03:05:55,891
[SPEAKER_14]: She loved her job.

2860
03:05:56,511 --> 03:05:59,312
[SPEAKER_14]: She was an RN.

2861
03:05:59,372 --> 03:06:02,214
[SPEAKER_14]: She was two credits away from being a bachelor's.

2862
03:06:03,254 --> 03:06:12,317
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, when she lost that job because they changed the qualifications for the job, I just simply told her that it's like, you know what, I'll support you.

2863
03:06:12,717 --> 03:06:13,838
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll do whatever it takes.

2864
03:06:14,818 --> 03:06:21,580
[SPEAKER_14]: Just, you know, go back to school, get your education and get more education than the person that just fired you.

2865
03:06:24,478 --> 03:06:25,799
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's what she was going to do.

2866
03:06:26,660 --> 03:06:32,605
[SPEAKER_14]: She was... Sorry, but... No, I understand.

2867
03:06:35,848 --> 03:06:36,688
[SPEAKER_14]: Cinco de Mayo.

2868
03:06:39,531 --> 03:06:40,832
[SPEAKER_15]: She wanted to go back to the school.

2869
03:06:43,717 --> 03:06:47,258
[SPEAKER_06]: She was supposed to start school on the 5th and I told her that the module wasn't going to open up on the 5th because it was a holiday Um

2870
03:07:14,170 --> 03:07:18,503
[SPEAKER_15]: She went to school on Monday and passed away on Tuesday.

2871
03:07:28,035 --> 03:07:33,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you're getting the world's biggest hug from our chat room right now for this, you know, all over the place.

2872
03:07:33,859 --> 03:07:43,445
[SPEAKER_06]: But how great that you were helping her to achieve this and, you know, come out of the circumstance better.

2873
03:07:43,725 --> 03:07:47,287
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know wherever she is right now, she's thanking you big time for it.

2874
03:07:49,548 --> 03:07:51,550
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been a really horrible two months.

2875
03:07:53,651 --> 03:07:57,574
[SPEAKER_14]: I was glad May was over with, but June is just... June's gone.

2876
03:07:58,194 --> 03:08:01,236
[SPEAKER_14]: It is July, isn't it?

2877
03:08:02,597 --> 03:08:02,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Tomorrow.

2878
03:08:03,338 --> 03:08:04,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, today for East Coast.

2879
03:08:05,259 --> 03:08:09,382
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's just... She went back to school one day.

2880
03:08:13,765 --> 03:08:15,306
[SPEAKER_06]: But you helped her get back to school.

2881
03:08:15,887 --> 03:08:17,868
[SPEAKER_06]: You did.

2882
03:08:18,228 --> 03:08:19,850
[SPEAKER_14]: All she wanted to do was become a teacher.

2883
03:08:22,414 --> 03:08:22,735
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

2884
03:08:22,755 --> 03:08:23,656
[SPEAKER_06]: My mom was a teacher.

2885
03:08:26,018 --> 03:08:26,779
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a great profession.

2886
03:08:26,839 --> 03:08:28,000
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually a corporate trainer.

2887
03:08:28,641 --> 03:08:29,521
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a great profession.

2888
03:08:29,581 --> 03:08:30,923
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an admirable thing.

2889
03:08:30,963 --> 03:08:31,643
[SPEAKER_06]: I love my job.

2890
03:08:32,324 --> 03:08:33,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely love my job.

2891
03:08:34,306 --> 03:08:35,928
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I'm going to let you go.

2892
03:08:36,148 --> 03:08:36,328
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.

2893
03:08:37,229 --> 03:08:43,055
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll try to listen again live again when the dust settles.

2894
03:08:44,716 --> 03:08:46,358
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'll stay in touch.

2895
03:08:46,874 --> 03:08:47,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, please do stay in touch.

2896
03:08:47,835 --> 03:08:48,635
[SPEAKER_11]: Message me on Facebook.

2897
03:08:49,156 --> 03:08:49,396
[SPEAKER_06]: I will.

2898
03:08:49,656 --> 03:08:49,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2899
03:08:50,076 --> 03:08:50,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, you take care.

2900
03:08:50,957 --> 03:08:51,678
[SPEAKER_06]: We're all thinking of you.

2901
03:08:52,058 --> 03:08:52,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye.

2902
03:08:52,538 --> 03:08:52,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

2903
03:08:54,039 --> 03:08:54,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, how's that?

2904
03:08:56,061 --> 03:08:56,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Tough call.

2905
03:08:56,962 --> 03:09:00,965
[SPEAKER_06]: I need someone to cut... Quick, Loki, I need a fart joke.

2906
03:09:01,105 --> 03:09:01,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Quick.

2907
03:09:02,466 --> 03:09:03,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Help me.

2908
03:09:03,987 --> 03:09:05,388
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what?

2909
03:09:05,448 --> 03:09:06,449
[SPEAKER_11]: I have happy-happies.

2910
03:09:07,150 --> 03:09:20,892
[SPEAKER_06]: because look at the chat room I mean yeah for real seriously for real and you know there's even I'm sure a lot of people are like wow that was a heavy call and yes it was a heavy call but when we say we're there for people we kind of like mean it and shit so

2911
03:09:21,810 --> 03:09:36,407
[SPEAKER_11]: and you know the biggest thing that me that I like to do for people is I like to find if there's a tough situation I like to find research everything that has to do with it and offer options because especially when you're in the middle of a situation

2912
03:09:37,308 --> 03:09:40,610
[SPEAKER_11]: There's not always things that occur to you when you're in that situation.

2913
03:09:41,351 --> 03:09:51,958
[SPEAKER_11]: And when Dan and I were... Because you know when we got our notice for the house that we were staying in rent-free, we had to move in a week.

2914
03:09:53,439 --> 03:09:57,582
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was people helping us and giving us options that opened the door for us, too.

2915
03:09:57,682 --> 03:09:57,842
[SPEAKER_11]: So...

2916
03:09:59,023 --> 03:10:07,612
[SPEAKER_11]: If you need to bounce any ideas, if you need just someone outside the situation to help you see it clearly, let me know.

2917
03:10:07,692 --> 03:10:08,233
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm happy to help.

2918
03:10:08,962 --> 03:10:10,023
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2919
03:10:34,324 --> 03:10:35,064
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2920
03:10:50,349 --> 03:11:05,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people are playing video games to kind of escape reality such as the very difficult thing that he just shared with us which is not an easy thing to get on some radio show and talk about what happened so you know I commend him for being able to do that and keeping it together even as much as he did.

2921
03:11:06,655 --> 03:11:34,522
[SPEAKER_06]: but you never know who's going to be on the other end of that game you're playing in that MMO or on that Xbox Live so you know have a little decency for each other and you know anyway just think do you want it being said to you and even more do you want it being said to someone you care about so because there's people who can take it but they don't take it when it's somebody that they care about so just think about it that way alright

2922
03:11:35,734 --> 03:11:42,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, anyhow, do we have any other last-minute stories to try and transition us back onto the video game news we were talking about earlier?

2923
03:11:43,237 --> 03:11:47,839
[SPEAKER_06]: I think... Oh, yeah, I got through the Twitter topic, which was the only one that we got, but...

2924
03:11:50,797 --> 03:11:54,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, they're selling an Earthbound Zero Reproduction NES cart.

2925
03:11:55,580 --> 03:11:56,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Gimme.

2926
03:11:56,741 --> 03:12:02,564
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, uh, an English translated ROM of, uh, you know, the game Mother.

2927
03:12:03,584 --> 03:12:05,786
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, of course it never came out over here.

2928
03:12:06,526 --> 03:12:08,287
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess it's being, um...

2929
03:12:09,488 --> 03:12:12,131
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know who's doing the reproduction of it or if it even works.

2930
03:12:13,132 --> 03:12:13,753
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2931
03:12:13,793 --> 03:12:19,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Wasn't that the one that had the anti-piracy thing that would shut down the game?

2932
03:12:19,780 --> 03:12:20,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Earthbound.

2933
03:12:21,942 --> 03:12:29,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, I know that would get harder, but I thought Earthbound Zero even had the prototype ROM was infamous for having these game-breaking bugs in it, but maybe the hackers fixed that.

2934
03:12:30,211 --> 03:12:30,712
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember.

2935
03:12:30,752 --> 03:12:31,592
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been so long.

2936
03:12:32,653 --> 03:12:37,997
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like it was so long ago that that all happened.

2937
03:12:38,017 --> 03:12:41,680
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if it actually does anything or if it's just a reproduction of the original.

2938
03:12:42,721 --> 03:12:44,242
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2939
03:12:44,562 --> 03:12:48,025
[SPEAKER_07]: I never played Mother, but I always thought it was kind of a glitchy game to begin with.

2940
03:12:48,645 --> 03:12:49,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Actual version.

2941
03:12:49,800 --> 03:12:52,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, like, you mean the Earthbound that was on the SNES here?

2942
03:12:52,523 --> 03:12:53,143
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.

2943
03:12:53,563 --> 03:12:53,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Mother.

2944
03:12:53,964 --> 03:12:55,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Mother Earthbound Zero.

2945
03:12:55,265 --> 03:12:57,967
[SPEAKER_06]: I think because it wasn't finished, it was still glitchy, yes.

2946
03:12:59,008 --> 03:12:59,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

2947
03:13:00,329 --> 03:13:00,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

2948
03:13:01,690 --> 03:13:03,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, um, that does it for the Skype line tonight.

2949
03:13:03,692 --> 03:13:04,873
[SPEAKER_06]: That does it for our Twitter topics.

2950
03:13:04,933 --> 03:13:10,678
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that did it for the, um, uh, last minute stories as well, unless you have anything else to surprise me with over there?

2951
03:13:11,699 --> 03:13:11,779
[SPEAKER_06]: No?

2952
03:13:12,739 --> 03:13:14,040
[SPEAKER_11]: I, um, no.

2953
03:13:15,040 --> 03:13:15,180
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

2954
03:13:15,621 --> 03:13:17,041
[SPEAKER_11]: I love all the Hello Kitty everywhere.

2955
03:13:18,122 --> 03:13:20,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you can thank Slidekick for some of that.

2956
03:13:21,003 --> 03:13:22,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Slidekick, I want to thank you for being here.

2957
03:13:22,724 --> 03:13:24,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much for having me.

2958
03:13:24,464 --> 03:13:29,647
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I've been listening for years, and I'm so glad that I finally was able to come up and get on the show.

2959
03:13:29,667 --> 03:13:30,327
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll take you 11 years.

2960
03:13:30,927 --> 03:13:43,251
[SPEAKER_06]: and you really got to run the gauntlet of an OLR show tonight from the dick and fart jokes and the stuff at the beginning to some real heavy stuff there at the end so it's like you got a whole two years worth of OLR emotions in one show so congratulations.

2961
03:13:43,271 --> 03:13:45,051
[SPEAKER_07]: We know every gamer has their voice here so.

2962
03:13:45,531 --> 03:13:47,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, yes that's what we strive for.

2963
03:13:48,293 --> 03:13:49,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Best of luck with your project.

2964
03:13:49,494 --> 03:13:50,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations.

2965
03:13:50,155 --> 03:13:51,977
[SPEAKER_06]: You've made it a year on Gamebuoy.org.

2966
03:13:51,997 --> 03:13:53,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

2967
03:13:54,360 --> 03:13:56,903
[SPEAKER_06]: I look forward to sharing the stage with you at GamerX.

2968
03:13:56,983 --> 03:13:57,764
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be a lot of fun.

2969
03:13:58,104 --> 03:13:58,885
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be my honor.

2970
03:13:59,085 --> 03:14:00,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody else, aw, shucks.

2971
03:14:01,268 --> 03:14:02,229
[SPEAKER_06]: One more time with the plugs.

2972
03:14:02,269 --> 03:14:03,290
[SPEAKER_06]: How can they find your fine show?

2973
03:14:03,550 --> 03:14:05,071
[SPEAKER_07]: GameBooey.org GameBooey.org GameBooey.org

2974
03:14:25,720 --> 03:14:26,681
[SPEAKER_07]: We love OLR.

2975
03:14:26,701 --> 03:14:28,442
[SPEAKER_07]: We love all our OLR listeners.

2976
03:14:28,702 --> 03:14:31,424
[SPEAKER_07]: We're usually in chat when OLR is going on.

2977
03:14:31,504 --> 03:14:36,588
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you haven't checked us out yet, we'd love to hear from you and hope you enjoy what you hear.

2978
03:14:37,228 --> 03:14:39,870
[SPEAKER_06]: We love indie podcasts, period.

2979
03:14:40,050 --> 03:14:47,576
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't want to sound shady or anything, but do you think some of the corporate casts out there could have done some of these calls we did tonight?

2980
03:14:47,656 --> 03:14:47,936
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

2981
03:14:48,857 --> 03:14:51,418
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the difference, y'all.

2982
03:14:51,438 --> 03:14:52,059
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the difference.

2983
03:14:52,691 --> 03:14:58,396
[SPEAKER_07]: We might have to get Alan in here because TimTRP in chat says we demand a Fabulous Flames reunion show.

2984
03:14:58,516 --> 03:14:59,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's Alan?

2985
03:15:00,157 --> 03:15:01,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I think he ran outside or something.

2986
03:15:02,439 --> 03:15:02,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn.

2987
03:15:02,879 --> 03:15:03,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Braving the heat.

2988
03:15:04,560 --> 03:15:07,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe he's trying to figure out how to make it cooler in here.

2989
03:15:07,563 --> 03:15:08,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Here he is.

2990
03:15:09,604 --> 03:15:11,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Alan, when's the Fabulous Flames reunion show?

2991
03:15:11,886 --> 03:15:13,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely look that up on iTunes, y'all.

2992
03:15:15,529 --> 03:15:18,371
[SPEAKER_12]: It's one week after I win $50 billion in the lottery.

2993
03:15:20,473 --> 03:15:21,393
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to win the lottery.

2994
03:15:21,454 --> 03:15:22,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay.

2995
03:15:23,675 --> 03:15:23,955
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2996
03:15:24,815 --> 03:15:25,115
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

2997
03:15:25,475 --> 03:15:28,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Alan, did you have a final thought for the listeners tonight before you run out?

2998
03:15:29,557 --> 03:15:33,139
[SPEAKER_12]: I still think it may actually be a few degrees hotter outside than it is in here.

2999
03:15:33,872 --> 03:15:36,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet Jesus, when did I move to Phoenix?

3000
03:15:37,755 --> 03:15:40,077
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what's happening, by the way, next Sunday for me?

3001
03:15:40,878 --> 03:15:41,959
[SPEAKER_11]: We are on the house hunt.

3002
03:15:42,339 --> 03:15:42,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, good luck.

3003
03:15:43,340 --> 03:15:47,324
[SPEAKER_11]: Which may end up being a new dedicated studio.

3004
03:15:47,564 --> 03:15:49,265
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be nice, I'm not going to complain.

3005
03:15:50,246 --> 03:15:51,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Wish us luck.

3006
03:15:51,387 --> 03:15:54,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts so we can wrap up and head on out of here.

3007
03:15:54,790 --> 03:15:56,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, Slykick, thank you for being here.

3008
03:15:56,151 --> 03:15:57,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have an official final thought for our listeners tonight?

3009
03:15:59,374 --> 03:16:00,235
[SPEAKER_07]: I want a burger.

3010
03:16:01,641 --> 03:16:03,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, so do I. I'm so hungry.

3011
03:16:03,522 --> 03:16:05,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Burgers are pretty fucking good, I gotta say.

3012
03:16:05,443 --> 03:16:06,784
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna hit the drive-thru on my way home.

3013
03:16:08,444 --> 03:16:09,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Get it, girl.

3014
03:16:10,405 --> 03:16:11,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you got 30 minutes to get to Pinkberry.

3015
03:16:11,906 --> 03:16:12,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, girl.

3016
03:16:13,687 --> 03:16:15,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, you're packing up.

3017

[SPEAKER_06]: You're ready to go.

3018
03:16:16,028 --> 03:16:19,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Good luck with all your disease and everything.

3019
03:16:19,109 --> 03:16:20,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope you're cured by next week.

3020
03:16:21,150 --> 03:16:24,032
[SPEAKER_10]: Make sure that you find those rats that gave you the bubonic plague.

3021
03:16:25,053 --> 03:16:43,635
[SPEAKER_06]: okay all right at least it's not herpes uh your final thought tonight and here's only with weather it's hot uh my final thought is that if you live in northern California you should make plans to come see Clue at the Colonial Theater in Sacramento on July 27th I'm playing Colonel Mustard it'll be fun yes I do other finally find a tie

3022
03:16:43,735 --> 03:16:44,535
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, your final thoughts tonight?

3023
03:17:10,971 --> 03:17:12,512
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually have an appetite tonight.

3024
03:17:13,073 --> 03:17:16,596
[SPEAKER_11]: I had French toast this morning and I thought I wouldn't be hungry all day.

3025
03:17:16,716 --> 03:17:17,697
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm actually hungry right now.

3029
03:17:28,866 --> 03:17:32,348
[SPEAKER_06]: It's much more than just some silly little radio show with a bunch of dick and fart jokes.

3030
03:17:32,488 --> 03:17:33,890
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope tonight's show proved that for you all.

3031
03:17:34,370 --> 03:17:36,211
