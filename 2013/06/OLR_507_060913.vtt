00:00.000 --> 00:19.920
Today, June 9th, 2013, Microsoft's controversial announcements could change the industry forever.

00:19.920 --> 00:25.040
Zinga layoffs affect a developer they recently acquired, and E3 is next week and we're making

00:25.040 --> 00:32.400
our predictions for the big show.

00:32.400 --> 00:35.560
Hello everybody out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.560 --> 00:37.640
where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.640 --> 00:44.960
It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 507 for this June 9th of 2013.

00:44.960 --> 00:49.240
My name is Rob Roberts, joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:49.240 --> 00:50.240
Greetings and salutations.

00:50.240 --> 00:53.100
And I hope you're doing well, Ms. Summers.

00:53.100 --> 00:54.100
I am.

00:54.100 --> 00:55.100
I'm good.

00:55.100 --> 00:56.100
I'm caffeinated.

00:56.100 --> 00:57.100
Thank you, Rob.

00:57.100 --> 00:58.100
Good to hear.

00:58.100 --> 00:59.100
And also joining us tonight, Techmaster Loki.

00:59.100 --> 01:03.900
Yes, definitely working in that Techmaster moniker this week.

01:03.900 --> 01:04.900
How so?

01:04.900 --> 01:05.900
Quickly.

01:05.900 --> 01:06.900
I had to fix my laptop.

01:06.900 --> 01:07.900
Oh, yeah.

01:07.900 --> 01:08.900
Hard drive crash.

01:08.900 --> 01:11.820
Yeah, I've been following your tweets, your Twitters, and all the hard drive drama.

01:11.820 --> 01:15.620
But now it works pretty much like it did before.

01:15.620 --> 01:17.620
All it needed was a little reformat.

01:17.620 --> 01:21.540
All the non-essential stuff's not working, like some of these touch buttons up the top

01:21.540 --> 01:27.020
here that I never use, or, you know, the icon's different now for the volume up and

01:27.020 --> 01:28.020
down.

01:28.020 --> 01:29.020
But, eh, whatever.

01:29.020 --> 01:30.020
All right.

01:30.020 --> 01:31.020
Big week this week.

01:31.020 --> 01:32.780
E3, obviously, coming up.

01:32.780 --> 01:35.180
Unfortunately, none of us attending this year.

01:35.180 --> 01:39.160
Bobby Blackwolf from The Voice of Geeks Network at vognetwork.com, he is attending.

01:39.160 --> 01:43.860
And if you haven't already checked it out, do check out the interactive coverage of E3,

01:43.860 --> 01:49.140
presented in an all-new way at the voice of geeksnetwork of e3.vognetwork.com, or at least

01:49.140 --> 01:50.140
we think it's an all-new way.

01:50.140 --> 01:51.140
The internet's a big place.

01:52.140 --> 01:53.140
Probably.

01:53.140 --> 01:54.140
But very cool.

01:54.140 --> 01:55.140
I haven't seen it.

01:55.140 --> 01:58.780
Bobby will be on the show later to tell us a little more about that and participate with

01:58.780 --> 02:03.340
us on something else, but I will table that until Part B. It's obviously a very big show

02:03.340 --> 02:04.340
tonight.

02:04.340 --> 02:05.980
There is a lot going on in the gaming world.

02:05.980 --> 02:09.340
Usually we do a kickoff topic, but I think tonight we need to address the pink elephant

02:09.340 --> 02:10.800
in the room.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.100
Let's get into it, Loki.

02:12.100 --> 02:20.540
So after the whole, well, I guess the promise was after the Xbox One press event thing that

02:20.580 --> 02:27.100
they did back in May, that there was going to be some answers about, or clarification

02:27.100 --> 02:35.300
I guess, on the big hot topics that they were getting grilled on after the event, basically.

02:35.300 --> 02:38.540
What is the deal with the online connectivity?

02:38.540 --> 02:40.620
How often do I need to connect to the internet?

02:40.620 --> 02:43.580
How is the used game thing going to work?

02:43.580 --> 02:49.220
And what's up with the Kinect having to be online all the time, or attached to your system

02:49.220 --> 02:50.540
at all times of work?

02:50.540 --> 02:54.540
So on Friday, I think it was Friday, was it Friday?

02:54.540 --> 02:55.540
Yeah, the 6th.

02:55.540 --> 02:58.140
On Friday, no, that was Thursday.

02:58.140 --> 03:06.180
Anyways, on the 6th, they released a three page document, if you will, called Xbox One

03:06.180 --> 03:13.260
Details on Connectivity, Licensing, and Privacy Features.

03:13.260 --> 03:17.300
So let's just go through each one, shall we?

03:17.300 --> 03:24.580
First, Xbox One, a modern connected device.

03:24.580 --> 03:30.100
And to kind of spoil everything, none of this stuff is actually sounding any good.

03:30.100 --> 03:36.060
It's pretty much just reinforcing what we already have heard, that they said, oh, we'll

03:36.060 --> 03:37.060
make change.

03:37.060 --> 03:41.300
So the Xbox One will deliver new benefits for gamers that are only possible with a system

03:41.300 --> 03:43.620
designed from the ground up to be ready and connected.

03:43.620 --> 03:45.740
Here are a few examples.

03:45.740 --> 03:48.100
First generation games powered by the cloud.

03:48.100 --> 03:54.860
So you'll be able to use the cloud servers to make your game more powerful or something.

03:54.860 --> 03:56.940
Your Xbox One is always ready.

03:56.940 --> 04:00.260
It's designed to run with, I guess, a low powered state.

04:00.260 --> 04:03.260
OK, let's get to the good part.

04:03.260 --> 04:09.780
Network technologies and network requirements, here we go.

04:09.780 --> 04:15.720
For an optimal experience, we recommend a broadband connection of 1.5 megabits.

04:15.720 --> 04:24.280
And also, in areas where, I guess, an ethernet connection is not available, you can connect

04:24.280 --> 04:26.240
using mobile broadband.

04:26.240 --> 04:27.480
Lucky you.

04:27.480 --> 04:31.940
And also, while a persistent connection is not required, the Xbox One is designed to

04:31.940 --> 04:37.480
verify if the system application or game updates are needed, and to see if you have acquired

04:37.480 --> 04:44.160
new games, resold or traded in games, or have given a game to a friend.

04:44.160 --> 04:48.960
Games that are designed to take advantage of the cloud system may require a connection.

04:48.960 --> 04:53.360
And then, of course, with Xbox One, you can game offline for up to 24 hours on your primary

04:53.360 --> 04:58.400
console or one hour if you're logged into a separate console accessing your library.

04:58.400 --> 05:04.720
Offline gaming is not possible after these prescribed times until you reestablish a connection,

05:04.720 --> 05:08.380
but you can still, oh, oh, and this is the best part, but guess what?

05:08.380 --> 05:13.600
You can still watch live TV, enjoy your Blu-ray and DVD movies.

05:13.640 --> 05:15.280
Oh, thank you, Xbox One.

05:15.280 --> 05:18.960
I can still enjoy TV that you are connected to.

05:25.200 --> 05:29.960
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to mourn the loss of the gaming industry.

05:29.960 --> 05:31.160
Rest in peace.

05:31.160 --> 05:33.440
All right, let's get to the next thing here.

05:33.440 --> 05:40.840
All right, so next, how game licensing will work on the Xbox One.

05:40.880 --> 05:44.360
And I'm glad that they have to tell me how it's gonna work.

05:44.360 --> 05:49.160
Okay, so basically, you buy the games the way you want, disc or digital, and you'll

05:49.160 --> 05:53.000
be able to buy them through traditional retailers or online through Xbox Live.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.560
And it says, disc will continue to be a great way to install your game quickly.

05:56.560 --> 06:00.520
Yes, to install, not play off of install.

06:00.520 --> 06:05.440
You can access your entire games library from any Xbox One, no discs required.

06:05.440 --> 06:09.840
Because after all, you're signing in and accessing the games that you have installed to your

06:09.840 --> 06:12.680
system or the cloud or whatever it is.

06:12.680 --> 06:16.560
You can share access with your games to everyone inside your home.

06:16.560 --> 06:20.480
Your friends, family, and your guests and acquaintances get unlimited access to all

06:20.480 --> 06:21.480
your games.

06:21.480 --> 06:25.400
Anyone can play your games on your console regardless of whether you're logged in or

06:25.400 --> 06:26.840
their relationship to you.

06:26.840 --> 06:33.400
In other words, a feature that's been available on console gaming since the beginning of time.

06:33.400 --> 06:38.440
That yes, if I bring a friend over, that they can play on the Xbox One without it going,

06:39.040 --> 06:40.040
Who are you?

06:40.040 --> 06:44.840
What are you doing trying to touch my controller and play this game?

06:44.840 --> 06:47.120
Get your hands off my controller.

06:47.120 --> 06:50.000
I need an adult.

06:50.000 --> 06:57.080
You can share access, let's see, give your family access to your entire games library

06:57.080 --> 06:58.080
anytime, anywhere.

06:58.080 --> 06:59.700
Now this is kind of weird.

06:59.700 --> 07:03.640
The Xbox One, I guess, they're going to have a way where up to 10 people of your family

07:03.640 --> 07:09.920
or whoever you're seeing as your family can log in and play from your shared games library

07:09.920 --> 07:11.600
on any Xbox One.

07:11.600 --> 07:17.480
So if I buy a copy of say, Forza Motorsports or something like that, someone else can go

07:17.480 --> 07:22.720
to a friend's house or whatever or from their own location and play that copy of Forza as

07:22.720 --> 07:23.720
well.

07:23.720 --> 07:26.560
But only one person can play at a time.

07:26.560 --> 07:27.560
And not at launch.

07:27.560 --> 07:30.000
None of this is available at launch.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.880
All the good stuff, all the pros, not at launch.

07:31.920 --> 07:33.640
I don't know if that's available at launch.

07:33.640 --> 07:35.720
It doesn't say.

07:35.720 --> 07:39.440
Trade in and resell your disc based games.

07:39.440 --> 07:40.440
Okay.

07:40.440 --> 07:45.960
It says today some gamers choose to sell their old disc based games back for cash and credit.

07:45.960 --> 07:52.560
We've designed the Xbox One so game publishers can enable you to trade in your games at participating

07:52.560 --> 07:53.560
retailers.

07:53.560 --> 07:55.400
So it's an optional feature.

07:55.400 --> 07:58.560
So no eBay, gone.

07:58.560 --> 08:00.740
No flea markets, gone.

08:00.740 --> 08:02.740
No garage sales, gone.

08:02.740 --> 08:06.360
Authorized retailers only if the publisher allows it.

08:06.360 --> 08:09.420
It's now not my choice on what I'm going to do with my game.

08:09.420 --> 08:12.940
It's now Microsoft's choice or the publisher's choice on what I'm going to do with my game.

08:12.940 --> 08:13.940
But we don't own it.

08:13.940 --> 08:14.940
We're licensing it.

08:14.940 --> 08:15.940
That's right.

08:15.940 --> 08:18.460
It was never ours to begin with.

08:18.460 --> 08:21.460
I don't sign a form when I'm playing these games.

08:21.460 --> 08:24.460
Although I'm sure you're going to have to agree to it when you install your game.

08:24.460 --> 08:25.460
Oh sure.

08:25.460 --> 08:30.340
Press A to agree to the 500 page terms and conditions or you won't be able to play anything.

08:30.340 --> 08:31.740
Because things are brick.

08:31.740 --> 08:37.360
Let's see, Microsoft does not charge a platform fee to retailers, publishers, or consumers

08:37.360 --> 08:40.880
for enabling transfer of these games.

08:40.880 --> 08:44.660
Which I don't know, it kind of goes against what I've heard and what we've been hearing

08:44.660 --> 08:45.660
rumors wise.

08:45.660 --> 08:47.820
But maybe it's not Microsoft charging them.

08:47.820 --> 08:49.140
Maybe it's the publisher's charging these guys.

08:49.140 --> 08:50.340
I don't really know.

08:50.340 --> 08:51.940
Whatever that doesn't.

08:51.940 --> 08:53.500
All right.

08:53.500 --> 08:57.020
So what are the key points out of this whole thing because we got to get to the bottom

08:57.020 --> 08:58.020
line here.

08:58.020 --> 08:59.020
Well a couple more.

08:59.020 --> 09:00.020
Okay.

09:00.860 --> 09:02.940
They're going to allow you to give your games to a friend.

09:02.940 --> 09:07.460
So you can enable your disc based game, give it to a friend basically.

09:07.460 --> 09:08.940
There's no fees.

09:08.940 --> 09:12.220
But there's two requirements in order to transfer this to your friend.

09:12.220 --> 09:18.860
They have to be on your friend's list for 30 days and you can only give the game once.

09:18.860 --> 09:23.020
Once it's been transferred to them, I don't think that they can give it back to someone

09:23.020 --> 09:24.020
else.

09:24.020 --> 09:25.660
Now I don't know if that's clarified.

09:25.660 --> 09:27.580
So no wishing for more wishes?

09:27.580 --> 09:28.580
Yes.

09:28.580 --> 09:29.580
Okay.

09:29.660 --> 09:33.340
If it is where you can give it to somebody, you know, the friend's list thing is kind

09:33.340 --> 09:36.900
of annoying, but like say you can give it to them and then they can give it to somebody

09:36.900 --> 09:42.220
else, you know, that's not so bad, but it's still annoying.

09:42.220 --> 09:43.220
You know what?

09:43.220 --> 09:45.100
I will give credit where credit is due.

09:45.100 --> 09:49.020
It sounds like Microsoft's trying to implement the Kindle book borrowing thing, which just

09:49.020 --> 09:53.420
sounds a lot like, and I'm like, all right, that's cool because I know I lent out a lot

09:53.420 --> 09:54.420
of video games.

09:54.420 --> 09:55.420
I never get back.

09:55.420 --> 09:56.420
So that's interesting.

09:56.420 --> 10:01.420
It can be handled all digitally, but, um, you know, what am I having to give up?

10:01.420 --> 10:02.860
What's the minus for this plus?

10:02.860 --> 10:03.860
Right?

10:03.860 --> 10:04.860
Yeah.

10:04.860 --> 10:05.860
Okay.

10:05.860 --> 10:06.860
And last but not least, I'll just breeze through this.

10:06.860 --> 10:07.860
The connect stuff.

10:07.860 --> 10:12.200
Um, they say you're in control of where the connect can see in here because I guess you

10:12.200 --> 10:14.580
get to adjust your privacy settings or something.

10:14.580 --> 10:18.860
So the system will navigate you through key privacy options like automatic or manual sign

10:18.860 --> 10:22.260
in privacy settings and clear notification how data is used.

10:22.260 --> 10:24.540
Wait, how is data being used?

10:24.540 --> 10:27.980
So I'm assuming this thing is just going to be listening for, you know, advertising

10:27.980 --> 10:28.980
purposes and stuff.

10:28.980 --> 10:34.460
If they hear a lot of wank, a lot of porn, you're in control of what the connect or of

10:34.460 --> 10:37.860
the connect sensor, um, sensing on, off or paused.

10:37.860 --> 10:43.620
Um, you can turn off your Xbox one and um, you know, if they say it's only listening

10:43.620 --> 10:48.340
for a single voice command of Xbox on, but come on, I'm sorry.

10:48.340 --> 10:53.140
Uh, you're in control of your personal data and you can use other inputs to control your

10:53.140 --> 10:55.460
games TV and entertainment experiences.

10:55.460 --> 10:58.420
So once again, why do I need to connect, you know, attached to this thing?

10:58.420 --> 11:02.700
If I can control it with a controller, it doesn't make it's, I'm going to be honest

11:02.700 --> 11:07.560
and I'm not trying to be that snarky kid on Twitter, but I, I, I'm, this is really kind

11:07.560 --> 11:12.580
of like a, it's a vague answer that they kind of gave to this like, so, so what does it

11:12.580 --> 11:15.060
have to be on or not?

11:15.060 --> 11:19.340
Well there's, it's basically, it has to be connected to your system, but I think you

11:19.340 --> 11:23.860
can point it at the wall, you can turn your system off or something and then it won't

11:23.860 --> 11:24.860
be listening.

11:24.860 --> 11:29.100
Just don't underestimate the value of, of privacy and all that.

11:29.100 --> 11:31.820
And this is really badly timed for Microsoft.

11:31.820 --> 11:35.900
I mean, again, there's a lot of news that there's a lot of, there's a lot of news out

11:35.900 --> 11:36.900
there right now.

11:36.900 --> 11:37.900
I'm not trying to get political.

11:37.900 --> 11:41.300
I'm not going to take the show there, but there's a lot of news right now about privacy

11:41.300 --> 11:43.540
and Microsoft's names involved.

11:43.540 --> 11:44.540
Exactly.

11:44.540 --> 11:50.220
So this is not a good time to be requiring anything with that connect, just saying.

11:50.220 --> 11:52.700
And they're, they're saying that they, you know, some of the examples, of course they've

11:52.700 --> 11:57.180
mentioned before, a fitness game can measure your heart rate, give you feedback about your

11:57.180 --> 12:02.020
exercise routine or whatever, be able to tell if you're a communist, a card game could allow

12:02.020 --> 12:06.500
you to bluff your virtual opponent using your facial expressions.

12:06.500 --> 12:10.100
But once again, you know, the connect could allow you to scan in your objects and use

12:10.100 --> 12:12.020
them in real games.

12:12.020 --> 12:13.020
That never happens.

12:13.020 --> 12:14.020
So who knows?

12:14.500 --> 12:15.500
Okay, so that's it.

12:15.500 --> 12:16.500
That's basically the information.

12:16.500 --> 12:22.620
Um, well, uh, here's the thing you ever seen that show Shark Tank, you ever watched that

12:22.620 --> 12:23.620
show?

12:23.620 --> 12:24.620
Yeah.

12:24.620 --> 12:25.620
Yeah.

12:25.620 --> 12:26.620
Here's the premise of the show.

12:26.620 --> 12:28.540
These guys pitched their ideas to all these big executives.

12:28.540 --> 12:30.860
Like Mark Cuban's one of the executives that sits there.

12:30.860 --> 12:33.660
It's actually, as far as reality TV goes, it's one of the better shows.

12:33.660 --> 12:36.300
Cause it's, it's a little more like these guys are real business makers and you kind

12:36.300 --> 12:40.780
of see, like, I dunno, there, there's less of the pompousness that comes with the Donald

12:40.780 --> 12:44.540
Trump business show and there's a little more like, you know, reality, I guess for

12:44.540 --> 12:45.640
lack of a better term.

12:45.640 --> 12:49.740
But anyway, the whole kitsch kitchens, there's, they're pitching their ideas and you know,

12:49.740 --> 12:53.700
maybe it's a lady who's got a new idea for something for that women could have at their

12:53.700 --> 12:54.700
weddings or a guy.

12:54.700 --> 12:59.640
I just seem to remember an episode where a guy, uh, was selling man candles because that

12:59.640 --> 13:02.700
ended up being a thing at like Yankee Canada, one of those later on.

13:02.700 --> 13:03.700
Yeah, like mandels.

13:03.700 --> 13:07.980
Well, anyway, the whole pitch is that as you're given these ideas, if one of the executive

13:07.980 --> 13:11.700
says I'm out, that's their sign that they are not going to put a bid.

13:11.700 --> 13:15.580
And if all four of them say I'm out, the guy loses, walks away, doesn't get the financing

13:15.580 --> 13:16.580
they want.

13:16.580 --> 13:20.540
And I got to admit after listening to this, this, this whole detail thing that's, that's

13:20.540 --> 13:23.020
gone on this week, I'm kind of sitting in that chair.

13:23.020 --> 13:27.600
And when I'm hearing about the whole, here's the minuses, here's a plus in the game trading

13:27.600 --> 13:28.600
and all that.

13:28.600 --> 13:31.940
But here's all these minuses that suddenly these $60 games may not be worth anything

13:31.940 --> 13:32.940
anymore.

13:32.940 --> 13:34.900
I do not have, that's what I hate the most.

13:34.900 --> 13:37.860
I no longer have the power to sell this game on eBay.

13:37.860 --> 13:41.340
If I want to do it, I have to go to a GameStop or a comparable store.

13:41.340 --> 13:42.520
Are you kidding me?

13:42.520 --> 13:43.740
That's not what I want.

13:43.740 --> 13:46.980
And that's the point where I said, I'm out.

13:46.980 --> 13:50.820
And on top of that, the plus is like, Oh, you can loan it to your friend.

13:50.820 --> 13:55.740
Something I can do already right now with all these fucking restrictions and why, why

13:55.740 --> 13:58.200
do I even, and that's the thing.

13:58.200 --> 14:01.980
It's so sad that this has to happen because I want to be excited about this new console.

14:01.980 --> 14:06.620
I wanted to be excited about the games that they're coming out with, but I'm sorry.

14:06.620 --> 14:09.780
Even if there's like a new crackdown game or whatever, the big awesome game they're

14:09.780 --> 14:13.860
going to show is all this stuff is just like right in front of me and it's like, well,

14:13.860 --> 14:17.060
that sounds cool, but nope.

14:17.060 --> 14:20.100
To me, it's very much like how I treat origin.

14:20.100 --> 14:22.060
Battlefield 3 looks fucking amazing.

14:22.060 --> 14:23.620
I really want to play that game.

14:23.620 --> 14:27.340
I'm not installing origin, so therefore I'm not going to play the game.

14:27.340 --> 14:28.340
That's it.

14:28.340 --> 14:29.340
I mean, it's unfortunate.

14:29.340 --> 14:33.820
These games look awesome, but all this stuff stands in my way, so I'm not going to do it.

14:33.820 --> 14:39.420
For me, a lot of it is kind of about control and I feel like what's happening this console

14:39.420 --> 14:44.940
generation that I just don't fucking like is that the publishers are trying to take

14:44.940 --> 14:50.700
all these things away from me that I used to get as the investor in the game.

14:50.700 --> 14:51.900
You know what I mean?

14:51.900 --> 14:56.860
Like I used to be able to sell the used games and, you know, trade the games I wanted to

14:56.860 --> 14:58.340
and they could put in the disc or whatever.

14:58.340 --> 15:02.020
Like the publishers have been slowly thinking of ways to take that away and I just don't

15:02.020 --> 15:03.020
like it.

15:03.020 --> 15:09.940
I understand the cost of developing a game is super expensive and all that, but the line's

15:09.940 --> 15:10.940
got to be drawn somewhere.

15:10.940 --> 15:12.580
It doesn't have to be super expensive.

15:12.580 --> 15:17.980
They decided to go big and, you know, big and bold, I guess, for their games.

15:17.980 --> 15:18.980
It doesn't have to be.

15:18.980 --> 15:21.220
Indie games that come out are still just as good.

15:21.220 --> 15:23.020
How much does it cost to develop Minecraft?

15:23.020 --> 15:27.340
Granted, it's not as visually stunning as something else, but it doesn't have to be

15:27.340 --> 15:28.340
visually stunning.

15:28.340 --> 15:29.340
It just has to be fun.

15:29.340 --> 15:30.340
It has to be fun to play.

15:30.340 --> 15:31.740
That's all it has to be.

15:31.740 --> 15:32.980
Let me go to the chatroom.

15:32.980 --> 15:37.260
Lots and lots of folks chatting on this and I don't want to ignore you guys, live.vognetwork.com

15:37.260 --> 15:41.020
where we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern

15:41.020 --> 15:45.300
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show as the Voice of the Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

15:45.300 --> 15:48.980
YYR in chat starting us off tonight saying, Rob, this is the way the industry wants to

15:48.980 --> 15:49.980
move.

15:49.980 --> 15:53.380
I understand that, that this is the way the industry wants to move, but I have a right

15:53.380 --> 15:57.180
to say I'm not moving with it and I think we all have that right.

15:57.180 --> 16:00.180
Well, the industries don't determine what the consumers do.

16:00.180 --> 16:02.780
The consumers determine what the industry should do.

16:02.780 --> 16:07.260
I want to make, well, I want to make an analogy to where I think this is all going, but actually

16:07.260 --> 16:11.020
first I want to address because I see numerous people in chat rooms saying, well, that's

16:11.020 --> 16:12.020
it.

16:12.020 --> 16:18.220
PS4 is for me this generation, but Monday hasn't happened yet, at least as of the taping

16:18.220 --> 16:19.220
of the show.

16:19.220 --> 16:22.300
I realized, you know, by the time some of you were hearing this on the podcast, Monday

16:22.300 --> 16:23.580
may have already happened.

16:23.580 --> 16:29.300
We don't really know where Sony's at and some of the signs point to they're going down a

16:29.300 --> 16:30.300
similar path.

16:30.300 --> 16:32.740
I think they are, but I don't think it's definitely, well, it's definitely not going to be part

16:32.740 --> 16:34.060
of their presentation.

16:34.060 --> 16:38.700
It's going to be people grilling them on it again and, I mean, look at all the stuff that's

16:38.700 --> 16:44.340
happened before, you know, before all this, this, this whole three page thing came out,

16:44.340 --> 16:50.380
there was reports going Microsoft canceled their after, you know, conference Q&A session.

16:50.380 --> 16:52.900
They canceled their one-on-one interviews.

16:52.900 --> 16:56.060
They just don't want to talk to people and then they put this stuff out and that's it.

16:56.060 --> 17:01.860
They're just leaving it at that, but on top of all this, so you first off the whole game

17:01.860 --> 17:04.620
sharing thing with your family and stuff.

17:04.620 --> 17:07.940
Don't assume for one second that they're not going to expect each one of those people to

17:07.940 --> 17:13.100
have live, you know, a paid subscription to live in order for that to happen.

17:13.100 --> 17:16.380
And so why am I having to pay money for this console?

17:16.380 --> 17:22.740
Pay money for live and like, it's like I had to pay for the privilege to be like fucked

17:22.740 --> 17:27.180
over because you want to start, you're feeling greedy or something that you feel like we're

17:27.180 --> 17:28.900
just not giving you enough money.

17:28.940 --> 17:34.340
I also just don't like the fact that the Xbox has to talk to the servers once every 24 hours

17:34.340 --> 17:38.580
because you know, it's not that I have a problem with it in theory or on paper.

17:38.580 --> 17:40.660
Like you know, I do, I play a lot of MMOs.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.980
Of course those talk to the servers.

17:42.980 --> 17:48.720
I'm not so much caring about it in principle, but the reality is what's going to happen

17:48.720 --> 17:52.820
when those servers go down because they will go down and history has shown that this is

17:52.820 --> 17:53.820
what happens.

17:53.820 --> 17:57.560
PlayStation network down for months due to a hack attack.

17:57.560 --> 18:00.860
You don't think there's kiddies out there that want to hack this new network the minute

18:00.860 --> 18:04.240
it goes up because they're angry too.

18:04.240 --> 18:07.520
Xbox live goes down for a day or two at a time.

18:07.520 --> 18:10.240
Granted, a lot of that is about maintenance, whatever.

18:10.240 --> 18:11.600
But then we see things happen.

18:11.600 --> 18:13.200
Diablo three, we can handle it.

18:13.200 --> 18:14.200
We can handle it.

18:14.200 --> 18:16.160
Crash, boom, error 37.

18:16.160 --> 18:17.500
Sim city by EA.

18:17.500 --> 18:18.500
We can handle it.

18:18.500 --> 18:19.500
We can handle it.

18:19.500 --> 18:20.500
Crash, boom.

18:20.500 --> 18:21.500
It all goes down.

18:21.500 --> 18:25.200
Xbox will go down.

18:25.200 --> 18:27.120
What happens then?

18:27.120 --> 18:31.480
You're not going to be able to convince me otherwise because history has shown it will

18:31.480 --> 18:33.760
go down and what is going to happen.

18:33.760 --> 18:39.920
Wank there is, there is no server on the face of the earth that has not, you know, that

18:39.920 --> 18:42.960
has not gone down for any period of time.

18:42.960 --> 18:46.920
I mean, I know they're saying that it's going to have a ton of, you know, they're going

18:46.920 --> 18:49.720
to have a ton of servers or virtual servers or whatever, but they're going to have to

18:49.720 --> 18:51.120
perform maintenance on these things.

18:51.120 --> 18:56.360
It's got to go down for maintenance for a certain amount of time.

18:56.360 --> 18:58.920
I mean, it's just, it's going to lock people out at some point.

18:58.920 --> 19:00.760
Can we go back to PlayStation four though?

19:00.760 --> 19:05.240
Because I do think there's a distinct possibility, at least some of this is going to be true

19:05.240 --> 19:07.080
about Sony system as well.

19:07.080 --> 19:08.080
Yeah.

19:08.080 --> 19:11.800
Um, and to which parts not sure, but it seems like maybe the game registration, especially

19:11.800 --> 19:16.320
in you, you, you told me before the show, you're banking a lot on EA's online pass and

19:16.320 --> 19:21.360
their reason to get rid of that is because they've got the buy in from Sony and Microsoft

19:21.360 --> 19:23.720
and they've given the finger to Nintendo essentially.

19:23.720 --> 19:24.720
They won't.

19:24.720 --> 19:25.720
Nintendo is nothing to them.

19:25.760 --> 19:27.520
It's a very minimalist, minimal amount of copy.

19:27.520 --> 19:28.520
They're belittling it.

19:28.520 --> 19:29.520
Yeah.

19:29.520 --> 19:30.880
So they, they just don't care about that right now.

19:30.880 --> 19:35.520
But I think they wouldn't have gone all in if they didn't know that it was a guarantee

19:35.520 --> 19:40.300
from both parties, both public or both, uh, console manufacturers.

19:40.300 --> 19:46.440
And honestly, I just have a hot, especially we have to see how similar it is.

19:46.440 --> 19:51.440
If it's very similar, I'm, there's some serious antitrust, you know, concerns there because

19:51.440 --> 19:55.720
it's like, what are these guys just sit down and make, decide, Hey, we're going to do this.

19:55.720 --> 19:57.760
This is how we're going to do this system.

19:57.760 --> 20:01.380
And you know, we're going to both be on board and we're going to both benefit from it because

20:01.380 --> 20:02.840
they're going to have no choice.

20:02.840 --> 20:05.400
You know, we're going to get rid of options for them.

20:05.400 --> 20:10.380
But I like, you know, even though there's all this negative information, I have to wait

20:10.380 --> 20:14.680
until when the console come out before I can make my decision because they could very well,

20:14.680 --> 20:17.320
hopefully, you know, say, fuck you guys.

20:17.320 --> 20:20.800
You know, you know, seriously to EA.

20:21.480 --> 20:22.840
What are they going to do?

20:22.840 --> 20:27.400
They got to, you kind of get some balls here because what's Microsoft can do.

20:27.400 --> 20:30.240
They can say, fuck you EA, what are you going to do?

20:30.240 --> 20:31.800
Not publish games on our console.

20:31.800 --> 20:34.240
And if Microsoft and Sony does that, what are they going to do?

20:34.240 --> 20:35.480
Publish PC only?

20:35.480 --> 20:40.440
I mean, they're not, they have to kind of agree on some sort of partnership here.

20:40.440 --> 20:47.200
It's just, I mean, if Sony, let's just say in a perfect world, Sony would, you know, say,

20:47.200 --> 20:49.200
okay, listen, we're not going to put up with this bullshit.

20:49.200 --> 20:52.720
We're just going to keep things kind of the way they are right now.

20:52.720 --> 20:54.800
And they could totally have this in the bag.

20:54.800 --> 20:55.800
Easy, easy.

20:55.800 --> 21:01.200
This generation could come out on top and just totally rule everything.

21:01.200 --> 21:03.200
But I have a feeling that's not the case.

21:03.200 --> 21:07.680
I don't think Microsoft would take a risk like that without, you know, knowing that

21:07.680 --> 21:09.120
both parties are going to do that.

21:09.120 --> 21:12.800
But yet there, you know, there's going to be some little differences in policy because

21:12.800 --> 21:17.040
for instance, we heard last week about how Sony is mandating that there be off screen

21:17.040 --> 21:19.280
play or whatever for PlayStation Vita.

21:19.280 --> 21:21.840
So there are going to be little twists in the rules.

21:21.840 --> 21:29.600
So you know, maybe, maybe, maybe Microsoft implemented, just, just theorizing a tinfoil

21:29.600 --> 21:35.360
hat here, maybe Microsoft invented the whole game sharing Amazon Kindle thing to try and

21:35.360 --> 21:39.880
put a little positive in a negative that they agreed to with Sony.

21:39.880 --> 21:41.360
And maybe Sony is not going to have that.

21:41.360 --> 21:45.520
Maybe Sony's, Sony's only got the negative and their positive is the PlayStation Vita

21:45.520 --> 21:46.520
play.

21:46.520 --> 21:50.960
You know, that kind of where one where we're trying to see who can come up with the best

21:50.960 --> 21:52.920
silver lining to the shitty situation.

21:52.920 --> 21:53.920
But see, that's the thing.

21:53.920 --> 21:59.040
It's like, like I've, there's some people on Twitter and stuff and saying, hey, well,

21:59.040 --> 22:01.000
the 10 game sharing thing is kind of cool.

22:01.000 --> 22:04.280
I can share my games with someone else cause then I can cost average, you know, the games

22:04.280 --> 22:05.280
I'm buying.

22:05.280 --> 22:09.960
I'm like, but, but so what you can do that anyways, just, you know, you loan your games

22:09.960 --> 22:11.200
to your friends if you really want to.

22:11.200 --> 22:16.000
I just don't, I don't want to look, just say, well, at least they have this.

22:16.000 --> 22:20.280
Okay, well that's good, but no, they're taking away all this stuff from us.

22:20.280 --> 22:21.280
I'm sorry.

22:21.280 --> 22:24.920
I'll just stick with what I've got right now and if I have to, I'll just go PC because

22:24.920 --> 22:30.320
at least there there's flexibility with, I know, I know there's DRM with steam, but there's

22:30.320 --> 22:32.120
also mods with steam.

22:32.120 --> 22:33.900
There's also all sorts of customization.

22:33.900 --> 22:35.600
There's indie games.

22:35.600 --> 22:38.000
There's just insane sales on stuff.

22:38.000 --> 22:43.040
I can honestly say yes, I use steam, but I have, I'm, I really think I maybe, maybe

22:43.040 --> 22:46.960
ever bought one game, one game in the years I've owned steam.

22:46.960 --> 22:52.520
I've bought one game full retail price and that would have been Civ five, a PC only game.

22:52.520 --> 22:54.480
I never have.

22:54.480 --> 22:59.400
And even when I could have gotten a, yeah, then it was stupid origin bullshit.

22:59.400 --> 23:04.360
But when I bought mass effect three, for example, yeah, I bought it new, but I went and price

23:04.360 --> 23:07.920
matched somewhere, so I didn't pay full price for it and didn't go through origin.

23:07.920 --> 23:08.920
Oh yeah.

23:08.920 --> 23:11.720
If they, if Microsoft were to announce at the end of their press conference, by the

23:11.720 --> 23:17.600
way, uh, we're going to be lowering the price of games from $60 to $30 I I'm in, I'm back

23:17.600 --> 23:22.600
in because if that's the plus that the games are now going to cost half as much, you know,

23:22.600 --> 23:26.960
so okay, you know, I'll be back in, in a heartbeat.

23:26.960 --> 23:27.960
It's not going to happen.

23:27.960 --> 23:30.040
It's not going to happen because here's, what's going to happen.

23:30.040 --> 23:31.040
Here's what it is.

23:31.040 --> 23:34.360
You think that you're going to get better prices because now the stuff, now they're

23:34.360 --> 23:37.100
getting rid of the used market, so to speak.

23:37.100 --> 23:40.660
It's not going to happen because on PC you have multiple storefronts that are competing

23:40.660 --> 23:45.000
with each other and yeah, it may be all steam DRM and stuff, but they're having sales all

23:45.000 --> 23:49.120
across the board with Microsoft going this route.

23:49.120 --> 23:52.920
Not only are you going to be limited where you can trade your game in, so right there

23:52.920 --> 23:57.320
you're not going to get a really good deal as far as trading value goes because, Hey,

23:57.320 --> 23:59.920
we're also going to go, we're your only options.

23:59.920 --> 24:03.880
So your trading value is going to fucking suck to begin with and on top of that, you

24:03.880 --> 24:06.120
think they're really going to mark down prices of games.

24:06.120 --> 24:10.880
Hell, there's games on their Xbox games on demand service right now that are still way

24:10.880 --> 24:13.460
above what you can actually get them in a disk space format.

24:13.460 --> 24:16.200
So no, you're kidding yourself.

24:16.200 --> 24:17.680
A couple of great comments in our chat room.

24:17.680 --> 24:21.840
I want to get to Ahamkara in our chat says, I noticed Japan is not porting some of their

24:21.840 --> 24:26.000
best games out of the country offer good games to themselves for cheap or free and don't

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
seem to care.

24:27.000 --> 24:31.280
Funny how Microsoft is giving them the finger now by focusing on TV for Xbox one and not

24:31.280 --> 24:32.720
caring about Japan as well.

24:32.720 --> 24:37.280
Well, I mean, we've all kind of sat here going, well, clearly Microsoft's written off Japan,

24:37.280 --> 24:43.120
but if Sony were to adopt these similar measures, how would that impact Japanese gaming culture?

24:43.120 --> 24:44.120
Are Japanese game?

24:44.120 --> 24:46.720
I mean, I honestly don't know.

24:46.720 --> 24:52.040
Are Japanese gamers as willing to buy into all this?

24:52.080 --> 24:56.600
I think that it's not necessarily going to work because from what, just from what I've

24:56.600 --> 25:00.320
seen and of course we need somebody who lives there to confirm this.

25:00.320 --> 25:05.960
There's a big culture around having collectibles being, you know, one of the campers to get

25:05.960 --> 25:10.720
the game the first day, like the big lines around the Capcom store for whenever a Monster

25:10.720 --> 25:12.480
Hunter game comes out.

25:12.480 --> 25:13.920
It's a different type of culture.

25:13.920 --> 25:20.940
Like, you know, we may have a few, maybe a few people standing in line for a new system

25:20.940 --> 25:26.740
release or for having like maybe one super special game, you know, like the Madden ones,

25:26.740 --> 25:30.060
but it's nowhere near the crazy levels that it happens in Japan.

25:30.060 --> 25:31.060
Right.

25:31.060 --> 25:35.580
You know, and then like, for example, I mean, I keep bringing up my stupid Cardcaptor Sakura

25:35.580 --> 25:36.580
Dreamcast game.

25:36.580 --> 25:41.820
It had a pillow pillowcase and a clock and a fork and a spoon and a dish.

25:41.820 --> 25:42.820
Yes.

25:42.820 --> 25:47.900
But I mean, and there was, um, a Sakura Taisen game that came out in the same type of bundle,

25:48.420 --> 25:52.860
but I mean, there's lots of crazy-ass special editions that come out and people like their packaging.

25:52.860 --> 25:56.780
Akuma JP, like clockwork, shows up in chat when you said, we need somebody from Japan

25:56.780 --> 26:01.780
to be listening, but he just turned the station on, uh, we're talking about the, um, uh, Microsoft

26:01.780 --> 26:04.200
Xbox one DRM restrictions.

26:04.200 --> 26:08.300
And I was just kind of wondering if Sony's going down that same route, how, how does

26:08.300 --> 26:10.020
that impact Japanese gaming culture?

26:10.020 --> 26:12.820
Are the Japanese going to be as willing to buy into some of these restrictions?

26:12.820 --> 26:15.100
I still think there's going to be physical packaging.

26:15.100 --> 26:21.480
There's still going to be copies you can buy and sell because there is, I mean, there's

26:21.480 --> 26:24.780
a big part of the economy around that and there's a big part of the culture around that

26:24.780 --> 26:29.640
as I mean, you even see like a few people over here who like to get their import special

26:29.640 --> 26:30.640
editions and everything.

26:30.640 --> 26:31.640
All right.

26:31.640 --> 26:32.640
One more comment.

26:32.640 --> 26:33.640
I want to get here from chat.

26:33.640 --> 26:35.540
And then I do kind of want to move on with the show because we have a lot of news to

26:35.540 --> 26:38.800
cover in this pre E3 week, and I know we're going to get back to this topic during phone

26:38.800 --> 26:39.800
calls tonight.

26:39.800 --> 26:42.620
Uh, but I want to get this comment here from Koopa kid.

26:42.620 --> 26:48.140
He says, thankfully, Nintendo isn't smart enough with online to be, to even be able

26:48.140 --> 26:50.260
to implement these types of features.

26:50.260 --> 26:53.700
You know, this is something I've kind of referenced in past episodes on the show when we were

26:53.700 --> 26:58.500
all worried about this is that could Nintendo end up as the, you know, they're the right

26:58.500 --> 27:02.300
now they're the dog in the corner chasing its tail, looking a little silly and everybody's

27:02.300 --> 27:03.740
like, what a weird dog.

27:03.740 --> 27:07.040
But now all of a sudden it's like, it's, it's the most attractive puppy in the room and

27:07.040 --> 27:08.860
everybody might want to adopt it.

27:08.860 --> 27:16.180
How is, has Nintendo's failure to embrace online, which granted probably is what drove

27:16.180 --> 27:17.180
EA.

27:17.180 --> 27:22.360
Does that suddenly make them the most attractive option to Japanese gamers, to people like

27:22.360 --> 27:28.060
me that feel like I'm, I'm now for the, I don't want all these Draconia measures.

27:28.060 --> 27:35.620
Honestly I would, if, if they put an Xbox, actually as I've been calling it the X bone

27:35.620 --> 27:39.720
in front of me versus a Wii U, given me money and said, pick one to buy.

27:39.720 --> 27:41.740
You can, you can buy one.

27:41.740 --> 27:44.680
I would go for the Wii U. End of story.

27:44.680 --> 27:47.480
I don't even care if it's just a glorified Wii.

27:47.480 --> 27:51.760
I would pick that over the X bone because well, let's face it, I already have an Xbox

27:51.760 --> 27:52.760
360.

27:52.760 --> 27:55.000
I already have all this other stuff I can play.

27:55.000 --> 28:00.240
If I had to pick one, it'd be the Wii U because I wouldn't have to be limited.

28:00.240 --> 28:01.240
Loki do you have a thought?

28:01.240 --> 28:03.200
Cause then I'm going to ask Jamie a very tough question.

28:03.700 --> 28:08.820
Um, no, I still don't want a Wii U and the other reason it goes back to what the original

28:08.820 --> 28:11.980
reason why I don't want a Wii U cause there's nothing I want to play on it and I don't really

28:11.980 --> 28:13.420
consider a next gen console.

28:13.420 --> 28:17.780
I mean, honestly, the stuff you're going to see on the Wii U, especially coming out of

28:17.780 --> 28:22.380
new games is stuff that's going to be ported to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation three already.

28:22.380 --> 28:26.700
I don't need to buy another console for games I can play on my console that I already have.

28:26.700 --> 28:30.260
Now the only advantage I see, and it's been kind of, I've been thinking about more cause

28:30.320 --> 28:35.200
my wife has been really hogging the TV, is that off, off screen or the, uh, you know,

28:35.200 --> 28:39.160
second screenplay stuff is kind of cool because I do want to play console games a lot of times

28:39.160 --> 28:40.720
and my wife wants to watch TV.

28:40.720 --> 28:44.320
So you know, that is the only positive, but once again, it's, I don't want to buy a new

28:44.320 --> 28:48.200
console just for that because I have my laptop, I can play on my laptop if really willing

28:48.200 --> 28:49.200
to.

28:49.200 --> 28:54.640
So it's just, no one's holding a gun to my head to force me to buy a new console.

28:54.640 --> 28:55.640
I don't have to.

28:55.640 --> 29:00.380
So I, you know, really, you know, if that's the thought process that they're going in

29:00.380 --> 29:04.020
with it saying, well, you know, that's why EA can get rid of, you know, their online

29:04.020 --> 29:07.380
passes because hey, they've got to buy another console at some point.

29:07.380 --> 29:10.540
No, I don't, I don't have to do anything.

29:10.540 --> 29:11.540
That's the thing.

29:11.540 --> 29:13.120
I don't have to follow what you want me to do.

29:13.120 --> 29:17.740
And don't think for one second that no one's going to figure out a way to put some sort

29:17.740 --> 29:22.760
of device in between your console and the internet to fucking spoof that authentication

29:22.760 --> 29:23.760
server.

29:23.760 --> 29:24.980
I kind of think that's what's going to happen too.

29:24.980 --> 29:26.200
The gamers going to hack, right?

29:26.200 --> 29:27.200
It's going to happen.

29:27.200 --> 29:28.200
They will.

29:28.200 --> 29:29.200
And this will be a focus.

29:29.200 --> 29:33.480
YYR in chat says all these draconian restrictions aren't going to send most gamers to, aren't

29:33.480 --> 29:37.700
going to send most gamers to Wii U, the Nintendo fans will already buy one and everyone else

29:37.700 --> 29:39.660
will just not buy a console.

29:39.660 --> 29:43.640
I think if anything, I think people will still buy one next gen console, even though they

29:43.640 --> 29:47.400
hate everything because they're like, well, I got to play Killer Instinct or I got to

29:47.400 --> 29:48.400
play whatever.

29:48.400 --> 29:52.540
You know, I always try to gauge this if, you know, in trying to, in the years I've been

29:52.540 --> 29:57.340
doing the show and the commentary and everything, I find that the best insight comes from non-gamers

29:57.340 --> 29:58.500
truly.

29:58.500 --> 30:03.460
If I want to really get a feel for where people, where, you know, the America's head is really

30:03.460 --> 30:07.180
at, I'm not going to look for it on Twitter, sorry guys, I'm not going to look for it with

30:07.180 --> 30:11.100
you because we're a very unique, you know, smaller sort of subset fan base.

30:11.100 --> 30:15.300
And I look to general people, people that don't consider themselves gamers.

30:15.300 --> 30:19.200
And you know, this week I was on a work trip in Phoenix and I was with a couple of coworkers

30:19.200 --> 30:21.340
and the subject of video games came up just randomly.

30:21.340 --> 30:24.340
I think, I think somebody had asked about my podcast and I was talking about it kind

30:24.340 --> 30:28.700
of casually and he mentioned, yeah, oh yeah, I really like Assassin's Creed and yeah, I

30:28.700 --> 30:33.540
heard about that Xbox one, but I heard it's not going to play any of the used stuff.

30:33.540 --> 30:34.540
I don't think I want to get one.

30:34.540 --> 30:36.380
It sounds like it's too restrictive.

30:36.380 --> 30:39.500
And I'm kind of just thinking in the back of my head, I'm like, I wonder if there's

30:39.500 --> 30:43.300
a lot of people that, you know, when they just kind of hear what a friend of a friend

30:43.300 --> 30:46.760
says to them, they're going to run with that.

30:46.760 --> 30:48.340
You know what I mean?

30:48.340 --> 30:49.820
Gamers will buy the console.

30:49.820 --> 30:51.540
There'll be something on it.

30:51.540 --> 30:53.300
There's always going to be the people there.

30:53.300 --> 30:54.860
There will be PlayStation fours that sell.

30:54.860 --> 30:56.540
There will be Xbox ones that sell.

30:56.540 --> 30:59.980
Will they sell more than Wii U?

30:59.980 --> 31:03.620
You know, I don't know, you know, the best time to buy an Xbox one's going to be the

31:03.620 --> 31:07.780
end of the generation when they do eventually shut down those authentication servers.

31:07.780 --> 31:13.340
And let's assume that they go the, you know, steam route and they unlock it so that you

31:13.340 --> 31:16.480
don't have to call in every 24 hours, you know, it just works.

31:16.480 --> 31:19.880
Or they can be fucking dicks and say, well, fuck, no, your shit's going to work now.

31:19.880 --> 31:24.160
So let me ask Jamie the difficult question, then we'll move into our gaming week.

31:24.160 --> 31:25.160
Okay.

31:25.160 --> 31:26.160
All right.

31:26.160 --> 31:27.680
And I opened this up to the chatters as well.

31:27.680 --> 31:31.960
For the 11 years this month that we've been doing orange launch radio, we've always had

31:31.960 --> 31:34.540
a mantra on this show 11 years.

31:34.540 --> 31:38.080
And we're actually having a show on June 23rd this year, which is the birthday.

31:38.080 --> 31:40.840
So anyway, that's only what, like three weeks away.

31:40.840 --> 31:41.840
Holy crap.

31:41.840 --> 31:42.840
I'd lost count.

31:42.840 --> 31:43.840
Our 11th birthday is coming up y'all.

31:43.840 --> 31:44.840
Okay.

31:45.200 --> 31:48.880
So for the 11 years on this program, we've had a mantra on this show about gaming.

31:48.880 --> 31:53.880
And that is a system is only as good as the games that are on it, but Microsoft's about

31:53.880 --> 31:57.920
to unveil 15 exclusives, which might include some of the things we've been clamoring for

31:57.920 --> 32:02.280
for a long time, killer instinct, you know, perhaps that Banjo Kazooie thing.

32:02.280 --> 32:03.280
I don't know.

32:03.280 --> 32:09.400
I'm going to fanboy wank here, but now because of all these things that the system is doing,

32:09.400 --> 32:13.600
I'm coming back to question, is that mantra still true?

32:13.600 --> 32:23.160
I think we may have to evolve it.

32:23.160 --> 32:27.880
Because we've got a system now that's doing things that systems didn't do in the past.

32:27.880 --> 32:33.720
We have a new restriction being placed on how they're trying to change how the system

32:33.720 --> 32:35.520
works.

32:35.520 --> 32:43.640
And so with that, I believe I'm trying to think of how to phrase this.

32:43.640 --> 32:51.200
I think that the games themselves should speak for themselves, but they have to be made accessible.

32:51.200 --> 32:56.080
If you don't have access to the game, it does you no good.

32:56.080 --> 33:04.280
If it's not going to give you a way to play the game, that's I hope I'm making it's a

33:04.280 --> 33:05.280
tough question.

33:05.280 --> 33:10.280
It's tough to phrase, but I just kind of feel like the golden rule of gaming may finally

33:10.280 --> 33:14.400
have shown a blemish this week.

33:14.400 --> 33:19.240
I think that to be able to appreciate the game being on the system, you have to have

33:19.240 --> 33:21.760
a system that's going to allow you to enjoy it.

33:21.760 --> 33:22.760
Does that make sense?

33:22.760 --> 33:23.760
Sure.

33:23.760 --> 33:26.900
So like for it has to work.

33:26.900 --> 33:30.680
It has to like for the Nintendo, you put the cartridge in the system and you know, it's

33:30.680 --> 33:31.680
going to work.

33:31.680 --> 33:34.320
Even if you blow on the cartridge 100 times, you know, it has to just work right.

33:34.320 --> 33:36.760
But now we're calling into question, is this really going to work?

33:36.760 --> 33:40.800
I have to quote Queen Simia, sprinkles on a turd don't make it any more tasty.

33:40.800 --> 33:45.260
Um, cause actually, actually that's pretty much how it is.

33:45.260 --> 33:49.760
I think that, Oh God, it's hard for me to say.

33:49.760 --> 33:50.760
Okay.

33:50.760 --> 33:55.220
Let me, let me try this from clerical error 404 in chat, uh, at live.vognetwork.com clerical

33:55.220 --> 34:00.160
error 404 says, I think the mantra needs to evolve in that it needs to have the games,

34:00.160 --> 34:04.640
but also the versatility, the more games that are accessible by more people and potential

34:04.640 --> 34:05.720
players.

34:05.720 --> 34:06.720
Power to the players.

34:06.720 --> 34:07.720
Right.

34:07.720 --> 34:08.720
Agreed.

34:08.720 --> 34:14.160
Uh, the evil G there, but here's, here's really where my thought is on this one.

34:14.160 --> 34:18.960
And I hope this makes sense because I've been trying to, the thoughts clear in my head,

34:18.960 --> 34:22.320
but it's kind of hard to bring into words.

34:22.320 --> 34:26.000
A system is only as good as the games that are accessible on it.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.000
Preach.

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
Okay.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.900
But I'm using, I'm using example here.

34:29.900 --> 34:32.140
Back in the day, like I'm going to use symphony of the night.

34:32.140 --> 34:33.140
Okay.

34:33.140 --> 34:34.140
For Saturn and for PlayStation.

34:34.140 --> 34:35.700
Cause I've got them both.

34:35.700 --> 34:38.220
I liked the Saturn version better.

34:38.220 --> 34:43.360
It was accessible to me at the time because I could import it, but other people, but say

34:43.360 --> 34:48.500
that I had no means of importing the game and all I had was a $20 copy that I bought

34:48.500 --> 34:52.780
used at GameStop because you could buy the music GameStop, Ooh.

34:52.780 --> 34:56.180
Well then I would say, well, of course I like the PlayStation version because I haven't

34:56.180 --> 34:57.660
been able to play it on the Saturn.

34:57.660 --> 34:59.900
I have no basis of comparison.

34:59.900 --> 35:07.980
So say that you've got this system here that you don't want to invest in because of its

35:07.980 --> 35:09.260
practices around the game.

35:09.260 --> 35:13.420
Say the PS4 comes out and it's fully open and everything's nice and lovely and the same

35:13.420 --> 35:14.420
games come out for it.

35:14.420 --> 35:17.700
You're still going to go with the one that's more accessible to you because that's what

35:17.700 --> 35:18.700
you have.

35:18.700 --> 35:21.460
You have no basis of comparison saying X version is better.

35:21.460 --> 35:23.820
Isn't necessarily fair because you can't compare it.

35:23.820 --> 35:27.380
Is that the reason why I tend to buy games on the PlayStation three over the Xbox three

35:27.380 --> 35:31.660
60 for the mere simple fact that I like the controller better?

35:31.660 --> 35:35.980
Yeah, I mean that's really the same.

35:35.980 --> 35:36.980
Not always.

35:36.980 --> 35:40.060
Cause sometimes, sometimes, but then I go, if I want to play the game online with friends,

35:40.060 --> 35:43.380
I go to the three 60 because it's got the better network.

35:43.380 --> 35:44.380
Thank you.

35:44.380 --> 35:45.380
Clerical error.

35:45.380 --> 35:46.380
Four Oh four.

35:46.380 --> 35:47.380
This is a set.

35:47.380 --> 35:50.220
I learned as you for preferring the Saturn version just because I really like playing

35:50.220 --> 35:51.220
as Maria.

35:51.220 --> 35:52.220
Okay.

35:52.220 --> 35:53.220
All right.

35:53.620 --> 36:00.860
The whole point is, is that the games being good to play is also determined by the other

36:00.860 --> 36:03.220
factors that go into actually playing the game itself.

36:03.220 --> 36:06.700
Like for you, the controller, like for me, I love playing Saturn games because the dual

36:06.700 --> 36:13.940
analog controller does not hurt my hand even to this day, but playing, um, like I'm better

36:13.940 --> 36:14.940
with RPG.

36:14.940 --> 36:18.500
Like I like playing RPGs better now because I get to move my hand.

36:18.500 --> 36:22.940
I don't have to keep moving my thumb around and, you know, pulling up my, uh, my scar

36:22.940 --> 36:25.620
on my hand, all the scar tissue I've got.

36:25.620 --> 36:31.700
So it's really going to be a matter of how you play it as well as the content itself.

36:31.700 --> 36:36.780
And if it's not allowing you to access that content, then why bother?

36:36.780 --> 36:37.780
All right.

36:37.780 --> 36:38.780
Well, it's a complicated issue.

36:38.780 --> 36:42.020
Any, any quick last words, Loki, you want to get in before we move on here?

36:42.020 --> 36:47.900
No, it's just, I just disappointed that the news came out now and not after, because I

36:47.940 --> 36:53.060
wish I could be a little bit excited about what Microsoft showing, but you sound like

36:53.060 --> 36:57.220
a tweet I made earlier this week that every year I'm so excited about E3 and like, Yay,

36:57.220 --> 36:58.220
new games.

36:58.220 --> 36:59.220
Yay.

36:59.220 --> 37:01.820
This year I really have a sense of dread about E3 this year.

37:01.820 --> 37:04.380
It's about how am I getting fucked over this year?

37:04.380 --> 37:10.380
Like, and I'm sorry to sound like that jaded gamers hate everything.com guy, but I'm not

37:10.380 --> 37:11.460
going to lie to you.

37:11.460 --> 37:15.700
That's where I'm at right now, whether I'm overreacting or not.

37:16.700 --> 37:22.340
No, it's a lot of money you're asking me to drop on a console where it's not even really

37:22.340 --> 37:26.780
my console.

37:26.780 --> 37:30.900
At some point I got to put my foot down and say, I love video games, but no, I'm done.

37:30.900 --> 37:34.440
Here's another question too, is how is the, how are they even going to enable this with

37:34.440 --> 37:36.780
like the first sale doctrine and stuff?

37:36.780 --> 37:41.180
Cause you know, I, I just don't know if they're going to say, well, you're licensing stuff

37:41.180 --> 37:42.180
from us now.

37:42.180 --> 37:44.380
Well, I don't know if they're going to be able to.

37:44.460 --> 37:48.500
I think that that could, you could, well, considering how Sue happy everything is, I

37:48.500 --> 37:52.780
think we could very well see that this is going to be a lawsuit within a year or so.

37:52.780 --> 37:55.140
I forgot to make my analogy, so I'll make it quick.

37:55.140 --> 37:56.140
Oh, I thought you did.

37:56.140 --> 37:57.140
No, I didn't.

37:57.140 --> 37:58.540
I make a lot of crazy analogies.

37:58.540 --> 38:00.420
There's one I was sitting on all week.

38:00.420 --> 38:02.620
Who remembers Divx?

38:02.620 --> 38:03.620
Oh my God.

38:03.620 --> 38:08.340
And I'm not talking about the codec on your computer that lets you watch movies and things

38:08.340 --> 38:09.340
like that.

38:09.340 --> 38:13.060
I'm talking about when there was actually a Divx player at circuit city, but it always

38:13.060 --> 38:18.380
had to be connected online because you could rent the movies at the store and the thing

38:18.380 --> 38:19.740
ended up flopping.

38:19.740 --> 38:22.100
Why did the Divx flop?

38:22.100 --> 38:23.420
Because of all the restrictions on it.

38:23.420 --> 38:28.100
There weren't any games on it or any, no, there weren't any, uh, movies for it.

38:28.100 --> 38:30.940
Well, there was, there was the same movies that were on DVD and laser disc.

38:30.940 --> 38:34.780
Well, for the people who don't know what Divx is, just think of the little mascot from penny

38:34.780 --> 38:35.780
arcade.

38:35.780 --> 38:39.580
They have that little Divx player character that that's a Divx machine.

38:39.580 --> 38:44.180
And I'm sorry, but right now what I'm hearing at X-Box one sounds very Divx to me.

38:44.180 --> 38:52.180
And I think people rejected Divx because they wanted to own their shit and they didn't want

38:52.180 --> 38:55.980
to have to keep dialing this server that was daddy Steven Spielberg, who was a co-owner

38:55.980 --> 38:57.580
in this daddy Steven Spielberg.

38:57.580 --> 39:02.380
May I watch this movie?

39:02.380 --> 39:05.340
People want to have control in the end.

39:05.340 --> 39:06.340
Yeah.

39:06.340 --> 39:09.100
Game guru and chat Divx, the disc player that killed circuit city.

39:09.100 --> 39:10.100
Absolutely.

39:10.100 --> 39:12.020
It brought down an entire chain with it.

39:12.020 --> 39:15.980
Don't think that the Divx didn't have a lasting negative impact on circuit city.

39:15.980 --> 39:22.500
Well, and also, also keep in mind there, um, I just completely lost my train of thought.

39:22.500 --> 39:28.620
No, it was, um, the fact that you still have people today that even though we've got iTunes

39:28.620 --> 39:32.120
and we have all this digital distribution, there's still people who like to physically

39:32.120 --> 39:36.980
go out and buy a disc who will prefer to buy their music on CD.

39:36.980 --> 39:38.940
There's quite a few people in chat agreeing with you.

39:38.940 --> 39:39.940
Yes.

39:39.940 --> 39:40.940
Yeah.

39:40.940 --> 39:42.500
I mean, I'm not necessarily one of them, but anyway.

39:42.500 --> 39:43.500
All right.

39:43.500 --> 39:45.140
Lots of passion behind this topic.

39:45.140 --> 39:48.620
I'm sure we'll hear more about it during our phone call segment later, as well as the mailbag

39:48.620 --> 39:51.180
mailbag at orange launch radio.com.

39:51.180 --> 39:53.180
It's going to be a very interesting answer it.

39:53.180 --> 39:54.180
I'm kidding.

39:54.180 --> 39:56.060
It's going to be a very interesting E3 week.

39:56.060 --> 39:57.060
That's all I have to say.

39:57.060 --> 40:01.340
I, I, I'm really looking forward to next week's show when Sony will have to put it out on

40:01.340 --> 40:03.540
the table because they didn't cancel their media stuff.

40:03.540 --> 40:04.540
Right.

40:04.540 --> 40:06.120
So they're going to have to answer this question.

40:06.120 --> 40:09.340
And finally, we'll have a clearer picture to what things are going to look like come

40:09.340 --> 40:10.620
this fall.

40:10.620 --> 40:13.960
In the meantime, quickly, guys, how was your gaming week?

40:13.960 --> 40:16.720
We always start off the show, haha, with how was your gaming week?

40:16.720 --> 40:17.720
Dark soccer.

40:17.720 --> 40:18.720
Start?

40:18.720 --> 40:27.520
Um, well, I, after my kind of poo pooing on Star Trek online, I saw there was a new expansion.

40:27.520 --> 40:31.240
So I decided to give it a try again and it's actually fun.

40:31.240 --> 40:32.960
The legacy of Romulus expansion.

40:32.960 --> 40:37.560
I mean, I just started off a character, but I had a really good time doing it and I really

40:37.560 --> 40:42.620
liked what it added to the, uh, as I'm calling it, the main timeline lore.

40:42.620 --> 40:43.820
It was really good.

40:43.820 --> 40:49.300
So I've actually been enjoying that and they kind of set the skill trees back to how they

40:49.300 --> 40:50.640
used to be.

40:50.640 --> 40:52.320
Not necessarily exactly the same.

40:52.320 --> 41:00.240
And I kind of respect my Vice Admiral incorrectly, but still they, they did a lot of really cool

41:00.240 --> 41:01.240
stuff.

41:01.320 --> 41:04.560
Actually, I'll tell you what was funny because I was just running around on my Vice Admiral

41:04.560 --> 41:09.200
because I have her pretty much, uh, permanently parked at a deep space nine.

41:09.200 --> 41:14.000
They put Morin in Quark's bar and like as a big DS nine fan, that made me stupendously

41:14.000 --> 41:19.760
happy and like it even had him like quote telling a story, even though he never talks,

41:19.760 --> 41:23.320
it just sort of did a fade out and then shaking his head for Lornely and everything.

41:23.320 --> 41:24.520
It was pretty funny.

41:24.520 --> 41:26.280
Um, I did start Marvel heroes.

41:26.280 --> 41:27.640
I do not care for it.

41:27.640 --> 41:33.940
It reminded me a bit of playing, um, Marvel Ultimate Alliance without the fun part of

41:33.940 --> 41:36.280
having other people to play with.

41:36.280 --> 41:37.280
And the fact that...

41:37.280 --> 41:40.400
Interesting because you're the first one I've heard say something negative about it.

41:40.400 --> 41:41.880
I mean, everybody has their opinion.

41:41.880 --> 41:42.880
I just, uh, interesting.

41:42.880 --> 41:46.960
I'm not saying it wasn't fun and yeah, it's free to play, but if I wanted, but if I wanted

41:46.960 --> 41:53.400
another character, I pretty much have to buy, um, 20 bucks worth of points for one character.

41:53.400 --> 41:58.320
Or if I bought $40 worth of points, that would get me, you know, maybe three characters.

41:58.320 --> 42:02.400
And the one that I really wanted to play, she had a Sprite for it, but she wasn't accessible

42:02.400 --> 42:09.240
to buy because as I've made no, uh, no secret of this, my favorite Marvel character is Jessica

42:09.240 --> 42:10.240
Jones because she's bad-ass.

42:10.240 --> 42:14.940
Um, so anyway, I played through the whole first mission as Scarlet Witch and it was

42:14.940 --> 42:21.360
just like a not quite as fun version of Marvel Ultimate Alliance and I would rather play

42:21.360 --> 42:23.160
Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

42:23.160 --> 42:24.160
I'm going to check.

42:24.160 --> 42:25.640
I want to check out this Marvel Heroes game.

42:25.640 --> 42:30.280
I just, I was busy this past week, so I didn't get a chance to check it out, but I want to...

42:30.280 --> 42:31.280
It wasn't bad.

42:31.280 --> 42:36.240
I'm going to say it wasn't bad, but it wasn't enough to make me want to spend any amount

42:36.240 --> 42:37.240
of money on it.

42:37.240 --> 42:39.320
I mean, I might play it a little bit more.

42:39.320 --> 42:40.400
I've got Scarlet Witch.

42:40.400 --> 42:41.400
She's pretty cool.

42:41.400 --> 42:45.160
I almost picked Hawkeye because, you know, Hawkeye, but I went for her.

42:45.160 --> 42:46.800
You just wanted to stare at his booty.

42:46.800 --> 42:48.500
No, I'm, you know what?

42:48.500 --> 42:49.760
That's objectification, Robin.

42:49.760 --> 42:51.760
I take exception to that.

42:51.760 --> 42:54.960
Um, but, uh, it was all right.

42:54.960 --> 42:55.960
It was all right.

42:55.960 --> 42:59.280
And as a male, I am totally okay with the objectification of Hawkeye.

42:59.280 --> 43:00.280
Just saying.

43:00.280 --> 43:02.200
Well, if it's Jeremy Renner, then yeah.

43:02.200 --> 43:08.400
Um, no, but at any rate, um, I also, I, as I have said, I am back to play Mass Effect,

43:08.400 --> 43:09.960
the first one.

43:09.960 --> 43:12.480
Um, Dramamine does not work, Rob.

43:12.480 --> 43:17.060
And I will tell you why I actually had Dramamine is because I got it from my trip to Alabama

43:17.060 --> 43:20.560
and I decided to take Dramamine for my first Mako mission.

43:20.560 --> 43:21.560
And it did not help.

43:21.560 --> 43:25.400
I was nauseous in five seconds.

43:25.400 --> 43:29.200
And then, um, yes, Claire, Claire, it's because it's Jeremy Renner.

43:29.200 --> 43:38.840
I think he's pretty, um, and intelligent, and intelligent, um, but, uh, uh, what was

43:38.840 --> 43:39.840
I saying?

43:39.840 --> 43:40.840
Oh yeah.

43:40.840 --> 43:43.360
Um, so I actually, uh, I have a high res mod.

43:43.360 --> 43:49.040
Well, it's really, you have to sort of manually mod your INI files yourself and then use text

43:49.040 --> 43:51.860
mod for the high resolution textures.

43:51.860 --> 43:57.960
And I figured out that why my game kept shutting down is because it didn't have, um, uh, there's

43:57.960 --> 44:03.800
like a little program you can run to make it accept, um, higher, uh, memory usage, which

44:03.800 --> 44:08.000
I mean, I've got a card that, you know, gives me two extra gig of VRAM, so I don't know

44:08.000 --> 44:16.400
what's going on, but I ended up, uh, getting that working and, uh, it was, uh, it was pretty

44:16.400 --> 44:17.400
good.

44:17.400 --> 44:22.000
And I actually, I can tell you this, that I don't get as sick as I did with some of

44:22.000 --> 44:24.080
the higher res textures.

44:24.080 --> 44:29.160
So I'm pretty much just running through the game and trying to get all the stuff I missed.

44:29.160 --> 44:32.740
I'm actually also doing a different background than what I used to do because I always used

44:32.740 --> 44:38.760
to do either a colonist or a spacer, but I would always do soul survivor and now I'm

44:38.760 --> 44:42.780
doing a war hero, which is, it kind of changes up a few things, you know, you don't have

44:42.780 --> 44:48.540
to deal with the hyperventilating, uh, slave girl and you'd still deal with a major asshole.

44:48.540 --> 44:51.020
I'm sorry, Admiral asshole.

44:51.020 --> 44:55.660
Um, the only thing I do, and I will give this as a flat warning for anyone who uses the

44:55.660 --> 45:01.220
texture replacement is it does mess up anyone wearing the dress blues because it will change

45:01.220 --> 45:04.420
a texture to white and the hands to white, which is really bizarre.

45:04.420 --> 45:06.700
But other than that, it's, it's super nice.

45:06.700 --> 45:08.900
Everything looks beautiful.

45:08.900 --> 45:14.640
And um, God, I was playing something else too, and I don't remember what it was.

45:14.640 --> 45:16.060
I don't remember what it was.

45:16.060 --> 45:17.340
We'll come back to you if you think of it.

45:17.340 --> 45:20.100
Oh, Dan is really irritated with grid two.

45:20.100 --> 45:21.100
Why?

45:21.100 --> 45:24.740
Because he says that it does, that the collision detection in that game is just really shit.

45:24.740 --> 45:25.740
I haven't played it.

45:25.740 --> 45:27.140
Well, you know, he has that driving.

45:27.140 --> 45:29.020
Oh no, I know he loves his driving rig.

45:29.020 --> 45:30.660
He's he's a, he's a manly man.

45:30.660 --> 45:31.660
Yeah.

45:31.660 --> 45:32.660
All right.

45:32.660 --> 45:33.660
Loki, how was your gaming week?

45:33.660 --> 45:37.580
Uh, unfortunately I did not play, I don't think anything actually.

45:37.580 --> 45:43.820
Uh, I, yeah, it's just, uh, the boss has been out all week, so they haven't played any

45:43.820 --> 45:47.660
Call of Duty and uh, I didn't really play anything in the video.

45:47.660 --> 45:51.060
I was working on my laptop for most of the week and then my laptop broke, so then I had

45:51.060 --> 45:52.060
to fix my laptop.

45:52.060 --> 45:53.300
So I've been busy with that.

45:53.300 --> 45:58.380
So um, yeah, I did buy the, uh, the serious Sam bundle thing that they have on the humble

45:58.380 --> 45:59.380
bundle weekly thing.

45:59.380 --> 46:00.540
So that was kind of cool.

46:00.540 --> 46:07.180
So we'll play some of that soon and um, just watch the Watch Dogs trailer for E3, the E3

46:07.180 --> 46:08.180
trailer.

46:08.180 --> 46:09.180
It looks fantastic.

46:09.180 --> 46:10.180
I can't wait for that game.

46:10.180 --> 46:11.180
Hmm.

46:11.180 --> 46:12.180
So that just released tonight?

46:12.180 --> 46:13.180
Uh, it leaked out.

46:13.180 --> 46:14.180
Yeah.

46:14.180 --> 46:15.180
Nice.

46:15.180 --> 46:16.180
All right.

46:16.180 --> 46:17.180
Anything else?

46:17.180 --> 46:18.180
Uh, that is it.

46:18.180 --> 46:20.180
Uh, I'm only really going to talk about one new game.

46:20.180 --> 46:24.500
Uh, I, uh, was in Phoenix for a lot of the week for the day job, so that kind of kept

46:24.500 --> 46:29.420
me away from most of my games besides iPad and portable games I've talked a lot about

46:29.420 --> 46:30.420
on the show.

46:30.420 --> 46:34.820
My random game to play on the airplane, thank heavens for the Game Boy Advance games and

46:34.820 --> 46:40.900
the NES games and all that on the 3DS for the early adopters, Mario Kart Game Boy Advance.

46:40.900 --> 46:44.860
I don't know why it actually is one of the weaker Mario Kart games, just control wise

46:44.860 --> 46:48.860
and everything, but, uh, I just, just, I was like, I want to unlock the special cup.

46:48.860 --> 46:49.860
So I did it.

46:49.860 --> 46:53.820
Anyway, uh, the real game I've been playing a bit of at least the past couple of days

46:53.820 --> 46:56.020
is Animal Crossing New Leaf.

46:56.020 --> 46:59.580
It's the 3D version of Animal Crossing that just came out.

46:59.580 --> 47:01.580
Um, what can I say?

47:01.580 --> 47:03.020
It's Animal Crossing.

47:03.060 --> 47:06.540
Some of the differences though, uh, I noticed that they put a lot of the stores that used

47:06.540 --> 47:11.420
to be sprinkled throughout your town, not really the mall thing like the Wii did, but

47:11.420 --> 47:16.060
there's a other side of the tracks now, like a main street where all the, like the nooks,

47:16.060 --> 47:21.820
the Abel sisters, the, uh, Tom Nook, who's the, now the realtor, cause he gave the convenience

47:21.820 --> 47:25.820
store to his kids and, uh, some other stuff is, uh, all that stuff's on the other side

47:25.820 --> 47:26.820
of the tracks.

47:26.820 --> 47:27.820
The museums there too.

47:27.820 --> 47:31.060
So it's kind of neat to have kind of everything in that one place that really opens up your

47:31.100 --> 47:34.700
town to have a little bit more of your design when it comes to the trees and the flowers

47:34.700 --> 47:35.700
and all that.

47:35.700 --> 47:40.380
Um, all the online experience is pretty much similar to what I noticed in the previous

47:40.380 --> 47:41.380
games.

47:41.380 --> 47:43.300
You open up your train gates and people can come visit.

47:43.300 --> 47:46.020
In fact, I should open mine up and see if anyone comes to visit.

47:46.020 --> 47:49.900
Uh, and then you can, uh, close them when you're ready for people to get out.

47:49.900 --> 47:52.380
Uh, so a lot of that hasn't changed.

47:52.380 --> 47:57.340
Um, but I know they brought the island back and there's a lot more fruits available thanks

47:57.340 --> 47:58.340
to the island.

47:58.340 --> 48:02.940
Um, some of the other things I noticed is that the story is a lot different because

48:02.940 --> 48:03.940
now you're the mayor.

48:03.940 --> 48:08.820
Uh, so you have an assistant, Isabella, who kind of helps you, or I'm assuming everybody

48:08.820 --> 48:09.820
has the same one.

48:09.820 --> 48:10.820
I don't even know.

48:10.820 --> 48:13.780
Uh, but she kind of helps you through some of the earlier stages of the game.

48:13.780 --> 48:18.320
And yes, it is still about paying off bell debt, but you know, animal crossing kind of

48:18.320 --> 48:20.120
still remains that game.

48:20.120 --> 48:23.520
It's kind of like the Facebook game that you don't have to have a lot of deep shame to

48:23.520 --> 48:27.540
play cause you know, it doesn't have all that like click to invite all your friends.

48:27.540 --> 48:31.780
But um, it's just kind of fun to grow your little neighborhood and interact with the

48:31.780 --> 48:32.780
people.

48:32.780 --> 48:36.180
And then the online element, uh, provides a lot of fun with that.

48:36.180 --> 48:41.320
And it's 35 bucks since it's a handheld game, not 60 like a lot of console games cost.

48:41.320 --> 48:43.220
So I think that's priced pretty good.

48:43.220 --> 48:47.180
Sometimes you just want to do a little bit of fishing, donate it to the museum, make

48:47.180 --> 48:48.180
some bells.

48:48.180 --> 48:51.460
It seems like a lot of people I know are getting animal crossing and that's, I think the real

48:51.460 --> 48:56.540
fun in it is just, you know, trading the fruits and writing nasty letters to somebody else's

48:56.540 --> 49:00.940
villagers and hoping they don't get too mad at what you're saying and all that.

49:00.940 --> 49:04.860
So, um, yeah, I'm happy with my purchase of animal crossing, but, uh, I think most people

49:04.860 --> 49:06.820
kind of know already what to expect with this.

49:06.820 --> 49:09.740
Don't expect like a, a total reinvention of the franchise.

49:09.740 --> 49:14.340
Um, but I wouldn't say it's as simple as, Ooh, now you can sit on a bench too.

49:14.340 --> 49:15.580
There's a little more to it than that.

49:15.580 --> 49:17.580
They, they did a little more design with it.

49:17.580 --> 49:22.280
Um, it feels like a different game, especially if you put like the original GameCube game

49:22.280 --> 49:23.540
next to this game.

49:23.540 --> 49:26.740
You can really see how this series has evolved.

49:26.740 --> 49:27.740
All right.

49:27.740 --> 49:32.140
Uh, anyhow, let's get into a quick housekeeping.

49:32.140 --> 49:39.020
Um, I mentioned this earlier in the show, but do keep an eye on this week, e3.vognetwork.com.

49:39.020 --> 49:42.340
It is our interactive E3 experience at the voice of geeks network.

49:42.340 --> 49:47.900
That's going to be led by a VOG networks, Bobby Black Wolf, who will be on the, uh,

49:47.900 --> 49:50.140
the show floor at E3.

49:50.140 --> 49:54.920
And he will be getting answers to your questions because once Bobby's, you know, done these

49:54.920 --> 49:59.660
appointments and played some of the games, he wants to see what you guys want to hear

49:59.660 --> 50:00.660
about.

50:00.660 --> 50:04.660
But, uh, you know, all we ask, don't ask the obvious things that are already in the press

50:04.660 --> 50:10.940
releases and don't ask about this stinking Xbox used game thing because, you know, we

50:10.940 --> 50:15.380
all know they're not going to comment further on it, but you know, maybe there's a game

50:15.380 --> 50:20.420
that you're not hearing enough about because all this new gen stuff is hogging the spotlight.

50:20.420 --> 50:22.340
Maybe there's something else you want to hear more about.

50:22.340 --> 50:27.540
You have a question about, maybe you're a very passionate fan of, I don't know, tech

50:27.540 --> 50:30.660
in and you want to hear more information about to, although I don't think Namco Bandai has

50:30.660 --> 50:31.660
a booth.

50:31.660 --> 50:35.020
I don't remember, but you know, whatever it is, you want to hear more about it.

50:35.020 --> 50:39.460
Uh, go take a look at e3.vognetwork.com and has all the information you need.

50:39.460 --> 50:43.540
Question submissions open up after the Sony press conference tomorrow when we're really

50:43.540 --> 50:45.660
going to know where things stand.

50:45.660 --> 50:46.660
Okay.

50:46.660 --> 50:50.420
Um, we'll hear from Bobby Black Wolf on that a little more later because we are going to

50:50.420 --> 50:51.980
have a list list later tonight.

50:51.980 --> 50:57.300
Uh, the thing we most want to see happen at e3 2013 that'll be in part B later in the

50:57.300 --> 50:58.300
show.

50:58.300 --> 51:01.820
But first let's run through through some gaming news and Loki start us off.

51:01.820 --> 51:02.820
All right.

51:02.820 --> 51:07.220
So there is a rumor going around that, um, GameStop is discontinuing the Wii U basic

51:07.220 --> 51:10.220
after June 18th.

51:10.220 --> 51:16.500
And um, basically, you know, the rumor comes from that they've been getting it like there's

51:16.500 --> 51:21.220
an internal email saying that they're going to be, um, sending back all the, you know,

51:21.220 --> 51:23.520
basic units and that kind of stuff.

51:23.520 --> 51:29.200
Also um, Nintendo's followed up with this saying that there's current, a current misperception

51:29.200 --> 51:33.660
about the Wii U hardware to clarify Nintendo is working with its retail partners to simply

51:33.660 --> 51:39.700
rebalance the stock of white eight gigabyte systems and black 32 gigabyte Wii U models

51:39.700 --> 51:40.700
in the market.

51:40.700 --> 51:43.540
Consumers looking for either model will continue to find them available.

51:43.540 --> 51:45.940
It doesn't make any sense to me, but okay.

51:45.940 --> 51:52.240
Um, then of course there's a follow up to that where, um, another retailer was saying

51:52.240 --> 51:57.780
that they received an email, um, that they're going to be recalling all the eight gigabyte

51:57.780 --> 51:58.780
systems.

51:58.780 --> 52:03.540
I think if anything, this has to do with the fact that they're talking about, um, putting

52:03.540 --> 52:08.100
out a white, you know, um, made three, two gigabyte system.

52:08.100 --> 52:11.380
I'm wondering if they're just going to get rid of the eight gigabyte system altogether

52:11.380 --> 52:13.900
because maybe that's not as popular.

52:13.900 --> 52:19.220
Um, I know a lot of people that buy Wii U's at least, you know, as far as my customers

52:19.220 --> 52:20.900
are concerned, not a lot of them.

52:20.900 --> 52:22.300
Who's buying the basics?

52:22.300 --> 52:23.300
Not a lot of people.

52:23.300 --> 52:24.580
They want the pack in game.

52:24.580 --> 52:26.460
They want the stuff that comes with the deluxe.

52:26.460 --> 52:29.660
I wouldn't be, I wouldn't blame Nintendo at all if they're phasing the basics out of the

52:29.660 --> 52:30.660
market.

52:30.660 --> 52:36.540
And I think if the 18, the 18th coincides well with, you know, being after E3, so maybe

52:36.540 --> 52:38.920
we'll get an announcement and that's my fingers.

52:38.920 --> 52:42.220
My re my real hope is that they're getting rid of the basics because they're going to

52:42.220 --> 52:46.260
drop the price of the deluxe is down to where the basics are.

52:46.260 --> 52:51.260
That would be phenomenal news and what a great opportunity for Nintendo to kick their competition

52:51.260 --> 52:57.100
in the balls while all this other talk about, you know, the usage restrictions and all this

52:57.100 --> 52:59.180
is going on.

52:59.180 --> 53:03.100
Nintendo could really strike them in the jugular and you might still hate everything that Nintendo

53:03.100 --> 53:06.620
has to offer, but you got to recognize that there's going to be a lot of people that are

53:06.620 --> 53:11.140
here for Mario Kart and, and Mario and all this wouldn't be that hard for them to refurbish

53:11.140 --> 53:15.780
all those old systems to pop that eight gigabyte storage chip off there and put three gigabyte

53:15.780 --> 53:16.900
chip there in place.

53:16.900 --> 53:17.900
Yeah.

53:17.900 --> 53:18.900
So it wouldn't be that hard.

53:18.900 --> 53:23.340
Some could very well could happen.

53:23.340 --> 53:26.940
Alan alchemy in our chat room at live.vog network.com says eight gigabytes is just an

53:26.940 --> 53:32.260
embarrassingly insufficient amount of memory by today's standards, period budget console

53:32.260 --> 53:34.100
or no.

53:34.100 --> 53:35.100
That's very true.

53:35.100 --> 53:36.220
It's not a lot.

53:36.220 --> 53:41.700
So Nintendo has got to catch up, but don't catch up too much to what else is going on

53:41.700 --> 53:42.700
in the world.

53:42.700 --> 53:48.820
Uh, moving on to other news out of E3, uh, Square Enix mentioning what they're going

53:48.820 --> 53:51.420
to be showing at their E3 booth.

53:51.420 --> 53:55.460
Sometimes things get left off of this, but, uh, you know, I'll, I'll, uh, say what there

53:55.460 --> 53:56.460
is so far.

53:56.460 --> 54:02.620
Kingdom hearts, 1.5 remix on PlayStation three final fantasy 14, a realm reborn, uh, which

54:02.620 --> 54:03.620
makes sense.

54:03.620 --> 54:06.900
Cause I believe beta three starts next week comes out in August.

54:06.900 --> 54:07.900
Yeah.

54:07.900 --> 54:08.900
So they're, they're counting down there.

54:08.900 --> 54:10.820
They've also changed restrictions on the beta stuff.

54:10.820 --> 54:11.820
Yes.

54:11.820 --> 54:12.820
NDA is lifted.

54:12.820 --> 54:16.900
So, but still no, um, you're not allowed to say anything on the previous betas.

54:16.900 --> 54:17.900
Okay.

54:17.900 --> 54:22.520
Well, all I got to tell you is next OLR, no live streaming next OLR.

54:22.520 --> 54:23.520
We got a lot to say.

54:23.560 --> 54:28.880
Realm reborn, uh, lightning returns final fantasy 13 being shown off, which I believe

54:28.880 --> 54:32.960
also a release date got spotted on a banner and it's February 14.

54:32.960 --> 54:33.960
Yeah.

54:33.960 --> 54:39.000
Uh, final fantasy 10 and 10, two HD remaster for the Vita and PlayStation three deus X

54:39.000 --> 54:43.520
human revolution director's cut for Wii U and thief.

54:43.520 --> 54:45.560
Another big title on its way.

54:45.560 --> 54:50.080
Now, um, there are rumors that there could be something additional there as well.

54:50.080 --> 54:57.240
Apparently the future of final fantasy being teased for Tuesday, June 11th, nine AM, uh,

54:57.240 --> 55:03.720
rumors and rumblings suggesting it's final fantasy 15, uh, whether that is what 13 verses

55:03.720 --> 55:09.600
has been put through a remodel and that's now 15 or maybe this news is just 13 verses.

55:09.600 --> 55:13.360
No, it's going to be something new for the PlayStation four and the, probably the Xbox

55:13.360 --> 55:17.240
one, because remember the PlayStation four of it, they showed the same fucking trailer

55:17.240 --> 55:22.540
that they had before and they're like, and we'll have more to announce that E3, you know,

55:22.540 --> 55:25.440
so it's, it's going to be something new for next gen.

55:25.440 --> 55:27.760
It's probably going to be using their new engine that they have.

55:27.760 --> 55:28.760
It is sad to me though.

55:28.760 --> 55:32.360
The dragon quest 10 just probably isn't going to happen over here, is it?

55:32.360 --> 55:36.280
I was kind of hoping that maybe they would announce Saturday three, but that maybe they

55:36.280 --> 55:37.760
were just going to solely back Wii U.

55:37.760 --> 55:44.320
I really wish they would try with dragon quest 10, but let's try the dragon quest series

55:44.320 --> 55:45.680
does have a following.

55:45.680 --> 55:46.680
It sure does.

55:46.680 --> 55:51.440
And sure, the following is bigger in Japan, but to write it off here, I don't know.

55:51.440 --> 55:53.200
Maybe dragon quest nine didn't sell well enough.

55:53.200 --> 55:57.920
I also remember they had dragon quests, uh, monsters or whatever that are the one that

55:57.920 --> 55:58.920
they came out over here.

55:58.920 --> 55:59.920
That was the Wii game.

55:59.920 --> 56:05.480
That was first person that did not do well, so all right, moving on.

56:05.480 --> 56:06.480
Quest swords.

56:06.480 --> 56:07.480
That's what it was.

56:07.480 --> 56:08.480
Yeah.

56:08.480 --> 56:09.480
Well this, this is purely rumor.

56:09.480 --> 56:10.480
Okay.

56:10.480 --> 56:11.480
So I'm just going to go ahead and spit it out there.

56:11.480 --> 56:12.920
Allegedly stuff.

56:13.440 --> 56:19.780
Um, there is a rumor going around that Microsoft has been paying off, uh, third party developers

56:19.780 --> 56:26.320
not to show off anything for PlayStation four either on stage or at their booths that Microsoft

56:26.320 --> 56:29.480
has resorted to paying them off for this.

56:29.480 --> 56:34.760
Now I don't know if this is true or not, but the, um, the report came from a source on

56:34.760 --> 56:39.800
Neogaf that's done a lot of true.

56:39.800 --> 56:42.400
Here is your nice big salt lick.

56:42.400 --> 56:43.400
Exactly.

56:43.400 --> 56:44.400
To go with this.

56:44.400 --> 56:45.400
Exactly.

56:45.400 --> 56:50.360
But it did come from someone who in the past has been reliable.

56:50.360 --> 56:57.840
Well this now, this would put way in the column of maybe Sony isn't in the same camp as Microsoft

56:57.840 --> 57:01.720
because otherwise it's, what are you so afraid of Microsoft?

57:01.720 --> 57:07.080
Well, the whole point is that the theory is that if this is really what's going on, the

57:07.080 --> 57:09.520
Microsoft is trying to give the illusion that they're going to have more games available

57:09.520 --> 57:11.080
than the PS4 will.

57:11.640 --> 57:12.960
Which would make them look more attractive.

57:12.960 --> 57:17.440
And it's not that Microsoft and Sony haven't bought, you know, struck at each other financially

57:17.440 --> 57:18.440
before.

57:18.440 --> 57:21.520
I mean, what, uh, Microsoft got a lot of DLC agreements.

57:21.520 --> 57:25.880
Uh, Sony got the whole, uh, valve tie in portal.

57:25.880 --> 57:29.120
Like everybody bought portal two on PlayStation three because everything, well, not everybody,

57:29.120 --> 57:33.720
but a lot of people did because of, you know, their agreements with valve and steam integration,

57:33.720 --> 57:34.720
which was really good.

57:34.720 --> 57:35.720
I got mine on steam.

57:35.720 --> 57:36.720
Yeah.

57:36.720 --> 57:37.720
Well, you got, you bought it.

57:37.720 --> 57:38.720
It was a gift, but still.

57:38.720 --> 57:39.720
Well, you bought it on PS3 and you got it on both.

57:39.720 --> 57:40.720
No, I didn't.

57:41.360 --> 57:44.080
You did, but I mean, I didn't care about it on PS3 at all.

57:44.080 --> 57:47.000
I got it on, on windows.

57:47.000 --> 57:50.880
So paying for exclusives and paying off for stuff like that, that's not really, but it's

57:50.880 --> 57:54.640
just in light of everything else going on in the gaming industry is what makes a lot

57:54.640 --> 58:01.440
of people kind of leech onto this news is, Ooh, yeah, well, and it could just be something

58:01.440 --> 58:07.100
that was thrown out there for the purpose of, uh, you know, making Microsoft look bad

58:07.100 --> 58:08.100
too.

58:08.100 --> 58:14.460
But at the same time, they don't need a Neo GAF thread to do that.

58:14.460 --> 58:20.100
I don't know that at this point that I would put anything past, past them right now, especially

58:20.100 --> 58:23.620
since this type of shit goes on all the time in the corporate world.

58:23.620 --> 58:28.060
So saying, but isn't it weird how Microsoft and Sony would have had to agree to this thing.

58:28.060 --> 58:31.020
And then now they strike at each other in corporate warfare and these other ways.

58:31.020 --> 58:35.140
It's really, it's kind of sick in some ways.

58:35.140 --> 58:36.580
Welcome to corporate America.

58:36.580 --> 58:39.580
Well, welcome to the world corporation.

58:39.580 --> 58:45.740
I know, I know, I know, but I'm saying it's business and in the end what people, what

58:45.740 --> 58:49.740
companies most care about is their bottom line and they will do what they can to increase

58:49.740 --> 58:50.740
it.

58:50.740 --> 58:51.740
End of story.

58:51.740 --> 58:52.740
Loki.

58:52.740 --> 58:53.740
All right.

58:53.740 --> 58:58.600
Um, so let's see, let's talk a little bit about plants versus zombies.

58:58.600 --> 59:03.280
And um, you may remember they had an announcement for plants versus zombies too.

59:03.280 --> 59:04.280
It's about time.

59:04.420 --> 59:09.520
Well now there's some actual, uh, banners being spotted at E3 showing plants versus

59:09.520 --> 59:11.760
zombies garden warfare.

59:11.760 --> 59:13.040
I am excited.

59:13.040 --> 59:16.360
Which is, um, rumors to be true.

59:16.360 --> 59:20.480
I think they were saying that it's a multiplayer first person shooter game.

59:20.480 --> 59:24.920
So I am no longer excited.

59:24.920 --> 59:27.560
Well, there's still the plants versus zombies too.

59:27.560 --> 59:29.000
I'm excited about that.

59:29.000 --> 59:30.000
The first person shooter?

59:30.000 --> 59:31.000
No.

59:31.000 --> 59:32.000
Yeah.

59:32.000 --> 59:37.160
I remember, I remember actually hearing about that before, so it'll be interesting to see

59:37.160 --> 59:38.320
what that's like.

59:38.320 --> 59:42.480
I'm thinking maybe a little bit like that Batman, um, what was it?

59:42.480 --> 59:52.280
The uh, the uh, Batman game that they had on the Xbox live arcade, uh, Gotham imposter

59:52.280 --> 59:57.120
or yeah, that one, Oh, the Gotham kids or something like that.

59:57.120 --> 59:58.120
I don't like it.

59:58.120 --> 59:59.120
Yeah.

59:59.120 --> 01:00:01.120
It's like, uh, somebody in chattel yell it out.

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:02.120
I don't remember.

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:03.120
Anyways.

01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:05.440
Um, Oh, neat.

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:11.840
I guess we'll have to, you know, hear about it on, uh, during E3 or EA's press conference.

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:13.380
I guess they're going to have that on Monday.

01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:16.240
So I'm watching all of those.

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:17.240
That'd be fantastic.

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:18.240
And yeah, me too.

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:20.200
You want to hear something kind of funny off topic here a little bit.

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:23.040
Um, I was looking on new gap just a second here.

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:27.120
Um, they put out a reminder that there was this thing that leaked last year.

01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:29.360
Remember about their kind of a game plan.

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:30.360
Yeah.

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:37.120
And, uh, the, the actual marketing position that they had on, uh, their, you know, for

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:40.600
2013 is this one box input one.

01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:45.320
So that, that's the same slogan that they have at E3 now.

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:49.080
So playing a little bit more to maybe that was legitimate.

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:50.080
Yeah.

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:51.080
Huh?

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:54.680
It's always nice when those rumors end up being true a year after the fact, right.

01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:59.280
In retrospect, Oh, we could have known all along if we would just believe this one rumor.

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:01.720
Well, it still shows through 2015.

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:05.320
So, you know, I guess we'll have to see, you know, what that's all about.

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:08.520
Uh, Akuma JP in our chat room with a very interesting comparison.

01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:12.680
We were talking earlier, the whole corporate warfare with, um, Sony and Microsoft Akuma

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:16.800
JP in our chat says, look at Apple and Samsung.

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:21.040
That's another good comparison because those two, they have to work together for some things,

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:25.200
but then they're at each other's throats with courts and lawsuits and everything.

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:27.520
It's, um, fascinating how that all works.

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:28.520
Okay.

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:33.440
Here's if, if that member of that whole thing, uh, the, you know, PDF that came out last

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:34.440
year.

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:41.080
So here's what the next game plan then would be for to Zilla glasses, digital glasses that

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:44.200
allow you to see 3d objects in your living room.

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:45.920
That's augmented reality stuff.

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:50.920
So that's going to be next year, apparently according to the roadmap.

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:52.200
What about the alumina room?

01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:54.760
When's that supposed to be a thing next year too, I think.

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:55.760
Hmm.

01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:56.760
Hmm.

01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:57.760
Interesting.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000
All right.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.640
Um, moving on, I talked earlier in the show about animal crossing and I know one reason

01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:05.480
everybody loved the game cube version of animal crossing.

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:10.160
And some people arguably say it's their favorite is because it had all the classic NES games

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:11.160
in it.

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:15.480
Remember how you could play punch out and clue clue land and all these Nintendo games

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:16.480
in animal crossing.

01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:22.880
Well, this will probably be a bit of a duh, but in an interview with the Katsuya Eguchi,

01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:27.920
um, he basically, and this is an interview, uh, that he had out there, he said that please

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:32.800
consider it's not happening ever again in regards to virtual console at the time of

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:36.800
animal crossing on the game cube, we didn't have a virtual console system.

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:40.720
We thought the playing games inside of a game is kind of funny and we wanted to do it, but

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:43.840
now there's a virtual console where you can play classic games.

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:46.360
So we don't think we'll be doing that in future titles.

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:50.600
So kind of confirmation that, yeah, they're not going to bring those NES games back in

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:54.200
the other systems and it's really virtual console's fault because they can make money

01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:55.800
selling those games separately.

01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:59.320
However, part of the reason I want to bring this up is because when I was reading this

01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:05.040
article on destructoid.com who ran with this article, I really liked an idea that was proposed.

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:08.760
Now I wanted to kind of put this out there by the author of destructoid.com who said,

01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:13.000
uh, there's more that could be done to appease those looking for retro flavor in a new animal

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.340
crossing adventure.

01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:19.720
A nice compromise would be to include some special eight bit animal crossing themed games

01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:21.400
in the next entry of the series.

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:26.120
Um, in the game cube title, tortimer might give you a fake NES game called super tortimer

01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:27.680
on April 1st.

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:31.760
What if super tortimer were playable, a little 10 minute long platformer starring a turtle

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:37.000
mayor and maybe a few other fake but fun lo-fi NES on animal crossing mini games.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.480
And I'm like, I love that idea.

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:41.020
That's a fantastic, fantastic idea.

01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:44.640
Like what, you know, just silly little flash games to be collectible.

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:47.520
I think that would be a great thing for the series granted, you know, it's going to be

01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:52.060
a lot of development costs and somebody's got to design all that design as a contest.

01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:53.360
You have a bunch of indie dev.

01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:55.460
I was just a crowdsource the fucker.

01:03:55.460 --> 01:04:00.320
You just have a bunch of indie devs just creating a bit shit for it and you could even market

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:02.600
that as a reason to buy the game, but I don't know.

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:06.040
I just don't see Nintendo as somebody who would, uh, crowdsource like that.

01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:07.040
You know what I mean?

01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:09.480
But yeah, that would be awesome.

01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:10.480
Too bad.

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:13.840
Oh, you know, Nintendo, if you're thinking about that Wii U version of animal crossing,

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:17.480
here's a, Oh, Oh, this could, this could really bring a lot of people back.

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:23.760
Or just, you know, maybe just give us, you know, those NES games.

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:28.960
Cause come on, you've already made your money back and then like, who the fuck's going to

01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:30.360
buy clue clue land.

01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:31.360
Let's be real.

01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:32.360
It wasn't that good.

01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:34.880
Donkey Kong math or who's going to buy that shit.

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:36.280
Come on.

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:40.320
Um, what you would buy donkey Kong math.

01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:45.320
No, but I have picked up a copy of clue clue land when I saw it at the store.

01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:46.320
You're a nerd though.

01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:47.320
Shut up.

01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:48.320
I have memories of clue clue land.

01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:49.320
Don't, don't judge me.

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:53.320
Uh, while I are in chat says, but I do have to buy a third party hack this to unlock them

01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:54.320
all this time.

01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:55.320
Um, yeah.

01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:59.320
Cause remember super Mario brothers and Zelda were in the original animal crossing, but

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:01.320
you couldn't get them without a code.

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:03.320
Like they were never actually given out.

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:09.320
You had to get, you had to code them to do it, uh, or, or use the link from Hyrule website

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:12.320
that was big back in the day where everybody had the same character name.

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:14.320
So you could just gift yourself all this stuff.

01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:15.320
Pretty funny.

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:18.320
Um, what else do I want to say with that?

01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:22.320
Uh, Oh, here's one other thing I would say is that if they do these whole like little

01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:27.320
flash games that they put inside animal crossing, they could almost one up virtual console.

01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:33.320
And like, how about little achievements within animal crossing and leaderboards within animal

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:34.320
crossing.

01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:39.320
Suddenly animal crossing is what we all thought PlayStation home was going to be.

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:41.320
Think about it.

01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:42.320
Womp, womp.

01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:43.320
All right.

01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:44.320
Anyway.

01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:50.320
Well, how about, uh, something that's a little bit happier, Rob?

01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:51.320
Okay.

01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:54.320
Um, how about something that has nothing to do with Nintendo?

01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:57.320
I don't know if that's going to be happier this week.

01:05:57.320 --> 01:06:01.320
Nintendo is kind of my, my safe room.

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:03.320
Nintendo is my safe word this week.

01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:08.320
Remember if it gets a little bit too hard for you, just say PlayStation.

01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:17.320
Uh, this actually has to do with, um, an exclusive for PS3 that will be, uh, launching on Tuesday.

01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:19.320
Tekken revolution is going to be on PS3.

01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:21.320
It will be free to play.

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:25.320
And you know, me and my Tekken, I worked for Namco.

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:29.320
I remember Tekken three and trying to predict who the next character would be.

01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:30.320
So I have to say that.

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:32.320
And trying to predict who the next character would be.

01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:36.320
So I have special, special love of, of anything Tekken.

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:39.320
Especially anything that has a Jin Kazama in it.

01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:41.320
Yeah, but isn't this just going to be the dumb trading card game?

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:42.320
You know what?

01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:48.320
It says, um, that, uh, basically it's going to be, I'm trying to see what it says.

01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:51.320
It's going to be, uh, yes.

01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:57.320
Being, um, referred to as a new version of Tekken card tournament, which you know, it's funny.

01:06:57.320 --> 01:07:00.320
I even had the stupid Tekken card game on the wondrous one.

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:03.320
So I will go to links to play anything Tekken.

01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:05.320
So I'm just saying, don't judge me.

01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:06.320
At least this one's free.

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:08.320
Yeah. I like free.

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:10.320
Who doesn't?

01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:11.320
Especially cause I'm broke.

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:14.320
Well, if you hate free and you want to buy something this week.

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:15.320
Get the X bone.

01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:19.320
If you hate freedom, buy an Xbox one.

01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:23.320
No, uh, seriously, what is coming out this week around the world?

01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:24.320
US first Loki.

01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:25.320
Nothing really.

01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:28.320
Um, well one game, the last of us on Friday.

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:29.320
On Friday.

01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:31.320
Arguably a big fucking game.

01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:34.320
Yeah. Great reviews, but Friday?

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:35.320
What?

01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:38.320
Well, you know, got to get down on Friday.

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:40.320
I guess, you know, they want to make sure.

01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:42.320
Got to get down to Disneyland.

01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:47.320
Want to make sure that it isn't released on Tuesday with all that, you know, E3 news getting, you know, lost in the shuffle there.

01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:48.320
So, all right.

01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:51.320
Well, traveling to Japan and seeing if there's anything additional this week.

01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:54.320
Um, not so much on the PlayStation 3.

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:56.320
PlayStation 3 is looking pretty empty this week.

01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:57.320
Xbox 360.

01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:58.320
You'd be surprised.

01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:00.320
There is a game on Xbox 360 this week.

01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:04.320
It's called Giga Force and Esketos Wonder Pack.

01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:07.320
I don't know if that's just like the combination, like a combination two for one thing.

01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:09.320
Yeah, it is definitely a two for one pack.

01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:10.320
I'm looking at the box art.

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:13.320
These look to be 3D spacey shooter games.

01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:15.320
Like, uh, mechs.

01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:17.320
Oh, it's, is this?

01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:19.320
Oh, it's got classic games in there too.

01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:20.320
I see.

01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:22.320
Judgment, Silver Sword, Cardinal Sins.

01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:27.320
If you're a SHMUP fan, this might be the compilation for you.

01:08:27.320 --> 01:08:29.320
That is out on the Xbox 360 this week.

01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:33.320
Is it just me or does Xbox 360 get so many SHMUPs over in Japan?

01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:35.320
Like, it's the SHMUP console.

01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:36.320
Oh, that's good to know.

01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:40.320
Yeah, but especially, uh, bullet hell games?

01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:41.320
Please.

01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:44.320
Uh, looking at the other systems.

01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:46.320
Sadly, not a lot this week.

01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:49.320
3DS is really the only other thing that's seeing some releases.

01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:52.320
Donkey Kong Returns makes its way to Japan this week.

01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:56.320
And, uh, there's a Nintendo metallic red 3DS to match.

01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:59.320
Also, one other game from Square Enix this week.

01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:04.320
Chusoku Henkai Gyro Zetter, Albatross no Tsubasa comes out this week.

01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:05.320
And this is...

01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:07.320
Wings of the Albatross?

01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:12.320
Yes, it looks like another mech fighting game slash role playing game type thing.

01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:18.320
Aren't Albatrosses usually associated with bad modical things?

01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:22.320
Maybe they're mechs that swim, Dark Sakura. I don't know.

01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:24.320
I don't think Albatrosses can swim.

01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:27.320
I think they just die and hang around your neck.

01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:34.320
Speaking of dying and hanging around your neck, I'm done with the Japanese game releases this week.

01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:36.320
Well, we have a few things for the UK.

01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:40.320
On the 11th, we have Tekken Revolution, as I brought up earlier.

01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:43.320
On the 12th, we have Xenoclash on the Xbox 360.

01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:48.320
And on the 14th, Animal Crossing 3DS, Chemical Spillage Simulation for PC,

01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:52.320
which actually just sounds hilarious without knowing anything about it.

01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:54.320
And then The Last of Us on PS3.

01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:56.320
That's it.

01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:00.320
Stick a fork in it, speaking of dead things.

01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:03.320
Okay, um, let's see.

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:08.320
There is some interesting controversy with this game, Vampire Smile,

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:14.320
which was one of those, well, it originally started off as the Dishwasher,

01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:19.320
one of the first Xbox indie games that they showed off.

01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:23.320
Actually, I think while they were introducing indie games,

01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:26.320
or what did it used to be called? Community games? Way back in the day?

01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:31.320
Anyway, so the sequel to Dishwasher, the Vampire Smile, was coming to PC.

01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:38.320
But originally, the first way it came to the PC was a hacker,

01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:41.320
I guess a developer, Barbarus.

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:45.320
He really wanted to see the game come to PC, so he cracked a version of it

01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:47.320
and uploaded it, I guess, to the internet.

01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:50.320
And so he kind of ported it to PC.

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:55.320
Well now, it's actually coming officially to PC as well,

01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:59.320
because they weren't too happy with the fact that he cracked the game and stuff.

01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:05.320
So, new Director's Cut is going to have some enhancements to the game and some more...

01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:07.320
That's not a good precedent to set, though.

01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:11.320
Like, you know, hack our game and we'll put it on the console you want.

01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:14.320
They didn't remember, was it Sonic Generations?

01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:16.320
They had the Sonic...

01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:20.320
The hell is the crappy one with the werehog?

01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:23.320
They had all the daylight missions from that game.

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:26.320
Ask this one. I don't know, I can't tell all those Sonic games apart.

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:27.320
She can.

01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:29.320
Which Sonic game? Sonic Unleashed, I think it was.

01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:30.320
I hadn't played that one.

01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:36.320
Yeah, Sonic Unleashed, they had the daytime levels from that ported over to Sonic Generations for the PC,

01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:38.320
because it never came out on PC.

01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:41.320
I do have Sonic Generations and I haven't even played it yet.

01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:48.320
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:51.320
use the passphrase, TICKET.

01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:55.320
To answer a code, man, I don't acknowledge that in my universe.

01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:59.320
What? Acknowledge what? Don't have a one-sided conversation here.

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:00.320
Kiefer Sutherland.

01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:02.320
Hey, that's coming up later in the show. Stop spoiling things.

01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:03.320
I know.

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:04.320
Stop spoiling it.

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:05.320
I still don't like thinking about it.

01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:06.320
Spoiler. Alright.

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:08.320
You know what, Rob?

01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:11.320
What? No spoilers here. This is news.

01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:15.320
This is about Starcraft 2. I will admit this is the one Blizzard franchise I don't play a lot of.

01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:18.320
I owned the very first game, I didn't bother with the expansion.

01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:21.320
But, apparently, I may not need it.

01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:25.320
Because there's a new system in Starcraft 2 that Blizzard did this week called spawning.

01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:30.320
And I thought that meant maybe a new enemy unit. Isn't that what zergs do? They spawn a lot of zergs.

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:37.320
But, anyway, what happens is you get free access to gameplay features when somebody who doesn't own a certain version of the game

01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:39.320
parties with someone who did.

01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:44.320
So, in other words, when you go into multiplayer, you play the most current version of the game owned by at least one person at the party.

01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:49.320
So, if you have the free starter edition, but you come play with me and I have Starcraft 2 basic edition,

01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:52.320
we're now both playing Starcraft 2 basic edition.

01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:57.320
So, that's kind of cool. That's like DS1 cartridge play or something like that.

01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:01.320
If I party up with somebody playing Heart of the Swarm, we both get to play Heart of the Swarm.

01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:06.320
It's been rolling out globally since June 4th when this was announced.

01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:12.320
I don't know what regions do and don't have it at this time, but this is something that is planned for everybody.

01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:15.320
So, that's kind of awesome, actually.

01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:20.320
Because if you have a core group of four friends that you just want to do nothing but play Starcraft with,

01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:23.320
maybe one of you is a big Starcraft nerd, but the others aren't so much,

01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:29.320
one person buys the game, everybody mooches off it, and you just don't play otherwise.

01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:31.320
That's kind of cool.

01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:32.320
Yes.

01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:35.320
It's almost like if you had a game and then you load it to their friends,

01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:39.320
and then they got really excited about the game and bought the sequel and it came out at launch.

01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:41.320
Oh, we can't have that.

01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:44.320
We can't. We can't do that. It cuts into developer money.

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:46.320
To be fair, although I love your tongue-in-cheek point there,

01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:51.320
let's not forget Starcraft 2 does require an always-online connection just because that's the nature of the game.

01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:56.320
You're right, because the PC marketplace is completely different than the console marketplace.

01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:59.320
Because they don't require an online connection there either.

01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:04.320
Can we go back to a time when there wasn't any of this always-online bullshit?

01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:09.320
Although I will say, I do love my MMOs. I do love me my MMOs.

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:12.320
However, I also love classic games, and that's why every week on the show,

01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:15.320
DarkSakura jumps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,

01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:20.320
hey, kids, play this game or I'm going to cut you.

01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:24.320
I cut you off with my razor-sharp wit.

01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:27.320
DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week this week?

01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:29.320
Star Gladiator.

01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:35.320
Or as it was called over here, Star Gladiator Episode 1 Final Crusade.

01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:38.320
Yeah, Episode 1 Final Crusade. What's up with that?

01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:41.320
Okay, so anyway, it came out in 1996.

01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:46.320
It was a 3D fighting game done by Capcom for the PlayStation.

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:51.320
Well, actually for the ZN1 arcade, which was basically a glorified PlayStation.

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:56.320
It was their first polygon fighting game.

01:14:56.320 --> 01:15:02.320
It actually came out before Street Fighter EX, so this was kind of a big thing for them.

01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:08.320
It was a pretty neat little game, I mean, as far as a 3D fighter goes.

01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:16.320
It didn't use the six button thing. It used a four button configuration.

01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:21.320
It was a lot like how the Soul Edge and Soul Calibur games went.

01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:26.320
You had a 3D plane. You could do ring outs. It was that type of game.

01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:32.320
It wasn't really anything that was special as far as 3D fighting games at the time,

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:35.320
but the fact that it was Capcom's first makes it notable.

01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:40.320
It also had these things called plasma reverses that are guard moves

01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:45.320
that you have to release at a particular point in time in the battle,

01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:49.320
where it will enable you to deflect an incoming move and stun them

01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:53.320
so that you could actually attack in reverse.

01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:59.320
It also does extra damage as well.

01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:05.320
It also had a combo system so that you could basically just pummel people to death.

01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:11.320
In the arcade mode, it was ten fights, and depending on who you chose as your character,

01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:15.320
you had a specific set of opponents that you would fight.

01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:17.320
It was actually a pretty good game.

01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:20.320
You see some notable characters in there that showed up in other Capcom games,

01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:24.320
like Hayato showed up in Marvel vs. Capcom 2,

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:31.320
and he had an appearance in Tatunoko vs. Capcom in the Tekkaman Blade ending,

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:34.320
which actually kind of made me giddy at the time.

01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:41.320
And there was Jun, who was also in the background stages of Gem Fighter,

01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:45.320
and in Capcom vs. SNK 2,

01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:50.320
and in one of the wind poses of Hayato in Marvel vs. Capcom 2.

01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:54.320
And she was also in Hawkeye's ending in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3

01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:57.320
as a member of the West Coast Avengers, which, actually, that was pretty crazy,

01:16:57.320 --> 01:16:59.320
because I beat that game with him.

01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:07.320
There was Saturn Dyer, Gamoth, Gogri, Franco, Garrett, Vector, Rim Gal,

01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:09.320
who was Jun's dad.

01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:13.320
There's a bunch of people in the game, anyway.

01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:22.320
It was a really neat game in that it used both English and Japanese voice acting

01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:25.320
for the characters.

01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:34.320
And it also spawned a Dreamcast game that was called Plasma Sword,

01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:38.320
Nightmare of Bliss, which is actually me finding my Dreamcast copies,

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:41.320
what made me think of the PlayStation version.

01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:43.320
But it was a really neat game.

01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:53.320
I mean, for all of the stuff that it did, it may not seem a big deal today,

01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:55.320
but when it came out, I thought it was a really cool game.

01:17:55.320 --> 01:18:01.320
So, Star Gladiator, you win Classic Game of the Week.

01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:05.320
I have to admit, I didn't know a lot about this game until I'm kind of watching the,

01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:07.320
as with a lot of these classic games you pick.

01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:09.320
I didn't know a lot about this one, but I'm watching it and I'm like,

01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:11.320
wow, this looked pretty good for a PlayStation 1 game.

01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:14.320
It looks a little more Dreamcast level to me.

01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:16.320
Is it late PS1?

01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:18.320
I'd say it was late PS1.

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:25.320
But you should see Star Gladiator was actually a really fun little fighter.

01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:29.320
It had its issues just about with any PlayStation 1 game at the time,

01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:34.320
but you should really see Plasma Sword because that was really fun, too.

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:37.320
This character here, June, I really like her, too.

01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:38.320
With the chakram?

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:41.320
Yeah, well, she reminds me of that chicken Soul Calibur, Tina, I think it is,

01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:44.320
with a similar feel, the big disc.

01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:49.320
And actually, that's who I played this game most with was June.

01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:53.320
But you should, one of these days we'll have to hook up the Dreamcast

01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:54.320
and I'll bring over Plasma Sword.

01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:55.320
I have a Dreamcast.

01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:56.320
So do I.

01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:57.320
In fact.

01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:59.320
But I have Plasma Sword and I will bring it over.

01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:02.320
This is why I need to get game streaming on my TV

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:06.320
because we need to do some classic NES game streaming through the Dreamcast emulation.

01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:07.320
Good times.

01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:09.320
That would be wrong, but funny.

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:12.320
All right, there it is, the classic game of the week, Star Gladiator.

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:13.320
Star Gladiator.

01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:17.320
Oh, actually, I need to point out, Cleric Player 404 did remind me.

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:20.320
She's using the combo attack of Chun-Li and Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo.

01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:21.320
Who was?

01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:22.320
June.

01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:23.320
Really?

01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:24.320
Yes.

01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:25.320
I don't remember that.

01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:26.320
Well, there were cosplay.

01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:28.320
I mean, not that I believe you, but I'm just...

01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:30.320
There were costume combos, remember?

01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:32.320
Where people would dress up as different...

01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:34.320
Oh, yeah.

01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:38.320
And like, I think one of Ibuki's was like the Miko costume

01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:43.320
and Sakura had a bunch of different ones and one of Chun-Li's was June.

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:44.320
All right.

01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:46.320
From Star Gladiator.

01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:47.320
All right.

01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:48.320
Very cool.

01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:52.320
All right, we got plenty more show to go here.

01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:55.320
Coming up with Part B tonight, we have a list list coming up tonight.

01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:57.320
Few surprises in store with list list tonight.

01:19:57.320 --> 01:19:58.320
That's all I'm going to say.

01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:00.320
You are definitely going to want to be here live for this.

01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:02.320
Sorry to the podcasters in advance.

01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:04.320
Very cool live feature tonight.

01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:06.320
And the Fugu question of the week as well.

01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:09.320
And rapid fire news, the mailbag, FUs of the Week,

01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:14.320
and your calls at 1-877-GAMO-LR and username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:17.320
All when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:27.320
Hi there.

01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:30.320
This is Flaco Jones and you're participating with Orange Lounge Radio,

01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:32.320
the show where every gamer has a voice.

01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:35.320
And I want to use my voice to tell you you should all play Ni No Kuni.

01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:36.320
It's great.

01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:38.320
Rob, you should beat Ni No Kuni.

01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:40.320
And now that I said it in the bumper, you have to beat Ni No Kuni

01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:42.320
or you have to play this bumper forever.

01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:46.320
Looks like I'm playing the bumper forever because I still haven't beat Ni No Kuni.

01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:48.320
You can lend me your copy then.

01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:49.320
You want to hear a true story?

01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:51.320
I came in the other day, Ni No Kuni.

01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:52.320
I came back from Phoenix.

01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:54.320
My copy of Ni No Kuni is on the floor and I'm like,

01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:55.320
oh, it's on the floor.

01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:58.320
That means Alan must have picked it up and started playing it at some point, right?

01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:00.320
And he said, oh, no, I used it to put kitty treats on.

01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:03.320
Can I borrow it, though?

01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:06.320
Yeah, if you're actually going to play it, then yes.

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:07.320
I will.

01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:08.320
Okay, I think you'll like it, actually.

01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:09.320
So, yes, you may borrow it.

01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:10.320
I'm fun employed.

01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:12.320
I think Flaco would approve of that.

01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:14.320
Yes, we did recycle a message this week.

01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:16.320
That means we could use some new bumpers.

01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:20.320
I did get one today, to be fair, so I'll put that in for next week.

01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:25.320
But if you want to submit a bumper as well, you can get all the information at the Voice Geeks Network,

01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:26.320
voggenetwork.com.

01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:28.320
Click on forums and look at the OLR forum.

01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:32.320
It's right there at the top in a sticky thread how you can get your voice in a bumper on the show.

01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:35.320
And you can tell the listeners whatever you want, within reason.

01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:40.320
I even did one in not that great Japanese, but thanks to Kuma JP for correcting my grammar.

01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:45.320
Oh, I'm talking about the ones that, not the ones that play on the network, but the ones that bring us back here.

01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:47.320
But I'm planning on actually doing one.

01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:48.320
But you're on the show.

01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:50.320
I can do a bumper.

01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:51.320
No, you can't.

01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:52.320
Yes, I can.

01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:53.320
Do a bumper for Bobby's show.

01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:54.320
I'll do one for Bobby.

01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:58.320
I'll do one for Bobby that says, hey, listen to this show, dammit.

01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:03.320
Hey, hey, listen, hey, listen, hey, listen.

01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:05.320
But I have to make it high-pitched.

01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:06.320
Hey, listen.

01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:11.320
Anyhow, plenty more to come here on this half of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:13.320
But first, some rapid-fire news.

01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:16.320
Let's take care of a lot of news this week in rapid-fire news.

01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:22.320
Yes, so it sort of leaked out, and then it got announced, Halo Spartan Assault.

01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:31.320
It's coming out for all your favorite gaming platforms, including Windows 8 PCs, tablets, and phones.

01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:35.320
And those are Windows 8 devices, by the way.

01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:38.320
Windows Phone, Surface tablets.

01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:47.320
Yeah, and apparently it's going to be set between Halo 3 and 4, and is a twin-six shooter.

01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:51.320
So, totally the title you're looking for.

01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:57.320
There's some free-to-play games coming to the PlayStation 4.

01:22:57.320 --> 01:23:03.320
PlanetSide 2 and DC Universe Online have both been confirmed for the PlayStation 4,

01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:06.320
although I'm not surprised because it's Sony Online, so you know.

01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:08.320
Those are Sony Online games.

01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:12.320
But somewhere I hear Brad from PodCulture squeeing about the DC Universe Online.

01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:13.320
Just call it a hunch.

01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:14.320
Yeah.

01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:15.320
If his internet's back up.

01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:17.320
So, those will both be coming out.

01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:22.320
And also, Warframe is going to be coming as well as a free-to-play title.

01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:25.320
And, yeah.

01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:31.320
So, I guess we're going to see a lot of free-to-play games on PlayStation 4, so that could be good or bad.

01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:32.320
I don't know.

01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:33.320
Free-to-play is not...

01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:36.320
I like that business model, so we'll see.

01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:38.320
You like free?

01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:40.320
I like free, yeah.

01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:41.320
It's awesome.

01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:44.320
Do you think there will be a lot of free games on Xbox One?

01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:47.320
I think there's got to be some.

01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:49.320
That's the world we live in now.

01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:53.320
I'm just wondering if there's going to be any MMOs on Xbox One,

01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:58.320
because remember, there wasn't really much on, you know, the Xbox 360,

01:23:58.320 --> 01:23:59.320
aside from Final Fantasy.

01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:04.320
And I guess, you know, there's some pay-to-play MMOs, you know, like the Defiance and stuff,

01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:09.320
but none like actual traditional MMOs beyond Final Fantasy XI.

01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:10.320
Don't know.

01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:11.320
So, it'll be interesting.

01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:16.320
And last but not least, new Harmonix title was announced last week,

01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:20.320
and that was Fantasia Music Evolved.

01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:25.320
And I saw the trailer, and I'm like, that has very little to do with Fantasia.

01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:26.320
Here's the thing.

01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:29.320
I love Harmonix. I love Disney.

01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:30.320
Do we get Elephants and Tutus?

01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:35.320
Maybe, actually. I love Harmonix. I love Disney. I hate Bruno Mars.

01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:37.320
Why was that in the trailer?

01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:38.320
But, but, but.

01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:39.320
Why?

01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:41.320
But, they're going to have pop music.

01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:42.320
They're also going to have-

01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:43.320
That's not Fantasia.

01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:47.320
But they're also going to have the classical music as well.

01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:50.320
And Bohemian Rhapsody is going to be in it.

01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:52.320
Anything with Queen is instantly better, yeah.

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:55.320
Queen is one of the artists, you know, confirmed.

01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:58.320
Instant fantasticness. Just add Freddie Mercury.

01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:01.320
Here's the tracks announced so far.

01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:03.320
Does it make him a Disney Queen?

01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:08.320
So, Bohemian Rhapsody, Kimbra Settle Down.

01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:09.320
I don't know what that is.

01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:10.320
Have you-

01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:11.320
Fun Some Nights.

01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:14.320
Hold on. Just in case Dark Soccer hadn't seen this yet,

01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:17.320
I'm playing this in studio, the little teaser trailer for this.

01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:18.320
Let me skip ahead a little bit.

01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:24.320
So, basically, it's Sorcerer Mickey mode.

01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:26.320
Yeah, it's like your, like, Sorcerer Mickey,

01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:29.320
but it doesn't really, like, tell you what the game is.

01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:30.320
Like, where's the game here?

01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:33.320
I'm left to think it's Rhythm Party.

01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:36.320
It, yeah. It looks like Rhythm Party.

01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:39.320
Which I said Rhythm Party should have just been a retail release

01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:41.320
with all the tracks, but whatever.

01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:45.320
You know what? I don't care, because I don't really like connect games.

01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:48.320
The thing that's kind of unique, I guess, about it, supposedly,

01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:51.320
is you can control, like, the tempo of the song,

01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:54.320
and, like, it changes depending on, like, stuff you do, I guess.

01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:56.320
So that's gonna be kind of neat.

01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:59.320
One of the tracks in there, was it AVI-

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:00.320
What was it?

01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:01.320
Black Wolf in chat says,

01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:03.320
Game trailers actually showed gameplay.

01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:04.320
It's Elite Beat agents connect.

01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:06.320
Oh, so it's Rhythm Party.

01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:07.320
Like I said.

01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:10.320
And you see this face that no one in the chat room can see?

01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:12.320
This is my no one curface.

01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:16.320
I'm willing to give it a shot just because I really love harmonics,

01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:18.320
and they always put out quality.

01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:20.320
I love harmonics, but I hate connect games.

01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:23.320
Fair.

01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:27.320
And Levels is also one of the songs in there,

01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:30.320
which, if I remember correctly, I think that's-

01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:31.320
Let's see here.

01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:36.320
If I wanted to get up and dance, I'd take a Zumba class.

01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:38.320
Oh, yeah. Actually, I do like Levels.

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:43.320
Levels is awesome because that was one of the songs that was in Forza Horizon,

01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:46.320
one of my favorite ones on the dubstep thing.

01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:48.320
So I'm digging it.

01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:49.320
You know, I think it'd be kind of cool.

01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:51.320
Harmonics, can't go wrong with them, so.

01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:53.320
Bobby gave me a link to this, and I hadn't seen it.

01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:56.320
So, where's the actual gameplay?

01:26:57.320 --> 01:26:59.320
I just hear a dude talking.

01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:00.320
Let's see gameplay.

01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:04.320
Is that Under the Sea?

01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:07.320
Down where it's wetter.

01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:08.320
Under the sea.

01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:10.320
Oh, see, there it is.

01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:12.320
I guess.

01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:16.320
Okay, so this is not Rhythm Party.

01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:20.320
Huh.

01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:26.320
Alright.

01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:27.320
It's like-

01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:28.320
Curious.

01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:29.320
Put out a demo.

01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:30.320
It seems like a game that-

01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:32.320
I want a new Para Para Paradise, then I would play my Kinect.

01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:33.320
You know what?

01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:35.320
You know what they really needed to have?

01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:38.320
Is they need to have Q games and fucking Harmonics come together

01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:41.320
and do a new Child of Eden type of game,

01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:43.320
because Child of Eden was fucking awesome.

01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:44.320
It was pretty good.

01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:46.320
ClericalEra404 in our chat quickly wants to know,

01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:48.320
DarkSakura, why do you hate Kinect games?

01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:50.320
Because usually they show you what you're doing

01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:52.320
and I don't like to watch myself.

01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:57.320
Uh, you can sometimes turn camera off.

01:27:57.320 --> 01:27:59.320
Yeah, if I can turn the camera off, I have no problem with it.

01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:02.320
Oh, I would have just thought you just don't like the whole flailing around.

01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:03.320
That's just-

01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:06.320
Well, I don't mind flailing around as long as nobody else is over.

01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:07.320
I mean-

01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:10.320
I was gonna say, to be fair, the original Kinect game's

01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:12.320
not exactly very accurate a lot of times.

01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:14.320
Yeah, that was that too.

01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:16.320
I mean, the only fun I've ever had playing a Kinect game

01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:19.320
was doing Para Para on Dance Masters,

01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:23.320
which is why that's still the only Kinect game I will play.

01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:25.320
Alright, let me move on with some other news.

01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:28.320
Maybe DarkSakura instead would rather play Injustice.

01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:31.320
I know she loves DC Universe, but-

01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:33.320
Do I like DC Universe?

01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:36.320
No, but apparently Injustice is pretty good.

01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:39.320
Somebody said Injustice is the best thing going on in DC Universe right now.

01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:41.320
It was a freaking stupid looking game.

01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:44.320
Well, there's Mortal Kombat crossover coming to Injustice,

01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:46.320
which I'm sure will surprise nobody.

01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:50.320
Scorpion will be the next playable character in Injustice Gods Among Us DLC,

01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:54.320
400 Microsoft points or $5, but none for Wii U buy.

01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:55.320
Why?

01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:56.320
Why not?

01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:59.320
Why not? Because they have a whole bunch of other DC superheroes

01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:01.320
that they could put in the game.

01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:02.320
Scorpion's a superhero.

01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:04.320
No, he's not. Now he's like fucking-

01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:05.320
I'm just trolling.

01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:08.320
It's like, oh hey, it's Scorpion, but I can't do any of my bloody moves

01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:10.320
because it's fucking teen rated.

01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:15.320
That's what happened with the whole Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe.

01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:19.320
Oh, sorry, I can't behead Batman because it's fucking teen rated.

01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:22.320
I don't know, whatever. It sounds lame.

01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:25.320
I honestly did not find the game fun. The end.

01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:28.320
Also, information on the new Voice of Snake,

01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:32.320
because a certain co-host of mine didn't ruin this earlier in the show,

01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:36.320
but Kiefer Sutherland confirmed as the voice of Snake in Metal Gear Solid 5,

01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:38.320
not David Hayter.

01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:43.320
Now, I think this was just like buzz earlier.

01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:46.320
We didn't have confirmation, but now that it's in the trailer,

01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:47.320
because the Konami whole thing,

01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:48.320
which we haven't even brought up in the show yet,

01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:51.320
but Konami had their whole little movie thing come up,

01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:52.320
and this was part of it.

01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:53.320
Yeah.

01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:56.320
So, that's that.

01:29:56.320 --> 01:30:00.320
So, that to me sounds like the whole situation where, you know,

01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:03.320
it's the How I Met Your Mother situation where you have,

01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:05.320
you know, Bob Saget as the narrator.

01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:06.320
He's supposed to be the father.

01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:09.320
But yeah, his voice isn't obviously going to change, you know,

01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:12.320
over the default Ted Mosley voice that, you know, the characters.

01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:14.320
So, it's just different.

01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:15.320
All right.

01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:17.320
And I wonder if we'll ever get a movie,

01:30:17.320 --> 01:30:21.320
if we'll have, you know, Kiefer Sutherland playing Snake.

01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:25.320
EA, hopefully giving some final clarity to some of the shady things

01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:27.320
they've said about the Wii U in the past,

01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:30.320
courtesy of EA president Frank Gebaux.

01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:31.320
Now, I'm going to admit,

01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:33.320
I think we brought up something similar to this last week,

01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:35.320
but this is coming from EA president of labels.

01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:36.320
This is somebody else.

01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:39.320
Quote, we have a good partnership with Nintendo.

01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:41.320
We released four games on the platform over the last year.

01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:44.320
We're pretty proud of Need for Speed and Madden and FIFA and Mass Effect.

01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:48.320
We have guys that are looking at the Wii U and the studio system right now

01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:49.320
as an opportunity to the future,

01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:53.320
but we have no publicly announced Wii U games that we're going to release this fall.

01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:57.320
That does leave the door open to say something at E3, but don't hold your breath.

01:30:57.320 --> 01:30:58.320
No, they have nothing coming.

01:30:58.320 --> 01:30:59.320
Don't hold your breath.

01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:00.320
There's nothing.

01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:02.320
We're really excited about the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4,

01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:04.320
and that's a pretty big endeavor in and of itself.

01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:05.320
I wonder why.

01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:08.320
We have four titles out on the Wii U that are active right now,

01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:11.320
so looking at how things unfold, that's where our focus is right now.

01:31:11.320 --> 01:31:13.320
Gen 3 is an awesome platform.

01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:16.320
It has a huge audience, it has a lot of capability,

01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:18.320
and we're going to continue to publish games on Gen 3

01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:20.320
for as long as there is an audience there.

01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:24.320
We have a tendency as a company to support the last gen platforms for many, many years.

01:31:24.320 --> 01:31:27.320
I can tell you we have products planned for next year, the year after that,

01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:29.320
and the year after that for Gen 3 for sure.

01:31:29.320 --> 01:31:33.320
Well, yeah, because they keep pumping out Madden sequels and stuff like that

01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:39.320
on PlayStation 2 and Xbox up to way past the console's life cycles and stuff,

01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:43.320
but it doesn't necessarily mean you're going to see big games on there.

01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:48.320
The honest, blunt way I could say this is that third-party games

01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:51.320
aren't really what a lot of people go to Nintendo for anyway.

01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:53.320
I mean, they'll help, of course.

01:31:53.320 --> 01:31:57.320
I mean, certainly the Sega partnership with Sonic, which is so weird.

01:31:57.320 --> 01:32:00.320
It's not weird.

01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:04.320
No, I mean, to the nine-year-old gamer in me when it was Nintendo versus Sega,

01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:06.320
that is still something I have to be used to.

01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:08.320
They've done this the last few years with Sonic Colors.

01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:11.320
They've had a bunch of exclusive Sonic games on the Wii,

01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:13.320
and they haven't been that great.

01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:15.320
It's not that weird, but anyway.

01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:18.320
But it'll have Mario Kart, it'll have Zelda,

01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:21.320
and there's going to be a lot of people here for that.

01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:23.320
So, Dark Soccer.

01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:27.320
I'm sorry, I was just getting out my DC hate out of my system.

01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:30.320
Can't we all just get along?

01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:32.320
No, Marvel all the way.

01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:36.320
Hey, listen, if it's any consolation, Deadpool comes out in a couple weeks anyway.

01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:38.320
I know! I'm so happy.

01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:40.320
So happy.

01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:42.320
So happy. Anyway.

01:32:42.320 --> 01:32:45.320
Well, how about some other really quick news, okay?

01:32:45.320 --> 01:32:47.320
Diablo 3.

01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:55.320
We've seen an announcement before that it's going to be on the PS3 and PS4.

01:32:55.320 --> 01:32:57.320
They are also bringing it out on Xbox 360,

01:32:57.320 --> 01:33:00.320
but have no plans to bring it out for any other system.

01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:03.320
Which is a polite fuck you to Xbone.

01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:06.320
As I'm still going to call it forever.

01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:11.320
Honestly, a lot of us have been playing it on PC already, so who cares?

01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:14.320
And then, this makes me really happy.

01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:20.320
Is that Hatsune Miku Project Diva F is going to be coming out in North America in August,

01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:23.320
and I'm gonna get it.

01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:27.320
There's a demo on June 11th.

01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:33.320
And I'm so excited because I love the Project Diva games.

01:33:33.320 --> 01:33:37.320
And then, last but not least, Metal Gear Rising Revengeance.

01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:41.320
If anyone likes stories about Raiden, well, you get to play more Raiden

01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:43.320
because it's going to be on PC.

01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:44.320
The end.

01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:48.320
They're also bringing, I think, the original Lords of Shadows to PC as well,

01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:51.320
so that would be interesting.

01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:54.320
Alright, let's go to the FUGL Question of the Week.

01:33:54.320 --> 01:34:01.320
Every week, we ask a question of our Facebook and Google communities.

01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:04.320
You put it together and it's FUGL.

01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:09.320
We had a fun idea for this week because, you know, E3 really kicks off tomorrow.

01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:13.320
The show floor doesn't open until Tuesday, but there's a shit ton of press conferences tomorrow.

01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:16.320
And so, everybody's going to be talking about this tomorrow.

01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:18.320
So, we thought we would go to Facebook and Google and ask,

01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:22.320
it's that time of year to ask everyone, what's your E3 predictions?

01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:26.320
However, we at OLR, we like to do things a little differently and maybe a little bit silly.

01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:30.320
So, we only want your E3 predictions in a haiku format.

01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:34.320
That would be five, seven, five, remember?

01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:38.320
Guess, OLR me, what will occur at E3?

01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:40.320
Games of win or fail?

01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:43.320
That was my haiku to the listeners.

01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:46.320
Loki, you look so impressed.

01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:49.320
All right, here we go. Some haikus.

01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:53.320
The Dark Sakura, I want you to count the syllables and tell me who failed.

01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:54.320
For the record, Rob?

01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:55.320
There are some fails in here.

01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:56.320
For the record, Rob?

01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:59.320
The plural of haiku is haiku.

01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:01.320
Haikuzis.

01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:04.320
The haikuza.

01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:06.320
Let's go to the haikuza.

01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:08.320
Haikuzersies.

01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:11.320
You know what? Bite me.

01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:14.320
Haikugaggle. All right.

01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:17.320
And all in good fun about those of you that failed, by the way.

01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:24.320
Edgar R. says, Call of Duty Ghost, Dogs of War, X-Bone exclusive.

01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:27.320
I think Dogs of War, that's wrong.

01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:30.320
That's not a haiku, you lose.

01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:31.320
You lose.

01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:35.320
It's also already confirmed as an exclusive to the Xbox One.

01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:37.320
All right. I appreciate the effort.

01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:39.320
Porkchop, since this entry.

01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:45.320
I don't really mind as long as they don't release more shit EA games.

01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:47.320
Bravo.

01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:49.320
Tiara.

01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:54.320
All I really care is about, excuse me, I fucked that up, sorry.

01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:57.320
All I really care about is Dragon Age 3.

01:35:57.320 --> 01:35:59.320
I love BioWare.

01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:02.320
No, she loves Anders.

01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:05.320
She loves her pounce a lot.

01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:07.320
So she gets a fail for lying.

01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:08.320
No.

01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:10.320
All right.

01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:13.320
Honestly, that's about...

01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:15.320
She named her cats her pounce a lot.

01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:17.320
All right. This is from Mason D.

01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:19.320
Want more Pokemon?

01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:21.320
Pokemon versus for Wii U.

01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:23.320
Pokemon get hype.

01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:27.320
With a big white smiley face underneath that, no less.

01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:30.320
Blood Drunk submits the following.

01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:32.320
That's a great name.

01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:34.320
Blood Drunk.

01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:36.320
I don't know if Blood Drunk is a newer listener,

01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:38.320
but I've noticed his name on the VoG leaderboard.

01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:40.320
So he is a big participant.

01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:43.320
So a win to you no matter how good or bad your haiku is.

01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:45.320
Here we go. From Blood Drunk.

01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:48.320
Connect watches you fap.

01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:50.320
I think that's six syllables.

01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:52.320
Connect watches you fap.

01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:54.320
Six syllables. That's all right. We still like his name.

01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:56.320
Connect watches you fap.

01:36:56.320 --> 01:36:58.320
LOL PS4 DRM.

01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:00.320
Nintendo shows games.

01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:02.320
All right.

01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:04.320
Not quite a haiku, but hey.

01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:06.320
Close enough.

01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:08.320
It's a haiku-ga.

01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:10.320
It's a haiku-ger.

01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:12.320
Degenerate Johnny submits the following.

01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:14.320
Predicting prices.

01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:16.320
Xbox. Five bills.

01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:18.320
Four with subs.

01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:20.320
Sony 450.

01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:22.320
Good way to put your predictions in.

01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:24.320
I think he might be high balling it a little bit,

01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:26.320
but we'll see.

01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:28.320
Haseo Sumeruagawa submits the following.

01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:30.320
Xbox One fucks up.

01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:32.320
Nintendo might steal the show.

01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:34.320
PS4 ooh pretty.

01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:38.320
That was six syllables.

01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:40.320
That's all right.

01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:42.320
Liam C submits the following.

01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:44.320
The Last Guardian.

01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:46.320
A brand new Uncharted game.

01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:48.320
Connect flops badly.

01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:50.320
Good.

01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:52.320
Code Man says,

01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:54.320
What will E3 bring?

01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:56.320
Nintendo surprise maybe?

01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:58.320
Will has sports.

01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:00.320
One just got sent to me, which I have to read.

01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:02.320
Okay. From who?

01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:04.320
From clerical error 404.

01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:06.320
Sony has less trust.

01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:08.320
Nintendo rules us all.

01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:10.320
But it all ends well.

01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:12.320
We'll see.

01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:14.320
We'll see. All right.

01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:16.320
E to the three.

01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:18.320
That's four syllables.

01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:20.320
You lose.

01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:22.320
No, why can't people count?

01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:24.320
E to the three.

01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:26.320
Oh, they didn't.

01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:28.320
Oh, they done screwed up.

01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:30.320
He could do E fucking 3-0.

01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:32.320
All right.

01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:34.320
Captain Spike.

01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:36.320
Here's Captain Spike's submission.

01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:38.320
Yay, Spike. We love Spike.

01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:40.320
He's full of win no matter if his haiku is fail or not.

01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:42.320
Here it is.

01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:44.320
Nintendo no show.

01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:46.320
Sony and MS hate us all.

01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:48.320
The worst E3 ever.

01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:50.320
Worst E3 ever.

01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:52.320
I love Spike.

01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:54.320
Here's Hitstun.

01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:56.320
Next gen consoles?

01:38:56.320 --> 01:38:58.320
Meh. Nothing PS3

01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:00.320
can't do.

01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:02.320
Game of Show? DuckTales.

01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:04.320
Ooh.

01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:06.320
That's a good one. That's my favorite one so far, I think.

01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:08.320
Did you watch the last trailer

01:39:08.320 --> 01:39:10.320
they put out?

01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:12.320
It's the side-by-side.

01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:14.320
Oh, no, I didn't see that one.

01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:16.320
They did one comparing the old DuckTales to the new one.

01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:18.320
Somebody on Tumblr posted it

01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:20.320
a while back. I'll see if I can't find it

01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:22.320
but it was pretty neat.

01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:24.320
Alright, here's SSJ100 Matt Sentry.

01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:26.320
Anticipation.

01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:28.320
Elated disappointment.

01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:30.320
Gamers are winners.

01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:32.320
Wouldn't that be losers

01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:34.320
if we're disappointed, though?

01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:36.320
And I got excited because when he said anticipation

01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:38.320
it made me think, oh, maybe that's the Rare franchise

01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:40.320
they're bringing back. Because y'all know

01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:42.320
I could give two fucks about Killer Instinct

01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:44.320
or Banjo-Kazooie

01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:46.320
when Rare could remake Anticipation.

01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:48.320
Just saying.

01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:50.320
You know you want to play as the ice cream cone again

01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:52.320
bouncing around the board.

01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:54.320
I want ice cream right now.

01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:56.320
This is from Steven M.

01:39:56.320 --> 01:39:58.320
What about another cameo?

01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:00.320
Hell no. Alright, Steven M says

01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:02.320
like, I had to think about what the fuck game

01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:04.320
is he talking about? Oh, god.

01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:06.320
Alright, Steven M.

01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:08.320
Must be online Xbox.

01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:10.320
Wii U will die.

01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:12.320
We finally get Last Guardian.

01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:14.320
I think you did 557.

01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:16.320
Andy R.

01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:18.320
Especially since you

01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:20.320
gave them how to do a haiku.

01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:22.320
I put right there, as a

01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:24.320
reminder, a haiku is 575.

01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:26.320
We can't read.

01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:28.320
What's the syllable?

01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:30.320
We love our listeners.

01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:32.320
We're just giving you shit.

01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:34.320
I give everybody shit.

01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:36.320
We just want to educate you all this week on haikuses.

01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:38.320
Yeah, study some damn literature.

01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:40.320
Fuck.

01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:42.320
Was that a haiku?

01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:44.320
No, not quite.

01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:46.320
Alright, Andy R.

01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:48.320
I'll make one though if you like.

01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:50.320
You think of one while I read the rest of these.

01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:52.320
Alright, Andy R says

01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:54.320
I don't really know.

01:40:54.320 --> 01:40:56.320
A giant enemy crab?

01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:58.320
Ridge Racer 2.

01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:00.320
Ridge Racer 2 is

01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:02.320
four syllables.

01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:04.320
Andy, you're killing me.

01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:06.320
That would have been great for 2006.

01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:08.320
Alright, lots of answers

01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:10.320
on Google Plus. We have five

01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:12.320
answers on Google Plus. I didn't even know there were

01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:14.320
that many people using it.

01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:16.320
Oh, come on, come on.

01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:18.320
ActDeaf says what I want this year

01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:20.320
is to see really good games

01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:22.320
and vog to hit big.

01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:24.320
Somebody kissing a little

01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:26.320
vog behind in that response.

01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:28.320
Love it. Thank you, ActDeaf.

01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:30.320
Flaco Jones says

01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:32.320
Xbox and Sony, their DRM

01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:34.320
kills gaming. What's a Nintendo?

01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:36.320
Okay, I got one.

01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:38.320
Let me make sure I have it right.

01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:40.320
We'll do yours last.

01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:42.320
Forget it.

01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:44.320
Go. Use the internet.

01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:46.320
There are haiku examples.

01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:50.320
There are haiku examples.

01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:52.320
Okay.

01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:54.320
Really use Google.

01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:56.320
Okay.

01:41:56.320 --> 01:41:58.320
Fuck. Alright, Technus

01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:00.320
says

01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:02.320
use some fucking Google.

01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:04.320
Alright.

01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:06.320
Technus says people still complain.

01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:08.320
Rare shows next gen battle

01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:10.320
toads. Why you still hating?

01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:12.320
You never

01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:14.320
know. Retertainment

01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:16.320
says, oh, it's a double haiku.

01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:18.320
Ooh. Retertainment's always

01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:20.320
got to fucking show everybody up. Alright.

01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:22.320
Here we go. That's okay. I love it. Alright. Retertainment

01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:24.320
says gamers hate everything.

01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:26.320
Everything will receive

01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:28.320
scorn. Twitter will explode.

01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:30.320
Good one. Gamers will

01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:32.320
not see a wanted not

01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:34.320
seen project. The Last Guardian.

01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:36.320
We got it.

01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:38.320
Since he did two, we got another one from

01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:40.320
clerical error. Alright. Let me read this last one

01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:42.320
from Google Plus. From Travis H.

01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:44.320
Sony is epic. Xbone

01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:46.320
will be eaten up. Long live

01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:48.320
PlayStation.

01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:50.320
We'll see how that press conference goes.

01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:52.320
I'm approaching it with cautious optimism

01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:54.320
Travis. Cautious optimism.

01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:56.320
Alright. Last but not least.

01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:58.320
Nintendo has props, but Sony has

01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:00.320
some issues. I guess we should wait.

01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:02.320
That one was good.

01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:04.320
YYR in chat.

01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:06.320
Can't you people

01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:08.320
count? You have offended Jamie.

01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:10.320
Study some damn books.

01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:12.320
You win the internet

01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:14.320
YYR. Xbox One console.

01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:16.320
TV, TV, TV, sports.

01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:18.320
What's wrong? Deal with it.

01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:20.320
That's good.

01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:22.320
Did you do that one by yourself? I just did that one. I love it.

01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:24.320
I love it.

01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:26.320
After I posted the question. Use that Mensa thing for something.

01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:28.320
There you go.

01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:30.320
Jamie came to me tonight.

01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:32.320
She said you should make every week be

01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:34.320
a haiku.

01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:36.320
Alright.

01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:38.320
Alright. And SSJ100

01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:40.320
Matt bringing some clarity.

01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:42.320
Anticipation because gamers are anticipating

01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:44.320
a lot for E3. Elated disappointment

01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:46.320
because people will be either happy or disappointed.

01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:48.320
Gamers are winners because no matter what

01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:50.320
gamers win because we have all these

01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:52.320
new games to play.

01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:54.320
Okay. Okay. Alright.

01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:56.320
Anyhow, I know we gave some of you a bad time, but

01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:58.320
that was a really fun topic. So thank you everybody for

01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:00.320
trying. I love you YYR.

01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:02.320
Alright.

01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:04.320
Do I need to give you two a moment?

01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:06.320
No. I don't love you in that way.

01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:08.320
Alright.

01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:10.320
Just a few more stories and then list list tonight.

01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:12.320
But first, Loki.

01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:14.320
Alright. Code Manner's reminding me that

01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:16.320
I need to play more Borderlands 2.

01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:18.320
Because I haven't touched it on PC yet.

01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:20.320
Even though I finished the game

01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:22.320
three times on 360.

01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:24.320
So yes, unfortunately

01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:26.320
there was some massive lay-offs

01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:28.320
at Zynga. Also

01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:30.320
including the closure

01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:32.320
of OMG Pop.

01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:34.320
And

01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:36.320
so they closed the office there.

01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:38.320
Also they closed

01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:40.320
the Zynga office

01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:42.320
in Los Angeles,

01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:44.320
Dallas, and New York.

01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:48.320
And I know there was lay-offs I think

01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:50.320
in all of their offices. I think about

01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:52.320
five hundred and

01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:54.320
like

01:44:54.320 --> 01:44:56.320
five twenty or five forty

01:44:56.320 --> 01:44:58.320
or something like that.

01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:00.320
People were laid off.

01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:02.320
Actually I was reaching out to one of my friends

01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:04.320
who is a concept artist

01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:06.320
over at Zynga

01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:08.320
in San Francisco. I think she's pretty high up

01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:10.320
though.

01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:12.320
I don't think she's affected by it.

01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:14.320
Yeah, that kind of sucks.

01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:16.320
And of course a lot of

01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:18.320
horror stories coming out about

01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:20.320
how things were run and stuff like that.

01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:22.320
And how they were talking about

01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:24.320
the terms they use

01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:26.320
for cloning things. Like

01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:28.320
taking games like Tiny Tower

01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:30.320
and turning them into Dream Heights or whatever.

01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:34.320
I don't know. It's kind of sick to me.

01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:38.320
So maybe this is the beginning

01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:40.320
of the end. This is surely

01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:42.320
not too good for them.

01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:46.320
Well, I mean I don't

01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:48.320
like to poke fun or tease

01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:50.320
or you know

01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:52.320
celebrate layoffs. Especially

01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:54.320
like Loki says. He has

01:45:54.320 --> 01:45:56.320
friends that are at Zynga and so forth.

01:45:56.320 --> 01:45:58.320
We always knew Zynga had a really

01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:00.320
questionable business model. And I think

01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:02.320
people bought into

01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:04.320
that way too fast. And Zynga

01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:06.320
expanded way too fast over

01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:08.320
Farmville. And I think it just goes to show

01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:10.320
Farmville was kind of a one hit wonder.

01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:12.320
I hate to say.

01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:14.320
Some would argue with me that there were other Facebook

01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:16.320
games and blah, blah, blah.

01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:18.320
Well, it's like this. When the news came out about them

01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:20.320
copying games. I mean that was just

01:46:20.320 --> 01:46:22.320
shitty. Aha had good albums

01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:24.320
and good music. But the only

01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:26.320
song anyone ever cared about

01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:28.320
was Take On Me. That is

01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:30.320
quite possibly the best possible comparison

01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:32.320
somebody could have made in this scenario. Because

01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:34.320
remember I had that thing of Dan

01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:36.320
singing the lyrics to the

01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:38.320
synth part with one hit wonder

01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:40.320
instead of the...

01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:42.320
By the way before I get to the next news story

01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:44.320
I just got a text message. And I'll let you

01:46:44.320 --> 01:46:46.320
guess where this is from Dark Soccer. Are you ready?

01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:48.320
Alright here's the text message

01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:50.320
I just got. Haiku game

01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:52.320
is weak. Sometimes we

01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:54.320
just can't even. DarkSakura

01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:56.320
mad. Girl.

01:46:56.320 --> 01:46:58.320
It's from Allen. I know.

01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:00.320
I thought that was

01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:02.320
good. Alright. Let's see

01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:04.320
going into some

01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:06.320
news about the Ouya.

01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:08.320
And some more games coming to the Ouya.

01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:10.320
Specifically Sonic the Hedgehog 4 and

01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:12.320
Sonic CD. I'm not surprised.

01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:14.320
They're going to be coming to the Ouya.

01:47:14.320 --> 01:47:16.320
You can side load those right now and

01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:18.320
they work just fine.

01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:20.320
So why not try to make some money off of it right?

01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:22.320
Exactly. I got a Moga

01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:24.320
version. I got my controller free of Sonic CD

01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:26.320
that plays just fine. Well I mean still

01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:28.320
though it's Sega support for the Ouya so that's

01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:30.320
kind of cool. How about some Phantasy Star online?

01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:32.320
Alright. Maybe that's wishful thinking.

01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:34.320
They're coming out on June 27th in the

01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:36.320
Ouya store. $7 each. This is Sonic

01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:38.320
the Hedgehog 4 episode 1

01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:40.320
episode 2 and Sonic CD.

01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:42.320
No idea if the Ouya version will

01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:44.320
include fun for Sonic the Hedgehog 4.

01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:46.320
Because unfortunately that was missing in the

01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:48.320
earlier versions. Anybody?

01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:50.320
Alright.

01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:52.320
The Ouya ports they say are optimized

01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:54.320
for the console's Tegra 3

01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:56.320
processor and free trial

01:47:56.320 --> 01:47:58.320
versions will be available.

01:47:58.320 --> 01:48:00.320
Sega of America director of mobile business

01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:02.320
David Zemke, interesting where this is coming

01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:04.320
from, was praising Ouya's

01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:06.320
quote disruptive technology and

01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:08.320
quote they want to see what these technologies

01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:10.320
can do and be a part of it from the beginning.

01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:12.320
We're always looking for

01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:14.320
other titles and there may be some future titles

01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:16.320
that we'd like to bring over. For us

01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:18.320
we're always trying to bring the best

01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:20.320
gaming experience to the right platforms.

01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:22.320
It's a delicate mix of how

01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:24.320
and when to do it.

01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:26.320
Hmm. That's right after the launch

01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:28.320
of the Ouya by the way which is June 25th.

01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:30.320
The day before my birthday y'all.

01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:32.320
Just saying. Alright.

01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:34.320
Anyhow.

01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:36.320
Dark

01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:38.320
Sakura, one more story and then we'll get into list list tonight.

01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:40.320
Sorry we were just having a discussion about

01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:42.320
Turian Smut.

01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:44.320
Of course. No not really.

01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:46.320
Something from

01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:48.320
Double Fine, the game Massive

01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:50.320
Chalice that

01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:52.320
basically as they were

01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:54.320
saying that there was going to be

01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:56.320
a gay relationship in the game that

01:48:56.320 --> 01:48:58.320
had been taken out and

01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:00.320
now the project leader feels shitty because

01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:02.320
people on Kickstarter say no we want it.

01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:04.320
So he's putting it in.

01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:06.320
I guess it had been the intention

01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:08.320
but it just sort of was taken out.

01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:10.320
And so now they are putting everything

01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:12.320
back in and making sure that

01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:14.320
the people paying for it get what they want.

01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:16.320
So it's already passed

01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:18.320
it's $725,000

01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:20.320
goal. It's at

01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:22.320
$857,569

01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:24.320
and it has 20 days to go until

01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:26.320
the deadline.

01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:28.320
Nope. Less than that now.

01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:30.320
18 days? Yeah.

01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:32.320
Hmm. As of today.

01:49:32.320 --> 01:49:34.320
Interesting.

01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:36.320
All that from feedback.

01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:38.320
That's what you want. We're putting it back in.

01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:40.320
That's kind of cool though because that makes it seem like

01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:42.320
Kickstarter really is a place for

01:49:42.320 --> 01:49:44.320
not to say

01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:46.320
they're investors or whatever because

01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:48.320
Kickstarter is the backing or whatever but that they get a

01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:50.320
say that these people really had a say.

01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:52.320
Well yeah. I mean if you look

01:49:52.320 --> 01:49:54.320
at it this way it is probably the

01:49:54.320 --> 01:49:56.320
best type of board meeting you can ever

01:49:56.320 --> 01:49:58.320
expect because you've got

01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:00.320
real time feedback going in.

01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:02.320
Alright. So I think it's good.

01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:04.320
Something that you would consider backing or a game

01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:06.320
that you might think you're going to buy or?

01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:08.320
I told you what I'm waiting for for my first

01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:10.320
my first backing.

01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:12.320
No. What? Well unless he's

01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:14.320
already put it up I'm waiting for

01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:16.320
the

01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:18.320
understanding video games.

01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:20.320
I don't remember. Can you refresh

01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:22.320
my memory about this? The seg stewing?

01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:24.320
Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:26.320
There was

01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:28.320
another name it was though.

01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:30.320
But yeah he hasn't put it up yet.

01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:32.320
I'm going to give my

01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:34.320
Kickstarter cherry to seg.

01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:36.320
Love, love, love, love.

01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:38.320
That's a fair place to

01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:40.320
give your Kickstarter cherry.

01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:42.320
Alright.

01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:44.320
I'm trying to get this

01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:46.320
well we're going to do Listless now

01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:48.320
except I'm having a little problem with the

01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:50.320
connection.

01:50:50.320 --> 01:50:52.320
Let's see if we can get it there.

01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:54.320
We're going to call an old friend of ours here at Orange

01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:56.320
Lounge Radio to help us out with Listless tonight

01:50:56.320 --> 01:50:58.320
and hopefully the internet will hold up.

01:50:58.320 --> 01:51:00.320
But I think we're connected now. Are you there

01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:02.320
old friend? Hello. Hey

01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:04.320
Bobby Blackwolf how you doing?

01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:06.320
I'm doing good. Rob called you old.

01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:08.320
Shouldn't he be like old chum?

01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:10.320
Yes. Oh I'm not Adam

01:51:10.320 --> 01:51:12.320
West in Batman okay. How you

01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:14.320
doing Bobby? I'm doing good. I've been

01:51:14.320 --> 01:51:16.320
playing Animal Crossing since I got off the

01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:18.320
air. Finally have time to get into that huh? What do you think

01:51:18.320 --> 01:51:20.320
so far? It's Animal Crossing.

01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:22.320
I'm very sad

01:51:22.320 --> 01:51:24.320
because everybody else has this and I don't even

01:51:24.320 --> 01:51:26.320
have a 3DS so whatever.

01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:28.320
No because

01:51:28.320 --> 01:51:30.320
I don't have a job so we're not buying

01:51:30.320 --> 01:51:32.320
one. You have to have a J-O-B

01:51:32.320 --> 01:51:34.320
to have a 3DS.

01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:36.320
You're going to need to get on MTurk.

01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:38.320
I've even already been in someone else's town

01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:40.320
so my fruit collection is growing.

01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:42.320
Wow. Nice I need to go open my

01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:44.320
gates. But anyhow I wanted

01:51:44.320 --> 01:51:46.320
to make sure you had a chance. You know

01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:48.320
our Listless topic tonight is about E3

01:51:48.320 --> 01:51:50.320
and we're going to get into that in a minute. But I

01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:52.320
wanted a chance for the listeners to hear

01:51:52.320 --> 01:51:54.320
from you because you've worked

01:51:54.320 --> 01:51:56.320
you know in case our listeners

01:51:56.320 --> 01:51:58.320
don't know you've worked very hard on the

01:51:58.320 --> 01:52:00.320
voice of geeks network. The whole thing is really

01:52:00.320 --> 01:52:02.320
done from the ground up. I mean

01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:04.320
yeah the template was

01:52:04.320 --> 01:52:06.320
something we bought but even

01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:08.320
Dark Sakura heavily modified that template graphically.

01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:10.320
You have done a lot of programming

01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:12.320
for the whole VoG game and everything

01:52:12.320 --> 01:52:14.320
that you announced with E3.Vognetwork.com

01:52:14.320 --> 01:52:16.320
right? Right

01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:18.320
and I mean yeah the website I mean

01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:20.320
PHPBB is the forum software and that

01:52:20.320 --> 01:52:22.320
handles like the user registration

01:52:22.320 --> 01:52:24.320
and that's it. Everything else

01:52:24.320 --> 01:52:26.320
started with a blank

01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:28.320
file. For any

01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:30.320
Unix geeks out there I wrote it all in VI

01:52:30.320 --> 01:52:32.320
so and

01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:34.320
you know if you don't know what VI is that's

01:52:34.320 --> 01:52:36.320
fine but if you do know what VI is

01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:38.320
you kind of know what that means

01:52:38.320 --> 01:52:40.320
that's like a more hardcore notepad.

01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:42.320
Yeah I could never use VI

01:52:42.320 --> 01:52:44.320
I was always about was it Pico or Pine?

01:52:44.320 --> 01:52:46.320
One was the email. I used Pico.

01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:48.320
Pine was the mail.

01:52:48.320 --> 01:52:50.320
Yeah one was email and one was

01:52:50.320 --> 01:52:52.320
shows you my knowledge of Unix I

01:52:52.320 --> 01:52:54.320
haven't used it in a while but

01:52:54.320 --> 01:52:56.320
you coded away in VI this new

01:52:56.320 --> 01:52:58.320
E3.Vognetwork.com what

01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:00.320
are you hoping comes of this?

01:53:00.320 --> 01:53:02.320
I don't know

01:53:02.320 --> 01:53:04.320
this is me saying

01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:06.320
this is an idea I have

01:53:06.320 --> 01:53:08.320
I wonder if it'll work and in the past

01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:10.320
I've had these ideas and they didn't work and

01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:12.320
then two years later everybody's doing them

01:53:12.320 --> 01:53:14.320
so we'll see if this is another one of

01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:16.320
those. We'll see so be sure to check

01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:18.320
it out guys if you haven't seen it yet

01:53:18.320 --> 01:53:20.320
vognetwork.com especially those

01:53:20.320 --> 01:53:22.320
of you listening on the podcast

01:53:22.320 --> 01:53:24.320
everything will open up on Monday night for

01:53:24.320 --> 01:53:26.320
the question and answer but tonight live

01:53:26.320 --> 01:53:28.320
you can at least watch the video

01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:30.320
and learn everything you're going to need to know

01:53:30.320 --> 01:53:32.320
for when everything goes live

01:53:32.320 --> 01:53:34.320
with the question asking.

01:53:34.320 --> 01:53:36.320
I've already been given the blacklist

01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:38.320
against asking anything about Hello Kitty

01:53:38.320 --> 01:53:40.320
games so I'm not going to do that.

01:53:40.320 --> 01:53:42.320
Fair enough.

01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:44.320
Alright so

01:53:44.320 --> 01:53:46.320
you're leaving for E3 tomorrow right?

01:53:46.320 --> 01:53:48.320
Correct tomorrow morning.

01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:50.320
What's your very first appointment?

01:53:50.320 --> 01:53:52.320
Um

01:53:52.320 --> 01:53:54.320
Bethesda I think

01:53:54.320 --> 01:53:56.320
Yeah I think it's Bethesda

01:53:56.320 --> 01:53:58.320
it's at 2 o'clock that way I can get there

01:53:58.320 --> 01:54:00.320
and see things from noon to 2

01:54:00.320 --> 01:54:02.320
and kind of get my way to land but I think

01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:04.320
Bethesda at 2.

01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:06.320
I know we're about to get into the list list here about

01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:08.320
thing I most want to happen at E3 2013

01:54:08.320 --> 01:54:10.320
but seriously off the record

01:54:10.320 --> 01:54:12.320
what are you personally looking forward

01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:14.320
to getting your hands on yourself and checking out?

01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:16.320
Um

01:54:16.320 --> 01:54:18.320
this is my standard answer

01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:20.320
and everybody calls it a cop out but I don't care.

01:54:20.320 --> 01:54:22.320
Oh no I know what you're going to say and I think it's a great answer.

01:54:22.320 --> 01:54:24.320
It's the game I

01:54:24.320 --> 01:54:26.320
haven't heard of yet

01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:28.320
and it's always been that like it was

01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:30.320
you know Scribblenauts

01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:32.320
is usually you know the

01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:34.320
thing I go back to. Nobody

01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:36.320
had heard of Scribblenauts I never heard of it

01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:38.320
and it was in the back corner of

01:54:38.320 --> 01:54:40.320
one of the halls because Warner Brothers

01:54:40.320 --> 01:54:42.320
had like their booth kind of near a wall

01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:44.320
and they had this on the side

01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:46.320
facing that back wall

01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:48.320
and I went and saw it

01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:50.320
at the very end it was the last thing I

01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:52.320
saw on Thursday because somebody else said

01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:54.320
there's a game called Scribblenauts you should go check it out

01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:56.320
and it's hidden in the back corner and that was my game of show

01:54:56.320 --> 01:54:58.320
which pissed off

01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:00.320
people because you know I should be giving it to a

01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:02.320
graphically good game and not a DS title

01:55:02.320 --> 01:55:04.320
at the time and so it's

01:55:04.320 --> 01:55:06.320
finding those gems

01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:08.320
you know like that's how

01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:10.320
I found Katamari Damacy

01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:12.320
which is the same kind of thing

01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:14.320
so it's the game I haven't heard of yet

01:55:14.320 --> 01:55:16.320
I think that is a fantastic answer

01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:18.320
and I look forward to hearing what that game is

01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:20.320
when I come see you in person on Thursday

01:55:20.320 --> 01:55:22.320
at least they'll let me see the Ouya booth

01:55:22.320 --> 01:55:24.320
alright yeah you're going to get to do

01:55:24.320 --> 01:55:26.320
the Ouya booth because I don't you know

01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:28.320
I'm probably not going to get to go in there

01:55:28.320 --> 01:55:30.320
because I don't want to leave the show floors

01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:32.320
that's fine unless they like keep it open

01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:34.320
later and then I'll pop in

01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:36.320
that's all you dude I'll do the b-roll

01:55:36.320 --> 01:55:38.320
alright anyway

01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:40.320
all seriousness though we are going to play

01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:42.320
Listless here but there's one other reason

01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:44.320
I have you here tonight and there's been

01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:46.320
a theme here at VOG Network the past couple weeks

01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:48.320
and that is that the game is always changing

01:55:48.320 --> 01:55:50.320
and the game is changing again

01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:52.320
tonight isn't it Bobby

01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:54.320
that's right what is new what did you do

01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:56.320
for us this week

01:55:56.320 --> 01:55:58.320
I hope you're logged into the site

01:55:58.320 --> 01:56:00.320
everybody because you no longer

01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:02.320
have to learn how to private message

01:56:02.320 --> 01:56:04.320
Rob to play Listless

01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:06.320
if you've ever done any of the live

01:56:06.320 --> 01:56:08.320
polls here on VOG

01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:10.320
then you kind of

01:56:10.320 --> 01:56:12.320
know where to look

01:56:12.320 --> 01:56:14.320
that's where you're going to want to look

01:56:14.320 --> 01:56:16.320
so with that it's time to start

01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:18.320
some Listless

01:56:20.320 --> 01:56:22.320
as a reminder for everybody

01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:24.320
the way Listless works is that

01:56:24.320 --> 01:56:26.320
we are going to give

01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:28.320
three answers each host

01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:30.320
and our special guest Bobby Blackwolf three answers

01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:32.320
that we believe best meet the

01:56:32.320 --> 01:56:34.320
criteria of the list and tonight's

01:56:34.320 --> 01:56:36.320
topic thing I most want to happen

01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:38.320
at E3 2013

01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:40.320
and once everything is up on the list

01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:42.320
then we will go around and this is what has

01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:44.320
to happen we have to strike the items that are

01:56:44.320 --> 01:56:46.320
not worthy of the list it's a very

01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:48.320
difficult painful process

01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:50.320
but it must be done remember there is

01:56:50.320 --> 01:56:52.320
a new rule that is still in play however

01:56:52.320 --> 01:56:54.320
and that is that when a host has two

01:56:54.320 --> 01:56:56.320
items eliminated from the list the third

01:56:56.320 --> 01:56:58.320
gets immunity so a person's list

01:56:58.320 --> 01:57:00.320
cannot be completely decimated

01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:02.320
alright here it is the topic thing

01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:04.320
I most want to happen at

01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:06.320
E3 2013

01:57:06.320 --> 01:57:08.320
let's put it up on the board

01:57:08.320 --> 01:57:10.320
at live.vognetwork.com

01:57:10.320 --> 01:57:12.320
for those of you that are logged in right

01:57:12.320 --> 01:57:14.320
now you will start to see the board

01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:16.320
and our answers as we

01:57:16.320 --> 01:57:18.320
fill it in hopefully right

01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:20.320
Bobby that's also part of the reason you're on the line

01:57:20.320 --> 01:57:22.320
yes alright I made

01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:24.320
it live what's that

01:57:24.320 --> 01:57:26.320
I'm keeping a watch on it oh there it is

01:57:26.320 --> 01:57:28.320
it just popped up I see it on my screen

01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:30.320
alright here it is the thing I most want to happen

01:57:30.320 --> 01:57:32.320
at E3 2013

01:57:32.320 --> 01:57:34.320
so Bobby you're our guest

01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:36.320
why don't you start us off tonight what is the number three thing

01:57:36.320 --> 01:57:38.320
you most want to see happen

01:57:38.320 --> 01:57:40.320
at E3 2013

01:57:40.320 --> 01:57:42.320
so I'm going to go kind of with an easy

01:57:42.320 --> 01:57:44.320
answer at first because I'm still having trouble

01:57:44.320 --> 01:57:46.320
figuring out number one and number two so chat help me out

01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:48.320
oh yeah if you

01:57:48.320 --> 01:57:50.320
have an answer you want to submit for inclusion on the list

01:57:50.320 --> 01:57:52.320
shout them out live.vognetwork.com

01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:54.320
but I'm

01:57:54.320 --> 01:57:56.320
going to say the easy answer

01:57:56.320 --> 01:57:58.320
a new F-Zero

01:57:58.320 --> 01:58:00.320
you know

01:58:00.320 --> 01:58:02.320
I think that's a very

01:58:02.320 --> 01:58:04.320
good safe answer

01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:06.320
and I think that is one that can't possibly

01:58:06.320 --> 01:58:08.320
get eliminated no matter what happens

01:58:08.320 --> 01:58:10.320
of course that's always famous last words

01:58:10.320 --> 01:58:12.320
yeah thanks for doing that answer

01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:14.320
alright let's put it up on the board

01:58:14.320 --> 01:58:16.320
Bobby locks in a new F-Zero

01:58:16.320 --> 01:58:18.320
alright Dark Sakura

01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:20.320
what is the number three thing that you want to see happen

01:58:20.320 --> 01:58:22.320
at E3 2013

01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:24.320
like it's probably it won't happen

01:58:24.320 --> 01:58:26.320
but I would love to have Sega announce

01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:28.320
that they're back in the console business

01:58:28.320 --> 01:58:30.320
it won't happen

01:58:30.320 --> 01:58:32.320
but it's what I want

01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:34.320
right Sega

01:58:34.320 --> 01:58:36.320
is back in the console business

01:58:36.320 --> 01:58:38.320
let's put it up on the board Dreamcast 2

01:58:40.320 --> 01:58:42.320
they should call it the

01:58:42.320 --> 01:58:44.320
Sega Utopia

01:58:44.320 --> 01:58:46.320
the Sega Utopia okay

01:58:46.320 --> 01:58:48.320
my turn for a number three answer

01:58:48.320 --> 01:58:50.320
I'm going to say

01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:52.320
I'm going to have

01:58:52.320 --> 01:58:54.320
to figure out how to fit this in the board but

01:58:54.320 --> 01:58:56.320
my number three answer is

01:58:56.320 --> 01:58:58.320
the Microsoft server crashes

01:58:58.320 --> 01:59:00.320
at the show causing all the

01:59:00.320 --> 01:59:02.320
Xbox ones to stop playing games

01:59:02.320 --> 01:59:04.320
after Wednesday

01:59:04.320 --> 01:59:06.320
because you know every 24 hours

01:59:06.320 --> 01:59:08.320
it's got to check in right

01:59:08.320 --> 01:59:10.320
so the Microsoft

01:59:10.320 --> 01:59:12.320
server crashes for 24 hours

01:59:12.320 --> 01:59:14.320
I guess that's how I'll shorten it

01:59:20.320 --> 01:59:22.320
alright putting that up on the board right now

01:59:22.320 --> 01:59:24.320
boy Bobby would be very sad

01:59:24.320 --> 01:59:26.320
Bobby wouldn't you be sad if like

01:59:26.320 --> 01:59:28.320
you didn't get to play an Xbox one and then

01:59:28.320 --> 01:59:30.320
all of a sudden the servers crash for 24 hours

01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:36.320
but then I'd laugh

01:59:36.320 --> 01:59:38.320
alright Loki

01:59:38.320 --> 01:59:40.320
your number three answer

01:59:40.320 --> 01:59:42.320
just because I want to get this out of the way

01:59:42.320 --> 01:59:44.320
Microsoft

01:59:44.320 --> 01:59:46.320
and Sony go back on their plans

01:59:46.320 --> 01:59:48.320
for DRM it's days

01:59:48.320 --> 01:59:50.320
the way it is now

01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:52.320
I love how you threw in

01:59:52.320 --> 01:59:54.320
and Sony when we don't really know you

01:59:54.320 --> 01:59:56.320
oh we know

01:59:56.320 --> 01:59:58.320
let's be honest

01:59:58.320 --> 02:00:00.320
no one's keying themselves

02:00:00.320 --> 02:00:02.320
alright fair enough let's put that up on the board

02:00:02.320 --> 02:00:04.320
Loki says MS and Sony go back

02:00:04.320 --> 02:00:06.320
on their DRM plans

02:00:06.320 --> 02:00:08.320
alright Bobby we're to you for your number two

02:00:08.320 --> 02:00:10.320
answer tonight for listless

02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:12.320
thing you most want to see happen at E3 2013

02:00:12.320 --> 02:00:14.320
I want to see E3

02:00:14.320 --> 02:00:16.320
announce that Kensha Hall

02:00:16.320 --> 02:00:18.320
will be returning next year

02:00:18.320 --> 02:00:20.320
dammit you stole mine

02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:22.320
oh really

02:00:22.320 --> 02:00:24.320
you had that on your list uh oh

02:00:24.320 --> 02:00:26.320
these things happen you better check the chat room

02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:28.320
Bobby just threw that up on the board E3 announces the return

02:00:28.320 --> 02:00:30.320
of Kensha Hall

02:00:30.320 --> 02:00:32.320
and maybe a new ex tango

02:00:32.320 --> 02:00:34.320
that goes with that I don't know

02:00:34.320 --> 02:00:36.320
we'll see alright Dark Sakura

02:00:36.320 --> 02:00:38.320
what's your number two answer

02:00:38.320 --> 02:00:40.320
Sony uses Final Fantasy

02:00:40.320 --> 02:00:42.320
7 to display an engine without

02:00:42.320 --> 02:00:44.320
a release of Final Fantasy 7 remake

02:00:44.320 --> 02:00:46.320
so

02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:48.320
so basically they're gonna repeat what they did with

02:00:48.320 --> 02:00:50.320
uh uh PlayStation 3

02:00:50.320 --> 02:00:52.320
and show a Final Fantasy tech demo that never happens

02:00:52.320 --> 02:00:54.320
Final Fantasy tech demo that never results in a game

02:00:54.320 --> 02:00:56.320
that'd be awesome

02:00:56.320 --> 02:00:58.320
if it was a new Final Fantasy engine

02:00:58.320 --> 02:01:00.320
hey

02:01:00.320 --> 02:01:02.320
yeah it looks like Advent Children

02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:04.320
nope never gonna get it alright I'm gonna put this

02:01:04.320 --> 02:01:06.320
up on the board Final Fantasy 7 PS4

02:01:06.320 --> 02:01:08.320
tech demo that never is a real game

02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:10.320
yes I think that should fit within the

02:01:10.320 --> 02:01:12.320
confines of our shiny new board

02:01:12.320 --> 02:01:14.320

the site as well live.vognetwork.com

02:01:20.320 --> 02:01:22.320
I mean granted if Final Fantasy 7

02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:24.320
was remade yeah I'd play it

02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:26.320
but let's be realistic

02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:28.320
alright uh

02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:30.320
my turn my number two answer

02:01:30.320 --> 02:01:32.320
Nintendo announces their

02:01:32.320 --> 02:01:34.320
plan to win the new

02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:36.320
generation of gaming by adding

02:01:36.320 --> 02:01:38.320
porn to Miiverse

02:01:38.320 --> 02:01:40.320

that'll never fucking happen Loki

02:02:04.320 --> 02:02:06.320
why though

02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:08.320

02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:10.320
and I'm sorry I understand that there are

02:02:10.320 --> 02:02:12.320
the Paper Mario games and granted Super Paper Mario

02:02:12.320 --> 02:02:14.320
was actually a pretty fun game it was actually one of the

02:02:14.320 --> 02:02:16.320
games I liked the most on the Wii

02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:18.320
but I would just like it as a sequel

02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:20.320
you know Square Enix come on that would

02:02:20.320 --> 02:02:22.320

Bobby Blackwolf our guest

02:02:32.320 --> 02:02:34.320
so picture this

02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:38.320
somehow

02:02:38.320 --> 02:02:40.320
does some kind of event

02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:42.320
goes on their own

02:02:44.320 --> 02:02:46.320

02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:56.320
off stage

02:02:56.320 --> 02:02:58.320
that would win

02:02:58.320 --> 02:03:00.320
E3

02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:06.320

02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:08.320
announcement followed by mic drop

follow mic drop excuse me

02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:18.320

02:03:18.320 --> 02:03:20.320
it will alright Half Life I didn't hit save

02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:22.320
so Half Life 3 released followed by

02:03:22.320 --> 02:03:24.320
mic drop I think that's a great answer is Alan

02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:26.320
still listening he'll love that answer alright

02:03:26.320 --> 02:03:28.320
Bobby locks that in on the board

02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:30.320
I think that's a great answer Dark Sakura

02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:32.320
what's your number one answer

02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:34.320

02:03:44.320 --> 02:03:46.320
new Mass Effect announced

02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:48.320
but with good writing

02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:50.320
there it is it's up on the board and I totally know

02:03:50.320 --> 02:03:52.320
what chance are Bobby's going to strike

02:03:52.320 --> 02:03:54.320
you know what if Bobby touches it

02:03:54.320 --> 02:03:56.320
I will get nevermind

02:03:56.320 --> 02:03:58.320
I won't even say it

02:03:58.320 --> 02:04:00.320
you leave my Mass Effect alone

02:04:00.320 --> 02:04:02.320
my it's a scientific

02:04:02.320 --> 02:04:04.320
process Dark Sakura alright my number

02:04:04.320 --> 02:04:06.320
one answer at least take faith in

02:04:06.320 --> 02:04:08.320
this Dark Sakura I think you will be okay with this

02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:10.320
as a backup I know you will because

02:04:10.320 --> 02:04:12.320
my answer is Bobby doesn't get rid of it too

02:04:12.320 --> 02:04:14.320
he might my answer is

02:04:14.320 --> 02:04:16.320
the Guardian Legend 2

02:04:16.320 --> 02:04:18.320
on Wii U

02:04:20.320 --> 02:04:22.320
technically there was a Guardian Legend 2

02:04:22.320 --> 02:04:24.320
it's the one that we got in the US

02:04:24.320 --> 02:04:26.320
shut up that was Guardic 2 you shut up

02:04:26.320 --> 02:04:28.320
okay fine

02:04:28.320 --> 02:04:30.320
preferably WayForward would somehow

02:04:30.320 --> 02:04:32.320
be involved because they're really good at retro

02:04:32.320 --> 02:04:34.320
said Garris gets his own game

02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:36.320
that'd be like that would be like

02:04:36.320 --> 02:04:38.320
a Silent Scope Turian

02:04:38.320 --> 02:04:40.320
edition

02:04:40.320 --> 02:04:42.320
alright last but not least

02:04:42.320 --> 02:04:44.320
Loki one spot left on the board

02:04:44.320 --> 02:04:46.320
what are you going to put in the list tonight

02:04:48.320 --> 02:04:50.320
Grand Theft Auto or Saints Row

02:04:50.320 --> 02:04:52.320
Online

02:04:52.320 --> 02:04:54.320
an MMO for a

02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:56.320
sandbox game yeah I know

02:04:56.320 --> 02:04:58.320
I guess we already have

02:04:58.320 --> 02:05:00.320
what was that

02:05:00.320 --> 02:05:02.320
I think that one game they have a free to play

02:05:02.320 --> 02:05:04.320
MMO right now they're sort of like Sains Row

02:05:04.320 --> 02:05:06.320
ATB or whatever yeah ATB but it's not

02:05:06.320 --> 02:05:08.320
that good it's not that same

02:05:08.320 --> 02:05:10.320
a GTA or Sains Row

02:05:10.320 --> 02:05:12.320
MMO there it is let's

02:05:12.320 --> 02:05:14.320
recap before we get to the very difficult

02:05:14.320 --> 02:05:16.320
part a new F-Zero

02:05:16.320 --> 02:05:18.320
Sega is back in the console

02:05:18.320 --> 02:05:20.320
business Microsoft server crashes

02:05:20.320 --> 02:05:22.320
for 24 hours Microsoft and Sony

02:05:22.320 --> 02:05:24.320
go back on their DRM plans

02:05:24.320 --> 02:05:26.320
E3 announces the return of Kensha Hall

02:05:26.320 --> 02:05:28.320
Final Fantasy 7 Playstation 4

02:05:28.320 --> 02:05:30.320
tech demo that it never is a real game

02:05:30.320 --> 02:05:32.320
Porn to Miiverse, Super Mario

02:05:32.320 --> 02:05:34.320
RPG 2, Half Life 3

02:05:34.320 --> 02:05:36.320
released followed by a mic drop

02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:38.320
new Mass Effect announced but with good writing

02:05:38.320 --> 02:05:40.320
The Guardian Legend 2 on

02:05:40.320 --> 02:05:42.320
Wii U and Grand Theft Auto

02:05:42.320 --> 02:05:44.320
or Saints Row MMO

02:05:44.320 --> 02:05:46.320
that's a lot of answers

02:05:46.320 --> 02:05:48.320
tonight so unfortunately it's

02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:50.320
getting crowded up here so unfortunately it's

02:05:50.320 --> 02:05:52.320
time to ask which of these is not

02:05:52.320 --> 02:05:54.320
worthy of the list

02:05:54.320 --> 02:05:56.320
Bobby Black Wolf I know you don't want to do it

02:05:56.320 --> 02:05:58.320
but you're going to have to make one of us mad by eliminating

02:05:58.320 --> 02:06:00.320
something off the list what's it going to be

02:06:00.320 --> 02:06:02.320
Porn to Miiverse

02:06:02.320 --> 02:06:04.320
Bobby you're

02:06:04.320 --> 02:06:06.320
killing me why are you getting rid of porn

02:06:06.320 --> 02:06:08.320
though

02:06:08.320 --> 02:06:10.320
because

02:06:10.320 --> 02:06:12.320
because the Wii U is

02:06:12.320 --> 02:06:14.320
a wholesome system

02:06:14.320 --> 02:06:16.320
think of the children

02:06:16.320 --> 02:06:18.320
it has been stricken from the list

02:06:18.320 --> 02:06:20.320
Porn to Miiverse is gone

02:06:20.320 --> 02:06:22.320
alright who's

02:06:22.320 --> 02:06:24.320
next Dark Sakura

02:06:24.320 --> 02:06:26.320
there's the various answers which

02:06:26.320 --> 02:06:28.320
one of these is not worthy of

02:06:28.320 --> 02:06:30.320
the list

02:06:30.320 --> 02:06:32.320
tough one

02:06:32.320 --> 02:06:34.320
there's a lot of good answers up here

02:06:34.320 --> 02:06:36.320
yeah there are

02:06:36.320 --> 02:06:38.320
I'm

02:06:38.320 --> 02:06:40.320
probably going to have to axe

02:06:40.320 --> 02:06:42.320
the

02:06:42.320 --> 02:06:44.320
Microsoft and Sony going back because

02:06:44.320 --> 02:06:46.320
I don't think Microsoft is

02:06:46.320 --> 02:06:48.320
going to

02:06:48.320 --> 02:06:50.320
eliminating it because you're just like it's not happening

02:06:50.320 --> 02:06:52.320
and we still don't know

02:06:52.320 --> 02:06:54.320
what Sony's going to say you might want it

02:06:54.320 --> 02:06:56.320
it's all speculation but you just alright

02:06:56.320 --> 02:06:58.320
it has been stricken from the list

02:06:58.320 --> 02:07:00.320
as sad as that is going to make some of you but I

02:07:00.320 --> 02:07:02.320
understand alright my turn to strike

02:07:02.320 --> 02:07:04.320
something from the list oh gosh

02:07:04.320 --> 02:07:06.320
these are all actually really good

02:07:08.320 --> 02:07:10.320
I don't know

02:07:12.320 --> 02:07:14.320
I hate to do this

02:07:14.320 --> 02:07:16.320
Loki but I'm removing Super Mario

02:07:16.320 --> 02:07:18.320
RPG 2 before you get mad

02:07:18.320 --> 02:07:20.320
at me people it's

02:07:20.320 --> 02:07:22.320
the same reason Dark Sakura got rid of hers

02:07:22.320 --> 02:07:24.320
it's not fucking happening so

02:07:24.320 --> 02:07:26.320
let's not even get our hopes up

02:07:26.320 --> 02:07:28.320
so Super Mario

02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:30.320
RPG 2 I'm sorry but it has been removed

02:07:30.320 --> 02:07:32.320
from the list but the good news is

02:07:32.320 --> 02:07:34.320
GTA or Saints Row MMO gets immunity

02:07:34.320 --> 02:07:36.320
going into the final removal which is yours

02:07:36.320 --> 02:07:38.320
Loki well that's fantastic news

02:07:38.320 --> 02:07:40.320
and since it's not really going to happen either

02:07:40.320 --> 02:07:42.320
new Mass Effect announcement

02:07:42.320 --> 02:07:44.320
because there's just not good writing in that series

02:07:44.320 --> 02:07:46.320
hey if they got the first

02:07:46.320 --> 02:07:48.320
game writing team it would be good

02:07:48.320 --> 02:07:50.320
oh I'm sorry to say that it

02:07:50.320 --> 02:07:52.320
has been stricken from the list

02:07:52.320 --> 02:07:54.320
sorry Dark Sakura

02:07:54.320 --> 02:07:56.320
I guess while we're talking about things that

02:07:56.320 --> 02:07:58.320
will never happen

02:07:58.320 --> 02:08:00.320

alright sounds good now how do I

02:09:36.320 --> 02:09:38.320
end this poll when it's done do we just uncheck

02:09:38.320 --> 02:09:40.320
answerable and that uncheck live

02:09:40.320 --> 02:09:42.320
uncheck live and that gets rid of it okay

02:09:42.320 --> 02:09:44.320
yeah I actually see a bug on this

02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:46.320
too oh really

02:09:46.320 --> 02:09:48.320
oh yeah you know it's the score yeah

02:09:48.320 --> 02:09:50.320
what's happening is the scoring wrong

02:09:50.320 --> 02:09:52.320
well you notice how like

02:09:52.320 --> 02:09:54.320
it's

02:09:54.320 --> 02:09:56.320
that's weird what is weird I know why

02:09:56.320 --> 02:09:58.320
it's doing it what's wrong

02:09:58.320 --> 02:10:00.320
oh it's not sorting it that's not a big deal

02:10:00.320 --> 02:10:02.320
well it is sorting it but not

02:10:02.320 --> 02:10:04.320
sorting it by the first number and not

02:10:04.320 --> 02:10:06.320
the entire number

02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:08.320
oh I get it it's sorting it

02:10:08.320 --> 02:10:10.320
as a string instead of an integer

02:10:10.320 --> 02:10:12.320
that's coding terms

02:10:12.320 --> 02:10:14.320
oh I see what it's doing we can still

02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:16.320
count them yeah I can count Bobby believe

02:10:16.320 --> 02:10:18.320

02:11:16.320 --> 02:11:18.320

02:11:18.320 --> 02:11:20.320
yes

02:11:20.320 --> 02:11:22.320
mailbag at orange lounge radio.com

02:11:22.320 --> 02:11:24.320
is the place to send us emails dark soccer

02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:26.320
is gonna dive in head first and

02:11:26.320 --> 02:11:28.320
find some emails that she thinks are

02:11:28.320 --> 02:11:30.320
worthy of reading on the show tonight

02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:32.320
first email

02:11:32.320 --> 02:11:34.320
it's also subject line is

02:11:34.320 --> 02:11:36.320
now they've done it

02:11:36.320 --> 02:11:38.320
I looked up hubris the other day to make sure it meant

02:11:38.320 --> 02:11:40.320
what I thought it did Microsoft definitely

02:11:40.320 --> 02:11:42.320
has an overabundance of hubris

02:11:42.320 --> 02:11:44.320
they revealed Xbox

02:11:44.320 --> 02:11:46.320
one and the consumers on the internet

02:11:46.320 --> 02:11:48.320
made assumptions then Microsoft denied

02:11:48.320 --> 02:11:50.320
the rumors but last Thursday confirmed all

02:11:50.320 --> 02:11:52.320
the rumors to be true and the

02:11:52.320 --> 02:11:54.320
consumers are not happy see major Nelson's

02:11:54.320 --> 02:11:56.320
blog comments to see the shit storm

02:11:56.320 --> 02:11:58.320
the xbox one seems to be defying

02:11:58.320 --> 02:12:00.320
the consumers

02:12:00.320 --> 02:12:02.320
I'm sorry the consumers who use the internet

02:12:02.320 --> 02:12:04.320
oh wait those are the target demographic

02:12:04.320 --> 02:12:06.320
it's really stupid business wise

02:12:06.320 --> 02:12:08.320
to ignore your customer base and punish them

02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:10.320
in the process I hope they change

02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:12.320
and that comes from Rababa

02:12:12.320 --> 02:12:14.320
agreed

02:12:14.320 --> 02:12:16.320
I'm gonna apologize can you summarize that for me cause Alan

02:12:16.320 --> 02:12:18.320
just got home and I was talking to him

02:12:18.320 --> 02:12:20.320
um basically Microsoft denying the rumors then

02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:22.320
confirming the rumors and a big shit storm

02:12:22.320 --> 02:12:24.320
yeah what's up with that they totally did

02:12:24.320 --> 02:12:26.320
say no it's but then they were also

02:12:26.320 --> 02:12:28.320
saying like at one point what like

02:12:28.320 --> 02:12:30.320
it was gonna be $60 for the license

02:12:30.320 --> 02:12:32.320
or something I don't

02:12:32.320 --> 02:12:34.320
sometimes the left hand isn't talking to the right hand is it

02:12:34.320 --> 02:12:36.320
well and I'll repeat this line

02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:38.320
it's really stupid business wise to ignore your

02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:40.320
customer base and punish them in the process

02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:42.320
so that was from Rababa

02:12:42.320 --> 02:12:44.320
well thank you Rababa

02:12:44.320 --> 02:12:46.320
very very good points and the last

02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:48.320
demo cause we only had two

02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:50.320
unless you want me to read all of the Russian porn

02:12:50.320 --> 02:12:52.320
and the French porn and god are we

02:12:52.320 --> 02:12:54.320
still getting those no well you

02:12:54.320 --> 02:12:56.320
took care of all of those but well apparently we're not

02:12:56.320 --> 02:12:58.320
getting me verse porn thanks to Bobby

02:12:58.320 --> 02:13:00.320
really of course you get Russian porn

02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:02.320
I get all sorts of like

02:13:02.320 --> 02:13:04.320
porn emails I'm like I don't know why

02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:06.320
I don't sign up for porn

02:13:06.320 --> 02:13:08.320
no one signs up for porn

02:13:08.320 --> 02:13:10.320
porn happens

02:13:10.320 --> 02:13:12.320
okay this is another one

02:13:12.320 --> 02:13:14.320
from Rababa

02:13:14.320 --> 02:13:16.320
you should probably avoid my other emails for reading

02:13:16.320 --> 02:13:18.320
too late this is about

02:13:18.320 --> 02:13:20.320
the Xbox how it games letter I

02:13:20.320 --> 02:13:22.320
slash we got via email

02:13:22.320 --> 02:13:24.320
here is one quote feature

02:13:24.320 --> 02:13:26.320
your games keep playing even

02:13:26.320 --> 02:13:28.320
when you're not just because you're not playing

02:13:28.320 --> 02:13:30.320
doesn't mean your games have to stop

02:13:30.320 --> 02:13:32.320
with living games technology and the power of the

02:13:32.320 --> 02:13:34.320
cloud game worlds are persistent

02:13:34.320 --> 02:13:36.320
so the things you do in a game will

02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:38.320
stay that way wait the living

02:13:38.320 --> 02:13:40.320
games continue to play without you like an MMO

02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:42.320
which is the opposite of things

02:13:42.320 --> 02:13:44.320
you do in the game will stay that way

02:13:44.320 --> 02:13:46.320
we call that technology save files

02:13:46.320 --> 02:13:48.320
thank you Rababa

02:14:44.320 --> 02:14:46.320
FU to just realizing

02:14:46.320 --> 02:14:48.320
that you're gonna give me a bunch of

02:14:48.320 --> 02:14:50.320
chocolate not that like

02:14:50.320 --> 02:14:52.320

02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:54.320
I waited for Allen, Allen chocolate

02:14:58.320 --> 02:15:00.320
alright Loki

02:15:00.320 --> 02:15:02.320
FU to my laptop for the hard drive

02:15:02.320 --> 02:15:04.320
failing and then having

02:15:04.320 --> 02:15:06.320
these things that they put in place

02:15:06.320 --> 02:15:08.320
like recovery partition just not doing

02:15:08.320 --> 02:15:10.320
anything it got so bad that like

02:15:10.320 --> 02:15:12.320
Windows could read the hard drive cause I was able to

02:15:12.320 --> 02:15:14.320
boot in the Windows and stuff but then it's like

02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:16.320
oh you wanna fix that drive well I can't read that

02:15:16.320 --> 02:15:18.320
drive to fix it

02:15:18.320 --> 02:15:20.320
so that kinda sucked but at least I got

02:15:20.320 --> 02:15:22.320
a new hard drive in there that I had to take

02:15:22.320 --> 02:15:24.320
out onto my JTAG which I'm not using

02:15:24.320 --> 02:15:26.320
my Xbox of fame

02:15:26.320 --> 02:15:28.320
unfortunately

02:15:28.320 --> 02:15:30.320
and then also

02:15:30.320 --> 02:15:32.320
FU to Steam

02:15:32.320 --> 02:15:34.320
actually just for this weekend because

02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:36.320
I was trying to

02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:38.320
I installed Steam on my new

02:15:38.320 --> 02:15:40.320
installation of Windows and it asked me

02:15:40.320 --> 02:15:42.320
hey I haven't played on this PC before

02:15:42.320 --> 02:15:44.320
you need to authenticate with us

02:15:44.320 --> 02:15:46.320
and then they went and sent me the email

02:15:46.320 --> 02:15:48.320
I was like what the hell

02:15:48.320 --> 02:15:50.320
it ended up being that their server was all fucked

02:15:50.320 --> 02:15:52.320
up this weekend so it was sent to the email

02:15:52.320 --> 02:15:54.320
like two hours after you

02:15:54.320 --> 02:15:56.320
you know sent them the

02:15:56.320 --> 02:15:58.320
confirmation normally it's like immediate

02:15:58.320 --> 02:16:00.320

02:16:08.320 --> 02:16:10.320
I finally spent time

02:16:10.320 --> 02:16:12.320
in your fantastic little town

02:16:12.320 --> 02:16:14.320
actually you know what no there's a lot to like about Phoenix

02:16:14.320 --> 02:16:16.320

02:16:20.320 --> 02:16:22.320
like a giant grid so you like

02:16:22.320 --> 02:16:24.320
can't get lost in Phoenix if you get lost in Phoenix

02:16:24.320 --> 02:16:26.320

because it ran off PCs anyways so

02:17:54.320 --> 02:17:56.320

02:19:00.320 --> 02:19:02.320
alright there it is

02:19:02.320 --> 02:19:04.320

the Microsoft server crashes for 24 hours

02:19:06.320 --> 02:19:08.320
number 2 Grand Theft Auto or Saints Row MMO

02:19:08.320 --> 02:19:10.320
number 1 Half Life 3 released

02:19:10.320 --> 02:19:12.320

02:19:12.320 --> 02:19:14.320
thank you and good night

02:19:14.320 --> 02:19:16.320
alright and Black Wolf is celebrating in chat

02:19:16.320 --> 02:19:18.320
a winner is me

02:19:18.320 --> 02:19:20.320
I think he hacked the system couldn't he have done that

02:19:20.320 --> 02:19:22.320
couldn't he have hacked the system to give himself more points

02:19:22.320 --> 02:19:24.320
he may have the game has been hacked

02:19:24.320 --> 02:19:26.320
alright just a couple more news stories

02:19:26.320 --> 02:19:28.320
for you guys and then we're going to get to the Twitter

02:19:28.320 --> 02:19:30.320
topics and our Skype line at

02:19:30.320 --> 02:19:32.320
1877 Game OLR or our username

02:19:32.320 --> 02:19:34.320
on Skype OrangeLoungeRadio but first

02:19:34.320 --> 02:19:36.320
Loki

02:19:36.320 --> 02:19:38.320
Minecraft is getting some updates on the

02:19:38.320 --> 02:19:40.320
portable version or the Pocket

02:19:40.320 --> 02:19:42.320
Edition including

02:19:42.320 --> 02:19:44.320
Alpha Realms support and if you remember

02:19:44.320 --> 02:19:46.320
correctly Minecraft Realms is that new

02:19:46.320 --> 02:19:48.320
Mojang

02:19:48.320 --> 02:19:50.320
run private servers basically

02:19:50.320 --> 02:19:52.320
and it will support

02:19:52.320 --> 02:19:54.320
online play for up to 10 players

02:19:54.320 --> 02:19:56.320
simultaneously within a single

02:19:56.320 --> 02:19:58.320
world and allow you to collaborate on

02:19:58.320 --> 02:20:00.320
projects and stuff like that and the

02:20:00.320 --> 02:20:02.320
alpha version is free

02:20:02.320 --> 02:20:04.320
and I guess it will be an optional paid

02:20:04.320 --> 02:20:06.320
service later on also they've

02:20:06.320 --> 02:20:08.320
added eggs, milk, cake

02:20:08.320 --> 02:20:10.320
and fire to the game

02:20:10.320 --> 02:20:12.320
you know so that you can

02:20:12.320 --> 02:20:14.320
you can make cake

02:20:14.320 --> 02:20:16.320
so

02:20:16.320 --> 02:20:18.320
glad to see that the

02:20:18.320 --> 02:20:20.320
Android version is getting some updates

02:20:20.320 --> 02:20:22.320
I wish that I know one of the things that they're working

02:20:22.320 --> 02:20:24.320
on and I don't think it's happened yet is controller

02:20:24.320 --> 02:20:26.320
support for that because if that's the case then I

02:20:26.320 --> 02:20:28.320
can sideload that onto my Ouya and play with the

02:20:28.320 --> 02:20:30.320
controller and it would be fantastic

02:20:30.320 --> 02:20:32.320
and oh god

02:20:32.320 --> 02:20:34.320
dammit I knew there were some I forgot nephews of the week

02:20:34.320 --> 02:20:36.320
but I'll mention it real quickly since they're talking about Minecraft

02:20:36.320 --> 02:20:38.320
what the hell the fucking vog network

02:20:38.320 --> 02:20:40.320
Minecraft server host

02:20:40.320 --> 02:20:42.320
is absolute shit

02:20:42.320 --> 02:20:44.320
and it's been down for five days now

02:20:44.320 --> 02:20:46.320
and I've sent you a bunch

02:20:46.320 --> 02:20:48.320
of support tickets to them

02:20:48.320 --> 02:20:50.320
no fucking response back

02:20:50.320 --> 02:20:52.320
but they sure as hell took out the money

02:20:52.320 --> 02:20:54.320
out of my account this weekend

02:20:54.320 --> 02:20:56.320
to pay for it so I'm looking

02:20:56.320 --> 02:20:58.320
there's three magic words

02:20:58.320 --> 02:21:00.320
that will get action

02:21:00.320 --> 02:21:02.320
Better Business Bureau

02:21:02.320 --> 02:21:04.320
so I'm gonna be

02:21:04.320 --> 02:21:06.320
I'm gonna either switch the server to a new

02:21:06.320 --> 02:21:08.320
host or I'm just gonna shut it down

02:21:08.320 --> 02:21:10.320
because no one's really playing on it

02:21:10.320 --> 02:21:12.320
you know I tried to log into it this week

02:21:12.320 --> 02:21:14.320
I played last week

02:21:14.320 --> 02:21:16.320
but it's just not a lot of people on there

02:21:16.320 --> 02:21:18.320
so it's you know even though it's ten bucks a month

02:21:18.320 --> 02:21:20.320
it's just you know

02:21:20.320 --> 02:21:22.320
I'll give you five dollars

02:21:22.320 --> 02:21:24.320
no one plays, it goes down

02:21:24.320 --> 02:21:26.320
alright

02:21:26.320 --> 02:21:28.320
one more news story for you guys

02:21:28.320 --> 02:21:30.320
and I think this is appropriate

02:21:30.320 --> 02:21:32.320
as a final news story tonight

02:21:32.320 --> 02:21:34.320
and I know Dark Soccer will be excited about this

02:21:34.320 --> 02:21:36.320
what?

02:21:36.320 --> 02:21:38.320
this is a game that was announced by The Game Atlier

02:21:38.320 --> 02:21:40.320
they developed a game called Sunflowers

02:21:40.320 --> 02:21:42.320
well they have announced

02:21:42.320 --> 02:21:44.320
a little arcade style

02:21:44.320 --> 02:21:46.320
cute em up

02:21:46.320 --> 02:21:48.320
it's called Flying Hamster HD

02:21:48.320 --> 02:21:50.320
and it's coming to the Playstation Vita

02:21:50.320 --> 02:21:52.320
on June 11th

02:21:52.320 --> 02:21:54.320
well that doesn't mean no good

02:21:54.320 --> 02:21:56.320
well and they have announced

02:21:56.320 --> 02:21:58.320
they have announced that this game is inspired by

02:21:58.320 --> 02:22:00.320
and this is why Dark Soccer is excited

02:22:00.320 --> 02:22:02.320
it's inspired by Konami's Parodius series

02:22:02.320 --> 02:22:04.320
here's some gameplay

02:22:04.320 --> 02:22:06.320
a little Flying Hamster

02:22:06.320 --> 02:22:08.320
oh that's awesome

02:22:08.320 --> 02:22:10.320
and if you want to play it though

02:22:10.320 --> 02:22:12.320
oh nice

02:22:14.320 --> 02:22:16.320
I like the little Egyptian penguin

02:22:16.320 --> 02:22:18.320
super cute

02:22:18.320 --> 02:22:20.320
I wanna fight the hell

02:22:20.320 --> 02:22:22.320
so this is super cute

02:22:22.320 --> 02:22:24.320
it is cute

02:22:24.320 --> 02:22:26.320
and you gotta love somebody who says they're inspired by Parodius right?

02:22:26.320 --> 02:22:28.320
Parodius is like one of the best games ever

02:22:28.320 --> 02:22:30.320
online leaderboards

02:22:30.320 --> 02:22:32.320
unlockable trophies

02:22:32.320 --> 02:22:34.320
and all that fun stuff

02:22:34.320 --> 02:22:36.320
on the Playstation Network

02:22:36.320 --> 02:22:38.320
the game is also on the Playstation mini service

02:22:38.320 --> 02:22:40.320
the original

02:22:40.320 --> 02:22:42.320
Flying Hamster is on the minis

02:22:42.320 --> 02:22:44.320
so that's pretty cool

02:22:44.320 --> 02:22:46.320
it has fat mermaids

02:22:46.320 --> 02:22:48.320
that's also a great little indie

02:22:48.320 --> 02:22:50.320
you might not have noticed that otherwise title

02:22:50.320 --> 02:22:52.320
so I'm really glad we're getting a little bit of a spotlight on that

02:22:52.320 --> 02:22:54.320
very cool

02:22:54.320 --> 02:22:56.320
so Dark Soccer is thinking about getting a Vita for that

02:22:56.320 --> 02:22:58.320
no I'm not

02:22:58.320 --> 02:23:00.320
it's downloaded on your iPad

02:23:00.320 --> 02:23:02.320
alright, I think it's about time to open up the Skypline

02:23:02.320 --> 02:23:04.320
because I'm sorry, nothing is Pentaro

02:23:04.320 --> 02:23:06.320
let's open up the Skypline

02:23:06.320 --> 02:23:08.320
1-877-GAME-OLR

02:23:08.320 --> 02:23:10.320
or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio

02:23:10.320 --> 02:23:12.320
it is time to get some calls

02:23:12.320 --> 02:23:14.320
here on this Sunday night

02:23:14.320 --> 02:23:16.320
we wanna know, what are your E3 thoughts?

02:23:16.320 --> 02:23:18.320
you don't have to give them in a haiku form

02:23:18.320 --> 02:23:20.320
but bonus points if you do

02:23:20.320 --> 02:23:22.320
maybe you have something to say

02:23:22.320 --> 02:23:24.320
about all this Xbox One business

02:23:24.320 --> 02:23:26.320
I'm sure some of our regular callers have an opinion

02:23:26.320 --> 02:23:28.320
or three, or five, or ten

02:23:28.320 --> 02:23:30.320
on what we talked about at the very beginning of the show

02:23:30.320 --> 02:23:32.320
or maybe there's something else completely different we've missed

02:23:32.320 --> 02:23:34.320
we wanna hear from you guys

02:23:34.320 --> 02:23:36.320
on GameOLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio

02:23:36.320 --> 02:23:38.320
and look at that

02:23:38.320 --> 02:23:40.320
it's already ringing

02:23:40.320 --> 02:23:42.320
already got calls coming in tonight, let's go to it

02:23:42.320 --> 02:23:44.320
hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:23:44.320 --> 02:23:46.320
it's a sobered up Rama

02:23:46.320 --> 02:23:48.320
I'm sorry to hear that

02:23:48.320 --> 02:23:50.320
how are you otherwise, Rama?

02:23:50.320 --> 02:23:52.320
I'm doing pretty good, how about y'all out there in California?

02:23:52.320 --> 02:23:54.320
hot!

02:23:54.320 --> 02:23:56.320
actually, today was better

02:23:56.320 --> 02:23:58.320
I had chocolate, and I'm happy

02:23:58.320 --> 02:24:00.320
yeah, I've calmed down a little bit

02:24:00.320 --> 02:24:02.320
yesterday was 110, tomorrow is going to be 80

02:24:02.320 --> 02:24:04.320
go fig

02:24:04.320 --> 02:24:06.320
yep

02:24:06.320 --> 02:24:08.320
well, what's new with you, Rama, why'd you call in tonight?

02:24:08.320 --> 02:24:10.320
a couple of things, but

02:24:10.320 --> 02:24:12.320
before I get into it, um, hey, Ookchan

02:24:12.320 --> 02:24:14.320
huh

02:24:14.320 --> 02:24:16.320
looks like at Otacon this year we may be

02:24:16.320 --> 02:24:18.320
bringing Rama one half back

02:24:18.320 --> 02:24:20.320
yay!

02:24:20.320 --> 02:24:22.320
yes, a few of us are doing a quick impromptu

02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:24.320
group photo

02:24:24.320 --> 02:24:26.320
well, send me a copy of it

02:24:26.320 --> 02:24:28.320
definitely, too bad I can't come with my spatula

02:24:28.320 --> 02:24:30.320
well, and if we have to

02:24:30.320 --> 02:24:32.320
we'll pack you in a box

02:24:32.320 --> 02:24:34.320
I wish I could go, I really do

02:24:34.320 --> 02:24:36.320
but unfortunately, money, blah blah

02:24:36.320 --> 02:24:38.320
okay, okay

02:24:38.320 --> 02:24:40.320
okay, this is the real reason

02:24:40.320 --> 02:24:42.320
why I called

02:24:42.320 --> 02:24:44.320
number one, I understand what everyone

02:24:44.320 --> 02:24:46.320
says about the Xbox One, but

02:24:46.320 --> 02:24:48.320
truth be told, it's still

02:24:48.320 --> 02:24:50.320
going to sell, because they're going to have

02:24:50.320 --> 02:24:52.320
these top tier titles

02:24:52.320 --> 02:24:54.320
and you have to forget

02:24:54.320 --> 02:24:56.320
half the gamers in

02:24:56.320 --> 02:24:58.320
video gaming fandom are lemmings

02:24:58.320 --> 02:25:00.320
they will say one thing

02:25:00.320 --> 02:25:02.320
and then after the presentation you see all these

02:25:02.320 --> 02:25:04.320
games, it'll be like, shut up and take

02:25:04.320 --> 02:25:06.320
my money

02:25:06.320 --> 02:25:08.320
couldn't you say the same thing about Nintendo's

02:25:08.320 --> 02:25:10.320
Wii U, though?

02:25:10.320 --> 02:25:12.320
yes, I can say that about every single gaming console

02:25:12.320 --> 02:25:14.320
but then what happens after

02:25:14.320 --> 02:25:16.320
that? The Nintendo fanboys have bought

02:25:16.320 --> 02:25:18.320
the Wii U and they're still calling it a failure

02:25:18.320 --> 02:25:20.320
you know, I still think the jury's

02:25:20.320 --> 02:25:22.320
out on that to give it another holiday season

02:25:22.320 --> 02:25:24.320
before we, you know,

02:25:24.320 --> 02:25:26.320
build its coffin, but

02:25:26.320 --> 02:25:28.320
uh,

02:25:28.320 --> 02:25:30.320
I don't know, why do you think

02:25:30.320 --> 02:25:32.320
that is?

02:25:34.320 --> 02:25:36.320
It's the way people

02:25:36.320 --> 02:25:38.320
think, and I'm kind of reminded

02:25:38.320 --> 02:25:40.320
from back in the days of everybody was

02:25:40.320 --> 02:25:42.320
importing the DDR in the Beatmania

02:25:42.320 --> 02:25:44.320
game to then when Konami started bringing over

02:25:44.320 --> 02:25:46.320
DDR and people

02:25:46.320 --> 02:25:48.320
got pissed at certain titles were not

02:25:48.320 --> 02:25:50.320
in the US releases, they were like, I'm not going

02:25:50.320 --> 02:25:52.320
to buy it, the game comes out, they

02:25:52.320 --> 02:25:54.320
buy it anyway to support

02:25:54.320 --> 02:25:56.320
their fandom. As for these next-gen

02:25:56.320 --> 02:25:58.320
consoles, one of the reasons why people are going to

02:25:58.320 --> 02:26:00.320
buy them is to support the console, they think it's going

02:26:00.320 --> 02:26:02.320
to work. To be fair, buddy,

02:26:02.320 --> 02:26:04.320
you're talking about a $40 game versus a

02:26:04.320 --> 02:26:06.320
$500 console, potentially, potentially.

02:26:06.320 --> 02:26:08.320
I know, but it's how some people

02:26:08.320 --> 02:26:10.320
think, and that's kind of scary.

02:26:10.320 --> 02:26:12.320
Yeah. And

02:26:12.320 --> 02:26:14.320
with the fact that Microsoft's bringing up

02:26:14.320 --> 02:26:16.320
so many servers, I don't think

02:26:16.320 --> 02:26:18.320
there's going to be that big of an issue of server downtime.

02:26:18.320 --> 02:26:20.320
You don't?

02:26:20.320 --> 02:26:22.320
I don't think so.

02:26:22.320 --> 02:26:24.320
I don't think Blizzard or EA thought so either.

02:26:24.320 --> 02:26:26.320
That's my worry.

02:26:26.320 --> 02:26:28.320
Well, maybe

02:26:28.320 --> 02:26:30.320
I don't know how many servers

02:26:30.320 --> 02:26:32.320
other manufacturers have, but I have this feeling

02:26:32.320 --> 02:26:34.320
Microsoft's going to have like the most, and they said

02:26:34.320 --> 02:26:36.320
straight up, they're going to bring up all these

02:26:36.320 --> 02:26:38.320
servers ahead of time. So I'm guessing

02:26:38.320 --> 02:26:40.320
some of the mistakes with EA and Blizzard

02:26:40.320 --> 02:26:42.320
were doing with servers, so who

02:26:42.320 --> 02:26:44.320
knows? So where's your head

02:26:44.320 --> 02:26:46.320
out with Xbox One after all of

02:26:46.320 --> 02:26:48.320
this?

02:26:48.320 --> 02:26:50.320
I said before, shut up and take my money

02:26:50.320 --> 02:26:52.320
for a PS4, but you know what? I'm going

02:26:52.320 --> 02:26:54.320
to wait until after the presentations and see what

02:26:54.320 --> 02:26:56.320
everybody has to say, and then make my decision.

02:26:56.320 --> 02:26:58.320
Based off games are most

02:26:58.320 --> 02:27:00.320
important?

02:27:00.320 --> 02:27:02.320
Not really. It's like games,

02:27:02.320 --> 02:27:04.320
technology, functionality, a little bit of everything.

02:27:04.320 --> 02:27:06.320
Let me ask you one more

02:27:06.320 --> 02:27:08.320
question, because I know you're a long time listener to this

02:27:08.320 --> 02:27:10.320
show. Were you here at the very beginning of the show, or did you come in

02:27:10.320 --> 02:27:12.320
late tonight? I was here at the very beginning of the

02:27:12.320 --> 02:27:14.320
show. Okay. I wouldn't judge you if you were late,

02:27:14.320 --> 02:27:16.320
but I just want to know, earlier in the show I asked

02:27:16.320 --> 02:27:18.320
Dark Sakura about the golden rule of gaming,

02:27:18.320 --> 02:27:20.320
and we kind of came to a consensus that

02:27:20.320 --> 02:27:22.320
perhaps the golden rule of gaming, a system

02:27:22.320 --> 02:27:24.320
is only as good as the games that are on it, could be

02:27:24.320 --> 02:27:26.320
evolving. What do you think?

02:27:26.320 --> 02:27:28.320
I think

02:27:28.320 --> 02:27:30.320
so too, because

02:27:30.320 --> 02:27:32.320
that golden rule is the reason why I got

02:27:32.320 --> 02:27:34.320
a 360 before the PS3.

02:27:34.320 --> 02:27:36.320
Because people are going to argue,

02:27:36.320 --> 02:27:38.320
why did you get that next gen console?

02:27:38.320 --> 02:27:40.320
All these cool games

02:27:40.320 --> 02:27:42.320
were on that one, and the answer is, well,

02:27:42.320 --> 02:27:44.320
those games are not games

02:27:44.320 --> 02:27:46.320
I would particularly like to play.

02:27:46.320 --> 02:27:48.320
The games that I've played and I've enjoyed

02:27:48.320 --> 02:27:50.320
are on this console. This console is going to

02:27:50.320 --> 02:27:52.320
offer these games I am interested in,

02:27:52.320 --> 02:27:54.320
which is why I'm going to buy it.

02:27:54.320 --> 02:27:56.320
YYR

02:27:56.320 --> 02:27:58.320
in our chat saying, having to start all over

02:27:58.320 --> 02:28:00.320
will make the new consoles even more expensive.

02:28:00.320 --> 02:28:02.320
New controllers, new accessories, new

02:28:02.320 --> 02:28:04.320
games, this is going to be expensive.

02:28:04.320 --> 02:28:06.320
If the consoles are $500 or so, the

02:28:06.320 --> 02:28:08.320
real cost will be a few hundred more than that.

02:28:08.320 --> 02:28:10.320
I don't think it's a given that they'll buy it.

02:28:10.320 --> 02:28:12.320
Well,

02:28:12.320 --> 02:28:14.320
I still remember when I was

02:28:14.320 --> 02:28:16.320
working at Staples, I looked outside

02:28:16.320 --> 02:28:18.320
the long line of people across the street at

02:28:18.320 --> 02:28:20.320
Circuit City for the

02:28:20.320 --> 02:28:22.320
$500 and $600 PlayStation 3.

02:28:22.320 --> 02:28:24.320
That's true, there'll be an audience

02:28:24.320 --> 02:28:26.320
somewhere, but will it be big enough?

02:28:26.320 --> 02:28:28.320
That's the question. Alright, Brahma, I gotta

02:28:28.320 --> 02:28:30.320
let you go to get more calls, but any other thoughts before I let you go?

02:28:30.320 --> 02:28:32.320
Yeah,

02:28:32.320 --> 02:28:34.320
I'm sorry, but this is the thing. I don't know if

02:28:34.320 --> 02:28:36.320
you heard, but GameStop had a

02:28:36.320 --> 02:28:38.320
special this week on Injustice

02:28:38.320 --> 02:28:40.320
Gods Among Men.

02:28:40.320 --> 02:28:42.320
You mean Gods Among Us, but yes.

02:28:42.320 --> 02:28:44.320
$10, one hour

02:28:44.320 --> 02:28:46.320
sale only. So many people

02:28:46.320 --> 02:28:48.320
flooded the site to try to buy it

02:28:48.320 --> 02:28:50.320
online. What I found out about this,

02:28:50.320 --> 02:28:52.320
I went and I printed out the

02:28:52.320 --> 02:28:54.320
paper. When I got out of class, I

02:28:54.320 --> 02:28:56.320
went down to Best Buy, and I

02:28:56.320 --> 02:28:58.320
got them to price match a $60

02:28:58.320 --> 02:29:00.320
game for $10

02:29:00.320 --> 02:29:02.320
that happened about two and a half

02:29:02.320 --> 02:29:04.320
hours after the sale ended. Nice work.

02:29:06.320 --> 02:29:08.320
Did you enjoy the game?

02:29:08.320 --> 02:29:10.320
Yes, it's one of the few games where I

02:29:10.320 --> 02:29:12.320
actually enjoyed it because I was playing it

02:29:12.320 --> 02:29:14.320
more for the story than anything else.

02:29:14.320 --> 02:29:16.320
As coming from someone who

02:29:16.320 --> 02:29:18.320
does not believe in paying

02:29:18.320 --> 02:29:20.320
retail price for a game unless you can

02:29:20.320 --> 02:29:22.320
get it to knock down, I honestly

02:29:22.320 --> 02:29:24.320
say the game

02:29:24.320 --> 02:29:26.320
is worth $50

02:29:26.320 --> 02:29:28.320
at least. I can't see myself

02:29:28.320 --> 02:29:30.320
paying $59. I see myself paying

02:29:30.320 --> 02:29:32.320
$49 or maybe $54, but

02:29:32.320 --> 02:29:34.320
full retail, no. It is a

02:29:34.320 --> 02:29:36.320
tricky line once you break that $50 barrier.

02:29:36.320 --> 02:29:38.320
It's something psychological about it, but

02:29:38.320 --> 02:29:40.320
we could do a whole other episode on that.

02:29:40.320 --> 02:29:42.320
But I should let you go for now, Rama.

02:29:42.320 --> 02:29:44.320
Everybody listen to Anime Jam Session.

02:29:44.320 --> 02:29:46.320
You got it. We'll be talking

02:29:46.320 --> 02:29:48.320
about Denver Comic Con and Anime Next on Tuesday.

02:29:48.320 --> 02:29:50.320
Wow, you guys got a busy show. Alright, have a good

02:29:50.320 --> 02:29:52.320
one, buddy. You too. Bye.

02:29:52.320 --> 02:29:54.320
Alright.

02:29:54.320 --> 02:29:56.320
That's right. Even though we've been talking a lot

02:29:56.320 --> 02:29:58.320
on this show about E3, there's

02:29:58.320 --> 02:30:00.320
lots of other nerd shows at the Voice of Geeks Network

02:30:00.320 --> 02:30:02.320
talking about other stuff. So there's anime conventions going on.

02:30:02.320 --> 02:30:04.320
I'm sure somebody's going to be talking about

02:30:04.320 --> 02:30:06.320
Apple stuff on Monday, so

02:30:06.320 --> 02:30:08.320
stay tuned for that and all the great

02:30:08.320 --> 02:30:10.320
shows on the Voice of Geeks Network at vognetwork.com

02:30:10.320 --> 02:30:12.320
Let's go to the phones

02:30:12.320 --> 02:30:14.320
which are lighting up and take another call.

02:30:14.320 --> 02:30:16.320
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:30:16.320 --> 02:30:18.320
This

02:30:18.320 --> 02:30:20.320
is YYR. I just

02:30:20.320 --> 02:30:22.320
called to drop this rhyme.

02:30:22.320 --> 02:30:24.320
Haha, I'm a troll.

02:30:28.320 --> 02:30:30.320
We're going to have to have

02:30:30.320 --> 02:30:32.320
haiku call night at some point, and

02:30:32.320 --> 02:30:34.320
everybody will have to do that.

02:30:34.320 --> 02:30:36.320
Well played, my friend. Well played.

02:30:36.320 --> 02:30:38.320
I'm tipping my hat to you. You just can't

02:30:38.320 --> 02:30:40.320
see it.

02:30:40.320 --> 02:30:42.320
Rob's hat is invisible and intangible.

02:30:42.320 --> 02:30:44.320
Actually, that's really the only reason I called

02:30:44.320 --> 02:30:46.320
it. That's right. Well, since I have

02:30:46.320 --> 02:30:48.320
a captive audience, how is

02:30:48.320 --> 02:30:50.320
bungee ferret tossing going?

02:30:50.320 --> 02:30:52.320
Haha.

02:30:52.320 --> 02:30:54.320
It's beer money. Beer money is great

02:30:54.320 --> 02:30:56.320
because it buys beer.

02:30:56.320 --> 02:30:58.320
But I don't think

02:30:58.320 --> 02:31:00.320
you've seen the last of bungee ferret tossing.

02:31:00.320 --> 02:31:02.320
I'm

02:31:02.320 --> 02:31:04.320
deep in other projects right now

02:31:04.320 --> 02:31:06.320
such as ports to

02:31:06.320 --> 02:31:08.320
the smartphones and tablets I

02:31:08.320 --> 02:31:10.320
like to complain about, but

02:31:10.320 --> 02:31:12.320
I think at some point I would love

02:31:12.320 --> 02:31:14.320
to revisit that universe, yes.

02:31:14.320 --> 02:31:16.320
Wow, okay. Very cool.

02:31:16.320 --> 02:31:18.320
What do you think about the way

02:31:18.320 --> 02:31:20.320
there's been a lot of news about Xbox One

02:31:20.320 --> 02:31:22.320
is kind of shafting indies or whatever.

02:31:22.320 --> 02:31:24.320
I mean, as somebody who developed

02:31:24.320 --> 02:31:26.320
quite a bit, you did several games, not just

02:31:26.320 --> 02:31:28.320
bungee ferret tossing, but I know you had Snake 360

02:31:28.320 --> 02:31:30.320
and Falling. You did a few games for

02:31:30.320 --> 02:31:32.320
the XNA

02:31:32.320 --> 02:31:34.320
or Xbox Live

02:31:34.320 --> 02:31:36.320
indie games. What do you think about all this news

02:31:36.320 --> 02:31:38.320
about Xbox One?

02:31:38.320 --> 02:31:40.320
Well, I mean, as far as

02:31:40.320 --> 02:31:42.320
indie games in general

02:31:42.320 --> 02:31:44.320
specifically, Microsoft

02:31:44.320 --> 02:31:46.320
already said they're not going to allow anyone to

02:31:46.320 --> 02:31:48.320
self-publish on one

02:31:48.320 --> 02:31:50.320
at first. And

02:31:50.320 --> 02:31:52.320
I think that's a game changer

02:31:52.320 --> 02:31:54.320
especially when Sony has

02:31:54.320 --> 02:31:56.320
come out and said, yes, if you want to self-publish

02:31:56.320 --> 02:31:58.320
come to us. PS4

02:31:58.320 --> 02:32:00.320
will be happy to

02:32:00.320 --> 02:32:02.320
host your self-published game.

02:32:02.320 --> 02:32:04.320
And of course Nintendo is

02:32:04.320 --> 02:32:06.320
welcoming

02:32:06.320 --> 02:32:08.320
self-publishing on

02:32:08.320 --> 02:32:10.320
Wii U as well to some degree.

02:32:10.320 --> 02:32:12.320
I think you still need a business address

02:32:12.320 --> 02:32:14.320
to be a developer for a Nintendo platform.

02:32:14.320 --> 02:32:16.320
But besides that

02:32:16.320 --> 02:32:18.320
yeah,

02:32:18.320 --> 02:32:20.320
it seems that

02:32:20.320 --> 02:32:22.320
Microsoft

02:32:22.320 --> 02:32:24.320
is going to be the least indie-friendly

02:32:24.320 --> 02:32:26.320
next-gen console out of the

02:32:26.320 --> 02:32:28.320
gate. So with that

02:32:28.320 --> 02:32:30.320
in mind, I think that

02:32:30.320 --> 02:32:32.320
depending on how much indie games

02:32:32.320 --> 02:32:34.320
influence

02:32:34.320 --> 02:32:36.320
the next console generation

02:32:36.320 --> 02:32:38.320
that may not matter at all or it may

02:32:38.320 --> 02:32:40.320
matter a lot. It's all going to

02:32:40.320 --> 02:32:42.320
depend on how big of a blip

02:32:42.320 --> 02:32:44.320
on the radar indie games are

02:32:44.320 --> 02:32:46.320
over the next console gen.

02:32:46.320 --> 02:32:48.320
Before I let you go

02:32:48.320 --> 02:32:50.320
It's crazy.

02:32:50.320 --> 02:32:52.320
It's absolutely crazy.

02:32:52.320 --> 02:32:54.320
And I think

02:32:54.320 --> 02:32:56.320
all eyes are going to be on Sony

02:32:56.320 --> 02:32:58.320
at that after-conference

02:32:58.320 --> 02:33:00.320
presser.

02:33:00.320 --> 02:33:02.320
Is PS4 going to be like

02:33:02.320 --> 02:33:04.320
this? Is it going to be like that?

02:33:04.320 --> 02:33:06.320
Is it going to allow us to do this?

02:33:06.320 --> 02:33:08.320
And the answers given there are really going to make

02:33:08.320 --> 02:33:10.320
a big difference as far as how people

02:33:10.320 --> 02:33:12.320
perceive not just the

02:33:12.320 --> 02:33:14.320
Xbox One, but all of the new

02:33:14.320 --> 02:33:16.320
consoles, really.

02:33:16.320 --> 02:33:18.320
I mean, literally, tomorrow

02:33:18.320 --> 02:33:20.320
12 hours away is a huge

02:33:20.320 --> 02:33:22.320
day in gaming.

02:33:22.320 --> 02:33:24.320
One of the biggest ever.

02:33:24.320 --> 02:33:26.320
I'll be on the edge

02:33:26.320 --> 02:33:28.320
of my seat and I know probably

02:33:28.320 --> 02:33:30.320
all of us will be to some

02:33:30.320 --> 02:33:32.320
extent, yes.

02:33:32.320 --> 02:33:34.320
I don't know, I'm going to take a nap.

02:33:34.320 --> 02:33:36.320
Before I let you go, buddy,

02:33:36.320 --> 02:33:38.320
I always kind of like to ask this. I know you just

02:33:38.320 --> 02:33:40.320
called in to give a haiku and here we are with an interview,

02:33:40.320 --> 02:33:42.320
but outside of developing

02:33:42.320 --> 02:33:44.320
your own stuff, what games are you playing?

02:33:44.320 --> 02:33:46.320
What are you enjoying playing lately?

02:33:46.320 --> 02:33:48.320
I've been playing a lot of Tekken

02:33:48.320 --> 02:33:50.320
lately. I actually

02:33:50.320 --> 02:33:52.320
bought the Wii U version just

02:33:52.320 --> 02:33:54.320
out of curiosity and

02:33:54.320 --> 02:33:56.320
I can say

02:33:56.320 --> 02:33:58.320
Tekken Ball, I don't know

02:33:58.320 --> 02:34:00.320
who remembers the Tekken Ball

02:34:00.320 --> 02:34:02.320
minigame in Tekken 3.

02:34:02.320 --> 02:34:04.320
Totally do.

02:34:04.320 --> 02:34:06.320
Yeah, they basically

02:34:06.320 --> 02:34:08.320
updated it graphically and now

02:34:08.320 --> 02:34:10.320
you can actually select

02:34:10.320 --> 02:34:12.320
different balls to use and

02:34:12.320 --> 02:34:14.320
the difference is basically in how

02:34:14.320 --> 02:34:16.320
fast they move, how

02:34:16.320 --> 02:34:18.320
quickly they charge up damage.

02:34:18.320 --> 02:34:20.320
So it's a little bit more customizable

02:34:20.320 --> 02:34:22.320
than it was before and of course you can use

02:34:22.320 --> 02:34:24.320
tag teams, which is for

02:34:24.320 --> 02:34:26.320
Tekken Ball, mostly useless, but

02:34:26.320 --> 02:34:28.320
it's fun anyway.

02:34:28.320 --> 02:34:30.320
So that is pretty much

02:34:30.320 --> 02:34:32.320
the major addition to

02:34:32.320 --> 02:34:34.320
the Tekken on Wii U.

02:34:34.320 --> 02:34:36.320
The mushroom battle that

02:34:36.320 --> 02:34:38.320
everyone made such a big deal about and looks like

02:34:38.320 --> 02:34:40.320
so much fun in videos, it's really not all

02:34:40.320 --> 02:34:42.320
it's cracked up to be.

02:34:42.320 --> 02:34:44.320
I mean, it's fun

02:34:44.320 --> 02:34:46.320
for like five minutes, but after the

02:34:46.320 --> 02:34:48.320
novelty wears off, because basically

02:34:48.320 --> 02:34:50.320
it's like the poison mushrooms

02:34:50.320 --> 02:34:52.320
that shrink you

02:34:52.320 --> 02:34:54.320
and the super mushrooms that

02:34:54.320 --> 02:34:56.320
grow you, the poison mushrooms

02:34:56.320 --> 02:34:58.320
also hurt you and

02:34:58.320 --> 02:35:00.320
the damage is really high to begin

02:35:00.320 --> 02:35:02.320
with, so it's like

02:35:02.320 --> 02:35:04.320
you get a couple mushrooms and already

02:35:04.320 --> 02:35:06.320
one more hit and you're dead.

02:35:06.320 --> 02:35:08.320
So it's over way too quickly and

02:35:08.320 --> 02:35:10.320
you can't play it online and you

02:35:10.320 --> 02:35:12.320
can't use tag teams and it's

02:35:12.320 --> 02:35:14.320
just not that great.

02:35:14.320 --> 02:35:16.320
And also online, not too many people

02:35:16.320 --> 02:35:18.320
playing for reasons that you could probably

02:35:18.320 --> 02:35:20.320
guess, but other than that

02:35:20.320 --> 02:35:22.320
it's the same game.

02:35:22.320 --> 02:35:24.320
Alright, well I haven't

02:35:24.320 --> 02:35:26.320
played a lot of Tekken in a while, so maybe I should

02:35:26.320 --> 02:35:28.320
maybe I should rent

02:35:28.320 --> 02:35:30.320
Tekken on Nintendo Wii U since my Wii

02:35:30.320 --> 02:35:32.320
will allow me to do that.

02:35:32.320 --> 02:35:34.320
The actual last one that I

02:35:34.320 --> 02:35:36.320
bought was Tekken 4. I am warning you though

02:35:36.320 --> 02:35:38.320
Tekken has gotten extremely complex

02:35:38.320 --> 02:35:40.320
over the years, so

02:35:40.320 --> 02:35:42.320
the learning curve is as steep now

02:35:42.320 --> 02:35:44.320
as it ever was, or possibly

02:35:44.320 --> 02:35:46.320
steeper. So as long as you're okay with that

02:35:46.320 --> 02:35:48.320
you know, enjoy. Enjoy your

02:35:48.320 --> 02:35:50.320
rental that you can actually do.

02:35:50.320 --> 02:35:52.320
Alright, well alright, take care buddy, I'm gonna

02:35:52.320 --> 02:35:54.320
let you go to see if we can get one more call, but

02:35:54.320 --> 02:35:56.320
enjoy all the E3 stuff this week and

02:35:56.320 --> 02:35:58.320
we'll talk to you later.

02:35:58.320 --> 02:36:00.320
Well we'll either enjoy it or not enjoy it,

02:36:00.320 --> 02:36:02.320
one of those. That's true, this is the first

02:36:02.320 --> 02:36:04.320
Alright, you too.

02:36:04.320 --> 02:36:06.320
This is the first year where

02:36:06.320 --> 02:36:08.320
we can't necessarily say we're gonna enjoy it, are we?

02:36:08.320 --> 02:36:10.320
Alright, 1877 game

02:36:10.320 --> 02:36:12.320
OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio

02:36:12.320 --> 02:36:14.320
We got time for about one more call here

02:36:14.320 --> 02:36:16.320
Any last minute stories

02:36:16.320 --> 02:36:18.320
while we're waiting for calls?

02:36:18.320 --> 02:36:20.320
Yes, actually I do have one.

02:36:20.320 --> 02:36:22.320
It's a hack that was done

02:36:22.320 --> 02:36:24.320
for New Super Mario Brothers

02:36:24.320 --> 02:36:26.320
on the Wii

02:36:26.320 --> 02:36:28.320
and it's just been released. It's a total

02:36:28.320 --> 02:36:30.320
conversion for the game called Newer Super Mario

02:36:30.320 --> 02:36:32.320
Brothers. 120 all new

02:36:32.320 --> 02:36:34.320
levels, remixed and original

02:36:34.320 --> 02:36:36.320
graphics to the game, themes

02:36:36.320 --> 02:36:38.320
and music, classic

02:36:38.320 --> 02:36:40.320
power-ups, also

02:36:40.320 --> 02:36:42.320
new bosses and that kind of stuff

02:36:42.320 --> 02:36:44.320
and you can get it if you have a

02:36:44.320 --> 02:36:46.320
homebrew-enabled Wii.

02:36:46.320 --> 02:36:48.320
There's no piracy or hardware mods

02:36:48.320 --> 02:36:50.320
needed, so

02:36:50.320 --> 02:36:52.320
I believe it's just a save

02:36:52.320 --> 02:36:54.320
file that you put on there

02:36:54.320 --> 02:36:56.320
and you can download that at

02:36:56.320 --> 02:36:58.320
NewerTeam.com

02:36:58.320 --> 02:37:00.320
That's where you can find that.

02:37:02.320 --> 02:37:04.320
Is that it? I'm trying to pull up

02:37:04.320 --> 02:37:06.320
Twitter here. I've been looking at the

02:37:06.320 --> 02:37:08.320
Xbox 720 checkpoint

02:37:08.320 --> 02:37:10.320
thing that came out last year. Remember the whole

02:37:10.320 --> 02:37:12.320
leak about VR and stuff

02:37:12.320 --> 02:37:14.320
and a lot of it sounds exactly

02:37:14.320 --> 02:37:16.320
what they're talking about right now, so who knows?

02:37:16.320 --> 02:37:18.320
Next year maybe we might see some sort of Xbox

02:37:18.320 --> 02:37:20.320
glasses or something.

02:37:20.320 --> 02:37:22.320
Straight up even to the

02:37:24.320 --> 02:37:26.320
slogan

02:37:26.320 --> 02:37:28.320
that makes no fucking sense.

02:37:28.320 --> 02:37:30.320
Next Generation Entertainment, one box

02:37:30.320 --> 02:37:32.320
input one.

02:37:32.320 --> 02:37:34.320
Like why

02:37:34.320 --> 02:37:36.320
would you even do that?

02:37:36.320 --> 02:37:38.320
I don't know.

02:37:38.320 --> 02:37:40.320
Alright.

02:37:40.320 --> 02:37:42.320
Let's take another call.

02:37:42.320 --> 02:37:44.320
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:37:46.320 --> 02:37:48.320
Hi, this is Raginator.

02:37:48.320 --> 02:37:50.320
Hey Raginator. I was going to say I didn't see the

02:37:50.320 --> 02:37:52.320
cam come on at first. There it is. What's up

02:37:52.320 --> 02:37:54.320
Raginator?

02:37:54.320 --> 02:37:56.320
Just a quick question.

02:37:56.320 --> 02:37:58.320
It's kind of a loaded one.

02:37:58.320 --> 02:38:00.320
You kind of touched

02:38:00.320 --> 02:38:02.320
on something I'll be briefly

02:38:02.320 --> 02:38:04.320
earlier during the show.

02:38:04.320 --> 02:38:06.320
Rare is

02:38:06.320 --> 02:38:08.320
kind of hinted that

02:38:08.320 --> 02:38:10.320
they're working on something and everyone's

02:38:10.320 --> 02:38:12.320
speculating their

02:38:12.320 --> 02:38:14.320
necessity to all franchise.

02:38:14.320 --> 02:38:16.320
Most people seem to think

02:38:16.320 --> 02:38:18.320
it's going to be either Conquer or

02:38:18.320 --> 02:38:20.320
Kill Instinct. What are

02:38:20.320 --> 02:38:22.320
your thoughts on that?

02:38:22.320 --> 02:38:24.320
Well

02:38:24.320 --> 02:38:26.320
we had a screenshot that was leaked

02:38:26.320 --> 02:38:28.320
but again

02:38:28.320 --> 02:38:30.320
it's one of those anybody could have with a

02:38:30.320 --> 02:38:32.320
Photoshop. Oh did they prove it fake?

02:38:32.320 --> 02:38:34.320
Yeah. Proved it fake?

02:38:34.320 --> 02:38:36.320
You're talking about the one that had like Banjo-Kazooie

02:38:36.320 --> 02:38:38.320
Yeah it was fake because they had

02:38:38.320 --> 02:38:40.320
that Microsoft

02:38:40.320 --> 02:38:42.320
game. The Halo

02:38:42.320 --> 02:38:44.320
Spartan

02:38:44.320 --> 02:38:46.320
Assault or whatever but the logo was different.

02:38:46.320 --> 02:38:48.320
And it's because that stuff that

02:38:48.320 --> 02:38:50.320
they got on there was either

02:38:50.320 --> 02:38:52.320
wishful thinking and trademarks that they had

02:38:52.320 --> 02:38:54.320
already done.

02:38:54.320 --> 02:38:56.320
It wasn't anything new. It was fake.

02:38:56.320 --> 02:38:58.320
So it's not

02:38:58.320 --> 02:39:00.320
it's not going to be Banjo-Kazooie. I don't think it would be

02:39:00.320 --> 02:39:02.320
Banjo-Kazooie anyways because it wouldn't be that big a deal.

02:39:02.320 --> 02:39:04.320
It would be just kind of like ehhhh

02:39:04.320 --> 02:39:06.320
whatever because they had a new Banjo game and it was

02:39:06.320 --> 02:39:08.320
just it was alright but

02:39:08.320 --> 02:39:10.320
I'm going to go with the easy answer

02:39:10.320 --> 02:39:12.320
and say Killer Instinct based off

02:39:12.320 --> 02:39:14.320
the whole trademark dispute that they

02:39:14.320 --> 02:39:16.320
got settled. There wouldn't have

02:39:16.320 --> 02:39:18.320
been a reason to do that otherwise I don't think

02:39:18.320 --> 02:39:20.320
if they didn't want to keep that door open for some reason.

02:39:20.320 --> 02:39:22.320
And I think they know that's what

02:39:22.320 --> 02:39:24.320
everybody wants and

02:39:24.320 --> 02:39:26.320
especially with where they're going with all this

02:39:26.320 --> 02:39:28.320
DRM debacle

02:39:28.320 --> 02:39:30.320
it's going to take a franchise like that

02:39:30.320 --> 02:39:32.320
to make people

02:39:32.320 --> 02:39:34.320
what's it going to take for you to sell your morals

02:39:34.320 --> 02:39:36.320
up the river? Essentially.

02:39:36.320 --> 02:39:38.320
And I mean

02:39:38.320 --> 02:39:40.320
honestly if Xbox could come out

02:39:40.320 --> 02:39:42.320
and say you know what we're going to have

02:39:42.320 --> 02:39:44.320
we're going to have Rob's Fantasy games

02:39:44.320 --> 02:39:46.320
Mass Effect 4

02:39:46.320 --> 02:39:48.320
The Guardian Legend 2 and the things I

02:39:48.320 --> 02:39:50.320
want to see it's going to be hard for me

02:39:50.320 --> 02:39:52.320
to even go God I fucking

02:39:52.320 --> 02:39:54.320
hate what they're doing but I really really really

02:39:54.320 --> 02:39:56.320
want these games it's going to be hard it's easy for

02:39:56.320 --> 02:39:58.320
me to sit here now and go I don't

02:39:58.320 --> 02:40:00.320
need Halo 5

02:40:00.320 --> 02:40:02.320
I don't need a new Killer Instinct

02:40:02.320 --> 02:40:04.320
I don't need some of

02:40:04.320 --> 02:40:06.320
this other stuff they're talking about because

02:40:06.320 --> 02:40:08.320
I can kind of be satisfied with Playstation 4

02:40:08.320 --> 02:40:10.320
Well and technically we don't need any of it

02:40:10.320 --> 02:40:12.320
we need air and water

02:40:12.320 --> 02:40:14.320
No I need Guardian Legend 2

02:40:14.320 --> 02:40:16.320
Jamie I need it. Rob

02:40:16.320 --> 02:40:18.320
I need it. Rob. I need it!

02:40:18.320 --> 02:40:20.320
Intervention! What about you Jamie?

02:40:20.320 --> 02:40:22.320
What? A rare franchise

02:40:22.320 --> 02:40:24.320
that's coming back

02:40:24.320 --> 02:40:26.320
Killer Instinct?

02:40:26.320 --> 02:40:28.320
How about you Raginator?

02:40:28.320 --> 02:40:30.320
Well I

02:40:30.320 --> 02:40:32.320
would love to see another Killer

02:40:32.320 --> 02:40:34.320
Instinct. God only knows

02:40:34.320 --> 02:40:36.320
I played the Jesus out

02:40:36.320 --> 02:40:38.320
of the

02:40:38.320 --> 02:40:40.320
SNES port

02:40:40.320 --> 02:40:42.320
along with the

02:40:42.320 --> 02:40:44.320
N64 game

02:40:44.320 --> 02:40:46.320
but I'm a little concerned because

02:40:46.320 --> 02:40:48.320
you know

02:40:48.320 --> 02:40:50.320
the history has shown that

02:40:50.320 --> 02:40:52.320
both first priorities and

02:40:52.320 --> 02:40:54.320
third priorities tend to

02:40:54.320 --> 02:40:56.320
really

02:40:56.320 --> 02:40:58.320
go overboard

02:40:58.320 --> 02:41:00.320
screw with

02:41:00.320 --> 02:41:02.320
a proven formula

02:41:02.320 --> 02:41:04.320
and

02:41:04.320 --> 02:41:06.320
when

02:41:06.320 --> 02:41:08.320
they screw with

02:41:08.320 --> 02:41:10.320
a given formula that's proven

02:41:10.320 --> 02:41:12.320
to be a winner

02:41:12.320 --> 02:41:14.320
a lot of people tend to revolve

02:41:14.320 --> 02:41:16.320
Case is a point

02:41:16.320 --> 02:41:18.320
Capcom screwed with

02:41:18.320 --> 02:41:20.320
you know

02:41:20.320 --> 02:41:22.320
the Final Fight with

02:41:22.320 --> 02:41:24.320
Streetwise for the PS2

02:41:24.320 --> 02:41:26.320
turned the 2D

02:41:26.320 --> 02:41:28.320
brawler into a 3D brawler

02:41:28.320 --> 02:41:30.320
that didn't do too well

02:41:30.320 --> 02:41:32.320
they also

02:41:32.320 --> 02:41:34.320
screwed with Street Fighter

02:41:34.320 --> 02:41:36.320
and came out with the

02:41:36.320 --> 02:41:38.320
EX series

02:41:38.320 --> 02:41:40.320
didn't do too well

02:41:40.320 --> 02:41:42.320
and of course there was

02:41:42.320 --> 02:41:44.320
a whole

02:41:44.320 --> 02:41:46.320
more common port on the

02:41:46.320 --> 02:41:48.320
SNES which

02:41:48.320 --> 02:41:50.320
still gets kind of

02:41:50.320 --> 02:41:52.320
paid today

02:41:52.320 --> 02:41:54.320
In defense of the Street Fighter

02:41:54.320 --> 02:41:56.320
EX series EX3 was pretty good

02:41:56.320 --> 02:41:58.320
I want to say with Capcom too since you brought up

02:41:58.320 --> 02:42:00.320
Mega Man I think there's a very strong possibility

02:42:00.320 --> 02:42:02.320
Mega Man fans will finally have something

02:42:02.320 --> 02:42:04.320
to celebrate this week I don't know if that'll

02:42:04.320 --> 02:42:06.320
just be a little victory or something but I just

02:42:06.320 --> 02:42:08.320
think the timing is right

02:42:08.320 --> 02:42:10.320
for Capcom to unveil what

02:42:10.320 --> 02:42:12.320
they're going to do with Mega Man since they pretty much

02:42:12.320 --> 02:42:14.320
said they're not killing them off

02:42:14.320 --> 02:42:16.320
so whether that be a

02:42:16.320 --> 02:42:18.320
reboot of Legends 3 or whatever

02:42:18.320 --> 02:42:20.320
Mega Man 11 for god's

02:42:20.320 --> 02:42:22.320
sake whatever they're doing I think next week

02:42:22.320 --> 02:42:24.320
is very good for that but

02:42:24.320 --> 02:42:26.320
you know that's an easy thing to predict

02:42:26.320 --> 02:42:28.320
but we'll see if it actually happens

02:42:28.320 --> 02:42:30.320
Well ultimately

02:42:30.320 --> 02:42:32.320
if they do make a

02:42:32.320 --> 02:42:34.320
killer receipt

02:42:34.320 --> 02:42:36.320
I would love to see it

02:42:36.320 --> 02:42:38.320
just don't screw it up

02:42:38.320 --> 02:42:40.320
make minor tweaks here and there

02:42:40.320 --> 02:42:42.320
maybe add new characters

02:42:42.320 --> 02:42:44.320
maybe a mechanic

02:42:44.320 --> 02:42:46.320
here or there

02:42:46.320 --> 02:42:48.320
but don't go radically changing

02:42:48.320 --> 02:42:50.320
the game to the point where

02:42:50.320 --> 02:42:52.320
it's basically

02:42:52.320 --> 02:42:54.320
a totally different game

02:42:54.320 --> 02:42:56.320
it's only related to

02:42:56.320 --> 02:42:58.320
previous games by name only

02:42:58.320 --> 02:43:00.320
Alright

02:43:00.320 --> 02:43:02.320
Well Raginator before I let you go here tonight I

02:43:02.320 --> 02:43:04.320
noticed that you also submitted a tweet to us

02:43:04.320 --> 02:43:06.320
at twitter.com slash o-l-r so

02:43:06.320 --> 02:43:08.320
allow me to read

02:43:08.320 --> 02:43:10.320
Random question

02:43:10.320 --> 02:43:12.320
when playing Gyruss how many warps are there

02:43:12.320 --> 02:43:14.320
to Uranus? I'm not going to say it

02:43:14.320 --> 02:43:16.320
the other way. I asked because I just

02:43:16.320 --> 02:43:18.320
wanted to type Uranus

02:43:18.320 --> 02:43:20.320
well there you go and now I read it

02:43:20.320 --> 02:43:22.320
there on air so congratulations

02:43:22.320 --> 02:43:24.320
and if I remember right it would be 3 warps

02:43:24.320 --> 02:43:26.320
to Neptune and then 3 more

02:43:26.320 --> 02:43:28.320
to Uranus

02:43:28.320 --> 02:43:30.320
6 warps

02:43:30.320 --> 02:43:32.320
to Uranus Raginator

02:43:32.320 --> 02:43:34.320
Yeah I know it's

02:43:34.320 --> 02:43:36.320
I came up with something

02:43:36.320 --> 02:43:38.320
It's alright, so's the show

02:43:38.320 --> 02:43:40.320
so's the show Raginator

02:43:40.320 --> 02:43:42.320
Alright have a good one buddy

02:43:42.320 --> 02:43:44.320
Alright bye

02:43:44.320 --> 02:43:46.320
I feel like that's like

02:43:46.320 --> 02:43:48.320
wishing people a Merry Christmas

02:43:48.320 --> 02:43:50.320
or Happy Hanukkah

02:43:50.320 --> 02:43:52.320
I feel like you should wish video gamers a Happy E3

02:43:52.320 --> 02:43:54.320
even when E3 is going to be bad news

02:43:54.320 --> 02:43:56.320
like it's just like people fight

02:43:56.320 --> 02:43:58.320
May you not be as disappointed

02:43:58.320 --> 02:44:00.320
this year as you were last

02:44:00.320 --> 02:44:02.320
What should like Happy E3

02:44:02.320 --> 02:44:04.320
Merry E3

02:44:04.320 --> 02:44:06.320
You're E3, what should the

02:44:06.320 --> 02:44:08.320
greeting be to other gamers

02:44:08.320 --> 02:44:10.320
this time of year?

02:44:10.320 --> 02:44:12.320
Dark Soccer you're

02:44:12.320 --> 02:44:14.320
Here's a hanky

02:44:14.320 --> 02:44:16.320
You're our linguist

02:44:16.320 --> 02:44:18.320
What should the greeting be to other gamers?

02:44:18.320 --> 02:44:20.320
Blessed E3

02:44:20.320 --> 02:44:22.320
That might be a little too much

02:44:22.320 --> 02:44:24.320
Blessed E3

02:44:24.320 --> 02:44:26.320
How about

02:44:26.320 --> 02:44:28.320
How about Wink Free E3

02:44:28.320 --> 02:44:30.320
Alright maybe I'll

02:44:30.320 --> 02:44:32.320
throw that question to the chatters and see what they come up with

02:44:32.320 --> 02:44:34.320
but for now I am going to close the Skype line

02:44:34.320 --> 02:44:36.320
if you do have further thoughts on any of tonight's topics

02:44:36.320 --> 02:44:38.320
Mailbag out

02:44:38.320 --> 02:44:40.320
OrangeLaunchRadio.com

02:44:40.320 --> 02:44:42.320
or Twitter.com slash O-L-R

02:44:42.320 --> 02:44:44.320
So a screenshot leaked

02:44:44.320 --> 02:44:46.320
from a brand new unannounced game

02:44:46.320 --> 02:44:48.320
Oh

02:44:48.320 --> 02:44:50.320
It's assumed, well we kind of assumed it was coming

02:44:50.320 --> 02:44:52.320
Just Dance

02:44:52.320 --> 02:44:54.320
the new Just Dance game

02:44:54.320 --> 02:44:56.320
It's going to have the Ghostbusters theme in it because they have a screenshot

02:44:56.320 --> 02:44:58.320
where people are dressed up like Ghostbusters

02:44:58.320 --> 02:45:00.320
That's in Just Dance 4

02:45:00.320 --> 02:45:02.320
Isn't it?

02:45:02.320 --> 02:45:04.320
You sure about that?

02:45:06.320 --> 02:45:08.320
Rob is up going to look by the way

02:45:12.320 --> 02:45:14.320
Now in the chatroom by the way

02:45:14.320 --> 02:45:16.320
we have a call for a new

02:45:16.320 --> 02:45:18.320
Rival Schools series

02:45:18.320 --> 02:45:20.320
Okay what are you looking at?

02:45:20.320 --> 02:45:22.320
Just Dance 4

02:45:22.320 --> 02:45:24.320
He's reading

02:45:24.320 --> 02:45:26.320
It's going to take us a while because Rob's reading

02:45:26.320 --> 02:45:28.320
Just kidding

02:45:28.320 --> 02:45:30.320
I'm sorry Y-Y-R

02:45:30.320 --> 02:45:32.320
I can't click YouTube

02:45:32.320 --> 02:45:34.320
Maybe not

02:45:34.320 --> 02:45:36.320
It's official because it's actually on

02:45:36.320 --> 02:45:38.320
Xbox's website

02:45:38.320 --> 02:45:40.320
So if you go to Xbox's Just Dance 2014

02:45:40.320 --> 02:45:42.320
and they've got

02:45:42.320 --> 02:45:44.320
Well I mean what a duh

02:45:44.320 --> 02:45:46.320
They're going to do a new Just Dance game

02:45:46.320 --> 02:45:48.320
I mean come on these games sell like crazy

02:45:48.320 --> 02:45:50.320
and it's not a bad game

02:45:50.320 --> 02:45:52.320
They have a guy that looks like Beetlejuice in here

02:45:52.320 --> 02:45:54.320
What?

02:45:54.320 --> 02:45:56.320
I mean that looks like Beetlejuice

02:45:56.320 --> 02:45:58.320
I'm assuming that maybe that's

02:45:58.320 --> 02:46:00.320
A ghost

02:46:00.320 --> 02:46:02.320
Alright as far as the E3

02:46:02.320 --> 02:46:04.320
greetings in our chatroom Misty says

02:46:04.320 --> 02:46:06.320
Happy E3 I would think

02:46:06.320 --> 02:46:08.320
Let's keep it simple why over think it

02:46:08.320 --> 02:46:10.320
Maybe be Happy E3 Happy E3

02:46:10.320 --> 02:46:12.320
Happy E3 I like that

02:46:12.320 --> 02:46:14.320
Alright a couple of tweets from TigerClaw

02:46:14.320 --> 02:46:16.320
I apologize

02:46:16.320 --> 02:46:18.320
I don't think you read this one yet but I know it was in the

02:46:18.320 --> 02:46:20.320
list of stories we just didn't get to it tonight

02:46:20.320 --> 02:46:22.320
TigerClaw talking about

02:46:22.320 --> 02:46:24.320
Mad Catz readying an Android console

02:46:24.320 --> 02:46:26.320
of their own. Is this like an Ouya

02:46:26.320 --> 02:46:28.320
type response? No they are yeah

02:46:28.320 --> 02:46:30.320
It's not like the Ouya

02:46:30.320 --> 02:46:32.320
Actually I like the idea

02:46:32.320 --> 02:46:34.320
a lot better than the Ouya

02:46:34.320 --> 02:46:36.320
It's basically going to be a console that plays

02:46:36.320 --> 02:46:38.320
Android games. It has the Google Play

02:46:38.320 --> 02:46:40.320
Store and it plays any Android game

02:46:40.320 --> 02:46:42.320
and you can actually map buttons

02:46:42.320 --> 02:46:44.320
onto stuff

02:46:44.320 --> 02:46:46.320
So games that don't support touch or whatever

02:46:46.320 --> 02:46:48.320
you can use a mouse with them

02:46:48.320 --> 02:46:50.320
or do support touch

02:46:50.320 --> 02:46:52.320
you can use a mouse or you can use analog sticks

02:46:52.320 --> 02:46:54.320
to emulate touch

02:46:54.320 --> 02:46:56.320
but

02:46:56.320 --> 02:46:58.320
the fact that it doesn't require any special

02:46:58.320 --> 02:47:00.320
games it's just the games that you have

02:47:00.320 --> 02:47:02.320
or the games that you buy for like a dollar

02:47:02.320 --> 02:47:04.320
or free or whatever so I like that

02:47:04.320 --> 02:47:06.320
and their controller looks nice too

02:47:06.320 --> 02:47:08.320
it looks like an Xbox 360 controller

02:47:08.320 --> 02:47:10.320
actually it looks exactly like their

02:47:10.320 --> 02:47:12.320
their Xbox 360 controller

02:47:12.320 --> 02:47:14.320
their

02:47:14.320 --> 02:47:16.320
MLG controller

02:47:16.320 --> 02:47:18.320
it looks exactly like that

02:47:18.320 --> 02:47:20.320
and one other tweet from TigerClaw tonight about

02:47:20.320 --> 02:47:22.320
Interplay getting an IP from THQ

02:47:22.320 --> 02:47:24.320
for $7,500

02:47:24.320 --> 02:47:26.320
that's how much they

02:47:26.320 --> 02:47:28.320
paid for FreeSpace

02:47:28.320 --> 02:47:30.320
that's a good deal

02:47:30.320 --> 02:47:32.320
that's a great deal

02:47:32.320 --> 02:47:34.320
Interstellar Combat series that was developed by

02:47:34.320 --> 02:47:36.320
Volition and published by Interplay

02:47:36.320 --> 02:47:38.320
it's back in Interplay's library

02:47:38.320 --> 02:47:40.320
after getting it back from THQ

02:47:40.320 --> 02:47:42.320
so there you go

02:47:42.320 --> 02:47:44.320
Interplay by the way it should be noted

02:47:44.320 --> 02:47:46.320
they never did lose the rights to sell

02:47:46.320 --> 02:47:48.320
Descent FreeSpace and FreeSpace 2

02:47:48.320 --> 02:47:50.320
there you go

02:47:50.320 --> 02:47:52.320
I want another Descent that is awesome

02:47:52.320 --> 02:47:54.320
that required more buttons than

02:47:54.320 --> 02:47:56.320
the other Descent games

02:47:56.320 --> 02:47:58.320
that would be awesome

02:47:58.320 --> 02:48:00.320
that required telekinesis to play

02:48:00.320 --> 02:48:02.320
alright well thank you guys very much for your tweets

02:48:02.320 --> 02:48:04.320
at twitter.com slash o-l-r

02:48:04.320 --> 02:48:06.320
lots of great stuff tonight but

02:48:06.320 --> 02:48:08.320
it's about that time we gotta wrap up the show

02:48:08.320 --> 02:48:10.320
and get everybody's final thought

02:48:10.320 --> 02:48:12.320
and all that

02:48:12.320 --> 02:48:14.320
we have a consensus in the chat room, Rival Schools is awesome

02:48:14.320 --> 02:48:16.320
Rival Schools is awesome

02:48:16.320 --> 02:48:18.320
we'll put that on your list list, too late

02:48:18.320 --> 02:48:20.320
well, okay, you know what

02:48:22.320 --> 02:48:24.320
I actually, when I had

02:48:24.320 --> 02:48:26.320
a lot more disposable income I paid

02:48:26.320 --> 02:48:28.320
99 bucks to import

02:48:28.320 --> 02:48:30.320
the Justice Gakuen Evolution

02:48:30.320 --> 02:48:32.320
and I played the hell out of it

02:48:32.320 --> 02:48:34.320
for days, but it's like

02:48:34.320 --> 02:48:36.320
every time they would bring out

02:48:36.320 --> 02:48:38.320
like one of the games for home they'd take out

02:48:38.320 --> 02:48:40.320
something from the Japanese version that made it awesome

02:48:40.320 --> 02:48:42.320
like the board game mode

02:48:42.320 --> 02:48:44.320
in Project Justice

02:48:44.320 --> 02:48:46.320
after you played through the board game

02:48:46.320 --> 02:48:48.320
your custom character

02:48:48.320 --> 02:48:50.320
that you played the board game with would have stats

02:48:50.320 --> 02:48:52.320
based on how you played the game

02:48:52.320 --> 02:48:54.320
and they just took that out

02:48:54.320 --> 02:48:56.320
well guys

02:48:56.320 --> 02:48:58.320
before I let you go tonight I just want to say

02:48:58.320 --> 02:49:00.320
happy three and let's hope that

02:49:00.320 --> 02:49:02.320
let's hope the news isn't too terrible

02:49:02.320 --> 02:49:04.320
let's hope there's a lot of good surprises and things

02:49:04.320 --> 02:49:06.320
that we will be excited about

02:49:06.320 --> 02:49:08.320
I will be here during the day tomorrow

02:49:08.320 --> 02:49:10.320
during the press conferences and I'll be around Tuesday too

02:49:10.320 --> 02:49:12.320
I will make a point to be in chat

02:49:12.320 --> 02:49:14.320
if you want some folks to talk

02:49:14.320 --> 02:49:16.320
about the conferences, you want a live

02:49:16.320 --> 02:49:18.320
blog, not really live blogging

02:49:18.320 --> 02:49:20.320
because I kind of think everybody's

02:49:20.320 --> 02:49:22.320
kind of watching it, but more like live discussion

02:49:22.320 --> 02:49:24.320
if you want to talk about what's going on

02:49:24.320 --> 02:49:26.320
at E3 with some like-minded individuals

02:49:26.320 --> 02:49:28.320
I urge you to be at live.vognetwork.com

02:49:28.320 --> 02:49:30.320
I'll be there during the big press conferences

02:49:30.320 --> 02:49:32.320
tomorrow and we can talk

02:49:32.320 --> 02:49:34.320
about it and kind of discuss

02:49:34.320 --> 02:49:36.320
are you going to be there too?

02:49:36.320 --> 02:49:38.320
Yes, because my boss is gone

02:49:38.320 --> 02:49:40.320
so I don't have to really work that

02:49:40.320 --> 02:49:42.320
it's all work related anyways, come on

02:49:42.320 --> 02:49:44.320
I'll be there at least for Microsoft and Sony

02:49:44.320 --> 02:49:46.320
but in the middle of the day Dark Soccer and I might go on a friend date

02:49:46.320 --> 02:49:48.320
to take care of some stuff around town

02:49:48.320 --> 02:49:50.320
YYR left another haiku

02:49:50.320 --> 02:49:52.320
Happy E3 guys, look forward to

02:49:52.320 --> 02:49:54.320
no prices and no dates either

02:49:54.320 --> 02:49:56.320
I think we'll get those tomorrow

02:49:56.320 --> 02:49:58.320
I think we'll get prices and dates tomorrow

02:49:58.320 --> 02:50:00.320
I don't know

02:50:00.320 --> 02:50:02.320
It would be a first if we did, because remember

02:50:02.320 --> 02:50:04.320
what was the infamous thing a few years ago from Sony

02:50:04.320 --> 02:50:06.320
$599 US dollars

02:50:06.320 --> 02:50:08.320
$599, so I think we will get it

02:50:08.320 --> 02:50:10.320
I'll wake up tomorrow

02:50:10.320 --> 02:50:12.320
to care about the press releases

02:50:12.320 --> 02:50:14.320
to get in chat as well

02:50:14.320 --> 02:50:16.320
I've already got my popcorn

02:50:16.320 --> 02:50:18.320
it's just stale, but I already have my popcorn

02:50:18.320 --> 02:50:20.320
I want to go to Popcornopolis

02:50:20.320 --> 02:50:22.320
If you want a place to just chat with some other folks

02:50:22.320 --> 02:50:24.320
and kind of just

02:50:24.320 --> 02:50:26.320
get some live

02:50:26.320 --> 02:50:28.320
banter going on what's going on at E3

02:50:28.320 --> 02:50:30.320
join us and chat

02:50:30.320 --> 02:50:32.320
live.vognetwork.com

02:50:32.320 --> 02:50:34.320
You never know, Bobby might pop in on a plane for all we know

02:50:34.320 --> 02:50:36.320
from his plane, we'll see

02:50:36.320 --> 02:50:38.320
Check out E3.vognetwork.com

02:50:38.320 --> 02:50:40.320
I'm really excited about what this week

02:50:40.320 --> 02:50:42.320
is going to bring and it's going to be

02:50:42.320 --> 02:50:44.320
a great week

02:50:44.320 --> 02:50:46.320
I guess that's it

02:50:46.320 --> 02:50:48.320
We'll be back next week to do it all over

02:50:48.320 --> 02:50:50.320
again as we lead up to our 11th anniversary

02:50:50.320 --> 02:50:52.320
on June 23rd

02:50:52.320 --> 02:50:54.320
It's time to go around and get everybody's final thought

02:50:54.320 --> 02:50:56.320
Dark Sakura, we'll start with you tonight

02:50:56.320 --> 02:50:58.320
your final thought

02:50:58.320 --> 02:51:00.320
I wish I hadn't eaten all that chocolate so quickly

02:51:00.320 --> 02:51:02.320
And my final thought tonight

02:51:02.320 --> 02:51:04.320
is no regrets, I did eat it that quickly

02:51:04.320 --> 02:51:06.320
and it was good

02:51:06.320 --> 02:51:08.320
Loki, your final thought tonight

02:51:08.320 --> 02:51:10.320
I'm looking forward to this week, I'm always excited about

02:51:10.320 --> 02:51:12.320
E3 stuff, just disappointed that I don't get to play

02:51:12.320 --> 02:51:14.320
and also I'm not going to be able to make it out to Best Buy

02:51:14.320 --> 02:51:16.320
and Wednesday to play the Wii U games

02:51:16.320 --> 02:51:18.320
because it's not a weird time, it's like a 4 o'clock

02:51:18.320 --> 02:51:20.320
like if it was in the middle of the day I could sneak out

02:51:20.320 --> 02:51:22.320
and do that, but the middle of the day one's on

02:51:22.320 --> 02:51:24.320
Saturday and I'm just, I'm not going to drive

02:51:24.320 --> 02:51:26.320
all the way to Elk Grove

02:51:26.320 --> 02:51:28.320
No, then I'm not going to drive down the Elk Grove

02:51:28.320 --> 02:51:30.320
to play New Super League

02:51:30.320 --> 02:51:32.320
What if our local listeners wanted to meet you?

02:51:33.320 --> 02:51:35.320
Eh, it's not worth it, seriously

02:51:35.320 --> 02:51:37.320
Alright, fair enough

02:51:37.320 --> 02:51:39.320
Thank you guys for listening to

02:51:39.320 --> 02:51:41.320
Orange Launch Radio and supporting us

02:51:41.320 --> 02:51:43.320
for all these years

02:51:43.320 --> 02:51:45.320
We really appreciate your support

02:51:45.320 --> 02:51:47.320
It is a free show, all we ask if you enjoyed the show

02:51:47.320 --> 02:51:49.320
Tell a friend or two about the show

02:51:49.320 --> 02:51:51.320
Help us spread the word, because we don't get a big

02:51:51.320 --> 02:51:53.320
booth at E3 to help spread the word

02:51:53.320 --> 02:51:55.320
or any big fancy advertising budget

02:51:55.320 --> 02:51:57.320
Any advertising you do see

02:51:57.320 --> 02:51:59.320
comes out of our own pockets

02:51:59.320 --> 02:52:01.320
So please, help spread the word

02:52:01.320 --> 02:52:03.320
and grow our family here at Orange Lounge Radio

02:52:03.320 --> 02:52:05.320
and the Voice of Geeks Network

02:52:05.320 --> 02:52:07.320
Support independent podcasting

02:52:07.320 --> 02:52:09.320
Have a terrific week, good night

02:52:31.320 --> 02:52:33.320
You may not necessarily reflect

02:52:33.320 --> 02:52:35.320
those of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio

02:52:35.320 --> 02:52:37.320
or VOG Network

02:52:37.320 --> 02:52:39.320
but you know they were all still true

02:52:39.320 --> 02:52:41.320
See you next week

02:53:01.320 --> 02:53:03.320
Thanks for watching!
