14877	19020	Microsoft sets a date to announce their next move.
19320	21382	More video games are set to become movies.
21722	23723	And can you really get pizza delivered with your 360?
31943	37667	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
37727	40069	It's the show where every gamer has a voice.
40729	47554	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you to talk about video games and gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle over the next few hours with my co-hosts.
47734	50776	First off, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
51036	51557	Hello.
51837	52717	How are you, Jamie Summers?
53798	54178	Sated.
55379	56780	Sated or satiated?
56800	57721	Sated.
57961	59602	Because you did have pizza.
60262	61683	But wouldn't that be... Oh, whatever.
62004	62304	All right.
63745	65366	Grammar specifics aside.
66546	69568	And just to tell Prince Brightstar, I've been playing PSO2.
70829	72710	What did he ask?
72790	73210	I missed it.
73290	76953	Well, he mentioned Phantasy Star Online, too, so I was just affirming that, yes, I did get everything to work.
77553	79434	Awesome.
79494	80835	Was that with all the patches and all that stuff?
81184	86405	Yes, but I have to repatch my game and redo the translations and blah, and I've had other stuff to play.
87685	89746	Alright, also say hello to Tech Master Loki.
90266	90526	Hi.
90766	91346	How are you, Loki?
91646	92126	Doing good.
92326	92706	Good.
93266	94007	What's new with you?
94387	95207	I'm collecting drugs.
95547	96647	You're collecting drugs?
97307	103128	Well, I'm finishing my pickups on the collectibles in Saints Row the Third.
103969	105249	Ah, I see what you did there.
105309	105629	Okay.
106709	107530	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
130567	143496	Like 98% of you, this is all new Please say hello, everybody, to From the GameBooey.org podcast Say hello to Captain Spike Hi Hi, how are you, Spike?
144196	145557	Doing pretty good, thank you for having me
146005	146926	No problem.
147566	151790	And also joining us in the studio tonight, say hello to Tim.
152290	152670	Hello.
152931	153511	How are you, Tim?
153991	155072	I am quaking in my boots.
155152	156693	This is my first podcast ever.
156814	157374	Is it really?
157654	157874	Yep.
158014	158855	Wow, you're like...
161397	165379	This is also Rob's first podcast.
165799	168520	So, we've stolen your guest virginity.
169400	170121	I suppose so.
170221	171921	I'm a little bit uncomfortable thinking about that.
171961	175423	You even got the little virginity music playing there in the background.
176123	179365	So, yeah, like every idiot has a podcast in this day and age.
179625	184647	No disrespect to those who are doing podcasts, but like Captain Spike, I'm calling myself an idiot.
185007	188308	But no, like, you know, it's so easy to do that these days.
188388	189129	It's really surprising.
189149	189869	You've never done this before.
193376	194697	But we'll be gentle, I promise.
194937	195257	Thank you.
195377	196158	Alright, you're welcome.
197578	198279	Break out the feathers.
198579	204522	So before we get into how was your gaming week and all that, I want to talk to you guys about the things you guys do.
204602	205643	So I'm going to start with Spike.
206103	210226	So a few years ago, I know you came on OLR like seven years ago.
210266	211766	That was back when I lived with Extifer, right?
212447	213267	It sure was, yeah.
213427	214988	Do you remember what we even talked about then?
216189	217470	I have no idea.
217830	218670	How did you and I meet?
219291	219851	Tell the listeners.
220219	220819	The internet.
221520	224942	And then, you know, we were on a message board.
225002	227223	There was an IRL meetup party.
227303	232866	We went to said party independently, got drunk, and smoked cloves outside for like an hour.
233867	234527	Don't smoke, guys.
234647	235107	It's bad for you.
235127	236008	No, smoking is bad.
236028	236588	So we quit.
236648	237229	Okay, I have to ask.
237249	238569	They were the Djarams, right?
238709	239250	Oh, I'm sure.
239610	240090	Oh, death.
240871	241811	Like there's anything other.
244333	245633	So fast forward to today.
245813	247614	You've got your podcast now.
247654	248395	Tell us about Game Boy.
248415	248495	Okay.
250415	253658	I host the Gamebuoy.org video game podcast.
254239	268375	Our sort of aim is just to pick up stories that are getting left off the radar of all the blogs, sort of pick up stories on indies, JRPGs, just sort of niche genres that maybe aren't getting the play that they really deserve in the news.
270143	280773	I joked earlier that any idiot can have a podcast and obviously I'm not being rude with that but it is so easy to do it now but surely you kind of have to take that step like why do I want to do a podcast?
280793	282835	So why Captain Spike did you want to do a podcast?
283618	297249	Well, you know, fitting in with what I just said, it kind of irritates me that, and you know, certainly no offense to any podcast, any podcasters that are listening to this, but I really wanted to cover some bases that I feel like aren't getting a lot of coverage.
297910	298290	That's fair.
298610	306857	Especially, you know, we started Retronauts was sort of kind of going away and we have a real strong retro bent to sort of what we do.
307658	308418	And you didn't need $35,000 to do this.
308458	308879	No tea, no shade.
311115	312596	No, all tea, all shade.
312976	314557	We do it for free.
314697	316058	We spend money on it.
316098	317398	So no, we're not getting paid.
317699	317959	Okay.
318679	320720	But I like that you guys have a niche.
320960	327264	And I've had people ask me before because we have had this podcast a long, long, long, long time.
327544	332406	Sometimes people will ask when they want to get into a podcast like, hey, Rob, how do I start a podcast?
332486	336769	And usually my first thing is, okay, if you're going to start a video game podcast, I'm going to warn you, it's a very â€“
337749	340431	There's a lot of people in this pool, and people have peed in this pool.
340451	343033	Yeah, it's kind of gross.
343053	345194	There's a lot of stuff, but you've got to find your niche.
345375	348096	You've got to be like, how am I going to stand out amongst this?
348136	349798	How am I going to wear the prettiest bathing suit?
350178	351619	It's going to get me noticed, right?
351979	354661	So you guys have your niche, and I think it's fun.
354701	360765	Because you guys don't just talk about under-the-radar news, but I notice you kind of theme a lot of your episodes.
360785	365989	You have your one big topic that keeps a lot of your shows timeless in a way, I noticed.
366009	366129	Yeah.
366297	378664	Well, that was, you know, very much a conscious choice, but we really wanted to have sort of a level of intellectual discourse about sort of these big topics that a lot of people maybe don't talk about and have, you know, real discussions about.
380265	380665	Gotcha.
381225	384307	So it's you and, what do you call him on the show?
384327	384987	I know his real name.
385007	386748	What's his first mate, Slidekick?
386788	389010	That is first mate, Slidekick, yeah.
389110	391171	Yeah, and you guys have been buds forever, right?
391391	394653	I've known that guy for, I don't know, probably 10 years, nearly.
394853	395093	Uh-huh.
395359	399142	Yeah, and Slykick's my frenemy in the WoW podcasting community, so that's always a lot of fun.
399302	403665	Yeah, you all might remember his classic show, Fabulous Flames.
404406	405667	I still have episodes on my phone.
407708	409450	So you were the subscriber!
409470	410410	That was me!
410991	412992	You were their Legion of Fan.
413313	416175	It was when I ran out of history podcasts.
416795	418817	I was like, well, there's always this one.
419217	421179	And I'd sit in my cube snorting the whole time.
422139	423020	People were like, what are you on?
424401	428164	But we didn't come here just to shade, you know, Slidekick because I was in chat and everything.
429485	429985	You're so mean.
431266	433907	So let me talk about you as a gamer.
433948	438370	So obviously you must have been into all the music games and stuff like we were because you were on the show at that time.
440092	441993	How did you get into gaming at all?
442473	443794	How did you start playing video games?
444715	445695	What hooked you into this?
445755	446456	Why are you a gamer?
447376	468060	um why am I a gamer um my mother worked in a bowling alley and they had tons of arcade games so I kind of fell in love with Kung Fu and you know the old Irem game I think it was Irem I don't know and uh after that you know got a Nintendo for the NES port Kung Fu and went from there
469093	469714	Awesome.
469834	471835	What's your favorite video games ever?
471935	474577	What are your favorite things that have ever been done?
475818	477439	Super Mario World and Bayonetta
478748	481050	Bayonetta is one of your top games ever.
481210	487575	I think it has some of the best situational awareness in a 3D action game that I've ever seen.
488036	488696	Interesting.
488896	494521	I really like the way that it visually communicates what it expects of you in terms of reaction and what have you.
494641	497883	Those are not two games you would typically expect to see sitting together.
497983	503047	If I'm going to the video game museum, I'm not going to see Mario World next to Bayonetta.
503067	504248	But no, I think that's great.
504288	506270	A lot of people don't usually dare to name
507010	526049	For all practical purposes, a current game I mean, I know it's a couple years old at this point But a current generation game as a classic But no, I think that's great I think it's super well designed And I think that Super Mario World is certainly the best designed 2D platformer So you must have been excited about Virtual Console this week?
526365	531326	Yeah, the first thing I did was download it and play it until my second player rage quit on me.
532406	534347	Sorry, but Magic Koopa?
534467	535247	No, that is crap.
538247	539928	Gosh, what else do I want to ask you about games?
540948	546029	Okay, Bayonetta 2, then, and this whole it's exclusive for Nintendo.
546529	548210	Where are you at with Nintendo?
548230	549010	Where's your head at?
549050	554651	Because some people are very like, Nintendo sucks, and it's a kiddie thing, and da-da-da-da-da.
555091	557112	But here they are coming out with Bayonetta 2.
557312	558153	Where's your head at with that?
558353	560854	I think they make a lot of really bad business choices.
561615	569720	I think that them paying for Bayonetta 2 to exist is awesome, but probably also a bad business choice.
570660	573302	But it's one I'm certainly going to benefit from, so I'm happy.
575030	601510	Go to our chatroom, we always have the other guests on our show The live chatroom, live.vognetwork.com Because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern Right after the Bobby Blackwolf show And looking at our chatroom, we see some comments such as Let's see, Dungeon Buster says Bayonetta rocks Tiger Claw says Kung Fu was one of those games that were quarter munchers Once you had the NES version, you'd blow right through the entire game
602210	602951	Absolutely true.
603212	603713	That's true.
603933	606938	And then does it lose something, though, once you play it on the console?
607138	609843	Like, can you go back and play it in the arcade now that you've just beat it?
610626	614327	No, but I mean, you know, I didn't really want to either.
614567	621808	I was too busy, you know, taking my picture with my TV and trying to get in to the pages of Nintendo Fun Club, Nintendo Power, you know.
623289	623569	Awesome.
624609	625069	Let's see.
625469	631911	And going to RossDLUT says, Arcade games were nonsensically hard in order to drain quarters.
631971	632531	Of course they were.
633411	634231	I always think of that.
634972	639393	You remember Wayne's World, which turned 20 years old apparently this month?
640033	642474	How old does that make you feel and me feel right now, right?
642534	644434	Hearing that Wayne's World is 20 years old, right?
644894	653197	So there's a scene where they're talking about the arcade, and the guy goes, yeah, we just got this new game, and when you kill the gelatinous cube, you get to go to the next level.
653537	655378	The trick is there is no gelatinous cube.
655418	656158	He never shows up.
657551	661503	and I'm like oh that's like so old arcade machine like I love it.
661604	664793	That's up there with the boss of Carnival being named Token Taker.
668529	697656	uh let's see and um Slagkick in chat uh agreeing with Tim apparently saying Magikoopa is a ratchet hoe there you go thank you Slagkick alright um so if people want to check out your podcast which I do recommend it's a great listen even if you guys are only doing it every other week and I don't know I'd like to see you do it more often but no pressure what's with that what you're being so rude that's a compliment I am a guest no that's a compliment that means I want more of it alright how's that a bad thing
697916	698196	Okay.
698316	698616	All right.
698756	699357	So thank you.
699457	700677	Tell everybody how they can listen to your show.
700737	701858	Good things come to those who wait.
701998	702438	That's true.
703499	707021	You know, the easiest way to hear us is just to go over to GameBooey.org.
707801	710862	But, you know, we're also on iTunes, GameBooey Podcast.
711503	712063	Hard to miss.
713544	715605	And the art actually looks like a little Game Boy.
715925	716685	But Booey.
717025	717426	Get it?
717606	717906	Booey.
719505	719885	It's great.
720065	720426	I like it.
720866	721126	All right.
723268	725229	Oh, let me ask one other question about your podcast.
727190	737097	Since you have a lot of timeless segments, a lot of your shows, you can go back and listen to it now, even though some of the news might be outdated, you've got a good chunk that's timeless.
737557	740299	What do you think is one of your best episodes out of the ones you've done so far?
740419	744462	If I need to go back and find a good conversation, which one would you recommend most?
745276	770044	Okay, so the longest episode we've done so far is that we did sort of a breakdown on the narrative themes and tropes of Bioshock Infinite, a game which, as a game, I was kind of not really super satisfied with, but I thought actually did some interesting things from a storytelling standpoint, which is not something I normally even think about in terms of games.
771505	777994	We talked about that for a couple hours and I was really happy with how it came out despite it being unpleasantly long.
780888	781328	You know what?
781368	784491	This show's really unpleasantly long, most every week, so it's all good.
786513	791757	And we also had a pretty in-depth discussion on LGBT issues in games.
792358	795561	And we're actually going to do a follow-up on that this summer, so I'm very excited.
795861	800445	This is a good part to plug the GamerX panel that is coming up.
801666	804769	GamerX is, what, the first weekend in August in San Francisco, right?
805329	814977	And so a bunch of us are all teaming up to do a panel, but the panels are being voted on right now at GamerConnect.com And our panel is Podcast X Zone, right?
815598	829029	And it's going to be, and I hope I don't miss anybody, it's going to be, I'm representing OLR And we're hopefully getting some folks from Horde House too, and then of course Game Buoy Podcast The Koopa Club guys out of Chicago are coming out, they're going to be there
829629	832651	and Game Bar I think has representation, right?
832831	834032	Am I leaving anybody out so far?
834872	835292	Those shows?
835653	840375	I think that's it, although we are in talks with a couple other podcasts for representation.
840535	843177	Yes, so Podcast X Zone at GamerConnect.
843197	843737	It's going to be fun.
844117	847959	And I hear they're announcing the guests for GamerCon later tonight, so that's exciting.
847979	849160	It's going to be a fun show.
851132	851573	All right.
852193	859017	By the way, before I turn to talk to Tim for a minute, I need to address some people are talking about my audio tonight that I sound a little different.
859137	864081	So when we were taping live on Bobby Blackwolf, my usual mic died.
864541	872526	So in just a few minutes before we went live tonight, I kind of had to resort to a plan B. So if I sound a little more distant than usual tonight, I apologize.
873707	876568	It's just we had to do a last-minute switch or you wouldn't be able to hear us at all.
876688	878149	We replaced Rob with a pod person.
878269	878510	Okay.
879150	906679	well I guess I sound a little more distant and I can even see like my levels aren't coming up as usual and I just don't have the time like trying to fix it on the fly and I kind of can't like I'll try to make it a little louder but um hopefully it won't sound too terrible when I listen back to it later because Shane's messaging me in the chat like you're gonna hate listening to this later because you sound off that's probably accurate all right um anyhow let's move on uh Tim
907739	908119	Hello.
908179	909500	You don't have a podcast.
909580	909980	I don't.
910200	911200	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
911320	913561	But, you know, you're coming on our show the first time.
913621	914561	It's a brand new world.
916202	917302	You work in the games industry.
917502	917762	I do.
917962	918522	Who do you work for?
918822	920023	I work for Crystal Dynamics.
920343	922463	And what would we know out of Crystal Dynamics?
923104	924844	We just released a game called Tomb Raider.
925084	926165	Oh, I think I've heard of that.
926265	926625	Yes.
926705	927045	Yeah.
927545	930206	Didn't you guys do that Matt Cross game that never came out?
931146	932186	No, that was Crystal Dreams.
934227	935108	Oh yeah, do you get that?
935428	937589	Do people get confused with the other companies?
937889	940551	Like, I know Telltale and Traveler's Tales all the time.
941471	943552	I don't think I've ever gotten confusion about who we are.
943732	946494	I think I've gotten a lot of people who wonder, who are you?
946634	951697	And then I'll say something like Tomb Raider, or I'll say Legacy of Kain, and suddenly they're like, oh, are you going to make a new Legacy of Kain?
953518	955079	That's probably the most common question.
955179	955459	Are you?
956821	957683	No comment!
958764	959125	Of course.
959245	959946	And Deade.
960046	960447	Of course.
960827	963111	Alright, no, I totally respect that, obviously.
965955	968139	But there's that DLC for Guardian of Light.
968239	968860	There is.
969381	970162	You can go get it right now.
970182	970743	Wasn't that enough?
970923	971925	Wasn't that enough for you people?
974474	977576	So when you say you work on a game like Tomb Raider, what did you do?
977897	995071	So I am a software engineer, meaning I program the computers that make them do things Specifically, I work in physics and collision and simulation So a lot of the stuff that moves based on your rigid body or cloth, that was me So when something goes through a wall, we blame you?
996052	997934	Sometimes you can blame me Or when the clothes clip?
998494	1000356	When the clothes clip, you can definitely blame me Okay
1001460	1028253	it's a good thing you didn't work on one of the games I played this week because there was that problem all over not not Tomb Raider let me be clear not Tomb Raider but something else I was like wow like I could see Tim playing this game and like twitching nervously as he's playing it that tends to happen does that happen when you play other games you're like this is this is I would have done this so different I'm always in that zone so I always see those things and that's what I'm looking at I'm looking at the performance of their physics I'm looking at the performance of all of their simulation stuff and I'm
1028853	1029273	and so on.
1056164	1056804	and DarkSakura.com.
1085768	1087949	How long ago does a game like Tomb Raider start?
1088009	1090149	Like, how long is the production cycle for a game like Tomb Raider?
1090209	1092270	How long ago did you know you're going to work on Tomb Raider?
1092990	1094031	About five years ago.
1094191	1094791	Oh, my God.
1094891	1095731	Yeah, it's been a while.
1096191	1097592	How long did you have to keep that a secret?
1097612	1100213	Because they only announced that, what, two, two and a half years ago?
1100473	1102934	I had to keep that a secret for, yeah, probably about three years.
1103014	1103594	Oh, my gosh.
1104794	1105294	Is that hard?
1106675	1107435	Not really.
1107975	1109256	I'm pretty antisocial, so...
1111886	1113967	That's the key to NDAs.
1114148	1114748	Be a hermit.
1115128	1115729	Exactly.
1116729	1118430	You don't go on podcasts for one.
1118450	1118971	I don't, no.
1119091	1119931	That's a good way to make sure.
1119951	1122233	This is very out of character.
1122633	1123694	How did you get into that?
1123954	1125735	Let me take a step back.
1126175	1130078	What made you say, I want to do physics and video games?
1130198	1134641	Obviously, you must have kind of narrowed your path as you went, but how did you end up where you're at?
1134841	1135601	That's a good question.
1135942	1138763	I've been a science nerd all my life, but I've also been a computer nerd.
1139323	1141965	And there was this obvious cross-section I didn't see at the time.
1142265	1150129	I went to undergrad for computer science, and later I went to grad school, and I did some more computer graphics and gaming-centric studies.
1150789	1158253	And I sort of wanted to bring my science background into that, and I found simulation was sort of the perfect world for me to do some research in.
1159090	1160772	How did you get hooked up with Crystal Dynamics?
1162554	1169702	I had an ex-classmate who worked there as an artist, and he got me an interview.
1170463	1178572	It just happened to be at the right time that they were looking for someone straight out of grad school, and it was the perfect position for me, so I sort of lucked out.
1179488	1181090	Tell them you know someone who does print material.
1183712	1188957	Stop trying to use this interview as a platform for your own agenda.
1188977	1190979	Going back to Tomb Raider for a minute.
1191179	1193362	Obviously, a lot of people are playing this game right now.
1195123	1200829	I will respect the situation and not bring up that story that everybody's talking about when it comes to sales and all that, but
1201209	1202930	The game's great, okay?
1202990	1203471	Thank you.
1204371	1210695	Even if you weren't my friend, I truly believe the game is great, and I think a lot of people feel the same way.
1212497	1221363	Or when somebody plays a game like Tomb Raider, and you obviously do a lot with the physics and the environments and so forth, what do you think people miss?
1222283	1230909	Is there something that you pay a special attention to detail to this, but you think people... I don't want to say necessarily that people don't appreciate it, but maybe it goes unnoticed, this work that you do?
1231789	1232630	Well, certainly.
1232650	1234871	There's a lot of different types of gamers who play Tomb Raider.
1234891	1236751	And you've got the people who run right through the game.
1237352	1240333	And of course, those people have to play the puzzles, which are based on physics.
1240353	1241854	So that's sort of shoved in their face.
1241874	1242514	They can't miss that.
1242934	1250437	But there's a lot of nice little touches, little environmental effects, little rigid bodies that are around the world to make everything come to life.
1250797	1252538	Bits of cloth flapping in the breeze.
1253058	1256560	That stuff, you know, we spend a good amount of time on that to make that look good and natural.
1256980	1271853	and it makes the whole environment come alive but it's not something every gamer is going to sit and look at they sort of will just run by and of course there are the explorers who want to go around and explore every nook and cranny and so they're going to see all those little things they're going to see every detail that's not correct
1272233	1275414	That sounds like people that play Skyrim is probably a very similar approach.
1275454	1278575	You know, you have some people that are just like, I want to just kill all the villagers and da-da-da.
1278655	1281575	And then, you know, some people are like, I'm going to pick every flower.
1283216	1283536	Right?
1284396	1287177	Although, it's a good thing Laura Croft can't pick flowers.
1287237	1287637	Or can she?
1287657	1288057	Did I miss that?
1288077	1288497	She can.
1288617	1288937	Oh, my God.
1289077	1290398	There are plants to pick.
1290498	1291078	That's right.
1292678	1294339	I guess I'm one of those people who just wants to shoot.
1294399	1297099	Now I'm having Resident Evil flashbacks.
1297239	1298460	You mix the green herb.
1299640	1303942	and all of those plants that you can run past and then they rustle as you run past them and move.
1304462	1305062	I made those.
1305882	1306342	Nice.
1307903	1311184	So I talked a minute ago about how the game is being well received.
1311984	1320987	When you go on Metacritic or one of those sites and you see that overall the reception you're getting is positive is that important for somebody like you?
1321448	1325509	When you look at reviews and that positive affirmation is that something you're like
1326423	1327724	Oh, I'm so happy to see that.
1327864	1330467	Or are you like, eh, it doesn't really change anything?
1330507	1331808	You know, I'm really proud of the game.
1331868	1334050	I'm really happy with the whole thing.
1334070	1336352	I'm really happy with the stuff that I did.
1337613	1342577	And I like to tell myself I don't care what the reviews say, but I'll be honest, I love praise.
1343197	1343397	So...
1345639	1348301	I mean, being completely blunt here, it's great.
1348381	1349842	It is great to read those reviews.
1349962	1352423	And it is sad to read the ones that are not super glowing.
1353104	1355625	And they really, like, stick in my craw.
1356286	1357847	But, uh... Sure, sure.
1358207	1361129	It's, you know, it's the same thing when I go look up reviews for this show.
1361429	1363210	Like, I'll go on iTunes and there'll be five-star reviews.
1363270	1366272	I'm like, oh, that person was so awesome to leave that five-star review.
1366352	1366952	And that was awesome.
1366972	1371295	And then you go to, like, a one-star review where, you know, it's like, everybody's screaming all the time.
1371335	1373637	And I'm just like, okay, I'm gonna...
1374597	1375037	Take that.
1375598	1378399	At least no one's told you to shut up and get in the kitchen.
1379780	1380641	Do you remember that one?
1381141	1382081	Did that really happen?
1382121	1382522	Yes.
1382582	1383262	That really happened.
1384083	1385483	What is wrong with people?
1385683	1387144	This was like after our second year.
1388485	1391887	So, yeah, I know what you mean.
1391947	1394488	Hey Rob, was that five star review from Mrs. Roberts?
1395069	1395329	Yes.
1397987	1399548	No, it was from the other Mr. Roberts.
1401108	1402308	There's something about me you might not know.
1403669	1404749	I was implying that was your mother.
1404769	1406090	It was from Rob Robson.
1408090	1411091	Okay, so everybody in chat is talking about the death scenes.
1411111	1413512	They're like, the death scenes, the death scenes.
1413932	1415893	Did Tim do all this stuff with the death scenes?
1417013	1421815	Let me ask you about... When I think of Tomb Raider, I think of the Conan O'Brien review.
1422515	1423656	Did you see the Conan O'Brien review?
1423696	1423916	I did.
1423956	1424597	It was hilarious.
1424617	1426258	Did you all sit around in your office and watch it?
1426319	1427480	Oh, yeah.
1428581	1435106	And there's that part where they're doing the tree thing over and over and over, and they're playing it up for laughs.
1436027	1437449	But that's kind of like a serious thing.
1437609	1440531	It is, but did you notice the quality of the laughs?
1440591	1442153	They weren't just, oh, that's hilarious.
1442253	1447277	It was like every time, it was first, oh, then laughter.
1447297	1447698	Yeah.
1447958	1449360	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1469449	1497041	um you know there's there's things in Tomb Raider that are kind of um like I I I see it I don't know if it was intentional but I see elements of like Metroidvania like that type of thing that I don't think was really in Tomb Raider before but I kind of see it in there now um do you do you draw inspiration from other games for Tomb Raider because I know you don't just play Tomb Raider all day every day like because clearly you're wearing a Mass Effect hoodie but I'm also wearing a Tomb Raider t-shirt yeah I know I know I know but uh
1498703	1502390	Since you don't just play Tomb Raider all day every day, do you get inspiration from other games?
1502570	1506858	Do you see things in other games that you want to do with Tomb Raider?
1507657	1510540	I do, however, I'm not really the one making those decisions.
1511121	1512923	That's the creative and the design team.
1513743	1524574	So while there may be games that I like and I think, hey, we should take this element from that game because it's awesome, because there's something to learn there, it's not going to go ignored, but it's not really my place.
1524875	1526797	It's not the problems I'm trying to solve.
1527297	1530861	There are far more creative and talented people at Crystal Dynamics solving those problems.
1531881	1532542	But yes, they do.
1532602	1535963	They definitely take inspiration from other games, from other media.
1536523	1541645	We got a lot of inspiration for this reboot from movies like The Descent and Rambo.
1542145	1546727	Oh my god, it wasn't... Okay, so when I reviewed Tomb Raider on the show, I totally compared it to The Descent.
1546847	1548787	And I'm like, it is totally like that movie.
1548847	1552869	We had some shot-for-shot scene call-outs to scenes in The Descent.
1553069	1556790	We sat, as a studio, back in pre-production, we sat around and we watched that movie.
1557130	1558011	It's so scary.
1558091	1559371	It scared the crap out of me.
1560031	1562072	I saw that on the big screen, okay?
1562712	1564573	That movie creeped me out so hard.
1564693	1565194	Oh my gosh.
1565834	1567495	I still like what Alan called the game, though.
1568695	1572737	Lara Croft's really bad, no good, terrible, very bad day.
1573737	1574958	Or whatever that book was.
1575058	1576959	No, I think he also just called it Girl.
1577379	1577519	Yeah.
1580129	1585194	Um, so girl is the first, the first girl game.
1585314	1588377	No, it's, it's the first Tomb Raider game that has multiplayer, you know?
1588998	1592641	Um, and so multiplayer, you know, I, I do the other show about Warcraft.
1592681	1594303	We talk about PV and PVP all the time.
1594343	1595444	PVP is unpredictable.
1595764	1598387	You know, you don't know, you know what computers are going to do.
1598427	1603631	You know what attacks the, the, the, the boss monsters and so forth are going to do, but you don't know what other people are going to do.
1604392	1610658	Does the unpredictability of multiplayer cause different things when you're planning environments and things like that?
1610678	1612540	Do you have to look at it, take a different approach to that?
1613461	1615203	I actually didn't work on multiplayer.
1615283	1615543	What?
1615663	1620368	Multiplayer was done by our sister studio up in Montreal, Eidos Montreal.
1621109	1625854	So it was made in a relative vacuum with the single player game.
1625954	1627956	We worked on single player in Redwood City.
1628516	1632017	and then in Montreal they worked on multiplayer.
1632037	1637298	So of course there was a little bit of collaboration to keep things in sync, but I was not part of the active development of that.
1637558	1638318	Interesting.
1638819	1639179	Okay.
1639539	1640519	Have you played the multiplayer?
1641499	1643140	I played a little bit of the multiplayer.
1643380	1648901	I shot some people and then I got killed about 10 times more than I shot people, but...
1651723	1654044	You also worked on Guardian of Light a few years ago, right?
1654344	1655344	I did for a little while.
1655384	1656765	I tend to bounce around at the studio.
1657165	1657645	That was good.
1658005	1659045	Yeah, I liked Guardian of Light too.
1659065	1661006	Well, Guardian of Light was more like arcade-y for me.
1661646	1662586	Yes, exactly.
1662746	1663606	I mean, that's not a bad thing.
1663626	1665587	It was on Xbox Live Arcade.
1665607	1666567	This was supposed to happen, right?
1667007	1669168	So here's the thing, though.
1669608	1676710	Here's what I don't understand about Guardian of Light, and I need help, is that you have the Guardian of Light game, and that's Laura, but then there's the reboot Laura,
1678071	1686095	Is there two Loras now, or did this game kind of like, no, Guardian of Light, it's not really about that anymore, it's about Laura or what?
1686395	1688997	Yeah, this game was a complete reboot.
1689057	1690237	We're going to start over.
1690277	1693999	We're going to create a brand new property.
1694019	1695880	We're going to do everything over.
1696180	1699262	So anything that happened beforehand, it all happened in the past.
1699322	1700583	It was a different game.
1700683	1701684	It was a different universe.
1702284	1703224	We want a fresh start.
1703424	1706026	We don't want to have any baggage from any other games, so.
1706337	1708378	So this is the equivalent of Marvel's Ultimate Universe.
1711099	1714461	I can't say I'm an expert in that, but yes, I suppose so.
1714661	1715902	Okay.
1716242	1719424	Except I think it would be less lame than the Ultimate Universe is sometimes.
1720344	1720644	All right.
1720744	1720924	Yeah.
1721425	1728248	Well, I'll stop bugging you about Tomb Raider because I know when it comes to the day job, there's only so many things you do and you don't want to say.
1728328	1730949	But I guess let me just turn it over to you for anything general.
1731089	1735872	Is there anything you want to tell the listeners about Tomb Raider or about your work or what have you?
1737033	1739896	I really think you guys should all buy it.
1740697	1741958	We'd really appreciate that.
1743139	1746743	Actually, I should ask you a couple of the general things I asked him.
1747824	1749706	Not even this Tomb Raider and programming and all this.
1750006	1751428	How did you get into just games?
1751808	1753370	Why are you a video gamer?
1754232	1757496	I was a video gamer as far back as I can remember, like really young.
1757516	1759738	We had an Atari 2600 in the house.
1761780	1764322	No one else in my family cares about video games except for me.
1764502	1766324	My dad bought it because he thought it would be a hoot.
1767205	1769387	And then I sort of, like, this is mine.
1770067	1772290	I want to have this all the time.
1772330	1774352	And so I always bugged them to buy me the new systems.
1775112	1775913	I only got a few.
1776493	1777354	I got the NES.
1777514	1780436	They wouldn't buy me a Super Nintendo, and that was the worst thing in the world.
1783258	1790904	The best thing in the world was to go over to my cousin's house or certain neighbors who had a Super Nintendo because that was the coolest shit ever.
1792565	1793806	So I was a big computer nerd.
1793846	1794746	I liked to program.
1794967	1801091	When I first taught myself how to program, it was in QBasic, and the first things I did was try to make games.
1801712	1802292	And they were horrible.
1802392	1804734	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1823769	1824129	Exactly.
1824329	1824790	That's awesome.
1824810	1831633	Do you have any advice for people that might be wanting to get into the games industry, like people listening to this show that are still in school, like, yeah, I want to work in games.
1831653	1832253	Do you have any advice?
1833714	1834855	Yeah.
1834935	1835455	Make games.
1835815	1841478	A lot of people who want to go into games will go and say, I'm going to be a programmer, so I'm going to go do computer science or something.
1841518	1853224	But when they're done with that program, if they don't have anything to show that's related to games, it's really hard to convince someone who can only hire two or three more engineers that you're worth it compared to the other 20 people who want that job.
1853784	1856886	So, as early as possible, start making games.
1858287	1859168	They don't have to be great.
1859488	1860909	You can start modding other games.
1860949	1864772	You can start scripting within packages.
1864812	1866813	You can use free engines like Unity.
1867934	1869335	There's a lot of resources out there.
1870376	1872277	So make as many games as you can.
1872897	1874318	Show people that you're passionate about it.
1875479	1880863	Looking at our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, Actdeft says, your parents wouldn't buy you a Super Nintendo?
1880964	1882204	Worst parents ever.
1882345	1883946	They are the worst parents ever.
1884606	1885527	Never forgive them for that.
1885547	1886348	That's not nice.
1887549	1891992	I had to save up my own money to buy a Nintendo 64 when that came out.
1892232	1893473	I had to cut a lot of grass.
1895515	1896075	That's awesome.
1896956	1900639	Let's see, looking at Blackwolf says, I wrote games in QBasic too.
1902551	1903332	Thank you for watching!
1918846	1920607	The Classic Tunneling Problem
1934873	1949079	I just remember making the ball bounce on my Texas Instruments computer That was the extent of anything I've ever programmed Oh, the games I made on my TI-82 See, I couldn't do any of that shit I just wanted to talk about games with all my friends
1950819	1951599	I'm with you on this one
1966025	1969050	I got the engine done, but I mean, a TI-82 sucks.
1969150	1972535	Well, Square finally did one years later on the PSP, right?
1972555	1979946	There was a guy in my class who sat during the entire class, and by the time he was done, I was playing Pole Position on his graphing calculator.
1980808	1981268	It was awesome.
1981429	1981689	Awesome.
1982233	1984014	Yeah, that's another good piece of advice, actually.
1984074	1984595	Start small.
1984635	1990278	I know you laugh at a TI-82, but the constraints there were so tight that it forces you to be creative.
1990599	2001386	I will say I used to play Commodore 64 all the time when I was younger and would do the basic, but I would start to type in the programs that were in the back of magazines and then try to modify them a little bit to meet my needs.
2002127	2004528	If I changed a color or something, then I'd be like, I'm the shit.
2004568	2005249	I changed the color.
2005609	2006249	So I don't know.
2006329	2006770	This is me.
2007610	2029132	um okay one more question then we're gonna get into our gaming weeks but uh same thing I asked uh Spike a minute ago what is like your favorite video game ever you're not allowed to name something you worked on oh damn it I'm taking that off the table right now so what so what what's like your favorite video game ever you know what I'm really bad at coming up with favorites yeah hmm well I I
2031593	2034775	I'm wearing a jacket for Mass Effect and I'm a huge sci-fi nerd.
2035036	2036376	Mass Effect is one of my favorite series.
2036877	2039378	So Jamie's like... That's why we're all friends.
2039818	2043080	We're great friends because of that.
2043321	2046663	And to create a little controversy with Spike, Super Mario Bros.
2046683	2046663	3.
2046823	2049104	I'm going to say Super Mario Bros.
2049384	2049104	3.
2049544	2051706	Your opinion is wrong and you should feel bad for having it.
2053371	2053751	Super Mario Bros.
2053771	2054932	3 vs. Super Mario World
2073948	2077070	He didn't own Super Mario World because the parents wouldn't get him a Super Nintendo.
2077410	2081272	What's your hatred towards Super Mario Bros.
2081632	2081272	3?
2082132	2084773	If we're being completely honest, it's just me being a hipster.
2085573	2086934	Everyone loves it, so I hate it.
2087074	2088895	I'm glad you said it because I was going to say it if you didn't.
2089135	2089795	Yeah, I knew you were.
2089835	2090736	That's why I cut you off.
2090996	2092336	What are your thoughts on Ocarina, then?
2094157	2100420	Oh, I am not a fan of Zelda at all, except for Majora's Mask and Link's Awakening.
2103362	2103602	Mario 3
2126278	2128640	Super Mario World or neither one.
2128700	2129240	Geez.
2129540	2131542	I'm surprised you didn't put Super Metroid on that list.
2132082	2136445	No, because this is about the Marios there.
2136505	2143330	Remember, you have to be a registered participant at live.vognetwork.com and you'll see that pop up right there underneath the chat.
2143670	2144510	And you can vote in the poll.
2144550	2145071	Which is better?
2145531	2148773	Mario 3, Super Mario World, or neither one?
2149193	2149794	Geez.
2149974	2150334	Neither.
2150354	2151515	It was Mario is missing.
2153136	2153857	Mario typing?
2153877	2153917	No.
2157148	2157688	We'll see you next time.
2184867	2185207	Thank you.
2185287	2185987	Thanks for having me.
2186067	2187368	Thanks for dealing with me.
2187948	2188188	Please.
2188668	2192849	You'll stay here and comment randomly on other things throughout the show with Captain Spike, right?
2193049	2193229	Yes?
2194149	2194870	Or no, you're out of here.
2194890	2195090	Bye.
2195170	2197030	Yeah, we're going to take the pizza and go.
2198670	2198931	All right.
2199211	2202731	Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
2203372	2204712	So, DarkSakura, why don't you start us off?
2205365	2206526	I figured out I'm old.
2207508	2209189	I played TDR last night.
2209990	2212733	I felt like death warmed over after I was done.
2212753	2214816	I can't beat an 8-footer anymore, Rob.
2216037	2217679	I can't do Superstar anymore, Rob.
2218079	2222244	Well, I don't think you're gonna be able to just do it the first game either, you know?
2223105	2223746	You know what you need.
2224687	2225588	She needs a montage.
2226648	2227888	I do not need a freaking montage.
2227928	2230869	It's where you get better in a short amount of time.
2230989	2232729	Gotta have a montage.
2233649	2239030	I'm actually though, we're hooking back up the DDR pads in the front room because I have nothing else to do.
2239110	2239950	I'm unemployed.
2240811	2254193	So I also I guess I can say now that I'm playing it even though I can't say anything else about it is I'm playing the beta of Final Fantasy XIV.
2255270	2255790	So it's Windhurst.
2278382	2278842	I'd say graphically...
2308934	2315796	On par with modern... Which is good, because it's going to be a PlayStation 3 game.
2315816	2322117	Well, I would say in a term of graphical sense, just in the processing power required, it's definitely a big step over WoW.
2322777	2323917	That I'm sure I can say.
2324578	2327778	So anyway, so I've been playing that, no more until June.
2328979	2334900	I started playing Phantasy Star Online 2, thanks to one of our lovely listeners, PrinceBrightStar.
2336000	2352815	and I actually there was a patch that happened after I started playing so I basically got through the whole tutorial level and I've made my little redhead Newman person chick and I want an OPA OPA mag
2354150	2354591	I don't care.
2354831	2365585	I worked my ass off to have an Opa Opa in the first Fantasy Storm Online and goddammit I'm gonna have another Opa Opa and I'm gonna have a Master System because I'm a Sega nerd.
2366494	2368655	Even though I did have a Super Nintendo as a kid.
2368895	2372676	Technically, it was my brother's, but I did convince my mother to buy it so I could take it over.
2374077	2374657	So, just saying.
2375537	2379338	And we had Rock Band at my birthday party, which I talked about.
2379559	2382980	We left Rock Band out, so I did some... I tried singing alone.
2383680	2394724	I played Minecraft last night, trying to get this... Someone made the Ocarina of Time map in Minecraft, so I was trying to get it to load, and I still can't figure out how to get it to load as its own world, so whatever.
2395684	2403388	Um, and, uh, so instead I just went around in my house building, digging more gopher holes in my house.
2404328	2405669	And, uh, God, what else did I play?
2405689	2406429	I played something else.
2406810	2410912	Oh, um, Drunken Robot Pornography, which is super awesome.
2410992	2412272	It's like jumping flash on crack.
2412532	2413533	I've been telling everyone about it.
2414533	2419196	Um, and, uh, I, um, got the indie pack last night.
2419316	2421077	I, I've only installed, uh,
2421937	2423038	Back to the Future Back to the Future
2442927	2443948	It looked interesting.
2443968	2444828	It was a neat game.
2445749	2447050	So I've downloaded a few games.
2447430	2451433	There's that Dungeon Quest or something.
2451493	2452273	It's like a puzzle game.
2452794	2454915	But it's sort of a side-scrolling combat puzzle game.
2454935	2455675	Oh, the Dungeon Hearts.
2455896	2456636	Yeah, Dungeon Hearts.
2456656	2457337	That's it.
2457457	2458597	Shane just did a review of that.
2458617	2459638	It just went up on VOG today.
2459798	2461499	Yeah, it was part of the deal.
2461579	2467803	So, I mean, I spent like eight bucks and got some good games and got a really neat chiptune soundtrack that came with it.
2468604	2468764	And...
2470345	2471386	I didn't play any of them yet.
2471406	2475609	I just installed a few of them because I have been working on projects.
2477090	2478852	And that's my gaming week.
2479753	2480633	Before we go to Loki.
2480873	2481234	Oh, yeah.
2481274	2481694	One last thing.
2482194	2482915	Dan's been playing Grid 2.
2483996	2484496	The racing game?
2484817	2486358	Yes, with his three monitor setup.
2487218	2488199	He's such a man.
2488700	2489800	So manly, doodly.
2490381	2496366	I put 15 seconds of him playing it on my Tumblr just to show off what his setup looks like.
2496386	2496606	Yeah.
2498240	2505306	That's it Awesome Going to the results of our live poll before I go to Loki The results of the live poll Which is better?
2505406	2518577	The winner with 54.17% of the vote Mario 3 Hells yeah Captain Spike Sorry about it I'm going home You're taking your ball and going home?
2521480	2522922	Alright, so Mario 3 is the winner there.
2523863	2526406	But there was a couple votes for neither one.
2526446	2526947	Jeez.
2527348	2531112	But at least it didn't win like the Nintendo question we asked last week.
2532935	2534296	Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?
2535598	2536799	I bought stuff too.
2536900	2538281	I bought the Grand Theft Auto collection.
2539192	2540893	Okay, so, what the hell?
2541513	2542954	Seriously, Rockstar Games.
2544035	2546276	During the weekend, it's supposed to be the Steam sale, okay?
2546296	2547637	It's on sale during the weekend.
2548057	2549918	And then today, they're like, guess what?
2549938	2551179	We're pulling fucking double sale.
2551599	2552800	We're marking it down again.
2552820	2556382	I'm like, fuck you, I just bought that shit yesterday for twice the price.
2556542	2561525	I mean, it was $25 for, you know, all the Grand Theft Auto games, but now it's $12 for all the Grand Theft Auto games.
2561865	2563646	So you should seriously buy that if you haven't bought it yet.
2565086	2566067	I picked that up.
2566127	2567848	Also, the indie bundle as well.
2568128	2571770	I haven't really installed anything other than Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
2571790	2574031	I still haven't played that though.
2574552	2578814	I've been playing Saints Row the 3rd on PC just trying to 100% everything.
2578914	2583917	Technically, according to the game, I am 100% right now because I have all the unlockables and stuff.
2585818	2590800	I need to do all the Saints book stuff which is really boring from what I remember the last time.
2590820	2593382	That's why it pissed me off so much that I lost my save on my 360 because
2594062	2599206	I had all that pretty much done except for one carjacking or one car theft mission.
2600987	2602168	So I had to do it all over again.
2603969	2606510	I played a little bit of Surgeon Simulator 2013.
2606550	2609092	Oh, we were talking about that last week.
2609392	2610473	That video was hilarious.
2610553	2612494	That game is fucking hilarious.
2612855	2613795	It's just awesome.
2613815	2614636	Dan got grossed out.
2615376	2616317	I just don't know.
2616677	2618739	I still haven't figured out how to do the heart surgery.
2618779	2620180	I had to go watch it on YouTube or something.
2620200	2622101	I managed to... It was...
2622301	2622861	Thanks for watching!
2652961	2653401	Organ 3.
2654062	2654422	I don't know.
2655142	2657082	Still can't figure out how to get the heart out, though.
2657102	2661203	Because the stomach and the esophagus are still in there.
2661464	2665165	And I can't figure out how to cut it or rip it out.
2666585	2667145	So I don't know.
2667165	2668045	I still can't pass that.
2668546	2673167	So I just threw the heart in there and the alarm clock and assumed that it was... Try pickaxe.
2674087	2674527	Pickaxe?
2674647	2676048	I tried the axe.
2676188	2677268	I tried the saw.
2677708	2678468	All I did was kill him.
2679008	2680829	So... I don't know.
2681915	2687040	I saw someone trying to do that one and there was a stint that you could insert in.
2687200	2693307	This is one that Dan and I were watching and we just got through the whole part where the guy's messing with his desk and trying to put the floppy.
2693735	2694315	Oh, that was hard.
2694355	2696676	Yeah, I finally got one of the floppies in there and I'm like, oh, this is it.
2696696	2698036	I was like, just swallow some pills.
2698056	2699477	You've got diazepam.
2699497	2701458	So swallow some pills and calm yourself.
2701718	2707019	Okay, Dungeon Buster is talking about this game in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com saying the kidney transplant video was hilarious.
2707039	2709680	The guy tossed the patient's colon out of the back of the ambulance.
2709980	2711321	What is wrong with this game?
2713727	2715328	Best game ever or best game ever.
2717089	2718370	Don't make me go to a live poll.
2720111	2721052	It's pretty awesome.
2721693	2722693	It is pretty awesome.
2723154	2725535	So yeah, I played a bunch of that.
2726896	2729698	Actually, something I'm going to try to bring back that I tried this week.
2730198	2731619	Very short notice so no one joined.
2731940	2733601	It's fine because I still had fun playing it.
2734261	2736143	I had a birthday dinner I had to go to.
2736163	2736744	No, it's cool.
2736804	2737284	No worries.
2737324	2739206	Seriously, it was very short notice.
2739226	2741729	I decided, hey, let's bring back VOG Game Night.
2741769	2743130	So that's what I'm going to start doing.
2743170	2747275	Thursdays, 8 to 10-ish, pick a game.
2747475	2747915	It doesn't matter.
2747935	2748116	Whatever.
2748136	2748917	You can live stream something.
2748937	2749297	I don't care.
2749357	2751840	I already promised Mass Effect 3 playthroughs on Thursday.
2751860	2752220	Well, that's fine.
2752240	2754803	Well, why don't you play Mass Effect 3 with the VOG listeners?
2754983	2755503	Oh, fuck no.
2755543	2756504	I'm not playing Mass Effect 3.
2757145	2757285	No.
2757525	2759185	VOG Game Night will never be Mass Effect 3.
2759225	2759545	I'm sorry.
2759625	2761586	Unless I'm out one night and then you can host it.
2762166	2766207	At any game convention there's multiple games to pick from so I'm sure it'll be fine.
2767187	2777289	This coming week I'm going to do a repeat of Minecraft XBLA which is fine because I haven't actually played that in a while so I played that for two or three hours and it was fun.
2777969	2784670	I miss that because even with Minecraft, because we're playing creative right now on the server that we have of the VOG server but
2786269	2787270	Survival is kind of fun.
2787490	2793155	I mean, for a while, then you wanted to start getting creative with it and cheating and stuff.
2793196	2795618	But for now, I mean, it was a lot of fun.
2795638	2799001	So it was kind of fun to kind of play something different than just creative mode.
2799902	2801003	And I forgot that you have to eat.
2801443	2802864	I'm like, oh, shit, that's right.
2803105	2804986	You have to do that now.
2805747	2806648	So it was kind of fun.
2808029	2809811	So I played that and...
2811530	2811970	God, what else?
2812050	2813731	I know there's got to be some other shit I played.
2814231	2815672	Oh, Call of Duty.
2815752	2822676	Actually, I've been playing Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 through the campaign because I've been running out of people to play multiplayer with.
2822716	2824037	We're trying to get more people in.
2824977	2828959	So I played a little bit of multiplayer, but played a lot of the campaign.
2829600	2830240	And it's okay.
2830260	2831941	It's kind of comparable.
2832261	2836524	And then I think I played Defiance one of these nights, which is still fun.
2836944	2837084	Good.
2837364	2837904	Did you watch the show?
2837924	2838664	Are you watching the show, too?
2838684	2839524	No, I'm not watching the show.
2839564	2840325	It's a sci-fi show.
2840345	2841645	Come on.
2841805	2843645	I know where the bar's set on that, okay?
2843705	2844366	How rude!
2844686	2845626	Isn't he rude right now?
2846406	2846786	Rude?
2846946	2847446	I'm sorry.
2847506	2848006	Sci-fi.
2848026	2851167	Purveyors of such wonderful films as, you know, Shark the Puss.
2851427	2853447	Oh, oh, oh, you meant sci-fi the network.
2853507	2854628	No, sci-fi the network.
2854668	2858168	No, I'm not dogging sci-fi, like, the genre.
2858249	2860669	I'm saying sci-fi the TV network.
2860689	2862069	All right, well, that's acceptable.
2863330	2863690	That's fine.
2864470	2865070	I mean, I just...
2866550	2867270	Manskito.
2870092	2870492	I'm sorry.
2871572	2874854	I'm sure it's good, but I'm not into the world.
2874914	2877055	I mean, if it was like a Borderlands game, it'd be even better.
2878115	2879476	You're not excited about Sharknado?
2882444	2883485	Who's in Sharknado?
2883585	2886548	It's a legit thing.
2886588	2891493	Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus starring the wonderful Debra Gibson.
2891513	2899421	Here's something that I am kind of interested in seeing, or at least seeing the riff tracks of, is they have a Birdemic sequel coming out.
2899902	2900322	Birdemic 2.
2901523	2902465	That warranted a sequel?
2902885	2903085	Yeah.
2903406	2904387	The guy thought it was good.
2905108	2906350	And so he made another movie.
2906811	2908413	Like, he seriously thinks it's good.
2908633	2912558	I think what he thinks is, hey, I make a really shitty movie and I make a ton of money from it.
2913239	2913580	Done.
2914301	2915122	I'm gonna spend another 10,005 days.
2917512	2918333	Rob found it, Sharknado.
2918353	2925479	Sharknado will have Ian Ziering from Beverly Hills 90210 and Tara Reid is the star of Sharknado.
2925719	2926380	Is she going to be the shark?
2926440	2927321	I am here for that.
2927421	2928722	Wait, when does this come on?
2928942	2930464	I don't know.
2932445	2933947	I'm trying to look at IMDB to figure out.
2933967	2935788	So what exactly is a Sharknado?
2935848	2938851	Is that like a tornado with sharks in it?
2939031	2940152	Tiger Claw, help me out.
2940312	2941753	Good idea, bad idea.
2944796	2950700	By the way, Rob, we do have to bring back your post-Horde House multiplayer stream.
2952121	2952801	Oh, yeah.
2952881	2953842	I like doing the live streaming.
2953862	2957304	Where I turn into a very potty-mouthed person.
2957645	2959186	What they need is just do Landsharks.
2959366	2964189	Landsharks and have, like, you know... But it has to be, like... Knock on the door and go, Candy Graham.
2965154	2969259	Alright, in the interest of time, I gotta derail this and get us back on track.
2970040	2971362	That's it.
2971602	2973725	So yeah, this week, Minecraft again.
2973885	2974866	So Minecraft XBLA.
2975547	2977229	There's gonna be a thread on the forums.
2978090	2981415	Hopefully we can put up a calendar or something like that so we can plan ahead with what's up.
2981475	2982776	And also let me know what games you want to play.
2983437	2983918	Not Mass Effect 3.
2987000	2988160	I will try to make this quick.
2989801	2990501	I had fun.
2990561	2993022	We went to Golfland, Spike, Tim and I yesterday.
2993703	3006028	And well, not that there was that much to play there, but I did play some DDR and I about died after one set of songs because, you know, just being 34 now and trying to get up on the machine and just jumping into a set of songs.
3006368	3006708	Rob.
3007768	3014470	But come on, I don't have the stamina I had when I was 24 because I haven't been playing DDR every day like I used to then.
3014910	3017330	So, you know, and I don't work out or anything like that.
3017430	3020771	So it's a little difficult to just get up there and do it.
3021271	3022772	But it was fun.
3023672	3025172	There's a lot about DDR I really miss.
3025432	3028833	So I just wanted to kind of throw that out there for the longtime Bomani fans.
3029153	3030634	There is one thing I forgot to say, by the way.
3030875	3031035	What?
3031215	3034158	Because I was at the arcade at John's Incredibly Crappy Pizza.
3034618	3035939	They had a Doodle Jump arcade game.
3036400	3037781	Yeah, they had that at RVGL, too.
3038021	3038502	I was surprised.
3038702	3039723	Yeah.
3039943	3042305	They also have one for Fruit Ninja, but I think we've talked about that before.
3042626	3042946	As you were.
3042966	3044307	Alright, yeah, yeah.
3044367	3049312	Okay, so as far as console games go, we were playing a lot of fun stuff last night.
3049932	3054777	We were trying to find four-player games on Xbox Live, so I think we touched, what, Perfect Dark, Doom...
3055425	3057706	Aegis Wing, which somebody commented on Facebook.
3057726	3058546	Why are you playing that?
3058626	3059646	I'm like, it's four players.
3059986	3060346	Shut up.
3061526	3064667	And You Don't Know Jack, which is probably the best out of the four-player games.
3065407	3067988	This random-ass Tetris game I had that wasn't bad either.
3068128	3070048	The THQ published one, yeah.
3070248	3070888	It wasn't bad.
3071168	3072089	Tetris Evolution.
3072129	3074269	It's years old, but not bad.
3075409	3078270	Okay, but as far as new games go, there was one new game I played.
3079288	3098267	and I wrote a review of this that you can read at vognetwork.com and the game is Dead Island Riptide and I gave it a D plus on the site I didn't there was a lot about it I didn't really care for but I want to acknowledge that I realize there's a lot of people that already know like Dead Island Riptide I am totally here for this like
3098687	3100409	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3119207	3121948	But for me, I found it to have a lot of technical challenges.
3122848	3127749	Like, for instance, zombies that, you know, I would be facing one direction and I'd suddenly turn.
3128089	3132690	And suddenly when the zombie's in my field of vision, it just, it was starting to get up and it would just fall down.
3132970	3133770	And then get back up again.
3133850	3136350	Like, just this weird stuff that would happen.
3136370	3137330	Well, just kidding.
3137470	3141671	And then these shadow effects that were kind of not good.
3142131	3145132	And some other, it's all environmental too, Tim.
3145152	3145232	Yeah.
3145792	3149214	Yeah, in the five minutes I saw of it, I wasn't super impressed.
3149854	3153816	So, yeah, from a technical standpoint, I wasn't that satisfied.
3153956	3155536	I found it to be a bit repetitive.
3157277	3161059	But, you know, if you like the first game, this is more of the same.
3161499	3165161	Which, for fans of the first game, I'm sure is not going to be a bad thing.
3165201	3168022	So I kind of think you already know where you stand on Dead Island Riptide.
3168442	3171884	I'm not going to tell you, go check it out if you're on the bubble.
3172501	3176405	Um, mostly just Monster Hunter Ultimate.
3195854	3197935	I couldn't stand the demo of that game.
3197995	3198555	What's up?
3198655	3199835	The demo is awful.
3200055	3205897	Okay, so what am I missing by not... Well, for one, I hate it when companies put out horrible demos.
3206017	3207237	And it's been a trend recently.
3207637	3210958	Ni No Kuni, terrible demo, great game.
3211959	3212259	What else?
3212279	3213379	There was another one not that long ago.
3213399	3214179	It was really bad too.
3214459	3218961	And now we got this Monster Hunter that I didn't know anything about Monster Hunter.
3219421	3222922	And I played this demo and I'm like, nope.
3222942	3223322	Nope.
3224082	3225923	Delete, but you are really into this.
3225943	3226583	What am I missing?
3226863	3229044	Well, you know, it's largely a skill-based game.
3230144	3244168	There is some advancement through gearing and what have you, but largely the whole point of the game is sort of learning the mechanics, learning how sort of the enemy behaviors interact with sort of their timing windows for when they're vulnerable to attack and
3244924	3245605	I really like it.
3245645	3248129	I think it's a very cerebral take on the action game.
3249150	3250312	But the demo is awful.
3250352	3252354	It doesn't communicate what's expected of you at all.
3252415	3257462	It just gives you some big weapons, some toned down monsters, and just says, oh, hack them until they're dead.
3258122	3261307	Which, you know, cool, but I'm not really here for that.
3262988	3265249	But for the full game, I actually find it very compelling.
3265289	3268151	I've put in something like 120 hours already.
3268271	3268691	Wow.
3269531	3270272	That's commitment.
3270512	3275534	Yeah, I'm the kind of guy who usually picks up games, I'll buy a $50 game, play a couple hours, and never touch it again.
3276475	3277875	Which is an awful thing.
3277895	3278916	I don't think that's cool.
3279036	3279996	You and me both, buddy.
3280317	3282438	That's why I felt comfortable saying that to you.
3283258	3284859	It's called Gamer ADD.
3285379	3287880	You know, oh, I'm going to check out some Dead Island Riptide.
3288020	3288540	Oh, shiny.
3289321	3289521	Yep.
3289981	3290181	Yep.
3290781	3291742	Oh, shit, Steam Stale?
3292638	3293699	Download, download, download, download.
3294380	3294560	Yeah.
3295061	3295641	Yeah.
3295781	3300125	But that and, you know, all of the gaming that you just mentioned that we did last night.
3300646	3307012	And I've been playing Super Mario World on Wii U and Mega Man 4 on my 3DS.
3308493	3308994	Good times.
3309454	3311016	You're a big fan of the Mega Man series, right?
3311216	3311917	Huge fan.
3312077	3312297	Yeah?
3312777	3312998	Yeah.
3313138	3315380	Okay, so which one's your favorite out of all the games?
3319354	3320615	I'm giving you an expectant look.
3320775	3321595	The number series.
3321876	3323297	I'm actually, I'm going to go with three.
3323437	3324918	Okay, that's one of the two correct answers.
3324938	3325378	I can forgive you.
3326259	3327240	I do love two.
3327480	3337287	The problem is I've played it so many times that it's less of, oh, I'm enjoying doing this and more of like, oh, hey, watch me get through this stage without using Flash Man's ability.
3339129	3340770	So you're talking about Quick Man's level then?
3341371	3341851	Exactly.
3342612	3343772	Okay, what's your favorite of the X?
3344613	3345134	The first one.
3345994	3347215	I don't even have to think about that.
3347255	3348116	I replay it every year.
3349329	3350269	I gave that to Rob recently.
3373004	3374286	Yeah, that's definitely a good idea.
3374766	3381215	For some reason, for 3 Ultimate, they removed the tutorials that used to be in-game in the other iterations of Monster Hunter.
3381936	3384960	I don't really know why they did that, but it makes the manual even more important.
3386066	3386386	Interesting.
3387187	3394153	You know, it was funny last night we were playing Tetris and I couldn't figure out like why our multiplayer mode was not doing the line increase thing that you expect to see.
3394553	3396074	I was like, wait a minute, this game's from 2006.
3396375	3397335	It still has a manual.
3397395	3398616	Let me go find it.
3400258	3402220	Not, oh, let me get out my iPad and log on.
3403340	3405322	So Tim, what's a weekend gaming look like for you?
3405382	3406023	How was your gaming week?
3406610	3410533	Hmm, well, I've been playing a lot of Picross 3D on my DS.
3411054	3411634	All casual.
3412815	3413216	I love it.
3413396	3421062	It's just a fun thing to do if I have five or ten minutes right before bed or I was playing it on the couch before the show started.
3422403	3428388	I played a little bit of Mass Effect 3 on Insanity because everything else is boring and slow now compared to that.
3430090	3434093	And as Spike mentioned earlier, I played some Super Mario World.
3435354	3436997	the inferior game to Super Mario Bros.
3437257	3449777	3 judging you we played until I died about 15 times in a row to Magic Koopa and quit in a fit of rage so yeah I do that if I get too frustrated with something
3450879	3451480	So does Rob.
3452561	3453021	I've done this.
3453121	3454222	This legitimately happened.
3454262	3459266	We were playing Ice Climber, but the part he leaves out is that he lost all his lives.
3459447	3463830	So I was just playing by myself and then I got frustrated and I said, you know what?
3463870	3464231	I'm done.
3464871	3465412	I got 10 minutes.
3465472	3465852	I'll show.
3466092	3466212	Out.
3468064	3471985	I haven't put as many hours into it as Spike has, but I've been playing Monster Hunter as well.
3473365	3477506	I am new to the Monster Hunter series, so I came at it from a brand new perspective.
3477907	3478827	It's pretty daunting.
3479387	3482248	They sort of plop you in the game.
3483428	3487009	There's a lot about the game that I find really, really annoying.
3487429	3495635	In terms of the interface, the tiny text, just the really clunky nature of getting quests and it all feels really artificial.
3496055	3501659	But that all being said, I totally understand why the game works for people.
3501759	3506322	Like it really did in some ways sink its teeth into me and I wanted to get that next set of armor.
3506382	3508023	I wanted to kill that next monster.
3508603	3511145	So I did have a lot of fun with it despite the frustrations.
3512711	3518335	I feel like I'm missing out on this game that everybody's into and I just couldn't get into it.
3518476	3521078	Oh, I had a friend in Japan be one of the campers.
3522118	3522459	Oh, really?
3522719	3523359	Yeah.
3523379	3526402	Camped out for, I think, three different Monster Hunter games.
3526482	3527122	Oh my gosh.
3527483	3528584	Having a manual probably helped.
3529124	3530125	I didn't look at the manual.
3530705	3531746	Spike was my manual.
3532527	3536069	And even then, with somebody who knows what they're talking about, it's still hard.
3536470	3538571	It's a really steep learning curve to just jump into it.
3540072	3543914	Actdeft in our chatroom asking, Captain Spike, you a King of Fighters fan?
3543994	3548156	I'm not sure if that came from an earlier conversation or what, but are you a King of Fighters fan?
3548456	3548817	I am.
3549657	3551898	Someone had mentioned KOF in the chat.
3552018	3552959	Oh, that's where that came from.
3553419	3553639	Yeah.
3553799	3555240	Got it.
3555340	3558201	Is there a particular one in the series that you prefer?
3558982	3563944	Well, I've been collecting the cartridges for my Neo Geo, so basically all the ones I have already.
3563964	3564044	Yeah.
3564269	3565431	Thanks for watching!
3584624	3586866	It wasn't, I mean, yeah, it was basically unfinished.
3587467	3588888	My Shiranui wasn't even in it.
3588928	3589849	Like, how do you do that?
3590049	3591030	It was awful.
3591070	3597977	And it was like the one where, was it both Kyo and Iori were powered down?
3599338	3600059	It was not a good one.
3601098	3602559	All your upvotes, we need them.
3628420	3629501	to make that panel happen.
3629941	3633103	So please check that out and plan on coming out and saying hi.
3634164	3636526	All right, let's get into some gaming news for the week.
3636786	3639749	And I think Loki's going to start us off tonight.
3639889	3640890	What's going on in the gaming world?
3641310	3646354	So Microsoft's going to finally say something about the next Xbox system on May 21st.
3647375	3648256	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3662130	3663211	There's rumors!
3664873	3669257	A source told Polygon some few things.
3670478	3672140	I love sources.
3672280	3673301	It's always a source.
3673441	3674142	Always a source.
3674202	3675303	Yeah, right, right.
3676364	3676765	Why not?
3677005	3680488	For shits and giggles, let's dissect this shit too.
3680568	3680889	Come on.
3681349	3681829	Let's do it.
3682269	3686110	So there's some details that they're apparently talking about.
3686330	3691171	First off, you know, saying that, yes, system will be always online.
3692351	3695572	However, it's not as bad as it sounds.
3695752	3704893	And, you know, basically saying that also the system will be able to capture video and will do so similar to a DVR and you'll be able to pick highlights and stuff.
3704913	3709094	Sounds very similar to the PlayStation 4 and what they were talking about there.
3710274	3735271	and you'll be able to share those on the web and then also that it's gonna the online only part of it it is gonna have basically kind of a check for your games but it's gonna they're gonna leave it up to the publishers to decide whether the games are gonna be requiring a constant internet connection or not oh gee that let yes leave it in the hands of them
3739504	3749611	That, to me, sounds like that the publishers will be handling servers and stuff, so... If live goes down, you can't play that game.
3750192	3752974	If their server goes down, you can't play that game.
3754074	3755836	Your internet goes down, you can't play that game.
3756916	3758598	I don't know, it sounds lame.
3758838	3768505	Yeah, I mean, again, this is the same rumor that's been going... Now it's just this new spin on the same rumor, and it's kind of like... I'm kind of sick about theorizing on this one, because I think...
3769145	3780737	Also, with so much fallout from that guy on Twitter and the fact that we thought we were going to hear about this in April and now it's May, it kind of makes me think a lot of this shit's still up in the air.
3781418	3786223	So I'm not sure we can really thumb down any of this online stuff yet.
3786323	3786703	Exactly.
3786904	3790787	And they say one of the other things that's going to change is the way achievements are working.
3790927	3796373	They're saying they're going to basically kind of remove the cap, I guess, for achievements.
3796393	3801278	They're going to say make it even easier for publishers and developers to add achievements later on.
3801358	3806182	Like, say, they want you to notice a certain thing or focus on a certain part of a level or something.
3806422	3808765	Or download the DLC and get the more achievements.
3808785	3810426	Well, they do that anyways, but yeah.
3811808	3818253	and then also they were saying that the friends list size is going to increase.
3818854	3819594	Oh, finally!
3819634	3820835	The cap is going to be removed.
3820935	3821456	Finally!
3822297	3822917	It's about time.
3823698	3826600	I was supposed to happen several years ago when they shut off Halo 2.
3826841	3827561	Yes, I remember that.
3828962	3831124	So apparently that's now going to happen somehow.
3834247	3835188	That one I believe.
3835428	3837450	For what it's worth, I believe that one.
3839389	3842693	That seems legit, yes.
3846158	3846879	So yeah, I mean...
3848922	3852566	I'm not even going to bother debating this stuff to death because we've done it already.
3852626	3863235	And I guarantee you with it, what, four weeks away, five weeks away from this reveal, we're probably going to have another fucking rumor article every goddamn week leading up to it.
3863375	3863635	Of course.
3863755	3872223	Because everybody wants to get those rumors out there because, God forbid, when actually the information comes out and they're wrong, they'll say, well, the details changed.
3873704	3874965	We got you that news.
3875085	3876626	No shit, they changed.
3877127	3881030	I was having a friendly debate on Twitter earlier this week with another podcaster.
3881490	3883251	Do you think they know the name?
3883952	3885653	I still don't think they know the name.
3887394	3888996	Xbox something.
3890056	3892779	I think it's going to be an Xbox something.
3893539	3896001	My reasoning for that is that a lot of times they go back.
3896021	3899944	I think with PlayStation that's another thing.
3900264	3901345	I think they're going to call it PlayStation 4.
3901545	3902146	It's a safe bet.
3902566	3922555	but in the case of Nintendo they didn't pick Wii U until really close to that press conference and you might remember at E3 that signage none of the signage said Wii U besides that logo at their press conference it always new Nintendo console so this Xbox they may still be I mean hey you gotta have a new name for this console you gotta go out in like two seconds here how about Chuck?
3922595	3924656	because that's what you're gonna do with it?
3926077	3931299	Wii U I'm just chucking in the trash stop
3932386	3936311	Have you made up your mind on the next Xbox without having seen the official word?
3936331	3937352	No, I was just being a smartass.
3937412	3937833	Oh, okay.
3937933	3938413	That's fair enough.
3942197	3943818	I've put this out there already before.
3944679	3950402	If it's got any sort of online only, even if it's for DRM, which I don't like the idea of that.
3951322	3957486	If it's going to prevent me from playing any of my games at all if I'm not connected to the internet, I'm not buying the console.
3957726	3962728	Because I'm not connected to the internet all the time at work where I play a lot of my games.
3963909	3965430	So it doesn't benefit me.
3965730	3972035	I don't have a need to do that when I can pick up another console or keep the console I have and have no problems with it.
3972055	3972755	I just thought of a good name.
3974016	3974796	The X-Tesseract.
3976477	3982021	And I'm going to say what I said before on this whole thing, too, is that, you know, what's the trade-off?
3982361	3984883	Because we know what PlayStation 4 is bringing to the table.
3984923	3986244	We know it will play used games.
3986284	3990987	We know it doesn't require the ping and all this stuff and, you know, the stuff they were showing in the press conference.
3993869	3997231	whatever's more strict system, what's the benefit?
3998231	3999252	What's going to be the trade-off?
3999512	4006435	And the other thing, too, is if these are... The only way they could get away with something like that is if both them and PlayStation were doing it.
4007356	4012038	And then, you know, theoretically, if you're going to say, oh, I have to buy... I have to.
4012158	4014559	I'm being held at gunpoint to buy a new system.
4015320	4017681	You know, then I guess I'll buy a Wii U or something.
4017901	4020062	And Nintendo's like, ah, yay!
4020222	4020502	But no.
4020822	4022243	I mean, seriously, I don't know...
4024708	4025108	I don't know.
4026849	4032911	Honestly, I don't think we'll hear anything about whether it's online only or whatever because they just won't talk about it.
4032951	4035311	They're not going to say, hey, there's DRM on this.
4035331	4036892	You're going to have to read between the lines on that.
4037492	4039773	It depends if they take questions from the press or not.
4040822	4043484	which I kind of think the executives will have to.
4043744	4044665	They'll have to address it.
4045126	4046847	I think they'll have to talk to investors.
4046887	4050470	I think there's going to be investors that want to know based on everything that happened on Twitter.
4051551	4052532	So, anyhow.
4053192	4055994	Let's talk about things that you really can do on Xbox right now.
4056055	4057456	This is a reality right now.
4057576	4060738	It's the new Pizza Hut app available on the Xbox 360.
4062600	4064281	Captain Spike, did you just perk up over there?
4065082	4068805	Yeah, well, you just gave me a reason to turn on my Xbox for the first time in like a month.
4071367	4074170	Well, you can actually order pizza online from your 360.
4074290	4083137	I haven't done this yet, but what I love about it is that it's got that same crossbar aesthetic that everything else on Xbox has.
4083658	4085259	You know what I mean?
4085279	4087141	Does it have Kinect functionality?
4087381	4088161	I bet it does.
4088582	4093946	Let me just use my hand to wave over to the extra bacon toppings.
4094307	4096689	I wish it had the stuff that Japanese pizzas do.
4096989	4098150	I want mayonnaise on my pizza.
4098604	4099265	You never know.
4099365	4099845	You never know.
4100326	4104109	Same when you remember the old anti-piracy ads from like five or ten years ago.
4105050	4107212	You wouldn't download a pizza.
4110195	4110776	Slash pizza.
4111557	4112277	Now you can.
4112898	4113739	It's a reality.
4115629	4115930	Awesome.
4117230	4121312	So yeah, you can order online through the app.
4121573	4126235	I haven't done this yet, but I'm assuming it's probably not much different than ordering online.
4126315	4127616	I have ordered a pizza online.
4128416	4129477	I think a lot of us have done that.
4129537	4131298	I imagine it's really not that much different than that.
4132638	4133899	So why not?
4133979	4138061	And I like this quote from Larry Erb in an interview with Polygon.
4138561	4139542	He's Major Nelson, of course.
4140202	4143403	We're always looking at ways to give our audience more of what they're interested in.
4143563	4145684	If you look at our audience, they love pizza.
4145904	4147265	I mean, who doesn't?
4148245	4153708	It has international appeal, and Pizza Hut is a recognized brand that matches up well with the Xbox brand.
4154687	4156368	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4180526	4180866	Pizzahot.com
4199534	4204217	There will be ways to download your food because they've already got biological printers.
4204237	4205758	What's to say they're not going to have food printers?
4206419	4209681	It's the... What is it from Star Trek?
4209701	4210181	The Replicator.
4210201	4211122	We're going to have Replicators.
4211282	4211803	Stop the world.
4211823	4212183	This is amazing.
4212203	4213484	You like food.
4216966	4220887	I thought the FBI went after people that tried to do this biological stuff.
4221247	4221547	Anyhow.
4240444	4243065	I want a replicator so I can go tea, Earl Grey, hot.
4243905	4245486	Even though I really hate Earl Grey tea.
4246446	4246826	Too hot!
4246846	4251907	I would like to tell you, Dungeon Buster, that the Romulan ale that you used to buy at the Star Trek Experience was lame!
4253888	4254848	Just get a warp core breach.
4254968	4255809	You won't feel your feet.
4256109	4256389	Mm-hmm.
4256649	4256889	Okay.
4258029	4258990	More news, DarkSakura.
4259370	4260010	Yeah, yeah.
4260410	4262891	So, Nintendo is... While you read this, I'm gonna go get tea.
4263191	4264831	Hey, Rob, get me some pizza, too, please.
4264931	4265252	Thank you.
4266012	4266272	Hearts...
4267165	4268607	Do I look like your bitch?
4269608	4270530	I just want to get served.
4272232	4273514	Oh, you're about to get served.
4274015	4275176	You're about to get served.
4276058	4277159	Hearts, love you, mean it.
4277800	4278401	Okay, anyway.
4278922	4283909	So, Nintendo is skipping E3 press conference.
4284326	4290488	They're going to be doing small conferences with direct material and they're trying a new presentation style.
4292188	4294429	So they're focusing on the software lineup for the U.S.
4294509	4302551	market and going to be doing closed events for American distributors and another closed hands-on event for the gaming media.
4303371	4304732	So yeah, they're like, E3!
4305982	4306202	No.
4308223	4322446	Also, from the last Nintendo Direct, they were putting out release dates for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS games with the Yoshi Island and the Mario Party and the Legend of Zelda Link to the Past sequel, which I totally want.
4323866	4331068	But they're just trying to do it in smaller groups, let it out so that everybody can be disappointed in increments.
4331880	4337383	I just... They did this last year with... They had the press conference and then they had three Nintendo Directs.
4337643	4341525	And it just... Such a waste of time.
4341785	4344667	It was just so... It wasn't like there was a ton of information.
4344687	4348509	It's just they drug it on for so long.
4348969	4351291	It's like, okay, here, we're going to talk about the 3DS.
4351851	4356273	Oh, and this one's about the Wii U. Oh, and this one's about the 3DS games that are for older kids.
4356594	4358655	And this one's about our press conference.
4359095	4359335	It's like...
4362220	4368050	Well, it says that they're actually trying to be, I guess, a little more direct with how they're giving the information.
4369389	4379078	But, I don't know, it just sort of does seem like kind of a snub at the whole E3, and especially since Rob said earlier, the feel of E3 has changed.
4379579	4383222	It doesn't seem quite like the big information source that it used to be.
4383602	4389408	It's turned into, look at our ads, look at the big circle thing that EA has in their booth every year.
4390368	4394012	You know, it's more about the flash and less about the information.
4394540	4396361	I think they just don't have anything new to show.
4398522	4400783	You don't think Nintendo has anything new to show?
4400963	4401684	Yes, I do.
4401824	4404385	This is a make or break year for Nintendo.
4404725	4404985	Yeah.
4405045	4405866	As far as that Wii U is concerned.
4405886	4409008	And how well have they done so far in the first third of the year?
4409948	4411829	Oh, fantastic.
4411869	4414610	They're really edging on the break side of Nintendo.
4414991	4421214	We could go three years ago on this very show and replace the word Wii U with 3DS and it would be the same conversation.
4421980	4428362	Yeah, and it took them a year to pull it around, and a price drop almost immediately.
4428443	4430043	And who's to say that's not going to happen again?
4431144	4432104	I don't think it's going to happen again.
4433645	4435045	Here's why I don't think it's going to happen again.
4435085	4439187	It's because their 3DS is doing well, and they're making plenty of profit from that.
4439327	4442288	So they don't really give a shit right now that the Wii U is not doing well.
4443168	4469457	I kind of like this was one of those articles I read it it was all over Twitter and I was like wow that's really weird and then I go well you know that makes a lot of sense like people really just you know they've dumped on those Nintendo press conferences and I think that the element of the game of press conferences and so forth has changed they don't have a new console to show they only want to show games and you you said it yourself a minute ago people don't want to sit through all this other crap that they don't care about and
4469677	4471798	Give me the information targeted at me.
4472318	4472898	Thank you very much.
4472939	4473219	Good night.
4485544	4502275	you know, the 25 year anniversary of Luigi no one gives a shit, especially when you go on about it long, long, long time and you're like, oh by the way, we don't actually have any really new games for Luigi other than the already announced Luigi's Mansion game for 3DS but we have DLC for a Mario game!
4503275	4504095	Sweet!
4504155	4505056	That's sort of Luigi.
4505076	4508037	That's almost like a new game, but not.
4508457	4511718	See, we understand online because we put out DLC.
4512178	4513098	We're hip, we're cool.
4513398	4514839	We're just like those other consoles.
4515199	4515679	Love us.
4518140	4520261	I just don't think they have anything new to show.
4520901	4526323	The stuff they were talking about releasing first quarter of this year hasn't come out yet.
4526483	4529644	We're talking third quarter when that stuff is finally hitting the market.
4530624	4536536	So really the only new thing, if you call it new, is going to be the HD remake of Wind Waker.
4537238	4539242	And maybe one more game, but...
4540307	4563856	that's it they don't really have much to announce are they really going to talk about Pikmin again or Wii Fit U again or you know they have 3DS games which if you know they have a ton of 3DS games coming out so no worries there but as far as the Wii U goes they don't really have anything to show Spike I want to come to you with this because I know you've been following this stuff a very long time as well and probably are going to say something about it on your own show what do you think of Loki's on the right track
4565236	4572004	Well, I mean, you know, we know that they have a Mario Universe, as we're all expecting it to be called.
4572785	4577310	And Kart 8, they've already said those are going to be playable on the floor at E3.
4578351	4579753	And, you know, they said they're going to show...
4580934	4584536	The new Smash Brothers game in video and picture form.
4585357	4589079	So they have some things to show, but I don't think they have a great deal to show.
4589320	4593943	I think this is probably a good choice for them to do sort of a scaled down presentation.
4593963	4599046	I kind of have to agree after the floptasticness of the last couple of E3 conferences.
4600509	4609953	You know, and again, I appreciated at last year's E3, for example, that Nintendo took a lot of time to talk about game mechanics and game design of Nintendo Land, of all things.
4610033	4613935	But still, at least they were talking about game design rather than boobs and explosions, I guess.
4617696	4620517	If they did talk about boosts and explosions, I think they'd sell more consoles.
4621538	4623018	Sad commentary on games.
4623038	4623979	That sounds like my house.
4624619	4626340	You do know it has Bayonetta 2, right?
4627240	4627880	Eventually.
4628440	4628981	No, seriously.
4629121	4630761	I mean, that's the problem with Nintendo.
4630821	4634282	They talk a big game like how we're going to target the core audience.
4634623	4640325	We're going to target those older people that want to play games on the Wii U and stuff.
4640465	4643326	And it's fucking child game, child game, child game, child game.
4643406	4643866	Mario.
4644346	4645427	I mean, Mario sells.
4645507	4648149	It's, you know, for everybody, I guess.
4648189	4651352	But there are no real... I don't think they take it seriously.
4651432	4659838	They just kind of... You know, this time around, they said, okay, listen, we're not going to put on a lot of games right now, first quarter, because we're going to let third parties kind of shine, I guess.
4659938	4660439	And then, pfft.
4661159	4666904	Wow, that amazing Spider-Man game from last year really shone on your console.
4666964	4670066	And, oh, Need for Speed Most Wanted that came out back in the fall.
4670486	4670847	Woo!
4670907	4672988	That's awesome now, coming out in March.
4673129	4673389	You know...
4673889	4680535	It's the definitive version now because it's... Well, you know, Nintendo couldn't expect that Ubisoft was going to be like, LOL, bye bitch.
4681076	4685620	I still think that they're making a big mistake making Bayonetta 2 a Wii U exclusive.
4686601	4687081	Sega is.
4688823	4689724	I think they're going to lose on it.
4691229	4693212	It wouldn't exist without Nintendo though.
4693352	4695135	Yeah, Nintendo's the one that brought it back.
4695155	4697798	But at the same time, Sega has taken a lot of risks on the Wii.
4697838	4703266	I mean, look, they put out Mad World and stuff, and Mad World's a pretty awesome game, but it's also an awesome game that didn't sell very well.
4703686	4707191	And also, The Conduit was another Sega game that they put out.
4707231	4707832	I think that was Sega.
4709072	4710053	I think that was Sega.
4710373	4711113	Maybe, I don't know.
4711733	4714674	But once again, another game that didn't sell well at all.
4715414	4719755	I just want to clarify, I don't think Sega's involved in Bayonetta 2, right?
4719775	4720536	They're not publishing it.
4720676	4721636	But they own the IP.
4721696	4724537	They are part of the licensing for the game to exist.
4724657	4726197	But Nintendo's bankrolling it.
4726277	4732419	Platinum's been very open about the fact that without Nintendo's involvement, this game just wouldn't exist.
4735220	4737001	There you go, Bayonetta and Smash Brothers.
4738402	4739222	It's enough for me.
4740603	4742584	Right?
4742644	4749227	As much as I love Bayonetta, it's not enough for me to go out and get a Wii U because honestly, the Wii U just does not bring that much new to the table.
4749347	4751208	Oh yeah, we have a tablet, yay.
4751888	4758031	But if they put out Bayonetta 2 on multi-systems, hell yeah, I would buy it.
4758992	4761993	I'm just saying, there's a lot of people who would have been into it.
4763979	4765580	I think it's going to be a repeat of the 3DS.
4766020	4767541	I think it's going to be fine come holidays.
4768181	4771423	Maybe I'll be wrong, but I think it's going to be just fine during the holidays.
4775005	4775525	I hope so.
4775845	4782149	I mean, I don't want to see them fail, but at the same time, it's been a console that there's no reason for me to buy that system.
4782209	4783830	There's nothing that really wowed me about it.
4784170	4786671	The 3DS is like, oh, hey, 3D games without glasses.
4786691	4787432	That's kind of cool.
4788052	4791074	Playing on the second screen, I don't really give a shit about that.
4791454	4793215	It's not that big a deal.
4793655	4799663	The one game I was excited about apparently sucks, so tank, tank, tank.
4800063	4805190	We've been playing on two screens for how long now with the DS, so that's not really a new thing.
4805555	4816620	I think the big difference between the 3DS and the Wii U in terms of positioning is that the 3DS sort of owns handheld right now, at least in the US.
4816680	4818601	I mean, there's the PSP, but that's it.
4818741	4821182	It's the PSP and the Vita.
4821362	4822603	I'm sorry, the Vita.
4823684	4824324	But who owns a Vita?
4825225	4842746	and the 3DS but the Wii U is coming online a year before a very crowded console market is launching a brand new generation of consoles and it doesn't seem to be in the same league hardware wise as the others which is going to make multi-platform development difficult but neither was the Wii
4843146	4851190	And also when you consider though that they're saying that now a lot of that's, you know, the market's kind of going to the handhelds and phones and tablets and that kind of thing.
4851210	4855993	And so if you own the handheld market, who gives a crap if your console's not really doing that well?
4856033	4859315	Because those people probably have a 3DS and they're fine.
4860075	4862677	Or, you know, they can buy a 3DS.
4863437	4866919	Alright, in the interest of time, and I feel like we've had this conversation before, let's move on with the stories.
4868200	4870301	All right, so let's see.
4870421	4878064	Let's talk a little bit about where we used to... As we've said, it hasn't been doing that well.
4878164	4889008	In fact, they have missed their target, which was just about 3.5 million units, and they missed it by 500,000, if I remember correctly.
4890970	4903264	um they are targeting though for the next fiscal year nine million units so they're really gonna have to pick up the pace if that's gonna happen um i want to say that they've only sold um
4905320	4908141	I think it was like 390,000 units just over the last few months.
4910202	4914244	I think the first three months were 390,000 units, if I remember correctly.
4916645	4918746	And of course, 3DS is rocking.
4918907	4922068	They're up to 31.09 million units.
4923949	4928431	And the Wii's still getting close to 100 million, 99.84 million.
4928451	4929271	That's a lot of systems.
4933133	4961199	that's gotta disappoint them that they've only been able to sell 3. almost 3.5 million when there's 99 million Wii owners out there that's no penetration and on top of that Satoru Iwata he is now the CEO the Nintendo of America CEO and just to be clear Reggie Fils-AimÃ© was not overthrown or anything like that he's still there yeah yeah
4963047	4967990	I'm assuming this is more to kind of try to bring the two together so that the two don't operate in different silos.
4968070	4970571	That's my thought as a corporate move like this.
4971571	4973652	Well, Wanda's been definitely more up front.
4974033	4978175	He's been kind of the figure in all those Nintendo Directs and stuff.
4980143	4980583	and DarkSakura.com.
5008803	5038031	so you could infer that Mario 3D and Mario Kart Wii U these are not titles to be shown for 2014 these are titles to be shown for the holiday release running down the list real quick just so we're clear these are games that Nintendo says in the next few months Mario Kart for Wii U Super Mario Brothers for Wii U Wii Fit for Wii U which has kind of fallen off the radar but that's kind of one of those games they were pitching that in the beginning and it disappeared so it's kind of another one of those games that you know oh now you see it now you don't but Wii Fit could be interesting depending on what they do with it
5038331	5039932	That could be an interesting game changer.
5040753	5041153	Pikmin.
5041513	5042133	Which is August.
5042353	5043434	Which we knew that's happening.
5044014	5046276	Legend of Zelda, Wii U and Nintendo 3DS.
5047016	5048137	And I'm assuming that's Wind Waker.
5048157	5050998	That's Wind Waker and the new... Link to the Past.
5051018	5051679	Yeah, Link to the Past.
5052059	5055621	And Mario and Luigi on the 3DS and Pokemon X and Y, obviously.
5055741	5055881	Yeah.
5056341	5060424	So that's... You're pretty much looking at Nintendo's holiday lineup right there.
5060644	5065567	I mean, there might be one or two other surprises here, but that's, you know... That's in a nutshell.
5065587	5067388	That better not be another new Super Mario Bros.
5067408	5067588	game.
5069179	5073884	Oh no, I think it's going to be like you were saying a minute ago, kind of like a Galaxy type thing.
5074165	5084217	Well, they had said that they intended last year to stick to doing the sort of one new title per generation and just expanding those with DLC like we're seeing with the Luigi DLC.
5086239	5088122	I just hope it's not another new Super Mario Bros.
5088162	5088342	game.
5090126	5092328	or anything that resembles that.
5092548	5103635	I think the Luigi DLC should tell you it's not another Super Mario X game because why would they waste all the effort to do that to just turn around literally four months later and say, and now it's a new game.
5103735	5106937	I don't see that happening.
5107058	5114002	It's going to be a 3D Mario, whether it's Universe, whether it's Mario 64-esque or Sunshine for fuck's sake.
5114863	5115844	It's going to be something of that vein.
5117024	5117965	Sunshine Lowell.
5120026	5121047	I could see them doing it, though.
5121307	5124709	I mean, just... Why not a new Luigi game, then?
5124929	5130533	Because we can do DLC and just easily shoehorn it into the... Maybe that's why they keep hyping this Luigi.
5130573	5133154	Maybe the new game is Super Luigi Galaxy or something.
5133195	5133995	Maybe that's the twist.
5134035	5135176	And no one will buy it.
5135296	5136316	No one will buy it.
5136497	5139799	This whole thing has let... What do you mean no one will buy Super Luigi Galaxy?
5139819	5140059	Okay.
5140539	5142220	One person will buy it, but no one else will buy it.
5142240	5143581	Are you smoking crank?
5143962	5148305	Because Mario Galaxy was like one of the best games they put out on the Wii, period.
5148885	5152788	I'm not talking about just reskin with Luigi.
5152848	5160413	I'm talking about a new game in that universe and everything, but Luigi happens to be the star because it's the year of Luigi.
5160713	5161434	And that's the joke.
5162574	5166076	That's why you haven't seen anything else because the bombshell is going to get dropped at E3.
5166216	5168357	No one should make jokes when your system is suffering like that.
5169238	5170318	This is not time for joking.
5170339	5175321	This is time for kicking ass.
5175562	5176002	I'm done.
5176202	5176922	DarkSakura, save me.
5177303	5178243	Are you spent, Rob?
5178323	5178883	I'm spent.
5179224	5181045	I found a contest that I'm going to be in now.
5182305	5182405	Oh?
5182686	5184267	Well, you found it for me, but I'm going to do it.
5186428	5187989	Because Rob does all my hard work for me.
5188009	5189249	Okay, then as your agent, I want 20%.
5191298	5193880	As my agent, I'll just keep buying you coffee.
5194100	5194520	That works.
5195100	5203966	Speaking of which, so Sega has a thing now where they're wanting people to design a new character to be the face of the company.
5204926	5206407	You know, not Sonic, just...
5206927	5226834	A new mascot And the contest is open through June 9th this year And it has to be an original character And there's a link on I can get the link later But it's also not just limited to the Japanese audience It's worldwide
5227546	5238912	which I'm gonna get the hell out of this so basically they're gonna be doing a new live web series called Sega Raw on Nico Nico
5239614	5241275	But that's what the mascot's for.
5241335	5242195	It's for the show.
5242855	5245577	So I'm not giving you guys my ideas.
5246737	5247677	No.
5248378	5257461	But they want something unique, something fun, something that's going to basically fit what they're trying to do.
5257501	5258142	Because the show...
5259643	5279416	is uh i'm trying to find something and basically it's yeah just going to be um more of a fan show and there's translations for the rules up so uh you just need a Nico Nico account and there is an english version um on the website to sign up for that and so i will uh let me get the url if you go to uh
5280973	5288477	It's actually seiga.nicovideo.jp There should be a link from there.
5288577	5290739	And I will post the link in the chat room for people here.
5291499	5293801	Because maybe Sega will hire me.
5294821	5296422	Got a great idea for a Sega character.
5296542	5299724	It's like Sonic the Hedgehog, but he's black and he's got guns.
5299904	5301125	Oh, shut up.
5301721	5311533	Well, I wouldn't give out too many of these ideas because coming up in part B of Orange Lawns Radio tonight, we are going to do a list list.
5312134	5313816	I can't participate, Rob.
5313936	5314276	Why not?
5314336	5315999	Because I'm not giving anybody my ideas.
5316179	5316900	Tough shit.
5317020	5318622	Oh, and he's going to be named Shadow.
5319642	5320483	Shadow of the Hedgehog.
5320563	5321303	Here's the deal.
5321423	5329248	The topic for tonight's list is mascot we most want to gift to Sega on behalf of OLR.
5329628	5332170	So mascot we most want to gift to Sega on behalf of OLR.
5332230	5333110	Don't send your answers yet.
5333150	5333770	Just think about it.
5333810	5336452	We'll come back to this in part B. By the way, a little bit more to this.
5337393	5341555	If you want to find those translated rules, look for Yakuza fan at NeoGAF.
5345461	5347583	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
5347763	5348403	Do we gotta?
5349564	5349944	We gotta.
5351145	5357870	Well, this week, there's Deadly Permission, The Director's Cut on PlayStation 3, and Soul Sacrifice on the Vita.
5358690	5366856	Also, on PC, Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Network, Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon.
5367416	5368697	That's really the only game you need to buy.
5373291	5373851	Game ga arimasen
5402555	5405179	Trying to look quickly at Vita or the handhelds?
5405380	5407023	Is it just a dry spell this week?
5407784	5408365	Wii U?
5409126	5409727	Question mark?
5412145	5414527	No, I'm showing it's a dry spell in Japan this week.
5414928	5415448	You know why?
5415748	5415949	Why?
5416449	5417250	It's because they're afraid.
5417270	5418331	Know what they're afraid of?
5418911	5422875	Three brand new fucking trailers for Grand Theft Auto V on the 30th.
5423115	5423556	That's right.
5423816	5425197	That's all you need to do that day.
5425457	5432644	It's my wedding anniversary and I'm going out and eating lunch, but I'm coming back and I'm fucking watching those trailers over and over and over again.
5432987	5435128	Can we get you a shirt that said game over?
5435308	5437129	Are you going to make Nellie watch them with you?
5438230	5438650	Should I?
5438790	5439030	Yes.
5439070	5439851	Does she get into it?
5440091	5440291	No.
5440571	5440751	No?
5441112	5442112	She could care less.
5442152	5443613	I would think she'd think it's hilarious.
5443633	5449316	We need to pick the most violent, bloody, gory game ever and have Nellie and your mom review it.
5450777	5453719	My wife wouldn't like it, not because it's bloody, but because it's a game.
5454673	5455894	That would be the best review ever.
5478877	5481238	I found a game coming out on May 9th.
5481578	5482719	That's the closest game release.
5482799	5483579	That's like two weeks.
5483920	5485160	It's on the PSP.
5486321	5490483	Cud Wafter Converted Edition comes out on the PSP.
5491143	5495166	And the box art is just a girl and she's sitting at the table with her elbows on the table.
5495446	5496206	She's just waiting.
5496886	5498967	Like the rest of us for Japanese release dates.
5498988	5503350	That's like 90% of all PSP games in Japan.
5503630	5505251	A chick with her arms folded waiting.
5505271	5505571	Yeah.
5506369	5507489	Can you say the name of that again?
5508650	5514411	K-U-D-W-A-F-T-E-R To me it's Kudwafter, but it's probably Kud... Wafter.
5514571	5515292	It's German.
5516152	5517912	Oh, that almost sounded dirty.
5518953	5520413	Everything in German sounds dirty.
5520713	5522534	You can say strudel and it sounds dirty.
5523014	5523794	Kudwafer.
5523874	5527555	It's about, you know, crackers that cows chew on.
5527835	5531456	Then let's go to the Old Kingdom and see what's coming out over there.
5531880	5534322	I would like to go find out personally, but unfortunately I'm poor.
5534962	5537084	So, God, I'm not even ready, Rob.
5537244	5537824	What's up with me?
5539145	5540586	Amy, I thought you didn't come to the show prepared.
5540686	5541027	Girl!
5542568	5542888	Hold on.
5542988	5544629	Oh, no wonder, because you linked me the wrong month.
5546531	5547311	They're your links!
5547852	5548532	I blame you!
5548712	5549473	I blame you for everything.
5552461	5554363	Oh, Slagkick looked up what this is.
5556105	5557367	Kudwafter or whatever.
5557467	5563734	It's a Japanese adult visual novel developed by Key, released on June 25th, 2010 for Windows PC.
5563814	5565115	So I guess it's the PSP version.
5565195	5567378	And the cover sounded like one.
5568059	5568639	Oh, yeah.
5568719	5571322	Like, when I first looked at that, I was like, oh, she gonna get naked.
5573392	5574173	Oh, it's a moe game.
5574193	5576155	She looks too young.
5576175	5579398	I mean, that button on her head is, like, huge.
5579638	5582200	I was just thinking, does she smell like Kudzu?
5582380	5582581	No.
5583341	5589507	And FifthDream in our chatroom says, cunt waiter, I've had a few of those.
5593002	5596166	I worked for one of the... I'm just gonna... You win.
5596527	5597528	Alright, moving on.
5597768	5601032	On May 1st, we have Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon.
5601733	5602895	I was still thinking about getting it.
5602975	5604256	Injustice Gods Among Us.
5604437	5605278	Game is fucking weird.
5605878	5609002	Soul Sacrifice on Vita and Fez on PC.
5609803	5610945	Now I'm thinking of the Doctor.
5612441	5612962	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
5628417	5631058	So you're going to hate an entire fucking game because the hair was wrong?
5631078	5631438	You know.
5631638	5632438	It's DC.
5632518	5633458	I hate everything.
5633858	5638579	You know, Jamie, there is DLC that could probably fix that.
5638639	5640380	I mean, I'm sure she's got numerous outfits.
5640420	5642680	Well, they could, you know, DLC to make her Jean Grey?
5642700	5642740	No.
5644281	5645281	Then she would be awesome?
5645981	5648022	Okay, I will stop and say this.
5648682	5654123	I love Wonder Woman and I like Batman, although I cannot read anything Batman-related that Gail Simone doesn't write.
5655450	5656111	She is my hero.
5656471	5660315	But I did read Blackest Night with the whole Star Sapphire thing and that was pretty hot.
5661557	5661777	There.
5662178	5663539	My one nod to DC.
5668625	5668905	That's it.
5669955	5673317	Alright, so, movies.
5673897	5675198	Sony likes movies, right?
5675478	5680541	So Sony said, hey, why don't we take some of our franchises and make them into movies?
5680821	5682402	Sound like a fantastic idea?
5682682	5683583	Well, it is.
5684503	5684984	According to them.
5685924	5710027	Ratchet and Clank coming to theaters in 2015 and it's actually being done by animation company Rainmaker Entertainment and I guess the digital media studio Blockade Entertainment and I guess they produced CG was a flick Escape from Planet Earth I have no idea what the fuck that is but they made that movie so they've made a movie before
5711903	5735822	uh and then Heavenly Sword is going to be coming to becoming a movie as well except it's direct-to-video because you know obviously a game this important that never had a sequel cannot be going in the theaters because no one would know what the fuck it is and so direct-to-video it goes also being done by Blockade Entertainment what are you laughing at over there?
5735842	5736683	stop it
5740063	5741963	That's like Pee Wee Herman's secret word.
5743924	5745784	Today's word is Kudwafter.
5749745	5750305	Oh, boy.
5750325	5751265	I don't know.
5751305	5752046	Heavenly Sword?
5752786	5759087	It just... I guess because God of War would have been too good?
5759107	5761168	I don't really know why.
5761828	5765048	I think I would rather see a Kudwafter movie than Heavenly Sword, though.
5765068	5767769	Like, a Heavenly Sword movie sounds like something that, you know...
5769497	5770438	Uwe Boll would do.
5770818	5774100	I mean, because... He says, I don't know if he's made any movies lately.
5777242	5779623	No, I think he's been laughed out of Hollywood completely.
5780323	5782184	Yeah, he's laughing all the way to the bank.
5782565	5784766	Because he's banked a lot of money.
5786967	5788728	Ratchet and Clank sounds like it could be cute, though.
5788848	5790349	That, I think, could work.
5790389	5791590	Anime is the way to go, yeah.
5792310	5795132	I mean, after all, Angry Birds are getting a movie.
5795272	5795432	Mm-hmm.
5797709	5797929	How?
5798530	5799572	They have cartoons.
5799932	5803037	They commit suicide by launching themselves at pigs.
5804639	5805921	But they'll do well in the Middle East.
5807803	5809024	I'm done, bye
5832944	5851723	But here's the thing, under their new system, you will have to pay to have your scores reviewed Which, you know, it does make sense though, because legitimately they're looking through all the footage And they're watching it, and that takes hours at a time That just means Billy Mitchell's gonna pay extra Review mine first, and eat my barbecue sauce
5851943	5853545	Perhaps.
5853926	5858532	$25 for one submission, $60 for three submissions, $75 for five submissions.
5858873	5862378	But I believe based on the length, that might count as more than one submission.
5862618	5863940	That's what she said.
5864701	5866223	What'd you say over there?
5866804	5867565	That bears repeating.
5868305	5869827	Say it into a mic or don't say it at all.
5870107	5871128	That's what she said.
5871288	5871868	Thank you very much.
5873490	5878474	Anyhow, each video can only do one game, although you can do more than one score in the video.
5878494	5879515	That makes no sense to me.
5879815	5881656	Unless it was two different settings, maybe.
5882077	5885560	Because why would you show one score and then a better score?
5885740	5886560	Just do the one score.
5887701	5888142	Whatever.
5889403	5889863	So there you go.
5891024	5891765	Twin Galaxies.
5891865	5893766	You can submit your score for $25.
5896028	5896388	I don't know.
5896689	5904274	There's been some stuff going around saying that because now they're under new ownership that it's not quite as respectable anymore.
5907636	5908837	That happens with any company.
5908857	5913661	And also apparently, I don't know if their database crashed or something, but they lost some of the scores.
5914281	5917443	It did, but I'm glad you brought that up because they did comment on it.
5918384	5922367	They said the old database was damaged but not completely irretrievable.
5923988	5925349	So I guess they got some of it back.
5930616	5950396	but I'm glad that still exists because there's still lots of fans of the very classic arcade games out there and they're still playing them people are still breaking Donkey Kong score records so I'm glad something like this exists alright well speaking of classic games every week here on Orange Lounge Radio we like to take a trip down memory lane and visit the classic game of the week
5952714	5965717	This is the part of the show where DarkSakura is going to jump into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, record this for two hours and then pay me 25 bucks for telling you how awesome it was.
5966438	5967938	DarkSakura, what's the classic game of the week?
5969538	5971199	Okay, no, I can't even do it, Rob.
5971259	5973660	I can't do it because you have to start the music.
5974360	5974880	Fair enough.
5975160	5977200	Here's the music for the classic game of the week.
5977220	5979081	And then I'm going to shoot myself in the head.
5984184	5985986	How has this never been the classic game of the week?
5986026	5986927	I have no fucking clue.
5986947	5988028	This has been a joke forever on OLR.
5988048	5988508	I love this song.
5988568	5989249	I have no fucking clue.
5989269	5992372	Well, I was gonna put in Ridge Racer, and I was like, have I done Ridge Racer?
5992392	5994194	Have I done... Oh my god, I haven't done Daytona.
5994474	6000180	And Dan has been playing the shit out of Daytona, so I hear do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do in my nightmares.
6001160	6002382	Wait, you mean you hear this?
6005205	6005545	You know what?
6005645	6008167	I have a napkin and I can make it into at least 11.
6009048	6016554	Somebody out there on the internet, if they haven't done it already, needs to do like a dubstep remix of this song because that would be the most hilarious thing ever.
6016594	6023479	There is a video of the guy who sang for AM2 singing the song live and he just looks like he is having the time of his life.
6023979	6027342	Like, it's better than chocolate and...
6029508	6030609	Getting Laid, I guess.
6031370	6032671	But it was pretty funny.
6032931	6034272	Anyway, okay, so Daytona USA.
6034492	6038575	And by the way, the other song I put in was the classic Rolling Start.
6038635	6039536	Let me play a little bit of that.
6039596	6043879	We can hear this, or as I call it, Roaring Star.
6047422	6047962	Oh, no, no, no.
6048563	6051405	Okay, I have to tell where all of my hate for this game comes from.
6051665	6053026	And it's not because it's a bad game.
6053066	6056349	If it was a bad game, it would not be on my classic game of the week list.
6057050	6058230	I worked for an Amco arcade.
6059111	6064076	We had Time Crisis, we had Ridge Racer, we had Tekken 3 before everybody else did.
6064716	6069981	I had a Pac-Man hat, I had a Polar camera that I got from all the leftover tickets that the kids would leave in the machine.
6070742	6074365	And I had like 10 Tekken 3 shirts, like the arcade only ones.
6074865	6078609	I loved working there, except for this one machine right across from the ticket counter.
6079229	6081371	And it would always be in loud attract mode.
6081770	6083972	Oh, that was an awful one.
6105549	6108373	The voice acting was hideous.
6108754	6109254	Oh my god.
6109795	6111838	So anyway, back to the game.
6112439	6113260	It is a racing game.
6113320	6116604	It was developed by Sega AM2, which we love AM2.
6117867	6120248	I mean, AM2 gave us freaking Burning Rangers.
6120888	6122269	Hi, same guy singing by the way.
6123629	6128851	So, it came out as a limited release in 1993 and a full release in 1994.
6129571	6133192	And it is one of the highest grossing arcade machines of all time.
6134013	6137174	It was the first title that came out on the Model 2 arcade board.
6137634	6139475	Which is easily emulated now.
6140515	6145436	And it was pretty much the best racing machine that came out at the time.
6145916	6153138	It was lower poly than Virtua Racing, but it was fully texture mapped so it gave it more of a realistic feel.
6153579	6157400	Except it had serious draw-in problems like, oh, I'm driving on clouds.
6157540	6158260	Oh, look, there's a mountain.
6158920	6160181	Oh, look, there's Sonic's face.
6160961	6161241	You know?
6162082	6172526	But they did re-release the game as... Oh, one thing I actually have to say, it's actually one of the few 3D games at the time that maintained a steady 60 frames per second frame rate.
6172987	6177429	So that's pretty crazy, given that I can't get that on some games most of the time.
6178890	6183473	So it was re-released in 2010 as Sega Racing Classic, but I don't know if anyone has played it.
6184033	6185855	They took out the vocals.
6186675	6190878	It just has some sort of generic singing over it, like it was some background vocal.
6191358	6194401	But the main lyric part of it, it's like you're playing karaoke mode.
6194921	6195942	So it's just not the same.
6196602	6206029	So you are in a stock car called the Hornet, and you have to race three tracks, either automatic or manual.
6206129	6207250	Choose your transmission.
6208010	6212952	and, uh, it, uh, you know, you had different ways the camera could look.
6212972	6215032	You could look, um, behind the driver's seat.
6215052	6219694	You could be, uh, you know, uh, a very first person.
6220014	6228257	And there were deluxe cabins because, um, I played Daytona USA, um, the first time I played this game was in Las Vegas.
6228857	6231498	This is when I was still living in Alabama and my mom lived in Phoenix.
6232118	6237681	We flew to Phoenix and then drove to Las Vegas and they had the full multi-car setup.
6237801	6239461	And I was like, oh.
6239842	6241642	It was when the Luxor had a Sega arcade.
6242543	6247485	So I was completely in heaven and I paid the five bucks a game to play it twice.
6248305	6251406	And my mom was screaming at me for my fiscal irresponsibility.
6252067	6252547	So, um...
6254289	6256310	I loved it then, hated it when I worked at an arcade.
6257070	6259391	So yeah, it was really awesome.
6260271	6272694	And they actually came out before there was the Daytona USA Museum, but it had all that attached to it.
6274115	6278256	I think it was that it came out as Sega Racing Classic because they lost the Daytona license.
6280608	6291732	So basically, the Sega Racing Classic runs at 720p, and like I said, it lost the vocal charts because of the licensing.
6292112	6296434	Now for the home versions, there was a Daytona USA that came out on Saturn in 1995, and Twindos in 1996.
6299615	6307301	It did drop the frame rates significantly, about 20 frames per second, and clipped pretty nasty.
6307501	6309683	It was not the best version.
6311184	6316828	However, it handled well, and they had planned on doing one on the 32X, but we all know what happened with the 32X.
6316949	6319390	At least we got space here, you're right.
6320371	6334933	so there were 8 tracks including the original 3 from the arcade and 2 additional tracks from the Sega Championship Circuit Edition and then there were final 3 and that was for the Dreamcast version which the Dreamcast version was pretty good
6336730	6340373	They completely redid all of the graphics.
6340453	6342175	The pop-up was removed.
6342515	6345058	The cars had transparent glass, higher poly.
6345138	6350263	It was basically like the HD version, except it controlled like shit.
6350283	6351645	Just saying.
6352245	6354466	I guess you can't have it all, huh?
6354506	6360650	They did an arcade faithful port for PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade.
6361531	6366474	And it has widescreen, high def, 8 player multiplayer over Xbox Live or the PlayStation Network.
6368075	6369936	More content with different challenges.
6369976	6377701	Karaoke mode, which I am embarrassed to say my husband has sat in karaoke mode singing Roaring Start.
6378481	6379302	Because he's awesome.
6380117	6381417	Because my husband's a big dork.
6381437	6382458	Dan, you're awesome.
6382818	6383658	Dan's not even listening.
6383698	6384738	He's watching Chair of Swords.
6385819	6387799	With the German chocolate cake and Mystique.
6388700	6392601	Well, we have pizza and Spike and Tim, so... Yeah.
6392861	6393181	Yeah.
6393961	6395382	So, do-do-do-do-do-do you.
6399363	6401664	And I challenge everyone to say that to a friend this week.
6401744	6403564	Well, do-do-do-do-do-do you.
6406423	6407223	Anyway, anyway.
6409284	6412466	So yeah, you had, in the Sega Saturn version, you had unlockable cars.
6412506	6422251	You had the red or blue and yellow and the black version, depending on what transmission you picked in the arcade version and in the Saturn version.
6425826	6451470	and basically, like I was saying, now the singer and this is what I was talking about earlier about AM2 doing the game is that AM2 had their own sound division as well and it was Takenobu Mitsuyoshi who was doing the singing and the tracks are Let's Go Away and The King of Speed, which is the roaring start Pounding Pavement, Let's Go Away, which is the attract mode
6453031	6458577	and Sky High, which is actually my favorite music in that game because I want to fry Sky High.
6460951	6481937	So in the arcade version also used a Yamaha sound chip that completely just redid, made the music sound really good, really professional, but they had to re-record it for the Saturn version because the music was actually synthesized in-game with the vocals playing over it.
6482077	6485378	So yeah, it's Daytona USA.
6485818	6487258	And I'm not doing it again.
6488238	6488738	I'm done.
6489019	6489319	I will.
6489559	6489719	Oh...
6492992	6496794	By the way, you can also play as the car in Fighter's Mega Mix.
6497094	6497375	Awesome.
6498675	6501917	There it is, your classic game of the week, Daytona.
6502697	6503178	Good pick.
6503898	6504879	It's about time, honestly.
6504999	6507060	I have a recommendation for a classic game of the week.
6507540	6508361	Super Mario Bros.
6508581	6508361	3.
6509241	6511002	I think she did it a long time ago.
6511703	6512203	And World.
6512823	6515705	She's been doing this segment since episode 180-something, I think.
6515765	6516245	And we're on 502?
6516585	6518847	No, no, 200-something, I think.
6518887	6519587	Something like that.
6519927	6520988	You've had several segments.
6521069	6521989	It's changed a few times.
6522030	6523531	Classic Game of the Week started around 200 something.
6523551	6528136	But we stopped doing Website of the Week when I did one site twice.
6528456	6528697	Yeah.
6528937	6529898	Because I couldn't really think of any.
6529918	6530559	What was the site?
6530639	6533562	You did one Classic Game twice, and that didn't stop you.
6533982	6534543	What did I do?
6534763	6536025	You did Final Fantasy VI twice.
6536085	6539268	But I mean, if you're going to do any game twice... Okay, one was three, one was six.
6539408	6540670	There, I did versions.
6541210	6541751	Don't judge me.
6542907	6546349	I don't want to do Sega Rally because it's very hard easy left.
6546749	6547809	Wait, maybe.
6547889	6548449	All right, look.
6549570	6550190	Long show.
6550390	6551531	We've got to take a break.
6551591	6552251	We're going to come back.
6552331	6553392	We have rapid fire news.
6553732	6555252	Fugle Question of the Week coming as well.
6555733	6556833	Some more news stories for you guys.
6556853	6558254	And as we promised, list lists.
6558634	6562316	What mascot are we going to gift to Sega just out of the goodness of our hearts?
6562376	6566477	What do you the listeners want us to gift to Sega for their mascot competition?
6567318	6569839	We will beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
6570922	6573723	Right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
6580766	6587108	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live on this, I almost said Friday night.
6588089	6589369	I wish the weekend was starting over.
6589469	6592810	Sunday night, April the 28th of 2013.
6593431	6598873	And joined in studio tonight with Captain Spike from the Game Buoy podcast at GameBuoy.org.
6601127	6601647	Ahoy.
6601747	6610250	We were talking about, you and I were talking, I won't spoil it on the show, but you and I were talking about some potential upcoming topics that you're going to get into on your show, and I was like, oh, that's real good.
6610650	6611150	That's real good.
6612230	6614291	If I don't steal them for OLR 503.
6614671	6615792	Rude.
6616212	6616972	And ignorant.
6617112	6618152	I would never, I would never.
6618852	6622434	Also joining us tonight, Tim, who is on his very first podcast.
6622774	6623174	What up?
6623474	6624334	Are you having a good time?
6624374	6625294	Is it more fun than you thought it would?
6625354	6626755	It's less terrifying than I imagined.
6626915	6627155	Yeah?
6627435	6627615	Yeah.
6627695	6630096	Well, it helps that it's like in, like, literally...
6630476	6636139	Literally the corner of my apartment and not like a studio with lights everywhere.
6636859	6641722	People think that this show, because it's so damn old, people think that we have this recording space.
6642102	6649166	Or maybe because there's certain other podcasters out there that put out that perception that you need $35,000 to do a gaming podcast.
6649626	6650407	No tea, no shade.
6650847	6652668	All tea, all tea.
6653548	6657451	that we have all this expensive equipment, but we don't really have any of that.
6657751	6659252	No, it's pretty chill.
6659472	6663134	I slept on the floor not four feet from here last night.
6663535	6666697	You can literally say you slept with Orange Lounge Radio.
6667777	6668598	I'm not going to tell anyone.
6668618	6669839	Please don't spread that rumor.
6669859	6675963	I do have to say that when we buy a house, we're definitely looking for a place that has room for OLR.
6676083	6678704	Actually, Alan and I are looking at moving ourselves.
6678744	6680165	Oh my God, let's all get a big house.
6681306	6682587	Oh my God, I'd kill you all.
6686557	6687637	I wasn't talking about that.
6687737	6688157	I said about Rob.
6688178	6688918	Been there, done that.
6688978	6689978	I lived with Loki before.
6690078	6692339	Been there, done that.
6692359	6693919	You have seen me drunk in my pajamas.
6693999	6695840	With all due respect, Loki was a great roommate.
6695880	6696700	I want to make that clear.
6696740	6699281	The only reason, you know, he got married and blah-de-blah.
6699501	6702101	And I have a kid, so that would be a little weird.
6702121	6703022	That would be a challenge.
6704322	6707243	By the way, Josh looked totally cute in that last picture.
6707263	6707983	I just have to say.
6708343	6710984	Actually, yeah, Nelly's been posting a lot of pictures of Josh lately.
6711004	6712885	I gotta say, cute, cute kid.
6712905	6717086	I mean, not that I didn't think so before, but just I'm being reminded consistently on Facebook this week.
6717446	6718266	Cute, cute kid.
6718566	6719747	For the record, I have to say this.
6719927	6723908	I gave Julian the Nerf shield and dagger for his birthday.
6724628	6729050	He had the most maniacal grin on his face and wanted to immediately sword fight.
6731461	6737265	Looking at comments from our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com SSJ100Matt says, the OLR beach house?
6738865	6745129	That's like the summer spinoff where the Saved by the Bell kids all worked at the beach retreat or whatever.
6745509	6748991	Don't you dare use Jersey Shore and OLR in the same sentence.
6749131	6749912	I will cut a bitch.
6750992	6752854	DarkTetsuya says move into the fort.
6752974	6754275	Yes, we talked about that some time ago.
6754895	6757137	Codeman says OLR real world.
6758698	6760279	There would definitely be some drama.
6760299	6761179	Start getting real.
6761420	6765102	If Jamie and I lived in the same house like 24-7, there would definitely be some drama.
6766583	6770646	My husband would murder one of us.
6770666	6773148	Wait, what's that, Tim?
6774509	6776010	Rehab from tacos, maybe?
6777151	6778592	I don't do drugs already.
6778672	6779813	Rob Roberts, my strange addiction.
6779873	6781594	Every Tuesday would be Taco Tuesday.
6782715	6785037	We'd have the live cast from Felipe's on Tuesday.
6785057	6786998	Your guys' cycle would line up.
6789600	6790521	Fuck off.
6792062	6792322	Hearts.
6793698	6799362	Let's move to rapid fire news while I stare at Captain Spike with my death eyes.
6799602	6801183	Loki, start us off.
6801403	6804125	I think maybe we already did sync up.
6805025	6805486	Alright.
6806426	6810889	You may remember an independent game that kind of ripped off of Super Mario Bros.
6811069	6811710	Super Mario Bros.
6811750	6812310	Crossover.
6812330	6814732	It was a fun game where you get to play all the Super Mario Bros.
6814752	6821516	levels, but you get to play them as not only Super Mario, or Luigi, or Zelda, or...
6822797	6847982	Simon Belmont and that kind of stuff so now they have 3.0 because it's celebrating three years and they've got a pretty interesting I didn't know that this game existed but apparently there's a game called Super Mario Brothers Special that has it's a crossover between Super Mario Brothers and like Donkey Kong like they have Donkey Kong power-ups and stuff like that and barrels and all sorts of cool stuff so that's the newest update is going to be levels out of that game
6848642	6873090	and they have a whole bunch of other you know game types um you know because one of the things that the game does is it changes the way it looks and so you can be playing with all the different characters from you know Castlevania and stuff it just changes the whole sprite set and the sound effects and stuff it's really interesting but if you want to check it out um looks like uh explodingrabbit.com is where you're gonna be able to find that game of course
6874150	6876392	I don't know when the 3.0 update is coming.
6876512	6877032	Soon, though.
6877412	6878373	But they have a trailer for it.
6880374	6881375	How are they pushing that?
6881515	6885497	I gave them money on their Kickstarter for Super Retro Squad.
6885737	6887038	That was supposed to be in March.
6887798	6888079	Yeah.
6888399	6891521	Well, no Kickstarter is ever on time.
6891801	6892881	How's your Ouya?
6892901	6893622	Did you get your Ouya?
6894358	6897919	My OUYA right now is chilling in, where was it?
6898079	6900279	It's in the Bay Area right now.
6901399	6902580	Just outside of Fremont.
6903700	6904300	Daily City?
6904900	6905920	Fucking Fremont.
6906561	6907361	No, seriously.
6907481	6908981	It's in my living room, by the way.
6909001	6910561	Seriously, fucking Fremont.
6910581	6911222	You know why?
6912442	6913102	Not even Fremont.
6913122	6913802	Fremont's out of this.
6913882	6915963	It's just, you know, it's a close by standard.
6915983	6918583	But no, seriously, fucking Daily City or whatever.
6918603	6919283	It's at the Cow Palace.
6919383	6919903	Whatever it is.
6921364	6922644	Oh, that's right where Alan used to live.
6922884	6927969	Yeah, it's been sitting there since Thursday, not moving at all.
6928369	6929110	I like the traffic.
6929350	6934414	Yes, but you see, it keeps getting worse.
6934634	6936796	First off, it took forever for them to ship it.
6937036	6939338	They shipped it by boat.
6939439	6943102	Look, we could do a three-hour show of you bitching about your OUYA.
6943122	6944043	I'm with him on this one.
6944063	6945604	They haven't shipped mine out yet either.
6945684	6946785	No, no, listen, here's how it's going.
6947165	6948286	So they shipped it by boat.
6949367	6950469	First off, they picked DHL.
6951110	6952813	DHL, the quality shipper.
6953274	6955718	The only worst shipper in the world would be Old Dominion.
6961687	6964870	Well, it better not be a DHL car because that car would be moving fucking slow.
6964890	6966131	This is a damn heated Loki.
6967192	6968353	So they shipped it DHL.
6968754	6986250	DHL and then the strategic mailing thing, they passed it off to the United States Postal Service, which, from my experience shipping eBay stuff, they always scan those packages and they totally never just go weeks at a time without...
6986630	6988370	Hey, here's where your package is.
6988711	6991051	So, I'm expecting my package hopefully on Monday.
6991271	6992712	Otherwise, I don't know where it is.
6993372	7002454	Because it shouldn't take a whole weekend from Thursday to go two hours in distance.
7003875	7004535	Are you done?
7005015	7005295	I'm done.
7007344	7010665	So there was a new game coming from Take-Two.
7011785	7015906	XCOM, or at least the Bureau, XCOM Declassified.
7015966	7022428	It was that first-person XCOM game that no one wanted, and now it's a third-person XCOM game that some people might want.
7023648	7024808	And it's a squad-based shooter.
7025769	7026529	So, yeah.
7027209	7034131	It's supposed to be like a prequel to the whole XCOM series to figure out how the XCOM Bureau, I guess, was created or something.
7034751	7035071	I don't know.
7035691	7035811	Yeah.
7036431	7062837	and last but not least the Indie Royale Lunar Bundle as we were talking about earlier purchasing pretty great deal if you buy you pay what you want $6 gets you the game $8 gets you some additional stuff including the Reawakening album which is from some Commodore 64 and Amiga chiptune artist TJK and then also in this bundle you get some cool stuff including Back to the Future
7063597	7078842	the whole Telltale game and Dungeon Hearts, Cargo Commander and let's see what else PID was the other game so I bought it, it's pretty awesome so check it out
7080968	7083870	All righty, let's move on and talk about the Wii U Virtual Console.
7083930	7085832	We've kind of referenced this already in the show.
7086072	7088013	If you didn't know, that Wii U update is out.
7088374	7098081	Yes, it does make a lot of stuff on the console faster, so here's a reason to turn on your Wii U if you beat Zombie U and Mario U a couple months ago and you really haven't had a reason.
7099262	7102564	Fire it up, download the update, and you can check out some of these virtual console games.
7102684	7103284	Balloon Fight...
7104145	7113551	Donkey Kong Jr., Excitebike, Kirby's Adventure, Punch-Out, F-Zero, Super Mario World, and of course, Ice Climbers, all available on Virtual Console.
7114051	7121376	And yeah, even though I said, you know, when we first announced the Virtual Console on Wii U, I wasn't going to do this.
7122236	7122636	I did it.
7122716	7125438	I paid the $1.50 to upgrade my copy of Super Mario World.
7125498	7127339	I gotta say, it runs really nice.
7127479	7129620	I really prefer it on Wii U to the Wii.
7129760	7131081	I didn't think it would be that big of a difference.
7131161	7134322	And how could a 20-year-old game be that different?
7134362	7144468	But I'm telling you, with the HDMI, without me having to consistently change the proportions on the television, with the audio coming out of the Wii U pad as well as the TV, it works great.
7144608	7146369	So, you know, alright.
7146809	7149370	I was wrong when I first judged Virtual Console a few months ago.
7150071	7150411	Fine.
7150951	7151872	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7168246	7169487	hence the name Unmasked.
7169587	7171228	Oh, I'm sure DarkSakura is all about this.
7171248	7172249	I'm not going to play it.
7173049	7178733	Characters like Batman, places like the Batcave, supposed to be out on PC, Wii U, and 3DS.
7178873	7180834	So it's definitely a Nintendo and a PC thing.
7181615	7186898	I remember the last Scribblenauts game was one of the launch titles for Wii U, so this will make an interesting fit.
7187238	7193802	It will be a very interesting step for the series, but seeing as Scribblenauts is part of WB Games, it does make sense.
7194123	7196744	So curiosity peaked.
7196965	7197425	We'll say that.
7198422	7200443	Also, this rumor's going around.
7201124	7202525	I don't know how much weight I give this.
7202745	7209670	It could certainly be a game changer, but the rumor is that Take-Two is supposed to announce Grand Theft Auto V for next-generation consoles next month.
7210010	7217875	Now, did this originate with an analyst, that infamous games analyst that always says, because if so, then this holds absolutely no weight.
7217915	7219276	It's not coming out next-gen.
7219596	7220797	It's not, and here's why.
7220837	7227942	It's because they're going to do a PC, they will do a PC version later on, just like they did with 4, and they're going to do that probably with the next-gen consoles
7228742	7230384	Here's my other problem with this article.
7230424	7235328	They say the announcement is supposed to be coming during an upcoming investor event on May 16th.
7235848	7236729	They don't make announcements.
7247017	7251581	Here's our plan for the future in broad terms, not in these types of specifics.
7252121	7254923	That's the big problem I have with this that's going around right now.
7254943	7263370	I don't think, and here's the other thing too, is they're not going to spend the additional time to make a next-gen version of the game when they have a current-gen version of the game that people will buy anyways.
7264571	7268573	Unless someone paid them big money to make it an exclusive to their console.
7268773	7275577	I still don't think they would do that because even if they brought out the game, they're going to do a PC version at the same time.
7275637	7276478	Because why bother?
7276498	7281721	If you're going to develop a higher-res version of the game, you might as well make a PC version as well so that you can put it out on PCs.
7282041	7284082	Unless someone bought it off.
7284662	7286623	That's always a possibility on the table.
7286823	7287684	Someone bought it off.
7287844	7288885	It's always on the table.
7289545	7290126	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7310824	7313907	Oh, I'm gonna fucking kill somebody if that happens.
7314607	7315488	I will cut a bitch.
7315748	7317830	I don't know if you should say that on a radio show.
7317890	7320512	No, I will fucking kill somebody.
7321132	7323234	Virtually, people.
7323354	7323955	Allegedly.
7324175	7325055	It's Grand Theft Auto.
7325096	7327477	Of course he will kill somebody digitally.
7327517	7328798	He'll kill a hooker.
7328918	7332141	No, I think I will have to kill somebody.
7332301	7334943	Don't say that in this world, Loki.
7334983	7335884	You don't say that.
7336044	7336404	DarkSakura
7354750	7356031	All right, I gotta get my story up.
7356171	7356371	Okay.
7357752	7359453	Sorry, my throat's a little owie right now.
7359974	7360254	Okay.
7360894	7363556	Well, we have some download content for Revengeance.
7363636	7367318	We have Blade Wolf, and it's going to be out in May in Japan.
7367779	7375804	On the 9th of May, we don't have a Western date yet, but I would assume that it would have to be somewhere near there, and it's gonna be 1,000 yen.
7377025	7381668	So we're looking at maybe a $10 DLC when we get it.
7383229	7383869	In other news,
7384970	7385831	Close window.
7386011	7386331	Thank you.
7386852	7389814	There is going to be a sequel to River City Ransom.
7390675	7394618	And there is a crowdfunding thing open for it.
7396040	7398982	They want to make it an official River City Ransom.
7399302	7405047	They're working with the River City Ransom EX developer million to do the actual sequel.
7405227	7408030	So they're hoping it's going to be August 2014.
7409351	7411933	And they've got a placeholder website out for this right now.
7412386	7420568	Just to throw a little background into this, I think the reason why they say actual sequel is because something is coming on 3DS, I think, but it's not the same people.
7420728	7423729	So you kind of have the two groups now.
7424289	7429111	Are they doing another Neketsu game on 3DS?
7429891	7430651	I think so, yeah.
7430791	7432432	One of the actual Kunio games?
7433172	7433352	Yes.
7434002	7435263	Honestly, that will be far superior.
7437264	7437464	Yep.
7437584	7437984	Actually.
7439425	7441266	The shade, the shade of it all.
7441666	7442226	You know what?
7442306	7449069	It's just true, because you cannot... Like, okay, you played Dodgeball and Super Dodgeball, right?
7449129	7450070	They're actual Kunio games.
7450730	7452411	You've played knockoff Dodgeball games, right?
7452511	7453191	Were they as good?
7453391	7453611	No.
7454532	7458194	Is anything going to top the original hot-blooded downtown fight?
7459214	7460915	The Neo Geo one was great.
7462113	7462253	TXK
7485899	7487199	TXK, whatever, TXK.
7487600	7488140	You know what, Rob?
7488200	7489200	I'm so excited.
7489320	7489940	I'm dyslexic.
7490741	7493601	I have excited onset dyslexia.
7494242	7494582	Thank you.
7496622	7497863	I'm quaking a little bit right now.
7498363	7498983	Shaking, crying.
7500564	7502804	Maybe your super zapper needs to recharge.
7503545	7504925	Super zapper recharge.
7505585	7507506	Okay, for anyone who lives under a rock...
7508630	7532827	who has been living under a rock or in a cave or under the sea Tempest 2000 is probably one of the best games in the universe even as frustratingly difficult as it can be it's all because of the music because nothing else matters and it came out on the Jaguar which was the only good game on the Jaguar next to what Alien vs. Predator no that wasn't even very good either for the time yeah but it was still the best game that ever came out on the Jaguar hands down
7533482	7534563	KXT KXT
7558740	7564391	Alright, let's take a chance to go to the Fugle Question of the Week.
7573984	7577107	Take Facebook, take Google, slam them together and you get Fugle.
7577287	7581471	And we ask a question on our Fugle Facebook and Google communities every week.
7581631	7582993	And this week is about movies.
7583413	7584594	And I'm going to apologize in advance.
7584614	7587217	I'm not going to have enough time to read all the answers because we're running long tonight.
7587237	7587977	We still have a list list.
7588918	7595845	But I want to encourage everybody to visit our communities, Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and Google Plus to see all the answers in full.
7596846	7600730	There's some news this week about Ratchet and Clank as well as Heavenly Sword becoming a movie.
7601150	7602652	How do you feel about video game movies?
7603072	7605155	Most have a reputation for being pretty bad.
7605475	7607037	Do you think this helps or hurts gaming?
7607337	7610180	Should Hollywood be making more video game movies or less?
7611622	7614044	Let's take a look at some of the answers on Google+.
7615558	7616238	Actdeft says,
7642564	7645947	Flaco Jones, which by the way, I want to congratulate Flaco Jones.
7645987	7648188	He's now officially staffed for VOG.
7648608	7653512	His first movie review went up, and he's got another article he's posting during the week.
7653832	7659816	He's going to be doing a lot of the stuff from a film perspective, in the written form, so that'll be great.
7660637	7661577	So congrats, Flaco.
7662118	7669062	And that's also going to be a very interesting change for the game, because as you know, staff of VOG don't go on the regular leaderboards.
7669442	7671364	So Flaco has been winning every month.
7672004	7674365	So, hmm, now things are going to get interesting.
7675105	7676246	Alright, but anyhow, Flacco says,
7695153	7704996	and Red Entertainment lastly on Google Plus says in an ideal situation you need a writer, director and producer all having good track records working together as a team.
7705416	7708657	That is why I'm looking forward to Tyler Perry Presents Halo.
7712458	7712738	Love it.
7714309	7716090	Let's do a few answers from Facebook as well.
7716390	7723795	Critical Myth, whose podcast talks a lot about movies and TV shows and that stuff, and he does a lot of the book reviews for our site.
7723855	7732501	Critical Myth says, I love the RNC games, but the last two have been less than stellar, so I'm actually hopeful that this will give Insomniac a reason to revitalize the franchise.
7732881	7736724	But in general terms, I think it always comes down to the creative minds behind the production.
7736804	7741507	Do they understand the IP and what a film adaptation can bring to the table that the game itself does not?
7741927	7744109	And is the game suited to a film-style narrative?
7745710	7753174	Pete Garuno says, Some game franchises lend themselves very well to film adaptations, even though the execution has pretty much always been awful.
7753594	7759298	Ratchet & Clank really doesn't strike me as the kind of game that ought to have a film made of it, unless they're really that desperate for money.
7760438	7766122	And lastly, on Facebook, Andy R says, As a PlayStation fan, I was pretty happy about the news, but I'm concerned as well.
7766522	7767082	Thank you for watching!
7786777	7791979	That's a very interesting comment, and I kind of want to end on that and turn it over to the folks here in the studio.
7792700	7801523	He theorizes there that if the movie is so bad, it's going to make people go, well, no wonder, because it's a game, and the game probably sucks too.
7801943	7806245	So can the movies actually do harm to video gaming when they're really terrible?
7807616	7823159	I honestly think it also really depends on the audience too because there's been a lot of really good Japanese adaptations that wouldn't fly over here for the general audience because of that quirkiness that's a part of Japanese game movie versions.
7825160	7833002	People here want either it to be super cutesy or super gritty, realistic, have an edge to it and I don't really see it.
7833562	7834882	It would really depend on the IP.
7837270	7844073	I don't know, which came first, the Alone in the Dark movie or the Alone in the Dark game by Atari?
7844793	7845793	Like, the last one.
7847094	7848634	Because I don't remember which one hurt what.
7849575	7851335	I'm sure Tara Reid, being a scientist, didn't help.
7851435	7852116	Oh, stop.
7853636	7855297	Spike, how do you feel about video game movies?
7856325	7860467	Well, you know, I think that they're largely, you know, mediocre at best.
7861248	7869633	I think it's kind of telling when you have recent movie games like Prince of Persia and the general perception is still, oh, game movies are getting better.
7871133	7874095	So, you know, they're mostly crap, but I don't think they hurt.
7875336	7879138	Again, Street Fighter is still a franchise that exists, and that movie was awful.
7879338	7882060	See also Super Mario Brothers with Bob Hoskins.
7882140	7882800	Hey, hey.
7883901	7884641	Kylie was in it.
7885057	7886578	No, it was in Street Fighter, yes.
7887778	7888959	Sorry, I thought you meant the Mario movie.
7888979	7896642	The cast in that Street Fighter movie was actually super... But I feel so bad for dearly departed Raul Julia for that being his last movie.
7897603	7899724	Although I have seen him in some really crappy movies.
7899764	7902285	And you guys even forgot that there was another Street Fighter movie.
7902905	7905568	Yeah, there was that horrible Chun-Li thing.
7905588	7905628	Oh!
7906549	7913177	Didn't Bison cause harm with psychic powers to a woman in a way that I don't really feel appropriate describing?
7913297	7914258	Well, you know what?
7914438	7917001	I didn't see it, and I don't really want to.
7917161	7920425	I was really drunk, but I feel like I was offended, and that takes a lot.
7922004	7925627	I'm going to stick with the Ties That Bind, best Street Fighter thing that came out.
7926187	7929349	That's the only thing in my universe, the thing that came out with Street Fighter 4.
7930170	7931270	Yeah, that was really good.
7931751	7932772	So Tim, what do you think?
7932832	7937835	If they end up doing this new Mass Effect movie, do you think it's going to do justice to the games?
7939016	7940717	I don't think it'll do justice to the games.
7940737	7942158	I think it'll be something completely different.
7942258	7943299	It might be good, it might be bad.
7944239	7948282	In general, I think video game movies have been pretty hit or miss, but I'm pretty hopeful that...
7948622	7961108	because I look at something like the comic book industry, which they made a lot of stinker comic book movies, but eventually Hollywood and the comic industry figured out how to do that, and there have been some stellar comic book games.
7961248	7968592	So I have hope that in the future they sort of solve that problem for games translating over to movies as well.
7968612	7969092	That's a good point.
7969112	7970053	That's a very good point.
7970860	7978783	I tend to agree with the other person that talked about how if the right people with the right passion are behind it, it has the potential to do very well.
7979683	7982804	Which, you know, anything Uwe Boll touched, you're like, oh, girl.
7982824	7988226	Well, I feel that, I mean, considering this, I'm assuming Sony's going to be publishing the movie.
7989066	7993027	And, you know, it's studios that they picked to do these licenses.
7993207	7994948	I would assume that they're going to be...
7996228	8004294	up to their standards because I mean it is their properties that they're playing with and I would think that they wouldn't just let anything come to market.
8005696	8006036	I don't know.
8007237	8013742	Like they've done like what some tie-ins and stuff with different like EA properties like some anime movies and I don't think those were that bad.
8016744	8025311	Shane in our chat room who of course has a thing or two to say about Mass Effect says no one can agree with how the Mass Effect movie should be because we all have our different stories and shepherds.
8026371	8030353	Prince Brightstar says, Frankly, I think Mass Effect will be better as a Saturday morning cartoon.
8030733	8032014	Picturing the April Fool's 12th.
8032034	8033215	Well, there was the anime.
8034055	8034655	You know what?
8034835	8036336	Actually, did I tell you I got that?
8036456	8036816	Yeah, yeah.
8037397	8037797	You mentioned.
8037817	8039278	It wasn't terrible.
8040398	8041259	Okay.
8041279	8043079	I hate admitting that it wasn't terrible.
8044260	8053144	The ending of it totally was like, you know all the stuff that they do in Mass Effect 3 that wants to punch you in the gut and make you vomit your feelings?
8053725	8054365	Yeah, it did that too.
8057498	8061840	to register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com.
8062260	8063961	Use the passphrase, yogurt.
8064862	8066002	Let's do a couple more news stories.
8066042	8067643	We got listless coming up, but first, Loki.
8068444	8068644	Yeah.
8069224	8070705	So... I'm sorry.
8071005	8074487	I forgot to... I always say at the end of the Fugle segment, please read the rest of the answers.
8074627	8076388	I really skipped a lot tonight because of time.
8076408	8076648	Sorry.
8077088	8079809	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or Google Plus.
8079969	8081130	Search for Orange Lounge Radio.
8081210	8081610	Sorry, Loki.
8081630	8081870	Go ahead.
8082150	8084051	So EA has had some more layoffs.
8084592	8086853	They haven't really said who was laid off.
8087473	8101404	Apparently, I guess there was an internal memo that leaked out, basically saying that at the beginning of their fiscal year, they're cutting some of their operations.
8102685	8106928	Core marketing functions have been consolidated under their new COO.
8109430	8111511	I guess they're just restructuring, it looks like.
8112952	8113133	And...
8115405	8119047	Also with that, there's a rumor that EA Partners' label is closing.
8119547	8124590	And that includes all those other developers out there.
8124610	8125530	They're bringing different titles.
8126191	8133014	Of course, The Crisis Series, Shadows of the Damned, Alice, The Madness Returns, Bulletstorm, Brutal Legend, and Rock Band.
8134675	8136856	And I guess, I wonder if that would affect Fuse.
8136876	8139918	But of course, Fuse is just right around the corner, so I'm sure that game will still come out.
8139998	8144080	But we may see a lot less, I guess...
8146511	8152633	Not necessarily experimental titles, but titles that aren't positive would do well.
8152693	8155254	Like new properties like Mirror's Edge or something like that.
8155955	8161757	Alice thought that would have done okay, but apparently it didn't sell very well in the shadows.
8163037	8167619	Suda is hard to... It's more niche.
8167719	8169220	I'm surprised.
8170220	8173782	And then last but not least, SimCity.
8174362	8174542	This is
8176312	8178332	You know there's always bad news when I mention SimCity.
8178673	8179373	It got a patch!
8179413	8180413	It fixed some bugs!
8181113	8184054	Godzilla is attacking the city!
8185014	8185254	Sorry.
8188014	8189955	Well, SimCity 2.0 came out.
8190835	8195576	It fixed a few bugs and unfortunately created a bunch of other bugs.
8195656	8196096	Of course.
8197816	8199317	So, yeah.
8199997	8200917	Lots of weird stuff.
8201077	8202977	We're pathing problems still.
8203297	8205518	Apparently the problem was sewage backing up.
8206438	8209300	So, your towns are literally full of shit now.
8210761	8212162	All sorts of syncing problems.
8213183	8219807	Yeah, they actually have this group of people on Reddit putting together a list of stuff that's wrong with it now.
8221008	8222109	So that kind of sucks.
8222889	8224030	It's still a work in progress.
8224670	8227652	And then falsely accused all the wrong people of making those bugs.
8229314	8229734	I guess.
8232307	8233368	No tea, no shade.
8235569	8238471	Alright, anything else you want to share about SimCity?
8240792	8242693	SimCity 4 apparently is on sale right now.
8242713	8243854	You can get it for really cheap.
8244154	8246615	So if you want to play a great SimCity game, there you go.
8247496	8248156	And it's offline.
8249977	8251798	Moving on, I think this is fascinating.
8251858	8253199	A patent that Apple filed in 2009.
8254940	8260021	Uh, what the patent is all about is that you have a path that you might take in a video game.
8260621	8268463	And what's interesting, what's fascinating about this is that in the patent filing, they freaking use these mock-ups of Mass Effect screenshots.
8268543	8274104	Like, and it even says name, John Shepard, origin, colonist, and like a little mock-up of what they look like and everything.
8274404	8277745	That's the first thing that made me go, is this like a joke or a troll or a, you know...
8278465	8278766	L.O.L.
8278806	8279607	Games Journalism thing?
8279667	8280007	I don't know.
8280048	8284834	But since it's floating around out there, I will report on it because I think this is a fascinating idea.
8285676	8290042	The Patent Office did grant Apple this patent and it was made public.
8291112	8312658	and it would go like this like let's say you you know in Mass Effect you you make all these different choices or let me take a game that you know Loki would actually play like Walking Dead okay like the Walking Dead games they well the Telltale ones are really good like let's say you go through the Walking Dead games you make your different choices and obviously they have a big impact well the trick about this patent is that at the end
8313058	8314842	After you've developed your character, played the game.
8314862	8316425	So imagine you play a game like Walking Dead.
8316465	8323939	At the end, you can use this system that Apple patented and you get a single issue comic that is
8324722	8325162	and DarkSakura.
8344349	8361880	Yes Okay, so you get your comic book And Strip Mine Planets And DarkSakura presents Shakerian Sunday And it's something she can get on her iPad and read it And it's like, oh, it's me and my Garrus I am not that bad Are you sure?
8362121	8369645	I don't have the Moe pillow But you thought about it No, I didn't Did you see how expensive it was?
8372734	8373897	I love how that was the reason.
8373917	8374439	Look at me!
8375101	8375863	That was the reason.
8376183	8377888	I don't have money for a pillow!
8379733	8381117	And besides, I didn't really care for the art that much.
8382656	8387919	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8407341	8409202	Yeah, Bobby was talking about something like that on the show tonight.
8409483	8415347	I miss those, but I used to skip to the end to see what the best... Because there's only like one path that's... Right.
8417708	8420010	Where you don't sneeze horrifically in the middle of a show.
8421311	8421611	Twice.
8425313	8425994	You know what?
8427235	8428696	Don't laugh at me making squeaky noises.
8428716	8430337	No, that was like the cutest sound I've ever heard.
8430357	8430877	That was cute.
8431918	8433619	I'm allergic to Papa Murphy's, I think.
8434119	8435740	Garris would approve of your cute sneezes.
8436041	8436321	No!
8436341	8436381	No!
8439622	8441003	What were you going to say about the Vanity Books?
8441123	8441663	I forget.
8441683	8442064	All right.
8443825	8444445	And thank you.
8444525	8444865	Thank you.
8445666	8447747	All right.
8448127	8449088	This is a good idea.
8449268	8465098	Yeah, the Vanity Books is a really good comparison, but in this day and age where you just crank it all out digitally into a 99-cent PDF or something, I think it's a great, like, as corny as this is going to sound, it would be a great memory of your gaming experience.
8465765	8495207	because like you know a game like Mass Effect you know again I hate to keep using this as an example but it's such a good example it takes like 40 hours to play through Mass Effect and then maybe you're sitting here for two years waiting for the sequel to come out well wouldn't it be great if instead of having to replay that 40 hour game like to kind of refresh yourself oh let me read my little comic that I had generated at the end and remember about my character and my choices people do that anyway it's called fan fiction it's called Tumblr it's called Tumblr yeah no no no you're actually that's a pretty accurate statement it's called Tumblr
8496522	8497984	So did Apple try to patent Tumblr?
8498024	8498645	Is that what we're saying?
8500247	8502029	All right.
8502269	8504632	Let's go to something that's going to need a patent here.
8504812	8507055	It's tonight's Listless.
8515233	8519576	Alright, for those of you guys that have never been here for Listless before, let me tell you how it works.
8520056	8527100	We're going to go around, oh, well first the point of this whole thing is that we are going to come up with the definitive list.
8527521	8528961	No arguments, no exceptions.
8529062	8534865	We're going to solve a great question in gaming right now with this highly scientific process.
8534885	8537427	And the way it's going to work, we are going to all go around the room.
8537447	8539568	There's five of us tonight, so it's like a Super Listless.
8540068	8540949	Super Mario Listless.
8541449	8546391	We're going to go around the room tonight and each of us are going to name three things for the list.
8546411	8547592	We're going to nominate them for the list.
8547912	8554715	But then the exciting part, we go around the room and each person will strike one item that is not worthy of the list.
8555095	8563919	And remember our new twist as of the last time we did this, should a host have two of their items eliminated from the list, the third item gets immunity.
8564239	8567561	So that way it does not like a person's entire list doesn't get eliminated.
8568141	8588352	so uh and then the chat room will vote on their top and we will get the one two and three the definitive list so here it is chatters if you want to help out tonight start yelling your answers in chat now the topic tonight mascot we most want to gift to Sega on behalf of OLR earlier in the show we talked about Sega
8589392	8592375	Sega is looking for your mascot in a nutshell.
8592635	8598840	I mean, I'm really cutting corners here, but they're looking for your mascot ideas and they could use them in a future press conference.
8599140	8602343	So we want to give them something on behalf of OLR and VOG and all that.
8602763	8603383	So here we go.
8604544	8610707	Going around the room and giving our list of the mascots we'd most like to see.
8611227	8614308	Ladies first, DarkSakura, your number three answer tonight.
8614708	8617709	What mascot would you most like to gift Sega?
8618650	8620250	Master System, the Sega robot.
8624692	8626773	And what would Master System, the Sega robot be?
8628068	8632092	He'd be a cute robot, but he wouldn't be like MechaSonic because that would be too derivative.
8632512	8638537	He'd just be a cute little chibi robot or maybe powerful like one of the Robo-Alessed robots.
8639197	8641219	Because Robo-Alessed needs more love.
8641239	8642079	That game was awesome.
8642099	8642460	Shut up.
8643601	8644261	I'm with you on that.
8644301	8645842	But his name would be Master System.
8647083	8648725	Because the Master System, hello.
8650066	8650386	All right.
8651387	8652007	Let's go around.
8652427	8655290	Loki, how about your number three answer tonight for the list?
8655550	8655950	That's easy.
8656010	8656551	President Cat.
8658922	8659082	Why?
8659122	8660803	Because it's President Cat.
8660823	8663364	That is a very OLR thing and it's being shouted by a lot of people in chat.
8663384	8665845	So President Cat... I thought we had to pick something original.
8666446	8667086	Not necessarily.
8667186	8670788	Well, who said President Cat has to be that same President Cat?
8671068	8674470	Since clearly that game company didn't give a fuck about our idea.
8677171	8679993	And you might remember the translation was something like, what, Boss Cat?
8680033	8681033	We said President Cat.
8681093	8683294	Sukibon is like a female delinquent.
8683794	8685395	And Shacho is like a company president.
8685415	8687016	You're like a female delinquent.
8688117	8688657	You know what, Rob...
8689929	8690129	What?
8690450	8691791	I'm gonna hit you in the face with a yo-yo.
8692892	8695555	And the only people who'd get that are people who actually saw Suki Bandeka.
8699360	8702243	Alright, um... SSJ100 Matt had a really good suggestion.
8703325	8706206	Dickie the Pen Dickie the Pen is awesome
8732847	8733127	Get it?
8733247	8735469	Dickie the Pen is awesome.
8736730	8738732	Just think about that one for a little bit.
8738812	8738992	All right.
8739032	8741814	Hey, Spike, who's over there frowning at my answer.
8742795	8746638	What is your number three answer for the list of mascot you'd like to gift to Sega?
8746838	8750761	I'd like to gift to Sega Rob Roberts in a Bjork swan dress.
8751442	8755265	Okay.
8755425	8757227	Do I have to sing like her?
8757367	8758688	You have to have the egg purse too.
8760783	8769426	I feel so bad for your listeners.
8771127	8772287	I'm just singing Bjork.
8776329	8776629	All right.
8777309	8781851	Lastly, but not leastly, with the number three item for the list tonight, Tim, what is your contribution to the list?
8782151	8789194	Well, since I think that crowdsourcing a new mascot is kind of sad, I think a good mascot for them would be a 32X with a frowny face.
8792793	8796296	So a regular 32X.
8796356	8798277	A 32X with a frown face.
8799037	8799418	All right.
8799978	8801519	Let's go to the number two answers.
8801579	8801859	Jamie.
8802019	8804021	Well, keep in mind, I'm not doing mine in any particular order.
8804041	8805342	I'm just doing them the order I want to list them in.
8805642	8805862	Fine.
8806182	8807503	Segata Sanshiro II.
8810005	8811586	Somebody in chat said that earlier, I think.
8811969	8818333	Yeah, but they actually said Segata Sanshiro, but since I'm being original, Segata Sanshiro the second.
8818993	8820934	It's A-T-A.
8821554	8824436	Segata Sanshiro the second.
8824876	8830259	And if no one's seen it, look up the Segata Sanshiro videos after the show.
8832521	8833921	Loki, your number two answer tonight.
8834181	8834862	A forklift.
8841525	8843914	And why would their mascot be a forklift?
8843934	8845179	Did you not play Shenmue?
8845781	8846805	Oh, okay, I get it.
8846825	8847267	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
8853301	8858823	I thought there was going to be a joke there about moving things into the warehouse, but alright, fine.
8859583	8860744	Whatever, however you want to take it.
8861784	8863164	It's funny in multiple formats.
8863325	8866266	I think the joke was how you didn't get it.
8866746	8870447	I'm sorry, my brain didn't instantly think of Shenmue out of all the video games in the world.
8870507	8872268	It should always think of Shenmue.
8873627	8875188	I approve, but you're awful
8896768	8898430	It's a long-running OLR joke, Spike.
8898470	8899610	Just smile and nod.
8899671	8899911	All right.
8899951	8903714	Non-Sylon Occupy Caprica from SSJ100MAD is my number two answer for the list.
8904975	8906976	So, Captain Spike, what is your number two answer for the list?
8907196	8913301	So, I don't know your memes or anything, so I'm just going to go with Dark Sakura in a sailor suit.
8915202	8916103	Can I at least have a gun?
8918204	8918545	Sure.
8918885	8919746	Yay!
8920106	8922468	Dark Sakura in a sailor suit and a gun.
8922848	8923208	Why?
8923408	8923689	Why?
8925560	8926360	because look at her.
8926401	8927421	That would be badass.
8927761	8928842	I thought it was a Duffy thing.
8929002	8929903	Actually, you know what?
8930663	8931564	I love Duffy!
8931624	8932924	I thought it was because Duffy wore a sailor.
8933285	8933385	Oh!
8933745	8934305	Oh, sure!
8934625	8937427	Sure, when you don't get my references, that's okay.
8937727	8940349	I don't get your references and that's a crime against gaming.
8941429	8941749	Yep.
8942190	8946292	By the way, little factoid, my very first cosplay ever was Sailor Venus.
8946933	8947573	That's awesome.
8948786	8950047	This skirt was way too short.
8951968	8952349	All right.
8953350	8954250	Let's go to Spike.
8954270	8956212	In the name of the moon, I will fuck you up.
8956432	8958994	Let's go to Tim's number two answer.
8959074	8960575	Tim, what is your number two answer for the list?
8960695	8963618	It was actually really similar to Spike's, and we did not plan it that way.
8963738	8969102	But it was all three OLR hosts doing Bayonetta cosplay.
8970063	8970823	I don't have that much hair.
8971884	8972985	Can Loki be Jaune?
8974759	8975419	Yeah, Loki can be Jon.
8975439	8976499	Rob has to be the other witch.
8976779	8977160	What was her?
8978280	8978740	That was Jon.
8978780	8979260	Yeah, no.
8979760	8980600	I'll be Joe Pesci.
8980640	8981280	Rob has to be.
8982181	8983061	He can be the little girl.
8983481	8985001	The little young virgin.
8985281	8987322	No, I will not be a little girl.
8987542	8988062	No, not you.
8988102	8988802	You be Jon.
8988922	8990182	He be the little girl.
8990342	8991343	Okay, I'm sexy, right?
8992003	8992363	I guess.
8993403	8994403	You'll be wearing a breastplate.
8995104	8995864	I didn't say yes.
8995944	8996904	I just said I guess.
8997751	8998031	All right.
8998651	9001473	So far, the list of mascots we will gift to Sega.
9002053	9018581	Master System the Sega Robot, President Cat, Dickie the Pen, Rob Roberts in a Bjork swan dress, 32X with a frowny face, Segata Senshiro II, a forklift, non-Sylon-occupied Caprica, Dark Sakura in a sailor suit, and a gun.
9019041	9021202	All OLR hosts in Bayonetta cosplay.
9021242	9022062	This is the worst list ever.
9022082	9023323	Hey, I'm already wearing the glasses.
9023463	9023803	All right.
9023963	9026805	I just like how everyone assumed I would be Bayonetta, so thank you.
9028826	9031269	The only way I would wear high heels is if they had guns on them.
9032070	9035073	Number one answers for the list.
9035153	9036295	Here we go.
9037336	9037856	DarkSakura.
9038257	9041320	Opa Opa's retarded cousin Opi Opi that looks like a huge boom.
9043482	9044984	That was oddly specific.
9046893	9075136	OPI is boob in Japanese so it would be I won't use the R word in the answer I will say OPA OPA's OPI huge boob cousin it's OPP AI by the way OPI OPI OPI yeah instead of OPA OPA because we all know that Fantasy Zone is awesome okay there we go Loki your number one answer ooh la la
9077034	9079535	I'll put it, but it's getting taken down.
9103718	9104378	Oh, Rob.
9105119	9106279	I'm already taking down one of yours.
9106760	9107920	Fine, fine.
9108100	9115044	If I can't have that, you know, if we're gonna, we're gonna make, I'm gonna, instead of like a game character, I want a game to be an actual, you know, thing.
9115224	9115444	Fine.
9115724	9116945	The Japanese table flipping game.
9117305	9117945	The arcade game.
9118525	9121327	That should be the, it should just be a big table being flipped over.
9121507	9122147	Have you played that?
9122187	9122908	It's awesome.
9123008	9123828	No, I want to play it.
9123848	9124648	It looks awesome.
9124788	9127130	That emote icon could just be their new mascot.
9127170	9129251	I love Chiggers Forever for saying De Medna.
9131471	9133172	Hello, my puppets!
9133772	9136273	Have you heard about my blast processing?
9139334	9139754	That's it.
9139874	9146196	I have to redo the Pandaren meme and have it say blast processing.
9146256	9147757	I'm stealing X to first meme.
9147777	9151398	The sad thing is like 98% of the audience just isn't going to understand.
9152919	9154939	But for the 2% that do, you're welcome.
9155019	9155320	You know what?
9155340	9155800	I'll do it for us.
9155940	9156200	All right.
9157240	9159461	Captain Spike, your number one answer.
9160512	9163573	Well, I've done one for Rob and I've done one for DarkSakura.
9163893	9168254	So I'm going to go with Loki in a banana hammock with a giant purple dildo bat.
9171915	9174675	You should have just done as Tingle.
9176456	9177616	No, no, no, Loki.
9177656	9178396	Tingle's old.
9178496	9180597	You were the one that wanted to get past Tingle.
9180677	9185278	So Loki in a banana hammock with a purple dildo bat is on the list.
9185598	9186758	SSJ100 not suggested Betty White.
9186778	9186899	Yeah.
9190069	9192713	Alright, one more.
9194376	9197340	One more here from Tim to add to the list.
9197461	9198823	Last chance to get something on the list.
9198843	9200045	Oh wait, no, I didn't do my number one, did I?
9200085	9200766	No, you didn't.
9200786	9201146	Oh, shit.
9201407	9202749	Alright, then my number one answer...
9203957	9214121	My number one answer would be, now, my number one answer is inspired by the fact, I don't know if you guys know this, but in San Francisco, in the Sega building, they're no longer there in the Sega building, you know what company moved in in their place?
9215481	9216441	Was Zynga.
9216842	9222243	So my number one answer mascot is Zeke the Zynga Killer, and he's a coyote that eats dogs.
9224404	9226405	You're a horrible person, Rob, I approve.
9226425	9228165	Oh, he only eats Zynga dogs, don't worry.
9228185	9229806	Okay, well then he can eat the Zynga dog.
9232799	9234660	My number one answer is Zeke the Zynga Killer.
9234720	9238503	Alright, last but not leastly, Tim, your number one answer.
9238923	9244507	My number one answer is a terrifying amalgamation of all of Sonic's shitty friends.
9248790	9258156	Like some vaguely Sonic-shaped character that's pink like the girl, Amy, and has knuckles as hands and a gun.
9259117	9260858	So it would be the Sonic Gestalt?
9261451	9262611	Yeah, Sonic Gestalt.
9262671	9262991	Thank you.
9263451	9263712	All right.
9263912	9266452	But it would have to be called SBO because that was the weirdest name.
9266592	9266872	All right.
9266932	9267452	Sorry, guys.
9267472	9269213	This is a highly scientific process.
9269253	9270073	I'm going to run down the list.
9270113	9272654	But here's some items that didn't make the list from chat.
9272714	9273714	I'm really surprised at some of these.
9274054	9277055	SJ100 Matt, the giggling lesbians didn't make the list tonight.
9277915	9279795	Chigger said Dame Edna, which we said.
9281876	9283456	Who was talking about the singer from D-Lite?
9284837	9287317	It was when he brought up Ooh La La.
9287397	9288878	The whole lawsuit and everything like that.
9289038	9290298	Lady Miss Keira Kirby.
9291138	9291598	Let's see.
9292699	9293619	I'd vote for Bootsy Collins.
9293659	9294880	Nobody said ferret.
9295060	9296280	That surprised me as well.
9299001	9299341	Let's see.
9299381	9299961	What else did we say?
9300061	9302682	Peep the Peep Jouster, says S. Jonah and Matt.
9302982	9305083	Needs more rappy, says Prince Brightstar.
9305984	9308965	We didn't name a ferret because we respect the ferret too much.
9310305	9312446	All right, but guys, this list is too big.
9312867	9314448	It's time to thin it down a little bit.
9314508	9316729	So we have to go around the list.
9316769	9320772	Since there's so many people, please let me know if you got two of your items eliminated because I don't know who said what at this point.
9321152	9323473	So let me run down the list and we will start eliminating.
9323533	9323974	Here we go.
9324654	9334180	Master System the Sega Robot, President Cat, Dickie the Pen, Rob Roberts in a Bjork swan dress, a 32X with a frowny face.
9334820	9358032	Segata Senshiro II, A Forklift, Non-Silent Occupied Caprica, DarkSakura in a Sailor Suit and a Gun, All OLR Hosts in Bayonetta Cosplay, Opa Opa's Opai Opai Huge Boob Cousin, Table Flipping Arcade Game, Loki in a Banana Hammock with a Purple Dildo Back, Zeke the Zynga Killer, and an Amalgamation of All of Sonic's Shitty Friends.
9359633	9361334	However, this list is too big.
9361454	9363995	DarkSakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?
9364747	9367969	Just because it's old and played out.
9368089	9370150	Bye-bye non-silent occupied Caprica.
9370870	9372551	Non-silent occupied Caprica.
9372631	9373711	It has been stricken from the list.
9373752	9375572	It might have stayed if it was a bottle of Propel.
9377033	9378994	Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?
9379114	9380915	I don't think anyone wants to see me in a banana hammock.
9383507	9384508	I knew that was happening.
9384628	9386690	Loki in a banana hammock with a purple dildo bat.
9386750	9388031	It has been stricken from the list.
9388731	9389252	Spike.
9389712	9389912	Oh, wait.
9389952	9390573	No, I'll go next.
9391093	9391313	Me.
9391393	9392795	Which one am I going to strike from the list?
9394416	9401161	I'm sorry, DarkSakura, but I'm going to remove Segata Senshiro II because, you know what?
9401341	9403964	A copy of something that's already out there is too easy.
9404144	9404564	Oh, that's right.
9404584	9406406	That would be too much awesome for the universe.
9406426	9409128	But then who are they going to base Segagaga 2 off of?
9410242	9410582	I know.
9410982	9413784	Why didn't we not have... Except it would be nothing but bad decisions.
9413804	9415024	Hey, not my problem.
9415124	9416965	Hey, hey, kids, not my problem.
9417045	9418306	It has been stricken from the list.
9419346	9421407	Spike, which of these is not worthy of the list?
9421567	9424909	I don't understand Dickie the Pen, and so I don't wish to see it.
9425889	9426350	All right.
9426630	9427550	You know what we should have said?
9428190	9428871	We should have said...
9431202	9431823	I just forgot it.
9431983	9432384	Never mind.
9447497	9448938	am I allowed to eliminate one of my own?
9449418	9474348	yes you can if you must 32x with a frowny face is super depressing a 32x with a frowny face Tim has decided you know what I'm not feeling it anymore I would rather see an amalgamation of all of Sonic's shitty friends so it has been stricken from the list it should have the little quote bubble that says kill me I remember what it is I remember what the suggestion that we should have done was Pepsi Man Pepsi Man
9476261	9480644	Alright guys, that means it is time to vote in tonight's list list.
9480704	9483486	I'm going to paste the list here in chat right now.
9483927	9488470	Send your number one and your number two answers via private message to Rob Roberts.
9489030	9490612	Here it is, your choices tonight.

9493954	9495755	Rob Robertson and Bjork Swandress.
9495775	9496436	That stayed.
9497797	9498097	Yes.
9498858	9502240	Forklift, DarkSakura in a sailor suit and a gun.
9502801	9504962	All OLR hosts and Bayonetta cosplay.
9505623	9506403	That stayed.
9506884	9507244	Yes.
9507944	9509325	I can only eliminate one.
9510246	9519795	Opa Opa's Opai Opai Huge Boob Cousin, Table Flipping Arcade Game, Zeke the Zynga Killer, and an amalgamation of all of Sonic's shitty friends.
9520416	9525400	Send your votes via private message to Rob Roberts with your number one and your number two answers.
9525741	9532367	And to answer that question I see in chat right now from VSJSXV, why aren't we using the VOGnetwork.com poll for this?
9532827	9535249	All I'm going to say is, soon.
9536671	9537251	but not tonight.
9538032	9541757	Alright, so send those votes in right now.
9541797	9544139	We're going to tally them up and we'll let you know a little later in the show.
9544199	9549465	Hey, SSJ100 Matt, I don't think that Konami would want to let go of their awesome lion to Sega.
9551047	9551307	All right.
9552347	9555268	While I tally up those votes, I think we're going to take a... Dude, I miss Pepsi, man.
9555288	9557249	Those commercials were hilarious.
9557549	9557769	Yes.
9558329	9558509	All right.
9558529	9560830	While I tally up those votes, we're going to take a trip to the mailbag.
9561310	9561810	Oh, fuck.
9562130	9571553	Every week, you guys send us emails to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, and Dark Sakura respectfully opens up the email bag every week and dives in... What the hell is this shit?
9571653	9574534	...and picks out some of her favorite emails to read.
9574934	9575794	It's all sticky.
9576635	9577655	At least it's not powdery.
9578075	9580656	Dark Sakura, what emails are you going to read tonight?
9581405	9583046	Okay, I approve of how this one started.
9583106	9584066	It's from Degenerate Johnny.
9584726	9586667	Greetings and salutations.
9586987	9589628	Which I have to do the Christian Slater voice from Heathers.
9590948	9592789	Greetings and salutations, O Alarmy.
9592869	9594449	It's the one and only Degenerate Johnny.
9594930	9599171	I wanted to email you about last week's show pertaining to the lack of strong female lead characters in video games.
9599591	9605073	I'm not sure if you've had the chance to watch Anita Sarkisian's... I know I pronounced that wrong.
9605593	9608654	Kickstarter video discussing the damsel in distress trope in games.
9609054	9610435	But it mentions the same topic.
9610655	9612895	If you have not, I'm sure someone will post a link in chat.
9613956	9620558	While I do agree that feminism is moving at a snail's pace, the lack of diversity is becoming less common than it was ten years ago.
9620958	9629261	Today we see three-dimensional character development for both genders of all sexual orientations, such as Tony Prince, GTA 4, Samantha Trainor, and Mass Effect 3.
9630241	9640265	We even see strong female leads who evolve significantly throughout certain game series, such as a young, naive, independent summoner who learns how to become independent with goals of her own.
9640605	9643707	Yes, I'm a guy that played and actually enjoyed Final Fantasy X-2.
9644007	9645047	X-2, Rob!
9646408	9647668	Big whoop, wanna fight about it?
9648169	9648889	No, I'm not judging you.
9649690	9660188	The great thing about interactive entertainment is that it promotes individualism over traditionalism, therefore the player is free to accept others regardless of their race, religion, gender, and sexual orientation.
9661621	9676853	It is unfortunate that we live in a patriarchal society, but I believe that both the feminism and homosexual movement will progress faster once the traditionalist members of the baby boomer generation retire from the professional world.
9677273	9680836	Although I won't be present for tonight's show, I'm heading a card game tournament.
9681296	9681836	Kick their ass.
9682617	9685279	I'm interested in hearing your thought on this.
9685339	9687240	Congratulations on 502 episodes.
9687661	9690423	Oh well, army knight degenerate Johnny.
9691500	9696543	Yeah, this is the thing about progress.
9698084	9701687	When people get it in their head that progress needs to happen, it will happen.
9703448	9705909	Like you said, the old guard's going to die out.
9707630	9708891	Any other thoughts, people?
9710672	9714735	I'm going to admit I'm furiously counting votes over here, so can you summarize real quick for me?
9715487	9718670	Basically, there's a lot more diversity in video games.
9718710	9720812	We're seeing more strong female leads come out.
9721412	9727237	And that basically the old head up their ass baby boomer traditionalist people are going to die out.
9727937	9729659	Well, they're not really playing video games anyway.
9729999	9730199	No.
9730239	9735684	But I worry about when I see these articles about how people believe that strong female leads won't sell.
9736444	9737665	That makes me sick.
9737786	9740508	Or the statistic that 18% of people are playing FemShep.
9741008	9743089	We think it would be a little closer to 50-50.
9743249	9745610	You know what really surprised me about that?
9745951	9750713	Just about every bit of the fandom I've seen has been surrounding a female Shepard.
9752614	9758617	Maybe once or twice we'll see a fic with a male Shepard or fan art of BroShep.
9759697	9760478	So, just saying.
9763018	9763318	All right.
9764999	9765219	Okay.
9765479	9766979	Oh, someone we haven't heard from for a while, Rob.
9767899	9769020	Hi, OLR Crew.
9769060	9772580	My email is directed towards Sky, who asked a simple question on episode 501.
9773361	9774621	What's coming to PlayStation Vita?
9775441	9780962	The answer to that is found on Reddit, where users compiled a list of upcoming games, even those without set release dates.
9781062	9782822	Here's the link so you can skim through the list.
9783163	9783683	I don't care.
9783923	9785323	I mean, hold on.
9788768	9789370	Freaking Reddit.
9790795	9792822	Guacamelee, which I kind of want to play.
9793886	9794708	It's super good.
9796665	9819473	Draw Slasher, Soul Calibur, Broken Destiny, Zombie Tycoon 2, Velocity Ultra, Muramasa Rebirth, Jak and Daxter, Dragon's Crown, Tearaway, Batman, Arkham Origins, Blackgate, Final Fantasy X-2 HD, Divekick, a bunch of Oddworld stuff, Malicious Rebirth.
9819493	9824055	There's a bunch of good stuff on this list, but I still don't think that... Oh, there's an Ys game on here, too.
9826969	9832271	But I don't know that it's going to be enough to really save it unless they can pull a miracle out of their ass.
9834131	9837092	Also, Sky, you have dabbled with games from your PlayStation.
9837152	9839713	Now, have you dabbled with games for your PlayStation Plus collection?
9840213	9846675	It seems a little unusual that you haven't brought up games from Plus that you haven't tried out before in the How Was Your Gaming Week segments.
9847035	9850876	I'm interested to hear what you have to say on games like Disgaea 3, The Cave, Closure, and others.
9851176	9851956	I did buy Closure.
9852696	9856021	Funny enough, I have The Cave sitting on my PlayStation 3 ready to play.
9856121	9859126	I just didn't get to it this week because I had that other game to review.
9859206	9861409	But yes, I have been trying to grab some of them.
9861990	9864715	The Cave specifically, I was curious in checking out.
9864755	9866117	So hopefully next week.
9866829	9868551	I did get closure, by the way, on Steam.
9868871	9869672	I just haven't played it yet.
9870793	9872094	So many games, so little time.
9872754	9874636	But thank you for the feedback on the Vita.
9875477	9878019	And we'll see what comes at E3.
9878059	9879801	I'm sure it's going to be a huge thing as well.
9880021	9881142	Okay, the end of this email?
9881462	9882423	I want some Pinkberry.
9882823	9883784	The nasty canasta.
9883984	9884425	Who doesn't?
9884925	9885806	I want some Pinkberry.
9887087	9887968	Okay, this one's kind of long.
9888849	9889910	Hello, OLR.
9892150	9897113	So sorry, by the way, guys, if I sound awful, I had an allergic reaction earlier, so.
9897153	9900055	I got me a Wii U a couple weeks ago, basic set.
9900515	9902396	I have been having a somewhat good time with it.
9902796	9907199	I'm already, I've already, I guess that should be got four games.
9907659	9908359	Super Mario Bros.
9908579	9911801	U, Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate, Scribblenauts Unlimited, and Injustice Gods Among Us.
9912262	9916044	Fun system that the touchpad is taking a lot more getting used to.
9916644	9929090	I'll probably not be buying a lot of non-exclusive games on the platform unless they've got pro controller or classic controller support, but it's proving to be not the embarrassing waste of time I thought it would be when the system came out.
9929790	9932832	I'm hoping and fully expecting the system to become a worthwhile addition to the collection.
9934212	9940637	Speaking of, it seems that Nintendo bullying out of the huge dick-waving contest that is the Mega Press Conference.
9941257	9942238	Oh, bowing out, sorry.
9943959	9944980	Yeah, we covered that earlier.
9945260	9949523	Personally, I love the idea that Nintendo is ditching the traditional conference this year in favor of targeted meetings.
9949963	9951424	The fewer charts I have to look at, the better.
9951924	9955387	However, it's sad that the gaming media is quick to bash on Nintendo.
9955747	9960630	Not that I'm a huge Nintendo fanboy, but I was always under the impression that we won the games.
9962391	9962611	Sorry.
9963892	9989482	how much of it do you guys feel it's just the people wanting to shit on Nintendo because they're not the graphics whore choice versus legitimate concerns about the company I think there's a lot of bandwagon bashing but I my thing with press conferences or release of information I don't give a shit how they do it as long as they do something and we find out what it is I only care about the information I don't care how they put it out I just care that they do that's me
9991198	9991438	Outro Music
10013410	10017752	Back to the... I need to actually pick this instead of email.
10018152	10022234	Lastly, my next hardware purchase is coming around July, and that is the Retron 5.
10022574	10028596	I'm not sure about your thoughts on clone consoles, but it sounds like they're going all out to ensure maximum compatibility.
10030057	10035519	And the 720p upscaling saves states and full-button customization for any controller you use on the thing.
10035959	10038360	That brings me to the question, where do you guys stand on retro gaming?
10038940	10045005	Do you want all the modern accoutrements that are offered by emulators and will be offered by the Retro 5?
10045065	10048347	Are you guys intolerant of any deviation from the original play limitations?
10048808	10049969	Me, I can go either way.
10050509	10055833	Though with five cartridge ports, this thing is going to be a sight more convenient than having my NES, NES, Genesis all at once.
10056234	10058916	And if only they can add in support for Turbo Duo and Sega CD.
10059696	10060557	Anyway, that's it for the email.
10060577	10061157	Thanks for reading.
10061197	10062198	Regards, RawSteelUT.
10063259	10066361	This is my thought about it, because given that I am in a position of both,
10067162	10072185	You did not put in the do not give a shit category because it all depends on my mood.
10072925	10085392	It depends on how much I feel like digging through boxes to pull out one of the Super Nintendos and plug it in and then where to find our copy of Chrono Trigger or Super Metroid or...
10086773	10113722	I prefer to play things on the original console if given my if I had the perfect vault if we had everything hooked back up again switch boxes and everything yeah I would be totally playing it on the original console because I can safely say I likely have the original console but if it's a quick thing or I want to play like a Seiken Densetsu 3 and there's an amazing fan translation out but I don't have a ROM burner
10114662	10120050	Then I'll play the emulator I'm not really picky If it's the only way I have to play it I'll play me some Power Rangers
10120865	10120945	Yes.
10120965	10121025	Yes.
10150000	10152342	Unboxed for about $150 on eBay.
10152402	10153182	We're going to be selling it.
10154243	10159587	That's like that chick that found the copy of Stadium Events at a thrift store and she's making bank off it.
10160327	10160747	Good for her.
10160767	10165370	Just the whole reason is that as much as we love the game, it's not going to be one that we're going to play a lot.
10167007	10173591	If we're looking at the collection, I'm almost always going to grab the Turbo Duo and play Dracula X. Which is the correct choice to make.
10174512	10178214	You know what I wish they would translate and re-burn on a CD?
10179375	10187439	Well, Sapphire was a great game, but Emerald Dragon was the RPG that came out on PC Engine Duo.
10187740	10189521	You just named a game I've never played.
10190381	10191782	Holy shit.
10192122	10193543	Well, I've also played Panorama Cotton.
10194477	10198560	Okay, yeah, but I mean, I don't unfortunately own a copy, but I have played it.
10198760	10201983	One of my friends that for a little while worked for Ubisoft in Japan owns a copy.
10203184	10204045	She wouldn't lend it to me.
10204065	10205746	I was like, you're going to Japan, let me borrow it.
10205966	10206226	No.
10207407	10210249	Let me say this quickly about the back to the email with the emulators and all that.
10211390	10215173	I really do like, you know, the retro gaming when it's done right.
10215453	10218456	And, you know, sometimes they're cheap cash-ins and you can tell.
10218976	10223400	I kind of wish companies in this day and age would do more, especially because, you know, we've shifted from...
10223880	10224560	Thanks for watching!
10244830	10245551	Or a better game.
10271134	10271775	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10292729	10295592	Pretty rad that we can fire up a two-player game.
10295632	10297533	Like, again, I'm going to use Ice Climbers as an example.
10297873	10300095	But, you know, we can do that anywhere.
10300155	10304819	We could sit in the car and play Ice Climber on 3DS.
10305479	10308021	Excuse me, versus, thanks to Virtual Console.
10308382	10309603	Like, I love that.
10310343	10315868	I would like to just see that pushed forward a little faster because the technology's, you know, there to get it online and all that.
10316508	10316728	Anyhow...
10317884	10318605	That's my thoughts.
10318665	10319485	We have another email.
10319765	10321046	All right.
10322728	10323768	That was from RallstillUT.
10323969	10325450	Okay, the last email.
10326590	10327271	Howdy, y'all.
10328272	10328832	I've got to say it right.
10329072	10329613	Howdy, y'all.
10330533	10330874	Howdy.
10330934	10331914	That's how I say it myself.
10332695	10337058	I was poking around in the Boston Red Sox official store today and marveled at all the shit you can buy there.
10337578	10338439	Seriously, look it up.
10338499	10342802	There's an astounding variety of items with the Boston Red Sox logo on it that you can waste your money on.
10343983	10346586	Is there an equivalent store for WoW memorabilia?
10347446	10347727	eBay.
10348968	10352551	Is there a place online where I can blow my money on a wide variety of WoW shit?
10353112	10356535	I mean, a sticker with your flying mount on it is a no-brainer to me.
10357056	10361620	That thing you use to get around in real life on the thing you use to get around in the real world?
10362160	10363081	That would be awesome.
10363361	10365103	Stay Black Redertainment Trainer.
10366905	10366965	Um...
10368948	10372311	You know... There's the Jinx store.
10372571	10374633	I think Geek has a lot of WoW stuff.
10375013	10375314	Yeah.
10376495	10379477	I don't know if there's a Blizzard company store.
10380218	10382920	Jinx is kind of like one of their official, I think, vendors.
10383181	10385322	They do a lot of that stuff.
10385343	10387364	Yeah, they're always at BlizzCon.
10387404	10389426	That's like J-Y-N-X, right?
10389666	10390207	I believe so.
10390247	10390907	Like the drag queen?
10391208	10394531	Yeah, or like the Pokemon drag queen.
10395612	10413907	I was gonna say too that I think if you look on Etsy there's a lot of fan made items that are really good I mean and I know that there are people out there who will like there's artists out there who will do commissioned work of your character and your mount and
10414347	10415288	The Current Lich King
10440291	10440672	Artis?
10440752	10441333	Not Artis.
10441393	10441853	Bolvar?
10442214	10442534	Yeah.
10442995	10446079	There's actually a picture of him on fire.
10446640	10447421	Oh, okay.
10447461	10448582	Not sitting on the throne.
10448722	10449864	He's just standing there on fire.
10449904	10450725	And he's called Lava Man.
10451106	10451646	You could have him.
10452327	10457394	You could have old actual Warcraft things, but all you need is the viewer and the ability to make the stickers.
10457634	10464736	I was also going to suggest, honestly, if your mall has a hot topic, I see Warcraft shirts in there all the time.
10466077	10473199	If you're wanting props and things or stuff to put on your wall, check with cosplay distributors.
10473699	10475040	Because you can get stuff there too.
10475080	10476080	I know people who make weapons.
10476960	10479541	Find a friend with a 3D printer and learn a CAD software.
10480262	10482163	Or what's that printer?
10482743	10485044	It's like a couple grand, but it's like an at-home 3D printer.
10485064	10486044	It's MakerBot?
10486145	10486705	Yeah, MakerBot.
10487325	10490967	Because I think people have done insignias and things for MakerBot.
10490987	10495969	You can also buy a monthly membership to TechShop and use their fancy ones.
10496129	10503413	I think that actually the school I go to now is going to be getting a 3D printer in the next couple years for the art design lab.
10505519	10518753	all right uh if that's it for the emails tonight yes indeed it is let's go to the FUs of the week it's a chance for us to be angsty because you know for 502 weeks now we've been carrying a little angst on this show
10534699	10536640	My F you goes to the pizza, actually.
10537361	10538821	To Papa Murphy's pizza in general.
10539162	10542784	Because this is actually the third time I've had an allergic reaction to Papa Murphy's pizza.
10543584	10545585	And it's been a different kind of pizza every time.
10546345	10550308	And, like, I'm talking about my tongue started to swell, my throat itched.
10551028	10552609	I'm so sorry, because it's so good.
10553169	10559493	I'm not complaining about how delicious the pizza was, but I was sitting here having... And, by the way, thank you for the medical.
10559813	10562915	I was sitting here, like, literally having one of those, like...
10563943	10567605	Weird allergic reactions with the rash and everything, and I'm like, oh my god.
10567625	10569286	Well, thank god Tim brings us drugs.
10569687	10570447	Thank you for that.
10570507	10571167	You're welcome.
10571848	10578532	But, I mean, this is the third time I've had pizza from Papa Murphy's and Reacted to it.
10579272	10581093	So, I don't think I'll be eating here again.
10582514	10582794	Loki.
10583635	10587517	Fuck you, United States Postal Service, for just chilling on my package.
10588418	10590279	Instead of just, you know, delivering my package.
10590299	10591579	Usually that's what you want people to do.
10593647	10594788	No, you don't want them to chill.
10594828	10596489	You want them to fucking move around.
10597249	10602673	You want them to be getting close to, you know, delivering the package.
10605815	10609837	And said no, they're just like... You want them to make that delivery.
10610318	10610898	Exactly.
10611218	10612059	Make the delivery.
10612959	10613640	Get moving!
10616802	10617863	I want my, ooh yeah!
10617943	10618063	Yeah!
10622913	10628922	F you to the crappy heat here in Sacramento today, because I wanted to take my friends to the flea market, but it was just too hot.
10629983	10634145	We'll go bargain hunting for video games in October.
10634365	10638226	Exactly with those two Sega prototype systems.
10638246	10641248	They're going for like multi-grand on eBay.
10641428	10642368	Bought for a dollar.
10642628	10643428	Yeah, I know, right?
10643889	10645829	Didn't they actually close down Auction Town?
10645849	10647070	Because that's where Trader Dan's was.
10647290	10647610	They did.
10647710	10651872	So you're going to have a really hard time finding the good game sales at the flea market.
10651892	10654573	You find some stuff at the flea market still, though.
10654633	10654993	You do.
10655013	10658354	I bet Trader Dan's started back up on eBay, though.
10658955	10659355	I would bet.
10660496	10662017	Captain Spike, do you have any FUs of the week?
10665239	10668481	Tim for preferring Super Mario Bros.
10668761	10682031	3 to Super Mario World and Rage quitting on me when we played Super Mario World and you for making me play Ice Climber Deal with it Alright, Tim, do you have any FUs of the week?
10682231	10687775	I do, it was a related note Fuck you, Magikoopa I am done with your shit
10690011	10690471	Fair enough.
10692312	10692632	All right.
10694453	10698514	Let us do a couple more stories, then we're going to open up the Skype line for a little bit.
10698534	10701475	We are running super long tonight, though, so I'm sorry.
10701495	10703276	I might have to abbreviate some of the end of the show here.
10703676	10705716	But let's at least get these news stories out of the way.
10705756	10706037	Loki.
10706237	10712659	Okay, so the second round of auctions for THQ happened, and some of your big franchises have gone to, well, mainly Nordic games.
10712739	10714739	They bought Darksiders and Red Faction.
10715100	10717300	And five games, guess what they get drawn to life?
10717660	10718561	So, yeah.
10719341	10726687	and then Gearbox actually got a hold of the Homeworld franchise.
10727508	10729730	The one that they were trying to buy via crowdfunding.
10731772	10739939	And Nord Games actually has been working with THQ for a while now talking sequels and they're hopefully going to get the same developers back on board.
10740960	10745784	Also they purchased MX vs. ATV and Titan Quest were the other two franchises they bought.
10746244	10765102	And then THQ sold all this money to a lot of people, including Double Fine, Codemasters for F1, and hell, they even own Ruben some money because different, I guess, bonuses or whatever.
10765163	10766564	Employee obligations, they said.
10769983	10773445	One more story for you guys tonight, and I think this is very interesting.
10773505	10779689	It's one of those things I'm kind of surprised didn't happen sooner, but lately we've talked about a lot of crappy games.
10780409	10788673	Or I shouldn't say necessarily they're crappy games, because there's still people that love them, but games that get a crappy reputation based on the internet.
10789074	10793096	Games such as SimCity, Mass Effect 3 and the ending.
10793936	10796238	Aliens, Colonial Marines, Duke Nukem Forever.
10796278	10796898	Well, you know what?
10796918	10802822	Before all of that, there was E.T., the extraterrestrial on the Atari 2600.
10803502	10807285	But see, when I was seven, it wasn't as bad as everyone made it out to be.
10807305	10810067	But the most frustrating thing was you always fell in the damn pit, right?
10810647	10811648	Well, here's the interesting thing.
10812148	10816831	A hacker went back and fixed some of the problems people have with the game.
10817211	10819613	And now people are like, this game's not so bad.
10819673	10820473	It's kind of fun.
10820893	10822374	So what were the things that were changed?
10822414	10826777	Well, for one, they made ET an actual ET color instead of, you know, that green.
10827397	10831559	And most importantly, they fixed the falling in the pit all the time.
10831599	10837062	Instead of one pixel colliding with the pit, it's a different collision detection, which makes it far less frustrating.
10837703	10839424	You're not always falling in that stupid pit.
10840505	10846674	So, now just so you guys know, Howard Scott Warshaw made the original game and he was really rushed for time.
10846854	10851120	As a lot of the movie tie-in games were at the time, he only had months to make it.
10851281	10853664	Same thing happened with Pac-Man and why that turned out so bad too.
10854706	10855327	Isn't that funny?
10855347	10856088	Pac-Man was awful.
10856388	10857388	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10877755	10883541	But anyway, neocomputer.org is the one that made the project that tried to fix some of E.T.
10883521	10884542	's problems.
10885022	10892269	And I believe the project ended up getting done by David Richardson, who goes by the handle Recompile.
10892770	10893691	And that's pretty cool.
10894332	10895293	Uh, from Atari Age.
10895333	10900301	He single-handedly, I guess, maybe this, like, started the discussion there, but he single-handedly ended up putting it together.
10900841	10909054	And, uh, fixed the well, fixed the difficulty settings, so, like, not every step will drain your energy, and some of this stuff.
10909114	10909615	So, uh...
10910055	10910876	Yeah, pretty cool.
10910896	10913418	And it even showed tutorial videos and how they did it.
10913978	10919442	Yeah, and they even have, if you want to do the ROM hack yourself, they give you the addresses and what to change in the hex editor.
10919883	10924166	I bet somebody like you is like, well, I mean, I know you don't hack a lot of Atari 2600, but this is still pretty fascinating.
10924186	10925727	That was the one that's already done.
10925767	10926808	You can download the ROM, I think.
10926948	10927368	Yeah, yeah.
10928429	10929050	But very cool.
10930972	10934095	It's almost like how people will hack SimCity to play offline.
10935336	10937879	Or fix alien colonial marines.
10937899	10939200	It's just funny.
10939821	10940982	Alright, so there you go.
10941823	10943705	That's it for the official stories we have tonight.
10944586	10946707	Let me open up the Skype line.
10946727	10950611	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
10950931	10952973	If you want to go ahead and give us a call, that would be awesome.
10954794	10964463	If you want to talk about something we talked about on the show tonight or something you think we missed, what you've been playing, you have a question for Captain Spike or Tim and want to talk about whatever, give us a call.
10964783	10965143	Say hello.
10965163	10968006	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10968366	10968927	Last Minute Stories
10991770	10997373	I don't think that... Again, I'm not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater and say Batman sucks because they're adding multiplayer to it.
10997393	10999334	Because Mass Effect 3, it was fine.
10999695	11001195	I really love the multiplayer Mass Effect 3.
11001556	11009980	But I understand where people have some great reservations, especially hearing it's a new studio and now all this other... It kind of sounds like they're trying to do this one on the cheap.
11011001	11012502	That is a big concern.
11015988	11017990	So, you're agreeing with me over there, Spike?
11018490	11019031	I do agree.
11019131	11019371	Yeah.
11020052	11023515	Which is, because Arkham City is so fucking good.
11023615	11028439	Like, this next game, to live up to that legacy, is really going to have to be a step above that.
11028479	11032002	When you hear things like this, you kind of go, not sure if want.
11034003	11034344	We'll see.
11034384	11035865	I'm sure E3's going to answer a lot of that.
11036305	11036686	Anything else?
11036706	11041009	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to call.
11041070	11041470	All one word.
11042373	11052676	Real quick, Tigerclaw in chat says the reason why the new Batman game has a younger version actor is because the game takes place years before Arkham Asylum, it's a prequel that's why they went with somebody younger
11073805	11074985	and that's an excuse.
11075005	11078506	He's a voice actor.
11079306	11083047	He's played younger Batman in different animated series and what have you.
11083087	11084607	He's been doing this voice a long time.
11084627	11085727	He's very good.
11085867	11087868	They also didn't hear your mic off or something?
11088368	11093289	He's done Teenage Bruce Wayne and did a wonderfully believable job.
11094349	11095509	Alright, we got a phone call here.
11095529	11096729	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
11096789	11097389	Who's this?
11098990	11099730	Hey, what's up, buddy?
11103390	11103730	Hey.
11104770	11105831	Oh, not a whole lot.
11106091	11108712	I'm just, you know, hanging in there.
11109392	11110932	Well, what did you want to call us about tonight?
11113133	11118375	Well, I had a, uh... Hang on, let me mute my... Are you here?
11118455	11120935	Did you forget to mute your radio before you called in?
11123016	11123756	Yeah, I was trying to.
11123936	11124657	I forgot, sorry.
11125017	11125817	No, I had a, uh...
11133396	11138097	Heck yeah, I want to... Wait, didn't DarkSakura have dibs on that?
11138337	11139577	Something with La Mulana on Steam?
11139677	11139897	Yeah.
11139917	11142478	If you want it.
11142678	11144858	Because I was like, if she ain't taking it, I'm taking it.
11144938	11145898	Shit, I want to play it.
11145998	11147858	I came super close to buying it until I remembered.
11148379	11149039	Oh, there you go.
11149259	11157260	So... Well, as much as I would love to give a key away to the listeners, I think we want to kind of keep it for ourselves.
11157320	11162581	Sorry, but I want to play... Only because you rave about it so much do we want to play it for ourselves.
11165546	11167348	Why should we all be playing La Mulana?
11167368	11172492	Well, it's a fun game.
11172532	11178296	It's like, you know, those old school games were tough, but, you know.
11179277	11183620	Yeah, but isn't La Mulana like Asshole Mario Hard?
11186278	11189599	It can be, but once you get the hang of it.
11189899	11191859	It's just memorizing patterns, just like old Mega Man games.
11191879	11192359	You know what?
11192699	11198400	I will be magnanimous and donate that code to you.
11198880	11199800	Yay!
11200741	11210222	Alright, DarkTetsuya, I thank you very much for donating the code to us and feeding our gaming addiction further.
11210842	11214003	Actdeft in the chatroom says, La Mulana is your Mass Effect.
11214443	11214663	True?
11216018	11217079	I bet he doesn't have tarantula.
11217099	11218500	Yeah, I suppose so.
11219701	11219961	All right.
11220242	11223945	Well, Dr. Suya, is there anything else you want to talk with us about tonight?
11226527	11228148	I just had a question.
11228389	11228649	Yeah.
11230570	11233453	So I was planning on Best of Three.
11234173	11234454	Yeah.
11234774	11235034	Right?
11236455	11241860	I kind of need Episode 169 to finish working on it.
11243554	11248639	Oh, for, um, uh, is this, this is the, um, the, is this the DDR step file stuff?
11250521	11253324	Oh, no, it's the, uh, Best Hits compilation.
11253344	11255286	Oh, so you, you need episode 169?
11255326	11256427	You don't have that?
11256447	11256947	I think it's at 159.
11261008	11261168	Uh-uh.
11287219	11287841	Not a big deal.
11288202	11288964	All right.
11289025	11290790	Well, DarkSakura, we're going to let you go to get more calls.
11290950	11291592	Take care, okay?
11292435	11293077	All right.
11293097	11293558	Bye-bye.
11295086	11298447	Sorry, he had some type of echo going on in the background and it kind of made it hard for me to hear.
11298467	11300208	I think he didn't really mute the computer.
11300688	11302248	Or he had the TV on in the background.
11302268	11304029	He's trying to watch Chair of Swords.
11305189	11305989	Damn that show.
11307750	11308790	Listen to us at the same time.
11308950	11310631	By the way, though, I did find a character I like.
11311391	11311811	Daenerys.
11312311	11313632	Because she sets people on fire.
11315752	11319494	She inquires about the location of her dragons.
11319514	11323135	1-877-GAME-OLR or use your name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
11323175	11324095	Loki, can you talk again?
11325572	11327953	I'm talking and my mic is not working.
11327993	11329853	Why has your mic just suddenly stopped working?
11329873	11330593	That's weird.
11331093	11333374	Because your board is possessed.
11333954	11335154	Maybe it just needs to be dusted.
11335214	11336634	It is kind of gray.
11336654	11341315	I wonder if our board might just be... I mean, we've had that board six years now.
11343956	11345356	It was a damn expensive board.
11345396	11346176	It should last.
11347217	11347577	I know.
11347637	11348217	I'm just saying.
11348817	11349617	That's the reality.
11349657	11350537	We might need something else.
11350997	11352258	Maybe it just needs to be cleaned out.
11352558	11353378	The contacts need to be
11354184	11355125	We'll work on it.
11355945	11356605	Live radio.
11356645	11357286	Ain't it a blast?
11357306	11363189	Because we didn't learn that we were going to have audio problems until like Bobby's call tonight.
11363209	11364030	Yeah, really, right?
11364490	11364790	All right.
11365851	11368032	I'm going to just leave it open a little longer for another call.
11368052	11370434	1-877-GAME-OLR or use your name on Skype.
11370594	11372735	Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
11373535	11377557	I'm going to quickly try to comb the Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR.
11378737	11380078	TigerClaw sending us a tweet.
11380258	11383959	Eve Online getting a TV show based on real player stories.
11384459	11386540	Hmm, isn't that kind of like what Defiance is doing?
11387240	11390542	But yeah, Eve Online, of course, is an MMO that's been around for a while.
11390582	11392862	It's that whole space one.
11392902	11393763	Isn't that the one where...
11394443	11401527	They had all that loot of game time cards that were on a ship and the ship exploded and all that money is just gone.
11402967	11405849	So yeah, EVE Online is going to get a TV show based on the stories and game.
11405869	11406429	That's pretty cool.
11407269	11409490	Can you imagine if they turned fanfic into TV shows?
11409510	11411612	Because that's essentially what they're saying here.
11411632	11414313	Well, I don't know.
11414333	11416354	They did it for Mass Effect with the Citadel DLC.
11417695	11418595	I was going to say that.
11419855	11421578	Except for creepy Shaga.
11423420	11424142	Yeah, that really upset me.
11424162	11425203	That was so date rapey.
11425443	11425984	Oh my god.
11427466	11429109	I felt dirty watching it on YouTube.
11431661	11432602	Just filthy.
11434343	11434703	Let's see.
11434903	11440646	Also at Twitter.com slash OLR a tweet from Actdeft.
11441367	11444409	The third Skullgirls DLC character voting has ended.
11444449	11447811	The fans chose Eliza, an Egyptian-based character.
11448231	11450773	You know, Skullgirls is pretty tight with the brony community.
11451613	11453694	I'm not surprised that Actdeft's reporting on this.
11453854	11456896	That's a big thing I see on my Tumblr page a lot, actually.
11456996	11457356	Brony?
11457576	11458196	No, Skullgirls.
11458276	11458837	Oh, Skullgirls?
11458977	11459217	Yeah.
11459737	11462238	That was a big stint of Skullgirls stuff for a while.
11462319	11463899	That was a great alliance that they made.
11463919	11465080	Let's be real.
11465680	11467081	So, that's Twitter topics.
11467101	11469122	Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
11471403	11472164	Nobody's calling.
11472404	11473464	Nobody wants to say hi.
11473524	11474025	How sad.
11474485	11475745	Come on, call us.
11476926	11478247	We won't yell at you much.
11478687	11480628	Fifth Dream in chat says that's who they voted for.
11481786	11485408	So, River City Ransom 2 is supposed to be getting a Kickstarter.
11485469	11486669	Oh, wait, here, here.
11486970	11489031	Wait, no, she read that during the Rapid Fire News.
11489051	11489331	Yeah.
11489671	11493334	I just want to remind everybody to kickstart it when it actually comes online.
11493514	11494495	But it's not the real thing.
11494515	11495715	Who cares?
11496836	11498637	It has to be Kunio or it's nothing else.
11498718	11500319	Also, Among the Sleep looks awesome.
11500679	11501559	I kickstarted that one.
11502460	11509005	Among the Sleep, it's the one, it's a survivor horror, the horror game where you play as a two-year-old from the perspective of a two-year-old.
11509025	11509705	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
11510065	11511046	I would play the hell out of that.
11511601	11514043	Kickstarting, right now, they need money It's not over yet
11536511	11539153	Alright, well, our listeners are being shy tonight.
11539273	11539734	Oh, come on.
11539754	11540394	Give them one more chance.
11540535	11541295	Alright, one more chance.
11541375	11545359	I'll leave it open a little bit longer here.
11545559	11546660	Oh, I didn't do... Thank you.
11546700	11547460	This is how we can fill time.
11547480	11548041	Yeah, listless.
11548281	11549102	Listless results.
11549122	11550163	And you didn't do Twitter topics, did you?
11550283	11550623	Thank you.
11550883	11552605	Yeah, I did.
11552685	11553445	I wasn't paying attention.
11553646	11554026	I know, right?
11554466	11555567	Everybody's out of it tonight.
11555607	11559270	These sound problems just snowballed into LOL.
11559631	11561112	Alright, let's go over listless results now.
11564056	11565658	You know why I didn't do listless results?
11565678	11567039	Because in my head, I already know.
11567079	11568400	I already tabulated them up.
11568961	11569582	All right, here we go.
11569622	11571163	We don't live in your head, thank God.
11571404	11574587	Here it is, the definitive list as voted on by the listeners.
11574687	11576649	Mascot, we are going to donate to Sega.
11577048	11581470	In a close fourth place, worth mentioning, Master System the Sega Robot.
11581490	11583991	In a very close fourth place.
11584612	11588513	Honestly, the way the listeners voted tonight is really perfect, I've got to say.
11588733	11590674	So I cannot argue with this at all.
11591155	11591875	Number three.
11592355	11595196	The number three answer for mascot we will donate to Sega.
11595657	11598278	An amalgamation of all of Sonic's shitty friends.
11599358	11600519	It's the one I would have voted for.
11601141	11602102	There it is, number three.
11602782	11607185	Number two, as voted by the listeners, President Cat.
11607645	11608726	Yay.
11608746	11609567	Fair enough, fair enough.
11609607	11610387	We love you, Rina.
11610767	11616331	And the number one answer of mascot, we will, and I don't know how we're going to do this.
11616391	11619333	Maybe I can get somebody to put together a little clip art, something for us.
11619373	11621875	We can actually send this to Sega, like a nice little envelope.
11622275	11629120	The number one answer that we will gift on behalf of OLR, a forklift, ladies and gentlemen.
11630000	11630901	A forklift.
11632362	11633122	I approve.
11633882	11635083	Does the forklift have a name?
11635303	11638364	A forklift one out of all the crazy things Rob would have had to dress up in?
11638724	11639004	Really?
11639665	11640225	And Loki.
11640525	11641085	Forky.
11642406	11644067	Forky the forklift.
11644927	11645447	You know what?
11646228	11646708	I'll draw it.
11647008	11650630	Can't the name be QQQQ so it's Forky the forklift?
11651150	11653051	Oh my god, that's great.
11654311	11655432	Forky the forklift.
11655852	11657052	And then he comes into that song.
11657072	11657733	No, that's Taku.
11661792	11662433	Alright, there it is.
11662453	11663493	Your winner of the list tonight.
11663533	11668477	Don't give that disapproving... It's funny and you know it.
11668497	11669658	It's my default look.
11670078	11670819	You're so mean.
11674241	11675542	Sometimes I wish it were a TV show.
11675562	11678324	Dungeon Buster wants to see the forklift fight the Daytona car.
11678344	11680106	I don't know.
11680126	11681267	The forklift would fight dirty.
11682808	11684629	It would just get under the car and flip it.
11685229	11688532	But the Daytona car has the power of AM2 behind it.
11691400	11692321	Perfect.
11692461	11692761	All right.
11693362	11695083	Again, the Skype line not lighting up.
11695123	11696044	What's up with y'all?
11696704	11698145	So I'm going to close it.
11698206	11698586	Sorry.
11698626	11699627	Maybe Skype screwed up.
11699707	11700047	Why not?
11700347	11701888	Everything else is screwed up on a nice show.
11701928	11702329	Why not Skype?
11702409	11703029	Why not Skype?
11703149	11703450	All right.
11703790	11707213	Well, that is about going to wrap it up for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.
11707333	11711156	But before we go around and get all the final thoughts tonight, I really want to thank our guests for being here tonight.
11711876	11714699	Tim, I'm glad we could pop your podcast cherry.
11715786	11717367	I'm glad to have you do it.
11718908	11720169	And I'm glad that you liked my gift.
11721130	11722071	Yes, thank you very much.
11722091	11724272	I'm going to slap you when we get home tonight.
11725793	11727414	Isn't that a little TMI?
11727515	11729276	Come on, you guys.
11730016	11733939	But good luck with whatever it is you guys are working on next.
11734520	11738102	And thanks for talking about how you got into gaming and all that stuff with us tonight.
11738382	11739143	Sure, it was my pleasure.
11739763	11743446	You have a Twitter or anything you might... If listeners want to follow you further or whatever...
11743982	11770321	sure I Tim TRP at Twitter I'm sort of Tim TRP at everything because I have no imagination if you have any more questions for me or questions about you know getting into the game industry or whatever I'm happy to happy to talk to you about it all right awesome I'll be sure to give you my resume Captain Spike it's about fucking time you came back to the show thanks for being here I literally haven't seen you in years even if you are so mean to me all of the time but that's all right
11770521	11772042	I am mean to you all the time.
11772282	11774242	It's like my second favorite thing to do.
11774462	11776683	But it comes out of a place of love, or at least it better.
11778164	11779704	Okay, we can go with that.
11779884	11780384	You dick.
11780464	11780744	All right.
11782265	11784906	Gamebuoy.org if they want to hear your own show.
11785406	11789007	Yeah, it's terribly... Which I take back every nice thing I said about it earlier in the show.
11789627	11792468	It's terribly unlikely given how big of a dick I've been tonight.
11793068	11796890	But on the off chance anyone does care, gamebuoy.org...
11798684	11819626	gaming news and views that aren't on your radar but maybe should be we'd really appreciate the hits and I just want to say so much thank all three of you so much for having me here tonight it's actually been quite a bit of fun and I really do wish it hadn't been like seven years since last time I was on well make better and come back on a more regular basis at some point I would love to fantastic love it
11820086	11820366	All right.
11821506	11824928	Well, we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts so we can close up shop tonight.
11826088	11827668	Loki, who doesn't have a microphone?
11827728	11829409	Loki, do you have a final thought tonight?
11829589	11830909	I wish my microphone worked.
11832290	11832730	Fair enough.
11833570	11834810	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?
11835051	11836231	My throat feels like a desert.
11837251	11840392	And my final thought tonight is haters to the left.
11843873	11846234	Captain Spike, your final thought tonight?
11848555	11849695	I hate you so much.
11851912	11856034	And last but not least, Tim, your final thoughts tonight?
11856435	11862838	I just ate some potato chips that taste like they're Doritos, and they taste like Doritos tacos.
11863459	11865400	And in the computer science world, we call that recursion.
11867412	11868613	Recursive Chips.
11870274	11870554	Love it.
