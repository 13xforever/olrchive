0	19440	Today, April 28th, 2013, Microsoft sets a date to announce their next move.
19440	23520	More video games are set to become movies, and can you really get pizza delivered with
23520	24520	your 360?
24520	36320	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of Orange
36320	37760	Lounge Radio.
37760	40720	It's the show where every gamer has a voice.
40720	44120	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you to talk about video games, and gaming
44120	47920	culture, and the gamer lifestyle over the next few hours with my co-hosts.
47920	51080	First off, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
51080	52080	Hello.
52080	53080	How are you, Jamie Summers?
53080	55440	Um, uh, sated.
55440	56440	Sated or satiated?
56440	59440	Could you do that pizza?
59440	62120	But wouldn't that be- Oh, whatever.
62120	63120	Alright.
63120	68400	Well, uh, grammar specifics aside- And, and, um, just to tell PrinceBrightStar,
68400	70320	I've been playing PSO, too.
70320	72720	What is, what is, what is the, what did he ask?
72720	73720	I missed it.
73720	76280	Well, he mentioned Phantasy Star Online, too, so he's just affirming that, yes, I did get
76280	78280	everything to work.
78280	79520	Awesome.
79520	81280	Was that with all the patches and all that stuff?
81280	85880	Yes, but I have to re-patch my game and re-do the translations and blah, and I've had other
85880	87400	stuff to play.
87400	89480	Alright, also say hello to TechMasterLoki.
89480	90480	Hi.
90480	91760	How are you, Loki?
91760	92760	Doing good.
92760	93760	Good.
93760	94760	What's new with you?
94760	95760	I'm collecting drugs.
95760	96760	You're collecting drugs?
96760	103440	Well, I'm finishing my pickups on, uh, the collectibles in Saints Row the Third.
103440	105720	Ah, I see what you did there.
105720	106720	Okay.
106720	108520	Uh, I thought you were all done with Saints Row the Third.
108520	111040	I am, but- It's like a platinum trophy thing.
111040	112040	Sort of.
112040	113040	It's on Steam, though.
113040	114040	Oh, okay.
114040	115040	Fair enough.
115040	116040	Same, same.
116040	118600	Alright, um, we have some guests joining us in the studio tonight, and I'm really excited
118600	122240	about this because, um, these are guys I've been trying to get on the show for a very,
122240	123960	very, very, very, very long time.
123960	128080	Uh, these guys are long-time friends of mine, and, um, I think one of them was here, like,
128080	130600	seven years ago, but how many of you are listening then?
130600	132680	Like 98% of you, this is all new.
132680	139360	Please say hello, everybody, to, from the GameBui.org podcast, say hello to Captain
139360	140360	Spike.
140360	141360	Hi!
141360	142360	Hi!
142360	143360	How are you, Spike?
143360	146000	Uh, doing pretty good, thank you for having me.
146000	147640	No problem!
147640	151400	And also joining us in the studio tonight, say hello to Tim!
151400	152400	Hello!
152400	153800	How are you, Tim?
153800	154960	I am quaking in my boots.
154960	156800	This is my first podcast ever.
156800	157800	Is it really?
157800	158800	Yep.
158800	164680	Wow, you're like- This is also Rob's first podcast, though.
164680	169200	So, we've stolen your, uh, guest virginity.
169200	170200	I suppose so.
170200	172040	I'm a little bit uncomfortable thinking about it that way.
172040	176160	You even got the little virginity music playing there in the background.
176160	179640	So yeah, there's, like, every idiot has a podcast in this day and age.
179640	184180	No disrespect to those of you doing podcasts, but, like, Captain Spike, I'm calling myself
184180	185180	an idiot.
185180	189280	But no, like, you know, it's so easy to do that these days, it's really surprising to
189280	193440	me, you've never done this before.
193440	195080	But we'll be gentle, I promise.
195080	196080	Thank you.
196080	197080	All right, you're welcome.
197080	198080	Um, so I wanted to-
198080	199080	Break out the feathers.
199080	202520	Before we get into, like, how was your gaming week and all that, I want to talk to you guys
202520	204640	kind of, like, about, like, the things you guys do.
204640	206160	So I'm gonna start with Spike.
206160	210560	So a few years ago, um, I know you came on OLR, like, seven years ago, that was back
210560	212440	when I lived with Xtifer, right?
212440	213440	It sure was, yeah.
213440	216080	Do you remember what we even talked about then?
216080	217880	I have no idea.
217880	218880	How did you and I meet?
218880	220240	Tell the listeners.
220240	221560	The internet, Adam.
221560	226600	And then, you know, you know, we were on a message board, there was a, you know, IRL
226600	232400	meetup party, we went to said party independently, got drunk, and smoked cloves outside for like
232400	233400	an hour.
233400	234400	Don't smoke, guys.
234400	235400	It's bad for you.
235400	236400	No, smoking is bad.
236400	237400	Yeah, so we quit.
237400	238400	Okay, I have to ask.
238400	239400	They were the dejarmes, right?
239400	240400	Oh, I'm sure.
240400	241400	Oh, death.
241400	242960	Like there's anything other.
242960	247720	Um, so, so fast forward to today, you've got your podcast now.
247720	248880	Tell us about Game Buoy.
248880	254240	Yeah, so I host the gamebuoy.org video game podcast.
254240	258520	Our sort of aim is just to pick up stories that are getting left off the radar of all
258520	265320	the blogs, sort of pick up stories on indies, JRPGs, just sort of, you know, niche genres
265320	270080	that maybe aren't getting the play that they really deserve in the news.
270080	273880	I joked earlier that any idiot can have a podcast, and obviously, you know, I'm not
273880	277680	being rude with that, but it's like, it is so easy to do it now, but, but surely you
277680	280800	kind of have to take that step, like, why do I want to do a podcast?
280800	283440	So why, Captain Spike, did you want to do a podcast?
283440	288400	Well, you know, fitting in with what I just said, it kind of irritates me that, and, you
288400	292960	know, certainly no offense to any podcast, any podcasters that are listening to this,
292960	297360	but I really wanted to cover some bases that I feel like aren't getting a lot of coverage.
297360	298640	That's fair.
298640	303480	Especially, you know, we started, um, Retronauts was sort of kind of going away and we have
303480	307680	a real strong retro bent to sort of what we do, so.
307680	309720	And you didn't need $35,000 to do this.
309720	311000	No tea, no shade.
311000	313000	No, all tea, all shade.
313000	314720	We do it for free.
314720	316160	We spend money on it.
316160	317760	So no, we're not getting paid.
317760	318760	Okay.
318760	322320	Well, that's, but I like, I like that you guys have a niche and you know, I've had people
322320	327200	ask me before because we've had, have, have had this podcast a long, long, long, long
327200	328200	time.
328200	331520	Sometimes people will ask when they want to get into a podcast like, Hey, Rob, how do
331520	332520	I start a podcast?
332520	335320	And usually my first thing is, okay, if you're going to start a video game podcast, I'm going
335320	336320	to warn you.
336320	341160	It's a very, there's a lot of people in this pool and people have peed in this pool and
341160	343200	yeah, it's kind of gross.
343200	345440	There's a lot of stuff, but you got to find your niche.
345440	348160	You've got to be like, how am I going to stand out amongst this?
348160	350200	You know, how am I going to wear the prettiest bathing suit?
350200	352000	It's going to get me noticed, right?
352000	356360	So you guys have your niche and I think it's, it's, it's fun because you guys don't like
356360	360200	just talk about under the radar news, but I noticed you kind of theme a lot of your
360200	361200	episodes.
361200	365560	So you'll have like your one big topic that keeps a lot of your shows timeless in a way
365560	366560	I noticed.
366560	370320	Well, that was, you know, very much a conscious choice, but, um, we, we really wanted to have
370320	375080	sort of a level of intellectual discourse about sort of these big topics that a lot
375080	379200	of people maybe don't talk about and have, you know, real discussions about.
379200	380200	Gotcha.
380200	384280	So it's, it's you and you and, uh, what do you call him on the show?
384280	385280	I know his real name.
385280	386280	What's his first mate?
386280	387280	Slidekick.
387280	388280	That is that his first mate.
388280	389280	Slidekick.
389280	390280	Yeah.
390280	391280	Yeah.
391280	392280	And you guys, you guys have been buds forever, right?
392280	394520	I've known that guy for, I don't know, probably 10 years nearly.
394520	395520	Yeah.
395520	398220	And Slidekick's my frenemy in the wow podcasting community.
398220	399220	So that's always a lot of fun.
399220	400220	Yeah.
400220	401220	Heart, heart, heart, heart.
401220	404340	You all might remember his classic show, Fabulous Flames.
404340	406340	I still have episodes on my phone.
406340	409780	So you were the subscriber.
409780	410780	That was me.
410780	411780	I'm just kidding.
411780	413180	You were their leech and a fan.
413180	418180	I would, it was when I ran out of history podcasts and I was like, well, there's always
418180	421460	this one and I'd sit in my cube snorting the whole time.
421460	424460	People were like, what do you want?
424460	427780	But we didn't come here just to shade, you know, Slidekick cause I was always in chat
427780	429540	and everything.
429540	430540	You're so mean.
430540	433960	Um, so let me talk, let me talk about like you as a gamer.
433960	437220	So obviously you must've been into all the music games and stuff like we were cause you
437220	438820	were on the show at that time.
438820	442100	Um, what, how did you get into gaming at all?
442100	444060	Like how did you start playing video games?
444060	445740	What, what, what hooked you into this?
445740	447100	Why are you a gamer?
447100	449100	Um, why am I a gamer?
449100	454360	Um, my mother worked in a bowling alley and they had tons of arcade games.
454400	459880	So I kind of fell in love with Kung Fu and you know, the old Irem game, I think it was
459880	461520	Irem, I don't know.
461520	468720	And uh, after that, you know, got a Nintendo for the NES port Kung Fu and went from there.
468720	469720	Awesome.
469720	472040	What, what's like your favorite video games ever?
472040	475240	What are like your favorite things that have ever been done?
475240	478760	Uh, Super Mario World and Bayonetta.
478760	481120	Bayonetta is one of your top games ever.
481160	486840	I think it has some of the best, uh, like situational awareness in a 3d action game
486840	487840	that I've ever seen.
487840	488840	Yeah.
488840	489840	Interesting.
489840	493940	I really liked the way that it visually communicates what it expects of you in terms of reaction
493940	494940	and what have you.
494940	498000	Those are just, they're not two games you would typically expect to see sitting together.
498000	501760	Like if I'm, if I'm going to the video game museum, I'm not going to see Mario World next
501760	502760	to Bayonetta.
502760	504080	But no, I think that's great.
504080	508720	You know, a lot of people don't usually dare to name for all practical purposes a current
508720	509720	game.
509720	518800	I think it's super well designed and you know, I think that Super Mario World is certainly
518800	522040	the best 2d, best designed 2d platformer.
522040	526200	Um, you know, so you must've been excited about virtual console this week.
526200	527200	Yeah.
527200	530920	The first thing I did was download it and play it until my, uh, second player rage quit
530920	531920	on me.
531920	534440	Sorry about, uh, magic Koopa.
534440	535440	No, that is crap.
536160	540280	Um, gosh, what else I want to ask you about games?
540280	541280	Um, okay.
541280	547400	Bayonetta 2 then, and this whole, it's exclusive for Nintendo, like where, where are you at
547400	548400	with Nintendo?
548400	549400	Where's your head at?
549400	554800	Because some people are very like, Nintendo sucks and it's a kitty thing and dah, dah,
554800	555800	dah, dah.
555800	558260	But here they are coming out with Bayonetta 2, like where's your head out with that?
558260	561300	I think they make a lot of really bad business choices.
561540	567980	I think that, um, you know, them paying for Bayonetta 2 to exist is awesome, but probably
567980	570740	also a bad business choice.
570740	572820	But it's one I'm certainly going to benefit from.
572820	573820	So I'm happy.
573820	575920	Uh, go to our chat room.
575920	581260	We always have the other guests on our show, the live chat room, live.vognetwork.com because
581260	585180	we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right
585180	587220	after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
587900	593580	And looking at our chat room, we see some comments such as, um, let's see, Dungeon Buster
593580	595280	says Bayonetta rocks.
595280	598500	Tiger Claw says Kung Fu was one of those games that were quarter munchers.
598500	602080	Once you had the NES version, you blow right through the entire game.
602080	603360	Absolutely true.
603360	604360	That's true.
604360	605880	And then does it, does it lose something though?
605880	609080	Once you play it on the console, like can you go back and play it in the arcade now
609080	610460	that you've just beat it?
610460	614460	No, but I mean, you know why I didn't really want to either.
614460	618780	I was too busy, you know, taking my picture with my TV and trying to get in to the pages
618780	622540	of Nintendo fun club, Nintendo power, you know.
622540	623540	Awesome.
623540	625580	Uh, let's see.
625580	631740	And going to, um, Ross DOUT says arcade games were nonsensically hard in order to drain
631740	632740	quarters.
632740	633740	Of course they were.
633740	634740	I always think of that.
634740	640060	Um, you remember Wayne's world, which turned 20 years old apparently this month.
640060	642220	How old does that make you feel at me feel right now?
642220	643220	Right.
643220	644220	He's 20 years old.
644220	645220	Right.
645220	649740	So there's a scene where they're talking about the arcade and the guy goes, yeah, we just
649740	650740	got this new game.
650740	653500	But when you killed the gelatinous cube, you get to go to the next level.
653500	655340	The trick is there is no gelatinous cube.
655340	660940	He never shows up and I'm like, Oh, that's like so old arcade machine.
660940	661940	Like I love it.
661940	666100	That's up there with the boss of carnival being named token taker.
666100	669460	Uh, let's see.
669460	675180	And um, slide kick in chat, uh, agreeing with Tim apparently saying magic Koopa is a ratchet
675180	676180	hoe.
676180	677180	There you go.
677180	678180	Thank you.
678180	679180	Slidekick.
679180	680180	All right.
680180	683740	Um, so if people want to check out your podcast, which I do recommend, it's, it's a, it's a
683740	684740	great listen.
684740	688500	Even if you guys are only doing it every other week and I'd like to see you do it more often,
688500	689500	but no pressure.
689500	690500	What's with that?
690500	691940	What you're being so rude.
691940	692940	That's a compliment.
692940	693940	I am a guest.
693940	694940	No, that's a compliment.
694940	696380	That means I want more of it.
696380	697380	Right.
697380	698380	How's that a bad thing?
698380	699380	Okay.
700300	702140	Good things come to those who wait.
702140	703140	That's true.
703140	706740	Um, you know, the easiest way to hear us is just to go over to a game, buoy.org.
706740	713620	Um, but you know, we're also on iTunes game, buoy podcast, hard to miss.
713620	719580	And the art actually looks like a little game boy, but get it boy.
719580	720580	It's great.
720580	721580	I like it.
721580	722580	All right.
722580	725620	Um, what, uh, Oh, let me ask one other question about your podcast.
725620	730780	Um, you, since, since you have a lot of like timeless segments, a lot of your shows, you
730780	734180	know, are, are, you can go back and listen to it now, even though some of the news might
734180	737620	be outdated, you know, the, you got a good, good chunk that's timeless.
737620	740420	What do you think is one of like your best episodes of the ones you've done so far?
740420	743780	Like if I, if I need to go back and find like a good conversation, which one would you like
743780	745100	recommend most?
745100	746100	Okay.
746100	752100	So, um, the longest episode we've done so far is that we did sort of a breakdown on
752100	760460	the narrative themes and tropes of Bioshock infinite, um, a game, which as a game, I was
760460	765580	kind of not really super satisfied with, but I thought actually did some interesting things
765580	769540	from a storytelling standpoint, which is not something I normally even think about in terms
769540	771540	of games.
771540	774780	We talked about that for a couple of hours and I was really happy with how it, how it
774780	779260	came out, uh, despite it being unpleasantly long.
779260	781460	Well, you know what?
781460	785380	This show's really unpleasantly long most every week, so it's all good.
785380	792380	Um, and we also, uh, we had a pretty in-depth discussion on, uh, LGBT issues in games, um,
792380	794540	and we're actually going to do a follow up on that this summer.
794540	795920	So I'm very excited.
795920	802380	This is a good part to plug the gamer X panel that is coming up, uh, the gamer X is what
802380	805360	the first weekend in August in San Francisco, right?
805360	808900	And so a bunch of us are all teaming up to do a panel, but the panels are being voted
808900	815620	on right now at gamerconnect.com and our panel is podcast X zone, right?
815620	817700	And it's going to be, and I hope I don't miss anybody.
817700	821780	It's going to be, I'm representing OLR and we're going to, we're hopefully getting some
821780	822980	folks from courthouse too.
822980	827900	And then of course, game buoy podcast, uh, the Koopa club guys out of Chicago are coming
827900	828900	out.
828900	829900	They're going to be there.
829900	832580	And, uh, well game bar I think has representation, right?
832580	834140	Am I leaving anybody out so far?
834140	835500	I think it's those shows.
835540	836540	I think that's it.
836540	840460	Although we are in talks with a couple other other podcasts for representation.
840460	841460	Yes.
841460	844180	So, um, podcast X zone at gamer connects, it's going to be fun.
844180	846740	And I hear they're announcing the guests for gamer con later tonight.
846740	847740	So that's, um, that's exciting.
847740	849940	That's going to be a fun show.
849940	852220	Um, all right.
852220	855980	By the way, before I, before I turn to talk to Tim for a minute, I need to address, um,
855980	859180	some people are talking about my audio tonight that I sound a little different.
859180	864580	So when we were taping live on Bobby Black Wolf, like my usual mic, like died.
864580	868700	So in just a few minutes before we went live tonight, I kind of had to resort to a plan
868700	872380	B. So if I sound a little more distant than usual tonight, I apologize.
872380	875900	Uh, it's just, you know, we had to do a last minute switch or you wouldn't be able to hear
875900	876900	us at all.
876900	878380	We replaced Rob with a pod person.
878380	882460	Well, I guess I sound a little more distant and I can even see like my levels aren't coming
882460	883460	up as usual.
883460	887700	And I just don't have the time, like trying to fix it on the fly and I kind of can't like,
887700	892540	I'll try to make it a little louder, but, um, hopefully it won't sound too terrible
892540	896460	when I listen back to it later because, uh, Shane's messaging me in the chat, like you're
896460	900140	going to hate listening to this later because you sound off.
900140	901660	That's probably accurate.
901660	902980	All right.
902980	905980	Um, anyhow, let's move on.
905980	909540	Uh, Tim, you don't have a podcast.
909540	913300	I don't, I'm sorry to hear that, but you know, you're, you're coming on our show the first
913300	914300	time.
914300	915300	It's a brand new world.
915300	917420	Uh, you work in the games industry.
917420	918420	I do.
918420	919420	Who do you work for?
919420	920420	I work for crystal dynamics.
920420	922540	And what, what would we know out of crystal dynamics?
922540	924820	Uh, we just released a game called Tomb Raider.
924820	926380	Oh, I think I've heard of that.
926380	927380	Yes.
927380	928380	Yeah.
928380	930460	Didn't you guys do that mad cross game that never came out?
930460	932460	No, that was crystal dreams.
932460	933460	Oh yeah.
933460	935420	Do you, do you get that?
935420	937940	Do people get confused with the other companies?
937940	941380	Like I know a telltale and traveler's tales all the time.
941380	943660	I don't think I've ever gotten confusion about who we are.
943660	947300	I think, uh, I've gotten a lot of people who, who wonder who are you and then I'll say something
947300	950740	like Tomb Raider or I'll say legacy of Kane and suddenly like, Oh, are you going to make
950740	951740	a new legacy of Kane?
951740	955140	Um, that's probably the most common question.
955140	956140	Are you?
956140	957140	No comment.
957140	958140	Of course.
958140	959140	Of course.
959140	960140	All right.
960140	963740	No, I, I totally respect that obviously.
963740	969860	Um, uh, but there's, there's that DLC for guardian of light that you could go get it
969860	970860	right now.
970860	971860	Wasn't that enough?
971860	972860	Wasn't that enough?
972860	974460	Uh, what, what do you do?
974460	977900	So when you say you work on a game like Tomb Raider, what, what did you, what did you do?
977900	983140	So I am a software engineer, meaning I programmed the computers that make them do things.
983140	987700	Um, specifically I work in physics and collision and simulation.
987700	993500	So a lot of the stuff that moves based on your rigid body or cloth, uh, that was me.
993500	995500	So when something goes through a wall, we blame you?
995500	996900	Uh, sometimes you can blame me.
996900	997900	Or when the clothes clip.
997900	1000300	When the clothes clip, you can definitely blame me.
1000300	1001300	Okay.
1001540	1002540	That's a good thing.
1002540	1004420	You didn't work on one of the games I played this week.
1004420	1008860	Cause there was that problem all over, not, not Tomb Raider, maybe clear, not Tomb Raider,
1008860	1009860	but something else.
1009860	1013380	I was like, wow, like I could see Tim playing this game and like twitching nervously as
1013380	1014460	he's playing it.
1014460	1016300	That tends to happen.
1016300	1017580	Does that happen when you play other games?
1017580	1020060	I you're like, this is, this is, I would have done this so different.
1020060	1021300	I'm always in that zone.
1021300	1023220	So I always see those things and that's what I'm looking at.
1023220	1025380	I'm looking at the performance of their physics.
1025380	1030100	I'm looking at the performance of all of their simulation stuff and I'm incredibly critical
1030100	1032500	and sensitive to those issues.
1032500	1035140	So specifically, what did you do for Tomb Raider?
1035140	1038100	Was it, was it all that, that you just named like the clothes and some of that?
1038100	1039100	Yeah.
1039100	1040820	All the, uh, you know, a lot of the puzzles are physics based.
1040820	1045260	That was sort of one of the design goals to make it sort of a living realistic world when
1045260	1046260	it's driven by physics.
1046260	1048780	It just feels right to your brain when you see it moving.
1048780	1049780	Well, yeah.
1049780	1052780	And when characters don't move right, people, you know, that's, that's one of the first
1052780	1057620	things games will get razzed for is like, like for instance, captain spike and I always
1057620	1062220	have this great debate about the game ice climber on the NES and I talk about how the
1062220	1063220	game is amazing.
1063220	1064220	There's no debate.
1064220	1065220	What?
1065220	1066220	There's no debate.
1066220	1068340	No, there's totally a debate.
1068340	1072740	And uh, the game is, but the characters jump really weird and it's like you have to get
1072740	1077180	used to the physics in the game before the game makes any, you know, sense.
1077180	1081140	So yeah, when physics are wrong, when especially a character's physics are wrong, you feel
1081140	1084340	it right away and you don't necessarily know what it is, but it just feels wrong to your
1084340	1085820	brain.
1085820	1088060	How long ago does a game like Tomb Raider start?
1088060	1090260	Like how long is the production cycle for a game like Tomb Raider?
1090260	1093260	How long ago did you know you're going to work on Tomb Raider?
1093260	1094260	About five years ago.
1094260	1095260	Oh my God.
1095260	1096260	Yeah.
1096260	1097260	It's been a while.
1097260	1098260	So how long did you have to keep that a secret?
1098260	1099260	Cause they only announced that what?
1099260	1100380	Two, two and a half years ago.
1100380	1103020	I had to keep that a secret for, yeah, probably about three years.
1103020	1104020	Oh my gosh.
1104020	1106020	It was that hard.
1106020	1107900	Um, not really.
1107900	1109900	I'm pretty antisocial.
1109900	1114180	That's the key to NDA.
1114180	1115180	Be a hermit.
1115180	1116180	Exactly.
1116180	1118620	You don't go on podcasts for one.
1118620	1122620	That's a good way to make sure.
1122620	1124020	How did you get into that?
1124020	1126260	Like what, or let me take a step back.
1126260	1129980	What made you say, I want to do physics and video games?
1129980	1133220	Like obviously you must've kind of narrowed your path as you went, but how did, how did
1133220	1134220	you end up where you're at?
1134220	1135620	You know, that's a good question.
1135620	1137500	I've been a science nerd all my life.
1137500	1141500	I've also been a computer nerd and there was this obvious cross section I didn't see at
1141500	1144940	the time, but you know, I went to, I went to undergrad for, for computer science and
1144940	1149540	later I went to grad school and I did some more computer graphics and gaming centric
1149540	1155780	studies and I sort of wanted to bring my science background into that and I found simulation
1155780	1158980	was sort of the perfect world for me to do some research in.
1158980	1161300	How'd you get hooked up with Crystal Dynamics?
1161300	1171220	Um, I had a ex classmate who worked there as an artist and he got me an interview and
1171220	1175060	I just happened to be at the right time that they were looking for someone, you know, straight
1175060	1177860	out of grad school and it was the perfect position for me.
1177860	1178860	So I sort of lucked out.
1178860	1183860	Tell them you know someone who does print material.
1183860	1187020	Stop trying to use this interview as a platform for your own agenda.
1187020	1188020	Um, okay.
1188020	1190260	Going back to Tomb Raider for a minute.
1190260	1193960	So like, you know, obviously a lot of people are playing this game right now.
1193960	1198660	I will re I will respect the situation and not bring up that story that everybody's talking
1198660	1202260	about when it comes to sales and all that, but the game's great.
1202260	1203260	Okay, that's you.
1203260	1208660	That's, you know, I even if you weren't my friend, I truly believe the game is great
1208660	1211500	and I think a lot of people feel the same way.
1211500	1217820	Um, how or when somebody like plays a game like Tomb Raider and you obviously do a lot
1217820	1221860	with the physics and the environments and so forth, what do you think people miss?
1221860	1225300	Like is there is there something that like you pay a special attention to detail to this,
1225300	1228340	but you think people I don't want to say this so that people don't appreciate it, but like
1228540	1231500	maybe it like goes unnoticed this, this work that you do?
1231500	1234980	Well, certainly there's a lot of different types of gamers who play Tomb Raider and you've
1234980	1238740	got the people who run right through the game and of course those people have to play the
1238740	1240340	puzzles, which are based on physics.
1240340	1241860	So that's sort of shoved in their face.
1241860	1242940	They can't miss that.
1242940	1247260	But there's a lot of nice little touches, little environmental effects, little rigid
1247260	1250900	bodies that are around the world to make the, you know, everything come to life.
1250900	1254460	Bits of cloth flapping in the breeze and that stuff, you know, we spend a good amount of
1254500	1258700	time on that to make that look good and natural and it makes the whole environment come alive,
1258700	1262660	but it's not something every gamer is going to sit and look at, they sort of will just
1262660	1263660	run by.
1263660	1268220	And of course there are the explorers who want to go around and explore every nook and
1268220	1269900	cranny and so they're going to see all those little things.
1269900	1272300	They're going to see every detail that's not correct.
1272300	1275500	That sounds like people that play Skyrim is probably a very similar approach.
1275500	1277980	You know, you have some people that are just like, I want to just kill all the villagers
1277980	1278980	and dah, dah, dah.
1278980	1284540	And then, you know, some people are like, I'm going to pick every flower to do, right?
1284540	1288100	Although it's a good thing, Laura Croft can't pick flowers or can she?
1288100	1289100	She can.
1289100	1290100	Oh my God.
1290100	1291100	There are plants to pick.
1291100	1292100	That's right.
1292100	1294420	I guess I'm one of those people who just wants to shoot.
1294420	1299680	Well, I'm having Resident Evil flashbacks, you mix the green herb.
1299680	1303500	And all of those plants that you can run past and then they rustle as you run past them
1303500	1304500	and move.
1304500	1306500	I made those.
1306500	1307940	Nice.
1307940	1311060	So I talked a minute ago about how the game is being well received.
1311060	1316100	Like is that when you go on Metacritic or one of those sites and you see that, you know,
1316100	1318140	overall the reception you're getting is positive.
1318140	1321220	Like is that is that important for somebody like you?
1321220	1325460	Like when you look at reviews and that positive affirmation, is that is that something you're
1325460	1327860	like, oh, I'm so happy to see that.
1327860	1330540	Or are you like, it doesn't really change anything?
1330540	1331860	You know, I'm really proud of the game.
1331860	1337660	I'm really happy with the whole thing and I'm really happy with the stuff that I did.
1337660	1341780	And I like to tell myself, I don't care what the reviews say, but I'll be honest.
1341780	1343780	I love praise.
1343780	1348220	So, I mean, being completely blunt here, it's great.
1348220	1350020	It is great to read those reviews.
1350020	1355020	And it is sad to read the ones that are not super glowing and they really like stick in
1355020	1356020	my craw.
1356020	1357020	But, uh, sure.
1357020	1358020	Sure.
1358020	1361660	It's, you know, it's the same thing when I go look up reviews for the show, like I'll
1361660	1363260	go on iTunes and they'll be five star reviews.
1363260	1366100	I'm like, oh, that person was so awesome to leave that five star review.
1366100	1367100	And that was awesome.
1367540	1370780	And then you go to like a one star review where, you know, it's like everybody's screaming
1370780	1375220	all the time and I'm just like, okay, I'm going to take that.
1375220	1379820	At least no one's told you to shut up and get in the kitchen.
1379820	1380820	Do you remember that one?
1380820	1382060	Did that really happen?
1382060	1384180	Yes, that really happened.
1384180	1385740	What is wrong with people?
1385740	1388540	This was like after our second year.
1388540	1391900	So yeah, I know what you mean.
1391900	1395340	Hey Rob, was that five star review from Mrs. Roberts?
1395340	1401220	No, it was from the other Mr. Roberts.
1401220	1403220	There's something about me you might not know.
1403220	1404740	I was implying that was your mother.
1404740	1406540	It was from Rob Robson.
1406540	1408580	Oh, uh, okay.
1408580	1412180	So everybody in chat is talking about the death scenes and they're like the death scenes,
1412180	1413180	the death scenes.
1413180	1415980	And, and did Tim, did Tim do all this stuff with the death scenes?
1415980	1416980	All right.
1416980	1420820	I, let me, let me ask you about, I think of when I think of Tomb Raider, I think of the
1420820	1422580	Conan O'Brien review.
1422580	1423580	Did you see the Conan O'Brien?
1423580	1424580	I did.
1424820	1426300	Did you all sit around in your office and watch it?
1426300	1427300	Oh yeah.
1427300	1431940	And there's that, there's that part where, you know, they're, they're doing the, the,
1431940	1436180	the tree thing over and over and over and they're playing it up for laughs like, but
1436180	1437580	that's kind of like a serious thing.
1437580	1438580	It is.
1438580	1440580	But did you, did you notice the, the quality of the laughs?
1440580	1442180	They weren't just, Oh, that's hilarious.
1442180	1449180	It was like every time it was first, Oh, then, then laughter like it didn't lose its impact
1449180	1450780	after they played it 10 times.
1450780	1452660	People were still cringing at it.
1452740	1456860	I mean, I've seen that, that hundreds of times and I still cringe when I see it.
1456860	1457860	It's kind of gross.
1457860	1458860	Just saying.
1458860	1459860	Oh yeah.
1459860	1463620	I think I've made my decision on what I'm getting on Steam.
1463620	1465420	I thought you already had the Tomb Raider.
1465420	1470300	No, cause I didn't have the money at the time.
1470300	1474940	You know, there's, there's things in Tomb Raider that are kind of like, I, I, I see
1474940	1475940	it.
1475940	1480340	I don't know if it was intentional, but I see elements of like Metroidvania, like that
1480340	1482980	type of thing that I don't think was really in Tomb Raider before, but I kind of see it
1482980	1483980	in there now.
1483980	1487700	Um, do you, do you draw inspiration from other games for Tomb Raider?
1487700	1491460	Cause I know you don't just play Tomb Raider all day, every day, like, cause clearly you're
1491460	1495220	wearing a Mass Effect hoodie, but I'm also wearing a Tomb Raider t-shirt.
1495220	1496220	Yeah, I know.
1496220	1497220	I know.
1497220	1498220	I know.
1498220	1501780	But, uh, since you don't just play Tomb Raider all day, every day, do you, do you get inspiration
1501780	1502780	from other games?
1502780	1506740	Do you, do you see things in other games that, you know, you, you want to do with Tomb Raider
1506740	1507740	or?
1507740	1508740	I do.
1508860	1511220	I'm not really the one making those decisions.
1511220	1513780	That's the creative and the design team.
1513780	1517620	So while there may be games that I like, and I think, Hey, we should, we should take, you
1517620	1519740	know, take this element from that game because it's awesome.
1519740	1521640	Cause there's something to learn there.
1521640	1524920	It's not going to go ignored, but it's really, it's not really my place.
1524920	1526900	It's not the, it's not the problems I'm trying to solve.
1526900	1531940	And there are far more creative and talented people at Crystal Dynamics solving those problems.
1531940	1532940	But yes, they do.
1532940	1536540	They definitely take inspiration from other games, from other media.
1536540	1541660	We got a lot of inspiration for this reboot from movies like The Descent and Rambo.
1541660	1542660	Oh my God.
1542660	1543660	It wasn't.
1543660	1544660	Okay.
1544660	1546900	So when I reviewed Tomb Raider on the show, I totally compared it to The Descent.
1546900	1548860	And I'm like, it is, it is totally like that movie.
1548860	1553060	We had some like shot for shot scene call-outs to scenes in The Descent.
1553060	1557180	We sat like as a studio back in pre-production, we sat around and we watched that movie.
1557180	1558180	It's so scary.
1558180	1559660	It scared the crap out of me.
1559660	1560660	I will never watch that movie again.
1560660	1561940	I saw that on the big screen.
1561940	1562940	Okay.
1562940	1564620	That movie creeped me out so hard.
1564620	1565620	Oh my gosh.
1565700	1572180	I still like what Alan called the game though, Lara Croft's really bad, no good, terrible,
1572180	1573180	very bad day.
1573180	1574820	Or whatever that book was.
1574820	1580940	No, I think he also just called it Girl.
1580940	1585260	So Girl is the first, the first girl game.
1585260	1589380	No, it's the first Tomb Raider game that has multiplayer, you know?
1589380	1592460	And so multiplayer, you know, I do the other show about Warcraft.
1592460	1594420	We talk about PvE and PvP all the time.
1594420	1595740	PvP is unpredictable.
1595740	1598380	You know, you don't know, you know what computers are going to do.
1598380	1602180	You know what attacks the, the, the, the, the boss monsters and so forth are going to
1602180	1604420	do, but you don't know what other people are going to do.
1604420	1609420	Does the unpredictability of multiplayer cause like different things when you're planning
1609420	1610620	environments and things like that?
1610620	1613620	Do you have to look at it, take a different approach to that or similar?
1613620	1615180	I actually didn't work on multiplayer.
1615180	1616180	What?
1616180	1621100	Multiplayer was, was done by our sister studio up in Montreal, Eidos Montreal.
1621100	1625900	So it was made in a relative vacuum with the single player game.
1625900	1632020	We worked on single player in Redwood City and then in Montreal, they worked on multiplayer.
1632020	1636100	So of course there was a little bit of collaboration to keep things in sync, but I was not part
1636100	1638100	of the active development of that.
1638100	1639100	Interesting.
1639100	1640100	Okay.
1640100	1641100	Have you played the multiplayer?
1641100	1644180	I played a little bit of the multiplayer.
1644180	1651780	I shot some people and then I got killed about 10 times more than I shot people.
1651780	1654180	You also worked on Guardian of Light a few years ago, right?
1654180	1655340	I did for a little while.
1655340	1657260	I tend to bounce around at the studio.
1657260	1658260	That was good.
1658260	1659260	Yeah.
1659260	1660260	I liked Guardian of Light too.
1660260	1661260	Well, Guardian of Light was more like an arcade-y for me.
1661260	1662260	Yes, exactly.
1662260	1663260	I mean, that's not a bad thing.
1663260	1665660	It's just, you know, this was on Xbox Live Arcade.
1665660	1667040	This was supposed to happen, right?
1667040	1671020	So here's the thing though, is that here's what I don't understand about Guardian of
1671020	1674820	Light and I need help, is that, you know, you have the Guardian of Light game and that's
1674820	1677260	Laura, but then there's the reboot Laura.
1677260	1682200	So you've got, is there two Loras now or did this game kind of like, no, Guardian of Light,
1682200	1684900	you know, was like, it's not really about that anymore.
1684900	1686420	It's about like Laura or what?
1686420	1689100	Yeah, this game was a complete reboot.
1689100	1690340	We're going to start over.
1690340	1694340	We're going to create a brand new, you know, a brand new property.
1694340	1696200	We're going to do everything over.
1696200	1699300	So anything that happened beforehand, it all happened in the past.
1699300	1700660	It was a different game.
1700660	1701820	It was a different universe.
1701820	1703420	We want a fresh start.
1703420	1706360	We don't want to be, have any baggage from any other games.
1706360	1710820	So this is the equivalent of Marvel's Ultimate Universe.
1710820	1715420	I can't say I'm an expert in that, but yes, I suppose so.
1715420	1716420	Okay.
1716420	1719740	Except I think it will be less lame than the Ultimate Universe is sometimes.
1719740	1720740	All right.
1720740	1721740	Yeah.
1721740	1724740	Well, I'll stop, I'll stop bugging you about Tomb Raider because I know, you know, when
1724740	1727900	it comes to the day job, there's only so many things you can't, you do and you don't want
1727900	1728900	to say.
1729140	1731100	Let me, let me just turn it over to you for anything general.
1731100	1734260	Like, is there anything you want to tell the listeners about Tomb Raider or, you know,
1734260	1736940	about your work or what have you?
1736940	1741020	I really think you guys should all buy it.
1741020	1742780	Really appreciate that.
1742780	1746420	Actually, I should ask you a couple of the general things I asked him.
1746420	1750020	How did you get into just not, not even this Tomb Raider and programming and all this,
1750020	1752020	how did you get into just games?
1752020	1754060	Why are you like a video gamer?
1754060	1757540	I was a video gamer as far back as I can remember, like really young.
1757540	1761780	We had an Atari 2600 in the house.
1761780	1764500	No one else in my family cares about video games except for me.
1764500	1767500	My dad bought it because he thought it would be a hoot.
1767500	1769700	And then I sort of like, this is mine.
1769700	1772340	I want to, I want to have this all the time.
1772340	1776420	And so I always bugged them to buy me the new systems and I only got a few.
1776420	1777540	I got the NES.
1777540	1781060	They wouldn't buy me a Super Nintendo and that was the worst thing in the world.
1781060	1786940	But like the best thing in the world was to go over to like my cousin's house or certain
1786940	1792580	neighbors who had a Super Nintendo because that was, that was the coolest shit ever.
1792580	1793780	So I was a big computer nerd.
1793780	1794780	I liked to program.
1794780	1799620	When I first taught myself how to program, it was in Q basic and I, the first things
1799620	1805660	I did was try to make games and they were horrible, awful, like they weren't even games.
1805660	1811300	They were just like shapes floating around and weird sounds, but I was trying.
1811300	1815060	And so I sort of knew my calling from a very young age.
1815060	1816260	That's awesome.
1816260	1820340	So that's kind of, you just, you just started, you made your own little games and then it
1820340	1823380	just kept evolving and evolving and now you work in the industry.
1823380	1824380	Exactly.
1824380	1825380	That's awesome.
1825380	1828140	Do you have any advice for people that might be wanting to get into the games industry?
1828140	1830780	Like people listening to this show that are still in school, like, yeah, I kind of want
1830780	1831780	to, I want to work in games.
1831780	1832780	You have any advice?
1832780	1833780	Uh, yeah.
1833780	1835660	Uh, you know, make games.
1835660	1839380	A lot of people who want to go into games will go and say, I'm going to be a programmer
1839380	1841540	so I'm going to go do computer science or something.
1841540	1845060	But when they're done with that program, if they don't have anything to show that's related
1845060	1850180	to games, it's really hard to convince someone who can only hire two or three more engineers
1850180	1853780	that you're worth it compared to the other 20 people who want that job.
1853780	1858260	So as early as possible, start making games.
1858260	1859460	They don't have to be great.
1859460	1860900	You can start modding other games.
1860900	1864780	You can start scripting within packages.
1864780	1867940	You can use free engines like Unity.
1867940	1870340	There's a lot of resources out there.
1870340	1872880	So make as many games as you can.
1872880	1874740	Show people that you're passionate about it.
1874740	1877620	Uh, look at our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
1877620	1881180	Um, ActDeaf says your parents wouldn't buy you a Super Nintendo.
1881180	1882300	Worst parents ever.
1882300	1884700	They are the worst parents ever.
1884700	1885700	Never forgive them for that.
1885700	1886700	That's not nice.
1886700	1892100	I had to save up my own money to buy a Nintendo 64 when that came out.
1892100	1895580	I had to cut a lot of grass.
1895580	1896580	That's awesome.
1896580	1897580	Uh, let's see.
1898100	1901460	BlackWolf says I wrote games in Q Basic 2.
1901460	1905100	Did you ever play the Gorillaz game in Q Basic?
1905100	1906100	That was one of the samples.
1906100	1909460	It was like a game where you just throw bananas at each other.
1909460	1910460	It was great.
1910460	1912100	Did you do Q Basic 2, Loki?
1912100	1913940	I played around with Q Basic.
1913940	1915460	We like, I don't know.
1915460	1923340	I change colors of things and, you know, I also have the strategy of setting the speed
1923340	1927460	of the banana to be super high so that you sort of clip through the buildings.
1927460	1930460	So you throw it and you get stuck in the middle of the building and you just keep throwing
1930460	1932660	it in a straight line to the next person.
1932660	1934740	Ah, the classic tunneling problem.
1934740	1940220	I just remember making the ball bounce on my Texas Instruments computer.
1940220	1942100	That was the extent of anything I've ever programmed.
1942100	1944300	Oh, the games I made on my TI-82.
1944300	1945300	I love that game.
1945300	1946820	See, I couldn't do any of that shit.
1946820	1950760	I just wanted to talk about games with all my friends.
1950760	1951760	I'm with you on this.
1951760	1952760	Right?
1952760	1953760	Look where we ended up.
1953760	1956220	See, now when I get a game, I have to mod it.
1956220	1960780	I had to drop out of my calculus class because that's all I did was play with my TI-82.
1960780	1966980	I was trying to make a Final Fantasy fighting game type thing and I got the engine done,
1966980	1969220	but I mean, the TI-82 sucks.
1969220	1971940	Well Square finally did one years later on the PSP, right?
1971940	1972940	Yeah.
1972940	1976820	There was a guy in my class who sat during the entire class and by the time he was done,
1976820	1980780	I was playing a pole position on his graphing calculator.
1980780	1981780	It was awesome.
1981780	1982780	Awesome.
1982780	1984180	Yeah, that's another good piece of advice, actually.
1984180	1985180	Start small.
1985180	1989740	You laugh at a TI-82, but the constraints there were so tight that it forces you to
1989740	1990740	be creative.
1990740	1995700	I will say, I used to play Commodore 64 all the time when I was younger and would do the
1995700	1999300	basic, but I would start to type in the programs that were in the back of magazines, right?
1999300	2002140	And then try to modify them a little bit to meet my needs.
2002140	2004540	If I changed a color or something, then I'd be like, I'm the shit.
2004540	2005540	I changed the color.
2005540	2006540	You know?
2006540	2007540	So I don't know.
2007540	2008540	This is me.
2008540	2009540	Okay.
2009540	2010540	One more question, then we're going to get into our gaming weeks.
2010540	2015980	But same thing I asked Spike a minute ago, what is like your favorite video game ever?
2015980	2018140	You're not allowed to name something you worked on.
2018140	2019500	Oh, damn it.
2019500	2021940	I'm taking that off the table right now.
2021940	2024260	So what's like your favorite video game ever?
2024260	2026020	You know what I'm really bad at?
2026020	2027020	Coming up with favorites.
2027020	2028020	Yeah?
2028020	2029020	Hmm.
2029020	2034900	Well, I'm wearing a jacket from Mass Effect and I'm a huge sci-fi nerd.
2034900	2036980	Mass Effect is one of my favorite series.
2036980	2038620	So Jamie's like...
2038620	2039620	That's why we're all friends.
2039700	2043020	We're great friends because of that.
2043020	2047820	But and to create a little controversy with Spike, Super Mario Brothers 3.
2047820	2049580	I'm going to say Super Mario Brothers 3.
2049580	2053660	Your opinion is wrong and you should feel bad for having it.
2053660	2054660	Is this like a thing?
2054660	2056140	It's a little bit of a thing.
2056140	2059340	Like Super Mario Brothers 3 versus Super Mario World?
2059340	2060340	Yeah.
2060340	2063980	A little bit comes from a place of bitterness for not owning Super Mario World, but...
2063980	2066420	Oh, so it goes back to that again.
2066420	2073940	Well Captain Spike, what's your problem with Mario 3 then?
2073940	2077940	He didn't know in Super Mario World because the parents wouldn't get him a Super Nintendo.
2077940	2082140	What's your hatred towards Super Mario Brothers 3?
2082140	2085660	If we're being completely honest, it's just me being a hipster.
2085660	2086980	Everyone loves it so I hate it.
2086980	2088940	I'm glad you said it because I was going to say it if you didn't.
2088940	2089940	Yeah, I knew you were.
2089940	2090940	That's why I cut you off.
2090940	2093500	What are your thoughts on Ocarina then?
2093500	2103460	Oh, I am not a fan of Zelda at all except for Majora's Mask and Link's Awakening.
2103460	2106980	Well you know what guys, I think I'm going to help you guys out here with this whole
2106980	2109620	Mario Brothers 3 and Mario World thing.
2109620	2114420	There's really only one way we can solve this and that is to ask the audience, ladies and
2114420	2115420	gentlemen.
2115420	2123180	So I'm going to put up a live poll at live.vognetwork.com right now and the question goes like this.
2123180	2129460	Which is better, Mario 3, Super Mario World, or neither one, jeez.
2129460	2132060	I'm surprised you didn't put Super Metroid on that list.
2132060	2136660	No because this is about the Mario's there.
2136660	2141620	Remember you have to be a registered participant at live.vognetwork.com and you'll see that
2141620	2144540	pop up right there underneath the chat and you can vote in the poll.
2144540	2150180	Which is better, Mario 3, Super Mario World, or neither one, jeez.
2150180	2153300	Either it was Mario is missing.
2153300	2157140	Mario typing?
2157140	2158700	We'll get to the results here momentarily.
2158700	2161860	Looking at the results as they're coming in, of course it's tied.
2161860	2164540	I mean you said that, it switched.
2164540	2166380	Oh Mario World just took the lead.
2166380	2167860	And then there's someone who's like no one.
2167860	2170660	Oh look, it flipped again.
2170660	2172740	Someone did do a no one curve vote.
2172740	2175580	Yeah, oh Mario 3 just pulled way ahead.
2175580	2176580	We'll see.
2176580	2177580	Alright.
2177580	2179140	We'll get to the results for you here momentarily.
2179140	2183780	But first I think, first off thank you Tim, you did great for your first podcast.
2183780	2184980	I learned some stuff.
2184980	2185980	Thank you.
2185980	2186980	Thanks for having me.
2186980	2187980	No problem.
2187980	2188980	Thanks for dealing with me.
2188980	2189980	Please.
2189980	2192220	You'll stay here and comment randomly on other things throughout the show with Captain
2192220	2193220	Spike, right?
2193220	2194220	Yes?
2194220	2195220	Good?
2195220	2196220	Or no, you're out of here.
2196220	2197220	Bye.
2197220	2198220	No, just kidding.
2198220	2199220	Yeah, we're going to take the pizza and go.
2199220	2201500	Alright, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have
2201500	2203400	been playing this week.
2203400	2205220	So Dark Soccer, why don't you start us off?
2205220	2207300	I figured out I'm old.
2207300	2209660	I played DDR last night.
2209660	2212740	I felt like death warmed over after I was done.
2212740	2215260	I can't beat an eight footer anymore, Rob.
2215260	2217780	Wait, I can't do superstar anymore, Rob.
2217780	2223140	Well, I don't think you're going to be able to just do it the first game either, you know?
2223140	2224140	You know what you need?
2224140	2225140	Hmm?
2225140	2226140	She needs a montage.
2226140	2227980	I do not need a freaking montage.
2227980	2230980	It's where you get better in a short amount of time.
2230980	2231980	That is true.
2231980	2232980	Gotta have a montage.
2233660	2238260	I'm actually, though, we're hooking back up the DDR pads in the front room because I have
2238260	2239260	nothing else to do.
2239260	2240860	I'm unemployed.
2240860	2247340	So I also, I guess I can say now that I'm playing it, even though I can't say anything
2247340	2254740	else about it, is I'm playing the beta Final Fantasy 14.
2254740	2259140	Yeah, they did a partial NDA lift on that tonight, which still doesn't make sense to
2259140	2260140	me.
2260300	2264260	You can talk about, what, character creation and Gridania, but you can't talk about anything
2264260	2265260	else.
2265260	2266260	I have a cat girl.
2266260	2267860	And I have a midget.
2267860	2269020	That's it.
2269020	2272140	And Gridania is full of trees.
2272140	2273140	How's that?
2273140	2274140	You think that works?
2274140	2275140	It's lovely.
2275140	2276140	Thank you.
2276140	2277140	So it's Windurst.
2277140	2280460	I don't know why they changed the names of all the characters.
2280460	2282520	I mean, just keep the races the same.
2282520	2283520	Why do you have to change the name?
2283520	2285940	Are they the Mikote is what the cat people are?
2285940	2286940	Yeah.
2287020	2291260	Seriously, Taratar or Lala, whatever the hell is.
2291260	2294860	The first time I saw Lala fell, I misspelled it as falafel.
2294860	2303380	So now I call them the falafel people, but I know I can't really give my opinion of it,
2303380	2312940	but it's, I'd say graphically on par with modern.
2312940	2313940	Which is good.
2313940	2314940	Definitely.
2314940	2316100	It's going to be a PlayStation 3 game.
2316100	2320180	I would say in a term of graphical sense, just in processing, in the processing power
2320180	2322900	required, it's definitely a big step over a while.
2322900	2324620	That I'm sure I can say.
2324620	2330460	So anyway, so I've been playing that, no more until June, I started playing Phantasy Star
2330460	2336140	Online 2, thanks to one of our lovely listeners, Prince Brightstar.
2336140	2340520	And I actually, there was a patch that happened after I started playing.
2340520	2348480	So I basically got through the whole tutorial level and I've made my little red head Newman
2348480	2350060	person chick.
2350060	2354060	And I want an Oppa Oppa mag.
2354060	2355060	I don't care.
2355060	2359800	I worked my ass off to have an Oppa Oppa in the first Phantasy Star Online and god damn
2359800	2365000	it, I'm going to have another Oppa Oppa and I'm going to have a Master System because
2365000	2366000	Sega nerd.
2366000	2370120	Even though I did have a Super Nintendo as a kid, technically it was my brothers, but
2370120	2375640	I did convince my mother to buy it so I could take it over.
2375640	2379600	And we had Rock Band at my birthday party, which I talked about.
2379600	2383440	We left Rock Band out, so I did some, I tried singing alone.
2383440	2388800	I played Minecraft last night trying to get this, someone made the Ocarina of Time map
2388800	2392160	in Minecraft, so I was trying to get it to load and I still can't figure out how to get
2392160	2397240	it to load as its own world, so whatever.
2397240	2404440	And so instead I just went around in my house digging more gopher holes in my house.
2404440	2409400	And god what else did I play, I played something else, oh Drunken Robot Pornography.
2409400	2413160	Which is super awesome, it's like jumping flash on crack, I've been telling everyone
2413160	2415320	about it.
2415320	2419480	And I got the indie pack last night.
2419480	2424720	I've only installed, well it's not really an indie pack because it does have Back to
2424720	2431880	the Future, all five parts of the Back to the Future series from Telltale, and right
2431880	2437680	now the minimum pay on it is like five bucks, but if you pay eight, then when the extra
2437680	2441400	content comes out then you get all that, and you get like, there's another one that's like
2441400	2445800	cargo something, it looked interesting, it was a neat game.
2445800	2452160	So I've downloaded a few games, there's that Dungeon Quest or something, it's like a puzzle
2452160	2453160	game.
2453160	2455160	But it's sort of a side scrolling combat puzzle game.
2455160	2456160	Oh the Dungeon Hearts.
2456160	2457160	Yeah Dungeon Hearts, that's it.
2457160	2459840	Shane just did a review of that, it just went up on VoG today.
2459840	2463960	Yeah it was part of the deal, so I mean I spent like eight bucks and got some good games
2463960	2468760	and got a really neat chiptune soundtrack that came with it.
2468760	2474720	And I didn't play any of them yet, I just installed a few of them because I have been
2474720	2477160	working on projects.
2477160	2479920	And that's my gaming week.
2479920	2480920	Before we go to Loki.
2480920	2484040	One last thing, Dan's been playing Grid 2.
2484040	2485040	The racing game?
2485040	2486720	Yes, with his three monitor setup.
2486720	2488760	He's such a man.
2488760	2489760	So manly dudely.
2489760	2496600	I put 15 seconds of him playing it on my tumblr, just to show off what his setup looks like,
2496600	2499280	so that's it.
2499280	2500440	Awesome.
2500440	2503560	Going to the results of our live poll before I go to Loki.
2503560	2509720	The results of the live poll, which is better, the winner with 54.17% of the vote, Mario
2509720	2510720	3.
2510720	2512920	Hells yeah.
2512920	2514920	Captain Spike, sorry about it.
2514920	2517440	I'm going home.
2517440	2521480	You taking your ball and going home?
2521480	2523920	Alright so Mario 3 is the winner there.
2523920	2527400	But there was a couple votes for neither one, jeez.
2527400	2532960	But at least it didn't win like the Nintendo question we asked last week.
2532960	2535440	Alright Loki, how was your gaming week?
2535440	2538920	I bought stuff too, I bought the Grand Theft Auto collection.
2538920	2545280	Okay so, what the hell, seriously Rockstar Games, during the weekend it's supposed to
2545280	2548160	be the Steam sale, okay, it's on sale during the weekend.
2548160	2552080	And then today they're like, guess what, we're pulling fucking double sale, we're marking
2552080	2553080	down again.
2553080	2556520	I'm like, fuck you, I just bought that shit yesterday for twice the price.
2556520	2560680	I mean it was 25 bucks for all the Grand Theft Auto games, but now it's 12 bucks for all
2560680	2561680	the Grand Theft Auto games.
2561680	2564560	So you should seriously buy that if you haven't bought it yet.
2564560	2569240	So I picked that up, and then also the indie bundle as well, haven't really installed anything
2569240	2573400	other than Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
2573400	2575240	Still haven't played that though.
2575240	2579240	Been playing Saints Row the Third on PC, just trying to 100% everything.
2579240	2583080	Technically according to the game I am 100% right now, because I have all the unlockables
2583080	2584080	and stuff.
2584080	2590360	But I need to do all the Saints book stuff, which is really boring from what I remember
2590360	2591360	the last time.
2591360	2595120	It took me off so much that I lost my save on my 360 because I had all that pretty much
2595120	2599200	done except for one carjacking, or one car theft mission.
2599200	2603800	So I have to do it all over again.
2603800	2607120	I played a little bit of Surgeon Simulator 2013.
2607120	2610800	Oh we were talking about that last week, that video was hilarious that you were showing
2610800	2611800	us.
2611800	2612800	That game is fucking hilarious.
2612800	2613800	It's just awesome.
2613800	2614800	DM got grossed out.
2614800	2618960	I just don't know, I still haven't figured out how to do the heart surgery, I had to
2618960	2620160	go watch it on YouTube or something.
2620160	2624200	I managed to, it was kind of gross but funny at the same time.
2624200	2627240	So I was like, okay, I'm going to take out all the ribs, because that's the only way
2627240	2629160	I can get to the heart and get these organs out of here.
2629160	2630400	So I took out all the ribs.
2630400	2633840	The lung was still stuck though, so I had to jiggle it back and forth, and it made a
2633840	2635880	squishy sound as you were doing it.
2635880	2639320	You know, trying to get the lungs out.
2639320	2645160	So then I got the lung out, and it kind of flung out, so it landed on the floor or something.
2645160	2649400	And then I got the other lung out, and I did the same thing with, I don't know, something
2649440	2653000	that was in the bottom, I think it was the liver or something, I can't really tell.
2653000	2655280	Organ three, I don't know.
2655280	2660360	Still can't figure out how to get the heart out though, because the stomach and the esophagus
2660360	2666640	are still in there, and I can't figure out how to cut it or rip it out.
2666640	2668600	So I don't know, I still can't pass that.
2668600	2672640	So I just threw the heart in there and the alarm clock, and I assumed that it was a no.
2672640	2673640	Try pickaxe.
2673640	2674640	Pickaxe?
2674640	2679080	I tried the axe, I tried the saw, all I did was kill him.
2679080	2681640	So I don't know.
2681640	2688120	I saw someone trying to do that one, and there was a stint that you could insert in, but
2688120	2690800	this is the one that Dan and I were watching, and we just got through the whole part where
2690800	2693360	the guy's messing with his desk and trying to put the floppy.
2693360	2694360	Oh, that was hard.
2694360	2696880	Yeah, I finally got one of the floppies in there, and I'm like, oh, this is it?
2696880	2700760	I was like, just swallow some pills, you've got diazepines, so swallow some pills and
2700760	2701760	calm yourself.
2701760	2705000	Okay, Dungeon Buster's talking about this game in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com
2705000	2707040	saying the kidney transplant video was hilarious.
2707040	2710040	The guy tossed the patient's colon out of the back of the ambulance.
2710040	2713920	What is wrong with this game?
2713920	2717200	Best game ever, or best game ever.
2717200	2720160	Don't make me go to a live poll.
2720160	2723240	It's pretty awesome, I mean, it is pretty awesome.
2723240	2728280	But so yeah, I played a bunch of that, and then actually something I'm gonna try to bring
2728280	2732800	back that I tried this week, very short notice so no one joined, it's fine, because I still
2732800	2734160	had fun playing it.
2734160	2736480	I had a birthday dinner I had to go to.
2736520	2740360	It's cool, no worries, seriously, it was very short notice, I decided, hey, let's bring
2740360	2741800	back VoG game night.
2741800	2747480	So that's what I'm gonna start doing, Thursdays, 8 to 10-ish, you know, pick a game.
2747480	2749280	It doesn't matter, whatever, you can live stream something, I don't care.
2749280	2751720	I already promised Mass Effect 3 playthroughs on Thursday.
2751720	2752720	Well that's fine.
2752720	2754880	Well why don't you play Mass Effect 3 with the VoG losers?
2754880	2757160	Oh fuck no, I'm not playing Mass Effect 3.
2757160	2761120	No, VoG game night will never be Mass Effect 3, I'm sorry, unless I'm out one night and
2761120	2762120	then you can host it.
2762120	2766440	At any game convention, there's multiple games to pick from, so I'm sure it'll be fine.
2766440	2771520	So this coming week, I'm gonna do a repeat of Minecraft XBLA, which is fine, because
2771520	2776360	I haven't actually played that in a while, so I played that for like two or three hours
2776360	2777880	and it was fun.
2777880	2782600	I miss that, because even with Minecraft, because we're playing creative right now on
2782600	2788520	the server that we have up, the VoG server, but survival's kind of fun, I mean, for a
2788520	2793760	while, and then you want to start getting creative with it and cheating and stuff, but
2793760	2797400	for now, I mean, it was a lot of fun, so it was kind of fun to kind of play something
2797400	2801360	different than just creative mode, and I forgot that you have to eat.
2801360	2808040	I'm like, oh shit, that's right, you have to do that now, so it was kind of fun.
2808040	2812000	So I played that, and god, what else?
2812000	2814080	I know there's gotta be some other shit I played.
2814080	2817840	Oh, you know, Call of Duty, actually I've been playing Call of Duty Marvel Warfare 3
2817840	2822760	through the campaign, because I've been running out of people to play multiplayer with, we're
2822760	2828000	trying to get more people in, so played a little bit of multiplayer, but played a lot
2828000	2834760	of the campaign, and it's okay, it's kind of comparable, and then I think I played Defiance
2834760	2836600	one of these nights, which is, it's still fun.
2836600	2837600	Good.
2837600	2838600	Did you watch the show?
2838600	2839600	Are you watching the show too?
2839600	2842880	No, I'm not watching the show, it's a sci-fi show, come on, I know where the bar is set
2842880	2843880	on that, okay?
2843880	2844880	How rude!
2844880	2846440	Isn't he rude right now?
2846440	2847440	Rude?
2847440	2851000	I'm sorry, sci-fi, purveyors of such wonderful films as Sharktopus.
2851000	2853560	Oh, oh, oh, you meant sci-fi the network.
2853560	2859520	No, sci-fi the network, no, I'm not doggin' sci-fi, like, the genre, I'm saying sci-fi
2859520	2860520	the TV network.
2860520	2863400	Alright, well that's acceptable.
2863400	2864400	That's fine.
2864400	2866400	I mean, I just...
2866400	2867400	Man-skeeto.
2867400	2875440	I'm sorry, I'm sure it's good, but it's just, I'm not into the world, I mean, if it was
2875440	2878120	like a Borderlands game, it'd be even better, but I just don't...
2878120	2880120	You're not excited about Sharknado?
2881120	2883680	That is, like, who's in Sharknado?
2883680	2886520	It's like, legit a thing.
2886520	2887520	It's a real thing, yeah.
2887520	2891280	Megashark versus Giant Octopus, starring the wonderful Deborah Nielson.
2891280	2895120	No, here's something that it's kind of, I am kind of interested in seeing, or at least
2895120	2901600	seeing the riff tracks of, is they have a Birdemic sequel coming out, Birdemic 2.
2901600	2902840	That warranted a sequel?
2902840	2907600	Yeah, the guy thought it was good, and so he made another movie, like, he seriously
2907600	2908600	thinks it's good.
2908600	2912120	I think what he thinks is, hey, I make a really shitty movie and I make a ton of money
2912120	2913120	from it.
2913120	2914120	Done.
2914120	2917600	I'm gonna spend another 10,000 in five days.
2917600	2918600	Rob found it, Sharknado.
2918600	2924640	Sharknado will have Ian Ziering from Beverly Hills 90210, and Tara Reid is the star of
2924640	2925640	Sharknado.
2925640	2926640	Is she gonna be the shark?
2926640	2927640	I am here for that.
2927640	2928800	Wait, when does this come on?
2928800	2934080	I don't know, what day is, oh, um, I'm trying to look at IMDB'd if you go.
2934080	2938280	So what exactly is a Sharknado, is that like a tornado with sharks in it, or?
2938280	2944820	I, I, Tigerclaw, help me out, I need- Good idea, bad idea.
2944820	2950560	By the way, Rob, we do have to bring back your post-Hoard House multiplayer stream.
2950560	2954000	Oh yeah, I like, I like doing the live streaming for World War 1.
2954000	2957720	Where I turn into a very potty mouthed person.
2957720	2959520	What they need is just do land sharks.
2959520	2964160	Land sharks, and have like, you know- But it has to have, knock on the door and
2964160	2965160	go cannygram.
2965160	2969360	Alright, in the interest of time, I gotta derail this and get us back on track.
2969360	2971640	That's it, yeah, that was it.
2971640	2973920	So yeah, this week, Minecraft again.
2973920	2974920	So Minecraft XBLA.
2974920	2979000	I'll put up, there's gonna be a thread on the forums, hopefully we can put up like a
2979000	2981920	calendar or something like that so we can plan ahead with what's up, and also let me
2981920	2983480	know what games you want to play.
2983480	2986800	Not Mass Effect 3.
2986800	2988960	I will try to make this quick.
2988960	2994600	I had fun, we went to Golf Land, Spike, Tim and I yesterday, and, well not that there
2994600	2999220	was that much to play there, but I did play some DDR and I about died after one set of
2999220	3004680	songs because, you know, just being 34 now and trying to get up on the machine and just
3004680	3007840	jumping into a set of songs.
3007840	3012480	But come on, I don't have the stamina I had when I was 24 because I haven't been playing
3012480	3014960	DDR every day like I used to then.
3014960	3019200	So you know, and I don't work out or anything like that, so it's a little difficult to just
3019200	3021440	get up there and do it.
3021440	3023760	But it was fun.
3023760	3027200	There's a lot about DDR I really miss, so I just wanted to kind of throw that out there
3027200	3029280	for the long time Bimani fans.
3029280	3033520	There's one thing I forgot to say by the way, because I was at the arcade at John's Incredibly
3033520	3036240	Crappy Pizza, they had a doodle jump arcade game.
3036240	3038800	Yeah, they had that at RVGL too, I was surprised.
3038800	3039800	Yeah, so anyway.
3039800	3042640	They also have one for Fruit Ninja, but I think we've talked about that before.
3042640	3043640	As you were.
3043640	3044640	Alright, yeah, yeah.
3044640	3049960	Okay, so as far as console games go, we were playing a lot of fun stuff last night.
3049960	3053440	We were trying to find four player games on Xbox Live, so I think we touched, what, Perfect
3053440	3058560	Dark, Doom, Age of Swing, which somebody commented on Facebook, why are you playing
3058560	3059560	that?
3059560	3060560	I'm like, it's four players!
3060560	3061560	Shut up.
3061560	3065480	And You Don't Know Jack, which is probably the best out of the four player games.
3065480	3068160	This random ass Tetris game I had that wasn't bad either.
3068160	3069920	The THQ published one, yeah.
3069920	3071200	Yeah, it wasn't bad.
3071200	3074760	Tetris Evolution, it's years old, but not bad.
3074760	3079920	Okay, but as far as new games go, there was one new game I played, and I wrote a review
3079920	3084720	of this that you can read at vognetwork.com, and the game is Dead Island Riptide.
3084720	3086880	And I gave it a D plus on the site.
3086880	3091680	I didn't, there was a lot about it I didn't really care for, but I want to acknowledge
3091680	3096840	that I realize there's a lot of people that already know, like, Dead Island Riptide, I
3096840	3098200	am totally here for this.
3098200	3103800	Like, I want to dismember zombies in many creative ways, I want to make these new weapons,
3103800	3108400	I want the lols that come from, you know, the zombie murder fest, and, you know, kind
3108400	3112880	of like a B movie game, like Sharknado the game, basically, right?
3112880	3116120	So there's people that are totally going to be into that, and I can respect that.
3116120	3119360	And you know, this game is really for that crowd.
3119360	3125240	But for me, I found it to have a lot of technical challenges, like for instances, zombies that,
3125240	3128660	you know, I would be facing one direction, and I'd suddenly turn, and suddenly when the
3128660	3132220	zombies in my field of vision, it just, it was starting to get up, and it would just
3132220	3136500	fall down, and then get back up again, like, just this weird stuff that would happen.
3136500	3137500	Well, just kidding.
3137500	3144740	And then these shadow effects that were kind of not good, and some other, it's all environmental
3144740	3145740	too, Tim.
3145740	3149900	Yeah, I mean, the five minutes I saw of it, I wasn't, you know, super impressed.
3149900	3153860	So yeah, from a technical standpoint, I wasn't that satisfied.
3153860	3160300	I found it to be a bit repetitive, but you know, if you like the first game, this is
3160300	3165260	more of the same, which for fans of the first game, I'm sure is not going to be a bad thing.
3165260	3168380	So I kind of think you already know where you stand on Dead Island Riptide.
3168380	3170340	I'm not going to tell you.
3170340	3173380	Go check it out if you're on the bubble.
3173380	3175500	No.
3175500	3176660	Get a rental, maybe.
3176660	3180700	A rental with friends on a night you're all going to drink.
3180700	3184820	Great idea for Dead Island Riptide.
3184820	3185820	I guess that's it.
3185820	3186820	That's really all I want to say about games.
3186820	3189120	I want to hear about Spike and Tim and their gaming week.
3189120	3192760	So Captain Spike, what's a gaming week look like for you?
3192760	3195800	Mostly just Monster Hunter Ultimate.
3195800	3198200	I couldn't stand the demo of that game.
3198200	3199200	What's up?
3199200	3200200	The demo is awful.
3200200	3205480	Okay, so what am I missing by not, well, for one, I hate it when companies put out horrible
3205480	3207640	demos and it's been a trend recently.
3207640	3212040	Ni No Kuni, terrible demo, great game.
3212040	3213040	What else?
3213040	3214040	There was another one not that long ago.
3214040	3215040	It was really bad too.
3215040	3220880	It was Monster Hunter that I didn't know anything about Monster Hunter and I played this demo
3220880	3226040	and I'm like, nope, delete, but you are really into this.
3226040	3227040	What am I missing?
3227040	3230200	Well, you know, it's largely a skill-based game.
3230200	3235480	There is some advancement through gearing and what have you, but largely the whole point
3235480	3241040	of the game is sort of learning the mechanics, learning how the enemy behaviors interact
3241040	3244600	with their timing windows for when they're vulnerable to attack.
3244600	3245640	I really like it.
3245640	3250360	I think it's a very cerebral take on the action game, but the demo is awful.
3250360	3252400	It doesn't communicate what's expected of you at all.
3252400	3256640	It just gives you some big weapons, some toned down monsters and just says, oh, hack them
3256640	3263120	until they're dead, which, you know, cool, but I'm not really here for that.
3263120	3265280	But for the full game, I actually find it very compelling.
3265280	3268520	I've put in something like 120 hours already.
3268520	3269520	Wow.
3269520	3270520	That's commitment.
3270520	3271520	Yeah.
3271520	3272520	I'm the kind of guy I usually pick up games.
3272520	3277560	I'll buy a $50 game, play a couple of hours and never touch it again, which is an awful
3277560	3278560	thing.
3278560	3279560	I don't think that's cool.
3279560	3280560	You and me both, buddy.
3280560	3283280	That's why I felt comfortable saying that to you.
3283280	3285400	It's called Gamer ADD.
3285400	3287880	You know, oh, I'm going to check out some Dead Island Riptide.
3287880	3288880	Oh, shiny.
3288880	3289880	Yep.
3289880	3290880	Yep.
3290880	3291880	Oh, shit.
3291880	3292880	Steam's Tale.
3292880	3293880	Download, download, download.
3293880	3294880	Yeah.
3294880	3295880	Yeah.
3295880	3300720	But that and, you know, all of the gaming that you just mentioned that we did last night,
3300720	3307360	and I've been playing Super Mario World on Wii U and Mega Man 4 on my 3DS.
3307360	3309560	Good times.
3309560	3311440	You're a big fan of the Mega Man series, right?
3311440	3312440	Huge fan.
3312440	3313440	Yeah?
3313440	3314440	Yeah.
3314440	3315440	Okay.
3315440	3318440	So which one's your favorite out of all the games?
3318440	3320800	I'm giving you an expected look.
3320800	3321800	The number series.
3321800	3323360	I'm actually, I'm going to go with three.
3323360	3324360	Okay.
3324360	3325360	That's one of the two correct answers.
3325360	3326360	I can forgive you.
3326360	3327480	I do love two.
3327480	3333080	The problem is I've played it so many times that it's less of, oh, I'm enjoying doing
3333080	3336440	this, and more of like, oh, hey, watch me get through this stage without using Flash
3336440	3337440	Man's ability.
3337440	3338440	Yeah.
3338440	3341360	So you're talking about a Quick Man's level then?
3341360	3342360	Exactly.
3342360	3343360	Okay.
3343360	3344600	What's your favorite of the X?
3344600	3345600	The first one.
3345600	3347200	I don't even have to think about that.
3347200	3348400	I replay it every year.
3348400	3351480	I gave that to Rob recently.
3351480	3356440	Ross Seal UT in chat is also a fan of Monster Hunter 3 saying, excuse me, Monster Hunter
3356440	3360760	3 Ultimate, saying I'm over 70 hours into MH3U so far.
3360760	3361760	It's a fine game.
3361760	3364480	You just have to look at the manual and the home menu.
3364480	3366120	That is something that needs to be pointed out.
3366120	3371040	All the Wii U games I've gotten so far have manuals in the home menu, not a physical manual.
3371040	3372840	So read that manual.
3372840	3373840	Yeah.
3373840	3374840	That's definitely a good idea.
3374840	3379380	For some reason, for 3 Ultimate, they removed like the tutorials that used to be in-game
3379380	3381660	in the other iterations of Monster Hunter.
3381660	3385340	I don't really know why they did that, but it makes the manual even more important.
3385340	3386340	Interesting.
3386340	3388100	Yeah, it was funny.
3388100	3391380	Last night we were playing Tetris and I couldn't figure out like why our multiplayer mode was
3391380	3394380	not doing the line increase thing that you expect to see.
3394380	3396380	I was like, wait a minute, this game's from 2006.
3396380	3397380	It still has a manual.
3397380	3399380	Let me go find it.
3399380	3403340	Not, oh, let me get out my iPad and log on.
3403340	3405380	So Tim, what's a week in gaming look like for you?
3405380	3406380	How was your gaming week?
3406380	3407380	Hmm.
3407380	3410660	Well, I've been playing a lot of Picross 3D on my DS.
3410660	3412660	It's all casual.
3412660	3413660	I love it.
3413660	3417500	It's just a fun thing to do if I have five or ten minutes to, you know, right before
3417500	3422340	bed or I was playing it on the couch before the show started.
3422340	3427100	I played a little bit of Mass Effect 3 on Insanity because everything else is boring
3427100	3430220	and slow now compared to that.
3430220	3436380	And as Spike mentioned earlier, I played some Super Mario World, the inferior game to Super
3436380	3439220	Mario Brothers 3 judging you.
3439220	3447020	We played until I died about 15 times in a row to Matcha Koopa and quit in a fit of rage.
3447020	3450900	So yeah, I do that if I get too frustrated with something.
3450900	3451900	So does Rob.
3451900	3453180	I've done this.
3453180	3454240	This legitimately happened.
3454240	3459460	We were playing Ice Climber, but the part he leaves out is that he lost all his lives.
3459460	3463780	So I was just playing by myself and then I got frustrated and I said, you know what,
3463780	3464780	I'm done.
3464780	3465780	I got ten minutes.
3465780	3466780	They'll show.
3466780	3467780	Out.
3467780	3471420	And I haven't put as many hours into it as Spike has, but I've been playing Monster Hunter
3471420	3472420	as well.
3472420	3477940	I am new to the Monster Hunter series, so I came at it from a brand new perspective.
3477940	3483340	It's pretty daunting to just sort of plop you in the game.
3483340	3488540	And there's a lot about the game that I find really, really annoying in terms of the interface,
3488540	3494980	the tiny text, just the really clunky nature of getting quests and it all feels really
3494980	3496220	artificial.
3496220	3501780	But that all being said, I totally understand why the game works for people.
3501780	3505860	Like it really did in some way sink its teeth into me and I wanted to get that next set
3505860	3506860	of armor.
3506860	3508600	I wanted to kill that next monster.
3508600	3512620	So I did have a lot of fun with it, despite the frustrations.
3512620	3518100	I feel like I'm missing out on this game that everybody's into and I just couldn't get into
3518100	3519100	it.
3519100	3521380	I had a friend in Japan be one of the campers.
3521380	3522380	Oh, really?
3522380	3523380	Yeah.
3523380	3524380	Oh, wow.
3524380	3526540	Camped out for, I think, three different Monster Hunter games.
3526540	3527580	Oh my gosh.
3527580	3528700	Having a manual probably helped.
3528700	3530820	I didn't look at the manual.
3530820	3532820	Spike was my manual.
3532820	3536460	And even then with somebody who knows what they're talking about, it's still hard.
3536460	3540060	That's a really steep learning curve to just jump into it.
3540060	3543780	ActDeft in our chat room asking, Captain Spike, you a King of Fighters fan?
3543780	3547540	I'm not sure if that came from an earlier conversation or what, but are you a King of
3547540	3548540	Fighters fan?
3548540	3549780	I am.
3549780	3551900	Someone had mentioned KOF in the chat.
3551900	3553900	Oh, that's where that came from.
3553900	3554900	Yeah.
3554900	3555900	Got it.
3555900	3558580	Is there a particular one in the series that you prefer or...
3558580	3563060	Well, I've been collecting the cartridges for my Neo Geo, so basically all the ones
3563060	3564060	I have already.
3564060	3565060	Okay.
3565060	3566900	Next time you come in town, bring them.
3566900	3568900	I have a Neo Geo.
3568900	3569900	Okay.
3569900	3572300	Actually, the last game I bought was KOF 2000.
3572300	3573300	Excellent.
3573300	3574300	Yeah.
3574300	3577420	I loved that Neo Geo back for you from Tokyo.
3578300	3579300	That was awful.
3579300	3580300	Thank you, though.
3580300	3581820	There was one that came out that was awful, though.
3581820	3582820	What was that KOF...
3582820	3583820	Was it 12?
3583820	3584820	It wasn't...
3584820	3585820	I mean, yeah.
3585820	3586820	It was basically unfinished.
3586820	3587820	Yeah.
3587820	3588820	My Shiranui wasn't even in it.
3588820	3590060	How do you do that?
3590060	3591060	It was awful.
3591060	3599340	And it was the one where both Kyo and Iori were powered down.
3599340	3600340	It was not a good one.
3600340	3601340	All right.
3601340	3606180	Well, if that's gonna do it for our gaming weeks, then let's get into some actual gaming
3606180	3607180	news.
3607220	3608220	Let's get into the show.
3608220	3609220	That's all right.
3609220	3610220	We've had some good chat so far.
3610220	3611220	I'm just gonna quickly say housekeeping.
3611220	3614260	Don't forget to follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R.
3614260	3618380	We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
3618380	3620780	We talked about the GamerX panel.
3620780	3621900	Did we get the link in our chat room?
3621900	3622900	I don't think we did yet.
3622900	3623900	Slidekick did for us, though.
3623900	3624900	Slidekick did.
3624900	3625900	Thank you very much.
3625900	3629980	Because all your upvotes, we need them to make that panel happen.
3629980	3631780	So please check that out.
3631780	3633580	And plan on coming out and saying hi.
3633580	3634580	All right.
3634580	3636900	Let's get into some gaming news for the week.
3636900	3639980	And I think Loki's gonna start us off tonight.
3639980	3641340	What's going on in the gaming world?
3641340	3647500	So Microsoft's gonna finally say something about the next Xbox system on May 21st.
3647500	3651620	Was really supposed to happen, I guess, this month, and now it's May.
3651620	3657820	So May 21st, 1 p.m. Eastern, 10 a.m. Pacific, or 6 p.m. UK.
3657820	3660700	And that's all we know.
3660700	3664260	Except there's rumors.
3664260	3667740	A source.
3667740	3670140	Told Polygon some few things.
3670140	3671140	I love sources.
3671140	3672140	It's always a source.
3672140	3673140	Always a source.
3673140	3674140	Yeah, right.
3674140	3675140	All right.
3675140	3676140	Why not?
3676140	3680620	For shits and giggles, let's dissect this shit, too.
3680620	3681620	Come on.
3681620	3682620	Let's do it.
3682620	3686540	So there's some details that they're apparently talking about.
3686540	3691860	First off, you know, saying that yes, system will be always online.
3691860	3695820	However, it's not as bad as it sounds.
3695820	3700940	And you know, basically saying that also the system will be able to capture video and will
3700940	3705260	do so similar to a DVR and you'll be able to pick highlights and stuff that sounds very
3705260	3710300	similar to the PlayStation 4 and what they were talking about there.
3710300	3713740	And you'll be able to share those on the web.
3713740	3720940	And then also that it's gonna, the online only part of it, it is gonna have basically
3720940	3727900	kind of a check for your games, but they're gonna leave it up to the publishers to decide
3727900	3732700	whether the games are gonna be requiring a constant internet connection or not.
3732700	3733700	Oh, gee.
3733700	3739700	Yes, leave it in the hands of them.
3739700	3744840	That to me sounds like that the publishers will be handling servers and stuff.
3744840	3750220	So if live goes down, you can't play that game.
3750220	3754180	If their server goes down, you can't play that game.
3754180	3755180	Your internet goes down.
3755180	3756180	You can't play that game.
3756180	3757180	I don't know.
3757180	3758180	It sounds lame.
3758180	3759180	Yeah.
3759180	3761660	I mean, again, this is the same rumor that's been going.
3761660	3765520	Now it's just, it's a new spin on the same rumor and it's kind of like, I'm kind of sick
3765520	3772940	about theorizing on this one because I think also with so much fallout from that guy on
3772940	3776620	Twitter and the fact that, you know, we thought we were going to hear about this in April
3776620	3781460	and now it's May, it kind of makes me think a lot of this shit's still up in the air.
3781460	3786620	So I'm not sure we can really thumb down any of this online stuff yet.
3786620	3787620	Exactly.
3787620	3791020	And they say one of the other things that's gonna change is the way achievements are working.
3791020	3796380	They're saying they're gonna basically kind of remove the cap, I guess, for achievements
3796380	3797380	or anything.
3797380	3801460	It'd make it even easier for publishers and developers to add achievements later on.
3801460	3805740	Like say they want you to notice a certain thing or focus on a certain part of a level
3805740	3806740	or something they can.
3806740	3808900	Or download the DLC and make it the more achievements.
3808900	3811900	Well, they do that anyways, but yeah.
3811900	3818100	And then also they're saying that the friends list size is gonna increase.
3818100	3819100	Oh, finally.
3819100	3821340	The cap is going to be removed.
3821340	3822340	Finally.
3822340	3823340	It's about time.
3823340	3827540	That was supposed to happen several years ago when they shut off Halo 2, yes, I remember
3827540	3828540	that.
3828540	3829540	Yeah.
3829540	3834420	So apparently that's now going to happen somehow.
3834420	3839900	That one I believe, for what it's worth, I believe that one.
3839900	3846180	That seems legit, yes.
3846180	3851940	So yeah, I mean, I'm not even gonna bother debating this stuff to death because we've
3851940	3852940	done it already.
3852940	3859020	And I guarantee you with it, what, four weeks away, five weeks away from this reveal, we're
3859020	3863420	probably gonna have another fucking rumor article every goddamn week leading up to it.
3863420	3864420	Of course.
3864420	3868580	Because everybody wants to get those rumors out there because, God forbid, when actually
3868580	3873140	the information comes out and they're wrong, they'll say, well, the details changed.
3873140	3874140	We got shit.
3874140	3875140	We got you that news.
3875140	3876180	No shit, they changed.
3876180	3877180	They always do.
3877180	3881980	I was having a friendly debate on Twitter earlier this week with another podcaster.
3881980	3883820	Do you think they know the name?
3883820	3887420	I still don't think they know the name.
3887420	3888420	Xbox something.
3888420	3889420	Yeah.
3889420	3893380	I think it's gonna be an Xbox something.
3893380	3897420	My reasoning for that is that a lot of times they go back, I think with PlayStation, that's
3897420	3898420	another thing.
3898420	3902660	I mean, that's kind of, yeah, I think they're gonna call it PlayStation 4, it's a safe bet.
3902660	3907980	But in the case of Nintendo, they didn't pick Wii U until really close to that press conference.
3907980	3912340	And you might remember at E3, that signage, none of the signage said Wii U. Besides that
3912340	3915700	logo at their press conference, it all was new Nintendo console, da da da.
3915700	3920020	So this Xbox, they may still be, I mean, Hey, you gotta have a new name for this console.
3920020	3921860	You gotta go out in like two seconds here.
3921860	3922860	I don't know.
3922860	3923860	How about Chuck?
3923860	3924860	Is that what you're gonna do with it?
3924860	3925860	Wii U.
3925860	3927860	I'm just chucking in the trash.
3927860	3928860	Stop.
3928860	3936300	Have you already, you've made up your mind on the next Xbox without having seen the official
3936300	3937300	word?
3937300	3938300	No, I was just being a smart ass.
3938300	3939300	Oh, okay.
3939300	3940300	That's fair enough.
3940300	3946660	Um, I knew if I put this out there already before, if it's, if it's got a sort of like
3946660	3950980	online only, even if it's for DRM, which I don't like the idea of that.
3951020	3955140	You know, if it's going to prevent me from playing any of my games at all, if I'm not
3955140	3959180	connected to the internet, I'm not buying the console because I'm not connected to the
3959180	3963940	internet all the time at work where I play a lot of my games.
3963940	3965440	So it doesn't benefit me.
3965440	3970160	I don't have no, I don't have a need to do that when I can pick up another console or
3970160	3971940	keep the console I have and have no problems with it.
3971940	3972940	I just thought of a good name.
3972940	3973940	Hmm.
3973940	3974940	The ex tesseract.
3974940	3980680	Um, I, and I'm going to say what I said before on this whole thing too, is that, you know,
3980680	3984940	what's the trade off because we know what PlayStation four is bringing to the table.
3984940	3986300	We know it will play use games.
3986300	3988800	We know it doesn't require that ping and all this stuff.
3988800	3992200	And you know, the stuff they were showing in the press conference, why am I going to
3992200	3996540	opt for X box, whatever's more strict system?
3996540	3999620	What's the benefit, what's going to be the trade off.
3999620	4003480	And the other thing too, is if these are the only way they could get away with something
4003480	4007420	like that is if both them and PlayStation were doing it.
4007420	4011240	And then, then, you know, theoretically, if you're going to say, Oh, I have to buy, I
4011240	4016320	have to, I'm being held at gunpoint to buy a new system, you know, then I guess I'll
4016320	4017960	buy a Wii U or something.
4017960	4020280	And until it's like, ah, yay.
4020280	4024540	But no, I mean, seriously, I don't know.
4024540	4025540	I don't know.
4025540	4030520	They have this, honestly, I don't think we'll hear anything about whether it's online only
4030520	4031520	or whatever.
4031520	4032520	Cause they just won't talk about it.
4032520	4033520	Of course.
4033520	4034520	Yeah.
4034520	4035520	I mean, they're not going to say, Hey, there's DRM on this.
4035620	4037500	We're going to have to read between the lines on that.
4037500	4042540	It depends if they take questions from the press or not, which I kind of think the executives
4042540	4046220	will have to, they'll have to address it, but I think they'll, they'll have to talk
4046220	4047220	to investors.
4047220	4050020	I think there's going to be investors that want to know based on everything that happened
4050020	4051580	on Twitter.
4051580	4056100	So anyhow, uh, let's talk about things that you really can do on Xbox right now.
4056100	4057640	This is a reality right now.
4057640	4062620	It's the new pizza hut app available on the Xbox three 60.
4062620	4064620	Captain Spike, did you just perk up over there?
4064720	4065720	Yeah.
4065720	4070720	Well you just gave me a reason to turn on my Xbox for the first time in like a month.
4070720	4074520	Uh, well you can actually order pizza online from your three 60.
4074520	4078880	I haven't done this yet, but uh, what I love about it is that it's got that same cross
4078880	4084960	bar aesthetic that everything else on Xbox has, you know what I mean?
4084960	4088680	Like even if they have connect functionality, I bet it does.
4088680	4094200	Like I just, let me, let me just use my hand to wave over to the extra bacon toppings.
4094780	4096980	I wish it had like the stuff that Japanese pizzas do.
4096980	4098660	Like I want mayonnaise on my pizza.
4098660	4099660	You never know.
4099660	4100660	You never know.
4100660	4101660	Same one.
4101660	4105380	Remember the, uh, the old anti piracy ads from like five or 10 years ago, you wouldn't
4105380	4111560	down, you wouldn't download a pizza slash pizza.
4111560	4112560	Now you can.
4112560	4113560	Exactly.
4113560	4115560	It's a reality.
4115560	4116560	Awesome.
4116560	4123020	Uh, so yeah, you can order online, uh, through the app and I guess, I guess you, I haven't
4123040	4126240	done this yet, but I'm assuming it's probably not much different than ordering online.
4126240	4128200	I have ordered a pizza online.
4128200	4129520	You know, I think a lot of us have done that.
4129520	4131960	I imagine it's really not that much different than that.
4131960	4134040	Um, so why not?
4134040	4138640	And I like this quote from Larry Erb, uh, in an interview with Polygon.
4138640	4139880	He's major Nelson, of course.
4139880	4143440	Uh, we're always looking at ways to give our audience more of what they're interested in.
4143440	4145800	If you look at our audience, they love pizza.
4145800	4148260	I mean, who doesn't?
4148260	4152400	It has international appeal and Pizza Hut is a recognized brand that matches up well
4152420	4157300	with the Xbox brand, you know, right back there with the Mountain Dew and the Doritos
4157300	4158300	all sitting on the table.
4158300	4160460	I feel like that's a backhanded compliment.
4160460	4162660	I really want a Cheetos app now.
4162660	4165580	Hey, you got two Cheetos games.
4165580	4166580	Okay.
4166580	4167580	That's enough.
4167580	4168580	Or Doritos.
4168580	4169900	Dash of Destruction.
4169900	4170900	Come on.
4170900	4171900	Where were you?
4171900	4172900	All right.
4172900	4176660	So yeah, uh, you can order a pizza through your Xbox now, but honestly I like, I know
4176660	4181660	a lot of people are giggling, cackling, but technically, couldn't you fire up Internet
4181660	4183240	Explorer on your Xbox?
4183240	4186280	Go to pizza.com and you could have already done this.
4186280	4187280	It's just funny.
4187280	4188280	They made an actual app for it.
4188280	4193440	Does Pizza Hut.com have any sort of flash or HTML5 because it won't fucking work on
4193440	4194440	Internet Explorer.
4194440	4195440	Perhaps.
4195440	4201200	For the record, as we've been talking about in chat, there will be ways to download your
4201200	4204320	food because they've already got biological printers.
4204320	4206480	What's to say they're not going to have food printers at week?
4206480	4209280	It's it's the, um, the, what is it from Star Trek?
4209280	4210280	Replicators.
4210280	4211280	The replicator.
4211420	4213020	Stop the whirl over to get off.
4213020	4214020	And you can.
4214020	4215020	This is amazing.
4215020	4216020	You like food.
4216020	4218580	What is that supposed to mean?
4218580	4221260	I'm about to read my story and then go get more pizza.
4221260	4224620	Hey, I can print delicious non-down loaded pizza.
4224620	4229020	Hey, I can print stuff on paper with biological stuff right now.
4229020	4230020	I only print one color.
4230020	4232540	You don't need to know what you do at home.
4232540	4239220	I thought the FBI went after people that tried to do this biological stuff.
4239220	4240380	Anyhow.
4240380	4244000	I want a replicator so I can go T L gray hot.
4244000	4246800	Even though I really hate Earl gray tea.
4246800	4249960	I would like to tell you dungeon buster that Ron, the Romulan ale that you used to buy
4249960	4253960	at the Star Trek experience was lame.
4253960	4254960	Just get a warp core breach.
4254960	4256480	You won't feel your feet.
4256480	4258080	Okay.
4258080	4259080	More news.
4259080	4260080	Dark Sire.
4260080	4261080	Yeah.
4261080	4262080	Yeah.
4262080	4263080	So Nintendo, while you read this, I'm going to go get tea.
4263080	4265080	Hey Rob, get me some pizza too, please.
4265080	4266080	Thank you.
4266080	4267080	Hearts.
4267080	4269520	Do I look like your bitch?
4269540	4271540	I just want to get served.
4271540	4273540	Oh, you're about to get served.
4273540	4275540	You're about to get served.
4275540	4276540	Hearts.
4276540	4277540	Love you.
4277540	4278540	Mean it.
4278540	4279540	Okay.
4279540	4284420	Anyway, so, um, Nintendo is skipping E3 press conference.
4284420	4288820	They're going to be doing small conferences with direct material and they're trying a
4288820	4293940	new presentation style who they're, uh, so that they're focusing on the software lineup
4293940	4299720	for the US market and going to be doing closed events for American distributors and, uh,
4299720	4303420	another closed hands on event for the gaming media.
4303420	4312440	So yeah, they're like, E3, no, also, um, from the last Nintendo direct, they were, uh, putting
4312440	4318120	out release dates for a Wii U and a Nintendo 3DS games with the Yoshi Island and the Mario
4318120	4322820	Party and the Legend of Zelda linked to the past sequel, which I totally want.
4322820	4328840	Uh, but they're, uh, just trying to do it in smaller groups, let it out so that everybody
4328840	4331780	can be disappointed in increments.
4331780	4335740	I just, they did this last year with their, they had the press conference and then they
4335740	4341780	have three Nintendo directs and it just such a waste of time.
4341780	4344460	It was just so, it wasn't like there's a ton of information.
4344460	4349000	It's just they drug it on for so long.
4349000	4351000	It's like, okay, here, we're going to talk about 3DS.
4351000	4355440	Oh, and this one's about the Wii U, oh, and this one's about the 3DS games that are for
4355440	4356440	older kids.
4356440	4359080	And this one's about our press conference.
4359080	4366220	It's like, uh, yeah, well, it says that they're actually trying to be, um, I guess a little
4366220	4371760	more direct with how they're giving the information, but, uh, I don't know.
4371760	4374040	It just sort of does seem like kind of a snub at the whole E3.
4374620	4379580	And especially since Rob said earlier, the, the feel of E3 has changed.
4379580	4385460	It doesn't seem quite like the big information source that it used to be is turned into a,
4385460	4386460	look at our ads.
4386460	4390380	Look at the big circle thing that EA has in their booth every year.
4390380	4394440	You know, it's more about the flash and less about the information.
4394440	4396900	I think they just don't have anything new to show.
4396900	4400940	Um, I mean, it's not, you don't think Nintendo has anything new to show?
4400940	4401940	Yes, I do.
4401940	4404280	This is a make or break year for Nintendo.
4404280	4405280	Yeah.
4405280	4406280	For as far as that we use.
4406280	4409720	And how well have they done so far in the first third of the year?
4409720	4411320	Oh, fantastic.
4411320	4415040	I think they're really edging on the break side of Nintendo.
4415040	4420120	We could go three years ago on this very show and replace the word Wii U with 3DS and it
4420120	4421360	would be the same conversation.
4421360	4422360	Yeah.
4422360	4428540	And it took them a year to, to pull it around and a price drop almost immediately.
4428540	4431080	And who's to say that's not going to happen again?
4431080	4433740	I don't think it's going to happen again.
4433740	4435180	Here's why I don't think it's going to happen again.
4435180	4439400	It's because their 3DS is doing well and they're making plenty of profit from that.
4439400	4442780	So they don't really give a shit right now that the Wii U is not doing well.
4442780	4447580	I kind of get like, this was one of those articles, I read it, it was all over Twitter
4447580	4449260	and I was like, wow, that's really weird.
4449260	4451260	And then I go, well, you know, that makes a lot of sense.
4451260	4455300	Like people really just, you know, they've dumped on those Nintendo press conferences.
4455300	4460100	And I think that the element of the game of press conferences and so forth has changed.
4460120	4462240	They don't have a new console to show.
4462240	4463960	They only want to show games.
4463960	4467840	And you, you said it yourself a minute ago, people don't want to sit through all this
4467840	4469820	other crap that they don't care about.
4469820	4472480	Give me the information targeted at me.
4472480	4473480	Thank you very much.
4473480	4474480	Good night.
4474480	4475480	But they don't do that with the Nintendo Directs.
4475480	4478960	They, I think they drag on, I don't know, whatever.
4478960	4483080	I would rather just see press release links to trailers done.
4483080	4487400	I don't need to hear you about your fucking crap about, you know, the 25 year anniversary
4487400	4488400	of Luigi.
4488460	4492660	Especially when you go on about it long, long, long time and you're like, oh, by the way,
4492660	4497140	we won't actually have any really new games for Luigi other than the already announced,
4497140	4502460	you know, Luigi's Mansion game for 3DS, but we have DLC for a Mario game.
4502460	4503460	Sweet.
4503460	4505460	That's sort of Luigi.
4505460	4508520	That's like almost like a new game, but not.
4508520	4512260	See we understand online because we put out DLC.
4512260	4513260	We're hip.
4513260	4514260	We're cool.
4514260	4515260	We're just like those other consoles.
4515260	4516260	Love us.
4516260	4521280	So that's, I just don't think that they have anything new to show because look at it.
4521280	4522280	Okay.
4522280	4526280	The stuff that they're talking about releasing first quarter of this year hasn't come out
4526280	4527280	yet.
4527280	4530680	We're talking like third quarter when that stuff's finally hitting the market.
4530680	4536980	So really the only new thing, if you call it new, is going to be the HD remake of Windwaker
4536980	4540840	and maybe one more game, but that's it.
4540840	4542080	They don't really have much to announce.
4542080	4546780	Are they really going to talk about Pikmin again or Wii Fit U again or, you know, they
4546780	4551380	have 3DS games, which if, you know, they have a ton of 3DS games coming out, so no worries
4551380	4552380	there.
4552380	4555340	But as far as the Wii U goes, they don't really have anything to show.
4555340	4559340	Spike, I want to come to you with this because I know you've been following this stuff a
4559340	4562340	very long time as well and probably are going to say something about it on your own show.
4562340	4564340	What, do you think Loki's on the right track?
4564340	4571280	Well, I mean, you know, we, we know that they have a Mario universe as we're all expecting
4571280	4575780	it to be called and Kart 8, they've already said those are going to be playable on the
4575780	4582100	floor at E3 and, you know, they said they're going to show the new Smash Brothers game
4582100	4585360	in video and picture form.
4585360	4589060	So they have some things to show, but I don't think they have a great deal to show.
4589060	4594060	I think this is probably a good choice for them to do sort of a scaled down presentation.
4594060	4600500	I kind of have to agree after the flop-tasticness of the last couple of E3 conferences.
4600500	4605000	You know, and again, I appreciated at last year's E3, for example, that Nintendo took
4605000	4610120	a lot of time to talk about game mechanics and game design of Nintendo land of all things,
4610120	4613560	but still at least they were talking about game design rather than boobs and explosions,
4613560	4614560	I guess.
4614560	4621560	They did talk about boobs and explosions, I think they'd sell more consoles.
4621560	4623040	Sad commentary on games.
4623040	4624620	That sounds like my house.
4624620	4627160	You do know it has Bayonetta 2, right?
4627160	4628160	Eventually.
4628160	4629160	No, seriously.
4629160	4632580	I mean, that's the problem with Nintendo is they fucking, they talk of big game, like
4632580	4634720	how we're going to target the core audience.
4634720	4639580	We're going to target those older, you know, people that want to play games, you know,
4639580	4640580	on the Wii U and stuff.
4640580	4643780	And it's fucking child game, child game, child game, child game, Mario.
4643780	4650460	I mean, Mario sells it's, you know, for everybody, I guess, but there are no real, I don't think
4650460	4651460	they take it seriously.
4651460	4655220	They just kind of, you know, this time around they say, okay, listen, we're not going to
4655220	4658360	put on a lot of games right now, first quarter, because we're going to let third parties kind
4658360	4660000	of shine, I guess.
4660000	4665480	And then, wow, that, that, that, you know, amazing Spider-Man game from last year really
4665480	4670480	shown on your console and, oh, Need for Speed Most Wanted that came out back in the fall.
4670480	4675300	Woo, that, that's awesome now coming out in March, you know, it's the definitive version
4675300	4676300	now because it's...
4676300	4680840	Well, you know, Nintendo couldn't expect that Ubisoft was going to be like, LOL, bye bitch.
4680980	4686640	I still think that, uh, they're making a big mistake making Bayonetta 2 a Wii U exclusive.
4686640	4688760	Sega is.
4688760	4691060	I think they're going to lose on it.
4691060	4693180	I wouldn't exist without Nintendo though.
4693180	4695300	Yeah, Nintendo's the one that brought it back.
4695300	4698580	Same time Sega has done, taken a lot of risks on the Wii, I mean, look at, they put out
4698580	4702300	Mad World and stuff and Mad World is a pretty awesome game, but it's also an awesome game
4702300	4703700	didn't sell very well.
4703700	4708860	And also the Conduit was another Sega game that they put out, I think that was Sega.
4708860	4710540	I think that was Sega.
4711520	4715320	But, once again, another game that didn't sell well at all.
4715320	4720720	I just want to clarify, I don't think Sega's involved in Bayonetta 2, right?
4720720	4724760	But they own the IP, they are part of the licensing for the game to exist.
4724760	4730120	But Nintendo's bankrolling it, Platinum's been very open about the fact that without
4730120	4732800	Nintendo's involvement this game just wouldn't exist.
4734800	4737400	There you go, Bayonetta and Smash Brothers.
4738380	4739580	It's enough for me.
4739580	4745700	But I think that, as much as I love Bayonetta, it's not enough for me to go out and get a
4745700	4749820	Wii U because honestly the Wii U just does not bring that much new to the table, oh yeah,
4749820	4751980	we have a tablet, yay.
4751980	4758900	But if they put out Bayonetta 2 on multi-systems, hell yeah, I would buy it.
4758900	4763900	I'm just saying there's a lot of people who would have been into it.
4763900	4765940	I think it's going to be a repeat of the 3DS.
4765960	4768320	I think it's going to be fine come holidays.
4768320	4771880	Maybe I'll be wrong, but I think it's going to be just fine during the holidays.
4774360	4775720	I hope so.
4775720	4779720	I mean, I don't want to see them fail, but at the same time, it's been a console that
4779720	4782340	there's no reason for me to buy that system.
4782340	4784080	There's nothing that really wowed me about it.
4784080	4788240	The 3DS is like, oh hey, 3D games set without glasses, that's kind of cool.
4788240	4791280	Playing on the second screen, I don't really give a shit about that.
4791280	4793880	It's like, it's not that big a deal to me.
4793900	4800100	The one game I was excited about apparently sucks, so tank, tank, tank.
4800100	4804500	We've been playing on two screens for how long now with the DS, so that's not really
4804500	4805500	a new thing.
4805500	4811740	I think the big difference between the 3DS and the Wii U in terms of positioning is that
4811740	4817300	the 3DS sort of owns handheld right now, at least in the US.
4817300	4819740	There's the PSP, but that's it.
4819740	4827240	It's the PSP, I'm sorry, the Vita, but who owns the Vita, and the 3DS.
4827240	4833000	But the Wii U is coming online a year before a very crowded console market is launching
4833000	4839440	a brand new generation of consoles, and it doesn't seem to be in the same league hardware-wise
4839440	4843160	as the others, which is going to make multi-platform development difficult.
4843160	4847840	And also when we consider, though, that they're saying that now a lot of the market's kind
4847840	4851960	of going to the handhelds and phones and tablets and that kind of thing, and so if
4851960	4855900	you own the handheld market, who gives a crap if your console's not really doing that well
4855900	4862180	because those people probably have a 3DS and they're fine, or, you know, they can buy a
4862180	4863180	3DS.
4863180	4866160	All right, in the interest of time, and I feel like we've had this conversation before,
4866160	4868160	let's move on with the stories.
4868160	4876240	All right, so let's see, let's talk a little bit about more Wii U stuff.
4876240	4878160	As we've said, it hasn't been doing that well.
4878160	4885720	In fact, they have missed their target, which was just about three and a half million units,
4885720	4891160	and they missed it by 500,000, if I remember correctly.
4891160	4896720	They are targeting, though, for the next fiscal year, nine million units, so they're really
4896720	4901080	going to have to pick up the pace if that's going to happen.
4901080	4907680	I want to say that they've only sold, I think it was like 390,000 units just over the last
4907680	4916760	few months, and I think the first three months were 390,000 units, if I remember correctly.
4916760	4924080	And of course, 3DS is doing, you know, is rocking, they're up to 31.09 million units,
4924080	4931200	and the Wii's still getting close to 100 million, 99.84 million.
4931200	4933400	That's a lot of systems.
4933400	4938520	That's got to disappoint them that they've only been able to sell three point, almost
4938520	4943880	three and a half million when there's 99 million Wii owners out there.
4943880	4946640	That's no penetration.
4946640	4956000	And on top of that, Satoru Iwata, he is now the CEO, or the Nintendo of America CEO.
4956000	4960040	And just to be clear, Reggie Fils-Aime was not overthrown or anything like that, he's
4960040	4962960	still there.
4962960	4966720	I'm assuming this is more to kind of try to bring the two together, so that the two don't
4966720	4971240	operate in different silos, that's my thought, is a corporate move like this, but...
4971240	4976580	Well, Iwata's been definitely more upfront, you know, he's been kind of the figure in
4976620	4980180	all those Nintendo Directs and stuff, so...
4980180	4981780	It just wouldn't be the same without Reggie.
4981780	4983820	Well, he's still there, you know, he's not...
4983820	4986900	And his jaw.
4986900	4989900	Let me quickly cover this, this was already referenced a little bit ago, and I think a
4989900	4993260	lot of you guys kind of knew this already, Captain Spike mentioned a little bit ago,
4993260	4998680	Nintendo was, said before, Mario 3D, Mario Kart Wii U, they're going to be at the E3
4998680	5003200	show this year, but kind of the news in this is that there was a press release this week
5003200	5007640	from Nintendo of America and Nintendo Europe that said these games are slated in the next
5007640	5012240	few months, so you could infer that Mario 3D and Mario Kart Wii U, these are not titles
5012240	5017080	to be shown for 2014, these are titles to be shown for the holiday release.
5017080	5019920	Running down the list real quick, just so we're clear, these are games that Nintendo
5019920	5024840	says in the next few months, Mario Kart for Wii U, Super Mario Brothers for Wii U, Wii
5024840	5028600	Fit for Wii U, which has kind of fallen off the radar, but that's kind of one of those
5028600	5031560	games, they were pitching that in the beginning, and it disappeared, so it's kind of another
5031560	5036440	one of those games that, you know, oh, now you see it, now you don't, but Wii Fit could
5036440	5039560	be interesting, depending on what they do with it, that could be an interesting game
5039560	5047120	changer, Pikmin, which we knew, that's happening, Legend of Zelda, Wii U and Nintendo 3DS, and
5047120	5054280	I'm assuming that's Wind Waker, and Link to the Past, and Mario and Luigi on the 3DS,
5054280	5059680	and Pokemon X and Y obviously, so that's, you're pretty much looking at Nintendo's holiday
5059680	5063400	lineup right there. I mean, there might be one or two other surprises here, but that's,
5063400	5068720	you know, that's in a nutshell. That better not be another new Super Mario Brothers game.
5068720	5072280	Well like, oh no, I think it's gonna be a Wii, like you were saying a minute ago, kind
5072280	5076800	of like a Galaxy type thing. Well, they had said that they intended last year to stick
5076800	5081680	to doing the, you know, sort of one new title per generation, and just expanding those with
5081680	5087800	DLC like we're seeing with the Luigi DLC. I just hope it's not another new Super Mario
5087920	5094080	Brothers game. Or anything that resembles that. I think because, I think the Luigi DLC should
5094080	5097800	tell you it's not another Super Mario games, because why would they waste all the effort
5097800	5103120	to do that, to just turn around literally four months later and say, and now it's a
5103120	5109080	new game! I just, I don't see that happening. Because? It's gonna be a 3D Mario, whether
5109080	5115160	it's Universe, whether it's Mario 64-esque, or Sunshine for fuck's sake, it's gonna be
5115160	5122160	something in that vein. Sunshine, lol. I could see them doing it though. I mean, just, why
5123080	5128040	not a new Luigi game then? Because we can do DLC and just easily just shoehorn it into
5128040	5132460	the. Maybe that's why they keep hyping this Luigi, maybe the new game is Super Luigi Galaxy
5132460	5136040	or something, like maybe that's the twist. And no one will buy it. This whole fucking
5136040	5139040	thing. No one will buy it. This whole thing has, what do you mean no one will buy Super
5139040	5143560	Luigi Galaxy? Okay, one person will buy it, but no one else will buy it. Are you smoking
5143760	5148880	because Mario Galaxy was like one of the best games they put out on the Wii, period. If
5148880	5155400	they are, if, I'm not talking about just re-skinned with Luigi, I'm talking about a new game in
5155400	5160720	that universe and everything, but Luigi happens to be the star because it's the year of Luigi,
5160720	5164760	and that's the joke. That's why you haven't seen anything else, because the bombshell's
5164760	5169280	gonna get dropped at E3. No one should make jokes when your system's suffering like that.
5169280	5171280	This is not time for joking, this is time for kicking ass.
5175280	5177280	Ah, I'm done. Dark Sakura, save me.
5177280	5178280	Are you spent, Rob?
5178280	5179280	I'm spent.
5179280	5181280	I found the contest that I'm gonna be in now.
5181280	5182280	Oh?
5182280	5188280	Well, you found it for me, but I'm gonna do it. Because Rob does all my hard work for me.
5188280	5191280	Okay, then as your agent, I want 20%.
5191280	5194280	As my agent, I'll just keep buying you coffee.
5194280	5195280	That works.
5195280	5202280	Speaking of which, so Sega has a thing now where they're wanting people to design a new
5202280	5210280	character for it to be the face of the company. You know, not Sonic, just a new mascot. And
5210280	5217280	the contest is open through June 9th this year, and it has to be an original character
5217280	5225280	and there's a link on, I can get the link later, but it's also not just limited to the
5225280	5232280	Japanese audience, it's worldwide, which I'm gonna get the hell out of this. So basically,
5232280	5240280	they're gonna be doing a new live web series called Sega Raw on a Nico Nico, but that's
5240280	5248280	what the mascot's for, it's for the show. So, I'm not giving you guys my ideas. No.
5248280	5255280	But they want something unique, something fun, something that's gonna, you know, basically
5255280	5261280	fit what they're trying to do. Because the show is, I'm trying to find something in,
5261280	5267280	basically it's just gonna be more of a fan show. And there's translations for the rules
5267280	5273280	up, so you just need a Nico Nico account, and there is an English version on the website
5273280	5282280	to sign up for that. And so I will, let me get the URL, if you go to, it's actually S-E-I-G-A
5282280	5289280	dot Nico video, N-I-C-O video dot J-P, there should be a link from there, and I will post
5289280	5294280	the link in the chatroom for people here. Because maybe Sega will hire me.
5294280	5298280	Got a great idea for a Sega character. It's like Sonic the Hedgehog, but he's black,
5298280	5301280	and he's got guns. Oh, shut up.
5301280	5308280	Well, uh, I wouldn't give out too many of these ideas, because coming up in part B of
5308280	5313280	Orange Lawn's radio tonight, we are going to do a list list. I can't participate, Rob.
5313280	5316280	Why not? Because I'm not giving anybody my ideas.
5316280	5320280	Tough shit. Oh, and he's gonna be named Shadow. Shadow the Hedgehog.
5320280	5327280	Here's the deal, the topic for tonight's list list, mascot we most want to gift to Sega
5327280	5332280	on behalf of O-L-R. So mascot we most want to gift to Sega on behalf of O-L-R.
5332280	5335280	Don't send your answers yet, just think about it, we'll come back to this in part B.
5335280	5338280	By the way, a little bit more to this, is if you want to find those translated rules,
5338280	5341280	look for Yakuza Fan at NeoGaf.
5343280	5347280	Alright. Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
5347280	5350280	Do we gotta? Mm-hmm. Okay. We gotta.
5350280	5355280	Girl. Well, this week, there's Deadly Premonition, the director's cut on PlayStation 3,
5355280	5364280	and Soul Sacrifice on the Vita. Also, on PC, Xbox Live Arcade, and the PlayStation Network,
5364280	5368280	Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon. That's really the only game you need to buy.
5372280	5374280	Thank you for that review. Alright.
5374280	5376280	Oh, I wasn't laughing at that.
5376280	5381280	Oh, what were you laughing at? Oh, because everybody's shouting out their answers in chat right now.
5381280	5386280	Wait, guys, wait. Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some releases that are coming out in Japan.
5386280	5393280	I gotta be honest, I'm sizing up the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360. I don't really see anything for Japan this week.
5393280	5399280	I'm guessing it's kind of a slower period over there right now, but I don't see any releases till May 16th.
5400280	5409280	Trying to look quickly at Vita or the handhelds? Is it just a dry spell this week? Wii U? Question mark?
5409280	5415280	No, I'm showing it's a dry spell in Japan this week. You know why? Why?
5415280	5418280	It's because they're afraid. You know what they're afraid of?
5418280	5423280	Three brand new fucking trailers for Grand Theft Auto 5 on the 30th. That's right.
5423280	5427280	That's all you need to do that day. It's my wedding anniversary, and I'm going out and eating lunch,
5427280	5432280	but I'm coming back and I'm fucking watching those trailers over and over and over again.
5432280	5437280	Didn't we get you a shirt that said game over? Are you gonna make Nelly watch them with you?
5437280	5441280	Should I? Yes, I should. Does she get into it? No. No? She could care less.
5441280	5445280	I would think she'd think it's hilarious. You know what? We need to pick the most violent game,
5445280	5449280	violent bloody gory game ever and have Nelly and your mom review it.
5449280	5453280	My wife wouldn't like it, not because it's bloody, but because it's a game.
5454280	5456280	That would be the best review ever.
5456280	5460280	I'm not positive, but I believe that in Japan, Tomb Raider comes out this week? The Japanese version?
5460280	5463280	It was last week. It was on my list last week, yes.
5463280	5466280	I can't have President Cat. Nice try though with the plug.
5466280	5469280	Yeah, I try. In case my bosses are listening.
5469280	5474280	By the way, I was trying to explain President Cat to somebody the other day, and I was like,
5474280	5478280	but it's not really President. It's more of a delinquent in charge.
5478280	5483280	I found a game coming out on May 9th. That's the closest game release. That's like two weeks.
5483280	5490280	It's on the PSP. Cud Wafter, converted edition, comes out on the PSP.
5490280	5495280	And the box art is just a girl, and she's sitting at the table with her elbows on the table.
5495280	5498280	She's just waiting, like the rest of us for Japanese release dates.
5498280	5502280	That's like 90% of all PSP games in Japan.
5502280	5505280	A chick with her arms folded, waiting.
5506280	5508280	Can you say the name of that again?
5508280	5514280	K-U-D-W-A-F-T-E-R. To me it's Cud Wafter, but it's probably Cud Wafter.
5514280	5515280	It's German.
5515280	5518280	Oh, that almost sounded dirty.
5518280	5522280	Everything in German sounds dirty. You can say strudel and it sounds dirty.
5522280	5527280	Cud Wafer. It's about crackers that cows chew on.
5527280	5531280	Then let's go to the Old Kingdom and see what's coming out over there.
5531280	5534280	I would like to go find out personally, but unfortunately I'm poor.
5534280	5538280	So, God, I'm not even ready, Rob. What's up with me?
5538280	5540280	Amy, I thought you didn't come to the show prepared.
5540280	5544280	Girl! Hold on. Oh, no wonder, because you linked me the wrong month.
5546280	5547280	They're your links!
5547280	5549280	I blame you! I blame you for everything.
5552280	5555280	Oh, Slidekick looked up what this is.
5555280	5557280	Cud Wafter or whatever.
5557280	5560280	It's a Japanese adult visual novel developed by Key.
5560280	5563280	Released on June 25th, 2010 for Windows PC.
5563280	5565280	So I guess it's the PSP version.
5565280	5567280	And the cover sounded like what?
5567280	5571280	Oh, yeah. When I first looked at that I was like, oh, she's gonna get naked.
5573280	5574280	Oh, it's a moe game.
5574280	5576280	She looks too young.
5576280	5579280	That button on her head is like huge.
5579280	5582280	I was just thinking, does she smell like kudzu? No.
5583280	5586280	And fifth dream in our chat room says, Cunt Waiter.
5588280	5590280	I've had a few of those.
5592280	5594280	I worked for one of those.
5595280	5596280	You win.
5596280	5597280	Alright, moving on.
5597280	5601280	On May 1st, we have Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon.
5601280	5602280	I was still thinking about getting it.
5602280	5605280	Injustice Gods Among Us. Game is fucking weird.
5605280	5609280	Soul Sacrifice on Vita and Fez on PC.
5609280	5611280	Now I'm thinking of The Doctor.
5612280	5614280	Cause he wears a fez. Fezzes are cool.
5614280	5616280	You're dying to comment on something, Kevin Spike.
5616280	5618280	Oh, say it.
5618280	5620280	No, no, um.
5620280	5622280	Cunt Waiter.
5622280	5624280	Injustice is actually really good. That's all.
5624280	5628280	I didn't, I just thought that Wonder Woman's hair looked weird.
5628280	5631280	So you're gonna hate an entire fucking game because the hair was wrong?
5631280	5632280	You know.
5632280	5634280	It's DC. I hate everything.
5634280	5638280	You know, Jaime, there are, there is DLC that could probably fix that.
5638280	5640280	I mean, I'm sure she's got numerous outfits.
5640280	5643280	Well, they could, you know, DLC to make her Jean Grey.
5643280	5644280	No.
5644280	5645280	Then she would be awesome.
5645280	5648280	Okay, okay, I will stop and say this.
5648280	5650280	I love Wonder Woman and I like Batman.
5650280	5654280	Although, I cannot read anything Batman related that Gail Simone doesn't write.
5654280	5656280	She is my hero.
5656280	5660280	But I did read Blackest Night with the whole Star Sapphire thing and that was pretty hot.
5660280	5662280	There.
5662280	5664280	My one nod to DC.
5668280	5669280	That's it.
5669280	5671280	Alright.
5671280	5672280	So.
5672280	5673280	Movies.
5673280	5675280	Sony likes movies, right?
5675280	5677280	So Sony said, hey.
5677280	5680280	Why don't we take some of our franchises and make them into movies?
5680280	5682280	Sound like a fantastic idea?
5682280	5684280	Well, it is.
5684280	5685280	According to them.
5685280	5687280	Ratchet and Clank.
5687280	5690280	Coming to theaters in 2015.
5690280	5695280	And it's actually being done by animation company Rainmaker Entertainment.
5695280	5699280	And I guess the digital media studio Blockade Entertainment.
5699280	5701280	And I guess they produced.
5701280	5703280	CG was a flick.
5703280	5704280	Escape from Planet Earth.
5704280	5706280	I have no idea what the fuck that is.
5706280	5707280	But they made that movie.
5707280	5708280	So.
5708280	5711280	They've made a movie before.
5711280	5715280	And then Heavenly Sword is going to be coming to.
5715280	5716280	Becoming a movie as well.
5716280	5720280	Except it's direct to video because you know obviously a game this important.
5720280	5722280	That never had a sequel.
5722280	5725280	Cannot be going to the theaters because no one would know what the fuck it is.
5725280	5727280	And so direct the.
5727280	5729280	Video it goes.
5730280	5732280	Also being done by Blockade Entertainment.
5734280	5736280	What are you laughing at over there?
5736280	5737280	Kudwafter.
5737280	5738280	Stop it.
5739280	5742280	That's like Pee Wee Herman's secret word.
5743280	5745280	Today's word is Kudwafter.
5749280	5750280	Oh boy.
5750280	5751280	I don't know.
5751280	5752280	Heavenly Sword.
5752280	5753280	It just.
5755280	5756280	I guess.
5756280	5759280	Because God of War would have been too good.
5759280	5761280	I don't really know why.
5761280	5764280	I think I would rather see a Kudwafter movie than Heavenly Sword.
5764280	5768280	Like a Heavenly Sword movie sounds like something that you know.
5769280	5770280	Uwe Boll would do.
5770280	5771280	I mean cause.
5771280	5774280	I don't know if he's made any movies lately.
5776280	5779280	No I think he's been laughed out of Hollywood completely.
5780280	5782280	Yeah he's laughing all the way to the bank.
5782280	5784280	Cause he's banked a lot of money.
5786280	5788280	Ratchet and Clank sounds like he could be cute though.
5788280	5790280	That I think could work.
5790280	5791280	Anime is the way to go.
5791280	5792280	Yeah.
5792280	5793280	I mean after all.
5793280	5795280	Angry Birds are getting the movie.
5796280	5797280	I don't know how.
5797280	5798280	How?
5798280	5799280	They have cartoons.
5799280	5803280	They commit suicide by launching themselves at pigs.
5804280	5806280	But they'll do well in the Middle East.
5807280	5808280	Alright.
5808280	5809280	I'm done by leaving.
5809280	5811280	One more story for you guys.
5811280	5813280	And then we're gonna get to the classic game of the week.
5813280	5814280	This has to do with Twin Gal.
5814280	5816280	Speaking of classic games.
5816280	5817280	Twin Galaxies.
5817280	5818280	They've been around forever.
5818280	5821280	They would do the video tapes and track the scores.
5822280	5824280	They've been like shut down for about six.
5824280	5825280	Well I shouldn't say shut down.
5825280	5828280	But they've been on a break from the actual score tracking for about six months.
5828280	5830280	They've been doing some transitions.
5830280	5832280	But now they're up and running again.
5832280	5833280	But here's the thing.
5833280	5837280	Under their new system you will have to pay to have your scores reviewed.
5837280	5839280	Which you know it doesn't make sense though.
5839280	5842280	Because like legitimately they're looking through all the footage.
5842280	5844280	You know and they're watching it.
5844280	5845280	Hours at a time.
5845280	5846280	That's hours at a time.
5846280	5848280	That just means Billy Mitchell's gonna pay extra.
5849280	5851280	Review mine first and eat my barbecue sauce.
5851280	5852280	Perhaps.
5852280	5854280	$25 for one submission.
5854280	5856280	$60 for three submissions.
5856280	5858280	$75 for five submissions.
5858280	5862280	But I believe based on the length that might count as more than one submission.
5862280	5863280	So go read this.
5863280	5864280	Go read.
5864280	5865280	What did you say over there?
5866280	5867280	That bears repeating.
5867280	5869280	Say it into a mic or don't say it at all.
5869280	5870280	That's what she said.
5870280	5871280	Okay thank you very much.
5871280	5872280	Alright.
5872280	5873280	Anyhow.
5873280	5875280	Each video can only do one game.
5875280	5878280	Although you can do more than one score in the video.
5878280	5879280	That makes no sense to me.
5879280	5881280	Unless it was two different settings maybe.
5881280	5884280	Because like why would you show one score and then a better score.
5884280	5886280	Like just do the one score.
5886280	5887280	Anyway.
5887280	5888280	Whatever.
5888280	5890280	So there you go.
5890280	5891280	Twin Galaxies.
5891280	5894280	You can submit your score for $25.
5895280	5896280	I don't know.
5896280	5900280	There's been some stuff going around saying that because now they're under new ownership
5900280	5904280	that it's not quite as respectable anymore.
5906280	5908280	That happens with any company.
5908280	5911280	And also apparently that I don't know if their database crashed or something.
5911280	5913280	But they lost some of the scores.
5913280	5914280	It did.
5914280	5917280	But I'm glad you brought that up because they did comment on it.
5917280	5922280	They said the old database was damaged but not completely irretrievable.
5923280	5925280	So I guess they got some of it back.
5930280	5932280	But I'm glad that still exists.
5932280	5935280	Because there's still lots of fans of the very classic arcade games out there.
5935280	5937280	And they're still playing them.
5937280	5939280	People are still breaking Donkey Kong score records.
5939280	5942280	So I'm glad something like this exists.
5943280	5944280	Alright.
5944280	5945280	Well speaking of classic games.
5945280	5948280	Every week here on Orange Launch Radio we like to take a trip down memory lane
5948280	5950280	and visit the classic game of the week.
5952280	5956280	This is the part of the show where Dark Soccer is going to jump into the gaming vault
5956280	5961280	and find a game that she thinks, hey, record this for two hours.
5961280	5966280	And then pay me 25 bucks for telling you how awesome it was.
5966280	5968280	Dark Soccer, what's the classic game of the week?
5969280	5971280	Okay, I can't even do it, Rob.
5971280	5972280	I can't do it.
5972280	5974280	Because you have to start the music.
5974280	5975280	Fair enough.
5975280	5976280	Here's the music.
5976280	5977280	And then I'm going to shoot myself in the head.
5983280	5985280	How has this never been the classic game of the week?
5985280	5986280	I have no fucking clue.
5986280	5987280	This has been a joke forever on OLR.
5987280	5988280	I love this song.
5988280	5990280	Well, I was going to put in Ridge Racer.
5990280	5992280	And I was like, have I done Ridge Racer?
5992280	5994280	Oh my god, I haven't done Daytona.
5994280	5996280	And Dan isn't playing this shit out of Daytona.
5996280	6000280	So I hear doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo in my nightmares.
6000280	6002280	Wait, you mean you hear this?
6005280	6008280	You know what, I have a napkin and I can make it into Elise Eleven.
6008280	6014280	Somebody out there on the internet, if they haven't done it already, needs to do like a dubstep remix of this song.
6014280	6016280	Because that would be the most hilarious.
6016280	6021280	There is a video of the guy who sang for AM2 singing the song live.
6021280	6023280	And he just looks like he's having the time of his life.
6023280	6030280	Like, it's better than chocolate and getting laid, I guess.
6030280	6032280	But it was pretty funny.
6032280	6034280	Anyway, okay, so Daytona USA.
6034280	6037280	And by the way, the other song I put in was the classic Rolling Start.
6038280	6040280	Let me play a little bit of that.
6040280	6044280	We can hear this, or as I call it, Roaring Star.
6047280	6048280	Oh no no no.
6048280	6051280	Okay, I have to tell where all of my hate for this game comes from.
6051280	6053280	And it's not because it's a bad game.
6053280	6056280	If it was a bad game, it would not be on my Classic Game of the Week list.
6056280	6058280	I worked for Namco Arcade.
6058280	6064280	We had Time Crisis, we had Ridge Racer, we had Tekken 3 before everybody else did.
6064280	6066280	I had a Pac-Man hat.
6066280	6070280	I had a Polaroid camera that I got from all the leftover tickets that the kids would leave in the machine.
6070280	6073280	And I had, like, ten Tekken 3 shirts.
6073280	6074280	Like, the arcade only ones.
6074280	6078280	I loved working there, except for this one machine right across from the ticket counter.
6078280	6081280	And it would always be in loud attract mode.
6081280	6083280	Do do do do do do do do.
6083280	6086280	I'm like, can we, can I take an axe to it?
6086280	6087280	Can I break it?
6087280	6090280	Can we just say that some redneck came in and sat on it?
6091280	6093280	Because, I mean, it's Alabama, no one cares.
6093280	6097280	So, um, I wanted it to die just because of the attract.
6097280	6102280	The only other attract that was as annoying as that came close was Time Crisis 2.
6102280	6105280	Oh, that was an awful one.
6105280	6108280	The voice acting was hideous.
6108280	6109280	Oh my god.
6109280	6110280	So anyway, anyway, anyway.
6110280	6112280	Back to the game.
6112280	6113280	It is a racing game.
6113280	6117280	It was developed by Sega AM2, which we love AM2.
6117280	6120280	I mean, AM2 gave us freakin' Burning Rangers.
6120280	6122280	Hi, same guy singing, by the way.
6122280	6129280	Um, so, uh, it came out as a limited release in 1993 and a full release in 1994.
6129280	6133280	And it is one of the highest grossing arcade machines of all time.
6133280	6139280	It was the first title that came out on the Model 2 arcade board, which is easily emulated now.
6139280	6145280	And it was pretty much the best racing machine that came out at the time.
6145280	6153280	It was lower poly than Virtua Racing, but it was fully texture mapped, so it gave it more of a realistic feel.
6153280	6157280	Excepted the serious draw-in problems like, oh, I'm driving on clouds.
6157280	6158280	Oh, look, there's a mountain.
6158280	6160280	Oh, look, there's Sonic's face.
6160280	6161280	You know?
6161280	6166280	But, um, they did re-release the game as, um, oh, one thing I actually have to say.
6166280	6172280	It's actually one of the few 3D games at the time that maintained a steady 60 frames per second frame rate.
6172280	6174280	So that's pretty crazy.
6174280	6177280	Given that I can't get that on some games most of the time.
6177280	6183280	Um, so it was re-released in 2010 as Sega Racing Classic, but I don't know if anyone has played it.
6183280	6185280	They, um, took out the vocals.
6185280	6189280	It just has, like, some sort of generic singing over it.
6189280	6190280	Like, it was some background vocal.
6190280	6193280	But the main lyric part of it is gone.
6193280	6194280	It's like you're playing karaoke mode.
6194280	6195280	So it's just not the same.
6195280	6199280	So you are, um, in a stock car called the Hornet.
6199280	6203280	And you have to race, um, you know, three tracks.
6203280	6205280	Uh, either automatic or manual.
6205280	6207280	You know, choose your transmission.
6207280	6212280	And, uh, it, uh, you know, you had different ways the camera could look.
6212280	6214280	You could look, um, behind the driver's seat.
6214280	6219280	You could be, uh, you know, uh, a very first person.
6219280	6221280	And there were deluxe cabinets.
6221280	6228280	Because, um, I played Daytona USA, um, the first time I played this game was in Las Vegas.
6228280	6230280	And this was when I was still living in Alabama.
6230280	6231280	And my mom lived in Phoenix.
6231280	6234280	We flew to Phoenix and then drove to Las Vegas.
6234280	6237280	And they had the full multi-car setup.
6237280	6239280	And I was like, oh.
6239280	6241280	It was when the Luxor had a Sega arcade.
6241280	6244280	So I was completely in heaven.
6244280	6247280	And I, I paid the five bucks a game to play it twice.
6247280	6251280	And my mom was screaming at me for my fiscal irresponsibility.
6251280	6254280	So, um, I loved it then.
6254280	6256280	Hated it when I worked at an arcade.
6256280	6259280	So, yeah, it, it was really awesome.
6259280	6267280	Um, and they, uh, actually, um, came out before there was the Daytona USA museum.
6267280	6270280	But it had, um, all that attached to it.
6270280	6278280	Um, there, uh, I think it was that, um, it became out at Sega Racing Classic because they lost the Daytona license.
6279280	6286280	Uh, so basically, um, yeah, this, um, the Sega Racing Classic runs at 720p.
6286280	6291280	Um, and like I said, it lost the vocal tracks because of the licensing.
6291280	6298280	Now for the home versions, there was a Daytona USA that came out on Saturday 1995 and to Windows in 1996.
6298280	6303280	It did drop the frame rates significantly, about 20 frames per second.
6303280	6306280	And, um, clipped pretty, pretty nasty.
6306280	6309280	It was not the best version.
6309280	6312280	Um, however, it handled well.
6312280	6317280	And they had planned on doing one on the 32X, but we all know what happened with 32X.
6317280	6319280	At least we got Space Harrier, right?
6319280	6328280	So, uh, there were, um, eight tracks, including the original three from the arcade and two additional tracks, um, from the Sega Championship Circuit Edition.
6328280	6332280	And then there were final three and that was, um, for the Dreamcast version.
6332280	6334280	The Dreamcast version was pretty good.
6334280	6339280	They completely, uh, redid all of the graphics.
6339280	6341280	The pop-up was removed.
6341280	6344280	Um, the cars had transparent glass, higher poly.
6344280	6350280	It was basically like the HD version, except it controlled like shit.
6350280	6351280	Just saying.
6351280	6353280	I guess you can't have it all, huh?
6353280	6360280	Um, they did, um, an arcade faithful port for, um, PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade.
6360280	6366280	And it has widescreen, high-def, eight-player multiplayer over Xbox Live or the PlayStation Network.
6366280	6369280	Uh, more content with different challenges.
6369280	6377280	Karaoke mode, which I am embarrassed to say my husband has sat in karaoke mode, singing, roaring start.
6377280	6379280	Because he's awesome.
6379280	6381280	Because my husband's a big dork.
6381280	6382280	Dan, you're awesome.
6382280	6384280	Dan's not even listening. He's watching Chair of Swords.
6384280	6387280	With the German chocolate cake and mystique.
6387280	6391280	Well, we have pizza and Spike and Tim, so.
6391280	6392280	Yeah.
6392280	6393280	Yeah.
6393280	6395280	So, do do do do do you.
6398280	6401280	And I challenge everyone to say that to a friend this week.
6401280	6403280	Well, do do do do do do you.
6405280	6407280	Anyway, anyway.
6407280	6412280	Um, so yeah, you had, um, in the Sega Saturn version, you had unlockable cars.
6412280	6422280	You had, um, the redder blue and yellow and the black version depending on, uh, what transmission you picked in the arcade version and in the Saturn version.
6422280	6429280	Um, and, uh, basically, like I was saying, the, um, now the singer.
6429280	6437280	And this is what I was talking about earlier about AM2, um, doing, uh, the game is that AM2 had their own sound division as well.
6437280	6441280	And, uh, it was, uh, Takinobu Mitsuyoshi who was, uh, doing the singing.
6441280	6447280	And the tracks are Let's Go Away and The King of Speed, which is the roaring start.
6447280	6451280	Pounding Pavement, Let's Go Away, which is the attract mode.
6451280	6456280	Um, and, uh, Sky High, which is actually my favorite music in that game.
6456280	6458280	Because I want to fry Sky High.
6459280	6471280	So, uh, in the arcade version also used, um, a Yamaha sound chip that, uh, completely just, uh, redid and, you know, made the music sound really good, really professional.
6471280	6480280	But they had to re-record it for the Saturn version because the, um, music was actually, uh, synthesized in-game with the vocals playing over it.
6480280	6487280	So, yeah, it's, uh, Daytona USA and I'm not doing it again.
6487280	6488280	I'm done.
6488280	6489280	I will.
6489280	6490280	Oh.
6492280	6496280	By the way, you can also play as the car in Fighters Megamix.
6496280	6497280	Awesome.
6497280	6501280	There it is, your classic game of the week, Daytona.
6501280	6503280	Good pick.
6503280	6504280	It's about time, honestly.
6504280	6506280	I have a recommendation for a classic game of the week.
6506280	6508280	Super Mario Brothers 3.
6508280	6510280	I think she did it a long time ago.
6510280	6511280	I think I've done it.
6511280	6512280	And World.
6512280	6515280	She's been doing this segment since episode 180-something, I think.
6515280	6516280	And we're on 502?
6516280	6517280	No, no.
6517280	6518280	200 and something, I think.
6518280	6519280	Something like that.
6519280	6520280	You've had several segments.
6520280	6521280	It's changed a few times.
6521280	6523280	Classic game of the week started around 200 and something.
6523280	6527280	But we stopped doing, uh, website of the week when I did, um, one site twice.
6527280	6528280	Yeah.
6528280	6529280	Because I couldn't really think of anything.
6529280	6530280	What was the site?
6530280	6533280	You did one classic game twice and that didn't stop you.
6533280	6534280	What did I do?
6534280	6535280	You did Final Fantasy VI twice.
6535280	6537280	But, I mean, if you're gonna do any game twice, like-
6537280	6539280	Okay, one was three, one was six.
6539280	6540280	There, I did versions.
6540280	6541280	Don't judge me.
6541280	6542280	Fair enough.
6542280	6545280	I don't wanna do Sega Rally because it's very hard, easy left.
6545280	6546280	Wait.
6546280	6547280	Maybe.
6547280	6548280	All right, look.
6548280	6549280	Uh, long show.
6549280	6550280	We've got, we gotta take a break.
6550280	6551280	We're gonna come back.
6551280	6552280	We have rapid fire news.
6552280	6554280	Fugal Question of the Week coming as well.
6554280	6555280	Uh, some more news stories for you guys.
6555280	6560280	And, as we promised, listless, what mascot are we gonna gift to Sega just out of the
6560280	6561280	goodness of our hearts?
6561280	6565280	What do you, what do you, the listeners, want us to gift to Sega, uh, for their mascot competition?
6565280	6571280	Uh, we will beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep right back with more of Orange
6571280	6572280	Lounge Radio right after this.
6575280	6586280	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this, I almost said Friday
6586280	6587280	night.
6587280	6589280	Aw, I wish the weekend was starting over.
6589280	6592280	Sunday night, April the 28th of 2013.
6592280	6599280	And, uh, join in studio tonight with Captain Spike from the Game Buoy podcast at gamebuoy.org.
6599280	6600280	Ahoy.
6601280	6602280	Ahoy.
6602280	6605280	We were talking, we were talking about, you and I were, I won't spoil it on the show,
6605280	6608280	but you and I were talking about some potential upcoming topics that you're gonna get into
6608280	6610280	on your show, and some, I was like, oh, that's real good.
6610280	6611280	That's real good.
6611280	6615280	So, if I try, if I don't steal them for OLR 503.
6615280	6616280	Rude.
6616280	6617280	And ignorant.
6617280	6618280	I would never, I would never.
6618280	6622280	Uh, also joining us tonight, Tim, who is on his very first podcast.
6622280	6623280	What up?
6623280	6624280	Are you having a good time?
6624280	6625280	Is it more fun than you thought it would?
6625280	6626280	It's less terrifying than I imagined.
6626280	6627280	Yeah?
6627280	6628280	Yeah.
6628280	6632280	It looks like it's in, like, literally, literally the corner of my apartment.
6632280	6636280	And not, like, a studio with lights everywhere.
6636280	6640280	Like, people think that, like, this show, because it's so damn old, people think that
6640280	6642280	we have, like, this recording space.
6642280	6646280	Or maybe because there's certain other podcasters out there that put out that perception that
6646280	6649280	you need $35,000 to do a gaming podcast.
6649280	6650280	No tea, no shade.
6650280	6653280	All tea, all tea.
6653280	6657280	That we have all this expensive equipment, but we don't really have any of that.
6657280	6659280	No, it's, it's pretty, pretty chill.
6659280	6662280	I slept on the floor not four feet from here last night.
6662280	6666280	You can, you can literally say you slept with Orange Lounge Radio.
6666280	6668280	I'm not going to tell anyone.
6668280	6669280	Please, please don't spread that rumor.
6669280	6674280	I do have to say that when we buy a house, we're definitely looking for a place that
6674280	6675280	has room for O.L.R.
6675280	6678280	Actually, we're looking at, Alan and I are looking at moving ourselves.
6678280	6680280	Oh my God, let's all get a big house.
6680280	6683280	Oh my God, I'd kill you all.
6683280	6684280	No.
6685280	6687280	I wasn't talking, I said my Rob.
6687280	6688280	Been there, done that.
6688280	6689280	I lived with Loki before.
6689280	6690280	Been there, done that.
6690280	6691280	That's actually.
6691280	6693280	You have seen me drunk in my pajamas.
6693280	6695280	With all due respect, Loki was a great roommate.
6695280	6696280	I want to make that clear.
6696280	6699280	The only reason, you know, he got married and blah, blah, blah.
6699280	6701280	And I have a kid, so that would be a little weird.
6701280	6703280	That would be a challenge, would be a challenge.
6703280	6704280	All right.
6704280	6707280	By the way, Josh looked totally cute in that last picture.
6707280	6708280	I just have to say.
6708280	6711280	Actually, yeah, Nellie's been posting a lot of pictures of Josh late and I got to say
6711280	6712280	cute, cute kid.
6712280	6716280	I mean, not that I didn't think so before, but just that I'm being reminded consistently
6716280	6717280	on Facebook this week.
6717280	6718280	Cute, cute kid.
6718280	6720280	For the record, I have to say this.
6720280	6724280	I gave Julian the Nerf shield and dagger for his birthday.
6724280	6729280	He had the most maniacal grin on his face and wanted to immediately sword fight.
6731280	6735280	Looking at comments from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, SSJ100Matt says,
6735280	6738280	the OLR beach house.
6738280	6745280	That's like the summer spinoff where the Saved by the Bell kids all worked at the beach retreat or whatever.
6745280	6748280	Don't you dare use Jersey Shore and OLR in the same sentence.
6748280	6750280	I will cut a bitch.
6750280	6752280	Dark Tetsuya says, move into the fort.
6752280	6754280	Yes, we talked about that some time ago.
6754280	6758280	Code Man says, OLR real world.
6758280	6760280	There would definitely be some drama.
6760280	6761280	Start getting real.
6761280	6765280	If Jamie and I lived in the same house, like 24-7, there would definitely be some drama.
6766280	6767280	I like that.
6767280	6770280	Fifth Dream says, OLR celebrity rehab.
6770280	6771280	Wait, what's that tip?
6771280	6774280	Fifth Dream says, OLR celebrity rehab.
6774280	6776280	Rehab from tacos, maybe.
6776280	6777280	You know what?
6777280	6778280	I don't do drugs already.
6778280	6780280	Rob Roberts, My Strange Addiction.
6780280	6782280	Every Tuesday would be Taco Tuesday.
6782280	6785280	We'd have the live cast from Felipe's on Tuesday.
6785280	6787280	Your guys' cycle would line up.
6788280	6790280	Fuck off.
6791280	6792280	Hearts.
6793280	6799280	Let's move to rapid fire news while I stare at Captain Spike with my death eyes.
6799280	6801280	I'm so precious.
6802280	6804280	I think maybe we already did sync up.
6804280	6805280	Alright.
6805280	6810280	You may remember an independent game that kind of ripped off of Super Mario Brothers.
6810280	6814280	Super Mario Brothers Crossover is a fun game where you get to play all the Super Mario Brothers levels.
6815280	6824280	But you get to play them as not only Super Mario or Luigi or Zelda or Simon Belmont and that kind of stuff.
6824280	6827280	So now they have 3.0 because it's celebrating 3 years.
6827280	6830280	And they've got a pretty interesting...
6830280	6836280	I didn't know that this game existed, but apparently there's a game called Super Mario Brothers Special.
6836280	6840280	It's a crossover between Super Mario Brothers and Donkey Kong.
6840280	6842280	Donkey Kong power-ups and stuff like that.
6842280	6844280	And barrels and all sorts of cool stuff.
6844280	6846280	So that's the newest update.
6846280	6848280	It's going to be levels out of that game.
6848280	6851280	And they have a whole bunch of other game types.
6851280	6856280	Because one of the things that the game does is it changes the way it looks.
6856280	6861280	And so you can be playing with all the different characters from Castlevania and stuff.
6861280	6864280	It just changes the whole sprite set and the sound effects and stuff.
6864280	6866280	It's really interesting.
6866280	6868280	But if you want to check it out...
6868280	6873280	It looks like explodingrabbit.com is where you're going to be able to find that game, of course.
6873280	6877280	I don't know when the 3.0 update is coming soon, though.
6877280	6879280	But they have a trailer for it.
6879280	6881280	How are they pushing that?
6881280	6885280	I gave them money on their Kickstarter for Super Retro Squad.
6885280	6887280	It's still coming in March.
6887280	6890280	Yeah. Well, no Kickstarters ever on time.
6890280	6892280	But yeah, there's...
6892280	6893280	How's your Ouya?
6893280	6894280	Did you get your Ouya?
6894280	6897280	My Ouya right now is chilling in...
6897280	6901280	Where was it? It's in the Bay Area right now.
6901280	6903280	Just outside of Fremont.
6903280	6904280	Daily City?
6904280	6906280	Fucking Fremont!
6906280	6907280	No, seriously!
6907280	6909280	It's in my living room, by the way.
6909280	6912280	Seriously. Fucking Fremont. You know why?
6912280	6914280	Not even Fremont. Fremont's out of this.
6914280	6916280	It's a close bystander.
6916280	6918280	No, seriously. Fucking Daily City or whatever.
6918280	6919280	It's at the Cow Palace.
6919280	6921280	Whatever it is.
6921280	6923280	Oh, that's right where Alan used to live.
6923280	6925280	It's been sitting there since Thursday.
6925280	6927280	Not moving. At all.
6927280	6929280	I like the traffic.
6929280	6932280	Yes. But you see, it's like it went...
6932280	6934280	It keeps getting worse.
6934280	6936280	First off, it took forever for them to ship it.
6936280	6938280	They shipped it by boat.
6938280	6941280	Look, we could do a three hour show of you bitching about your Ouya.
6941280	6943280	No, no, no. Hold on.
6943280	6945280	I'm with him on this one. They haven't shipped mine out yet either.
6945280	6947280	No, no. Listen. Here's how it's going.
6947280	6949280	So they shipped it by boat.
6949280	6951280	First off, they picked DHL.
6951280	6953280	DHL. The quality shipper.
6953280	6955280	The only worse shipper in the world would be Old Dominion.
6955280	6957280	For the record,
6957280	6959280	Dan was playing a racing game and there were DHL stickers
6959280	6961280	and I totally thought of you.
6961280	6963280	Well, it better not be a DHL car
6963280	6965280	because that car would be moving fucking slow.
6965280	6967280	This is a damn heated Loki.
6967280	6969280	So they shipped it DHL.
6969280	6971280	DHL and then the strategic
6971280	6973280	mailing thing, they passed
6973280	6975280	it off to the United States Postal Service.
6975280	6977280	Which, from my experience
6977280	6979280	shipping eBay stuff,
6979280	6981280	they always scan those packages
6981280	6983280	and they totally never
6983280	6985280	just go weeks
6985280	6987280	at a time without, hey,
6987280	6989280	here's where your package is.
6989280	6991280	I'm expecting my package hopefully on Monday.
6991280	6993280	Otherwise, I don't know where it is.
6993280	6995280	Because it shouldn't take
6995280	6997280	a whole weekend
6997280	6999280	from Thursday
6999280	7001280	to go two hours
7001280	7003280	in distance.
7003280	7005280	Are you done?
7005280	7007280	I'm done.
7007280	7009280	So, there was a new game coming
7009280	7011280	from Take-Two.
7011280	7013280	XCOM, or at least
7013280	7015280	The Bureau, XCOM
7015280	7017280	Declassified. It was that first person
7017280	7019280	XCOM game that no one wanted
7019280	7021280	and now it's a third person XCOM game
7021280	7023280	that some people might want.
7023280	7025280	And it's a squad based shooter.
7025280	7027280	So, yeah.
7027280	7029280	It's supposed to be like a prequel to the whole XCOM series
7029280	7031280	to figure out how the XCOM
7031280	7033280	Bureau, I guess,
7033280	7035280	was created or something. I don't know.
7035280	7037280	And last but not least,
7037280	7039280	the Indoroyale Lunar Bundle
7039280	7041280	as we were talking about earlier,
7041280	7043280	purchasing. Pretty great deal
7043280	7045280	if you pay
7045280	7047280	what you want.
7047280	7049280	$6 gets you the game.
7049280	7051280	$8 gets you some additional stuff
7051280	7053280	including the Reawakening
7053280	7055280	album, which is from
7055280	7057280	some Commodore 64 and Amiga chiptune
7057280	7059280	artist TJK. And then also
7059280	7061280	in this bundle you get some
7061280	7063280	cool stuff including Back to the Future.
7063280	7065280	You know, the whole Telltale game.
7065280	7067280	Nice. And Dungeon Hearts
7067280	7069280	Carve Commander and
7069280	7071280	let's see
7071280	7073280	what else.
7073280	7075280	P.I.D. was the other game.
7075280	7077280	So, I bought it. It's pretty awesome.
7077280	7079280	So, check it out.
7079280	7081280	Alrighty.
7081280	7083280	Let's move on and talk about the Wii U virtual
7083280	7085280	console. We've kind of referenced this already
7085280	7087280	in the show. If you didn't know, that Wii U
7087280	7089280	update is out. Yes, it does make a lot
7089280	7091280	of stuff on the console faster. So, you know,
7091280	7093280	here's a reason to turn on your Wii U
7093280	7095280	if you beat Zombie U
7095280	7097280	and Mario U a couple months ago and you really
7097280	7099280	haven't had a reason.
7099280	7101280	Fire it up, download the update, and you can
7101280	7103280	check out some of these virtual console games. Balloon Fight,
7103280	7105280	Donkey Kong Jr.,
7105280	7107280	Excitebike, Kirby's Adventure, Punch Out,
7107280	7109280	F-Zero, Super Mario World, and
7109280	7111280	of course, Ice Climbers.
7111280	7113280	All available on virtual console.
7113280	7115280	And, yeah,
7115280	7117280	even though I said
7117280	7119280	when we first announced
7119280	7121280	the virtual console on Wii U, I wasn't gonna do this.
7121280	7123280	I did it. I paid the $1.50
7123280	7125280	to upgrade my copy of Super Mario World.
7125280	7127280	I gotta say, it runs really nice.
7127280	7129280	Like, I really prefer it on Wii U to the Wii.
7129280	7131280	I didn't think it would be that big of a difference.
7131280	7133280	And, like, how could a 20-year-old game
7133280	7135280	be that different? But I'm telling you, with the
7135280	7137280	HDMI, without me having to consistently
7137280	7139280	change the proportions on the television,
7139280	7141280	with the audio coming out of
7141280	7143280	the Wii U pad as well as the TV,
7143280	7145280	it works great. So,
7145280	7147280	you know, alright. I was wrong
7147280	7149280	when I first judged virtual console a few months ago.
7149280	7151280	Fine. Alright.
7151280	7153280	Speaking of things that are available on
7153280	7155280	Nintendo platforms and PC and so forth,
7155280	7157280	Scribblenauts. There's a new Scribblenauts
7157280	7159280	and supposedly it's titled
7159280	7161280	Scribblenauts Unmasked, although that's not an
7161280	7163280	official revelation. That's something that's
7163280	7165280	floating out there. Apparently, it's supposed
7165280	7167280	to be some type of crossover with DC
7167280	7169280	Comics, hence the name Unmasked.
7169280	7171280	Oh, I'm sure Dark Soccer is all about this.
7171280	7173280	I'm not gonna play it.
7173280	7175280	Characters like Batman, places like the Batcave
7175280	7177280	supposed to be out on PC,
7177280	7179280	Wii U, and 3DS, so it's
7179280	7181280	definitely a Nintendo and a PC thing.
7181280	7183280	I remember the last
7183280	7185280	Scribblenauts game was one of the launch titles for Wii U,
7185280	7187280	so this would make an interesting fit.
7187280	7189280	It would be a very interesting step
7189280	7191280	for the series, but seeing as Scribblenauts
7191280	7193280	is part of WB Games, it does
7193280	7195280	make sense. So,
7195280	7197280	curiosity piqued. We'll say that.
7197280	7199280	Also, this
7199280	7201280	rumor's going around. I don't
7201280	7203280	know how much weight I give this. It could certainly
7203280	7205280	be a game changer, but the rumor is that Take-Two
7205280	7207280	is supposed to announce Grand Theft Auto
7207280	7209280	5 for next generation consoles next
7209280	7211280	month. Now, did this originate
7211280	7213280	with an analyst, that
7213280	7215280	infamous games analyst that always says
7215280	7217280	because if so, then this holds absolutely
7217280	7219280	no weight. It's not coming out next gen.
7219280	7221280	It's not, and here's why. It's because
7221280	7223280	they're gonna do a PC. They will do a PC
7223280	7225280	version later on, just like they did with 4,
7225280	7227280	and they're gonna do that probably with the next
7227280	7229280	gen consoles at the same time. Here's my other
7229280	7231280	problem with this article. They say the announcement
7231280	7233280	is supposed to be coming during an upcoming
7233280	7235280	investor event on May 16th.
7235280	7237280	They don't make announcements. They don't do that
7237280	7239280	at investor events. Investor events are
7239280	7241280	not the place to pull back the curtain and say
7241280	7243280	the investor event is to talk about
7243280	7245280	here's what's happened in the
7245280	7247280	past, here's where we are currently, here's
7247280	7249280	our plan for the future in broad
7249280	7251280	terms, not in these types of specifics.
7251280	7253280	That's the big problem I have
7253280	7255280	with this that's going around right now. I don't think
7255280	7257280	that, and here's the other thing too, is they're not going to
7257280	7259280	spend the additional time to make a
7259280	7261280	next gen version of the game when they have a current
7261280	7263280	gen version of the game that people will buy anyways.
7263280	7265280	Unless, unless someone
7265280	7267280	paid them big money to make it
7267280	7269280	an exclusive to their console. I still
7269280	7271280	don't think they would do that because even if they
7271280	7273280	still do, even if they brought out
7273280	7275280	the game, they're gonna do a PC version at the same
7275280	7277280	time because why bother? If you're gonna
7277280	7279280	develop a higher res version of the game, you might as
7279280	7281280	well make a PC version as well so that you can put it out
7281280	7283280	in PCs. Unless someone
7283280	7285280	bought it off. That's always
7285280	7287280	a possibility on the table. Someone bought
7287280	7289280	it off. It's always on the table.
7289280	7291280	Well if that were the case then it would be coming out exclusive
7291280	7293280	you know like for one system like the Xbox
7293280	7295280	360 was for a while and
7295280	7297280	the PS3 version came out and PC.
7297280	7299280	But I just, I don't see
7299280	7301280	that happening. Did they date Grand Theft Auto 5?
7301280	7303280	Did they date it? It's September
7303280	7305280	17th. Well then yeah I guess we are too
7305280	7307280	far along for them to change that at this point.
7307280	7309280	I was gonna say there's no reason they can't
7309280	7311280	yank it and say, delay the first quarter
7311280	7313280	in this version. Oh I'm gonna fucking kill somebody if
7313280	7315280	that happens. I will cut a bitch.
7315280	7317280	I don't know if you should say that on a radio show.
7317280	7319280	No I will fucking
7319280	7321280	kill somebody.
7321280	7323280	Virtually people.
7323280	7325280	Allegedly. It's Grand Theft Auto of course
7325280	7327280	you will kill somebody digitally.
7327280	7329280	He'll kill a hooker. No I think
7329280	7331280	I will have to
7331280	7333280	I will have to kill somebody. Don't say that
7333280	7335280	in this world Loki you don't
7335280	7337280	say that. They already deleted how many times
7337280	7339280	I can't wait any longer. Just get ready.
7339280	7341280	I can't wait any longer. Get ready to sharpen the purple
7341280	7343280	dildo. Wait wrong game.
7343280	7345280	I can't wait any longer. It's been
7345280	7347280	so long. I need my Grand Theft Auto.
7347280	7349280	You need a therapist.
7349280	7351280	I need Grand Theft Auto.
7351280	7353280	Alright Dark Sakura.
7353280	7355280	Alright I gotta
7355280	7357280	get my story up. Okay.
7357280	7359280	Sorry my throat's a little
7359280	7361280	alley right now. Okay well
7361280	7363280	we have some download content for
7363280	7365280	Revengeance. We have Blade Wolf and it's
7365280	7367280	going to be out in May in Japan
7367280	7369280	on the 9th of May. We don't
7369280	7371280	have a western date yet but
7371280	7373280	I would assume that it would have to be somewhere
7373280	7375280	near there and it's going to be a thousand
7375280	7377280	yen. So
7377280	7379280	we're looking at maybe a
7379280	7381280	ten dollar DLC
7381280	7383280	when we get it.
7383280	7385280	In other news.
7385280	7387280	Close window. Thank you. There is
7387280	7389280	going to be a sequel to River City
7389280	7391280	Ransom and
7391280	7393280	there is a crowd funding
7393280	7395280	thing open for it.
7395280	7397280	They want to make it an official
7397280	7399280	River City Ransom.
7399280	7401280	They're working with the River City Ransom
7401280	7403280	EX developer Million to do
7403280	7405280	the actual sequel.
7405280	7407280	They're hoping it's going to be
7407280	7409280	August 2014.
7409280	7411280	They've got a placeholder website out
7411280	7413280	for this right now. Just to throw a little background
7413280	7415280	into this. I think the reason why they say
7415280	7417280	actual sequel is because something is coming on 3DS
7417280	7419280	I think but it's not
7419280	7421280	the same people. So you kind of
7421280	7423280	have the two groups
7423280	7425280	now. The ones on Kickstarter.
7425280	7427280	Are they doing another Nekketsu
7427280	7429280	game on 3DS?
7429280	7431280	I think so. Yeah.
7431280	7433280	One of the actual Kunio games?
7433280	7435280	Yes. Honestly that will be far superior.
7435280	7437280	Yup.
7437280	7439280	Actually.
7439280	7441280	The shade. The shade of it all.
7441280	7443280	You know what? It's just true.
7443280	7445280	Because you cannot
7445280	7447280	like ok super
7447280	7449280	you played dodgeball and super dodgeball right?
7449280	7451280	They're actual Kunio games. You've played
7451280	7453280	knock off dodgeball games right? Were they as good?
7453280	7455280	No. Is anything going to
7455280	7457280	top the original hot blooded
7457280	7459280	downtown fight?
7459280	7461280	The Neo Geo one was great.
7461280	7463280	You know what the best version of that
7463280	7465280	was? PC Engine. Had voice acting.
7465280	7467280	Ok.
7467280	7469280	Did you ever play the PC Engine version? Yes.
7469280	7471280	Isn't that adorable? They're so cute.
7471280	7473280	Anyway. Like when you go
7473280	7475280	into the little restaurants they actually say
7475280	7477280	speak to you politely and
7477280	7479280	bow to you and everything. It's awesome.
7479280	7481280	Ok so TKX
7481280	7483280	is going to be a remake of
7483280	7485280	Tempest 2000. Yes. TXK.
7485280	7487280	Whatever. TXK.
7487280	7489280	You know what Rob? I'm so excited.
7489280	7491280	I'm dyslexic. I have
7491280	7493280	excited on set dyslexia.
7493280	7495280	Thank you.
7495280	7497280	I'm quaking a little bit
7497280	7499280	right now. Shaking. Crying.
7499280	7501280	Maybe your
7501280	7503280	super zapper needs to recharge.
7503280	7505280	Super zapper recharge.
7505280	7507280	Ok for anyone who lives under a rock
7507280	7509280	or who has been living
7509280	7511280	under a rock or in a cave or under the sea
7511280	7513280	Tempest 2000 is probably one of the best
7513280	7515280	games in the universe. Even as
7515280	7517280	frustratingly difficult as
7517280	7519280	it can be. It's all because of the music. Because nothing
7519280	7521280	else matters. And it came out on the Jaguar
7521280	7523280	which was the only good game on the Jaguar
7523280	7525280	next to what?
7525280	7527280	Alien vs. Predator? No that wasn't even
7527280	7529280	very good either. For the time.
7529280	7531280	Yeah. But it was still the best game
7531280	7533280	that ever came out on the Jaguar. Hands down.
7533280	7535280	Yeah. It was the only reason to
7535280	7537280	own a Jaguar. And then it came out on Saturn.
7537280	7539280	And then I actually did play
7539280	7541280	the Jaguar version of Tempest 3000 that was
7541280	7543280	the proto. It was not bad.
7543280	7545280	So anyway. So yeah. This is basically
7545280	7547280	a remake of Tempest 2000.
7547280	7549280	And that's it.
7551280	7553280	I am all about this as well. K.X.T.
7553280	7555280	K.X.T.
7555280	7557280	K.X.T.
7557280	7559280	Alright.
7559280	7561280	Let's take a chance
7561280	7563280	to go to the FUGL
7563280	7565280	question of the week.
7569280	7571280	Take
7571280	7573280	Facebook.
7573280	7575280	Take Google.
7575280	7577280	Slam them together and you get FUGL.
7577280	7579280	And we ask a question on our FUGL
7579280	7581280	Facebook and Google communities every week.
7581280	7583280	This week is about movies.
7583280	7585280	And I'm going to apologize in advance. I'm not going to have enough time
7585280	7587280	to read all the answers because we're running along tonight.
7587280	7589280	We still have a list list. But
7589280	7591280	I want to encourage everybody to visit our communities.
7591280	7593280	Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio
7593280	7595280	and Google Plus to see all the answers
7595280	7597280	in full. There's some news
7597280	7599280	this week about Ratchet and Clank as well as
7599280	7601280	Heavenly Sword becoming a movie.
7601280	7603280	How do you feel about video game movies?
7603280	7605280	Most have a reputation for being pretty bad.
7605280	7607280	Do you think this helps or hurts gaming?
7607280	7609280	Should Hollywood be making more video game movies
7609280	7611280	or less?
7611280	7613280	Let's take a look at some of the answers
7613280	7615280	on Google Plus.
7615280	7617280	ActDeaf says
7617280	7619280	Video game movies as of recent have been
7619280	7621280	hit or miss for the masses.
7621280	7623280	But it will be a while for us to see a critically acclaimed
7623280	7625280	video game movie. I don't think it either
7625280	7627280	hurts that bad or helps that much for the industry.
7627280	7629280	Both ways, they're
7629280	7631280	just easy money makers for everyone
7631280	7633280	involved mostly. But as of recent
7633280	7635280	Hollywood has seen how to make video game
7635280	7637280	movies work somewhat. So I'll keep an eye on that
7637280	7639280	Ratchet and Clank movie. Especially if it's animated
7639280	7641280	since that's the only way I can see that one working.
7641280	7643280	Flaco Jones
7643280	7645280	which by the way, I want to congratulate
7645280	7647280	Flaco Jones. He's now officially staffed
7647280	7649280	for VOG. His first movie
7649280	7651280	review went up and he's got
7651280	7653280	another article that's posted during the week.
7653280	7655280	He's going to be doing a lot of the stuff from a film
7655280	7657280	perspective.
7657280	7659280	In the written form. So that'll be
7659280	7661280	great. So congrats Flaco.
7661280	7663280	And that's also going to be a very
7663280	7665280	interesting change for the game.
7665280	7667280	Because as you know, staff of VOG
7667280	7669280	don't go on the regular leaderboards.
7669280	7671280	So Flaco has been winning every month.
7671280	7673280	So, hmm
7673280	7675280	now things are going to get interesting.
7675280	7677280	But anyhow, Flaco says as long as they bring something
7677280	7679280	unique to the table, I have no problem with more
7679280	7681280	video game movies. The issue arises
7681280	7683280	when the video game property is already so similar
7683280	7685280	to a popular movie genre. Like what's
7685280	7687280	the difference between a Call of Duty film and just
7687280	7689280	some generic military action movie.
7689280	7691280	I don't know if the bad movies hurt the games.
7691280	7693280	It puts them into the public eye which at least means
7693280	7695280	more games I would think.
7695280	7697280	Entertainment lastly on Google Plus says
7697280	7699280	in an ideal situation you need a
7699280	7701280	writer, director, and producer
7701280	7703280	all having good track records
7703280	7705280	working together as a team.
7705280	7707280	That is why I'm looking forward to Tyler
7707280	7709280	Perry Presents Halo.
7709280	7713280	Love it.
7713280	7715280	Let's do a few answers from
7715280	7717280	Facebook as well. Critical Myth
7717280	7719280	whose podcast talks a lot about movies
7719280	7721280	and TV shows and that stuff and he does
7721280	7723280	a lot of the book reviews for our site.
7723280	7725280	Critical Myth says I love the
7725280	7727280	R&C games but the last two
7727280	7729280	have been less than stellar so I'm actually
7729280	7731280	hopeful that this will give Insomniac a reason
7731280	7733280	to revitalize the franchise. But in general
7733280	7735280	terms I think it always comes down to the creative
7735280	7737280	minds behind the production. Do they understand
7737280	7739280	the IP and what a film adaptation
7739280	7741280	can bring to the table that the game itself does not?
7741280	7743280	And is the game suited to a film
7743280	7745280	style narrative?
7745280	7747280	Pete Caruno says some game
7747280	7749280	franchises lend themselves very well
7749280	7751280	to film adaptations even though the execution
7751280	7753280	has pretty much always been awful.
7753280	7755280	Ratchet and Clank really doesn't strike me as the
7755280	7757280	kind of game that ought to have a film made of it
7757280	7759280	unless they're really that desperate for money?
7759280	7761280	And lastly on Facebook
7761280	7763280	Andy R. says as a Playstation fan
7763280	7765280	I was pretty happy about the news but I'm
7765280	7767280	concerned as well. Hollywood doesn't have
7767280	7769280	a great track record and I do think it hurts us
7769280	7771280	when they poorly adapt a game. I can see
7771280	7773280	a non-gamer saying this was based on a game
7773280	7775280	no wonder it was so bad
7775280	7777280	when we know that games can be a great medium
7777280	7779280	for storytelling. As for more or less
7779280	7781280	there are plenty of games I would love to see as
7781280	7783280	movies so I wouldn't mind more than
7783280	7785280	more once they figure out how to make them
7785280	7787280	without sucking. You know that's a very
7787280	7789280	interesting comment and I kind of
7789280	7791280	want to end on that and turn it over to the folks here
7791280	7793280	in studio is he theorizes
7793280	7795280	there that if the movie is
7795280	7797280	so bad it's going to make people go
7797280	7799280	well no wonder because it's a
7799280	7801280	game and the game probably sucks too.
7801280	7803280	So can the movies actually do harm
7803280	7805280	to video gaming when they're
7805280	7807280	really terrible?
7807280	7809280	I honestly think it also really depends
7809280	7811280	on the audience too because there's been a lot
7811280	7813280	of really good Japanese adaptations
7813280	7815280	that wouldn't fly over
7815280	7817280	here for the general audience because
7817280	7819280	of that quirkiness that's a part
7819280	7821280	of Japanese
7821280	7823280	game movie versions.
7823280	7825280	And people
7825280	7827280	here want either it to be
7827280	7829280	super cutesy or super
7829280	7831280	gritty, realistic, have an edge to it
7831280	7833280	and I don't really see it.
7833280	7835280	It would really depend on the IP.
7837280	7839280	I don't know which came first the Alone in the Dark
7839280	7841280	movie or the
7841280	7843280	Alone in the Dark game
7843280	7845280	by Atari. Like the last
7845280	7847280	one. Because I
7847280	7849280	don't remember which one hurt what.
7849280	7851280	I'm sure Tara Reid being a scientist didn't help.
7851280	7853280	Oh stop.
7853280	7855280	Spike, how do you feel about video game movies?
7855280	7857280	Well you know
7857280	7859280	I think that they're largely
7859280	7861280	mediocre at best.
7861280	7863280	I think it's kind of telling when you have
7863280	7865280	recent movie games like Prince of
7865280	7867280	Persia and the general perception
7867280	7869280	is still oh game movies are getting
7869280	7871280	better.
7871280	7873280	So they're mostly crap but I
7873280	7875280	don't think they hurt.
7875280	7877280	Again, Street Fighter is still a franchise
7877280	7879280	that exists and that movie was awful.
7879280	7881280	See also Super Mario Brothers with
7881280	7883280	Bob Hoskins. Hey, hey.
7883280	7885280	Kylie was in it. No
7885280	7887280	it was in Street Fighter yes.
7887280	7889280	Sorry I thought you meant the Mario movie.
7889280	7891280	The cast in that Street Fighter movie was actually super
7891280	7893280	good. But I feel so bad
7893280	7895280	for dearly departed Raul Julia
7895280	7897280	for that being his last movie.
7897280	7899280	Although I have seen him in some really crappy
7899280	7901280	movies. And you guys even forgot that there was another
7901280	7903280	Street Fighter movie. Yeah there was the
7903280	7905280	Chun-Li, that horrible Chun-Li thing.
7905280	7907280	Didn't Bison
7907280	7909280	cause harm with
7909280	7911280	psychic powers to a woman in a way
7911280	7913280	that I don't really feel appropriate describing?
7913280	7915280	Well you know what I didn't see it and
7915280	7917280	I don't really want to.
7917280	7919280	I was really drunk but I feel like I was offended
7919280	7921280	and that takes a lot.
7921280	7923280	I'm going to stick with the
7923280	7925280	ties that bind the best Street Fighter thing that came
7925280	7927280	out. That's the only thing in my universe.
7927280	7929280	The thing that came out with Street Fighter 4.
7929280	7931280	Yeah that was really good.
7931280	7933280	So Tim what do you think? If they end up
7933280	7935280	doing this new Mass Effect movie do you think
7935280	7937280	it's going to do justice to the games?
7937280	7939280	I don't
7939280	7941280	think it will do justice to the games. I think it will be
7941280	7943280	something completely different. It might be good, it might be bad.
7943280	7945280	In general I think
7945280	7947280	video game movies have been pretty hit or miss.
7947280	7949280	But I'm pretty hopeful because I look at
7949280	7951280	something like the comic book industry
7951280	7953280	which they made a lot of
7953280	7955280	stinker comic book movies.
7955280	7957280	But eventually Hollywood and the comic
7957280	7959280	industry figured out how to do that.
7959280	7961280	And there have been some stellar comic book games.
7961280	7963280	So I have hope that in the future
7963280	7965280	they sort of solve that problem
7965280	7967280	for games
7967280	7969280	translating over to movies as well.
7969280	7971280	That's a good point.
7971280	7973280	I tend to agree with the other person that talked about
7973280	7975280	how if the right people with the right
7975280	7977280	passion are behind it
7977280	7979280	it has the potential to do very well.
7979280	7981280	Which you know anything Uwe Boll
7981280	7983280	touched you're like oh girl no.
7983280	7985280	I feel that
7985280	7987280	I'm assuming Sony is going to be
7987280	7989280	publishing the movie.
7989280	7991280	It's studios that they pick
7991280	7993280	to do these licenses.
7993280	7995280	I would assume that they're going to be
7995280	7997280	up to their standards
7997280	7999280	because it is
7999280	8001280	their properties that they're playing with.
8001280	8003280	I would think that they wouldn't just let anything
8003280	8005280	come to market.
8005280	8007280	I don't know.
8007280	8009280	They've done some tie-ins and stuff
8009280	8011280	with different EA properties
8011280	8013280	like some anime movies and I don't think those were that
8013280	8015280	bad.
8015280	8017280	Shane in our chat
8017280	8019280	room who of course has a thing or two to say
8019280	8021280	about Mass Effect says no one can agree with how
8021280	8023280	the Mass Effect movie should be because
8023280	8025280	we all have our different stories and shepherds.
8025280	8027280	Prince Brightstar says
8027280	8029280	frankly I think Mass Effect would be better as a Saturday
8029280	8031280	morning cartoon picturing the April
8031280	8033280	Fool's 12th well there was the anime
8033280	8035280	just saying. You know what actually I have
8035280	8037280	did I tell you I got that?
8037280	8039280	It wasn't terrible.
8039280	8041280	I hate
8041280	8043280	admitting that it wasn't terrible.
8043280	8045280	The ending of it
8045280	8047280	totally was like
8047280	8049280	you know all the stuff
8049280	8051280	that they do in Mass Effect 3 that wants to punch you in the
8051280	8053280	gut and make you vomit your feelings?
8053280	8055280	Yeah it did that too.
8055280	8057280	Alright.
8057280	8059280	To register participation for this week's
8059280	8061280	episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com
8061280	8063280	use the passphrase
8063280	8065280	yogurt. Let's do a couple
8065280	8067280	more news stories. We've got Listless coming up but first
8067280	8069280	Loki.
8069280	8071280	I'm sorry I forgot
8071280	8073280	to say at the end of the FUGL segment please
8073280	8075280	read the rest of the answers. I really skipped
8075280	8077280	a lot tonight because of time. Sorry.
8077280	8079280	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or
8079280	8081280	Google Plus search for Orange Lounge Radio.
8081280	8083280	Sorry Loki go ahead. So EA has had
8083280	8085280	some more layoffs. They haven't really said
8085280	8087280	who was laid off.
8087280	8089280	Apparently
8089280	8091280	I guess
8091280	8093280	there was an eternal memo that leaked out
8093280	8095280	basically
8095280	8097280	saying that you know at the beginning of their fiscal
8097280	8099280	year
8099280	8101280	they're cutting some of their operations.
8101280	8103280	Core marketing
8103280	8105280	functions have been consolidated
8105280	8107280	under their new COO.
8107280	8109280	I
8109280	8111280	guess they're just restructuring it looks like.
8111280	8113280	And
8113280	8115280	also
8115280	8117280	with that there was a rumor that EA
8117280	8119280	partners label is closing.
8119280	8121280	And that includes you know all those
8121280	8123280	other
8123280	8125280	you know developers out there that are bringing different
8125280	8127280	titles. There's you know of course the crisis series
8127280	8129280	Shadows of the Damned, Alice, The Madness
8129280	8131280	Returns, Bulletstorm,
8131280	8133280	Brutal Legend, and Rock Band.
8133280	8135280	And I guess I
8135280	8137280	wonder if that would affect Fuse. But of course
8137280	8139280	Fuse is just right around the corner so I'm sure that game
8139280	8141280	will still come out. But we may see
8141280	8143280	a lot less
8143280	8145280	I guess
8145280	8147280	not necessarily
8147280	8149280	experimental titles but titles that aren't
8149280	8151280	they aren't positive
8151280	8153280	would do well. Like new properties
8153280	8155280	like Mirror's Edge or something like that.
8155280	8157280	You know Alice
8157280	8159280	thought that would have done okay but
8159280	8161280	apparently it didn't sell very well in the shadows of the dam.
8161280	8163280	Suda is
8163280	8165280	hard to
8165280	8167280	it's more niche
8167280	8169280	so it's
8169280	8171280	I'm surprised. And then last but not least
8173280	8175280	SimCity
8175280	8177280	You know there's always bad news
8177280	8179280	when I mention SimCity. It got a patch
8179280	8181280	it fixed some bugs.
8181280	8183280	Godzilla is attacking
8183280	8185280	the city!
8185280	8187280	Well
8187280	8189280	SimCity 2.0
8189280	8191280	came out. It fixed
8191280	8193280	a few bugs
8193280	8195280	and unfortunately created a bunch of other
8195280	8197280	bugs.
8197280	8199280	So yeah
8199280	8201280	lots of weird stuff.
8201280	8203280	We're pathing problems still.
8203280	8205280	Apparently the problem was sewage backing
8205280	8207280	up. So
8207280	8209280	your towns are literally full of shit now.
8209280	8211280	All sorts of
8211280	8213280	sinking problems.
8213280	8215280	Yeah they actually have this group of people
8215280	8217280	on Reddit
8217280	8219280	putting together a list of stuff that's
8219280	8221280	wrong with it now.
8221280	8223280	So that kind of sucks.
8223280	8225280	It's still a work in progress.
8225280	8227280	And then falsely accused all the wrong people of making
8227280	8229280	those bugs.
8229280	8231280	I guess.
8231280	8233280	No tea no shade.
8233280	8235280	Alright.
8235280	8237280	Anything else you want to
8237280	8239280	share about SimCity?
8239280	8241280	SimCity 4
8241280	8243280	apparently is on sale right now. You can get it for
8243280	8245280	really cheap. So if you want to play a great SimCity game
8245280	8247280	there you go.
8247280	8249280	And it's offline.
8249280	8251280	Moving on. I think this is
8251280	8253280	fascinating. A patent that Apple filed in
8253280	8255280	2009.
8255280	8257280	What the patent is all about is that
8257280	8259280	you have a path that you might take in
8259280	8261280	a video game. And what's
8261280	8263280	fascinating about this is that in
8263280	8265280	the patent filing they
8265280	8267280	freaking use these mock ups of mass effect
8267280	8269280	screenshots. And it even says
8269280	8271280	name. John Sheppard. Origin
8271280	8273280	colonist. And like a little mock up of what they
8273280	8275280	look like and everything. That's the first thing that made me
8275280	8277280	go is this like a joke or a troll or
8277280	8279280	you know. LOL games journalism
8279280	8281280	thing. I don't know. But since it's floating around
8281280	8283280	out there I will report on it because I think this is a
8283280	8285280	fascinating idea.
8285280	8287280	The patent office
8287280	8289280	did grant Apple this patent. And it was
8289280	8291280	made public. And
8291280	8293280	it would go like this. Like let's say
8293280	8295280	in mass effect you make all
8295280	8297280	these different choices. Or let me take a game that
8297280	8299280	you know Loki would actually play
8299280	8301280	like Walking Dead. Like the
8301280	8303280	Walking Dead games.
8303280	8305280	Well the Telltale ones are really good.
8305280	8307280	Let's say you go through the Walking Dead games
8307280	8309280	you make your different choices and obviously they have
8309280	8311280	a big impact. Well the trick about this
8311280	8313280	patent is that at the end after
8313280	8315280	you've developed your character played the game. So imagine
8315280	8317280	you play a game like Walking Dead at the end
8317280	8319280	you can use this system that
8319280	8321280	Apple patented and you get a
8321280	8323280	single issue comic
8323280	8325280	that is filled with the
8325280	8327280	choices that you made in the game. And the dialogue
8327280	8329280	and the screenshots. And you could export it
8329280	8331280	assumably to like a PDF that you could
8331280	8333280	then later read on your tablet or your
8333280	8335280	mobile device or what have you.
8335280	8337280	So like imagine Jamie could have her femshep
8337280	8339280	and romance garis and all this and she gets
8339280	8341280	her very own. Cause that's the only point
8341280	8343280	of playing mass effect. Well that is all you
8343280	8345280	do right? Yes.
8345280	8347280	So you get your comic book. And strip
8347280	8349280	mine planets. And you know Dark Sakura
8349280	8351280	presents Shakerian Sunday
8351280	8353280	and it's something she can
8353280	8355280	get on her iPad
8355280	8357280	and read it. And it's like oh it's
8357280	8359280	it's me and my garis.
8359280	8361280	I am not that bad.
8361280	8363280	Are you sure? I don't have the moe pillow.
8365280	8367280	But you thought about it.
8367280	8369280	No I didn't. Did you see how expensive
8369280	8371280	it was?
8371280	8373280	I love how that
8373280	8375280	was the reason. Look at me.
8375280	8377280	That was the reason. I don't have money
8377280	8379280	for a pillow.
8379280	8381280	And besides I didn't really care for the art that much.
8381280	8383280	Alright actually very popular
8383280	8385280	in our chat room. ActDeaf says
8385280	8387280	this thing Rob is talking about is fucking awesome.
8387280	8389280	SG100Matt says this sounds like a good idea.
8389280	8391280	ActDeaf says where do I throw my money
8391280	8393280	to?
8393280	8395280	Queen Simeon in our chat says that's
8395280	8397280	like the little personalized vanity books
8397280	8399280	back when I was a kid. Oh yeah
8399280	8401280	like the choose your own adventure stuff
8401280	8403280	where like it would be you in the story.
8403280	8405280	Don't they sell that at the fair or something like that?
8405280	8407280	They brought back choose your own adventure.
8407280	8409280	Yeah Bobby was talking about something like that on the show tonight.
8409280	8411280	I miss those but I used to skip to the end
8411280	8413280	to see what the best
8413280	8415280	because there's only like one path fits.
8415280	8417280	Right.
8417280	8419280	Where you don't sneeze horrifically
8419280	8421280	in the middle of a show.
8421280	8423280	Twice.
8425280	8427280	You know what?
8427280	8429280	Don't laugh at me making squeaky noises.
8429280	8431280	No that was like the cutest sound I've ever heard.
8431280	8433280	I'm allergic to Papa Murphy's
8433280	8435280	I think.
8435280	8437280	Garris would approve of your cute sneezes.
8437280	8439280	What were you going to say about the vanity books?
8439280	8441280	I forget.
8441280	8443280	Alright.
8443280	8445280	And thank you.
8445280	8447280	Alright.
8447280	8449280	This is a good idea.
8449280	8451280	Yeah the vanity books
8451280	8453280	is a really good comparison but in this day and age
8453280	8455280	where you just crank it all out digitally
8455280	8457280	into a 99 cent PDF or something
8457280	8459280	I think it's a great
8459280	8461280	as corny as this is going to sound
8461280	8463280	it would be a great memory
8463280	8465280	of your gaming experience.
8465280	8467280	Because like you know a game like Mass Effect
8467280	8469280	you know again I hate to keep using this as an example
8469280	8471280	but it's such a good example.
8471280	8473280	It takes like 40 hours to play through Mass Effect
8473280	8475280	and then maybe you're sitting here for two years
8475280	8477280	waiting for the sequel to come out.
8477280	8479280	Well wouldn't it be great if instead of having to replay
8479280	8481280	that 40 hour game like to kind of refresh yourself
8481280	8483280	oh let me read my little comic
8483280	8485280	that I had generated at the end and remember
8485280	8487280	about my character and my choices.
8487280	8489280	People do that anyway it's called fan fiction.
8489280	8491280	It's called Tumblr.
8491280	8493280	No no no.
8493280	8495280	I think that's a pretty accurate statement.
8495280	8497280	It's called Tumblr.
8497280	8499280	So did Apple try to patent Tumblr is that what we're saying?
8499280	8501280	Alright.
8501280	8503280	Let's go to something
8503280	8505280	that's going to need a patent here.
8505280	8507280	It's tonight's Listless.
8515280	8517280	Alright for those of you guys that have never been here
8517280	8519280	for Listless before let me tell you how it works.
8519280	8521280	We're going to go around
8521280	8523280	well first the point of this whole thing
8523280	8525280	is that we are going to come up with
8525280	8527280	the definitive list.
8527280	8529280	No arguments, no exceptions.
8529280	8531280	We're going to solve a great
8531280	8533280	question in gaming right now
8533280	8535280	with this highly scientific process.
8535280	8537280	And the way it's going to work we're going to all go around the room
8537280	8539280	there's five of us tonight so it's like a super Listless
8539280	8541280	Super Mario Listless.
8541280	8543280	We're going to go around the room tonight
8543280	8545280	and each of us are going to name three
8545280	8547280	things for the list. We're going to nominate them for the list.
8547280	8549280	But then the exciting part
8549280	8551280	is we go around the room and each person
8551280	8553280	will strike one item that is
8553280	8555280	not worthy of the list.
8555280	8557280	And remember our new twist as of the last time
8557280	8559280	we did this should a host have
8559280	8561280	two of their items eliminated from the list
8561280	8563280	the third item gets
8563280	8565280	immunity so that way it does
8565280	8567280	not like a person's entire list doesn't get eliminated.
8567280	8569280	So and then
8569280	8571280	the chat room will vote on their top
8571280	8573280	and we will get the one, two, and three.
8573280	8575280	The definitive list.
8575280	8577280	So here it is. Chatters if you want to help out tonight
8577280	8579280	start yelling your answers in
8579280	8581280	chat now. The topic tonight
8581280	8583280	mascot we most want
8583280	8585280	to gift to Sega
8585280	8587280	on behalf of OLR. Earlier in the show
8587280	8589280	we talked about Sega
8589280	8591280	Sega is looking for your
8591280	8593280	mascot in a nutshell. I mean I'm really
8593280	8595280	cutting corners here but they're looking for your
8595280	8597280	mascot ideas and they could use them
8597280	8599280	in a future press conference.
8599280	8601280	So we want to give them something on behalf of OLR
8601280	8603280	and VOG and all that. So here we go
8603280	8605280	going around the room
8605280	8607280	and giving our list
8607280	8609280	of the
8609280	8611280	mascots we'd most like to see.
8611280	8613280	Ladies first DarkSakura your number
8613280	8615280	three answer tonight. What
8615280	8617280	mascot would you most like to gift
8617280	8619280	Sega? Master System
8619280	8621280	the Sega robot.
8621280	8627280	And what would Master System the Sega robot be?
8627280	8629280	He'd be a cute robot
8629280	8631280	but he wouldn't be like mecha sonic because that would be
8631280	8633280	too derivative. He'd just be a cute
8633280	8635280	little chibi robot or maybe
8635280	8637280	powerful like one of the Robo-Eleste
8637280	8639280	robots.
8639280	8641280	Because Robo-Eleste needs more love
8641280	8643280	that game was awesome shut up.
8643280	8645280	I'm with you on that. But his name would be
8645280	8647280	Master System. Alright.
8647280	8649280	Because the Master System hello.
8649280	8651280	Alright.
8651280	8653280	Let's go around. Loki how about your
8653280	8655280	number three answer tonight for the list.
8655280	8657280	That's easy President Cat.
8657280	8659280	Why? Because it's
8659280	8661280	President Cat. Well that is a very
8661280	8663280	OLR thing and is being shouted by a lot of people in chat.
8663280	8665280	So President Cat. So I thought we had to pick something
8665280	8667280	original. Not necessarily.
8667280	8669280	Well who said President Cat has to
8669280	8671280	be that same President Cat? Since
8671280	8673280	clearly that game company didn't give
8673280	8675280	a fuck about our idea.
8675280	8677280	And you
8677280	8679280	might remember the translation was something like what
8679280	8681280	Boss Cat we said President Cat. No
8681280	8683280	Sukeban is like a female delinquent
8683280	8685280	and Shacho is like a
8685280	8687280	company president. You're like a female delinquent.
8687280	8689280	Shut you know what Rob?
8689280	8691280	What? I'm going to hit you in the face with a yo-yo.
8691280	8693280	And the only people
8693280	8695280	who would get that are people who actually sell Sukeban
8695280	8697280	Deca.
8697280	8699280	Alright.
8699280	8701280	SSG 100
8701280	8703280	Matt had a really good suggestion.
8703280	8705280	I will do my
8705280	8707280	number three answer then. My number three
8707280	8709280	answer for the list is well here's
8709280	8711280	the thing. Okay so on the Bobby
8711280	8713280	Black Wolf show he has an unofficial
8713280	8715280	mascot called Clicky the pen.
8715280	8717280	But if I were to try to steal
8717280	8719280	that on behalf of OLR
8719280	8721280	he might get very mad and threaten to sue.
8721280	8723280	So my number three answer tonight is
8723280	8725280	Dicky the pen.
8725280	8727280	Dicky the pen
8727280	8729280	is awesome.
8729280	8731280	Get it?
8731280	8733280	Dicky the pen
8733280	8735280	is awesome.
8735280	8737280	Just
8737280	8739280	think about that one for a little bit. Alright hey
8739280	8741280	Spike who's over there frowning at my
8741280	8743280	answer. What is your
8743280	8745280	number three answer for the list of
8745280	8747280	mascot you'd like to gift to Sega? I'd like to
8747280	8749280	gift to Sega Rob Roberts
8749280	8751280	in a Bjork swan dress.
8751280	8753280	Okay.
8753280	8755280	Do I have to
8755280	8757280	do I have to sing like her?
8757280	8759280	You have to have the egg purse too.
8759280	8761280	I'm a
8761280	8763280	fountain of love
8763280	8765280	in the
8765280	8767280	shade of love
8767280	8769280	I feel so bad for your listeners.
8769280	8771280	I'm
8771280	8773280	just singing Bjork.
8773280	8775280	Alright.
8775280	8777280	Lastly
8777280	8779280	but not leastly with the number three item
8779280	8781280	for the list tonight. Tim what is your contribution
8781280	8783280	to the list? Well since I think that
8783280	8785280	crowdsourcing a new mascot is kind of sad
8785280	8787280	I think a good mascot for them would be
8787280	8789280	a 32x with a frowny face.
8789280	8791280	So a regular 32x.
8791280	8793280	A 32x
8793280	8795280	with a frown face.
8795280	8797280	Alright.
8797280	8799280	Let's go to the number two answers.
8799280	8801280	Jamie.
8801280	8803280	Well keep in mind I'm not doing mine in any particular
8803280	8805280	order I'm just doing them in the order I want to list them in.
8805280	8807280	Fine. Segata Sanshiro the second.
8807280	8809280	Somebody
8809280	8811280	in chat said that earlier I think.
8811280	8813280	Yeah but they actually said Segata
8813280	8815280	Sanshiro but since I'm being original it's
8815280	8817280	Segata Sanshiro
8817280	8819280	the second. It's
8819280	8821280	ATA.
8821280	8823280	Segata Sanshiro
8823280	8825280	the second. Alright.
8825280	8827280	And if you
8827280	8829280	don't have seen it look up the Segata Sanshiro
8829280	8831280	videos after the show.
8831280	8833280	Alright. Loki your number two
8833280	8835280	answer tonight. A forklift.
8841280	8843280	And why would their mascot be a
8843280	8845280	forklift? Did you not play Shenmue?
8845280	8847280	Oh okay I get it yeah yeah yeah.
8851280	8853280	I think you can even incorporate it into like new
8853280	8855280	I thought there was going to be a joke there about
8855280	8857280	like moving things into the warehouse
8857280	8859280	but alright fine.
8859280	8861280	Whatever however you want to take it.
8861280	8863280	It's funny in multiple formats.
8863280	8865280	I think the joke was how you didn't get it.
8865280	8867280	I just I'm sorry my
8867280	8869280	brain didn't instantly think of Shenmue
8869280	8871280	out of all the video games in the world. It should always
8871280	8873280	think of Shenmue.
8873280	8875280	I apologize.
8875280	8877280	Alright my number two answer tonight.
8877280	8879280	Let's see I'm gonna take
8879280	8881280	this one from chat because it's so good
8881280	8883280	and I didn't really like the answer that I had written
8883280	8885280	but I think a great mascot on behalf
8885280	8887280	of Orange Lounge Radio would be
8887280	8889280	Non-Sylon Occupied Caprica
8889280	8891280	would be their mascot.
8891280	8893280	You are awful.
8893280	8895280	I approve but you're awful.
8895280	8897280	It's a long running
8897280	8899280	OLR joke Spike. Just smile
8899280	8901280	and nod. Alright Non-Sylon Occupied Caprica
8901280	8903280	from S.H.O.N. and I'm out is my number two
8903280	8905280	answer for the list. So Captain
8905280	8907280	Spike what is your number two answer for the list?
8907280	8909280	So I don't know your memes or anything
8909280	8911280	so I'm just gonna go with Dark Sakura
8911280	8913280	in a sailor suit.
8915280	8917280	Can I at least have a gun?
8917280	8919280	Sure. Yay!
8919280	8921280	Dark Sakura in a sailor
8921280	8923280	suit and a gun.
8923280	8925280	Why?
8925280	8927280	Because look at her that would be badass.
8927280	8929280	I thought it was a Duffy thing. Actually
8929280	8931280	you know what? I love
8931280	8933280	Duffy! I thought it was because Duffy wore a sailor.
8933280	8935280	Oh! Oh sure! Sure when you don't
8935280	8937280	get my references that's okay.
8937280	8939280	I don't get your references and that's a crime
8939280	8941280	against gaming.
8941280	8943280	Yep. By the way
8943280	8945280	little factoid my very first cosplay
8945280	8947280	ever was Sailor Venus.
8947280	8949280	That's awesome.
8949280	8951280	This skirt was way too short.
8951280	8953280	Alright
8953280	8955280	let's go to Spike. In the name of the moon
8955280	8957280	I will fuck you up. Let's go to
8957280	8959280	Tim's number two answer. Tim
8959280	8961280	what is your number two answer for the list? It was actually
8961280	8963280	really similar to Spike's and we did not plan it
8963280	8965280	that way but it was
8965280	8967280	the entire like all three OLR
8967280	8969280	hosts doing Bayonetta cosplay.
8969280	8971280	I don't have that much hair.
8971280	8973280	Can Loki be Jean?
8973280	8975280	Yeah
8975280	8977280	Loki can be Jean. Rob has to be the other witch.
8977280	8979280	What was her?
8979280	8981280	Yeah no.
8981280	8983280	He can be the little girl.
8983280	8985280	The little young virgin.
8985280	8987280	No! I will not be a little girl.
8987280	8989280	I'm not you. You be Jean.
8989280	8991280	He be the little girl. Oh okay I'm sexy right?
8991280	8993280	I guess.
8993280	8995280	You'll be wearing a breastplate.
8995280	8997280	I didn't say yes I just said I guess.
8997280	8999280	Alright so far the
8999280	9001280	list of mascots we will give to Sega.
9001280	9003280	Master System the Sega robot.
9003280	9005280	President Kat. Dickey the pen.
9005280	9007280	Rob Robertson
9007280	9009280	a Bjork swan dress.
9009280	9011280	32X with a frowny face.
9011280	9013280	Segata Sanshiro the second.
9013280	9015280	A forklift. Non-silon occupied
9015280	9017280	Caprica. Dark Sakura in a sailor
9017280	9019280	suit and a gun. All
9019280	9021280	OLR hosts in Bayonetta cosplay.
9021280	9023280	This is the worst list ever. Hey I'm already wearing the glasses.
9023280	9025280	I just like how everyone assumed I would
9025280	9027280	be Bayonetta so thank you.
9027280	9029280	The only way I would
9029280	9031280	wear high heels is if they had guns on them.
9031280	9033280	Number one
9033280	9035280	answers for the list.
9035280	9037280	Here we go.
9037280	9039280	Dark Sakura.
9039280	9041280	Oppa Oppa's retarded cousin Oppai Oppai that looks like a huge
9041280	9043280	boob.
9043280	9045280	That was oddly specific.
9045280	9047280	Oppai
9047280	9049280	is boob in Japanese.
9049280	9051280	So it would be
9051280	9053280	I won't use the R
9053280	9055280	word in the answer. I will say
9055280	9057280	Oppa Oppa's Oppai huge boob
9057280	9059280	cousin. It's O-P-P-A-I by the way.
9059280	9061280	Oppai!
9061280	9063280	Oppai Oppai.
9063280	9065280	Yeah. Instead of Oppa Oppa.
9065280	9067280	Because we all know that Fantasy
9067280	9069280	Zone is awesome.
9069280	9071280	Okay. There we go.
9071280	9073280	Loki your number one
9073280	9075280	answer. Ooh La La.
9075280	9077280	Because
9077280	9079280	why not? But Ooh La La
9079280	9081280	is already a Sega character. But she's not
9081280	9083280	a mascot. Yeah she does mascot stuff.
9083280	9085280	Kinda. Alright fine.
9085280	9087280	Space Michael Jackson.
9087280	9089280	Space Michael.
9089280	9091280	Here we go.
9091280	9093280	Nah we don't need a
9093280	9095280	topless Ooh La La. It's a video game character.
9095280	9097280	Apollo Smiles has already been everywhere topless
9097280	9099280	so don't worry about it. Hey come on. I'll put it
9099280	9101280	but it's getting taken down.
9103280	9105280	Oh Rob.
9105280	9107280	I'm already taking down one of yours.
9107280	9109280	If I can't have that
9109280	9111280	you know
9111280	9113280	I'm gonna instead of a game character
9113280	9115280	I want a game to be an actual
9115280	9117280	the Japanese table flipping game.
9117280	9119280	The arcade game.
9119280	9121280	It should just be a big table being flipped over.
9121280	9123280	Have you played that? It's awesome.
9123280	9125280	No I want to play it. It looks awesome.
9125280	9127280	That emote icon could just be their new mascot.
9127280	9129280	I love Chiggers Forever for saying
9129280	9131280	Dame Edna.
9131280	9133280	Hello my puppets.
9133280	9135280	Have you heard about my blast
9135280	9137280	processing?
9137280	9139280	That's it.
9139280	9141280	I have to redo the
9141280	9143280	pandaren meme and have it say
9143280	9145280	blast processing.
9145280	9147280	Alright. I'm stealing X Defers
9147280	9149280	meme. The sad thing is like 98%
9149280	9151280	of the audience just isn't gonna understand.
9151280	9153280	But for the
9153280	9155280	2% that do. You're welcome.
9155280	9157280	You know what? I'll do it for us.
9157280	9159280	Captain Spike. Your number one answer.
9159280	9161280	Well I've done
9161280	9163280	one for Rob and I've done one for Dark
9163280	9165280	Sakura. So I'm gonna go with Loki in a
9165280	9167280	banana hammock with a giant
9167280	9169280	purple dildo bat.
9171280	9173280	You should've just
9173280	9175280	done as Tingle.
9175280	9177280	Unfortunately. No no
9177280	9179280	Loki you were the one that wanted
9179280	9181280	to get past Tingle. So
9181280	9183280	Loki in a banana hammock with a purple dildo
9183280	9185280	bat is on the list.
9185280	9187280	And I can actually cosplay that in
9187280	9189280	Saint's Row.
9189280	9191280	Alright.
9191280	9193280	One more.
9193280	9195280	One more here.
9195280	9197280	From Tim to add to the list.
9197280	9199280	Last chance to get something on the list. Oh wait no I didn't do
9199280	9201280	my number one did I? No you didn't. Oh shit.
9201280	9203280	Alright then my number one answer.
9203280	9205280	My number one answer would be
9205280	9207280	now my number one answer is
9207280	9209280	inspired by the fact. I don't know if you guys know this. It's been
9209280	9211280	San Francisco in the Sega building. They're
9211280	9213280	no longer there in the Sega building. You know what company moved
9213280	9215280	in in their place?
9215280	9217280	Was Zynga. So my
9217280	9219280	number one answer or mascot is Zeke
9219280	9221280	the Zynga killer. And he's a coyote
9221280	9223280	that eats dogs.
9223280	9225280	You're a horrible person
9225280	9227280	Rob. I approve. Oh he only eats
9227280	9229280	Zynga dogs. Don't worry. Okay well then he can eat the
9229280	9231280	Zynga dog.
9231280	9233280	My number one answer
9233280	9235280	is Zeke the Zynga killer. Alright.
9235280	9237280	Last but not leastly. Tim
9237280	9239280	your number one answer. My
9239280	9241280	number one answer is a
9241280	9243280	terrifying amalgamation of all of
9243280	9245280	Sonic's shitty friends.
9245280	9247280	Like
9247280	9249280	some
9249280	9251280	vaguely Sonic shaped character
9251280	9253280	that's pink like the girl
9253280	9255280	Amy and has
9255280	9257280	Knuckles' hands and
9257280	9259280	a gun.
9259280	9261280	So it would be the Sonic Gestalt?
9261280	9263280	Yeah Sonic Gestalt. Thank you.
9263280	9265280	Alright. But it would have to be called SBO
9265280	9267280	cause that was the weirdest name. Alright sorry guys
9267280	9269280	this is a highly scientific process.
9269280	9271280	I'm gonna run down the list but here's some items that didn't
9271280	9273280	make the list from chat. I'm really surprised
9273280	9275280	with some of these. SJ100Matt the giggling
9275280	9277280	lesbians didn't make the list tonight.
9277280	9279280	Chigurh said Dame Edna
9279280	9281280	which we said.
9281280	9283280	Who was talking about the singer from D-Light?
9283280	9285280	It was when
9285280	9287280	he brought up Ulala.
9287280	9289280	The whole lawsuit and everything like that. Lady
9289280	9291280	Miss Keira Kirby. Let's
9291280	9293280	see. I'd vote for Bootsy Collins.
9293280	9295280	Nobody said Ferret. That surprised
9295280	9297280	me as well.
9297280	9299280	Let's see
9299280	9301280	what else did we say? Peep the Peep jouster
9301280	9303280	says SJ100Matt. Needs
9303280	9305280	more Rappy says Prince Brightstar.
9305280	9307280	We didn't name a ferret because
9307280	9309280	we respect the ferret too much.
9309280	9311280	Alright. But guys
9311280	9313280	this list is too big. It's time
9313280	9315280	to thin it down a little bit so we have to
9315280	9317280	go around the list. Since there's so many
9317280	9319280	people please let me know if you got two of your items
9319280	9321280	eliminated cause I don't know who said what at this point.
9321280	9323280	So let me run down the list and we will start eliminating.
9323280	9325280	Here we go. Master System
9325280	9327280	the Sega Robot. President
9327280	9329280	Cat. Dickey the Pen.
9329280	9331280	Rob Robertson a Bjork swan
9331280	9333280	dress. A 32X
9333280	9335280	with a frowny face.
9335280	9337280	Segata Sanshiro the second.
9337280	9339280	A forklift. Non-silent
9339280	9341280	occupied Caprica. Dark Sakura
9341280	9343280	in a sailor suit and a gun.
9343280	9345280	All OLR hosts in Bayonetta cosplay.
9345280	9347280	Oppa Oppa's Oppai Oppai
9347280	9349280	huge boob cousin.
9349280	9351280	Table flipping arcade game.
9351280	9353280	Loki in a banana hammock with a purple dildo back.
9353280	9355280	Zeke the Zynga killer.
9355280	9357280	And an amalgamation of all of Sonic's
9357280	9359280	shitty friends.
9359280	9361280	However this list is too big.
9361280	9363280	Dark Sakura. Which of these is not worthy
9363280	9365280	of the list? Just because
9365280	9367280	it's old and
9367280	9369280	played out by non-silent
9369280	9371280	occupied Caprica. Non-silent
9371280	9373280	occupied Caprica. It has been stricken
9373280	9375280	from the list. It might have stayed if it was a bottle of
9375280	9377280	Propel. Loki
9377280	9379280	which of these is not worthy of the list?
9379280	9381280	I don't think anyone wants to see me in a banana hammock
9381280	9383280	so...
9383280	9385280	I knew that was happening. Loki in a banana
9385280	9387280	hammock with a purple dildo back. It has been stricken
9387280	9389280	from the list. Spike
9389280	9391280	Oh wait no I'll go next. Me
9391280	9393280	which one am I going to strike from the list?
9393280	9395280	I'm sorry
9395280	9397280	Dark Sakura but I'm going to remove
9397280	9399280	Segata Sanchiro the 2nd
9399280	9401280	because you know what
9401280	9403280	a copy of something that's already out there is
9403280	9405280	too easy. Oh that's right that would be too much
9405280	9407280	awesome for the universe. But then who are they going to
9407280	9409280	base Segata 2 off of?
9409280	9411280	I know. Why didn't
9411280	9413280	we not have... except it would be nothing but bad
9413280	9415280	decisions. Hey not my problem. Hey hey
9415280	9417280	kids not my problem. It has been
9417280	9419280	stricken from the list.
9419280	9421280	Spike which of these is not worthy of the list?
9421280	9423280	I don't understand Dickey the pen
9423280	9425280	and so I don't wish to see it.
9425280	9427280	Alright. You know what we should have
9427280	9429280	said? We should have said
9429280	9431280	crap and now I just
9431280	9433280	forgot it. Nevermind. Alright Dickey
9433280	9435280	the pen. It has been stricken from the list.
9435280	9437280	This means Zeke the Zynga killer
9437280	9439280	has immunity. It's my last answer that's there.
9439280	9441280	So I think all that's left
9441280	9443280	though is Tim. So Tim
9443280	9445280	which of these is not worthy of the list?
9445280	9447280	Um
9447280	9449280	am I allowed to eliminate one of my own?
9449280	9451280	Yes you can if you must. 32X with a frowny
9451280	9453280	face is super depressing.
9453280	9455280	A 32X with a frowny
9455280	9457280	face. Tim has decided you know
9457280	9459280	what I'm not feeling it anymore.
9459280	9461280	I would rather see an amalgamation of all
9461280	9463280	sonic shitty friends. So it has
9463280	9465280	been stricken from the list. It should have the little
9465280	9467280	quote bubble that says kill me.
9467280	9469280	I remembered what it is. I remembered what the
9469280	9471280	suggestion that we should have done was. What?
9471280	9473280	Pepsi man. Oh.
9473280	9475280	Pepsi man.
9475280	9477280	Alright guys
9477280	9479280	that means it is time to
9479280	9481280	vote in tonight's list list. I'm going to
9481280	9483280	paste the list here in chat right

9485280	9487280	your number two answers via private message

9491280	9493280	System the Sega Robot. President
9493280	9495280	Cat. Rob Roberts in a Bjork
9495280	9497280	swan dress. That stayed.
9497280	9499280	Yes.
9499280	9501280	Forklift. Dark Sakura in a
9501280	9503280	suit and a gun. All O.L.R.
9503280	9505280	hosts a Bayonetta cosplay.
9505280	9507280	That stayed. Yes.
9507280	9509280	Hey I can only eliminate one.
9509280	9511280	Oppa Oppas. Oppai Oppai
9511280	9513280	huge boob cousin.
9513280	9515280	Table flipping arcade game. Zeke
9515280	9517280	the Zynga killer. And an
9517280	9519280	amalgamation of all of sonic shitty
9519280	9521280	friends. Send your votes via
9521280	9523280	private message to Rob Roberts
9523280	9525280	with your number one and your number two answers.
9525280	9527280	And to answer that question I see in
9527280	9529280	chat right now from BS JasonXV
9529280	9531280	why aren't we using the vognetwork.com
9531280	9533280	poll for this? All I'm going to
9533280	9535280	say is soon.
9535280	9537280	But not tonight.
9537280	9539280	Alright so
9539280	9541280	send those votes in
9541280	9543280	right now. We're going to tally them up and we'll let you know a little
9543280	9545280	later in the show. Hey SSJ100 Matt
9545280	9547280	I don't think that Konami would want to let go
9547280	9549280	of their awesome lie-in to Sega.
9549280	9551280	Alright
9551280	9553280	while I tally up those votes
9553280	9555280	I think we're going to take a- Dude I miss Pepsi man
9555280	9557280	those commercials were hilarious.
9557280	9559280	Yes. Alright while I tally up those
9559280	9561280	votes we're going to take a trip to the mailbag.
9561280	9563280	Oh fuck. Every week you guys send us
9563280	9565280	emails to mailbag
9565280	9567280	at orange lounge radio dot com and Dark
9567280	9569280	Sakura respectfully opens up the email bag
9569280	9571280	every week and dives in. What the hell is this shit?
9571280	9573280	And picks out some of her favorite
9573280	9575280	emails to read. It's all
9575280	9577280	sticky. At least it's not
9577280	9579280	powdery. Dark Sakura what
9579280	9581280	emails are you going to read tonight?
9581280	9583280	Okay I approve of how this one started. It's
9583280	9585280	from Degenerate Johnny. Greetings
9585280	9587280	and Salutations. Which I have
9587280	9589280	to do the Christian Slater voice from
9589280	9591280	Heathers. Greetings
9591280	9593280	and Salutations O.L. Army. It's the one
9593280	9595280	and only Degenerate Johnny. I wanted to
9595280	9597280	email you about last week's show pertaining to the lack
9597280	9599280	of strong female lead characters in video games.
9599280	9601280	I'm not sure if you've had the chance to
9601280	9603280	watch Anita Sarcasians
9603280	9605280	I know I pronounced that wrong
9605280	9607280	Kickstarter video discussing the
9607280	9609280	damsel in distress trope in games. But it
9609280	9611280	mentions the same topic. If you have not
9611280	9613280	I'm sure someone will post a link in chat.
9613280	9615280	While I do agree that feminism
9615280	9617280	is moving at a snail's pace
9617280	9619280	the lack of diversity is becoming less common
9619280	9621280	than it was ten years ago. Today we
9621280	9623280	see three dimensional character
9623280	9625280	development for both genders of all sexual
9625280	9627280	orientations. Such as Toni Prince
9627280	9629280	GTA 4, Samantha Trainor and Mass Effect 3.
9629280	9631280	We even see strong female
9631280	9633280	leads who evolve significantly throughout
9633280	9635280	certain game series such as a
9635280	9637280	young naive independent summoner who
9637280	9639280	learns how to become independent with
9639280	9641280	goals of her own. Yes I'm a guy that
9641280	9643280	played and actually enjoyed Final Fantasy
9643280	9645280	10-2. 10-2 Rob!
9645280	9647280	Big whoop. Wanna fight
9647280	9649280	about it? No I'm not judging you.
9649280	9651280	No hate, no hate. The great thing
9651280	9653280	about interactive entertainment is that it promotes
9653280	9655280	individualism over traditionalism. Therefore
9655280	9657280	the player is free to accept others regardless
9657280	9659280	of their race, religion, gender and sexual
9659280	9661280	orientation.
9661280	9663280	It is unfortunate that we live in a patriarchal
9663280	9665280	society but I believe that
9665280	9667280	both the feminism
9667280	9669280	and homosexual movement will progress
9669280	9671280	faster once the traditionalist
9671280	9673280	members of the Baby Boomer generation
9673280	9675280	retwire, retire
9675280	9677280	from the professional world. Although
9677280	9679280	I won't be present for tonight's show
9679280	9681280	I'm heading a card game tournament.
9681280	9683280	Kick their ass. I'm interested
9683280	9685280	in hearing your thought on this.
9685280	9687280	Congratulations on 502 episodes
9687280	9689280	O.L. Army
9689280	9691280	Knight Degenerate Johnny.
9691280	9693280	You, yeah?
9693280	9695280	This
9695280	9697280	is the thing about progress.
9697280	9699280	When people get it in their head
9699280	9701280	that progress needs to happen, it will
9701280	9703280	happen.
9703280	9705280	Like you said, the old guard's gonna
9705280	9707280	die out.
9707280	9709280	Any other thoughts?
9709280	9711280	I'm gonna admit
9711280	9713280	I'm furiously counting votes over here so
9713280	9715280	can you summarize real quick for me?
9715280	9717280	Basically, there's
9717280	9719280	a lot more diversity in video games. We're seeing
9719280	9721280	more strong female leads come out
9721280	9723280	and that basically the old
9723280	9725280	head up their ass
9725280	9727280	Baby Boomer traditionalist people are gonna die out.
9727280	9729280	Well they're not really playing video games
9729280	9731280	anyway. No. But I worry about
9731280	9733280	when I see these articles about how people believe
9733280	9735280	that strong female leads won't
9735280	9737280	sell. That makes me
9737280	9739280	sick. Or the statistic that 18% of
9739280	9741280	people are playing femshep.
9741280	9743280	We think it would be a little closer to 50-50.
9743280	9745280	You know what really surprised me
9745280	9747280	about that is just about every bit of the
9747280	9749280	fandom I've seen has been
9749280	9751280	surrounding a female shepherd.
9751280	9753280	Maybe once
9753280	9755280	or twice we'll see like a
9755280	9757280	thicc with a male shepherd or
9757280	9759280	fanart of broshep.
9759280	9761280	So I'm just saying.
9761280	9763280	Alright.
9763280	9765280	Okay.
9765280	9767280	Someone we haven't heard from in a while, Rob.
9767280	9769280	Hi OLR crew.
9769280	9771280	My email is directed towards Skye who asked
9771280	9773280	a simple question on episode 501.
9773280	9775280	What's coming to Playstation Vita?
9775280	9777280	The answer to that is found on Reddit where
9777280	9779280	users compiled a list of upcoming games
9779280	9781280	even those without set release dates. Here's
9781280	9783280	the link so you can skim through the list.
9783280	9785280	I don't care. I mean.
9785280	9787280	Hold on.
9787280	9789280	I freaking read it.
9789280	9791280	Guacamelee.
9791280	9793280	Which I kind of want to play.
9793280	9795280	Hold on. It's super good.
9795280	9797280	Sorry. Draw Slasher.
9797280	9799280	Soulcalibur Broken Destiny.
9799280	9801280	Zombie Tycoon 2.
9801280	9803280	Velocity Ultra.
9803280	9805280	Muramasa Rebirth.
9805280	9807280	Jak and Daxter. Dragon's Crown.
9807280	9809280	Kill... Dragon's Crown.
9809280	9811280	Tearaway. Batman. Arc and Origins.
9811280	9813280	Blackgate.
9813280	9815280	Final Fantasy X-2 HD.
9815280	9817280	Divekick.
9817280	9819280	A bunch of Oddworld stuff. Malicious Rebirth.
9819280	9821280	There's a bunch of good stuff on this list, but
9821280	9823280	I still don't think that... Ooh! There's an
9823280	9825280	Ys game on here too.
9825280	9827280	But I don't know
9827280	9829280	that it's going to be enough to really save it unless
9829280	9831280	they can
9831280	9833280	pull a miracle out of their ass.
9833280	9835280	Also, Skye, you have dabbled
9835280	9837280	with games from your...
9837280	9839280	Have you dabbled with games from your PlayStation Plus
9839280	9841280	collection? It seems a little unusual that you
9841280	9843280	haven't brought up games from Plus
9843280	9845280	that you haven't tried out before in
9845280	9847280	the How Was Your Gaming Week segments. I'm interested
9847280	9849280	to hear what you have to say on games like Disgaea
9849280	9851280	3, The Cave, Closure, and others. I did
9851280	9853280	buy Closure. Funny enough,
9853280	9855280	I have The Cave sitting on my PlayStation 3
9855280	9857280	ready to play. I just didn't get to it this week.
9857280	9859280	Because I had that other game to review.
9859280	9861280	Yes, I have been trying to grab some of them.
9861280	9863280	The Cave, specifically. I was
9863280	9865280	curious in checking out, so
9865280	9867280	hopefully next week. I did get
9867280	9869280	Closure, by the way, on Steam. I just haven't
9869280	9871280	played it yet. So many games,
9871280	9873280	so little time. But thank you for the
9873280	9875280	feedback on the Vita.
9875280	9877280	And we'll see what comes
9877280	9879280	at E3. I'm sure it's going to be a huge
9879280	9881280	thing as well. Okay, the end of this email.
9881280	9883280	I want some Pinkberry, the Nasty
9883280	9885280	Canasta. Who doesn't? I want some
9885280	9887280	Pinkberry. Okay,
9887280	9889280	this one's kind of long. Hello
9889280	9891280	OLR.
9891280	9893280	So, sorry, by the way, guys,
9893280	9895280	if I sound awful, I had an allergic
9895280	9897280	reaction earlier.
9897280	9899280	I got me a Wii U a couple weeks ago.
9899280	9901280	Basic set. I have been having
9901280	9903280	a somewhat good time with it. I'm already,
9903280	9905280	I've already,
9905280	9907280	I guess that should be got four games.
9907280	9909280	Super Mario Bros. U, Monster Hunter 3
9909280	9911280	Ultimate, Scribblenauts Unlimited, and
9911280	9913280	Justice Gods Among Us. Fun system that the
9913280	9915280	touchpad is taking a lot more
9915280	9917280	getting used to. I'll probably not
9917280	9919280	have, not be buying a lot of
9919280	9921280	non-exclusive games on the platform unless they've got
9921280	9923280	pro controller or classic controller support.
9923280	9925280	But it's proving to
9925280	9927280	be not the embarrassing waste of time
9927280	9929280	I thought it would be when the system came out.
9929280	9931280	I'm hoping and fully expecting the system
9931280	9933280	to become a worthwhile addition to the collection.
9933280	9935280	Speaking of, it seems that
9935280	9937280	Nintendo bullying out of the huge
9937280	9939280	dick-waving contest that is
9939280	9941280	the mega press conference. Oh,
9941280	9943280	bowing out, sorry.
9943280	9945280	Yeah, we covered that earlier.
9945280	9947280	Personally, I love the idea that Nintendo is ditching the traditional
9947280	9949280	conference this year in favor of targeted meetings.
9949280	9951280	The fewer charts I have to look at, the better.
9951280	9953280	However, it's sad that the gaming
9953280	9955280	media is quick to bash on Nintendo.
9955280	9957280	Not that I'm a huge Nintendo fanboy, but
9957280	9959280	I was always under the impression that we
9959280	9961280	won the games.
9961280	9963280	Sorry.
9963280	9965280	How much of it do you guys
9965280	9967280	feel it's just the people wanting to
9967280	9969280	shit on Nintendo because they're not the graphics
9969280	9971280	horror choice versus legitimate concerns about
9971280	9973280	the company? I think there's
9973280	9975280	a lot of bandwagon bashing, but
9975280	9977280	I
9977280	9979280	my thing with press conferences or release
9979280	9981280	of information, I don't give a shit how they
9981280	9983280	do it as long as they do something
9983280	9985280	and we find out what it is. I only care about the information.
9985280	9987280	I don't care how they put it out.
9987280	9989280	I just care that they do.
9989280	9991280	That's me.
9991280	9993280	I understand that in this cost-conscious
9993280	9995280	world we're living in, especially for
9995280	9997280	a company that hasn't necessarily been meeting
9997280	9999280	their goals, they want to scale
9999280	10001280	back on some of the pomp and circumstance,
10001280	10003280	especially when they always seem to get shit on for it.
10003280	10005280	So, you know,
10005280	10007280	why not change the game
10007280	10009280	at this point if you're them?
10009280	10011280	Anyway.
10011280	10013280	Back to the
10013280	10015280	I need to actually
10015280	10017280	pick this instead of email.
10017280	10019280	Lastly, my next
10019280	10021280	hardware purchase is coming around July
10021280	10023280	and that is the Retron 5.
10023280	10025280	I'm not sure about your thoughts on clone consoles,
10025280	10027280	but it sounds like they're going all out to ensure
10027280	10029280	maximum compatibility
10029280	10031280	and the 720p
10031280	10033280	upscaling, save states, and full button
10033280	10035280	customization for any controller you use on the thing.
10035280	10037280	That brings me to the question,
10037280	10039280	where do you guys stand on retro gaming?
10039280	10041280	Do you want all the modern
10041280	10043280	accoutrements that are offered by emulators
10043280	10045280	and will be offered by the Retron 5,
10045280	10047280	or are you guys intolerant of any deviation
10047280	10049280	from the original play limitations?
10049280	10051280	Me, I can go either way, though with
10051280	10053280	five cartridge ports, this thing is going to be
10053280	10055280	a sight more convenient than having my NES, NES,
10055280	10057280	Genesis all at once, and if only they can add in
10057280	10059280	support for Turbo Duo and Sega CD.
10059280	10061280	Anyway, that's it for the email. Thanks for reading.
10062280	10064280	This is my thought about it,
10064280	10066280	because given that I am in a position of both,
10066280	10068280	you did not put in the
10068280	10070280	do not give a shit category,
10070280	10072280	because it all depends on my mood.
10072280	10074280	It depends on how much I feel
10074280	10076280	like digging through boxes
10076280	10078280	to pull out one of the
10078280	10080280	Super Nintendos and plug it in
10080280	10082280	and then where to find our copy of
10082280	10084280	Chrono Trigger or Super Metroid
10084280	10086280	or, you know,
10086280	10088280	I prefer to play things
10088280	10090280	on the original console.
10090280	10093280	If I had the perfect vault,
10093280	10095280	if we had everything hooked back up again,
10095280	10097280	switch boxes and everything,
10097280	10099280	yeah, I would be totally playing it
10099280	10101280	on the original console,
10101280	10103280	because I can safely say I likely have
10103280	10105280	the original console.
10105280	10107280	But, if it's a quick thing,
10107280	10109280	or I want to play like a
10109280	10111280	Sega Densetsu 3, and there's an amazing
10111280	10113280	fan translation out, but I don't have a ROM
10113280	10115280	burner, then I'll play the emulator.
10115280	10117280	I'm not really picky.
10117280	10119280	If it's the only way I have to play it,
10120280	10122280	You have multiple Super Nintendos?
10122280	10124280	Do you not?
10124280	10126280	I still have none.
10126280	10128280	It's a shame that's carried out through my
10128280	10130280	adult life.
10130280	10132280	There's one over there in our house, too.
10132280	10134280	I saw it, and I was jealous.
10134280	10136280	No, we actually just bought
10136280	10138280	I think our fourth Super Nintendo,
10138280	10140280	or fourth or fifth,
10140280	10142280	because we found a box of games
10142280	10144280	and a SNES for 50 bucks
10144280	10146280	at Goodwill, and one of the games in there
10146280	10148280	was Pocky and Rocky 2,
10148280	10150280	which was unboxed
10150280	10152280	for about 150 bucks on eBay.
10152280	10154280	We're going to be selling it.
10154280	10156280	That's like that chick that found the
10156280	10158280	copy of Stadium Events at a thrift store
10158280	10160280	and she's making bank off it.
10160280	10162280	Just the whole reason is that
10162280	10164280	as much as we love the game, it's not going to be
10164280	10166280	one that we're going to play a lot.
10166280	10168280	If we're looking at the collection,
10168280	10170280	I'm almost always going to grab the Turbo Duo and play
10170280	10172280	Dracula X.
10172280	10174280	Which is the correct choice to make.
10174280	10176280	You know what I wish they would translate?
10176280	10178280	And like, Re-Burn on a CD is
10178280	10180280	well, Sapphire was a great game,
10180280	10182280	but Emerald Dragon
10182280	10184280	was an RPG
10184280	10186280	that came out on
10186280	10188280	PC Engine Duo.
10188280	10190280	You just named a game I've never played!
10190280	10192280	Holy shit!
10192280	10194280	Well, I've also played Panorama Cotton.
10194280	10196280	Okay, yeah, but I mean,
10196280	10198280	I don't unfortunately own a copy, but I have played it.
10198280	10200280	One of my friends that for a little while
10200280	10202280	worked for Ubisoft in Japan owns a copy.
10202280	10204280	She wouldn't lend it to me.
10204280	10206280	You're going to Japan? Let me borrow it!
10206280	10208280	Let me say this quickly about
10208280	10210280	the back to the email with the emulators and all that.
10210280	10212280	I really do like
10212280	10214280	the retro gaming
10214280	10216280	when it's done right.
10216280	10218280	Sometimes they're cheap cash-ins and you can tell.
10218280	10220280	I kind of wish companies in this day and age
10220280	10222280	would do more, especially because
10222280	10224280	we've shifted from
10224280	10226280	sitting next to each other in the same room
10226280	10228280	to a lot of internet play.
10228280	10230280	I've bitched about this on the show before.
10230280	10232280	Virtual Console would be ten times
10232280	10234280	better and more people would feel the enhanced
10234280	10236280	value if you could play it online.
10236280	10238280	If you could use that cam in your Wii U
10238280	10240280	optionally, to see your friend
10240280	10242280	while you're screwing him over in Ice Climber
10242280	10244280	or whatever it is you're playing.
10244280	10246280	Or a better game.
10246280	10248280	Like the Capcom Arcade
10248280	10250280	Cabinet Collection is actually pretty good,
10250280	10252280	because you can do the internet and all that.
10252280	10254280	I think the interface could be a heck of a lot better.
10254280	10256280	I really liked Game Room.
10256280	10258280	I really...
10258280	10260280	I loved Game Room.
10260280	10262280	It gave them that more time and nurtured it
10262280	10264280	just a little more.
10264280	10266280	I feel like Game Room could have been it.
10266280	10268280	And I'm really disappointed that they pulled the plug
10268280	10270280	as fast as they did on that.
10270280	10272280	I mean, maybe it just wasn't gaining the support.
10272280	10274280	I don't know, but maybe they just needed better games.
10274280	10276280	Some of the games they put out at the end
10276280	10278280	should have been out in the beginning.
10278280	10280280	Which they never did put out officially.
10280280	10282280	But if they've been sitting on Sunset Riders
10282280	10284280	the whole time, why didn't they put that out in the beginning
10284280	10286280	instead of some of the...
10286280	10288280	not that the 2600 games are bad, don't get me wrong.
10288280	10290280	It was really disappointing.
10290280	10292280	But, you know, like Virtual Console on 3DS
10292280	10294280	pretty rad that we can fire up
10294280	10296280	a two-player game.
10296280	10298280	Again, I'm going to use Ice Climber as an example.
10298280	10300280	But, you know, we can do that anywhere.
10300280	10302280	We could sit in the car and play
10302280	10304280	Ice Climber on 3DS.
10304280	10306280	Excuse me, versus,
10306280	10308280	thanks to Virtual Console.
10308280	10310280	I love that.
10310280	10312280	I would like to just see that pushed forward
10312280	10314280	a little faster, because the technology is
10314280	10316280	there to get it online and all that.
10316280	10318280	Anyhow, that's my thoughts.
10318280	10320280	We have another email.
10320280	10322280	Alright.
10322280	10324280	That was from RawStillUT.
10324280	10326280	The last email.
10326280	10328280	Howdy, y'all!
10328280	10330280	Howdy, y'all!
10330280	10332280	Howdy.
10332280	10334280	I was poking around in the Boston Red Sox
10334280	10336280	official store today and marveled at all the shit
10336280	10338280	you can buy there. Seriously, look it up.
10338280	10340280	There's an astounding variety of items
10340280	10342280	with the Boston Red Sox logo on it that you can waste
10342280	10344280	your money on.
10344280	10346280	Is there an equivalent store for WOW memorabilia?
10346280	10348280	eBay.
10348280	10350280	Is there a place online where I can
10350280	10352280	blow my money on a wide variety of WOW shit?
10352280	10354280	I mean, a sticker with your
10354280	10356280	flying mount on it is a no-brainer to me.
10356280	10358280	That thing you use
10358280	10360280	to get around in real life on the thing you use
10360280	10362280	to get around in the real world?
10362280	10364280	That would be awesome.
10364280	10366280	Stay black, redertainment trainer.
10368280	10370280	You know...
10370280	10372280	There's the Jinx store.
10372280	10374280	I think Geek has a lot of WOW stuff.
10374280	10376280	Yeah.
10376280	10378280	I don't know if there's a
10378280	10380280	Blizzard company store.
10380280	10382280	Jinx is kind of like one of their official
10382280	10384280	vendors.
10384280	10386280	They do a lot of that stuff.
10386280	10388280	They're always at BlizzCon.
10388280	10390280	That's like JYNX, right?
10390280	10392280	I believe so.
10392280	10394280	Like the drag queen?
10394280	10396280	Yeah, or like the Pokemon drag queen.
10396280	10398280	I was going to say too
10398280	10400280	that I think if you look on Etsy
10400280	10402280	there's a lot of fan-made
10402280	10404280	items that are really good.
10404280	10406280	And I know
10406280	10408280	that there are people
10408280	10410280	out there who will...
10410280	10412280	There's artists out there who will do commissioned
10412280	10414280	work of your character and your mount.
10414280	10416280	And she's talking to you right now.
10416280	10418280	But
10418280	10420280	it's possible. You can even make this stuff yourself.
10420280	10422280	It's not that hard.
10422280	10424280	There's a program that I was doing
10424280	10426280	a WOW comic in for a while.
10426280	10428280	It was like the World of Warcraft viewer.
10428280	10430280	Where it has all the mounts.
10430280	10432280	It has hidden stuff.
10432280	10434280	It has...
10434280	10436280	Oh, fuck what's dude's name at Icecrown.
10436280	10438280	Lich King?
10438280	10440280	The current Lich King.
10440280	10442280	Arthas? Or Bolvar?
10442280	10444280	Yeah. There's actually
10444280	10446280	a picture of him on fire.
10446280	10448280	Not standing on the throne.
10448280	10450280	He's just standing there on fire.
10450280	10452280	And he's called Lavaman.
10452280	10454280	You can have him.
10454280	10456280	You can have old, actual Warcraft things.
10456280	10458280	And the ability to make the stickers.
10458280	10460280	I was also going to suggest, honestly,
10460280	10462280	if your mall has a hot topic,
10462280	10464280	well, I see Warcraft shirts in there all the time.
10464280	10466280	But if you're wanting
10466280	10468280	props and things
10468280	10470280	or stuff to put on your wall,
10470280	10472280	check with cosplay
10472280	10474280	distributors.
10474280	10476280	Because you can get stuff there too.
10476280	10478280	I know people who make weapons.
10478280	10480280	Find a friend with a 3D printer and learn a CAD software.
10480280	10482280	Or what's that printer
10482280	10484280	that you've... It's like a couple grand
10484280	10486280	home 3D printer.
10486280	10488280	MakerBot? Yeah, MakerBot.
10488280	10490280	I think people have done
10490280	10492280	insignias and things for MakerBot.
10492280	10494280	You can also buy a monthly membership
10494280	10496280	to TechShop and use their fancy ones.
10496280	10498280	I think that, actually, the school I go to now
10498280	10500280	is going to be getting a 3D printer
10500280	10502280	in the next couple years.
10502280	10504280	For the art design lab.
10504280	10506280	Alright.
10506280	10508280	If that's it for the emails tonight.
10508280	10510280	Yes, indeed it is.
10510280	10512280	Let's go to the FUs of the week.
10512280	10514280	It's a chance for us to be angsty.
10514280	10516280	Because, you know, for
10516280	10518280	502 weeks now we've been carrying a little angst
10518280	10520280	on this show.
10534280	10536280	My FU goes to the pizza, actually.
10536280	10538280	To Papa Murphy's Pizza in general.
10538280	10540280	Because this is actually the third time
10540280	10542280	I've had an allergic reaction to Papa Murphy's Pizza.
10542280	10544280	And it's been a different kind of pizza
10544280	10546280	every time.
10546280	10548280	And, like, I'm talking about my tongue started to
10548280	10550280	swell, my throat itched.
10550280	10552280	I'm so sorry because it's so good.
10552280	10554280	I'm not complaining about how delicious
10554280	10556280	the pizza was, but
10556280	10558280	I was sitting here having... By the way, thank you for that.
10558280	10560280	I was sitting here, like,
10560280	10562280	literally having one of those,
10562280	10564280	like, weird
10564280	10566280	allergic reactions with the rash and everything.
10566280	10568280	And I'm like, oh my god. Well, thank god
10568280	10570280	Tim brings us drugs.
10570280	10572280	You're welcome.
10572280	10574280	But, I mean...
10574280	10576280	This is the third time
10576280	10578280	I've had pizza from Papa Murphy's in Reactiswood.
10578280	10580280	So, I don't think I'll be eating
10580280	10582280	here again.
10582280	10584280	Lucky.
10584280	10586280	Lucky, United States Postal Service for just
10586280	10588280	chilling on my package.
10588280	10590280	Instead of just, you know...
10590280	10592280	Usually that's what you want people to do.
10592280	10594280	No, you don't want them to
10594280	10596280	chill. You want them to fucking move around.
10596280	10598280	You want them to be
10598280	10600280	getting close to, you know,
10600280	10602280	delivering the package.
10604280	10606280	And said no.
10606280	10608280	They're just like...
10608280	10610280	You want them to make that delivery.
10610280	10612280	Exactly. Make the delivery.
10612280	10614280	Get moving!
10616280	10618280	I want my... Ooh, yeah!
10622280	10624280	FU did the crappy heat
10624280	10626280	here in Sacramento today.
10626280	10628280	Because I wanted to take my friends to the flea market.
10628280	10630280	But it was just too hot.
10630280	10632280	We'll go bargain hunting for
10632280	10634280	video games in October.
10634280	10636280	Exactly. With those two
10636280	10638280	Sega prototype systems.
10638280	10640280	They're going for like multi grand
10640280	10642280	on eBay. Bought for a dollar.
10642280	10644280	Yeah, I know, right?
10644280	10646280	Didn't they actually close down Auction Town?
10646280	10648280	Because that's where Trader Dan's was.
10648280	10650280	So, you're going to have a really hard time
10650280	10652280	finding the good game sales at the flea market.
10652280	10654280	I hope some of the flea market is still out.
10654280	10656280	I bet Trader Dan
10656280	10658280	started back up on eBay, though.
10658280	10660280	I would bet.
10660280	10662280	CaptainSpike, do you have any FUs of the week?
10664280	10666280	Tim, for
10666280	10668280	preferring Super Mario Bros. 3
10668280	10670280	to Super Mario World, and
10670280	10672280	RageQuitting on me when we played Super Mario World.
10672280	10674280	And you for making me play
10674280	10676280	Ice Climber.
10676280	10678280	Deal with it.
10678280	10680280	Alright, Tim,
10680280	10682280	do you have any FUs of the week?
10682280	10684280	I do. It was a related note.
10684280	10686280	Fuck you, Magikoopa.
10686280	10688280	I am done with your shit.
10688280	10690280	Fair enough.
10690280	10692280	Alright.
10692280	10694280	Let us
10694280	10696280	do a couple more stories
10696280	10698280	then we're going to open up the Skypline for a little bit.
10698280	10700280	We are running super long tonight, though.
10700280	10702280	So, I'm sorry. I might have to abbreviate
10702280	10704280	some of the end of the show here.
10704280	10706280	Let's at least get these new stories out of the way. Low key.
10706280	10708280	Okay, so the second round of auctions for THQ happened.
10708280	10710280	And some of your big franchises
10710280	10712280	have gone to, well, mainly Nordic Games.
10712280	10714280	They bought Darksiders and Red Faction.
10714280	10716280	And five of five games?
10716280	10718280	Guess what they get drawn to life.
10718280	10720280	So, yeah.
10720280	10722280	Gearbox actually got a hold
10722280	10724280	of the
10724280	10726280	Homeworld franchise.
10726280	10728280	The one that they were trying to
10728280	10730280	buy via crowdfunding.
10730280	10732280	And Nordic Games
10732280	10734280	actually has been working with THQ
10734280	10736280	for a while now.
10736280	10738280	Talking sequels and they're hopefully
10738280	10740280	going to get the same developers back on board.
10740280	10742280	Also, they purchased
10742280	10744280	MX vs ATV and Titan Quest
10744280	10746280	for the other two franchises they bought.
10746280	10748280	And then THQ sold all this money
10748280	10750280	to a lot of people.
10750280	10752280	Including Double Fine.
10752280	10754280	Codemasters for F1.
10754280	10756280	And
10756280	10758280	hell, they even own
10758280	10760280	Ruben
10760280	10762280	some money.
10762280	10764280	Different, I guess,
10764280	10766280	bonuses or whatever. Employee obligations,
10766280	10768280	they said.
10768280	10770280	One more
10770280	10772280	story for you guys tonight.
10772280	10774280	And I think this is very interesting. It's one of those things
10774280	10776280	I'm kind of surprised didn't happen sooner.
10776280	10778280	But, you know, lately
10778280	10780280	we've talked about a lot of crappy games.
10780280	10782280	Or, I shouldn't say that necessarily they're crappy
10782280	10784280	games, because there's still people that love them.
10784280	10786280	But, games that get a crappy
10786280	10788280	reputation based on the
10788280	10790280	internet. Games such as
10790280	10792280	Game City. Mass Effect 3
10792280	10794280	in the ending.
10794280	10796280	Aliens Colonial Marines. Duke Nukem Forever.
10796280	10798280	Well, you know what? Before all of that
10798280	10800280	there was ET, the
10800280	10802280	extraterrestrial on the Atari 2600.
10802280	10804280	But see,
10804280	10806280	when I was seven it wasn't as bad
10806280	10808280	as everyone made it out to be. But the most frustrating thing
10808280	10810280	was you always fell in the damn pit, right?
10810280	10812280	Well, here's the interesting thing.
10812280	10814280	A hacker went back
10814280	10816280	and fixed some of the problems people have
10816280	10818280	with the game. And now people are like
10818280	10820280	this game's not so bad. It's kind of fun.
10820280	10822280	So what were the things that were changed?
10822280	10824280	Well, for one, they made ET an actual
10824280	10826280	ET color instead of, you know,
10826280	10828280	that green. And most
10828280	10830280	importantly, they fixed the
10830280	10832280	falling in the pit all the time. Instead of one
10832280	10834280	pixel colliding with the pit, it's a different
10834280	10836280	collision detection, which makes it far
10836280	10838280	less frustrating. You're not always
10838280	10840280	falling in that stupid pit.
10840280	10842280	So, now just so you guys know
10842280	10844280	Howard Scott Warshaw made the original game
10844280	10846280	and he was really rushed
10846280	10848280	over time. As a lot of the movie tie-in games
10848280	10850280	were at the time, he only had
10850280	10852280	months to make it. Same thing happened with Pac-Man
10852280	10854280	and why that turned out so bad, too.
10854280	10856280	Isn't that funny? Pac-Man was awful.
10856280	10858280	Isn't that funny how some things never seem to change?
10858280	10860280	When it's rushed too much.
10860280	10862280	We would think we'd learn from history.
10862280	10864280	But anyway, yeah, so
10864280	10866280	according to
10866280	10868280	Warshaw himself, he said, I was either
10868280	10870280	the golden child selected to do the project or
10870280	10872280	I was the only one stupid enough to take on the challenge.
10872280	10874280	You know, he did Yars
10874280	10876280	Revenge too, which was a great, great game.
10876280	10878280	But anyway,
10878280	10880280	Neocomputer.org is
10880280	10882280	the one that made the project that
10882280	10884280	tried to fix some of E.T.'s problems.
10884280	10886280	And I believe
10886280	10888280	the project ended up getting
10888280	10890280	done by David Richardson
10890280	10892280	who goes by the handle recompile.
10892280	10894280	And that's pretty cool.
10894280	10896280	From Atari age. He single-handedly,
10896280	10898280	I guess, maybe this started the discussion
10898280	10900280	there, but he single-handedly ended up putting it together.
10900280	10902280	And fixed the well,
10902280	10904280	fixed the difficulty settings.
10904280	10906280	So, like, not every step
10906280	10908280	will drain your energy.
10908280	10910280	And some of this stuff. So, uh,
10910280	10912280	yeah, pretty cool. And it even, like, showed
10912280	10914280	tutorial videos and how they did it.
10914280	10916280	Yeah, and they even have, if you want to do the ROM hack yourself,
10916280	10918280	they give you the addresses and what the
10918280	10920280	change in the hex editor.
10920280	10922280	I bet somebody like you is like, well, I know you don't hack a lot of
10922280	10924280	Atari 2600, but this is still pretty fast.
10924280	10926280	The one that's already done. You can download the ROM, I think.
10926280	10928280	Yeah, yeah.
10928280	10930280	But very cool.
10930280	10932280	It's almost like how people
10932280	10934280	will hack SimCity to play offline.
10934280	10936280	Or fix, you know, alien colonial
10936280	10938280	marines. But, you know, some of the stuff in there.
10938280	10940280	It's just funny. Alright, so
10940280	10942280	there you go. That's it for the
10942280	10944280	official stories we have tonight. Let me know,
10944280	10946280	let me open up the Skype line.
10946280	10948280	1877 Game O-L-R, or our username on
10948280	10950280	Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one
10950280	10952280	word. If you want to go ahead and give us a call,
10952280	10954280	that would be awesome.
10954280	10956280	If you want to talk about something we talked about on the show
10956280	10958280	tonight, or something you think we missed, what you've
10958280	10960280	been playing, that's why you have a question for Captain Spike,
10960280	10962280	or Tim, and want to talk about
10962280	10964280	whatevers, give us a call.
10964280	10966280	Say hello. 1877 Game O-L-R,
10966280	10968280	our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10968280	10970280	Last minute stories, alright? So, in the
10970280	10972280	same vein of Metal Gear Solid,
10972280	10974280	and the sequels to that, and
10974280	10976280	going with different voice actors, the
10976280	10978280	next Arkham City game is
10978280	10980280	not going to have the same Batman
10980280	10982280	voice. They're going with someone younger.
10982280	10984280	Deal breaker. So, I have
10984280	10986280	Kevin Conroy will not be reprising Batman.
10986280	10988280	I've, and some
10988280	10990280	people are really frowning at the new Batman having
10990280	10992280	multiplayer. I don't think
10992280	10994280	that, again, I'm not going to throw the baby out with
10994280	10996280	the bathwater and say, Batman sucks because
10996280	10998280	they're adding multiplayer to it, because like Mass Effect
10998280	11000280	3, it was fine. I really love the multiplayer
11000280	11002280	Mass Effect 3. But I
11002280	11004280	understand where people have some great reservations,
11004280	11006280	especially hearing it's a new studio, and now all this
11006280	11008280	other, like, it kind of sounds like they're trying
11008280	11010280	to do this one on the cheap.
11010280	11012280	That is a big concern.
11012280	11014280	So,
11014280	11016280	you're agreeing with me over there, Spike?
11016280	11018280	I do agree.
11018280	11020280	Which is, because, Arkham
11020280	11022280	City is so fucking good.
11022280	11024280	Like, this next game,
11024280	11026280	to live up to that legacy, is really going to have to be
11026280	11028280	a step above that. When you hear things like this,
11028280	11030280	you kind of go, not sure
11030280	11032280	if, want?
11032280	11034280	We'll see. I'm sure E3 is going to answer
11034280	11036280	a lot of that. Anything else?
11036280	11038280	1877 Game O-L-R, or our username on Skype,
11038280	11040280	Orange Launch Radio, if you want to call. All one word.
11040280	11042280	Not really, but there's been some
11042280	11044280	Kickstarter projects I've been looking at, like, for example,
11044280	11046280	Anne, which is kind of a cross between
11046280	11048280	like, a Metroidvania game and
11048280	11050280	like, Gradius. So you get to fly around
11050280	11052280	the ship, and you get to also,
11052280	11054280	I guess it's more like Blaster Master.
11054280	11056280	You get to fly around a ship, or you get to go outside
11056280	11058280	on foot and stuff.
11058280	11060280	And it looks kind of cool.
11060280	11062280	Real quick, Tigerclaw in chat says,
11062280	11064280	the reason why the new Batman game has a younger
11064280	11066280	version actor is because the game takes place
11066280	11068280	years before Arkham Asylum. It's a prequel.
11068280	11070280	That's why they went with somebody younger.
11074280	11076280	That's an excuse.
11076280	11078280	He's a voice actor.
11078280	11080280	He's played younger Batman
11080280	11082280	in different, you know, animated series
11082280	11084280	and what have you. He's been doing this voice a long time.
11084280	11086280	He's very good. They also didn't hear
11086280	11088280	your mic off or something?
11088280	11090280	He's done a teenage
11090280	11092280	Bruce Wayne, and did a wonderfully
11092280	11094280	believable job.
11094280	11096280	Alright, we got a phone call here. Hi, you're on Orange
11096280	11098280	Radio. Who's this?
11098280	11100280	Dartitsouria. Hey, Dartitsouria.
11100280	11102280	What's up, buddy?
11102280	11104280	Hey.
11104280	11106280	Oh, not a whole lot.
11106280	11108280	I'm just, you know, hanging in there.
11108280	11110280	Well, what'd you want to
11110280	11112280	call us about tonight?
11112280	11114280	Well, I had a, uh,
11114280	11116280	hang on, let me mute my...
11116280	11118280	Are you here?
11118280	11120280	Did you forget to mute your radio before
11120280	11122280	you called in?
11122280	11124280	Yeah, I was trying to.
11124280	11126280	Sorry. No, I had a, uh,
11126280	11128280	so I have a
11128280	11130280	Steam key for La Mulana.
11130280	11132280	I want to donate to the show.
11132280	11134280	Heck yeah.
11134280	11136280	Wait, didn't
11136280	11138280	Dark Sakura have dibs on that?
11138280	11140280	Something? La Mulana on Steam?
11140280	11142280	Yeah.
11142280	11144280	Because I was like, if she ain't taking it,
11144280	11146280	I'm taking it. Shit, I want to play it.
11146280	11148280	I came super close to buying it until I remembered.
11148280	11150280	Oh, there you go.
11150280	11152280	Well, as much as I would love
11152280	11154280	to give a key away to the listener, uh,
11154280	11156280	to the listeners, um, I think we want to
11156280	11158280	kind of keep it for ourselves. Sorry, but
11158280	11160280	I want to play. Only because you rave about
11160280	11162280	it so much. Yeah. Do we want to play it for
11162280	11164280	ourselves?
11164280	11166280	Yeah. Why should we all be
11166280	11168280	playing La Mulana?
11170280	11172280	Well, it's a fun game.
11172280	11174280	It's like, like, you know,
11174280	11176280	those old school games were
11176280	11178280	tough, but, you know.
11178280	11180280	Yeah.
11180280	11182280	La Mulana, isn't La Mulana, like,
11182280	11184280	asshole Mario hard?
11184280	11186280	Uh,
11186280	11188280	it can be, but let's get the hang of it.
11188280	11190280	It's just, it's just memorizing
11190280	11192280	patterns, just like old MegaMakers. You know what?
11192280	11194280	I will be magnanimous
11194280	11196280	and donate
11196280	11198280	that code to you.
11198280	11200280	Yay!
11200280	11202280	Alright, uh,
11202280	11204280	Dark Tetsuya, I, I, I,
11204280	11206280	thank you very much for, for donating
11206280	11208280	the code to us and feeding our gaming
11208280	11210280	addiction further.
11210280	11212280	ActDeft in the chat room says, La
11212280	11214280	Mulana is your Mass Effect.
11214280	11216280	True? I bet he
11216280	11218280	doesn't have Turians. Yeah, I suppose so.
11218280	11220280	Alright.
11220280	11222280	Well, Dark Tetsuya, is there anything else you want to talk about,
11222280	11224280	talk, talk with us about tonight?
11224280	11226280	Uh,
11226280	11228280	just had a question.
11228280	11230280	Yeah.
11230280	11232280	So, um, so I was planning
11232280	11234280	on, uh, Best Gets 3. Yeah?
11234280	11236280	Right.
11236280	11238280	I kind of need, uh, Episode 169
11238280	11240280	to finish
11240280	11242280	working on it.
11242280	11244280	Oh, for, um,
11244280	11246280	uh, is this, this is the, um,
11246280	11248280	the, is this the DDR step file
11248280	11250280	stuff?
11250280	11252280	Oh, no, that's the, uh,
11252280	11254280	Best Hits compilation.
11254280	11256280	So, best hits. Oh!
11256280	11258280	So you, you need Episode 169?
11258280	11260280	You don't have that? I think he said 159.
11260280	11262280	Uh-uh. Alright,
11262280	11264280	we'll have to find it. If I don't have it,
11264280	11266280	then I'm sure Misty or Angel's got to have
11266280	11268280	it, or maybe somebody else has
11268280	11270280	a, I will look for it,
11270280	11272280	but there is an episode in the past
11272280	11274280	that is gone forever. There is a missing
11274280	11276280	episode that's completely gone, because
11276280	11278280	we weren't able to save it that night. And we were
11278280	11280280	too drunk to remember. There might actually be two.
11280280	11282280	So, there are a couple gaps
11282280	11284280	that you're going to find that, unfortunately,
11284280	11286280	they're gone forever.
11286280	11288280	Not a big deal.
11288280	11290280	Alright. Alright, well, Dark Tetsuya, we're going to let you go to get
11290280	11292280	more calls, but take care, okay?
11292280	11294280	Alright.
11294280	11296280	Sorry, he had some type of echo going on
11296280	11298280	in the background. It kind of made it hard for me
11298280	11300280	to hear. I think he didn't really mute the computer.
11300280	11302280	Or he had the TV on in the background.
11302280	11304280	He's trying to watch Chair of Swords.
11304280	11306280	And, uh... Damn that show.
11306280	11308280	Listen to us at the
11308280	11310280	same time. By the way, though, I did find a character
11310280	11312280	I like. Daenerys.
11312280	11314280	Because she sets people on fire.
11314280	11316280	And she inquires
11316280	11318280	about the location of her dragons.
11318280	11320280	1877 GameOLR
11320280	11322280	or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio
11322280	11324280	if you want to give us a call. Loki, can you talk again?
11324280	11326280	I'm talking.
11326280	11328280	And my mic is not working.
11328280	11330280	Why is your mic just suddenly stopped working?
11330280	11332280	That's weird. Because your board
11332280	11334280	is possessed. Maybe it just
11334280	11336280	needs to be dusted. It is kind of...
11336280	11338280	I wonder if our board might
11338280	11340280	just be... I mean, we've had that board
11340280	11342280	six years now.
11342280	11344280	It was a
11344280	11346280	damn expensive board. It should last.
11346280	11348280	I know. I'm just saying.
11348280	11350280	That's the reality. We might need something else.
11350280	11352280	Well, maybe it just needs to be cleaned out.
11352280	11354280	The contacts need to be...
11354280	11356280	We'll work on it. Live Radio.
11356280	11358280	Ain't it a blast? Because we didn't learn
11358280	11360280	that we were going to have audio problems
11360280	11362280	until, like, Bobby's
11362280	11364280	call tonight. Yeah, really, right?
11364280	11366280	Alright. I'm going to
11366280	11368280	just leave it open a little longer for another call.
11368280	11370280	1877 GameOLR or our username on Skype,
11370280	11372280	OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us
11372280	11374280	a call. I'm going to quickly try
11374280	11376280	to comb the Twitter topics at Twitter.com
11376280	11378280	slash O-L-R.
11378280	11380280	TigerClaw is sending us a tweet.
11380280	11382280	Eve Online getting a TV show based
11382280	11384280	on real player stories.
11384280	11386280	Hmm, isn't that kind of like what Defiance is
11386280	11388280	doing? But yeah, Eve Online
11388280	11390280	of course is an MMO that's been around for a
11390280	11392280	while. It's that whole
11392280	11394280	space one. Isn't that the one where
11394280	11396280	they had all that loot of
11396280	11398280	game time cards that were
11398280	11400280	on a ship and the ship exploded and it's like
11400280	11402280	all that money is just gone?
11402280	11404280	So yeah, Eve Online going to get a TV
11404280	11406280	show based on the stories in game. That's pretty cool.
11406280	11408280	Can you imagine if they turned
11408280	11410280	fanfic into TV shows? Because that's
11410280	11412280	essentially what they're saying here. Oh no, they did it.
11412280	11414280	Well, I don't know.
11414280	11416280	They did it for Mass Effect with the Citadel DLC.
11416280	11418280	I was going to say
11418280	11420280	that. Except for
11420280	11422280	creepy Shega.
11422280	11424280	Yeah, that really upset me.
11424280	11426280	That was so date rapey. Oh my god.
11426280	11428280	I felt dirty watching
11428280	11430280	it on YouTube.
11430280	11432280	Just
11432280	11434280	filthy.
11434280	11436280	Let's see, also at Twitter.com
11436280	11438280	slash O-L-R
11438280	11440280	a tweet from
11440280	11442280	ActDeaf. The third Skullgirls
11442280	11444280	DLC character voting has ended.
11444280	11446280	The fans chose Eliza, an
11446280	11448280	Egyptian based character.
11448280	11450280	You know, Skullgirls is pretty tight with the
11450280	11452280	Brony community. I'm not surprised
11452280	11454280	that ActDeaf's reporting on this. That's a
11454280	11456280	big thing I see on my Tumblr page a lot
11456280	11458280	actually. Brony? No, Skullgirls.
11458280	11460280	Oh, Skullgirls? Yeah. Well. There's a
11460280	11462280	big stint of Skullgirls stuff for a while.
11462280	11464280	That was a great alliance that they made.
11464280	11466280	Let's be real. So,
11466280	11468280	that's Twitter topics. Twitter.com slash
11468280	11470280	O-L-R.
11470280	11472280	Nobody's calling.
11472280	11474280	Nobody wants to say hi. How sad.
11474280	11476280	Come on, call us.
11476280	11478280	We won't yell at you much.
11478280	11480280	Fifth Dream in Chats is that's who they voted
11480280	11482280	for.
11482280	11484280	So, River City Ransom 2 is supposed to be getting
11484280	11486280	a Kickstarter. Oh, wait. Here.
11486280	11488280	Wait, no. She read that during the
11488280	11490280	rapid fire news. Yeah. I just want to remind
11490280	11492280	everybody to kickstart it when it actually
11492280	11494280	comes online. But it's not the real thing.
11494280	11496280	Who cares?
11496280	11498280	It has to be Kunio where it's nothing
11498280	11500280	else. Also, My Sleep looks awesome.
11500280	11502280	I kickstarted that one.
11502280	11504280	Among the Sleep, it's the one where it's a
11504280	11506280	survivor horror. The horror game
11506280	11508280	where you play as a two year old. From the
11508280	11510280	perspective of a two year old. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
11510280	11512280	I would play the hell out of that. Kickstarting
11512280	11514280	right now. They need money. You know what?
11514280	11516280	I actually found a Kickstarter since
11516280	11518280	we don't have the one yet for Understanding
11518280	11520280	Video Games. I'm actually
11520280	11522280	except I think it's already over was contributing
11522280	11524280	to a Dr. Demento album.
11524280	11526280	Like another big compilation
11526280	11528280	in honor of Dr. Demento's birthday.
11528280	11530280	I thought it only had like two days left on it
11530280	11532280	a couple days ago. But I love
11532280	11534280	Dr. Demento. So, whatever.
11536280	11538280	Alright. Well, our listeners are being
11538280	11540280	shy tonight. Oh, come on. Give them one more chance.
11540280	11542280	Alright, one more chance. I'll leave it open a little
11542280	11544280	bit longer here.
11544280	11546280	Oh, I didn't do
11546280	11548280	Thank you. This is how we can fill time.
11548280	11550280	Listless results.
11550280	11552280	Thank you. Yeah, I did.
11552280	11554280	I wasn't paying attention.
11554280	11556280	Everybody's out of it tonight. These sound
11556280	11558280	problems just snowballed
11558280	11560280	into LOL. Alright, let's go over
11560280	11562280	listless results tonight.
11564280	11566280	You know why I didn't do listless results? Because in my
11566280	11568280	head, I already know. I already tabulated them up.
11568280	11570280	Alright, here we go. We don't live in your
11570280	11572280	head, thank God. Here it is. The
11572280	11574280	definitive list as voted on by the listeners.
11574280	11576280	Mascot, we are going to donate to
11576280	11578280	Sega in a close fourth
11578280	11580280	place, worth mentioning. Master
11580280	11582280	System, the Sega robot. In a very close
11582280	11584280	fourth place. Yay. In third
11584280	11586280	honestly, the way the listeners
11586280	11588280	voted tonight is really perfect, I've got to
11588280	11590280	say. So, I cannot argue with
11590280	11592280	this at all. Number three.
11592280	11594280	The number three answer for Mascot, we
11594280	11596280	will donate to Sega. An amalgamation
11596280	11598280	of all of Sonic's shitty friends.
11598280	11600280	It's the one I would have voted
11600280	11602280	for. There it is, number three.
11602280	11604280	Number two,
11604280	11606280	as voted by the listeners.
11606280	11608280	President Cat. Yay.
11608280	11610280	Fair enough, fair enough. We love you, Reena.
11610280	11612280	And the number one
11612280	11614280	answer of Mascot, we
11614280	11616280	will, and I don't know how we're going to do this,
11616280	11618280	maybe I can get somebody to put together a little
11618280	11620280	clip art, something for us. We can actually send this
11620280	11622280	to Sega, like a nice little envelope.
11622280	11624280	The number one answer that we
11624280	11626280	will gift on behalf of OLR,
11626280	11628280	a forklift, ladies
11628280	11630280	and gentlemen, a forklift.
11632280	11634280	I approve. Does the
11634280	11636280	forklift have a name? A forklift one out of
11636280	11638280	all the crazy things Rob would have had to dress up in?
11638280	11640280	Really? And Loki.
11640280	11642280	Forky.
11642280	11644280	Forky the Forklift.
11644280	11646280	You know what? Can't
11646280	11648280	I'll draw it. Can't the name be Q-Q-Q-Q
11648280	11650280	so it's 4Q the Forklift?
11650280	11652280	Oh my god,
11652280	11654280	that's great.
11654280	11656280	4Q the Forklift. And then he comes
11656280	11658280	into that song.
11658280	11660280	No, that's Taku.
11660280	11662280	Alright, there it is,
11662280	11664280	your winner of the list tonight. Don't give that
11664280	11666280	disapproving
11666280	11668280	It's funny and you know it.
11668280	11670280	It's my default look.
11670280	11672280	You're so mean.
11672280	11674280	Sometimes
11674280	11676280	I wish it were a TV show. DungeonBuster wants
11676280	11678280	to see the forklift fight the Daytona
11678280	11680280	car. I don't know, the forklift
11680280	11682280	would fight dirty.
11682280	11684280	It would just get under the car and flip it.
11684280	11686280	But the Daytona
11686280	11688280	car has the power of AM2 behind it.
11690280	11692280	Perfect Q-Q-Q-Q.
11692280	11694280	Alright, again, the Skypline
11694280	11696280	not lighting up. What's up with y'all?
11696280	11698280	So I'm gonna close it. Sorry
11698280	11700280	maybe Skype screwed up.
11700280	11702280	Everything else is screwed up on tonight's show. Why not
11702280	11704280	Skype? Alright. Well
11704280	11706280	that is about gonna wrap it up for another episode
11706280	11708280	of Orange Lawns Radio. But before we go around and get
11708280	11710280	all the final thoughts tonight, I really want to thank our guests
11710280	11712280	for being here tonight. Tim,
11712280	11714280	I'm glad we could pop your podcast cherry.
11714280	11716280	I'm glad
11716280	11718280	to have you do it.
11718280	11720280	And I'm glad that you liked my gift.
11720280	11722280	Yes, thank you very much.
11722280	11724280	I'm gonna slap you when we get home tonight.
11724280	11726280	Whoa.
11726280	11728280	Isn't that a little TMI?
11728280	11730280	Come on you guys.
11730280	11732280	But good luck with
11732280	11734280	whatever it is you guys are working on next.
11734280	11736280	And thanks for talking about
11736280	11738280	how you got into gaming and all that stuff with us tonight.
11738280	11740280	Sure, it was my pleasure.
11740280	11742280	Do you have any questions on Twitter or anything you might
11742280	11744280	if listeners want to follow you further or whatever?
11744280	11746280	Sure, TimTRP
11746280	11748280	at Twitter.
11748280	11750280	I'm sort of TimTRP at everything because I have no
11750280	11752280	imagination.
11752280	11754280	If you have any more questions for me or questions about
11754280	11756280	getting into the game industry or whatever, I'm happy
11756280	11758280	to talk to you about it.
11758280	11760280	Alright, awesome. I'll be sure to give you my resume.
11760280	11762280	CaptainSpike
11762280	11764280	it's about fucking time you came back to the show.
11764280	11766280	Thanks for being here. I literally haven't seen you
11766280	11768280	in years. Even if you are so mean to me
11768280	11770280	all of the time. But that's alright.
11770280	11772280	I am mean to you all the time.
11772280	11774280	It's like my second favorite thing to do.
11774280	11776280	But it comes out of a place of love, or at least
11776280	11778280	it better.
11778280	11780280	Okay, we can go with that.
11780280	11782280	You dick. Alright.
11782280	11784280	Gamebuoy.org if they want to hear
11784280	11786280	your own show.
11786280	11788280	Which I take back every nice thing I said about it
11788280	11790280	earlier in the show.
11790280	11792280	It's terribly unlikely given how big of a dick I've been
11792280	11794280	tonight. But on the off chance
11794280	11796280	anyone does care
11796280	11798280	Gamebuoy.org
11798280	11800280	Gaming news and views that aren't on your radar
11800280	11802280	but maybe should be. We'd really
11802280	11804280	appreciate the hits. And I just
11804280	11806280	want to say so much. Thank all three of you
11806280	11808280	so much for having me here tonight. It's actually
11808280	11810280	been quite a bit of fun and I really
11810280	11812280	do wish it hadn't been like seven years since
11812280	11814280	the last time I was on. Well, make
11814280	11816280	better and come back on a more regular basis
11816280	11818280	at some point. I would love to.
11818280	11820280	Fantastic. Love it. Alright.
11820280	11822280	Well, we're going to go around
11822280	11824280	and get everybody's final thoughts so we can close up
11824280	11826280	shop tonight. Um, Loki
11826280	11828280	who doesn't have a microphone. Loki, do you
11828280	11830280	have a final thought tonight? I wish my microphone
11830280	11832280	worked.
11832280	11834280	Fair enough. Uh, Dark Soccer, your final
11834280	11836280	thought tonight. My throat feels like a desert.
11836280	11838280	Uh, and my final thought
11838280	11840280	tonight is Haters to the left.
11840280	11842280	Uh.
11842280	11844280	Captain
11844280	11846280	Spike, your final thought tonight.
11848280	11850280	I hate you so much.
11850280	11852280	And last but not
11852280	11854280	least, Tim, your final thought tonight.
11854280	11856280	Um,
11856280	11858280	I just ate some potato chips that taste
11858280	11860280	like they're Doritos and they taste
11860280	11862280	like Doritos
11862280	11864280	tacos and in the computer science
11864280	11866280	world we call that recursion.
11866280	11868280	Recursive
11868280	11870280	chips. Love
11870280	11872280	it. Thank you guys so much for downloading
11872280	11874280	and listening to our show or listening to it live or however
11874280	11876280	you participate. Thank you for being a part of
11876280	11878280	Orange Lounge Radio. If you like what you heard,
11878280	11880280	all we ask is tell a friend or two about
11880280	11882280	the show because we don't have, you know, $35,000
11882280	11884280	to promote our show. No tea, no
11884280	11886280	shade. All tea, all shade. Shade that wave.
11886280	11888280	I'm totally judging right now.
11888280	11890280	Uh, but, uh, we would really appreciate it.
