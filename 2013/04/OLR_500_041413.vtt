Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight April 14th, 2013

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
Could Capcom be ending HD fighting game remakes?

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Level 5 is set to work on a Playstation 4 game

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
And could one government be investigating in-app sales?

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:35.000
We are live!

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
And welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

00:40.000 --> 00:47.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio for tonight episode number 500

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
For this April the 14th of 2013

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
My name is Rob Roberts

00:53.000 --> 01:00.000
And I'm here with you every week for this very long, long, long time with my co-host

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
Say hello first off to the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Hi

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
How are you Jamie?

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
I'm caffeinated now, now I can start drinking

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
You've had coffee

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Now bring on the booze

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Bring on the booze

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Bring it on

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
I brought a bottle of pre-made mimosa

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Nice

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
What is pre-made mimosa?

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
It means that you don't have to buy orange juice and champagne separately

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
How lazy are you?

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
They did that shit for you

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
I did something called saving time, space, and money

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
By just bringing it already done

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Because, fuck it

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
It's booze, it drinks the same way

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
Speaking of fuck it, I decided to mark the occasion tonight

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
I'm gonna wear my pajama pants

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
I'm gonna take a picture of Rob

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
With all these little lips all over them that say kiss me

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
Because I'm wearing my pajamas to OLR tonight

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Rob wants his pants kissed

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
I give no fucks

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Happy 500th episode

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
I think you gave the last fuck last episode

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
So we're fresh out of fucks, sorry

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
Alright, say hello

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
Say hello to Techmaster Loki

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Hello

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
How are you Loki?

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
I wish these fries were better

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
I'd throw them all away because they're crap

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
You went to McDonald's, duh

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
It's a crap shoot, I know

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
I wasn't that hungry so I expected them to suck

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
I just wanted to be pleasantly surprised that they were good

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
But they were not

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
Is that the tragedy that has followed you for 11 years here on this program?

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
Yeah, it's just, it's a

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
The problem is that I was very indecisive on what I wanted to eat

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
So, it was kind of like, you know

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
First I started driving towards Jack in the Box

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
And I'm like, eh, I'm not that hungry

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Don't judge me

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
I'm not hungry enough for Jack in the Box

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
So then I went to McDonald's

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
I'm like, oh but I really want Subway

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
But it's across the street

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
So I'm like, eh, I'll just eat McDonald's

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Because I need to get gas

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
Okay, so thanks to Alan for distracting things

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Sorry, Loki

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
But while Loki was talking

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Alan came over here and dropped on the table

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
I got this bag of the chicken and waffles Lay's

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
Because I knew Jamie has it

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Actually, Alan got it

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
I have had them

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Oh, you have had them?

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
They're pretty good

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
They're fairly amazing until you get halfway down through the bag

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
And then I was like, what the fuck am I eating?

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
Brad from Pod Culture said they were the worst absolute things in the world

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
They're amazing, I love them

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
I don't think they're the best potato chips I've ever had

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
But they're not bad

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
The cheesy garlic bread ones though are pretty epic

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Are they?

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
They are quite epic

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
Whoever came up with that little contest at Lay's, genius

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
Here we are talking about food yet again

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Why break tradition, folks?

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Duh

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Why break tradition, folks?

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
I'd rather just have a waffle

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Alright

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Dude, waffles would be awesome right now

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
We do have a special guest here joining us tonight

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
Say hello to Becky

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Greetings

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
How are you, Becky?

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
I'm doing pretty well, thanks

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Welcome back

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Now Becky, for those that don't know, is Jamie's BFF

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
And so Jamie sometimes talks about her on the show

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
And she's also quite the chef

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
And so Becky was kind enough to actually cook

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Here we go with food again on a video game show

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Was kind enough to cook for us tonight

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
What did you make for us tonight, Becky?

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
I made red velvet brownies

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
And they look like murder

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
They are beautiful, glorious, dripping red

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Hope y'all don't see the food boner in my jammies right now

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
Cause

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
I'm gonna go take pictures

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
That sounds pretty epic

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Of the food boner?

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
No comment

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Alright

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
The always present fourth guest on our show

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
I know we have a fourth guest in the studio

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
But also always with us as you guys have been

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
And we would not have made it to 500 episodes without you guys

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Let's be real

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Hello everybody in our chat room

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
What the hell comment do I start with tonight?

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
How about Mako Chan?

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Starts us off tonight saying

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
Murder is pretty fucking tasty

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
It would be awesome if you drew like super meat boy on those

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Because that would be

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
That's perfect

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
That's it, Becky, we have to do this again next weekend

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
So what's going on, live listeners?

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Is the stream not work-

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
I guess a lot of people are bitching that the stream is like

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Stopping going tonight or something

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
So I don't know what's up with that

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
We're not doing anything different

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
I can do it

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
There's too many of you listening

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
That's what's happening

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Bite your tongue

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
Alright, we do tape live every Wednesday

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
Every Wednesday when I'm not here

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
What fucking show is having a birthday today, Rob?

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
We do tape live every Sunday at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
At the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
And thanks to all you guys who do turn out live

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
Or who do listen to us in the podcast

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Speaking of Vognetwork

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Are the brownies like really, really good?

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Alright, I'm about to eat one

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Okay, I want to try one in a minute

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
But I have to talk about Vognetwork things

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Because this is really exciting

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Fine, you can talk and we'll eat

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Fine, sounds good, alright

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
So

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
I think I need new pants

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Last week on the show

05:58.000 --> 06:04.000
I complained that I wanted the Vognetwork website to have something

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
And that was the ability to have instant polls

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
So we could go and actually ask the listeners questions

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
And actually poll them instantly

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
Well, Bobby Black Wolf, in celebration of our 500th episode

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
Has made that a reality

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
So for all you guys that are right there on live.vognetwork.com

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Because it's the only place you're going to see it

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
So if you're tuned into IRC via MIRC or something

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
Make sure you bring up live.vognetwork.com

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
You don't need to refresh the page or anything like that

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
This is going to happen automatically

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
But it is time

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
For the very first time

06:38.000 --> 06:43.000
We are going to go to our live audience poll

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Dork

06:47.000 --> 06:52.000
Alright, tonight in the very first Vognetwork live poll

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
We are going to settle the great debate once and for all

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Because we have to start with an epic question

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
So here it is

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Tonight's question

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
Let us settle the great debate once and for all

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Cake or pie?

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
Let us settle the great debate once and for all

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
Cake or pie?

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
There it is up there at live.vognetwork.com

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
You can participate right now and vote in the poll

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
And look at this

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
How cool is this

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
We see the results live as they come in

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
It's all tied up right now

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Oh, cake just pulled ahead a little bit

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
This is the most amazing thing ever

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Bobby is a genius

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
He's great

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Alright, so there it is

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Let us settle the great debate once and for all

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Cake or pie?

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
We will read the results here momentarily

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
But it does look like cake is quite a bit ahead here in the live poll

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Alright

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Moving on

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
What else do I want to talk about tonight?

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
We have the new feature that I want to talk about

07:51.000 --> 07:57.000
Anything you guys want to say in acknowledgement of our 500th episode?

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
What the fuck are we doing?

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Look at your life

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Look at your choices

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Well said

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
I'm going to go drink now

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
I want to drink too

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
That poll is going to be too distracting

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Because it's just

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
I have to keep watching it change

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
I know right

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
It's, it's, it's

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Hypnotic

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
It's hypnotic to watch

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Alright

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
That's awesome

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
Yeah, I love how it lives up

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
We are going to be required now

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
They'll use that sound clip though

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Every time we do an instant poll

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
That was the plan

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Oh sweet

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
So

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
Do brownies count as cake?

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
That's a good question

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Maybe I should have added brownies to the list

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
Oh well

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
But what does ice cream cake count as?

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
I guess cake

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
It's not real cake

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
But what about pudding filled cake?

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Like Boston cream pie

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
It's called a pie but it really has cake bits

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Okay, you're making it too fucking complicated lady

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
So

08:49.000 --> 08:54.000
I didn't see Boston cream pie as one of the options of cake versus pie so

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Uh oh, here go hell come

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
So

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
And of course how thoughtful

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Oh hi Alan

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Hi

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
What did you just set down in front of me here in studio?

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Take a whiff of it, smell it

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Oh god

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
Oh my god it's that stuff I can't have

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
I'm getting drunk just smelling it

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
It has to smell how awful it is

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
You want to smell it?

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
This is a present from Brad from Pod Culture

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Our pals

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Thank god it smells more like whiskey than it does like cinnamon

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Um

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Do you want to smell it at all?

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
Alright

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Uh, Alan do you want to introduce the drink?

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
Yes it's fireball whiskey

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
The bottle art is amazing

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
And we don't have anything for a chaser really

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
So I got you a glass of water

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Apple juice I think would have been really good

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
But we don't have any so

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
I forgot to make apple pie

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
We poll

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
Um

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Chase it with a brownie

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Alright so uh

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
You have to chase it with a brownie

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
I'll chase it with a brownie but here's the thing

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
When was the last time we did drinking on OLR?

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
It was a very long time ago

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
I don't know but I remember one time I ate half a box of waffles

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
If I didn't have to take my son to uh

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
You know to school every morning

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
I would have totally you know

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
I know

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Crashed but um

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
I forgot to take tomorrow off work

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
I remember when uh you had the uh tequila binge

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
That was kind of hilarious

10:06.000 --> 10:07.000
I don't drink tequila

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
You did once

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
No I didn't

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Or was it vodka?

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
It's always vodka

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
I could swear it was tequila but okay

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
Remember he married a Russian chick

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
It's always vodka right?

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
And

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
She doesn't drink anything

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
She likes rum

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
Are you ready to launch into your gaming week if Rob ends up in a coughing fit after he does the shot?

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
Get the first news story ready

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
I'm ready

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
Um

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
Don't we have a disclaimer we usually give during drinking shows?

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Um

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Don't drink and drive

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
I live here so I can drink

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Um

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Don't be irresponsible

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Uh

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
And keep it in your pants

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Yeah

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
Drink moderately

10:41.000 --> 10:47.000
Don't come up with you know next gen game console ideas after you know consuming vast quantities of alcohol

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
Okay so here's my cheers to all you non drinkers

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
Can you toast me with something?

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
I'm gonna go make me a coffee

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
Alright yay cheers 500 yay

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
One

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Two

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
Three

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Hi Rob

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
I wish you guys could see the look on his face he's like gone immediately for the water

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
Wow

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
This is fantastic radio

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Poor Rob your face is red

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
500 episodes I do what I want

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
I'm gonna go make my mimosa after I do my week

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Oh my god

11:29.000 --> 11:35.000
Brad thank you for the bottle of Fireball because this is so worth it right now

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
The webcam's at my house I've been using it to stream drawing

11:40.000 --> 11:45.000
Loki is there anything you wanted to say in memory of our in celebration of our 500th episode?

11:46.000 --> 11:52.000
No not really I don't have anything I want to say

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Technically Rob just had a double

11:54.000 --> 12:01.000
Just that I wish that the wife was capable of taking the son to school so then I could partake but yeah

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
I said I cannot

12:04.000 --> 12:11.000
Alright I just really want to thank everybody for you know supporting our show and being here

12:11.000 --> 12:18.000
And you know it would have been great to do like a giant convention for our 500th episode and just have you all in one room

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
But you know money

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
My apartment ain't that big

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Exactly exactly

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
We're happy to just have you all here and chat with us

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
I do want to acknowledge this as well because this is like the most awesome thing that ever awesomed

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
This is something that one of our listeners Code Man

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
I need to take a picture of that too

12:34.000 --> 12:39.000
Who would you who has a who has a YouTube channel and I'm a horrible person because I can't remember the name of it right now

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
But hopefully somebody will dig it up and post it in chat

12:41.000 --> 12:45.000
But Code Man is a graphic artist like Dark Sakura

12:45.000 --> 12:50.000
But he designed this really amazing poster to commemorate our 500th episode

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
And Jamie's going to put a picture of it right now at orange-radio.com

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
Yeah I might start reposting stuff just to tell him because it will take less time

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
I believe his channel is Ratchet 1785

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
Thank you you're very Tiger Claw tonight I love it

13:02.000 --> 13:06.000
Alright so it's a poster to commemorate our 500th episode

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
What's awesome about this is that he's drawn us as these little chibi characters

13:10.000 --> 13:14.000
And Dark Sakura is like an N7 trooper, she's basically femshep

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
Loki is Grand Theft Auto and he's got a bloody baseball bat

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
And I'm World of Warcraft and look guys look

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
I'm flaming there with my hand

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
And we have a ferret with dynamite strapped to him

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
But you know what I really love about this is that if you look at the background

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
He layered a bunch of listener names in the background

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
I don't know where he got this list of names because I recognize old and new names in there

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
Like I look at this list and I go okay Jim Sally of course I know who he is

13:39.000 --> 13:44.000
But then I'm like Roboboy430 I haven't seen that name in years

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
So I think he did like a combination of people from like

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
The wiki as well as people he's seen in our chatroom and so forth

13:51.000 --> 13:55.000
So you guys are all a part of this poster as well which I think is just amazing

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
He should sell prints of it I really wouldn't care and I think he'd make some good money

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
So I bet a lot of you guys would like that

14:01.000 --> 14:07.000
Alright so oh Tigerclaw found it it's C Taylor 1785

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Thank you Codeman he also does

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
Oh you know what he co-hosts a show called Down for Maintenance I should plug that

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
And it has very good artwork go figure

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
So thank you Codeman for that

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
Should we go to the results of our poll?

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
Sure by the way some of the photos are already up they're just being slow

14:23.000 --> 14:24.000
Okay

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
At the very top of OrangeDawnsRadio.com

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
Alright here it is the results of our poll we're gonna go ahead and end it now

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
So if you didn't get in too bad

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
The results of the poll was

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Cake 1

14:35.000 --> 14:41.000
And cake was 62.86% to pie 37.14%

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
You all pissed me off

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Alright

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
Just kidding

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
Alright I'm finally gonna eat one of these brownies I think it's about

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
I think it's about time to get into our gaming week

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
So DarkSakura how was your gaming week?

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
My gaming week was semi-productive

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
I really didn't play like a whole lot of stuff

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
But I did play some more drunken robot pornography

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
That game is so fun I swear

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
Okay everybody in the world by now should know how much I love Jumping Flash

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
It's Jumping Flash with guns and giant robots

15:11.000 --> 15:17.000
And really really good music the game is crack I cannot wait for more of it to come out

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
I also played something that I'm not allowed to talk about

15:20.000 --> 15:25.000
So I'm not gonna except I will totally leave one game for this one

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
That's all I can say

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
Oh yeah I played Minecraft I actually streamed me playing Minecraft so I could show off my house

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
Or I should say my underground bunker

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
So that I can hide from everybody else no one can find my house

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
You've been getting really into this streaming thing lately

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
I've more or less just wanted to get it to work

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
Because Dan and I have a plan

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
I'll go ahead and do like a semi-announcement

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
Dan and I have a plan to start doing classic gaming stuff on Twitch TV

15:57.000 --> 16:01.000
And I'm trying to decide if Twitch or livestream works better

16:01.000 --> 16:06.000
But we want to eventually get it to where we can run our capture card into

16:06.000 --> 16:11.000
Well we get a capture card to run the video game systems through the PC

16:11.000 --> 16:16.000
And then have everything run off of the main monitor while we

16:16.000 --> 16:20.000
Sorry the liquor is starting to hit me so if I start smiling for no reason just ignore it

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
I was like Rob I'm feeling good

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
By the way I like never drink anymore so the fact that I had that is

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
I have no tolerance I have the alcohol tolerance of a

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Oh Jaylinx you are hilarious

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Of a child

16:35.000 --> 16:40.000
But yeah so I've just been practicing like with different things

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
Like lately I've just been streaming playing Mass Effect 2

16:44.000 --> 16:49.000
Because there's a couple people who watched it who just completely skipped it and are playing 3

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
So like no no no fixing this

16:51.000 --> 16:56.000
And then I was playing Drunken Robot Pornography and I've been doing some drawing you know

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
I tested out the webcam with it but I don't know if I'm going to keep doing webcam stuff

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
Now I don't know if you heard Cyl on Horde House this week which we all love Cyl

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
I love Cyl

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
She's the best but she was talking about some of her experiences in livestreaming

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
And how you know because she has the webcam on her and she's very resilient

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
And able to do that because she gets all these trolls coming in there going you know take your top off

17:15.000 --> 17:20.000
Will you do you know will you make out with a German chick will you do mouth to ass

17:20.000 --> 17:25.000
Will you do so yeah have you put your mug out there

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
No

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
Okay you probably don't want to

17:28.000 --> 17:32.000
I had it pointing at a piece of paper

17:32.000 --> 17:36.000
Don't take that the wrong way you're a very pretty lady and I don't think you give yourself enough credit

17:36.000 --> 17:42.000
But there's just too many people on the internet that are crazy horny

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
Yeah they're crazy horny

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
Well fortunately none of them are my problem

17:50.000 --> 17:56.000
But thank you Jason I will look into the black magic capture card

17:56.000 --> 18:03.000
But no I was just practicing you know doing stuff and trying out different things

18:03.000 --> 18:08.000
Because I think that what we're going to do is we're also going to maybe try to start bringing up you know

18:08.000 --> 18:13.000
Stuff that's actually in our collection like lovely pajamas Rob

18:13.000 --> 18:19.000
Like we have a whole lot of deluxe editions of games like for example the cyber bots limited edition

18:19.000 --> 18:25.000
And that stupid card capture soccer game that I had to have and played once it came with a damn pillowcase

18:25.000 --> 18:35.000
But we're just really wanting to and part of it is to we might actually be selling off part of the collection

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Legasp

18:37.000 --> 18:44.000
Legasp I'm talking about like the stuff that we actually don't play which you know would probably be the Neo Geo CD and the Intellivision

18:44.000 --> 18:57.000
That's probably about it but yeah I still haven't decided what I'm going to use the rest of it for right now until we get this officially started

18:57.000 --> 19:04.000
But Dan and I have been in the works talking about doing something like that for Twitch just because you know we're inspired by like classic game room

19:04.000 --> 19:09.000
And the angry video game nerd which I just think that guy is absolutely hilarious

19:09.000 --> 19:14.000
It didn't make our show roll tonight but I heard something about he's getting his own game or something or was it a movie or a game or what?

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
He did a movie already

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
He did a movie already because they had a kickstarter for the movie and it was so dumb but it was great

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
Yeah the movie looked ridiculous

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
The movie was absolutely ridiculous but it was hilarious too

19:23.000 --> 19:29.000
Okay I just want to point out when Becky just took that brownie she left these in the shape of a dick

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
Did you notice that?

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
You were so perverted because I was thinking they were in the shape of a T

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
No those are balls and that's the shaft

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
I have never seen a dick that read before

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
That is a letter T

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
You would have to do this to make it a cup

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Now it's balls

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
That is a cross because this show needs Jesus right now

19:49.000 --> 19:54.000
You know what? You know who needs Jesus Rob?

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
Sorry did I offend the Jew? My bad

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
You didn't offend the Jew

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Now try harder

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
The atheist is here

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
The atheist is here

20:07.000 --> 20:14.000
Well then let me just call Justin Bieber because then maybe Justin Bieber can really offend you

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
You know Rob I'm so disappointed

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
You're such a heathen

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
No I don't know I don't care

20:23.000 --> 20:27.000
I'll eat a ball

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
Best nuts ever

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
You don't even want to see the disgusting thing I saw today by the way

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
Anything else you want to say about your gaming week?

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
While you chow down on those balls?

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
Tasty balls

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Alright I'm done

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Alright Becky

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
Oh yeah I played well

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
Okay now I'm done

20:45.000 --> 20:51.000
Okay Becky I know you don't play a whole lot of games but I think Dark Sakura got you into a game recently right?

20:52.000 --> 20:58.000
God she got me into Mass Effect and it has sucked away my whole damn life

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
True

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
One of us one of us

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
You're welcome

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
Alright femshep or mailshep?

21:05.000 --> 21:10.000
Femshep I have done a broshep I call it broshep because mailshep sounds weird

21:10.000 --> 21:16.000
But I did a playthrough just because it was the only way I could romance Jack

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Fair enough fair enough

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
I don't get why Jack wasn't a crazy lesbian hookup

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
I don't get it either

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
Doesn't make any sense

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
I would have gone for it

21:26.000 --> 21:30.000
Who is your romance of choice? Because I know and I think it's a good one

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
Who is your romance of choice?

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
Thane

21:32.000 --> 21:38.000
Now Thane kind of they really screwed with him in Mass Effect 3 by you know spoilers killing him off

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
The game is a year old now right?

21:40.000 --> 21:46.000
But they tried to make things right with the Citadel DLC were you happy with what they did?

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
I was very happy with it because it never actually bothered me that he died

21:50.000 --> 21:54.000
I mean he had a terminal illness if he hadn't died I would have found it stupid

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
I like that they let him die

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
It was realistic

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
In a heroic kind of way

21:59.000 --> 22:05.000
What pissed me off was that nobody said they were sorry for your loss if you romanced him

22:05.000 --> 22:12.000
I mean Garris is there at the memorial wall standing right in front of his name and doesn't say a word about it

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
And that was the part that pissed me off

22:14.000 --> 22:18.000
So actually getting to have a memorial service made me very happy

22:18.000 --> 22:24.000
Yeah and I have to admit I did watch the whole thing on YouTube and watching the videos

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Because there's an extra video

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Because you find out that Thane

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
This really isn't that bad of a spoiler you guys

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
You find out that Thane made all these videos

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
Well he said he did

22:33.000 --> 22:38.000
Yeah and no matter if you romance him or not you get to see most of the videos

22:38.000 --> 22:41.000
But if you romance him there's an extra video you get to see it

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
I have to admit I got a little choked up

22:43.000 --> 22:49.000
And what especially got me was the goodbye scene at the very end when they're all getting back on the ship

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
I was like

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
The feels, the feels

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
I cried like a little girl

22:55.000 --> 23:00.000
I copied off Becky's save files from her Xbox so that I could mod her Shepard

23:00.000 --> 23:08.000
And so I played through all of the memorial and everything with her Shepard

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
Which it's always very weird playing somebody else's Shepard

23:11.000 --> 23:16.000
But yeah I actually had to go get tissues and cuddle the cat for a little while

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Because like ehhh

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
Technus in our chat room says

23:20.000 --> 23:24.000
I think Jack being either bi or a lesbian would have been kind of cliche IMO

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
But Breakman corrects and says

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
It is part of Jack's backstory

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
She was in a relationship with a man and a woman

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
And that's again live.vognetwork.com

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
And Extover says

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
There goes any interest I had in playing the game too

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Oh shush

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
Shush ya haters

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
Alright

23:43.000 --> 23:47.000
Any other games that you've been into besides space operas

23:47.000 --> 23:51.000
I've been adventure time

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
They do have adventure time DS games

23:54.000 --> 23:59.000
Watching my son play a lot of adventure time and screaming at the computer

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
Is kind of adorable to watch an almost six year old going

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
Stupid computer stop that

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
You're not supposed to do that

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
It's so cute

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
It's so interesting watching kids now

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
When like you know back in my day

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
When I was six we had Commodore 64

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
And that was cutting edge

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
But now you know

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
Wow you had Commodore 64 when you were six

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
You're such a baby

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
Becky had to play with sticks

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
Alright

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
Assuming there's nothing else for Becky's gaming week

24:39.000 --> 24:40.000
Let me go over to Loki

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Loki how was your gaming week?

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000
I played

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
Let's see

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Lots of Saints Row of the Third actually

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
We've been trying to go through and 100%

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
100% almost everything

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
I guess it would be 98%

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
Because I don't want to play all the co-op stuff

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
I don't really want to play through the game for like a fourth time

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
It would just be so annoying

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
So I finished up the DLC stuff

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
I'm actually finishing up right now

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
The Gangstas in Space DLC

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
Which is alright

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
It's like the first DLC really sucked

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
And the other two were okay

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
They weren't necessarily like

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
I mean they were still kind of side missions

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
But they at least dressed them up a little bit more

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
And they're just so short

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
They're like three missions long

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
And that's it

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
It's like ten minute missions

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
And thirty minutes for like seven bucks initially

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Kind of a rip off

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
So whatever

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
So I'm playing The Room

25:35.000 --> 25:39.000
And hopefully I'll be done with it pretty soon

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
I'll finish the game and get all my achievements on Steam

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
And move on to something else

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
They have been playing Defiance

25:47.000 --> 25:48.000
More of that

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
And actually still don't really know too much about

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
What's going on in the world

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
It's hard for me to follow

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
But the game is very similar to Borderlands

25:57.000 --> 26:01.000
For example if you take a franchise you love

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
And then you think

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
Oh hey look there's a sci-fi rip off of that franchise

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
That's what Defiance is for Borderlands

26:07.000 --> 26:10.000
It's basically a sci-fi rip off of Borderlands

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
And they've got all these different weapons

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
That you can use and stuff

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
And it's not necessarily that you specialize in anything

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
But the more you use a weapon

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
The better

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Well eventually it gets better

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
And the more you use a weapon

26:24.000 --> 26:25.000
The better

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Well eventually it gets better

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
And then

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
They have the different elemental stuff

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
And it's kind of hard to get good weapons in the game

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
I've found so far

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
Unless I'm not doing something right

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
But they have these lock boxes

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
That you basically scavenge parts

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
From killing people

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
Or taking weapons that you find

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
In loot and breaking them down into parts

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
And then you use those parts to buy keys

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
And then using those keys

26:51.000 --> 26:55.000
You buy these random loot chests I guess

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
That have two random weapons

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
Which for my so far

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
Doing tier two and tier three chests

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
They've all sucked

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
So

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
That's kind of lame

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
You were telling me about the TV show beforehand

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
And Tigerclaw is saying some stuff in our chatroom about that

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
Did you watch the TV show?

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
I haven't watched the TV show

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
I don't even know if it's on yet

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
But one thing I did know

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
Strudels89 in our chatroom says I think it airs in a week or so

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
I think it's coming soon

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
Monday

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
I think it's this week

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
Either Monday or Tuesday

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
I think it's airing

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
But here's the thing

27:29.000 --> 27:33.000
They are trying so hard to almost be like a Battlestar Galactica

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
Or something like that

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
Like I was mentioning they have their own lingo

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
Or their own slang I guess

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
To be fair it's by the creators of Battlestar Galactica

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
Okay so

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
That is quite fair

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
So at least they're ripping themselves off

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
Yes they're ripping themselves off

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
But they're kind of forcing it a little bit

27:47.000 --> 27:51.000
Because you know in Battlestar Galactica one of the most recognizable things

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
Is the use of the word frack instead of fuck

27:53.000 --> 27:57.000
Well now they're trying to do the same type of thing for Defiance

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
Except they're kind of taking it even further

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
They have two words

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
Shtaco is one of them

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
Which is I guess equatable to shit

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
And so they say that a lot in the show

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
They're just like

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
What you're trying to be a fucking Battlestar Galactica

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
I mean seriously what's going on here

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
But anyways the game itself

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
It's kind of fun

28:16.000 --> 28:20.000
I like the fact that you can kind of just run around and do whatever

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
I've been playing solo through the whole thing

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
But there's

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
The way it kind of works is if you happen to go into an area

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Say you're doing a mission or something like that

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
And you're going into an area and someone else is also there doing a mission as well

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
You kind of get credit for it if you go and help them and stuff

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
So you can almost like

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
It's almost like partying but not

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
But you can actually party in the game I just don't

28:41.000 --> 28:44.000
And then these arc fall things that happen

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
Which are a little repetitive but

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
They're pretty hard

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
And you have like you know

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
30 or 40 people just

28:51.000 --> 28:54.000
Trying to take down like a massive alien or something

28:54.000 --> 28:58.000
And that's kind of fun you get a lot of experience doing that

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
But basically I mean the whole like

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Look of the game is very bland

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
I guess like I don't recognize

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
It's not like this is supposed to be San Francisco

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
And driving around I couldn't tell you

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Like

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
I don't see any landmarks that I recognize

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Well it's the future

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Well it's the future

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Nuclear war and all that you know it changes things

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
It's just it's kind of bland

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
But here's the thing who cares if it looks bland

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
It's fun I'm having fun with it so

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
Yeah

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
And I have not paid any money for

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
Because you can pay money to get a lot of things in the game

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Not necessarily anything that's going to help

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
I mean you can buy I guess you know

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Tokens that give you more experience

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Like go up your experience by 10% or something like that

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
Or money drops or weapon drops

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
And that kind of thing

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Or they will have like you know customizable things

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
To make your character look

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Because right now my character looks like a 50 year old

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Trying to look like a teenager

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
And it looks stupid

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
But I don't care because I don't really look at my avatar that much

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
He's facing the other way

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
But I swear to god there's like no customization

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
As far as how they look

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
They all look like some weird fucked up person

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
But that's fine

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Because you can get a suit that covers their face up

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
And you'll ever see them again

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
I'm kind of surprised at all the hate for

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Battlestar Galactica in our chat room

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
5th Dream in our chat says

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
70's Battlestar Galactica is only Battlestar Galactica

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Brad from Pod Cultures asked

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
Good Battlestar Galactica

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Remake Battlestar Galactica

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
I like the new Battlestar Galactica an awful lot

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
I guess I'm just crazy

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
But yeah it's fun

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
I just wish more people play

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
The only person I know that plays the game

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Other than me on 360

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
I have a friend I met a long time ago

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Matt who works at

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Zappos actually

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Oh rad the shoe plays

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
He was one of the line directors

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
There so

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
He plays

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
I friended him on Xbox a while ago

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
That's the only guy I know that plays that game

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
I think it's fun

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Buy to play

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
There's no monthly fees

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
If you're running into Xbox

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Outages like we had this week

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
You know it's not a big deal

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Because hey I can just play later on

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
And that's kind of the thing I like about it

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
And the other thing I saw that was kind of cool

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
They have a lot of these

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Different things just like in Borderlands

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
How you do different things like kill

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Kill people in an assault rifle

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Go to these places

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Do this type of mission or something like that

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
And once you complete

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
All these challenges or whatever you experience

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Well they have it broken up

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Season 1 is all these

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Different challenges so they're going to have different challenges

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
For the next season and I think actually

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
The whole game is going to change for season 2

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
So whatever happens on the show

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
Is going to reflect in the game and vice versa

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Like if

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
I don't really know if there's any competing factions

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Or anything right now but if they have something like that

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
It may reflect on the show

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
So it's interesting so far

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
I think

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
So I'm going to play a little more of that

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
And then the other thing I played that I really probably shouldn't be playing

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Because it's

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
I think piracy

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
I mean we shouldn't really talk about it

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
Shame on you

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
Whatever I'm buying the game when it comes out anyways

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
But I wanted to play it early so that's

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
As long as you're going to buy it

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
I'm going to buy it so

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
The gameplay was Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
It's fucking awesome

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Is that the Xbox Live one?

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
It's Xbox Live

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
PlayStation Network and Steam

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
It's going to be amazing

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
It's 15 bucks when it comes out on the first

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
It's going to be fantastic

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
It got leaked out earlier this week

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Because of some hack on Uplay and stuff

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
So I had to try because I watch all the trailers

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
I watch gameplay footage and I'm like I gotta play this game

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
And it's just

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
It's so awesome

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
This is basically a developer making a game

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
They're like okay you guys make a game that's fun

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
That you guys want to play

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
It's just so fucking

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Why aren't all video games?

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
It's just so cheesy though

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Shouldn't that be the mindset that goes into any game?

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
But it's just so cheesy

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
It's basically this cliche

33:00.000 --> 33:04.000
B science fiction type plot

33:04.000 --> 33:08.000
That takes place in the year 2007

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
And it's

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
A lot of the details they have

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
First off they kind of poke fun at themselves

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
With the whole tutorial thing

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Basically you drop down

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
To invade this base

33:20.000 --> 33:24.000
And your partner

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
He kind of trolls you

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
By enabling this tutorial mode

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
In your suit

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
And so through the entire tutorial

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Which is giving you stupid commands

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
And just breaking it down

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Jumping allows you to

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Change your orientation

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Along the Z axis

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Weird stuff like that

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
So he's just like I hate these tutorials

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
This is stupid I just want to kill somebody

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
It's kind of funny

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
And then there was also

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Like a part where that guy is

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Hacking this missile guidance system

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
Thing and all the jargon

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
He's throwing out

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
I'm hacking the motherboard

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
I'm doing this to this

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
It's just all completely

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Obviously made up jargon

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
It's just hilarious though

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
And then they reference stuff that no one has any idea

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
What they're talking about

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
It's just like that time in South America

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Yeah and then they go in there

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
And then also

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
I like how his partner

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Uses the phrase

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Motherfucker a lot

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Because he's the cliche

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Black action hero guy

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Like we're gonna get those motherfuckers

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
You know

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
It's just awesome

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Is Samuel L. Jackson voicing him?

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
I'm imagining those words coming out

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
Like if it was a comic panel in the same font

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
As I'm gonna get you sucka

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Pretty much like that

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
And here's the best part about it

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
All just like old PC

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Animated cutscenes like they're all static

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
Images that they're moving around and stuff like that

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
It looks just like an old NES game or something

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Seriously it is an awesome

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
If you like Far Cry

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
Pick it up it's like 15 bucks it's great

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
The island's still pretty big

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
They have blood dragons

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Which are cybernetic like

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
Dinosaur things that shoot lasers out of their eyes

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
And they're cyber panthers

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Cyber panthers

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
I want a cyber panther

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Yes I don't

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
I don't normally condone piracy but

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
This is a game that I was gonna pick up anyway

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
You just couldn't wait

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
I couldn't wait

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
I was already planning on

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
Picking it up on Xbox Live or Steam

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Because I'm multi platform for some reason

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
You just gotta have achievements

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
I do

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
Anything else for your gaming week?

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
That's it

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
My gaming week pretty quick

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Not a whole lot of new stuff

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
That freaking addicting

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Jetpack joyride

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
If you're still listening you suck for getting me addicted to that

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Also World of Warcraft

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Been working on PVP

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
My character's level 65 now

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
I did try some new IOS

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
Games this week I wanted to plug real quick

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Talk about a couple of them

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
I know some people don't really consider the iPhone

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Games actual games

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
But whatever deal

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
I'd like to see them play through

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
Escabagaluda

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
These games are not quite as tricky as Escabagaluda

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
But I want to talk about them anyway

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
To be fair I've been playing them on my iPad 3

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Which is the new iPad

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
But not the newest iPad

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
The first one is called

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Puzzle and Dragons

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
Which apparently is a big hit over in Japan

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
Yeah I was about to say

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
Isn't that like a rehash of the old

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
Yeah it's partially a puzzle game

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Mixed with Pokemon

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
It's an interesting little puzzler

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
And it has Pokemon elements in it

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
Where you can kind of combine

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
Which is funny because the combining elements

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Was very similar to what I saw in that card game

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
Guardian Cross

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
From Square Enix that I got into

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
A couple of weeks ago

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Overall Puzzle and Dragons

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
I didn't really care for it

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
The puzzle mechanic part of it

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
I didn't think was very good

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Because you touch to move things

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
And line them up in 3's

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
And that doesn't attack

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
But you can literally move them anywhere

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
And you end up building up combos

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
And things like that to ultimately be able to take out enemies

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
But the challenge really wasn't there

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
And it felt like a bit of a grind

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Fest and I just wasn't a fan

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
I would have to see it because I remember something about it being

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Related to the

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
What was that game?

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
I actually did it as a classic game ages ago

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
The Puzzle and Desu

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
Oh yeah yeah yeah

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Because that's where I heard about it

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
Because somebody was comparing the two

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
It could be but I didn't play the other one

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
So I couldn't tell you

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Overall Puzzle and Dragons

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
It entertained me for a couple of evenings

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
But I'm kind of already over it

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
The puzzle mechanic isn't enough

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
To keep me interested in it

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
I'm sorry to say

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
I also checked out Nimble Quest

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Which if you guys know Nimble Bit

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
They made Tiny Tower and Pocket Planes

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Which you know hello crack

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
But this new game is actually nothing like those games

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
It still has the whole 8 bit feel

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
But they basically created a new version

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Of Snake and they are not

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
They even say in the tutorial

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Remember this game and they show the little cell phone

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Picture of Snake and

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
That's basically what they've created but what you do

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
Is that instead of picking up

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Squares that make your Snake longer

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
You pick up more heroes

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
And some will throw fireballs, some use swords

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Some have bombs

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
You know and that's kind of the gist to it

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
And the other guys

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
Running around might try to attack you

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
So it's all about maneuvering

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Not running into yourself

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
And kind of being in the right place

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
To use different attacks

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
It's very addicting

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
How long will it take Zinga to steal it?

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
I'm sure they've already worked on it

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
They're already working on it right now

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
So you know it's also free to play

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
So you can download it for free

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
You level up your characters

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
And they can get stronger but of course

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
If you spend real money you can level them up real fast

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
That's kind of the catch

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
But overall I liked Nimble Quest quite a bit

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
The only thing I didn't like about it

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Is that you go through the same

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Levels over and over again

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
You start at level one

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
It's like you're going through the same levels over and over again

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Which you know is fine that's how a video game works

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
But in a game like this you would

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Sort of think at some point

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
I can either branch and go to different

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
Stages or I can resume

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
Where I died or something a little

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
Different I was a little disappointed

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
That that basic mechanic wasn't somehow

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
Improved on

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
The last game that I checked out this week

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Which actually is probably my favorite of the three

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Is not free to play it's a 99 cent game

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
It's called Slayin

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
And this game is really cute it's very 8-bit

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
Style and it's retro-tasticness

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
But um

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Basically it's just got left arrow right arrow

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
And button and you move left move right

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
And jump and your character is a little

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
8-bit knight that constantly has a sword

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
Out in front of it and you can either move left

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Or right and you're killing little

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
Slimes or you can jump in the air

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
And hit little flying skulls

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
And as I talk about it

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
It sounds like super basic but it's really

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Addicting and the graphics are

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
Part of the charm the music

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
Is part of the charm I like how at the

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
End of the level you can upgrade weapons

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
And it even integrates

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Game center where you can kind of see the tombstones

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
Of your friends where they died and so

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
Forth so I thought that was kind of

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Cool so I

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Yeah I like that one that was my favorite of the three

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
Is Slayin so out of

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
Those three that's the one I recommend but go figure

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
That's the only one that's not free but it's only 99 cents

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
So

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Rastielutianchat asks

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Why the hell does no one ever do 16-bit

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Retro?

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
You see it once in a while

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
To the moon? Yeah

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
I would say maybe even Slayer

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Looks a little more 16-bit

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
Than 8-bit it's somewhere in between

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
It's like a 12-bit

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
Like a turbo graphics game

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
Or something it's kind of a little bit in between

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
It's two 8-bit processors together

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
So there you go

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
That was really my gaming week just a bunch of iOS games

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
But you know that's one of the places people

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
Play games on now

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
To be honest that's where I'm doing a lot of

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
My handheld gaming I haven't touched

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
My DS and

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
Except when I cleaned it

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
Actually the last handheld system I played was a Winter Swan

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Well I still have been playing Harmonite

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
But I talked about that last week already and of course

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Swap Note but I'll talk about that later in the show

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
And you know there's still other three

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
I even booted up Kid Icarus 3D classics

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
The other day just because I love

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
Kid Icarus and the 3D remakes

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Surprisingly good because they

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Didn't change much besides

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
The backgrounds and

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
Giving it some 3D effects so it's really

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
Good so

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
Anyhow let's get into

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Tonight's news

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Yes we're going to do news tonight just like we always do

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
So let's have Loki start us off

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Alright so

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
EA has

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Let some people go and of course

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
They're not going to say who or

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
Why or where but they

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
Basically

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Had layoffs and they're

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
Not seeing which teams they're coming from and that kind of sucks

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
But isn't some of that leaking out to the internet anyway?

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Who it is?

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Yeah I believe it was EA Montreal if I remember correctly

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
It was supposed to be

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
I think some of the people

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
That are affected by it

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Yeah EA Mobile Montreal

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
So

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
I don't know

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
And they're saying that I guess

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
60 to 70 permanent employees

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Were let go and I guess another

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
100 people working under contract

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
Were let go as well

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
Mostly QA testers

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
So

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
I don't know

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
It's just kind of a normal cycle because after all

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
EA did have a bunch of games

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
Just come out recently and like you know

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
Three

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
I want to say like three or four games

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Yeah four games

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
I want to say that they just had Tiger Woods

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Army had two

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Dead Space 3 and

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
Crysis 3 so

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
It might just be that they're

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
You know

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
They're just slowing down right now

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
And so they don't need people because the only other game they have coming out right now

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Is Fuse and then NCAA

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
Yeah but we're on the cusp of the new E3

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
And who knows what's being developed

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
For next gen systems

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
Battlefield

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
My guess is a lot of Bioware people

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
They've already ruined the IPs now it's time for the

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
Layoff phase

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
Another game coming out?

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
It's Mobile

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Montreal

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
I don't know what exactly EA Mobile Montreal

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
Was doing

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Facebook games

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Bioware is working on at least

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
The Don't Call It Mass Effect 4 game

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
The Dragon

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
E3 and the Unknown

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
Game that the old Mass Effect

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
Team is doing because they are not doing Mass Effect 4

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
The multiplayer team is doing it

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
So we'll see

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Probably at E3 get some more information about that

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
Yeah because EA

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Montreal

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
Well Montreal is

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Army at two

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
But that would be just EA Montreal

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Not necessarily Mobile Montreal

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
What else have they worked on?

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
As long as our friends

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
Here locally at Bioware Sacramento

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Are okay but I think they're doing a lot of

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
What were they before?

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
ClickNation

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
They do a lot of Facebook

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
They had a really popular Facebook game

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
That's why they got grabbed up

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
So I'm sure any Dragon Age

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
Mass Effect kind of like Facebook tie-ins

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Or something they were probably working on

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
I don't know I've applied for them three times and they haven't hired me

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
Aw poor thing

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
Sorry Loki anything else?

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Yes and unsurprisingly

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
In a row they have been voted the worst company

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
In America by Consumerist

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
Which is you know a poll

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
That they have on a website that people vote

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
That are consumers that visit the website

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
It is completely

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
Well all the nominations

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
Are done by people that review the website

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
And then they take the top 16

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
Or so nominations I think it's more than 16

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
32 and then they

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Narrow it down from there

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
And this really seems to carry a lot more weight

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Than it ought to like a lot of people

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
I see a lot of people that are pissed

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
Like why did EA

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Win this when Bank of America

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
Is a far more evil company

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
When Comcast is more evil

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
It's an anti-popularity contest

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
It's not even that it's just like

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
Bank of America was one of the I think even they went up against Bank of America

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
And it's just people voted

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
Maybe Bank of America is just not

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
That much in the forefront for some of these people

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
It's a fucking internet poll

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
Like do we give this much

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
Weight to something that's on Yahoo.com

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
I sure hope not

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
Like I don't

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
That's my thing like the results

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
It's like who's line is it anyway

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
The score doesn't matter

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
My vote for internet's

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Worst poll goes to consumerist

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
Worst company in America

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
Oh you should be

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
We're analysts we can say this

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
I could run a poll right now

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
On the site who runs the worst poll

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
About the worst poll in America

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
Consumerist or somebody else

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
I won't right now

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
I have to save that for special

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
SSJ 100 Matt calls it an ass hattery contest

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
Whatever it's just a contest

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
It's just haha lols

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
That you know they won again

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
Because haha you screwed up all this SimCity stuff

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
And we hate you because of your DRM

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
And your policies regarding

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
Cashing in

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
Microtransactions and all that stuff

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
Haha see we showed it

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
We showed you

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
That's kind of what it is

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
I didn't log on to Mass Effect for a month

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
So I voted them the worst

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
Shadow Next Gen

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
Shadow Next Gen says in our chat room

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
Anyone who voted EA as the worst company

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
Should have their gaming rights rescinded

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
And be banned from the industry

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
Look people are welcome to their opinion as far as I'm concerned

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
But I'm just kind of like

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
You know

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
I tend to think

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
There are far bigger problems

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
Than you know EA

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
As a gamer do I like a lot of the things

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
That NCA has brought to the table? Hell no

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
And do I think they've deflected an awful lot

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
Of the blame? Hell yes

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
And have they made a lot of bad decisions

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
And possibly deserve to be having the lower financial

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
Quarter because of it? Yes

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Do I think people should be losing their jobs?

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
No

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
But it's not those people's fault

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
It's the fault of? Who is it?

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
Management

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
So what management got laid off

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
As a part of this?

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
That's what we really should be

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
You got me

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
They did lose the CEO and that sadly

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
Or fortunately depending on which side you're on

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
Is the person that needed to take the fall

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
So we'll see if things get better

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
But if you know

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
If last year was any sort of

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
You know

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Barometer of whether things are getting better

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
Nope

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
Besides how many years is it going to take

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
Before SimCity stops working

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
When they shut up those servers

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
DarkTetsuya in our chat room says

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
I do give EA credit for their pro

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
LGBT stance

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
And I do love Need for Speed

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
They blame that as one of the reasons they got voted

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
You know

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
It's a tricky

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
I appreciate the fact that

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
Peter Moore did come out and say

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
If that's the reason you're going to name us the worst

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Company in America then by golly

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
We're the worst company in America

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
I appreciate that he said that but at the same time

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
I'm kind of like

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
But like

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
How do you focus on the real reasons you're getting

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
Voted for this

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Like a lot of that is feeling like smoke

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
And mirrors and whether you deserve it or not

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
It's falling on deaf ears

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
It seems to me and that doesn't

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
Make it very promising

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
That you're going to change anything

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
I honestly would have put more of the crappy

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
If I was going just on video game companies

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
I would have put more crap on Activision

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
I think

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
Or maybe Capcom

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
I don't know

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
EA is the company that designed the whole

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
Online pass phenomenon

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
That we see nowadays

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
EA was also one of the first companies to

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
Hey you know those games that you had cheats in before

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
In Playstation 2 where you just enter

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
A little button press and you get those cheats

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
Yeah you can buy those now

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
And even in fact I remember

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
Is the first Godfather game they had

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
On Playstation 2 and Xbox

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
Where they didn't have such a way to purchase those

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Bits of DLC

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
They actually had button presses to do those cheats

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
On the 360

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
That's going to cost some money

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
So yeah so they can go fuck themselves

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
Origin is just the thing that pisses me on

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Origin is the worst part of it

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
Hey but Rob

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
There's 45 million people on Origin

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
How many satisfied customers

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
How many people on Origin

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
Because the game they wanted to play

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Was only through Origin

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
If I could disable that shit I would

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
To be fair

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
And I have to say this I have to acknowledge it

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
Nobody liked Steam when it first came out

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
And it's great now but I just

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
To me there's a difference

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
I'm kind of like Valve fixing it

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
Yeah I kind of see that out of them

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
But EA fixing it I'm like I don't know if they're ever

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
Going to

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
I think that Steam though had it right from the get go

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
That you know let's put out games and put them out

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
At affordable prices

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
Get people interested in franchises do big sales

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
And EA's like oh that's not any way to make money

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
And look where they are

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Hi

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
Alright well let's move on to one of those companies

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
That Dark Soccer has said you know they're not doing

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
Much better and that's Capcom

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
And Capcom had something interesting to say

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
This week where

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
Capcom Senior Vice President

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
Christian Svensson said on the

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
Ask Capcom forums

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
Quote, sadly I think we've probably

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
Run the course of feasible titles here

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Given the drop off we've seen in sales

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
With each new introduction

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
That's in regards to HD ports and

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
Remakes of fighting games

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
That's a lot of games to be honest

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
Well

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
No they could really dig back

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
In the archive do like the Mega Man fighting

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
Games and

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
Capcom vs SNK

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
Although I guess that's coming out on the

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
Playstation 2 or whatever

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
It's going to be an old hit or whatever

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
Just how bad is it?

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
They've come out and said

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
That the Dark Stalkers resurrection

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
Sales are not good

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
Dark Stalkers

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
The Dark Stalkers resurrection didn't even place

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
On the list of best selling Playstation Network

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
Games

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
In further comments Christian Svensson saying

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
It's partially due to lack of a

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
Promotion

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
Quote, we've not given up but I'm disappointed in the opening

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
Sales response relative to any other fighting

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
Title we've put out on the same platforms

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
Given the frequency and urgency of

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
Requests we've had here over the last several years

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
And the quality of the execution

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
It's the most fully featured

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
And probably best project of this type

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
That we've done

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
Here's a question that comes to my mind when I'm

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
Reading about these stories and that is

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Is possibly Xbox Live Arcade

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
And Playstation Network just too

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
Oversaturated and that's what's

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
Causing the drop off is that there's just

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
Too much stuff on there now and it's hard to stand

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
Out because I'll tell you what

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
When Xbox Live Arcade first came out

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
Shit I was buying everything

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
I bought almost like every other week there was a new

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
Release I would buy it like just because like hey

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
New game for five bucks right

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
I bought like everything

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
Now I honestly couldn't

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
Tell you the last game I bought on Xbox Live Arcade

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
I don't remember it was a while ago

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
Or even Playstation Network

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
I don't remember the last game

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
I got

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
Last game I got was Retro City

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
Rampage

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
So is it possible that maybe

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
Part of the sales drop off is it's hard

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
For this game to stick out because maybe

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
You know it's not

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
There's too much to pick

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
From now

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
Maybe just Darkstalkers

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
Is just not as popular as Street Fighter

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
But isn't that the game that everybody was asking for?

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
They wanted Darkstalkers 3

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
They wanted Darkstalkers

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
You mean Darkstalkers 4 but could that

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
Could this

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
Could this endanger a Darkstalkers

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
4 because this hasn't been selling well

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
He admitted themselves it was under promoted

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
So I mean a good portion

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
Of the failure to perform has to

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
Do with their failure to promote

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
ActDeft in chat says

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
The last Xbox Live Arcade game I bought was

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
Darkstalkers Resurrection

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
Yyr in chat says

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
I'll say this much

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
The moment Sony announced that Playstation 4

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
Would not be backwards compatible

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
I lost almost all desire to buy

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
Anything for Playstation 3

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
On the Playstation Store

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
That's a really good point

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
That's a very good point

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
I have to admit that crosses my mind too

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
And part of the

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
I mean and this is

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
I know where some people

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
Keep in mind a lot of people I hang out with are classic gamers

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
Why buy something in HD

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
That I have on how many

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
Other dozen systems

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
In the past that I have paid good money for

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
Yeah it's like I got a maim cabinet

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
If I want to play Darkstalkers I'll go play

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
Darkstalkers

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
I've got the Vampire Savior collection for Saturn

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
If I wanted to play that that's the best version

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
Out for a home console right now

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
I mean

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
Darkstalkers they do an anthology on Playstation 2 as well

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
I think so

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Yeah so it's not like it's that hard to go out to your used game store

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
And buy a $5 Darkstalkers

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
It's not that hard

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
I do want a new Darkstalkers

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
That being said because it's probably one of my favorite fighting game

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
Franchises

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
But still

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
I mean doing these HD versions

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
Especially in a still depressed market

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
Not very

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
Not a very good idea you have to bring something innovative out

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
And just cleaning up the graphics isn't going to be enough

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
Interesting

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
But there's other HD remakes on the horizon

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
They might not be fighting games

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
But we do have the Dungeons and Dragons arcade game

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
And DuckTales Remastered coming out

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
Judging on the reaction

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
That everybody gave at least the DuckTales game

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
At Penny Arcade Expo

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
I'm thinking they don't have anything to worry about there

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
That's an HD reboot that's not in trouble

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
But the Dungeons and Dragons games

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
Now look I'm a fan

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
Hell yeah

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
But I worry they're a little niche

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
I don't know I'm hoping I'm wrong

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
I hope I am wrong

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
I will be more than happy to say

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
I was so wrong on that

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
And that game sold shit tons

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
But I have a feeling it's very niche

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
And it might not sell well

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
I keep my fingers crossed on it

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
But I mean they're not really giving it the best promotion either

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
Are they?

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
Well they unveiled it at the same expo

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
Well yeah DuckTales

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
But I mean since then

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
I think they'd have to promote the hell out of it

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
And to really get the type of sales they're looking for out of it

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
And again

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
I probably won't buy it because

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
I've already got it

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
Lots of people in our chat room saying some positive things about it

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
DungeonBuster says yay the D&D beat em ups

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
Marinko

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
I hope I said that right

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
Said I would love to see more Dungeons and Dragons

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
Well y'all better go buy it

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
Chiggers wants Mr. Do

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
They never did I thought they did a new Mr. Do

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
Not that long ago

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
I thought they did I could be wrong

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
I think it was out on a compilation

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
Or some type of like new Mr. Do

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
But it was really nothing like the old ones

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
The sequel Mr. Pooh

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
Mr. Does

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
Mr. Did

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
They had a Mr. Do game I don't remember what it was called

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
But yeah they actually had an arcade game

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
Where it was really weird

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
I don't remember

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
Like a platformer or something

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
And honestly though

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
Back to comparing the D&D to DuckTales

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
People underestimate

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
The love for the old DuckTales game

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
The DuckTales game was freaking sweet

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
I mean

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
That was one of the first things that Dan

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
And I ever talked about when we first met

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
Online ages and ages and ages ago

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
He's like we were talking about

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
Video game music and he says oh yeah my favorite

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
Is that DuckTales moon level

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
And I'm like oh yeah me too and you know

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
And then we started reading you know sharing

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
Bad fanfictions and it was love

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
Aww

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
Actually

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
You know what we met over right?

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
Um

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
Ranma one half

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
Oh I thought it was your sound rips you did

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
No I did those after

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
Actually I just started doing the sound rips after I moved out here

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
Ah

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
Alright well let's move on DarkSakura

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
If you have some news for us

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
Hey Codeman's in chat hi thank you for our poster it's awesome

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
And I need to talk to you later

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
Has to do with album art

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
Secret messages to listeners

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
Secret secret meh

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
Secret message how's that? Well there was

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
A survey that went out

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
That showed the

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
Income disparity between

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
Game developers based on gender

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
And it was

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
Actually a 2012 salary survey

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
That was put out in the March issue of Game

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
Developer magazine where

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
They were saying that even though the number of women

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
In the industry is growing

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
There is still a huge salary

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
Gap is something like

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
The average female game

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
Producer makes about

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
Maybe 79,000

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
And the average male makes

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
About 86,000

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
So we're talking about a huge

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
Disparity for the same work

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
For people who are just as capable

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
If not you know

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
Overlooking people who are more capable simply because

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
Gender

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
Well does the story get into why?

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
There's a big

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
Is that just you know because unfortunately

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
I can't get into the area that has the

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
Cool thing on it because I don't want to pay for a subscription

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
For it. I was going to say

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
Is that just an unfortunate echo

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
Of what can happen

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
In the greater world unfortunately

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
Well they're also

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
Talking a little bit more about

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
Where the bulk

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
Of women are working within the industry

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
And it says that

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
That's in art and animation at about 16%

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
And game designers around 11%

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
So

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
I wish I had more information

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
I tried to get into the thing but

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
I don't have a subscription so sorry

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
Um

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
Marinko in our chat room says

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
You would think we would be past

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
All this gender inequality at this point in human

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
Society. You would wouldn't you?

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
And it's unfortunately

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
That this industry has to

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
Really exacerbate that issue

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
It sounds like from these statistics

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
So

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
But it's just a really

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
It's just

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
Pretty sad I think

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
Sort of sad commentary that

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
I mean I am glad to see more women

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
Getting into the industry because I mean we definitely

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
Need it especially after what we talked last week

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
About the

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
Preference

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
Towards male leads in video games

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
Versus female leads when we've had

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
Awesome games with female leads like what mirrors

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
Edge and the new Tomb Raider

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
The new Tomb Raider

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
I really think that it's just

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
Something in the public perception that's gonna

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
Have to change so

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
Well we have the power

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
To change it so

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
If people would listen to us

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
I don't mean we I mean we as a generation

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
I know I know I know

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
How about this way if people would be

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
A little bit less distracted by

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
Things and actually get off their ass and do something

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
Just saying

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
Alright Loki speaking about the we changing

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
Uh

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
Yeah the uh

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
A lot of the features that are on the we

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Online features maybe

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Stuff that you don't use I'm sure it's a lot of stuff

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
You don't use are being

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Deactivated starting June

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
28th this includes the

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Nintendo channel the news channel

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
The forecast channel everybody votes channel

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
The me contest channel and

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Some of the data exchange

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
With friends in other words

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Data exchange includes the ability

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
To send messages to friends

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
And also all of the

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Me data exchange

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
In some games

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Will end as well

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
I'm wondering if that also means like the

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Me plaza swapping of

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Characters and stuff like that I wonder if that's gonna go away

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
But shit at this point I mean

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
That's almost like

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Almost all the online functionality

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Of the we I mean

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Well like Nintendo's ever had

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Any real concept of embracing

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Online technology it's kinda

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Dumb that they

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Had all these curated channels and they couldn't have

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Like just pulled you know

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Weather information from

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Yahoo or you know news

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
From like anything

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
I don't know RSS

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Feeds I mean that's all they really are why couldn't they

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Have just updated hey we're not gonna do these on

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Our server anymore let's just update this

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
To like RSS feeds for different things

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Uh Rasteel UT in chat

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Asks does anyone use those stupid channels

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
I figured it'd be faster to just go with the browser

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Well I haven't touched my we

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
It was fun to spin the globe

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
In the news channel and in the

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
The weather channel

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
The weather channel but yeah I mean that kinda

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Loses it's luster after some time

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
But you know they're still actively

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Selling the we

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Granted the most recent model they came out with

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
In Canada had the internet parts just

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Stripped out of it maybe that should've

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Told us something but

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
You know it's not like they aren't

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Still I mean there's a we game is

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Coming out this week or just came out

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
The whole pandora's tower

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Yeah this week so it's not like

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
The week itself is dead

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
It's dead but there's

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
But they're sure pulling the plug on

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Basically we connect 24 is

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Getting it's plug pulled anything that runs off the

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Internet on the we is done yeah cause after pandora's tower

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
The next game you have coming out is

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Smurfs 2

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
And then after that

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Planes

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Disney planes

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
And

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Disney infinity

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
So it's all kids stuff but

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
You're not gonna get Madden

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
You're not gonna get in 6AA

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
You're not gonna get anything else

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
I think after this year and maybe

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Maybe if you know

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
There's some indie developers out there

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Or smaller developers that really

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Want to just still focus on the we

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
I think you're gonna be out of titles

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Probably by

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Second quarter next year

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Yyr in chat says

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Darn I can't check the weather at the north pole anymore

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Everyone you know you've done this

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Guilty as charged

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
I have to say not guilty

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Totally fun though I've actually never played with the weather channel

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
You wanna know where my we is?

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
In a dumpster?

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
No it's in a box at Dan's mom's house

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Haven't touched that thing in months

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
I can't believe I waited in line for that thing

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Although that was pretty fun giving donuts

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
And bribing for our spot online

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Ravens dolphin in chat says

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
I don't think people were using that stuff on we

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
How many people sent messages on their we

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
And watch it glow blue

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Not in years mine is on the floor

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
And yeah you know what let's be real

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
I haven't used that stuff in a long time either

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
So I can't sit here and go

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Oh how dare they take away the stuff I used to love

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
It's over

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
I think what the thing that's

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Annoying people the most is it's basically

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Just saying that Nintendo's just giving up

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Support on this console

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
They're just like eh we're done we have the Wii U now

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Which they kinda need to do to help

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
You know motivate people to get the Wii U

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Yeah but I mean what's gonna happen

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
When the new Wii U U comes out

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
The Wii U U?

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Is it the Wii W?

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
That's funny

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Her her I'm clever her

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Alright

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Hopefully also funny and light hearted

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Like some of their previous games

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
And fun will be the next

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Game from level 5

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Level 5

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Is probably most well known for

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Ni No Kuni as of late

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
But they also did Dragon Quest 8

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Which was so good and White Knight

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Chronicles 1 and 2 which you know

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Were kind of a little more controversial

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
In fact I heard the servers for those games are getting shut down

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Which is kind of unfortunate but whatever

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Games end

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
I guess in this day and age

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
But apparently a new PlayStation 4

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Project is in the works

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
This is according to level 5 boss

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Akihiro Hino talking

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
In an interview with Nikkei Trendy

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
It's in the planning stages

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Hoping that they can announce something

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
More specific about it soon

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Could that be

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Ni No Kuni 2

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Dragon Quest 8 2

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Or okay to be fair

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Maybe we don't necessarily need a sequel

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
They can do something new

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
That would be nice right

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
So

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
We will see what is next from

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Level 5

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Okay Ravenstaufen was hilarious

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
There's been a bunch of jokes going on in chat about Wii U 2

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Featuring Bono and I said featuring

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
The Edge and Ravenstaufen

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Says is the Wii U 2 slogan with or without you

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
I like it

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
It's funny

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Yeah that is pretty clever

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
With or without you

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Alright one more story for you guys

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Then release dates, Dark Saga

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
I got a story for you

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Well hackers gonna hack right

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
They cracked

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Ubisoft's Uplay security

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
So they can download games for free

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
And Ubisoft actually sent out

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
A statement that they said that they are aware

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Of the issue and are trying to resolve it

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
The rest of the quote goes no personal information

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Was compromised

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Uplay's PC download service will be unavailable

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Until the problem is fixed however all other Uplay services

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Remain available

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
So basically it was actually a group of Russian

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Hackers that broke into it and downloaded

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Games for free

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Wow

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Hackers gonna hack

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Yeah but that's quite something to get in there and

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Download games for free

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Loki

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Including that's how Far Cry

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Give us some more details

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
How did this exactly happen

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
It's basically a trick with the client

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
I think they said it's easy

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Even maybe like a console command

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Or something like that

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
But basically

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Tricked Uplay into thinking

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
That you own the game and allowed you

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
To re-download it

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
So they did that with

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
And some other stuff

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
To prove that it worked

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
And so now they're gonna try to patch that out

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
But

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
If you mean that sucks that your DRM

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Is able to be defeated that quickly

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Especially to have a game like that

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Leak out early

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
But it is awesome so I do recommend

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Everyone go buy it

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Well they've

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Taken down

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Well it's not gonna stop people from the re-up

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Probably how you got yours but

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Once it's on the internet it's

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
On the internet for a second on there for an eternity

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
But yeah

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
They

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Did their best to get that shut down as soon as possible

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
But still

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
It was Gameranx

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
G-A-M-E-R-A-N-X

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Put an image of the game being

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Downloaded

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
That was for Far Cry 3

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Blood Dragon

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
And basically said here is us

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Sending it to the torrent sites

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
You know

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Bite our ass

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
So

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Hackers gonna hack

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Alright so don't put your full games

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Online

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Or like a month before they're supposed to come out

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Unless I mean

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
I'm gonna do a brag about being unhackable

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Cause usually that follows immediately being hacked

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
No but Ubisoft had that whole

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
DRM thing which nobody liked

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Not that that makes it okay

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
I'm just saying that's you know

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Probably the justification

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
I got the Ubisoft little service myself and I said

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
You know what I don't really need to play Assassin's Creed

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
That much

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
I registered some of my games with it

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
It's you know whatever

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
So

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Alright let us travel around the world

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Check out some release dates

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
And uh

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Loki we'll start with you in the US

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000

Shimagami Tensei Devil Summoner

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Soul Hackers on the 3DS

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
And last but not least

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
One week from today

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
LEGO City Undercover the chase begins

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
On the 3DS

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Oh that didn't come out in tandem with the DS?

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Nope

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
The Wii U version? No it did not

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Weird. Was it delayed?

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
I don't know

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
I don't think it was ever supposed to come out at the same time

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Okay

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Let us go on to Japanese

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000

Revelations gets a special edition

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
I think that's just a price reduction

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm 3

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
hits repackaging type of thing

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000

Is Tomodachi still a thing?

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Yeah Tomodachi I was trying to see what this is

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Tomodachi means friend

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Tamagotchi are the little

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
egg babies

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Little people

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
It's hanging out with friends the game

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Pretty much

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Hang out with friends with PictoChat

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Wait a second

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
For people who don't want to go outside

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Because it's a scary place

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
You know what I can get behind that

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Lastly on the PSP

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Is that like where they're like you know

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Doing one of those

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
What do they call that?

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
I forgot

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
That's it

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
That is exactly what it is

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
That game where they do stuff

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Also on the PSP this week

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
7th Dragon 2020-2

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
It's a little late but I remember now

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
It's like a flash mob but you don't know why you're there

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Sorry I had to look behind me to see if I could find the joke

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Jonsai Gakuen

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Hold your hand up over your head

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
You might catch it when it sails past

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Alright, you know what

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
You guys don't deserve any more Japanese

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Japanese release dates

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
That's it

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
There's some stuff coming out in Europe

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
On the 18th of April

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
We have Pappo and Yo on PC

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Which looks kind of interesting

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
And then stuff on April 19th

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Fire Emblem Awakening and Injustice

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Gods Among Us

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
And that's it

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
No more

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
You guys don't get any more games

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
It's kind of a slow time of year

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Yeah

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Alright, let's go for a few more stories

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
And then the classic game of the week

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
I bet y'all can't wait to see what she picked for this episode

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
You guys are going to be so surprised

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Actually, I legitimately was

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Loki, what did you pick tonight for news?

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
For news? Let's see

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
I picked

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
The UK government investigating

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
In-app purchases

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Because they believe it's putting too much

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Pressure on children to accidentally

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
Or maybe

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Mislead them into

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Purchasing smurf objects

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Or stuff that they don't need

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Basically saying

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
We're concerned that children and their parents

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Could be subject to unfair pressure to purchase

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
When they're playing games they

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Thought were free, but which actually

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
Run up a substantial cost

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
The OFT

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Is not seeking to ban in-game purchases

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
But the games industry must ensure

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
That it's complying with

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Relevant regulations so that children

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Are protected. Think of the children

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
They're coming for you smurf village

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
La la la la la la spend my mom's credit card

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
Are we going to get smurf village 2 with the

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Smurfs 2 movie coming out?

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Smurfs village 2 electric boogaloo?

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
I hope not

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
If it was really combining those two movies

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
I might have to watch it

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
The Smurfs movie is

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
It's so bad

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Katy Perry is one of the

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
I kind of wanted to watch it just because

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Neil Patrick Harris is in it

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Unfortunately did not

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Want to see that movie

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
He can't see that movie

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Now if Neil Patrick Harris

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
The character

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
From all of the wonderful

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
Harold and Kumar movies

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Was in that movie

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
That might be something

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Okay

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
I have to go on a little tangent here

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Dan and I had a very interesting discussion

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
About the Smurfs

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Yes my husband and I discussed the Smurfs

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Through Fry's Electronics

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
He picked up a plushy smurf and said

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
That's a big smurf. He said actually this would be about how big a smurf really is

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
And then he started stacking

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
Like what the size of apples

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Would have been because they're three apples high

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
And he was like how did nobody ever

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Find the damn smurf village

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
If they came up to your shins?

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
So

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
End of story

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Alrighty

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
That means there would be no plot ever

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Because everyone would be

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Well maybe they just

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Lived in like remote Canada

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Where nobody thought to look

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
People live in Canada

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Not that far north

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Yes they do

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
They lived in Nunavut

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Alright

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
Nobody lives there

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Breakman voted for Gargamel

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
I voted for Asriel because Gargamel was pretty stupid

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
To register participation

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
For this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
At vognetwork.com

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Use the passphrase

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Pancake

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Well would you vote for this?

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
I know a lot of people are very

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
They're purist when it comes to their Japanese voiceovers

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
But here's an interesting one

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
How much would you pay for Japanese voiceovers?

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Square Enix

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Is going to be selling a Japanese voiceover pack

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
For the Steam version of Tomb Raider

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
It's already available in Japan

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Through the Western store

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Here's the thing though

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
If you want to get the Japanese localization pack

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
It will cost $30

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
That's $30 DLC

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
That's on top of

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
What the game costs already

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Now it should be noted

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Japanese games do tend to be

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
A little bit higher in price

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Anyway

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
The Japanese version of the game

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Actually comes out on April 25th

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
That is the same day

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
As the voiceover pack

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
And it will retail for $80

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
This is typical for Japan

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
So in a way it's kind of like

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Well the $50 you paid for it on Steam

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
Plus the $30 for the voiceover pack

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Equals the $80 it would have cost you anyway

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
But there went your deal

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
The only reason I could remotely

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Think of it being that high would be

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Simply the cost of paying voice actors

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Especially with

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
I mean

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
It ain't cheap

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
They'd have to

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Basically decide what they've had to pay

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
The voice actors for

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
And then see what their overhead is for the recording

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
And then adjust the price

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
There's still I think pulling a big profit off of it

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
And I know people will buy it

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Yeah there's a lot of people in chat going

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
What? What? Why? But then you have Zombie Princess

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
That gives us a little perspective here

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
At live.vaughnightware.com

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Says I would pay that much for Japanese voices in Mass Effect

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
I would not

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Because it was not ever dubbed in Japanese

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
But neither was Tomb Raider

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
No

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
However

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Actually I do have to say that Mass Effect

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000
In French sounds pretty fucking cool

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
I want to know

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
What her voice sounds like

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Did they go the route where she's super chibi

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Or did they pick like a deep male

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Japanese voice for her

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
It's Japanese voice acting she probably sounds

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Super kawaii

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
YYR in chat says

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
When was the last time a Japanese game was released here with subtitles

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
And the English dub cost an extra

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
$20

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
You know to import a game from Japan

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
Remember when we used to import

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
DDR and BeatMania and all that stuff

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Well um

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Shoot what was it

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
There was another game

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Oh yeah Sonic Adventure

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Remember when it came out on Dreamcast

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
It had the Japanese

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
You could choose the Japanese voice track with the English subtitles

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Which because

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
I played through it the first time in Japanese

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
On my import

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
So I played through it again in Japanese

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Because I was used to the voices

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
I think of a lot of fighting games nowadays

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
I want to say like Soul Calibur

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
The Street Fighter series you can choose language

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
You can choose between the two

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
But the amount of dialogue in Street Fighter versus

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Tomb Raider

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
But it also changed the in game voice acting

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
To the Japanese voice actors

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Which honestly

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
If I'm going to listen to Ryu I don't want him to sound like

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
He's a white boy

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Break Man

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
Going back in time a little bit

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Excuse me

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Not going back in time

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
But Break Man going back to an earlier comment saying

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
I would pay that much for a Mass Effect nude code

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
But I'm a perv

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
You know what you can do that for free it's called text mod

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
Let me introduce you to the internet

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
It is your friend and there's lots of nudity on it

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
Actually I have

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
When I was putting in all those outfits

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
From my Shepard and everything

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
One of them is completely naked except there is absolutely no features on it

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
I'm sure that there's already a mod out there

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
For Tomb Raider

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Again it's the internet

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
It's been done

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
Actdeft in our chat room says

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Just a friendly reminder guys

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
It's optional

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Reminding us that if you don't want to buy the $30 pack

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
You don't have to

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
But Black Wolf goes it's required

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
It exists therefore I must have it

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
There are consumer whores out there

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
And honestly

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
It's the same reason why people buy Dubbed Anime here

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Even though I paid a little bit extra

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
For the subtitled versions

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
When they were on VHS

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
It's people

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
The average person would like

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
To watch something in their native language

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
It's more comfortable

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
For the average person to do

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
People don't want to read

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
At least that's America anyway

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Well let's move on

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
To a simpler time

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Let's travel back in time

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
They didn't have to worry about

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
Dubbing over

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
On different voice overs

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Couldn't talk

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
I'm a little bit older than that

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
I see what you did there

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Yeah I picked a video game

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
That was made in the 1940's

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
This is the legit

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
First video game that existed

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
I am going so classic

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
Like some of your parents weren't alive

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
So chew on that

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
And actually

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
If anyone ever remembers

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
When I used to write for a geek life

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
I wrote for my

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Geeks in History

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
David Smith Jr.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Who basically is the guy that invented this

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
He was from Greenville, South Carolina

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
Born in 1910

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
And he actually

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Filed a patent

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
For a game with

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Estelle Ray Mann in 1948

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
That is a cathode ray tube

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
Game that uses radar displays

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Used from World War II

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
And basically it's table tennis

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
You had adjusting difficulties

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
You would basically

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Have paddles on either side

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Very pong like

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
If you want to have something that is a frame of reference

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
But it would knock the ball

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
From one side to the other

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Using the same type of light moves

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
On a radar screen

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
It had adjustable difficulties

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
He also had

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
A missile game

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Using screen overlays

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
You could shoot at targets

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
It was sort of like

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
The Vectrex

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
But it used

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
Basically the CRT's electron gun

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
Kind of like an edge sketch

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
The same type of

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Theory behind it

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
Now how long before somebody

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Drew a penis?

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Using the technology

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
45 seconds?

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Rob, this was in the 40s

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
People were so repressed

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Like I said

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
They made a cock overlay for it

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
And had

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Becky said they didn't

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
Talk about it in public back then

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
They were polite company Rob

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Rob, you're so dirty Rob

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Sorry I'm trying to

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
I will call her later if you push me

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
I love your mom, your mom's awesome

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Okay but no

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
I'm imagining they put a little

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Penis shaped overlay on it

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
And had the little white ball shoot out of the top

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Anyway

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Basically it detected

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
The targets mechanically

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
And then

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
I'm just going to read this here

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
By connecting a cathode retube to an oscilloscope

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
And devising knobs that controlled

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
The angle and trajectory of the light

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Traces displayed on the oscilloscope

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
They were able to invent a missile game that when

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Using the overlays created the effect of firing

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Missiles at various targets

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
So we're looking at the history

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Of video gaming starting right there

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
I mean unless you want to talk about

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Why can I never remember

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Her name too

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Lady that created the first programming language

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Lord Byron's daughter

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Why can't I remember her name?

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Do you remember?

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
I don't remember her name

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Lady Byron?

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
No

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
But I mean

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
She invented the first programming language

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
So we could just go back to her but

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Still

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Are you looking at

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
I'm trying to look it up

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Ada Lovelace, thank you

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Ada Lovelace

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
So yeah

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
This guy here pretty much

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Without him screwing around

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
With radar screens

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Would we have

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Earth Defense Force

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Just ask him

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Alright

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Thank you World War 2

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
For making video games

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
There it is your classic game of the week

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Radar games

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Radar games

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Radar Love

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Is that what you're going to name it?

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Radar Love

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
We should have played the song in the background

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
That's great

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Let's see

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
Akuma JP linked this to me

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
And this was definitely worth playing

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
With the prior story

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
This is Tomb Raider Japanese voice acting

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
But I want to point out

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
This is the older Tomb Raider

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
This is not from the new game

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
It's a Sega Saturn Sony Playstation game

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
She's watching a computer there

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
Let me fast forward

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
To a loading screen

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Good lord

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
That's the tutorial telling her how to play the damn game

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
This is not a great video

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
This represented the voice acting here

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Let me go back

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
You know what forget it

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
It's lost its

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
I wanted the British accent

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
Thank you Royal Steel U.T.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
It's a cathode ray tube amusement device

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
I'm still calling it Radar Love

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
I like Radar Love it's easier to remember

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Alright

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Let's take a break guys

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
We're going to take a break but when we come back

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
There is plenty more to come

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
We have some rapid fire news for you guys

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
And why not

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
We're going to play match game tonight

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
So stay tuned guys

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Match game and more when we come back

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
With more of Orange Lounge Radio

Rob you should beat Ni No Kuni

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
Now that I said in the bumper you have to beat Ni No Kuni

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Or you have to play this bumper forever

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Never

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
Never I'll never beat it you know why

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Because I have gamer ADD I never beat games

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Welcome back everybody you're participating with Orange Lounge Radio

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Episode number 500

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
In progress here

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
And if you want to send in a bumper

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Like Blocko Jones did

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
And we have one other bumper that was

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
Sent in and I'll let you know who that

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Was next week when we play it

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
That's quite an empty space there

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
We're looking for more bumpers

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
More information at the VoG network forums

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
VoGnetwork.com

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
If you want to send in a bumper for future use on the show

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
Because you know we do say it is the show where every

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
Gamer has a voice and we mean it

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
We want to hear from more of you guys and what you want to use your voice

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
To tell people here on the show

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Alright

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
Moving on

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
You doing okay

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
I think it might be time for me to have one more shot

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Should I do one more shot

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Alright I'm going to go get one more shot

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
What would you use

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Like I'm never going to discourage you from getting shit faced

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
What would you use your voice to tell people

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
What would I use my voice to tell people

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
I would use my voice to tell people to give me money

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Because I'm broke and hire me

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
That's what

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
That's what I'm going to use my voice for

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Jamie that hasn't worked for 500 episodes

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
And it's not going to work now

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
And I think you forgot the whole thing where

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
We're not trying to profit off the show

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
I just want a job

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Listen to my voice

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
You want me to market your stuff

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
I can sell you anything

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
Rob would you sell anything

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
That I offered you to buy

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
I mean

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
Rob says yes

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
He's off the mic

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Yes I would go directly to eBay and sell all that crap

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Hey

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
Alright

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
Okay shot time

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
What's this cheers to

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
The

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
By the way these are double shots

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
To the air we breathe

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
The air from my lungs

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Rob just shivered and made stink face

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Awesome

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
It's fiery

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
It's flaming

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Alright I got your email

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
And I am so sorry I didn't get a chance to reply

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
To a zombie princess

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
Is this personal chat time here on ORR

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Hey it's money shut up

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Alright

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Moving on let's get to

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Rapid fire news

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
And talk about what else is going on in the video game industry

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Coming up the FUGL question of the week

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Match game in this segment as well

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
We're going to get players for that soon

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
But first Loki

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Alright so let's talk a little bit about

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Ridge Racer

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
That's right Ridge Racer

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Driftopia

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Is a new game that they announced that they're going to be putting out

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
No it's not like your classic Ridge Racer

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
It's actually kind of an extension

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Of Ridge Racer Unbounded

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
Which is done by Bugbear

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
And they're doing a new one

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
It's going to be a free to play game

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
So you're going to have

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
I guess the ability to buy cars, repair kits, and XP packs

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Hopefully it's just not going to be crippled

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
By the free to play stuff

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
It's coming to PS3 and PC

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Hurry

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
This is something I actually backed on

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
On Kickstarter, Road Redemption

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
It is a spiritual successor to

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Road Rash, it's in 3D

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
And they're looking for $160,000

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Over the next 30 days

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
And

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
As of right now I believe

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
They're not quite there

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
They are

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Let's see

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
$34,000

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Not bad, so I think they'll make it

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
And it looks kind of neat

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
It is not though done by anybody

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
And last but not least

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
It's fantastic

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
If you haven't watched the trailer yet

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
For the game

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
You should definitely check it out

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
They even have a fake 80's cartoon

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
That they made for the advertisement

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
For this game

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Seriously, buy this game when it comes out in the first

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
It's out on Steam

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
And PS3 and

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
Xbox 360

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Hopefully all around at the same time

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
They have, instead of loading screens

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
They have tracking screens

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
Like VHS tracking

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
It's awesome

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
So what does that mean?

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
It does the little fuzzy wuzzies

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Like a tape that's been de-magnetized

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
It's all fuzzy and then there's the tracking

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Thing going back and forth on the bottom

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Can you adjust it?

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
No

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
And it's great that they have tool tips on there

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
For example, fast travel

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
Is like traveling

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
Fast

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
Or

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
Guns, or was it

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
Shooting enemies within range

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Will cause them damage

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
I need this in my life

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
Alright

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Let's get to

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
Some other stories here

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
This is interesting

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Armature Studio was working on an unreleased

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Mega Man first person shooter

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Called Maverick Hunter

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
This is in a report from Polygon

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Armature Studio is the Austin based developer

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
That was formed from Retro Studios originally

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
Yeah, it was a Mega Man X first person shooter

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
I don't know if that necessarily means

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
You know, like Mega Man Legends or all that

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
But I think this was supposed to be a little more

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Like, you know, hardcore

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
Or something like that

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Capcom did cancel the project

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
You know, cause Mega Man Universe and Mega Man Legends 3

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
All those went to hell, so why not this one as well

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
Armature did have a prototype in 2010

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
And it looks like there was a little screenshot

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
That leaked to the web as well

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
I watched it already

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
How'd it look? I didn't see the video

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
It gave me a lot of vibe

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
I don't know if it would have been this bad

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
But it gave me a lot of the

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Bomberman

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Act Zero vibe

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
Cause it didn't really look like Mega Man

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
He was firing, you know, like machine guns

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
And stuff like that

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
And, you know, just kind of fighting some generic

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Looking robots and doing all sorts of weird

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Take downs and stuff

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
It just didn't seem very much like Mega Man

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
It looked neat, but I don't know if it was necessarily

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Mega Man

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
I don't know

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
I would have probably played it, but

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
I don't know

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
He sort of resembled Mega Man

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
I mean, I can kind of see the look

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
But it was very Bomberman Act Zero-ish

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Ubisoft

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Has picked up German developer related

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Designs

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
They made the Anno strategy series

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Including Anno 1404

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
Which is Dawn's Discovery over here

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Ubisoft previously held a 30% share

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
In the company, but they have purchased the other 70%

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
It is undisclosed for how much

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
That went for, but you can expect more

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Strategy style games for Ubisoft in the near future

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
Unfortunately, Atari

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
Closed a studio this week

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
They closed Eden Games

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Which was the mind behind Test Drive Unlimited

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
And Alone in the Dark

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
A long time ago

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
This is according to a report from Eurogamer

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
I can't believe they closed that

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
Studio after such a wonderful game

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
Like Alone in the Dark

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
I like the Test Drive games

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
The problem was

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
It wasn't Forza

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
It just wasn't

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
That same level

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
They had a charm of their own

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
To get away from the police, you drove in the grass

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
I can't get you, you've left a road

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
How am I going to get you now?

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
Damn you grass

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
And also, Lamborghinis make really awesome

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Off-road vehicles

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
Twitch Game Guru in our chatroom

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
At live.vognetwork.com says

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
Atari still exists?

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
What have they put out lately?

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
Actually, they were supposed to be liquidating soon

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Weren't they? Because all their properties

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
Are supposed to be up for sale

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
I don't know what happened to that

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
It's supposed to happen

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
Marble Madness up for sale

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Somebody needs to pick up Marble Madness

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
That's an Xbox Live Arcade

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
PlayStation Network thing worth

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Picking up for sure

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
They would have to do a lot to Marble Madness though

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
More stages than 6

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
And longer levels

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
And more challenges

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
I have some stuff and things

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
It would help if I was actually on the right window

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
On my stupid iPad

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
We have a new mobile game coming out soon

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
The Prince of Persia

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
The Shadow and the Flame

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Is going to mobile on that

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
Fun date

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
That we like to refer to as

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
Soon

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
But soon

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
And it's

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
Being developed by

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
Ubisoft Pune

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Ubisoft Pune?

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
What?

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
P-U-N-E

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
You say it

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Who likes the Pune?

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
Come over to Ubisoft

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
You gave me this story

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
So you can give me shit

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
Get yourself the Pune

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
You gave me this story

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Ubisoft and saved yourself from trying to

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
It's Rob's fault

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Do not get in the way of me blaming Rob for shit

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
I will judge you

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Ok

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
Dark Souls

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Cause I know that there are a lot of people out there who like this game

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
It sold 2.3 million copies worldwide

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
And that was

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
From Software

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
That put this out

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
They actually had an event to announce this out

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
For the Japanese press

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
It sold 375,000 copies for PS3 in Japan

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:02.000
And 1.3 million internationally for PS3 and Xbox 360

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
So yay for Dark Souls fans

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
You know what I think they should do with that series?

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
They should get the guy that made

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
I want to be the guy

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
And have him help with level design

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
For that game cause that would be awesome

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
Just to fuck with the fans

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
And make it so hard

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
That would make people jump off buildings

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
Or into bullet trains

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
And that type of thing

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
It'd be like a rehash of the beginning of Suicide Club

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
And then last but not least

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Oh ha ha

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
Remember that guy Adam Orth?

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
We were kind of giving him shit last week

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Kinda

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
Well guess what? He quit

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Either he quit or was fired

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
He's the one that said

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Sorry I don't get the drama about having an always on console

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
Every device is always on

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
That's the world we live in

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Hashtag deal with it

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
He decided to retire so he could get all the Pune

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
Well

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
Rob

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
I've been drinking leave me alone

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
Well someone actually went back and asked him

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
Did you learn nothing from Diablo 3 or SimCity

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
You know some people's internet goes out right

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
Deal with it is a shitty reason

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
And he replied electricity goes out too

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
That somebody worked for BioWare if I remember right

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
Manveer

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
Could that have just been friends

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
Giving each other shit cause I'm way

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
Way meaner to people on Twitter than that guy was

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Well

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
I mean the person made another good point

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
You lived in Seattle, San Francisco, LA

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Very connected places try living in

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
Jamesville, Wisconsin or Blacksburg, Virginia

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
And then he said why on earth

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
Would I live there

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
It's a fair question

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
I mean I'm sorry

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
But

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
Come on like you haven't said way worse shit

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
On the internet like you haven't said way worse shit

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
I'm completely innocent

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
Yeah but I've said shit about places I've actually lived

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
Look

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
I get it though this is just the day and age

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
That we live in is that you know

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
Whether or not you want to represent your company

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
When you are the creative director for Microsoft

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
There are people that are going to read way

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Too much into your stuff

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
Like you know create a second account

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
That's anonymous or something like that

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
But like cause I mean if you're like

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Working at Microsoft you don't go

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
I don't understand what the big deal is

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
You're the creative director for Microsoft

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
You don't go posting shit on the internet

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
Unless you hate your job

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
Do you think that he ever imagined

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
That the entirety of gaming

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
Online would read so

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Much into his tweets

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
People on the internet don't think about consequence

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
Usually

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
I know right

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
No one put a gun to his head to tell him to be stupid

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
Yeah but some people are just stupid

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
Okay but by your guys definition

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
Is stupid I act stupid all the time

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
Yes you do Rob

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
I don't but I

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
Rather I like my job

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
And I wouldn't want to lose it due to my opinion

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
But I'm also smart enough to not talk about my industry

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Well exactly and no matter how drunk

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
You might be right now Rob I've seen you far drunker

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
And even in

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
You've seen me at my most drunkest

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
And even in the depths of inebriation

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
I have never seen you said I'm gonna go post

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
About my work on Tumblr or Twitter

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
Me

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Rob's never done that I have seen you kiss a girl

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
Which was very weird

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
Why are we bringing this up?

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
Because you were drunk

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
What does me kissing a girl

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Have to do with an always online Xbox

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
It's less offensive than this guy

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
I love watching Rob turn red it's hilarious

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
He is literally like blowing

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
I almost want to put that into a poll question

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
What's more offensive Rob kissing a girl

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
Or that guy

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
So anyway

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
The guy actually

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Apart from

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Somehow or another losing

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
His means of employment

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Which by the way I'm open for employment

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
Microsoft you can hire me

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
I don't go saying stupid shit on the internet just saying

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Are you sure? Rob

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
500 episodes dark soccer

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
I don't say stupid shit about my job

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
Honey you've said a lot of stupid shit on this show

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
I have said a lot of stupid shit on this show

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
A real friend will tell you that

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
I love this show

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
I admit it

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Anyway the dude actually locked

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
His Twitter and deleted

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
His linked in account

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
So yeah he's like

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
I'm going to hide now

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Can you blame him?

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
I don't blame him he's kind of stupid

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
If freaking loltaku is going to be posting everything

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
That you tweet about then yeah

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
It's suddenly going to become a new headline

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
Then yeah I'd go into hiding too

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
And you all want to know why I don't use my real name

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
On this show because you know

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
I like my job

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
I just don't care

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
What about all this mess or what?

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
Everything

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
You don't care about everything

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
I just don't care I still didn't get

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
Other than the fact that his comments

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
Are a little insensitive to the fact that

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Hey there are a lot of people

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
That are trying to figure out what this new

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
Xbox is going to be like and

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
The rumors that it's going to be online only

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
And then you come out and say well I don't see

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
The problem with that is I mean after all it sounds

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
Like a fucking wonderful thing

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
And then you start being insensitive to everybody

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
That people might be a little bit

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
Pissed off about that and you just don't

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
Understand why well

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Come on can't you put yourself

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
In other people's shoes obviously not

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
Why would I want to live there?

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Obviously they're not asking you to move to this

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
Fucking city they're talking about hey be

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
Empathetic

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
And by the way Rob just for the record I'm not offended

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
I was just like that's bizarre

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
Well it's Queen Simeon

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
Chat says well hey if some people become

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Bicurious when inebriated

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
Look I just like to make out okay

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
I cook

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
What's wrong with that?

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
It's actually a true story I cook when I'm drunk

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
Who doesn't like enjoy a little kissy kissy

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
Every now and then come on

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
You guys were playing spin the bottle

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
And I was the only one sober because I had to drive

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Which was boring

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
This was like ten years ago too

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
This was at the U.N. Loki apartment

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
That was a long time ago

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
I remember that

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
I think you were there

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
I remember you

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Some of the things that happened when you weren't there Loki

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
I remember you like

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
Matrix walking up the

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
Or trying to matrix walk up the wall

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
That was fun

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
Remember the

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
DDR parties

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
People would

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
Inevitably end up like retardedly drunk

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
And then try to play DDR

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
And hit their head on the washing machine

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
That was behind the monitor

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
I don't know anything about that

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
La la la la

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
Let's see going to

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
The chat SSJ100 Matt talking about this guy

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
Says he got death threats the gaming community

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
Is sad that is stupid

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
That is stupid

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
The action

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
Needs to be taken against the people who are making

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
Death threats over a video

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
Game console

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
Priorities people

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
This is a problem though with the internet in general

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
Is that it has added this

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
Air of anonymity where people can just let the worst

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
Parts of their personality out

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
Without any sort of real consequence

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
Except unless you know how to track

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
IPs

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
And then you can message them back and tell them where they live

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
Alright is there anything else

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
You want to share with us for rapid fire

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
News that has gone on for 20 minutes?

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
I'm done

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Let's get to the FUGL question of the week

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
And let's see how many of them I can make it through tonight

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
FUGL question of the week

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
Where's my FUGL song

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
I can sing

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Becky can sing

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
She's a good singer

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Facebook, Google

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Put them together you get FUGL

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
And every week we ask a question

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
And we read some of the answers here on the show

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
There's a lot of answers tonight you guys

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:50.000
Who is your favorite character in a video game ever and why?

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Easy right?

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
I thought you know it's a special episode

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
Let's keep it simple let's keep it positive

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
Do it

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Alright so who's your favorite character in a video game and why?

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
Redertainment on Google Plus says

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
I like it whenever I'm able to play with myself

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
And we're done thank you everybody

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
It's been a great show I'll see you later

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
See you next week

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Episode 501

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
Thanks for joining us tonight

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
That was clue worthy Rob

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
I like whenever I'm able to play with myself

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
I like playing with characters

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
That I can style to be like myself

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
Or an idealized version of myself

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
That's the unique thing about video games

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
Rare is the media platform

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
That allows yourself to project yourself

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
Into the media experience

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
Rare is the media platform

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
That not only allows you to

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
Right encourages you to play with yourself

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
I think I see what you're doing there Redertainment

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
And didn't he marry our own little angel?

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
Huh? Redertainment?

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
No it was not Redertainment

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
You're thinking of big red pimp

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
Different red

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
Sorry

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
Shane just messaged me other memories

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
Of things that happen in that apartment that are not

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Appropriate for error

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
Send me a message

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
No I'm telling him to

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
Flaco Jones says I have to go with

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
GLaDOS

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
I've been drinking you guys

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
As if she wasn't already worthy of the title

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
After the first game

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
Portal 2 manages to give her even more depth

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
And a backstory as well

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
She also may be the most quotable character

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
In a video game history

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
More quotable than the old guy in Legend of Zelda?

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
It's dangerous to go alone

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
Kirby of course

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
Despite popular belief he doesn't suck

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
Evil says

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
Missing no

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
By a simple random encounter you get

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
Infinite rare candies and master

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
Balls for the cost of being disgraced

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
In the hall of fame

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
And Dasnichi replies

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
Solid snake

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
But are you still gonna feel that way

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
If it's not David Hayter?

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
That's my question

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
I need to not listen to

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
Any more of this while I'm having drinks

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
What, these lulls?

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Ok so on Facebook we have

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
30 responses, should I read them all?

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
30 responses on Facebook

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
Grandpa says Mega Man

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
After he acquires the boss's skill powers

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
He's very versatile, I like my men

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
My men versatile

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
DarkSakura

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
replied but nobody cares

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
Tim P.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
replied and said Commander Shepherd

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
He's the sexy space marine

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
I always wished I could be

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
He said he, a brochep fan

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
A brochep fan

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
There are no room for dude chefs in my head

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
Burr replied and said

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
Sonic the hedgehog

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
Too fast for the naked eye

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
Sonic the hedgehog, Sonic

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
He can really move, Sonic he's got an attitude

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Sonic he's the fastest thing alive

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
Anyway to me as a kid that was the moment

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
When video games started to be cool

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
And not just goofy fun with ridiculous looking characters

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
I'll always have a soft spot for Sonic

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
as a series

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
Sil replied Garrus

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
First time I thought an alien was damn hot

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
I love you Sil

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
Dark Tetsuya said pantsless rage

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Just kidding, in all seriousness I'd have to go

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
with Solid Snake

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
That was an old ass

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
That was an old ass

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
That was an old joke

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
Gamergirl says

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
Sophie, later known as Protos Hyas

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
Ok this music

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
is starting to not do it for me

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
From Tails of Graces F

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
because she's odd

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
Red the Haze says

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
Renegade femshep

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
I've never had a favorite game character but

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
Renegade femshep comes to mind

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
You know what, I actually have to

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
kind of agree with that playing Renegade femshep

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
is pretty fun, except in some

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
situations then it's just bitchy

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
But I'm playing one right now with Ashley's face

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
It's really funny

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
James S. replied and said

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
There's a sorely underrated mid-90s

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
NX game called The Illusion

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
of Gaia, that game rules

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
I have this game

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
Good choice

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
The journey that young Will endures in hopes to find out

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
what became of his father who ventured off

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
before him ultimately changes the course of the

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
entire world

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
This game came out during a time when games of this art style

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
weren't just for children

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
The themes were adult and the story utterly breathtaking

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
The music alone gives me chills

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
It was part of a three part series

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
Soul Blazer was one of them

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Oh god, I can't remember the first

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
other game in the series

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
There's one other game in the series

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
It's Soul Blazer Illusion of Gaia and there was another one

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
Dammit, well somebody in chat will remember

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
Yeah, somebody in chat do our

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
work for us

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
Andrew S. said

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
The Chesire Cat from American McGee

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
He's creepy and psychologically

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
sane and insane at the same time and always

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
cool and collected

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
Bobby Blackwolf says

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
Dot in Adventure, he was so brave

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
He was

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
He had to figure out how to get through that maze

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
Thank you

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
Rasteel UT, Terranigma, that was it

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
Oh, Prince Brightstar actually brought it up

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
first too, yes it was Terranigma was the other game

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
Shane replied and said

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
Another vote for Commander Shepard

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
but only if he's full on paragon

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
He sets the bar for what qualities

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
I'm looking for in a man, video game character

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
I mean

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
Gio Videa says

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
The Eye Tetromino

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
Everyone always wants the eye

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
Alright, I have to go with Dante from the Devil May Cry

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
series, a complete badass

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
also a bit of an asshole, you really get to see

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Dante go from reckless teen

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
to equally reckless adult

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
Ronnie B says

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
Ico, he took me through a great journey

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
He went through a lot in the story and overall the game was really

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
original

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
Extover says Samus Aran and I don't need

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
to explain why

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
Well yes you do

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
The alternate universe extover thinks Nathan Drake

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
is his favorite based on ass physics

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
Also Matt, my boyfriend's

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
favorite is Yoshi

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
Wonder Dog Harold says

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
Leon S. Kennedy, he's so dreamy

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
Degenerate Johnny says

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
Kreia from Knights of the Old Republic 2

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
From being one your companions

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
at the beginning to becoming the ultimate

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
villain at the end, you'll find that she's one of the

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
most unique and best written characters you'll ever

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
meet in a video game

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Emily C. replied and said

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
I love all cosmos in Katamari Dimash

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
He is so fun, flamboyant and makes me

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
laugh every time, that's a really good choice

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
Barbara O. says

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
Toss up between Cloud from Final Fantasy 7

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
and Balthier from Final Fantasy 12

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
We get to watch Cloud make a terrifying

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
discovery about himself and then fight his way

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
back from it. Balthier seems to be

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
only a dashing pirate, but he

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
slowly reveals both his trustworthiness

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
and his strong moral convictions

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
At least he's not talking about being a hero all the damn time

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
These are all really good answers

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
Wolf O'Donnell from Star Fox

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
because he can't let you do that

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
Wicked says

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
My favorite has to be Kratos, not because

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
of anything relatable, but due to his

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
utter ferocity and severe brutality

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
I had not seen in a video game character beforehand

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
It was almost like playing a villain, as cold-hearted

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
and brutal as he was

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
Kyrian G. says

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
Myak the Liar because his

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
dialogue is extremely entertaining

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
That or Luther, son of Scotia from

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
Lands of Lore 2, Guardians of Destiny

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
who provided many sound bites to my family

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
throughout the years

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
Edgar R. replies

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
There's nothing like roaming the post-apocalyptic world

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
beating up mini Power Rangers

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
and racing poison chihuahuas

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
Rob H. says

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
Guybrush Threepwood

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
He's a mighty pirate who can hold his breath for 10 minutes

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
and he also has a rubber chicken with a pulley

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
in the middle. How can you not like that?

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
There's a lot of unique answers

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
tonight. I like this. That's why I'm reading them all

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
because there's so many different ones

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
I feel equally about two characters

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
Samus Aran, she's awesome and badass

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
I fell in love with her in Super Metroid

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
My other all-time

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
fave is the adorable and amazing

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
Garrus. I wasn't too sure of him in Mass Effect

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
1, but by 2 they made his character so much

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
better. He's sweet, a bit of a dork,

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
but kind. J. Link

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
says Will from Illusion of Gaia

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
There's two people that said that

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
Go figure

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
People have good taste. I could relate at that age

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
when I played the game about being the outcast

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
change kid in class and having a clique

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
of dorky friends. It also didn't hurt

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
that the game story was amazing and I really

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
fell in love with it as my first real RPG

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Dave Falcon says

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
Duke Nukem. Why? Hail to the

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
king, baby. Tiger Claw

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
says I'm gonna have to say Mario. Why?

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
Because he always gets the girl in the end

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
Marinko says

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
Knuckles the Echidna

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
I can never say that. No one

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
has better background music than that Red Demon

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
Pumpkin Hill, anyone?

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Haseo Sumeruwagara says

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
To be honest, I'd have to say Oran from Final Fantasy

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
X, Travis Touchdown from No More

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
Heroes, and Big Boss from the Metal Gear

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
series. I loved

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
Big Boss in the very first game.

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
That was amazing. Lastly,

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
Slagkick says

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
Bayonetta. She's a fierce

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
witch who kicks major ass and has great

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
hair. Great hair. Fabulous.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
You know what? I'm actually starting

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
that game next week. Good answers.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Bayonetta is freaking amazing.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
Alright.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
So, let's go around the table.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
I'm curious what you guys all think. Dark

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
Sakura, I'll start with you as if this is gonna be a

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
shock. Favorite game character of all time?

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
The Guardian from

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Guardian Legend.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
Good pick. Why The Guardian?

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Because Guardian Legend, first of all, is my favorite game.

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
And it was just

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
it was really neat when playing through the game

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
and then

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
having to pause the game and going, is that

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
a girl? That's a girl.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
Yeah. And it was, you know,

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
an early NES game that had

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
a female protagonist. And yeah, we had Metroid

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
but you didn't find out that Samus

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
was female until you beat the

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
game or put in Justin Bailey.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
You know, it was

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
a character that was

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
going around and kicking a lot of ass

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
in one of the most difficult

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
games I have ever played in my life.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
And we all know how freaking hard that game

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
is. I don't have nearly half the skill I used to

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
have at that game. It's so amazing though.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
I've beaten it. God, I wish that game

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
would come back somehow. I don't really want

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
like a remake necessarily, but just a spiritual

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
successor of sorts. Well, I'm still trying to

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
I'm debating putting an MSX emulator on

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
so I can play Gardic, the first one.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
Yeah. Oh,

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
sorry, anything else? Well,

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
The Guardian Effect, yeah.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
But

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
I also would have to, I mean,

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
as far as classic gaming, that

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
would be probably my favorite character.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
Anything more modern,

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
I'm actually going to go with Bayonetta.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
Yeah. Because, well,

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
I mean, I really would like to go with

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
my own Shepard, but I have my own

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
weird head canon. Then you're playing with yourself

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
like ready to chamber. Then I'm playing with myself.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
And I can get dirty, especially the places my brain goes.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
So, Hey all!

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
So, um,

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
I'm actually going to go with Bayonetta just because

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
it's totally fabulous. And I love

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
her character concept. I love the game.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
It was completely over the top.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
And I watched Dan play through it for a little while

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
because I didn't, you know, really do a lot

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
of console gaming after my surgery.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
Except for playing Blue Dragon.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
So, um, but I've got a lot more

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
endurance in my hand now thanks to practicing a lot.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
So I'm going to sit down and try to play through

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
Bayonetta. So playing with yourself has gotten

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
your hand a lot of practice. No, I've been drawing!

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
Shut up! Alright.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
Becky, do you have a favorite

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
that you'd want to mention?

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
Well, since the last time I

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
played video games before Jamie got

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
me hooked on Mass Effect was

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
on my parents, Commodore 64.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
Good choice.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
I think I would probably have to say

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
FemShep.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
I like, I really like her

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
mostly paragon with just a little bit of bitchiness

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
here and there because it makes her feel human.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
Very good. Very good answer.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
You're in good company with some of our listeners tonight.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Loki?

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
One of my favorite characters

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
and unfortunately they better bring him

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
back for the goddamn fourth game because that was

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
a fucking mistake to kill him off.

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
Johnny Gap from the Saints

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
Row series. Fucking awesome

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
awesome character.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
Of course, voiced by

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
Daniel Dae Kim.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
From Lost and stuff.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
Just awesome.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
Really cool character.

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
That's probably it.

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
My favorite video game character

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
ever would probably be

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
Rydia from Final Fantasy IV.

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
That's a good choice. Because

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
just literally

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
watching her grow up through the game

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
and I have such an attachment to that story too

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
because that game was so epic and

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
that was really the first time most

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
people in America saw the summoner

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
and that was such a badass thing when she would come back

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
to your party and she had all those

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
summons and you'd go to her homeland and everything

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
and she used the whip which was cool and

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
had the black magic and

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
she was great.

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
Obviously she had to grow

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
up a lot faster in that story and

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
went through tragedy and overcame it.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
But I have such an attachment

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
to Final Fantasy IV but Rydia was an

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
amazing character.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
Where Dan in this room, he would

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
probably list Cain as one of his favorite characters

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
from the same.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
Or Zero.

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
I want to know what Allen

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
would pick. Allen,

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
sorry to put you on the spot. I know you came in here

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
to get a snack but what's your favorite

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
video game character ever?

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
Robo and Luca together.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
Twins. OTP.

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
Good choice.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
Good choice. Alright, thank you guys for

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
participating with the Fugu Question of the Week. I know

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
that was a lot this week. I read every

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
single answer because you know what? It's a show where

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
every gamer has a voice. Why not? Let's get back

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
into some news. Loki.

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
Alright, so let's

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
talk about some more Xbox rumors

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
and hopefully, I don't

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
know, I hope that these are all rumors

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
so I don't know. This is kind of almost

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
like the whole online thing.

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
But once again, I

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
still am under the assumption

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
at least I guess hopeful assumption

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
that Microsoft isn't dumb enough

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
to have a console that's

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
online only. That would

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
be a major gaming console that's online only

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
and maybe some of this kind of ties into it

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
and it's this leaked

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
roadmap that's been

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
a new roadmap that they had.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
Now, this is coming

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
from VG Leaks so

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
who knows? But basically saying that

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
there's going to be two

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
Xboxes the next time around.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
There's going to be a mini Xbox that's going to

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
operate kind of like an

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
Apple TV. Basically, all the

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
video streaming stuff

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
maybe even like Xbox Live Arcade

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
that kind of thing. That

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
will be online only because it will not have

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
a disk drive. However,

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
the regular console will

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
not be online only.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
That makes a little more sense

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
because an Apple TV

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
kind of operates the same way. It's not

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
necessarily online only but to get

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
all the functionality of it, you have to be connected.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
You mean to use Netflix? I have to be online?

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
Shut the front door.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
And they're saying

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
that basically the

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
whole

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
tying in with the TV is going to be

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
a big thing. Basically, they're saying the smaller

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
Xbox is to compete with the Apple TV

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
but also provides XBLA and

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
360 game support

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
which will give it an edge over the Apple

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
TV. Basically,

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
saying that the rumors of the online

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
only requirement

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
come from the smaller Xbox unit which may

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
not have a disk drive like Apple TV.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
It would require

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
a network connection and internet

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
to provide any real functionality.

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
It may be possible they will design

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
both consoles to be stackable.

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
And

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
of course, the original

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
rumor was that Durango is not

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
going to be backwards compatible

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
which makes sense. It's a

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
different processor altogether.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
The PS4 is not going to be

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
backwards compatible either.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
Also, the Kinect, they're saying that

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
a different department within

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
Xbox handles the Kinect hardware and

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
software. The focus was more on developing

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
and networking both consoles

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
with Kinect more of an

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
afterthought at that point. It says concerning

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
dealing with it, it's less an issue than hardware changes.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
The main console, Kinect, isn't the

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
primary focus. However,

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
development kits require several pieces

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
of hardware combined. All the potential

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
hardware which may or may not be

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
required to work with each other.

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
Which also includes the potential for any

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
devices to require a network

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
connection which is where that required

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
rumor comes from.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
I'm thinking

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
I'm just hoping that it's not all

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
online only. This sounds a little bit more

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
Microsoft. Microsoft's

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
always been about streaming crap to your TV.

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
They have the whole Windows

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
XP Media Center edition and that kind of

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
shit.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
I could see them wanting to be in

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
your living room and have this focus and

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
stuff.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
I'm just hoping that they don't make the mistake of

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
having a console that's going to be a next gen

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
console that's only online.

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
After all, Microsoft's

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
live service hasn't been working very

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
well the last few days.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
It's not a good idea to say

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
hey, we're going to be online only.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
Ignore the fact that you couldn't connect

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
to live the last few days.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
Let me ask this though,

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
because here we go again reporting

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
on rumors.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
I'm not saying us specifically,

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
but I'm just talking the internet and the whole

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
hype machine. Why do we keep

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
reporting on rumors?

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
Because we don't have anything to go off of from

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
them. All we know is that they're going to

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
have

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
some sort of, the rumor is that

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
they're going to have some sort of

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
reveal at the end of May, but right now

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
we have no information about it other than what's

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
supposedly leaking out.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
I think mainly discussing this, I'm not saying

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
this is all fact. I'm just saying here's the rumor

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
and I hope

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
it's a little bit more on this side

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
than it's always

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
online. There is no other

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
way about it.

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
I want to know how important talking

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
about Xbox rumors are. You know what it's

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
time for? I think it's time for us

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
to poll the listeners.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
We're going to put up a live poll right

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
now at live.vognetwork.com

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
If you want to vote in the poll, make sure

you're logged in. live.vognetwork.com

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
How much weight

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
do you give to Xbox

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
rumors? It's Microsoft, it's

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
all true. I think a lot of it is

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
true, but I'm still quite skeptical.

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
I think it's mostly made up stuff for hits,

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
but once in a while the truth leaks.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
Or the internet is full of lies

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
and slander, and I don't

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
believe any of it. Vote now

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
live.vognetwork.com

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
Our Instant Poll

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
We'll read the results

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
here in a moment, and try to

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
get some of the answers as they come in.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
Alright.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
And then one other thing also,

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
another rumor coming along with

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
some of the launch titles. Next-Gen

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
Forza game, Rise,

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
a couple weeks ago I've been talking about

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
Rise saying, where the fuck was that

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
gladiator game that showed that it was supposed to be a

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
Kinect title? So that

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
may be something that's going to be there. And then

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
some sort of, you know, kind of

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
Nintendo Land-esque Kinect

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
game. Although I

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
am seeing a lot of Kinect titles, two of those

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
being Kinect-required titles, so

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
ehhhhh

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
Not interested, but

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
Forza sounds cool. Forza Horizon.

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
Next-Gen Forza Horizon, I could be down with that.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
Alright, right now in our Instant

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
Poll, very much, it's very tilted

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
towards the bullshit side of things.

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
67% of the vote for

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
I think it's mostly made up stuff for hits,

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
but once in a while the truth leaks.

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
21% saying the internet is full of

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
lies and slanders, I don't believe any of it.

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
So only 13%

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
of the vote at this point, I think the math doesn't add up because

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
it just updated, 13% of the vote

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
right now only slightly leans true.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
Zero people saying

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
it's all true. Zero.

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
Rob, it's on the

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
internet, of course it's true. Well, some

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
people would think that. You know what,

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
honestly, I almost lean towards that top

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
option. With Microsoft, there's

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
very little that's fake anymore

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
it seems. But we'll see.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
We'll leave that poll up for about another minute.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
Again, live.vognetwork.com, live on this

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
Sunday evening if you want to vote in that poll.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
I think we're all still UT has it wrong, instead of the internet

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
being 10% lies and 90% porn.

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
I think it's 10% lies,

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
10% hate,

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
and 80% porn.

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
YYR in our chatroom asking

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
where is the poll? It will show

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
up automatically at live.vognetwork.com

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
if you are logged

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
into the site. If you're not

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
logged into the site, it may not

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
show up for you.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
This is a feature that's in beta

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
right now. Trademark.

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
So you can't talk about it to anybody.

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
Literally, this

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
was not tested.

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
We are testing it as the show goes on.

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
So, there you go.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
Alright. You're all under NDA

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
you can't talk about it.

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
Alright, we'll do one more story and then I'll go to the results of that poll.

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
I'll shut it off and do that.

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
This is a story about Animal Crossing and I

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
can't flippin' believe this.

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
I know, right? That's the same sound I make.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
Mr. Resetti

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
from Animal Crossing, optional

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
in New Leaf. What?

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
He is not there by

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
default and this is because of

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
QQ online.

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
Now, tell people

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
about Mr. Resetti for those that don't know Dark Star.

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
If you didn't save your game

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
and just turned off your

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
Animal Crossing, you turned off the system

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
where you had Animal Crossing loading.

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
When you started your game back up

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
this mole comes out of the ground

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
and yells at you

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
for ten minutes

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
in all capital huge letters

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
and from what

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
I understand, because I tried doing it on my Japanese

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
version, he's really freakin' rude.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
And it was just absolutely

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
hilarious. He's like, what did you do in resetting

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
this form? Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
And he freakin' chews you out.

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
This mole, bitter

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
crass,

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
grumpy old mole

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
digs his self out of the hole just to give

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
you shit for not saving your game.

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
This is not popular in our chat.

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
Gamegirl says, what? He's the best part

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
of the game. YYR says, it's blasphemy.

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
Gameguru says, Mr. Resetti

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
has been fired. No, he's not

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
fired. Let me clarify here.

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
In a column called Iwata

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
Asks, Resetti's

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
status was updated.

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
Apparently out of guilt

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
the developers made him optional

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
in Animal Crossing New Leaf because

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
apparently he brought some players to

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
tears. Good!

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
Save your game!

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
They also changed the goal of the

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
game from paying off Tom Nook

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
to improving the town as the mayor.

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
So Tom Nook is no longer your

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
pimp. YYR says, Mr.

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
Resetti is a critical feature of Animal Crossing.

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
It is required for the game to

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
work properly. He handles many of the game's calculations

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
so it's technically impossible to run Animal

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
Crossing without it. Strudels89

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
says, he was a dick, lol.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
Loki's a dick, but we all

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
love him. We keep him around.

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
He's a vital part

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
of the show. We couldn't do calculations

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
without him. In fact, you know what?

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
You know what we used to do all the time?

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
Fucking time travel. Fuck that

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
Resetti. Hell yeah. I'm time traveling like

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
fucking Marty McFly.

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
I would travel to my birthday every

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
year just to get more shit.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
Now in an article on Destructoid, I

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
really like this point about it, but in an article

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
published on Destructoid, they talked about how it was

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
one of the more creative fourth-wall

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
breaking moments in gaming history

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
along with Psycho Mantis reading

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
your save files on the Playstation card.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
I see you like Final Fantasy.

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
Did he actually? He only called

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
that other Konami games, didn't he? No, I'm sorry.

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
He said Xenogears

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
and it was on there before

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
Xenogears. What am I saying? Are you thinking Castlevania?

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
No. Yeah, he said Symphony of the Night

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
because Dan and I had... Sweet Coden?

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
It was Sweet Coden. That was it because Sweet Coden

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
hadn't come out yet.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
By the way, we tried that

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
with our Japanese save file for Castlevania

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
and it did not work.

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
But what do you guys think?

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
Is it a great fourth-wall breaking

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
moment? I think more games should break the fourth-wall

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
to be honest. I think so too, but it was pretty cool

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
watching the controller move on the floor

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
with Psycho Mantis.

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
Alright, that's going to bring our poll

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
to an end at live.vognetwork.com

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
So from the last story, here it is.

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
How much weight do you give to Xbox Rumors?

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
62% of the vote saying

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
I think it's mostly made up stuff for hits

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
but once in a while the truth leaks.

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
Hey, finally a vote.

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
3% of the vote for it's Microsoft.

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
It's all true.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
Oh, poor naive child.

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
12% I think a lot of it is true

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
but I'm still quite skeptical.

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
22% the internet is full of lies

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
and slanders. I don't believe any of it.

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
Hasea Sumiragawa says a good point.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
Deadpool will. I'm excited.

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
But Deadpool you expected of Deadpool.

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
You didn't quite expect that in Animal Crossing.

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
To have a character come out of the ground

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
and yell at you for 10 minutes.

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
Whereas, I mean didn't you

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
ever read Deadpool

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
in comics? It's supposed to happen.

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
Hi. You know what else people

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
weren't expecting?

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
Video game match game

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
coming back to OLR tonight. When was the last

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
time we did this? It was a long time ago wasn't it?

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
A while. It was a while.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
But we are going to do video game match game tonight

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
but we need some contestants for video game

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
match game. So let's get

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
a listener in the chat room. Here's

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
how we're going to pick a listener from the chat room.

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
The first person to name

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
that wants to play match game. First person

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
to shout out in chat. What

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
were the potato chips

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
that Jamie got excited about when they

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
were set on the table earlier in the evening?

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
This is test your memory earlier in the show.

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
First person to remember and shout it out in chat

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
will get to play. And

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
we'll take the first caller right now

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
on the skype line 1877 game

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
OLR or a user name on skype

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
orange lounge radio. The first person

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
to get through will get to play

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
video game match game against

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
our chat room

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000
listener who answers first which is

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
Mako Chan or Jovidea got the

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
right answer. There it is. Mako Chan.

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
Alright so let me open

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
up a chat window with Mako Chan.

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
Mako Chan from Makoto.

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
Oh my bad.

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
Well I keep thinking of the Mako from

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
Mass Effect.

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
You know what? I kept calling it Mako

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
because

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
I took too much Japanese.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
And the answer was

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
Chicken and Waffles and JasonXV

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
after that. CodeMan

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
TimTRP

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
got it. It wasn't the cheese bread. I just said the cheese

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
bread was delicious. Alright let's see

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
who Mako Chan is going to be competing against

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
tonight. Let's go to the skype line right now. Hi you're on

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this? Oh my god

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
I got in. You got in? Hi.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
OMG! Who is this?

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
It's Raven's Dolphin. Raven's

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
Dolphin! You always come out

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
for the big landmark episodes. I always

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
love hearing from you. Oh my god I

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
have to. You guys. I know you

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
have to get to match game but I have to say

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
you guys are an inspiration to me and my

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
show. What I do. I look

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
at you guys. I'm like wow they keep going.

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
I keep going. But

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
it is absolutely a pleasure to be

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
with you tonight. I totally love

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
your icon by the way. It's gorgeous. Thank you

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
so much and you know flattery will get you

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
everywhere but it won't win you the match game.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
You can come over and have murder brownies.

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
Would you like a murder brownie?

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
Yes just send it over the internet

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
please. I know you have to get to match game but I

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
have to know one question. Alright

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
fair enough. Alright

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
so you've been doing this show for 11 years

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
and was there

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
a time that you said

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
I don't know if I can go on?

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
Yes.

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
Alright.

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
That was episode 2.

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
Yes.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
If I

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
followed through every time I

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
threatened to quit the show there would have been about

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
20 Orange Lounge radios by now but

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
you know you find your motivation

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
and you keep going and you know

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
a lot of the drama tends to work itself

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
out and you know drama is drama

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
and drama

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
was something I thrived a lot more on when I was

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
in my 20s and now that I'm in my 30s

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
it's like I don't know what else

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
I'd have if I didn't have O.L.R.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
The sad reality is

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
the sad reality is

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
this show will end someday.

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
I mean it has to. Everything comes to an end.

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
But I like to think it's going to end because

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
you know. Murder.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
It's not going to end in murder. It's going to end

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
because Dark Sakura

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000
has to move for a great

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
dream job of hers or something or

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
you know low key. It had to be a hell of a dream job.

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
You know I'm just saying like it's going to

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
be something along those lines

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
or you know the honest.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
It would have to be something that would dramatically change our

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
dynamic. Or that

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
you know we all sit down and we agree

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
you know what we don't have the passion

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
for this we once did. And I mentioned on a

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
previous episode I sometimes worry about

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
where the gaming industry is going when we talk about all this

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
always online and

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
the management thinking they know what's best

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
for gamers. I sometimes sit here and wonder

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
am I going to be a video game fan

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
in a few years.

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
But I like to think I would

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
and even if I fell out of

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
love with new consoles the

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
dynamic of the show would just shift again.

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
We didn't start as a video

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
game show.

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
Super Orange on Radio 2X.

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
I was there when you

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
were at 2Go and I found you on a

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
PSP website. Which

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
Loki still needs to update the freaking thing.

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
No it was on a different PSP website.

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
Oh really?

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
Yeah it was on like this called

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
PSP Drive and it was formatted for

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
PSP and you were on there

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
and I remember downloading it

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
before the other sites and all that stuff.

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
This was before Black Wolf and A1 and I went like

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
oh Orange on Radio I'll download this.

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
Oh VGN I'll download this.

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
Yeah I have to admit Loki got

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
on that PSP bandwagon really early

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
and a lot of the PSP community really

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
supported that older website. We were

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
on whatever the AOL blog was for

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000
PSP before they all merged into Joystiq.

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
We were featured on there once and

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000
that was really cool.

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000
As much as we joke about the PSP and that

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
website and how out of date it is, that

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
community really embraced Loki's

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
little project so we really appreciate that.

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
Now it's

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
Stitcher and iTunes.

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
Yeah it's all about Stitcher and iTunes. Especially Stitcher

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000
I think is really the wave of the future especially as

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
iTunes continues to

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
shove

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
podcasting under the table.

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
That's for another episode.

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
I do have to share this. Frisbee says when that happens convert

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
OLR to food and Disneyland talk.

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
So Jon's like episode 501

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
dull whips.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
Ragenator in chat says I've been

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
a fan of gaming for 32 years. I don't see

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
myself losing my gaming passion.

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000
You know and I think ultimately I tend to

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
agree. I may get really pissed off at some

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
of the decisions that happen in the gaming industry

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
but at the end of the day I could always come on

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
here and talk about Commodore 64.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
Right.

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
I keep going. You keep going.

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
It's an inspiration. Of course.

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
Let's get to the match game.

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
All right.

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000
Do you know how the match game works Ravenstaufen?

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
Oh my god do I know.

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
I mean too bad we don't even have Charles Nelson

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000
Wiley or that guy from

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000
from Family Feud.

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
Well you've got me. Awesome.

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000
Richard Dawson. You've got me and

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000
you've got on the panel tonight you've got

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
Techmaster Loki is here joining us on the

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
panel tonight. Hello. And Dark Soccer

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
is here. Hi. And I'm here

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000
and Chef Becky is here.

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
Iron Chef Becky is here

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
with her murder brownies to play

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
with us. Hello. And Becky you're going to play with

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
us too right? Sure. Sure why not.

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
And then also joining us in studio

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
tonight say hello to

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000
Hello Mother Dolly.

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000
Wow.

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
Oh Alan you're the best.

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000
Or excuse me is it is it little

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000
Alan tonight? It's not little Edie

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000
it's just Alan. Hello.

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
All right Alan is going to be joining us tonight. So here's how

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
it works for the listeners who may not know.

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000
We're going to read some statements

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000
and these statements will have a blank

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
at the end of them or near

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
the end of them. It's up to Ravens Dolphin

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
and Mako Chan playing along

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
in our chat room to guess what will

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
be said in that blank by

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
the hosts on the panel.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
For every answer they get right

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
they will get a point.

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
But like whose line is it anyway the

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
points really don't matter. But we'll give our

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000
winner a little something. Listen to a no prize.

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
All right. So here we go

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
and Mako Chan if you're sitting there

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
in our chat room be sure to

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
send your answers over

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
private message to me as I give

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
them to you. All right

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000
so here we go. Here is question

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
number one tonight.

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000
Bobby Blackwolf.

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000
It's the first question

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
it's got to be about Bobby.

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
Bobby Blackwolf brought

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
on the ire of 4chan

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
this week by voicing his opinion

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
on Twitter.

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
He didn't really seem to care at

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000
first but he really lost

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
it when they came for

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000
his blank.

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
Ding.

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
Bobby Blackwolf

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000
brought on the ire of 4chan

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
this week by voicing his opinion on Twitter.

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000
He didn't really seem to care about

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000
it at first but he really

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000
lost it when they came for his blank.

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
Chatters you can help out

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000
by voicing your answer in our chat room

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000
live.vognetwork.com

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.000
You know I actually did

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000
miss the whole 4chan

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000
thing I don't even know

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000
It wasn't really that serious

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
Bobby had an opinion

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
and some folks disagreed with it.

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000
You know what 4chan is for? Rolling my eyes.

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000
And porn.

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000
Ding for me.

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000
Becky you good? You got an answer?

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
She's thinking.

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000
Peek over

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.000
Jamie show the iPad and get some help

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000
from the chatters. You have an answer

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
Alan?

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
He really lost it when they came

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
for his blank.

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
Am I supposed to say something now?

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
No no not yet because we need Becky

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000
to ding first.

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000
She's

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
Oh Becky will do

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000
great. Help her out Jamie. Feed her one of the

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
answers it'll be funny.

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
Does Becky not want to play?

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
Alright Becky doesn't want to play. Alright fine.

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
It'll be four of us.

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000
It's because Becky hasn't met Bobby.

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.000
She can't say it the same way.

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000
Well here we go anyway.

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
So Raven's

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
Wait let me make sure Mako got an answer in because I didn't even check.

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000
I usually check for that first.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
Here we go.

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000
Raven's Dolphin

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.000
The question is Bobby Blackwolf

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000
brought on the Ira 4chan this week by

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
voicing his opinion on Twitter. He didn't really seem

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000
to care at first but he really lost it when they

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
came for his

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000
Ban hammer. His ban hammer.

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.000
Good answer good

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000
answer. It's the only thing I could

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000
come up with. Makochan in chat says

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000
when they came for his

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
Anon membership card

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
I did not know Bobby was in

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
Anon but apparently he was. Alright

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000
let's go around and see if we've got any match.

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
Ban hammer or Anon membership card.

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
Loki what did you get when they came for his

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000
Fence. When they came for his

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
Fence. Not a match

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
if you've been following the recent drama online.

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000
No when they came for his Fence.

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000
Dark Sakura

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000
when they came for his Fence.

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000
When they came for his Fence.

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000
That's two for Fence. He really lost it

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000
when they came for his. Those damn kids

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000
and his Fence. Allen what did you say

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000
when they came for his.

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000
Anti-brony propaganda.

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:13.000
Anti-brony propaganda.

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
Oh damn it. Not a match.

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000
Not a match alright. And I said they

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
that he really lost it when they came for

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000
his Clicky pen.

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000
Clicky.

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:25.000
Clicky pen. I thought it was Clicky the pen.

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000
Also not a match.

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000
But it's a Clicky pen.

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:31.000
Alright. The score

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000
let's look at the leaderboard right now.

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000
Zero to zero.

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
Alrighty. Zero to zero.

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
Alright that's alright Ravensdorf and you

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
can make it all up on question number two out of four

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000
tonight. Alright here we go.

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
Question number two.

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000
Question number two

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000
is the cast

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
of Orange Lounge Radio

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000
was really appreciative

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000
that Becky baked brownies for their

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
500th episode.

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000
You know what would top this for our

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000
666th show though

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
piped up and said yeah

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
you should cook the blank.

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000
Ding.

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000
Becky baked brownies

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000
you know what would top

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000
though said Rob.

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
Loki piped up and said yeah

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000
you should cook the blank.

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000
Alright.

Mako's in as well. Raven you got an

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
answer? I do. Alright

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000
here we go. Loki piped up and said yeah

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000
you should cook the

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.000
ferret. Cook the ferret.

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
And Mako

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
Chan in chat said you

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
should cook the ferret.

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000
Oh

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
boy alright well

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.000
let's see what happens. It's

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.000
going to be a tie either way but let's see how many

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.000
points this may or may not earn them.

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.000
Loki yeah what did you say

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.000
yeah she should cook the

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:07.000
bacon el diablo. Bacon

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000
el diablo.

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.000
Great answer

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000
but not a match.

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:15.000
Alright. Dark

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.000
soccer. I did go for obvious

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.000
and say the ferret. The ferret did. Oh my

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
god. It's a

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000
score on the match game leaderboard.

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:25.000
One to one.

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
Ding ding ding ding.

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.000
More points than people usually get during this.

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.000
Alright excellent. Uh

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.000
Alan

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.000
she should cook the

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000
I think this still counts but my answer

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.000
was the bungee ferret. The

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000
bungee ferret. Let's go to the judges.

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:43.000
Alright the judges will allow it.

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:45.000
Two to two for the ferret.

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.000
Alright and lastly my answer

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
she should cook the

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000
Cylon occupied

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
caprica cake.

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
The Cylon

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
occupied caprica cake. Old

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
old joke. Alright there

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000
it is. Two

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
two though. That

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000
could be the highest score ever in the history of

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000
video game matches. I think our highest score was three

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000
to be honest. Was it? I think it was

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:11.000
three. There is still two questions

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000
to go. Here we go. There are two

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000
questions. There are two questions. Watch your

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.000
grammar drunkie.

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000
Shut up. Alright

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000
here we go. Oh it's a question about

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000
Ravenstaufen? You ready for it? I'm ready.

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.000
I'm ready. Jamie decided

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000
to mark the occasion

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000
of the 500th episode

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000
to give up coffee forever.

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
Lies. This is

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
make believe. I know. Jamie decided

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000
to mark the occasion of the 500th episode to give

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000
up coffee forever. She came

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
to episode 501

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000
and in a coffee deprived rage

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
instantly screamed into

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
the mic. First one

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000
to mention blank dies.

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
She came to episode

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000
501 and in a

coffee deprived rage

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.000
instantly screamed into the mic.

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.000
First one to mention

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
blank dies.

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000
I didn't think

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:17.000
of an answer for this one.

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000
You wrote it. I know right.

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000
First

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000
one to mention

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000
Ding. Alright here we go.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
Raven you got an answer? I do.

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
Alright here we go. She gave up

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
coffee on episode 500. She came to

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
episode 501 and in a coffee

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.000
depraved rage instantly screamed

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000
into the mic. First one to mention

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000
double shot mochaccino.

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
Double shot mochaccino

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
dies. That sounds amazing.

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
I want one. Mako

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
Chan in our chat room says first one

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000
to mention male chef

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000
dies. I was thinking about

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
Alright here we go. Let's go around the room

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
and see what

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
we got. If we got any matches.

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000
First one to mention Loki?

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000
I almost said male chef

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
but I said Propel instead. Propel

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000
first one to mention Propel

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
dies.

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
Do they even make Propel anymore?

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
Yes they do. Wow alright awesome.

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000
It's called like Propel Zero now or some shit.

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000
Alright Dark Sakura first one to

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.000
mention. Bro chef.

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000
Bro chef? Really?

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000
Oh my god.

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:31.000
Alright I think we're gonna count it. I honestly couldn't think

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:33.000
of anything else. Mako Chan pulls

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000
ahead three to two.

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
Alright Alan

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000
first one to mention

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000
Mocha Pinkberry.

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
Oh my god. Why does this not

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
exist? That was really close

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.000
to what Raven said but

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:49.000
I don't think it's close enough unfortunately. Why does this not

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
exist? I don't know. You should

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000
write Pinkberry.

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000
Alright and my answer was

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000
first one to mention. Why not?

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000
First

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
one to mention

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
Final Fantasy 11 dies.

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
Alright

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
not a match but one more

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000
question. One more question. So close.

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000
So close. Ravenstaufen you can do it.

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
I know. I have faith in you.

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
I have faith in you. I know. Alright.

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000
But what about the chatter?

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000
Alright here we go.

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.000
Question number four

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000
the last one Ravenstaufen your only

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
hope. Alright.

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
Loki was very happy with the

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
poster that Codeman drew

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
to celebrate episode 500 of the show.

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000
Upon careful

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000
examination of the poster though

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000
he exclaimed Rob I'm

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000
surprised he drew you as a World

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
of Warcraft fan and not

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000
as a fan of blank.

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
Rob I'm surprised he

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
drew you as a World of Warcraft fan

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
and not as a fan of blank.

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000
Oh that was

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000
really quick on all the hosts.

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000
I'm still waiting on MakoChan to

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000
ping in there in our chat

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
room at live.vognetware.com where some

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000
people are going to feed the answers right now.

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000
Loki very happy with the poster that

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
Codeman drew but

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
on careful examination of the poster

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
exclaimed Rob I'm surprised he didn't just draw you

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
as a fan of blank. Alright

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
MakoChan's got an answer. Ravenstaufen

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
I got one. Alright then here we go.

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
Rob I'm surprised he drew

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000
you as a World of Warcraft fan

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000
and not as a fan of

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
DDR 4th mix.

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000
DDR 4th mix.

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
Good answer. I was a fan of

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000
DDR 4. 4th plus to be

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000
specific but we'd let that slide.

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000
MakoChan in our chat room says

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000
I'm surprised he drew you as a World of Warcraft

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000
fan and not as a fan of

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000
Rocky Horror.

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000
Okay good good

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000
answer. Alright let's go around and see if

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000
there's a match. Loki

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000
surprised he drew you as a World of Warcraft

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
fan and not as a fan of

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000
Ni No Kuni's ending. Ni No Kuni's ending.

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000
Wait a minute.

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000
Alright.

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000
Not a match I'm sorry

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
to say. DarkSakura

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
I'm surprised he drew you as a World of

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
Warcraft fan and not as a fan of

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000
Para Para Paradise complete and kogal outfit.

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000
What?

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000
You'd be such a cute

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000
get it. You almost named the right

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
Bamani game to match with

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000
Raven's Dolphin but unfortunately

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
nope not gonna do it.

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
And I'll tell you what came with this is watching you play the damn

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
Abba game.

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
Alright.

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
I'm surprised he drew you as a World

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
of Warcraft fan and not as a fan

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000
of Miss Nude World 96.

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000
Miss Nude World

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000
96.

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
Oh classic

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
classic answer.

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
Rob I'm surprised he

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
drew you as a World of Warcraft fan and not as a fan of

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000
Hey I can be self

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000
deprecating here. My answer was

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
not as a fan of

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
surprise butt sex.

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
Goodnight ladies and gentlemen.

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
Oh shoot I apparently

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000
gave Codeman an idea. Uh oh.

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
What did you do? I have no

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
idea but I'm looking forward to it.

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
Alright.

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
Apparently Alan wins.

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000
Alright apparently Alan won. Alright

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
looking at the scoreboard it is

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
3 to 2 Raven's

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
Dolphin I'm sorry but you're a big fat

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000
loser tonight. I know.

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000
But thank you for playing. You lose

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
Goodnight. We still love you. Alright

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.000

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000
Laughter.

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
Rob you need to drink more often.

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
That's it you have

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
a requisite two

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
double shots. I'm actually

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
under straight orders from my doctor not

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
to drink and I'm being a

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
very naughty boy tonight but

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000
what can you do? Should we get out the paddle?

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
No I did a second shot.

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
Laughter.

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
Alright and they're double shots but

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
hey who cares.

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
They only live once right Rob?

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
Alright thank you for playing along with match

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
game tonight everybody we hope you had fun.

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
Alright

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
Megachan what do we give

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
Megachan for winning tonight? My love.

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
Megachan if you have

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
something you want to plug I have a feeling I know

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
what it might be but send me a private message

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000
and you can get a free plug for your Twitter

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
for your podcast whatever you want.

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000
But not a butt plug. No definitely

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
not that. Alright

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
let's see moving on it's

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000
time for the mailbag. Ah crap.

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000
Dark soccer is always

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
excited to get into the mailbag and read some emails

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
that you guys send to mailbag

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
at orange lounge radio

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000
dot com. So dark

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000
soccer if you wouldn't mind jumping

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
to the emailbag there. We did get a lot

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
of spam like that arrived after

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
the real email. Oh hooray. I deleted

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
well I didn't delete it but we need to delete

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000
a lot of old email.

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
Are we ready? Shall I do this?

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
Yep yep. Hey O-L-R

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
just thought I'd write in and respond

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
to that email about the graphic violence

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000
of Bioshock Infinite. Ooh.

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000
Not spoiling any major

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000
plot points here but Booker's history

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000
is full of violence. It's actually a

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
major part of his character that he has done many

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
terrible things in the past and has

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
a very violent history.

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
Whenever you perform one of those brutal finishing

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
moves with your sky hook Elizabeth will always

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
audibly shudder at the act.

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000
As you get deeper in the game Elizabeth

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000
questions the need for so much violence from both

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000
sides of the conflict and wonders if it's really

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000
helping anybody. And that way

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000
I think it's the approach to graphic violence is

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000
done in a way that serves the story and the

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000
characters. Now there is

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
some gratuitous stuff in there but I'm a little tired

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000
of the comparisons to Call of Duty or

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000
that these were changes that made to

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.000
these were changes

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.000
these changes were made to appeal to that

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
audience. I played a couple of

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000
Call of Duty games and the violence

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.000
though not the plot always seemed to ride

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:57.000
closer to the side of realistic and not hyper

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.000
real as it is in the Bioshock games

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000
including Infinite where you can electrocute someone

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
to stun them then blast their entire head off.

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
Dude I need to play that.

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
You can do that in Bioshock Infinite

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000
As we saw in Bioshock Infinite

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000
Yes, it's awesome.

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
In the Call of Duty games

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:15.000
we rest our case

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.000
In the Call of Duty games I played I don't remember

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000
any heads popping off like quarks

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000
but I did only play single player mode so

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000
who knows. My point is Bioshock

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.000
games have always been violent

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
and they've always been first person shooters

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
so I don't think the game had to compromise

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000
anything for sales or to appeal to a certain crowd

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:33.000
and in fact would only have been

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.000
compromising if it toned itself down.

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.000
That was all that was on my mind

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.000
congrats on an amazing 500

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000
episodes even if you

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.000
guys don't think it's such a big deal anymore

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:45.000
it actually really

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000
is. I'm just glad I've

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:49.000
been listening for the last 200 or so

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:51.000
that's from Flaco Jones.

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000
We don't care if you've been listening since episode 1

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.000
or if this is your very first episode

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:57.000
we say welcome aboard and thanks for being a part of the

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
family. Yeah, you're totally awesome.

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:01.000
So

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:03.000
moving on

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:05.000
Hi guys!

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.000
First and foremost congratulations on your

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.000
500th episode. I think it's

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
amazing that you've been going for over

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000
10 years. You have an unshakable love

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:15.000
of video games and a cast iron army

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.000
of dedicated fans

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:19.000
to...dude you guys made a cast iron? I didn't know that.

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:21.000
Okay.

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
So here's something.

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000
I think he's frying you.

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000
Will you fry us an egg?

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
I bet you get really hot on

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:31.000
warm days. So here's something

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:33.000
that may interest you. Do you remember me talking

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.000
about Project Possum a while

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
ago? When the Inside

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
Xbox UK team were given the

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000
sack, they went off on Kickstarter

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000
to start their own show about video games.

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.000
Well, they finished the pilot and that's not what you

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
call your average video game show.

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000
It's called Thank You For Playing

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
and you can find it at ThankYouForPlaying.com

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000
there are dashes in between each word.

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000
It's structured much like a game

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
letting you view the features in order

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.000
that you want and has unlockables in the form of extra

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000
goodies and editorials, expanding

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
on the themes touched in the videos.

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
The plot's all about multiplayer

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.000
and I really recommend you take a look.

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:09.000
I thought it was really interesting and

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
hope to see a lot more from them soon.

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000
Just like I hope to keep hearing from you guys

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000
for many years to come, take care and once again

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000
congratulations, Picaruno.

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
Thank you

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
for your support.

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:23.000
And remember, if you can't be an athlete, be an

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
athletic supporter.

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
I'm sorry, this is my favorite line from Greece.

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.000
Okay, this is an OLR PSA

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000
from CatastrophicMoggie.

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.000
Oh, it's my friend Moggie who I chat with

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000
every day on Steam. Come on guys,

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
I think after 500 episodes we can give the whole

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000
Loki in a tingle costume thing a rest.

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000
He might like that.

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.000
Instead for the next

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.000
500 we need to get Loki

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000
in a kitty costume.

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:49.000
A kitty costume?

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.000
And you have to say

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000
meow, that's right.

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
It has to be a kitty in costume.

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
I don't think he'd do that.

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000
That's worse than tingle.

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:01.000
He sent an image to you but it didn't embed.

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:03.000
P.S. I would have

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:05.000
left an audio message but Rob is a meanie.

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
Even if I stayed up late enough

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.000
I wouldn't be able to Skype after the disaster

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
that was last time. So I guess you don't

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000
get any congratulations from Moggie.

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:17.000
Send an MP3.

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.000
Send an MP3.

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:21.000
Dude, you talked to me on Steam.

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:23.000
Just attach me a file or something.

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000
Excuse me.

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
Is that it or is there more?

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:31.000
No, there's one more.

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:33.000
I had an oddly mimosa red velvet brownie flavored burp.

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.000
Imagine that.

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000
Imagine that.

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000
Alright, here's the last one.

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000
Hello is the one and only

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.000
often imitated, never duplicated DDR dollar bill.

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000
I just wanted to write and congratulate you guys

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000
on your 500th episode.

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000
To the last 500 episodes is something truly

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.000
of an accomplishment. Not just for the fact

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:53.000
that most podcasts end in a few years

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000
but that the show keeps the same

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000
basic formula without getting stale.

02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.000
That you also survived in a market where some

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000
have turned to sponsors and subscription fees

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.000
to even make a presence

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:05.000
is even more of a reason to celebrate.

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000
Well, thank you.

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
I'm all broke.

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.000
Not everyone can podcast.

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:13.000
True, we all wish to be heard but it takes something

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000
special to keep going for a long time

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000
and not just make it into a small hobby that you grow

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000
out of. It's a labor of love, one that

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000
the O.L. Army slash family

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000
have grown to be a part of, whether they

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.000
hang around, come back once in a while

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
when they can, or just move on.

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.000
If I could, I'd just like to take a moment

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000
to say why I do recommend your show to other listeners.

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.000
One, the host.

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:35.000
Why, thank you. Every show you have

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:37.000
three amazing, entertaining, intelligent, yet human

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000
hosts who talk about gaming

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.000
that can appeal to the hardcore fans as well as

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000
the casuals. Just to let you know I'm really from another planet

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.000
once a month.

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000
They are

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.000
people who actually do game as part of

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000
their lives, not game because it's their

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000
job to. We talk about gaming like

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
fans who talk about sports or comics or

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:57.000
sci-fi with that casual yet knowledgeable

02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:59.000
flair. And when they speak about

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:01.000
gaming news, they do it on a dual level of

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000
professionalism that gives a great analysis

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:05.000
and yet keeps it simple and fun.

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:07.000
Can I say something really

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.000
quick about the sponsor thing? Because we have

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000
a lot of friend podcasters that do

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
the sponsor thing and we've even, you know,

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
we have had donations before in the past

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000
and so forth and I just want to say, like, there's

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000
nothing wrong with podcasters who want to get

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000
sponsors because, contrary to popular belief,

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:23.000
this shit ain't free for us to do.

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
True. It is costing us money

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000
to do, but that's, you know, it's okay.

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000
We pay the money because

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.000
it's our hobby. It's like, you know,

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000
it's like the tax you pay to

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:35.000
your club, you know,

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
your dues or whatever.

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
For us, that's fine.

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000
And, you know, I have no problem with people that

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:43.000
want to get sponsors to offset the cost of

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000
hosting, offset the cost of, you know,

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000
producing the show

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000
and so forth. But I do start to

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:51.000
get into a problem when, you know,

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:53.000
and I can think of particular

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.000
individual podcast things that have

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000
gone up saying, we need

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000
$30,000 to do this

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000
podcast, this one

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000
podcast because we're going to rent a studio

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.000
and we have to travel to conventions

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000
and this and this and this. And

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.000
I'm sorry, but like,

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000
you know, if they can get it and the listeners

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.000
support them enough, that's

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.000
great, I guess. But I'm

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000
just kind of like, you ain't fooling

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000
anybody. I could tell you how much it costs to

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.000
do a podcast and it's not as much as

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:23.000
you're telling people it is.

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000
I mean, we've had

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000
generous donations in the past. I mean,

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000
like what Kristen did.

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000
I mean, we would not have

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:33.000
new equipment if not for her.

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.000
But I just want to be clear because I have very

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:37.000
several peer podcasters that do

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000
raise money through sponsors

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000
and so forth.

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.000
We've got the ads on the site. We have been super

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000
effing lucky that our website

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000
has been donated very generously

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.000
for many years or

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000
else we would probably have to turn to that

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:53.000
too because that could get very expensive.

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000
So, I just, you know,

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000
I just want to clear the air and make

02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000
sure that's understood.

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.000
So, and I've

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:03.000
sat up for, I mean,

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.000
just on my own hours working on

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000
graphics and stuff

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.000
for, not just for Orange Nails, but

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:11.000
for VOG in general, you know.

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:13.000
We've all put a lot of time and effort into this.

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000
Uh, DDR dollar bill in chat says

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.000
I think the best way to put it is

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.000
people don't like to be shilled.

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:21.000
And I agree with that. And I would not do that to

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000
the audience. You guys are far too intelligent for me

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000
to sit here and say, please send me to all these

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000
exotic places so I can

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000
talk about them with you. You know,

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.000
like, I'm not, I'm not

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000
going to do that. You guys are... And we're not doing ads for the

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:35.000
man-grate. Yeah.

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.000
I'm sorry, I have, you know,

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000
my overwhelming love

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000
for, uh, Greg Proops.

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I do laugh every time he does

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.000
the ad for the man-grate. Anyhow, I apologize to interrupt

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000
the email. Okay. To the show.

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:49.000
This show, while keeping the basic format,

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000
always finds a way to grow and yet

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000
never loses its focus. Yes, they go off on

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000
tangents and just Pinkberry trips to Disneyland.

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000
Let's go get Pinkberry. Okay. Trips to Disneyland

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000
and other aspects of their

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000
daily lives. But I find that to be the greatest

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:03.000
asset because you, the listener, participate in

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000
the show in any fashion. It's so laid back

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.000
and friendly that you do not feel they are

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000
corporate shills. If you are right

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000
or wrong, you can discuss this openly.

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000
And even when it gets heated, it's still

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:15.000
more personal than some shows where the sense

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000
of keeping it professional loses that intimacy

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000
that's required for some difficult and passionate

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000
topics. Also,

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000
each segment does include something for the listener,

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.000
whether it's mailbag to submit your letters,

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:27.000
and I actually do enjoy reading the email.

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.000
I'll just throw on a hissy fit

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000
just for fun. Um, Skyplines

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000
to call in even when

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000
even if just wish

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000
to get on and say, what's up?

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.000
The classic game of the week, my favorite part,

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000
why, thank you. We used to do the

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:43.000
website of the week.

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.000
There was website of the week and the advice,

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000
Star Soccer's advice column.

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000
I could still give advice.

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000
Um, uh,

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000
like, uh,

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000
I don't know.

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000
Pay your hoes or you might get cut.

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000
There's

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000
Star Soccer's advice.

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:03.000
Was it never bet with a Sicilian when death is

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000
on the line?

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000
Finish the email. Okay.

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000
Fugal question of the week.

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000
It's always welcoming listener input, which

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000
leads into

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000
dot, dot, dot, dot, the audience.

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
That was number three. The chatroom is

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000
full of people who often come up with amazing

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000
nuggets of joy. It's rarely

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000
censored, meaning you'd really have to be

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000
a dick to have the mighty ban hammer cast upon

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.000
yourself. But like, um,

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000
but like a good wrestling federation,

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000
the show wouldn't be much without the loyal fans

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:33.000
who have helped keep the

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000
energy going. Friendly and

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000
often hilarious, they are never ignored

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:39.000
by the host. I'm sorry if this

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000
went on a bit more, but it was just something to

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:43.000
note. Here's to another 500 episodes.

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000
I wonder how the future of gaming would look in another

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000
11 years. Tune in and find out. Wink.

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000
Oh, that was

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000
sweet. That was a very nice email. I'm gonna do

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000
a quick sweep. That

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000
was it. I agree. The audience is

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000
the best part.

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
We love you guys. For dinner.

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000
Speaking of which.

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000
No, seriously. And Black Wolf and chat

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000
actually follows up with

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000
that. I don't think we have anybody banned.

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:09.000
I don't think we've

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.000
had to ban anybody yet.

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000
That's not a request or

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000
a contest. No, no. Don't challenge

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000
this. Bammers.

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000
I've kicked people out of chat

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000
for being dicks. Well, but we haven't

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000
banned anybody. Most people

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000
learn their lesson. Yeah.

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000
I've smacked a few people around with a giant trout.

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
Anyhow. Speaking

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000
of audience. Mako Chan has

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000
her plug ready to go that

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000
she won for Match Game. Do I even

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:37.000
have to mention this? I somehow knew it would

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000
be this. Anime Jam session

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000
on Tuesdays here at the Voice of Geeks Network.

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000
9.30 PM Eastern is when the pre-show

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000
starts at 9.15.

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000
Excuse me, it's the pre-show at 9.15. 9.30 is the

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.000
show. Mako Chan gets to

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000
choose the pre-show music this week. Oh

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000
shit. And happy 500th.

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000
Yes, listen to Anime Jam session. It's a good time.

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:57.000
Totally a good time.

02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.000
So, alrighty.

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.000
Let's see.

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000
Is that it for emails?

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:05.000
We're done, huh? You want to know something? I've actually

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000
started getting back into

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000
watching some old school series now. Oh yeah?

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000
Because Dan's little brother

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:13.000
Mason, who is a teenager.

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.000
He was posting on Facebook

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000
Oh, teenagers.

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000
I'm bored and I don't know any

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000
I was like, go back and watch some classic anime, dude.

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:23.000
Get to the roots of it.

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.000
You know, go watch some Yamato

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:27.000
or some Gachamon.

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.000
Alright. Go 80s style and watch

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000
Bubblegum Crisis.

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000
Let's do the FUs of the Week.

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000
And Minecraft Server.

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.000
FUs of the Week time.

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.000
Here is punishment.

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:49.000
Here.

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:51.000
This is fucked up.

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000
Yeah, we did

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.000
ban the song on the show.

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000
And we banned a website. We banned

02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000
Politary. DarkSakura, your FU, please.

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000
My FU goes to

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000
the hoe bag who was driving behind me

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.000
in the Mercedes, trying to do her

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000
makeup while tailgating me.

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000
It would have been incredibly

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:11.000
hilarious if I had brake checked you

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:13.000
and you completely ruined the back end of my car

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:15.000
so that I get a new car and

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000
you have to pay for it. Just saying.

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000
Don't do your makeup while you drive

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000
and get off your damn phone and pull up your pants.

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000
Loki, any FUs? Get off my lawn.

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.000
I guess an FU to the driver that I encountered

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000
last week when I was leaving the show

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.000
about to enter onto the freeway

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000
when I had a guy pass

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000
me on the right in the

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000
in the meat, like actually off the

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000
road, pass me on the right and then

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000
cut across into the next lane

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.000
to not go on the

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.000
freeway. I don't even know why he was doing that.

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.000
It's just stupid. He could have just gone to the

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.000
left and changed lanes.

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000
But no, he had to pass me at the same time too.

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000
For no reason.

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000
And then, what else? Oh.

02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.000
And to my co-workers for not wanting to play

02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:59.000
games during lunch because they're, you know,

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:01.000
they will flake on me unless

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000
we get all four people to play, including

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000
myself. And a lot of times we can't do

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000
that because, you know, my boss will be

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.000
gone or something and they don't

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000
want to play games with just me because I kick their ass.

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:13.000
So they need to...

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:15.000
But you're so humble about it. So FU'd at being good?

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:17.000
Yeah, I'm just too good

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:19.000
for them, unfortunately.

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.000
Um, my FU of the week

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:23.000
goes to car repairs

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:25.000
and the bills that go with them.

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:27.000
Oh my god, robbery!

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:29.000
So much money!

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:31.000
And everything breaks at once!

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:33.000
Not okay.

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:35.000
We all gave FU to traffic-related things.

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:37.000
How appropriate for our 500th episode.

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:39.000
We always freaking complain about

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:41.000
drivers. The hell.

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000
You want to throw out a nephew to cars, too,

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:45.000
while you're at it?

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.000
You can throw out a nephew to Power Rangers.

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:49.000
Oh god, yes.

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.000
Shane might take issue to this.

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.000
FU to Power Rangers

02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:55.000
Megaforce, which my son wants to

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:57.000
watch constantly and my brains

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.000
are dribbling at my ears.

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:01.000
It is horrifying. The acting

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.000
makes me want to strangle my own brain.

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.000
By the way, Megaforce is

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:07.000
playing a brand new 3DS game

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.000
coming this year.

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:11.000
Aw, Shane will be offended by that

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:13.000
and that makes me happy.

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:15.000
I do still want to watch the

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:17.000
Japanese version because I do like the Sentai series.

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:21.000
Shane and Chad's like,

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000
why FU to Power Rangers?

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:25.000
Because she's a mom

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:27.000
and little boys watch

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:29.000
Power Rangers, Shane, not 30-year-olds.

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:31.000
But Shane said that Megaforce is pretty bad.

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:33.000
Oh god,

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:35.000
I wish I was still a 30-year-old.

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:37.000
So if

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:39.000
the Power Rangers fan of Chad

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.000
is saying it's bad,

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.000
then you are fully justified.

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:45.000
All kidding aside,

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:47.000
we've got a couple more stories for you guys quickly

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:49.000
and then we're going to go to the Skype line

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.000
at 1-877-GAME-OLR

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:53.000
There might be a few of you that want to call in tonight

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:55.000
so we'll get to that shortly,

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.000
but first a couple quick stories.

02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:59.000
Alright, so Nintendo

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:01.000
totally figuring out ways to revitalize the Wii U.

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.000
Not sure if this is going to be one of those ways,

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:05.000
but they have a new patent.

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000
A patent that allows them

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:09.000
to use the Wii remote

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:11.000
to remotely control mobile devices

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:13.000
like a robot.

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000
That's what they have in the picture.

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:17.000
They have a robot with a Wii

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:19.000
remote in it.

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:21.000
Rob 2.0?

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:23.000
Or as the joke I made on Facebook,

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:25.000
Rob U?

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:27.000
And it will.

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:29.000
And it will.

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.000
What the hell would a Rob 2.0 do?

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:33.000
The first Rob was a really

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:35.000
niche, stupid thing.

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:37.000
It just played Gyromite, right?

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.000
There was one other. Stack'em?

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:41.000
It would run up to people

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.000
that are playing the Wii games

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000
not standing up,

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.000
because you're supposed to be active,

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:49.000
and punch you in the balls.

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:51.000
Get off your couch. Boom!

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:53.000
I need one of those

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:55.000
to motivate me to exercise more.

02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.000
Can I get a Rob U to punch me in the balls

02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:59.000
when I'm not, you know, exercising?

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:01.000
Perhaps.

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:03.000
Wouldn't that be awesome?

02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:05.000
Well, speaking of Nintendo devices,

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:07.000
the must-have, most important

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:09.000
application on the 3DS has

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:11.000
been updated. That's right.

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:13.000
SwapNote has a new version

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:15.000
that's available now. You can go get that

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:17.000
right there in the little eShop.

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:19.000
Get the free update, and there's a note

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:21.000
that you should have got reminding you of that.

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:23.000
I've added some new OLR listeners recently,

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:25.000
and I gotta say, it's like a SwapNote resurgence.

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:27.000
My little blue light is on almost every day.

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.000
It's great. Some of the new features.

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:31.000
You can now use a

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:33.000
different color on each page of a message,

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:35.000
so you don't just have to use black anymore.

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000
You can do photos

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.000
and audio while you write.

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:41.000
You don't have to import them from the SD card.

02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:43.000
You can filter notes by who

02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:45.000
sent them if you want to find a note from somebody.

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:47.000
You can delete multiple notes at once.

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:49.000
You can

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:51.000
see how many replies

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.000
a note has received, and you can

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:55.000
slide the CirclePad left to

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000
slow down writing and drawing animations

02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:59.000
from notes, or use

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:01.000
CirclePad right to speed it up.

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:03.000
It's like a speed up, slow down.

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:05.000
Very cool.

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.000
Basically trying to modernize SwapNote

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.000
a little bit with some functionality

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:11.000
that you kind of go, wow, that wasn't there before.

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.000
Nope.

02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:15.000
But it's there now.

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:17.000
All right. That brings us to the Skype line.

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:19.000
1877 Game OLR.

02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:21.000
Our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:23.000
If you want to give us a call on this,

02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:25.000
our 500th episode to talk about whatever,

02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:27.000
we will take a few calls until

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:29.000
we decide it's time to end the show or the calls stop

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:31.000
coming in.

02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:33.000
Well, there's a whole

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:35.000
other plate, huh?

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:37.000
Oh, boy. All right. So,

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:39.000
we are going to take the calls right now.

02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:41.000
I'm also going to bring up Twitter topics.

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:43.000
I don't know, Loki, if you have any last minute stories over there.

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:45.000
Not yet.

02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:47.000
Power Rangers Megaforce game,

02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:49.000
that's all I had.

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:51.000
Oh, you were trying to incorporate things.

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:53.000
All right. Well, lucky for us, we're getting saved

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:55.000
with a phone call. So, let's get to it.

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:57.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000
This is CodeMan.

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:01.000
CodeMan, what is up?

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.000
What's up, man?

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.000
We are loving these posters you made, just so you know.

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:07.000
Well, no problem, man.

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000
I hope I captured

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.000
OrangeLoungeRadio as much as I could.

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:13.000
Uh, yeah.

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:15.000
I have to ask, is the little kitten on the bottom,

02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:17.000
is that Midna?

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:19.000
It could be Midna, or it could be Shirmi.

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.000
I wanted to kind of

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.000
go both ways

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:25.000
because, you know, Shirmi was a big

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:27.000
part of OrangeLoungeRadio, and

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.000
we all, as all listeners,

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:31.000
miss

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000
her as much as

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:35.000
we can, you know.

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:37.000
She was a huge part of

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:39.000
OrangeLoungeRadio. And she was huge.

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:41.000
It's an every cat.

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:43.000
Yeah, it's an every cat.

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:45.000
I was going to say, because it looks kind of like Midna.

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:47.000
Do you have a JPEG that you can forward me

02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:49.000
of this? Well, I think Dark Sakura,

02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:51.000
do we talk about the album art thing?

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:53.000
Yeah. Is that going to happen?

02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:55.000
Awesome!

02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:57.000
Good, the listeners can know what we're talking about because

02:48:57.000 --> 02:48:59.000
it's going to be the new album art to the show, and it's fantastic!

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:01.000
And I thank you

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:03.000
for, I got your message from Dropbox.

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:05.000
Thank you, I will be printing out a copy for my wall.

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:07.000
Yes, and you can, um,

02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:09.000
you can actually, if, if, uh,

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:11.000
Loki wants a JPEG,

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:13.000
you can probably just, uh, you know, switch

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:15.000
that over to a JPEG and then just send it to him.

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:17.000
Or whatever, it doesn't matter. Is it, like, just the full 300

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.000
DPI PSD?

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:21.000
Yeah, it's, well, no, it's a PDF.

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:23.000
It's 18 by 24.

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:25.000
You can open it up in Illustrator,

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:27.000
because I did it all in Illustrator.

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:29.000
Um, and you should be able to just

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:31.000
export it as a JPEG.

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:33.000
Alright, you nerds,

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:35.000
I want to talk about video games.

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:37.000
I'm actually going to resize it for the frame I have.

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:39.000
Alright. Well, Codeman,

02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:41.000
uh, what did you, what did you actually call in to talk about tonight?

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:43.000
I wanted to just call in and

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:45.000
congratulate you guys on 500 shows,

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:47.000
basically. I, I, I

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:49.000
started listening, um, kind of

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:51.000
at the end of my high school,

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:53.000
uh, my senior year of high school,

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:55.000
all the way through college, up

02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:57.000
until now. And so that, that

02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000
Christ, how old are you now?

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:01.000
I am 27. I'll be 28 in,

02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:03.000
uh, September, so. Oh my god!

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.000
You know, you

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:07.000
realize I'm going to be 37 on

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:09.000
next Friday, right?

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:11.000
I'm just, I'm just, I,

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:13.000
you know, and, and like I said in the chat room

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:15.000
earlier, um, I said if this show ever dies,

02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:17.000
a piece of my heart will die.

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:19.000
Because this show has

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.000
been like, I think a lot of the listeners has

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:23.000
gotten me through a lot of hard times,

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:25.000
um, you know, in past,

02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:27.000
past issues in my life and stuff like that.

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:29.000
And just sitting down and like,

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:31.000
when I'm at work, and

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:33.000
I'm listening to you guys, it just, it brings a

02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.000
positivity to, to my day

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.000
that I didn't have before. So

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:39.000
that, that's one of the reasons why I called it.

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:41.000
I just wanted to tell you guys that you have

02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:43.000
done so many good things

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:45.000
to a lot of people that are, that

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:47.000
are out there listening to you every,

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:49.000
every Sunday or on the podcast

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:51.000
feed throughout the week. And,

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:53.000
and I know that every time somebody listens

02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:55.000
to you guys, there is a positive

02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:57.000
jokingly feeling

02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:59.000
of like, they're in the same room as you

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:01.000
guys and we're just all friends. And that's,

02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:03.000
and that's amazing. Don't make me cry,

02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:05.000
Code Man. Don't do it. Don't do it.

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:07.000
Well,

02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:09.000
I have to tell you too

02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:11.000
that just in the fact that we've been talking

02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:13.000
over the last month worth of shows,

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:15.000
it's really nice to have a colleague

02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:17.000
who listens to, you know,

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:19.000
it's, it's been kind of, it's just been

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:21.000
really cool chatting with you and, you know,

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:23.000
sort of exchanging, you know, not just

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:25.000
the video game stuff, but having

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:27.000
the design thing in common too.

02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:29.000
Well, and, and Code Man, let me say this,

02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:31.000
and I'm sure it goes for

02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:33.000
Dark Sakura and Loki as well, because I know

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:35.000
we've had, we've all had these very difficult

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:37.000
shows. This show has helped

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:39.000
us get through a lot of hard times

02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:41.000
as well. Like, you know, I'll

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.000
talk about myself since I have the mic right now,

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:45.000
but, you know, a few years ago, I had a near

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:47.000
death experience and that was very,

02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:49.000
you know,

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:51.000
very humbling in a way. And,

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:53.000
and there's a lot of jokes

02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:55.000
about, I don't want to turn 30. I don't want to turn

02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:57.000
30, 30. I might as well be dead if I'm gonna be

02:51:57.000 --> 02:51:59.000
30. Well, I, I almost did die at

02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:01.000
29. So, to make it to

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:03.000
30, now I'm like, being

02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:05.000
30 is fucking rad.

02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:07.000
And it really is, like, it's, it's awesome.

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:09.000
I was just saying, earlier, when I turned 30, I stopped

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:11.000
giving a crap. Exactly. You just kind of

02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:13.000
learned all that. So, you know, this show

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:15.000
helped me through a lot of that

02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:17.000
as well. You gave me tequila

02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:19.000
and told me not to think about it.

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:23.000
So. Yes, but, no,

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:25.000
that's, that's basically what I called in. I mean,

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:27.000
as far as video games go, I mean,

02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:29.000
I've ever, I've been, I'm still

02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:31.000
struggling through Tomb Raider. I,

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:33.000
I don't know, Rob, you've been playing it too,

02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:35.000
I think, and I, I don't know, I just,

02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:37.000
I haven't gotten to pick it up again.

02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:39.000
When are we playing the very average

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:41.000
multiplayer that I, I, I, I shouldn't

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:43.000
razz it because I haven't tried it yet, but when are we gonna

02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:45.000
give it a try? Uh, I don't know.

02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:47.000
Alright. You know, anyway, yeah, I, I,

02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:49.000
I, you know, and then, and then all, I mean,

02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:51.000
all kinds of video games out

02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:53.000
right now that are just, I don't know, just

02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:55.000
eating me up. And, like I, like I mentioned before,

02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:57.000
I have a daughter, so I, most of the time, I don't even

02:52:57.000 --> 02:52:59.000
get to play video games, but, you know, it,

02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:01.000
it, when I do, I, I try to sit down for,

02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:03.000
like, just long periods of time

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:05.000
and play video games, but, uh,

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:07.000
but yes, I'll let you guys go and get another

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:09.000
caller in here, but, um, because it is your 500th

02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:11.000
show, and I'm sure a bunch of people want to call in,

02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:13.000
but, um, I just want to say

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:15.000
congratulations, guys, and I hope you enjoy the,

02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:17.000
the poster. I, I put so much

02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:19.000
heart and, and just

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:21.000
stuff into it that, because I want you guys

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:23.000
to understand how much

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:25.000
you guys mean to me, and how

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:27.000
much you mean to all of your fans

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:29.000
and all of your, your, your

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:31.000
listeners that are out there, all around

02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:33.000
the United States, and I just wanted to kind of

02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:35.000
put that all in a poster, and I didn't even

02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:37.000
capture all of it, um, and-

02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:39.000
Code Man, we talked about the crying thing, don't do it.

02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:41.000
Hey, you better cry, it's a 500th show, come on, Bob.

02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:43.000
Maybe

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:45.000
when Rob drinks more, he'll cry. I'm gonna make you

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:47.000
cry. Oh, Rob, is he,

02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:49.000
is he an emotional drunk? Because I,

02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:51.000
because I am. No, I'm just loud. But,

02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:53.000
um, I, and horny

02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:55.000
apparently, if these other stories are to be believed.

02:53:55.000 --> 02:53:57.000
Oh, you can't spin the bottle. Oh, Jesus Christ.

02:53:57.000 --> 02:53:59.000
It was hilarious. That was, that was

02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:01.000
by the way, um, Shane reminded me, that's where

02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:03.000
Dunk came from. Oh, no.

02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:05.000
Alright, look, uh, Code Man,

02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:07.000
thank you so much, and I'm, I'm so glad

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:09.000
everybody gets to see your talent now in

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:11.000
our album art, and the fact that that is

02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:13.000
listener created, I mean, Jamie

02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:15.000
did, did great work beforehand for, for

02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:17.000
a previous era of the show, but, you know,

02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:19.000
this show really is about the listeners, and,

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:21.000
and so that the listeners could contribute to that,

02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:23.000
and the way you capture that by having

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:25.000
everybody's name in there,

02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:27.000
or, I should say, not everybody, but a good chunk of the people.

02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:29.000
That was a great touch. That was a great

02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:31.000
touch. I loved it. So, that was

02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:33.000
my favorite part. Well, it's, it's, it's, wherever

02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:35.000
every gamer has a voice. Absolutely.

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:37.000
It's not, yeah, it's, it's not only,

02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:39.000
you know, about the hosts

02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:41.000
that are on the show, but it's about the people that could

02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:43.000
participate in the chat room, and, you

02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:45.000
know, give a voice to the actual

02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:47.000
podcast itself. So,

02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:49.000
I want, I want to thank you guys for, for

02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:51.000
doing so much for everybody, and

02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:53.000
just thank you. That's all I can say.

02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:55.000
Thank you. Are you guys still doing the

02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:57.000
down for maintenance show?

02:54:57.000 --> 02:54:59.000
We are!

02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:01.000
Yeah, we, we have taken

02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:03.000
a couple of weekends off due to

02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:05.000
just, just really busy,

02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:07.000
busy lives. I've been doing a lot of graphics

02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:09.000
for people on YouTube, and I've just been really,

02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:11.000
really, really busy, so,

02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:13.000
but other than that, yeah, we're still on,

02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:15.000
we're on Stitcher now, which is

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:17.000
awesome. Nice.

02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:19.000
And iTunes is kind of

02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:21.000
fuzzy, because we, we're not

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:23.000
running the kind of server that

02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:25.000
iTunes accepts, so,

02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:27.000
God, I hate, this is why iTunes is

02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:29.000
gonna, anyway, rabble, rabble.

02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:31.000
But, look, look them

02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:33.000
up at least on Stitcher, right? Down for maintenance.

02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:35.000
We do have a, we do have a website, though, now.

02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:39.000
Please. www.thedfmpodcast.com

02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:41.000
Alright, check it out. It's a great show.

02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:43.000
You know, probably the most ultimate compliment

02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:45.000
we get on this show, and I'm not saying this

02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:47.000
is necessarily true of your show, but

02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:49.000
I, I get this so much, is that, you know,

02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:51.000
you guys helped inspire me,

02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:53.000
you guys showed me that anybody can really do

02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:55.000
this, and that I can, I can do this, too,

02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:57.000
and that, that is like the greatest compliment

02:55:57.000 --> 02:55:59.000
when we see these other shows

02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:01.000
arise of our listenerships. It's awesome.

02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:03.000
So. It's one of the reasons why we did it.

02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:05.000
Thank you so much. Alright, buddy, I'm gonna let you go

02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:07.000
so we can get more calls. Alright, man, well,

02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:09.000
you guys enjoy five rounds of the show, and I'm

02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:11.000
gonna go to bed, cause I'm sleepy.

02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:13.000
Good night. Good night. Bye-bye.

02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:15.000
Alright, I'll talk to you guys later. Bye.

02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:17.000
Code man. Great call. Thank you.

02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:19.000
Even if you're gonna make me cry. Alright, listen.

02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:21.000
I was feeling a little sniffly. The phone is

02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:23.000
ringing off the hook, so let's get to another call.

02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:25.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:27.000
Hola. Bienvenidos a Orange Lounge Radio.

02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:29.000
Are you muted?

02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:31.000
I see you.

02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:33.000
Hello. One more time.

02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:35.000
Come in, Tokyo. We don't hear you.

02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:37.000
Alright.

02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:39.000
Echo 123 to test your

02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:41.000
connection, folks. I think he's off

02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:43.000
at the esthetician.

02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:45.000
Well, I'll bring up that joke.

02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:47.000
Well, let's try another call. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:49.000
Who's this? Hey, this is Brad from

02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:51.000
Pod Culture. Oh, and we see him.

02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:53.000
We see him. It's Brad from Pod Culture. What's on

02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:55.000
your mind, buddy? Oh, just calling

02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:57.000
to say congratulations on 500,

02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:59.000
guys. Thank you so much.

02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:01.000
You're not that far behind.

02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:03.000
Pod Culture's been going quite a while

02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:05.000
itself, hasn't it?

02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:07.000
In our

02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:09.000
eighth year, I guess. Yeah, that's something.

02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:11.000
That's something. That's amazing.

02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:13.000
You and I have the same color microphone I just

02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:15.000
realized with the little...

02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:17.000
Gee, I wonder why. I know.

02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:19.000
You've done a lot to help this show out over the years,

02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:21.000
Pod Culture, from getting us drunk to

02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:23.000
getting us heard. And thank you for

02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:25.000
all of the discs full of Doctor Who

02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:27.000
you've sent me in the past.

02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:29.000
Oh, no problem. No problem. I'm glad

02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:31.000
to do it. But hey,

02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:33.000
without you guys, you know,

02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:35.000
I don't think we would have lasted as long as we

02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:37.000
have, and thanks for the

02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:39.000
inviting us into the

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:41.000
Vogue community. Oh,

02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:43.000
duh. Happy to have you.

02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:45.000
We knew when we were starting...

02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:47.000
We knew we wanted to do something that was not

02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:49.000
just games, but a celebration of everything

02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:51.000
geek, and some of our

02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:53.000
favorite shows came to mind, and absolutely,

02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:55.000
you were near the top

02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:57.000
of that list. You were seriously up there.

02:57:57.000 --> 02:57:59.000
Well, thank you. But

02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:01.000
congratulations, and I'm gonna let you

02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:03.000
guys go and get

02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:05.000
some more calls in, and this one's for you guys.

02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:07.000
Oh, look at that. Oh, oh, oh! Shot

02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:09.000
on air! Yeah!

02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:11.000
That's one of the best video

02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:13.000
calls we've ever got. See, you took it far better than Rob

02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:15.000
did, because Rob turned red in the face, and it was

02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:17.000
awesome. Well, I've had more practice.

02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:21.000
It's become a regular thing on the show.

02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:23.000
All right. Pod Cultures, Monday nights

02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:25.000
here at the Voice Geeks Network, continuing

02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:27.000
a celebration of the various

02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:29.000
Doctors on Tardis Interruptus tomorrow.

02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:31.000
Fourth Doctor, right? Yes, sir.

02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:33.000
All right. Fourth Doctor was my Doctor.

02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:35.000
There you go. He was

02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:37.000
pretty well known.

02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:39.000
Good night, guys. All right, take care, buddy.

02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:41.000
All right, always a pleasure to

02:58:41.000 --> 02:58:43.000
hear from Brad, from another great

02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:45.000
podcast. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's

02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:47.000
this? It's

02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:49.000
me, Mario.

02:58:49.000 --> 02:58:51.000
Hi, Mario.

02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:53.000
Hey. What's on your mind? Is this really

02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:55.000
Extrofer? What?

02:58:55.000 --> 02:58:57.000
Yeah, it's me.

02:58:57.000 --> 02:58:59.000
What's

02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:01.000
on your mind, Extrofer?

02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:03.000
What is on my mind? I don't

02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:05.000
know. I was just calling. Hair.

02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:07.000
You just wanted to see what's up?

02:59:07.000 --> 02:59:09.000
Yeah, I wanted to see

02:59:09.000 --> 02:59:11.000
what's up in his house.

02:59:11.000 --> 02:59:13.000
Well, we're doing this

02:59:13.000 --> 02:59:15.000
aussism

02:59:15.000 --> 02:59:17.000
multiple sclerosis walk

02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:19.000
one week from today, and everybody should

02:59:19.000 --> 02:59:21.000
donate at Hoardhouse.com through the

02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:23.000
link, right? Yeah, totally.

02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:25.000
There you go. Thumbs up for

02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:27.000
multiple sclerosis

02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:29.000
box. We broke a thousand

02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:31.000
dollars today. That's awesome. We did break

02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:33.000
it. We broke it.

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:35.000
We took it out.

02:59:35.000 --> 02:59:37.000
We did take it out.

02:59:37.000 --> 02:59:39.000
And I'm very happy about that.

02:59:39.000 --> 02:59:41.000
What video games have you been playing

02:59:41.000 --> 02:59:43.000
lately, Extrofer?

02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:45.000
You know, Jetpack Joyride

02:59:45.000 --> 02:59:47.000
and

02:59:47.000 --> 02:59:49.000
I don't know, nothing else.

02:59:49.000 --> 02:59:51.000
I'm boring.

02:59:51.000 --> 02:59:53.000
You should know this already.

02:59:53.000 --> 02:59:55.000
Well, what did you call to say

02:59:55.000 --> 02:59:57.000
tonight? Did you want to wish us well on our

02:59:57.000 --> 02:59:59.000
500th episode?

02:59:59.000 --> 03:00:01.000
Um, no. I just thought I'd call

03:00:01.000 --> 03:00:03.000
and say hi.

03:00:03.000 --> 03:00:05.000
Oh, well, okay. Hey.

03:00:05.000 --> 03:00:07.000
Hey.

03:00:07.000 --> 03:00:09.000
Hey. Got any plans tomorrow?

03:00:09.000 --> 03:00:11.000
Want to hang? You know what?

03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:13.000
You still need to come over and finish watching Firefly with

03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:15.000
me after five years of us not

03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:17.000
watching Firefly. Who's getting called out?

03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:19.000
Yeah, you know, I'll check my calendar

03:00:19.000 --> 03:00:21.000
and stuff

03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:23.000
for that and get back

03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:25.000
to you. Well, let's see. My

03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:27.000
week is not working, not working, not working,

03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:29.000
not working, not working birthday. You can come.

03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:31.000
Oh, let me check my calendar.

03:00:31.000 --> 03:00:33.000
I'm not working, not working,

03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:35.000
not working, not working.

03:00:35.000 --> 03:00:37.000
And then birthday.

03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:39.000
I guess we have the same calendar.

03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:41.000
Awesome. Amazing.

03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:43.000
Uh,

03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:45.000
Extrofer, do you want to plug Horde House?

03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:47.000
I will

03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:49.000
plug Horde House up the asshole

03:00:49.000 --> 03:00:51.000
for you.

03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:53.000
Is it bleached?

03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:55.000
Yes, it's a bleached, nicely bleached,

03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:57.000
freshly bleached asshole

03:00:57.000 --> 03:00:59.000
that Horde House has. Let me, let me

03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:01.000
ask you this, Extrofer, since, uh,

03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:03.000
you know, we have a lot of old school listeners that are

03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:05.000
revisiting us tonight and so forth.

03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:07.000
You know, for a while, you and I were roommates

03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:09.000
and OLR Studios was at

03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:11.000
your house. So what would

03:01:11.000 --> 03:01:13.000
the listeners be most surprised

03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:15.000
to know about Orange Lounge Radio behind

03:01:15.000 --> 03:01:17.000
the scenes? What do you think? What do you think

03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:19.000
the OLR listeners

03:01:19.000 --> 03:01:21.000
would be most surprised to know behind the scenes?

03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:23.000
Well, our studio

03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:25.000
in our apartment was freaking

03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:27.000
filthy.

03:01:27.000 --> 03:01:29.000
And, um,

03:01:29.000 --> 03:01:31.000
and, uh,

03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:33.000
Rob falls asleep in random

03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:35.000
places. It's totally

03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:37.000
true. It's not just when he's drunk.

03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:39.000
That is totally hilarious, too.

03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:41.000
What's the most- Like, I would come

03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:43.000
home and he'd be like asleep on the floor

03:01:43.000 --> 03:01:45.000
and be like, oh, I'm glad I didn't trip

03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:47.000
over you. I didn't see you down there.

03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:49.000
I

03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:51.000
remember coming over to that apartment

03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:53.000
and being absolutely thrilled that you were

03:01:53.000 --> 03:01:55.000
totally into Devil's Crush.

03:01:55.000 --> 03:01:57.000
Oh, yeah. I love

03:01:57.000 --> 03:01:59.000
Devil's Crush. Although, the,

03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:01.000
um,

03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:03.000
actually, it was- Alien Crush.

03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:05.000
Yeah, Alien's Crush, or

03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:07.000
whatever. My favorite Extrofer

03:02:07.000 --> 03:02:09.000
memory was when you stood out on the line to get

03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:11.000
me the Wii.

03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:13.000
I know, right? And

03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:15.000
how many times did you play that

03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:17.000
thing?

03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:19.000
Every day is what I want to say.

03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:21.000
Every day. I was a huge Wii fan.

03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:23.000
Yeah, you were a total Wii

03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:25.000
fan. You were like- It was like

03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:27.000
five years after it launched and you were like

03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:29.000
Wii!

03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:31.000
Like, every single chance you would

03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:33.000
get, you would say that. It was kind of weird and

03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:35.000
depressing. It was a little awkward.

03:02:35.000 --> 03:02:37.000
Alright, well, Extrofer, before we let you go, is there

03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:39.000
any other final thoughts for listeners tonight?

03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:41.000
Um,

03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:43.000
well, I gotta go wash my hands

03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:45.000
because I did some dirty work before

03:02:45.000 --> 03:02:47.000
you guys

03:02:47.000 --> 03:02:49.000
gave me a call. In fact,

03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:51.000
when you called me earlier, I didn't

03:02:51.000 --> 03:02:53.000
say anything because

03:02:53.000 --> 03:02:55.000
I had just came and

03:02:55.000 --> 03:02:57.000
you didn't want to hear what

03:02:57.000 --> 03:02:59.000
my voice sounds like right after that.

03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:01.000
Were you- I think you just better

03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:03.000
go wash your hands. Were you touching yourself to the

03:03:03.000 --> 03:03:05.000
show? That's a little awkward. If you're, like, jerking

03:03:05.000 --> 03:03:07.000
it to my voice- No! I took a shit on my

03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:09.000
chair and I was cleaning- What did you think

03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:11.000
I was doing? Never

03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:13.000
change, please. Dirty work, okay? Never change.

03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:15.000
Extrofer, I'm letting you go now.

03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:17.000
Aww, thank you.

03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:19.000
Alright, bye!

03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:21.000
Are we holding him for any reason?

03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:23.000
What the

03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:25.000
fuck?

03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:27.000
Like, seriously!

03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:29.000
I totally miss Extrofer

03:03:29.000 --> 03:03:31.000
and the utter randomness.

03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:35.000
Ah, lordy. Hi, you're-

03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:37.000
Yes! Oh my god, we-

03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:39.000
School bus reference in the chatroom.

03:03:39.000 --> 03:03:41.000
Hi, here on Orange Nails Radio,

03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:43.000
who's this?

03:03:43.000 --> 03:03:45.000
Oh my god, it's Slidekick. Hey,

03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:47.000
girl. Hey, I'm the guy.

03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:49.000
Hey, girl, what's up? Sorry, Rob.

03:03:49.000 --> 03:03:51.000
Sorry, Rob, you're not one of- you're not the guy.

03:03:51.000 --> 03:03:53.000
You're one of the girls. Whatever.

03:03:53.000 --> 03:03:55.000
What's up, Slidekick?

03:03:55.000 --> 03:03:57.000
Hey, I just wanted to congratulate

03:03:57.000 --> 03:03:59.000
you, like, everyone else. Like, I know

03:03:59.000 --> 03:04:01.000
it's totally not original. And, like,

03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:03.000
how do I follow up?

03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:05.000
You know, that call that Extrofer just made,

03:04:05.000 --> 03:04:07.000
you know, I can't really-

03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:09.000
I am not touching myself, but

03:04:09.000 --> 03:04:11.000
I just wanted to congratulate all

03:04:11.000 --> 03:04:13.000
of you on your great achievement.

03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:15.000
And, yeah, that's amazing.

03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:17.000
500, like, I

03:04:17.000 --> 03:04:19.000
can't believe that. Well, thank you, baby. I appreciate it.

03:04:19.000 --> 03:04:21.000
I feel so nervous. Like, I'm on the radio.

03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:23.000
Like, I'm kind of famous now.

03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:25.000
It's just me. You know me.

03:04:25.000 --> 03:04:27.000
You've met me. I'm not that scary.

03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:29.000
We're not that scary, right?

03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:31.000
You're a little

03:04:31.000 --> 03:04:33.000
scary.

03:04:33.000 --> 03:04:35.000
Well,

03:04:35.000 --> 03:04:37.000
shoot, Slidekick, do you want to talk any games

03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:39.000
with us? What games have you been playing lately?

03:04:39.000 --> 03:04:41.000
I'm actually

03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:43.000
playing Fire Emblem Awakening.

03:04:43.000 --> 03:04:45.000
Yeah? How's that?

03:04:45.000 --> 03:04:47.000
And I kind of suck at it, but

03:04:47.000 --> 03:04:49.000
it's cool. I like it a lot.

03:04:49.000 --> 03:04:51.000
I've never really played a lot of

03:04:51.000 --> 03:04:53.000
tactical strategy

03:04:53.000 --> 03:04:55.000
RPGs, so it's cool.

03:04:55.000 --> 03:04:57.000
I like it. There's a lot

03:04:57.000 --> 03:04:59.000
of people that are really into Fire Emblem

03:04:59.000 --> 03:05:01.000
on the 3DS, so I can't really

03:05:01.000 --> 03:05:03.000
blame you for being a fan of that.

03:05:03.000 --> 03:05:05.000
For sure.

03:05:05.000 --> 03:05:07.000
So, Slidekick,

03:05:07.000 --> 03:05:09.000
you've done a couple of podcasts of your own, too.

03:05:09.000 --> 03:05:11.000
I know you used to do a podcast with Alan.

03:05:11.000 --> 03:05:13.000
Not everybody knows about this, but you used to do the

03:05:13.000 --> 03:05:15.000
Amazing Warcraft podcast,

03:05:15.000 --> 03:05:17.000
Fabulous Flames, right, Alan?

03:05:17.000 --> 03:05:19.000
Yes, we did.

03:05:19.000 --> 03:05:21.000
And I have to say, Alan

03:05:21.000 --> 03:05:23.000
has been amazing tonight.

03:05:23.000 --> 03:05:25.000
Yes, he has. I was a big

03:05:25.000 --> 03:05:27.000
fan of the Miss Nude World 96.

03:05:27.000 --> 03:05:29.000
I'm always

03:05:29.000 --> 03:05:31.000
a fan of the Miss

03:05:31.000 --> 03:05:33.000
Nude World 96.

03:05:33.000 --> 03:05:35.000
What are you doing these days in podcasting?

03:05:35.000 --> 03:05:37.000
Do you have anything you want to plug?

03:05:37.000 --> 03:05:39.000
Yes, and since

03:05:39.000 --> 03:05:41.000
Exifer took the butt plug joke,

03:05:41.000 --> 03:05:43.000
I'll just

03:05:43.000 --> 03:05:45.000
go ahead and shout out to

03:05:45.000 --> 03:05:47.000
my podcast, which is

03:05:47.000 --> 03:05:49.000
Game Buoy. We're over at Gamebuoy.org,

03:05:49.000 --> 03:05:51.000
and we bring you gaming news

03:05:51.000 --> 03:05:53.000
and views that may be on your radar, but

03:05:53.000 --> 03:05:55.000
most definitely should be.

03:05:55.000 --> 03:05:57.000
And we are definitely inspired and

03:05:57.000 --> 03:05:59.000
pretty much owe everything about

03:05:59.000 --> 03:06:01.000
who we are, so thank you

03:06:01.000 --> 03:06:03.000
for being an inspiration

03:06:03.000 --> 03:06:05.000
and making

03:06:05.000 --> 03:06:07.000
a community out there

03:06:07.000 --> 03:06:09.000
for people to have a voice in gaming

03:06:09.000 --> 03:06:11.000
because it's super important

03:06:11.000 --> 03:06:13.000
for not just

03:06:13.000 --> 03:06:15.000
all the blogs and

03:06:15.000 --> 03:06:17.000
journalists

03:06:17.000 --> 03:06:19.000
to be the only ones talking about games.

03:06:19.000 --> 03:06:21.000
Well, thank you. It means a lot,

03:06:21.000 --> 03:06:23.000
and your show is

03:06:23.000 --> 03:06:25.000
very good. I've heard it. And even though in those

03:06:25.000 --> 03:06:27.000
first few episodes I wanted to kill you over your

03:06:27.000 --> 03:06:29.000
sound quality, you guys have improved so

03:06:29.000 --> 03:06:31.000
much. You sound great now.

03:06:31.000 --> 03:06:33.000
It was actually better than it was on the previous

03:06:33.000 --> 03:06:35.000
one.

03:06:35.000 --> 03:06:37.000
I do miss Fabulous Flames, just saying.

03:06:37.000 --> 03:06:39.000
You sound great now, and

03:06:39.000 --> 03:06:41.000
your content is very good and

03:06:41.000 --> 03:06:43.000
well-researched, and you and Spike

03:06:43.000 --> 03:06:45.000
are great. And what I love most about your

03:06:45.000 --> 03:06:47.000
show is that you always pay it forward at the end,

03:06:47.000 --> 03:06:49.000
and you do give shout-outs and keep it

03:06:49.000 --> 03:06:51.000
indie, and I think that's great.

03:06:51.000 --> 03:06:53.000
And, you know, if we helped

03:06:53.000 --> 03:06:55.000
inspire that attitude, then that's

03:06:55.000 --> 03:06:57.000
a huge compliment.

03:06:57.000 --> 03:06:59.000
We're your biggest fans. We love

03:06:59.000 --> 03:07:01.000
you so much.

03:07:01.000 --> 03:07:03.000
I have been begging to come on your show for, like,

03:07:03.000 --> 03:07:05.000
six months, and look at this.

03:07:05.000 --> 03:07:07.000
I totally miss planning webcomics

03:07:07.000 --> 03:07:09.000
with you.

03:07:09.000 --> 03:07:11.000
I still have

03:07:11.000 --> 03:07:13.000
the WoW viewer. We can still do it.

03:07:13.000 --> 03:07:15.000
Yay!

03:07:15.000 --> 03:07:17.000
Alright, well,

03:07:17.000 --> 03:07:19.000
Slidekick, I'm gonna let you go so I can get more calls,

03:07:19.000 --> 03:07:21.000
but anything else real quick before I let you go?

03:07:21.000 --> 03:07:23.000
Um, no.

03:07:23.000 --> 03:07:25.000
Except I need to get

03:07:25.000 --> 03:07:27.000
up there and have an OLR party

03:07:27.000 --> 03:07:29.000
sometime. You're welcome any time.

03:07:29.000 --> 03:07:31.000
Get up here on Sunday. You have to come up on Friday.

03:07:31.000 --> 03:07:33.000
Bring Captain Spike.

03:07:33.000 --> 03:07:35.000
I will try. I will try.

03:07:35.000 --> 03:07:37.000
Alright, take care, buddy. Have a good one.

03:07:37.000 --> 03:07:39.000
Alright, you too.

03:07:39.000 --> 03:07:41.000
Have a happy 500. Thank you.

03:07:41.000 --> 03:07:43.000
Alright, 1877

03:07:43.000 --> 03:07:45.000
game OLR, username on Skype

03:07:45.000 --> 03:07:47.000
is OrangeLoungeRadio. Let's go to another call.

03:07:47.000 --> 03:07:49.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

03:07:49.000 --> 03:07:51.000
It's the undertaker of the internet,

03:07:51.000 --> 03:07:53.000
Ravenstaufen. Wait a minute, weren't you just here?

03:07:53.000 --> 03:07:55.000
I was, but give me

03:07:55.000 --> 03:07:57.000
two minutes, Rob. Alright. I hope your

03:07:57.000 --> 03:07:59.000
Paul Bearer didn't die. Alright, time

03:07:59.000 --> 03:08:01.000
starts now.

03:08:01.000 --> 03:08:03.000
Alright, so I want to

03:08:03.000 --> 03:08:05.000
congratulate OrangeLoungeRadio

03:08:05.000 --> 03:08:07.000
for 500 shows and inspiring me

03:08:07.000 --> 03:08:09.000
to do my show. I'm not gonna

03:08:09.000 --> 03:08:11.000
plug it, but I'm just gonna say,

03:08:11.000 --> 03:08:13.000
Rob, your cast

03:08:13.000 --> 03:08:15.000
and your people are very

03:08:15.000 --> 03:08:17.000
diverse, and you kept me entertained

03:08:17.000 --> 03:08:19.000
for years. I am now 26,

03:08:19.000 --> 03:08:21.000
and I've been listening since

03:08:21.000 --> 03:08:23.000
I was in high school as well.

03:08:23.000 --> 03:08:25.000
Oh my god.

03:08:25.000 --> 03:08:27.000
Oh my god, we're so old.

03:08:27.000 --> 03:08:29.000
I can feel myself

03:08:29.000 --> 03:08:31.000
aging. I've got cancer now.

03:08:31.000 --> 03:08:33.000
No, it's, it's, it's

03:08:33.000 --> 03:08:35.000
amazing. It's, that's amazing.

03:08:35.000 --> 03:08:37.000
It really is amazing. I also really

03:08:37.000 --> 03:08:39.000
like your voice.

03:08:39.000 --> 03:08:41.000
Thanks. It's so funny. Your voice

03:08:41.000 --> 03:08:43.000
is very much mature. I remember when you used to

03:08:43.000 --> 03:08:45.000
call this show all the time when you were in high school,

03:08:45.000 --> 03:08:47.000
and the years right after that

03:08:47.000 --> 03:08:49.000
and so forth, your voice really has matured.

03:08:49.000 --> 03:08:51.000
Like, I can hear it through

03:08:51.000 --> 03:08:53.000
undoubtedly your own podcast and

03:08:53.000 --> 03:08:55.000
so forth. It's, it's, it's

03:08:55.000 --> 03:08:57.000
pleasant. It came a long way.

03:08:57.000 --> 03:08:59.000
Everything came a long way, and I have to

03:08:59.000 --> 03:09:01.000
say, if OrangeLoungeRadio

03:09:01.000 --> 03:09:03.000
was a lighthouse in the beacon of the dark,

03:09:03.000 --> 03:09:05.000
you are

03:09:05.000 --> 03:09:07.000
awesome. Well, I appreciate

03:09:07.000 --> 03:09:09.000
it so much, Ravenstaufen, and thank you so

03:09:09.000 --> 03:09:11.000
much for sticking with us for all the years. It's a pleasure, as

03:09:11.000 --> 03:09:13.000
always, to hear from you. I've, I've, I

03:09:13.000 --> 03:09:15.000
listen to every archive. I've never

03:09:15.000 --> 03:09:17.000
leave. It's just sometimes I do my things

03:09:17.000 --> 03:09:19.000
on Sunday and it makes it hard. I had to cancel

03:09:19.000 --> 03:09:21.000
my own show for you guys because I had

03:09:21.000 --> 03:09:23.000
to be here for your special day.

03:09:23.000 --> 03:09:25.000
Wow, that's, oh my gosh.

03:09:25.000 --> 03:09:27.000
Wow. What would you have talked

03:09:27.000 --> 03:09:29.000
about on your show tonight? Maybe we can

03:09:29.000 --> 03:09:31.000
work a little bit of it into here, a little

03:09:31.000 --> 03:09:33.000
crossover episode.

03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:35.000
Well, I was gonna talk about, and you guys

03:09:35.000 --> 03:09:37.000
didn't do, it was the whole thing about

03:09:37.000 --> 03:09:39.000
Twitch TV, about that handicapped guy that

03:09:39.000 --> 03:09:41.000
wasn't handicapped. Yeah, I heard

03:09:41.000 --> 03:09:43.000
about this. So what, let me see if I can

03:09:43.000 --> 03:09:45.000
summarize. Let's see. So he was getting donations

03:09:45.000 --> 03:09:47.000
because he was sick

03:09:47.000 --> 03:09:49.000
and I guess it was donations for a surgery,

03:09:49.000 --> 03:09:51.000
right? And, uh, well

03:09:51.000 --> 03:09:53.000
the cameras weren't stopping on Twitch

03:09:53.000 --> 03:09:55.000
TV. He didn't turn them off and they caught

03:09:55.000 --> 03:09:57.000
him getting up out of his wheelchair.

03:09:57.000 --> 03:09:59.000
Like, just getting up and walking

03:09:59.000 --> 03:10:01.000
away. So the, the cake was

03:10:01.000 --> 03:10:03.000
a lie, ladies and gentlemen, but that

03:10:03.000 --> 03:10:05.000
just goes to show, you gotta be, it's,

03:10:05.000 --> 03:10:07.000
it's sad that we can't just

03:10:07.000 --> 03:10:09.000
trust people and we can't, but like

03:10:09.000 --> 03:10:11.000
you, you do have to be skeptical.

03:10:11.000 --> 03:10:13.000
Like, that's why with the MS Walk stuff, and

03:10:13.000 --> 03:10:15.000
you know, we've been plugging that a lot. Like, I was very

03:10:15.000 --> 03:10:17.000
much like, we're gonna take it

03:10:17.000 --> 03:10:19.000
directly to the MS Walk

03:10:19.000 --> 03:10:21.000
society, the MS society and you donate

03:10:21.000 --> 03:10:23.000
right there, directly. We're not, you know,

03:10:23.000 --> 03:10:25.000
I don't, no funny business people.

03:10:25.000 --> 03:10:27.000
Yeah, so we were

03:10:27.000 --> 03:10:29.000
gonna talk about that. I mean, I had problems

03:10:29.000 --> 03:10:31.000
in the past. I mean, I'm on Social Security

03:10:31.000 --> 03:10:33.000
right now. I, you know, I

03:10:33.000 --> 03:10:35.000
had major problems, went to special

03:10:35.000 --> 03:10:37.000
schools. So for me, for someone that

03:10:37.000 --> 03:10:39.000
fakes an illness like that, like, you

03:10:39.000 --> 03:10:41.000
just slapped me in the face. And I'm not trying

03:10:41.000 --> 03:10:43.000
to get donations for what I'm doing,

03:10:43.000 --> 03:10:45.000
but it came a long

03:10:45.000 --> 03:10:47.000
way. It's, it's, you

03:10:47.000 --> 03:10:49.000
know what, though? That's, Karma

03:10:49.000 --> 03:10:51.000
will bite you when you do stuff like that. Karma

03:10:51.000 --> 03:10:53.000
will bite you. And Karma bit that guy

03:10:53.000 --> 03:10:55.000
big time. Big time. Yeah. So

03:10:55.000 --> 03:10:57.000
DJ Darknight

03:10:57.000 --> 03:10:59.000
in chat at live.voguenetwork.com says

03:10:59.000 --> 03:11:01.000
that's just as bad as the guy that was caught spanking

03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:03.000
himself on Twitch. That's funny.

03:11:03.000 --> 03:11:05.000
That's funny.

03:11:05.000 --> 03:11:07.000
The wheelchair thing is, is bad.

03:11:07.000 --> 03:11:09.000
That's evil. That's awful. But the

03:11:09.000 --> 03:11:11.000
But that's the internet, though. Jerking it on Twitch, that's funny.

03:11:11.000 --> 03:11:13.000
Any live streaming site, you're going

03:11:13.000 --> 03:11:15.000
to see dick or boobs anyway. Yeah, I was

03:11:15.000 --> 03:11:17.000
gonna say, or the one dude that had sex with his girlfriend

03:11:17.000 --> 03:11:19.000
or something like that in the background, or like, he

03:11:19.000 --> 03:11:21.000
just forgot it was on.

03:11:21.000 --> 03:11:23.000
Yeah, he forgot it was on. That's why I'm very

03:11:23.000 --> 03:11:25.000
careful about when I have the, I would not

03:11:25.000 --> 03:11:27.000
live stream 24-7 just because

03:11:27.000 --> 03:11:29.000
Extra for, for shame. I know

03:11:29.000 --> 03:11:31.000
something bad would happen. Alright,

03:11:31.000 --> 03:11:33.000
Ravenstaufen, I'm gonna let you go to get more calls, but thank you so

03:11:33.000 --> 03:11:35.000
much for the kind words. I understand. Thank you for taking my call.

03:11:35.000 --> 03:11:37.000
Bye. No problem. Bye.

03:11:37.000 --> 03:11:39.000
1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype.

03:11:39.000 --> 03:11:41.000
OrangeLoungeRadio. Why not? We can do a couple

03:11:41.000 --> 03:11:43.000
more calls, right? We're only at 9-30.

03:11:43.000 --> 03:11:45.000
We are being

03:11:45.000 --> 03:11:47.000
horribly rude to our East Coast people.

03:11:47.000 --> 03:11:49.000
We are. How about one more call?

03:11:49.000 --> 03:11:51.000
One more call. One more call. Let's see who gets in.

03:11:51.000 --> 03:11:53.000
1-877-GAME-OLR. I'm

03:11:53.000 --> 03:11:55.000
totally, wait a minute, I'm totally jealous of all of them

03:11:55.000 --> 03:11:57.000
who have jobs.

03:11:57.000 --> 03:11:59.000
No. Keep them up all night.

03:11:59.000 --> 03:12:01.000
All night. You alright?

03:12:01.000 --> 03:12:03.000
I was doing my Rhonda Shear

03:12:03.000 --> 03:12:05.000
impersonation. Hello? I see, I see.

03:12:05.000 --> 03:12:07.000
Except I'm not wearing, you know, extra padding in the boob region.

03:12:07.000 --> 03:12:09.000
Alright, let me go to one more call. Hi, you're on

03:12:09.000 --> 03:12:11.000
OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

03:12:11.000 --> 03:12:13.000
Hey, what's up? It's TigerClaw. Hey, TigerClaw.

03:12:13.000 --> 03:12:15.000
What's on your mind, buddy? Oh,

03:12:15.000 --> 03:12:17.000
I just want to congratulate you guys

03:12:17.000 --> 03:12:19.000
on your 500th episode.

03:12:19.000 --> 03:12:21.000
I guess you guys can go

03:12:21.000 --> 03:12:23.000
on record, maybe,

03:12:23.000 --> 03:12:25.000
as being the longest running podcast

03:12:25.000 --> 03:12:27.000
in history or something like that.

03:12:27.000 --> 03:12:29.000
We're not the longest running podcast. We are the longest

03:12:29.000 --> 03:12:31.000
running video game podcast. I don't

03:12:31.000 --> 03:12:33.000
even know. Well, you guys

03:12:33.000 --> 03:12:35.000
been around way before

03:12:35.000 --> 03:12:37.000
podcasting was a thing, so.

03:12:37.000 --> 03:12:39.000
I'd say live show. That's what gives

03:12:39.000 --> 03:12:41.000
us a jump on the other people is that we had

03:12:41.000 --> 03:12:43.000
the live 365 years and so

03:12:43.000 --> 03:12:45.000
we kind of slid right into the podcasting

03:12:45.000 --> 03:12:47.000
thing. But I would say

03:12:47.000 --> 03:12:49.000
I usually say we are the longest

03:12:49.000 --> 03:12:51.000
running internet show about

03:12:51.000 --> 03:12:53.000
video games. Weekly internet show about video games.

03:12:53.000 --> 03:12:55.000
Uh, yeah.

03:12:55.000 --> 03:12:57.000
But you know what? The internet, the internet

03:12:57.000 --> 03:12:59.000
TigerClaw, the internet is a big place.

03:12:59.000 --> 03:13:01.000
Like, uh, I've been putting

03:13:01.000 --> 03:13:03.000
together this special interest group on Facebook

03:13:03.000 --> 03:13:05.000
recently, uh, with some friends and I

03:13:05.000 --> 03:13:07.000
found that there's all these, like, other podcasters

03:13:07.000 --> 03:13:09.000
I didn't even know were out there. Like, I didn't even know

03:13:09.000 --> 03:13:11.000
these shows existed and, like, they're celebrating

03:13:11.000 --> 03:13:13.000
episode 100 and, and, and, like

03:13:13.000 --> 03:13:15.000
60 and I'm like, what?

03:13:15.000 --> 03:13:17.000
So, you never know what's out there, which is

03:13:17.000 --> 03:13:19.000
why I'm very cautious to stake a claim, like,

03:13:19.000 --> 03:13:21.000
we're the longest running show, bitches.

03:13:21.000 --> 03:13:23.000
You know, so I, I just,

03:13:23.000 --> 03:13:25.000
I want to be careful.

03:13:25.000 --> 03:13:27.000
Yep, and just keep on doing

03:13:27.000 --> 03:13:29.000
what you're doing and

03:13:29.000 --> 03:13:31.000
and hopefully people will listen

03:13:31.000 --> 03:13:33.000
and, um,

03:13:33.000 --> 03:13:35.000
I don't know what else to say, uh,

03:13:35.000 --> 03:13:37.000
no matter how old you get

03:13:37.000 --> 03:13:39.000
just keep on gaming because

03:13:39.000 --> 03:13:41.000
you'll still feel the same way.

03:13:41.000 --> 03:13:43.000
Alright, well, TigerClaw,

03:13:43.000 --> 03:13:45.000
I appreciate your support over

03:13:45.000 --> 03:13:47.000
the years. It means an awful lot.

03:13:47.000 --> 03:13:49.000
Uh, no problem.

03:13:49.000 --> 03:13:51.000
You're welcome. So, better let some other

03:13:51.000 --> 03:13:53.000
people call in. Alright, we'll see if

03:13:53.000 --> 03:13:55.000
maybe we'll let one more sneak in since you were short.

03:13:55.000 --> 03:13:57.000
But have a good one, TigerClaw. Alright, thanks.

03:13:57.000 --> 03:13:59.000
Alright. Take care. Mm-hmm, you too. Bye-bye.

03:13:59.000 --> 03:14:01.000
Bye. Well, we can do

03:14:01.000 --> 03:14:03.000
one more. Let's do one more.

03:14:03.000 --> 03:14:05.000
One more, come on. Show up. Alright,

03:14:05.000 --> 03:14:07.000
one more, one more. Especially this one.

03:14:07.000 --> 03:14:09.000
Alright, hi, oh.

03:14:09.000 --> 03:14:11.000
Oh my gosh, it's a scary

03:14:11.000 --> 03:14:13.000
black man on the cam, oh my gosh.

03:14:15.000 --> 03:14:17.000
No, I'm kidding, you

03:14:17.000 --> 03:14:19.000
guys, it's DJ Rama S. You are looking

03:14:19.000 --> 03:14:21.000
sharp in your vlog shirt. You are looking very sharp

03:14:21.000 --> 03:14:23.000
today, young man. How are you?

03:14:23.000 --> 03:14:25.000
I'm doing fine. How is everybody in the

03:14:25.000 --> 03:14:27.000
Sacramento studios? We're,

03:14:27.000 --> 03:14:29.000
I'm sobering up, sadly.

03:14:29.000 --> 03:14:31.000
Oh, you should not be sobering up, because

03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:33.000
I have a problem with that good sir. Uh-oh,

03:14:33.000 --> 03:14:35.000
what's that? Well,

03:14:35.000 --> 03:14:37.000
ah. What are you drinking?

03:14:37.000 --> 03:14:39.000
If you can

03:14:39.000 --> 03:14:41.000
see what I got here. I

03:14:41.000 --> 03:14:43.000
love you, and I need to be at your house

03:14:43.000 --> 03:14:45.000
right now.

03:14:45.000 --> 03:14:47.000
He's got a bottle of

03:14:47.000 --> 03:14:49.000
Glenfiddich. This is one of

03:14:49.000 --> 03:14:51.000
two bottles of Glenfiddich I have.

03:14:51.000 --> 03:14:53.000
Okay, I'm a BRB going on a plane.

03:14:55.000 --> 03:14:57.000
Of course, I could just go to Becky's house.

03:14:59.000 --> 03:15:01.000
Do you see this glass right here? Yes, I do.

03:15:01.000 --> 03:15:03.000
Oh, wait, hold it, except for once

03:15:03.000 --> 03:15:05.000
it says something about a Luigi hat. Give me

03:15:05.000 --> 03:15:07.000
one quick second. Oh, lord.

03:15:07.000 --> 03:15:09.000
Wait, they can't, they can't, they can't, we're the

03:15:09.000 --> 03:15:11.000
only ones that can see you.

03:15:11.000 --> 03:15:13.000
Okay, he's wearing that, well you can, Rob,

03:15:13.000 --> 03:15:15.000
do you know what print screen is?

03:15:15.000 --> 03:15:17.000
Oh, uh, yes, I do

03:15:17.000 --> 03:15:19.000
print screen.

03:15:19.000 --> 03:15:21.000
You've got Photoshop, right?

03:15:21.000 --> 03:15:23.000
I'll print screen, we'll just get that window.

03:15:23.000 --> 03:15:25.000
There we go. Alright, I think I got him, we'll see.

03:15:25.000 --> 03:15:27.000
Nice.

03:15:27.000 --> 03:15:29.000
Do I even have PaintShop Pro on this

03:15:29.000 --> 03:15:31.000
computer or whatever? God, PaintShop Pro.

03:15:31.000 --> 03:15:33.000
Shut up.

03:15:33.000 --> 03:15:35.000
PaintShop Pro. I might have

03:15:35.000 --> 03:15:37.000
MS Paint. You know what, you

03:15:37.000 --> 03:15:39.000
can paste it in Paint.

03:15:39.000 --> 03:15:41.000
There you go, you got it. Yes, I got it.

03:15:41.000 --> 03:15:43.000
Woohoo. Alright, I'll save it as a paint thing

03:15:43.000 --> 03:15:45.000
and fix that up later. Alright, so anyhow.

03:15:45.000 --> 03:15:47.000
Bitmap.

03:15:47.000 --> 03:15:49.000
Where was I? I'm gonna save it

03:15:49.000 --> 03:15:51.000
with the very clever untitled

03:15:51.000 --> 03:15:53.000
.bmp. Alright,

03:15:53.000 --> 03:15:55.000
um, you're looking,

03:15:55.000 --> 03:15:57.000
Rob, I already took the damn picture.

03:15:57.000 --> 03:15:59.000
Rob is sadly not on a Mac.

03:15:59.000 --> 03:16:01.000
I'll continue to wear it to the end of the

03:16:01.000 --> 03:16:03.000
video broadcast, but as you can see,

03:16:03.000 --> 03:16:05.000
I am popping this bad boy open

03:16:05.000 --> 03:16:07.000
that has been in my freezer for the past

03:16:07.000 --> 03:16:09.000
two weeks. Oh, nice.

03:16:09.000 --> 03:16:11.000
And, as I

03:16:11.000 --> 03:16:13.000
pour this, I want to thank each and every

03:16:13.000 --> 03:16:15.000
single one of you. As everyone

03:16:15.000 --> 03:16:17.000
said before, if it wasn't for OLR,

03:16:17.000 --> 03:16:19.000
there wouldn't be no anime jam session.

03:16:19.000 --> 03:16:21.000
And also,

03:16:21.000 --> 03:16:23.000
I will not be one of those

03:16:23.000 --> 03:16:25.000
podcasters that will beg for

03:16:25.000 --> 03:16:27.000
money to do my show. What me,

03:16:27.000 --> 03:16:29.000
Marco, and Ari, what we all do,

03:16:29.000 --> 03:16:31.000
we do it for love, and we pick up

03:16:31.000 --> 03:16:33.000
all our money and we do it together.

03:16:33.000 --> 03:16:35.000
I'll do it for dollar

03:16:35.000 --> 03:16:37.000
bills to show my tatas,

03:16:37.000 --> 03:16:39.000
but that's it.

03:16:39.000 --> 03:16:41.000
Someone

03:16:41.000 --> 03:16:43.000
did send me money one time. For showing

03:16:43.000 --> 03:16:45.000
your tatas? No. I do

03:16:45.000 --> 03:16:47.000
that for free.

03:16:47.000 --> 03:16:49.000
To Dan.

03:16:49.000 --> 03:16:51.000
She does that for drinks.

03:16:51.000 --> 03:16:53.000
But no, remember when I had Pump Up the Volume?

03:16:53.000 --> 03:16:55.000
And Loki put it in my intro

03:16:55.000 --> 03:16:57.000
to tune in and give me a dollar? Oh yeah,

03:16:57.000 --> 03:16:59.000
someone actually sent me a dollar. I remember that.

03:16:59.000 --> 03:17:01.000
It was good times.

03:17:01.000 --> 03:17:03.000
Rama, thank you so much for the toast,

03:17:03.000 --> 03:17:05.000
and as I was saying before to some of the other

03:17:05.000 --> 03:17:07.000
callers, that is really the ultimate

03:17:07.000 --> 03:17:09.000
compliment to hear that we might

03:17:09.000 --> 03:17:11.000
have inspired even a portion of somebody

03:17:11.000 --> 03:17:13.000
else's show. It's outstanding.

03:17:13.000 --> 03:17:15.000
You need to come back for fun of me.

03:17:15.000 --> 03:17:17.000
We're just here having a good time.

03:17:17.000 --> 03:17:19.000
Go on.

03:17:19.000 --> 03:17:21.000
You cut out. Go ahead, Rama.

03:17:21.000 --> 03:17:23.000
Well, I was going to say, OLR

03:17:23.000 --> 03:17:25.000
is not just a podcast. We're like a

03:17:25.000 --> 03:17:27.000
frickin' family. A giant

03:17:27.000 --> 03:17:29.000
dysfunctional family.

03:17:29.000 --> 03:17:31.000
We put the fun

03:17:31.000 --> 03:17:33.000
in dysfunction. That's right.

03:17:33.000 --> 03:17:35.000
I will go on record right now.

03:17:35.000 --> 03:17:37.000
You guys

03:17:37.000 --> 03:17:39.000
really got me through

03:17:39.000 --> 03:17:41.000
the passing of my mother when I called that

03:17:41.000 --> 03:17:43.000
one night and asked for you guys to play

03:17:43.000 --> 03:17:45.000
Let's Screw.

03:17:45.000 --> 03:17:47.000
That was one of my favorite songs.

03:17:47.000 --> 03:17:49.000
You guys played it, and I could not

03:17:49.000 --> 03:17:51.000
thank y'all enough for doing that.

03:17:51.000 --> 03:17:53.000
I'm more than happy

03:17:53.000 --> 03:17:55.000
to do so, especially if it'll help

03:17:55.000 --> 03:17:57.000
even just the slightest bit

03:17:57.000 --> 03:17:59.000
in somebody's really shitty day,

03:17:59.000 --> 03:18:01.000
to put it lightly. I'm

03:18:01.000 --> 03:18:03.000
happy to.

03:18:03.000 --> 03:18:05.000
Hearts.

03:18:05.000 --> 03:18:07.000
Of course. Now to

03:18:07.000 --> 03:18:09.000
Sky.

03:18:09.000 --> 03:18:11.000
Loki. Dark

03:18:11.000 --> 03:18:13.000
Sakura. Here's to you.

03:18:13.000 --> 03:18:15.000
Here's to me. The best of friends

03:18:15.000 --> 03:18:17.000
will ever be. If you should ever

03:18:17.000 --> 03:18:19.000
happen to disagree, well, fuck you

03:18:19.000 --> 03:18:21.000
and here's to me. Fuck you too,

03:18:21.000 --> 03:18:23.000
buddy. I hope

03:18:23.000 --> 03:18:25.000
that puts you on the floor. That is seriously

03:18:25.000 --> 03:18:27.000
my second favorite toast ever.

03:18:27.000 --> 03:18:29.000
That's great.

03:18:29.000 --> 03:18:31.000
And before I go, I did say I have a

03:18:31.000 --> 03:18:33.000
little treat for you. Okay. I love

03:18:33.000 --> 03:18:35.000
your hand flailing. That's cute.

03:18:35.000 --> 03:18:37.000
I thought that was the treat.

03:18:37.000 --> 03:18:39.000
I just came back from a J-pop concert and I got

03:18:39.000 --> 03:18:41.000
in for free, okay?

03:18:41.000 --> 03:18:43.000
Amazing.

03:18:43.000 --> 03:18:45.000
But I'll have PAX East.

03:18:45.000 --> 03:18:47.000
I happen to run into a famous

03:18:47.000 --> 03:18:49.000
Nerdcore rapper, and I asked him to do

03:18:49.000 --> 03:18:51.000
a favor, and hopefully

03:18:51.000 --> 03:18:53.000
this will play through.

03:18:53.000 --> 03:18:55.000
And here we go.

03:18:55.000 --> 03:18:57.000
This is MC Frontalot, and you are

03:18:57.000 --> 03:18:59.000
participating with the Voice of Geeks

03:18:59.000 --> 03:19:01.000
Network.

03:19:01.000 --> 03:19:03.000
Shut the front

03:19:03.000 --> 03:19:05.000
door. Oh my god.

03:19:05.000 --> 03:19:07.000
Oh

03:19:07.000 --> 03:19:09.000
my god. That's amazing.

03:19:09.000 --> 03:19:11.000
Wow.

03:19:11.000 --> 03:19:13.000
Work it.

03:19:13.000 --> 03:19:15.000
I love you forever.

03:19:15.000 --> 03:19:17.000
I'm buying you drinks.

03:19:17.000 --> 03:19:19.000
Alright, that's it. New York. When we going?

03:19:19.000 --> 03:19:21.000
Right now. Bye, BRB.

03:19:21.000 --> 03:19:23.000
Head to New York. BRB, New York.

03:19:23.000 --> 03:19:25.000
Alright, no. You have to pick up

03:19:25.000 --> 03:19:27.000
Marco as you go, because if you go, take

03:19:27.000 --> 03:19:29.000
me without her. She's going to kick everybody's

03:19:29.000 --> 03:19:31.000
ass. BRB is stopping in New Jersey.

03:19:31.000 --> 03:19:33.000
Alright,

03:19:33.000 --> 03:19:35.000
Rama, that was

03:19:35.000 --> 03:19:37.000
amazing. That was awesome.

03:19:37.000 --> 03:19:39.000
You've been an amazing support over the

03:19:39.000 --> 03:19:41.000
years, and thank you so much,

03:19:41.000 --> 03:19:43.000
buddy. You don't even know.

03:19:43.000 --> 03:19:45.000
No, thank you, because

03:19:45.000 --> 03:19:47.000
you guys gave me this opportunity to do

03:19:47.000 --> 03:19:49.000
this, so me running around, finding

03:19:49.000 --> 03:19:51.000
these opportunities to give you guys

03:19:51.000 --> 03:19:53.000
bumpers, interviews, this and that.

03:19:53.000 --> 03:19:55.000
This is more than my way of saying

03:19:55.000 --> 03:19:57.000
thank you, you know? This is,

03:19:57.000 --> 03:19:59.000
you know, all I ever wanted

03:19:59.000 --> 03:20:01.000
was to get my show on, and Rob, you gave

03:20:01.000 --> 03:20:03.000
me that opportunity, so

03:20:03.000 --> 03:20:05.000
believe it or not, I'm in your eternal thanks for all

03:20:05.000 --> 03:20:07.000
of this. Well, it's the

03:20:07.000 --> 03:20:09.000
least I could do.

03:20:09.000 --> 03:20:11.000
Alright, take care of my friend. We have

03:20:11.000 --> 03:20:13.000
to go wrap up. It's not a marathon

03:20:13.000 --> 03:20:15.000
show. Yes? Stay black, my

03:20:15.000 --> 03:20:17.000
brother. I will, absolutely.

03:20:17.000 --> 03:20:19.000
Good night. Hey,

03:20:19.000 --> 03:20:21.000
run, run, Sean. Yeah, that's okay, Sean.

03:20:21.000 --> 03:20:23.000
Stay drunk.

03:20:23.000 --> 03:20:25.000
Bye, my friend.

03:20:25.000 --> 03:20:27.000
I don't have to have sinned.

03:20:27.000 --> 03:20:29.000
Alright, I'm hitting hang up now,

03:20:29.000 --> 03:20:31.000
because I've said bye like five times. Alright.

03:20:31.000 --> 03:20:33.000
That was

03:20:33.000 --> 03:20:35.000
amazing. It'll always be my run, Sean.

03:20:35.000 --> 03:20:37.000
What a great show.

03:20:37.000 --> 03:20:39.000
I'm getting a little of a clempt.

03:20:39.000 --> 03:20:41.000
Do we have any last minute stories? Oh, I need to read

03:20:41.000 --> 03:20:43.000
Twitter topics. Where's my iPad?

03:20:43.000 --> 03:20:45.000
Do we have any last minute stories, Loki?

03:20:45.000 --> 03:20:47.000
No. No, he's ready to go.

03:20:47.000 --> 03:20:49.000
I have a last

03:20:49.000 --> 03:20:51.000
minute story. Okay.

03:20:51.000 --> 03:20:53.000
I like these brownies. They're awesome.

03:20:53.000 --> 03:20:55.000
I just want to say, just kind of like a

03:20:55.000 --> 03:20:57.000
blanket thank you to

03:20:57.000 --> 03:20:59.000
the kind words on

03:20:59.000 --> 03:21:01.000
Twitter. There's been a lot of tweet

03:21:01.000 --> 03:21:03.000
activity tonight, and I just want to say a

03:21:03.000 --> 03:21:05.000
big thank you for all of that.

03:21:05.000 --> 03:21:07.000
I don't have the time yet, because we're

03:21:07.000 --> 03:21:09.000
running way over to read each and every single

03:21:09.000 --> 03:21:11.000
one of them, but I just want to say thank you.

03:21:11.000 --> 03:21:13.000
Quickly, some of these tweets, real

03:21:13.000 --> 03:21:15.000
quick. Act F

03:21:15.000 --> 03:21:17.000
tweeting us about Shadowrun Returns

03:21:17.000 --> 03:21:19.000
backers for the DRM-free copy of the game

03:21:19.000 --> 03:21:21.000
may have gotten screwed by Microsoft,

03:21:21.000 --> 03:21:23.000
and in a nutshell, the game will be

03:21:23.000 --> 03:21:25.000
free, but the

03:21:25.000 --> 03:21:27.000
original game

03:21:27.000 --> 03:21:29.000
will be DRM-free, but the DLC

03:21:29.000 --> 03:21:31.000
will not. So they're holding

03:21:31.000 --> 03:21:33.000
up their end of the bargain. Basically what it is, is you get

03:21:33.000 --> 03:21:35.000
two versions of the game. You get a DRM-free

03:21:35.000 --> 03:21:37.000
version of the game. You get a Steam version of the game.

03:21:37.000 --> 03:21:39.000
Steam version will support the DLC

03:21:39.000 --> 03:21:41.000
beyond the Kickstarter

03:21:41.000 --> 03:21:43.000
exclusive DLC, and then

03:21:43.000 --> 03:21:45.000
the free-to-play

03:21:45.000 --> 03:21:47.000
DRM-free game will only

03:21:47.000 --> 03:21:49.000
support the Kickstarter

03:21:49.000 --> 03:21:51.000
DLC, but no

03:21:51.000 --> 03:21:53.000
additional DLC.

03:21:53.000 --> 03:21:55.000
Tigerclaw tweeting us that

03:21:55.000 --> 03:21:57.000
Ska Studios challenges the view that

03:21:57.000 --> 03:21:59.000
Microsoft is bad for indies, so not

03:21:59.000 --> 03:22:01.000
everybody is saying that Microsoft is this

03:22:01.000 --> 03:22:03.000
evil indie thing. Bobby Blackwolf

03:22:03.000 --> 03:22:05.000
tweeting us about this is a travesty

03:22:05.000 --> 03:22:07.000
in a story about Disneyland. Apparently

03:22:07.000 --> 03:22:09.000
Space Mountain was

03:22:09.000 --> 03:22:11.000
closed while Disneyland reviewed safety.

03:22:11.000 --> 03:22:13.000
Space Mountain, the Matterhorn Bobsleds,

03:22:13.000 --> 03:22:15.000
and Soarin' Over California were

03:22:15.000 --> 03:22:17.000
out of service today.

03:22:17.000 --> 03:22:19.000
What a shitty day to be at Disneyland.

03:22:19.000 --> 03:22:21.000
Hey, we weren't there.

03:22:21.000 --> 03:22:23.000
You poor guys that went to Disneyland today.

03:22:23.000 --> 03:22:25.000
But they did reopen Matterhorn Bobsleds already,

03:22:25.000 --> 03:22:27.000
which, you know, is kind of... I'm just still

03:22:27.000 --> 03:22:29.000
irritated they took out the basketball court.

03:22:29.000 --> 03:22:31.000
They did? Yeah, they took out the basketball

03:22:31.000 --> 03:22:33.000
court when they redid the tracks.

03:22:33.000 --> 03:22:35.000
For those who don't know their

03:22:35.000 --> 03:22:37.000
Disney trivia, the Matterhorn had a half

03:22:37.000 --> 03:22:39.000
court up in the very top of the

03:22:39.000 --> 03:22:41.000
mountain for cast members

03:22:41.000 --> 03:22:43.000
to go during their break.

03:22:43.000 --> 03:22:45.000
ActDeft tweeting us saying

03:22:45.000 --> 03:22:47.000
Wars of Horizon getting a new free DLC

03:22:47.000 --> 03:22:49.000
pack called the 1000 Club.

03:22:49.000 --> 03:22:51.000
I like free DLC. I'm on board

03:22:51.000 --> 03:22:53.000
with that. Also,

03:22:53.000 --> 03:22:55.000
ActDeft tweeting us...

03:22:55.000 --> 03:22:57.000
I think I went over his too, but that's okay.

03:22:57.000 --> 03:22:59.000
A New Jersey assemblywoman wants to

03:22:59.000 --> 03:23:01.000
ban violent video games in public

03:23:01.000 --> 03:23:03.000
places. Yeah, was that the same one where they

03:23:03.000 --> 03:23:05.000
want to ban M-rated arcade games? Yeah, they want

03:23:05.000 --> 03:23:07.000
to ban M-rated and AO-rated arcade

03:23:07.000 --> 03:23:09.000
games. Problem being, the ESRB does not

03:23:09.000 --> 03:23:11.000
rate arcade games.

03:23:11.000 --> 03:23:13.000
Yeah. So,

03:23:13.000 --> 03:23:15.000
way to do your research.

03:23:15.000 --> 03:23:17.000
How about if you don't like them? Don't take your

03:23:17.000 --> 03:23:19.000
children there. And I just want to give

03:23:19.000 --> 03:23:21.000
some quick shout outs. I know I said I wasn't going to read

03:23:21.000 --> 03:23:23.000
each and every one of these, but we actually had some other

03:23:23.000 --> 03:23:25.000
fellow podcasters that tweeted us

03:23:25.000 --> 03:23:27.000
and said congratulations. And I think it's

03:23:27.000 --> 03:23:29.000
important to give these guys a shout out because

03:23:29.000 --> 03:23:31.000
community

03:23:31.000 --> 03:23:33.000
makes us great. And us indie podcasters,

03:23:33.000 --> 03:23:35.000
we really, really have to stick together.

03:23:35.000 --> 03:23:37.000
So I do want to give a shout out to Godfrey

03:23:37.000 --> 03:23:39.000
from Gamertag Radio who sent a tweet earlier

03:23:39.000 --> 03:23:41.000
today. And they've been going

03:23:41.000 --> 03:23:43.000
a very long time as well. I know they were one of the

03:23:43.000 --> 03:23:45.000
first shows on iTunes as well, so

03:23:45.000 --> 03:23:47.000
he's had many, many great

03:23:47.000 --> 03:23:49.000
accomplishments. So props to you, Godfrey.

03:23:49.000 --> 03:23:51.000
GameBui, who you

03:23:51.000 --> 03:23:53.000
heard Slidekick earlier, also sent us a tweet.

03:23:53.000 --> 03:23:55.000
Those guys are a lot of fun.

03:23:55.000 --> 03:23:57.000
Even though I think they should go weekly,

03:23:57.000 --> 03:23:59.000
but when they do

03:23:59.000 --> 03:24:01.000
put out a show, it is fabulous and very well

03:24:01.000 --> 03:24:03.000
researched. We always love it when they put out.

03:24:03.000 --> 03:24:05.000
Who doesn't love it when they put out?

03:24:05.000 --> 03:24:07.000
The Rich from the Video Game

03:24:07.000 --> 03:24:09.000
Show tweeted us and said congrats on

03:24:09.000 --> 03:24:11.000
500. Now Video Game Show, I

03:24:11.000 --> 03:24:13.000
think, as far as I

03:24:13.000 --> 03:24:15.000
know, I could be wrong, but as

03:24:15.000 --> 03:24:17.000
far as I know, Video Game Show is

03:24:17.000 --> 03:24:19.000
the only other podcast

03:24:19.000 --> 03:24:21.000
in iTunes when it went

03:24:21.000 --> 03:24:23.000
live about gaming the day it went

03:24:23.000 --> 03:24:25.000
live that is still going. They're about to hit

03:24:25.000 --> 03:24:27.000
episode 400. And again, if

03:24:27.000 --> 03:24:29.000
we didn't have the live 365 years to count,

03:24:29.000 --> 03:24:31.000
we'd probably be tied with them right now. So

03:24:31.000 --> 03:24:33.000
big props to the Video Game

03:24:33.000 --> 03:24:35.000
Show for keeping it going for all this time.

03:24:35.000 --> 03:24:37.000
Our old friends at All Games Radio

03:24:37.000 --> 03:24:39.000
also wishing us well on episode 500

03:24:39.000 --> 03:24:41.000
tonight. I think that's very nice.

03:24:41.000 --> 03:24:43.000
I'm glad to hear that they're doing well

03:24:43.000 --> 03:24:45.000
as well too. They've added a lot

03:24:45.000 --> 03:24:47.000
of cool shows to their lineup. They've really

03:24:47.000 --> 03:24:49.000
diversified things a little bit.

03:24:49.000 --> 03:24:51.000
Props to you guys at All Games

03:24:51.000 --> 03:24:53.000
Radio for keeping it

03:24:53.000 --> 03:24:55.000
going and Indie Radio.

03:24:55.000 --> 03:24:57.000
And of course, to our pal

03:24:57.000 --> 03:24:59.000
Bobby Blackwolf who's

03:24:59.000 --> 03:25:01.000
always before us here. We love Bobby so

03:25:01.000 --> 03:25:03.000
much. And Brad from

03:25:03.000 --> 03:25:05.000
PodCultured. CriticalMyth

03:25:05.000 --> 03:25:07.000
who's hitting 300 episodes tomorrow.

03:25:07.000 --> 03:25:09.000
Nice.

03:25:09.000 --> 03:25:11.000
And Anime Jam Session

03:25:11.000 --> 03:25:13.000
and Hoard House and Girls Gone

03:25:13.000 --> 03:25:15.000
Wow and British

03:25:15.000 --> 03:25:17.000
Invaders. Have I named everybody now? I think I have.

03:25:17.000 --> 03:25:19.000
Understation Live. Oh my God.

03:25:19.000 --> 03:25:21.000
Understation Live. Well, I don't think that we would

03:25:21.000 --> 03:25:23.000
be here without them. Isn't that

03:25:23.000 --> 03:25:25.000
funny? Is that everybody's

03:25:25.000 --> 03:25:27.000
calling in saying, O-L-R

03:25:27.000 --> 03:25:29.000
you inspire me to do this. O-L-R you

03:25:29.000 --> 03:25:31.000
did this. And I think this is a good note for us to end on

03:25:31.000 --> 03:25:33.000
tonight. You know what? I'm going to sit on this for a minute because I want to end

03:25:33.000 --> 03:25:35.000
on that note. So let me go around and get everybody's

03:25:35.000 --> 03:25:37.000
final thought. Becky,

03:25:37.000 --> 03:25:39.000
thank you so much for being here. I know you didn't get a chance to

03:25:39.000 --> 03:25:41.000
say an awful lot, but we really

03:25:41.000 --> 03:25:43.000
appreciate the culinary delights. And your

03:25:43.000 --> 03:25:45.000
support still means the world to us. So thank you for

03:25:45.000 --> 03:25:47.000
being here. You're welcome.

03:25:47.000 --> 03:25:49.000
It's okay. I'm just, I'm a very

03:25:49.000 --> 03:25:51.000
quiet person. That's alright. Any final thoughts for our listeners

03:25:51.000 --> 03:25:53.000
though? While you're at it? Any

03:25:53.000 --> 03:25:55.000
last words of wisdom?

03:25:57.000 --> 03:25:59.000
Don't let your kids watch Sponge

03:25:59.000 --> 03:26:01.000
Bob.

03:26:01.000 --> 03:26:03.000
It's horrible.

03:26:03.000 --> 03:26:05.000
Dark

03:26:05.000 --> 03:26:07.000
Sakura, your final thought for our listeners tonight?

03:26:07.000 --> 03:26:09.000
Oh, why the fuck not? Reject false

03:26:09.000 --> 03:26:11.000
icons. Ooh,

03:26:11.000 --> 03:26:13.000
taking it back a notch.

03:26:13.000 --> 03:26:15.000
Loki, your final thought tonight? I have two things. One, I have a picture

03:26:15.000 --> 03:26:17.000
of poop on my phone. And two,

03:26:17.000 --> 03:26:19.000
uh, wow.

03:26:19.000 --> 03:26:21.000
Let's do this

03:26:21.000 --> 03:26:23.000
Mark IV style, motherfuckers.

03:26:23.000 --> 03:26:25.000
My final thought

03:26:25.000 --> 03:26:27.000
tonight, as promised, I want to

03:26:27.000 --> 03:26:29.000
say a lot of you gave props

03:26:29.000 --> 03:26:31.000
to us for helping inspire what you do.

03:26:31.000 --> 03:26:33.000
But I really have to say, and I

03:26:33.000 --> 03:26:35.000
got into this on Facebook a little bit before,

03:26:35.000 --> 03:26:37.000
but I really just want to say that, you know,

03:26:37.000 --> 03:26:39.000
I studied radio in college

03:26:39.000 --> 03:26:41.000
and I actually originally was

03:26:41.000 --> 03:26:43.000
going to be a weatherman. That was what I was in

03:26:43.000 --> 03:26:45.000
college to study originally.

03:26:45.000 --> 03:26:47.000
I interned at a broadcast station

03:26:47.000 --> 03:26:49.000
at an actual

03:26:49.000 --> 03:26:51.000
news broadcast in the town I went

03:26:51.000 --> 03:26:53.000
to school in. And although

03:26:53.000 --> 03:26:55.000
everybody was really nice and it was a really great

03:26:55.000 --> 03:26:57.000
eye-opening experience, the way

03:26:57.000 --> 03:26:59.000
my eyes were open was that most people

03:26:59.000 --> 03:27:01.000
were very miserable in the jobs that they were doing and

03:27:01.000 --> 03:27:03.000
it really didn't want to be something I wanted to continue.

03:27:03.000 --> 03:27:05.000
So I kind of got into radio as a result

03:27:05.000 --> 03:27:07.000
of that, but I felt a lot of that same

03:27:07.000 --> 03:27:09.000
stuff. That in commercial radio

03:27:09.000 --> 03:27:11.000
it's really not about who you know, but it's about who

03:27:11.000 --> 03:27:13.000
you blow. And that wasn't really what

03:27:13.000 --> 03:27:15.000
I wanted, you know, contrary to what Jamie might tell

03:27:15.000 --> 03:27:17.000
you about when I drink, that wasn't really what I

03:27:17.000 --> 03:27:19.000
wanted to pursue. So

03:27:19.000 --> 03:27:21.000
I didn't finish school

03:27:21.000 --> 03:27:23.000
because I became very jaded with a lot of it.

03:27:23.000 --> 03:27:25.000
And I was kind of like, what the hell am I wasting my time for?

03:27:25.000 --> 03:27:27.000
I just need to go out into the working world.

03:27:27.000 --> 03:27:29.000
And while I don't hate school and I think it's

03:27:29.000 --> 03:27:31.000
great that a lot of people do go to school and finish

03:27:31.000 --> 03:27:33.000
college and all that, for me at that time

03:27:33.000 --> 03:27:35.000
it was what I needed to do and it was a great

03:27:35.000 --> 03:27:37.000
thing. And I love where I ended up in my career

03:27:37.000 --> 03:27:39.000
so I'm happy. But I'm really thankful

03:27:39.000 --> 03:27:41.000
to my time

03:27:41.000 --> 03:27:43.000
I did spend at the college radio station,

03:27:43.000 --> 03:27:45.000
my very first radio show at KCSC

03:27:45.000 --> 03:27:47.000
Student Radio.

03:27:47.000 --> 03:27:49.000
I just want to say props to that and for my time there.

03:27:49.000 --> 03:27:51.000
And then I also want to say a big thank you to

03:27:51.000 --> 03:27:53.000
Travis Donahue

03:27:53.000 --> 03:27:55.000
from Understation Live for bringing me

03:27:55.000 --> 03:27:57.000
on to his show back in

03:27:57.000 --> 03:27:59.000
what, 2000, 2001

03:27:59.000 --> 03:28:01.000
when I came on to his show for the first

03:28:01.000 --> 03:28:03.000
time. And it was so much fun

03:28:03.000 --> 03:28:05.000
he asked me to come back and I came back

03:28:05.000 --> 03:28:07.000
over and over and over again. And through

03:28:07.000 --> 03:28:09.000
him I learned how easy it was to do a show on

03:28:09.000 --> 03:28:11.000
Live 365. And so

03:28:11.000 --> 03:28:13.000
I, like DJ Rama

03:28:13.000 --> 03:28:15.000
was talking about with his show and

03:28:15.000 --> 03:28:17.000
Code Man was talking about his show and everybody else,

03:28:17.000 --> 03:28:19.000
I said, you know, I want to do something like

03:28:19.000 --> 03:28:21.000
this for the day. And I

03:28:21.000 --> 03:28:23.000
you know, I want to do something like this for the

03:28:23.000 --> 03:28:25.000
DDR community and for

03:28:25.000 --> 03:28:27.000
the, you know, Bamani

03:28:27.000 --> 03:28:29.000
community and all my new friends

03:28:29.000 --> 03:28:31.000
that I've been making playing Dance Dance Revolution.

03:28:31.000 --> 03:28:33.000
And Jamie, of course, was a big part

03:28:33.000 --> 03:28:35.000
of that. We kind of thought of all the basic

03:28:35.000 --> 03:28:37.000
concepts on that Bart ride.

03:28:37.000 --> 03:28:39.000
And then Loki, well, he just tagged along for

03:28:39.000 --> 03:28:41.000
the ride, but this show

03:28:41.000 --> 03:28:43.000
would not be the same without him. I do need to thank Travis, too,

03:28:43.000 --> 03:28:45.000
for having me on as a guest so much and filling in

03:28:45.000 --> 03:28:47.000
for Jessica. Absolutely. Absolutely.

03:28:47.000 --> 03:28:49.000
So, yeah,

03:28:49.000 --> 03:28:51.000
I guess this is in a way

03:28:51.000 --> 03:28:53.000
500 episodes of paying it forward.

03:28:53.000 --> 03:28:55.000
So really appreciate

03:28:55.000 --> 03:28:57.000
it. I don't know what else to say.

03:28:57.000 --> 03:28:59.000
I see lots of great stuff in the

03:28:59.000 --> 03:29:01.000
chat room right now. YYR says, thank you

03:29:01.000 --> 03:29:03.000
guys for 500 great episodes and for devoting

03:29:03.000 --> 03:29:05.000
so much of your time and energy to contribute towards

03:29:05.000 --> 03:29:07.000
all of our lives, ours and yours.

03:29:07.000 --> 03:29:09.000
Tim TRP says, Rob, you have a

03:29:09.000 --> 03:29:11.000
voice for radio, a face for TV

03:29:11.000 --> 03:29:13.000
news and a body for hardcore

03:29:13.000 --> 03:29:15.000
pornography. Wait a minute.

03:29:15.000 --> 03:29:17.000
Wait a minute.

03:29:17.000 --> 03:29:19.000
Oh, Tim.

03:29:19.000 --> 03:29:21.000
Tim. All right.

03:29:21.000 --> 03:29:23.000
I'm going to cry in a second, by the way.

03:29:23.000 --> 03:29:25.000
Are you? What else can I say to make you cry?

03:29:25.000 --> 03:29:27.000
Shut up.

03:29:27.000 --> 03:29:29.000
If someone else brings up Sharmi, maybe.

03:29:29.000 --> 03:29:31.000
The chips are gone.

03:29:31.000 --> 03:29:33.000
I missed them already.

03:29:33.000 --> 03:29:37.000
All right.

03:29:37.000 --> 03:29:39.000
I think it's time we end the show. Thank you guys

03:29:39.000 --> 03:29:41.000
so much for 500 great episodes.

03:29:41.000 --> 03:29:43.000
Let's try to be less sappy next week, you guys.

03:29:43.000 --> 03:29:45.000
I did pick something very, very,

03:29:45.000 --> 03:29:47.000
very classic for Cookie.

03:29:47.000 --> 03:29:49.000
Oh, we'll get to that in a minute.

03:29:49.000 --> 03:29:51.000
All right, that's it. We're done. What do you say, guys?

03:29:51.000 --> 03:29:53.000
We'll do it all again next week, all right?

03:29:53.000 --> 03:29:55.000
Come on back next week for episode

03:29:55.000 --> 03:29:57.000
501.

03:29:57.000 --> 03:29:59.000
Until then,

03:29:59.000 --> 03:30:01.000
have a great week.

03:30:01.000 --> 03:30:03.000
Don't be a dick.

03:30:03.000 --> 03:30:05.000
And have fun. It's only a game.

03:30:05.000 --> 03:30:07.000
Good night.
