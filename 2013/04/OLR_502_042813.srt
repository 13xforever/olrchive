[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft sets a date to announce their next move.

2
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,382
[SPEAKER_04]: More video games are set to become movies.

00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:23,723
[SPEAKER_04]: And can you really get pizza delivered with your 360?

4
00:00:31,943 --> 00:00:37,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

00:00:37,727 --> 00:00:40,069
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:40,729 --> 00:00:47,554
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you to talk about video games and gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle over the next few hours with my co-hosts.

[SPEAKER_06]: First off, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

00:00:51,036 --> 00:00:51,557
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.

00:00:51,837 --> 00:00:52,717
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you, Jamie Summers?

10
00:00:53,798 --> 00:00:54,178
[SPEAKER_01]: Sated.

11
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:56,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Sated or satiated?

12
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Sated.

13
00:00:57,961 --> 00:00:59,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you did have pizza.

14
00:01:00,262 --> 00:01:01,683
[SPEAKER_01]: But wouldn't that be... Oh, whatever.

15
00:01:02,004 --> 00:01:02,304
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

16
00:01:03,745 --> 00:01:05,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Grammar specifics aside.

17
00:01:06,546 --> 00:01:09,568
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to tell Prince Brightstar, I've been playing PSO2.

18
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:12,710
[SPEAKER_06]: What did he ask?

19
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:13,210
[SPEAKER_06]: I missed it.

20
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,953
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he mentioned Phantasy Star Online, too, so I was just affirming that, yes, I did get everything to work.

21
00:01:17,553 --> 00:01:19,434
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

22
00:01:19,494 --> 00:01:20,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that with all the patches and all that stuff?

23
00:01:21,184 --> 00:01:26,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, but I have to repatch my game and redo the translations and blah, and I've had other stuff to play.

24
00:01:27,685 --> 00:01:29,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, also say hello to Tech Master Loki.

25
00:01:30,266 --> 00:01:30,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

26
00:01:30,766 --> 00:01:31,346
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you, Loki?

27
00:01:31,646 --> 00:01:32,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Doing good.

28
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:32,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.

29
00:01:33,266 --> 00:01:34,007
[SPEAKER_06]: What's new with you?

30
00:01:34,387 --> 00:01:35,207
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm collecting drugs.

31
00:01:35,547 --> 00:01:36,647
[SPEAKER_08]: You're collecting drugs?

32
00:01:37,307 --> 00:01:43,128
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm finishing my pickups on the collectibles in Saints Row the Third.

33
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:45,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, I see what you did there.

34
00:01:45,309 --> 00:01:45,629
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

35
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:47,530
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

38
00:02:26,005 --> 00:02:26,926
[SPEAKER_06]: No problem.

[SPEAKER_06]: And also joining us in the studio tonight, say hello to Tim.

40
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:32,670
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.

41
00:02:32,931 --> 00:02:33,511
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you, Tim?

42
00:02:33,991 --> 00:02:35,072
[SPEAKER_00]: I am quaking in my boots.

43
00:02:35,152 --> 00:02:36,693
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my first podcast ever.

44
00:02:36,814 --> 00:02:37,374
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it really?

45
00:02:37,654 --> 00:02:37,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

46
00:02:38,014 --> 00:02:38,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, you're like...

47
00:02:41,397 --> 00:02:45,379
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also Rob's first podcast.

48
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:48,520
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we've stolen your guest virginity.

49
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,121
[SPEAKER_00]: I suppose so.

50
00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:51,921
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a little bit uncomfortable thinking about that.

51
00:02:51,961 --> 00:02:55,423
[SPEAKER_06]: You even got the little virginity music playing there in the background.

52
00:02:56,123 --> 00:02:59,365
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, like every idiot has a podcast in this day and age.

53
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:04,647
[SPEAKER_06]: No disrespect to those who are doing podcasts, but like Captain Spike, I'm calling myself an idiot.

54
00:03:05,007 --> 00:03:08,308
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, like, you know, it's so easy to do that these days.

55
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:09,129
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really surprising.

56
00:03:09,149 --> 00:03:09,869
[SPEAKER_06]: You've never done this before.

57
00:03:13,376 --> 00:03:14,697
[SPEAKER_06]: But we'll be gentle, I promise.

58
00:03:14,937 --> 00:03:15,257
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

59
00:03:15,377 --> 00:03:16,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, you're welcome.

60
00:03:17,578 --> 00:03:18,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Break out the feathers.

61
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:24,522
[SPEAKER_06]: So before we get into how was your gaming week and all that, I want to talk to you guys about the things you guys do.

62
00:03:24,602 --> 00:03:25,643
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to start with Spike.

63
00:03:26,103 --> 00:03:30,226
[SPEAKER_06]: So a few years ago, I know you came on OLR like seven years ago.

64
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:31,766
[SPEAKER_06]: That was back when I lived with Extifer, right?

65
00:03:32,447 --> 00:03:33,267
[SPEAKER_05]: It sure was, yeah.

66
00:03:33,427 --> 00:03:34,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you remember what we even talked about then?

67
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:37,470
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea.

68
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:38,670
[SPEAKER_06]: How did you and I meet?

69
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:39,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell the listeners.

70
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:40,819
[SPEAKER_05]: The internet.

71
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,942
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, we were on a message board.

72
00:03:45,002 --> 00:03:47,223
[SPEAKER_05]: There was an IRL meetup party.

73
00:03:47,303 --> 00:03:52,866
[SPEAKER_05]: We went to said party independently, got drunk, and smoked cloves outside for like an hour.

74
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:54,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't smoke, guys.

75
00:03:54,647 --> 00:03:55,107
[SPEAKER_06]: It's bad for you.

76
00:03:55,127 --> 00:03:56,008
[SPEAKER_05]: No, smoking is bad.

77
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:56,588
[SPEAKER_06]: So we quit.

78
00:03:56,648 --> 00:03:57,229
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I have to ask.

79
00:03:57,249 --> 00:03:58,569
[SPEAKER_01]: They were the Djarams, right?

80
00:03:58,709 --> 00:03:59,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sure.

81
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:00,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, death.

82
00:04:00,871 --> 00:04:01,811
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's anything other.

83
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:05,633
[SPEAKER_06]: So fast forward to today.

84
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:07,614
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got your podcast now.

85
00:04:07,654 --> 00:04:08,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell us about Game Boy.

86
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:08,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

87
00:04:10,415 --> 00:04:13,658
[SPEAKER_05]: I host the Gamebuoy.org video game podcast.

88
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:28,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Our sort of aim is just to pick up stories that are getting left off the radar of all the blogs, sort of pick up stories on indies, JRPGs, just sort of niche genres that maybe aren't getting the play that they really deserve in the news.

89
00:04:30,143 --> 00:04:40,773
[SPEAKER_06]: I joked earlier that any idiot can have a podcast and obviously I'm not being rude with that but it is so easy to do it now but surely you kind of have to take that step like why do I want to do a podcast?

90
00:04:40,793 --> 00:04:42,835
[SPEAKER_06]: So why Captain Spike did you want to do a podcast?

91
00:04:43,618 --> 00:04:57,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, fitting in with what I just said, it kind of irritates me that, and you know, certainly no offense to any podcast, any podcasters that are listening to this, but I really wanted to cover some bases that I feel like aren't getting a lot of coverage.

92
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:58,290
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fair.

93
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:06,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially, you know, we started Retronauts was sort of kind of going away and we have a real strong retro bent to sort of what we do.

94
00:05:07,658 --> 00:05:08,418
[SPEAKER_06]: And you didn't need $35,000 to do this.

95
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:08,879
[SPEAKER_06]: No tea, no shade.

96
00:05:11,115 --> 00:05:12,596
[SPEAKER_05]: No, all tea, all shade.

97
00:05:12,976 --> 00:05:14,557
[SPEAKER_05]: We do it for free.

98
00:05:14,697 --> 00:05:16,058
[SPEAKER_05]: We spend money on it.

99
00:05:16,098 --> 00:05:17,398
[SPEAKER_05]: So no, we're not getting paid.

100
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:17,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

101
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:20,720
[SPEAKER_06]: But I like that you guys have a niche.

102
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:27,264
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've had people ask me before because we have had this podcast a long, long, long, long time.

103
00:05:27,544 --> 00:05:32,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes people will ask when they want to get into a podcast like, hey, Rob, how do I start a podcast?

104
00:05:32,486 --> 00:05:36,769
[SPEAKER_06]: And usually my first thing is, okay, if you're going to start a video game podcast, I'm going to warn you, it's a very â€“

105
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:40,431
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of people in this pool, and people have peed in this pool.

106
00:05:40,451 --> 00:05:43,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's kind of gross.

107
00:05:43,053 --> 00:05:45,194
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of stuff, but you've got to find your niche.

108
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:48,096
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got to be like, how am I going to stand out amongst this?

109
00:05:48,136 --> 00:05:49,798
[SPEAKER_06]: How am I going to wear the prettiest bathing suit?

110
00:05:50,178 --> 00:05:51,619
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to get me noticed, right?

111
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:54,661
[SPEAKER_06]: So you guys have your niche, and I think it's fun.

112
00:05:54,701 --> 00:06:00,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you guys don't just talk about under-the-radar news, but I notice you kind of theme a lot of your episodes.

113
00:06:00,785 --> 00:06:05,989
[SPEAKER_06]: You have your one big topic that keeps a lot of your shows timeless in a way, I noticed.

114
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:06,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

115
00:06:06,297 --> 00:06:18,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that was, you know, very much a conscious choice, but we really wanted to have sort of a level of intellectual discourse about sort of these big topics that a lot of people maybe don't talk about and have, you know, real discussions about.

116
00:06:20,265 --> 00:06:20,665
[SPEAKER_06]: Gotcha.

117
00:06:21,225 --> 00:06:24,307
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's you and, what do you call him on the show?

118
00:06:24,327 --> 00:06:24,987
[SPEAKER_06]: I know his real name.

119
00:06:25,007 --> 00:06:26,748
[SPEAKER_06]: What's his first mate, Slidekick?

120
00:06:26,788 --> 00:06:29,010
[SPEAKER_05]: That is first mate, Slidekick, yeah.

121
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:31,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and you guys have been buds forever, right?

122
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,653
[SPEAKER_05]: I've known that guy for, I don't know, probably 10 years, nearly.

123
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:35,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-huh.

124
00:06:35,359 --> 00:06:39,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and Slykick's my frenemy in the WoW podcasting community, so that's always a lot of fun.

125
00:06:39,302 --> 00:06:43,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you all might remember his classic show, Fabulous Flames.

126
00:06:44,406 --> 00:06:45,667
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have episodes on my phone.

127
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:49,450
[SPEAKER_06]: So you were the subscriber!

128
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:50,410
[SPEAKER_06]: That was me!

129
00:06:50,991 --> 00:06:52,992
[SPEAKER_05]: You were their Legion of Fan.

130
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:56,175
[SPEAKER_01]: It was when I ran out of history podcasts.

131
00:06:56,795 --> 00:06:58,817
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, well, there's always this one.

132
00:06:59,217 --> 00:07:01,179
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd sit in my cube snorting the whole time.

133
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:03,020
[SPEAKER_01]: People were like, what are you on?

134
00:07:04,401 --> 00:07:08,164
[SPEAKER_06]: But we didn't come here just to shade, you know, Slidekick because I was in chat and everything.

135
00:07:09,485 --> 00:07:09,985
[SPEAKER_06]: You're so mean.

136
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:13,907
[SPEAKER_06]: So let me talk about you as a gamer.

137
00:07:13,948 --> 00:07:18,370
[SPEAKER_06]: So obviously you must have been into all the music games and stuff like we were because you were on the show at that time.

138
00:07:20,092 --> 00:07:21,993
[SPEAKER_06]: How did you get into gaming at all?

139
00:07:22,473 --> 00:07:23,794
[SPEAKER_06]: How did you start playing video games?

140
00:07:24,715 --> 00:07:25,695
[SPEAKER_06]: What hooked you into this?

141
00:07:25,755 --> 00:07:26,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are you a gamer?

142
00:07:27,376 --> 00:07:48,060
[SPEAKER_05]: um why am I a gamer um my mother worked in a bowling alley and they had tons of arcade games so I kind of fell in love with Kung Fu and you know the old Irem game I think it was Irem I don't know and uh after that you know got a Nintendo for the NES port Kung Fu and went from there

143
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:49,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

144
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:51,835
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your favorite video games ever?

145
00:07:51,935 --> 00:07:54,577
[SPEAKER_06]: What are your favorite things that have ever been done?

146
00:07:55,818 --> 00:07:57,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Mario World and Bayonetta

147
00:07:58,748 --> 00:08:01,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Bayonetta is one of your top games ever.

148
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:07,575
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it has some of the best situational awareness in a 3D action game that I've ever seen.

149
00:08:08,036 --> 00:08:08,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

150
00:08:08,896 --> 00:08:14,521
[SPEAKER_05]: I really like the way that it visually communicates what it expects of you in terms of reaction and what have you.

151
00:08:14,641 --> 00:08:17,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are not two games you would typically expect to see sitting together.

152
00:08:17,983 --> 00:08:23,047
[SPEAKER_06]: If I'm going to the video game museum, I'm not going to see Mario World next to Bayonetta.

153
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:24,248
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, I think that's great.

154
00:08:24,288 --> 00:08:26,270
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people don't usually dare to name

155
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:46,049
[SPEAKER_06]: For all practical purposes, a current game I mean, I know it's a couple years old at this point But a current generation game as a classic But no, I think that's great I think it's super well designed And I think that Super Mario World is certainly the best designed 2D platformer So you must have been excited about Virtual Console this week?

156
00:08:46,365 --> 00:08:51,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the first thing I did was download it and play it until my second player rage quit on me.

157
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,347
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, but Magic Koopa?

158
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:55,247
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that is crap.

159
00:08:58,247 --> 00:08:59,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Gosh, what else do I want to ask you about games?

160
00:09:00,948 --> 00:09:06,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Bayonetta 2, then, and this whole it's exclusive for Nintendo.

161
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:08,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Where are you at with Nintendo?

162
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's your head at?

163
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:14,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Because some people are very like, Nintendo sucks, and it's a kiddie thing, and da-da-da-da-da.

164
00:09:15,091 --> 00:09:17,112
[SPEAKER_06]: But here they are coming out with Bayonetta 2.

165
00:09:17,312 --> 00:09:18,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's your head at with that?

166
00:09:18,353 --> 00:09:20,854
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they make a lot of really bad business choices.

167
00:09:21,615 --> 00:09:29,720
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that them paying for Bayonetta 2 to exist is awesome, but probably also a bad business choice.

168
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,302
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's one I'm certainly going to benefit from, so I'm happy.

169
00:09:35,030 --> 00:10:01,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to our chatroom, we always have the other guests on our show The live chatroom, live.vognetwork.com Because we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern Right after the Bobby Blackwolf show And looking at our chatroom, we see some comments such as Let's see, Dungeon Buster says Bayonetta rocks Tiger Claw says Kung Fu was one of those games that were quarter munchers Once you had the NES version, you'd blow right through the entire game

170
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:02,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely true.

171
00:10:03,212 --> 00:10:03,713
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.

172
00:10:03,933 --> 00:10:06,938
[SPEAKER_06]: And then does it lose something, though, once you play it on the console?

173
00:10:07,138 --> 00:10:09,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, can you go back and play it in the arcade now that you've just beat it?

174
00:10:10,626 --> 00:10:14,327
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but I mean, you know, I didn't really want to either.

175
00:10:14,567 --> 00:10:21,808
[SPEAKER_05]: I was too busy, you know, taking my picture with my TV and trying to get in to the pages of Nintendo Fun Club, Nintendo Power, you know.

176
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:23,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

177
00:10:24,609 --> 00:10:25,069
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

178
00:10:25,469 --> 00:10:31,911
[SPEAKER_06]: And going to RossDLUT says, Arcade games were nonsensically hard in order to drain quarters.

179
00:10:31,971 --> 00:10:32,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course they were.

180
00:10:33,411 --> 00:10:34,231
[SPEAKER_06]: I always think of that.

181
00:10:34,972 --> 00:10:39,393
[SPEAKER_06]: You remember Wayne's World, which turned 20 years old apparently this month?

182
00:10:40,033 --> 00:10:42,474
[SPEAKER_06]: How old does that make you feel and me feel right now, right?

183
00:10:42,534 --> 00:10:44,434
[SPEAKER_06]: Hearing that Wayne's World is 20 years old, right?

184
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:53,197
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a scene where they're talking about the arcade, and the guy goes, yeah, we just got this new game, and when you kill the gelatinous cube, you get to go to the next level.

185
00:10:53,537 --> 00:10:55,378
[SPEAKER_06]: The trick is there is no gelatinous cube.

186
00:10:55,418 --> 00:10:56,158
[SPEAKER_06]: He never shows up.

187
00:10:57,551 --> 00:11:01,503
[SPEAKER_06]: and I'm like oh that's like so old arcade machine like I love it.

188
00:11:01,604 --> 00:11:04,793
[SPEAKER_05]: That's up there with the boss of Carnival being named Token Taker.

189
00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:37,656
[SPEAKER_06]: uh let's see and um Slagkick in chat uh agreeing with Tim apparently saying Magikoopa is a ratchet hoe there you go thank you Slagkick alright um so if people want to check out your podcast which I do recommend it's a great listen even if you guys are only doing it every other week and I don't know I'd like to see you do it more often but no pressure what's with that what you're being so rude that's a compliment I am a guest no that's a compliment that means I want more of it alright how's that a bad thing

190
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:38,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

191
00:11:38,316 --> 00:11:38,616
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

192
00:11:38,756 --> 00:11:39,357
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.

193
00:11:39,457 --> 00:11:40,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell everybody how they can listen to your show.

194
00:11:40,737 --> 00:11:41,858
[SPEAKER_01]: Good things come to those who wait.

195
00:11:41,998 --> 00:11:42,438
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

196
00:11:43,499 --> 00:11:47,021
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the easiest way to hear us is just to go over to GameBooey.org.

197
00:11:47,801 --> 00:11:50,862
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, we're also on iTunes, GameBooey Podcast.

198
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:52,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Hard to miss.

199
00:11:53,544 --> 00:11:55,605
[SPEAKER_06]: And the art actually looks like a little Game Boy.

200
00:11:55,925 --> 00:11:56,685
[SPEAKER_06]: But Booey.

201
00:11:57,025 --> 00:11:57,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Get it?

202
00:11:57,606 --> 00:11:57,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Booey.

203
00:11:59,505 --> 00:11:59,885
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great.

204
00:12:00,065 --> 00:12:00,426
[SPEAKER_06]: I like it.

205
00:12:00,866 --> 00:12:01,126
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

206
00:12:03,268 --> 00:12:05,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, let me ask one other question about your podcast.

207
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:17,097
[SPEAKER_06]: Since you have a lot of timeless segments, a lot of your shows, you can go back and listen to it now, even though some of the news might be outdated, you've got a good chunk that's timeless.

208
00:12:17,557 --> 00:12:20,299
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think is one of your best episodes out of the ones you've done so far?

209
00:12:20,419 --> 00:12:24,462
[SPEAKER_06]: If I need to go back and find a good conversation, which one would you recommend most?

210
00:12:25,276 --> 00:12:50,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so the longest episode we've done so far is that we did sort of a breakdown on the narrative themes and tropes of Bioshock Infinite, a game which, as a game, I was kind of not really super satisfied with, but I thought actually did some interesting things from a storytelling standpoint, which is not something I normally even think about in terms of games.

211
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:57,994
[SPEAKER_05]: We talked about that for a couple hours and I was really happy with how it came out despite it being unpleasantly long.

212
00:13:00,888 --> 00:13:01,328
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

213
00:13:01,368 --> 00:13:04,491
[SPEAKER_06]: This show's really unpleasantly long, most every week, so it's all good.

214
00:13:06,513 --> 00:13:11,757
[SPEAKER_05]: And we also had a pretty in-depth discussion on LGBT issues in games.

215
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:15,561
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're actually going to do a follow-up on that this summer, so I'm very excited.

216
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:20,445
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a good part to plug the GamerX panel that is coming up.

217
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:24,769
[SPEAKER_06]: GamerX is, what, the first weekend in August in San Francisco, right?

218
00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:34,977
[SPEAKER_06]: And so a bunch of us are all teaming up to do a panel, but the panels are being voted on right now at GamerConnect.com And our panel is Podcast X Zone, right?

219
00:13:35,598 --> 00:13:49,029
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's going to be, and I hope I don't miss anybody, it's going to be, I'm representing OLR And we're hopefully getting some folks from Horde House too, and then of course Game Buoy Podcast The Koopa Club guys out of Chicago are coming out, they're going to be there

220
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:52,651
[SPEAKER_06]: and Game Bar I think has representation, right?

221
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:54,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I leaving anybody out so far?

222
00:13:54,872 --> 00:13:55,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Those shows?

223
00:13:55,653 --> 00:14:00,375
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's it, although we are in talks with a couple other podcasts for representation.

224
00:14:00,535 --> 00:14:03,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so Podcast X Zone at GamerConnect.

225
00:14:03,197 --> 00:14:03,737
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be fun.

226
00:14:04,117 --> 00:14:07,959
[SPEAKER_06]: And I hear they're announcing the guests for GamerCon later tonight, so that's exciting.

227
00:14:07,979 --> 00:14:09,160
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be a fun show.

228
00:14:11,132 --> 00:14:11,573
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

229
00:14:12,193 --> 00:14:19,017
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, before I turn to talk to Tim for a minute, I need to address some people are talking about my audio tonight that I sound a little different.

230
00:14:19,137 --> 00:14:24,081
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we were taping live on Bobby Blackwolf, my usual mic died.

231
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:32,526
[SPEAKER_06]: So in just a few minutes before we went live tonight, I kind of had to resort to a plan B. So if I sound a little more distant than usual tonight, I apologize.

232
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:36,568
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just we had to do a last-minute switch or you wouldn't be able to hear us at all.

233
00:14:36,688 --> 00:14:38,149
[SPEAKER_01]: We replaced Rob with a pod person.

234
00:14:38,269 --> 00:14:38,510
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

235
00:14:39,150 --> 00:15:06,679
[SPEAKER_06]: well I guess I sound a little more distant and I can even see like my levels aren't coming up as usual and I just don't have the time like trying to fix it on the fly and I kind of can't like I'll try to make it a little louder but um hopefully it won't sound too terrible when I listen back to it later because Shane's messaging me in the chat like you're gonna hate listening to this later because you sound off that's probably accurate all right um anyhow let's move on uh Tim

236
00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:08,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

237
00:15:08,179 --> 00:15:09,500
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have a podcast.

238
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:09,980
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't.

239
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

240
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,561
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, you're coming on our show the first time.

241
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:14,561
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a brand new world.

242
00:15:16,202 --> 00:15:17,302
[SPEAKER_06]: You work in the games industry.

243
00:15:17,502 --> 00:15:17,762
[SPEAKER_06]: I do.

244
00:15:17,962 --> 00:15:18,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Who do you work for?

245
00:15:18,822 --> 00:15:20,023
[SPEAKER_06]: I work for Crystal Dynamics.

246
00:15:20,343 --> 00:15:22,463
[SPEAKER_06]: And what would we know out of Crystal Dynamics?

247
00:15:23,104 --> 00:15:24,844
[SPEAKER_06]: We just released a game called Tomb Raider.

248
00:15:25,084 --> 00:15:26,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I think I've heard of that.

249
00:15:26,265 --> 00:15:26,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

250
00:15:26,705 --> 00:15:27,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

251
00:15:27,545 --> 00:15:30,206
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't you guys do that Matt Cross game that never came out?

252
00:15:31,146 --> 00:15:32,186
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that was Crystal Dreams.

253
00:15:34,227 --> 00:15:35,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, do you get that?

254
00:15:35,428 --> 00:15:37,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Do people get confused with the other companies?

255
00:15:37,889 --> 00:15:40,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I know Telltale and Traveler's Tales all the time.

256
00:15:41,471 --> 00:15:43,552
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I've ever gotten confusion about who we are.

257
00:15:43,732 --> 00:15:46,494
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've gotten a lot of people who wonder, who are you?

258
00:15:46,634 --> 00:15:51,697
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll say something like Tomb Raider, or I'll say Legacy of Kain, and suddenly they're like, oh, are you going to make a new Legacy of Kain?

259
00:15:53,518 --> 00:15:55,079
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably the most common question.

260
00:15:55,179 --> 00:15:55,459
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you?

261
00:15:56,821 --> 00:15:57,683
[SPEAKER_00]: No comment!

262
00:15:58,764 --> 00:15:59,125
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.

263
00:15:59,245 --> 00:15:59,946
[SPEAKER_00]: And Deade.

264
00:16:00,046 --> 00:16:00,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.

265
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:03,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, no, I totally respect that, obviously.

266
00:16:05,955 --> 00:16:08,139
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's that DLC for Guardian of Light.

267
00:16:08,239 --> 00:16:08,860
[SPEAKER_00]: There is.

268
00:16:09,381 --> 00:16:10,162
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go get it right now.

269
00:16:10,182 --> 00:16:10,743
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't that enough?

270
00:16:10,923 --> 00:16:11,925
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't that enough for you people?

271
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:17,576
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you say you work on a game like Tomb Raider, what did you do?

272
00:16:17,897 --> 00:16:35,071
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am a software engineer, meaning I program the computers that make them do things Specifically, I work in physics and collision and simulation So a lot of the stuff that moves based on your rigid body or cloth, that was me So when something goes through a wall, we blame you?

273
00:16:36,052 --> 00:16:37,934
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you can blame me Or when the clothes clip?

274
00:16:38,494 --> 00:16:40,356
[SPEAKER_06]: When the clothes clip, you can definitely blame me Okay

275
00:16:41,460 --> 00:17:08,253
[SPEAKER_06]: it's a good thing you didn't work on one of the games I played this week because there was that problem all over not not Tomb Raider let me be clear not Tomb Raider but something else I was like wow like I could see Tim playing this game and like twitching nervously as he's playing it that tends to happen does that happen when you play other games you're like this is this is I would have done this so different I'm always in that zone so I always see those things and that's what I'm looking at I'm looking at the performance of their physics I'm looking at the performance of all of their simulation stuff and I'm

276
00:17:08,853 --> 00:17:09,273
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on.

277
00:17:36,164 --> 00:17:36,804
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.com.

278
00:18:05,768 --> 00:18:07,949
[SPEAKER_06]: How long ago does a game like Tomb Raider start?

279
00:18:08,009 --> 00:18:10,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, how long is the production cycle for a game like Tomb Raider?

280
00:18:10,209 --> 00:18:12,270
[SPEAKER_06]: How long ago did you know you're going to work on Tomb Raider?

281
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,031
[SPEAKER_00]: About five years ago.

282
00:18:14,191 --> 00:18:14,791
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.

283
00:18:14,891 --> 00:18:15,731
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's been a while.

284
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,592
[SPEAKER_06]: How long did you have to keep that a secret?

285
00:18:17,612 --> 00:18:20,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they only announced that, what, two, two and a half years ago?

286
00:18:20,473 --> 00:18:22,934
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to keep that a secret for, yeah, probably about three years.

287
00:18:23,014 --> 00:18:23,594
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my gosh.

288
00:18:24,794 --> 00:18:25,294
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that hard?

289
00:18:26,675 --> 00:18:27,435
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really.

290
00:18:27,975 --> 00:18:29,256
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty antisocial, so...

291
00:18:31,886 --> 00:18:33,967
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the key to NDAs.

292
00:18:34,148 --> 00:18:34,748
[SPEAKER_01]: Be a hermit.

293
00:18:35,128 --> 00:18:35,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

294
00:18:36,729 --> 00:18:38,430
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't go on podcasts for one.

295
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:38,971
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, no.

296
00:18:39,091 --> 00:18:39,931
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good way to make sure.

297
00:18:39,951 --> 00:18:42,233
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very out of character.

298
00:18:42,633 --> 00:18:43,694
[SPEAKER_06]: How did you get into that?

299
00:18:43,954 --> 00:18:45,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me take a step back.

300
00:18:46,175 --> 00:18:50,078
[SPEAKER_06]: What made you say, I want to do physics and video games?

301
00:18:50,198 --> 00:18:54,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, you must have kind of narrowed your path as you went, but how did you end up where you're at?

302
00:18:54,841 --> 00:18:55,601
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.

303
00:18:55,942 --> 00:18:58,763
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a science nerd all my life, but I've also been a computer nerd.

304
00:18:59,323 --> 00:19:01,965
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was this obvious cross-section I didn't see at the time.

305
00:19:02,265 --> 00:19:10,129
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to undergrad for computer science, and later I went to grad school, and I did some more computer graphics and gaming-centric studies.

306
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:18,253
[SPEAKER_00]: And I sort of wanted to bring my science background into that, and I found simulation was sort of the perfect world for me to do some research in.

307
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,772
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you get hooked up with Crystal Dynamics?

308
00:19:22,554 --> 00:19:29,702
[SPEAKER_00]: I had an ex-classmate who worked there as an artist, and he got me an interview.

309
00:19:30,463 --> 00:19:38,572
[SPEAKER_00]: It just happened to be at the right time that they were looking for someone straight out of grad school, and it was the perfect position for me, so I sort of lucked out.

310
00:19:39,488 --> 00:19:41,090
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell them you know someone who does print material.

311
00:19:43,712 --> 00:19:48,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop trying to use this interview as a platform for your own agenda.

312
00:19:48,977 --> 00:19:50,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Going back to Tomb Raider for a minute.

313
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:53,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, a lot of people are playing this game right now.

314
00:19:55,123 --> 00:20:00,829
[SPEAKER_06]: I will respect the situation and not bring up that story that everybody's talking about when it comes to sales and all that, but

315
00:20:01,209 --> 00:20:02,930
[SPEAKER_06]: The game's great, okay?

316
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:03,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

317
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:10,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if you weren't my friend, I truly believe the game is great, and I think a lot of people feel the same way.

318
00:20:12,497 --> 00:20:21,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Or when somebody plays a game like Tomb Raider, and you obviously do a lot with the physics and the environments and so forth, what do you think people miss?

319
00:20:22,283 --> 00:20:30,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there something that you pay a special attention to detail to this, but you think people... I don't want to say necessarily that people don't appreciate it, but maybe it goes unnoticed, this work that you do?

320
00:20:31,789 --> 00:20:32,630
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, certainly.

321
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,871
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of different types of gamers who play Tomb Raider.

322
00:20:34,891 --> 00:20:36,751
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got the people who run right through the game.

323
00:20:37,352 --> 00:20:40,333
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, those people have to play the puzzles, which are based on physics.

324
00:20:40,353 --> 00:20:41,854
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's sort of shoved in their face.

325
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:42,514
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't miss that.

326
00:20:42,934 --> 00:20:50,437
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of nice little touches, little environmental effects, little rigid bodies that are around the world to make everything come to life.

327
00:20:50,797 --> 00:20:52,538
[SPEAKER_00]: Bits of cloth flapping in the breeze.

328
00:20:53,058 --> 00:20:56,560
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff, you know, we spend a good amount of time on that to make that look good and natural.

329
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:11,853
[SPEAKER_00]: and it makes the whole environment come alive but it's not something every gamer is going to sit and look at they sort of will just run by and of course there are the explorers who want to go around and explore every nook and cranny and so they're going to see all those little things they're going to see every detail that's not correct

330
00:21:12,233 --> 00:21:15,414
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds like people that play Skyrim is probably a very similar approach.

331
00:21:15,454 --> 00:21:18,575
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you have some people that are just like, I want to just kill all the villagers and da-da-da.

332
00:21:18,655 --> 00:21:21,575
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, you know, some people are like, I'm going to pick every flower.

333
00:21:23,216 --> 00:21:23,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?

334
00:21:24,396 --> 00:21:27,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, it's a good thing Laura Croft can't pick flowers.

335
00:21:27,237 --> 00:21:27,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Or can she?

336
00:21:27,657 --> 00:21:28,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Did I miss that?

337
00:21:28,077 --> 00:21:28,497
[SPEAKER_00]: She can.

338
00:21:28,617 --> 00:21:28,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my God.

339
00:21:29,077 --> 00:21:30,398
[SPEAKER_06]: There are plants to pick.

340
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:31,078
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

341
00:21:32,678 --> 00:21:34,339
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I'm one of those people who just wants to shoot.

342
00:21:34,399 --> 00:21:37,099
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm having Resident Evil flashbacks.

343
00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:38,460
[SPEAKER_01]: You mix the green herb.

344
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,942
[SPEAKER_00]: and all of those plants that you can run past and then they rustle as you run past them and move.

345
00:21:44,462 --> 00:21:45,062
[SPEAKER_00]: I made those.

346
00:21:45,882 --> 00:21:46,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

347
00:21:47,903 --> 00:21:51,184
[SPEAKER_06]: So I talked a minute ago about how the game is being well received.

348
00:21:51,984 --> 00:22:00,987
[SPEAKER_06]: When you go on Metacritic or one of those sites and you see that overall the reception you're getting is positive is that important for somebody like you?

349
00:22:01,448 --> 00:22:05,509
[SPEAKER_06]: When you look at reviews and that positive affirmation is that something you're like

350
00:22:06,423 --> 00:22:07,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm so happy to see that.

351
00:22:07,864 --> 00:22:10,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Or are you like, eh, it doesn't really change anything?

352
00:22:10,507 --> 00:22:11,808
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm really proud of the game.

353
00:22:11,868 --> 00:22:14,050
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really happy with the whole thing.

354
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:16,352
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really happy with the stuff that I did.

355
00:22:17,613 --> 00:22:22,577
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to tell myself I don't care what the reviews say, but I'll be honest, I love praise.

356
00:22:23,197 --> 00:22:23,397
[SPEAKER_00]: So...

357
00:22:25,639 --> 00:22:28,301
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, being completely blunt here, it's great.

358
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:29,842
[SPEAKER_00]: It is great to read those reviews.

359
00:22:29,962 --> 00:22:32,423
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is sad to read the ones that are not super glowing.

360
00:22:33,104 --> 00:22:35,625
[SPEAKER_00]: And they really, like, stick in my craw.

361
00:22:36,286 --> 00:22:37,847
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh... Sure, sure.

362
00:22:38,207 --> 00:22:41,129
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, you know, it's the same thing when I go look up reviews for this show.

363
00:22:41,429 --> 00:22:43,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I'll go on iTunes and there'll be five-star reviews.

364
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:46,272
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, oh, that person was so awesome to leave that five-star review.

365
00:22:46,352 --> 00:22:46,952
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was awesome.

366
00:22:46,972 --> 00:22:51,295
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you go to, like, a one-star review where, you know, it's like, everybody's screaming all the time.

367
00:22:51,335 --> 00:22:53,637
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm just like, okay, I'm gonna...

368
00:22:54,597 --> 00:22:55,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Take that.

369
00:22:55,598 --> 00:22:58,399
[SPEAKER_01]: At least no one's told you to shut up and get in the kitchen.

370
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,641
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember that one?

371
00:23:01,141 --> 00:23:02,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Did that really happen?

372
00:23:02,121 --> 00:23:02,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

373
00:23:02,582 --> 00:23:03,262
[SPEAKER_05]: That really happened.

374
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:05,483
[SPEAKER_05]: What is wrong with people?

375
00:23:05,683 --> 00:23:07,144
[SPEAKER_01]: This was like after our second year.

376
00:23:08,485 --> 00:23:11,887
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I know what you mean.

377
00:23:11,947 --> 00:23:14,488
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Rob, was that five star review from Mrs. Roberts?

378
00:23:15,069 --> 00:23:15,329
Yes.

379
00:23:17,987 --> 00:23:19,548
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it was from the other Mr. Roberts.

380
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:22,308
[SPEAKER_06]: There's something about me you might not know.

381
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:24,749
[SPEAKER_06]: I was implying that was your mother.

382
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:26,090
[SPEAKER_01]: It was from Rob Robson.

383
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:31,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so everybody in chat is talking about the death scenes.

384
00:23:31,111 --> 00:23:33,512
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, the death scenes, the death scenes.

385
00:23:33,932 --> 00:23:35,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Did Tim do all this stuff with the death scenes?

386
00:23:37,013 --> 00:23:41,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me ask you about... When I think of Tomb Raider, I think of the Conan O'Brien review.

387
00:23:42,515 --> 00:23:43,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you see the Conan O'Brien review?

388
00:23:43,696 --> 00:23:43,916
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.

389
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:44,597
[SPEAKER_06]: It was hilarious.

390
00:23:44,617 --> 00:23:46,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you all sit around in your office and watch it?

391
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:47,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

392
00:23:48,581 --> 00:23:55,106
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's that part where they're doing the tree thing over and over and over, and they're playing it up for laughs.

393
00:23:56,027 --> 00:23:57,449
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's kind of like a serious thing.

394
00:23:57,609 --> 00:24:00,531
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, but did you notice the quality of the laughs?

395
00:24:00,591 --> 00:24:02,153
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't just, oh, that's hilarious.

396
00:24:02,253 --> 00:24:07,277
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like every time, it was first, oh, then laughter.

397
00:24:07,297 --> 00:24:07,698
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

398
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:09,360
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

399
00:24:29,449 --> 00:24:57,041
[SPEAKER_06]: um you know there's there's things in Tomb Raider that are kind of um like I I I see it I don't know if it was intentional but I see elements of like Metroidvania like that type of thing that I don't think was really in Tomb Raider before but I kind of see it in there now um do you do you draw inspiration from other games for Tomb Raider because I know you don't just play Tomb Raider all day every day like because clearly you're wearing a Mass Effect hoodie but I'm also wearing a Tomb Raider t-shirt yeah I know I know I know but uh

400
00:24:58,703 --> 00:25:02,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Since you don't just play Tomb Raider all day every day, do you get inspiration from other games?

401
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:06,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you see things in other games that you want to do with Tomb Raider?

402
00:25:07,657 --> 00:25:10,540
[SPEAKER_00]: I do, however, I'm not really the one making those decisions.

403
00:25:11,121 --> 00:25:12,923
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the creative and the design team.

404
00:25:13,743 --> 00:25:24,574
[SPEAKER_00]: So while there may be games that I like and I think, hey, we should take this element from that game because it's awesome, because there's something to learn there, it's not going to go ignored, but it's not really my place.

405
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:26,797
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the problems I'm trying to solve.

406
00:25:27,297 --> 00:25:30,861
[SPEAKER_00]: There are far more creative and talented people at Crystal Dynamics solving those problems.

407
00:25:31,881 --> 00:25:32,542
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, they do.

408
00:25:32,602 --> 00:25:35,963
[SPEAKER_00]: They definitely take inspiration from other games, from other media.

409
00:25:36,523 --> 00:25:41,645
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a lot of inspiration for this reboot from movies like The Descent and Rambo.

410
00:25:42,145 --> 00:25:46,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, it wasn't... Okay, so when I reviewed Tomb Raider on the show, I totally compared it to The Descent.

411
00:25:46,847 --> 00:25:48,787
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, it is totally like that movie.

412
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:52,869
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some shot-for-shot scene call-outs to scenes in The Descent.

413
00:25:53,069 --> 00:25:56,790
[SPEAKER_00]: We sat, as a studio, back in pre-production, we sat around and we watched that movie.

414
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:58,011
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so scary.

415
00:25:58,091 --> 00:25:59,371
[SPEAKER_00]: It scared the crap out of me.

416
00:26:00,031 --> 00:26:02,072
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw that on the big screen, okay?

417
00:26:02,712 --> 00:26:04,573
[SPEAKER_01]: That movie creeped me out so hard.

418
00:26:04,693 --> 00:26:05,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my gosh.

419
00:26:05,834 --> 00:26:07,495
[SPEAKER_01]: I still like what Alan called the game, though.

420
00:26:08,695 --> 00:26:12,737
[SPEAKER_01]: Lara Croft's really bad, no good, terrible, very bad day.

421
00:26:13,737 --> 00:26:14,958
[SPEAKER_01]: Or whatever that book was.

422
00:26:15,058 --> 00:26:16,959
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I think he also just called it Girl.

423
00:26:17,379 --> 00:26:17,519
Yeah.

424
00:26:20,129 --> 00:26:25,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so girl is the first, the first girl game.

425
00:26:25,314 --> 00:26:28,377
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's, it's the first Tomb Raider game that has multiplayer, you know?

426
00:26:28,998 --> 00:26:32,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and so multiplayer, you know, I, I do the other show about Warcraft.

427
00:26:32,681 --> 00:26:34,303
[SPEAKER_06]: We talk about PV and PVP all the time.

428
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:35,444
[SPEAKER_06]: PVP is unpredictable.

429
00:26:35,764 --> 00:26:38,387
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you don't know, you know what computers are going to do.

430
00:26:38,427 --> 00:26:43,631
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what attacks the, the, the, the boss monsters and so forth are going to do, but you don't know what other people are going to do.

431
00:26:44,392 --> 00:26:50,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Does the unpredictability of multiplayer cause different things when you're planning environments and things like that?

432
00:26:50,678 --> 00:26:52,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have to look at it, take a different approach to that?

433
00:26:53,461 --> 00:26:55,203
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually didn't work on multiplayer.

434
00:26:55,283 --> 00:26:55,543
[SPEAKER_00]: What?

435
00:26:55,663 --> 00:27:00,368
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiplayer was done by our sister studio up in Montreal, Eidos Montreal.

436
00:27:01,109 --> 00:27:05,854
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was made in a relative vacuum with the single player game.

437
00:27:05,954 --> 00:27:07,956
[SPEAKER_00]: We worked on single player in Redwood City.

438
00:27:08,516 --> 00:27:12,017
[SPEAKER_00]: and then in Montreal they worked on multiplayer.

439
00:27:12,037 --> 00:27:17,298
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course there was a little bit of collaboration to keep things in sync, but I was not part of the active development of that.

440
00:27:17,558 --> 00:27:18,318
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.

441
00:27:18,819 --> 00:27:19,179
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

442
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:20,519
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you played the multiplayer?

443
00:27:21,499 --> 00:27:23,140
[SPEAKER_00]: I played a little bit of the multiplayer.

444
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:28,901
[SPEAKER_00]: I shot some people and then I got killed about 10 times more than I shot people, but...

445
00:27:31,723 --> 00:27:34,044
[SPEAKER_06]: You also worked on Guardian of Light a few years ago, right?

446
00:27:34,344 --> 00:27:35,344
[SPEAKER_00]: I did for a little while.

447
00:27:35,384 --> 00:27:36,765
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to bounce around at the studio.

448
00:27:37,165 --> 00:27:37,645
[SPEAKER_00]: That was good.

449
00:27:38,005 --> 00:27:39,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I liked Guardian of Light too.

450
00:27:39,065 --> 00:27:41,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Guardian of Light was more like arcade-y for me.

451
00:27:41,646 --> 00:27:42,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, exactly.

452
00:27:42,746 --> 00:27:43,606
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's not a bad thing.

453
00:27:43,626 --> 00:27:45,587
[SPEAKER_06]: It was on Xbox Live Arcade.

454
00:27:45,607 --> 00:27:46,567
[SPEAKER_06]: This was supposed to happen, right?

455
00:27:47,007 --> 00:27:49,168
[SPEAKER_06]: So here's the thing, though.

456
00:27:49,608 --> 00:27:56,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's what I don't understand about Guardian of Light, and I need help, is that you have the Guardian of Light game, and that's Laura, but then there's the reboot Laura,

457
00:27:58,071 --> 00:28:06,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there two Loras now, or did this game kind of like, no, Guardian of Light, it's not really about that anymore, it's about Laura or what?

458
00:28:06,395 --> 00:28:08,997
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this game was a complete reboot.

459
00:28:09,057 --> 00:28:10,237
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to start over.

460
00:28:10,277 --> 00:28:13,999
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to create a brand new property.

461
00:28:14,019 --> 00:28:15,880
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do everything over.

462
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:19,262
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything that happened beforehand, it all happened in the past.

463
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:20,583
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a different game.

464
00:28:20,683 --> 00:28:21,684
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a different universe.

465
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:23,224
[SPEAKER_00]: We want a fresh start.

466
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:26,026
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to have any baggage from any other games, so.

467
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:28,378
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the equivalent of Marvel's Ultimate Universe.

468
00:28:31,099 --> 00:28:34,461
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say I'm an expert in that, but yes, I suppose so.

469
00:28:34,661 --> 00:28:35,902
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

470
00:28:36,242 --> 00:28:39,424
[SPEAKER_00]: Except I think it would be less lame than the Ultimate Universe is sometimes.

471
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:40,644
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

472
00:28:40,744 --> 00:28:40,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

473
00:28:41,425 --> 00:28:48,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'll stop bugging you about Tomb Raider because I know when it comes to the day job, there's only so many things you do and you don't want to say.

474
00:28:48,328 --> 00:28:50,949
[SPEAKER_06]: But I guess let me just turn it over to you for anything general.

475
00:28:51,089 --> 00:28:55,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there anything you want to tell the listeners about Tomb Raider or about your work or what have you?

476
00:28:57,033 --> 00:28:59,896
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think you guys should all buy it.

477
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:01,958
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd really appreciate that.

478
00:29:03,139 --> 00:29:06,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I should ask you a couple of the general things I asked him.

479
00:29:07,824 --> 00:29:09,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Not even this Tomb Raider and programming and all this.

480
00:29:10,006 --> 00:29:11,428
[SPEAKER_06]: How did you get into just games?

481
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are you a video gamer?

482
00:29:14,232 --> 00:29:17,496
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a video gamer as far back as I can remember, like really young.

483
00:29:17,516 --> 00:29:19,738
[SPEAKER_00]: We had an Atari 2600 in the house.

484
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,322
[SPEAKER_00]: No one else in my family cares about video games except for me.

485
00:29:24,502 --> 00:29:26,324
[SPEAKER_00]: My dad bought it because he thought it would be a hoot.

486
00:29:27,205 --> 00:29:29,387
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I sort of, like, this is mine.

487
00:29:30,067 --> 00:29:32,290
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to have this all the time.

488
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:34,352
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I always bugged them to buy me the new systems.

489
00:29:35,112 --> 00:29:35,913
[SPEAKER_00]: I only got a few.

490
00:29:36,493 --> 00:29:37,354
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the NES.

491
00:29:37,514 --> 00:29:40,436
[SPEAKER_00]: They wouldn't buy me a Super Nintendo, and that was the worst thing in the world.

492
00:29:43,258 --> 00:29:50,904
[SPEAKER_00]: The best thing in the world was to go over to my cousin's house or certain neighbors who had a Super Nintendo because that was the coolest shit ever.

493
00:29:52,565 --> 00:29:53,806
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was a big computer nerd.

494
00:29:53,846 --> 00:29:54,746
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked to program.

495
00:29:54,967 --> 00:30:01,091
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first taught myself how to program, it was in QBasic, and the first things I did was try to make games.

496
00:30:01,712 --> 00:30:02,292
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were horrible.

497
00:30:02,392 --> 00:30:04,734
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

498
00:30:23,769 --> 00:30:24,129
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

499
00:30:24,329 --> 00:30:24,790
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.

500
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:31,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any advice for people that might be wanting to get into the games industry, like people listening to this show that are still in school, like, yeah, I want to work in games.

501
00:30:31,653 --> 00:30:32,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any advice?

502
00:30:33,714 --> 00:30:34,855
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

503
00:30:34,935 --> 00:30:35,455
[SPEAKER_00]: Make games.

504
00:30:35,815 --> 00:30:41,478
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people who want to go into games will go and say, I'm going to be a programmer, so I'm going to go do computer science or something.

505
00:30:41,518 --> 00:30:53,224
[SPEAKER_00]: But when they're done with that program, if they don't have anything to show that's related to games, it's really hard to convince someone who can only hire two or three more engineers that you're worth it compared to the other 20 people who want that job.

506
00:30:53,784 --> 00:30:56,886
[SPEAKER_00]: So, as early as possible, start making games.

507
00:30:58,287 --> 00:30:59,168
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have to be great.

508
00:30:59,488 --> 00:31:00,909
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start modding other games.

509
00:31:00,949 --> 00:31:04,772
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start scripting within packages.

510
00:31:04,812 --> 00:31:06,813
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use free engines like Unity.

511
00:31:07,934 --> 00:31:09,335
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of resources out there.

512
00:31:10,376 --> 00:31:12,277
[SPEAKER_00]: So make as many games as you can.

513
00:31:12,897 --> 00:31:14,318
[SPEAKER_00]: Show people that you're passionate about it.

514
00:31:15,479 --> 00:31:20,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Looking at our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com, Actdeft says, your parents wouldn't buy you a Super Nintendo?

515
00:31:20,964 --> 00:31:22,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Worst parents ever.

516
00:31:22,345 --> 00:31:23,946
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the worst parents ever.

517
00:31:24,606 --> 00:31:25,527
[SPEAKER_00]: Never forgive them for that.

518
00:31:25,547 --> 00:31:26,348
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not nice.

519
00:31:27,549 --> 00:31:31,992
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to save up my own money to buy a Nintendo 64 when that came out.

520
00:31:32,232 --> 00:31:33,473
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to cut a lot of grass.

521
00:31:35,515 --> 00:31:36,075
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.

522
00:31:36,956 --> 00:31:40,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, looking at Blackwolf says, I wrote games in QBasic too.

523
00:31:42,551 --> 00:31:43,332
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for watching!

524
00:31:58,846 --> 00:32:00,607
[SPEAKER_08]: The Classic Tunneling Problem

525
00:32:14,873 --> 00:32:29,079
[SPEAKER_01]: I just remember making the ball bounce on my Texas Instruments computer That was the extent of anything I've ever programmed Oh, the games I made on my TI-82 See, I couldn't do any of that shit I just wanted to talk about games with all my friends

526
00:32:30,819 --> 00:32:31,599
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm with you on this one

527
00:32:46,025 --> 00:32:49,050
[SPEAKER_08]: I got the engine done, but I mean, a TI-82 sucks.

528
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:52,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Square finally did one years later on the PSP, right?

529
00:32:52,555 --> 00:32:59,946
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a guy in my class who sat during the entire class, and by the time he was done, I was playing Pole Position on his graphing calculator.

530
00:33:00,808 --> 00:33:01,268
[SPEAKER_01]: It was awesome.

531
00:33:01,429 --> 00:33:01,689
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

532
00:33:02,233 --> 00:33:04,014
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's another good piece of advice, actually.

533
00:33:04,074 --> 00:33:04,595
[SPEAKER_00]: Start small.

534
00:33:04,635 --> 00:33:10,278
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you laugh at a TI-82, but the constraints there were so tight that it forces you to be creative.

535
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:21,386
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say I used to play Commodore 64 all the time when I was younger and would do the basic, but I would start to type in the programs that were in the back of magazines and then try to modify them a little bit to meet my needs.

536
00:33:22,127 --> 00:33:24,528
[SPEAKER_06]: If I changed a color or something, then I'd be like, I'm the shit.

537
00:33:24,568 --> 00:33:25,249
[SPEAKER_06]: I changed the color.

538
00:33:25,609 --> 00:33:26,249
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know.

539
00:33:26,329 --> 00:33:26,770
[SPEAKER_06]: This is me.

540
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:49,132
[SPEAKER_06]: um okay one more question then we're gonna get into our gaming weeks but uh same thing I asked uh Spike a minute ago what is like your favorite video game ever you're not allowed to name something you worked on oh damn it I'm taking that off the table right now so what so what what's like your favorite video game ever you know what I'm really bad at coming up with favorites yeah hmm well I I

541
00:33:51,593 --> 00:33:54,775
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wearing a jacket for Mass Effect and I'm a huge sci-fi nerd.

542
00:33:55,036 --> 00:33:56,376
[SPEAKER_00]: Mass Effect is one of my favorite series.

543
00:33:56,877 --> 00:33:59,378
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jamie's like... That's why we're all friends.

544
00:33:59,818 --> 00:34:03,080
[SPEAKER_00]: We're great friends because of that.

545
00:34:03,321 --> 00:34:06,663
[SPEAKER_00]: And to create a little controversy with Spike, Super Mario Bros.

546
00:34:06,683 --> 00:34:06,663
3.

547
00:34:06,823 --> 00:34:09,104
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say Super Mario Bros.

548
00:34:09,384 --> 00:34:09,104
3.

549
00:34:09,544 --> 00:34:11,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Your opinion is wrong and you should feel bad for having it.

550
00:34:13,371 --> 00:34:13,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Mario Bros.

551
00:34:13,771 --> 00:34:14,932
[SPEAKER_06]: 3 vs. Super Mario World

552
00:34:33,948 --> 00:34:37,070
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't own Super Mario World because the parents wouldn't get him a Super Nintendo.

553
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:41,272
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your hatred towards Super Mario Bros.

554
00:34:41,632 --> 00:34:41,272
3?

555
00:34:42,132 --> 00:34:44,773
[SPEAKER_05]: If we're being completely honest, it's just me being a hipster.

556
00:34:45,573 --> 00:34:46,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone loves it, so I hate it.

557
00:34:47,074 --> 00:34:48,895
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you said it because I was going to say it if you didn't.

558
00:34:49,135 --> 00:34:49,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I knew you were.

559
00:34:49,835 --> 00:34:50,736
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I cut you off.

560
00:34:50,996 --> 00:34:52,336
[SPEAKER_08]: What are your thoughts on Ocarina, then?

561
00:34:54,157 --> 00:35:00,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I am not a fan of Zelda at all, except for Majora's Mask and Link's Awakening.

562
00:35:03,362 --> 00:35:03,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario 3

563
00:35:26,278 --> 00:35:28,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Mario World or neither one.

564
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Geez.

565
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,542
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm surprised you didn't put Super Metroid on that list.

566
00:35:32,082 --> 00:35:36,445
[SPEAKER_06]: No, because this is about the Marios there.

567
00:35:36,505 --> 00:35:43,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, you have to be a registered participant at live.vognetwork.com and you'll see that pop up right there underneath the chat.

568
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,510
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can vote in the poll.

569
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is better?

570
00:35:45,531 --> 00:35:48,773
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario 3, Super Mario World, or neither one?

571
00:35:49,193 --> 00:35:49,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Geez.

572
00:35:49,974 --> 00:35:50,334
[SPEAKER_01]: Neither.

573
00:35:50,354 --> 00:35:51,515
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Mario is missing.

574
00:35:53,136 --> 00:35:53,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario typing?

575
00:35:53,877 --> 00:35:53,917
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

576
00:35:57,148 --> 00:35:57,688
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see you next time.

577
00:36:24,867 --> 00:36:25,207
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

578
00:36:25,287 --> 00:36:25,987
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.

579
00:36:26,067 --> 00:36:27,368
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for dealing with me.

580
00:36:27,948 --> 00:36:28,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Please.

581
00:36:28,668 --> 00:36:32,849
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll stay here and comment randomly on other things throughout the show with Captain Spike, right?

582
00:36:33,049 --> 00:36:33,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes?

583
00:36:34,149 --> 00:36:34,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Or no, you're out of here.

584
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:35,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

585
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:37,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we're going to take the pizza and go.

586
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:38,931
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

587
00:36:39,211 --> 00:36:42,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

588
00:36:43,372 --> 00:36:44,712
[SPEAKER_06]: So, DarkSakura, why don't you start us off?

589
00:36:45,365 --> 00:36:46,526
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured out I'm old.

590
00:36:47,508 --> 00:36:49,189
[SPEAKER_01]: I played TDR last night.

591
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:52,733
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt like death warmed over after I was done.

592
00:36:52,753 --> 00:36:54,816
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't beat an 8-footer anymore, Rob.

593
00:36:56,037 --> 00:36:57,679
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't do Superstar anymore, Rob.

594
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't think you're gonna be able to just do it the first game either, you know?

595
00:37:03,105 --> 00:37:03,746
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what you need.

596
00:37:04,687 --> 00:37:05,588
[SPEAKER_08]: She needs a montage.

597
00:37:06,648 --> 00:37:07,888
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not need a freaking montage.

598
00:37:07,928 --> 00:37:10,869
[SPEAKER_08]: It's where you get better in a short amount of time.

599
00:37:10,989 --> 00:37:12,729
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotta have a montage.

600
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:19,030
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually though, we're hooking back up the DDR pads in the front room because I have nothing else to do.

601
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:19,950
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm unemployed.

602
00:37:20,811 --> 00:37:34,193
[SPEAKER_01]: So I also I guess I can say now that I'm playing it even though I can't say anything else about it is I'm playing the beta of Final Fantasy XIV.

603
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:35,790
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's Windhurst.

604
00:37:58,382 --> 00:37:58,842
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd say graphically...

605
00:38:28,934 --> 00:38:35,796
[SPEAKER_01]: On par with modern... Which is good, because it's going to be a PlayStation 3 game.

606
00:38:35,816 --> 00:38:42,117
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I would say in a term of graphical sense, just in the processing power required, it's definitely a big step over WoW.

607
00:38:42,777 --> 00:38:43,917
[SPEAKER_01]: That I'm sure I can say.

608
00:38:44,578 --> 00:38:47,778
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, so I've been playing that, no more until June.

609
00:38:48,979 --> 00:38:54,900
[SPEAKER_01]: I started playing Phantasy Star Online 2, thanks to one of our lovely listeners, PrinceBrightStar.

610
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:12,815
[SPEAKER_01]: and I actually there was a patch that happened after I started playing so I basically got through the whole tutorial level and I've made my little redhead Newman person chick and I want an OPA OPA mag

611
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:14,591
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care.

612
00:39:14,831 --> 00:39:25,585
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked my ass off to have an Opa Opa in the first Fantasy Storm Online and goddammit I'm gonna have another Opa Opa and I'm gonna have a Master System because I'm a Sega nerd.

613
00:39:26,494 --> 00:39:28,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though I did have a Super Nintendo as a kid.

614
00:39:28,895 --> 00:39:32,676
[SPEAKER_01]: Technically, it was my brother's, but I did convince my mother to buy it so I could take it over.

615
00:39:34,077 --> 00:39:34,657
[SPEAKER_01]: So, just saying.

616
00:39:35,537 --> 00:39:39,338
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had Rock Band at my birthday party, which I talked about.

617
00:39:39,559 --> 00:39:42,980
[SPEAKER_01]: We left Rock Band out, so I did some... I tried singing alone.

618
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:54,724
[SPEAKER_01]: I played Minecraft last night, trying to get this... Someone made the Ocarina of Time map in Minecraft, so I was trying to get it to load, and I still can't figure out how to get it to load as its own world, so whatever.

619
00:39:55,684 --> 00:40:03,388
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, so instead I just went around in my house building, digging more gopher holes in my house.

620
00:40:04,328 --> 00:40:05,669
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, God, what else did I play?

621
00:40:05,689 --> 00:40:06,429
[SPEAKER_01]: I played something else.

622
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:10,912
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, um, Drunken Robot Pornography, which is super awesome.

623
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:12,272
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like jumping flash on crack.

624
00:40:12,532 --> 00:40:13,533
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been telling everyone about it.

625
00:40:14,533 --> 00:40:19,196
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, I, um, got the indie pack last night.

626
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:21,077
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I've only installed, uh,

627
00:40:21,937 --> 00:40:23,038
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to the Future Back to the Future

628
00:40:42,927 --> 00:40:43,948
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked interesting.

629
00:40:43,968 --> 00:40:44,828
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a neat game.

630
00:40:45,749 --> 00:40:47,050
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've downloaded a few games.

631
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:51,433
[SPEAKER_01]: There's that Dungeon Quest or something.

632
00:40:51,493 --> 00:40:52,273
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a puzzle game.

633
00:40:52,794 --> 00:40:54,915
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's sort of a side-scrolling combat puzzle game.

634
00:40:54,935 --> 00:40:55,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the Dungeon Hearts.

635
00:40:55,896 --> 00:40:56,636
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Dungeon Hearts.

636
00:40:56,656 --> 00:40:57,337
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

637
00:40:57,457 --> 00:40:58,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Shane just did a review of that.

638
00:40:58,617 --> 00:40:59,638
[SPEAKER_06]: It just went up on VOG today.

639
00:40:59,798 --> 00:41:01,499
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was part of the deal.

640
00:41:01,579 --> 00:41:07,803
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, I spent like eight bucks and got some good games and got a really neat chiptune soundtrack that came with it.

641
00:41:08,604 --> 00:41:08,764
[SPEAKER_01]: And...

642
00:41:10,345 --> 00:41:11,386
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't play any of them yet.

643
00:41:11,406 --> 00:41:15,609
[SPEAKER_01]: I just installed a few of them because I have been working on projects.

644
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:18,852
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's my gaming week.

645
00:41:19,753 --> 00:41:20,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Before we go to Loki.

646
00:41:20,873 --> 00:41:21,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

647
00:41:21,274 --> 00:41:21,694
[SPEAKER_01]: One last thing.

648
00:41:22,194 --> 00:41:22,915
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan's been playing Grid 2.

649
00:41:23,996 --> 00:41:24,496
[SPEAKER_06]: The racing game?

650
00:41:24,817 --> 00:41:26,358
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, with his three monitor setup.

651
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:28,199
[SPEAKER_06]: He's such a man.

652
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:29,800
[SPEAKER_01]: So manly, doodly.

653
00:41:30,381 --> 00:41:36,366
[SPEAKER_01]: I put 15 seconds of him playing it on my Tumblr just to show off what his setup looks like.

654
00:41:36,386 --> 00:41:36,606
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

655
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:45,306
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it Awesome Going to the results of our live poll before I go to Loki The results of the live poll Which is better?

656
00:41:45,406 --> 00:41:58,577
[SPEAKER_06]: The winner with 54.17% of the vote Mario 3 Hells yeah Captain Spike Sorry about it I'm going home You're taking your ball and going home?

657
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so Mario 3 is the winner there.

658
00:42:03,863 --> 00:42:06,406
[SPEAKER_06]: But there was a couple votes for neither one.

659
00:42:06,446 --> 00:42:06,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Jeez.

660
00:42:07,348 --> 00:42:11,112
[SPEAKER_06]: But at least it didn't win like the Nintendo question we asked last week.

661
00:42:12,935 --> 00:42:14,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, Loki, how was your gaming week?

662
00:42:15,598 --> 00:42:16,799
[SPEAKER_08]: I bought stuff too.

663
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,281
[SPEAKER_08]: I bought the Grand Theft Auto collection.

664
00:42:19,192 --> 00:42:20,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so, what the hell?

665
00:42:21,513 --> 00:42:22,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, Rockstar Games.

666
00:42:24,035 --> 00:42:26,276
[SPEAKER_08]: During the weekend, it's supposed to be the Steam sale, okay?

667
00:42:26,296 --> 00:42:27,637
[SPEAKER_08]: It's on sale during the weekend.

668
00:42:28,057 --> 00:42:29,918
[SPEAKER_08]: And then today, they're like, guess what?

669
00:42:29,938 --> 00:42:31,179
[SPEAKER_08]: We're pulling fucking double sale.

670
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:32,800
[SPEAKER_08]: We're marking it down again.

671
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:36,382
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, fuck you, I just bought that shit yesterday for twice the price.

672
00:42:36,542 --> 00:42:41,525
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it was $25 for, you know, all the Grand Theft Auto games, but now it's $12 for all the Grand Theft Auto games.

673
00:42:41,865 --> 00:42:43,646
[SPEAKER_08]: So you should seriously buy that if you haven't bought it yet.

674
00:42:45,086 --> 00:42:46,067
[SPEAKER_08]: I picked that up.

675
00:42:46,127 --> 00:42:47,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, the indie bundle as well.

676
00:42:48,128 --> 00:42:51,770
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't really installed anything other than Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

677
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:54,031
[SPEAKER_08]: I still haven't played that though.

678
00:42:54,552 --> 00:42:58,814
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been playing Saints Row the 3rd on PC just trying to 100% everything.

679
00:42:58,914 --> 00:43:03,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Technically, according to the game, I am 100% right now because I have all the unlockables and stuff.

680
00:43:05,818 --> 00:43:10,800
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to do all the Saints book stuff which is really boring from what I remember the last time.

681
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:13,382
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why it pissed me off so much that I lost my save on my 360 because

682
00:43:14,062 --> 00:43:19,206
[SPEAKER_08]: I had all that pretty much done except for one carjacking or one car theft mission.

683
00:43:20,987 --> 00:43:22,168
[SPEAKER_08]: So I had to do it all over again.

684
00:43:23,969 --> 00:43:26,510
[SPEAKER_08]: I played a little bit of Surgeon Simulator 2013.

685
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:29,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, we were talking about that last week.

686
00:43:29,392 --> 00:43:30,473
[SPEAKER_06]: That video was hilarious.

687
00:43:30,553 --> 00:43:32,494
[SPEAKER_06]: That game is fucking hilarious.

688
00:43:32,855 --> 00:43:33,795
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just awesome.

689
00:43:33,815 --> 00:43:34,636
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan got grossed out.

690
00:43:35,376 --> 00:43:36,317
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't know.

691
00:43:36,677 --> 00:43:38,739
[SPEAKER_08]: I still haven't figured out how to do the heart surgery.

692
00:43:38,779 --> 00:43:40,180
[SPEAKER_08]: I had to go watch it on YouTube or something.

693
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,101
[SPEAKER_08]: I managed to... It was...

694
00:43:42,301 --> 00:43:42,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

695
00:44:12,961 --> 00:44:13,401
[SPEAKER_08]: Organ 3.

696
00:44:14,062 --> 00:44:14,422
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

697
00:44:15,142 --> 00:44:17,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Still can't figure out how to get the heart out, though.

698
00:44:17,102 --> 00:44:21,203
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the stomach and the esophagus are still in there.

699
00:44:21,464 --> 00:44:25,165
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can't figure out how to cut it or rip it out.

700
00:44:26,585 --> 00:44:27,145
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know.

701
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:28,045
[SPEAKER_08]: I still can't pass that.

702
00:44:28,546 --> 00:44:33,167
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just threw the heart in there and the alarm clock and assumed that it was... Try pickaxe.

703
00:44:34,087 --> 00:44:34,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Pickaxe?

704
00:44:34,647 --> 00:44:36,048
[SPEAKER_08]: I tried the axe.

705
00:44:36,188 --> 00:44:37,268
[SPEAKER_08]: I tried the saw.

706
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:38,468
[SPEAKER_08]: All I did was kill him.

707
00:44:39,008 --> 00:44:40,829
[SPEAKER_08]: So... I don't know.

708
00:44:41,915 --> 00:44:47,040
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw someone trying to do that one and there was a stint that you could insert in.

709
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:53,307
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one that Dan and I were watching and we just got through the whole part where the guy's messing with his desk and trying to put the floppy.

710
00:44:53,735 --> 00:44:54,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that was hard.

711
00:44:54,355 --> 00:44:56,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I finally got one of the floppies in there and I'm like, oh, this is it.

712
00:44:56,696 --> 00:44:58,036
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, just swallow some pills.

713
00:44:58,056 --> 00:44:59,477
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got diazepam.

714
00:44:59,497 --> 00:45:01,458
[SPEAKER_01]: So swallow some pills and calm yourself.

715
00:45:01,718 --> 00:45:07,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Dungeon Buster is talking about this game in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com saying the kidney transplant video was hilarious.

716
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:09,680
[SPEAKER_06]: The guy tossed the patient's colon out of the back of the ambulance.

717
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:11,321
[SPEAKER_06]: What is wrong with this game?

718
00:45:13,727 --> 00:45:15,328
[SPEAKER_01]: Best game ever or best game ever.

719
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:18,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't make me go to a live poll.

720
00:45:20,111 --> 00:45:21,052
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty awesome.

721
00:45:21,693 --> 00:45:22,693
[SPEAKER_08]: It is pretty awesome.

722
00:45:23,154 --> 00:45:25,535
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, I played a bunch of that.

723
00:45:26,896 --> 00:45:29,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, something I'm going to try to bring back that I tried this week.

724
00:45:30,198 --> 00:45:31,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Very short notice so no one joined.

725
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:33,601
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fine because I still had fun playing it.

726
00:45:34,261 --> 00:45:36,143
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a birthday dinner I had to go to.

727
00:45:36,163 --> 00:45:36,744
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's cool.

728
00:45:36,804 --> 00:45:37,284
[SPEAKER_08]: No worries.

729
00:45:37,324 --> 00:45:39,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, it was very short notice.

730
00:45:39,226 --> 00:45:41,729
[SPEAKER_08]: I decided, hey, let's bring back VOG Game Night.

731
00:45:41,769 --> 00:45:43,130
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what I'm going to start doing.

732
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:47,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Thursdays, 8 to 10-ish, pick a game.

733
00:45:47,475 --> 00:45:47,915
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't matter.

734
00:45:47,935 --> 00:45:48,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever.

735
00:45:48,136 --> 00:45:48,917
[SPEAKER_08]: You can live stream something.

736
00:45:48,937 --> 00:45:49,297
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't care.

737
00:45:49,357 --> 00:45:51,840
[SPEAKER_01]: I already promised Mass Effect 3 playthroughs on Thursday.

738
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:52,220
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's fine.

739
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, why don't you play Mass Effect 3 with the VOG listeners?

740
00:45:54,983 --> 00:45:55,503
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, fuck no.

741
00:45:55,543 --> 00:45:56,504
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not playing Mass Effect 3.

742
00:45:57,145 --> 00:45:57,285
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

743
00:45:57,525 --> 00:45:59,185
[SPEAKER_08]: VOG Game Night will never be Mass Effect 3.

744
00:45:59,225 --> 00:45:59,545
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

745
00:45:59,625 --> 00:46:01,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless I'm out one night and then you can host it.

746
00:46:02,166 --> 00:46:06,207
[SPEAKER_06]: At any game convention there's multiple games to pick from so I'm sure it'll be fine.

747
00:46:07,187 --> 00:46:17,289
[SPEAKER_08]: This coming week I'm going to do a repeat of Minecraft XBLA which is fine because I haven't actually played that in a while so I played that for two or three hours and it was fun.

748
00:46:17,969 --> 00:46:24,670
[SPEAKER_08]: I miss that because even with Minecraft, because we're playing creative right now on the server that we have of the VOG server but

749
00:46:26,269 --> 00:46:27,270
[SPEAKER_08]: Survival is kind of fun.

750
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:33,155
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, for a while, then you wanted to start getting creative with it and cheating and stuff.

751
00:46:33,196 --> 00:46:35,618
[SPEAKER_08]: But for now, I mean, it was a lot of fun.

752
00:46:35,638 --> 00:46:39,001
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was kind of fun to kind of play something different than just creative mode.

753
00:46:39,902 --> 00:46:41,003
[SPEAKER_08]: And I forgot that you have to eat.

754
00:46:41,443 --> 00:46:42,864
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, oh, shit, that's right.

755
00:46:43,105 --> 00:46:44,986
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to do that now.

756
00:46:45,747 --> 00:46:46,648
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was kind of fun.

757
00:46:48,029 --> 00:46:49,811
[SPEAKER_08]: So I played that and...

758
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:51,970
[SPEAKER_08]: God, what else?

759
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:53,731
[SPEAKER_08]: I know there's got to be some other shit I played.

760
00:46:54,231 --> 00:46:55,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Call of Duty.

761
00:46:55,752 --> 00:47:02,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I've been playing Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 through the campaign because I've been running out of people to play multiplayer with.

762
00:47:02,716 --> 00:47:04,037
[SPEAKER_08]: We're trying to get more people in.

763
00:47:04,977 --> 00:47:08,959
[SPEAKER_08]: So I played a little bit of multiplayer, but played a lot of the campaign.

764
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:10,240
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's okay.

765
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,941
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of comparable.

766
00:47:12,261 --> 00:47:16,524
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I think I played Defiance one of these nights, which is still fun.

767
00:47:16,944 --> 00:47:17,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Good.

768
00:47:17,364 --> 00:47:17,904
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you watch the show?

769
00:47:17,924 --> 00:47:18,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you watching the show, too?

770
00:47:18,684 --> 00:47:19,524
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm not watching the show.

771
00:47:19,564 --> 00:47:20,325
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a sci-fi show.

772
00:47:20,345 --> 00:47:21,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on.

773
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:23,645
[SPEAKER_08]: I know where the bar's set on that, okay?

774
00:47:23,705 --> 00:47:24,366
[SPEAKER_08]: How rude!

775
00:47:24,686 --> 00:47:25,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't he rude right now?

776
00:47:26,406 --> 00:47:26,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Rude?

777
00:47:26,946 --> 00:47:27,446
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

778
00:47:27,506 --> 00:47:28,006
[SPEAKER_08]: Sci-fi.

779
00:47:28,026 --> 00:47:31,167
[SPEAKER_08]: Purveyors of such wonderful films as, you know, Shark the Puss.

780
00:47:31,427 --> 00:47:33,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, oh, oh, you meant sci-fi the network.

781
00:47:33,507 --> 00:47:34,628
[SPEAKER_08]: No, sci-fi the network.

782
00:47:34,668 --> 00:47:38,168
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm not dogging sci-fi, like, the genre.

783
00:47:38,249 --> 00:47:40,669
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm saying sci-fi the TV network.

784
00:47:40,689 --> 00:47:42,069
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, that's acceptable.

785
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:43,690
[SPEAKER_08]: That's fine.

786
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:45,070
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I just...

787
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:47,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Manskito.

788
00:47:50,092 --> 00:47:50,492
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

789
00:47:51,572 --> 00:47:54,854
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure it's good, but I'm not into the world.

790
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:57,055
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if it was like a Borderlands game, it'd be even better.

791
00:47:58,115 --> 00:47:59,476
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not excited about Sharknado?

792
00:48:02,444 --> 00:48:03,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's in Sharknado?

793
00:48:03,585 --> 00:48:06,548
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a legit thing.

794
00:48:06,588 --> 00:48:11,493
[SPEAKER_00]: Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus starring the wonderful Debra Gibson.

795
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:19,421
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's something that I am kind of interested in seeing, or at least seeing the riff tracks of, is they have a Birdemic sequel coming out.

796
00:48:19,902 --> 00:48:20,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Birdemic 2.

797
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:22,465
[SPEAKER_00]: That warranted a sequel?

798
00:48:22,885 --> 00:48:23,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

799
00:48:23,406 --> 00:48:24,387
[SPEAKER_08]: The guy thought it was good.

800
00:48:25,108 --> 00:48:26,350
[SPEAKER_08]: And so he made another movie.

801
00:48:26,811 --> 00:48:28,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, he seriously thinks it's good.

802
00:48:28,633 --> 00:48:32,558
[SPEAKER_08]: I think what he thinks is, hey, I make a really shitty movie and I make a ton of money from it.

803
00:48:33,239 --> 00:48:33,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Done.

804
00:48:34,301 --> 00:48:35,122
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna spend another 10,005 days.

805
00:48:37,512 --> 00:48:38,333
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob found it, Sharknado.

806
00:48:38,353 --> 00:48:45,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Sharknado will have Ian Ziering from Beverly Hills 90210 and Tara Reid is the star of Sharknado.

807
00:48:45,719 --> 00:48:46,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Is she going to be the shark?

808
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:47,321
[SPEAKER_06]: I am here for that.

809
00:48:47,421 --> 00:48:48,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, when does this come on?

810
00:48:48,942 --> 00:48:50,464
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

811
00:48:52,445 --> 00:48:53,947
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to look at IMDB to figure out.

812
00:48:53,967 --> 00:48:55,788
[SPEAKER_08]: So what exactly is a Sharknado?

813
00:48:55,848 --> 00:48:58,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that like a tornado with sharks in it?

814
00:48:59,031 --> 00:49:00,152
[SPEAKER_08]: Tiger Claw, help me out.

815
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:01,753
[SPEAKER_01]: Good idea, bad idea.

816
00:49:04,796 --> 00:49:10,700
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, Rob, we do have to bring back your post-Horde House multiplayer stream.

817
00:49:12,121 --> 00:49:12,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

818
00:49:12,881 --> 00:49:13,842
[SPEAKER_06]: I like doing the live streaming.

819
00:49:13,862 --> 00:49:17,304
[SPEAKER_01]: Where I turn into a very potty-mouthed person.

820
00:49:17,645 --> 00:49:19,186
[SPEAKER_08]: What they need is just do Landsharks.

821
00:49:19,366 --> 00:49:24,189
[SPEAKER_08]: Landsharks and have, like, you know... But it has to be, like... Knock on the door and go, Candy Graham.

822
00:49:25,154 --> 00:49:29,259
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, in the interest of time, I gotta derail this and get us back on track.

823
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,362
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

824
00:49:31,602 --> 00:49:33,725
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, this week, Minecraft again.

825
00:49:33,885 --> 00:49:34,866
[SPEAKER_08]: So Minecraft XBLA.

826
00:49:35,547 --> 00:49:37,229
[SPEAKER_08]: There's gonna be a thread on the forums.

827
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:41,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully we can put up a calendar or something like that so we can plan ahead with what's up.

828
00:49:41,475 --> 00:49:42,776
[SPEAKER_08]: And also let me know what games you want to play.

829
00:49:43,437 --> 00:49:43,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Not Mass Effect 3.

830
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,160
[SPEAKER_06]: I will try to make this quick.

831
00:49:49,801 --> 00:49:50,501
[SPEAKER_06]: I had fun.

832
00:49:50,561 --> 00:49:53,022
[SPEAKER_06]: We went to Golfland, Spike, Tim and I yesterday.

833
00:49:53,703 --> 00:50:06,028
[SPEAKER_06]: And well, not that there was that much to play there, but I did play some DDR and I about died after one set of songs because, you know, just being 34 now and trying to get up on the machine and just jumping into a set of songs.

834
00:50:06,368 --> 00:50:06,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob.

835
00:50:07,768 --> 00:50:14,470
[SPEAKER_06]: But come on, I don't have the stamina I had when I was 24 because I haven't been playing DDR every day like I used to then.

836
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:17,330
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, and I don't work out or anything like that.

837
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:20,771
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a little difficult to just get up there and do it.

838
00:50:21,271 --> 00:50:22,772
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was fun.

839
00:50:23,672 --> 00:50:25,172
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot about DDR I really miss.

840
00:50:25,432 --> 00:50:28,833
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to kind of throw that out there for the longtime Bomani fans.

841
00:50:29,153 --> 00:50:30,634
[SPEAKER_01]: There is one thing I forgot to say, by the way.

842
00:50:30,875 --> 00:50:31,035
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

843
00:50:31,215 --> 00:50:34,158
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I was at the arcade at John's Incredibly Crappy Pizza.

844
00:50:34,618 --> 00:50:35,939
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a Doodle Jump arcade game.

845
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they had that at RVGL, too.

846
00:50:38,021 --> 00:50:38,502
[SPEAKER_06]: I was surprised.

847
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:39,723
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

848
00:50:39,943 --> 00:50:42,305
[SPEAKER_06]: They also have one for Fruit Ninja, but I think we've talked about that before.

849
00:50:42,626 --> 00:50:42,946
[SPEAKER_01]: As you were.

850
00:50:42,966 --> 00:50:44,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, yeah, yeah.

851
00:50:44,367 --> 00:50:49,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so as far as console games go, we were playing a lot of fun stuff last night.

852
00:50:49,932 --> 00:50:54,777
[SPEAKER_06]: We were trying to find four-player games on Xbox Live, so I think we touched, what, Perfect Dark, Doom...

853
00:50:55,425 --> 00:50:57,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Aegis Wing, which somebody commented on Facebook.

854
00:50:57,726 --> 00:50:58,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are you playing that?

855
00:50:58,626 --> 00:50:59,646
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, it's four players.

856
00:50:59,986 --> 00:51:00,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up.

857
00:51:01,526 --> 00:51:04,667
[SPEAKER_06]: And You Don't Know Jack, which is probably the best out of the four-player games.

858
00:51:05,407 --> 00:51:07,988
[SPEAKER_06]: This random-ass Tetris game I had that wasn't bad either.

859
00:51:08,128 --> 00:51:10,048
[SPEAKER_06]: The THQ published one, yeah.

860
00:51:10,248 --> 00:51:10,888
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't bad.

861
00:51:11,168 --> 00:51:12,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Tetris Evolution.

862
00:51:12,129 --> 00:51:14,269
[SPEAKER_06]: It's years old, but not bad.

863
00:51:15,409 --> 00:51:18,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, but as far as new games go, there was one new game I played.

864
00:51:19,288 --> 00:51:38,267
[SPEAKER_06]: and I wrote a review of this that you can read at vognetwork.com and the game is Dead Island Riptide and I gave it a D plus on the site I didn't there was a lot about it I didn't really care for but I want to acknowledge that I realize there's a lot of people that already know like Dead Island Riptide I am totally here for this like

865
00:51:38,687 --> 00:51:40,409
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

866
00:51:59,207 --> 00:52:01,948
[SPEAKER_06]: But for me, I found it to have a lot of technical challenges.

867
00:52:02,848 --> 00:52:07,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, for instance, zombies that, you know, I would be facing one direction and I'd suddenly turn.

868
00:52:08,089 --> 00:52:12,690
[SPEAKER_06]: And suddenly when the zombie's in my field of vision, it just, it was starting to get up and it would just fall down.

869
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:13,770
[SPEAKER_06]: And then get back up again.

870
00:52:13,850 --> 00:52:16,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, just this weird stuff that would happen.

871
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:17,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, just kidding.

872
00:52:17,470 --> 00:52:21,671
[SPEAKER_06]: And then these shadow effects that were kind of not good.

873
00:52:22,131 --> 00:52:25,132
[SPEAKER_06]: And some other, it's all environmental too, Tim.

874
00:52:25,152 --> 00:52:25,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

875
00:52:25,792 --> 00:52:29,214
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, in the five minutes I saw of it, I wasn't super impressed.

876
00:52:29,854 --> 00:52:33,816
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, from a technical standpoint, I wasn't that satisfied.

877
00:52:33,956 --> 00:52:35,536
[SPEAKER_06]: I found it to be a bit repetitive.

878
00:52:37,277 --> 00:52:41,059
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, if you like the first game, this is more of the same.

879
00:52:41,499 --> 00:52:45,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Which, for fans of the first game, I'm sure is not going to be a bad thing.

880
00:52:45,201 --> 00:52:48,022
[SPEAKER_06]: So I kind of think you already know where you stand on Dead Island Riptide.

881
00:52:48,442 --> 00:52:51,884
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to tell you, go check it out if you're on the bubble.

882
00:52:52,501 --> 00:52:56,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, mostly just Monster Hunter Ultimate.

883
00:53:15,854 --> 00:53:17,935
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't stand the demo of that game.

884
00:53:17,995 --> 00:53:18,555
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up?

885
00:53:18,655 --> 00:53:19,835
[SPEAKER_05]: The demo is awful.

886
00:53:20,055 --> 00:53:25,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so what am I missing by not... Well, for one, I hate it when companies put out horrible demos.

887
00:53:26,017 --> 00:53:27,237
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's been a trend recently.

888
00:53:27,637 --> 00:53:30,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Ni No Kuni, terrible demo, great game.

889
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:32,259
[SPEAKER_06]: What else?

890
00:53:32,279 --> 00:53:33,379
[SPEAKER_06]: There was another one not that long ago.

891
00:53:33,399 --> 00:53:34,179
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really bad too.

892
00:53:34,459 --> 00:53:38,961
[SPEAKER_06]: And now we got this Monster Hunter that I didn't know anything about Monster Hunter.

893
00:53:39,421 --> 00:53:42,922
[SPEAKER_06]: And I played this demo and I'm like, nope.

894
00:53:42,942 --> 00:53:43,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.

895
00:53:44,082 --> 00:53:45,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Delete, but you are really into this.

896
00:53:45,943 --> 00:53:46,583
[SPEAKER_06]: What am I missing?

897
00:53:46,863 --> 00:53:49,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, it's largely a skill-based game.

898
00:53:50,144 --> 00:54:04,168
[SPEAKER_05]: There is some advancement through gearing and what have you, but largely the whole point of the game is sort of learning the mechanics, learning how sort of the enemy behaviors interact with sort of their timing windows for when they're vulnerable to attack and

899
00:54:04,924 --> 00:54:05,605
[SPEAKER_05]: I really like it.

900
00:54:05,645 --> 00:54:08,129
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a very cerebral take on the action game.

901
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:10,312
[SPEAKER_05]: But the demo is awful.

902
00:54:10,352 --> 00:54:12,354
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't communicate what's expected of you at all.

903
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:17,462
[SPEAKER_05]: It just gives you some big weapons, some toned down monsters, and just says, oh, hack them until they're dead.

904
00:54:18,122 --> 00:54:21,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, you know, cool, but I'm not really here for that.

905
00:54:22,988 --> 00:54:25,249
[SPEAKER_05]: But for the full game, I actually find it very compelling.

906
00:54:25,289 --> 00:54:28,151
[SPEAKER_05]: I've put in something like 120 hours already.

907
00:54:28,271 --> 00:54:28,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

908
00:54:29,531 --> 00:54:30,272
[SPEAKER_06]: That's commitment.

909
00:54:30,512 --> 00:54:35,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm the kind of guy who usually picks up games, I'll buy a $50 game, play a couple hours, and never touch it again.

910
00:54:36,475 --> 00:54:37,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is an awful thing.

911
00:54:37,895 --> 00:54:38,916
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that's cool.

912
00:54:39,036 --> 00:54:39,996
[SPEAKER_05]: You and me both, buddy.

913
00:54:40,317 --> 00:54:42,438
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I felt comfortable saying that to you.

914
00:54:43,258 --> 00:54:44,859
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called Gamer ADD.

915
00:54:45,379 --> 00:54:47,880
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, oh, I'm going to check out some Dead Island Riptide.

916
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:48,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, shiny.

917
00:54:49,321 --> 00:54:49,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

918
00:54:49,981 --> 00:54:50,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

919
00:54:50,781 --> 00:54:51,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, shit, Steam Stale?

920
00:54:52,638 --> 00:54:53,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Download, download, download, download.

921
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:54,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

922
00:54:55,061 --> 00:54:55,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

923
00:54:55,781 --> 00:55:00,125
[SPEAKER_05]: But that and, you know, all of the gaming that you just mentioned that we did last night.

924
00:55:00,646 --> 00:55:07,012
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've been playing Super Mario World on Wii U and Mega Man 4 on my 3DS.

925
00:55:08,493 --> 00:55:08,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Good times.

926
00:55:09,454 --> 00:55:11,016
[SPEAKER_06]: You're a big fan of the Mega Man series, right?

927
00:55:11,216 --> 00:55:11,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Huge fan.

928
00:55:12,077 --> 00:55:12,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah?

929
00:55:12,777 --> 00:55:12,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

930
00:55:13,138 --> 00:55:15,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so which one's your favorite out of all the games?

931
00:55:19,354 --> 00:55:20,615
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm giving you an expectant look.

932
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:21,595
[SPEAKER_05]: The number series.

933
00:55:21,876 --> 00:55:23,297
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually, I'm going to go with three.

934
00:55:23,437 --> 00:55:24,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's one of the two correct answers.

935
00:55:24,938 --> 00:55:25,378
[SPEAKER_01]: I can forgive you.

936
00:55:26,259 --> 00:55:27,240
[SPEAKER_05]: I do love two.

937
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:37,287
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem is I've played it so many times that it's less of, oh, I'm enjoying doing this and more of like, oh, hey, watch me get through this stage without using Flash Man's ability.

938
00:55:39,129 --> 00:55:40,770
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're talking about Quick Man's level then?

939
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:41,851
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

940
00:55:42,612 --> 00:55:43,772
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, what's your favorite of the X?

941
00:55:44,613 --> 00:55:45,134
[SPEAKER_05]: The first one.

942
00:55:45,994 --> 00:55:47,215
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even have to think about that.

943
00:55:47,255 --> 00:55:48,116
[SPEAKER_05]: I replay it every year.

944
00:55:49,329 --> 00:55:50,269
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave that to Rob recently.

945
00:56:13,004 --> 00:56:14,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's definitely a good idea.

946
00:56:14,766 --> 00:56:21,215
[SPEAKER_05]: For some reason, for 3 Ultimate, they removed the tutorials that used to be in-game in the other iterations of Monster Hunter.

947
00:56:21,936 --> 00:56:24,960
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really know why they did that, but it makes the manual even more important.

948
00:56:26,066 --> 00:56:26,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

949
00:56:27,187 --> 00:56:34,153
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it was funny last night we were playing Tetris and I couldn't figure out like why our multiplayer mode was not doing the line increase thing that you expect to see.

950
00:56:34,553 --> 00:56:36,074
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, wait a minute, this game's from 2006.

951
00:56:36,375 --> 00:56:37,335
[SPEAKER_06]: It still has a manual.

952
00:56:37,395 --> 00:56:38,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me go find it.

953
00:56:40,258 --> 00:56:42,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Not, oh, let me get out my iPad and log on.

954
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:45,322
[SPEAKER_06]: So Tim, what's a weekend gaming look like for you?

955
00:56:45,382 --> 00:56:46,023
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your gaming week?

956
00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:50,533
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm, well, I've been playing a lot of Picross 3D on my DS.

957
00:56:51,054 --> 00:56:51,634
[SPEAKER_00]: All casual.

958
00:56:52,815 --> 00:56:53,216
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.

959
00:56:53,396 --> 00:57:01,062
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a fun thing to do if I have five or ten minutes right before bed or I was playing it on the couch before the show started.

960
00:57:02,403 --> 00:57:08,388
[SPEAKER_00]: I played a little bit of Mass Effect 3 on Insanity because everything else is boring and slow now compared to that.

961
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:14,093
[SPEAKER_00]: And as Spike mentioned earlier, I played some Super Mario World.

962
00:57:15,354 --> 00:57:16,997
[SPEAKER_00]: the inferior game to Super Mario Bros.

963
00:57:17,257 --> 00:57:29,777
[SPEAKER_00]: 3 judging you we played until I died about 15 times in a row to Magic Koopa and quit in a fit of rage so yeah I do that if I get too frustrated with something

964
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:31,480
[SPEAKER_06]: So does Rob.

965
00:57:32,561 --> 00:57:33,021
[SPEAKER_06]: I've done this.

966
00:57:33,121 --> 00:57:34,222
[SPEAKER_06]: This legitimately happened.

967
00:57:34,262 --> 00:57:39,266
[SPEAKER_06]: We were playing Ice Climber, but the part he leaves out is that he lost all his lives.

968
00:57:39,447 --> 00:57:43,830
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was just playing by myself and then I got frustrated and I said, you know what?

969
00:57:43,870 --> 00:57:44,231
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm done.

970
00:57:44,871 --> 00:57:45,412
[SPEAKER_06]: I got 10 minutes.

971
00:57:45,472 --> 00:57:45,852
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll show.

972
00:57:46,092 --> 00:57:46,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Out.

973
00:57:48,064 --> 00:57:51,985
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't put as many hours into it as Spike has, but I've been playing Monster Hunter as well.

974
00:57:53,365 --> 00:57:57,506
[SPEAKER_00]: I am new to the Monster Hunter series, so I came at it from a brand new perspective.

975
00:57:57,907 --> 00:57:58,827
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty daunting.

976
00:57:59,387 --> 00:58:02,248
[SPEAKER_00]: They sort of plop you in the game.

977
00:58:03,428 --> 00:58:07,009
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot about the game that I find really, really annoying.

978
00:58:07,429 --> 00:58:15,635
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of the interface, the tiny text, just the really clunky nature of getting quests and it all feels really artificial.

979
00:58:16,055 --> 00:58:21,659
[SPEAKER_00]: But that all being said, I totally understand why the game works for people.

980
00:58:21,759 --> 00:58:26,322
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it really did in some ways sink its teeth into me and I wanted to get that next set of armor.

981
00:58:26,382 --> 00:58:28,023
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to kill that next monster.

982
00:58:28,603 --> 00:58:31,145
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did have a lot of fun with it despite the frustrations.

983
00:58:32,711 --> 00:58:38,335
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like I'm missing out on this game that everybody's into and I just couldn't get into it.

984
00:58:38,476 --> 00:58:41,078
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I had a friend in Japan be one of the campers.

985
00:58:42,118 --> 00:58:42,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, really?

986
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:43,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

987
00:58:43,379 --> 00:58:46,402
[SPEAKER_01]: Camped out for, I think, three different Monster Hunter games.

988
00:58:46,482 --> 00:58:47,122
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh.

989
00:58:47,483 --> 00:58:48,584
[SPEAKER_00]: Having a manual probably helped.

990
00:58:49,124 --> 00:58:50,125
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't look at the manual.

991
00:58:50,705 --> 00:58:51,746
[SPEAKER_00]: Spike was my manual.

992
00:58:52,527 --> 00:58:56,069
[SPEAKER_00]: And even then, with somebody who knows what they're talking about, it's still hard.

993
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:58,571
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really steep learning curve to just jump into it.

994
00:59:00,072 --> 00:59:03,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft in our chatroom asking, Captain Spike, you a King of Fighters fan?

995
00:59:03,994 --> 00:59:08,156
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if that came from an earlier conversation or what, but are you a King of Fighters fan?

996
00:59:08,456 --> 00:59:08,817
[SPEAKER_05]: I am.

997
00:59:09,657 --> 00:59:11,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone had mentioned KOF in the chat.

998
00:59:12,018 --> 00:59:12,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's where that came from.

999
00:59:13,419 --> 00:59:13,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1000
00:59:13,799 --> 00:59:15,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Got it.

1001
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:18,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a particular one in the series that you prefer?

1002
00:59:18,982 --> 00:59:23,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I've been collecting the cartridges for my Neo Geo, so basically all the ones I have already.

1003
00:59:23,964 --> 00:59:24,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1004
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:25,431
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching!

1005
00:59:44,624 --> 00:59:46,866
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't, I mean, yeah, it was basically unfinished.

1006
00:59:47,467 --> 00:59:48,888
[SPEAKER_05]: My Shiranui wasn't even in it.

1007
00:59:48,928 --> 00:59:49,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, how do you do that?

1008
00:59:50,049 --> 00:59:51,030
[SPEAKER_01]: It was awful.

1009
00:59:51,070 --> 00:59:57,977
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like the one where, was it both Kyo and Iori were powered down?

1010
00:59:59,338 --> 01:00:00,059
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not a good one.

1011
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:02,559
[SPEAKER_06]: All your upvotes, we need them.

1012
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:29,501
[SPEAKER_06]: to make that panel happen.

1013
01:00:29,941 --> 01:00:33,103
[SPEAKER_06]: So please check that out and plan on coming out and saying hi.

1014
01:00:34,164 --> 01:00:36,526
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's get into some gaming news for the week.

1015
01:00:36,786 --> 01:00:39,749
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think Loki's going to start us off tonight.

1016
01:00:39,889 --> 01:00:40,890
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going on in the gaming world?

1017
01:00:41,310 --> 01:00:46,354
[SPEAKER_08]: So Microsoft's going to finally say something about the next Xbox system on May 21st.

1018
01:00:47,375 --> 01:00:48,256
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1019
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:03,211
[SPEAKER_08]: There's rumors!

1020
01:01:04,873 --> 01:01:09,257
[SPEAKER_08]: A source told Polygon some few things.

1021
01:01:10,478 --> 01:01:12,140
[SPEAKER_08]: I love sources.

1022
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,301
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always a source.

1023
01:01:13,441 --> 01:01:14,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Always a source.

1024
01:01:14,202 --> 01:01:15,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, right, right.

1025
01:01:16,364 --> 01:01:16,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

1026
01:01:17,005 --> 01:01:20,488
[SPEAKER_06]: For shits and giggles, let's dissect this shit too.

1027
01:01:20,568 --> 01:01:20,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.

1028
01:01:21,349 --> 01:01:21,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do it.

1029
01:01:22,269 --> 01:01:26,110
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's some details that they're apparently talking about.

1030
01:01:26,330 --> 01:01:31,171
[SPEAKER_08]: First off, you know, saying that, yes, system will be always online.

1031
01:01:32,351 --> 01:01:35,572
[SPEAKER_08]: However, it's not as bad as it sounds.

1032
01:01:35,752 --> 01:01:44,893
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, basically saying that also the system will be able to capture video and will do so similar to a DVR and you'll be able to pick highlights and stuff.

1033
01:01:44,913 --> 01:01:49,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds very similar to the PlayStation 4 and what they were talking about there.

1034
01:01:50,274 --> 01:02:15,271
[SPEAKER_08]: and you'll be able to share those on the web and then also that it's gonna the online only part of it it is gonna have basically kind of a check for your games but it's gonna they're gonna leave it up to the publishers to decide whether the games are gonna be requiring a constant internet connection or not oh gee that let yes leave it in the hands of them

1035
01:02:19,504 --> 01:02:29,611
[SPEAKER_08]: That, to me, sounds like that the publishers will be handling servers and stuff, so... If live goes down, you can't play that game.

1036
01:02:30,192 --> 01:02:32,974
[SPEAKER_08]: If their server goes down, you can't play that game.

1037
01:02:34,074 --> 01:02:35,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Your internet goes down, you can't play that game.

1038
01:02:36,916 --> 01:02:38,598
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, it sounds lame.

1039
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:48,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, again, this is the same rumor that's been going... Now it's just this new spin on the same rumor, and it's kind of like... I'm kind of sick about theorizing on this one, because I think...

1040
01:02:49,145 --> 01:03:00,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, with so much fallout from that guy on Twitter and the fact that we thought we were going to hear about this in April and now it's May, it kind of makes me think a lot of this shit's still up in the air.

1041
01:03:01,418 --> 01:03:06,223
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm not sure we can really thumb down any of this online stuff yet.

1042
01:03:06,323 --> 01:03:06,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

1043
01:03:06,904 --> 01:03:10,787
[SPEAKER_08]: And they say one of the other things that's going to change is the way achievements are working.

1044
01:03:10,927 --> 01:03:16,373
[SPEAKER_08]: They're saying they're going to basically kind of remove the cap, I guess, for achievements.

1045
01:03:16,393 --> 01:03:21,278
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to say make it even easier for publishers and developers to add achievements later on.

1046
01:03:21,358 --> 01:03:26,182
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, say, they want you to notice a certain thing or focus on a certain part of a level or something.

1047
01:03:26,422 --> 01:03:28,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Or download the DLC and get the more achievements.

1048
01:03:28,785 --> 01:03:30,426
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they do that anyways, but yeah.

1049
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:38,253
[SPEAKER_08]: and then also they were saying that the friends list size is going to increase.

1050
01:03:38,854 --> 01:03:39,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, finally!

1051
01:03:39,634 --> 01:03:40,835
[SPEAKER_08]: The cap is going to be removed.

1052
01:03:40,935 --> 01:03:41,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Finally!

1053
01:03:42,297 --> 01:03:42,917
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about time.

1054
01:03:43,698 --> 01:03:46,600
[SPEAKER_06]: I was supposed to happen several years ago when they shut off Halo 2.

1055
01:03:46,841 --> 01:03:47,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I remember that.

1056
01:03:48,962 --> 01:03:51,124
[SPEAKER_08]: So apparently that's now going to happen somehow.

1057
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:55,188
[SPEAKER_06]: That one I believe.

1058
01:03:55,428 --> 01:03:57,450
[SPEAKER_06]: For what it's worth, I believe that one.

1059
01:03:59,389 --> 01:04:02,693
[SPEAKER_06]: That seems legit, yes.

1060
01:04:06,158 --> 01:04:06,879
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, I mean...

1061
01:04:08,922 --> 01:04:12,566
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not even going to bother debating this stuff to death because we've done it already.

1062
01:04:12,626 --> 01:04:23,235
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guarantee you with it, what, four weeks away, five weeks away from this reveal, we're probably going to have another fucking rumor article every goddamn week leading up to it.

1063
01:04:23,375 --> 01:04:23,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course.

1064
01:04:23,755 --> 01:04:32,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Because everybody wants to get those rumors out there because, God forbid, when actually the information comes out and they're wrong, they'll say, well, the details changed.

1065
01:04:33,704 --> 01:04:34,965
[SPEAKER_08]: We got you that news.

1066
01:04:35,085 --> 01:04:36,626
[SPEAKER_06]: No shit, they changed.

1067
01:04:37,127 --> 01:04:41,030
[SPEAKER_06]: I was having a friendly debate on Twitter earlier this week with another podcaster.

1068
01:04:41,490 --> 01:04:43,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think they know the name?

1069
01:04:43,952 --> 01:04:45,653
[SPEAKER_06]: I still don't think they know the name.

1070
01:04:47,394 --> 01:04:48,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Xbox something.

1071
01:04:50,056 --> 01:04:52,779
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's going to be an Xbox something.

1072
01:04:53,539 --> 01:04:56,001
[SPEAKER_06]: My reasoning for that is that a lot of times they go back.

1073
01:04:56,021 --> 01:04:59,944
[SPEAKER_06]: I think with PlayStation that's another thing.

1074
01:05:00,264 --> 01:05:01,345
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're going to call it PlayStation 4.

1075
01:05:01,545 --> 01:05:02,146
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a safe bet.

1076
01:05:02,566 --> 01:05:22,555
[SPEAKER_06]: but in the case of Nintendo they didn't pick Wii U until really close to that press conference and you might remember at E3 that signage none of the signage said Wii U besides that logo at their press conference it always new Nintendo console so this Xbox they may still be I mean hey you gotta have a new name for this console you gotta go out in like two seconds here how about Chuck?

1077
01:05:22,595 --> 01:05:24,656
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's what you're gonna do with it?

1078
01:05:26,077 --> 01:05:31,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Wii U I'm just chucking in the trash stop

1079
01:05:32,386 --> 01:05:36,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you made up your mind on the next Xbox without having seen the official word?

1080
01:05:36,331 --> 01:05:37,352
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I was just being a smartass.

1081
01:05:37,412 --> 01:05:37,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

1082
01:05:37,933 --> 01:05:38,413
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fair enough.

1083
01:05:42,197 --> 01:05:43,818
[SPEAKER_08]: I've put this out there already before.

1084
01:05:44,679 --> 01:05:50,402
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's got any sort of online only, even if it's for DRM, which I don't like the idea of that.

1085
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:57,486
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's going to prevent me from playing any of my games at all if I'm not connected to the internet, I'm not buying the console.

1086
01:05:57,726 --> 01:06:02,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'm not connected to the internet all the time at work where I play a lot of my games.

1087
01:06:03,909 --> 01:06:05,430
[SPEAKER_08]: So it doesn't benefit me.

1088
01:06:05,730 --> 01:06:12,035
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have a need to do that when I can pick up another console or keep the console I have and have no problems with it.

1089
01:06:12,055 --> 01:06:12,755
[SPEAKER_01]: I just thought of a good name.

1090
01:06:14,016 --> 01:06:14,796
[SPEAKER_01]: The X-Tesseract.

1091
01:06:16,477 --> 01:06:22,021
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to say what I said before on this whole thing, too, is that, you know, what's the trade-off?

1092
01:06:22,361 --> 01:06:24,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we know what PlayStation 4 is bringing to the table.

1093
01:06:24,923 --> 01:06:26,244
[SPEAKER_06]: We know it will play used games.

1094
01:06:26,284 --> 01:06:30,987
[SPEAKER_06]: We know it doesn't require the ping and all this stuff and, you know, the stuff they were showing in the press conference.

1095
01:06:33,869 --> 01:06:37,231
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever's more strict system, what's the benefit?

1096
01:06:38,231 --> 01:06:39,252
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going to be the trade-off?

1097
01:06:39,512 --> 01:06:46,435
[SPEAKER_08]: And the other thing, too, is if these are... The only way they could get away with something like that is if both them and PlayStation were doing it.

1098
01:06:47,356 --> 01:06:52,038
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, you know, theoretically, if you're going to say, oh, I have to buy... I have to.

1099
01:06:52,158 --> 01:06:54,559
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm being held at gunpoint to buy a new system.

1100
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:57,681
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, then I guess I'll buy a Wii U or something.

1101
01:06:57,901 --> 01:07:00,062
[SPEAKER_08]: And Nintendo's like, ah, yay!

1102
01:07:00,222 --> 01:07:00,502
[SPEAKER_08]: But no.

1103
01:07:00,822 --> 01:07:02,243
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, seriously, I don't know...

1104
01:07:04,708 --> 01:07:05,108
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1105
01:07:06,849 --> 01:07:12,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, I don't think we'll hear anything about whether it's online only or whatever because they just won't talk about it.

1106
01:07:12,951 --> 01:07:15,311
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not going to say, hey, there's DRM on this.

1107
01:07:15,331 --> 01:07:16,892
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to have to read between the lines on that.

1108
01:07:17,492 --> 01:07:19,773
[SPEAKER_06]: It depends if they take questions from the press or not.

1109
01:07:20,822 --> 01:07:23,484
[SPEAKER_06]: which I kind of think the executives will have to.

1110
01:07:23,744 --> 01:07:24,665
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll have to address it.

1111
01:07:25,126 --> 01:07:26,847
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they'll have to talk to investors.

1112
01:07:26,887 --> 01:07:30,470
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's going to be investors that want to know based on everything that happened on Twitter.

1113
01:07:31,551 --> 01:07:32,532
[SPEAKER_06]: So, anyhow.

1114
01:07:33,192 --> 01:07:35,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about things that you really can do on Xbox right now.

1115
01:07:36,055 --> 01:07:37,456
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a reality right now.

1116
01:07:37,576 --> 01:07:40,738
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the new Pizza Hut app available on the Xbox 360.

1117
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Captain Spike, did you just perk up over there?

1118
01:07:45,082 --> 01:07:48,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, you just gave me a reason to turn on my Xbox for the first time in like a month.

1119
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:54,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you can actually order pizza online from your 360.

1120
01:07:54,290 --> 01:08:03,137
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't done this yet, but what I love about it is that it's got that same crossbar aesthetic that everything else on Xbox has.

1121
01:08:03,658 --> 01:08:05,259
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

1122
01:08:05,279 --> 01:08:07,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Does it have Kinect functionality?

1123
01:08:07,381 --> 01:08:08,161
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet it does.

1124
01:08:08,582 --> 01:08:13,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me just use my hand to wave over to the extra bacon toppings.

1125
01:08:14,307 --> 01:08:16,689
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish it had the stuff that Japanese pizzas do.

1126
01:08:16,989 --> 01:08:18,150
[SPEAKER_01]: I want mayonnaise on my pizza.

1127
01:08:18,604 --> 01:08:19,265
[SPEAKER_06]: You never know.

1128
01:08:19,365 --> 01:08:19,845
[SPEAKER_06]: You never know.

1129
01:08:20,326 --> 01:08:24,109
[SPEAKER_00]: Same when you remember the old anti-piracy ads from like five or ten years ago.

1130
01:08:25,050 --> 01:08:27,212
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't download a pizza.

1131
01:08:30,195 --> 01:08:30,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Slash pizza.

1132
01:08:31,557 --> 01:08:32,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you can.

1133
01:08:32,898 --> 01:08:33,739
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a reality.

1134
01:08:35,629 --> 01:08:35,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

1135
01:08:37,230 --> 01:08:41,312
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, you can order online through the app.

1136
01:08:41,573 --> 01:08:46,235
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't done this yet, but I'm assuming it's probably not much different than ordering online.

1137
01:08:46,315 --> 01:08:47,616
[SPEAKER_06]: I have ordered a pizza online.

1138
01:08:48,416 --> 01:08:49,477
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a lot of us have done that.

1139
01:08:49,537 --> 01:08:51,298
[SPEAKER_06]: I imagine it's really not that much different than that.

1140
01:08:52,638 --> 01:08:53,899
[SPEAKER_06]: So why not?

1141
01:08:53,979 --> 01:08:58,061
[SPEAKER_06]: And I like this quote from Larry Erb in an interview with Polygon.

1142
01:08:58,561 --> 01:08:59,542
[SPEAKER_06]: He's Major Nelson, of course.

1143
01:09:00,202 --> 01:09:03,403
[SPEAKER_06]: We're always looking at ways to give our audience more of what they're interested in.

1144
01:09:03,563 --> 01:09:05,684
[SPEAKER_06]: If you look at our audience, they love pizza.

1145
01:09:05,904 --> 01:09:07,265
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, who doesn't?

1146
01:09:08,245 --> 01:09:13,708
[SPEAKER_06]: It has international appeal, and Pizza Hut is a recognized brand that matches up well with the Xbox brand.

1147
01:09:14,687 --> 01:09:16,368
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1148
01:09:40,526 --> 01:09:40,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Pizzahot.com

1149
01:09:59,534 --> 01:10:04,217
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be ways to download your food because they've already got biological printers.

1150
01:10:04,237 --> 01:10:05,758
[SPEAKER_01]: What's to say they're not going to have food printers?

1151
01:10:06,419 --> 01:10:09,681
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the... What is it from Star Trek?

1152
01:10:09,701 --> 01:10:10,181
[SPEAKER_01]: The Replicator.

1153
01:10:10,201 --> 01:10:11,122
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have Replicators.

1154
01:10:11,282 --> 01:10:11,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop the world.

1155
01:10:11,823 --> 01:10:12,183
[SPEAKER_01]: This is amazing.

1156
01:10:12,203 --> 01:10:13,484
[SPEAKER_01]: You like food.

1157
01:10:16,966 --> 01:10:20,887
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought the FBI went after people that tried to do this biological stuff.

1158
01:10:21,247 --> 01:10:21,547
Anyhow.

1159
01:10:40,444 --> 01:10:43,065
[SPEAKER_01]: I want a replicator so I can go tea, Earl Grey, hot.

1160
01:10:43,905 --> 01:10:45,486
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though I really hate Earl Grey tea.

1161
01:10:46,446 --> 01:10:46,826
[SPEAKER_01]: Too hot!

1162
01:10:46,846 --> 01:10:51,907
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to tell you, Dungeon Buster, that the Romulan ale that you used to buy at the Star Trek Experience was lame!

1163
01:10:53,888 --> 01:10:54,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Just get a warp core breach.

1164
01:10:54,968 --> 01:10:55,809
[SPEAKER_01]: You won't feel your feet.

1165
01:10:56,109 --> 01:10:56,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

1166
01:10:56,649 --> 01:10:56,889
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1167
01:10:58,029 --> 01:10:58,990
[SPEAKER_06]: More news, DarkSakura.

1168
01:10:59,370 --> 01:11:00,010
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.

1169
01:11:00,410 --> 01:11:02,891
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Nintendo is... While you read this, I'm gonna go get tea.

1170
01:11:03,191 --> 01:11:04,831
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Rob, get me some pizza, too, please.

1171
01:11:04,931 --> 01:11:05,252
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1172
01:11:06,012 --> 01:11:06,272
[SPEAKER_01]: Hearts...

1173
01:11:07,165 --> 01:11:08,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I look like your bitch?

1174
01:11:09,608 --> 01:11:10,530
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to get served.

1175
01:11:12,232 --> 01:11:13,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you're about to get served.

1176
01:11:14,015 --> 01:11:15,176
[SPEAKER_06]: You're about to get served.

1177
01:11:16,058 --> 01:11:17,159
[SPEAKER_01]: Hearts, love you, mean it.

1178
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:18,401
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, anyway.

1179
01:11:18,922 --> 01:11:23,909
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Nintendo is skipping E3 press conference.

1180
01:11:24,326 --> 01:11:30,488
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be doing small conferences with direct material and they're trying a new presentation style.

1181
01:11:32,188 --> 01:11:34,429
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're focusing on the software lineup for the U.S.

1182
01:11:34,509 --> 01:11:42,551
[SPEAKER_01]: market and going to be doing closed events for American distributors and another closed hands-on event for the gaming media.

1183
01:11:43,371 --> 01:11:44,732
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, they're like, E3!

1184
01:11:45,982 --> 01:11:46,202
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

1185
01:11:48,223 --> 01:12:02,446
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, from the last Nintendo Direct, they were putting out release dates for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS games with the Yoshi Island and the Mario Party and the Legend of Zelda Link to the Past sequel, which I totally want.

1186
01:12:03,866 --> 01:12:11,068
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're just trying to do it in smaller groups, let it out so that everybody can be disappointed in increments.

1187
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:17,383
[SPEAKER_08]: I just... They did this last year with... They had the press conference and then they had three Nintendo Directs.

1188
01:12:17,643 --> 01:12:21,525
[SPEAKER_08]: And it just... Such a waste of time.

1189
01:12:21,785 --> 01:12:24,667
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just so... It wasn't like there was a ton of information.

1190
01:12:24,687 --> 01:12:28,509
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just they drug it on for so long.

1191
01:12:28,969 --> 01:12:31,291
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, okay, here, we're going to talk about the 3DS.

1192
01:12:31,851 --> 01:12:36,273
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, and this one's about the Wii U. Oh, and this one's about the 3DS games that are for older kids.

1193
01:12:36,594 --> 01:12:38,655
[SPEAKER_08]: And this one's about our press conference.

1194
01:12:39,095 --> 01:12:39,335
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like...

1195
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:48,050
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it says that they're actually trying to be, I guess, a little more direct with how they're giving the information.

1196
01:12:49,389 --> 01:12:59,078
[SPEAKER_01]: But, I don't know, it just sort of does seem like kind of a snub at the whole E3, and especially since Rob said earlier, the feel of E3 has changed.

1197
01:12:59,579 --> 01:13:03,222
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't seem quite like the big information source that it used to be.

1198
01:13:03,602 --> 01:13:09,408
[SPEAKER_01]: It's turned into, look at our ads, look at the big circle thing that EA has in their booth every year.

1199
01:13:10,368 --> 01:13:14,012
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's more about the flash and less about the information.

1200
01:13:14,540 --> 01:13:16,361
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they just don't have anything new to show.

1201
01:13:18,522 --> 01:13:20,783
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't think Nintendo has anything new to show?

1202
01:13:20,963 --> 01:13:21,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I do.

1203
01:13:21,824 --> 01:13:24,385
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a make or break year for Nintendo.

1204
01:13:24,725 --> 01:13:24,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1205
01:13:25,045 --> 01:13:25,866
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as that Wii U is concerned.

1206
01:13:25,886 --> 01:13:29,008
[SPEAKER_08]: And how well have they done so far in the first third of the year?

1207
01:13:29,948 --> 01:13:31,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, fantastic.

1208
01:13:31,869 --> 01:13:34,610
[SPEAKER_08]: They're really edging on the break side of Nintendo.

1209
01:13:34,991 --> 01:13:41,214
[SPEAKER_06]: We could go three years ago on this very show and replace the word Wii U with 3DS and it would be the same conversation.

1210
01:13:41,980 --> 01:13:48,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and it took them a year to pull it around, and a price drop almost immediately.

1211
01:13:48,443 --> 01:13:50,043
[SPEAKER_08]: And who's to say that's not going to happen again?

1212
01:13:51,144 --> 01:13:52,104
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it's going to happen again.

1213
01:13:53,645 --> 01:13:55,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's why I don't think it's going to happen again.

1214
01:13:55,085 --> 01:13:59,187
[SPEAKER_08]: It's because their 3DS is doing well, and they're making plenty of profit from that.

1215
01:13:59,327 --> 01:14:02,288
[SPEAKER_08]: So they don't really give a shit right now that the Wii U is not doing well.

1216
01:14:03,168 --> 01:14:29,457
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of like this was one of those articles I read it it was all over Twitter and I was like wow that's really weird and then I go well you know that makes a lot of sense like people really just you know they've dumped on those Nintendo press conferences and I think that the element of the game of press conferences and so forth has changed they don't have a new console to show they only want to show games and you you said it yourself a minute ago people don't want to sit through all this other crap that they don't care about and

1217
01:14:29,677 --> 01:14:31,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Give me the information targeted at me.

1218
01:14:32,318 --> 01:14:32,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

1219
01:14:32,939 --> 01:14:33,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Good night.

1220
01:14:45,544 --> 01:15:02,275
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, the 25 year anniversary of Luigi no one gives a shit, especially when you go on about it long, long, long time and you're like, oh by the way, we don't actually have any really new games for Luigi other than the already announced Luigi's Mansion game for 3DS but we have DLC for a Mario game!

1221
01:15:03,275 --> 01:15:04,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Sweet!

1222
01:15:04,155 --> 01:15:05,056
[SPEAKER_08]: That's sort of Luigi.

1223
01:15:05,076 --> 01:15:08,037
[SPEAKER_08]: That's almost like a new game, but not.

1224
01:15:08,457 --> 01:15:11,718
[SPEAKER_08]: See, we understand online because we put out DLC.

1225
01:15:12,178 --> 01:15:13,098
[SPEAKER_08]: We're hip, we're cool.

1226
01:15:13,398 --> 01:15:14,839
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just like those other consoles.

1227
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:15,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Love us.

1228
01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:20,261
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't think they have anything new to show.

1229
01:15:20,901 --> 01:15:26,323
[SPEAKER_08]: The stuff they were talking about releasing first quarter of this year hasn't come out yet.

1230
01:15:26,483 --> 01:15:29,644
[SPEAKER_08]: We're talking third quarter when that stuff is finally hitting the market.

1231
01:15:30,624 --> 01:15:36,536
[SPEAKER_08]: So really the only new thing, if you call it new, is going to be the HD remake of Wind Waker.

1232
01:15:37,238 --> 01:15:39,242
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe one more game, but...

1233
01:15:40,307 --> 01:16:03,856
[SPEAKER_08]: that's it they don't really have much to announce are they really going to talk about Pikmin again or Wii Fit U again or you know they have 3DS games which if you know they have a ton of 3DS games coming out so no worries there but as far as the Wii U goes they don't really have anything to show Spike I want to come to you with this because I know you've been following this stuff a very long time as well and probably are going to say something about it on your own show what do you think of Loki's on the right track

1234
01:16:05,236 --> 01:16:12,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, you know, we know that they have a Mario Universe, as we're all expecting it to be called.

1235
01:16:12,785 --> 01:16:17,310
[SPEAKER_05]: And Kart 8, they've already said those are going to be playable on the floor at E3.

1236
01:16:18,351 --> 01:16:19,753
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, they said they're going to show...

1237
01:16:20,934 --> 01:16:24,536
[SPEAKER_05]: The new Smash Brothers game in video and picture form.

1238
01:16:25,357 --> 01:16:29,079
[SPEAKER_05]: So they have some things to show, but I don't think they have a great deal to show.

1239
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:33,943
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is probably a good choice for them to do sort of a scaled down presentation.

1240
01:16:33,963 --> 01:16:39,046
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of have to agree after the floptasticness of the last couple of E3 conferences.

1241
01:16:40,509 --> 01:16:49,953
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and again, I appreciated at last year's E3, for example, that Nintendo took a lot of time to talk about game mechanics and game design of Nintendo Land, of all things.

1242
01:16:50,033 --> 01:16:53,935
[SPEAKER_05]: But still, at least they were talking about game design rather than boobs and explosions, I guess.

1243
01:16:57,696 --> 01:17:00,517
[SPEAKER_08]: If they did talk about boosts and explosions, I think they'd sell more consoles.

1244
01:17:01,538 --> 01:17:03,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Sad commentary on games.

1245
01:17:03,038 --> 01:17:03,979
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds like my house.

1246
01:17:04,619 --> 01:17:06,340
[SPEAKER_08]: You do know it has Bayonetta 2, right?

1247
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:07,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Eventually.

1248
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:08,981
[SPEAKER_08]: No, seriously.

1249
01:17:09,121 --> 01:17:10,761
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's the problem with Nintendo.

1250
01:17:10,821 --> 01:17:14,282
[SPEAKER_08]: They talk a big game like how we're going to target the core audience.

1251
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:20,325
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to target those older people that want to play games on the Wii U and stuff.

1252
01:17:20,465 --> 01:17:23,326
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's fucking child game, child game, child game, child game.

1253
01:17:23,406 --> 01:17:23,866
[SPEAKER_08]: Mario.

1254
01:17:24,346 --> 01:17:25,427
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, Mario sells.

1255
01:17:25,507 --> 01:17:28,149
[SPEAKER_08]: It's, you know, for everybody, I guess.

1256
01:17:28,189 --> 01:17:31,352
[SPEAKER_08]: But there are no real... I don't think they take it seriously.

1257
01:17:31,432 --> 01:17:39,838
[SPEAKER_08]: They just kind of... You know, this time around, they said, okay, listen, we're not going to put on a lot of games right now, first quarter, because we're going to let third parties kind of shine, I guess.

1258
01:17:39,938 --> 01:17:40,439
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, pfft.

1259
01:17:41,159 --> 01:17:46,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, that amazing Spider-Man game from last year really shone on your console.

1260
01:17:46,964 --> 01:17:50,066
[SPEAKER_08]: And, oh, Need for Speed Most Wanted that came out back in the fall.

1261
01:17:50,486 --> 01:17:50,847
[SPEAKER_08]: Woo!

1262
01:17:50,907 --> 01:17:52,988
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome now, coming out in March.

1263
01:17:53,129 --> 01:17:53,389
[SPEAKER_08]: You know...

1264
01:17:53,889 --> 01:18:00,535
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the definitive version now because it's... Well, you know, Nintendo couldn't expect that Ubisoft was going to be like, LOL, bye bitch.

1265
01:18:01,076 --> 01:18:05,620
[SPEAKER_01]: I still think that they're making a big mistake making Bayonetta 2 a Wii U exclusive.

1266
01:18:06,601 --> 01:18:07,081
[SPEAKER_01]: Sega is.

1267
01:18:08,823 --> 01:18:09,724
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're going to lose on it.

1268
01:18:11,229 --> 01:18:13,212
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't exist without Nintendo though.

1269
01:18:13,352 --> 01:18:15,135
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Nintendo's the one that brought it back.

1270
01:18:15,155 --> 01:18:17,798
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time, Sega has taken a lot of risks on the Wii.

1271
01:18:17,838 --> 01:18:23,266
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, look, they put out Mad World and stuff, and Mad World's a pretty awesome game, but it's also an awesome game that didn't sell very well.

1272
01:18:23,686 --> 01:18:27,191
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, The Conduit was another Sega game that they put out.

1273
01:18:27,231 --> 01:18:27,832
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that was Sega.

1274
01:18:29,072 --> 01:18:30,053
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that was Sega.

1275
01:18:30,373 --> 01:18:31,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe, I don't know.

1276
01:18:31,733 --> 01:18:34,674
[SPEAKER_08]: But once again, another game that didn't sell well at all.

1277
01:18:35,414 --> 01:18:39,755
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to clarify, I don't think Sega's involved in Bayonetta 2, right?

1278
01:18:39,775 --> 01:18:40,536
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not publishing it.

1279
01:18:40,676 --> 01:18:41,636
[SPEAKER_05]: But they own the IP.

1280
01:18:41,696 --> 01:18:44,537
[SPEAKER_05]: They are part of the licensing for the game to exist.

1281
01:18:44,657 --> 01:18:46,197
[SPEAKER_05]: But Nintendo's bankrolling it.

1282
01:18:46,277 --> 01:18:52,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Platinum's been very open about the fact that without Nintendo's involvement, this game just wouldn't exist.

1283
01:18:55,220 --> 01:18:57,001
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go, Bayonetta and Smash Brothers.

1284
01:18:58,402 --> 01:18:59,222
[SPEAKER_01]: It's enough for me.

1285
01:19:00,603 --> 01:19:02,584
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?

1286
01:19:02,644 --> 01:19:09,227
[SPEAKER_01]: As much as I love Bayonetta, it's not enough for me to go out and get a Wii U because honestly, the Wii U just does not bring that much new to the table.

1287
01:19:09,347 --> 01:19:11,208
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, we have a tablet, yay.

1288
01:19:11,888 --> 01:19:18,031
[SPEAKER_01]: But if they put out Bayonetta 2 on multi-systems, hell yeah, I would buy it.

1289
01:19:18,992 --> 01:19:21,993
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying, there's a lot of people who would have been into it.

1290
01:19:23,979 --> 01:19:25,580
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's going to be a repeat of the 3DS.

1291
01:19:26,020 --> 01:19:27,541
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's going to be fine come holidays.

1292
01:19:28,181 --> 01:19:31,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I'll be wrong, but I think it's going to be just fine during the holidays.

1293
01:19:35,005 --> 01:19:35,525
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope so.

1294
01:19:35,845 --> 01:19:42,149
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I don't want to see them fail, but at the same time, it's been a console that there's no reason for me to buy that system.

1295
01:19:42,209 --> 01:19:43,830
[SPEAKER_08]: There's nothing that really wowed me about it.

1296
01:19:44,170 --> 01:19:46,671
[SPEAKER_08]: The 3DS is like, oh, hey, 3D games without glasses.

1297
01:19:46,691 --> 01:19:47,432
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of cool.

1298
01:19:48,052 --> 01:19:51,074
[SPEAKER_08]: Playing on the second screen, I don't really give a shit about that.

1299
01:19:51,454 --> 01:19:53,215
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not that big a deal.

1300
01:19:53,655 --> 01:19:59,663
[SPEAKER_01]: The one game I was excited about apparently sucks, so tank, tank, tank.

1301
01:20:00,063 --> 01:20:05,190
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been playing on two screens for how long now with the DS, so that's not really a new thing.

1302
01:20:05,555 --> 01:20:16,620
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the big difference between the 3DS and the Wii U in terms of positioning is that the 3DS sort of owns handheld right now, at least in the US.

1303
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:18,601
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's the PSP, but that's it.

1304
01:20:18,741 --> 01:20:21,182
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the PSP and the Vita.

1305
01:20:21,362 --> 01:20:22,603
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, the Vita.

1306
01:20:23,684 --> 01:20:24,324
[SPEAKER_00]: But who owns a Vita?

1307
01:20:25,225 --> 01:20:42,746
[SPEAKER_00]: and the 3DS but the Wii U is coming online a year before a very crowded console market is launching a brand new generation of consoles and it doesn't seem to be in the same league hardware wise as the others which is going to make multi-platform development difficult but neither was the Wii

1308
01:20:43,146 --> 01:20:51,190
[SPEAKER_08]: And also when you consider though that they're saying that now a lot of that's, you know, the market's kind of going to the handhelds and phones and tablets and that kind of thing.

1309
01:20:51,210 --> 01:20:55,993
[SPEAKER_08]: And so if you own the handheld market, who gives a crap if your console's not really doing that well?

1310
01:20:56,033 --> 01:20:59,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Because those people probably have a 3DS and they're fine.

1311
01:21:00,075 --> 01:21:02,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Or, you know, they can buy a 3DS.

1312
01:21:03,437 --> 01:21:06,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, in the interest of time, and I feel like we've had this conversation before, let's move on with the stories.

1313
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:10,301
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so let's see.

1314
01:21:10,421 --> 01:21:18,064
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's talk a little bit about where we used to... As we've said, it hasn't been doing that well.

1315
01:21:18,164 --> 01:21:29,008
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, they have missed their target, which was just about 3.5 million units, and they missed it by 500,000, if I remember correctly.

1316
01:21:30,970 --> 01:21:43,264
[SPEAKER_08]: um they are targeting though for the next fiscal year nine million units so they're really gonna have to pick up the pace if that's gonna happen um i want to say that they've only sold um

1317
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:48,141
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was like 390,000 units just over the last few months.

1318
01:21:50,202 --> 01:21:54,244
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the first three months were 390,000 units, if I remember correctly.

1319
01:21:56,645 --> 01:21:58,746
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, 3DS is rocking.

1320
01:21:58,907 --> 01:22:02,068
[SPEAKER_08]: They're up to 31.09 million units.

1321
01:22:03,949 --> 01:22:08,431
[SPEAKER_08]: And the Wii's still getting close to 100 million, 99.84 million.

1322
01:22:08,451 --> 01:22:09,271
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a lot of systems.

1323
01:22:13,133 --> 01:22:41,199
[SPEAKER_08]: that's gotta disappoint them that they've only been able to sell 3. almost 3.5 million when there's 99 million Wii owners out there that's no penetration and on top of that Satoru Iwata he is now the CEO the Nintendo of America CEO and just to be clear Reggie Fils-AimÃ© was not overthrown or anything like that he's still there yeah yeah

1324
01:22:43,047 --> 01:22:47,990
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm assuming this is more to kind of try to bring the two together so that the two don't operate in different silos.

1325
01:22:48,070 --> 01:22:50,571
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my thought as a corporate move like this.

1326
01:22:51,571 --> 01:22:53,652
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Wanda's been definitely more up front.

1327
01:22:54,033 --> 01:22:58,175
[SPEAKER_08]: He's been kind of the figure in all those Nintendo Directs and stuff.

1328
01:23:00,143 --> 01:23:00,583
[SPEAKER_01]: and DarkSakura.com.

1329
01:23:28,803 --> 01:23:58,031
[SPEAKER_06]: so you could infer that Mario 3D and Mario Kart Wii U these are not titles to be shown for 2014 these are titles to be shown for the holiday release running down the list real quick just so we're clear these are games that Nintendo says in the next few months Mario Kart for Wii U Super Mario Brothers for Wii U Wii Fit for Wii U which has kind of fallen off the radar but that's kind of one of those games they were pitching that in the beginning and it disappeared so it's kind of another one of those games that you know oh now you see it now you don't but Wii Fit could be interesting depending on what they do with it

1330
01:23:58,331 --> 01:23:59,932
[SPEAKER_06]: That could be an interesting game changer.

1331
01:24:00,753 --> 01:24:01,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Pikmin.

1332
01:24:01,513 --> 01:24:02,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is August.

1333
01:24:02,353 --> 01:24:03,434
[SPEAKER_06]: Which we knew that's happening.

1334
01:24:04,014 --> 01:24:06,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Legend of Zelda, Wii U and Nintendo 3DS.

1335
01:24:07,016 --> 01:24:08,137
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm assuming that's Wind Waker.

1336
01:24:08,157 --> 01:24:10,998
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Wind Waker and the new... Link to the Past.

1337
01:24:11,018 --> 01:24:11,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Link to the Past.

1338
01:24:12,059 --> 01:24:15,621
[SPEAKER_06]: And Mario and Luigi on the 3DS and Pokemon X and Y, obviously.

1339
01:24:15,741 --> 01:24:15,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1340
01:24:16,341 --> 01:24:20,424
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's... You're pretty much looking at Nintendo's holiday lineup right there.

1341
01:24:20,644 --> 01:24:25,567
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there might be one or two other surprises here, but that's, you know... That's in a nutshell.

1342
01:24:25,587 --> 01:24:27,388
[SPEAKER_08]: That better not be another new Super Mario Bros.

1343
01:24:27,408 --> 01:24:27,588
[SPEAKER_08]: game.

1344
01:24:29,179 --> 01:24:33,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh no, I think it's going to be like you were saying a minute ago, kind of like a Galaxy type thing.

1345
01:24:34,165 --> 01:24:44,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they had said that they intended last year to stick to doing the sort of one new title per generation and just expanding those with DLC like we're seeing with the Luigi DLC.

1346
01:24:46,239 --> 01:24:48,122
[SPEAKER_08]: I just hope it's not another new Super Mario Bros.

1347
01:24:48,162 --> 01:24:48,342
[SPEAKER_08]: game.

1348
01:24:50,126 --> 01:24:52,328
[SPEAKER_08]: or anything that resembles that.

1349
01:24:52,548 --> 01:25:03,635
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the Luigi DLC should tell you it's not another Super Mario X game because why would they waste all the effort to do that to just turn around literally four months later and say, and now it's a new game.

1350
01:25:03,735 --> 01:25:06,937
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see that happening.

1351
01:25:07,058 --> 01:25:14,002
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be a 3D Mario, whether it's Universe, whether it's Mario 64-esque or Sunshine for fuck's sake.

1352
01:25:14,863 --> 01:25:15,844
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be something of that vein.

1353
01:25:17,024 --> 01:25:17,965
[SPEAKER_01]: Sunshine Lowell.

1354
01:25:20,026 --> 01:25:21,047
[SPEAKER_08]: I could see them doing it, though.

1355
01:25:21,307 --> 01:25:24,709
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, just... Why not a new Luigi game, then?

1356
01:25:24,929 --> 01:25:30,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we can do DLC and just easily shoehorn it into the... Maybe that's why they keep hyping this Luigi.

1357
01:25:30,573 --> 01:25:33,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe the new game is Super Luigi Galaxy or something.

1358
01:25:33,195 --> 01:25:33,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe that's the twist.

1359
01:25:34,035 --> 01:25:35,176
[SPEAKER_06]: And no one will buy it.

1360
01:25:35,296 --> 01:25:36,316
[SPEAKER_06]: No one will buy it.

1361
01:25:36,497 --> 01:25:39,799
[SPEAKER_06]: This whole thing has let... What do you mean no one will buy Super Luigi Galaxy?

1362
01:25:39,819 --> 01:25:40,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1363
01:25:40,539 --> 01:25:42,220
[SPEAKER_06]: One person will buy it, but no one else will buy it.

1364
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:43,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you smoking crank?

1365
01:25:43,962 --> 01:25:48,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Mario Galaxy was like one of the best games they put out on the Wii, period.

1366
01:25:48,885 --> 01:25:52,788
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not talking about just reskin with Luigi.

1367
01:25:52,848 --> 01:26:00,413
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm talking about a new game in that universe and everything, but Luigi happens to be the star because it's the year of Luigi.

1368
01:26:00,713 --> 01:26:01,434
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the joke.

1369
01:26:02,574 --> 01:26:06,076
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why you haven't seen anything else because the bombshell is going to get dropped at E3.

1370
01:26:06,216 --> 01:26:08,357
[SPEAKER_08]: No one should make jokes when your system is suffering like that.

1371
01:26:09,238 --> 01:26:10,318
[SPEAKER_08]: This is not time for joking.

1372
01:26:10,339 --> 01:26:15,321
[SPEAKER_08]: This is time for kicking ass.

1373
01:26:15,562 --> 01:26:16,002
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm done.

1374
01:26:16,202 --> 01:26:16,922
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, save me.

1375
01:26:17,303 --> 01:26:18,243
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you spent, Rob?

1376
01:26:18,323 --> 01:26:18,883
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm spent.

1377
01:26:19,224 --> 01:26:21,045
[SPEAKER_01]: I found a contest that I'm going to be in now.

1378
01:26:22,305 --> 01:26:22,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh?

1379
01:26:22,686 --> 01:26:24,267
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you found it for me, but I'm going to do it.

1380
01:26:26,428 --> 01:26:27,989
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Rob does all my hard work for me.

1381
01:26:28,009 --> 01:26:29,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, then as your agent, I want 20%.

1382
01:26:31,298 --> 01:26:33,880
[SPEAKER_01]: As my agent, I'll just keep buying you coffee.

1383
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:34,520
[SPEAKER_06]: That works.

1384
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:43,966
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of which, so Sega has a thing now where they're wanting people to design a new character to be the face of the company.

1385
01:26:44,926 --> 01:26:46,407
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, not Sonic, just...

1386
01:26:46,927 --> 01:27:06,834
[SPEAKER_01]: A new mascot And the contest is open through June 9th this year And it has to be an original character And there's a link on I can get the link later But it's also not just limited to the Japanese audience It's worldwide

1387
01:27:07,546 --> 01:27:18,912
[SPEAKER_01]: which I'm gonna get the hell out of this so basically they're gonna be doing a new live web series called Sega Raw on Nico Nico

1388
01:27:19,614 --> 01:27:21,275
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's what the mascot's for.

1389
01:27:21,335 --> 01:27:22,195
[SPEAKER_01]: It's for the show.

1390
01:27:22,855 --> 01:27:25,577
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not giving you guys my ideas.

1391
01:27:26,737 --> 01:27:27,677
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

1392
01:27:28,378 --> 01:27:37,461
[SPEAKER_01]: But they want something unique, something fun, something that's going to basically fit what they're trying to do.

1393
01:27:37,501 --> 01:27:38,142
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the show...

1394
01:27:39,643 --> 01:27:59,416
[SPEAKER_01]: is uh i'm trying to find something and basically it's yeah just going to be um more of a fan show and there's translations for the rules up so uh you just need a Nico Nico account and there is an english version um on the website to sign up for that and so i will uh let me get the url if you go to uh

1395
01:28:00,973 --> 01:28:08,477
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually seiga.nicovideo.jp There should be a link from there.

1396
01:28:08,577 --> 01:28:10,739
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will post the link in the chat room for people here.

1397
01:28:11,499 --> 01:28:13,801
[SPEAKER_01]: Because maybe Sega will hire me.

1398
01:28:14,821 --> 01:28:16,422
[SPEAKER_08]: Got a great idea for a Sega character.

1399
01:28:16,542 --> 01:28:19,724
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like Sonic the Hedgehog, but he's black and he's got guns.

1400
01:28:19,904 --> 01:28:21,125
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, shut up.

1401
01:28:21,721 --> 01:28:31,533
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I wouldn't give out too many of these ideas because coming up in part B of Orange Lawns Radio tonight, we are going to do a list list.

1402
01:28:32,134 --> 01:28:33,816
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't participate, Rob.

1403
01:28:33,936 --> 01:28:34,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

1404
01:28:34,336 --> 01:28:35,999
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm not giving anybody my ideas.

1405
01:28:36,179 --> 01:28:36,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Tough shit.

1406
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:38,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and he's going to be named Shadow.

1407
01:28:39,642 --> 01:28:40,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Shadow of the Hedgehog.

1408
01:28:40,563 --> 01:28:41,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the deal.

1409
01:28:41,423 --> 01:28:49,248
[SPEAKER_06]: The topic for tonight's list is mascot we most want to gift to Sega on behalf of OLR.

1410
01:28:49,628 --> 01:28:52,170
[SPEAKER_06]: So mascot we most want to gift to Sega on behalf of OLR.

1411
01:28:52,230 --> 01:28:53,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't send your answers yet.

1412
01:28:53,150 --> 01:28:53,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Just think about it.

1413
01:28:53,810 --> 01:28:56,452
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll come back to this in part B. By the way, a little bit more to this.

1414
01:28:57,393 --> 01:29:01,555
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to find those translated rules, look for Yakuza fan at NeoGAF.

1415
01:29:05,461 --> 01:29:07,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

1416
01:29:07,763 --> 01:29:08,403
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we gotta?

1417
01:29:09,564 --> 01:29:09,944
[SPEAKER_06]: We gotta.

1418
01:29:11,145 --> 01:29:17,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this week, there's Deadly Permission, The Director's Cut on PlayStation 3, and Soul Sacrifice on the Vita.

1419
01:29:18,690 --> 01:29:26,856
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, on PC, Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Network, Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon.

1420
01:29:27,416 --> 01:29:28,697
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really the only game you need to buy.

1421
01:29:33,291 --> 01:29:33,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Game ga arimasen

1422
01:30:02,555 --> 01:30:05,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Trying to look quickly at Vita or the handhelds?

1423
01:30:05,380 --> 01:30:07,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it just a dry spell this week?

1424
01:30:07,784 --> 01:30:08,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Wii U?

1425
01:30:09,126 --> 01:30:09,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Question mark?

1426
01:30:12,145 --> 01:30:14,527
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm showing it's a dry spell in Japan this week.

1427
01:30:14,928 --> 01:30:15,448
[SPEAKER_06]: You know why?

1428
01:30:15,748 --> 01:30:15,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

1429
01:30:16,449 --> 01:30:17,250
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because they're afraid.

1430
01:30:17,270 --> 01:30:18,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Know what they're afraid of?

1431
01:30:18,911 --> 01:30:22,875
[SPEAKER_08]: Three brand new fucking trailers for Grand Theft Auto V on the 30th.

1432
01:30:23,115 --> 01:30:23,556
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

1433
01:30:23,816 --> 01:30:25,197
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all you need to do that day.

1434
01:30:25,457 --> 01:30:32,644
[SPEAKER_08]: It's my wedding anniversary and I'm going out and eating lunch, but I'm coming back and I'm fucking watching those trailers over and over and over again.

1435
01:30:32,987 --> 01:30:35,128
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we get you a shirt that said game over?

1436
01:30:35,308 --> 01:30:37,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you going to make Nellie watch them with you?

1437
01:30:38,230 --> 01:30:38,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Should I?

1438
01:30:38,790 --> 01:30:39,030
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1439
01:30:39,070 --> 01:30:39,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Does she get into it?

1440
01:30:40,091 --> 01:30:40,291
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1441
01:30:40,571 --> 01:30:40,751
[SPEAKER_08]: No?

1442
01:30:41,112 --> 01:30:42,112
[SPEAKER_08]: She could care less.

1443
01:30:42,152 --> 01:30:43,613
[SPEAKER_08]: I would think she'd think it's hilarious.

1444
01:30:43,633 --> 01:30:49,316
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to pick the most violent, bloody, gory game ever and have Nellie and your mom review it.

1445
01:30:50,777 --> 01:30:53,719
[SPEAKER_08]: My wife wouldn't like it, not because it's bloody, but because it's a game.

1446
01:30:54,673 --> 01:30:55,894
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be the best review ever.

1447
01:31:18,877 --> 01:31:21,238
[SPEAKER_06]: I found a game coming out on May 9th.

1448
01:31:21,578 --> 01:31:22,719
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the closest game release.

1449
01:31:22,799 --> 01:31:23,579
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like two weeks.

1450
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:25,160
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on the PSP.

1451
01:31:26,321 --> 01:31:30,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Cud Wafter Converted Edition comes out on the PSP.

1452
01:31:31,143 --> 01:31:35,166
[SPEAKER_06]: And the box art is just a girl and she's sitting at the table with her elbows on the table.

1453
01:31:35,446 --> 01:31:36,206
[SPEAKER_06]: She's just waiting.

1454
01:31:36,886 --> 01:31:38,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the rest of us for Japanese release dates.

1455
01:31:38,988 --> 01:31:43,350
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like 90% of all PSP games in Japan.

1456
01:31:43,630 --> 01:31:45,251
[SPEAKER_06]: A chick with her arms folded waiting.

1457
01:31:45,271 --> 01:31:45,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1458
01:31:46,369 --> 01:31:47,489
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you say the name of that again?

1459
01:31:48,650 --> 01:31:54,411
[SPEAKER_06]: K-U-D-W-A-F-T-E-R To me it's Kudwafter, but it's probably Kud... Wafter.

1460
01:31:54,571 --> 01:31:55,292
[SPEAKER_01]: It's German.

1461
01:31:56,152 --> 01:31:57,912
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that almost sounded dirty.

1462
01:31:58,953 --> 01:32:00,413
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything in German sounds dirty.

1463
01:32:00,713 --> 01:32:02,534
[SPEAKER_01]: You can say strudel and it sounds dirty.

1464
01:32:03,014 --> 01:32:03,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Kudwafer.

1465
01:32:03,874 --> 01:32:07,555
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about, you know, crackers that cows chew on.

1466
01:32:07,835 --> 01:32:11,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Then let's go to the Old Kingdom and see what's coming out over there.

1467
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:14,322
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to go find out personally, but unfortunately I'm poor.

1468
01:32:14,962 --> 01:32:17,084
[SPEAKER_01]: So, God, I'm not even ready, Rob.

1469
01:32:17,244 --> 01:32:17,824
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up with me?

1470
01:32:19,145 --> 01:32:20,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Amy, I thought you didn't come to the show prepared.

1471
01:32:20,686 --> 01:32:21,027
[SPEAKER_01]: Girl!

1472
01:32:22,568 --> 01:32:22,888
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.

1473
01:32:22,988 --> 01:32:24,629
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no wonder, because you linked me the wrong month.

1474
01:32:26,531 --> 01:32:27,311
[SPEAKER_06]: They're your links!

1475
01:32:27,852 --> 01:32:28,532
[SPEAKER_01]: I blame you!

1476
01:32:28,712 --> 01:32:29,473
[SPEAKER_01]: I blame you for everything.

1477
01:32:32,461 --> 01:32:34,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Slagkick looked up what this is.

1478
01:32:36,105 --> 01:32:37,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Kudwafter or whatever.

1479
01:32:37,467 --> 01:32:43,734
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a Japanese adult visual novel developed by Key, released on June 25th, 2010 for Windows PC.

1480
01:32:43,814 --> 01:32:45,115
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess it's the PSP version.

1481
01:32:45,195 --> 01:32:47,378
[SPEAKER_05]: And the cover sounded like one.

1482
01:32:48,059 --> 01:32:48,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

1483
01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:51,322
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, when I first looked at that, I was like, oh, she gonna get naked.

1484
01:32:53,392 --> 01:32:54,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's a moe game.

1485
01:32:54,193 --> 01:32:56,155
[SPEAKER_08]: She looks too young.

1486
01:32:56,175 --> 01:32:59,398
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that button on her head is, like, huge.

1487
01:32:59,638 --> 01:33:02,200
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just thinking, does she smell like Kudzu?

1488
01:33:02,380 --> 01:33:02,581
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

1489
01:33:03,341 --> 01:33:09,507
[SPEAKER_06]: And FifthDream in our chatroom says, cunt waiter, I've had a few of those.

1490
01:33:13,002 --> 01:33:16,166
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked for one of the... I'm just gonna... You win.

1491
01:33:16,527 --> 01:33:17,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, moving on.

1492
01:33:17,768 --> 01:33:21,032
[SPEAKER_01]: On May 1st, we have Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon.

1493
01:33:21,733 --> 01:33:22,895
[SPEAKER_01]: I was still thinking about getting it.

1494
01:33:22,975 --> 01:33:24,256
[SPEAKER_01]: Injustice Gods Among Us.

1495
01:33:24,437 --> 01:33:25,278
[SPEAKER_01]: Game is fucking weird.

1496
01:33:25,878 --> 01:33:29,002
[SPEAKER_01]: Soul Sacrifice on Vita and Fez on PC.

1497
01:33:29,803 --> 01:33:30,945
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm thinking of the Doctor.

1498
01:33:32,441 --> 01:33:32,962
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1499
01:33:48,417 --> 01:33:51,058
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're going to hate an entire fucking game because the hair was wrong?

1500
01:33:51,078 --> 01:33:51,438
[SPEAKER_08]: You know.

1501
01:33:51,638 --> 01:33:52,438
[SPEAKER_01]: It's DC.

1502
01:33:52,518 --> 01:33:53,458
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate everything.

1503
01:33:53,858 --> 01:33:58,579
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, Jamie, there is DLC that could probably fix that.

1504
01:33:58,639 --> 01:34:00,380
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I'm sure she's got numerous outfits.

1505
01:34:00,420 --> 01:34:02,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they could, you know, DLC to make her Jean Grey?

1506
01:34:02,700 --> 01:34:02,740
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

1507
01:34:04,281 --> 01:34:05,281
[SPEAKER_01]: Then she would be awesome?

1508
01:34:05,981 --> 01:34:08,022
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I will stop and say this.

1509
01:34:08,682 --> 01:34:14,123
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Wonder Woman and I like Batman, although I cannot read anything Batman-related that Gail Simone doesn't write.

1510
01:34:15,450 --> 01:34:16,111
[SPEAKER_01]: She is my hero.

1511
01:34:16,471 --> 01:34:20,315
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did read Blackest Night with the whole Star Sapphire thing and that was pretty hot.

1512
01:34:21,557 --> 01:34:21,777
[SPEAKER_01]: There.

1513
01:34:22,178 --> 01:34:23,539
[SPEAKER_01]: My one nod to DC.

1514
01:34:28,625 --> 01:34:28,905
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

1515
01:34:29,955 --> 01:34:33,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, so, movies.

1516
01:34:33,897 --> 01:34:35,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Sony likes movies, right?

1517
01:34:35,478 --> 01:34:40,541
[SPEAKER_08]: So Sony said, hey, why don't we take some of our franchises and make them into movies?

1518
01:34:40,821 --> 01:34:42,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Sound like a fantastic idea?

1519
01:34:42,682 --> 01:34:43,583
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it is.

1520
01:34:44,503 --> 01:34:44,984
[SPEAKER_08]: According to them.

1521
01:34:45,924 --> 01:35:10,027
[SPEAKER_08]: Ratchet and Clank coming to theaters in 2015 and it's actually being done by animation company Rainmaker Entertainment and I guess the digital media studio Blockade Entertainment and I guess they produced CG was a flick Escape from Planet Earth I have no idea what the fuck that is but they made that movie so they've made a movie before

1522
01:35:11,903 --> 01:35:35,822
[SPEAKER_08]: uh and then Heavenly Sword is going to be coming to becoming a movie as well except it's direct-to-video because you know obviously a game this important that never had a sequel cannot be going in the theaters because no one would know what the fuck it is and so direct-to-video it goes also being done by Blockade Entertainment what are you laughing at over there?

1523
01:35:35,842 --> 01:35:36,683
[SPEAKER_01]: stop it

1524
01:35:40,063 --> 01:35:41,963
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like Pee Wee Herman's secret word.

1525
01:35:43,924 --> 01:35:45,784
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's word is Kudwafter.

1526
01:35:49,745 --> 01:35:50,305
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, boy.

1527
01:35:50,325 --> 01:35:51,265
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1528
01:35:51,305 --> 01:35:52,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Heavenly Sword?

1529
01:35:52,786 --> 01:35:59,087
[SPEAKER_08]: It just... I guess because God of War would have been too good?

1530
01:35:59,107 --> 01:36:01,168
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really know why.

1531
01:36:01,828 --> 01:36:05,048
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I would rather see a Kudwafter movie than Heavenly Sword, though.

1532
01:36:05,068 --> 01:36:07,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, a Heavenly Sword movie sounds like something that, you know...

1533
01:36:09,497 --> 01:36:10,438
[SPEAKER_08]: Uwe Boll would do.

1534
01:36:10,818 --> 01:36:14,100
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, because... He says, I don't know if he's made any movies lately.

1535
01:36:17,242 --> 01:36:19,623
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I think he's been laughed out of Hollywood completely.

1536
01:36:20,323 --> 01:36:22,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, he's laughing all the way to the bank.

1537
01:36:22,565 --> 01:36:24,766
[SPEAKER_08]: Because he's banked a lot of money.

1538
01:36:26,967 --> 01:36:28,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Ratchet and Clank sounds like it could be cute, though.

1539
01:36:28,848 --> 01:36:30,349
[SPEAKER_06]: That, I think, could work.

1540
01:36:30,389 --> 01:36:31,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Anime is the way to go, yeah.

1541
01:36:32,310 --> 01:36:35,132
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, after all, Angry Birds are getting a movie.

1542
01:36:35,272 --> 01:36:35,432
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

1543
01:36:37,709 --> 01:36:37,929
[SPEAKER_08]: How?

1544
01:36:38,530 --> 01:36:39,572
[SPEAKER_08]: They have cartoons.

1545
01:36:39,932 --> 01:36:43,037
[SPEAKER_01]: They commit suicide by launching themselves at pigs.

1546
01:36:44,639 --> 01:36:45,921
[SPEAKER_08]: But they'll do well in the Middle East.

1547
01:36:47,803 --> 01:36:49,024
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm done, bye

1548
01:37:12,944 --> 01:37:31,723
[SPEAKER_06]: But here's the thing, under their new system, you will have to pay to have your scores reviewed Which, you know, it does make sense though, because legitimately they're looking through all the footage And they're watching it, and that takes hours at a time That just means Billy Mitchell's gonna pay extra Review mine first, and eat my barbecue sauce

1549
01:37:31,943 --> 01:37:33,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Perhaps.

1550
01:37:33,926 --> 01:37:38,532
[SPEAKER_06]: $25 for one submission, $60 for three submissions, $75 for five submissions.

1551
01:37:38,873 --> 01:37:42,378
[SPEAKER_06]: But I believe based on the length, that might count as more than one submission.

1552
01:37:42,618 --> 01:37:43,940
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what she said.

1553
01:37:44,701 --> 01:37:46,223
[SPEAKER_01]: What'd you say over there?

1554
01:37:46,804 --> 01:37:47,565
[SPEAKER_01]: That bears repeating.

1555
01:37:48,305 --> 01:37:49,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Say it into a mic or don't say it at all.

1556
01:37:50,107 --> 01:37:51,128
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what she said.

1557
01:37:51,288 --> 01:37:51,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

1558
01:37:53,490 --> 01:37:58,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, each video can only do one game, although you can do more than one score in the video.

1559
01:37:58,494 --> 01:37:59,515
[SPEAKER_06]: That makes no sense to me.

1560
01:37:59,815 --> 01:38:01,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless it was two different settings, maybe.

1561
01:38:02,077 --> 01:38:05,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Because why would you show one score and then a better score?

1562
01:38:05,740 --> 01:38:06,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Just do the one score.

1563
01:38:07,701 --> 01:38:08,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

1564
01:38:09,403 --> 01:38:09,863
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go.

1565
01:38:11,024 --> 01:38:11,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Twin Galaxies.

1566
01:38:11,865 --> 01:38:13,766
[SPEAKER_06]: You can submit your score for $25.

1567
01:38:16,028 --> 01:38:16,388
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1568
01:38:16,689 --> 01:38:24,274
[SPEAKER_08]: There's been some stuff going around saying that because now they're under new ownership that it's not quite as respectable anymore.

1569
01:38:27,636 --> 01:38:28,837
[SPEAKER_06]: That happens with any company.

1570
01:38:28,857 --> 01:38:33,661
[SPEAKER_08]: And also apparently, I don't know if their database crashed or something, but they lost some of the scores.

1571
01:38:34,281 --> 01:38:37,443
[SPEAKER_06]: It did, but I'm glad you brought that up because they did comment on it.

1572
01:38:38,384 --> 01:38:42,367
[SPEAKER_06]: They said the old database was damaged but not completely irretrievable.

1573
01:38:43,988 --> 01:38:45,349
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess they got some of it back.

1574
01:38:50,616 --> 01:39:10,396
[SPEAKER_06]: but I'm glad that still exists because there's still lots of fans of the very classic arcade games out there and they're still playing them people are still breaking Donkey Kong score records so I'm glad something like this exists alright well speaking of classic games every week here on Orange Lounge Radio we like to take a trip down memory lane and visit the classic game of the week

1575
01:39:12,714 --> 01:39:25,717
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the part of the show where DarkSakura is going to jump into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, record this for two hours and then pay me 25 bucks for telling you how awesome it was.

1576
01:39:26,438 --> 01:39:27,938
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, what's the classic game of the week?

1577
01:39:29,538 --> 01:39:31,199
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, no, I can't even do it, Rob.

1578
01:39:31,259 --> 01:39:33,660
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't do it because you have to start the music.

1579
01:39:34,360 --> 01:39:34,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Fair enough.

1580
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:37,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the music for the classic game of the week.

1581
01:39:37,220 --> 01:39:39,081
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm going to shoot myself in the head.

1582
01:39:44,184 --> 01:39:45,986
[SPEAKER_06]: How has this never been the classic game of the week?

1583
01:39:46,026 --> 01:39:46,927
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no fucking clue.

1584
01:39:46,947 --> 01:39:48,028
[SPEAKER_06]: This has been a joke forever on OLR.

1585
01:39:48,048 --> 01:39:48,508
[SPEAKER_06]: I love this song.

1586
01:39:48,568 --> 01:39:49,249
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no fucking clue.

1587
01:39:49,269 --> 01:39:52,372
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I was gonna put in Ridge Racer, and I was like, have I done Ridge Racer?

1588
01:39:52,392 --> 01:39:54,194
[SPEAKER_01]: Have I done... Oh my god, I haven't done Daytona.

1589
01:39:54,474 --> 01:40:00,180
[SPEAKER_01]: And Dan has been playing the shit out of Daytona, so I hear do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do in my nightmares.

1590
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:02,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, you mean you hear this?

1591
01:40:05,205 --> 01:40:05,545
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

1592
01:40:05,645 --> 01:40:08,167
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a napkin and I can make it into at least 11.

1593
01:40:09,048 --> 01:40:16,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody out there on the internet, if they haven't done it already, needs to do like a dubstep remix of this song because that would be the most hilarious thing ever.

1594
01:40:16,594 --> 01:40:23,479
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a video of the guy who sang for AM2 singing the song live and he just looks like he is having the time of his life.

1595
01:40:23,979 --> 01:40:27,342
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's better than chocolate and...

1596
01:40:29,508 --> 01:40:30,609
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting Laid, I guess.

1597
01:40:31,370 --> 01:40:32,671
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was pretty funny.

1598
01:40:32,931 --> 01:40:34,272
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, okay, so Daytona USA.

1599
01:40:34,492 --> 01:40:38,575
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, the other song I put in was the classic Rolling Start.

1600
01:40:38,635 --> 01:40:39,536
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me play a little bit of that.

1601
01:40:39,596 --> 01:40:43,879
[SPEAKER_06]: We can hear this, or as I call it, Roaring Star.

1602
01:40:47,422 --> 01:40:47,962
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, no, no.

1603
01:40:48,563 --> 01:40:51,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I have to tell where all of my hate for this game comes from.

1604
01:40:51,665 --> 01:40:53,026
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not because it's a bad game.

1605
01:40:53,066 --> 01:40:56,349
[SPEAKER_01]: If it was a bad game, it would not be on my classic game of the week list.

1606
01:40:57,050 --> 01:40:58,230
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked for an Amco arcade.

1607
01:40:59,111 --> 01:41:04,076
[SPEAKER_01]: We had Time Crisis, we had Ridge Racer, we had Tekken 3 before everybody else did.

1608
01:41:04,716 --> 01:41:09,981
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a Pac-Man hat, I had a Polar camera that I got from all the leftover tickets that the kids would leave in the machine.

1609
01:41:10,742 --> 01:41:14,365
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had like 10 Tekken 3 shirts, like the arcade only ones.

1610
01:41:14,865 --> 01:41:18,609
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved working there, except for this one machine right across from the ticket counter.

1611
01:41:19,229 --> 01:41:21,371
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would always be in loud attract mode.

1612
01:41:21,770 --> 01:41:23,972
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that was an awful one.

1613
01:41:45,549 --> 01:41:48,373
[SPEAKER_01]: The voice acting was hideous.

1614
01:41:48,754 --> 01:41:49,254
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god.

1615
01:41:49,795 --> 01:41:51,838
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, back to the game.

1616
01:41:52,439 --> 01:41:53,260
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a racing game.

1617
01:41:53,320 --> 01:41:56,604
[SPEAKER_01]: It was developed by Sega AM2, which we love AM2.

1618
01:41:57,867 --> 01:42:00,248
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, AM2 gave us freaking Burning Rangers.

1619
01:42:00,888 --> 01:42:02,269
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, same guy singing by the way.

1620
01:42:03,629 --> 01:42:08,851
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it came out as a limited release in 1993 and a full release in 1994.

1621
01:42:09,571 --> 01:42:13,192
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is one of the highest grossing arcade machines of all time.

1622
01:42:14,013 --> 01:42:17,174
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the first title that came out on the Model 2 arcade board.

1623
01:42:17,634 --> 01:42:19,475
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is easily emulated now.

1624
01:42:20,515 --> 01:42:25,436
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was pretty much the best racing machine that came out at the time.

1625
01:42:25,916 --> 01:42:33,138
[SPEAKER_01]: It was lower poly than Virtua Racing, but it was fully texture mapped so it gave it more of a realistic feel.

1626
01:42:33,579 --> 01:42:37,400
[SPEAKER_01]: Except it had serious draw-in problems like, oh, I'm driving on clouds.

1627
01:42:37,540 --> 01:42:38,260
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, look, there's a mountain.

1628
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:40,181
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, look, there's Sonic's face.

1629
01:42:40,961 --> 01:42:41,241
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?

1630
01:42:42,082 --> 01:42:52,526
[SPEAKER_01]: But they did re-release the game as... Oh, one thing I actually have to say, it's actually one of the few 3D games at the time that maintained a steady 60 frames per second frame rate.

1631
01:42:52,987 --> 01:42:57,429
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty crazy, given that I can't get that on some games most of the time.

1632
01:42:58,890 --> 01:43:03,473
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was re-released in 2010 as Sega Racing Classic, but I don't know if anyone has played it.

1633
01:43:04,033 --> 01:43:05,855
[SPEAKER_01]: They took out the vocals.

1634
01:43:06,675 --> 01:43:10,878
[SPEAKER_01]: It just has some sort of generic singing over it, like it was some background vocal.

1635
01:43:11,358 --> 01:43:14,401
[SPEAKER_01]: But the main lyric part of it, it's like you're playing karaoke mode.

1636
01:43:14,921 --> 01:43:15,942
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just not the same.

1637
01:43:16,602 --> 01:43:26,029
[SPEAKER_01]: So you are in a stock car called the Hornet, and you have to race three tracks, either automatic or manual.

1638
01:43:26,129 --> 01:43:27,250
[SPEAKER_01]: Choose your transmission.

1639
01:43:28,010 --> 01:43:32,952
[SPEAKER_01]: and, uh, it, uh, you know, you had different ways the camera could look.

1640
01:43:32,972 --> 01:43:35,032
[SPEAKER_01]: You could look, um, behind the driver's seat.

1641
01:43:35,052 --> 01:43:39,694
[SPEAKER_01]: You could be, uh, you know, uh, a very first person.

1642
01:43:40,014 --> 01:43:48,257
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were deluxe cabins because, um, I played Daytona USA, um, the first time I played this game was in Las Vegas.

1643
01:43:48,857 --> 01:43:51,498
[SPEAKER_01]: This is when I was still living in Alabama and my mom lived in Phoenix.

1644
01:43:52,118 --> 01:43:57,681
[SPEAKER_01]: We flew to Phoenix and then drove to Las Vegas and they had the full multi-car setup.

1645
01:43:57,801 --> 01:43:59,461
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh.

1646
01:43:59,842 --> 01:44:01,642
[SPEAKER_01]: It was when the Luxor had a Sega arcade.

1647
01:44:02,543 --> 01:44:07,485
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was completely in heaven and I paid the five bucks a game to play it twice.

1648
01:44:08,305 --> 01:44:11,406
[SPEAKER_01]: And my mom was screaming at me for my fiscal irresponsibility.

1649
01:44:12,067 --> 01:44:12,547
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um...

1650
01:44:14,289 --> 01:44:16,310
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved it then, hated it when I worked at an arcade.

1651
01:44:17,070 --> 01:44:19,391
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it was really awesome.

1652
01:44:20,271 --> 01:44:32,694
[SPEAKER_01]: And they actually came out before there was the Daytona USA Museum, but it had all that attached to it.

1653
01:44:34,115 --> 01:44:38,256
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was that it came out as Sega Racing Classic because they lost the Daytona license.

1654
01:44:40,608 --> 01:44:51,732
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, the Sega Racing Classic runs at 720p, and like I said, it lost the vocal charts because of the licensing.

1655
01:44:52,112 --> 01:44:56,434
[SPEAKER_01]: Now for the home versions, there was a Daytona USA that came out on Saturn in 1995, and Twindos in 1996.

1656
01:44:59,615 --> 01:45:07,301
[SPEAKER_01]: It did drop the frame rates significantly, about 20 frames per second, and clipped pretty nasty.

1657
01:45:07,501 --> 01:45:09,683
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not the best version.

1658
01:45:11,184 --> 01:45:16,828
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it handled well, and they had planned on doing one on the 32X, but we all know what happened with the 32X.

1659
01:45:16,949 --> 01:45:19,390
[SPEAKER_01]: At least we got space here, you're right.

1660
01:45:20,371 --> 01:45:34,933
[SPEAKER_01]: so there were 8 tracks including the original 3 from the arcade and 2 additional tracks from the Sega Championship Circuit Edition and then there were final 3 and that was for the Dreamcast version which the Dreamcast version was pretty good

1661
01:45:36,730 --> 01:45:40,373
[SPEAKER_01]: They completely redid all of the graphics.

1662
01:45:40,453 --> 01:45:42,175
[SPEAKER_01]: The pop-up was removed.

1663
01:45:42,515 --> 01:45:45,058
[SPEAKER_01]: The cars had transparent glass, higher poly.

1664
01:45:45,138 --> 01:45:50,263
[SPEAKER_01]: It was basically like the HD version, except it controlled like shit.

1665
01:45:50,283 --> 01:45:51,645
[SPEAKER_01]: Just saying.

1666
01:45:52,245 --> 01:45:54,466
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess you can't have it all, huh?

1667
01:45:54,506 --> 01:46:00,650
[SPEAKER_01]: They did an arcade faithful port for PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade.

1668
01:46:01,531 --> 01:46:06,474
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has widescreen, high def, 8 player multiplayer over Xbox Live or the PlayStation Network.

1669
01:46:08,075 --> 01:46:09,936
[SPEAKER_01]: More content with different challenges.

1670
01:46:09,976 --> 01:46:17,701
[SPEAKER_01]: Karaoke mode, which I am embarrassed to say my husband has sat in karaoke mode singing Roaring Start.

1671
01:46:18,481 --> 01:46:19,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Because he's awesome.

1672
01:46:20,117 --> 01:46:21,417
[SPEAKER_01]: Because my husband's a big dork.

1673
01:46:21,437 --> 01:46:22,458
[SPEAKER_06]: Dan, you're awesome.

1674
01:46:22,818 --> 01:46:23,658
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan's not even listening.

1675
01:46:23,698 --> 01:46:24,738
[SPEAKER_01]: He's watching Chair of Swords.

1676
01:46:25,819 --> 01:46:27,799
[SPEAKER_01]: With the German chocolate cake and Mystique.

1677
01:46:28,700 --> 01:46:32,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we have pizza and Spike and Tim, so... Yeah.

1678
01:46:32,861 --> 01:46:33,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1679
01:46:33,961 --> 01:46:35,382
[SPEAKER_01]: So, do-do-do-do-do-do you.

1680
01:46:39,363 --> 01:46:41,664
[SPEAKER_06]: And I challenge everyone to say that to a friend this week.

1681
01:46:41,744 --> 01:46:43,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, do-do-do-do-do-do you.

1682
01:46:46,423 --> 01:46:47,223
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, anyway.

1683
01:46:49,284 --> 01:46:52,466
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, you had, in the Sega Saturn version, you had unlockable cars.

1684
01:46:52,506 --> 01:47:02,251
[SPEAKER_01]: You had the red or blue and yellow and the black version, depending on what transmission you picked in the arcade version and in the Saturn version.

1685
01:47:05,826 --> 01:47:31,470
[SPEAKER_01]: and basically, like I was saying, now the singer and this is what I was talking about earlier about AM2 doing the game is that AM2 had their own sound division as well and it was Takenobu Mitsuyoshi who was doing the singing and the tracks are Let's Go Away and The King of Speed, which is the roaring start Pounding Pavement, Let's Go Away, which is the attract mode

1686
01:47:33,031 --> 01:47:38,577
[SPEAKER_01]: and Sky High, which is actually my favorite music in that game because I want to fry Sky High.

1687
01:47:40,951 --> 01:48:01,937
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the arcade version also used a Yamaha sound chip that completely just redid, made the music sound really good, really professional, but they had to re-record it for the Saturn version because the music was actually synthesized in-game with the vocals playing over it.

1688
01:48:02,077 --> 01:48:05,378
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's Daytona USA.

1689
01:48:05,818 --> 01:48:07,258
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not doing it again.

1690
01:48:08,238 --> 01:48:08,738
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm done.

1691
01:48:09,019 --> 01:48:09,319
[SPEAKER_06]: I will.

1692
01:48:09,559 --> 01:48:09,719
Oh...

1693
01:48:12,992 --> 01:48:16,794
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, you can also play as the car in Fighter's Mega Mix.

1694
01:48:17,094 --> 01:48:17,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

1695
01:48:18,675 --> 01:48:21,917
[SPEAKER_06]: There it is, your classic game of the week, Daytona.

1696
01:48:22,697 --> 01:48:23,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Good pick.

1697
01:48:23,898 --> 01:48:24,879
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about time, honestly.

1698
01:48:24,999 --> 01:48:27,060
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a recommendation for a classic game of the week.

1699
01:48:27,540 --> 01:48:28,361
[SPEAKER_00]: Super Mario Bros.

1700
01:48:28,581 --> 01:48:28,361
3.

1701
01:48:29,241 --> 01:48:31,002
[SPEAKER_06]: I think she did it a long time ago.

1702
01:48:31,703 --> 01:48:32,203
[SPEAKER_01]: And World.

1703
01:48:32,823 --> 01:48:35,705
[SPEAKER_06]: She's been doing this segment since episode 180-something, I think.

1704
01:48:35,765 --> 01:48:36,245
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're on 502?

1705
01:48:36,585 --> 01:48:38,847
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, 200-something, I think.

1706
01:48:38,887 --> 01:48:39,587
[SPEAKER_01]: Something like that.

1707
01:48:39,927 --> 01:48:40,988
[SPEAKER_06]: You've had several segments.

1708
01:48:41,069 --> 01:48:41,989
[SPEAKER_06]: It's changed a few times.

1709
01:48:42,030 --> 01:48:43,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Classic Game of the Week started around 200 something.

1710
01:48:43,551 --> 01:48:48,136
[SPEAKER_01]: But we stopped doing Website of the Week when I did one site twice.

1711
01:48:48,456 --> 01:48:48,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1712
01:48:48,937 --> 01:48:49,898
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I couldn't really think of any.

1713
01:48:49,918 --> 01:48:50,559
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the site?

1714
01:48:50,639 --> 01:48:53,562
[SPEAKER_06]: You did one Classic Game twice, and that didn't stop you.

1715
01:48:53,982 --> 01:48:54,543
[SPEAKER_01]: What did I do?

1716
01:48:54,763 --> 01:48:56,025
[SPEAKER_06]: You did Final Fantasy VI twice.

1717
01:48:56,085 --> 01:48:59,268
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, if you're going to do any game twice... Okay, one was three, one was six.

1718
01:48:59,408 --> 01:49:00,670
[SPEAKER_01]: There, I did versions.

1719
01:49:01,210 --> 01:49:01,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't judge me.

1720
01:49:02,907 --> 01:49:06,349
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to do Sega Rally because it's very hard easy left.

1721
01:49:06,749 --> 01:49:07,809
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, maybe.

1722
01:49:07,889 --> 01:49:08,449
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, look.

1723
01:49:09,570 --> 01:49:10,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Long show.

1724
01:49:10,390 --> 01:49:11,531
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got to take a break.

1725
01:49:11,591 --> 01:49:12,251
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to come back.

1726
01:49:12,331 --> 01:49:13,392
[SPEAKER_06]: We have rapid fire news.

1727
01:49:13,732 --> 01:49:15,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Fugle Question of the Week coming as well.

1728
01:49:15,733 --> 01:49:16,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Some more news stories for you guys.

1729
01:49:16,853 --> 01:49:18,254
[SPEAKER_06]: And as we promised, list lists.

1730
01:49:18,634 --> 01:49:22,316
[SPEAKER_06]: What mascot are we going to gift to Sega just out of the goodness of our hearts?

1731
01:49:22,376 --> 01:49:26,477
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you the listeners want us to gift to Sega for their mascot competition?

1732
01:49:27,318 --> 01:49:29,839
[SPEAKER_06]: We will beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

1733
01:49:30,922 --> 01:49:33,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Right back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1734
01:49:40,766 --> 01:49:47,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live on this, I almost said Friday night.

1735
01:49:48,089 --> 01:49:49,369
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish the weekend was starting over.

1736
01:49:49,469 --> 01:49:52,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Sunday night, April the 28th of 2013.

1737
01:49:53,431 --> 01:49:58,873
[SPEAKER_06]: And joined in studio tonight with Captain Spike from the Game Buoy podcast at GameBuoy.org.

1738
01:50:01,127 --> 01:50:01,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Ahoy.

1739
01:50:01,747 --> 01:50:10,250
[SPEAKER_06]: We were talking about, you and I were talking, I won't spoil it on the show, but you and I were talking about some potential upcoming topics that you're going to get into on your show, and I was like, oh, that's real good.

1740
01:50:10,650 --> 01:50:11,150
[SPEAKER_06]: That's real good.

1741
01:50:12,230 --> 01:50:14,291
[SPEAKER_06]: If I don't steal them for OLR 503.

1742
01:50:14,671 --> 01:50:15,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Rude.

1743
01:50:16,212 --> 01:50:16,972
[SPEAKER_06]: And ignorant.

1744
01:50:17,112 --> 01:50:18,152
[SPEAKER_06]: I would never, I would never.

1745
01:50:18,852 --> 01:50:22,434
[SPEAKER_06]: Also joining us tonight, Tim, who is on his very first podcast.

1746
01:50:22,774 --> 01:50:23,174
[SPEAKER_06]: What up?

1747
01:50:23,474 --> 01:50:24,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you having a good time?

1748
01:50:24,374 --> 01:50:25,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it more fun than you thought it would?

1749
01:50:25,354 --> 01:50:26,755
[SPEAKER_00]: It's less terrifying than I imagined.

1750
01:50:26,915 --> 01:50:27,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah?

1751
01:50:27,435 --> 01:50:27,615
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1752
01:50:27,695 --> 01:50:30,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it helps that it's like in, like, literally...

1753
01:50:30,476 --> 01:50:36,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Literally the corner of my apartment and not like a studio with lights everywhere.

1754
01:50:36,859 --> 01:50:41,722
[SPEAKER_06]: People think that this show, because it's so damn old, people think that we have this recording space.

1755
01:50:42,102 --> 01:50:49,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Or maybe because there's certain other podcasters out there that put out that perception that you need $35,000 to do a gaming podcast.

1756
01:50:49,626 --> 01:50:50,407
[SPEAKER_06]: No tea, no shade.

1757
01:50:50,847 --> 01:50:52,668
[SPEAKER_06]: All tea, all tea.

1758
01:50:53,548 --> 01:50:57,451
[SPEAKER_06]: that we have all this expensive equipment, but we don't really have any of that.

1759
01:50:57,751 --> 01:50:59,252
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's pretty chill.

1760
01:50:59,472 --> 01:51:03,134
[SPEAKER_00]: I slept on the floor not four feet from here last night.

1761
01:51:03,535 --> 01:51:06,697
[SPEAKER_06]: You can literally say you slept with Orange Lounge Radio.

1762
01:51:07,777 --> 01:51:08,598
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to tell anyone.

1763
01:51:08,618 --> 01:51:09,839
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't spread that rumor.

1764
01:51:09,859 --> 01:51:15,963
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have to say that when we buy a house, we're definitely looking for a place that has room for OLR.

1765
01:51:16,083 --> 01:51:18,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, Alan and I are looking at moving ourselves.

1766
01:51:18,744 --> 01:51:20,165
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God, let's all get a big house.

1767
01:51:21,306 --> 01:51:22,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my God, I'd kill you all.

1768
01:51:26,557 --> 01:51:27,637
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't talking about that.

1769
01:51:27,737 --> 01:51:28,157
[SPEAKER_01]: I said about Rob.

1770
01:51:28,178 --> 01:51:28,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Been there, done that.

1771
01:51:28,978 --> 01:51:29,978
[SPEAKER_06]: I lived with Loki before.

1772
01:51:30,078 --> 01:51:32,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Been there, done that.

1773
01:51:32,359 --> 01:51:33,919
[SPEAKER_01]: You have seen me drunk in my pajamas.

1774
01:51:33,999 --> 01:51:35,840
[SPEAKER_06]: With all due respect, Loki was a great roommate.

1775
01:51:35,880 --> 01:51:36,700
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to make that clear.

1776
01:51:36,740 --> 01:51:39,281
[SPEAKER_06]: The only reason, you know, he got married and blah-de-blah.

1777
01:51:39,501 --> 01:51:42,101
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have a kid, so that would be a little weird.

1778
01:51:42,121 --> 01:51:43,022
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be a challenge.

1779
01:51:44,322 --> 01:51:47,243
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, Josh looked totally cute in that last picture.

1780
01:51:47,263 --> 01:51:47,983
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have to say.

1781
01:51:48,343 --> 01:51:50,984
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, yeah, Nelly's been posting a lot of pictures of Josh lately.

1782
01:51:51,004 --> 01:51:52,885
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta say, cute, cute kid.

1783
01:51:52,905 --> 01:51:57,086
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, not that I didn't think so before, but just I'm being reminded consistently on Facebook this week.

1784
01:51:57,446 --> 01:51:58,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Cute, cute kid.

1785
01:51:58,566 --> 01:51:59,747
[SPEAKER_01]: For the record, I have to say this.

1786
01:51:59,927 --> 01:52:03,908
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave Julian the Nerf shield and dagger for his birthday.

1787
01:52:04,628 --> 01:52:09,050
[SPEAKER_01]: He had the most maniacal grin on his face and wanted to immediately sword fight.

1788
01:52:11,461 --> 01:52:17,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Looking at comments from our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com SSJ100Matt says, the OLR beach house?

1789
01:52:18,865 --> 01:52:25,129
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like the summer spinoff where the Saved by the Bell kids all worked at the beach retreat or whatever.

1790
01:52:25,509 --> 01:52:28,991
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't you dare use Jersey Shore and OLR in the same sentence.

1791
01:52:29,131 --> 01:52:29,912
[SPEAKER_01]: I will cut a bitch.

1792
01:52:30,992 --> 01:52:32,854
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkTetsuya says move into the fort.

1793
01:52:32,974 --> 01:52:34,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we talked about that some time ago.

1794
01:52:34,895 --> 01:52:37,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Codeman says OLR real world.

1795
01:52:38,698 --> 01:52:40,279
[SPEAKER_06]: There would definitely be some drama.

1796
01:52:40,299 --> 01:52:41,179
[SPEAKER_01]: Start getting real.

1797
01:52:41,420 --> 01:52:45,102
[SPEAKER_06]: If Jamie and I lived in the same house like 24-7, there would definitely be some drama.

1798
01:52:46,583 --> 01:52:50,646
[SPEAKER_00]: My husband would murder one of us.

1799
01:52:50,666 --> 01:52:53,148
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, what's that, Tim?

1800
01:52:54,509 --> 01:52:56,010
[SPEAKER_00]: Rehab from tacos, maybe?

1801
01:52:57,151 --> 01:52:58,592
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't do drugs already.

1802
01:52:58,672 --> 01:52:59,813
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob Roberts, my strange addiction.

1803
01:52:59,873 --> 01:53:01,594
[SPEAKER_01]: Every Tuesday would be Taco Tuesday.

1804
01:53:02,715 --> 01:53:05,037
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd have the live cast from Felipe's on Tuesday.

1805
01:53:05,057 --> 01:53:06,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Your guys' cycle would line up.

1806
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:10,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck off.

1807
01:53:12,062 --> 01:53:12,322
[SPEAKER_01]: Hearts.

1808
01:53:13,698 --> 01:53:19,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's move to rapid fire news while I stare at Captain Spike with my death eyes.

1809
01:53:19,602 --> 01:53:21,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, start us off.

1810
01:53:21,403 --> 01:53:24,125
[SPEAKER_01]: I think maybe we already did sync up.

1811
01:53:25,025 --> 01:53:25,486
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1812
01:53:26,426 --> 01:53:30,889
[SPEAKER_08]: You may remember an independent game that kind of ripped off of Super Mario Bros.

1813
01:53:31,069 --> 01:53:31,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Super Mario Bros.

1814
01:53:31,750 --> 01:53:32,310
[SPEAKER_08]: Crossover.

1815
01:53:32,330 --> 01:53:34,732
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a fun game where you get to play all the Super Mario Bros.

1816
01:53:34,752 --> 01:53:41,516
[SPEAKER_08]: levels, but you get to play them as not only Super Mario, or Luigi, or Zelda, or...

1817
01:53:42,797 --> 01:54:07,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Simon Belmont and that kind of stuff so now they have 3.0 because it's celebrating three years and they've got a pretty interesting I didn't know that this game existed but apparently there's a game called Super Mario Brothers Special that has it's a crossover between Super Mario Brothers and like Donkey Kong like they have Donkey Kong power-ups and stuff like that and barrels and all sorts of cool stuff so that's the newest update is going to be levels out of that game

1818
01:54:08,642 --> 01:54:33,090
[SPEAKER_08]: and they have a whole bunch of other you know game types um you know because one of the things that the game does is it changes the way it looks and so you can be playing with all the different characters from you know Castlevania and stuff it just changes the whole sprite set and the sound effects and stuff it's really interesting but if you want to check it out um looks like uh explodingrabbit.com is where you're gonna be able to find that game of course

1819
01:54:34,150 --> 01:54:36,392
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know when the 3.0 update is coming.

1820
01:54:36,512 --> 01:54:37,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Soon, though.

1821
01:54:37,412 --> 01:54:38,373
[SPEAKER_08]: But they have a trailer for it.

1822
01:54:40,374 --> 01:54:41,375
[SPEAKER_05]: How are they pushing that?

1823
01:54:41,515 --> 01:54:45,497
[SPEAKER_05]: I gave them money on their Kickstarter for Super Retro Squad.

1824
01:54:45,737 --> 01:54:47,038
[SPEAKER_05]: That was supposed to be in March.

1825
01:54:47,798 --> 01:54:48,079
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1826
01:54:48,399 --> 01:54:51,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, no Kickstarter is ever on time.

1827
01:54:51,801 --> 01:54:52,881
[SPEAKER_08]: How's your Ouya?

1828
01:54:52,901 --> 01:54:53,622
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you get your Ouya?

1829
01:54:54,358 --> 01:54:57,919
[SPEAKER_08]: My OUYA right now is chilling in, where was it?

1830
01:54:58,079 --> 01:55:00,279
[SPEAKER_08]: It's in the Bay Area right now.

1831
01:55:01,399 --> 01:55:02,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Just outside of Fremont.

1832
01:55:03,700 --> 01:55:04,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Daily City?

1833
01:55:04,900 --> 01:55:05,920
[SPEAKER_08]: Fucking Fremont.

1834
01:55:06,561 --> 01:55:07,361
[SPEAKER_08]: No, seriously.

1835
01:55:07,481 --> 01:55:08,981
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in my living room, by the way.

1836
01:55:09,001 --> 01:55:10,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, fucking Fremont.

1837
01:55:10,581 --> 01:55:11,222
[SPEAKER_08]: You know why?

1838
01:55:12,442 --> 01:55:13,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Not even Fremont.

1839
01:55:13,122 --> 01:55:13,802
[SPEAKER_08]: Fremont's out of this.

1840
01:55:13,882 --> 01:55:15,963
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, you know, it's a close by standard.

1841
01:55:15,983 --> 01:55:18,583
[SPEAKER_08]: But no, seriously, fucking Daily City or whatever.

1842
01:55:18,603 --> 01:55:19,283
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at the Cow Palace.

1843
01:55:19,383 --> 01:55:19,903
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever it is.

1844
01:55:21,364 --> 01:55:22,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's right where Alan used to live.

1845
01:55:22,884 --> 01:55:27,969
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's been sitting there since Thursday, not moving at all.

1846
01:55:28,369 --> 01:55:29,110
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the traffic.

1847
01:55:29,350 --> 01:55:34,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, but you see, it keeps getting worse.

1848
01:55:34,634 --> 01:55:36,796
[SPEAKER_08]: First off, it took forever for them to ship it.

1849
01:55:37,036 --> 01:55:39,338
[SPEAKER_08]: They shipped it by boat.

1850
01:55:39,439 --> 01:55:43,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, we could do a three-hour show of you bitching about your OUYA.

1851
01:55:43,122 --> 01:55:44,043
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm with him on this one.

1852
01:55:44,063 --> 01:55:45,604
[SPEAKER_05]: They haven't shipped mine out yet either.

1853
01:55:45,684 --> 01:55:46,785
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, listen, here's how it's going.

1854
01:55:47,165 --> 01:55:48,286
[SPEAKER_08]: So they shipped it by boat.

1855
01:55:49,367 --> 01:55:50,469
[SPEAKER_08]: First off, they picked DHL.

1856
01:55:51,110 --> 01:55:52,813
[SPEAKER_08]: DHL, the quality shipper.

1857
01:55:53,274 --> 01:55:55,718
[SPEAKER_08]: The only worst shipper in the world would be Old Dominion.

1858
01:56:01,687 --> 01:56:04,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it better not be a DHL car because that car would be moving fucking slow.

1859
01:56:04,890 --> 01:56:06,131
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a damn heated Loki.

1860
01:56:07,192 --> 01:56:08,353
[SPEAKER_08]: So they shipped it DHL.

1861
01:56:08,754 --> 01:56:26,250
[SPEAKER_08]: DHL and then the strategic mailing thing, they passed it off to the United States Postal Service, which, from my experience shipping eBay stuff, they always scan those packages and they totally never just go weeks at a time without...

1862
01:56:26,630 --> 01:56:28,370
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, here's where your package is.

1863
01:56:28,711 --> 01:56:31,051
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I'm expecting my package hopefully on Monday.

1864
01:56:31,271 --> 01:56:32,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise, I don't know where it is.

1865
01:56:33,372 --> 01:56:42,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it shouldn't take a whole weekend from Thursday to go two hours in distance.

1866
01:56:43,875 --> 01:56:44,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you done?

1867
01:56:45,015 --> 01:56:45,295
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm done.

1868
01:56:47,344 --> 01:56:50,665
[SPEAKER_08]: So there was a new game coming from Take-Two.

1869
01:56:51,785 --> 01:56:55,906
[SPEAKER_08]: XCOM, or at least the Bureau, XCOM Declassified.

1870
01:56:55,966 --> 01:57:02,428
[SPEAKER_08]: It was that first-person XCOM game that no one wanted, and now it's a third-person XCOM game that some people might want.

1871
01:57:03,648 --> 01:57:04,808
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a squad-based shooter.

1872
01:57:05,769 --> 01:57:06,529
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah.

1873
01:57:07,209 --> 01:57:14,131
[SPEAKER_08]: It's supposed to be like a prequel to the whole XCOM series to figure out how the XCOM Bureau, I guess, was created or something.

1874
01:57:14,751 --> 01:57:15,071
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1875
01:57:15,691 --> 01:57:15,811
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1876
01:57:16,431 --> 01:57:42,837
[SPEAKER_08]: and last but not least the Indie Royale Lunar Bundle as we were talking about earlier purchasing pretty great deal if you buy you pay what you want $6 gets you the game $8 gets you some additional stuff including the Reawakening album which is from some Commodore 64 and Amiga chiptune artist TJK and then also in this bundle you get some cool stuff including Back to the Future

1877
01:57:43,597 --> 01:57:58,842
[SPEAKER_08]: the whole Telltale game and Dungeon Hearts, Cargo Commander and let's see what else PID was the other game so I bought it, it's pretty awesome so check it out

1878
01:58:00,968 --> 01:58:03,870
[SPEAKER_06]: All righty, let's move on and talk about the Wii U Virtual Console.

1879
01:58:03,930 --> 01:58:05,832
[SPEAKER_06]: We've kind of referenced this already in the show.

1880
01:58:06,072 --> 01:58:08,013
[SPEAKER_06]: If you didn't know, that Wii U update is out.

1881
01:58:08,374 --> 01:58:18,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it does make a lot of stuff on the console faster, so here's a reason to turn on your Wii U if you beat Zombie U and Mario U a couple months ago and you really haven't had a reason.

1882
01:58:19,262 --> 01:58:22,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Fire it up, download the update, and you can check out some of these virtual console games.

1883
01:58:22,684 --> 01:58:23,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Balloon Fight...

1884
01:58:24,145 --> 01:58:33,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Donkey Kong Jr., Excitebike, Kirby's Adventure, Punch-Out, F-Zero, Super Mario World, and of course, Ice Climbers, all available on Virtual Console.

1885
01:58:34,051 --> 01:58:41,376
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, even though I said, you know, when we first announced the Virtual Console on Wii U, I wasn't going to do this.

1886
01:58:42,236 --> 01:58:42,636
[SPEAKER_06]: I did it.

1887
01:58:42,716 --> 01:58:45,438
[SPEAKER_06]: I paid the $1.50 to upgrade my copy of Super Mario World.

1888
01:58:45,498 --> 01:58:47,339
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta say, it runs really nice.

1889
01:58:47,479 --> 01:58:49,620
[SPEAKER_06]: I really prefer it on Wii U to the Wii.

1890
01:58:49,760 --> 01:58:51,081
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't think it would be that big of a difference.

1891
01:58:51,161 --> 01:58:54,322
[SPEAKER_06]: And how could a 20-year-old game be that different?

1892
01:58:54,362 --> 01:59:04,468
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm telling you, with the HDMI, without me having to consistently change the proportions on the television, with the audio coming out of the Wii U pad as well as the TV, it works great.

1893
01:59:04,608 --> 01:59:06,369
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, alright.

1894
01:59:06,809 --> 01:59:09,370
[SPEAKER_06]: I was wrong when I first judged Virtual Console a few months ago.

1895
01:59:10,071 --> 01:59:10,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Fine.

1896
01:59:10,951 --> 01:59:11,872
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1897
01:59:28,246 --> 01:59:29,487
[SPEAKER_06]: hence the name Unmasked.

1898
01:59:29,587 --> 01:59:31,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sure DarkSakura is all about this.

1899
01:59:31,248 --> 01:59:32,249
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to play it.

1900
01:59:33,049 --> 01:59:38,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Characters like Batman, places like the Batcave, supposed to be out on PC, Wii U, and 3DS.

1901
01:59:38,873 --> 01:59:40,834
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's definitely a Nintendo and a PC thing.

1902
01:59:41,615 --> 01:59:46,898
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember the last Scribblenauts game was one of the launch titles for Wii U, so this will make an interesting fit.

1903
01:59:47,238 --> 01:59:53,802
[SPEAKER_06]: It will be a very interesting step for the series, but seeing as Scribblenauts is part of WB Games, it does make sense.

1904
01:59:54,123 --> 01:59:56,744
[SPEAKER_06]: So curiosity peaked.

1905
01:59:56,965 --> 01:59:57,425
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll say that.

1906
01:59:58,422 --> 02:00:00,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, this rumor's going around.

1907
02:00:01,124 --> 02:00:02,525
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how much weight I give this.

1908
02:00:02,745 --> 02:00:09,670
[SPEAKER_06]: It could certainly be a game changer, but the rumor is that Take-Two is supposed to announce Grand Theft Auto V for next-generation consoles next month.

1909
02:00:10,010 --> 02:00:17,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, did this originate with an analyst, that infamous games analyst that always says, because if so, then this holds absolutely no weight.

1910
02:00:17,915 --> 02:00:19,276
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not coming out next-gen.

1911
02:00:19,596 --> 02:00:20,797
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not, and here's why.

1912
02:00:20,837 --> 02:00:27,942
[SPEAKER_08]: It's because they're going to do a PC, they will do a PC version later on, just like they did with 4, and they're going to do that probably with the next-gen consoles

1913
02:00:28,742 --> 02:00:30,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's my other problem with this article.

1914
02:00:30,424 --> 02:00:35,328
[SPEAKER_06]: They say the announcement is supposed to be coming during an upcoming investor event on May 16th.

1915
02:00:35,848 --> 02:00:36,729
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't make announcements.

1916
02:00:47,017 --> 02:00:51,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's our plan for the future in broad terms, not in these types of specifics.

1917
02:00:52,121 --> 02:00:54,923
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the big problem I have with this that's going around right now.

1918
02:00:54,943 --> 02:01:03,370
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think, and here's the other thing too, is they're not going to spend the additional time to make a next-gen version of the game when they have a current-gen version of the game that people will buy anyways.

1919
02:01:04,571 --> 02:01:08,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless someone paid them big money to make it an exclusive to their console.

1920
02:01:08,773 --> 02:01:15,577
[SPEAKER_08]: I still don't think they would do that because even if they brought out the game, they're going to do a PC version at the same time.

1921
02:01:15,637 --> 02:01:16,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Because why bother?

1922
02:01:16,498 --> 02:01:21,721
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're going to develop a higher-res version of the game, you might as well make a PC version as well so that you can put it out on PCs.

1923
02:01:22,041 --> 02:01:24,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless someone bought it off.

1924
02:01:24,662 --> 02:01:26,623
[SPEAKER_06]: That's always a possibility on the table.

1925
02:01:26,823 --> 02:01:27,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone bought it off.

1926
02:01:27,844 --> 02:01:28,885
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always on the table.

1927
02:01:29,545 --> 02:01:30,126
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1928
02:01:50,824 --> 02:01:53,907
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm gonna fucking kill somebody if that happens.

1929
02:01:54,607 --> 02:01:55,488
[SPEAKER_08]: I will cut a bitch.

1930
02:01:55,748 --> 02:01:57,830
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you should say that on a radio show.

1931
02:01:57,890 --> 02:02:00,512
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I will fucking kill somebody.

1932
02:02:01,132 --> 02:02:03,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Virtually, people.

1933
02:02:03,354 --> 02:02:03,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Allegedly.

1934
02:02:04,175 --> 02:02:05,055
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Grand Theft Auto.

1935
02:02:05,096 --> 02:02:07,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course he will kill somebody digitally.

1936
02:02:07,517 --> 02:02:08,798
[SPEAKER_06]: He'll kill a hooker.

1937
02:02:08,918 --> 02:02:12,141
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I think I will have to kill somebody.

1938
02:02:12,301 --> 02:02:14,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't say that in this world, Loki.

1939
02:02:14,983 --> 02:02:15,884
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't say that.

1940
02:02:16,044 --> 02:02:16,404
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura

1941
02:02:34,750 --> 02:02:36,031
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I gotta get my story up.

1942
02:02:36,171 --> 02:02:36,371
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1943
02:02:37,752 --> 02:02:39,453
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, my throat's a little owie right now.

1944
02:02:39,974 --> 02:02:40,254
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1945
02:02:40,894 --> 02:02:43,556
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we have some download content for Revengeance.

1946
02:02:43,636 --> 02:02:47,318
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Blade Wolf, and it's going to be out in May in Japan.

1947
02:02:47,779 --> 02:02:55,804
[SPEAKER_01]: On the 9th of May, we don't have a Western date yet, but I would assume that it would have to be somewhere near there, and it's gonna be 1,000 yen.

1948
02:02:57,025 --> 02:03:01,668
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're looking at maybe a $10 DLC when we get it.

1949
02:03:03,229 --> 02:03:03,869
[SPEAKER_01]: In other news,

1950
02:03:04,970 --> 02:03:05,831
[SPEAKER_01]: Close window.

1951
02:03:06,011 --> 02:03:06,331
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1952
02:03:06,852 --> 02:03:09,814
[SPEAKER_01]: There is going to be a sequel to River City Ransom.

1953
02:03:10,675 --> 02:03:14,618
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a crowdfunding thing open for it.

1954
02:03:16,040 --> 02:03:18,982
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to make it an official River City Ransom.

1955
02:03:19,302 --> 02:03:25,047
[SPEAKER_01]: They're working with the River City Ransom EX developer million to do the actual sequel.

1956
02:03:25,227 --> 02:03:28,030
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're hoping it's going to be August 2014.

1957
02:03:29,351 --> 02:03:31,933
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've got a placeholder website out for this right now.

1958
02:03:32,386 --> 02:03:40,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to throw a little background into this, I think the reason why they say actual sequel is because something is coming on 3DS, I think, but it's not the same people.

1959
02:03:40,728 --> 02:03:43,729
[SPEAKER_06]: So you kind of have the two groups now.

1960
02:03:44,289 --> 02:03:49,111
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they doing another Neketsu game on 3DS?

1961
02:03:49,891 --> 02:03:50,651
[SPEAKER_06]: I think so, yeah.

1962
02:03:50,791 --> 02:03:52,432
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the actual Kunio games?

1963
02:03:53,172 --> 02:03:53,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1964
02:03:54,002 --> 02:03:55,263
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, that will be far superior.

1965
02:03:57,264 --> 02:03:57,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

1966
02:03:57,584 --> 02:03:57,984
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually.

1967
02:03:59,425 --> 02:04:01,266
[SPEAKER_06]: The shade, the shade of it all.

1968
02:04:01,666 --> 02:04:02,226
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

1969
02:04:02,306 --> 02:04:09,069
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just true, because you cannot... Like, okay, you played Dodgeball and Super Dodgeball, right?

1970
02:04:09,129 --> 02:04:10,070
[SPEAKER_01]: They're actual Kunio games.

1971
02:04:10,730 --> 02:04:12,411
[SPEAKER_01]: You've played knockoff Dodgeball games, right?

1972
02:04:12,511 --> 02:04:13,191
[SPEAKER_01]: Were they as good?

1973
02:04:13,391 --> 02:04:13,611
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

1974
02:04:14,532 --> 02:04:18,194
[SPEAKER_01]: Is anything going to top the original hot-blooded downtown fight?

1975
02:04:19,214 --> 02:04:20,915
[SPEAKER_06]: The Neo Geo one was great.

1976
02:04:22,113 --> 02:04:22,253
[SPEAKER_01]: TXK

1977
02:04:45,899 --> 02:04:47,199
[SPEAKER_01]: TXK, whatever, TXK.

1978
02:04:47,600 --> 02:04:48,140
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what, Rob?

1979
02:04:48,200 --> 02:04:49,200
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so excited.

1980
02:04:49,320 --> 02:04:49,940
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm dyslexic.

1981
02:04:50,741 --> 02:04:53,601
[SPEAKER_01]: I have excited onset dyslexia.

1982
02:04:54,242 --> 02:04:54,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1983
02:04:56,622 --> 02:04:57,863
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm quaking a little bit right now.

1984
02:04:58,363 --> 02:04:58,983
[SPEAKER_01]: Shaking, crying.

1985
02:05:00,564 --> 02:05:02,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe your super zapper needs to recharge.

1986
02:05:03,545 --> 02:05:04,925
[SPEAKER_01]: Super zapper recharge.

1987
02:05:05,585 --> 02:05:07,506
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, for anyone who lives under a rock...

1988
02:05:08,630 --> 02:05:32,827
[SPEAKER_01]: who has been living under a rock or in a cave or under the sea Tempest 2000 is probably one of the best games in the universe even as frustratingly difficult as it can be it's all because of the music because nothing else matters and it came out on the Jaguar which was the only good game on the Jaguar next to what Alien vs. Predator no that wasn't even very good either for the time yeah but it was still the best game that ever came out on the Jaguar hands down

1989
02:05:33,482 --> 02:05:34,563
[SPEAKER_01]: KXT KXT

1990
02:05:58,740 --> 02:06:04,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's take a chance to go to the Fugle Question of the Week.

1991
02:06:13,984 --> 02:06:17,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Take Facebook, take Google, slam them together and you get Fugle.

1992
02:06:17,287 --> 02:06:21,471
[SPEAKER_06]: And we ask a question on our Fugle Facebook and Google communities every week.

1993
02:06:21,631 --> 02:06:22,993
[SPEAKER_06]: And this week is about movies.

1994
02:06:23,413 --> 02:06:24,594
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to apologize in advance.

1995
02:06:24,614 --> 02:06:27,217
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to have enough time to read all the answers because we're running long tonight.

1996
02:06:27,237 --> 02:06:27,977
[SPEAKER_06]: We still have a list list.

1997
02:06:28,918 --> 02:06:35,845
[SPEAKER_06]: But I want to encourage everybody to visit our communities, Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio and Google Plus to see all the answers in full.

1998
02:06:36,846 --> 02:06:40,730
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some news this week about Ratchet and Clank as well as Heavenly Sword becoming a movie.

1999
02:06:41,150 --> 02:06:42,652
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you feel about video game movies?

2000
02:06:43,072 --> 02:06:45,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Most have a reputation for being pretty bad.

2001
02:06:45,475 --> 02:06:47,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think this helps or hurts gaming?

2002
02:06:47,337 --> 02:06:50,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Should Hollywood be making more video game movies or less?

2003
02:06:51,622 --> 02:06:54,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's take a look at some of the answers on Google+.

2004
02:06:55,558 --> 02:06:56,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft says,

2005
02:07:22,564 --> 02:07:25,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Flaco Jones, which by the way, I want to congratulate Flaco Jones.

2006
02:07:25,987 --> 02:07:28,188
[SPEAKER_06]: He's now officially staffed for VOG.

2007
02:07:28,608 --> 02:07:33,512
[SPEAKER_06]: His first movie review went up, and he's got another article he's posting during the week.

2008
02:07:33,832 --> 02:07:39,816
[SPEAKER_06]: He's going to be doing a lot of the stuff from a film perspective, in the written form, so that'll be great.

2009
02:07:40,637 --> 02:07:41,577
[SPEAKER_06]: So congrats, Flaco.

2010
02:07:42,118 --> 02:07:49,062
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's also going to be a very interesting change for the game, because as you know, staff of VOG don't go on the regular leaderboards.

2011
02:07:49,442 --> 02:07:51,364
[SPEAKER_06]: So Flaco has been winning every month.

2012
02:07:52,004 --> 02:07:54,365
[SPEAKER_06]: So, hmm, now things are going to get interesting.

2013
02:07:55,105 --> 02:07:56,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, but anyhow, Flacco says,

2014
02:08:15,153 --> 02:08:24,996
[SPEAKER_06]: and Red Entertainment lastly on Google Plus says in an ideal situation you need a writer, director and producer all having good track records working together as a team.

2015
02:08:25,416 --> 02:08:28,657
[SPEAKER_06]: That is why I'm looking forward to Tyler Perry Presents Halo.

2016
02:08:32,458 --> 02:08:32,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Love it.

2017
02:08:34,309 --> 02:08:36,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do a few answers from Facebook as well.

2018
02:08:36,390 --> 02:08:43,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Critical Myth, whose podcast talks a lot about movies and TV shows and that stuff, and he does a lot of the book reviews for our site.

2019
02:08:43,855 --> 02:08:52,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Critical Myth says, I love the RNC games, but the last two have been less than stellar, so I'm actually hopeful that this will give Insomniac a reason to revitalize the franchise.

2020
02:08:52,881 --> 02:08:56,724
[SPEAKER_06]: But in general terms, I think it always comes down to the creative minds behind the production.

2021
02:08:56,804 --> 02:09:01,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they understand the IP and what a film adaptation can bring to the table that the game itself does not?

2022
02:09:01,927 --> 02:09:04,109
[SPEAKER_06]: And is the game suited to a film-style narrative?

2023
02:09:05,710 --> 02:09:13,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Pete Garuno says, Some game franchises lend themselves very well to film adaptations, even though the execution has pretty much always been awful.

2024
02:09:13,594 --> 02:09:19,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Ratchet & Clank really doesn't strike me as the kind of game that ought to have a film made of it, unless they're really that desperate for money.

2025
02:09:20,438 --> 02:09:26,122
[SPEAKER_06]: And lastly, on Facebook, Andy R says, As a PlayStation fan, I was pretty happy about the news, but I'm concerned as well.

2026
02:09:26,522 --> 02:09:27,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

2027
02:09:46,777 --> 02:09:51,979
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a very interesting comment, and I kind of want to end on that and turn it over to the folks here in the studio.

2028
02:09:52,700 --> 02:10:01,523
[SPEAKER_06]: He theorizes there that if the movie is so bad, it's going to make people go, well, no wonder, because it's a game, and the game probably sucks too.

2029
02:10:01,943 --> 02:10:06,245
[SPEAKER_06]: So can the movies actually do harm to video gaming when they're really terrible?

2030
02:10:07,616 --> 02:10:23,159
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly think it also really depends on the audience too because there's been a lot of really good Japanese adaptations that wouldn't fly over here for the general audience because of that quirkiness that's a part of Japanese game movie versions.

2031
02:10:25,160 --> 02:10:33,002
[SPEAKER_01]: People here want either it to be super cutesy or super gritty, realistic, have an edge to it and I don't really see it.

2032
02:10:33,562 --> 02:10:34,882
[SPEAKER_01]: It would really depend on the IP.

2033
02:10:37,270 --> 02:10:44,073
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, which came first, the Alone in the Dark movie or the Alone in the Dark game by Atari?

2034
02:10:44,793 --> 02:10:45,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, the last one.

2035
02:10:47,094 --> 02:10:48,634
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I don't remember which one hurt what.

2036
02:10:49,575 --> 02:10:51,335
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure Tara Reid, being a scientist, didn't help.

2037
02:10:51,435 --> 02:10:52,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, stop.

2038
02:10:53,636 --> 02:10:55,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Spike, how do you feel about video game movies?

2039
02:10:56,325 --> 02:11:00,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, I think that they're largely, you know, mediocre at best.

2040
02:11:01,248 --> 02:11:09,633
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's kind of telling when you have recent movie games like Prince of Persia and the general perception is still, oh, game movies are getting better.

2041
02:11:11,133 --> 02:11:14,095
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, they're mostly crap, but I don't think they hurt.

2042
02:11:15,336 --> 02:11:19,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, Street Fighter is still a franchise that exists, and that movie was awful.

2043
02:11:19,338 --> 02:11:22,060
[SPEAKER_05]: See also Super Mario Brothers with Bob Hoskins.

2044
02:11:22,140 --> 02:11:22,800
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, hey.

2045
02:11:23,901 --> 02:11:24,641
[SPEAKER_01]: Kylie was in it.

2046
02:11:25,057 --> 02:11:26,578
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it was in Street Fighter, yes.

2047
02:11:27,778 --> 02:11:28,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I thought you meant the Mario movie.

2048
02:11:28,979 --> 02:11:36,642
[SPEAKER_01]: The cast in that Street Fighter movie was actually super... But I feel so bad for dearly departed Raul Julia for that being his last movie.

2049
02:11:37,603 --> 02:11:39,724
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I have seen him in some really crappy movies.

2050
02:11:39,764 --> 02:11:42,285
[SPEAKER_08]: And you guys even forgot that there was another Street Fighter movie.

2051
02:11:42,905 --> 02:11:45,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there was that horrible Chun-Li thing.

2052
02:11:45,588 --> 02:11:45,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh!

2053
02:11:46,549 --> 02:11:53,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't Bison cause harm with psychic powers to a woman in a way that I don't really feel appropriate describing?

2054
02:11:53,297 --> 02:11:54,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know what?

2055
02:11:54,438 --> 02:11:57,001
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't see it, and I don't really want to.

2056
02:11:57,161 --> 02:12:00,425
[SPEAKER_05]: I was really drunk, but I feel like I was offended, and that takes a lot.

2057
02:12:02,004 --> 02:12:05,627
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to stick with the Ties That Bind, best Street Fighter thing that came out.

2058
02:12:06,187 --> 02:12:09,349
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only thing in my universe, the thing that came out with Street Fighter 4.

2059
02:12:10,170 --> 02:12:11,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that was really good.

2060
02:12:11,751 --> 02:12:12,772
[SPEAKER_06]: So Tim, what do you think?

2061
02:12:12,832 --> 02:12:17,835
[SPEAKER_06]: If they end up doing this new Mass Effect movie, do you think it's going to do justice to the games?

2062
02:12:19,016 --> 02:12:20,717
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it'll do justice to the games.

2063
02:12:20,737 --> 02:12:22,158
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it'll be something completely different.

2064
02:12:22,258 --> 02:12:23,299
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be good, it might be bad.

2065
02:12:24,239 --> 02:12:28,282
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, I think video game movies have been pretty hit or miss, but I'm pretty hopeful that...

2066
02:12:28,622 --> 02:12:41,108
[SPEAKER_00]: because I look at something like the comic book industry, which they made a lot of stinker comic book movies, but eventually Hollywood and the comic industry figured out how to do that, and there have been some stellar comic book games.

2067
02:12:41,248 --> 02:12:48,592
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have hope that in the future they sort of solve that problem for games translating over to movies as well.

2068
02:12:48,612 --> 02:12:49,092
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good point.

2069
02:12:49,112 --> 02:12:50,053
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a very good point.

2070
02:12:50,860 --> 02:12:58,783
[SPEAKER_06]: I tend to agree with the other person that talked about how if the right people with the right passion are behind it, it has the potential to do very well.

2071
02:12:59,683 --> 02:13:02,804
[SPEAKER_06]: Which, you know, anything Uwe Boll touched, you're like, oh, girl.

2072
02:13:02,824 --> 02:13:08,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I feel that, I mean, considering this, I'm assuming Sony's going to be publishing the movie.

2073
02:13:09,066 --> 02:13:13,027
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, it's studios that they picked to do these licenses.

2074
02:13:13,207 --> 02:13:14,948
[SPEAKER_08]: I would assume that they're going to be...

2075
02:13:16,228 --> 02:13:24,294
[SPEAKER_08]: up to their standards because I mean it is their properties that they're playing with and I would think that they wouldn't just let anything come to market.

2076
02:13:25,696 --> 02:13:26,036
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

2077
02:13:27,237 --> 02:13:33,742
[SPEAKER_08]: Like they've done like what some tie-ins and stuff with different like EA properties like some anime movies and I don't think those were that bad.

2078
02:13:36,744 --> 02:13:45,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Shane in our chat room who of course has a thing or two to say about Mass Effect says no one can agree with how the Mass Effect movie should be because we all have our different stories and shepherds.

2079
02:13:46,371 --> 02:13:50,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Prince Brightstar says, Frankly, I think Mass Effect will be better as a Saturday morning cartoon.

2080
02:13:50,733 --> 02:13:52,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Picturing the April Fool's 12th.

2081
02:13:52,034 --> 02:13:53,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there was the anime.

2082
02:13:54,055 --> 02:13:54,655
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

2083
02:13:54,835 --> 02:13:56,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, did I tell you I got that?

2084
02:13:56,456 --> 02:13:56,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

2085
02:13:57,397 --> 02:13:57,797
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned.

2086
02:13:57,817 --> 02:13:59,278
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't terrible.

2087
02:14:00,398 --> 02:14:01,259
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

2088
02:14:01,279 --> 02:14:03,079
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate admitting that it wasn't terrible.

2089
02:14:04,260 --> 02:14:13,144
[SPEAKER_01]: The ending of it totally was like, you know all the stuff that they do in Mass Effect 3 that wants to punch you in the gut and make you vomit your feelings?

2090
02:14:13,725 --> 02:14:14,365
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it did that too.

2091
02:14:17,498 --> 02:14:21,840
[SPEAKER_06]: to register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com.

2092
02:14:22,260 --> 02:14:23,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Use the passphrase, yogurt.

2093
02:14:24,862 --> 02:14:26,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do a couple more news stories.

2094
02:14:26,042 --> 02:14:27,643
[SPEAKER_06]: We got listless coming up, but first, Loki.

2095
02:14:28,444 --> 02:14:28,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2096
02:14:29,224 --> 02:14:30,705
[SPEAKER_06]: So... I'm sorry.

2097
02:14:31,005 --> 02:14:34,487
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot to... I always say at the end of the Fugle segment, please read the rest of the answers.

2098
02:14:34,627 --> 02:14:36,388
[SPEAKER_06]: I really skipped a lot tonight because of time.

2099
02:14:36,408 --> 02:14:36,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

2100
02:14:37,088 --> 02:14:39,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or Google Plus.

2101
02:14:39,969 --> 02:14:41,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Search for Orange Lounge Radio.

2102
02:14:41,210 --> 02:14:41,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Loki.

2103
02:14:41,630 --> 02:14:41,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.

2104
02:14:42,150 --> 02:14:44,051
[SPEAKER_08]: So EA has had some more layoffs.

2105
02:14:44,592 --> 02:14:46,853
[SPEAKER_08]: They haven't really said who was laid off.

2106
02:14:47,473 --> 02:15:01,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, I guess there was an internal memo that leaked out, basically saying that at the beginning of their fiscal year, they're cutting some of their operations.

2107
02:15:02,685 --> 02:15:06,928
[SPEAKER_08]: Core marketing functions have been consolidated under their new COO.

2108
02:15:09,430 --> 02:15:11,511
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess they're just restructuring, it looks like.

2109
02:15:12,952 --> 02:15:13,133
[SPEAKER_08]: And...

2110
02:15:15,405 --> 02:15:19,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Also with that, there's a rumor that EA Partners' label is closing.

2111
02:15:19,547 --> 02:15:24,590
[SPEAKER_08]: And that includes all those other developers out there.

2112
02:15:24,610 --> 02:15:25,530
[SPEAKER_08]: They're bringing different titles.

2113
02:15:26,191 --> 02:15:33,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, The Crisis Series, Shadows of the Damned, Alice, The Madness Returns, Bulletstorm, Brutal Legend, and Rock Band.

2114
02:15:34,675 --> 02:15:36,856
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess, I wonder if that would affect Fuse.

2115
02:15:36,876 --> 02:15:39,918
[SPEAKER_08]: But of course, Fuse is just right around the corner, so I'm sure that game will still come out.

2116
02:15:39,998 --> 02:15:44,080
[SPEAKER_08]: But we may see a lot less, I guess...

2117
02:15:46,511 --> 02:15:52,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Not necessarily experimental titles, but titles that aren't positive would do well.

2118
02:15:52,693 --> 02:15:55,254
[SPEAKER_08]: Like new properties like Mirror's Edge or something like that.

2119
02:15:55,955 --> 02:16:01,757
[SPEAKER_08]: Alice thought that would have done okay, but apparently it didn't sell very well in the shadows.

2120
02:16:03,037 --> 02:16:07,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Suda is hard to... It's more niche.

2121
02:16:07,719 --> 02:16:09,220
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm surprised.

2122
02:16:10,220 --> 02:16:13,782
[SPEAKER_08]: And then last but not least, SimCity.

2123
02:16:14,362 --> 02:16:14,542
[SPEAKER_08]: This is

2124
02:16:16,312 --> 02:16:18,332
[SPEAKER_08]: You know there's always bad news when I mention SimCity.

2125
02:16:18,673 --> 02:16:19,373
[SPEAKER_08]: It got a patch!

2126
02:16:19,413 --> 02:16:20,413
[SPEAKER_08]: It fixed some bugs!

2127
02:16:21,113 --> 02:16:24,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Godzilla is attacking the city!

2128
02:16:25,014 --> 02:16:25,254
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

2129
02:16:28,014 --> 02:16:29,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, SimCity 2.0 came out.

2130
02:16:30,835 --> 02:16:35,576
[SPEAKER_08]: It fixed a few bugs and unfortunately created a bunch of other bugs.

2131
02:16:35,656 --> 02:16:36,096
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course.

2132
02:16:37,816 --> 02:16:39,317
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah.

2133
02:16:39,997 --> 02:16:40,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots of weird stuff.

2134
02:16:41,077 --> 02:16:42,977
[SPEAKER_08]: We're pathing problems still.

2135
02:16:43,297 --> 02:16:45,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently the problem was sewage backing up.

2136
02:16:46,438 --> 02:16:49,300
[SPEAKER_08]: So, your towns are literally full of shit now.

2137
02:16:50,761 --> 02:16:52,162
[SPEAKER_08]: All sorts of syncing problems.

2138
02:16:53,183 --> 02:16:59,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they actually have this group of people on Reddit putting together a list of stuff that's wrong with it now.

2139
02:17:01,008 --> 02:17:02,109
[SPEAKER_08]: So that kind of sucks.

2140
02:17:02,889 --> 02:17:04,030
[SPEAKER_08]: It's still a work in progress.

2141
02:17:04,670 --> 02:17:07,652
[SPEAKER_06]: And then falsely accused all the wrong people of making those bugs.

2142
02:17:09,314 --> 02:17:09,734
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess.

2143
02:17:12,307 --> 02:17:13,368
[SPEAKER_06]: No tea, no shade.

2144
02:17:15,569 --> 02:17:18,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anything else you want to share about SimCity?

2145
02:17:20,792 --> 02:17:22,693
[SPEAKER_08]: SimCity 4 apparently is on sale right now.

2146
02:17:22,713 --> 02:17:23,854
[SPEAKER_08]: You can get it for really cheap.

2147
02:17:24,154 --> 02:17:26,615
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you want to play a great SimCity game, there you go.

2148
02:17:27,496 --> 02:17:28,156
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's offline.

2149
02:17:29,977 --> 02:17:31,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on, I think this is fascinating.

2150
02:17:31,858 --> 02:17:33,199
[SPEAKER_06]: A patent that Apple filed in 2009.

2151
02:17:34,940 --> 02:17:40,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, what the patent is all about is that you have a path that you might take in a video game.

2152
02:17:40,621 --> 02:17:48,463
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's interesting, what's fascinating about this is that in the patent filing, they freaking use these mock-ups of Mass Effect screenshots.

2153
02:17:48,543 --> 02:17:54,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, and it even says name, John Shepard, origin, colonist, and like a little mock-up of what they look like and everything.

2154
02:17:54,404 --> 02:17:57,745
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the first thing that made me go, is this like a joke or a troll or a, you know...

2155
02:17:58,465 --> 02:17:58,766
[SPEAKER_06]: L.O.L.

2156
02:17:58,806 --> 02:17:59,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Games Journalism thing?

2157
02:17:59,667 --> 02:18:00,007
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

2158
02:18:00,048 --> 02:18:04,834
[SPEAKER_06]: But since it's floating around out there, I will report on it because I think this is a fascinating idea.

2159
02:18:05,676 --> 02:18:10,042
[SPEAKER_06]: The Patent Office did grant Apple this patent and it was made public.

2160
02:18:11,112 --> 02:18:32,658
[SPEAKER_06]: and it would go like this like let's say you you know in Mass Effect you you make all these different choices or let me take a game that you know Loki would actually play like Walking Dead okay like the Walking Dead games they well the Telltale ones are really good like let's say you go through the Walking Dead games you make your different choices and obviously they have a big impact well the trick about this patent is that at the end

2161
02:18:33,058 --> 02:18:34,842
[SPEAKER_06]: After you've developed your character, played the game.

2162
02:18:34,862 --> 02:18:36,425
[SPEAKER_06]: So imagine you play a game like Walking Dead.

2163
02:18:36,465 --> 02:18:43,939
[SPEAKER_06]: At the end, you can use this system that Apple patented and you get a single issue comic that is

2164
02:18:44,722 --> 02:18:45,162
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.

2165
02:19:04,349 --> 02:19:21,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes Okay, so you get your comic book And Strip Mine Planets And DarkSakura presents Shakerian Sunday And it's something she can get on her iPad and read it And it's like, oh, it's me and my Garrus I am not that bad Are you sure?

2166
02:19:22,121 --> 02:19:29,645
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have the Moe pillow But you thought about it No, I didn't Did you see how expensive it was?

2167
02:19:32,734 --> 02:19:33,897
[SPEAKER_06]: I love how that was the reason.

2168
02:19:33,917 --> 02:19:34,439
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at me!

2169
02:19:35,101 --> 02:19:35,863
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the reason.

2170
02:19:36,183 --> 02:19:37,888
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have money for a pillow!

2171
02:19:39,733 --> 02:19:41,117
[SPEAKER_01]: And besides, I didn't really care for the art that much.

2172
02:19:42,656 --> 02:19:47,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2173
02:20:07,341 --> 02:20:09,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Bobby was talking about something like that on the show tonight.

2174
02:20:09,483 --> 02:20:15,347
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss those, but I used to skip to the end to see what the best... Because there's only like one path that's... Right.

2175
02:20:17,708 --> 02:20:20,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Where you don't sneeze horrifically in the middle of a show.

2176
02:20:21,311 --> 02:20:21,611
[SPEAKER_06]: Twice.

2177
02:20:25,313 --> 02:20:25,994
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

2178
02:20:27,235 --> 02:20:28,696
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't laugh at me making squeaky noises.

2179
02:20:28,716 --> 02:20:30,337
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that was like the cutest sound I've ever heard.

2180
02:20:30,357 --> 02:20:30,877
[SPEAKER_06]: That was cute.

2181
02:20:31,918 --> 02:20:33,619
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm allergic to Papa Murphy's, I think.

2182
02:20:34,119 --> 02:20:35,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Garris would approve of your cute sneezes.

2183
02:20:36,041 --> 02:20:36,321
[SPEAKER_01]: No!

2184
02:20:36,341 --> 02:20:36,381
[SPEAKER_01]: No!

2185
02:20:39,622 --> 02:20:41,003
[SPEAKER_06]: What were you going to say about the Vanity Books?

2186
02:20:41,123 --> 02:20:41,663
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget.

2187
02:20:41,683 --> 02:20:42,064
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2188
02:20:43,825 --> 02:20:44,445
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you.

2189
02:20:44,525 --> 02:20:44,865
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

2190
02:20:45,666 --> 02:20:47,747
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2191
02:20:48,127 --> 02:20:49,088
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a good idea.

2192
02:20:49,268 --> 02:21:05,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the Vanity Books is a really good comparison, but in this day and age where you just crank it all out digitally into a 99-cent PDF or something, I think it's a great, like, as corny as this is going to sound, it would be a great memory of your gaming experience.

2193
02:21:05,765 --> 02:21:35,207
[SPEAKER_06]: because like you know a game like Mass Effect you know again I hate to keep using this as an example but it's such a good example it takes like 40 hours to play through Mass Effect and then maybe you're sitting here for two years waiting for the sequel to come out well wouldn't it be great if instead of having to replay that 40 hour game like to kind of refresh yourself oh let me read my little comic that I had generated at the end and remember about my character and my choices people do that anyway it's called fan fiction it's called Tumblr it's called Tumblr yeah no no no you're actually that's a pretty accurate statement it's called Tumblr

2194
02:21:36,522 --> 02:21:37,984
[SPEAKER_06]: So did Apple try to patent Tumblr?

2195
02:21:38,024 --> 02:21:38,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what we're saying?

2196
02:21:40,247 --> 02:21:42,029
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2197
02:21:42,269 --> 02:21:44,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to something that's going to need a patent here.

2198
02:21:44,812 --> 02:21:47,055
[SPEAKER_06]: It's tonight's Listless.

2199
02:21:55,233 --> 02:21:59,576
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, for those of you guys that have never been here for Listless before, let me tell you how it works.

2200
02:22:00,056 --> 02:22:07,100
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to go around, oh, well first the point of this whole thing is that we are going to come up with the definitive list.

2201
02:22:07,521 --> 02:22:08,961
[SPEAKER_06]: No arguments, no exceptions.

2202
02:22:09,062 --> 02:22:14,865
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to solve a great question in gaming right now with this highly scientific process.

2203
02:22:14,885 --> 02:22:17,427
[SPEAKER_06]: And the way it's going to work, we are going to all go around the room.

2204
02:22:17,447 --> 02:22:19,568
[SPEAKER_06]: There's five of us tonight, so it's like a Super Listless.

2205
02:22:20,068 --> 02:22:20,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Mario Listless.

2206
02:22:21,449 --> 02:22:26,391
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to go around the room tonight and each of us are going to name three things for the list.

2207
02:22:26,411 --> 02:22:27,592
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to nominate them for the list.

2208
02:22:27,912 --> 02:22:34,715
[SPEAKER_06]: But then the exciting part, we go around the room and each person will strike one item that is not worthy of the list.

2209
02:22:35,095 --> 02:22:43,919
[SPEAKER_06]: And remember our new twist as of the last time we did this, should a host have two of their items eliminated from the list, the third item gets immunity.

2210
02:22:44,239 --> 02:22:47,561
[SPEAKER_06]: So that way it does not like a person's entire list doesn't get eliminated.

2211
02:22:48,141 --> 02:23:08,352
[SPEAKER_06]: so uh and then the chat room will vote on their top and we will get the one two and three the definitive list so here it is chatters if you want to help out tonight start yelling your answers in chat now the topic tonight mascot we most want to gift to Sega on behalf of OLR earlier in the show we talked about Sega

2212
02:23:09,392 --> 02:23:12,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Sega is looking for your mascot in a nutshell.

2213
02:23:12,635 --> 02:23:18,840
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm really cutting corners here, but they're looking for your mascot ideas and they could use them in a future press conference.

2214
02:23:19,140 --> 02:23:22,343
[SPEAKER_06]: So we want to give them something on behalf of OLR and VOG and all that.

2215
02:23:22,763 --> 02:23:23,383
[SPEAKER_06]: So here we go.

2216
02:23:24,544 --> 02:23:30,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Going around the room and giving our list of the mascots we'd most like to see.

2217
02:23:31,227 --> 02:23:34,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Ladies first, DarkSakura, your number three answer tonight.

2218
02:23:34,708 --> 02:23:37,709
[SPEAKER_06]: What mascot would you most like to gift Sega?

2219
02:23:38,650 --> 02:23:40,250
[SPEAKER_01]: Master System, the Sega robot.

2220
02:23:44,692 --> 02:23:46,773
[SPEAKER_06]: And what would Master System, the Sega robot be?

2221
02:23:48,068 --> 02:23:52,092
[SPEAKER_01]: He'd be a cute robot, but he wouldn't be like MechaSonic because that would be too derivative.

2222
02:23:52,512 --> 02:23:58,537
[SPEAKER_01]: He'd just be a cute little chibi robot or maybe powerful like one of the Robo-Alessed robots.

2223
02:23:59,197 --> 02:24:01,219
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Robo-Alessed needs more love.

2224
02:24:01,239 --> 02:24:02,079
[SPEAKER_01]: That game was awesome.

2225
02:24:02,099 --> 02:24:02,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Shut up.

2226
02:24:03,601 --> 02:24:04,261
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm with you on that.

2227
02:24:04,301 --> 02:24:05,842
[SPEAKER_01]: But his name would be Master System.

2228
02:24:07,083 --> 02:24:08,725
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the Master System, hello.

2229
02:24:10,066 --> 02:24:10,386
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2230
02:24:11,387 --> 02:24:12,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go around.

2231
02:24:12,427 --> 02:24:15,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, how about your number three answer tonight for the list?

2232
02:24:15,550 --> 02:24:15,950
[SPEAKER_06]: That's easy.

2233
02:24:16,010 --> 02:24:16,551
[SPEAKER_06]: President Cat.

2234
02:24:18,922 --> 02:24:19,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

2235
02:24:19,122 --> 02:24:20,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's President Cat.

2236
02:24:20,823 --> 02:24:23,364
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a very OLR thing and it's being shouted by a lot of people in chat.

2237
02:24:23,384 --> 02:24:25,845
[SPEAKER_01]: So President Cat... I thought we had to pick something original.

2238
02:24:26,446 --> 02:24:27,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Not necessarily.

2239
02:24:27,186 --> 02:24:30,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, who said President Cat has to be that same President Cat?

2240
02:24:31,068 --> 02:24:34,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Since clearly that game company didn't give a fuck about our idea.

2241
02:24:37,171 --> 02:24:39,993
[SPEAKER_06]: And you might remember the translation was something like, what, Boss Cat?

2242
02:24:40,033 --> 02:24:41,033
[SPEAKER_06]: We said President Cat.

2243
02:24:41,093 --> 02:24:43,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Sukibon is like a female delinquent.

2244
02:24:43,794 --> 02:24:45,395
[SPEAKER_01]: And Shacho is like a company president.

2245
02:24:45,415 --> 02:24:47,016
[SPEAKER_06]: You're like a female delinquent.

2246
02:24:48,117 --> 02:24:48,657
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what, Rob...

2247
02:24:49,929 --> 02:24:50,129
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

2248
02:24:50,450 --> 02:24:51,791
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna hit you in the face with a yo-yo.

2249
02:24:52,892 --> 02:24:55,555
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only people who'd get that are people who actually saw Suki Bandeka.

2250
02:24:59,360 --> 02:25:02,243
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, um... SSJ100 Matt had a really good suggestion.

2251
02:25:03,325 --> 02:25:06,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Dickie the Pen Dickie the Pen is awesome

2252
02:25:32,847 --> 02:25:33,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Get it?

2253
02:25:33,247 --> 02:25:35,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Dickie the Pen is awesome.

2254
02:25:36,730 --> 02:25:38,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Just think about that one for a little bit.

2255
02:25:38,812 --> 02:25:38,992
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2256
02:25:39,032 --> 02:25:41,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Spike, who's over there frowning at my answer.

2257
02:25:42,795 --> 02:25:46,638
[SPEAKER_06]: What is your number three answer for the list of mascot you'd like to gift to Sega?

2258
02:25:46,838 --> 02:25:50,761
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to gift to Sega Rob Roberts in a Bjork swan dress.

2259
02:25:51,442 --> 02:25:55,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2260
02:25:55,425 --> 02:25:57,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I have to sing like her?

2261
02:25:57,367 --> 02:25:58,688
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have the egg purse too.

2262
02:26:00,783 --> 02:26:09,426
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel so bad for your listeners.

2263
02:26:11,127 --> 02:26:12,287
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just singing Bjork.

2264
02:26:16,329 --> 02:26:16,629
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2265
02:26:17,309 --> 02:26:21,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Lastly, but not leastly, with the number three item for the list tonight, Tim, what is your contribution to the list?

2266
02:26:22,151 --> 02:26:29,194
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, since I think that crowdsourcing a new mascot is kind of sad, I think a good mascot for them would be a 32X with a frowny face.

2267
02:26:32,793 --> 02:26:36,296
[SPEAKER_05]: So a regular 32X.

2268
02:26:36,356 --> 02:26:38,277
[SPEAKER_06]: A 32X with a frown face.

2269
02:26:39,037 --> 02:26:39,418
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2270
02:26:39,978 --> 02:26:41,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to the number two answers.

2271
02:26:41,579 --> 02:26:41,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie.

2272
02:26:42,019 --> 02:26:44,021
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, keep in mind, I'm not doing mine in any particular order.

2273
02:26:44,041 --> 02:26:45,342
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just doing them the order I want to list them in.

2274
02:26:45,642 --> 02:26:45,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Fine.

2275
02:26:46,182 --> 02:26:47,503
[SPEAKER_01]: Segata Sanshiro II.

2276
02:26:50,005 --> 02:26:51,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody in chat said that earlier, I think.

2277
02:26:51,969 --> 02:26:58,333
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but they actually said Segata Sanshiro, but since I'm being original, Segata Sanshiro the second.

2278
02:26:58,993 --> 02:27:00,934
[SPEAKER_01]: It's A-T-A.

2279
02:27:01,554 --> 02:27:04,436
[SPEAKER_01]: Segata Sanshiro the second.

2280
02:27:04,876 --> 02:27:10,259
[SPEAKER_01]: And if no one's seen it, look up the Segata Sanshiro videos after the show.

2281
02:27:12,521 --> 02:27:13,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, your number two answer tonight.

2282
02:27:14,181 --> 02:27:14,862
[SPEAKER_06]: A forklift.

2283
02:27:21,525 --> 02:27:23,914
[SPEAKER_06]: And why would their mascot be a forklift?

2284
02:27:23,934 --> 02:27:25,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you not play Shenmue?

2285
02:27:25,781 --> 02:27:26,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay, I get it.

2286
02:27:26,825 --> 02:27:27,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2287
02:27:33,301 --> 02:27:38,823
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought there was going to be a joke there about moving things into the warehouse, but alright, fine.

2288
02:27:39,583 --> 02:27:40,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever, however you want to take it.

2289
02:27:41,784 --> 02:27:43,164
[SPEAKER_06]: It's funny in multiple formats.

2290
02:27:43,325 --> 02:27:46,266
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the joke was how you didn't get it.

2291
02:27:46,746 --> 02:27:50,447
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, my brain didn't instantly think of Shenmue out of all the video games in the world.

2292
02:27:50,507 --> 02:27:52,268
[SPEAKER_06]: It should always think of Shenmue.

2293
02:27:53,627 --> 02:27:55,188
[SPEAKER_06]: I approve, but you're awful

2294
02:28:16,768 --> 02:28:18,430
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a long-running OLR joke, Spike.

2295
02:28:18,470 --> 02:28:19,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Just smile and nod.

2296
02:28:19,671 --> 02:28:19,911
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2297
02:28:19,951 --> 02:28:23,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Non-Sylon Occupy Caprica from SSJ100MAD is my number two answer for the list.

2298
02:28:24,975 --> 02:28:26,976
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Captain Spike, what is your number two answer for the list?

2299
02:28:27,196 --> 02:28:33,301
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know your memes or anything, so I'm just going to go with Dark Sakura in a sailor suit.

2300
02:28:35,202 --> 02:28:36,103
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I at least have a gun?

2301
02:28:38,204 --> 02:28:38,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

2302
02:28:38,885 --> 02:28:39,746
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay!

2303
02:28:40,106 --> 02:28:42,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark Sakura in a sailor suit and a gun.

2304
02:28:42,848 --> 02:28:43,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

2305
02:28:43,408 --> 02:28:43,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

2306
02:28:45,560 --> 02:28:46,360
[SPEAKER_06]: because look at her.

2307
02:28:46,401 --> 02:28:47,421
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be badass.

2308
02:28:47,761 --> 02:28:48,842
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was a Duffy thing.

2309
02:28:49,002 --> 02:28:49,903
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, you know what?

2310
02:28:50,663 --> 02:28:51,564
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Duffy!

2311
02:28:51,624 --> 02:28:52,924
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was because Duffy wore a sailor.

2312
02:28:53,285 --> 02:28:53,385
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh!

2313
02:28:53,745 --> 02:28:54,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sure!

2314
02:28:54,625 --> 02:28:57,427
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, when you don't get my references, that's okay.

2315
02:28:57,727 --> 02:29:00,349
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't get your references and that's a crime against gaming.

2316
02:29:01,429 --> 02:29:01,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

2317
02:29:02,190 --> 02:29:06,292
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, little factoid, my very first cosplay ever was Sailor Venus.

2318
02:29:06,933 --> 02:29:07,573
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.

2319
02:29:08,786 --> 02:29:10,047
[SPEAKER_01]: This skirt was way too short.

2320
02:29:11,968 --> 02:29:12,349
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2321
02:29:13,350 --> 02:29:14,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to Spike.

2322
02:29:14,270 --> 02:29:16,212
[SPEAKER_01]: In the name of the moon, I will fuck you up.

2323
02:29:16,432 --> 02:29:18,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to Tim's number two answer.

2324
02:29:19,074 --> 02:29:20,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Tim, what is your number two answer for the list?

2325
02:29:20,695 --> 02:29:23,618
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually really similar to Spike's, and we did not plan it that way.

2326
02:29:23,738 --> 02:29:29,102
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was all three OLR hosts doing Bayonetta cosplay.

2327
02:29:30,063 --> 02:29:30,823
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have that much hair.

2328
02:29:31,884 --> 02:29:32,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Can Loki be Jaune?

2329
02:29:34,759 --> 02:29:35,419
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Loki can be Jon.

2330
02:29:35,439 --> 02:29:36,499
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob has to be the other witch.

2331
02:29:36,779 --> 02:29:37,160
[SPEAKER_01]: What was her?

2332
02:29:38,280 --> 02:29:38,740
[SPEAKER_05]: That was Jon.

2333
02:29:38,780 --> 02:29:39,260
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no.

2334
02:29:39,760 --> 02:29:40,600
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be Joe Pesci.

2335
02:29:40,640 --> 02:29:41,280
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob has to be.

2336
02:29:42,181 --> 02:29:43,061
[SPEAKER_01]: He can be the little girl.

2337
02:29:43,481 --> 02:29:45,001
[SPEAKER_01]: The little young virgin.

2338
02:29:45,281 --> 02:29:47,322
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I will not be a little girl.

2339
02:29:47,542 --> 02:29:48,062
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not you.

2340
02:29:48,102 --> 02:29:48,802
[SPEAKER_01]: You be Jon.

2341
02:29:48,922 --> 02:29:50,182
[SPEAKER_01]: He be the little girl.

2342
02:29:50,342 --> 02:29:51,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I'm sexy, right?

2343
02:29:52,003 --> 02:29:52,363
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess.

2344
02:29:53,403 --> 02:29:54,403
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be wearing a breastplate.

2345
02:29:55,104 --> 02:29:55,864
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't say yes.

2346
02:29:55,944 --> 02:29:56,904
[SPEAKER_01]: I just said I guess.

2347
02:29:57,751 --> 02:29:58,031
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2348
02:29:58,651 --> 02:30:01,473
[SPEAKER_06]: So far, the list of mascots we will gift to Sega.

2349
02:30:02,053 --> 02:30:18,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Master System the Sega Robot, President Cat, Dickie the Pen, Rob Roberts in a Bjork swan dress, 32X with a frowny face, Segata Senshiro II, a forklift, non-Sylon-occupied Caprica, Dark Sakura in a sailor suit, and a gun.

2350
02:30:19,041 --> 02:30:21,202
[SPEAKER_06]: All OLR hosts in Bayonetta cosplay.

2351
02:30:21,242 --> 02:30:22,062
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the worst list ever.

2352
02:30:22,082 --> 02:30:23,323
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I'm already wearing the glasses.

2353
02:30:23,463 --> 02:30:23,803
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

2354
02:30:23,963 --> 02:30:26,805
[SPEAKER_01]: I just like how everyone assumed I would be Bayonetta, so thank you.

2355
02:30:28,826 --> 02:30:31,269
[SPEAKER_01]: The only way I would wear high heels is if they had guns on them.

2356
02:30:32,070 --> 02:30:35,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Number one answers for the list.

2357
02:30:35,153 --> 02:30:36,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.

2358
02:30:37,336 --> 02:30:37,856
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.

2359
02:30:38,257 --> 02:30:41,320
[SPEAKER_01]: Opa Opa's retarded cousin Opi Opi that looks like a huge boom.

2360
02:30:43,482 --> 02:30:44,984
[SPEAKER_05]: That was oddly specific.

2361
02:30:46,893 --> 02:31:15,136
[SPEAKER_01]: OPI is boob in Japanese so it would be I won't use the R word in the answer I will say OPA OPA's OPI huge boob cousin it's OPP AI by the way OPI OPI OPI yeah instead of OPA OPA because we all know that Fantasy Zone is awesome okay there we go Loki your number one answer ooh la la

2362
02:31:17,034 --> 02:31:19,535
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll put it, but it's getting taken down.

2363
02:31:43,718 --> 02:31:44,378
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Rob.

2364
02:31:45,119 --> 02:31:46,279
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm already taking down one of yours.

2365
02:31:46,760 --> 02:31:47,920
[SPEAKER_08]: Fine, fine.

2366
02:31:48,100 --> 02:31:55,044
[SPEAKER_08]: If I can't have that, you know, if we're gonna, we're gonna make, I'm gonna, instead of like a game character, I want a game to be an actual, you know, thing.

2367
02:31:55,224 --> 02:31:55,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Fine.

2368
02:31:55,724 --> 02:31:56,945
[SPEAKER_08]: The Japanese table flipping game.

2369
02:31:57,305 --> 02:31:57,945
[SPEAKER_08]: The arcade game.

2370
02:31:58,525 --> 02:32:01,327
[SPEAKER_08]: That should be the, it should just be a big table being flipped over.

2371
02:32:01,507 --> 02:32:02,147
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you played that?

2372
02:32:02,187 --> 02:32:02,908
[SPEAKER_08]: It's awesome.

2373
02:32:03,008 --> 02:32:03,828
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I want to play it.

2374
02:32:03,848 --> 02:32:04,648
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks awesome.

2375
02:32:04,788 --> 02:32:07,130
[SPEAKER_06]: That emote icon could just be their new mascot.

2376
02:32:07,170 --> 02:32:09,251
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Chiggers Forever for saying De Medna.

2377
02:32:11,471 --> 02:32:13,172
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, my puppets!

2378
02:32:13,772 --> 02:32:16,273
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you heard about my blast processing?

2379
02:32:19,334 --> 02:32:19,754
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.

2380
02:32:19,874 --> 02:32:26,196
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to redo the Pandaren meme and have it say blast processing.

2381
02:32:26,256 --> 02:32:27,757
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm stealing X to first meme.

2382
02:32:27,777 --> 02:32:31,398
[SPEAKER_06]: The sad thing is like 98% of the audience just isn't going to understand.

2383
02:32:32,919 --> 02:32:34,939
[SPEAKER_06]: But for the 2% that do, you're welcome.

2384
02:32:35,019 --> 02:32:35,320
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

2385
02:32:35,340 --> 02:32:35,800
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do it for us.

2386
02:32:35,940 --> 02:32:36,200
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2387
02:32:37,240 --> 02:32:39,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Captain Spike, your number one answer.

2388
02:32:40,512 --> 02:32:43,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I've done one for Rob and I've done one for DarkSakura.

2389
02:32:43,893 --> 02:32:48,254
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to go with Loki in a banana hammock with a giant purple dildo bat.

2390
02:32:51,915 --> 02:32:54,675
[SPEAKER_07]: You should have just done as Tingle.

2391
02:32:56,456 --> 02:32:57,616
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, Loki.

2392
02:32:57,656 --> 02:32:58,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Tingle's old.

2393
02:32:58,496 --> 02:33:00,597
[SPEAKER_06]: You were the one that wanted to get past Tingle.

2394
02:33:00,677 --> 02:33:05,278
[SPEAKER_06]: So Loki in a banana hammock with a purple dildo bat is on the list.

2395
02:33:05,598 --> 02:33:06,758
[SPEAKER_01]: SSJ100 not suggested Betty White.

2396
02:33:06,778 --> 02:33:06,899
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

2397
02:33:10,069 --> 02:33:12,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, one more.

2398
02:33:14,376 --> 02:33:17,340
[SPEAKER_06]: One more here from Tim to add to the list.

2399
02:33:17,461 --> 02:33:18,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Last chance to get something on the list.

2400
02:33:18,843 --> 02:33:20,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh wait, no, I didn't do my number one, did I?

2401
02:33:20,085 --> 02:33:20,766
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you didn't.

2402
02:33:20,786 --> 02:33:21,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, shit.

2403
02:33:21,407 --> 02:33:22,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, then my number one answer...

2404
02:33:23,957 --> 02:33:34,121
[SPEAKER_06]: My number one answer would be, now, my number one answer is inspired by the fact, I don't know if you guys know this, but in San Francisco, in the Sega building, they're no longer there in the Sega building, you know what company moved in in their place?

2405
02:33:35,481 --> 02:33:36,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Was Zynga.

2406
02:33:36,842 --> 02:33:42,243
[SPEAKER_06]: So my number one answer mascot is Zeke the Zynga Killer, and he's a coyote that eats dogs.

2407
02:33:44,404 --> 02:33:46,405
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a horrible person, Rob, I approve.

2408
02:33:46,425 --> 02:33:48,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, he only eats Zynga dogs, don't worry.

2409
02:33:48,185 --> 02:33:49,806
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, well then he can eat the Zynga dog.

2410
02:33:52,799 --> 02:33:54,660
[SPEAKER_06]: My number one answer is Zeke the Zynga Killer.

2411
02:33:54,720 --> 02:33:58,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, last but not leastly, Tim, your number one answer.

2412
02:33:58,923 --> 02:34:04,507
[SPEAKER_00]: My number one answer is a terrifying amalgamation of all of Sonic's shitty friends.

2413
02:34:08,790 --> 02:34:18,156
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some vaguely Sonic-shaped character that's pink like the girl, Amy, and has knuckles as hands and a gun.

2414
02:34:19,117 --> 02:34:20,858
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would be the Sonic Gestalt?

2415
02:34:21,451 --> 02:34:22,611
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Sonic Gestalt.

2416
02:34:22,671 --> 02:34:22,991
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

2417
02:34:23,451 --> 02:34:23,712
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

2418
02:34:23,912 --> 02:34:26,452
[SPEAKER_01]: But it would have to be called SBO because that was the weirdest name.

2419
02:34:26,592 --> 02:34:26,872
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2420
02:34:26,932 --> 02:34:27,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, guys.

2421
02:34:27,472 --> 02:34:29,213
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a highly scientific process.

2422
02:34:29,253 --> 02:34:30,073
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to run down the list.

2423
02:34:30,113 --> 02:34:32,654
[SPEAKER_06]: But here's some items that didn't make the list from chat.

2424
02:34:32,714 --> 02:34:33,714
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really surprised at some of these.

2425
02:34:34,054 --> 02:34:37,055
[SPEAKER_06]: SJ100 Matt, the giggling lesbians didn't make the list tonight.

2426
02:34:37,915 --> 02:34:39,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Chigger said Dame Edna, which we said.

2427
02:34:41,876 --> 02:34:43,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Who was talking about the singer from D-Lite?

2428
02:34:44,837 --> 02:34:47,317
[SPEAKER_01]: It was when he brought up Ooh La La.

2429
02:34:47,397 --> 02:34:48,878
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole lawsuit and everything like that.

2430
02:34:49,038 --> 02:34:50,298
[SPEAKER_01]: Lady Miss Keira Kirby.

2431
02:34:51,138 --> 02:34:51,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

2432
02:34:52,699 --> 02:34:53,619
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd vote for Bootsy Collins.

2433
02:34:53,659 --> 02:34:54,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody said ferret.

2434
02:34:55,060 --> 02:34:56,280
[SPEAKER_06]: That surprised me as well.

2435
02:34:59,001 --> 02:34:59,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

2436
02:34:59,381 --> 02:34:59,961
[SPEAKER_06]: What else did we say?

2437
02:35:00,061 --> 02:35:02,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Peep the Peep Jouster, says S. Jonah and Matt.

2438
02:35:02,982 --> 02:35:05,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Needs more rappy, says Prince Brightstar.

2439
02:35:05,984 --> 02:35:08,965
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't name a ferret because we respect the ferret too much.

2440
02:35:10,305 --> 02:35:12,446
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, but guys, this list is too big.

2441
02:35:12,867 --> 02:35:14,448
[SPEAKER_06]: It's time to thin it down a little bit.

2442
02:35:14,508 --> 02:35:16,729
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have to go around the list.

2443
02:35:16,769 --> 02:35:20,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Since there's so many people, please let me know if you got two of your items eliminated because I don't know who said what at this point.

2444
02:35:21,152 --> 02:35:23,473
[SPEAKER_06]: So let me run down the list and we will start eliminating.

2445
02:35:23,533 --> 02:35:23,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.

2446
02:35:24,654 --> 02:35:34,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Master System the Sega Robot, President Cat, Dickie the Pen, Rob Roberts in a Bjork swan dress, a 32X with a frowny face.

2447
02:35:34,820 --> 02:35:58,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Segata Senshiro II, A Forklift, Non-Silent Occupied Caprica, DarkSakura in a Sailor Suit and a Gun, All OLR Hosts in Bayonetta Cosplay, Opa Opa's Opai Opai Huge Boob Cousin, Table Flipping Arcade Game, Loki in a Banana Hammock with a Purple Dildo Back, Zeke the Zynga Killer, and an Amalgamation of All of Sonic's Shitty Friends.

2448
02:35:59,633 --> 02:36:01,334
[SPEAKER_06]: However, this list is too big.

2449
02:36:01,454 --> 02:36:03,995
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, which of these is not worthy of the list?

2450
02:36:04,747 --> 02:36:07,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because it's old and played out.

2451
02:36:08,089 --> 02:36:10,150
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye-bye non-silent occupied Caprica.

2452
02:36:10,870 --> 02:36:12,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Non-silent occupied Caprica.

2453
02:36:12,631 --> 02:36:13,711
[SPEAKER_06]: It has been stricken from the list.

2454
02:36:13,752 --> 02:36:15,572
[SPEAKER_01]: It might have stayed if it was a bottle of Propel.

2455
02:36:17,033 --> 02:36:18,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?

2456
02:36:19,114 --> 02:36:20,915
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think anyone wants to see me in a banana hammock.

2457
02:36:23,507 --> 02:36:24,508
[SPEAKER_06]: I knew that was happening.

2458
02:36:24,628 --> 02:36:26,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki in a banana hammock with a purple dildo bat.

2459
02:36:26,750 --> 02:36:28,031
[SPEAKER_06]: It has been stricken from the list.

2460
02:36:28,731 --> 02:36:29,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Spike.

2461
02:36:29,712 --> 02:36:29,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wait.

2462
02:36:29,952 --> 02:36:30,573
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'll go next.

2463
02:36:31,093 --> 02:36:31,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Me.

2464
02:36:31,393 --> 02:36:32,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Which one am I going to strike from the list?

2465
02:36:34,416 --> 02:36:41,161
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, DarkSakura, but I'm going to remove Segata Senshiro II because, you know what?

2466
02:36:41,341 --> 02:36:43,964
[SPEAKER_06]: A copy of something that's already out there is too easy.

2467
02:36:44,144 --> 02:36:44,564
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's right.

2468
02:36:44,584 --> 02:36:46,406
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be too much awesome for the universe.

2469
02:36:46,426 --> 02:36:49,128
[SPEAKER_05]: But then who are they going to base Segagaga 2 off of?

2470
02:36:50,242 --> 02:36:50,582
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

2471
02:36:50,982 --> 02:36:53,784
[SPEAKER_01]: Why didn't we not have... Except it would be nothing but bad decisions.

2472
02:36:53,804 --> 02:36:55,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, not my problem.

2473
02:36:55,124 --> 02:36:56,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, hey, kids, not my problem.

2474
02:36:57,045 --> 02:36:58,306
[SPEAKER_06]: It has been stricken from the list.

2475
02:36:59,346 --> 02:37:01,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Spike, which of these is not worthy of the list?

2476
02:37:01,567 --> 02:37:04,909
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't understand Dickie the Pen, and so I don't wish to see it.

2477
02:37:05,889 --> 02:37:06,350
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2478
02:37:06,630 --> 02:37:07,550
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what we should have said?

2479
02:37:08,190 --> 02:37:08,871
[SPEAKER_01]: We should have said...

2480
02:37:11,202 --> 02:37:11,823
[SPEAKER_01]: I just forgot it.

2481
02:37:11,983 --> 02:37:12,384
[SPEAKER_01]: Never mind.

2482
02:37:27,497 --> 02:37:28,938
[SPEAKER_00]: am I allowed to eliminate one of my own?

2483
02:37:29,418 --> 02:37:54,348
[SPEAKER_06]: yes you can if you must 32x with a frowny face is super depressing a 32x with a frowny face Tim has decided you know what I'm not feeling it anymore I would rather see an amalgamation of all of Sonic's shitty friends so it has been stricken from the list it should have the little quote bubble that says kill me I remember what it is I remember what the suggestion that we should have done was Pepsi Man Pepsi Man

2484
02:37:56,261 --> 02:38:00,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright guys, that means it is time to vote in tonight's list list.

2485
02:38:00,704 --> 02:38:03,486
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to paste the list here in chat right now.

2486
02:38:03,927 --> 02:38:08,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Send your number one and your number two answers via private message to Rob Roberts.

2487
02:38:09,030 --> 02:38:10,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Here it is, your choices tonight.

2488
02:38:10,712 --> 02:38:13,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Master System, the Sega Robot, President Cat,

2489
02:38:13,954 --> 02:38:15,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob Robertson and Bjork Swandress.

2490
02:38:15,775 --> 02:38:16,436
[SPEAKER_03]: That stayed.

2491
02:38:17,797 --> 02:38:18,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2492
02:38:18,858 --> 02:38:22,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Forklift, DarkSakura in a sailor suit and a gun.

2493
02:38:22,801 --> 02:38:24,962
[SPEAKER_06]: All OLR hosts and Bayonetta cosplay.

2494
02:38:25,623 --> 02:38:26,403
[SPEAKER_06]: That stayed.

2495
02:38:26,884 --> 02:38:27,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2496
02:38:27,944 --> 02:38:29,325
[SPEAKER_08]: I can only eliminate one.

2497
02:38:30,246 --> 02:38:39,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Opa Opa's Opai Opai Huge Boob Cousin, Table Flipping Arcade Game, Zeke the Zynga Killer, and an amalgamation of all of Sonic's shitty friends.

2498
02:38:40,416 --> 02:38:45,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Send your votes via private message to Rob Roberts with your number one and your number two answers.

2499
02:38:45,741 --> 02:38:52,367
[SPEAKER_06]: And to answer that question I see in chat right now from VSJSXV, why aren't we using the VOGnetwork.com poll for this?

2500
02:38:52,827 --> 02:38:55,249
[SPEAKER_06]: All I'm going to say is, soon.

2501
02:38:56,671 --> 02:38:57,251
[SPEAKER_06]: but not tonight.

2502
02:38:58,032 --> 02:39:01,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so send those votes in right now.

2503
02:39:01,797 --> 02:39:04,139
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to tally them up and we'll let you know a little later in the show.

2504
02:39:04,199 --> 02:39:09,465
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, SSJ100 Matt, I don't think that Konami would want to let go of their awesome lion to Sega.

2505
02:39:11,047 --> 02:39:11,307
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2506
02:39:12,347 --> 02:39:15,268
[SPEAKER_06]: While I tally up those votes, I think we're going to take a... Dude, I miss Pepsi, man.

2507
02:39:15,288 --> 02:39:17,249
[SPEAKER_01]: Those commercials were hilarious.

2508
02:39:17,549 --> 02:39:17,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2509
02:39:18,329 --> 02:39:18,509
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2510
02:39:18,529 --> 02:39:20,830
[SPEAKER_06]: While I tally up those votes, we're going to take a trip to the mailbag.

2511
02:39:21,310 --> 02:39:21,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, fuck.

2512
02:39:22,130 --> 02:39:31,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Every week, you guys send us emails to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, and Dark Sakura respectfully opens up the email bag every week and dives in... What the hell is this shit?

2513
02:39:31,653 --> 02:39:34,534
[SPEAKER_06]: ...and picks out some of her favorite emails to read.

2514
02:39:34,934 --> 02:39:35,794
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all sticky.

2515
02:39:36,635 --> 02:39:37,655
[SPEAKER_06]: At least it's not powdery.

2516
02:39:38,075 --> 02:39:40,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark Sakura, what emails are you going to read tonight?

2517
02:39:41,405 --> 02:39:43,046
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I approve of how this one started.

2518
02:39:43,106 --> 02:39:44,066
[SPEAKER_01]: It's from Degenerate Johnny.

2519
02:39:44,726 --> 02:39:46,667
[SPEAKER_01]: Greetings and salutations.

2520
02:39:46,987 --> 02:39:49,628
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I have to do the Christian Slater voice from Heathers.

2521
02:39:50,948 --> 02:39:52,789
[SPEAKER_01]: Greetings and salutations, O Alarmy.

2522
02:39:52,869 --> 02:39:54,449
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the one and only Degenerate Johnny.

2523
02:39:54,930 --> 02:39:59,171
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to email you about last week's show pertaining to the lack of strong female lead characters in video games.

2524
02:39:59,591 --> 02:40:05,073
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if you've had the chance to watch Anita Sarkisian's... I know I pronounced that wrong.

2525
02:40:05,593 --> 02:40:08,654
[SPEAKER_01]: Kickstarter video discussing the damsel in distress trope in games.

2526
02:40:09,054 --> 02:40:10,435
[SPEAKER_01]: But it mentions the same topic.

2527
02:40:10,655 --> 02:40:12,895
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have not, I'm sure someone will post a link in chat.

2528
02:40:13,956 --> 02:40:20,558
[SPEAKER_01]: While I do agree that feminism is moving at a snail's pace, the lack of diversity is becoming less common than it was ten years ago.

2529
02:40:20,958 --> 02:40:29,261
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we see three-dimensional character development for both genders of all sexual orientations, such as Tony Prince, GTA 4, Samantha Trainor, and Mass Effect 3.

2530
02:40:30,241 --> 02:40:40,265
[SPEAKER_01]: We even see strong female leads who evolve significantly throughout certain game series, such as a young, naive, independent summoner who learns how to become independent with goals of her own.

2531
02:40:40,605 --> 02:40:43,707
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I'm a guy that played and actually enjoyed Final Fantasy X-2.

2532
02:40:44,007 --> 02:40:45,047
[SPEAKER_01]: X-2, Rob!

2533
02:40:46,408 --> 02:40:47,668
[SPEAKER_01]: Big whoop, wanna fight about it?

2534
02:40:48,169 --> 02:40:48,889
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm not judging you.

2535
02:40:49,690 --> 02:41:00,188
[SPEAKER_01]: The great thing about interactive entertainment is that it promotes individualism over traditionalism, therefore the player is free to accept others regardless of their race, religion, gender, and sexual orientation.

2536
02:41:01,621 --> 02:41:16,853
[SPEAKER_01]: It is unfortunate that we live in a patriarchal society, but I believe that both the feminism and homosexual movement will progress faster once the traditionalist members of the baby boomer generation retire from the professional world.

2537
02:41:17,273 --> 02:41:20,836
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I won't be present for tonight's show, I'm heading a card game tournament.

2538
02:41:21,296 --> 02:41:21,836
[SPEAKER_01]: Kick their ass.

2539
02:41:22,617 --> 02:41:25,279
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm interested in hearing your thought on this.

2540
02:41:25,339 --> 02:41:27,240
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations on 502 episodes.

2541
02:41:27,661 --> 02:41:30,423
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh well, army knight degenerate Johnny.

2542
02:41:31,500 --> 02:41:36,543
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is the thing about progress.

2543
02:41:38,084 --> 02:41:41,687
[SPEAKER_01]: When people get it in their head that progress needs to happen, it will happen.

2544
02:41:43,448 --> 02:41:45,909
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, the old guard's going to die out.

2545
02:41:47,630 --> 02:41:48,891
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other thoughts, people?

2546
02:41:50,672 --> 02:41:54,735
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to admit I'm furiously counting votes over here, so can you summarize real quick for me?

2547
02:41:55,487 --> 02:41:58,670
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, there's a lot more diversity in video games.

2548
02:41:58,710 --> 02:42:00,812
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing more strong female leads come out.

2549
02:42:01,412 --> 02:42:07,237
[SPEAKER_01]: And that basically the old head up their ass baby boomer traditionalist people are going to die out.

2550
02:42:07,937 --> 02:42:09,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they're not really playing video games anyway.

2551
02:42:09,999 --> 02:42:10,199
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

2552
02:42:10,239 --> 02:42:15,684
[SPEAKER_06]: But I worry about when I see these articles about how people believe that strong female leads won't sell.

2553
02:42:16,444 --> 02:42:17,665
[SPEAKER_06]: That makes me sick.

2554
02:42:17,786 --> 02:42:20,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Or the statistic that 18% of people are playing FemShep.

2555
02:42:21,008 --> 02:42:23,089
[SPEAKER_06]: We think it would be a little closer to 50-50.

2556
02:42:23,249 --> 02:42:25,610
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what really surprised me about that?

2557
02:42:25,951 --> 02:42:30,713
[SPEAKER_01]: Just about every bit of the fandom I've seen has been surrounding a female Shepard.

2558
02:42:32,614 --> 02:42:38,617
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe once or twice we'll see a fic with a male Shepard or fan art of BroShep.

2559
02:42:39,697 --> 02:42:40,478
[SPEAKER_01]: So, just saying.

2560
02:42:43,018 --> 02:42:43,318
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

2561
02:42:44,999 --> 02:42:45,219
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

2562
02:42:45,479 --> 02:42:46,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, someone we haven't heard from for a while, Rob.

2563
02:42:47,899 --> 02:42:49,020
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, OLR Crew.

2564
02:42:49,060 --> 02:42:52,580
[SPEAKER_01]: My email is directed towards Sky, who asked a simple question on episode 501.

2565
02:42:53,361 --> 02:42:54,621
[SPEAKER_01]: What's coming to PlayStation Vita?

2566
02:42:55,441 --> 02:43:00,962
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer to that is found on Reddit, where users compiled a list of upcoming games, even those without set release dates.

2567
02:43:01,062 --> 02:43:02,822
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the link so you can skim through the list.

2568
02:43:03,163 --> 02:43:03,683
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care.

2569
02:43:03,923 --> 02:43:05,323
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, hold on.

2570
02:43:08,768 --> 02:43:09,370
[SPEAKER_01]: Freaking Reddit.

2571
02:43:10,795 --> 02:43:12,822
[SPEAKER_01]: Guacamelee, which I kind of want to play.

2572
02:43:13,886 --> 02:43:14,708
[SPEAKER_05]: It's super good.

2573
02:43:16,665 --> 02:43:39,473
[SPEAKER_01]: Draw Slasher, Soul Calibur, Broken Destiny, Zombie Tycoon 2, Velocity Ultra, Muramasa Rebirth, Jak and Daxter, Dragon's Crown, Tearaway, Batman, Arkham Origins, Blackgate, Final Fantasy X-2 HD, Divekick, a bunch of Oddworld stuff, Malicious Rebirth.

2574
02:43:39,493 --> 02:43:44,055
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of good stuff on this list, but I still don't think that... Oh, there's an Ys game on here, too.

2575
02:43:46,969 --> 02:43:52,271
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know that it's going to be enough to really save it unless they can pull a miracle out of their ass.

2576
02:43:54,131 --> 02:43:57,092
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, Sky, you have dabbled with games from your PlayStation.

2577
02:43:57,152 --> 02:43:59,713
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, have you dabbled with games for your PlayStation Plus collection?

2578
02:44:00,213 --> 02:44:06,675
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems a little unusual that you haven't brought up games from Plus that you haven't tried out before in the How Was Your Gaming Week segments.

2579
02:44:07,035 --> 02:44:10,876
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm interested to hear what you have to say on games like Disgaea 3, The Cave, Closure, and others.

2580
02:44:11,176 --> 02:44:11,956
[SPEAKER_01]: I did buy Closure.

2581
02:44:12,696 --> 02:44:16,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Funny enough, I have The Cave sitting on my PlayStation 3 ready to play.

2582
02:44:16,121 --> 02:44:19,126
[SPEAKER_06]: I just didn't get to it this week because I had that other game to review.

2583
02:44:19,206 --> 02:44:21,409
[SPEAKER_06]: But yes, I have been trying to grab some of them.

2584
02:44:21,990 --> 02:44:24,715
[SPEAKER_06]: The Cave specifically, I was curious in checking out.

2585
02:44:24,755 --> 02:44:26,117
[SPEAKER_06]: So hopefully next week.

2586
02:44:26,829 --> 02:44:28,551
[SPEAKER_01]: I did get closure, by the way, on Steam.

2587
02:44:28,871 --> 02:44:29,672
[SPEAKER_01]: I just haven't played it yet.

2588
02:44:30,793 --> 02:44:32,094
[SPEAKER_06]: So many games, so little time.

2589
02:44:32,754 --> 02:44:34,636
[SPEAKER_06]: But thank you for the feedback on the Vita.

2590
02:44:35,477 --> 02:44:38,019
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll see what comes at E3.

2591
02:44:38,059 --> 02:44:39,801
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure it's going to be a huge thing as well.

2592
02:44:40,021 --> 02:44:41,142
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, the end of this email?

2593
02:44:41,462 --> 02:44:42,423
[SPEAKER_01]: I want some Pinkberry.

2594
02:44:42,823 --> 02:44:43,784
[SPEAKER_01]: The nasty canasta.

2595
02:44:43,984 --> 02:44:44,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Who doesn't?

2596
02:44:44,925 --> 02:44:45,806
[SPEAKER_01]: I want some Pinkberry.

2597
02:44:47,087 --> 02:44:47,968
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, this one's kind of long.

2598
02:44:48,849 --> 02:44:49,910
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, OLR.

2599
02:44:52,150 --> 02:44:57,113
[SPEAKER_01]: So sorry, by the way, guys, if I sound awful, I had an allergic reaction earlier, so.

2600
02:44:57,153 --> 02:45:00,055
[SPEAKER_01]: I got me a Wii U a couple weeks ago, basic set.

2601
02:45:00,515 --> 02:45:02,396
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been having a somewhat good time with it.

2602
02:45:02,796 --> 02:45:07,199
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm already, I've already, I guess that should be got four games.

2603
02:45:07,659 --> 02:45:08,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Super Mario Bros.

2604
02:45:08,579 --> 02:45:11,801
[SPEAKER_01]: U, Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate, Scribblenauts Unlimited, and Injustice Gods Among Us.

2605
02:45:12,262 --> 02:45:16,044
[SPEAKER_01]: Fun system that the touchpad is taking a lot more getting used to.

2606
02:45:16,644 --> 02:45:29,090
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll probably not be buying a lot of non-exclusive games on the platform unless they've got pro controller or classic controller support, but it's proving to be not the embarrassing waste of time I thought it would be when the system came out.

2607
02:45:29,790 --> 02:45:32,832
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping and fully expecting the system to become a worthwhile addition to the collection.

2608
02:45:34,212 --> 02:45:40,637
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of, it seems that Nintendo bullying out of the huge dick-waving contest that is the Mega Press Conference.

2609
02:45:41,257 --> 02:45:42,238
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, bowing out, sorry.

2610
02:45:43,959 --> 02:45:44,980
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we covered that earlier.

2611
02:45:45,260 --> 02:45:49,523
[SPEAKER_01]: Personally, I love the idea that Nintendo is ditching the traditional conference this year in favor of targeted meetings.

2612
02:45:49,963 --> 02:45:51,424
[SPEAKER_01]: The fewer charts I have to look at, the better.

2613
02:45:51,924 --> 02:45:55,387
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it's sad that the gaming media is quick to bash on Nintendo.

2614
02:45:55,747 --> 02:46:00,630
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that I'm a huge Nintendo fanboy, but I was always under the impression that we won the games.

2615
02:46:02,391 --> 02:46:02,611
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

2616
02:46:03,892 --> 02:46:29,482
[SPEAKER_01]: how much of it do you guys feel it's just the people wanting to shit on Nintendo because they're not the graphics whore choice versus legitimate concerns about the company I think there's a lot of bandwagon bashing but I my thing with press conferences or release of information I don't give a shit how they do it as long as they do something and we find out what it is I only care about the information I don't care how they put it out I just care that they do that's me

2617
02:46:31,198 --> 02:46:31,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Outro Music

2618
02:46:53,410 --> 02:46:57,752
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to the... I need to actually pick this instead of email.

2619
02:46:58,152 --> 02:47:02,234
[SPEAKER_01]: Lastly, my next hardware purchase is coming around July, and that is the Retron 5.

2620
02:47:02,574 --> 02:47:08,596
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure about your thoughts on clone consoles, but it sounds like they're going all out to ensure maximum compatibility.

2621
02:47:10,057 --> 02:47:15,519
[SPEAKER_01]: And the 720p upscaling saves states and full-button customization for any controller you use on the thing.

2622
02:47:15,959 --> 02:47:18,360
[SPEAKER_01]: That brings me to the question, where do you guys stand on retro gaming?

2623
02:47:18,940 --> 02:47:25,005
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want all the modern accoutrements that are offered by emulators and will be offered by the Retro 5?

2624
02:47:25,065 --> 02:47:28,347
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you guys intolerant of any deviation from the original play limitations?

2625
02:47:28,808 --> 02:47:29,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Me, I can go either way.

2626
02:47:30,509 --> 02:47:35,833
[SPEAKER_01]: Though with five cartridge ports, this thing is going to be a sight more convenient than having my NES, NES, Genesis all at once.

2627
02:47:36,234 --> 02:47:38,916
[SPEAKER_01]: And if only they can add in support for Turbo Duo and Sega CD.

2628
02:47:39,696 --> 02:47:40,557
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, that's it for the email.

2629
02:47:40,577 --> 02:47:41,157
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for reading.

2630
02:47:41,197 --> 02:47:42,198
[SPEAKER_01]: Regards, RawSteelUT.

2631
02:47:43,259 --> 02:47:46,361
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my thought about it, because given that I am in a position of both,

2632
02:47:47,162 --> 02:47:52,185
[SPEAKER_01]: You did not put in the do not give a shit category because it all depends on my mood.

2633
02:47:52,925 --> 02:48:05,392
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on how much I feel like digging through boxes to pull out one of the Super Nintendos and plug it in and then where to find our copy of Chrono Trigger or Super Metroid or...

2634
02:48:06,773 --> 02:48:33,722
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer to play things on the original console if given my if I had the perfect vault if we had everything hooked back up again switch boxes and everything yeah I would be totally playing it on the original console because I can safely say I likely have the original console but if it's a quick thing or I want to play like a Seiken Densetsu 3 and there's an amazing fan translation out but I don't have a ROM burner

2635
02:48:34,662 --> 02:48:40,050
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'll play the emulator I'm not really picky If it's the only way I have to play it I'll play me some Power Rangers

2636
02:48:40,865 --> 02:48:40,945
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

2637
02:48:40,965 --> 02:48:41,025
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

2638
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:12,342
[SPEAKER_01]: Unboxed for about $150 on eBay.

2639
02:49:12,402 --> 02:49:13,182
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be selling it.

2640
02:49:14,243 --> 02:49:19,587
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like that chick that found the copy of Stadium Events at a thrift store and she's making bank off it.

2641
02:49:20,327 --> 02:49:20,747
[SPEAKER_01]: Good for her.

2642
02:49:20,767 --> 02:49:25,370
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the whole reason is that as much as we love the game, it's not going to be one that we're going to play a lot.

2643
02:49:27,007 --> 02:49:33,591
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're looking at the collection, I'm almost always going to grab the Turbo Duo and play Dracula X. Which is the correct choice to make.

2644
02:49:34,512 --> 02:49:38,214
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I wish they would translate and re-burn on a CD?

2645
02:49:39,375 --> 02:49:47,439
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Sapphire was a great game, but Emerald Dragon was the RPG that came out on PC Engine Duo.

2646
02:49:47,740 --> 02:49:49,521
[SPEAKER_05]: You just named a game I've never played.

2647
02:49:50,381 --> 02:49:51,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Holy shit.

2648
02:49:52,122 --> 02:49:53,543
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I've also played Panorama Cotton.

2649
02:49:54,477 --> 02:49:58,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, yeah, but I mean, I don't unfortunately own a copy, but I have played it.

2650
02:49:58,760 --> 02:50:01,983
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my friends that for a little while worked for Ubisoft in Japan owns a copy.

2651
02:50:03,184 --> 02:50:04,045
[SPEAKER_01]: She wouldn't lend it to me.

2652
02:50:04,065 --> 02:50:05,746
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, you're going to Japan, let me borrow it.

2653
02:50:05,966 --> 02:50:06,226
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

2654
02:50:07,407 --> 02:50:10,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me say this quickly about the back to the email with the emulators and all that.

2655
02:50:11,390 --> 02:50:15,173
[SPEAKER_06]: I really do like, you know, the retro gaming when it's done right.

2656
02:50:15,453 --> 02:50:18,456
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, sometimes they're cheap cash-ins and you can tell.

2657
02:50:18,976 --> 02:50:23,400
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of wish companies in this day and age would do more, especially because, you know, we've shifted from...

2658
02:50:23,880 --> 02:50:24,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

2659
02:50:44,830 --> 02:50:45,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Or a better game.

2660
02:51:11,134 --> 02:51:11,775
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2661
02:51:32,729 --> 02:51:35,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty rad that we can fire up a two-player game.

2662
02:51:35,632 --> 02:51:37,533
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, again, I'm going to use Ice Climbers as an example.

2663
02:51:37,873 --> 02:51:40,095
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, we can do that anywhere.

2664
02:51:40,155 --> 02:51:44,819
[SPEAKER_06]: We could sit in the car and play Ice Climber on 3DS.

2665
02:51:45,479 --> 02:51:48,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me, versus, thanks to Virtual Console.

2666
02:51:48,382 --> 02:51:49,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I love that.

2667
02:51:50,343 --> 02:51:55,868
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to just see that pushed forward a little faster because the technology's, you know, there to get it online and all that.

2668
02:51:56,508 --> 02:51:56,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow...

2669
02:51:57,884 --> 02:51:58,605
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my thoughts.

2670
02:51:58,665 --> 02:51:59,485
[SPEAKER_01]: We have another email.

2671
02:51:59,765 --> 02:52:01,046
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

2672
02:52:02,728 --> 02:52:03,768
[SPEAKER_01]: That was from RallstillUT.

2673
02:52:03,969 --> 02:52:05,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, the last email.

2674
02:52:06,590 --> 02:52:07,271
[SPEAKER_01]: Howdy, y'all.

2675
02:52:08,272 --> 02:52:08,832
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to say it right.

2676
02:52:09,072 --> 02:52:09,613
[SPEAKER_01]: Howdy, y'all.

2677
02:52:10,533 --> 02:52:10,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Howdy.

2678
02:52:10,934 --> 02:52:11,914
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I say it myself.

2679
02:52:12,695 --> 02:52:17,058
[SPEAKER_01]: I was poking around in the Boston Red Sox official store today and marveled at all the shit you can buy there.

2680
02:52:17,578 --> 02:52:18,439
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, look it up.

2681
02:52:18,499 --> 02:52:22,802
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an astounding variety of items with the Boston Red Sox logo on it that you can waste your money on.

2682
02:52:23,983 --> 02:52:26,586
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there an equivalent store for WoW memorabilia?

2683
02:52:27,446 --> 02:52:27,727
[SPEAKER_01]: eBay.

2684
02:52:28,968 --> 02:52:32,551
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a place online where I can blow my money on a wide variety of WoW shit?

2685
02:52:33,112 --> 02:52:36,535
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a sticker with your flying mount on it is a no-brainer to me.

2686
02:52:37,056 --> 02:52:41,620
[SPEAKER_01]: That thing you use to get around in real life on the thing you use to get around in the real world?

2687
02:52:42,160 --> 02:52:43,081
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be awesome.

2688
02:52:43,361 --> 02:52:45,103
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay Black Redertainment Trainer.

2689
02:52:46,905 --> 02:52:46,965
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

2690
02:52:48,948 --> 02:52:52,311
[SPEAKER_01]: You know... There's the Jinx store.

2691
02:52:52,571 --> 02:52:54,633
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Geek has a lot of WoW stuff.

2692
02:52:55,013 --> 02:52:55,314
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

2693
02:52:56,495 --> 02:52:59,477
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if there's a Blizzard company store.

2694
02:53:00,218 --> 02:53:02,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Jinx is kind of like one of their official, I think, vendors.

2695
02:53:03,181 --> 02:53:05,322
[SPEAKER_06]: They do a lot of that stuff.

2696
02:53:05,343 --> 02:53:07,364
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're always at BlizzCon.

2697
02:53:07,404 --> 02:53:09,426
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like J-Y-N-X, right?

2698
02:53:09,666 --> 02:53:10,207
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe so.

2699
02:53:10,247 --> 02:53:10,907
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the drag queen?

2700
02:53:11,208 --> 02:53:14,531
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, or like the Pokemon drag queen.

2701
02:53:15,612 --> 02:53:33,907
[SPEAKER_01]: I was gonna say too that I think if you look on Etsy there's a lot of fan made items that are really good I mean and I know that there are people out there who will like there's artists out there who will do commissioned work of your character and your mount and

2702
02:53:34,347 --> 02:53:35,288
[SPEAKER_01]: The Current Lich King

2703
02:54:00,291 --> 02:54:00,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Artis?

2704
02:54:00,752 --> 02:54:01,333
[SPEAKER_01]: Not Artis.

2705
02:54:01,393 --> 02:54:01,853
[SPEAKER_01]: Bolvar?

2706
02:54:02,214 --> 02:54:02,534
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

2707
02:54:02,995 --> 02:54:06,079
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually a picture of him on fire.

2708
02:54:06,640 --> 02:54:07,421
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.

2709
02:54:07,461 --> 02:54:08,582
[SPEAKER_01]: Not sitting on the throne.

2710
02:54:08,722 --> 02:54:09,864
[SPEAKER_01]: He's just standing there on fire.

2711
02:54:09,904 --> 02:54:10,725
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's called Lava Man.

2712
02:54:11,106 --> 02:54:11,646
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have him.

2713
02:54:12,327 --> 02:54:17,394
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have old actual Warcraft things, but all you need is the viewer and the ability to make the stickers.

2714
02:54:17,634 --> 02:54:24,736
[SPEAKER_06]: I was also going to suggest, honestly, if your mall has a hot topic, I see Warcraft shirts in there all the time.

2715
02:54:26,077 --> 02:54:33,199
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're wanting props and things or stuff to put on your wall, check with cosplay distributors.

2716
02:54:33,699 --> 02:54:35,040
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you can get stuff there too.

2717
02:54:35,080 --> 02:54:36,080
[SPEAKER_01]: I know people who make weapons.

2718
02:54:36,960 --> 02:54:39,541
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a friend with a 3D printer and learn a CAD software.

2719
02:54:40,262 --> 02:54:42,163
[SPEAKER_01]: Or what's that printer?

2720
02:54:42,743 --> 02:54:45,044
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a couple grand, but it's like an at-home 3D printer.

2721
02:54:45,064 --> 02:54:46,044
[SPEAKER_00]: It's MakerBot?

2722
02:54:46,145 --> 02:54:46,705
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, MakerBot.

2723
02:54:47,325 --> 02:54:50,967
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think people have done insignias and things for MakerBot.

2724
02:54:50,987 --> 02:54:55,969
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also buy a monthly membership to TechShop and use their fancy ones.

2725
02:54:56,129 --> 02:55:03,413
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that actually the school I go to now is going to be getting a 3D printer in the next couple years for the art design lab.

2726
02:55:05,519 --> 02:55:18,753
[SPEAKER_06]: all right uh if that's it for the emails tonight yes indeed it is let's go to the FUs of the week it's a chance for us to be angsty because you know for 502 weeks now we've been carrying a little angst on this show

2727
02:55:34,699 --> 02:55:36,640
[SPEAKER_01]: My F you goes to the pizza, actually.

2728
02:55:37,361 --> 02:55:38,821
[SPEAKER_01]: To Papa Murphy's pizza in general.

2729
02:55:39,162 --> 02:55:42,784
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this is actually the third time I've had an allergic reaction to Papa Murphy's pizza.

2730
02:55:43,584 --> 02:55:45,585
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been a different kind of pizza every time.

2731
02:55:46,345 --> 02:55:50,308
[SPEAKER_01]: And, like, I'm talking about my tongue started to swell, my throat itched.

2732
02:55:51,028 --> 02:55:52,609
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so sorry, because it's so good.

2733
02:55:53,169 --> 02:55:59,493
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not complaining about how delicious the pizza was, but I was sitting here having... And, by the way, thank you for the medical.

2734
02:55:59,813 --> 02:56:02,915
[SPEAKER_01]: I was sitting here, like, literally having one of those, like...

2735
02:56:03,943 --> 02:56:07,605
[SPEAKER_01]: Weird allergic reactions with the rash and everything, and I'm like, oh my god.

2736
02:56:07,625 --> 02:56:09,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank god Tim brings us drugs.

2737
02:56:09,687 --> 02:56:10,447
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for that.

2738
02:56:10,507 --> 02:56:11,167
[SPEAKER_06]: You're welcome.

2739
02:56:11,848 --> 02:56:18,532
[SPEAKER_01]: But, I mean, this is the third time I've had pizza from Papa Murphy's and Reacted to it.

2740
02:56:19,272 --> 02:56:21,093
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I don't think I'll be eating here again.

2741
02:56:22,514 --> 02:56:22,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

2742
02:56:23,635 --> 02:56:27,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck you, United States Postal Service, for just chilling on my package.

2743
02:56:28,418 --> 02:56:30,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead of just, you know, delivering my package.

2744
02:56:30,299 --> 02:56:31,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually that's what you want people to do.

2745
02:56:33,647 --> 02:56:34,788
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you don't want them to chill.

2746
02:56:34,828 --> 02:56:36,489
[SPEAKER_08]: You want them to fucking move around.

2747
02:56:37,249 --> 02:56:42,673
[SPEAKER_08]: You want them to be getting close to, you know, delivering the package.

2748
02:56:45,815 --> 02:56:49,837
[SPEAKER_08]: And said no, they're just like... You want them to make that delivery.

2749
02:56:50,318 --> 02:56:50,898
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

2750
02:56:51,218 --> 02:56:52,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Make the delivery.

2751
02:56:52,959 --> 02:56:53,640
[SPEAKER_08]: Get moving!

2752
02:56:56,802 --> 02:56:57,863
[SPEAKER_08]: I want my, ooh yeah!

2753
02:56:57,943 --> 02:56:58,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah!

2754
02:57:02,913 --> 02:57:08,922
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to the crappy heat here in Sacramento today, because I wanted to take my friends to the flea market, but it was just too hot.

2755
02:57:09,983 --> 02:57:14,145
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go bargain hunting for video games in October.

2756
02:57:14,365 --> 02:57:18,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly with those two Sega prototype systems.

2757
02:57:18,246 --> 02:57:21,248
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going for like multi-grand on eBay.

2758
02:57:21,428 --> 02:57:22,368
[SPEAKER_08]: Bought for a dollar.

2759
02:57:22,628 --> 02:57:23,428
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I know, right?

2760
02:57:23,889 --> 02:57:25,829
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't they actually close down Auction Town?

2761
02:57:25,849 --> 02:57:27,070
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's where Trader Dan's was.

2762
02:57:27,290 --> 02:57:27,610
[SPEAKER_06]: They did.

2763
02:57:27,710 --> 02:57:31,872
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to have a really hard time finding the good game sales at the flea market.

2764
02:57:31,892 --> 02:57:34,573
[SPEAKER_06]: You find some stuff at the flea market still, though.

2765
02:57:34,633 --> 02:57:34,993
[SPEAKER_01]: You do.

2766
02:57:35,013 --> 02:57:38,354
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet Trader Dan's started back up on eBay, though.

2767
02:57:38,955 --> 02:57:39,355
[SPEAKER_01]: I would bet.

2768
02:57:40,496 --> 02:57:42,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Captain Spike, do you have any FUs of the week?

2769
02:57:45,239 --> 02:57:48,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Tim for preferring Super Mario Bros.

2770
02:57:48,761 --> 02:58:02,031
[SPEAKER_05]: 3 to Super Mario World and Rage quitting on me when we played Super Mario World and you for making me play Ice Climber Deal with it Alright, Tim, do you have any FUs of the week?

2771
02:58:02,231 --> 02:58:07,775
[SPEAKER_00]: I do, it was a related note Fuck you, Magikoopa I am done with your shit

2772
02:58:10,011 --> 02:58:10,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Fair enough.

2773
02:58:12,312 --> 02:58:12,632
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2774
02:58:14,453 --> 02:58:18,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Let us do a couple more stories, then we're going to open up the Skype line for a little bit.

2775
02:58:18,534 --> 02:58:21,475
[SPEAKER_06]: We are running super long tonight, though, so I'm sorry.

2776
02:58:21,495 --> 02:58:23,276
[SPEAKER_06]: I might have to abbreviate some of the end of the show here.

2777
02:58:23,676 --> 02:58:25,716
[SPEAKER_06]: But let's at least get these news stories out of the way.

2778
02:58:25,756 --> 02:58:26,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

2779
02:58:26,237 --> 02:58:32,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so the second round of auctions for THQ happened, and some of your big franchises have gone to, well, mainly Nordic games.

2780
02:58:32,739 --> 02:58:34,739
[SPEAKER_08]: They bought Darksiders and Red Faction.

2781
02:58:35,100 --> 02:58:37,300
[SPEAKER_08]: And five games, guess what they get drawn to life?

2782
02:58:37,660 --> 02:58:38,561
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah.

2783
02:58:39,341 --> 02:58:46,687
[SPEAKER_08]: and then Gearbox actually got a hold of the Homeworld franchise.

2784
02:58:47,508 --> 02:58:49,730
[SPEAKER_08]: The one that they were trying to buy via crowdfunding.

2785
02:58:51,772 --> 02:58:59,939
[SPEAKER_08]: And Nord Games actually has been working with THQ for a while now talking sequels and they're hopefully going to get the same developers back on board.

2786
02:59:00,960 --> 02:59:05,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Also they purchased MX vs. ATV and Titan Quest were the other two franchises they bought.

2787
02:59:06,244 --> 02:59:25,102
[SPEAKER_08]: And then THQ sold all this money to a lot of people, including Double Fine, Codemasters for F1, and hell, they even own Ruben some money because different, I guess, bonuses or whatever.

2788
02:59:25,163 --> 02:59:26,564
[SPEAKER_08]: Employee obligations, they said.

2789
02:59:29,983 --> 02:59:33,445
[SPEAKER_06]: One more story for you guys tonight, and I think this is very interesting.

2790
02:59:33,505 --> 02:59:39,689
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of those things I'm kind of surprised didn't happen sooner, but lately we've talked about a lot of crappy games.

2791
02:59:40,409 --> 02:59:48,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Or I shouldn't say necessarily they're crappy games, because there's still people that love them, but games that get a crappy reputation based on the internet.

2792
02:59:49,074 --> 02:59:53,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Games such as SimCity, Mass Effect 3 and the ending.

2793
02:59:53,936 --> 02:59:56,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Aliens, Colonial Marines, Duke Nukem Forever.

2794
02:59:56,278 --> 02:59:56,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know what?

2795
02:59:56,918 --> 03:00:02,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Before all of that, there was E.T., the extraterrestrial on the Atari 2600.

2796
03:00:03,502 --> 03:00:07,285
[SPEAKER_06]: But see, when I was seven, it wasn't as bad as everyone made it out to be.

2797
03:00:07,305 --> 03:00:10,067
[SPEAKER_06]: But the most frustrating thing was you always fell in the damn pit, right?

2798
03:00:10,647 --> 03:00:11,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's the interesting thing.

2799
03:00:12,148 --> 03:00:16,831
[SPEAKER_06]: A hacker went back and fixed some of the problems people have with the game.

2800
03:00:17,211 --> 03:00:19,613
[SPEAKER_06]: And now people are like, this game's not so bad.

2801
03:00:19,673 --> 03:00:20,473
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of fun.

2802
03:00:20,893 --> 03:00:22,374
[SPEAKER_06]: So what were the things that were changed?

2803
03:00:22,414 --> 03:00:26,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, for one, they made ET an actual ET color instead of, you know, that green.

2804
03:00:27,397 --> 03:00:31,559
[SPEAKER_06]: And most importantly, they fixed the falling in the pit all the time.

2805
03:00:31,599 --> 03:00:37,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead of one pixel colliding with the pit, it's a different collision detection, which makes it far less frustrating.

2806
03:00:37,703 --> 03:00:39,424
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not always falling in that stupid pit.

2807
03:00:40,505 --> 03:00:46,674
[SPEAKER_06]: So, now just so you guys know, Howard Scott Warshaw made the original game and he was really rushed for time.

2808
03:00:46,854 --> 03:00:51,120
[SPEAKER_06]: As a lot of the movie tie-in games were at the time, he only had months to make it.

2809
03:00:51,281 --> 03:00:53,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Same thing happened with Pac-Man and why that turned out so bad too.

2810
03:00:54,706 --> 03:00:55,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that funny?

2811
03:00:55,347 --> 03:00:56,088
[SPEAKER_01]: Pac-Man was awful.

2812
03:00:56,388 --> 03:00:57,388
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2813
03:01:17,755 --> 03:01:23,541
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, neocomputer.org is the one that made the project that tried to fix some of E.T.'

2814
03:01:23,521 --> 03:01:24,542
[SPEAKER_06]: 's problems.

2815
03:01:25,022 --> 03:01:32,269
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe the project ended up getting done by David Richardson, who goes by the handle Recompile.

2816
03:01:32,770 --> 03:01:33,691
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's pretty cool.

2817
03:01:34,332 --> 03:01:35,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, from Atari Age.

2818
03:01:35,333 --> 03:01:40,301
[SPEAKER_06]: He single-handedly, I guess, maybe this, like, started the discussion there, but he single-handedly ended up putting it together.

2819
03:01:40,841 --> 03:01:49,054
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, fixed the well, fixed the difficulty settings, so, like, not every step will drain your energy, and some of this stuff.

2820
03:01:49,114 --> 03:01:49,615
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh...

2821
03:01:50,055 --> 03:01:50,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, pretty cool.

2822
03:01:50,896 --> 03:01:53,418
[SPEAKER_06]: And it even showed tutorial videos and how they did it.

2823
03:01:53,978 --> 03:01:59,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and they even have, if you want to do the ROM hack yourself, they give you the addresses and what to change in the hex editor.

2824
03:01:59,883 --> 03:02:04,166
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet somebody like you is like, well, I mean, I know you don't hack a lot of Atari 2600, but this is still pretty fascinating.

2825
03:02:04,186 --> 03:02:05,727
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the one that's already done.

2826
03:02:05,767 --> 03:02:06,808
[SPEAKER_08]: You can download the ROM, I think.

2827
03:02:06,948 --> 03:02:07,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

2828
03:02:08,429 --> 03:02:09,050
[SPEAKER_08]: But very cool.

2829
03:02:10,972 --> 03:02:14,095
[SPEAKER_06]: It's almost like how people will hack SimCity to play offline.

2830
03:02:15,336 --> 03:02:17,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Or fix alien colonial marines.

2831
03:02:17,899 --> 03:02:19,200
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just funny.

2832
03:02:19,821 --> 03:02:20,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so there you go.

2833
03:02:21,823 --> 03:02:23,705
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it for the official stories we have tonight.

2834
03:02:24,586 --> 03:02:26,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me open up the Skype line.

2835
03:02:26,727 --> 03:02:30,611
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

2836
03:02:30,931 --> 03:02:32,973
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to go ahead and give us a call, that would be awesome.

2837
03:02:34,794 --> 03:02:44,463
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to talk about something we talked about on the show tonight or something you think we missed, what you've been playing, you have a question for Captain Spike or Tim and want to talk about whatever, give us a call.

2838
03:02:44,783 --> 03:02:45,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Say hello.

2839
03:02:45,163 --> 03:02:48,006
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2840
03:02:48,366 --> 03:02:48,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Last Minute Stories

2841
03:03:11,770 --> 03:03:17,373
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that... Again, I'm not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater and say Batman sucks because they're adding multiplayer to it.

2842
03:03:17,393 --> 03:03:19,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Mass Effect 3, it was fine.

2843
03:03:19,695 --> 03:03:21,195
[SPEAKER_06]: I really love the multiplayer Mass Effect 3.

2844
03:03:21,556 --> 03:03:29,980
[SPEAKER_06]: But I understand where people have some great reservations, especially hearing it's a new studio and now all this other... It kind of sounds like they're trying to do this one on the cheap.

2845
03:03:31,001 --> 03:03:32,502
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a big concern.

2846
03:03:35,988 --> 03:03:37,990
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you're agreeing with me over there, Spike?

2847
03:03:38,490 --> 03:03:39,031
[SPEAKER_06]: I do agree.

2848
03:03:39,131 --> 03:03:39,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2849
03:03:40,052 --> 03:03:43,515
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is, because Arkham City is so fucking good.

2850
03:03:43,615 --> 03:03:48,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, this next game, to live up to that legacy, is really going to have to be a step above that.

2851
03:03:48,479 --> 03:03:52,002
[SPEAKER_06]: When you hear things like this, you kind of go, not sure if want.

2852
03:03:54,003 --> 03:03:54,344
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

2853
03:03:54,384 --> 03:03:55,865
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure E3's going to answer a lot of that.

2854
03:03:56,305 --> 03:03:56,686
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else?

2855
03:03:56,706 --> 03:04:01,009
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to call.

2856
03:04:01,070 --> 03:04:01,470
[SPEAKER_06]: All one word.

2857
03:04:02,373 --> 03:04:12,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Real quick, Tigerclaw in chat says the reason why the new Batman game has a younger version actor is because the game takes place years before Arkham Asylum, it's a prequel that's why they went with somebody younger

2858
03:04:33,805 --> 03:04:34,985
[SPEAKER_07]: and that's an excuse.

2859
03:04:35,005 --> 03:04:38,506
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a voice actor.

2860
03:04:39,306 --> 03:04:43,047
[SPEAKER_05]: He's played younger Batman in different animated series and what have you.

2861
03:04:43,087 --> 03:04:44,607
[SPEAKER_05]: He's been doing this voice a long time.

2862
03:04:44,627 --> 03:04:45,727
[SPEAKER_05]: He's very good.

2863
03:04:45,867 --> 03:04:47,868
[SPEAKER_06]: They also didn't hear your mic off or something?

2864
03:04:48,368 --> 03:04:53,289
[SPEAKER_01]: He's done Teenage Bruce Wayne and did a wonderfully believable job.

2865
03:04:54,349 --> 03:04:55,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we got a phone call here.

2866
03:04:55,529 --> 03:04:56,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2867
03:04:56,789 --> 03:04:57,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

2868
03:04:58,990 --> 03:04:59,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, what's up, buddy?

2869
03:05:03,390 --> 03:05:03,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey.

2870
03:05:04,770 --> 03:05:05,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, not a whole lot.

2871
03:05:06,091 --> 03:05:08,712
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just, you know, hanging in there.

2872
03:05:09,392 --> 03:05:10,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what did you want to call us about tonight?

2873
03:05:13,133 --> 03:05:18,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I had a, uh... Hang on, let me mute my... Are you here?

2874
03:05:18,455 --> 03:05:20,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you forget to mute your radio before you called in?

2875
03:05:23,016 --> 03:05:23,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was trying to.

2876
03:05:23,936 --> 03:05:24,657
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot, sorry.

2877
03:05:25,017 --> 03:05:25,817
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I had a, uh...

2878
03:05:33,396 --> 03:05:38,097
[SPEAKER_06]: Heck yeah, I want to... Wait, didn't DarkSakura have dibs on that?

2879
03:05:38,337 --> 03:05:39,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Something with La Mulana on Steam?

2880
03:05:39,677 --> 03:05:39,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2881
03:05:39,917 --> 03:05:42,478
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want it.

2882
03:05:42,678 --> 03:05:44,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I was like, if she ain't taking it, I'm taking it.

2883
03:05:44,938 --> 03:05:45,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Shit, I want to play it.

2884
03:05:45,998 --> 03:05:47,858
[SPEAKER_01]: I came super close to buying it until I remembered.

2885
03:05:48,379 --> 03:05:49,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there you go.

2886
03:05:49,259 --> 03:05:57,260
[SPEAKER_06]: So... Well, as much as I would love to give a key away to the listeners, I think we want to kind of keep it for ourselves.

2887
03:05:57,320 --> 03:06:02,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, but I want to play... Only because you rave about it so much do we want to play it for ourselves.

2888
03:06:05,546 --> 03:06:07,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Why should we all be playing La Mulana?

2889
03:06:07,368 --> 03:06:12,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's a fun game.

2890
03:06:12,532 --> 03:06:18,296
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, those old school games were tough, but, you know.

2891
03:06:19,277 --> 03:06:23,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but isn't La Mulana like Asshole Mario Hard?

2892
03:06:26,278 --> 03:06:29,599
[SPEAKER_06]: It can be, but once you get the hang of it.

2893
03:06:29,899 --> 03:06:31,859
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just memorizing patterns, just like old Mega Man games.

2894
03:06:31,879 --> 03:06:32,359
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

2895
03:06:32,699 --> 03:06:38,400
[SPEAKER_01]: I will be magnanimous and donate that code to you.

2896
03:06:38,880 --> 03:06:39,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

2897
03:06:40,741 --> 03:06:50,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, DarkTetsuya, I thank you very much for donating the code to us and feeding our gaming addiction further.

2898
03:06:50,842 --> 03:06:54,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft in the chatroom says, La Mulana is your Mass Effect.

2899
03:06:54,443 --> 03:06:54,663
[SPEAKER_06]: True?

2900
03:06:56,018 --> 03:06:57,079
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet he doesn't have tarantula.

2901
03:06:57,099 --> 03:06:58,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I suppose so.

2902
03:06:59,701 --> 03:06:59,961
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2903
03:07:00,242 --> 03:07:03,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Dr. Suya, is there anything else you want to talk with us about tonight?

2904
03:07:06,527 --> 03:07:08,148
[SPEAKER_06]: I just had a question.

2905
03:07:08,389 --> 03:07:08,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2906
03:07:10,570 --> 03:07:13,453
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was planning on Best of Three.

2907
03:07:14,173 --> 03:07:14,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2908
03:07:14,774 --> 03:07:15,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

2909
03:07:16,455 --> 03:07:21,860
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of need Episode 169 to finish working on it.

2910
03:07:23,554 --> 03:07:28,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, for, um, uh, is this, this is the, um, the, is this the DDR step file stuff?

2911
03:07:30,521 --> 03:07:33,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, it's the, uh, Best Hits compilation.

2912
03:07:33,344 --> 03:07:35,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so you, you need episode 169?

2913
03:07:35,326 --> 03:07:36,427
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have that?

2914
03:07:36,447 --> 03:07:36,947
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's at 159.

2915
03:07:41,008 --> 03:07:41,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-uh.

2916
03:08:07,219 --> 03:08:07,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a big deal.

2917
03:08:08,202 --> 03:08:08,964
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2918
03:08:09,025 --> 03:08:10,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, DarkSakura, we're going to let you go to get more calls.

2919
03:08:10,950 --> 03:08:11,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care, okay?

2920
03:08:12,435 --> 03:08:13,077
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2921
03:08:13,097 --> 03:08:13,558
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye-bye.

2922
03:08:15,086 --> 03:08:18,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, he had some type of echo going on in the background and it kind of made it hard for me to hear.

2923
03:08:18,467 --> 03:08:20,208
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he didn't really mute the computer.

2924
03:08:20,688 --> 03:08:22,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Or he had the TV on in the background.

2925
03:08:22,268 --> 03:08:24,029
[SPEAKER_06]: He's trying to watch Chair of Swords.

2926
03:08:25,189 --> 03:08:25,989
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn that show.

2927
03:08:27,750 --> 03:08:28,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen to us at the same time.

2928
03:08:28,950 --> 03:08:30,631
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, though, I did find a character I like.

2929
03:08:31,391 --> 03:08:31,811
[SPEAKER_01]: Daenerys.

2930
03:08:32,311 --> 03:08:33,632
[SPEAKER_01]: Because she sets people on fire.

2931
03:08:35,752 --> 03:08:39,494
[SPEAKER_08]: She inquires about the location of her dragons.

2932
03:08:39,514 --> 03:08:43,135
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or use your name on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

2933
03:08:43,175 --> 03:08:44,095
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, can you talk again?

2934
03:08:45,572 --> 03:08:47,953
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm talking and my mic is not working.

2935
03:08:47,993 --> 03:08:49,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Why has your mic just suddenly stopped working?

2936
03:08:49,873 --> 03:08:50,593
[SPEAKER_06]: That's weird.

2937
03:08:51,093 --> 03:08:53,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Because your board is possessed.

2938
03:08:53,954 --> 03:08:55,154
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it just needs to be dusted.

2939
03:08:55,214 --> 03:08:56,634
[SPEAKER_01]: It is kind of gray.

2940
03:08:56,654 --> 03:09:01,315
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if our board might just be... I mean, we've had that board six years now.

2941
03:09:03,956 --> 03:09:05,356
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a damn expensive board.

2942
03:09:05,396 --> 03:09:06,176
[SPEAKER_01]: It should last.

2943
03:09:07,217 --> 03:09:07,577
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

2944
03:09:07,637 --> 03:09:08,217
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying.

2945
03:09:08,817 --> 03:09:09,617
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the reality.

2946
03:09:09,657 --> 03:09:10,537
[SPEAKER_06]: We might need something else.

2947
03:09:10,997 --> 03:09:12,258
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it just needs to be cleaned out.

2948
03:09:12,558 --> 03:09:13,378
[SPEAKER_01]: The contacts need to be

2949
03:09:14,184 --> 03:09:15,125
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll work on it.

2950
03:09:15,945 --> 03:09:16,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Live radio.

2951
03:09:16,645 --> 03:09:17,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Ain't it a blast?

2952
03:09:17,306 --> 03:09:23,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we didn't learn that we were going to have audio problems until like Bobby's call tonight.

2953
03:09:23,209 --> 03:09:24,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, really, right?

2954
03:09:24,490 --> 03:09:24,790
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2955
03:09:25,851 --> 03:09:28,032
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to just leave it open a little longer for another call.

2956
03:09:28,052 --> 03:09:30,434
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or use your name on Skype.

2957
03:09:30,594 --> 03:09:32,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

2958
03:09:33,535 --> 03:09:37,557
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to quickly try to comb the Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR.

2959
03:09:38,737 --> 03:09:40,078
[SPEAKER_06]: TigerClaw sending us a tweet.

2960
03:09:40,258 --> 03:09:43,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Eve Online getting a TV show based on real player stories.

2961
03:09:44,459 --> 03:09:46,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm, isn't that kind of like what Defiance is doing?

2962
03:09:47,240 --> 03:09:50,542
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, Eve Online, of course, is an MMO that's been around for a while.

2963
03:09:50,582 --> 03:09:52,862
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that whole space one.

2964
03:09:52,902 --> 03:09:53,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that the one where...

2965
03:09:54,443 --> 03:10:01,527
[SPEAKER_06]: They had all that loot of game time cards that were on a ship and the ship exploded and all that money is just gone.

2966
03:10:02,967 --> 03:10:05,849
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, EVE Online is going to get a TV show based on the stories and game.

2967
03:10:05,869 --> 03:10:06,429
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty cool.

2968
03:10:07,269 --> 03:10:09,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you imagine if they turned fanfic into TV shows?

2969
03:10:09,510 --> 03:10:11,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's essentially what they're saying here.

2970
03:10:11,632 --> 03:10:14,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I don't know.

2971
03:10:14,333 --> 03:10:16,354
[SPEAKER_01]: They did it for Mass Effect with the Citadel DLC.

2972
03:10:17,695 --> 03:10:18,595
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say that.

2973
03:10:19,855 --> 03:10:21,578
[SPEAKER_01]: Except for creepy Shaga.

2974
03:10:23,420 --> 03:10:24,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that really upset me.

2975
03:10:24,162 --> 03:10:25,203
[SPEAKER_01]: That was so date rapey.

2976
03:10:25,443 --> 03:10:25,984
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god.

2977
03:10:27,466 --> 03:10:29,109
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt dirty watching it on YouTube.

2978
03:10:31,661 --> 03:10:32,602
[SPEAKER_01]: Just filthy.

2979
03:10:34,343 --> 03:10:34,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

2980
03:10:34,903 --> 03:10:40,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Also at Twitter.com slash OLR a tweet from Actdeft.

2981
03:10:41,367 --> 03:10:44,409
[SPEAKER_06]: The third Skullgirls DLC character voting has ended.

2982
03:10:44,449 --> 03:10:47,811
[SPEAKER_06]: The fans chose Eliza, an Egyptian-based character.

2983
03:10:48,231 --> 03:10:50,773
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Skullgirls is pretty tight with the brony community.

2984
03:10:51,613 --> 03:10:53,694
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not surprised that Actdeft's reporting on this.

2985
03:10:53,854 --> 03:10:56,896
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big thing I see on my Tumblr page a lot, actually.

2986
03:10:56,996 --> 03:10:57,356
[SPEAKER_01]: Brony?

2987
03:10:57,576 --> 03:10:58,196
[SPEAKER_06]: No, Skullgirls.

2988
03:10:58,276 --> 03:10:58,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Skullgirls?

2989
03:10:58,977 --> 03:10:59,217
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

2990
03:10:59,737 --> 03:11:02,238
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a big stint of Skullgirls stuff for a while.

2991
03:11:02,319 --> 03:11:03,899
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a great alliance that they made.

2992
03:11:03,919 --> 03:11:05,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's be real.

2993
03:11:05,680 --> 03:11:07,081
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that's Twitter topics.

2994
03:11:07,101 --> 03:11:09,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

2995
03:11:11,403 --> 03:11:12,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody's calling.

2996
03:11:12,404 --> 03:11:13,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody wants to say hi.

2997
03:11:13,524 --> 03:11:14,025
[SPEAKER_06]: How sad.

2998
03:11:14,485 --> 03:11:15,745
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on, call us.

2999
03:11:16,926 --> 03:11:18,247
[SPEAKER_01]: We won't yell at you much.

3000
03:11:18,687 --> 03:11:20,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Fifth Dream in chat says that's who they voted for.

3001
03:11:21,786 --> 03:11:25,408
[SPEAKER_08]: So, River City Ransom 2 is supposed to be getting a Kickstarter.

3002
03:11:25,469 --> 03:11:26,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wait, here, here.

3003
03:11:26,970 --> 03:11:29,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, no, she read that during the Rapid Fire News.

3004
03:11:29,051 --> 03:11:29,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

3005
03:11:29,671 --> 03:11:33,334
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to remind everybody to kickstart it when it actually comes online.

3006
03:11:33,514 --> 03:11:34,495
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not the real thing.

3007
03:11:34,515 --> 03:11:35,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Who cares?

3008
03:11:36,836 --> 03:11:38,637
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be Kunio or it's nothing else.

3009
03:11:38,718 --> 03:11:40,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, Among the Sleep looks awesome.

3010
03:11:40,679 --> 03:11:41,559
[SPEAKER_08]: I kickstarted that one.

3011
03:11:42,460 --> 03:11:49,005
[SPEAKER_08]: Among the Sleep, it's the one, it's a survivor horror, the horror game where you play as a two-year-old from the perspective of a two-year-old.

3012
03:11:49,025 --> 03:11:49,705
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3013
03:11:50,065 --> 03:11:51,046
[SPEAKER_01]: I would play the hell out of that.

3014
03:11:51,601 --> 03:11:54,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Kickstarting, right now, they need money It's not over yet

3015
03:12:16,511 --> 03:12:19,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, our listeners are being shy tonight.

3016
03:12:19,273 --> 03:12:19,734
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, come on.

3017
03:12:19,754 --> 03:12:20,394
[SPEAKER_01]: Give them one more chance.

3018
03:12:20,535 --> 03:12:21,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, one more chance.

3019
03:12:21,375 --> 03:12:25,359
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll leave it open a little bit longer here.

3020
03:12:25,559 --> 03:12:26,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I didn't do... Thank you.

3021
03:12:26,700 --> 03:12:27,460
[SPEAKER_06]: This is how we can fill time.

3022
03:12:27,480 --> 03:12:28,041
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, listless.

3023
03:12:28,281 --> 03:12:29,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Listless results.

3024
03:12:29,122 --> 03:12:30,163
[SPEAKER_01]: And you didn't do Twitter topics, did you?

3025
03:12:30,283 --> 03:12:30,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

3026
03:12:30,883 --> 03:12:32,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I did.

3027
03:12:32,685 --> 03:12:33,445
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't paying attention.

3028
03:12:33,646 --> 03:12:34,026
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, right?

3029
03:12:34,466 --> 03:12:35,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody's out of it tonight.

3030
03:12:35,607 --> 03:12:39,270
[SPEAKER_06]: These sound problems just snowballed into LOL.

3031
03:12:39,631 --> 03:12:41,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's go over listless results now.

3032
03:12:44,056 --> 03:12:45,658
[SPEAKER_06]: You know why I didn't do listless results?

3033
03:12:45,678 --> 03:12:47,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Because in my head, I already know.

3034
03:12:47,079 --> 03:12:48,400
[SPEAKER_06]: I already tabulated them up.

3035
03:12:48,961 --> 03:12:49,582
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, here we go.

3036
03:12:49,622 --> 03:12:51,163
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't live in your head, thank God.

3037
03:12:51,404 --> 03:12:54,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Here it is, the definitive list as voted on by the listeners.

3038
03:12:54,687 --> 03:12:56,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Mascot, we are going to donate to Sega.

3039
03:12:57,048 --> 03:13:01,470
[SPEAKER_06]: In a close fourth place, worth mentioning, Master System the Sega Robot.

3040
03:13:01,490 --> 03:13:03,991
[SPEAKER_06]: In a very close fourth place.

3041
03:13:04,612 --> 03:13:08,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, the way the listeners voted tonight is really perfect, I've got to say.

3042
03:13:08,733 --> 03:13:10,674
[SPEAKER_06]: So I cannot argue with this at all.

3043
03:13:11,155 --> 03:13:11,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Number three.

3044
03:13:12,355 --> 03:13:15,196
[SPEAKER_06]: The number three answer for mascot we will donate to Sega.

3045
03:13:15,657 --> 03:13:18,278
[SPEAKER_06]: An amalgamation of all of Sonic's shitty friends.

3046
03:13:19,358 --> 03:13:20,519
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the one I would have voted for.

3047
03:13:21,141 --> 03:13:22,102
[SPEAKER_06]: There it is, number three.

3048
03:13:22,782 --> 03:13:27,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Number two, as voted by the listeners, President Cat.

3049
03:13:27,645 --> 03:13:28,726
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay.

3050
03:13:28,746 --> 03:13:29,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Fair enough, fair enough.

3051
03:13:29,607 --> 03:13:30,387
[SPEAKER_01]: We love you, Rina.

3052
03:13:30,767 --> 03:13:36,331
[SPEAKER_06]: And the number one answer of mascot, we will, and I don't know how we're going to do this.

3053
03:13:36,391 --> 03:13:39,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I can get somebody to put together a little clip art, something for us.

3054
03:13:39,373 --> 03:13:41,875
[SPEAKER_06]: We can actually send this to Sega, like a nice little envelope.

3055
03:13:42,275 --> 03:13:49,120
[SPEAKER_06]: The number one answer that we will gift on behalf of OLR, a forklift, ladies and gentlemen.

3056
03:13:50,000 --> 03:13:50,901
[SPEAKER_06]: A forklift.

3057
03:13:52,362 --> 03:13:53,122
[SPEAKER_06]: I approve.

3058
03:13:53,882 --> 03:13:55,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Does the forklift have a name?

3059
03:13:55,303 --> 03:13:58,364
[SPEAKER_00]: A forklift one out of all the crazy things Rob would have had to dress up in?

3060
03:13:58,724 --> 03:13:59,004
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?

3061
03:13:59,665 --> 03:14:00,225
[SPEAKER_00]: And Loki.

3062
03:14:00,525 --> 03:14:01,085
[SPEAKER_01]: Forky.

3063
03:14:02,406 --> 03:14:04,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Forky the forklift.

3064
03:14:04,927 --> 03:14:05,447
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

3065
03:14:06,228 --> 03:14:06,708
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll draw it.

3066
03:14:07,008 --> 03:14:10,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Can't the name be QQQQ so it's Forky the forklift?

3067
03:14:11,150 --> 03:14:13,051
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god, that's great.

3068
03:14:14,311 --> 03:14:15,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Forky the forklift.

3069
03:14:15,852 --> 03:14:17,052
[SPEAKER_06]: And then he comes into that song.

3070
03:14:17,072 --> 03:14:17,733
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's Taku.

3071
03:14:21,792 --> 03:14:22,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, there it is.

3072
03:14:22,453 --> 03:14:23,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Your winner of the list tonight.

3073
03:14:23,533 --> 03:14:28,477
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't give that disapproving... It's funny and you know it.

3074
03:14:28,497 --> 03:14:29,658
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my default look.

3075
03:14:30,078 --> 03:14:30,819
[SPEAKER_05]: You're so mean.

3076
03:14:34,241 --> 03:14:35,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes I wish it were a TV show.

3077
03:14:35,562 --> 03:14:38,324
[SPEAKER_01]: Dungeon Buster wants to see the forklift fight the Daytona car.

3078
03:14:38,344 --> 03:14:40,106
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

3079
03:14:40,126 --> 03:14:41,267
[SPEAKER_01]: The forklift would fight dirty.

3080
03:14:42,808 --> 03:14:44,629
[SPEAKER_06]: It would just get under the car and flip it.

3081
03:14:45,229 --> 03:14:48,532
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Daytona car has the power of AM2 behind it.

3082
03:14:51,400 --> 03:14:52,321
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.

3083
03:14:52,461 --> 03:14:52,761
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

3084
03:14:53,362 --> 03:14:55,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, the Skype line not lighting up.

3085
03:14:55,123 --> 03:14:56,044
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up with y'all?

3086
03:14:56,704 --> 03:14:58,145
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to close it.

3087
03:14:58,206 --> 03:14:58,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

3088
03:14:58,626 --> 03:14:59,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe Skype screwed up.

3089
03:14:59,707 --> 03:15:00,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

3090
03:15:00,347 --> 03:15:01,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything else is screwed up on a nice show.

3091
03:15:01,928 --> 03:15:02,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not Skype?

3092
03:15:02,409 --> 03:15:03,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not Skype?

3093
03:15:03,149 --> 03:15:03,450
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

3094
03:15:03,790 --> 03:15:07,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that is about going to wrap it up for another episode of Orange Launch Radio.

3095
03:15:07,333 --> 03:15:11,156
[SPEAKER_06]: But before we go around and get all the final thoughts tonight, I really want to thank our guests for being here tonight.

3096
03:15:11,876 --> 03:15:14,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Tim, I'm glad we could pop your podcast cherry.

3097
03:15:15,786 --> 03:15:17,367
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to have you do it.

3098
03:15:18,908 --> 03:15:20,169
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm glad that you liked my gift.

3099
03:15:21,130 --> 03:15:22,071
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, thank you very much.

3100
03:15:22,091 --> 03:15:24,272
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to slap you when we get home tonight.

3101
03:15:25,793 --> 03:15:27,414
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that a little TMI?

3102
03:15:27,515 --> 03:15:29,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on, you guys.

3103
03:15:30,016 --> 03:15:33,939
[SPEAKER_06]: But good luck with whatever it is you guys are working on next.

3104
03:15:34,520 --> 03:15:38,102
[SPEAKER_06]: And thanks for talking about how you got into gaming and all that stuff with us tonight.

3105
03:15:38,382 --> 03:15:39,143
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, it was my pleasure.

3106
03:15:39,763 --> 03:15:43,446
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a Twitter or anything you might... If listeners want to follow you further or whatever...

3107
03:15:43,982 --> 03:16:10,321
[SPEAKER_00]: sure I Tim TRP at Twitter I'm sort of Tim TRP at everything because I have no imagination if you have any more questions for me or questions about you know getting into the game industry or whatever I'm happy to happy to talk to you about it all right awesome I'll be sure to give you my resume Captain Spike it's about fucking time you came back to the show thanks for being here I literally haven't seen you in years even if you are so mean to me all of the time but that's all right

3108
03:16:10,521 --> 03:16:12,042
[SPEAKER_05]: I am mean to you all the time.

3109
03:16:12,282 --> 03:16:14,242
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like my second favorite thing to do.

3110
03:16:14,462 --> 03:16:16,683
[SPEAKER_06]: But it comes out of a place of love, or at least it better.

3111
03:16:18,164 --> 03:16:19,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, we can go with that.

3112
03:16:19,884 --> 03:16:20,384
[SPEAKER_06]: You dick.

3113
03:16:20,464 --> 03:16:20,744
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

3114
03:16:22,265 --> 03:16:24,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Gamebuoy.org if they want to hear your own show.

3115
03:16:25,406 --> 03:16:29,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's terribly... Which I take back every nice thing I said about it earlier in the show.

3116
03:16:29,627 --> 03:16:32,468
[SPEAKER_05]: It's terribly unlikely given how big of a dick I've been tonight.

3117
03:16:33,068 --> 03:16:36,890
[SPEAKER_05]: But on the off chance anyone does care, gamebuoy.org...

3118
03:16:38,684 --> 03:16:59,626
[SPEAKER_05]: gaming news and views that aren't on your radar but maybe should be we'd really appreciate the hits and I just want to say so much thank all three of you so much for having me here tonight it's actually been quite a bit of fun and I really do wish it hadn't been like seven years since last time I was on well make better and come back on a more regular basis at some point I would love to fantastic love it

3119
03:17:00,086 --> 03:17:00,366
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

3120
03:17:01,506 --> 03:17:04,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts so we can close up shop tonight.

3121
03:17:06,088 --> 03:17:07,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, who doesn't have a microphone?

3122
03:17:07,728 --> 03:17:09,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, do you have a final thought tonight?

3123
03:17:09,589 --> 03:17:10,909
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish my microphone worked.

3124
03:17:12,290 --> 03:17:12,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Fair enough.

3125
03:17:13,570 --> 03:17:14,810
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?

3126
03:17:15,051 --> 03:17:16,231
[SPEAKER_01]: My throat feels like a desert.

3127
03:17:17,251 --> 03:17:20,392
[SPEAKER_06]: And my final thought tonight is haters to the left.

3128
03:17:23,873 --> 03:17:26,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Captain Spike, your final thought tonight?

3129
03:17:28,555 --> 03:17:29,695
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate you so much.

3130
03:17:31,912 --> 03:17:36,034
[SPEAKER_06]: And last but not least, Tim, your final thoughts tonight?

3131
03:17:36,435 --> 03:17:42,838
[SPEAKER_00]: I just ate some potato chips that taste like they're Doritos, and they taste like Doritos tacos.

3132
03:17:43,459 --> 03:17:45,400
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the computer science world, we call that recursion.

3133
03:17:47,412 --> 03:17:48,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Recursive Chips.

3134
03:17:50,274 --> 03:17:50,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Love it.

3135
03:17:51,074 --> 03:17:55,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys so much for downloading and listening to our show or listening to it live or however you participate.

3136
03:17:55,357 --> 03:17:56,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for being a part of Orange Lounge Radio.

3137
03:17:57,118 --> 03:18:03,841
[SPEAKER_06]: If you like what you heard, all we ask is tell a friend or two about the show because we don't have $35,000 to promote our show.

3138
03:18:04,282 --> 03:18:05,542
[SPEAKER_06]: No tea, no shade.

3139
03:18:05,803 --> 03:18:06,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Shade that wave.

3140
03:18:07,123 --> 03:18:08,244
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm totally judging right now.

3141
03:18:09,151 --> 03:18:10,513
[SPEAKER_06]: but we would really appreciate it.

3142
03:18:10,553 --> 03:18:12,054
