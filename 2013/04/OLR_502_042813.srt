00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,440
Today, April 28th, 2013, Microsoft sets a date to announce their next move.

2
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,520
More video games are set to become movies, and can you really get pizza delivered with

3
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,520
your 360?

4
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:36,320
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of Orange

5
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,760
Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,720
It's the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,120
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'll be joining you to talk about video games, and gaming

8
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,920
culture, and the gamer lifestyle over the next few hours with my co-hosts.

9
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,080
First off, say hello to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,080
Hello.

11
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,080
How are you, Jamie Summers?

12
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,440
Um, uh, sated.

13
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,440
Sated or satiated?

14
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,440
Could you do that pizza?

15
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,120
But wouldn't that be- Oh, whatever.

16
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,120
Alright.

17
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,400
Well, uh, grammar specifics aside- And, and, um, just to tell PrinceBrightStar,

18
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,320
I've been playing PSO, too.

19
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,720
What is, what is, what is the, what did he ask?

20
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,720
I missed it.

21
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,280
Well, he mentioned Phantasy Star Online, too, so he's just affirming that, yes, I did get

22
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,280
everything to work.

23
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,520
Awesome.

24
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,280
Was that with all the patches and all that stuff?

25
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,880
Yes, but I have to re-patch my game and re-do the translations and blah, and I've had other

26
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,400
stuff to play.

27
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,480
Alright, also say hello to TechMasterLoki.

28
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,480
Hi.

29
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,760
How are you, Loki?

30
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,760
Doing good.

31
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,760
Good.

32
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,760
What's new with you?

33
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,760
I'm collecting drugs.

34
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,760
You're collecting drugs?

35
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:43,440
Well, I'm finishing my pickups on, uh, the collectibles in Saints Row the Third.

36
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,720
Ah, I see what you did there.

37
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,720
Okay.

38
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,520
Uh, I thought you were all done with Saints Row the Third.

39
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,040
I am, but- It's like a platinum trophy thing.

40
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,040
Sort of.

41
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,040
It's on Steam, though.

42
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,040
Oh, okay.

43
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,040
Fair enough.

44
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,040
Same, same.

45
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,600
Alright, um, we have some guests joining us in the studio tonight, and I'm really excited

46
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,240
about this because, um, these are guys I've been trying to get on the show for a very,

47
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,960
very, very, very, very long time.

48
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,080
Uh, these guys are long-time friends of mine, and, um, I think one of them was here, like,

49
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,600
seven years ago, but how many of you are listening then?

50
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,680
Like 98% of you, this is all new.

51
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:19,360
Please say hello, everybody, to, from the GameBui.org podcast, say hello to Captain

52
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,360
Spike.

53
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,360
Hi!

54
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,360
Hi!

55
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,360
How are you, Spike?

56
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,000
Uh, doing pretty good, thank you for having me.

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,640
No problem!

58
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,400
And also joining us in the studio tonight, say hello to Tim!

59
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,400
Hello!

60
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,800
How are you, Tim?

61
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,960
I am quaking in my boots.

62
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,800
This is my first podcast ever.

63
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,800
Is it really?

64
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,800
Yep.

65
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,680
Wow, you're like- This is also Rob's first podcast, though.

66
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,200
So, we've stolen your, uh, guest virginity.

67
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,200
I suppose so.

68
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,040
I'm a little bit uncomfortable thinking about it that way.

69
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,160
You even got the little virginity music playing there in the background.

70
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,640
So yeah, there's, like, every idiot has a podcast in this day and age.

71
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:04,180
No disrespect to those of you doing podcasts, but, like, Captain Spike, I'm calling myself

72
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,180
an idiot.

73
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:09,280
But no, like, you know, it's so easy to do that these days, it's really surprising to

74
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,440
me, you've never done this before.

75
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,080
But we'll be gentle, I promise.

76
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,080
Thank you.

77
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,080
All right, you're welcome.

78
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,080
Um, so I wanted to-

79
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,080
Break out the feathers.

80
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,520
Before we get into, like, how was your gaming week and all that, I want to talk to you guys

81
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,640
kind of, like, about, like, the things you guys do.

82
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,160
So I'm gonna start with Spike.

83
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,560
So a few years ago, um, I know you came on OLR, like, seven years ago, that was back

84
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,440
when I lived with Xtifer, right?

85
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,440
It sure was, yeah.

86
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,080
Do you remember what we even talked about then?

87
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,880
I have no idea.

88
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,880
How did you and I meet?

89
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,240
Tell the listeners.

90
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,560
The internet, Adam.

91
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,600
And then, you know, you know, we were on a message board, there was a, you know, IRL

92
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:52,400
meetup party, we went to said party independently, got drunk, and smoked cloves outside for like

93
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,400
an hour.

94
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,400
Don't smoke, guys.

95
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,400
It's bad for you.

96
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,400
No, smoking is bad.

97
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,400
Yeah, so we quit.

98
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,400
Okay, I have to ask.

99
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,400
They were the dejarmes, right?

100
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,400
Oh, I'm sure.

101
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,400
Oh, death.

102
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,960
Like there's anything other.

103
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:07,720
Um, so, so fast forward to today, you've got your podcast now.

104
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,880
Tell us about Game Buoy.

105
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:14,240
Yeah, so I host the gamebuoy.org video game podcast.

106
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,520
Our sort of aim is just to pick up stories that are getting left off the radar of all

107
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:25,320
the blogs, sort of pick up stories on indies, JRPGs, just sort of, you know, niche genres

108
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,080
that maybe aren't getting the play that they really deserve in the news.

109
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,880
I joked earlier that any idiot can have a podcast, and obviously, you know, I'm not

110
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,680
being rude with that, but it's like, it is so easy to do it now, but, but surely you

111
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,800
kind of have to take that step, like, why do I want to do a podcast?

112
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,440
So why, Captain Spike, did you want to do a podcast?

113
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,400
Well, you know, fitting in with what I just said, it kind of irritates me that, and, you

114
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,960
know, certainly no offense to any podcast, any podcasters that are listening to this,

115
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,360
but I really wanted to cover some bases that I feel like aren't getting a lot of coverage.

116
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,640
That's fair.

117
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:03,480
Especially, you know, we started, um, Retronauts was sort of kind of going away and we have

118
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,680
a real strong retro bent to sort of what we do, so.

119
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,720
And you didn't need $35,000 to do this.

120
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,000
No tea, no shade.

121
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
No, all tea, all shade.

122
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,720
We do it for free.

123
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,160
We spend money on it.

124
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,760
So no, we're not getting paid.

125
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,760
Okay.

126
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,320
Well, that's, but I like, I like that you guys have a niche and you know, I've had people

127
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,200
ask me before because we've had, have, have had this podcast a long, long, long, long

128
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
time.

129
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,520
Sometimes people will ask when they want to get into a podcast like, Hey, Rob, how do

130
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,520
I start a podcast?

131
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,320
And usually my first thing is, okay, if you're going to start a video game podcast, I'm going

132
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,320
to warn you.

133
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,160
It's a very, there's a lot of people in this pool and people have peed in this pool and

134
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,200
yeah, it's kind of gross.

135
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,440
There's a lot of stuff, but you got to find your niche.

136
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,160
You've got to be like, how am I going to stand out amongst this?

137
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,200
You know, how am I going to wear the prettiest bathing suit?

138
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,000
It's going to get me noticed, right?

139
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,360
So you guys have your niche and I think it's, it's, it's fun because you guys don't like

140
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,200
just talk about under the radar news, but I noticed you kind of theme a lot of your

141
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
episodes.

142
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,560
So you'll have like your one big topic that keeps a lot of your shows timeless in a way

143
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,560
I noticed.

144
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,320
Well, that was, you know, very much a conscious choice, but, um, we, we really wanted to have

145
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:15,080
sort of a level of intellectual discourse about sort of these big topics that a lot

146
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,200
of people maybe don't talk about and have, you know, real discussions about.

147
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,200
Gotcha.

148
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,280
So it's, it's you and you and, uh, what do you call him on the show?

149
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,280
I know his real name.

150
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,280
What's his first mate?

151
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,280
Slidekick.

152
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,280
That is that his first mate.

153
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,280
Slidekick.

154
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,280
Yeah.

155
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,280
Yeah.

156
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,280
And you guys, you guys have been buds forever, right?

157
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,520
I've known that guy for, I don't know, probably 10 years nearly.

158
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,520
Yeah.

159
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,220
And Slidekick's my frenemy in the wow podcasting community.

160
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,220
So that's always a lot of fun.

161
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,220
Yeah.

162
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,220
Heart, heart, heart, heart.

163
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,340
You all might remember his classic show, Fabulous Flames.

164
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,340
I still have episodes on my phone.

165
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,780
So you were the subscriber.

166
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,780
That was me.

167
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,780
I'm just kidding.

168
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,180
You were their leech and a fan.

169
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:58,180
I would, it was when I ran out of history podcasts and I was like, well, there's always

170
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,460
this one and I'd sit in my cube snorting the whole time.

171
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,460
People were like, what do you want?

172
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:07,780
But we didn't come here just to shade, you know, Slidekick cause I was always in chat

173
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,540
and everything.

174
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,540
You're so mean.

175
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,960
Um, so let me talk, let me talk about like you as a gamer.

176
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,220
So obviously you must've been into all the music games and stuff like we were cause you

177
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,820
were on the show at that time.

178
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,100
Um, what, how did you get into gaming at all?

179
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,060
Like how did you start playing video games?

180
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,740
What, what, what hooked you into this?

181
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,100
Why are you a gamer?

182
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,100
Um, why am I a gamer?

183
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:34,360
Um, my mother worked in a bowling alley and they had tons of arcade games.

184
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,880
So I kind of fell in love with Kung Fu and you know, the old Irem game, I think it was

185
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,520
Irem, I don't know.

186
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:48,720
And uh, after that, you know, got a Nintendo for the NES port Kung Fu and went from there.

187
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,720
Awesome.

188
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,040
What, what's like your favorite video games ever?

189
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,240
What are like your favorite things that have ever been done?

190
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,760
Uh, Super Mario World and Bayonetta.

191
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,120
Bayonetta is one of your top games ever.

192
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:06,840
I think it has some of the best, uh, like situational awareness in a 3d action game

193
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,840
that I've ever seen.

194
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,840
Yeah.

195
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,840
Interesting.

196
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,940
I really liked the way that it visually communicates what it expects of you in terms of reaction

197
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,940
and what have you.

198
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,000
Those are just, they're not two games you would typically expect to see sitting together.

199
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,760
Like if I'm, if I'm going to the video game museum, I'm not going to see Mario World next

200
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,760
to Bayonetta.

201
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,080
But no, I think that's great.

202
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,720
You know, a lot of people don't usually dare to name for all practical purposes a current

203
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,720
game.

204
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:38,800
I think it's super well designed and you know, I think that Super Mario World is certainly

205
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,040
the best 2d, best designed 2d platformer.

206
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:46,200
Um, you know, so you must've been excited about virtual console this week.

207
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,200
Yeah.

208
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,920
The first thing I did was download it and play it until my, uh, second player rage quit

209
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,920
on me.

210
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,440
Sorry about, uh, magic Koopa.

211
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,440
No, that is crap.

212
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,280
Um, gosh, what else I want to ask you about games?

213
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,280
Um, okay.

214
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:07,400
Bayonetta 2 then, and this whole, it's exclusive for Nintendo, like where, where are you at

215
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,400
with Nintendo?

216
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,400
Where's your head at?

217
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:14,800
Because some people are very like, Nintendo sucks and it's a kitty thing and dah, dah,

218
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,800
dah, dah.

219
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,260
But here they are coming out with Bayonetta 2, like where's your head out with that?

220
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,300
I think they make a lot of really bad business choices.

221
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:27,980
I think that, um, you know, them paying for Bayonetta 2 to exist is awesome, but probably

222
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,740
also a bad business choice.

223
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,820
But it's one I'm certainly going to benefit from.

224
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,820
So I'm happy.

225
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,920
Uh, go to our chat room.

226
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:41,260
We always have the other guests on our show, the live chat room, live.vognetwork.com because

227
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:45,180
we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right

228
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,220
after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

229
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:53,580
And looking at our chat room, we see some comments such as, um, let's see, Dungeon Buster

230
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,280
says Bayonetta rocks.

231
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,500
Tiger Claw says Kung Fu was one of those games that were quarter munchers.

232
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,080
Once you had the NES version, you blow right through the entire game.

233
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,360
Absolutely true.

234
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,360
That's true.

235
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,880
And then does it, does it lose something though?

236
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,080
Once you play it on the console, like can you go back and play it in the arcade now

237
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,460
that you've just beat it?

238
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:14,460
No, but I mean, you know why I didn't really want to either.

239
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,780
I was too busy, you know, taking my picture with my TV and trying to get in to the pages

240
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:22,540
of Nintendo fun club, Nintendo power, you know.

241
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,540
Awesome.

242
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,580
Uh, let's see.

243
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:31,740
And going to, um, Ross DOUT says arcade games were nonsensically hard in order to drain

244
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,740
quarters.

245
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,740
Of course they were.

246
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,740
I always think of that.

247
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:40,060
Um, you remember Wayne's world, which turned 20 years old apparently this month.

248
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,220
How old does that make you feel at me feel right now?

249
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,220
Right.

250
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,220
He's 20 years old.

251
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,220
Right.

252
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:49,740
So there's a scene where they're talking about the arcade and the guy goes, yeah, we just

253
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,740
got this new game.

254
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,500
But when you killed the gelatinous cube, you get to go to the next level.

255
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,340
The trick is there is no gelatinous cube.

256
00:10:55,340 --> 00:11:00,940
He never shows up and I'm like, Oh, that's like so old arcade machine.

257
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,940
Like I love it.

258
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:06,100
That's up there with the boss of carnival being named token taker.

259
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,460
Uh, let's see.

260
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:15,180
And um, slide kick in chat, uh, agreeing with Tim apparently saying magic Koopa is a ratchet

261
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,180
hoe.

262
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,180
There you go.

263
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,180
Thank you.

264
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,180
Slidekick.

265
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,180
All right.

266
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,740
Um, so if people want to check out your podcast, which I do recommend, it's, it's a, it's a

267
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,740
great listen.

268
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:28,500
Even if you guys are only doing it every other week and I'd like to see you do it more often,

269
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,500
but no pressure.

270
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,500
What's with that?

271
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,940
What you're being so rude.

272
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,940
That's a compliment.

273
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,940
I am a guest.

274
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,940
No, that's a compliment.

275
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,380
That means I want more of it.

276
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,380
Right.

277
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,380
How's that a bad thing?

278
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,380
Okay.

279
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,140
Good things come to those who wait.

280
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,140
That's true.

281
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,740
Um, you know, the easiest way to hear us is just to go over to a game, buoy.org.

282
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:53,620
Um, but you know, we're also on iTunes game, buoy podcast, hard to miss.

283
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:59,580
And the art actually looks like a little game boy, but get it boy.

284
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,580
It's great.

285
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,580
I like it.

286
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,580
All right.

287
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:05,620
Um, what, uh, Oh, let me ask one other question about your podcast.

288
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:10,780
Um, you, since, since you have a lot of like timeless segments, a lot of your shows, you

289
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:14,180
know, are, are, you can go back and listen to it now, even though some of the news might

290
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:17,620
be outdated, you know, the, you got a good, good chunk that's timeless.

291
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,420
What do you think is one of like your best episodes of the ones you've done so far?

292
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:23,780
Like if I, if I need to go back and find like a good conversation, which one would you like

293
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,100
recommend most?

294
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,100
Okay.

295
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:32,100
So, um, the longest episode we've done so far is that we did sort of a breakdown on

296
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:40,460
the narrative themes and tropes of Bioshock infinite, um, a game, which as a game, I was

297
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:45,580
kind of not really super satisfied with, but I thought actually did some interesting things

298
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:49,540
from a storytelling standpoint, which is not something I normally even think about in terms

299
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,540
of games.

300
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,780
We talked about that for a couple of hours and I was really happy with how it, how it

301
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:59,260
came out, uh, despite it being unpleasantly long.

302
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,460
Well, you know what?

303
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:05,380
This show's really unpleasantly long most every week, so it's all good.

304
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:12,380
Um, and we also, uh, we had a pretty in-depth discussion on, uh, LGBT issues in games, um,

305
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,540
and we're actually going to do a follow up on that this summer.

306
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,920
So I'm very excited.

307
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:22,380
This is a good part to plug the gamer X panel that is coming up, uh, the gamer X is what

308
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,360
the first weekend in August in San Francisco, right?

309
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,900
And so a bunch of us are all teaming up to do a panel, but the panels are being voted

310
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:35,620
on right now at gamerconnect.com and our panel is podcast X zone, right?

311
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,700
And it's going to be, and I hope I don't miss anybody.

312
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,780
It's going to be, I'm representing OLR and we're going to, we're hopefully getting some

313
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,980
folks from courthouse too.

314
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:47,900
And then of course, game buoy podcast, uh, the Koopa club guys out of Chicago are coming

315
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,900
out.

316
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,900
They're going to be there.

317
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,580
And, uh, well game bar I think has representation, right?

318
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,140
Am I leaving anybody out so far?

319
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,500
I think it's those shows.

320
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,540
I think that's it.

321
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:00,460
Although we are in talks with a couple other other podcasts for representation.

322
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,460
Yes.

323
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,180
So, um, podcast X zone at gamer connects, it's going to be fun.

324
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,740
And I hear they're announcing the guests for gamer con later tonight.

325
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,740
So that's, um, that's exciting.

326
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,940
That's going to be a fun show.

327
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,220
Um, all right.

328
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,980
By the way, before I, before I turn to talk to Tim for a minute, I need to address, um,

329
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,180
some people are talking about my audio tonight that I sound a little different.

330
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:24,580
So when we were taping live on Bobby Black Wolf, like my usual mic, like died.

331
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:28,700
So in just a few minutes before we went live tonight, I kind of had to resort to a plan

332
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,380
B. So if I sound a little more distant than usual tonight, I apologize.

333
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,900
Uh, it's just, you know, we had to do a last minute switch or you wouldn't be able to hear

334
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,900
us at all.

335
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,380
We replaced Rob with a pod person.

336
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,460
Well, I guess I sound a little more distant and I can even see like my levels aren't coming

337
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,460
up as usual.

338
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:47,700
And I just don't have the time, like trying to fix it on the fly and I kind of can't like,

339
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:52,540
I'll try to make it a little louder, but, um, hopefully it won't sound too terrible

340
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:56,460
when I listen back to it later because, uh, Shane's messaging me in the chat, like you're

341
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:00,140
going to hate listening to this later because you sound off.

342
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,660
That's probably accurate.

343
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,980
All right.

344
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,980
Um, anyhow, let's move on.

345
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,540
Uh, Tim, you don't have a podcast.

346
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:13,300
I don't, I'm sorry to hear that, but you know, you're, you're coming on our show the first

347
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,300
time.

348
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,300
It's a brand new world.

349
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,420
Uh, you work in the games industry.

350
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,420
I do.

351
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,420
Who do you work for?

352
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,420
I work for crystal dynamics.

353
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,540
And what, what would we know out of crystal dynamics?

354
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,820
Uh, we just released a game called Tomb Raider.

355
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,380
Oh, I think I've heard of that.

356
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,380
Yes.

357
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,380
Yeah.

358
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,460
Didn't you guys do that mad cross game that never came out?

359
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,460
No, that was crystal dreams.

360
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,460
Oh yeah.

361
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,420
Do you, do you get that?

362
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,940
Do people get confused with the other companies?

363
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:41,380
Like I know a telltale and traveler's tales all the time.

364
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,660
I don't think I've ever gotten confusion about who we are.

365
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:47,300
I think, uh, I've gotten a lot of people who, who wonder who are you and then I'll say something

366
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,740
like Tomb Raider or I'll say legacy of Kane and suddenly like, Oh, are you going to make

367
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,740
a new legacy of Kane?

368
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,140
Um, that's probably the most common question.

369
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,140
Are you?

370
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,140
No comment.

371
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,140
Of course.

372
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,140
Of course.

373
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,140
All right.

374
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:03,740
No, I, I totally respect that obviously.

375
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:09,860
Um, uh, but there's, there's that DLC for guardian of light that you could go get it

376
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,860
right now.

377
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,860
Wasn't that enough?

378
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:12,860
Wasn't that enough?

379
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,460
Uh, what, what do you do?

380
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:17,900
So when you say you work on a game like Tomb Raider, what, what did you, what did you do?

381
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:23,140
So I am a software engineer, meaning I programmed the computers that make them do things.

382
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:27,700
Um, specifically I work in physics and collision and simulation.

383
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:33,500
So a lot of the stuff that moves based on your rigid body or cloth, uh, that was me.

384
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,500
So when something goes through a wall, we blame you?

385
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,900
Uh, sometimes you can blame me.

386
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,900
Or when the clothes clip.

387
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,300
When the clothes clip, you can definitely blame me.

388
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,300
Okay.

389
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,540
That's a good thing.

390
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,420
You didn't work on one of the games I played this week.

391
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,860
Cause there was that problem all over, not, not Tomb Raider, maybe clear, not Tomb Raider,

392
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,860
but something else.

393
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,380
I was like, wow, like I could see Tim playing this game and like twitching nervously as

394
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,460
he's playing it.

395
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,300
That tends to happen.

396
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,580
Does that happen when you play other games?

397
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,060
I you're like, this is, this is, I would have done this so different.

398
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,300
I'm always in that zone.

399
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,220
So I always see those things and that's what I'm looking at.

400
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,380
I'm looking at the performance of their physics.

401
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:10,100
I'm looking at the performance of all of their simulation stuff and I'm incredibly critical

402
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,500
and sensitive to those issues.

403
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,140
So specifically, what did you do for Tomb Raider?

404
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:18,100
Was it, was it all that, that you just named like the clothes and some of that?

405
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,100
Yeah.

406
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,820
All the, uh, you know, a lot of the puzzles are physics based.

407
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:25,260
That was sort of one of the design goals to make it sort of a living realistic world when

408
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,260
it's driven by physics.

409
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,780
It just feels right to your brain when you see it moving.

410
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,780
Well, yeah.

411
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,780
And when characters don't move right, people, you know, that's, that's one of the first

412
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:37,620
things games will get razzed for is like, like for instance, captain spike and I always

413
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:42,220
have this great debate about the game ice climber on the NES and I talk about how the

414
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,220
game is amazing.

415
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,220
There's no debate.

416
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,220
What?

417
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,220
There's no debate.

418
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,340
No, there's totally a debate.

419
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:52,740
And uh, the game is, but the characters jump really weird and it's like you have to get

420
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:57,180
used to the physics in the game before the game makes any, you know, sense.

421
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:01,140
So yeah, when physics are wrong, when especially a character's physics are wrong, you feel

422
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,340
it right away and you don't necessarily know what it is, but it just feels wrong to your

423
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,820
brain.

424
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,060
How long ago does a game like Tomb Raider start?

425
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,260
Like how long is the production cycle for a game like Tomb Raider?

426
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:13,260
How long ago did you know you're going to work on Tomb Raider?

427
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,260
About five years ago.

428
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,260
Oh my God.

429
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,260
Yeah.

430
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,260
It's been a while.

431
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,260
So how long did you have to keep that a secret?

432
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,260
Cause they only announced that what?

433
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,380
Two, two and a half years ago.

434
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:23,020
I had to keep that a secret for, yeah, probably about three years.

435
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,020
Oh my gosh.

436
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,020
It was that hard.

437
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,900
Um, not really.

438
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,900
I'm pretty antisocial.

439
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:34,180
That's the key to NDA.

440
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,180
Be a hermit.

441
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,180
Exactly.

442
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,620
You don't go on podcasts for one.

443
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:42,620
That's a good way to make sure.

444
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,020
How did you get into that?

445
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,260
Like what, or let me take a step back.

446
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,980
What made you say, I want to do physics and video games?

447
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,220
Like obviously you must've kind of narrowed your path as you went, but how did, how did

448
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,220
you end up where you're at?

449
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,620
You know, that's a good question.

450
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,500
I've been a science nerd all my life.

451
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,500
I've also been a computer nerd and there was this obvious cross section I didn't see at

452
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,940
the time, but you know, I went to, I went to undergrad for, for computer science and

453
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:09,540
later I went to grad school and I did some more computer graphics and gaming centric

454
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:15,780
studies and I sort of wanted to bring my science background into that and I found simulation

455
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,980
was sort of the perfect world for me to do some research in.

456
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,300
How'd you get hooked up with Crystal Dynamics?

457
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:31,220
Um, I had a ex classmate who worked there as an artist and he got me an interview and

458
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:35,060
I just happened to be at the right time that they were looking for someone, you know, straight

459
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,860
out of grad school and it was the perfect position for me.

460
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,860
So I sort of lucked out.

461
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:43,860
Tell them you know someone who does print material.

462
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:47,020
Stop trying to use this interview as a platform for your own agenda.

463
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,020
Um, okay.

464
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,260
Going back to Tomb Raider for a minute.

465
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:53,960
So like, you know, obviously a lot of people are playing this game right now.

466
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,660
I will re I will respect the situation and not bring up that story that everybody's talking

467
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:02,260
about when it comes to sales and all that, but the game's great.

468
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,260
Okay, that's you.

469
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:08,660
That's, you know, I even if you weren't my friend, I truly believe the game is great

470
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,500
and I think a lot of people feel the same way.

471
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:17,820
Um, how or when somebody like plays a game like Tomb Raider and you obviously do a lot

472
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:21,860
with the physics and the environments and so forth, what do you think people miss?

473
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:25,300
Like is there is there something that like you pay a special attention to detail to this,

474
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,340
but you think people I don't want to say this so that people don't appreciate it, but like

475
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:31,500
maybe it like goes unnoticed this, this work that you do?

476
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,980
Well, certainly there's a lot of different types of gamers who play Tomb Raider and you've

477
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,740
got the people who run right through the game and of course those people have to play the

478
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,340
puzzles, which are based on physics.

479
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,860
So that's sort of shoved in their face.

480
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:42,940
They can't miss that.

481
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:47,260
But there's a lot of nice little touches, little environmental effects, little rigid

482
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,900
bodies that are around the world to make the, you know, everything come to life.

483
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,460
Bits of cloth flapping in the breeze and that stuff, you know, we spend a good amount of

484
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,700
time on that to make that look good and natural and it makes the whole environment come alive,

485
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,660
but it's not something every gamer is going to sit and look at, they sort of will just

486
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,660
run by.

487
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:08,220
And of course there are the explorers who want to go around and explore every nook and

488
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,900
cranny and so they're going to see all those little things.

489
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,300
They're going to see every detail that's not correct.

490
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,500
That sounds like people that play Skyrim is probably a very similar approach.

491
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,980
You know, you have some people that are just like, I want to just kill all the villagers

492
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:18,980
and dah, dah, dah.

493
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:24,540
And then, you know, some people are like, I'm going to pick every flower to do, right?

494
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:28,100
Although it's a good thing, Laura Croft can't pick flowers or can she?

495
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,100
She can.

496
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,100
Oh my God.

497
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,100
There are plants to pick.

498
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,100
That's right.

499
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,420
I guess I'm one of those people who just wants to shoot.

500
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:39,680
Well, I'm having Resident Evil flashbacks, you mix the green herb.

501
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,500
And all of those plants that you can run past and then they rustle as you run past them

502
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,500
and move.

503
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,500
I made those.

504
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,940
Nice.

505
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:51,060
So I talked a minute ago about how the game is being well received.

506
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:56,100
Like is that when you go on Metacritic or one of those sites and you see that, you know,

507
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,140
overall the reception you're getting is positive.

508
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,220
Like is that is that important for somebody like you?

509
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:05,460
Like when you look at reviews and that positive affirmation, is that is that something you're

510
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,860
like, oh, I'm so happy to see that.

511
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,540
Or are you like, it doesn't really change anything?

512
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,860
You know, I'm really proud of the game.

513
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:17,660
I'm really happy with the whole thing and I'm really happy with the stuff that I did.

514
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:21,780
And I like to tell myself, I don't care what the reviews say, but I'll be honest.

515
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,780
I love praise.

516
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:28,220
So, I mean, being completely blunt here, it's great.

517
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,020
It is great to read those reviews.

518
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:35,020
And it is sad to read the ones that are not super glowing and they really like stick in

519
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,020
my craw.

520
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,020
But, uh, sure.

521
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,020
Sure.

522
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,660
It's, you know, it's the same thing when I go look up reviews for the show, like I'll

523
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,260
go on iTunes and they'll be five star reviews.

524
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:46,100
I'm like, oh, that person was so awesome to leave that five star review.

525
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,100
And that was awesome.

526
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:50,780
And then you go to like a one star review where, you know, it's like everybody's screaming

527
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:55,220
all the time and I'm just like, okay, I'm going to take that.

528
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:59,820
At least no one's told you to shut up and get in the kitchen.

529
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:00,820
Do you remember that one?

530
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,060
Did that really happen?

531
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:04,180
Yes, that really happened.

532
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,740
What is wrong with people?

533
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:08,540
This was like after our second year.

534
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:11,900
So yeah, I know what you mean.

535
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:15,340
Hey Rob, was that five star review from Mrs. Roberts?

536
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:21,220
No, it was from the other Mr. Roberts.

537
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,220
There's something about me you might not know.

538
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,740
I was implying that was your mother.

539
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,540
It was from Rob Robson.

540
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,580
Oh, uh, okay.

541
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:32,180
So everybody in chat is talking about the death scenes and they're like the death scenes,

542
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,180
the death scenes.

543
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,980
And, and did Tim, did Tim do all this stuff with the death scenes?

544
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:36,980
All right.

545
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,820
I, let me, let me ask you about, I think of when I think of Tomb Raider, I think of the

546
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,580
Conan O'Brien review.

547
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,580
Did you see the Conan O'Brien?

548
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,580
I did.

549
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,300
Did you all sit around in your office and watch it?

550
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,300
Oh yeah.

551
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:51,940
And there's that, there's that part where, you know, they're, they're doing the, the,

552
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:56,180
the tree thing over and over and over and they're playing it up for laughs like, but

553
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,580
that's kind of like a serious thing.

554
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,580
It is.

555
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,580
But did you, did you notice the, the quality of the laughs?

556
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,180
They weren't just, Oh, that's hilarious.

557
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:09,180
It was like every time it was first, Oh, then, then laughter like it didn't lose its impact

558
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,780
after they played it 10 times.

559
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,660
People were still cringing at it.

560
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:16,860
I mean, I've seen that, that hundreds of times and I still cringe when I see it.

561
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:17,860
It's kind of gross.

562
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,860
Just saying.

563
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:19,860
Oh yeah.

564
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:23,620
I think I've made my decision on what I'm getting on Steam.

565
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,420
I thought you already had the Tomb Raider.

566
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:30,300
No, cause I didn't have the money at the time.

567
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:34,940
You know, there's, there's things in Tomb Raider that are kind of like, I, I, I see

568
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,940
it.

569
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:40,340
I don't know if it was intentional, but I see elements of like Metroidvania, like that

570
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,980
type of thing that I don't think was really in Tomb Raider before, but I kind of see it

571
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,980
in there now.

572
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,700
Um, do you, do you draw inspiration from other games for Tomb Raider?

573
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,460
Cause I know you don't just play Tomb Raider all day, every day, like, cause clearly you're

574
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:55,220
wearing a Mass Effect hoodie, but I'm also wearing a Tomb Raider t-shirt.

575
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,220
Yeah, I know.

576
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,220
I know.

577
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,220
I know.

578
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:01,780
But, uh, since you don't just play Tomb Raider all day, every day, do you, do you get inspiration

579
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,780
from other games?

580
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:06,740
Do you, do you see things in other games that, you know, you, you want to do with Tomb Raider

581
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,740
or?

582
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,740
I do.

583
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,220
I'm not really the one making those decisions.

584
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,780
That's the creative and the design team.

585
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:17,620
So while there may be games that I like, and I think, Hey, we should, we should take, you

586
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,740
know, take this element from that game because it's awesome.

587
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,640
Cause there's something to learn there.

588
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,920
It's not going to go ignored, but it's really, it's not really my place.

589
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,900
It's not the, it's not the problems I'm trying to solve.

590
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:31,940
And there are far more creative and talented people at Crystal Dynamics solving those problems.

591
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:32,940
But yes, they do.

592
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:36,540
They definitely take inspiration from other games, from other media.

593
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:41,660
We got a lot of inspiration for this reboot from movies like The Descent and Rambo.

594
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,660
Oh my God.

595
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,660
It wasn't.

596
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,660
Okay.

597
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,900
So when I reviewed Tomb Raider on the show, I totally compared it to The Descent.

598
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,860
And I'm like, it is, it is totally like that movie.

599
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:53,060
We had some like shot for shot scene call-outs to scenes in The Descent.

600
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:57,180
We sat like as a studio back in pre-production, we sat around and we watched that movie.

601
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,180
It's so scary.

602
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,660
It scared the crap out of me.

603
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,660
I will never watch that movie again.

604
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,940
I saw that on the big screen.

605
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:02,940
Okay.

606
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,620
That movie creeped me out so hard.

607
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,620
Oh my gosh.

608
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:12,180
I still like what Alan called the game though, Lara Croft's really bad, no good, terrible,

609
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,180
very bad day.

610
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,820
Or whatever that book was.

611
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:20,940
No, I think he also just called it Girl.

612
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:25,260
So Girl is the first, the first girl game.

613
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:29,380
No, it's the first Tomb Raider game that has multiplayer, you know?

614
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,460
And so multiplayer, you know, I do the other show about Warcraft.

615
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,420
We talk about PvE and PvP all the time.

616
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,740
PvP is unpredictable.

617
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,380
You know, you don't know, you know what computers are going to do.

618
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:42,180
You know what attacks the, the, the, the, the boss monsters and so forth are going to

619
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,420
do, but you don't know what other people are going to do.

620
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:49,420
Does the unpredictability of multiplayer cause like different things when you're planning

621
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,620
environments and things like that?

622
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:53,620
Do you have to look at it, take a different approach to that or similar?

623
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,180
I actually didn't work on multiplayer.

624
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,180
What?

625
00:26:56,180 --> 00:27:01,100
Multiplayer was, was done by our sister studio up in Montreal, Eidos Montreal.

626
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:05,900
So it was made in a relative vacuum with the single player game.

627
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:12,020
We worked on single player in Redwood City and then in Montreal, they worked on multiplayer.

628
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:16,100
So of course there was a little bit of collaboration to keep things in sync, but I was not part

629
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,100
of the active development of that.

630
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,100
Interesting.

631
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,100
Okay.

632
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,100
Have you played the multiplayer?

633
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:24,180
I played a little bit of the multiplayer.

634
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:31,780
I shot some people and then I got killed about 10 times more than I shot people.

635
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:34,180
You also worked on Guardian of Light a few years ago, right?

636
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,340
I did for a little while.

637
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,260
I tend to bounce around at the studio.

638
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,260
That was good.

639
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,260
Yeah.

640
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,260
I liked Guardian of Light too.

641
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,260
Well, Guardian of Light was more like an arcade-y for me.

642
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,260
Yes, exactly.

643
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,260
I mean, that's not a bad thing.

644
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,660
It's just, you know, this was on Xbox Live Arcade.

645
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,040
This was supposed to happen, right?

646
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:51,020
So here's the thing though, is that here's what I don't understand about Guardian of

647
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:54,820
Light and I need help, is that, you know, you have the Guardian of Light game and that's

648
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:57,260
Laura, but then there's the reboot Laura.

649
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:02,200
So you've got, is there two Loras now or did this game kind of like, no, Guardian of Light,

650
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,900
you know, was like, it's not really about that anymore.

651
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,420
It's about like Laura or what?

652
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:09,100
Yeah, this game was a complete reboot.

653
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,340
We're going to start over.

654
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:14,340
We're going to create a brand new, you know, a brand new property.

655
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,200
We're going to do everything over.

656
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,300
So anything that happened beforehand, it all happened in the past.

657
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,660
It was a different game.

658
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,820
It was a different universe.

659
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,420
We want a fresh start.

660
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:26,360
We don't want to be, have any baggage from any other games.

661
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:30,820
So this is the equivalent of Marvel's Ultimate Universe.

662
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:35,420
I can't say I'm an expert in that, but yes, I suppose so.

663
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,420
Okay.

664
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:39,740
Except I think it will be less lame than the Ultimate Universe is sometimes.

665
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,740
All right.

666
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,740
Yeah.

667
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:44,740
Well, I'll stop, I'll stop bugging you about Tomb Raider because I know, you know, when

668
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:47,900
it comes to the day job, there's only so many things you can't, you do and you don't want

669
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,900
to say.

670
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,100
Let me, let me just turn it over to you for anything general.

671
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,260
Like, is there anything you want to tell the listeners about Tomb Raider or, you know,

672
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,940
about your work or what have you?

673
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:01,020
I really think you guys should all buy it.

674
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,780
Really appreciate that.

675
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:06,420
Actually, I should ask you a couple of the general things I asked him.

676
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:10,020
How did you get into just not, not even this Tomb Raider and programming and all this,

677
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,020
how did you get into just games?

678
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:14,060
Why are you like a video gamer?

679
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:17,540
I was a video gamer as far back as I can remember, like really young.

680
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:21,780
We had an Atari 2600 in the house.

681
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,500
No one else in my family cares about video games except for me.

682
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,500
My dad bought it because he thought it would be a hoot.

683
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,700
And then I sort of like, this is mine.

684
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,340
I want to, I want to have this all the time.

685
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:36,420
And so I always bugged them to buy me the new systems and I only got a few.

686
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,540
I got the NES.

687
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:41,060
They wouldn't buy me a Super Nintendo and that was the worst thing in the world.

688
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:46,940
But like the best thing in the world was to go over to like my cousin's house or certain

689
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:52,580
neighbors who had a Super Nintendo because that was, that was the coolest shit ever.

690
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,780
So I was a big computer nerd.

691
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,780
I liked to program.

692
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:59,620
When I first taught myself how to program, it was in Q basic and I, the first things

693
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:05,660
I did was try to make games and they were horrible, awful, like they weren't even games.

694
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:11,300
They were just like shapes floating around and weird sounds, but I was trying.

695
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:15,060
And so I sort of knew my calling from a very young age.

696
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,260
That's awesome.

697
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:20,340
So that's kind of, you just, you just started, you made your own little games and then it

698
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:23,380
just kept evolving and evolving and now you work in the industry.

699
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,380
Exactly.

700
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,380
That's awesome.

701
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:28,140
Do you have any advice for people that might be wanting to get into the games industry?

702
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,780
Like people listening to this show that are still in school, like, yeah, I kind of want

703
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,780
to, I want to work in games.

704
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,780
You have any advice?

705
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,780
Uh, yeah.

706
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,660
Uh, you know, make games.

707
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:39,380
A lot of people who want to go into games will go and say, I'm going to be a programmer

708
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,540
so I'm going to go do computer science or something.

709
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:45,060
But when they're done with that program, if they don't have anything to show that's related

710
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:50,180
to games, it's really hard to convince someone who can only hire two or three more engineers

711
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:53,780
that you're worth it compared to the other 20 people who want that job.

712
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:58,260
So as early as possible, start making games.

713
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,460
They don't have to be great.

714
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,900
You can start modding other games.

715
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,780
You can start scripting within packages.

716
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,940
You can use free engines like Unity.

717
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:10,340
There's a lot of resources out there.

718
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,880
So make as many games as you can.

719
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,740
Show people that you're passionate about it.

720
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,620
Uh, look at our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

721
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:21,180
Um, ActDeaf says your parents wouldn't buy you a Super Nintendo.

722
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,300
Worst parents ever.

723
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,700
They are the worst parents ever.

724
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,700
Never forgive them for that.

725
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,700
That's not nice.

726
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:32,100
I had to save up my own money to buy a Nintendo 64 when that came out.

727
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,580
I had to cut a lot of grass.

728
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,580
That's awesome.

729
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,580
Uh, let's see.

730
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,460
BlackWolf says I wrote games in Q Basic 2.

731
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:45,100
Did you ever play the Gorillaz game in Q Basic?

732
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,100
That was one of the samples.

733
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,460
It was like a game where you just throw bananas at each other.

734
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,460
It was great.

735
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,100
Did you do Q Basic 2, Loki?

736
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,940
I played around with Q Basic.

737
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,460
We like, I don't know.

738
00:31:55,460 --> 00:32:03,340
I change colors of things and, you know, I also have the strategy of setting the speed

739
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:07,460
of the banana to be super high so that you sort of clip through the buildings.

740
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:10,460
So you throw it and you get stuck in the middle of the building and you just keep throwing

741
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,660
it in a straight line to the next person.

742
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,740
Ah, the classic tunneling problem.

743
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:20,220
I just remember making the ball bounce on my Texas Instruments computer.

744
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,100
That was the extent of anything I've ever programmed.

745
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,300
Oh, the games I made on my TI-82.

746
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,300
I love that game.

747
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,820
See, I couldn't do any of that shit.

748
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:30,760
I just wanted to talk about games with all my friends.

749
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,760
I'm with you on this.

750
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,760
Right?

751
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,760
Look where we ended up.

752
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,220
See, now when I get a game, I have to mod it.

753
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:40,780
I had to drop out of my calculus class because that's all I did was play with my TI-82.

754
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:46,980
I was trying to make a Final Fantasy fighting game type thing and I got the engine done,

755
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,220
but I mean, the TI-82 sucks.

756
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,940
Well Square finally did one years later on the PSP, right?

757
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:52,940
Yeah.

758
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:56,820
There was a guy in my class who sat during the entire class and by the time he was done,

759
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:00,780
I was playing a pole position on his graphing calculator.

760
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,780
It was awesome.

761
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,780
Awesome.

762
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,180
Yeah, that's another good piece of advice, actually.

763
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,180
Start small.

764
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:09,740
You laugh at a TI-82, but the constraints there were so tight that it forces you to

765
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,740
be creative.

766
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:15,700
I will say, I used to play Commodore 64 all the time when I was younger and would do the

767
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:19,300
basic, but I would start to type in the programs that were in the back of magazines, right?

768
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:22,140
And then try to modify them a little bit to meet my needs.

769
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,540
If I changed a color or something, then I'd be like, I'm the shit.

770
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,540
I changed the color.

771
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,540
You know?

772
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,540
So I don't know.

773
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,540
This is me.

774
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,540
Okay.

775
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,540
One more question, then we're going to get into our gaming weeks.

776
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:35,980
But same thing I asked Spike a minute ago, what is like your favorite video game ever?

777
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,140
You're not allowed to name something you worked on.

778
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,500
Oh, damn it.

779
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,940
I'm taking that off the table right now.

780
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,260
So what's like your favorite video game ever?

781
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,020
You know what I'm really bad at?

782
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,020
Coming up with favorites.

783
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,020
Yeah?

784
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,020
Hmm.

785
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:54,900
Well, I'm wearing a jacket from Mass Effect and I'm a huge sci-fi nerd.

786
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,980
Mass Effect is one of my favorite series.

787
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,620
So Jamie's like...

788
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,620
That's why we're all friends.

789
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:03,020
We're great friends because of that.

790
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:07,820
But and to create a little controversy with Spike, Super Mario Brothers 3.

791
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,580
I'm going to say Super Mario Brothers 3.

792
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:13,660
Your opinion is wrong and you should feel bad for having it.

793
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,660
Is this like a thing?

794
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,140
It's a little bit of a thing.

795
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:19,340
Like Super Mario Brothers 3 versus Super Mario World?

796
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,340
Yeah.

797
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:23,980
A little bit comes from a place of bitterness for not owning Super Mario World, but...

798
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,420
Oh, so it goes back to that again.

799
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:33,940
Well Captain Spike, what's your problem with Mario 3 then?

800
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:37,940
He didn't know in Super Mario World because the parents wouldn't get him a Super Nintendo.

801
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:42,140
What's your hatred towards Super Mario Brothers 3?

802
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:45,660
If we're being completely honest, it's just me being a hipster.

803
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,980
Everyone loves it so I hate it.

804
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,940
I'm glad you said it because I was going to say it if you didn't.

805
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:49,940
Yeah, I knew you were.

806
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:50,940
That's why I cut you off.

807
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:53,500
What are your thoughts on Ocarina then?

808
00:34:53,500 --> 00:35:03,460
Oh, I am not a fan of Zelda at all except for Majora's Mask and Link's Awakening.

809
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:06,980
Well you know what guys, I think I'm going to help you guys out here with this whole

810
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,620
Mario Brothers 3 and Mario World thing.

811
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:14,420
There's really only one way we can solve this and that is to ask the audience, ladies and

812
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,420
gentlemen.

813
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:23,180
So I'm going to put up a live poll at live.vognetwork.com right now and the question goes like this.

814
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:29,460
Which is better, Mario 3, Super Mario World, or neither one, jeez.

815
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,060
I'm surprised you didn't put Super Metroid on that list.

816
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:36,660
No because this is about the Mario's there.

817
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:41,620
Remember you have to be a registered participant at live.vognetwork.com and you'll see that

818
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:44,540
pop up right there underneath the chat and you can vote in the poll.

819
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:50,180
Which is better, Mario 3, Super Mario World, or neither one, jeez.

820
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:53,300
Either it was Mario is missing.

821
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:57,140
Mario typing?

822
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,700
We'll get to the results here momentarily.

823
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:01,860
Looking at the results as they're coming in, of course it's tied.

824
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,540
I mean you said that, it switched.

825
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,380
Oh Mario World just took the lead.

826
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,860
And then there's someone who's like no one.

827
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:10,660
Oh look, it flipped again.

828
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,740
Someone did do a no one curve vote.

829
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:15,580
Yeah, oh Mario 3 just pulled way ahead.

830
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,580
We'll see.

831
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,580
Alright.

832
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,140
We'll get to the results for you here momentarily.

833
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:23,780
But first I think, first off thank you Tim, you did great for your first podcast.

834
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,980
I learned some stuff.

835
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,980
Thank you.

836
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:26,980
Thanks for having me.

837
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:27,980
No problem.

838
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:28,980
Thanks for dealing with me.

839
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:29,980
Please.

840
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,220
You'll stay here and comment randomly on other things throughout the show with Captain

841
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,220
Spike, right?

842
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,220
Yes?

843
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,220
Good?

844
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,220
Or no, you're out of here.

845
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,220
Bye.

846
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,220
No, just kidding.

847
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,220
Yeah, we're going to take the pizza and go.

848
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,500
Alright, let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have

849
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,400
been playing this week.

850
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,220
So Dark Soccer, why don't you start us off?

851
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,300
I figured out I'm old.

852
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,660
I played DDR last night.

853
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:52,740
I felt like death warmed over after I was done.

854
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:55,260
I can't beat an eight footer anymore, Rob.

855
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,780
Wait, I can't do superstar anymore, Rob.

856
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:03,140
Well, I don't think you're going to be able to just do it the first game either, you know?

857
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,140
You know what you need?

858
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,140
Hmm?

859
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,140
She needs a montage.

860
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,980
I do not need a freaking montage.

861
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:10,980
It's where you get better in a short amount of time.

862
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,980
That is true.

863
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:12,980
Gotta have a montage.

864
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:18,260
I'm actually, though, we're hooking back up the DDR pads in the front room because I have

865
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,260
nothing else to do.

866
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,860
I'm unemployed.

867
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:27,340
So I also, I guess I can say now that I'm playing it, even though I can't say anything

868
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:34,740
else about it, is I'm playing the beta Final Fantasy 14.

869
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:39,140
Yeah, they did a partial NDA lift on that tonight, which still doesn't make sense to

870
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,140
me.

871
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:44,260
You can talk about, what, character creation and Gridania, but you can't talk about anything

872
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,260
else.

873
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,260
I have a cat girl.

874
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,860
And I have a midget.

875
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,020
That's it.

876
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:52,140
And Gridania is full of trees.

877
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,140
How's that?

878
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,140
You think that works?

879
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,140
It's lovely.

880
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,140
Thank you.

881
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,140
So it's Windurst.

882
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:00,460
I don't know why they changed the names of all the characters.

883
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,520
I mean, just keep the races the same.

884
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,520
Why do you have to change the name?

885
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,940
Are they the Mikote is what the cat people are?

886
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,940
Yeah.

887
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:11,260
Seriously, Taratar or Lala, whatever the hell is.

888
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:14,860
The first time I saw Lala fell, I misspelled it as falafel.

889
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:23,380
So now I call them the falafel people, but I know I can't really give my opinion of it,

890
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:32,940
but it's, I'd say graphically on par with modern.

891
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:33,940
Which is good.

892
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:34,940
Definitely.

893
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,100
It's going to be a PlayStation 3 game.

894
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:40,180
I would say in a term of graphical sense, just in processing, in the processing power

895
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:42,900
required, it's definitely a big step over a while.

896
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,620
That I'm sure I can say.

897
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:50,460
So anyway, so I've been playing that, no more until June, I started playing Phantasy Star

898
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:56,140
Online 2, thanks to one of our lovely listeners, Prince Brightstar.

899
00:38:56,140 --> 00:39:00,520
And I actually, there was a patch that happened after I started playing.

900
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:08,480
So I basically got through the whole tutorial level and I've made my little red head Newman

901
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,060
person chick.

902
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:14,060
And I want an Oppa Oppa mag.

903
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,060
I don't care.

904
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:19,800
I worked my ass off to have an Oppa Oppa in the first Phantasy Star Online and god damn

905
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:25,000
it, I'm going to have another Oppa Oppa and I'm going to have a Master System because

906
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Sega nerd.

907
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,120
Even though I did have a Super Nintendo as a kid, technically it was my brothers, but

908
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:35,640
I did convince my mother to buy it so I could take it over.

909
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:39,600
And we had Rock Band at my birthday party, which I talked about.

910
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:43,440
We left Rock Band out, so I did some, I tried singing alone.

911
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:48,800
I played Minecraft last night trying to get this, someone made the Ocarina of Time map

912
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,160
in Minecraft, so I was trying to get it to load and I still can't figure out how to get

913
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:57,240
it to load as its own world, so whatever.

914
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:04,440
And so instead I just went around in my house digging more gopher holes in my house.

915
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:09,400
And god what else did I play, I played something else, oh Drunken Robot Pornography.

916
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:13,160
Which is super awesome, it's like jumping flash on crack, I've been telling everyone

917
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,320
about it.

918
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:19,480
And I got the indie pack last night.

919
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:24,720
I've only installed, well it's not really an indie pack because it does have Back to

920
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:31,880
the Future, all five parts of the Back to the Future series from Telltale, and right

921
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:37,680
now the minimum pay on it is like five bucks, but if you pay eight, then when the extra

922
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,400
content comes out then you get all that, and you get like, there's another one that's like

923
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:45,800
cargo something, it looked interesting, it was a neat game.

924
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:52,160
So I've downloaded a few games, there's that Dungeon Quest or something, it's like a puzzle

925
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,160
game.

926
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,160
But it's sort of a side scrolling combat puzzle game.

927
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,160
Oh the Dungeon Hearts.

928
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,160
Yeah Dungeon Hearts, that's it.

929
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,840
Shane just did a review of that, it just went up on VoG today.

930
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:03,960
Yeah it was part of the deal, so I mean I spent like eight bucks and got some good games

931
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:08,760
and got a really neat chiptune soundtrack that came with it.

932
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:14,720
And I didn't play any of them yet, I just installed a few of them because I have been

933
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,160
working on projects.

934
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,920
And that's my gaming week.

935
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,920
Before we go to Loki.

936
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,040
One last thing, Dan's been playing Grid 2.

937
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,040
The racing game?

938
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,720
Yes, with his three monitor setup.

939
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,760
He's such a man.

940
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,760
So manly dudely.

941
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:36,600
I put 15 seconds of him playing it on my tumblr, just to show off what his setup looks like,

942
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,280
so that's it.

943
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,440
Awesome.

944
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,560
Going to the results of our live poll before I go to Loki.

945
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:49,720
The results of the live poll, which is better, the winner with 54.17% of the vote, Mario

946
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,720
3.

947
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,920
Hells yeah.

948
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,920
Captain Spike, sorry about it.

949
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,440
I'm going home.

950
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,480
You taking your ball and going home?

951
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,920
Alright so Mario 3 is the winner there.

952
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,400
But there was a couple votes for neither one, jeez.

953
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:12,960
But at least it didn't win like the Nintendo question we asked last week.

954
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,440
Alright Loki, how was your gaming week?

955
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,920
I bought stuff too, I bought the Grand Theft Auto collection.

956
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:25,280
Okay so, what the hell, seriously Rockstar Games, during the weekend it's supposed to

957
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,160
be the Steam sale, okay, it's on sale during the weekend.

958
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:32,080
And then today they're like, guess what, we're pulling fucking double sale, we're marking

959
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,080
down again.

960
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,520
I'm like, fuck you, I just bought that shit yesterday for twice the price.

961
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:40,680
I mean it was 25 bucks for all the Grand Theft Auto games, but now it's 12 bucks for all

962
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:41,680
the Grand Theft Auto games.

963
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,560
So you should seriously buy that if you haven't bought it yet.

964
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:49,240
So I picked that up, and then also the indie bundle as well, haven't really installed anything

965
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:53,400
other than Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

966
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,240
Still haven't played that though.

967
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:59,240
Been playing Saints Row the Third on PC, just trying to 100% everything.

968
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:03,080
Technically according to the game I am 100% right now, because I have all the unlockables

969
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,080
and stuff.

970
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:10,360
But I need to do all the Saints book stuff, which is really boring from what I remember

971
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,360
the last time.

972
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:15,120
It took me off so much that I lost my save on my 360 because I had all that pretty much

973
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:19,200
done except for one carjacking, or one car theft mission.

974
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:23,800
So I have to do it all over again.

975
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:27,120
I played a little bit of Surgeon Simulator 2013.

976
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:30,800
Oh we were talking about that last week, that video was hilarious that you were showing

977
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,800
us.

978
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,800
That game is fucking hilarious.

979
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,800
It's just awesome.

980
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:34,800
DM got grossed out.

981
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,960
I just don't know, I still haven't figured out how to do the heart surgery, I had to

982
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,160
go watch it on YouTube or something.

983
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:44,200
I managed to, it was kind of gross but funny at the same time.

984
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,240
So I was like, okay, I'm going to take out all the ribs, because that's the only way

985
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,160
I can get to the heart and get these organs out of here.

986
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,400
So I took out all the ribs.

987
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,840
The lung was still stuck though, so I had to jiggle it back and forth, and it made a

988
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,880
squishy sound as you were doing it.

989
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:59,320
You know, trying to get the lungs out.

990
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:05,160
So then I got the lung out, and it kind of flung out, so it landed on the floor or something.

991
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:09,400
And then I got the other lung out, and I did the same thing with, I don't know, something

992
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,000
that was in the bottom, I think it was the liver or something, I can't really tell.

993
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,280
Organ three, I don't know.

994
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:20,360
Still can't figure out how to get the heart out though, because the stomach and the esophagus

995
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:26,640
are still in there, and I can't figure out how to cut it or rip it out.

996
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,600
So I don't know, I still can't pass that.

997
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:32,640
So I just threw the heart in there and the alarm clock, and I assumed that it was a no.

998
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,640
Try pickaxe.

999
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:34,640
Pickaxe?

1000
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:39,080
I tried the axe, I tried the saw, all I did was kill him.

1001
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,640
So I don't know.

1002
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:48,120
I saw someone trying to do that one, and there was a stint that you could insert in, but

1003
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,800
this is the one that Dan and I were watching, and we just got through the whole part where

1004
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,360
the guy's messing with his desk and trying to put the floppy.

1005
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,360
Oh, that was hard.

1006
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,880
Yeah, I finally got one of the floppies in there, and I'm like, oh, this is it?

1007
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,760
I was like, just swallow some pills, you've got diazepines, so swallow some pills and

1008
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:01,760
calm yourself.

1009
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,000
Okay, Dungeon Buster's talking about this game in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

1010
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,040
saying the kidney transplant video was hilarious.

1011
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,040
The guy tossed the patient's colon out of the back of the ambulance.

1012
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:13,920
What is wrong with this game?

1013
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,200
Best game ever, or best game ever.

1014
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,160
Don't make me go to a live poll.

1015
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,240
It's pretty awesome, I mean, it is pretty awesome.

1016
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:28,280
But so yeah, I played a bunch of that, and then actually something I'm gonna try to bring

1017
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:32,800
back that I tried this week, very short notice so no one joined, it's fine, because I still

1018
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,160
had fun playing it.

1019
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,480
I had a birthday dinner I had to go to.

1020
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:40,360
It's cool, no worries, seriously, it was very short notice, I decided, hey, let's bring

1021
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,800
back VoG game night.

1022
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:47,480
So that's what I'm gonna start doing, Thursdays, 8 to 10-ish, you know, pick a game.

1023
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,280
It doesn't matter, whatever, you can live stream something, I don't care.

1024
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,720
I already promised Mass Effect 3 playthroughs on Thursday.

1025
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:52,720
Well that's fine.

1026
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,880
Well why don't you play Mass Effect 3 with the VoG losers?

1027
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,160
Oh fuck no, I'm not playing Mass Effect 3.

1028
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:01,120
No, VoG game night will never be Mass Effect 3, I'm sorry, unless I'm out one night and

1029
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,120
then you can host it.

1030
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:06,440
At any game convention, there's multiple games to pick from, so I'm sure it'll be fine.

1031
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:11,520
So this coming week, I'm gonna do a repeat of Minecraft XBLA, which is fine, because

1032
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:16,360
I haven't actually played that in a while, so I played that for like two or three hours

1033
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,880
and it was fun.

1034
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:22,600
I miss that, because even with Minecraft, because we're playing creative right now on

1035
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:28,520
the server that we have up, the VoG server, but survival's kind of fun, I mean, for a

1036
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:33,760
while, and then you want to start getting creative with it and cheating and stuff, but

1037
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,400
for now, I mean, it was a lot of fun, so it was kind of fun to kind of play something

1038
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:41,360
different than just creative mode, and I forgot that you have to eat.

1039
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:48,040
I'm like, oh shit, that's right, you have to do that now, so it was kind of fun.

1040
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:52,000
So I played that, and god, what else?

1041
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,080
I know there's gotta be some other shit I played.

1042
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:57,840
Oh, you know, Call of Duty, actually I've been playing Call of Duty Marvel Warfare 3

1043
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:02,760
through the campaign, because I've been running out of people to play multiplayer with, we're

1044
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:08,000
trying to get more people in, so played a little bit of multiplayer, but played a lot

1045
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:14,760
of the campaign, and it's okay, it's kind of comparable, and then I think I played Defiance

1046
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,600
one of these nights, which is, it's still fun.

1047
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,600
Good.

1048
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:18,600
Did you watch the show?

1049
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,600
Are you watching the show too?

1050
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:22,880
No, I'm not watching the show, it's a sci-fi show, come on, I know where the bar is set

1051
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:23,880
on that, okay?

1052
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:24,880
How rude!

1053
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,440
Isn't he rude right now?

1054
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,440
Rude?

1055
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,000
I'm sorry, sci-fi, purveyors of such wonderful films as Sharktopus.

1056
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,560
Oh, oh, oh, you meant sci-fi the network.

1057
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:39,520
No, sci-fi the network, no, I'm not doggin' sci-fi, like, the genre, I'm saying sci-fi

1058
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,520
the TV network.

1059
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:43,400
Alright, well that's acceptable.

1060
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,400
That's fine.

1061
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,400
I mean, I just...

1062
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,400
Man-skeeto.

1063
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:55,440
I'm sorry, I'm sure it's good, but it's just, I'm not into the world, I mean, if it was

1064
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,120
like a Borderlands game, it'd be even better, but I just don't...

1065
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,120
You're not excited about Sharknado?

1066
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:03,680
That is, like, who's in Sharknado?

1067
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,520
It's like, legit a thing.

1068
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:07,520
It's a real thing, yeah.

1069
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,280
Megashark versus Giant Octopus, starring the wonderful Deborah Nielson.

1070
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:15,120
No, here's something that it's kind of, I am kind of interested in seeing, or at least

1071
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:21,600
seeing the riff tracks of, is they have a Birdemic sequel coming out, Birdemic 2.

1072
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,840
That warranted a sequel?

1073
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:27,600
Yeah, the guy thought it was good, and so he made another movie, like, he seriously

1074
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:28,600
thinks it's good.

1075
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:32,120
I think what he thinks is, hey, I make a really shitty movie and I make a ton of money

1076
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,120
from it.

1077
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,120
Done.

1078
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:37,600
I'm gonna spend another 10,000 in five days.

1079
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:38,600
Rob found it, Sharknado.

1080
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:44,640
Sharknado will have Ian Ziering from Beverly Hills 90210, and Tara Reid is the star of

1081
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,640
Sharknado.

1082
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:46,640
Is she gonna be the shark?

1083
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:47,640
I am here for that.

1084
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,800
Wait, when does this come on?

1085
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:54,080
I don't know, what day is, oh, um, I'm trying to look at IMDB'd if you go.

1086
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:58,280
So what exactly is a Sharknado, is that like a tornado with sharks in it, or?

1087
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:04,820
I, I, Tigerclaw, help me out, I need- Good idea, bad idea.

1088
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:10,560
By the way, Rob, we do have to bring back your post-Hoard House multiplayer stream.

1089
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:14,000
Oh yeah, I like, I like doing the live streaming for World War 1.

1090
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,720
Where I turn into a very potty mouthed person.

1091
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,520
What they need is just do land sharks.

1092
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:24,160
Land sharks, and have like, you know- But it has to have, knock on the door and

1093
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,160
go cannygram.

1094
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:29,360
Alright, in the interest of time, I gotta derail this and get us back on track.

1095
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,640
That's it, yeah, that was it.

1096
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,920
So yeah, this week, Minecraft again.

1097
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:34,920
So Minecraft XBLA.

1098
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:39,000
I'll put up, there's gonna be a thread on the forums, hopefully we can put up like a

1099
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,920
calendar or something like that so we can plan ahead with what's up, and also let me

1100
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,480
know what games you want to play.

1101
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,800
Not Mass Effect 3.

1102
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,960
I will try to make this quick.

1103
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:54,600
I had fun, we went to Golf Land, Spike, Tim and I yesterday, and, well not that there

1104
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:59,220
was that much to play there, but I did play some DDR and I about died after one set of

1105
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:04,680
songs because, you know, just being 34 now and trying to get up on the machine and just

1106
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:07,840
jumping into a set of songs.

1107
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:12,480
But come on, I don't have the stamina I had when I was 24 because I haven't been playing

1108
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,960
DDR every day like I used to then.

1109
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:19,200
So you know, and I don't work out or anything like that, so it's a little difficult to just

1110
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,440
get up there and do it.

1111
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,760
But it was fun.

1112
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:27,200
There's a lot about DDR I really miss, so I just wanted to kind of throw that out there

1113
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,280
for the long time Bimani fans.

1114
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:33,520
There's one thing I forgot to say by the way, because I was at the arcade at John's Incredibly

1115
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:36,240
Crappy Pizza, they had a doodle jump arcade game.

1116
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,800
Yeah, they had that at RVGL too, I was surprised.

1117
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:39,800
Yeah, so anyway.

1118
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,640
They also have one for Fruit Ninja, but I think we've talked about that before.

1119
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:43,640
As you were.

1120
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,640
Alright, yeah, yeah.

1121
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:49,960
Okay, so as far as console games go, we were playing a lot of fun stuff last night.

1122
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:53,440
We were trying to find four player games on Xbox Live, so I think we touched, what, Perfect

1123
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:58,560
Dark, Doom, Age of Swing, which somebody commented on Facebook, why are you playing

1124
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,560
that?

1125
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:00,560
I'm like, it's four players!

1126
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:01,560
Shut up.

1127
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:05,480
And You Don't Know Jack, which is probably the best out of the four player games.

1128
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:08,160
This random ass Tetris game I had that wasn't bad either.

1129
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,920
The THQ published one, yeah.

1130
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,200
Yeah, it wasn't bad.

1131
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,760
Tetris Evolution, it's years old, but not bad.

1132
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:19,920
Okay, but as far as new games go, there was one new game I played, and I wrote a review

1133
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:24,720
of this that you can read at vognetwork.com, and the game is Dead Island Riptide.

1134
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,880
And I gave it a D plus on the site.

1135
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:31,680
I didn't, there was a lot about it I didn't really care for, but I want to acknowledge

1136
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:36,840
that I realize there's a lot of people that already know, like, Dead Island Riptide, I

1137
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,200
am totally here for this.

1138
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:43,800
Like, I want to dismember zombies in many creative ways, I want to make these new weapons,

1139
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:48,400
I want the lols that come from, you know, the zombie murder fest, and, you know, kind

1140
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,880
of like a B movie game, like Sharknado the game, basically, right?

1141
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:56,120
So there's people that are totally going to be into that, and I can respect that.

1142
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:59,360
And you know, this game is really for that crowd.

1143
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:05,240
But for me, I found it to have a lot of technical challenges, like for instances, zombies that,

1144
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:08,660
you know, I would be facing one direction, and I'd suddenly turn, and suddenly when the

1145
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:12,220
zombies in my field of vision, it just, it was starting to get up, and it would just

1146
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:16,500
fall down, and then get back up again, like, just this weird stuff that would happen.

1147
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:17,500
Well, just kidding.

1148
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:24,740
And then these shadow effects that were kind of not good, and some other, it's all environmental

1149
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:25,740
too, Tim.

1150
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:29,900
Yeah, I mean, the five minutes I saw of it, I wasn't, you know, super impressed.

1151
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:33,860
So yeah, from a technical standpoint, I wasn't that satisfied.

1152
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:40,300
I found it to be a bit repetitive, but you know, if you like the first game, this is

1153
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:45,260
more of the same, which for fans of the first game, I'm sure is not going to be a bad thing.

1154
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:48,380
So I kind of think you already know where you stand on Dead Island Riptide.

1155
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:50,340
I'm not going to tell you.

1156
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:53,380
Go check it out if you're on the bubble.

1157
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:55,500
No.

1158
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:56,660
Get a rental, maybe.

1159
00:52:56,660 --> 00:53:00,700
A rental with friends on a night you're all going to drink.

1160
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:04,820
Great idea for Dead Island Riptide.

1161
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:05,820
I guess that's it.

1162
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:06,820
That's really all I want to say about games.

1163
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:09,120
I want to hear about Spike and Tim and their gaming week.

1164
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:12,760
So Captain Spike, what's a gaming week look like for you?

1165
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,800
Mostly just Monster Hunter Ultimate.

1166
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:18,200
I couldn't stand the demo of that game.

1167
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,200
What's up?

1168
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,200
The demo is awful.

1169
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:25,480
Okay, so what am I missing by not, well, for one, I hate it when companies put out horrible

1170
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,640
demos and it's been a trend recently.

1171
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:32,040
Ni No Kuni, terrible demo, great game.

1172
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,040
What else?

1173
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,040
There was another one not that long ago.

1174
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:35,040
It was really bad too.

1175
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:40,880
It was Monster Hunter that I didn't know anything about Monster Hunter and I played this demo

1176
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:46,040
and I'm like, nope, delete, but you are really into this.

1177
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,040
What am I missing?

1178
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:50,200
Well, you know, it's largely a skill-based game.

1179
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:55,480
There is some advancement through gearing and what have you, but largely the whole point

1180
00:53:55,480 --> 00:54:01,040
of the game is sort of learning the mechanics, learning how the enemy behaviors interact

1181
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,600
with their timing windows for when they're vulnerable to attack.

1182
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:05,640
I really like it.

1183
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:10,360
I think it's a very cerebral take on the action game, but the demo is awful.

1184
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,400
It doesn't communicate what's expected of you at all.

1185
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:16,640
It just gives you some big weapons, some toned down monsters and just says, oh, hack them

1186
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:23,120
until they're dead, which, you know, cool, but I'm not really here for that.

1187
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:25,280
But for the full game, I actually find it very compelling.

1188
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:28,520
I've put in something like 120 hours already.

1189
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:29,520
Wow.

1190
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,520
That's commitment.

1191
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,520
Yeah.

1192
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,520
I'm the kind of guy I usually pick up games.

1193
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:37,560
I'll buy a $50 game, play a couple of hours and never touch it again, which is an awful

1194
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:38,560
thing.

1195
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,560
I don't think that's cool.

1196
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:40,560
You and me both, buddy.

1197
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:43,280
That's why I felt comfortable saying that to you.

1198
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,400
It's called Gamer ADD.

1199
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,880
You know, oh, I'm going to check out some Dead Island Riptide.

1200
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:48,880
Oh, shiny.

1201
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:49,880
Yep.

1202
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:50,880
Yep.

1203
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:51,880
Oh, shit.

1204
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:52,880
Steam's Tale.

1205
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:53,880
Download, download, download.

1206
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:54,880
Yeah.

1207
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:55,880
Yeah.

1208
00:54:55,880 --> 00:55:00,720
But that and, you know, all of the gaming that you just mentioned that we did last night,

1209
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:07,360
and I've been playing Super Mario World on Wii U and Mega Man 4 on my 3DS.

1210
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:09,560
Good times.

1211
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,440
You're a big fan of the Mega Man series, right?

1212
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,440
Huge fan.

1213
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:13,440
Yeah?

1214
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:14,440
Yeah.

1215
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,440
Okay.

1216
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:18,440
So which one's your favorite out of all the games?

1217
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,800
I'm giving you an expected look.

1218
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:21,800
The number series.

1219
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:23,360
I'm actually, I'm going to go with three.

1220
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:24,360
Okay.

1221
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,360
That's one of the two correct answers.

1222
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:26,360
I can forgive you.

1223
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,480
I do love two.

1224
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:33,080
The problem is I've played it so many times that it's less of, oh, I'm enjoying doing

1225
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:36,440
this, and more of like, oh, hey, watch me get through this stage without using Flash

1226
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:37,440
Man's ability.

1227
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,440
Yeah.

1228
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:41,360
So you're talking about a Quick Man's level then?

1229
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:42,360
Exactly.

1230
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:43,360
Okay.

1231
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:44,600
What's your favorite of the X?

1232
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:45,600
The first one.

1233
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,200
I don't even have to think about that.

1234
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,400
I replay it every year.

1235
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:51,480
I gave that to Rob recently.

1236
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:56,440
Ross Seal UT in chat is also a fan of Monster Hunter 3 saying, excuse me, Monster Hunter

1237
00:55:56,440 --> 00:56:00,760
3 Ultimate, saying I'm over 70 hours into MH3U so far.

1238
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:01,760
It's a fine game.

1239
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,480
You just have to look at the manual and the home menu.

1240
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,120
That is something that needs to be pointed out.

1241
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:11,040
All the Wii U games I've gotten so far have manuals in the home menu, not a physical manual.

1242
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,840
So read that manual.

1243
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:13,840
Yeah.

1244
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:14,840
That's definitely a good idea.

1245
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:19,380
For some reason, for 3 Ultimate, they removed like the tutorials that used to be in-game

1246
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:21,660
in the other iterations of Monster Hunter.

1247
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:25,340
I don't really know why they did that, but it makes the manual even more important.

1248
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:26,340
Interesting.

1249
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:28,100
Yeah, it was funny.

1250
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:31,380
Last night we were playing Tetris and I couldn't figure out like why our multiplayer mode was

1251
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:34,380
not doing the line increase thing that you expect to see.

1252
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:36,380
I was like, wait a minute, this game's from 2006.

1253
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:37,380
It still has a manual.

1254
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:39,380
Let me go find it.

1255
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:43,340
Not, oh, let me get out my iPad and log on.

1256
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:45,380
So Tim, what's a week in gaming look like for you?

1257
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:46,380
How was your gaming week?

1258
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:47,380
Hmm.

1259
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:50,660
Well, I've been playing a lot of Picross 3D on my DS.

1260
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:52,660
It's all casual.

1261
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:53,660
I love it.

1262
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:57,500
It's just a fun thing to do if I have five or ten minutes to, you know, right before

1263
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:02,340
bed or I was playing it on the couch before the show started.

1264
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:07,100
I played a little bit of Mass Effect 3 on Insanity because everything else is boring

1265
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:10,220
and slow now compared to that.

1266
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:16,380
And as Spike mentioned earlier, I played some Super Mario World, the inferior game to Super

1267
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:19,220
Mario Brothers 3 judging you.

1268
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:27,020
We played until I died about 15 times in a row to Matcha Koopa and quit in a fit of rage.

1269
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:30,900
So yeah, I do that if I get too frustrated with something.

1270
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:31,900
So does Rob.

1271
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:33,180
I've done this.

1272
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:34,240
This legitimately happened.

1273
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:39,460
We were playing Ice Climber, but the part he leaves out is that he lost all his lives.

1274
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:43,780
So I was just playing by myself and then I got frustrated and I said, you know what,

1275
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:44,780
I'm done.

1276
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:45,780
I got ten minutes.

1277
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:46,780
They'll show.

1278
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:47,780
Out.

1279
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:51,420
And I haven't put as many hours into it as Spike has, but I've been playing Monster Hunter

1280
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:52,420
as well.

1281
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:57,940
I am new to the Monster Hunter series, so I came at it from a brand new perspective.

1282
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:03,340
It's pretty daunting to just sort of plop you in the game.

1283
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:08,540
And there's a lot about the game that I find really, really annoying in terms of the interface,

1284
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:14,980
the tiny text, just the really clunky nature of getting quests and it all feels really

1285
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:16,220
artificial.

1286
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:21,780
But that all being said, I totally understand why the game works for people.

1287
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:25,860
Like it really did in some way sink its teeth into me and I wanted to get that next set

1288
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:26,860
of armor.

1289
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:28,600
I wanted to kill that next monster.

1290
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:32,620
So I did have a lot of fun with it, despite the frustrations.

1291
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:38,100
I feel like I'm missing out on this game that everybody's into and I just couldn't get into

1292
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:39,100
it.

1293
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:41,380
I had a friend in Japan be one of the campers.

1294
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:42,380
Oh, really?

1295
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:43,380
Yeah.

1296
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:44,380
Oh, wow.

1297
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:46,540
Camped out for, I think, three different Monster Hunter games.

1298
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:47,580
Oh my gosh.

1299
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:48,700
Having a manual probably helped.

1300
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:50,820
I didn't look at the manual.

1301
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:52,820
Spike was my manual.

1302
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:56,460
And even then with somebody who knows what they're talking about, it's still hard.

1303
00:58:56,460 --> 00:59:00,060
That's a really steep learning curve to just jump into it.

1304
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:03,780
ActDeft in our chat room asking, Captain Spike, you a King of Fighters fan?

1305
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:07,540
I'm not sure if that came from an earlier conversation or what, but are you a King of

1306
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:08,540
Fighters fan?

1307
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:09,780
I am.

1308
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,900
Someone had mentioned KOF in the chat.

1309
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:13,900
Oh, that's where that came from.

1310
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:14,900
Yeah.

1311
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:15,900
Got it.

1312
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:18,580
Is there a particular one in the series that you prefer or...

1313
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:23,060
Well, I've been collecting the cartridges for my Neo Geo, so basically all the ones

1314
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,060
I have already.

1315
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,060
Okay.

1316
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:26,900
Next time you come in town, bring them.

1317
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:28,900
I have a Neo Geo.

1318
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:29,900
Okay.

1319
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,300
Actually, the last game I bought was KOF 2000.

1320
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:33,300
Excellent.

1321
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:34,300
Yeah.

1322
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:37,420
I loved that Neo Geo back for you from Tokyo.

1323
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:39,300
That was awful.

1324
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:40,300
Thank you, though.

1325
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:41,820
There was one that came out that was awful, though.

1326
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:42,820
What was that KOF...

1327
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:43,820
Was it 12?

1328
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:44,820
It wasn't...

1329
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:45,820
I mean, yeah.

1330
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:46,820
It was basically unfinished.

1331
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:47,820
Yeah.

1332
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:48,820
My Shiranui wasn't even in it.

1333
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:50,060
How do you do that?

1334
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:51,060
It was awful.

1335
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:59,340
And it was the one where both Kyo and Iori were powered down.

1336
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:00,340
It was not a good one.

1337
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:01,340
All right.

1338
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:06,180
Well, if that's gonna do it for our gaming weeks, then let's get into some actual gaming

1339
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:07,180
news.

1340
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:08,220
Let's get into the show.

1341
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:09,220
That's all right.

1342
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:10,220
We've had some good chat so far.

1343
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:11,220
I'm just gonna quickly say housekeeping.

1344
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:14,260
Don't forget to follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R.

1345
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:18,380
We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

1346
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:20,780
We talked about the GamerX panel.

1347
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:21,900
Did we get the link in our chat room?

1348
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:22,900
I don't think we did yet.

1349
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:23,900
Slidekick did for us, though.

1350
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:24,900
Slidekick did.

1351
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:25,900
Thank you very much.

1352
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:29,980
Because all your upvotes, we need them to make that panel happen.

1353
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:31,780
So please check that out.

1354
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:33,580
And plan on coming out and saying hi.

1355
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:34,580
All right.

1356
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:36,900
Let's get into some gaming news for the week.

1357
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:39,980
And I think Loki's gonna start us off tonight.

1358
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:41,340
What's going on in the gaming world?

1359
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:47,500
So Microsoft's gonna finally say something about the next Xbox system on May 21st.

1360
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:51,620
Was really supposed to happen, I guess, this month, and now it's May.

1361
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:57,820
So May 21st, 1 p.m. Eastern, 10 a.m. Pacific, or 6 p.m. UK.

1362
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:00,700
And that's all we know.

1363
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:04,260
Except there's rumors.

1364
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:07,740
A source.

1365
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:10,140
Told Polygon some few things.

1366
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:11,140
I love sources.

1367
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:12,140
It's always a source.

1368
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:13,140
Always a source.

1369
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:14,140
Yeah, right.

1370
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:15,140
All right.

1371
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:16,140
Why not?

1372
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:20,620
For shits and giggles, let's dissect this shit, too.

1373
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:21,620
Come on.

1374
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:22,620
Let's do it.

1375
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:26,540
So there's some details that they're apparently talking about.

1376
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:31,860
First off, you know, saying that yes, system will be always online.

1377
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:35,820
However, it's not as bad as it sounds.

1378
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:40,940
And you know, basically saying that also the system will be able to capture video and will

1379
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:45,260
do so similar to a DVR and you'll be able to pick highlights and stuff that sounds very

1380
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:50,300
similar to the PlayStation 4 and what they were talking about there.

1381
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:53,740
And you'll be able to share those on the web.

1382
01:01:53,740 --> 01:02:00,940
And then also that it's gonna, the online only part of it, it is gonna have basically

1383
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:07,900
kind of a check for your games, but they're gonna leave it up to the publishers to decide

1384
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:12,700
whether the games are gonna be requiring a constant internet connection or not.

1385
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:13,700
Oh, gee.

1386
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:19,700
Yes, leave it in the hands of them.

1387
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:24,840
That to me sounds like that the publishers will be handling servers and stuff.

1388
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:30,220
So if live goes down, you can't play that game.

1389
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:34,180
If their server goes down, you can't play that game.

1390
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:35,180
Your internet goes down.

1391
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:36,180
You can't play that game.

1392
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:37,180
I don't know.

1393
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:38,180
It sounds lame.

1394
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:39,180
Yeah.

1395
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:41,660
I mean, again, this is the same rumor that's been going.

1396
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:45,520
Now it's just, it's a new spin on the same rumor and it's kind of like, I'm kind of sick

1397
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:52,940
about theorizing on this one because I think also with so much fallout from that guy on

1398
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:56,620
Twitter and the fact that, you know, we thought we were going to hear about this in April

1399
01:02:56,620 --> 01:03:01,460
and now it's May, it kind of makes me think a lot of this shit's still up in the air.

1400
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:06,620
So I'm not sure we can really thumb down any of this online stuff yet.

1401
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:07,620
Exactly.

1402
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:11,020
And they say one of the other things that's gonna change is the way achievements are working.

1403
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:16,380
They're saying they're gonna basically kind of remove the cap, I guess, for achievements

1404
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:17,380
or anything.

1405
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:21,460
It'd make it even easier for publishers and developers to add achievements later on.

1406
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:25,740
Like say they want you to notice a certain thing or focus on a certain part of a level

1407
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:26,740
or something they can.

1408
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:28,900
Or download the DLC and make it the more achievements.

1409
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:31,900
Well, they do that anyways, but yeah.

1410
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:38,100
And then also they're saying that the friends list size is gonna increase.

1411
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:39,100
Oh, finally.

1412
01:03:39,100 --> 01:03:41,340
The cap is going to be removed.

1413
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:42,340
Finally.

1414
01:03:42,340 --> 01:03:43,340
It's about time.

1415
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:47,540
That was supposed to happen several years ago when they shut off Halo 2, yes, I remember

1416
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:48,540
that.

1417
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:49,540
Yeah.

1418
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:54,420
So apparently that's now going to happen somehow.

1419
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:59,900
That one I believe, for what it's worth, I believe that one.

1420
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:06,180
That seems legit, yes.

1421
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:11,940
So yeah, I mean, I'm not even gonna bother debating this stuff to death because we've

1422
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:12,940
done it already.

1423
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:19,020
And I guarantee you with it, what, four weeks away, five weeks away from this reveal, we're

1424
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:23,420
probably gonna have another fucking rumor article every goddamn week leading up to it.

1425
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:24,420
Of course.

1426
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:28,580
Because everybody wants to get those rumors out there because, God forbid, when actually

1427
01:04:28,580 --> 01:04:33,140
the information comes out and they're wrong, they'll say, well, the details changed.

1428
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:34,140
We got shit.

1429
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:35,140
We got you that news.

1430
01:04:35,140 --> 01:04:36,180
No shit, they changed.

1431
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:37,180
They always do.

1432
01:04:37,180 --> 01:04:41,980
I was having a friendly debate on Twitter earlier this week with another podcaster.

1433
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:43,820
Do you think they know the name?

1434
01:04:43,820 --> 01:04:47,420
I still don't think they know the name.

1435
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:48,420
Xbox something.

1436
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:49,420
Yeah.

1437
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:53,380
I think it's gonna be an Xbox something.

1438
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:57,420
My reasoning for that is that a lot of times they go back, I think with PlayStation, that's

1439
01:04:57,420 --> 01:04:58,420
another thing.

1440
01:04:58,420 --> 01:05:02,660
I mean, that's kind of, yeah, I think they're gonna call it PlayStation 4, it's a safe bet.

1441
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:07,980
But in the case of Nintendo, they didn't pick Wii U until really close to that press conference.

1442
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:12,340
And you might remember at E3, that signage, none of the signage said Wii U. Besides that

1443
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:15,700
logo at their press conference, it all was new Nintendo console, da da da.

1444
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:20,020
So this Xbox, they may still be, I mean, Hey, you gotta have a new name for this console.

1445
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:21,860
You gotta go out in like two seconds here.

1446
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:22,860
I don't know.

1447
01:05:22,860 --> 01:05:23,860
How about Chuck?

1448
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:24,860
Is that what you're gonna do with it?

1449
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:25,860
Wii U.

1450
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:27,860
I'm just chucking in the trash.

1451
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:28,860
Stop.

1452
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:36,300
Have you already, you've made up your mind on the next Xbox without having seen the official

1453
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:37,300
word?

1454
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:38,300
No, I was just being a smart ass.

1455
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:39,300
Oh, okay.

1456
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:40,300
That's fair enough.

1457
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:46,660
Um, I knew if I put this out there already before, if it's, if it's got a sort of like

1458
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:50,980
online only, even if it's for DRM, which I don't like the idea of that.

1459
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:55,140
You know, if it's going to prevent me from playing any of my games at all, if I'm not

1460
01:05:55,140 --> 01:05:59,180
connected to the internet, I'm not buying the console because I'm not connected to the

1461
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:03,940
internet all the time at work where I play a lot of my games.

1462
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:05,440
So it doesn't benefit me.

1463
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:10,160
I don't have no, I don't have a need to do that when I can pick up another console or

1464
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:11,940
keep the console I have and have no problems with it.

1465
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:12,940
I just thought of a good name.

1466
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:13,940
Hmm.

1467
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:14,940
The ex tesseract.

1468
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:20,680
Um, I, and I'm going to say what I said before on this whole thing too, is that, you know,

1469
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:24,940
what's the trade off because we know what PlayStation four is bringing to the table.

1470
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:26,300
We know it will play use games.

1471
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:28,800
We know it doesn't require that ping and all this stuff.

1472
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:32,200
And you know, the stuff they were showing in the press conference, why am I going to

1473
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:36,540
opt for X box, whatever's more strict system?

1474
01:06:36,540 --> 01:06:39,620
What's the benefit, what's going to be the trade off.

1475
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:43,480
And the other thing too, is if these are the only way they could get away with something

1476
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:47,420
like that is if both them and PlayStation were doing it.

1477
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:51,240
And then, then, you know, theoretically, if you're going to say, Oh, I have to buy, I

1478
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:56,320
have to, I'm being held at gunpoint to buy a new system, you know, then I guess I'll

1479
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:57,960
buy a Wii U or something.

1480
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:00,280
And until it's like, ah, yay.

1481
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:04,540
But no, I mean, seriously, I don't know.

1482
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:05,540
I don't know.

1483
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:10,520
They have this, honestly, I don't think we'll hear anything about whether it's online only

1484
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:11,520
or whatever.

1485
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:12,520
Cause they just won't talk about it.

1486
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:13,520
Of course.

1487
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:14,520
Yeah.

1488
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:15,520
I mean, they're not going to say, Hey, there's DRM on this.

1489
01:07:15,620 --> 01:07:17,500
We're going to have to read between the lines on that.

1490
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:22,540
It depends if they take questions from the press or not, which I kind of think the executives

1491
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:26,220
will have to, they'll have to address it, but I think they'll, they'll have to talk

1492
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:27,220
to investors.

1493
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:30,020
I think there's going to be investors that want to know based on everything that happened

1494
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:31,580
on Twitter.

1495
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:36,100
So anyhow, uh, let's talk about things that you really can do on Xbox right now.

1496
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:37,640
This is a reality right now.

1497
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:42,620
It's the new pizza hut app available on the Xbox three 60.

1498
01:07:42,620 --> 01:07:44,620
Captain Spike, did you just perk up over there?

1499
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:45,720
Yeah.

1500
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:50,720
Well you just gave me a reason to turn on my Xbox for the first time in like a month.

1501
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:54,520
Uh, well you can actually order pizza online from your three 60.

1502
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:58,880
I haven't done this yet, but uh, what I love about it is that it's got that same cross

1503
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:04,960
bar aesthetic that everything else on Xbox has, you know what I mean?

1504
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:08,680
Like even if they have connect functionality, I bet it does.

1505
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:14,200
Like I just, let me, let me just use my hand to wave over to the extra bacon toppings.

1506
01:08:14,780 --> 01:08:16,980
I wish it had like the stuff that Japanese pizzas do.

1507
01:08:16,980 --> 01:08:18,660
Like I want mayonnaise on my pizza.

1508
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:19,660
You never know.

1509
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:20,660
You never know.

1510
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:21,660
Same one.

1511
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:25,380
Remember the, uh, the old anti piracy ads from like five or 10 years ago, you wouldn't

1512
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:31,560
down, you wouldn't download a pizza slash pizza.

1513
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:32,560
Now you can.

1514
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:33,560
Exactly.

1515
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:35,560
It's a reality.

1516
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:36,560
Awesome.

1517
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:43,020
Uh, so yeah, you can order online, uh, through the app and I guess, I guess you, I haven't

1518
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:46,240
done this yet, but I'm assuming it's probably not much different than ordering online.

1519
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:48,200
I have ordered a pizza online.

1520
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:49,520
You know, I think a lot of us have done that.

1521
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,960
I imagine it's really not that much different than that.

1522
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:54,040
Um, so why not?

1523
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:58,640
And I like this quote from Larry Erb, uh, in an interview with Polygon.

1524
01:08:58,640 --> 01:08:59,880
He's major Nelson, of course.

1525
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:03,440
Uh, we're always looking at ways to give our audience more of what they're interested in.

1526
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:05,800
If you look at our audience, they love pizza.

1527
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:08,260
I mean, who doesn't?

1528
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:12,400
It has international appeal and Pizza Hut is a recognized brand that matches up well

1529
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:17,300
with the Xbox brand, you know, right back there with the Mountain Dew and the Doritos

1530
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:18,300
all sitting on the table.

1531
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:20,460
I feel like that's a backhanded compliment.

1532
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:22,660
I really want a Cheetos app now.

1533
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:25,580
Hey, you got two Cheetos games.

1534
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:26,580
Okay.

1535
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:27,580
That's enough.

1536
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:28,580
Or Doritos.

1537
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:29,900
Dash of Destruction.

1538
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:30,900
Come on.

1539
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:31,900
Where were you?

1540
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:32,900
All right.

1541
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:36,660
So yeah, uh, you can order a pizza through your Xbox now, but honestly I like, I know

1542
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:41,660
a lot of people are giggling, cackling, but technically, couldn't you fire up Internet

1543
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:43,240
Explorer on your Xbox?

1544
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:46,280
Go to pizza.com and you could have already done this.

1545
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:47,280
It's just funny.

1546
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:48,280
They made an actual app for it.

1547
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:53,440
Does Pizza Hut.com have any sort of flash or HTML5 because it won't fucking work on

1548
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:54,440
Internet Explorer.

1549
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:55,440
Perhaps.

1550
01:09:55,440 --> 01:10:01,200
For the record, as we've been talking about in chat, there will be ways to download your

1551
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:04,320
food because they've already got biological printers.

1552
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:06,480
What's to say they're not going to have food printers at week?

1553
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:09,280
It's it's the, um, the, what is it from Star Trek?

1554
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:10,280
Replicators.

1555
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:11,280
The replicator.

1556
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:13,020
Stop the whirl over to get off.

1557
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:14,020
And you can.

1558
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:15,020
This is amazing.

1559
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:16,020
You like food.

1560
01:10:16,020 --> 01:10:18,580
What is that supposed to mean?

1561
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:21,260
I'm about to read my story and then go get more pizza.

1562
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:24,620
Hey, I can print delicious non-down loaded pizza.

1563
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:29,020
Hey, I can print stuff on paper with biological stuff right now.

1564
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:30,020
I only print one color.

1565
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:32,540
You don't need to know what you do at home.

1566
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:39,220
I thought the FBI went after people that tried to do this biological stuff.

1567
01:10:39,220 --> 01:10:40,380
Anyhow.

1568
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:44,000
I want a replicator so I can go T L gray hot.

1569
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,800
Even though I really hate Earl gray tea.

1570
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,960
I would like to tell you dungeon buster that Ron, the Romulan ale that you used to buy

1571
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:53,960
at the Star Trek experience was lame.

1572
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:54,960
Just get a warp core breach.

1573
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,480
You won't feel your feet.

1574
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:58,080
Okay.

1575
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,080
More news.

1576
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,080
Dark Sire.

1577
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:01,080
Yeah.

1578
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:02,080
Yeah.

1579
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:03,080
So Nintendo, while you read this, I'm going to go get tea.

1580
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:05,080
Hey Rob, get me some pizza too, please.

1581
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:06,080
Thank you.

1582
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,080
Hearts.

1583
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:09,520
Do I look like your bitch?

1584
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:11,540
I just want to get served.

1585
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:13,540
Oh, you're about to get served.

1586
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:15,540
You're about to get served.

1587
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:16,540
Hearts.

1588
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:17,540
Love you.

1589
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:18,540
Mean it.

1590
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:19,540
Okay.

1591
01:11:19,540 --> 01:11:24,420
Anyway, so, um, Nintendo is skipping E3 press conference.

1592
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:28,820
They're going to be doing small conferences with direct material and they're trying a

1593
01:11:28,820 --> 01:11:33,940
new presentation style who they're, uh, so that they're focusing on the software lineup

1594
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:39,720
for the US market and going to be doing closed events for American distributors and, uh,

1595
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:43,420
another closed hands on event for the gaming media.

1596
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:52,440
So yeah, they're like, E3, no, also, um, from the last Nintendo direct, they were, uh, putting

1597
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:58,120
out release dates for a Wii U and a Nintendo 3DS games with the Yoshi Island and the Mario

1598
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:02,820
Party and the Legend of Zelda linked to the past sequel, which I totally want.

1599
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:08,840
Uh, but they're, uh, just trying to do it in smaller groups, let it out so that everybody

1600
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:11,780
can be disappointed in increments.

1601
01:12:11,780 --> 01:12:15,740
I just, they did this last year with their, they had the press conference and then they

1602
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:21,780
have three Nintendo directs and it just such a waste of time.

1603
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:24,460
It was just so, it wasn't like there's a ton of information.

1604
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:29,000
It's just they drug it on for so long.

1605
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
It's like, okay, here, we're going to talk about 3DS.

1606
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:35,440
Oh, and this one's about the Wii U, oh, and this one's about the 3DS games that are for

1607
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:36,440
older kids.

1608
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:39,080
And this one's about our press conference.

1609
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:46,220
It's like, uh, yeah, well, it says that they're actually trying to be, um, I guess a little

1610
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:51,760
more direct with how they're giving the information, but, uh, I don't know.

1611
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:54,040
It just sort of does seem like kind of a snub at the whole E3.

1612
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:59,580
And especially since Rob said earlier, the, the feel of E3 has changed.

1613
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:05,460
It doesn't seem quite like the big information source that it used to be is turned into a,

1614
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:06,460
look at our ads.

1615
01:13:06,460 --> 01:13:10,380
Look at the big circle thing that EA has in their booth every year.

1616
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:14,440
You know, it's more about the flash and less about the information.

1617
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:16,900
I think they just don't have anything new to show.

1618
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:20,940
Um, I mean, it's not, you don't think Nintendo has anything new to show?

1619
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:21,940
Yes, I do.

1620
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:24,280
This is a make or break year for Nintendo.

1621
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:25,280
Yeah.

1622
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:26,280
For as far as that we use.

1623
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:29,720
And how well have they done so far in the first third of the year?

1624
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:31,320
Oh, fantastic.

1625
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:35,040
I think they're really edging on the break side of Nintendo.

1626
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:40,120
We could go three years ago on this very show and replace the word Wii U with 3DS and it

1627
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:41,360
would be the same conversation.

1628
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:42,360
Yeah.

1629
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:48,540
And it took them a year to, to pull it around and a price drop almost immediately.

1630
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:51,080
And who's to say that's not going to happen again?

1631
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:53,740
I don't think it's going to happen again.

1632
01:13:53,740 --> 01:13:55,180
Here's why I don't think it's going to happen again.

1633
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:59,400
It's because their 3DS is doing well and they're making plenty of profit from that.

1634
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:02,780
So they don't really give a shit right now that the Wii U is not doing well.

1635
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:07,580
I kind of get like, this was one of those articles, I read it, it was all over Twitter

1636
01:14:07,580 --> 01:14:09,260
and I was like, wow, that's really weird.

1637
01:14:09,260 --> 01:14:11,260
And then I go, well, you know, that makes a lot of sense.

1638
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:15,300
Like people really just, you know, they've dumped on those Nintendo press conferences.

1639
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:20,100
And I think that the element of the game of press conferences and so forth has changed.

1640
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:22,240
They don't have a new console to show.

1641
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:23,960
They only want to show games.

1642
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:27,840
And you, you said it yourself a minute ago, people don't want to sit through all this

1643
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:29,820
other crap that they don't care about.

1644
01:14:29,820 --> 01:14:32,480
Give me the information targeted at me.

1645
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:33,480
Thank you very much.

1646
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:34,480
Good night.

1647
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:35,480
But they don't do that with the Nintendo Directs.

1648
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:38,960
They, I think they drag on, I don't know, whatever.

1649
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:43,080
I would rather just see press release links to trailers done.

1650
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:47,400
I don't need to hear you about your fucking crap about, you know, the 25 year anniversary

1651
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:48,400
of Luigi.

1652
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:52,660
Especially when you go on about it long, long, long time and you're like, oh, by the way,

1653
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:57,140
we won't actually have any really new games for Luigi other than the already announced,

1654
01:14:57,140 --> 01:15:02,460
you know, Luigi's Mansion game for 3DS, but we have DLC for a Mario game.

1655
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:03,460
Sweet.

1656
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:05,460
That's sort of Luigi.

1657
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:08,520
That's like almost like a new game, but not.

1658
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:12,260
See we understand online because we put out DLC.

1659
01:15:12,260 --> 01:15:13,260
We're hip.

1660
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:14,260
We're cool.

1661
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:15,260
We're just like those other consoles.

1662
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:16,260
Love us.

1663
01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:21,280
So that's, I just don't think that they have anything new to show because look at it.

1664
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:22,280
Okay.

1665
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:26,280
The stuff that they're talking about releasing first quarter of this year hasn't come out

1666
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:27,280
yet.

1667
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:30,680
We're talking like third quarter when that stuff's finally hitting the market.

1668
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:36,980
So really the only new thing, if you call it new, is going to be the HD remake of Windwaker

1669
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:40,840
and maybe one more game, but that's it.

1670
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:42,080
They don't really have much to announce.

1671
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:46,780
Are they really going to talk about Pikmin again or Wii Fit U again or, you know, they

1672
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:51,380
have 3DS games, which if, you know, they have a ton of 3DS games coming out, so no worries

1673
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:52,380
there.

1674
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:55,340
But as far as the Wii U goes, they don't really have anything to show.

1675
01:15:55,340 --> 01:15:59,340
Spike, I want to come to you with this because I know you've been following this stuff a

1676
01:15:59,340 --> 01:16:02,340
very long time as well and probably are going to say something about it on your own show.

1677
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:04,340
What, do you think Loki's on the right track?

1678
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:11,280
Well, I mean, you know, we, we know that they have a Mario universe as we're all expecting

1679
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:15,780
it to be called and Kart 8, they've already said those are going to be playable on the

1680
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:22,100
floor at E3 and, you know, they said they're going to show the new Smash Brothers game

1681
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:25,360
in video and picture form.

1682
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:29,060
So they have some things to show, but I don't think they have a great deal to show.

1683
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:34,060
I think this is probably a good choice for them to do sort of a scaled down presentation.

1684
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:40,500
I kind of have to agree after the flop-tasticness of the last couple of E3 conferences.

1685
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:45,000
You know, and again, I appreciated at last year's E3, for example, that Nintendo took

1686
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:50,120
a lot of time to talk about game mechanics and game design of Nintendo land of all things,

1687
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:53,560
but still at least they were talking about game design rather than boobs and explosions,

1688
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:54,560
I guess.

1689
01:16:54,560 --> 01:17:01,560
They did talk about boobs and explosions, I think they'd sell more consoles.

1690
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:03,040
Sad commentary on games.

1691
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:04,620
That sounds like my house.

1692
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:07,160
You do know it has Bayonetta 2, right?

1693
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:08,160
Eventually.

1694
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:09,160
No, seriously.

1695
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:12,580
I mean, that's the problem with Nintendo is they fucking, they talk of big game, like

1696
01:17:12,580 --> 01:17:14,720
how we're going to target the core audience.

1697
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:19,580
We're going to target those older, you know, people that want to play games, you know,

1698
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:20,580
on the Wii U and stuff.

1699
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:23,780
And it's fucking child game, child game, child game, child game, Mario.

1700
01:17:23,780 --> 01:17:30,460
I mean, Mario sells it's, you know, for everybody, I guess, but there are no real, I don't think

1701
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:31,460
they take it seriously.

1702
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:35,220
They just kind of, you know, this time around they say, okay, listen, we're not going to

1703
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:38,360
put on a lot of games right now, first quarter, because we're going to let third parties kind

1704
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:40,000
of shine, I guess.

1705
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:45,480
And then, wow, that, that, that, you know, amazing Spider-Man game from last year really

1706
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:50,480
shown on your console and, oh, Need for Speed Most Wanted that came out back in the fall.

1707
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:55,300
Woo, that, that's awesome now coming out in March, you know, it's the definitive version

1708
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:56,300
now because it's...

1709
01:17:56,300 --> 01:18:00,840
Well, you know, Nintendo couldn't expect that Ubisoft was going to be like, LOL, bye bitch.

1710
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:06,640
I still think that, uh, they're making a big mistake making Bayonetta 2 a Wii U exclusive.

1711
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,760
Sega is.

1712
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:11,060
I think they're going to lose on it.

1713
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:13,180
I wouldn't exist without Nintendo though.

1714
01:18:13,180 --> 01:18:15,300
Yeah, Nintendo's the one that brought it back.

1715
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:18,580
Same time Sega has done, taken a lot of risks on the Wii, I mean, look at, they put out

1716
01:18:18,580 --> 01:18:22,300
Mad World and stuff and Mad World is a pretty awesome game, but it's also an awesome game

1717
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:23,700
didn't sell very well.

1718
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:28,860
And also the Conduit was another Sega game that they put out, I think that was Sega.

1719
01:18:28,860 --> 01:18:30,540
I think that was Sega.

1720
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:35,320
But, once again, another game that didn't sell well at all.

1721
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:40,720
I just want to clarify, I don't think Sega's involved in Bayonetta 2, right?

1722
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:44,760
But they own the IP, they are part of the licensing for the game to exist.

1723
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:50,120
But Nintendo's bankrolling it, Platinum's been very open about the fact that without

1724
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:52,800
Nintendo's involvement this game just wouldn't exist.

1725
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:57,400
There you go, Bayonetta and Smash Brothers.

1726
01:18:58,380 --> 01:18:59,580
It's enough for me.

1727
01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:05,700
But I think that, as much as I love Bayonetta, it's not enough for me to go out and get a

1728
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:09,820
Wii U because honestly the Wii U just does not bring that much new to the table, oh yeah,

1729
01:19:09,820 --> 01:19:11,980
we have a tablet, yay.

1730
01:19:11,980 --> 01:19:18,900
But if they put out Bayonetta 2 on multi-systems, hell yeah, I would buy it.

1731
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:23,900
I'm just saying there's a lot of people who would have been into it.

1732
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:25,940
I think it's going to be a repeat of the 3DS.

1733
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:28,320
I think it's going to be fine come holidays.

1734
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:31,880
Maybe I'll be wrong, but I think it's going to be just fine during the holidays.

1735
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:35,720
I hope so.

1736
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:39,720
I mean, I don't want to see them fail, but at the same time, it's been a console that

1737
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:42,340
there's no reason for me to buy that system.

1738
01:19:42,340 --> 01:19:44,080
There's nothing that really wowed me about it.

1739
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:48,240
The 3DS is like, oh hey, 3D games set without glasses, that's kind of cool.

1740
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:51,280
Playing on the second screen, I don't really give a shit about that.

1741
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:53,880
It's like, it's not that big a deal to me.

1742
01:19:53,900 --> 01:20:00,100
The one game I was excited about apparently sucks, so tank, tank, tank.

1743
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:04,500
We've been playing on two screens for how long now with the DS, so that's not really

1744
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:05,500
a new thing.

1745
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:11,740
I think the big difference between the 3DS and the Wii U in terms of positioning is that

1746
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:17,300
the 3DS sort of owns handheld right now, at least in the US.

1747
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:19,740
There's the PSP, but that's it.

1748
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:27,240
It's the PSP, I'm sorry, the Vita, but who owns the Vita, and the 3DS.

1749
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:33,000
But the Wii U is coming online a year before a very crowded console market is launching

1750
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:39,440
a brand new generation of consoles, and it doesn't seem to be in the same league hardware-wise

1751
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:43,160
as the others, which is going to make multi-platform development difficult.

1752
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:47,840
And also when we consider, though, that they're saying that now a lot of the market's kind

1753
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:51,960
of going to the handhelds and phones and tablets and that kind of thing, and so if

1754
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:55,900
you own the handheld market, who gives a crap if your console's not really doing that well

1755
01:20:55,900 --> 01:21:02,180
because those people probably have a 3DS and they're fine, or, you know, they can buy a

1756
01:21:02,180 --> 01:21:03,180
3DS.

1757
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:06,160
All right, in the interest of time, and I feel like we've had this conversation before,

1758
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:08,160
let's move on with the stories.

1759
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:16,240
All right, so let's see, let's talk a little bit about more Wii U stuff.

1760
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:18,160
As we've said, it hasn't been doing that well.

1761
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:25,720
In fact, they have missed their target, which was just about three and a half million units,

1762
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:31,160
and they missed it by 500,000, if I remember correctly.

1763
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:36,720
They are targeting, though, for the next fiscal year, nine million units, so they're really

1764
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:41,080
going to have to pick up the pace if that's going to happen.

1765
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:47,680
I want to say that they've only sold, I think it was like 390,000 units just over the last

1766
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:56,760
few months, and I think the first three months were 390,000 units, if I remember correctly.

1767
01:21:56,760 --> 01:22:04,080
And of course, 3DS is doing, you know, is rocking, they're up to 31.09 million units,

1768
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:11,200
and the Wii's still getting close to 100 million, 99.84 million.

1769
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:13,400
That's a lot of systems.

1770
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:18,520
That's got to disappoint them that they've only been able to sell three point, almost

1771
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:23,880
three and a half million when there's 99 million Wii owners out there.

1772
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:26,640
That's no penetration.

1773
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:36,000
And on top of that, Satoru Iwata, he is now the CEO, or the Nintendo of America CEO.

1774
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:40,040
And just to be clear, Reggie Fils-Aime was not overthrown or anything like that, he's

1775
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:42,960
still there.

1776
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:46,720
I'm assuming this is more to kind of try to bring the two together, so that the two don't

1777
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:51,240
operate in different silos, that's my thought, is a corporate move like this, but...

1778
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:56,580
Well, Iwata's been definitely more upfront, you know, he's been kind of the figure in

1779
01:22:56,620 --> 01:23:00,180
all those Nintendo Directs and stuff, so...

1780
01:23:00,180 --> 01:23:01,780
It just wouldn't be the same without Reggie.

1781
01:23:01,780 --> 01:23:03,820
Well, he's still there, you know, he's not...

1782
01:23:03,820 --> 01:23:06,900
And his jaw.

1783
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:09,900
Let me quickly cover this, this was already referenced a little bit ago, and I think a

1784
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:13,260
lot of you guys kind of knew this already, Captain Spike mentioned a little bit ago,

1785
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:18,680
Nintendo was, said before, Mario 3D, Mario Kart Wii U, they're going to be at the E3

1786
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:23,200
show this year, but kind of the news in this is that there was a press release this week

1787
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:27,640
from Nintendo of America and Nintendo Europe that said these games are slated in the next

1788
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:32,240
few months, so you could infer that Mario 3D and Mario Kart Wii U, these are not titles

1789
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:37,080
to be shown for 2014, these are titles to be shown for the holiday release.

1790
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:39,920
Running down the list real quick, just so we're clear, these are games that Nintendo

1791
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:44,840
says in the next few months, Mario Kart for Wii U, Super Mario Brothers for Wii U, Wii

1792
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:48,600
Fit for Wii U, which has kind of fallen off the radar, but that's kind of one of those

1793
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:51,560
games, they were pitching that in the beginning, and it disappeared, so it's kind of another

1794
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:56,440
one of those games that, you know, oh, now you see it, now you don't, but Wii Fit could

1795
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:59,560
be interesting, depending on what they do with it, that could be an interesting game

1796
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:07,120
changer, Pikmin, which we knew, that's happening, Legend of Zelda, Wii U and Nintendo 3DS, and

1797
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:14,280
I'm assuming that's Wind Waker, and Link to the Past, and Mario and Luigi on the 3DS,

1798
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:19,680
and Pokemon X and Y obviously, so that's, you're pretty much looking at Nintendo's holiday

1799
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:23,400
lineup right there. I mean, there might be one or two other surprises here, but that's,

1800
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:28,720
you know, that's in a nutshell. That better not be another new Super Mario Brothers game.

1801
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:32,280
Well like, oh no, I think it's gonna be a Wii, like you were saying a minute ago, kind

1802
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:36,800
of like a Galaxy type thing. Well, they had said that they intended last year to stick

1803
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:41,680
to doing the, you know, sort of one new title per generation, and just expanding those with

1804
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:47,800
DLC like we're seeing with the Luigi DLC. I just hope it's not another new Super Mario

1805
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:54,080
Brothers game. Or anything that resembles that. I think because, I think the Luigi DLC should

1806
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:57,800
tell you it's not another Super Mario games, because why would they waste all the effort

1807
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:03,120
to do that, to just turn around literally four months later and say, and now it's a

1808
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:09,080
new game! I just, I don't see that happening. Because? It's gonna be a 3D Mario, whether

1809
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:15,160
it's Universe, whether it's Mario 64-esque, or Sunshine for fuck's sake, it's gonna be

1810
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:22,160
something in that vein. Sunshine, lol. I could see them doing it though. I mean, just, why

1811
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:28,040
not a new Luigi game then? Because we can do DLC and just easily just shoehorn it into

1812
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:32,460
the. Maybe that's why they keep hyping this Luigi, maybe the new game is Super Luigi Galaxy

1813
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:36,040
or something, like maybe that's the twist. And no one will buy it. This whole fucking

1814
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:39,040
thing. No one will buy it. This whole thing has, what do you mean no one will buy Super

1815
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:43,560
Luigi Galaxy? Okay, one person will buy it, but no one else will buy it. Are you smoking

1816
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:48,880
because Mario Galaxy was like one of the best games they put out on the Wii, period. If

1817
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:55,400
they are, if, I'm not talking about just re-skinned with Luigi, I'm talking about a new game in

1818
01:25:55,400 --> 01:26:00,720
that universe and everything, but Luigi happens to be the star because it's the year of Luigi,

1819
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:04,760
and that's the joke. That's why you haven't seen anything else, because the bombshell's

1820
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:09,280
gonna get dropped at E3. No one should make jokes when your system's suffering like that.

1821
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:11,280
This is not time for joking, this is time for kicking ass.

1822
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:17,280
Ah, I'm done. Dark Sakura, save me.

1823
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:18,280
Are you spent, Rob?

1824
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:19,280
I'm spent.

1825
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:21,280
I found the contest that I'm gonna be in now.

1826
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:22,280
Oh?

1827
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:28,280
Well, you found it for me, but I'm gonna do it. Because Rob does all my hard work for me.

1828
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:31,280
Okay, then as your agent, I want 20%.

1829
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:34,280
As my agent, I'll just keep buying you coffee.

1830
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:35,280
That works.

1831
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:42,280
Speaking of which, so Sega has a thing now where they're wanting people to design a new

1832
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:50,280
character for it to be the face of the company. You know, not Sonic, just a new mascot. And

1833
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:57,280
the contest is open through June 9th this year, and it has to be an original character

1834
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:05,280
and there's a link on, I can get the link later, but it's also not just limited to the

1835
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:12,280
Japanese audience, it's worldwide, which I'm gonna get the hell out of this. So basically,

1836
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:20,280
they're gonna be doing a new live web series called Sega Raw on a Nico Nico, but that's

1837
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:28,280
what the mascot's for, it's for the show. So, I'm not giving you guys my ideas. No.

1838
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:35,280
But they want something unique, something fun, something that's gonna, you know, basically

1839
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:41,280
fit what they're trying to do. Because the show is, I'm trying to find something in,

1840
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:47,280
basically it's just gonna be more of a fan show. And there's translations for the rules

1841
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:53,280
up, so you just need a Nico Nico account, and there is an English version on the website

1842
01:27:53,280 --> 01:28:02,280
to sign up for that. And so I will, let me get the URL, if you go to, it's actually S-E-I-G-A

1843
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:09,280
dot Nico video, N-I-C-O video dot J-P, there should be a link from there, and I will post

1844
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:14,280
the link in the chatroom for people here. Because maybe Sega will hire me.

1845
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:18,280
Got a great idea for a Sega character. It's like Sonic the Hedgehog, but he's black,

1846
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:21,280
and he's got guns. Oh, shut up.

1847
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:28,280
Well, uh, I wouldn't give out too many of these ideas, because coming up in part B of

1848
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:33,280
Orange Lawn's radio tonight, we are going to do a list list. I can't participate, Rob.

1849
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:36,280
Why not? Because I'm not giving anybody my ideas.

1850
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:40,280
Tough shit. Oh, and he's gonna be named Shadow. Shadow the Hedgehog.

1851
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:47,280
Here's the deal, the topic for tonight's list list, mascot we most want to gift to Sega

1852
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:52,280
on behalf of O-L-R. So mascot we most want to gift to Sega on behalf of O-L-R.

1853
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:55,280
Don't send your answers yet, just think about it, we'll come back to this in part B.

1854
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:58,280
By the way, a little bit more to this, is if you want to find those translated rules,

1855
01:28:58,280 --> 01:29:01,280
look for Yakuza Fan at NeoGaf.

1856
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:07,280
Alright. Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

1857
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:10,280
Do we gotta? Mm-hmm. Okay. We gotta.

1858
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:15,280
Girl. Well, this week, there's Deadly Premonition, the director's cut on PlayStation 3,

1859
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:24,280
and Soul Sacrifice on the Vita. Also, on PC, Xbox Live Arcade, and the PlayStation Network,

1860
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:28,280
Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon. That's really the only game you need to buy.

1861
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:34,280
Thank you for that review. Alright.

1862
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:36,280
Oh, I wasn't laughing at that.

1863
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:41,280
Oh, what were you laughing at? Oh, because everybody's shouting out their answers in chat right now.

1864
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:46,280
Wait, guys, wait. Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some releases that are coming out in Japan.

1865
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:53,280
I gotta be honest, I'm sizing up the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360. I don't really see anything for Japan this week.

1866
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:59,280
I'm guessing it's kind of a slower period over there right now, but I don't see any releases till May 16th.

1867
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:09,280
Trying to look quickly at Vita or the handhelds? Is it just a dry spell this week? Wii U? Question mark?

1868
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:15,280
No, I'm showing it's a dry spell in Japan this week. You know why? Why?

1869
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:18,280
It's because they're afraid. You know what they're afraid of?

1870
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:23,280
Three brand new fucking trailers for Grand Theft Auto 5 on the 30th. That's right.

1871
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:27,280
That's all you need to do that day. It's my wedding anniversary, and I'm going out and eating lunch,

1872
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:32,280
but I'm coming back and I'm fucking watching those trailers over and over and over again.

1873
01:30:32,280 --> 01:30:37,280
Didn't we get you a shirt that said game over? Are you gonna make Nelly watch them with you?

1874
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:41,280
Should I? Yes, I should. Does she get into it? No. No? She could care less.

1875
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:45,280
I would think she'd think it's hilarious. You know what? We need to pick the most violent game,

1876
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:49,280
violent bloody gory game ever and have Nelly and your mom review it.

1877
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:53,280
My wife wouldn't like it, not because it's bloody, but because it's a game.

1878
01:30:54,280 --> 01:30:56,280
That would be the best review ever.

1879
01:30:56,280 --> 01:31:00,280
I'm not positive, but I believe that in Japan, Tomb Raider comes out this week? The Japanese version?

1880
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:03,280
It was last week. It was on my list last week, yes.

1881
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:06,280
I can't have President Cat. Nice try though with the plug.

1882
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:09,280
Yeah, I try. In case my bosses are listening.

1883
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:14,280
By the way, I was trying to explain President Cat to somebody the other day, and I was like,

1884
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:18,280
but it's not really President. It's more of a delinquent in charge.

1885
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:23,280
I found a game coming out on May 9th. That's the closest game release. That's like two weeks.

1886
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:30,280
It's on the PSP. Cud Wafter, converted edition, comes out on the PSP.

1887
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:35,280
And the box art is just a girl, and she's sitting at the table with her elbows on the table.

1888
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:38,280
She's just waiting, like the rest of us for Japanese release dates.

1889
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:42,280
That's like 90% of all PSP games in Japan.

1890
01:31:42,280 --> 01:31:45,280
A chick with her arms folded, waiting.

1891
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:48,280
Can you say the name of that again?

1892
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:54,280
K-U-D-W-A-F-T-E-R. To me it's Cud Wafter, but it's probably Cud Wafter.

1893
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:55,280
It's German.

1894
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:58,280
Oh, that almost sounded dirty.

1895
01:31:58,280 --> 01:32:02,280
Everything in German sounds dirty. You can say strudel and it sounds dirty.

1896
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:07,280
Cud Wafer. It's about crackers that cows chew on.

1897
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:11,280
Then let's go to the Old Kingdom and see what's coming out over there.

1898
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:14,280
I would like to go find out personally, but unfortunately I'm poor.

1899
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:18,280
So, God, I'm not even ready, Rob. What's up with me?

1900
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:20,280
Amy, I thought you didn't come to the show prepared.

1901
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:24,280
Girl! Hold on. Oh, no wonder, because you linked me the wrong month.

1902
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:27,280
They're your links!

1903
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:29,280
I blame you! I blame you for everything.

1904
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:35,280
Oh, Slidekick looked up what this is.

1905
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:37,280
Cud Wafter or whatever.

1906
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:40,280
It's a Japanese adult visual novel developed by Key.

1907
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:43,280
Released on June 25th, 2010 for Windows PC.

1908
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:45,280
So I guess it's the PSP version.

1909
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:47,280
And the cover sounded like what?

1910
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:51,280
Oh, yeah. When I first looked at that I was like, oh, she's gonna get naked.

1911
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:54,280
Oh, it's a moe game.

1912
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:56,280
She looks too young.

1913
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:59,280
That button on her head is like huge.

1914
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:02,280
I was just thinking, does she smell like kudzu? No.

1915
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:06,280
And fifth dream in our chat room says, Cunt Waiter.

1916
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:10,280
I've had a few of those.

1917
01:33:12,280 --> 01:33:14,280
I worked for one of those.

1918
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:16,280
You win.

1919
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:17,280
Alright, moving on.

1920
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:21,280
On May 1st, we have Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon.

1921
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,280
I was still thinking about getting it.

1922
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:25,280
Injustice Gods Among Us. Game is fucking weird.

1923
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:29,280
Soul Sacrifice on Vita and Fez on PC.

1924
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:31,280
Now I'm thinking of The Doctor.

1925
01:33:32,280 --> 01:33:34,280
Cause he wears a fez. Fezzes are cool.

1926
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:36,280
You're dying to comment on something, Kevin Spike.

1927
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:38,280
Oh, say it.

1928
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:40,280
No, no, um.

1929
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:42,280
Cunt Waiter.

1930
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:44,280
Injustice is actually really good. That's all.

1931
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:48,280
I didn't, I just thought that Wonder Woman's hair looked weird.

1932
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:51,280
So you're gonna hate an entire fucking game because the hair was wrong?

1933
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:52,280
You know.

1934
01:33:52,280 --> 01:33:54,280
It's DC. I hate everything.

1935
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:58,280
You know, Jaime, there are, there is DLC that could probably fix that.

1936
01:33:58,280 --> 01:34:00,280
I mean, I'm sure she's got numerous outfits.

1937
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:03,280
Well, they could, you know, DLC to make her Jean Grey.

1938
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:04,280
No.

1939
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:05,280
Then she would be awesome.

1940
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:08,280
Okay, okay, I will stop and say this.

1941
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:10,280
I love Wonder Woman and I like Batman.

1942
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:14,280
Although, I cannot read anything Batman related that Gail Simone doesn't write.

1943
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:16,280
She is my hero.

1944
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:20,280
But I did read Blackest Night with the whole Star Sapphire thing and that was pretty hot.

1945
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:22,280
There.

1946
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:24,280
My one nod to DC.

1947
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:29,280
That's it.

1948
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:31,280
Alright.

1949
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:32,280
So.

1950
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:33,280
Movies.

1951
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:35,280
Sony likes movies, right?

1952
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:37,280
So Sony said, hey.

1953
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:40,280
Why don't we take some of our franchises and make them into movies?

1954
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:42,280
Sound like a fantastic idea?

1955
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:44,280
Well, it is.

1956
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:45,280
According to them.

1957
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:47,280
Ratchet and Clank.

1958
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:50,280
Coming to theaters in 2015.

1959
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:55,280
And it's actually being done by animation company Rainmaker Entertainment.

1960
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:59,280
And I guess the digital media studio Blockade Entertainment.

1961
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:01,280
And I guess they produced.

1962
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:03,280
CG was a flick.

1963
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:04,280
Escape from Planet Earth.

1964
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:06,280
I have no idea what the fuck that is.

1965
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:07,280
But they made that movie.

1966
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:08,280
So.

1967
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:11,280
They've made a movie before.

1968
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:15,280
And then Heavenly Sword is going to be coming to.

1969
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:16,280
Becoming a movie as well.

1970
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:20,280
Except it's direct to video because you know obviously a game this important.

1971
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:22,280
That never had a sequel.

1972
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:25,280
Cannot be going to the theaters because no one would know what the fuck it is.

1973
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:27,280
And so direct the.

1974
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:29,280
Video it goes.

1975
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:32,280
Also being done by Blockade Entertainment.

1976
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:36,280
What are you laughing at over there?

1977
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:37,280
Kudwafter.

1978
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:38,280
Stop it.

1979
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:42,280
That's like Pee Wee Herman's secret word.

1980
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:45,280
Today's word is Kudwafter.

1981
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:50,280
Oh boy.

1982
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:51,280
I don't know.

1983
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:52,280
Heavenly Sword.

1984
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:53,280
It just.

1985
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:56,280
I guess.

1986
01:35:56,280 --> 01:35:59,280
Because God of War would have been too good.

1987
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:01,280
I don't really know why.

1988
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:04,280
I think I would rather see a Kudwafter movie than Heavenly Sword.

1989
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:08,280
Like a Heavenly Sword movie sounds like something that you know.

1990
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:10,280
Uwe Boll would do.

1991
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:11,280
I mean cause.

1992
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:14,280
I don't know if he's made any movies lately.

1993
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:19,280
No I think he's been laughed out of Hollywood completely.

1994
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:22,280
Yeah he's laughing all the way to the bank.

1995
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:24,280
Cause he's banked a lot of money.

1996
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:28,280
Ratchet and Clank sounds like he could be cute though.

1997
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:30,280
That I think could work.

1998
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:31,280
Anime is the way to go.

1999
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:32,280
Yeah.

2000
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:33,280
I mean after all.

2001
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:35,280
Angry Birds are getting the movie.

2002
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:37,280
I don't know how.

2003
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:38,280
How?

2004
01:36:38,280 --> 01:36:39,280
They have cartoons.

2005
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:43,280
They commit suicide by launching themselves at pigs.

2006
01:36:44,280 --> 01:36:46,280
But they'll do well in the Middle East.

2007
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:48,280
Alright.

2008
01:36:48,280 --> 01:36:49,280
I'm done by leaving.

2009
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:51,280
One more story for you guys.

2010
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:53,280
And then we're gonna get to the classic game of the week.

2011
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:54,280
This has to do with Twin Gal.

2012
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:56,280
Speaking of classic games.

2013
01:36:56,280 --> 01:36:57,280
Twin Galaxies.

2014
01:36:57,280 --> 01:36:58,280
They've been around forever.

2015
01:36:58,280 --> 01:37:01,280
They would do the video tapes and track the scores.

2016
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:04,280
They've been like shut down for about six.

2017
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:05,280
Well I shouldn't say shut down.

2018
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:08,280
But they've been on a break from the actual score tracking for about six months.

2019
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:10,280
They've been doing some transitions.

2020
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:12,280
But now they're up and running again.

2021
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:13,280
But here's the thing.

2022
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:17,280
Under their new system you will have to pay to have your scores reviewed.

2023
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:19,280
Which you know it doesn't make sense though.

2024
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:22,280
Because like legitimately they're looking through all the footage.

2025
01:37:22,280 --> 01:37:24,280
You know and they're watching it.

2026
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:25,280
Hours at a time.

2027
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:26,280
That's hours at a time.

2028
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:28,280
That just means Billy Mitchell's gonna pay extra.

2029
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:31,280
Review mine first and eat my barbecue sauce.

2030
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:32,280
Perhaps.

2031
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:34,280
$25 for one submission.

2032
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:36,280
$60 for three submissions.

2033
01:37:36,280 --> 01:37:38,280
$75 for five submissions.

2034
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:42,280
But I believe based on the length that might count as more than one submission.

2035
01:37:42,280 --> 01:37:43,280
So go read this.

2036
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:44,280
Go read.

2037
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:45,280
What did you say over there?

2038
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:47,280
That bears repeating.

2039
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:49,280
Say it into a mic or don't say it at all.

2040
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:50,280
That's what she said.

2041
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:51,280
Okay thank you very much.

2042
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:52,280
Alright.

2043
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:53,280
Anyhow.

2044
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:55,280
Each video can only do one game.

2045
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:58,280
Although you can do more than one score in the video.

2046
01:37:58,280 --> 01:37:59,280
That makes no sense to me.

2047
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:01,280
Unless it was two different settings maybe.

2048
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:04,280
Because like why would you show one score and then a better score.

2049
01:38:04,280 --> 01:38:06,280
Like just do the one score.

2050
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:07,280
Anyway.

2051
01:38:07,280 --> 01:38:08,280
Whatever.

2052
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:10,280
So there you go.

2053
01:38:10,280 --> 01:38:11,280
Twin Galaxies.

2054
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:14,280
You can submit your score for $25.

2055
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:16,280
I don't know.

2056
01:38:16,280 --> 01:38:20,280
There's been some stuff going around saying that because now they're under new ownership

2057
01:38:20,280 --> 01:38:24,280
that it's not quite as respectable anymore.

2058
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:28,280
That happens with any company.

2059
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:31,280
And also apparently that I don't know if their database crashed or something.

2060
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:33,280
But they lost some of the scores.

2061
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:34,280
It did.

2062
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:37,280
But I'm glad you brought that up because they did comment on it.

2063
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:42,280
They said the old database was damaged but not completely irretrievable.

2064
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:45,280
So I guess they got some of it back.

2065
01:38:50,280 --> 01:38:52,280
But I'm glad that still exists.

2066
01:38:52,280 --> 01:38:55,280
Because there's still lots of fans of the very classic arcade games out there.

2067
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:57,280
And they're still playing them.

2068
01:38:57,280 --> 01:38:59,280
People are still breaking Donkey Kong score records.

2069
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:02,280
So I'm glad something like this exists.

2070
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:04,280
Alright.

2071
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:05,280
Well speaking of classic games.

2072
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:08,280
Every week here on Orange Launch Radio we like to take a trip down memory lane

2073
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:10,280
and visit the classic game of the week.

2074
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:16,280
This is the part of the show where Dark Soccer is going to jump into the gaming vault

2075
01:39:16,280 --> 01:39:21,280
and find a game that she thinks, hey, record this for two hours.

2076
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:26,280
And then pay me 25 bucks for telling you how awesome it was.

2077
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:28,280
Dark Soccer, what's the classic game of the week?

2078
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:31,280
Okay, I can't even do it, Rob.

2079
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:32,280
I can't do it.

2080
01:39:32,280 --> 01:39:34,280
Because you have to start the music.

2081
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:35,280
Fair enough.

2082
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:36,280
Here's the music.

2083
01:39:36,280 --> 01:39:37,280
And then I'm going to shoot myself in the head.

2084
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:45,280
How has this never been the classic game of the week?

2085
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:46,280
I have no fucking clue.

2086
01:39:46,280 --> 01:39:47,280
This has been a joke forever on OLR.

2087
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:48,280
I love this song.

2088
01:39:48,280 --> 01:39:50,280
Well, I was going to put in Ridge Racer.

2089
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:52,280
And I was like, have I done Ridge Racer?

2090
01:39:52,280 --> 01:39:54,280
Oh my god, I haven't done Daytona.

2091
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:56,280
And Dan isn't playing this shit out of Daytona.

2092
01:39:56,280 --> 01:40:00,280
So I hear doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo in my nightmares.

2093
01:40:00,280 --> 01:40:02,280
Wait, you mean you hear this?

2094
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:08,280
You know what, I have a napkin and I can make it into Elise Eleven.

2095
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:14,280
Somebody out there on the internet, if they haven't done it already, needs to do like a dubstep remix of this song.

2096
01:40:14,280 --> 01:40:16,280
Because that would be the most hilarious.

2097
01:40:16,280 --> 01:40:21,280
There is a video of the guy who sang for AM2 singing the song live.

2098
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:23,280
And he just looks like he's having the time of his life.

2099
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:30,280
Like, it's better than chocolate and getting laid, I guess.

2100
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:32,280
But it was pretty funny.

2101
01:40:32,280 --> 01:40:34,280
Anyway, okay, so Daytona USA.

2102
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:37,280
And by the way, the other song I put in was the classic Rolling Start.

2103
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:40,280
Let me play a little bit of that.

2104
01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:44,280
We can hear this, or as I call it, Roaring Star.

2105
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:48,280
Oh no no no.

2106
01:40:48,280 --> 01:40:51,280
Okay, I have to tell where all of my hate for this game comes from.

2107
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:53,280
And it's not because it's a bad game.

2108
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:56,280
If it was a bad game, it would not be on my Classic Game of the Week list.

2109
01:40:56,280 --> 01:40:58,280
I worked for Namco Arcade.

2110
01:40:58,280 --> 01:41:04,280
We had Time Crisis, we had Ridge Racer, we had Tekken 3 before everybody else did.

2111
01:41:04,280 --> 01:41:06,280
I had a Pac-Man hat.

2112
01:41:06,280 --> 01:41:10,280
I had a Polaroid camera that I got from all the leftover tickets that the kids would leave in the machine.

2113
01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:13,280
And I had, like, ten Tekken 3 shirts.

2114
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:14,280
Like, the arcade only ones.

2115
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:18,280
I loved working there, except for this one machine right across from the ticket counter.

2116
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:21,280
And it would always be in loud attract mode.

2117
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:23,280
Do do do do do do do do.

2118
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:26,280
I'm like, can we, can I take an axe to it?

2119
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:27,280
Can I break it?

2120
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:30,280
Can we just say that some redneck came in and sat on it?

2121
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:33,280
Because, I mean, it's Alabama, no one cares.

2122
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:37,280
So, um, I wanted it to die just because of the attract.

2123
01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:42,280
The only other attract that was as annoying as that came close was Time Crisis 2.

2124
01:41:42,280 --> 01:41:45,280
Oh, that was an awful one.

2125
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:48,280
The voice acting was hideous.

2126
01:41:48,280 --> 01:41:49,280
Oh my god.

2127
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:50,280
So anyway, anyway, anyway.

2128
01:41:50,280 --> 01:41:52,280
Back to the game.

2129
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:53,280
It is a racing game.

2130
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:57,280
It was developed by Sega AM2, which we love AM2.

2131
01:41:57,280 --> 01:42:00,280
I mean, AM2 gave us freakin' Burning Rangers.

2132
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:02,280
Hi, same guy singing, by the way.

2133
01:42:02,280 --> 01:42:09,280
Um, so, uh, it came out as a limited release in 1993 and a full release in 1994.

2134
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:13,280
And it is one of the highest grossing arcade machines of all time.

2135
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:19,280
It was the first title that came out on the Model 2 arcade board, which is easily emulated now.

2136
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:25,280
And it was pretty much the best racing machine that came out at the time.

2137
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:33,280
It was lower poly than Virtua Racing, but it was fully texture mapped, so it gave it more of a realistic feel.

2138
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:37,280
Excepted the serious draw-in problems like, oh, I'm driving on clouds.

2139
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:38,280
Oh, look, there's a mountain.

2140
01:42:38,280 --> 01:42:40,280
Oh, look, there's Sonic's face.

2141
01:42:40,280 --> 01:42:41,280
You know?

2142
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:46,280
But, um, they did re-release the game as, um, oh, one thing I actually have to say.

2143
01:42:46,280 --> 01:42:52,280
It's actually one of the few 3D games at the time that maintained a steady 60 frames per second frame rate.

2144
01:42:52,280 --> 01:42:54,280
So that's pretty crazy.

2145
01:42:54,280 --> 01:42:57,280
Given that I can't get that on some games most of the time.

2146
01:42:57,280 --> 01:43:03,280
Um, so it was re-released in 2010 as Sega Racing Classic, but I don't know if anyone has played it.

2147
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:05,280
They, um, took out the vocals.

2148
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:09,280
It just has, like, some sort of generic singing over it.

2149
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:10,280
Like, it was some background vocal.

2150
01:43:10,280 --> 01:43:13,280
But the main lyric part of it is gone.

2151
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:14,280
It's like you're playing karaoke mode.

2152
01:43:14,280 --> 01:43:15,280
So it's just not the same.

2153
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:19,280
So you are, um, in a stock car called the Hornet.

2154
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:23,280
And you have to race, um, you know, three tracks.

2155
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:25,280
Uh, either automatic or manual.

2156
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:27,280
You know, choose your transmission.

2157
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:32,280
And, uh, it, uh, you know, you had different ways the camera could look.

2158
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:34,280
You could look, um, behind the driver's seat.

2159
01:43:34,280 --> 01:43:39,280
You could be, uh, you know, uh, a very first person.

2160
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:41,280
And there were deluxe cabinets.

2161
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:48,280
Because, um, I played Daytona USA, um, the first time I played this game was in Las Vegas.

2162
01:43:48,280 --> 01:43:50,280
And this was when I was still living in Alabama.

2163
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:51,280
And my mom lived in Phoenix.

2164
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:54,280
We flew to Phoenix and then drove to Las Vegas.

2165
01:43:54,280 --> 01:43:57,280
And they had the full multi-car setup.

2166
01:43:57,280 --> 01:43:59,280
And I was like, oh.

2167
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:01,280
It was when the Luxor had a Sega arcade.

2168
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:04,280
So I was completely in heaven.

2169
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:07,280
And I, I paid the five bucks a game to play it twice.

2170
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:11,280
And my mom was screaming at me for my fiscal irresponsibility.

2171
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:14,280
So, um, I loved it then.

2172
01:44:14,280 --> 01:44:16,280
Hated it when I worked at an arcade.

2173
01:44:16,280 --> 01:44:19,280
So, yeah, it, it was really awesome.

2174
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:27,280
Um, and they, uh, actually, um, came out before there was the Daytona USA museum.

2175
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:30,280
But it had, um, all that attached to it.

2176
01:44:30,280 --> 01:44:38,280
Um, there, uh, I think it was that, um, it became out at Sega Racing Classic because they lost the Daytona license.

2177
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:46,280
Uh, so basically, um, yeah, this, um, the Sega Racing Classic runs at 720p.

2178
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:51,280
Um, and like I said, it lost the vocal tracks because of the licensing.

2179
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:58,280
Now for the home versions, there was a Daytona USA that came out on Saturday 1995 and to Windows in 1996.

2180
01:44:58,280 --> 01:45:03,280
It did drop the frame rates significantly, about 20 frames per second.

2181
01:45:03,280 --> 01:45:06,280
And, um, clipped pretty, pretty nasty.

2182
01:45:06,280 --> 01:45:09,280
It was not the best version.

2183
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:12,280
Um, however, it handled well.

2184
01:45:12,280 --> 01:45:17,280
And they had planned on doing one on the 32X, but we all know what happened with 32X.

2185
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:19,280
At least we got Space Harrier, right?

2186
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:28,280
So, uh, there were, um, eight tracks, including the original three from the arcade and two additional tracks, um, from the Sega Championship Circuit Edition.

2187
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:32,280
And then there were final three and that was, um, for the Dreamcast version.

2188
01:45:32,280 --> 01:45:34,280
The Dreamcast version was pretty good.

2189
01:45:34,280 --> 01:45:39,280
They completely, uh, redid all of the graphics.

2190
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:41,280
The pop-up was removed.

2191
01:45:41,280 --> 01:45:44,280
Um, the cars had transparent glass, higher poly.

2192
01:45:44,280 --> 01:45:50,280
It was basically like the HD version, except it controlled like shit.

2193
01:45:50,280 --> 01:45:51,280
Just saying.

2194
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:53,280
I guess you can't have it all, huh?

2195
01:45:53,280 --> 01:46:00,280
Um, they did, um, an arcade faithful port for, um, PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade.

2196
01:46:00,280 --> 01:46:06,280
And it has widescreen, high-def, eight-player multiplayer over Xbox Live or the PlayStation Network.

2197
01:46:06,280 --> 01:46:09,280
Uh, more content with different challenges.

2198
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:17,280
Karaoke mode, which I am embarrassed to say my husband has sat in karaoke mode, singing, roaring start.

2199
01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:19,280
Because he's awesome.

2200
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:21,280
Because my husband's a big dork.

2201
01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:22,280
Dan, you're awesome.

2202
01:46:22,280 --> 01:46:24,280
Dan's not even listening. He's watching Chair of Swords.

2203
01:46:24,280 --> 01:46:27,280
With the German chocolate cake and mystique.

2204
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:31,280
Well, we have pizza and Spike and Tim, so.

2205
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:32,280
Yeah.

2206
01:46:32,280 --> 01:46:33,280
Yeah.

2207
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:35,280
So, do do do do do you.

2208
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:41,280
And I challenge everyone to say that to a friend this week.

2209
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:43,280
Well, do do do do do do you.

2210
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:47,280
Anyway, anyway.

2211
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:52,280
Um, so yeah, you had, um, in the Sega Saturn version, you had unlockable cars.

2212
01:46:52,280 --> 01:47:02,280
You had, um, the redder blue and yellow and the black version depending on, uh, what transmission you picked in the arcade version and in the Saturn version.

2213
01:47:02,280 --> 01:47:09,280
Um, and, uh, basically, like I was saying, the, um, now the singer.

2214
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:17,280
And this is what I was talking about earlier about AM2, um, doing, uh, the game is that AM2 had their own sound division as well.

2215
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:21,280
And, uh, it was, uh, Takinobu Mitsuyoshi who was, uh, doing the singing.

2216
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:27,280
And the tracks are Let's Go Away and The King of Speed, which is the roaring start.

2217
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:31,280
Pounding Pavement, Let's Go Away, which is the attract mode.

2218
01:47:31,280 --> 01:47:36,280
Um, and, uh, Sky High, which is actually my favorite music in that game.

2219
01:47:36,280 --> 01:47:38,280
Because I want to fry Sky High.

2220
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:51,280
So, uh, in the arcade version also used, um, a Yamaha sound chip that, uh, completely just, uh, redid and, you know, made the music sound really good, really professional.

2221
01:47:51,280 --> 01:48:00,280
But they had to re-record it for the Saturn version because the, um, music was actually, uh, synthesized in-game with the vocals playing over it.

2222
01:48:00,280 --> 01:48:07,280
So, yeah, it's, uh, Daytona USA and I'm not doing it again.

2223
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:08,280
I'm done.

2224
01:48:08,280 --> 01:48:09,280
I will.

2225
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:10,280
Oh.

2226
01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:16,280
By the way, you can also play as the car in Fighters Megamix.

2227
01:48:16,280 --> 01:48:17,280
Awesome.

2228
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:21,280
There it is, your classic game of the week, Daytona.

2229
01:48:21,280 --> 01:48:23,280
Good pick.

2230
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:24,280
It's about time, honestly.

2231
01:48:24,280 --> 01:48:26,280
I have a recommendation for a classic game of the week.

2232
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:28,280
Super Mario Brothers 3.

2233
01:48:28,280 --> 01:48:30,280
I think she did it a long time ago.

2234
01:48:30,280 --> 01:48:31,280
I think I've done it.

2235
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:32,280
And World.

2236
01:48:32,280 --> 01:48:35,280
She's been doing this segment since episode 180-something, I think.

2237
01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:36,280
And we're on 502?

2238
01:48:36,280 --> 01:48:37,280
No, no.

2239
01:48:37,280 --> 01:48:38,280
200 and something, I think.

2240
01:48:38,280 --> 01:48:39,280
Something like that.

2241
01:48:39,280 --> 01:48:40,280
You've had several segments.

2242
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:41,280
It's changed a few times.

2243
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:43,280
Classic game of the week started around 200 and something.

2244
01:48:43,280 --> 01:48:47,280
But we stopped doing, uh, website of the week when I did, um, one site twice.

2245
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:48,280
Yeah.

2246
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:49,280
Because I couldn't really think of anything.

2247
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:50,280
What was the site?

2248
01:48:50,280 --> 01:48:53,280
You did one classic game twice and that didn't stop you.

2249
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:54,280
What did I do?

2250
01:48:54,280 --> 01:48:55,280
You did Final Fantasy VI twice.

2251
01:48:55,280 --> 01:48:57,280
But, I mean, if you're gonna do any game twice, like-

2252
01:48:57,280 --> 01:48:59,280
Okay, one was three, one was six.

2253
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:00,280
There, I did versions.

2254
01:49:00,280 --> 01:49:01,280
Don't judge me.

2255
01:49:01,280 --> 01:49:02,280
Fair enough.

2256
01:49:02,280 --> 01:49:05,280
I don't wanna do Sega Rally because it's very hard, easy left.

2257
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:06,280
Wait.

2258
01:49:06,280 --> 01:49:07,280
Maybe.

2259
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:08,280
All right, look.

2260
01:49:08,280 --> 01:49:09,280
Uh, long show.

2261
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:10,280
We've got, we gotta take a break.

2262
01:49:10,280 --> 01:49:11,280
We're gonna come back.

2263
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:12,280
We have rapid fire news.

2264
01:49:12,280 --> 01:49:14,280
Fugal Question of the Week coming as well.

2265
01:49:14,280 --> 01:49:15,280
Uh, some more news stories for you guys.

2266
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:20,280
And, as we promised, listless, what mascot are we gonna gift to Sega just out of the

2267
01:49:20,280 --> 01:49:21,280
goodness of our hearts?

2268
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:25,280
What do you, what do you, the listeners, want us to gift to Sega, uh, for their mascot competition?

2269
01:49:25,280 --> 01:49:31,280
Uh, we will beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep right back with more of Orange

2270
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:32,280
Lounge Radio right after this.

2271
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:46,280
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this, I almost said Friday

2272
01:49:46,280 --> 01:49:47,280
night.

2273
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:49,280
Aw, I wish the weekend was starting over.

2274
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:52,280
Sunday night, April the 28th of 2013.

2275
01:49:52,280 --> 01:49:59,280
And, uh, join in studio tonight with Captain Spike from the Game Buoy podcast at gamebuoy.org.

2276
01:49:59,280 --> 01:50:00,280
Ahoy.

2277
01:50:01,280 --> 01:50:02,280
Ahoy.

2278
01:50:02,280 --> 01:50:05,280
We were talking, we were talking about, you and I were, I won't spoil it on the show,

2279
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:08,280
but you and I were talking about some potential upcoming topics that you're gonna get into

2280
01:50:08,280 --> 01:50:10,280
on your show, and some, I was like, oh, that's real good.

2281
01:50:10,280 --> 01:50:11,280
That's real good.

2282
01:50:11,280 --> 01:50:15,280
So, if I try, if I don't steal them for OLR 503.

2283
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:16,280
Rude.

2284
01:50:16,280 --> 01:50:17,280
And ignorant.

2285
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:18,280
I would never, I would never.

2286
01:50:18,280 --> 01:50:22,280
Uh, also joining us tonight, Tim, who is on his very first podcast.

2287
01:50:22,280 --> 01:50:23,280
What up?

2288
01:50:23,280 --> 01:50:24,280
Are you having a good time?

2289
01:50:24,280 --> 01:50:25,280
Is it more fun than you thought it would?

2290
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:26,280
It's less terrifying than I imagined.

2291
01:50:26,280 --> 01:50:27,280
Yeah?

2292
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:28,280
Yeah.

2293
01:50:28,280 --> 01:50:32,280
It looks like it's in, like, literally, literally the corner of my apartment.

2294
01:50:32,280 --> 01:50:36,280
And not, like, a studio with lights everywhere.

2295
01:50:36,280 --> 01:50:40,280
Like, people think that, like, this show, because it's so damn old, people think that

2296
01:50:40,280 --> 01:50:42,280
we have, like, this recording space.

2297
01:50:42,280 --> 01:50:46,280
Or maybe because there's certain other podcasters out there that put out that perception that

2298
01:50:46,280 --> 01:50:49,280
you need $35,000 to do a gaming podcast.

2299
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:50,280
No tea, no shade.

2300
01:50:50,280 --> 01:50:53,280
All tea, all tea.

2301
01:50:53,280 --> 01:50:57,280
That we have all this expensive equipment, but we don't really have any of that.

2302
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:59,280
No, it's, it's pretty, pretty chill.

2303
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:02,280
I slept on the floor not four feet from here last night.

2304
01:51:02,280 --> 01:51:06,280
You can, you can literally say you slept with Orange Lounge Radio.

2305
01:51:06,280 --> 01:51:08,280
I'm not going to tell anyone.

2306
01:51:08,280 --> 01:51:09,280
Please, please don't spread that rumor.

2307
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:14,280
I do have to say that when we buy a house, we're definitely looking for a place that

2308
01:51:14,280 --> 01:51:15,280
has room for O.L.R.

2309
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:18,280
Actually, we're looking at, Alan and I are looking at moving ourselves.

2310
01:51:18,280 --> 01:51:20,280
Oh my God, let's all get a big house.

2311
01:51:20,280 --> 01:51:23,280
Oh my God, I'd kill you all.

2312
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:24,280
No.

2313
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:27,280
I wasn't talking, I said my Rob.

2314
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:28,280
Been there, done that.

2315
01:51:28,280 --> 01:51:29,280
I lived with Loki before.

2316
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:30,280
Been there, done that.

2317
01:51:30,280 --> 01:51:31,280
That's actually.

2318
01:51:31,280 --> 01:51:33,280
You have seen me drunk in my pajamas.

2319
01:51:33,280 --> 01:51:35,280
With all due respect, Loki was a great roommate.

2320
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:36,280
I want to make that clear.

2321
01:51:36,280 --> 01:51:39,280
The only reason, you know, he got married and blah, blah, blah.

2322
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:41,280
And I have a kid, so that would be a little weird.

2323
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:43,280
That would be a challenge, would be a challenge.

2324
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:44,280
All right.

2325
01:51:44,280 --> 01:51:47,280
By the way, Josh looked totally cute in that last picture.

2326
01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:48,280
I just have to say.

2327
01:51:48,280 --> 01:51:51,280
Actually, yeah, Nellie's been posting a lot of pictures of Josh late and I got to say

2328
01:51:51,280 --> 01:51:52,280
cute, cute kid.

2329
01:51:52,280 --> 01:51:56,280
I mean, not that I didn't think so before, but just that I'm being reminded consistently

2330
01:51:56,280 --> 01:51:57,280
on Facebook this week.

2331
01:51:57,280 --> 01:51:58,280
Cute, cute kid.

2332
01:51:58,280 --> 01:52:00,280
For the record, I have to say this.

2333
01:52:00,280 --> 01:52:04,280
I gave Julian the Nerf shield and dagger for his birthday.

2334
01:52:04,280 --> 01:52:09,280
He had the most maniacal grin on his face and wanted to immediately sword fight.

2335
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:15,280
Looking at comments from our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, SSJ100Matt says,

2336
01:52:15,280 --> 01:52:18,280
the OLR beach house.

2337
01:52:18,280 --> 01:52:25,280
That's like the summer spinoff where the Saved by the Bell kids all worked at the beach retreat or whatever.

2338
01:52:25,280 --> 01:52:28,280
Don't you dare use Jersey Shore and OLR in the same sentence.

2339
01:52:28,280 --> 01:52:30,280
I will cut a bitch.

2340
01:52:30,280 --> 01:52:32,280
Dark Tetsuya says, move into the fort.

2341
01:52:32,280 --> 01:52:34,280
Yes, we talked about that some time ago.

2342
01:52:34,280 --> 01:52:38,280
Code Man says, OLR real world.

2343
01:52:38,280 --> 01:52:40,280
There would definitely be some drama.

2344
01:52:40,280 --> 01:52:41,280
Start getting real.

2345
01:52:41,280 --> 01:52:45,280
If Jamie and I lived in the same house, like 24-7, there would definitely be some drama.

2346
01:52:46,280 --> 01:52:47,280
I like that.

2347
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:50,280
Fifth Dream says, OLR celebrity rehab.

2348
01:52:50,280 --> 01:52:51,280
Wait, what's that tip?

2349
01:52:51,280 --> 01:52:54,280
Fifth Dream says, OLR celebrity rehab.

2350
01:52:54,280 --> 01:52:56,280
Rehab from tacos, maybe.

2351
01:52:56,280 --> 01:52:57,280
You know what?

2352
01:52:57,280 --> 01:52:58,280
I don't do drugs already.

2353
01:52:58,280 --> 01:53:00,280
Rob Roberts, My Strange Addiction.

2354
01:53:00,280 --> 01:53:02,280
Every Tuesday would be Taco Tuesday.

2355
01:53:02,280 --> 01:53:05,280
We'd have the live cast from Felipe's on Tuesday.

2356
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:07,280
Your guys' cycle would line up.

2357
01:53:08,280 --> 01:53:10,280
Fuck off.

2358
01:53:11,280 --> 01:53:12,280
Hearts.

2359
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:19,280
Let's move to rapid fire news while I stare at Captain Spike with my death eyes.

2360
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:21,280
I'm so precious.

2361
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:24,280
I think maybe we already did sync up.

2362
01:53:24,280 --> 01:53:25,280
Alright.

2363
01:53:25,280 --> 01:53:30,280
You may remember an independent game that kind of ripped off of Super Mario Brothers.

2364
01:53:30,280 --> 01:53:34,280
Super Mario Brothers Crossover is a fun game where you get to play all the Super Mario Brothers levels.

2365
01:53:35,280 --> 01:53:44,280
But you get to play them as not only Super Mario or Luigi or Zelda or Simon Belmont and that kind of stuff.

2366
01:53:44,280 --> 01:53:47,280
So now they have 3.0 because it's celebrating 3 years.

2367
01:53:47,280 --> 01:53:50,280
And they've got a pretty interesting...

2368
01:53:50,280 --> 01:53:56,280
I didn't know that this game existed, but apparently there's a game called Super Mario Brothers Special.

2369
01:53:56,280 --> 01:54:00,280
It's a crossover between Super Mario Brothers and Donkey Kong.

2370
01:54:00,280 --> 01:54:02,280
Donkey Kong power-ups and stuff like that.

2371
01:54:02,280 --> 01:54:04,280
And barrels and all sorts of cool stuff.

2372
01:54:04,280 --> 01:54:06,280
So that's the newest update.

2373
01:54:06,280 --> 01:54:08,280
It's going to be levels out of that game.

2374
01:54:08,280 --> 01:54:11,280
And they have a whole bunch of other game types.

2375
01:54:11,280 --> 01:54:16,280
Because one of the things that the game does is it changes the way it looks.

2376
01:54:16,280 --> 01:54:21,280
And so you can be playing with all the different characters from Castlevania and stuff.

2377
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:24,280
It just changes the whole sprite set and the sound effects and stuff.

2378
01:54:24,280 --> 01:54:26,280
It's really interesting.

2379
01:54:26,280 --> 01:54:28,280
But if you want to check it out...

2380
01:54:28,280 --> 01:54:33,280
It looks like explodingrabbit.com is where you're going to be able to find that game, of course.

2381
01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:37,280
I don't know when the 3.0 update is coming soon, though.

2382
01:54:37,280 --> 01:54:39,280
But they have a trailer for it.

2383
01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:41,280
How are they pushing that?

2384
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:45,280
I gave them money on their Kickstarter for Super Retro Squad.

2385
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:47,280
It's still coming in March.

2386
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:50,280
Yeah. Well, no Kickstarters ever on time.

2387
01:54:50,280 --> 01:54:52,280
But yeah, there's...

2388
01:54:52,280 --> 01:54:53,280
How's your Ouya?

2389
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:54,280
Did you get your Ouya?

2390
01:54:54,280 --> 01:54:57,280
My Ouya right now is chilling in...

2391
01:54:57,280 --> 01:55:01,280
Where was it? It's in the Bay Area right now.

2392
01:55:01,280 --> 01:55:03,280
Just outside of Fremont.

2393
01:55:03,280 --> 01:55:04,280
Daily City?

2394
01:55:04,280 --> 01:55:06,280
Fucking Fremont!

2395
01:55:06,280 --> 01:55:07,280
No, seriously!

2396
01:55:07,280 --> 01:55:09,280
It's in my living room, by the way.

2397
01:55:09,280 --> 01:55:12,280
Seriously. Fucking Fremont. You know why?

2398
01:55:12,280 --> 01:55:14,280
Not even Fremont. Fremont's out of this.

2399
01:55:14,280 --> 01:55:16,280
It's a close bystander.

2400
01:55:16,280 --> 01:55:18,280
No, seriously. Fucking Daily City or whatever.

2401
01:55:18,280 --> 01:55:19,280
It's at the Cow Palace.

2402
01:55:19,280 --> 01:55:21,280
Whatever it is.

2403
01:55:21,280 --> 01:55:23,280
Oh, that's right where Alan used to live.

2404
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:25,280
It's been sitting there since Thursday.

2405
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:27,280
Not moving. At all.

2406
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:29,280
I like the traffic.

2407
01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:32,280
Yes. But you see, it's like it went...

2408
01:55:32,280 --> 01:55:34,280
It keeps getting worse.

2409
01:55:34,280 --> 01:55:36,280
First off, it took forever for them to ship it.

2410
01:55:36,280 --> 01:55:38,280
They shipped it by boat.

2411
01:55:38,280 --> 01:55:41,280
Look, we could do a three hour show of you bitching about your Ouya.

2412
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:43,280
No, no, no. Hold on.

2413
01:55:43,280 --> 01:55:45,280
I'm with him on this one. They haven't shipped mine out yet either.

2414
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:47,280
No, no. Listen. Here's how it's going.

2415
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:49,280
So they shipped it by boat.

2416
01:55:49,280 --> 01:55:51,280
First off, they picked DHL.

2417
01:55:51,280 --> 01:55:53,280
DHL. The quality shipper.

2418
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:55,280
The only worse shipper in the world would be Old Dominion.

2419
01:55:55,280 --> 01:55:57,280
For the record,

2420
01:55:57,280 --> 01:55:59,280
Dan was playing a racing game and there were DHL stickers

2421
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:01,280
and I totally thought of you.

2422
01:56:01,280 --> 01:56:03,280
Well, it better not be a DHL car

2423
01:56:03,280 --> 01:56:05,280
because that car would be moving fucking slow.

2424
01:56:05,280 --> 01:56:07,280
This is a damn heated Loki.

2425
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:09,280
So they shipped it DHL.

2426
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:11,280
DHL and then the strategic

2427
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:13,280
mailing thing, they passed

2428
01:56:13,280 --> 01:56:15,280
it off to the United States Postal Service.

2429
01:56:15,280 --> 01:56:17,280
Which, from my experience

2430
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:19,280
shipping eBay stuff,

2431
01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:21,280
they always scan those packages

2432
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:23,280
and they totally never

2433
01:56:23,280 --> 01:56:25,280
just go weeks

2434
01:56:25,280 --> 01:56:27,280
at a time without, hey,

2435
01:56:27,280 --> 01:56:29,280
here's where your package is.

2436
01:56:29,280 --> 01:56:31,280
I'm expecting my package hopefully on Monday.

2437
01:56:31,280 --> 01:56:33,280
Otherwise, I don't know where it is.

2438
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:35,280
Because it shouldn't take

2439
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:37,280
a whole weekend

2440
01:56:37,280 --> 01:56:39,280
from Thursday

2441
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:41,280
to go two hours

2442
01:56:41,280 --> 01:56:43,280
in distance.

2443
01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:45,280
Are you done?

2444
01:56:45,280 --> 01:56:47,280
I'm done.

2445
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:49,280
So, there was a new game coming

2446
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:51,280
from Take-Two.

2447
01:56:51,280 --> 01:56:53,280
XCOM, or at least

2448
01:56:53,280 --> 01:56:55,280
The Bureau, XCOM

2449
01:56:55,280 --> 01:56:57,280
Declassified. It was that first person

2450
01:56:57,280 --> 01:56:59,280
XCOM game that no one wanted

2451
01:56:59,280 --> 01:57:01,280
and now it's a third person XCOM game

2452
01:57:01,280 --> 01:57:03,280
that some people might want.

2453
01:57:03,280 --> 01:57:05,280
And it's a squad based shooter.

2454
01:57:05,280 --> 01:57:07,280
So, yeah.

2455
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:09,280
It's supposed to be like a prequel to the whole XCOM series

2456
01:57:09,280 --> 01:57:11,280
to figure out how the XCOM

2457
01:57:11,280 --> 01:57:13,280
Bureau, I guess,

2458
01:57:13,280 --> 01:57:15,280
was created or something. I don't know.

2459
01:57:15,280 --> 01:57:17,280
And last but not least,

2460
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:19,280
the Indoroyale Lunar Bundle

2461
01:57:19,280 --> 01:57:21,280
as we were talking about earlier,

2462
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:23,280
purchasing. Pretty great deal

2463
01:57:23,280 --> 01:57:25,280
if you pay

2464
01:57:25,280 --> 01:57:27,280
what you want.

2465
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:29,280
$6 gets you the game.

2466
01:57:29,280 --> 01:57:31,280
$8 gets you some additional stuff

2467
01:57:31,280 --> 01:57:33,280
including the Reawakening

2468
01:57:33,280 --> 01:57:35,280
album, which is from

2469
01:57:35,280 --> 01:57:37,280
some Commodore 64 and Amiga chiptune

2470
01:57:37,280 --> 01:57:39,280
artist TJK. And then also

2471
01:57:39,280 --> 01:57:41,280
in this bundle you get some

2472
01:57:41,280 --> 01:57:43,280
cool stuff including Back to the Future.

2473
01:57:43,280 --> 01:57:45,280
You know, the whole Telltale game.

2474
01:57:45,280 --> 01:57:47,280
Nice. And Dungeon Hearts

2475
01:57:47,280 --> 01:57:49,280
Carve Commander and

2476
01:57:49,280 --> 01:57:51,280
let's see

2477
01:57:51,280 --> 01:57:53,280
what else.

2478
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:55,280
P.I.D. was the other game.

2479
01:57:55,280 --> 01:57:57,280
So, I bought it. It's pretty awesome.

2480
01:57:57,280 --> 01:57:59,280
So, check it out.

2481
01:57:59,280 --> 01:58:01,280
Alrighty.

2482
01:58:01,280 --> 01:58:03,280
Let's move on and talk about the Wii U virtual

2483
01:58:03,280 --> 01:58:05,280
console. We've kind of referenced this already

2484
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:07,280
in the show. If you didn't know, that Wii U

2485
01:58:07,280 --> 01:58:09,280
update is out. Yes, it does make a lot

2486
01:58:09,280 --> 01:58:11,280
of stuff on the console faster. So, you know,

2487
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:13,280
here's a reason to turn on your Wii U

2488
01:58:13,280 --> 01:58:15,280
if you beat Zombie U

2489
01:58:15,280 --> 01:58:17,280
and Mario U a couple months ago and you really

2490
01:58:17,280 --> 01:58:19,280
haven't had a reason.

2491
01:58:19,280 --> 01:58:21,280
Fire it up, download the update, and you can

2492
01:58:21,280 --> 01:58:23,280
check out some of these virtual console games. Balloon Fight,

2493
01:58:23,280 --> 01:58:25,280
Donkey Kong Jr.,

2494
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:27,280
Excitebike, Kirby's Adventure, Punch Out,

2495
01:58:27,280 --> 01:58:29,280
F-Zero, Super Mario World, and

2496
01:58:29,280 --> 01:58:31,280
of course, Ice Climbers.

2497
01:58:31,280 --> 01:58:33,280
All available on virtual console.

2498
01:58:33,280 --> 01:58:35,280
And, yeah,

2499
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:37,280
even though I said

2500
01:58:37,280 --> 01:58:39,280
when we first announced

2501
01:58:39,280 --> 01:58:41,280
the virtual console on Wii U, I wasn't gonna do this.

2502
01:58:41,280 --> 01:58:43,280
I did it. I paid the $1.50

2503
01:58:43,280 --> 01:58:45,280
to upgrade my copy of Super Mario World.

2504
01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:47,280
I gotta say, it runs really nice.

2505
01:58:47,280 --> 01:58:49,280
Like, I really prefer it on Wii U to the Wii.

2506
01:58:49,280 --> 01:58:51,280
I didn't think it would be that big of a difference.

2507
01:58:51,280 --> 01:58:53,280
And, like, how could a 20-year-old game

2508
01:58:53,280 --> 01:58:55,280
be that different? But I'm telling you, with the

2509
01:58:55,280 --> 01:58:57,280
HDMI, without me having to consistently

2510
01:58:57,280 --> 01:58:59,280
change the proportions on the television,

2511
01:58:59,280 --> 01:59:01,280
with the audio coming out of

2512
01:59:01,280 --> 01:59:03,280
the Wii U pad as well as the TV,

2513
01:59:03,280 --> 01:59:05,280
it works great. So,

2514
01:59:05,280 --> 01:59:07,280
you know, alright. I was wrong

2515
01:59:07,280 --> 01:59:09,280
when I first judged virtual console a few months ago.

2516
01:59:09,280 --> 01:59:11,280
Fine. Alright.

2517
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:13,280
Speaking of things that are available on

2518
01:59:13,280 --> 01:59:15,280
Nintendo platforms and PC and so forth,

2519
01:59:15,280 --> 01:59:17,280
Scribblenauts. There's a new Scribblenauts

2520
01:59:17,280 --> 01:59:19,280
and supposedly it's titled

2521
01:59:19,280 --> 01:59:21,280
Scribblenauts Unmasked, although that's not an

2522
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:23,280
official revelation. That's something that's

2523
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:25,280
floating out there. Apparently, it's supposed

2524
01:59:25,280 --> 01:59:27,280
to be some type of crossover with DC

2525
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:29,280
Comics, hence the name Unmasked.

2526
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:31,280
Oh, I'm sure Dark Soccer is all about this.

2527
01:59:31,280 --> 01:59:33,280
I'm not gonna play it.

2528
01:59:33,280 --> 01:59:35,280
Characters like Batman, places like the Batcave

2529
01:59:35,280 --> 01:59:37,280
supposed to be out on PC,

2530
01:59:37,280 --> 01:59:39,280
Wii U, and 3DS, so it's

2531
01:59:39,280 --> 01:59:41,280
definitely a Nintendo and a PC thing.

2532
01:59:41,280 --> 01:59:43,280
I remember the last

2533
01:59:43,280 --> 01:59:45,280
Scribblenauts game was one of the launch titles for Wii U,

2534
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:47,280
so this would make an interesting fit.

2535
01:59:47,280 --> 01:59:49,280
It would be a very interesting step

2536
01:59:49,280 --> 01:59:51,280
for the series, but seeing as Scribblenauts

2537
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:53,280
is part of WB Games, it does

2538
01:59:53,280 --> 01:59:55,280
make sense. So,

2539
01:59:55,280 --> 01:59:57,280
curiosity piqued. We'll say that.

2540
01:59:57,280 --> 01:59:59,280
Also, this

2541
01:59:59,280 --> 02:00:01,280
rumor's going around. I don't

2542
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:03,280
know how much weight I give this. It could certainly

2543
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:05,280
be a game changer, but the rumor is that Take-Two

2544
02:00:05,280 --> 02:00:07,280
is supposed to announce Grand Theft Auto

2545
02:00:07,280 --> 02:00:09,280
5 for next generation consoles next

2546
02:00:09,280 --> 02:00:11,280
month. Now, did this originate

2547
02:00:11,280 --> 02:00:13,280
with an analyst, that

2548
02:00:13,280 --> 02:00:15,280
infamous games analyst that always says

2549
02:00:15,280 --> 02:00:17,280
because if so, then this holds absolutely

2550
02:00:17,280 --> 02:00:19,280
no weight. It's not coming out next gen.

2551
02:00:19,280 --> 02:00:21,280
It's not, and here's why. It's because

2552
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:23,280
they're gonna do a PC. They will do a PC

2553
02:00:23,280 --> 02:00:25,280
version later on, just like they did with 4,

2554
02:00:25,280 --> 02:00:27,280
and they're gonna do that probably with the next

2555
02:00:27,280 --> 02:00:29,280
gen consoles at the same time. Here's my other

2556
02:00:29,280 --> 02:00:31,280
problem with this article. They say the announcement

2557
02:00:31,280 --> 02:00:33,280
is supposed to be coming during an upcoming

2558
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:35,280
investor event on May 16th.

2559
02:00:35,280 --> 02:00:37,280
They don't make announcements. They don't do that

2560
02:00:37,280 --> 02:00:39,280
at investor events. Investor events are

2561
02:00:39,280 --> 02:00:41,280
not the place to pull back the curtain and say

2562
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:43,280
the investor event is to talk about

2563
02:00:43,280 --> 02:00:45,280
here's what's happened in the

2564
02:00:45,280 --> 02:00:47,280
past, here's where we are currently, here's

2565
02:00:47,280 --> 02:00:49,280
our plan for the future in broad

2566
02:00:49,280 --> 02:00:51,280
terms, not in these types of specifics.

2567
02:00:51,280 --> 02:00:53,280
That's the big problem I have

2568
02:00:53,280 --> 02:00:55,280
with this that's going around right now. I don't think

2569
02:00:55,280 --> 02:00:57,280
that, and here's the other thing too, is they're not going to

2570
02:00:57,280 --> 02:00:59,280
spend the additional time to make a

2571
02:00:59,280 --> 02:01:01,280
next gen version of the game when they have a current

2572
02:01:01,280 --> 02:01:03,280
gen version of the game that people will buy anyways.

2573
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:05,280
Unless, unless someone

2574
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:07,280
paid them big money to make it

2575
02:01:07,280 --> 02:01:09,280
an exclusive to their console. I still

2576
02:01:09,280 --> 02:01:11,280
don't think they would do that because even if they

2577
02:01:11,280 --> 02:01:13,280
still do, even if they brought out

2578
02:01:13,280 --> 02:01:15,280
the game, they're gonna do a PC version at the same

2579
02:01:15,280 --> 02:01:17,280
time because why bother? If you're gonna

2580
02:01:17,280 --> 02:01:19,280
develop a higher res version of the game, you might as

2581
02:01:19,280 --> 02:01:21,280
well make a PC version as well so that you can put it out

2582
02:01:21,280 --> 02:01:23,280
in PCs. Unless someone

2583
02:01:23,280 --> 02:01:25,280
bought it off. That's always

2584
02:01:25,280 --> 02:01:27,280
a possibility on the table. Someone bought

2585
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:29,280
it off. It's always on the table.

2586
02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:31,280
Well if that were the case then it would be coming out exclusive

2587
02:01:31,280 --> 02:01:33,280
you know like for one system like the Xbox

2588
02:01:33,280 --> 02:01:35,280
360 was for a while and

2589
02:01:35,280 --> 02:01:37,280
the PS3 version came out and PC.

2590
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:39,280
But I just, I don't see

2591
02:01:39,280 --> 02:01:41,280
that happening. Did they date Grand Theft Auto 5?

2592
02:01:41,280 --> 02:01:43,280
Did they date it? It's September

2593
02:01:43,280 --> 02:01:45,280
17th. Well then yeah I guess we are too

2594
02:01:45,280 --> 02:01:47,280
far along for them to change that at this point.

2595
02:01:47,280 --> 02:01:49,280
I was gonna say there's no reason they can't

2596
02:01:49,280 --> 02:01:51,280
yank it and say, delay the first quarter

2597
02:01:51,280 --> 02:01:53,280
in this version. Oh I'm gonna fucking kill somebody if

2598
02:01:53,280 --> 02:01:55,280
that happens. I will cut a bitch.

2599
02:01:55,280 --> 02:01:57,280
I don't know if you should say that on a radio show.

2600
02:01:57,280 --> 02:01:59,280
No I will fucking

2601
02:01:59,280 --> 02:02:01,280
kill somebody.

2602
02:02:01,280 --> 02:02:03,280
Virtually people.

2603
02:02:03,280 --> 02:02:05,280
Allegedly. It's Grand Theft Auto of course

2604
02:02:05,280 --> 02:02:07,280
you will kill somebody digitally.

2605
02:02:07,280 --> 02:02:09,280
He'll kill a hooker. No I think

2606
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:11,280
I will have to

2607
02:02:11,280 --> 02:02:13,280
I will have to kill somebody. Don't say that

2608
02:02:13,280 --> 02:02:15,280
in this world Loki you don't

2609
02:02:15,280 --> 02:02:17,280
say that. They already deleted how many times

2610
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:19,280
I can't wait any longer. Just get ready.

2611
02:02:19,280 --> 02:02:21,280
I can't wait any longer. Get ready to sharpen the purple

2612
02:02:21,280 --> 02:02:23,280
dildo. Wait wrong game.

2613
02:02:23,280 --> 02:02:25,280
I can't wait any longer. It's been

2614
02:02:25,280 --> 02:02:27,280
so long. I need my Grand Theft Auto.

2615
02:02:27,280 --> 02:02:29,280
You need a therapist.

2616
02:02:29,280 --> 02:02:31,280
I need Grand Theft Auto.

2617
02:02:31,280 --> 02:02:33,280
Alright Dark Sakura.

2618
02:02:33,280 --> 02:02:35,280
Alright I gotta

2619
02:02:35,280 --> 02:02:37,280
get my story up. Okay.

2620
02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:39,280
Sorry my throat's a little

2621
02:02:39,280 --> 02:02:41,280
alley right now. Okay well

2622
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:43,280
we have some download content for

2623
02:02:43,280 --> 02:02:45,280
Revengeance. We have Blade Wolf and it's

2624
02:02:45,280 --> 02:02:47,280
going to be out in May in Japan

2625
02:02:47,280 --> 02:02:49,280
on the 9th of May. We don't

2626
02:02:49,280 --> 02:02:51,280
have a western date yet but

2627
02:02:51,280 --> 02:02:53,280
I would assume that it would have to be somewhere

2628
02:02:53,280 --> 02:02:55,280
near there and it's going to be a thousand

2629
02:02:55,280 --> 02:02:57,280
yen. So

2630
02:02:57,280 --> 02:02:59,280
we're looking at maybe a

2631
02:02:59,280 --> 02:03:01,280
ten dollar DLC

2632
02:03:01,280 --> 02:03:03,280
when we get it.

2633
02:03:03,280 --> 02:03:05,280
In other news.

2634
02:03:05,280 --> 02:03:07,280
Close window. Thank you. There is

2635
02:03:07,280 --> 02:03:09,280
going to be a sequel to River City

2636
02:03:09,280 --> 02:03:11,280
Ransom and

2637
02:03:11,280 --> 02:03:13,280
there is a crowd funding

2638
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:15,280
thing open for it.

2639
02:03:15,280 --> 02:03:17,280
They want to make it an official

2640
02:03:17,280 --> 02:03:19,280
River City Ransom.

2641
02:03:19,280 --> 02:03:21,280
They're working with the River City Ransom

2642
02:03:21,280 --> 02:03:23,280
EX developer Million to do

2643
02:03:23,280 --> 02:03:25,280
the actual sequel.

2644
02:03:25,280 --> 02:03:27,280
They're hoping it's going to be

2645
02:03:27,280 --> 02:03:29,280
August 2014.

2646
02:03:29,280 --> 02:03:31,280
They've got a placeholder website out

2647
02:03:31,280 --> 02:03:33,280
for this right now. Just to throw a little background

2648
02:03:33,280 --> 02:03:35,280
into this. I think the reason why they say

2649
02:03:35,280 --> 02:03:37,280
actual sequel is because something is coming on 3DS

2650
02:03:37,280 --> 02:03:39,280
I think but it's not

2651
02:03:39,280 --> 02:03:41,280
the same people. So you kind of

2652
02:03:41,280 --> 02:03:43,280
have the two groups

2653
02:03:43,280 --> 02:03:45,280
now. The ones on Kickstarter.

2654
02:03:45,280 --> 02:03:47,280
Are they doing another Nekketsu

2655
02:03:47,280 --> 02:03:49,280
game on 3DS?

2656
02:03:49,280 --> 02:03:51,280
I think so. Yeah.

2657
02:03:51,280 --> 02:03:53,280
One of the actual Kunio games?

2658
02:03:53,280 --> 02:03:55,280
Yes. Honestly that will be far superior.

2659
02:03:55,280 --> 02:03:57,280
Yup.

2660
02:03:57,280 --> 02:03:59,280
Actually.

2661
02:03:59,280 --> 02:04:01,280
The shade. The shade of it all.

2662
02:04:01,280 --> 02:04:03,280
You know what? It's just true.

2663
02:04:03,280 --> 02:04:05,280
Because you cannot

2664
02:04:05,280 --> 02:04:07,280
like ok super

2665
02:04:07,280 --> 02:04:09,280
you played dodgeball and super dodgeball right?

2666
02:04:09,280 --> 02:04:11,280
They're actual Kunio games. You've played

2667
02:04:11,280 --> 02:04:13,280
knock off dodgeball games right? Were they as good?

2668
02:04:13,280 --> 02:04:15,280
No. Is anything going to

2669
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:17,280
top the original hot blooded

2670
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:19,280
downtown fight?

2671
02:04:19,280 --> 02:04:21,280
The Neo Geo one was great.

2672
02:04:21,280 --> 02:04:23,280
You know what the best version of that

2673
02:04:23,280 --> 02:04:25,280
was? PC Engine. Had voice acting.

2674
02:04:25,280 --> 02:04:27,280
Ok.

2675
02:04:27,280 --> 02:04:29,280
Did you ever play the PC Engine version? Yes.

2676
02:04:29,280 --> 02:04:31,280
Isn't that adorable? They're so cute.

2677
02:04:31,280 --> 02:04:33,280
Anyway. Like when you go

2678
02:04:33,280 --> 02:04:35,280
into the little restaurants they actually say

2679
02:04:35,280 --> 02:04:37,280
speak to you politely and

2680
02:04:37,280 --> 02:04:39,280
bow to you and everything. It's awesome.

2681
02:04:39,280 --> 02:04:41,280
Ok so TKX

2682
02:04:41,280 --> 02:04:43,280
is going to be a remake of

2683
02:04:43,280 --> 02:04:45,280
Tempest 2000. Yes. TXK.

2684
02:04:45,280 --> 02:04:47,280
Whatever. TXK.

2685
02:04:47,280 --> 02:04:49,280
You know what Rob? I'm so excited.

2686
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:51,280
I'm dyslexic. I have

2687
02:04:51,280 --> 02:04:53,280
excited on set dyslexia.

2688
02:04:53,280 --> 02:04:55,280
Thank you.

2689
02:04:55,280 --> 02:04:57,280
I'm quaking a little bit

2690
02:04:57,280 --> 02:04:59,280
right now. Shaking. Crying.

2691
02:04:59,280 --> 02:05:01,280
Maybe your

2692
02:05:01,280 --> 02:05:03,280
super zapper needs to recharge.

2693
02:05:03,280 --> 02:05:05,280
Super zapper recharge.

2694
02:05:05,280 --> 02:05:07,280
Ok for anyone who lives under a rock

2695
02:05:07,280 --> 02:05:09,280
or who has been living

2696
02:05:09,280 --> 02:05:11,280
under a rock or in a cave or under the sea

2697
02:05:11,280 --> 02:05:13,280
Tempest 2000 is probably one of the best

2698
02:05:13,280 --> 02:05:15,280
games in the universe. Even as

2699
02:05:15,280 --> 02:05:17,280
frustratingly difficult as

2700
02:05:17,280 --> 02:05:19,280
it can be. It's all because of the music. Because nothing

2701
02:05:19,280 --> 02:05:21,280
else matters. And it came out on the Jaguar

2702
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:23,280
which was the only good game on the Jaguar

2703
02:05:23,280 --> 02:05:25,280
next to what?

2704
02:05:25,280 --> 02:05:27,280
Alien vs. Predator? No that wasn't even

2705
02:05:27,280 --> 02:05:29,280
very good either. For the time.

2706
02:05:29,280 --> 02:05:31,280
Yeah. But it was still the best game

2707
02:05:31,280 --> 02:05:33,280
that ever came out on the Jaguar. Hands down.

2708
02:05:33,280 --> 02:05:35,280
Yeah. It was the only reason to

2709
02:05:35,280 --> 02:05:37,280
own a Jaguar. And then it came out on Saturn.

2710
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:39,280
And then I actually did play

2711
02:05:39,280 --> 02:05:41,280
the Jaguar version of Tempest 3000 that was

2712
02:05:41,280 --> 02:05:43,280
the proto. It was not bad.

2713
02:05:43,280 --> 02:05:45,280
So anyway. So yeah. This is basically

2714
02:05:45,280 --> 02:05:47,280
a remake of Tempest 2000.

2715
02:05:47,280 --> 02:05:49,280
And that's it.

2716
02:05:51,280 --> 02:05:53,280
I am all about this as well. K.X.T.

2717
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:55,280
K.X.T.

2718
02:05:55,280 --> 02:05:57,280
K.X.T.

2719
02:05:57,280 --> 02:05:59,280
Alright.

2720
02:05:59,280 --> 02:06:01,280
Let's take a chance

2721
02:06:01,280 --> 02:06:03,280
to go to the FUGL

2722
02:06:03,280 --> 02:06:05,280
question of the week.

2723
02:06:09,280 --> 02:06:11,280
Take

2724
02:06:11,280 --> 02:06:13,280
Facebook.

2725
02:06:13,280 --> 02:06:15,280
Take Google.

2726
02:06:15,280 --> 02:06:17,280
Slam them together and you get FUGL.

2727
02:06:17,280 --> 02:06:19,280
And we ask a question on our FUGL

2728
02:06:19,280 --> 02:06:21,280
Facebook and Google communities every week.

2729
02:06:21,280 --> 02:06:23,280
This week is about movies.

2730
02:06:23,280 --> 02:06:25,280
And I'm going to apologize in advance. I'm not going to have enough time

2731
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:27,280
to read all the answers because we're running along tonight.

2732
02:06:27,280 --> 02:06:29,280
We still have a list list. But

2733
02:06:29,280 --> 02:06:31,280
I want to encourage everybody to visit our communities.

2734
02:06:31,280 --> 02:06:33,280
Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio

2735
02:06:33,280 --> 02:06:35,280
and Google Plus to see all the answers

2736
02:06:35,280 --> 02:06:37,280
in full. There's some news

2737
02:06:37,280 --> 02:06:39,280
this week about Ratchet and Clank as well as

2738
02:06:39,280 --> 02:06:41,280
Heavenly Sword becoming a movie.

2739
02:06:41,280 --> 02:06:43,280
How do you feel about video game movies?

2740
02:06:43,280 --> 02:06:45,280
Most have a reputation for being pretty bad.

2741
02:06:45,280 --> 02:06:47,280
Do you think this helps or hurts gaming?

2742
02:06:47,280 --> 02:06:49,280
Should Hollywood be making more video game movies

2743
02:06:49,280 --> 02:06:51,280
or less?

2744
02:06:51,280 --> 02:06:53,280
Let's take a look at some of the answers

2745
02:06:53,280 --> 02:06:55,280
on Google Plus.

2746
02:06:55,280 --> 02:06:57,280
ActDeaf says

2747
02:06:57,280 --> 02:06:59,280
Video game movies as of recent have been

2748
02:06:59,280 --> 02:07:01,280
hit or miss for the masses.

2749
02:07:01,280 --> 02:07:03,280
But it will be a while for us to see a critically acclaimed

2750
02:07:03,280 --> 02:07:05,280
video game movie. I don't think it either

2751
02:07:05,280 --> 02:07:07,280
hurts that bad or helps that much for the industry.

2752
02:07:07,280 --> 02:07:09,280
Both ways, they're

2753
02:07:09,280 --> 02:07:11,280
just easy money makers for everyone

2754
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:13,280
involved mostly. But as of recent

2755
02:07:13,280 --> 02:07:15,280
Hollywood has seen how to make video game

2756
02:07:15,280 --> 02:07:17,280
movies work somewhat. So I'll keep an eye on that

2757
02:07:17,280 --> 02:07:19,280
Ratchet and Clank movie. Especially if it's animated

2758
02:07:19,280 --> 02:07:21,280
since that's the only way I can see that one working.

2759
02:07:21,280 --> 02:07:23,280
Flaco Jones

2760
02:07:23,280 --> 02:07:25,280
which by the way, I want to congratulate

2761
02:07:25,280 --> 02:07:27,280
Flaco Jones. He's now officially staffed

2762
02:07:27,280 --> 02:07:29,280
for VOG. His first movie

2763
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:31,280
review went up and he's got

2764
02:07:31,280 --> 02:07:33,280
another article that's posted during the week.

2765
02:07:33,280 --> 02:07:35,280
He's going to be doing a lot of the stuff from a film

2766
02:07:35,280 --> 02:07:37,280
perspective.

2767
02:07:37,280 --> 02:07:39,280
In the written form. So that'll be

2768
02:07:39,280 --> 02:07:41,280
great. So congrats Flaco.

2769
02:07:41,280 --> 02:07:43,280
And that's also going to be a very

2770
02:07:43,280 --> 02:07:45,280
interesting change for the game.

2771
02:07:45,280 --> 02:07:47,280
Because as you know, staff of VOG

2772
02:07:47,280 --> 02:07:49,280
don't go on the regular leaderboards.

2773
02:07:49,280 --> 02:07:51,280
So Flaco has been winning every month.

2774
02:07:51,280 --> 02:07:53,280
So, hmm

2775
02:07:53,280 --> 02:07:55,280
now things are going to get interesting.

2776
02:07:55,280 --> 02:07:57,280
But anyhow, Flaco says as long as they bring something

2777
02:07:57,280 --> 02:07:59,280
unique to the table, I have no problem with more

2778
02:07:59,280 --> 02:08:01,280
video game movies. The issue arises

2779
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:03,280
when the video game property is already so similar

2780
02:08:03,280 --> 02:08:05,280
to a popular movie genre. Like what's

2781
02:08:05,280 --> 02:08:07,280
the difference between a Call of Duty film and just

2782
02:08:07,280 --> 02:08:09,280
some generic military action movie.

2783
02:08:09,280 --> 02:08:11,280
I don't know if the bad movies hurt the games.

2784
02:08:11,280 --> 02:08:13,280
It puts them into the public eye which at least means

2785
02:08:13,280 --> 02:08:15,280
more games I would think.

2786
02:08:15,280 --> 02:08:17,280
Entertainment lastly on Google Plus says

2787
02:08:17,280 --> 02:08:19,280
in an ideal situation you need a

2788
02:08:19,280 --> 02:08:21,280
writer, director, and producer

2789
02:08:21,280 --> 02:08:23,280
all having good track records

2790
02:08:23,280 --> 02:08:25,280
working together as a team.

2791
02:08:25,280 --> 02:08:27,280
That is why I'm looking forward to Tyler

2792
02:08:27,280 --> 02:08:29,280
Perry Presents Halo.

2793
02:08:29,280 --> 02:08:33,280
Love it.

2794
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:35,280
Let's do a few answers from

2795
02:08:35,280 --> 02:08:37,280
Facebook as well. Critical Myth

2796
02:08:37,280 --> 02:08:39,280
whose podcast talks a lot about movies

2797
02:08:39,280 --> 02:08:41,280
and TV shows and that stuff and he does

2798
02:08:41,280 --> 02:08:43,280
a lot of the book reviews for our site.

2799
02:08:43,280 --> 02:08:45,280
Critical Myth says I love the

2800
02:08:45,280 --> 02:08:47,280
R&C games but the last two

2801
02:08:47,280 --> 02:08:49,280
have been less than stellar so I'm actually

2802
02:08:49,280 --> 02:08:51,280
hopeful that this will give Insomniac a reason

2803
02:08:51,280 --> 02:08:53,280
to revitalize the franchise. But in general

2804
02:08:53,280 --> 02:08:55,280
terms I think it always comes down to the creative

2805
02:08:55,280 --> 02:08:57,280
minds behind the production. Do they understand

2806
02:08:57,280 --> 02:08:59,280
the IP and what a film adaptation

2807
02:08:59,280 --> 02:09:01,280
can bring to the table that the game itself does not?

2808
02:09:01,280 --> 02:09:03,280
And is the game suited to a film

2809
02:09:03,280 --> 02:09:05,280
style narrative?

2810
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:07,280
Pete Caruno says some game

2811
02:09:07,280 --> 02:09:09,280
franchises lend themselves very well

2812
02:09:09,280 --> 02:09:11,280
to film adaptations even though the execution

2813
02:09:11,280 --> 02:09:13,280
has pretty much always been awful.

2814
02:09:13,280 --> 02:09:15,280
Ratchet and Clank really doesn't strike me as the

2815
02:09:15,280 --> 02:09:17,280
kind of game that ought to have a film made of it

2816
02:09:17,280 --> 02:09:19,280
unless they're really that desperate for money?

2817
02:09:19,280 --> 02:09:21,280
And lastly on Facebook

2818
02:09:21,280 --> 02:09:23,280
Andy R. says as a Playstation fan

2819
02:09:23,280 --> 02:09:25,280
I was pretty happy about the news but I'm

2820
02:09:25,280 --> 02:09:27,280
concerned as well. Hollywood doesn't have

2821
02:09:27,280 --> 02:09:29,280
a great track record and I do think it hurts us

2822
02:09:29,280 --> 02:09:31,280
when they poorly adapt a game. I can see

2823
02:09:31,280 --> 02:09:33,280
a non-gamer saying this was based on a game

2824
02:09:33,280 --> 02:09:35,280
no wonder it was so bad

2825
02:09:35,280 --> 02:09:37,280
when we know that games can be a great medium

2826
02:09:37,280 --> 02:09:39,280
for storytelling. As for more or less

2827
02:09:39,280 --> 02:09:41,280
there are plenty of games I would love to see as

2828
02:09:41,280 --> 02:09:43,280
movies so I wouldn't mind more than

2829
02:09:43,280 --> 02:09:45,280
more once they figure out how to make them

2830
02:09:45,280 --> 02:09:47,280
without sucking. You know that's a very

2831
02:09:47,280 --> 02:09:49,280
interesting comment and I kind of

2832
02:09:49,280 --> 02:09:51,280
want to end on that and turn it over to the folks here

2833
02:09:51,280 --> 02:09:53,280
in studio is he theorizes

2834
02:09:53,280 --> 02:09:55,280
there that if the movie is

2835
02:09:55,280 --> 02:09:57,280
so bad it's going to make people go

2836
02:09:57,280 --> 02:09:59,280
well no wonder because it's a

2837
02:09:59,280 --> 02:10:01,280
game and the game probably sucks too.

2838
02:10:01,280 --> 02:10:03,280
So can the movies actually do harm

2839
02:10:03,280 --> 02:10:05,280
to video gaming when they're

2840
02:10:05,280 --> 02:10:07,280
really terrible?

2841
02:10:07,280 --> 02:10:09,280
I honestly think it also really depends

2842
02:10:09,280 --> 02:10:11,280
on the audience too because there's been a lot

2843
02:10:11,280 --> 02:10:13,280
of really good Japanese adaptations

2844
02:10:13,280 --> 02:10:15,280
that wouldn't fly over

2845
02:10:15,280 --> 02:10:17,280
here for the general audience because

2846
02:10:17,280 --> 02:10:19,280
of that quirkiness that's a part

2847
02:10:19,280 --> 02:10:21,280
of Japanese

2848
02:10:21,280 --> 02:10:23,280
game movie versions.

2849
02:10:23,280 --> 02:10:25,280
And people

2850
02:10:25,280 --> 02:10:27,280
here want either it to be

2851
02:10:27,280 --> 02:10:29,280
super cutesy or super

2852
02:10:29,280 --> 02:10:31,280
gritty, realistic, have an edge to it

2853
02:10:31,280 --> 02:10:33,280
and I don't really see it.

2854
02:10:33,280 --> 02:10:35,280
It would really depend on the IP.

2855
02:10:37,280 --> 02:10:39,280
I don't know which came first the Alone in the Dark

2856
02:10:39,280 --> 02:10:41,280
movie or the

2857
02:10:41,280 --> 02:10:43,280
Alone in the Dark game

2858
02:10:43,280 --> 02:10:45,280
by Atari. Like the last

2859
02:10:45,280 --> 02:10:47,280
one. Because I

2860
02:10:47,280 --> 02:10:49,280
don't remember which one hurt what.

2861
02:10:49,280 --> 02:10:51,280
I'm sure Tara Reid being a scientist didn't help.

2862
02:10:51,280 --> 02:10:53,280
Oh stop.

2863
02:10:53,280 --> 02:10:55,280
Spike, how do you feel about video game movies?

2864
02:10:55,280 --> 02:10:57,280
Well you know

2865
02:10:57,280 --> 02:10:59,280
I think that they're largely

2866
02:10:59,280 --> 02:11:01,280
mediocre at best.

2867
02:11:01,280 --> 02:11:03,280
I think it's kind of telling when you have

2868
02:11:03,280 --> 02:11:05,280
recent movie games like Prince of

2869
02:11:05,280 --> 02:11:07,280
Persia and the general perception

2870
02:11:07,280 --> 02:11:09,280
is still oh game movies are getting

2871
02:11:09,280 --> 02:11:11,280
better.

2872
02:11:11,280 --> 02:11:13,280
So they're mostly crap but I

2873
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:15,280
don't think they hurt.

2874
02:11:15,280 --> 02:11:17,280
Again, Street Fighter is still a franchise

2875
02:11:17,280 --> 02:11:19,280
that exists and that movie was awful.

2876
02:11:19,280 --> 02:11:21,280
See also Super Mario Brothers with

2877
02:11:21,280 --> 02:11:23,280
Bob Hoskins. Hey, hey.

2878
02:11:23,280 --> 02:11:25,280
Kylie was in it. No

2879
02:11:25,280 --> 02:11:27,280
it was in Street Fighter yes.

2880
02:11:27,280 --> 02:11:29,280
Sorry I thought you meant the Mario movie.

2881
02:11:29,280 --> 02:11:31,280
The cast in that Street Fighter movie was actually super

2882
02:11:31,280 --> 02:11:33,280
good. But I feel so bad

2883
02:11:33,280 --> 02:11:35,280
for dearly departed Raul Julia

2884
02:11:35,280 --> 02:11:37,280
for that being his last movie.

2885
02:11:37,280 --> 02:11:39,280
Although I have seen him in some really crappy

2886
02:11:39,280 --> 02:11:41,280
movies. And you guys even forgot that there was another

2887
02:11:41,280 --> 02:11:43,280
Street Fighter movie. Yeah there was the

2888
02:11:43,280 --> 02:11:45,280
Chun-Li, that horrible Chun-Li thing.

2889
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:47,280
Didn't Bison

2890
02:11:47,280 --> 02:11:49,280
cause harm with

2891
02:11:49,280 --> 02:11:51,280
psychic powers to a woman in a way

2892
02:11:51,280 --> 02:11:53,280
that I don't really feel appropriate describing?

2893
02:11:53,280 --> 02:11:55,280
Well you know what I didn't see it and

2894
02:11:55,280 --> 02:11:57,280
I don't really want to.

2895
02:11:57,280 --> 02:11:59,280
I was really drunk but I feel like I was offended

2896
02:11:59,280 --> 02:12:01,280
and that takes a lot.

2897
02:12:01,280 --> 02:12:03,280
I'm going to stick with the

2898
02:12:03,280 --> 02:12:05,280
ties that bind the best Street Fighter thing that came

2899
02:12:05,280 --> 02:12:07,280
out. That's the only thing in my universe.

2900
02:12:07,280 --> 02:12:09,280
The thing that came out with Street Fighter 4.

2901
02:12:09,280 --> 02:12:11,280
Yeah that was really good.

2902
02:12:11,280 --> 02:12:13,280
So Tim what do you think? If they end up

2903
02:12:13,280 --> 02:12:15,280
doing this new Mass Effect movie do you think

2904
02:12:15,280 --> 02:12:17,280
it's going to do justice to the games?

2905
02:12:17,280 --> 02:12:19,280
I don't

2906
02:12:19,280 --> 02:12:21,280
think it will do justice to the games. I think it will be

2907
02:12:21,280 --> 02:12:23,280
something completely different. It might be good, it might be bad.

2908
02:12:23,280 --> 02:12:25,280
In general I think

2909
02:12:25,280 --> 02:12:27,280
video game movies have been pretty hit or miss.

2910
02:12:27,280 --> 02:12:29,280
But I'm pretty hopeful because I look at

2911
02:12:29,280 --> 02:12:31,280
something like the comic book industry

2912
02:12:31,280 --> 02:12:33,280
which they made a lot of

2913
02:12:33,280 --> 02:12:35,280
stinker comic book movies.

2914
02:12:35,280 --> 02:12:37,280
But eventually Hollywood and the comic

2915
02:12:37,280 --> 02:12:39,280
industry figured out how to do that.

2916
02:12:39,280 --> 02:12:41,280
And there have been some stellar comic book games.

2917
02:12:41,280 --> 02:12:43,280
So I have hope that in the future

2918
02:12:43,280 --> 02:12:45,280
they sort of solve that problem

2919
02:12:45,280 --> 02:12:47,280
for games

2920
02:12:47,280 --> 02:12:49,280
translating over to movies as well.

2921
02:12:49,280 --> 02:12:51,280
That's a good point.

2922
02:12:51,280 --> 02:12:53,280
I tend to agree with the other person that talked about

2923
02:12:53,280 --> 02:12:55,280
how if the right people with the right

2924
02:12:55,280 --> 02:12:57,280
passion are behind it

2925
02:12:57,280 --> 02:12:59,280
it has the potential to do very well.

2926
02:12:59,280 --> 02:13:01,280
Which you know anything Uwe Boll

2927
02:13:01,280 --> 02:13:03,280
touched you're like oh girl no.

2928
02:13:03,280 --> 02:13:05,280
I feel that

2929
02:13:05,280 --> 02:13:07,280
I'm assuming Sony is going to be

2930
02:13:07,280 --> 02:13:09,280
publishing the movie.

2931
02:13:09,280 --> 02:13:11,280
It's studios that they pick

2932
02:13:11,280 --> 02:13:13,280
to do these licenses.

2933
02:13:13,280 --> 02:13:15,280
I would assume that they're going to be

2934
02:13:15,280 --> 02:13:17,280
up to their standards

2935
02:13:17,280 --> 02:13:19,280
because it is

2936
02:13:19,280 --> 02:13:21,280
their properties that they're playing with.

2937
02:13:21,280 --> 02:13:23,280
I would think that they wouldn't just let anything

2938
02:13:23,280 --> 02:13:25,280
come to market.

2939
02:13:25,280 --> 02:13:27,280
I don't know.

2940
02:13:27,280 --> 02:13:29,280
They've done some tie-ins and stuff

2941
02:13:29,280 --> 02:13:31,280
with different EA properties

2942
02:13:31,280 --> 02:13:33,280
like some anime movies and I don't think those were that

2943
02:13:33,280 --> 02:13:35,280
bad.

2944
02:13:35,280 --> 02:13:37,280
Shane in our chat

2945
02:13:37,280 --> 02:13:39,280
room who of course has a thing or two to say

2946
02:13:39,280 --> 02:13:41,280
about Mass Effect says no one can agree with how

2947
02:13:41,280 --> 02:13:43,280
the Mass Effect movie should be because

2948
02:13:43,280 --> 02:13:45,280
we all have our different stories and shepherds.

2949
02:13:45,280 --> 02:13:47,280
Prince Brightstar says

2950
02:13:47,280 --> 02:13:49,280
frankly I think Mass Effect would be better as a Saturday

2951
02:13:49,280 --> 02:13:51,280
morning cartoon picturing the April

2952
02:13:51,280 --> 02:13:53,280
Fool's 12th well there was the anime

2953
02:13:53,280 --> 02:13:55,280
just saying. You know what actually I have

2954
02:13:55,280 --> 02:13:57,280
did I tell you I got that?

2955
02:13:57,280 --> 02:13:59,280
It wasn't terrible.

2956
02:13:59,280 --> 02:14:01,280
I hate

2957
02:14:01,280 --> 02:14:03,280
admitting that it wasn't terrible.

2958
02:14:03,280 --> 02:14:05,280
The ending of it

2959
02:14:05,280 --> 02:14:07,280
totally was like

2960
02:14:07,280 --> 02:14:09,280
you know all the stuff

2961
02:14:09,280 --> 02:14:11,280
that they do in Mass Effect 3 that wants to punch you in the

2962
02:14:11,280 --> 02:14:13,280
gut and make you vomit your feelings?

2963
02:14:13,280 --> 02:14:15,280
Yeah it did that too.

2964
02:14:15,280 --> 02:14:17,280
Alright.

2965
02:14:17,280 --> 02:14:19,280
To register participation for this week's

2966
02:14:19,280 --> 02:14:21,280
episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com

2967
02:14:21,280 --> 02:14:23,280
use the passphrase

2968
02:14:23,280 --> 02:14:25,280
yogurt. Let's do a couple

2969
02:14:25,280 --> 02:14:27,280
more news stories. We've got Listless coming up but first

2970
02:14:27,280 --> 02:14:29,280
Loki.

2971
02:14:29,280 --> 02:14:31,280
I'm sorry I forgot

2972
02:14:31,280 --> 02:14:33,280
to say at the end of the FUGL segment please

2973
02:14:33,280 --> 02:14:35,280
read the rest of the answers. I really skipped

2974
02:14:35,280 --> 02:14:37,280
a lot tonight because of time. Sorry.

2975
02:14:37,280 --> 02:14:39,280
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or

2976
02:14:39,280 --> 02:14:41,280
Google Plus search for Orange Lounge Radio.

2977
02:14:41,280 --> 02:14:43,280
Sorry Loki go ahead. So EA has had

2978
02:14:43,280 --> 02:14:45,280
some more layoffs. They haven't really said

2979
02:14:45,280 --> 02:14:47,280
who was laid off.

2980
02:14:47,280 --> 02:14:49,280
Apparently

2981
02:14:49,280 --> 02:14:51,280
I guess

2982
02:14:51,280 --> 02:14:53,280
there was an eternal memo that leaked out

2983
02:14:53,280 --> 02:14:55,280
basically

2984
02:14:55,280 --> 02:14:57,280
saying that you know at the beginning of their fiscal

2985
02:14:57,280 --> 02:14:59,280
year

2986
02:14:59,280 --> 02:15:01,280
they're cutting some of their operations.

2987
02:15:01,280 --> 02:15:03,280
Core marketing

2988
02:15:03,280 --> 02:15:05,280
functions have been consolidated

2989
02:15:05,280 --> 02:15:07,280
under their new COO.

2990
02:15:07,280 --> 02:15:09,280
I

2991
02:15:09,280 --> 02:15:11,280
guess they're just restructuring it looks like.

2992
02:15:11,280 --> 02:15:13,280
And

2993
02:15:13,280 --> 02:15:15,280
also

2994
02:15:15,280 --> 02:15:17,280
with that there was a rumor that EA

2995
02:15:17,280 --> 02:15:19,280
partners label is closing.

2996
02:15:19,280 --> 02:15:21,280
And that includes you know all those

2997
02:15:21,280 --> 02:15:23,280
other

2998
02:15:23,280 --> 02:15:25,280
you know developers out there that are bringing different

2999
02:15:25,280 --> 02:15:27,280
titles. There's you know of course the crisis series

3000
02:15:27,280 --> 02:15:29,280
Shadows of the Damned, Alice, The Madness

3001
02:15:29,280 --> 02:15:31,280
Returns, Bulletstorm,

3002
02:15:31,280 --> 02:15:33,280
Brutal Legend, and Rock Band.

3003
02:15:33,280 --> 02:15:35,280
And I guess I

3004
02:15:35,280 --> 02:15:37,280
wonder if that would affect Fuse. But of course

3005
02:15:37,280 --> 02:15:39,280
Fuse is just right around the corner so I'm sure that game

3006
02:15:39,280 --> 02:15:41,280
will still come out. But we may see

3007
02:15:41,280 --> 02:15:43,280
a lot less

3008
02:15:43,280 --> 02:15:45,280
I guess

3009
02:15:45,280 --> 02:15:47,280
not necessarily

3010
02:15:47,280 --> 02:15:49,280
experimental titles but titles that aren't

3011
02:15:49,280 --> 02:15:51,280
they aren't positive

3012
02:15:51,280 --> 02:15:53,280
would do well. Like new properties

3013
02:15:53,280 --> 02:15:55,280
like Mirror's Edge or something like that.

3014
02:15:55,280 --> 02:15:57,280
You know Alice

3015
02:15:57,280 --> 02:15:59,280
thought that would have done okay but

3016
02:15:59,280 --> 02:16:01,280
apparently it didn't sell very well in the shadows of the dam.

3017
02:16:01,280 --> 02:16:03,280
Suda is

3018
02:16:03,280 --> 02:16:05,280
hard to

3019
02:16:05,280 --> 02:16:07,280
it's more niche

3020
02:16:07,280 --> 02:16:09,280
so it's

3021
02:16:09,280 --> 02:16:11,280
I'm surprised. And then last but not least

3022
02:16:13,280 --> 02:16:15,280
SimCity

3023
02:16:15,280 --> 02:16:17,280
You know there's always bad news

3024
02:16:17,280 --> 02:16:19,280
when I mention SimCity. It got a patch

3025
02:16:19,280 --> 02:16:21,280
it fixed some bugs.

3026
02:16:21,280 --> 02:16:23,280
Godzilla is attacking

3027
02:16:23,280 --> 02:16:25,280
the city!

3028
02:16:25,280 --> 02:16:27,280
Well

3029
02:16:27,280 --> 02:16:29,280
SimCity 2.0

3030
02:16:29,280 --> 02:16:31,280
came out. It fixed

3031
02:16:31,280 --> 02:16:33,280
a few bugs

3032
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:35,280
and unfortunately created a bunch of other

3033
02:16:35,280 --> 02:16:37,280
bugs.

3034
02:16:37,280 --> 02:16:39,280
So yeah

3035
02:16:39,280 --> 02:16:41,280
lots of weird stuff.

3036
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:43,280
We're pathing problems still.

3037
02:16:43,280 --> 02:16:45,280
Apparently the problem was sewage backing

3038
02:16:45,280 --> 02:16:47,280
up. So

3039
02:16:47,280 --> 02:16:49,280
your towns are literally full of shit now.

3040
02:16:49,280 --> 02:16:51,280
All sorts of

3041
02:16:51,280 --> 02:16:53,280
sinking problems.

3042
02:16:53,280 --> 02:16:55,280
Yeah they actually have this group of people

3043
02:16:55,280 --> 02:16:57,280
on Reddit

3044
02:16:57,280 --> 02:16:59,280
putting together a list of stuff that's

3045
02:16:59,280 --> 02:17:01,280
wrong with it now.

3046
02:17:01,280 --> 02:17:03,280
So that kind of sucks.

3047
02:17:03,280 --> 02:17:05,280
It's still a work in progress.

3048
02:17:05,280 --> 02:17:07,280
And then falsely accused all the wrong people of making

3049
02:17:07,280 --> 02:17:09,280
those bugs.

3050
02:17:09,280 --> 02:17:11,280
I guess.

3051
02:17:11,280 --> 02:17:13,280
No tea no shade.

3052
02:17:13,280 --> 02:17:15,280
Alright.

3053
02:17:15,280 --> 02:17:17,280
Anything else you want to

3054
02:17:17,280 --> 02:17:19,280
share about SimCity?

3055
02:17:19,280 --> 02:17:21,280
SimCity 4

3056
02:17:21,280 --> 02:17:23,280
apparently is on sale right now. You can get it for

3057
02:17:23,280 --> 02:17:25,280
really cheap. So if you want to play a great SimCity game

3058
02:17:25,280 --> 02:17:27,280
there you go.

3059
02:17:27,280 --> 02:17:29,280
And it's offline.

3060
02:17:29,280 --> 02:17:31,280
Moving on. I think this is

3061
02:17:31,280 --> 02:17:33,280
fascinating. A patent that Apple filed in

3062
02:17:33,280 --> 02:17:35,280
2009.

3063
02:17:35,280 --> 02:17:37,280
What the patent is all about is that

3064
02:17:37,280 --> 02:17:39,280
you have a path that you might take in

3065
02:17:39,280 --> 02:17:41,280
a video game. And what's

3066
02:17:41,280 --> 02:17:43,280
fascinating about this is that in

3067
02:17:43,280 --> 02:17:45,280
the patent filing they

3068
02:17:45,280 --> 02:17:47,280
freaking use these mock ups of mass effect

3069
02:17:47,280 --> 02:17:49,280
screenshots. And it even says

3070
02:17:49,280 --> 02:17:51,280
name. John Sheppard. Origin

3071
02:17:51,280 --> 02:17:53,280
colonist. And like a little mock up of what they

3072
02:17:53,280 --> 02:17:55,280
look like and everything. That's the first thing that made me

3073
02:17:55,280 --> 02:17:57,280
go is this like a joke or a troll or

3074
02:17:57,280 --> 02:17:59,280
you know. LOL games journalism

3075
02:17:59,280 --> 02:18:01,280
thing. I don't know. But since it's floating around

3076
02:18:01,280 --> 02:18:03,280
out there I will report on it because I think this is a

3077
02:18:03,280 --> 02:18:05,280
fascinating idea.

3078
02:18:05,280 --> 02:18:07,280
The patent office

3079
02:18:07,280 --> 02:18:09,280
did grant Apple this patent. And it was

3080
02:18:09,280 --> 02:18:11,280
made public. And

3081
02:18:11,280 --> 02:18:13,280
it would go like this. Like let's say

3082
02:18:13,280 --> 02:18:15,280
in mass effect you make all

3083
02:18:15,280 --> 02:18:17,280
these different choices. Or let me take a game that

3084
02:18:17,280 --> 02:18:19,280
you know Loki would actually play

3085
02:18:19,280 --> 02:18:21,280
like Walking Dead. Like the

3086
02:18:21,280 --> 02:18:23,280
Walking Dead games.

3087
02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:25,280
Well the Telltale ones are really good.

3088
02:18:25,280 --> 02:18:27,280
Let's say you go through the Walking Dead games

3089
02:18:27,280 --> 02:18:29,280
you make your different choices and obviously they have

3090
02:18:29,280 --> 02:18:31,280
a big impact. Well the trick about this

3091
02:18:31,280 --> 02:18:33,280
patent is that at the end after

3092
02:18:33,280 --> 02:18:35,280
you've developed your character played the game. So imagine

3093
02:18:35,280 --> 02:18:37,280
you play a game like Walking Dead at the end

3094
02:18:37,280 --> 02:18:39,280
you can use this system that

3095
02:18:39,280 --> 02:18:41,280
Apple patented and you get a

3096
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:43,280
single issue comic

3097
02:18:43,280 --> 02:18:45,280
that is filled with the

3098
02:18:45,280 --> 02:18:47,280
choices that you made in the game. And the dialogue

3099
02:18:47,280 --> 02:18:49,280
and the screenshots. And you could export it

3100
02:18:49,280 --> 02:18:51,280
assumably to like a PDF that you could

3101
02:18:51,280 --> 02:18:53,280
then later read on your tablet or your

3102
02:18:53,280 --> 02:18:55,280
mobile device or what have you.

3103
02:18:55,280 --> 02:18:57,280
So like imagine Jamie could have her femshep

3104
02:18:57,280 --> 02:18:59,280
and romance garis and all this and she gets

3105
02:18:59,280 --> 02:19:01,280
her very own. Cause that's the only point

3106
02:19:01,280 --> 02:19:03,280
of playing mass effect. Well that is all you

3107
02:19:03,280 --> 02:19:05,280
do right? Yes.

3108
02:19:05,280 --> 02:19:07,280
So you get your comic book. And strip

3109
02:19:07,280 --> 02:19:09,280
mine planets. And you know Dark Sakura

3110
02:19:09,280 --> 02:19:11,280
presents Shakerian Sunday

3111
02:19:11,280 --> 02:19:13,280
and it's something she can

3112
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:15,280
get on her iPad

3113
02:19:15,280 --> 02:19:17,280
and read it. And it's like oh it's

3114
02:19:17,280 --> 02:19:19,280
it's me and my garis.

3115
02:19:19,280 --> 02:19:21,280
I am not that bad.

3116
02:19:21,280 --> 02:19:23,280
Are you sure? I don't have the moe pillow.

3117
02:19:25,280 --> 02:19:27,280
But you thought about it.

3118
02:19:27,280 --> 02:19:29,280
No I didn't. Did you see how expensive

3119
02:19:29,280 --> 02:19:31,280
it was?

3120
02:19:31,280 --> 02:19:33,280
I love how that

3121
02:19:33,280 --> 02:19:35,280
was the reason. Look at me.

3122
02:19:35,280 --> 02:19:37,280
That was the reason. I don't have money

3123
02:19:37,280 --> 02:19:39,280
for a pillow.

3124
02:19:39,280 --> 02:19:41,280
And besides I didn't really care for the art that much.

3125
02:19:41,280 --> 02:19:43,280
Alright actually very popular

3126
02:19:43,280 --> 02:19:45,280
in our chat room. ActDeaf says

3127
02:19:45,280 --> 02:19:47,280
this thing Rob is talking about is fucking awesome.

3128
02:19:47,280 --> 02:19:49,280
SG100Matt says this sounds like a good idea.

3129
02:19:49,280 --> 02:19:51,280
ActDeaf says where do I throw my money

3130
02:19:51,280 --> 02:19:53,280
to?

3131
02:19:53,280 --> 02:19:55,280
Queen Simeon in our chat says that's

3132
02:19:55,280 --> 02:19:57,280
like the little personalized vanity books

3133
02:19:57,280 --> 02:19:59,280
back when I was a kid. Oh yeah

3134
02:19:59,280 --> 02:20:01,280
like the choose your own adventure stuff

3135
02:20:01,280 --> 02:20:03,280
where like it would be you in the story.

3136
02:20:03,280 --> 02:20:05,280
Don't they sell that at the fair or something like that?

3137
02:20:05,280 --> 02:20:07,280
They brought back choose your own adventure.

3138
02:20:07,280 --> 02:20:09,280
Yeah Bobby was talking about something like that on the show tonight.

3139
02:20:09,280 --> 02:20:11,280
I miss those but I used to skip to the end

3140
02:20:11,280 --> 02:20:13,280
to see what the best

3141
02:20:13,280 --> 02:20:15,280
because there's only like one path fits.

3142
02:20:15,280 --> 02:20:17,280
Right.

3143
02:20:17,280 --> 02:20:19,280
Where you don't sneeze horrifically

3144
02:20:19,280 --> 02:20:21,280
in the middle of a show.

3145
02:20:21,280 --> 02:20:23,280
Twice.

3146
02:20:25,280 --> 02:20:27,280
You know what?

3147
02:20:27,280 --> 02:20:29,280
Don't laugh at me making squeaky noises.

3148
02:20:29,280 --> 02:20:31,280
No that was like the cutest sound I've ever heard.

3149
02:20:31,280 --> 02:20:33,280
I'm allergic to Papa Murphy's

3150
02:20:33,280 --> 02:20:35,280
I think.

3151
02:20:35,280 --> 02:20:37,280
Garris would approve of your cute sneezes.

3152
02:20:37,280 --> 02:20:39,280
What were you going to say about the vanity books?

3153
02:20:39,280 --> 02:20:41,280
I forget.

3154
02:20:41,280 --> 02:20:43,280
Alright.

3155
02:20:43,280 --> 02:20:45,280
And thank you.

3156
02:20:45,280 --> 02:20:47,280
Alright.

3157
02:20:47,280 --> 02:20:49,280
This is a good idea.

3158
02:20:49,280 --> 02:20:51,280
Yeah the vanity books

3159
02:20:51,280 --> 02:20:53,280
is a really good comparison but in this day and age

3160
02:20:53,280 --> 02:20:55,280
where you just crank it all out digitally

3161
02:20:55,280 --> 02:20:57,280
into a 99 cent PDF or something

3162
02:20:57,280 --> 02:20:59,280
I think it's a great

3163
02:20:59,280 --> 02:21:01,280
as corny as this is going to sound

3164
02:21:01,280 --> 02:21:03,280
it would be a great memory

3165
02:21:03,280 --> 02:21:05,280
of your gaming experience.

3166
02:21:05,280 --> 02:21:07,280
Because like you know a game like Mass Effect

3167
02:21:07,280 --> 02:21:09,280
you know again I hate to keep using this as an example

3168
02:21:09,280 --> 02:21:11,280
but it's such a good example.

3169
02:21:11,280 --> 02:21:13,280
It takes like 40 hours to play through Mass Effect

3170
02:21:13,280 --> 02:21:15,280
and then maybe you're sitting here for two years

3171
02:21:15,280 --> 02:21:17,280
waiting for the sequel to come out.

3172
02:21:17,280 --> 02:21:19,280
Well wouldn't it be great if instead of having to replay

3173
02:21:19,280 --> 02:21:21,280
that 40 hour game like to kind of refresh yourself

3174
02:21:21,280 --> 02:21:23,280
oh let me read my little comic

3175
02:21:23,280 --> 02:21:25,280
that I had generated at the end and remember

3176
02:21:25,280 --> 02:21:27,280
about my character and my choices.

3177
02:21:27,280 --> 02:21:29,280
People do that anyway it's called fan fiction.

3178
02:21:29,280 --> 02:21:31,280
It's called Tumblr.

3179
02:21:31,280 --> 02:21:33,280
No no no.

3180
02:21:33,280 --> 02:21:35,280
I think that's a pretty accurate statement.

3181
02:21:35,280 --> 02:21:37,280
It's called Tumblr.

3182
02:21:37,280 --> 02:21:39,280
So did Apple try to patent Tumblr is that what we're saying?

3183
02:21:39,280 --> 02:21:41,280
Alright.

3184
02:21:41,280 --> 02:21:43,280
Let's go to something

3185
02:21:43,280 --> 02:21:45,280
that's going to need a patent here.

3186
02:21:45,280 --> 02:21:47,280
It's tonight's Listless.

3187
02:21:55,280 --> 02:21:57,280
Alright for those of you guys that have never been here

3188
02:21:57,280 --> 02:21:59,280
for Listless before let me tell you how it works.

3189
02:21:59,280 --> 02:22:01,280
We're going to go around

3190
02:22:01,280 --> 02:22:03,280
well first the point of this whole thing

3191
02:22:03,280 --> 02:22:05,280
is that we are going to come up with

3192
02:22:05,280 --> 02:22:07,280
the definitive list.

3193
02:22:07,280 --> 02:22:09,280
No arguments, no exceptions.

3194
02:22:09,280 --> 02:22:11,280
We're going to solve a great

3195
02:22:11,280 --> 02:22:13,280
question in gaming right now

3196
02:22:13,280 --> 02:22:15,280
with this highly scientific process.

3197
02:22:15,280 --> 02:22:17,280
And the way it's going to work we're going to all go around the room

3198
02:22:17,280 --> 02:22:19,280
there's five of us tonight so it's like a super Listless

3199
02:22:19,280 --> 02:22:21,280
Super Mario Listless.

3200
02:22:21,280 --> 02:22:23,280
We're going to go around the room tonight

3201
02:22:23,280 --> 02:22:25,280
and each of us are going to name three

3202
02:22:25,280 --> 02:22:27,280
things for the list. We're going to nominate them for the list.

3203
02:22:27,280 --> 02:22:29,280
But then the exciting part

3204
02:22:29,280 --> 02:22:31,280
is we go around the room and each person

3205
02:22:31,280 --> 02:22:33,280
will strike one item that is

3206
02:22:33,280 --> 02:22:35,280
not worthy of the list.

3207
02:22:35,280 --> 02:22:37,280
And remember our new twist as of the last time

3208
02:22:37,280 --> 02:22:39,280
we did this should a host have

3209
02:22:39,280 --> 02:22:41,280
two of their items eliminated from the list

3210
02:22:41,280 --> 02:22:43,280
the third item gets

3211
02:22:43,280 --> 02:22:45,280
immunity so that way it does

3212
02:22:45,280 --> 02:22:47,280
not like a person's entire list doesn't get eliminated.

3213
02:22:47,280 --> 02:22:49,280
So and then

3214
02:22:49,280 --> 02:22:51,280
the chat room will vote on their top

3215
02:22:51,280 --> 02:22:53,280
and we will get the one, two, and three.

3216
02:22:53,280 --> 02:22:55,280
The definitive list.

3217
02:22:55,280 --> 02:22:57,280
So here it is. Chatters if you want to help out tonight

3218
02:22:57,280 --> 02:22:59,280
start yelling your answers in

3219
02:22:59,280 --> 02:23:01,280
chat now. The topic tonight

3220
02:23:01,280 --> 02:23:03,280
mascot we most want

3221
02:23:03,280 --> 02:23:05,280
to gift to Sega

3222
02:23:05,280 --> 02:23:07,280
on behalf of OLR. Earlier in the show

3223
02:23:07,280 --> 02:23:09,280
we talked about Sega

3224
02:23:09,280 --> 02:23:11,280
Sega is looking for your

3225
02:23:11,280 --> 02:23:13,280
mascot in a nutshell. I mean I'm really

3226
02:23:13,280 --> 02:23:15,280
cutting corners here but they're looking for your

3227
02:23:15,280 --> 02:23:17,280
mascot ideas and they could use them

3228
02:23:17,280 --> 02:23:19,280
in a future press conference.

3229
02:23:19,280 --> 02:23:21,280
So we want to give them something on behalf of OLR

3230
02:23:21,280 --> 02:23:23,280
and VOG and all that. So here we go

3231
02:23:23,280 --> 02:23:25,280
going around the room

3232
02:23:25,280 --> 02:23:27,280
and giving our list

3233
02:23:27,280 --> 02:23:29,280
of the

3234
02:23:29,280 --> 02:23:31,280
mascots we'd most like to see.

3235
02:23:31,280 --> 02:23:33,280
Ladies first DarkSakura your number

3236
02:23:33,280 --> 02:23:35,280
three answer tonight. What

3237
02:23:35,280 --> 02:23:37,280
mascot would you most like to gift

3238
02:23:37,280 --> 02:23:39,280
Sega? Master System

3239
02:23:39,280 --> 02:23:41,280
the Sega robot.

3240
02:23:41,280 --> 02:23:47,280
And what would Master System the Sega robot be?

3241
02:23:47,280 --> 02:23:49,280
He'd be a cute robot

3242
02:23:49,280 --> 02:23:51,280
but he wouldn't be like mecha sonic because that would be

3243
02:23:51,280 --> 02:23:53,280
too derivative. He'd just be a cute

3244
02:23:53,280 --> 02:23:55,280
little chibi robot or maybe

3245
02:23:55,280 --> 02:23:57,280
powerful like one of the Robo-Eleste

3246
02:23:57,280 --> 02:23:59,280
robots.

3247
02:23:59,280 --> 02:24:01,280
Because Robo-Eleste needs more love

3248
02:24:01,280 --> 02:24:03,280
that game was awesome shut up.

3249
02:24:03,280 --> 02:24:05,280
I'm with you on that. But his name would be

3250
02:24:05,280 --> 02:24:07,280
Master System. Alright.

3251
02:24:07,280 --> 02:24:09,280
Because the Master System hello.

3252
02:24:09,280 --> 02:24:11,280
Alright.

3253
02:24:11,280 --> 02:24:13,280
Let's go around. Loki how about your

3254
02:24:13,280 --> 02:24:15,280
number three answer tonight for the list.

3255
02:24:15,280 --> 02:24:17,280
That's easy President Cat.

3256
02:24:17,280 --> 02:24:19,280
Why? Because it's

3257
02:24:19,280 --> 02:24:21,280
President Cat. Well that is a very

3258
02:24:21,280 --> 02:24:23,280
OLR thing and is being shouted by a lot of people in chat.

3259
02:24:23,280 --> 02:24:25,280
So President Cat. So I thought we had to pick something

3260
02:24:25,280 --> 02:24:27,280
original. Not necessarily.

3261
02:24:27,280 --> 02:24:29,280
Well who said President Cat has to

3262
02:24:29,280 --> 02:24:31,280
be that same President Cat? Since

3263
02:24:31,280 --> 02:24:33,280
clearly that game company didn't give

3264
02:24:33,280 --> 02:24:35,280
a fuck about our idea.

3265
02:24:35,280 --> 02:24:37,280
And you

3266
02:24:37,280 --> 02:24:39,280
might remember the translation was something like what

3267
02:24:39,280 --> 02:24:41,280
Boss Cat we said President Cat. No

3268
02:24:41,280 --> 02:24:43,280
Sukeban is like a female delinquent

3269
02:24:43,280 --> 02:24:45,280
and Shacho is like a

3270
02:24:45,280 --> 02:24:47,280
company president. You're like a female delinquent.

3271
02:24:47,280 --> 02:24:49,280
Shut you know what Rob?

3272
02:24:49,280 --> 02:24:51,280
What? I'm going to hit you in the face with a yo-yo.

3273
02:24:51,280 --> 02:24:53,280
And the only people

3274
02:24:53,280 --> 02:24:55,280
who would get that are people who actually sell Sukeban

3275
02:24:55,280 --> 02:24:57,280
Deca.

3276
02:24:57,280 --> 02:24:59,280
Alright.

3277
02:24:59,280 --> 02:25:01,280
SSG 100

3278
02:25:01,280 --> 02:25:03,280
Matt had a really good suggestion.

3279
02:25:03,280 --> 02:25:05,280
I will do my

3280
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:07,280
number three answer then. My number three

3281
02:25:07,280 --> 02:25:09,280
answer for the list is well here's

3282
02:25:09,280 --> 02:25:11,280
the thing. Okay so on the Bobby

3283
02:25:11,280 --> 02:25:13,280
Black Wolf show he has an unofficial

3284
02:25:13,280 --> 02:25:15,280
mascot called Clicky the pen.

3285
02:25:15,280 --> 02:25:17,280
But if I were to try to steal

3286
02:25:17,280 --> 02:25:19,280
that on behalf of OLR

3287
02:25:19,280 --> 02:25:21,280
he might get very mad and threaten to sue.

3288
02:25:21,280 --> 02:25:23,280
So my number three answer tonight is

3289
02:25:23,280 --> 02:25:25,280
Dicky the pen.

3290
02:25:25,280 --> 02:25:27,280
Dicky the pen

3291
02:25:27,280 --> 02:25:29,280
is awesome.

3292
02:25:29,280 --> 02:25:31,280
Get it?

3293
02:25:31,280 --> 02:25:33,280
Dicky the pen

3294
02:25:33,280 --> 02:25:35,280
is awesome.

3295
02:25:35,280 --> 02:25:37,280
Just

3296
02:25:37,280 --> 02:25:39,280
think about that one for a little bit. Alright hey

3297
02:25:39,280 --> 02:25:41,280
Spike who's over there frowning at my

3298
02:25:41,280 --> 02:25:43,280
answer. What is your

3299
02:25:43,280 --> 02:25:45,280
number three answer for the list of

3300
02:25:45,280 --> 02:25:47,280
mascot you'd like to gift to Sega? I'd like to

3301
02:25:47,280 --> 02:25:49,280
gift to Sega Rob Roberts

3302
02:25:49,280 --> 02:25:51,280
in a Bjork swan dress.

3303
02:25:51,280 --> 02:25:53,280
Okay.

3304
02:25:53,280 --> 02:25:55,280
Do I have to

3305
02:25:55,280 --> 02:25:57,280
do I have to sing like her?

3306
02:25:57,280 --> 02:25:59,280
You have to have the egg purse too.

3307
02:25:59,280 --> 02:26:01,280
I'm a

3308
02:26:01,280 --> 02:26:03,280
fountain of love

3309
02:26:03,280 --> 02:26:05,280
in the

3310
02:26:05,280 --> 02:26:07,280
shade of love

3311
02:26:07,280 --> 02:26:09,280
I feel so bad for your listeners.

3312
02:26:09,280 --> 02:26:11,280
I'm

3313
02:26:11,280 --> 02:26:13,280
just singing Bjork.

3314
02:26:13,280 --> 02:26:15,280
Alright.

3315
02:26:15,280 --> 02:26:17,280
Lastly

3316
02:26:17,280 --> 02:26:19,280
but not leastly with the number three item

3317
02:26:19,280 --> 02:26:21,280
for the list tonight. Tim what is your contribution

3318
02:26:21,280 --> 02:26:23,280
to the list? Well since I think that

3319
02:26:23,280 --> 02:26:25,280
crowdsourcing a new mascot is kind of sad

3320
02:26:25,280 --> 02:26:27,280
I think a good mascot for them would be

3321
02:26:27,280 --> 02:26:29,280
a 32x with a frowny face.

3322
02:26:29,280 --> 02:26:31,280
So a regular 32x.

3323
02:26:31,280 --> 02:26:33,280
A 32x

3324
02:26:33,280 --> 02:26:35,280
with a frown face.

3325
02:26:35,280 --> 02:26:37,280
Alright.

3326
02:26:37,280 --> 02:26:39,280
Let's go to the number two answers.

3327
02:26:39,280 --> 02:26:41,280
Jamie.

3328
02:26:41,280 --> 02:26:43,280
Well keep in mind I'm not doing mine in any particular

3329
02:26:43,280 --> 02:26:45,280
order I'm just doing them in the order I want to list them in.

3330
02:26:45,280 --> 02:26:47,280
Fine. Segata Sanshiro the second.

3331
02:26:47,280 --> 02:26:49,280
Somebody

3332
02:26:49,280 --> 02:26:51,280
in chat said that earlier I think.

3333
02:26:51,280 --> 02:26:53,280
Yeah but they actually said Segata

3334
02:26:53,280 --> 02:26:55,280
Sanshiro but since I'm being original it's

3335
02:26:55,280 --> 02:26:57,280
Segata Sanshiro

3336
02:26:57,280 --> 02:26:59,280
the second. It's

3337
02:26:59,280 --> 02:27:01,280
ATA.

3338
02:27:01,280 --> 02:27:03,280
Segata Sanshiro

3339
02:27:03,280 --> 02:27:05,280
the second. Alright.

3340
02:27:05,280 --> 02:27:07,280
And if you

3341
02:27:07,280 --> 02:27:09,280
don't have seen it look up the Segata Sanshiro

3342
02:27:09,280 --> 02:27:11,280
videos after the show.

3343
02:27:11,280 --> 02:27:13,280
Alright. Loki your number two

3344
02:27:13,280 --> 02:27:15,280
answer tonight. A forklift.

3345
02:27:21,280 --> 02:27:23,280
And why would their mascot be a

3346
02:27:23,280 --> 02:27:25,280
forklift? Did you not play Shenmue?

3347
02:27:25,280 --> 02:27:27,280
Oh okay I get it yeah yeah yeah.

3348
02:27:31,280 --> 02:27:33,280
I think you can even incorporate it into like new

3349
02:27:33,280 --> 02:27:35,280
I thought there was going to be a joke there about

3350
02:27:35,280 --> 02:27:37,280
like moving things into the warehouse

3351
02:27:37,280 --> 02:27:39,280
but alright fine.

3352
02:27:39,280 --> 02:27:41,280
Whatever however you want to take it.

3353
02:27:41,280 --> 02:27:43,280
It's funny in multiple formats.

3354
02:27:43,280 --> 02:27:45,280
I think the joke was how you didn't get it.

3355
02:27:45,280 --> 02:27:47,280
I just I'm sorry my

3356
02:27:47,280 --> 02:27:49,280
brain didn't instantly think of Shenmue

3357
02:27:49,280 --> 02:27:51,280
out of all the video games in the world. It should always

3358
02:27:51,280 --> 02:27:53,280
think of Shenmue.

3359
02:27:53,280 --> 02:27:55,280
I apologize.

3360
02:27:55,280 --> 02:27:57,280
Alright my number two answer tonight.

3361
02:27:57,280 --> 02:27:59,280
Let's see I'm gonna take

3362
02:27:59,280 --> 02:28:01,280
this one from chat because it's so good

3363
02:28:01,280 --> 02:28:03,280
and I didn't really like the answer that I had written

3364
02:28:03,280 --> 02:28:05,280
but I think a great mascot on behalf

3365
02:28:05,280 --> 02:28:07,280
of Orange Lounge Radio would be

3366
02:28:07,280 --> 02:28:09,280
Non-Sylon Occupied Caprica

3367
02:28:09,280 --> 02:28:11,280
would be their mascot.

3368
02:28:11,280 --> 02:28:13,280
You are awful.

3369
02:28:13,280 --> 02:28:15,280
I approve but you're awful.

3370
02:28:15,280 --> 02:28:17,280
It's a long running

3371
02:28:17,280 --> 02:28:19,280
OLR joke Spike. Just smile

3372
02:28:19,280 --> 02:28:21,280
and nod. Alright Non-Sylon Occupied Caprica

3373
02:28:21,280 --> 02:28:23,280
from S.H.O.N. and I'm out is my number two

3374
02:28:23,280 --> 02:28:25,280
answer for the list. So Captain

3375
02:28:25,280 --> 02:28:27,280
Spike what is your number two answer for the list?

3376
02:28:27,280 --> 02:28:29,280
So I don't know your memes or anything

3377
02:28:29,280 --> 02:28:31,280
so I'm just gonna go with Dark Sakura

3378
02:28:31,280 --> 02:28:33,280
in a sailor suit.

3379
02:28:35,280 --> 02:28:37,280
Can I at least have a gun?

3380
02:28:37,280 --> 02:28:39,280
Sure. Yay!

3381
02:28:39,280 --> 02:28:41,280
Dark Sakura in a sailor

3382
02:28:41,280 --> 02:28:43,280
suit and a gun.

3383
02:28:43,280 --> 02:28:45,280
Why?

3384
02:28:45,280 --> 02:28:47,280
Because look at her that would be badass.

3385
02:28:47,280 --> 02:28:49,280
I thought it was a Duffy thing. Actually

3386
02:28:49,280 --> 02:28:51,280
you know what? I love

3387
02:28:51,280 --> 02:28:53,280
Duffy! I thought it was because Duffy wore a sailor.

3388
02:28:53,280 --> 02:28:55,280
Oh! Oh sure! Sure when you don't

3389
02:28:55,280 --> 02:28:57,280
get my references that's okay.

3390
02:28:57,280 --> 02:28:59,280
I don't get your references and that's a crime

3391
02:28:59,280 --> 02:29:01,280
against gaming.

3392
02:29:01,280 --> 02:29:03,280
Yep. By the way

3393
02:29:03,280 --> 02:29:05,280
little factoid my very first cosplay

3394
02:29:05,280 --> 02:29:07,280
ever was Sailor Venus.

3395
02:29:07,280 --> 02:29:09,280
That's awesome.

3396
02:29:09,280 --> 02:29:11,280
This skirt was way too short.

3397
02:29:11,280 --> 02:29:13,280
Alright

3398
02:29:13,280 --> 02:29:15,280
let's go to Spike. In the name of the moon

3399
02:29:15,280 --> 02:29:17,280
I will fuck you up. Let's go to

3400
02:29:17,280 --> 02:29:19,280
Tim's number two answer. Tim

3401
02:29:19,280 --> 02:29:21,280
what is your number two answer for the list? It was actually

3402
02:29:21,280 --> 02:29:23,280
really similar to Spike's and we did not plan it

3403
02:29:23,280 --> 02:29:25,280
that way but it was

3404
02:29:25,280 --> 02:29:27,280
the entire like all three OLR

3405
02:29:27,280 --> 02:29:29,280
hosts doing Bayonetta cosplay.

3406
02:29:29,280 --> 02:29:31,280
I don't have that much hair.

3407
02:29:31,280 --> 02:29:33,280
Can Loki be Jean?

3408
02:29:33,280 --> 02:29:35,280
Yeah

3409
02:29:35,280 --> 02:29:37,280
Loki can be Jean. Rob has to be the other witch.

3410
02:29:37,280 --> 02:29:39,280
What was her?

3411
02:29:39,280 --> 02:29:41,280
Yeah no.

3412
02:29:41,280 --> 02:29:43,280
He can be the little girl.

3413
02:29:43,280 --> 02:29:45,280
The little young virgin.

3414
02:29:45,280 --> 02:29:47,280
No! I will not be a little girl.

3415
02:29:47,280 --> 02:29:49,280
I'm not you. You be Jean.

3416
02:29:49,280 --> 02:29:51,280
He be the little girl. Oh okay I'm sexy right?

3417
02:29:51,280 --> 02:29:53,280
I guess.

3418
02:29:53,280 --> 02:29:55,280
You'll be wearing a breastplate.

3419
02:29:55,280 --> 02:29:57,280
I didn't say yes I just said I guess.

3420
02:29:57,280 --> 02:29:59,280
Alright so far the

3421
02:29:59,280 --> 02:30:01,280
list of mascots we will give to Sega.

3422
02:30:01,280 --> 02:30:03,280
Master System the Sega robot.

3423
02:30:03,280 --> 02:30:05,280
President Kat. Dickey the pen.

3424
02:30:05,280 --> 02:30:07,280
Rob Robertson

3425
02:30:07,280 --> 02:30:09,280
a Bjork swan dress.

3426
02:30:09,280 --> 02:30:11,280
32X with a frowny face.

3427
02:30:11,280 --> 02:30:13,280
Segata Sanshiro the second.

3428
02:30:13,280 --> 02:30:15,280
A forklift. Non-silon occupied

3429
02:30:15,280 --> 02:30:17,280
Caprica. Dark Sakura in a sailor

3430
02:30:17,280 --> 02:30:19,280
suit and a gun. All

3431
02:30:19,280 --> 02:30:21,280
OLR hosts in Bayonetta cosplay.

3432
02:30:21,280 --> 02:30:23,280
This is the worst list ever. Hey I'm already wearing the glasses.

3433
02:30:23,280 --> 02:30:25,280
I just like how everyone assumed I would

3434
02:30:25,280 --> 02:30:27,280
be Bayonetta so thank you.

3435
02:30:27,280 --> 02:30:29,280
The only way I would

3436
02:30:29,280 --> 02:30:31,280
wear high heels is if they had guns on them.

3437
02:30:31,280 --> 02:30:33,280
Number one

3438
02:30:33,280 --> 02:30:35,280
answers for the list.

3439
02:30:35,280 --> 02:30:37,280
Here we go.

3440
02:30:37,280 --> 02:30:39,280
Dark Sakura.

3441
02:30:39,280 --> 02:30:41,280
Oppa Oppa's retarded cousin Oppai Oppai that looks like a huge

3442
02:30:41,280 --> 02:30:43,280
boob.

3443
02:30:43,280 --> 02:30:45,280
That was oddly specific.

3444
02:30:45,280 --> 02:30:47,280
Oppai

3445
02:30:47,280 --> 02:30:49,280
is boob in Japanese.

3446
02:30:49,280 --> 02:30:51,280
So it would be

3447
02:30:51,280 --> 02:30:53,280
I won't use the R

3448
02:30:53,280 --> 02:30:55,280
word in the answer. I will say

3449
02:30:55,280 --> 02:30:57,280
Oppa Oppa's Oppai huge boob

3450
02:30:57,280 --> 02:30:59,280
cousin. It's O-P-P-A-I by the way.

3451
02:30:59,280 --> 02:31:01,280
Oppai!

3452
02:31:01,280 --> 02:31:03,280
Oppai Oppai.

3453
02:31:03,280 --> 02:31:05,280
Yeah. Instead of Oppa Oppa.

3454
02:31:05,280 --> 02:31:07,280
Because we all know that Fantasy

3455
02:31:07,280 --> 02:31:09,280
Zone is awesome.

3456
02:31:09,280 --> 02:31:11,280
Okay. There we go.

3457
02:31:11,280 --> 02:31:13,280
Loki your number one

3458
02:31:13,280 --> 02:31:15,280
answer. Ooh La La.

3459
02:31:15,280 --> 02:31:17,280
Because

3460
02:31:17,280 --> 02:31:19,280
why not? But Ooh La La

3461
02:31:19,280 --> 02:31:21,280
is already a Sega character. But she's not

3462
02:31:21,280 --> 02:31:23,280
a mascot. Yeah she does mascot stuff.

3463
02:31:23,280 --> 02:31:25,280
Kinda. Alright fine.

3464
02:31:25,280 --> 02:31:27,280
Space Michael Jackson.

3465
02:31:27,280 --> 02:31:29,280
Space Michael.

3466
02:31:29,280 --> 02:31:31,280
Here we go.

3467
02:31:31,280 --> 02:31:33,280
Nah we don't need a

3468
02:31:33,280 --> 02:31:35,280
topless Ooh La La. It's a video game character.

3469
02:31:35,280 --> 02:31:37,280
Apollo Smiles has already been everywhere topless

3470
02:31:37,280 --> 02:31:39,280
so don't worry about it. Hey come on. I'll put it

3471
02:31:39,280 --> 02:31:41,280
but it's getting taken down.

3472
02:31:43,280 --> 02:31:45,280
Oh Rob.

3473
02:31:45,280 --> 02:31:47,280
I'm already taking down one of yours.

3474
02:31:47,280 --> 02:31:49,280
If I can't have that

3475
02:31:49,280 --> 02:31:51,280
you know

3476
02:31:51,280 --> 02:31:53,280
I'm gonna instead of a game character

3477
02:31:53,280 --> 02:31:55,280
I want a game to be an actual

3478
02:31:55,280 --> 02:31:57,280
the Japanese table flipping game.

3479
02:31:57,280 --> 02:31:59,280
The arcade game.

3480
02:31:59,280 --> 02:32:01,280
It should just be a big table being flipped over.

3481
02:32:01,280 --> 02:32:03,280
Have you played that? It's awesome.

3482
02:32:03,280 --> 02:32:05,280
No I want to play it. It looks awesome.

3483
02:32:05,280 --> 02:32:07,280
That emote icon could just be their new mascot.

3484
02:32:07,280 --> 02:32:09,280
I love Chiggers Forever for saying

3485
02:32:09,280 --> 02:32:11,280
Dame Edna.

3486
02:32:11,280 --> 02:32:13,280
Hello my puppets.

3487
02:32:13,280 --> 02:32:15,280
Have you heard about my blast

3488
02:32:15,280 --> 02:32:17,280
processing?

3489
02:32:17,280 --> 02:32:19,280
That's it.

3490
02:32:19,280 --> 02:32:21,280
I have to redo the

3491
02:32:21,280 --> 02:32:23,280
pandaren meme and have it say

3492
02:32:23,280 --> 02:32:25,280
blast processing.

3493
02:32:25,280 --> 02:32:27,280
Alright. I'm stealing X Defers

3494
02:32:27,280 --> 02:32:29,280
meme. The sad thing is like 98%

3495
02:32:29,280 --> 02:32:31,280
of the audience just isn't gonna understand.

3496
02:32:31,280 --> 02:32:33,280
But for the

3497
02:32:33,280 --> 02:32:35,280
2% that do. You're welcome.

3498
02:32:35,280 --> 02:32:37,280
You know what? I'll do it for us.

3499
02:32:37,280 --> 02:32:39,280
Captain Spike. Your number one answer.

3500
02:32:39,280 --> 02:32:41,280
Well I've done

3501
02:32:41,280 --> 02:32:43,280
one for Rob and I've done one for Dark

3502
02:32:43,280 --> 02:32:45,280
Sakura. So I'm gonna go with Loki in a

3503
02:32:45,280 --> 02:32:47,280
banana hammock with a giant

3504
02:32:47,280 --> 02:32:49,280
purple dildo bat.

3505
02:32:51,280 --> 02:32:53,280
You should've just

3506
02:32:53,280 --> 02:32:55,280
done as Tingle.

3507
02:32:55,280 --> 02:32:57,280
Unfortunately. No no

3508
02:32:57,280 --> 02:32:59,280
Loki you were the one that wanted

3509
02:32:59,280 --> 02:33:01,280
to get past Tingle. So

3510
02:33:01,280 --> 02:33:03,280
Loki in a banana hammock with a purple dildo

3511
02:33:03,280 --> 02:33:05,280
bat is on the list.

3512
02:33:05,280 --> 02:33:07,280
And I can actually cosplay that in

3513
02:33:07,280 --> 02:33:09,280
Saint's Row.

3514
02:33:09,280 --> 02:33:11,280
Alright.

3515
02:33:11,280 --> 02:33:13,280
One more.

3516
02:33:13,280 --> 02:33:15,280
One more here.

3517
02:33:15,280 --> 02:33:17,280
From Tim to add to the list.

3518
02:33:17,280 --> 02:33:19,280
Last chance to get something on the list. Oh wait no I didn't do

3519
02:33:19,280 --> 02:33:21,280
my number one did I? No you didn't. Oh shit.

3520
02:33:21,280 --> 02:33:23,280
Alright then my number one answer.

3521
02:33:23,280 --> 02:33:25,280
My number one answer would be

3522
02:33:25,280 --> 02:33:27,280
now my number one answer is

3523
02:33:27,280 --> 02:33:29,280
inspired by the fact. I don't know if you guys know this. It's been

3524
02:33:29,280 --> 02:33:31,280
San Francisco in the Sega building. They're

3525
02:33:31,280 --> 02:33:33,280
no longer there in the Sega building. You know what company moved

3526
02:33:33,280 --> 02:33:35,280
in in their place?

3527
02:33:35,280 --> 02:33:37,280
Was Zynga. So my

3528
02:33:37,280 --> 02:33:39,280
number one answer or mascot is Zeke

3529
02:33:39,280 --> 02:33:41,280
the Zynga killer. And he's a coyote

3530
02:33:41,280 --> 02:33:43,280
that eats dogs.

3531
02:33:43,280 --> 02:33:45,280
You're a horrible person

3532
02:33:45,280 --> 02:33:47,280
Rob. I approve. Oh he only eats

3533
02:33:47,280 --> 02:33:49,280
Zynga dogs. Don't worry. Okay well then he can eat the

3534
02:33:49,280 --> 02:33:51,280
Zynga dog.

3535
02:33:51,280 --> 02:33:53,280
My number one answer

3536
02:33:53,280 --> 02:33:55,280
is Zeke the Zynga killer. Alright.

3537
02:33:55,280 --> 02:33:57,280
Last but not leastly. Tim

3538
02:33:57,280 --> 02:33:59,280
your number one answer. My

3539
02:33:59,280 --> 02:34:01,280
number one answer is a

3540
02:34:01,280 --> 02:34:03,280
terrifying amalgamation of all of

3541
02:34:03,280 --> 02:34:05,280
Sonic's shitty friends.

3542
02:34:05,280 --> 02:34:07,280
Like

3543
02:34:07,280 --> 02:34:09,280
some

3544
02:34:09,280 --> 02:34:11,280
vaguely Sonic shaped character

3545
02:34:11,280 --> 02:34:13,280
that's pink like the girl

3546
02:34:13,280 --> 02:34:15,280
Amy and has

3547
02:34:15,280 --> 02:34:17,280
Knuckles' hands and

3548
02:34:17,280 --> 02:34:19,280
a gun.

3549
02:34:19,280 --> 02:34:21,280
So it would be the Sonic Gestalt?

3550
02:34:21,280 --> 02:34:23,280
Yeah Sonic Gestalt. Thank you.

3551
02:34:23,280 --> 02:34:25,280
Alright. But it would have to be called SBO

3552
02:34:25,280 --> 02:34:27,280
cause that was the weirdest name. Alright sorry guys

3553
02:34:27,280 --> 02:34:29,280
this is a highly scientific process.

3554
02:34:29,280 --> 02:34:31,280
I'm gonna run down the list but here's some items that didn't

3555
02:34:31,280 --> 02:34:33,280
make the list from chat. I'm really surprised

3556
02:34:33,280 --> 02:34:35,280
with some of these. SJ100Matt the giggling

3557
02:34:35,280 --> 02:34:37,280
lesbians didn't make the list tonight.

3558
02:34:37,280 --> 02:34:39,280
Chigurh said Dame Edna

3559
02:34:39,280 --> 02:34:41,280
which we said.

3560
02:34:41,280 --> 02:34:43,280
Who was talking about the singer from D-Light?

3561
02:34:43,280 --> 02:34:45,280
It was when

3562
02:34:45,280 --> 02:34:47,280
he brought up Ulala.

3563
02:34:47,280 --> 02:34:49,280
The whole lawsuit and everything like that. Lady

3564
02:34:49,280 --> 02:34:51,280
Miss Keira Kirby. Let's

3565
02:34:51,280 --> 02:34:53,280
see. I'd vote for Bootsy Collins.

3566
02:34:53,280 --> 02:34:55,280
Nobody said Ferret. That surprised

3567
02:34:55,280 --> 02:34:57,280
me as well.

3568
02:34:57,280 --> 02:34:59,280
Let's see

3569
02:34:59,280 --> 02:35:01,280
what else did we say? Peep the Peep jouster

3570
02:35:01,280 --> 02:35:03,280
says SJ100Matt. Needs

3571
02:35:03,280 --> 02:35:05,280
more Rappy says Prince Brightstar.

3572
02:35:05,280 --> 02:35:07,280
We didn't name a ferret because

3573
02:35:07,280 --> 02:35:09,280
we respect the ferret too much.

3574
02:35:09,280 --> 02:35:11,280
Alright. But guys

3575
02:35:11,280 --> 02:35:13,280
this list is too big. It's time

3576
02:35:13,280 --> 02:35:15,280
to thin it down a little bit so we have to

3577
02:35:15,280 --> 02:35:17,280
go around the list. Since there's so many

3578
02:35:17,280 --> 02:35:19,280
people please let me know if you got two of your items

3579
02:35:19,280 --> 02:35:21,280
eliminated cause I don't know who said what at this point.

3580
02:35:21,280 --> 02:35:23,280
So let me run down the list and we will start eliminating.

3581
02:35:23,280 --> 02:35:25,280
Here we go. Master System

3582
02:35:25,280 --> 02:35:27,280
the Sega Robot. President

3583
02:35:27,280 --> 02:35:29,280
Cat. Dickey the Pen.

3584
02:35:29,280 --> 02:35:31,280
Rob Robertson a Bjork swan

3585
02:35:31,280 --> 02:35:33,280
dress. A 32X

3586
02:35:33,280 --> 02:35:35,280
with a frowny face.

3587
02:35:35,280 --> 02:35:37,280
Segata Sanshiro the second.

3588
02:35:37,280 --> 02:35:39,280
A forklift. Non-silent

3589
02:35:39,280 --> 02:35:41,280
occupied Caprica. Dark Sakura

3590
02:35:41,280 --> 02:35:43,280
in a sailor suit and a gun.

3591
02:35:43,280 --> 02:35:45,280
All OLR hosts in Bayonetta cosplay.

3592
02:35:45,280 --> 02:35:47,280
Oppa Oppa's Oppai Oppai

3593
02:35:47,280 --> 02:35:49,280
huge boob cousin.

3594
02:35:49,280 --> 02:35:51,280
Table flipping arcade game.

3595
02:35:51,280 --> 02:35:53,280
Loki in a banana hammock with a purple dildo back.

3596
02:35:53,280 --> 02:35:55,280
Zeke the Zynga killer.

3597
02:35:55,280 --> 02:35:57,280
And an amalgamation of all of Sonic's

3598
02:35:57,280 --> 02:35:59,280
shitty friends.

3599
02:35:59,280 --> 02:36:01,280
However this list is too big.

3600
02:36:01,280 --> 02:36:03,280
Dark Sakura. Which of these is not worthy

3601
02:36:03,280 --> 02:36:05,280
of the list? Just because

3602
02:36:05,280 --> 02:36:07,280
it's old and

3603
02:36:07,280 --> 02:36:09,280
played out by non-silent

3604
02:36:09,280 --> 02:36:11,280
occupied Caprica. Non-silent

3605
02:36:11,280 --> 02:36:13,280
occupied Caprica. It has been stricken

3606
02:36:13,280 --> 02:36:15,280
from the list. It might have stayed if it was a bottle of

3607
02:36:15,280 --> 02:36:17,280
Propel. Loki

3608
02:36:17,280 --> 02:36:19,280
which of these is not worthy of the list?

3609
02:36:19,280 --> 02:36:21,280
I don't think anyone wants to see me in a banana hammock

3610
02:36:21,280 --> 02:36:23,280
so...

3611
02:36:23,280 --> 02:36:25,280
I knew that was happening. Loki in a banana

3612
02:36:25,280 --> 02:36:27,280
hammock with a purple dildo back. It has been stricken

3613
02:36:27,280 --> 02:36:29,280
from the list. Spike

3614
02:36:29,280 --> 02:36:31,280
Oh wait no I'll go next. Me

3615
02:36:31,280 --> 02:36:33,280
which one am I going to strike from the list?

3616
02:36:33,280 --> 02:36:35,280
I'm sorry

3617
02:36:35,280 --> 02:36:37,280
Dark Sakura but I'm going to remove

3618
02:36:37,280 --> 02:36:39,280
Segata Sanchiro the 2nd

3619
02:36:39,280 --> 02:36:41,280
because you know what

3620
02:36:41,280 --> 02:36:43,280
a copy of something that's already out there is

3621
02:36:43,280 --> 02:36:45,280
too easy. Oh that's right that would be too much

3622
02:36:45,280 --> 02:36:47,280
awesome for the universe. But then who are they going to

3623
02:36:47,280 --> 02:36:49,280
base Segata 2 off of?

3624
02:36:49,280 --> 02:36:51,280
I know. Why didn't

3625
02:36:51,280 --> 02:36:53,280
we not have... except it would be nothing but bad

3626
02:36:53,280 --> 02:36:55,280
decisions. Hey not my problem. Hey hey

3627
02:36:55,280 --> 02:36:57,280
kids not my problem. It has been

3628
02:36:57,280 --> 02:36:59,280
stricken from the list.

3629
02:36:59,280 --> 02:37:01,280
Spike which of these is not worthy of the list?

3630
02:37:01,280 --> 02:37:03,280
I don't understand Dickey the pen

3631
02:37:03,280 --> 02:37:05,280
and so I don't wish to see it.

3632
02:37:05,280 --> 02:37:07,280
Alright. You know what we should have

3633
02:37:07,280 --> 02:37:09,280
said? We should have said

3634
02:37:09,280 --> 02:37:11,280
crap and now I just

3635
02:37:11,280 --> 02:37:13,280
forgot it. Nevermind. Alright Dickey

3636
02:37:13,280 --> 02:37:15,280
the pen. It has been stricken from the list.

3637
02:37:15,280 --> 02:37:17,280
This means Zeke the Zynga killer

3638
02:37:17,280 --> 02:37:19,280
has immunity. It's my last answer that's there.

3639
02:37:19,280 --> 02:37:21,280
So I think all that's left

3640
02:37:21,280 --> 02:37:23,280
though is Tim. So Tim

3641
02:37:23,280 --> 02:37:25,280
which of these is not worthy of the list?

3642
02:37:25,280 --> 02:37:27,280
Um

3643
02:37:27,280 --> 02:37:29,280
am I allowed to eliminate one of my own?

3644
02:37:29,280 --> 02:37:31,280
Yes you can if you must. 32X with a frowny

3645
02:37:31,280 --> 02:37:33,280
face is super depressing.

3646
02:37:33,280 --> 02:37:35,280
A 32X with a frowny

3647
02:37:35,280 --> 02:37:37,280
face. Tim has decided you know

3648
02:37:37,280 --> 02:37:39,280
what I'm not feeling it anymore.

3649
02:37:39,280 --> 02:37:41,280
I would rather see an amalgamation of all

3650
02:37:41,280 --> 02:37:43,280
sonic shitty friends. So it has

3651
02:37:43,280 --> 02:37:45,280
been stricken from the list. It should have the little

3652
02:37:45,280 --> 02:37:47,280
quote bubble that says kill me.

3653
02:37:47,280 --> 02:37:49,280
I remembered what it is. I remembered what the

3654
02:37:49,280 --> 02:37:51,280
suggestion that we should have done was. What?

3655
02:37:51,280 --> 02:37:53,280
Pepsi man. Oh.

3656
02:37:53,280 --> 02:37:55,280
Pepsi man.

3657
02:37:55,280 --> 02:37:57,280
Alright guys

3658
02:37:57,280 --> 02:37:59,280
that means it is time to

3659
02:37:59,280 --> 02:38:01,280

Here it is. Your choice is tonight. Master

System the Sega Robot. President

3666
02:38:13,280 --> 02:38:15,280
Cat. Rob Roberts in a Bjork

swan dress. That stayed.

3668
02:38:17,280 --> 02:38:19,280
Yes.

02:38:19,280 --> 02:38:21,280
Forklift. Dark Sakura in a

hosts a Bayonetta cosplay.

3672
02:38:25,280 --> 02:38:27,280
That stayed. Yes.

3673
02:38:27,280 --> 02:38:29,280
Hey I can only eliminate one.

3674
02:38:29,280 --> 02:38:31,280

3678
02:38:37,280 --> 02:38:39,280

02:38:39,280 --> 02:38:41,280

And to answer that question I see in

3683
02:38:47,280 --> 02:38:49,280
chat right now from BS JasonXV

3684
02:38:49,280 --> 02:38:51,280
why aren't we using the vognetwork.com

3685
02:38:51,280 --> 02:38:53,280
poll for this? All I'm going to

3686
02:38:53,280 --> 02:38:55,280
say is soon.

3687
02:38:55,280 --> 02:38:57,280
But not tonight.

3688
02:38:57,280 --> 02:38:59,280
Alright so

3689
02:38:59,280 --> 02:39:01,280

3690
02:39:01,280 --> 02:39:03,280
right now. We're going to tally them up and we'll let you know a little

3691
02:39:03,280 --> 02:39:05,280
later in the show. Hey SSJ100 Matt

3692
02:39:05,280 --> 02:39:07,280
I don't think that Konami would want to let go

3693
02:39:07,280 --> 02:39:09,280
of their awesome lie-in to Sega.

3694
02:39:09,280 --> 02:39:11,280
Alright

3695
02:39:11,280 --> 02:39:13,280
while I tally up those votes

3696
02:39:13,280 --> 02:39:15,280
I think we're going to take a- Dude I miss Pepsi man

3697
02:39:15,280 --> 02:39:17,280
those commercials were hilarious.

3698
02:39:17,280 --> 02:39:19,280
Yes. Alright while I tally up those

3699
02:39:19,280 --> 02:39:21,280
votes we're going to take a trip to the mailbag.

3700
02:39:21,280 --> 02:39:23,280
Oh fuck. Every week you guys send us

3701
02:39:23,280 --> 02:39:25,280
emails to mailbag

3702
02:39:25,280 --> 02:39:27,280
at orange lounge radio dot com and Dark

3703
02:39:27,280 --> 02:39:29,280
Sakura respectfully opens up the email bag

3704
02:39:29,280 --> 02:39:31,280
every week and dives in. What the hell is this shit?

3705
02:39:31,280 --> 02:39:33,280
And picks out some of her favorite

3706
02:39:33,280 --> 02:39:35,280
emails to read. It's all

3707
02:39:35,280 --> 02:39:37,280
sticky. At least it's not

3708
02:39:37,280 --> 02:39:39,280
powdery. Dark Sakura what

3709
02:39:39,280 --> 02:39:41,280
emails are you going to read tonight?

3710
02:39:41,280 --> 02:39:43,280
Okay I approve of how this one started. It's

3711
02:39:43,280 --> 02:39:45,280
from Degenerate Johnny. Greetings

3712
02:39:45,280 --> 02:39:47,280
and Salutations. Which I have

3713
02:39:47,280 --> 02:39:49,280
to do the Christian Slater voice from

3714
02:39:49,280 --> 02:39:51,280
Heathers. Greetings

3715
02:39:51,280 --> 02:39:53,280
and Salutations O.L. Army. It's the one

3716
02:39:53,280 --> 02:39:55,280
and only Degenerate Johnny. I wanted to

3717
02:39:55,280 --> 02:39:57,280
email you about last week's show pertaining to the lack

3718
02:39:57,280 --> 02:39:59,280
of strong female lead characters in video games.

3719
02:39:59,280 --> 02:40:01,280
I'm not sure if you've had the chance to

3720
02:40:01,280 --> 02:40:03,280
watch Anita Sarcasians

3721
02:40:03,280 --> 02:40:05,280
I know I pronounced that wrong

3722
02:40:05,280 --> 02:40:07,280
Kickstarter video discussing the

3723
02:40:07,280 --> 02:40:09,280
damsel in distress trope in games. But it

3724
02:40:09,280 --> 02:40:11,280
mentions the same topic. If you have not

3725
02:40:11,280 --> 02:40:13,280
I'm sure someone will post a link in chat.

3726
02:40:13,280 --> 02:40:15,280
While I do agree that feminism

3727
02:40:15,280 --> 02:40:17,280
is moving at a snail's pace

3728
02:40:17,280 --> 02:40:19,280
the lack of diversity is becoming less common

3729
02:40:19,280 --> 02:40:21,280
than it was ten years ago. Today we

3730
02:40:21,280 --> 02:40:23,280
see three dimensional character

3731
02:40:23,280 --> 02:40:25,280
development for both genders of all sexual

3732
02:40:25,280 --> 02:40:27,280
orientations. Such as Toni Prince

3733
02:40:27,280 --> 02:40:29,280
GTA 4, Samantha Trainor and Mass Effect 3.

3734
02:40:29,280 --> 02:40:31,280
We even see strong female

3735
02:40:31,280 --> 02:40:33,280
leads who evolve significantly throughout

3736
02:40:33,280 --> 02:40:35,280
certain game series such as a

3737
02:40:35,280 --> 02:40:37,280
young naive independent summoner who

3738
02:40:37,280 --> 02:40:39,280
learns how to become independent with

3739
02:40:39,280 --> 02:40:41,280
goals of her own. Yes I'm a guy that

3740
02:40:41,280 --> 02:40:43,280
played and actually enjoyed Final Fantasy

3741
02:40:43,280 --> 02:40:45,280
10-2. 10-2 Rob!

3742
02:40:45,280 --> 02:40:47,280
Big whoop. Wanna fight

3743
02:40:47,280 --> 02:40:49,280
about it? No I'm not judging you.

3744
02:40:49,280 --> 02:40:51,280
No hate, no hate. The great thing

3745
02:40:51,280 --> 02:40:53,280
about interactive entertainment is that it promotes

3746
02:40:53,280 --> 02:40:55,280
individualism over traditionalism. Therefore

3747
02:40:55,280 --> 02:40:57,280
the player is free to accept others regardless

3748
02:40:57,280 --> 02:40:59,280
of their race, religion, gender and sexual

3749
02:40:59,280 --> 02:41:01,280
orientation.

3750
02:41:01,280 --> 02:41:03,280
It is unfortunate that we live in a patriarchal

3751
02:41:03,280 --> 02:41:05,280
society but I believe that

3752
02:41:05,280 --> 02:41:07,280
both the feminism

3753
02:41:07,280 --> 02:41:09,280
and homosexual movement will progress

3754
02:41:09,280 --> 02:41:11,280
faster once the traditionalist

3755
02:41:11,280 --> 02:41:13,280
members of the Baby Boomer generation

3756
02:41:13,280 --> 02:41:15,280
retwire, retire

3757
02:41:15,280 --> 02:41:17,280
from the professional world. Although

3758
02:41:17,280 --> 02:41:19,280
I won't be present for tonight's show

3759
02:41:19,280 --> 02:41:21,280
I'm heading a card game tournament.

3760
02:41:21,280 --> 02:41:23,280
Kick their ass. I'm interested

3761
02:41:23,280 --> 02:41:25,280
in hearing your thought on this.

3762
02:41:25,280 --> 02:41:27,280
Congratulations on 502 episodes

3763
02:41:27,280 --> 02:41:29,280
O.L. Army

3764
02:41:29,280 --> 02:41:31,280
Knight Degenerate Johnny.

3765
02:41:31,280 --> 02:41:33,280
You, yeah?

3766
02:41:33,280 --> 02:41:35,280
This

3767
02:41:35,280 --> 02:41:37,280
is the thing about progress.

3768
02:41:37,280 --> 02:41:39,280
When people get it in their head

3769
02:41:39,280 --> 02:41:41,280
that progress needs to happen, it will

3770
02:41:41,280 --> 02:41:43,280
happen.

3771
02:41:43,280 --> 02:41:45,280
Like you said, the old guard's gonna

3772
02:41:45,280 --> 02:41:47,280
die out.

3773
02:41:47,280 --> 02:41:49,280
Any other thoughts?

3774
02:41:49,280 --> 02:41:51,280
I'm gonna admit

3775
02:41:51,280 --> 02:41:53,280
I'm furiously counting votes over here so

3776
02:41:53,280 --> 02:41:55,280
can you summarize real quick for me?

3777
02:41:55,280 --> 02:41:57,280
Basically, there's

3778
02:41:57,280 --> 02:41:59,280
a lot more diversity in video games. We're seeing

3779
02:41:59,280 --> 02:42:01,280
more strong female leads come out

3780
02:42:01,280 --> 02:42:03,280
and that basically the old

3781
02:42:03,280 --> 02:42:05,280
head up their ass

3782
02:42:05,280 --> 02:42:07,280
Baby Boomer traditionalist people are gonna die out.

3783
02:42:07,280 --> 02:42:09,280
Well they're not really playing video games

3784
02:42:09,280 --> 02:42:11,280
anyway. No. But I worry about

3785
02:42:11,280 --> 02:42:13,280
when I see these articles about how people believe

3786
02:42:13,280 --> 02:42:15,280
that strong female leads won't

3787
02:42:15,280 --> 02:42:17,280
sell. That makes me

3788
02:42:17,280 --> 02:42:19,280
sick. Or the statistic that 18% of

3789
02:42:19,280 --> 02:42:21,280
people are playing femshep.

3790
02:42:21,280 --> 02:42:23,280
We think it would be a little closer to 50-50.

3791
02:42:23,280 --> 02:42:25,280
You know what really surprised me

3792
02:42:25,280 --> 02:42:27,280
about that is just about every bit of the

3793
02:42:27,280 --> 02:42:29,280
fandom I've seen has been

3794
02:42:29,280 --> 02:42:31,280
surrounding a female shepherd.

3795
02:42:31,280 --> 02:42:33,280
Maybe once

3796
02:42:33,280 --> 02:42:35,280
or twice we'll see like a

3797
02:42:35,280 --> 02:42:37,280
thicc with a male shepherd or

3798
02:42:37,280 --> 02:42:39,280
fanart of broshep.

3799
02:42:39,280 --> 02:42:41,280
So I'm just saying.

3800
02:42:41,280 --> 02:42:43,280
Alright.

3801
02:42:43,280 --> 02:42:45,280
Okay.

3802
02:42:45,280 --> 02:42:47,280
Someone we haven't heard from in a while, Rob.

3803
02:42:47,280 --> 02:42:49,280
Hi OLR crew.

3804
02:42:49,280 --> 02:42:51,280
My email is directed towards Skye who asked

3805
02:42:51,280 --> 02:42:53,280
a simple question on episode 501.

3806
02:42:53,280 --> 02:42:55,280
What's coming to Playstation Vita?

3807
02:42:55,280 --> 02:42:57,280
The answer to that is found on Reddit where

3808
02:42:57,280 --> 02:42:59,280
users compiled a list of upcoming games

3809
02:42:59,280 --> 02:43:01,280
even those without set release dates. Here's

3810
02:43:01,280 --> 02:43:03,280
the link so you can skim through the list.

3811
02:43:03,280 --> 02:43:05,280
I don't care. I mean.

3812
02:43:05,280 --> 02:43:07,280
Hold on.

3813
02:43:07,280 --> 02:43:09,280
I freaking read it.

3814
02:43:09,280 --> 02:43:11,280
Guacamelee.

3815
02:43:11,280 --> 02:43:13,280
Which I kind of want to play.

3816
02:43:13,280 --> 02:43:15,280
Hold on. It's super good.

3817
02:43:15,280 --> 02:43:17,280
Sorry. Draw Slasher.

3818
02:43:17,280 --> 02:43:19,280
Soulcalibur Broken Destiny.

3819
02:43:19,280 --> 02:43:21,280
Zombie Tycoon 2.

3820
02:43:21,280 --> 02:43:23,280
Velocity Ultra.

3821
02:43:23,280 --> 02:43:25,280
Muramasa Rebirth.

3822
02:43:25,280 --> 02:43:27,280
Jak and Daxter. Dragon's Crown.

3823
02:43:27,280 --> 02:43:29,280
Kill... Dragon's Crown.

3824
02:43:29,280 --> 02:43:31,280
Tearaway. Batman. Arc and Origins.

3825
02:43:31,280 --> 02:43:33,280
Blackgate.

3826
02:43:33,280 --> 02:43:35,280
Final Fantasy X-2 HD.

3827
02:43:35,280 --> 02:43:37,280
Divekick.

3828
02:43:37,280 --> 02:43:39,280
A bunch of Oddworld stuff. Malicious Rebirth.

3829
02:43:39,280 --> 02:43:41,280
There's a bunch of good stuff on this list, but

3830
02:43:41,280 --> 02:43:43,280
I still don't think that... Ooh! There's an

3831
02:43:43,280 --> 02:43:45,280
Ys game on here too.

3832
02:43:45,280 --> 02:43:47,280
But I don't know

3833
02:43:47,280 --> 02:43:49,280
that it's going to be enough to really save it unless

3834
02:43:49,280 --> 02:43:51,280
they can

3835
02:43:51,280 --> 02:43:53,280
pull a miracle out of their ass.

3836
02:43:53,280 --> 02:43:55,280
Also, Skye, you have dabbled

3837
02:43:55,280 --> 02:43:57,280
with games from your...

3838
02:43:57,280 --> 02:43:59,280
Have you dabbled with games from your PlayStation Plus

3839
02:43:59,280 --> 02:44:01,280
collection? It seems a little unusual that you

3840
02:44:01,280 --> 02:44:03,280
haven't brought up games from Plus

3841
02:44:03,280 --> 02:44:05,280
that you haven't tried out before in

3842
02:44:05,280 --> 02:44:07,280
the How Was Your Gaming Week segments. I'm interested

3843
02:44:07,280 --> 02:44:09,280
to hear what you have to say on games like Disgaea

3844
02:44:09,280 --> 02:44:11,280
3, The Cave, Closure, and others. I did

3845
02:44:11,280 --> 02:44:13,280
buy Closure. Funny enough,

3846
02:44:13,280 --> 02:44:15,280
I have The Cave sitting on my PlayStation 3

3847
02:44:15,280 --> 02:44:17,280
ready to play. I just didn't get to it this week.

3848
02:44:17,280 --> 02:44:19,280
Because I had that other game to review.

3849
02:44:19,280 --> 02:44:21,280
Yes, I have been trying to grab some of them.

3850
02:44:21,280 --> 02:44:23,280
The Cave, specifically. I was

3851
02:44:23,280 --> 02:44:25,280
curious in checking out, so

3852
02:44:25,280 --> 02:44:27,280
hopefully next week. I did get

3853
02:44:27,280 --> 02:44:29,280
Closure, by the way, on Steam. I just haven't

3854
02:44:29,280 --> 02:44:31,280
played it yet. So many games,

3855
02:44:31,280 --> 02:44:33,280
so little time. But thank you for the

3856
02:44:33,280 --> 02:44:35,280
feedback on the Vita.

3857
02:44:35,280 --> 02:44:37,280
And we'll see what comes

3858
02:44:37,280 --> 02:44:39,280
at E3. I'm sure it's going to be a huge

3859
02:44:39,280 --> 02:44:41,280
thing as well. Okay, the end of this email.

3860
02:44:41,280 --> 02:44:43,280
I want some Pinkberry, the Nasty

3861
02:44:43,280 --> 02:44:45,280
Canasta. Who doesn't? I want some

3862
02:44:45,280 --> 02:44:47,280
Pinkberry. Okay,

3863
02:44:47,280 --> 02:44:49,280
this one's kind of long. Hello

3864
02:44:49,280 --> 02:44:51,280
OLR.

3865
02:44:51,280 --> 02:44:53,280
So, sorry, by the way, guys,

3866
02:44:53,280 --> 02:44:55,280
if I sound awful, I had an allergic

3867
02:44:55,280 --> 02:44:57,280
reaction earlier.

3868
02:44:57,280 --> 02:44:59,280
I got me a Wii U a couple weeks ago.

3869
02:44:59,280 --> 02:45:01,280
Basic set. I have been having

3870
02:45:01,280 --> 02:45:03,280
a somewhat good time with it. I'm already,

3871
02:45:03,280 --> 02:45:05,280
I've already,

3872
02:45:05,280 --> 02:45:07,280
I guess that should be got four games.

3873
02:45:07,280 --> 02:45:09,280
Super Mario Bros. U, Monster Hunter 3

3874
02:45:09,280 --> 02:45:11,280
Ultimate, Scribblenauts Unlimited, and

3875
02:45:11,280 --> 02:45:13,280
Justice Gods Among Us. Fun system that the

3876
02:45:13,280 --> 02:45:15,280
touchpad is taking a lot more

3877
02:45:15,280 --> 02:45:17,280
getting used to. I'll probably not

3878
02:45:17,280 --> 02:45:19,280
have, not be buying a lot of

3879
02:45:19,280 --> 02:45:21,280
non-exclusive games on the platform unless they've got

3880
02:45:21,280 --> 02:45:23,280
pro controller or classic controller support.

3881
02:45:23,280 --> 02:45:25,280
But it's proving to

3882
02:45:25,280 --> 02:45:27,280
be not the embarrassing waste of time

3883
02:45:27,280 --> 02:45:29,280
I thought it would be when the system came out.

3884
02:45:29,280 --> 02:45:31,280
I'm hoping and fully expecting the system

3885
02:45:31,280 --> 02:45:33,280
to become a worthwhile addition to the collection.

3886
02:45:33,280 --> 02:45:35,280
Speaking of, it seems that

3887
02:45:35,280 --> 02:45:37,280
Nintendo bullying out of the huge

3888
02:45:37,280 --> 02:45:39,280
dick-waving contest that is

3889
02:45:39,280 --> 02:45:41,280
the mega press conference. Oh,

3890
02:45:41,280 --> 02:45:43,280
bowing out, sorry.

3891
02:45:43,280 --> 02:45:45,280
Yeah, we covered that earlier.

3892
02:45:45,280 --> 02:45:47,280
Personally, I love the idea that Nintendo is ditching the traditional

3893
02:45:47,280 --> 02:45:49,280
conference this year in favor of targeted meetings.

3894
02:45:49,280 --> 02:45:51,280
The fewer charts I have to look at, the better.

3895
02:45:51,280 --> 02:45:53,280
However, it's sad that the gaming

3896
02:45:53,280 --> 02:45:55,280
media is quick to bash on Nintendo.

3897
02:45:55,280 --> 02:45:57,280
Not that I'm a huge Nintendo fanboy, but

3898
02:45:57,280 --> 02:45:59,280
I was always under the impression that we

3899
02:45:59,280 --> 02:46:01,280
won the games.

3900
02:46:01,280 --> 02:46:03,280
Sorry.

3901
02:46:03,280 --> 02:46:05,280
How much of it do you guys

3902
02:46:05,280 --> 02:46:07,280
feel it's just the people wanting to

3903
02:46:07,280 --> 02:46:09,280
shit on Nintendo because they're not the graphics

3904
02:46:09,280 --> 02:46:11,280
horror choice versus legitimate concerns about

3905
02:46:11,280 --> 02:46:13,280
the company? I think there's

3906
02:46:13,280 --> 02:46:15,280
a lot of bandwagon bashing, but

3907
02:46:15,280 --> 02:46:17,280
I

3908
02:46:17,280 --> 02:46:19,280
my thing with press conferences or release

3909
02:46:19,280 --> 02:46:21,280
of information, I don't give a shit how they

3910
02:46:21,280 --> 02:46:23,280
do it as long as they do something

3911
02:46:23,280 --> 02:46:25,280
and we find out what it is. I only care about the information.

3912
02:46:25,280 --> 02:46:27,280
I don't care how they put it out.

3913
02:46:27,280 --> 02:46:29,280
I just care that they do.

3914
02:46:29,280 --> 02:46:31,280
That's me.

3915
02:46:31,280 --> 02:46:33,280
I understand that in this cost-conscious

3916
02:46:33,280 --> 02:46:35,280
world we're living in, especially for

3917
02:46:35,280 --> 02:46:37,280
a company that hasn't necessarily been meeting

3918
02:46:37,280 --> 02:46:39,280
their goals, they want to scale

3919
02:46:39,280 --> 02:46:41,280
back on some of the pomp and circumstance,

3920
02:46:41,280 --> 02:46:43,280
especially when they always seem to get shit on for it.

3921
02:46:43,280 --> 02:46:45,280
So, you know,

3922
02:46:45,280 --> 02:46:47,280
why not change the game

3923
02:46:47,280 --> 02:46:49,280
at this point if you're them?

3924
02:46:49,280 --> 02:46:51,280
Anyway.

3925
02:46:51,280 --> 02:46:53,280
Back to the

3926
02:46:53,280 --> 02:46:55,280
I need to actually

3927
02:46:55,280 --> 02:46:57,280
pick this instead of email.

3928
02:46:57,280 --> 02:46:59,280
Lastly, my next

3929
02:46:59,280 --> 02:47:01,280
hardware purchase is coming around July

3930
02:47:01,280 --> 02:47:03,280
and that is the Retron 5.

3931
02:47:03,280 --> 02:47:05,280
I'm not sure about your thoughts on clone consoles,

3932
02:47:05,280 --> 02:47:07,280
but it sounds like they're going all out to ensure

3933
02:47:07,280 --> 02:47:09,280
maximum compatibility

3934
02:47:09,280 --> 02:47:11,280
and the 720p

3935
02:47:11,280 --> 02:47:13,280
upscaling, save states, and full button

3936
02:47:13,280 --> 02:47:15,280
customization for any controller you use on the thing.

3937
02:47:15,280 --> 02:47:17,280
That brings me to the question,

3938
02:47:17,280 --> 02:47:19,280
where do you guys stand on retro gaming?

3939
02:47:19,280 --> 02:47:21,280
Do you want all the modern

3940
02:47:21,280 --> 02:47:23,280
accoutrements that are offered by emulators

3941
02:47:23,280 --> 02:47:25,280
and will be offered by the Retron 5,

3942
02:47:25,280 --> 02:47:27,280
or are you guys intolerant of any deviation

3943
02:47:27,280 --> 02:47:29,280
from the original play limitations?

3944
02:47:29,280 --> 02:47:31,280
Me, I can go either way, though with

3945
02:47:31,280 --> 02:47:33,280
five cartridge ports, this thing is going to be

3946
02:47:33,280 --> 02:47:35,280
a sight more convenient than having my NES, NES,

3947
02:47:35,280 --> 02:47:37,280
Genesis all at once, and if only they can add in

3948
02:47:37,280 --> 02:47:39,280
support for Turbo Duo and Sega CD.

3949
02:47:39,280 --> 02:47:41,280
Anyway, that's it for the email. Thanks for reading.

3950
02:47:42,280 --> 02:47:44,280
This is my thought about it,

3951
02:47:44,280 --> 02:47:46,280
because given that I am in a position of both,

3952
02:47:46,280 --> 02:47:48,280
you did not put in the

3953
02:47:48,280 --> 02:47:50,280
do not give a shit category,

3954
02:47:50,280 --> 02:47:52,280
because it all depends on my mood.

3955
02:47:52,280 --> 02:47:54,280
It depends on how much I feel

3956
02:47:54,280 --> 02:47:56,280
like digging through boxes

3957
02:47:56,280 --> 02:47:58,280
to pull out one of the

3958
02:47:58,280 --> 02:48:00,280
Super Nintendos and plug it in

3959
02:48:00,280 --> 02:48:02,280
and then where to find our copy of

3960
02:48:02,280 --> 02:48:04,280
Chrono Trigger or Super Metroid

3961
02:48:04,280 --> 02:48:06,280
or, you know,

3962
02:48:06,280 --> 02:48:08,280
I prefer to play things

3963
02:48:08,280 --> 02:48:10,280
on the original console.

3964
02:48:10,280 --> 02:48:13,280
If I had the perfect vault,

3965
02:48:13,280 --> 02:48:15,280
if we had everything hooked back up again,

3966
02:48:15,280 --> 02:48:17,280
switch boxes and everything,

3967
02:48:17,280 --> 02:48:19,280
yeah, I would be totally playing it

3968
02:48:19,280 --> 02:48:21,280
on the original console,

3969
02:48:21,280 --> 02:48:23,280
because I can safely say I likely have

3970
02:48:23,280 --> 02:48:25,280
the original console.

3971
02:48:25,280 --> 02:48:27,280
But, if it's a quick thing,

3972
02:48:27,280 --> 02:48:29,280
or I want to play like a

3973
02:48:29,280 --> 02:48:31,280
Sega Densetsu 3, and there's an amazing

3974
02:48:31,280 --> 02:48:33,280
fan translation out, but I don't have a ROM

3975
02:48:33,280 --> 02:48:35,280
burner, then I'll play the emulator.

3976
02:48:35,280 --> 02:48:37,280
I'm not really picky.

3977
02:48:37,280 --> 02:48:39,280
If it's the only way I have to play it,

3978
02:48:40,280 --> 02:48:42,280
You have multiple Super Nintendos?

3979
02:48:42,280 --> 02:48:44,280
Do you not?

3980
02:48:44,280 --> 02:48:46,280
I still have none.

3981
02:48:46,280 --> 02:48:48,280
It's a shame that's carried out through my

3982
02:48:48,280 --> 02:48:50,280
adult life.

3983
02:48:50,280 --> 02:48:52,280
There's one over there in our house, too.

3984
02:48:52,280 --> 02:48:54,280
I saw it, and I was jealous.

3985
02:48:54,280 --> 02:48:56,280
No, we actually just bought

3986
02:48:56,280 --> 02:48:58,280
I think our fourth Super Nintendo,

3987
02:48:58,280 --> 02:49:00,280
or fourth or fifth,

3988
02:49:00,280 --> 02:49:02,280
because we found a box of games

3989
02:49:02,280 --> 02:49:04,280
and a SNES for 50 bucks

3990
02:49:04,280 --> 02:49:06,280
at Goodwill, and one of the games in there

3991
02:49:06,280 --> 02:49:08,280
was Pocky and Rocky 2,

3992
02:49:08,280 --> 02:49:10,280
which was unboxed

3993
02:49:10,280 --> 02:49:12,280
for about 150 bucks on eBay.

3994
02:49:12,280 --> 02:49:14,280
We're going to be selling it.

3995
02:49:14,280 --> 02:49:16,280
That's like that chick that found the

3996
02:49:16,280 --> 02:49:18,280
copy of Stadium Events at a thrift store

3997
02:49:18,280 --> 02:49:20,280
and she's making bank off it.

3998
02:49:20,280 --> 02:49:22,280
Just the whole reason is that

3999
02:49:22,280 --> 02:49:24,280
as much as we love the game, it's not going to be

4000
02:49:24,280 --> 02:49:26,280
one that we're going to play a lot.

4001
02:49:26,280 --> 02:49:28,280
If we're looking at the collection,

4002
02:49:28,280 --> 02:49:30,280
I'm almost always going to grab the Turbo Duo and play

4003
02:49:30,280 --> 02:49:32,280
Dracula X.

4004
02:49:32,280 --> 02:49:34,280
Which is the correct choice to make.

4005
02:49:34,280 --> 02:49:36,280
You know what I wish they would translate?

4006
02:49:36,280 --> 02:49:38,280
And like, Re-Burn on a CD is

4007
02:49:38,280 --> 02:49:40,280
well, Sapphire was a great game,

4008
02:49:40,280 --> 02:49:42,280
but Emerald Dragon

4009
02:49:42,280 --> 02:49:44,280
was an RPG

4010
02:49:44,280 --> 02:49:46,280
that came out on

4011
02:49:46,280 --> 02:49:48,280
PC Engine Duo.

4012
02:49:48,280 --> 02:49:50,280
You just named a game I've never played!

4013
02:49:50,280 --> 02:49:52,280
Holy shit!

4014
02:49:52,280 --> 02:49:54,280
Well, I've also played Panorama Cotton.

4015
02:49:54,280 --> 02:49:56,280
Okay, yeah, but I mean,

4016
02:49:56,280 --> 02:49:58,280
I don't unfortunately own a copy, but I have played it.

4017
02:49:58,280 --> 02:50:00,280
One of my friends that for a little while

4018
02:50:00,280 --> 02:50:02,280
worked for Ubisoft in Japan owns a copy.

4019
02:50:02,280 --> 02:50:04,280
She wouldn't lend it to me.

4020
02:50:04,280 --> 02:50:06,280
You're going to Japan? Let me borrow it!

4021
02:50:06,280 --> 02:50:08,280
Let me say this quickly about

4022
02:50:08,280 --> 02:50:10,280
the back to the email with the emulators and all that.

4023
02:50:10,280 --> 02:50:12,280
I really do like

4024
02:50:12,280 --> 02:50:14,280
the retro gaming

4025
02:50:14,280 --> 02:50:16,280
when it's done right.

4026
02:50:16,280 --> 02:50:18,280
Sometimes they're cheap cash-ins and you can tell.

4027
02:50:18,280 --> 02:50:20,280
I kind of wish companies in this day and age

4028
02:50:20,280 --> 02:50:22,280
would do more, especially because

4029
02:50:22,280 --> 02:50:24,280
we've shifted from

4030
02:50:24,280 --> 02:50:26,280
sitting next to each other in the same room

4031
02:50:26,280 --> 02:50:28,280
to a lot of internet play.

4032
02:50:28,280 --> 02:50:30,280
I've bitched about this on the show before.

4033
02:50:30,280 --> 02:50:32,280
Virtual Console would be ten times

4034
02:50:32,280 --> 02:50:34,280
better and more people would feel the enhanced

4035
02:50:34,280 --> 02:50:36,280
value if you could play it online.

4036
02:50:36,280 --> 02:50:38,280
If you could use that cam in your Wii U

4037
02:50:38,280 --> 02:50:40,280
optionally, to see your friend

4038
02:50:40,280 --> 02:50:42,280
while you're screwing him over in Ice Climber

4039
02:50:42,280 --> 02:50:44,280
or whatever it is you're playing.

4040
02:50:44,280 --> 02:50:46,280
Or a better game.

4041
02:50:46,280 --> 02:50:48,280
Like the Capcom Arcade

4042
02:50:48,280 --> 02:50:50,280
Cabinet Collection is actually pretty good,

4043
02:50:50,280 --> 02:50:52,280
because you can do the internet and all that.

4044
02:50:52,280 --> 02:50:54,280
I think the interface could be a heck of a lot better.

4045
02:50:54,280 --> 02:50:56,280
I really liked Game Room.

4046
02:50:56,280 --> 02:50:58,280
I really...

4047
02:50:58,280 --> 02:51:00,280
I loved Game Room.

4048
02:51:00,280 --> 02:51:02,280
It gave them that more time and nurtured it

4049
02:51:02,280 --> 02:51:04,280
just a little more.

4050
02:51:04,280 --> 02:51:06,280
I feel like Game Room could have been it.

4051
02:51:06,280 --> 02:51:08,280
And I'm really disappointed that they pulled the plug

4052
02:51:08,280 --> 02:51:10,280
as fast as they did on that.

4053
02:51:10,280 --> 02:51:12,280
I mean, maybe it just wasn't gaining the support.

4054
02:51:12,280 --> 02:51:14,280
I don't know, but maybe they just needed better games.

4055
02:51:14,280 --> 02:51:16,280
Some of the games they put out at the end

4056
02:51:16,280 --> 02:51:18,280
should have been out in the beginning.

4057
02:51:18,280 --> 02:51:20,280
Which they never did put out officially.

4058
02:51:20,280 --> 02:51:22,280
But if they've been sitting on Sunset Riders

4059
02:51:22,280 --> 02:51:24,280
the whole time, why didn't they put that out in the beginning

4060
02:51:24,280 --> 02:51:26,280
instead of some of the...

4061
02:51:26,280 --> 02:51:28,280
not that the 2600 games are bad, don't get me wrong.

4062
02:51:28,280 --> 02:51:30,280
It was really disappointing.

4063
02:51:30,280 --> 02:51:32,280
But, you know, like Virtual Console on 3DS

4064
02:51:32,280 --> 02:51:34,280
pretty rad that we can fire up

4065
02:51:34,280 --> 02:51:36,280
a two-player game.

4066
02:51:36,280 --> 02:51:38,280
Again, I'm going to use Ice Climber as an example.

4067
02:51:38,280 --> 02:51:40,280
But, you know, we can do that anywhere.

4068
02:51:40,280 --> 02:51:42,280
We could sit in the car and play

4069
02:51:42,280 --> 02:51:44,280
Ice Climber on 3DS.

4070
02:51:44,280 --> 02:51:46,280
Excuse me, versus,

4071
02:51:46,280 --> 02:51:48,280
thanks to Virtual Console.

4072
02:51:48,280 --> 02:51:50,280
I love that.

4073
02:51:50,280 --> 02:51:52,280
I would like to just see that pushed forward

4074
02:51:52,280 --> 02:51:54,280
a little faster, because the technology is

4075
02:51:54,280 --> 02:51:56,280
there to get it online and all that.

4076
02:51:56,280 --> 02:51:58,280
Anyhow, that's my thoughts.

4077
02:51:58,280 --> 02:52:00,280
We have another email.

4078
02:52:00,280 --> 02:52:02,280
Alright.

4079
02:52:02,280 --> 02:52:04,280
That was from RawStillUT.

4080
02:52:04,280 --> 02:52:06,280
The last email.

4081
02:52:06,280 --> 02:52:08,280
Howdy, y'all!

4082
02:52:08,280 --> 02:52:10,280
Howdy, y'all!

4083
02:52:10,280 --> 02:52:12,280
Howdy.

4084
02:52:12,280 --> 02:52:14,280
I was poking around in the Boston Red Sox

4085
02:52:14,280 --> 02:52:16,280
official store today and marveled at all the shit

4086
02:52:16,280 --> 02:52:18,280
you can buy there. Seriously, look it up.

4087
02:52:18,280 --> 02:52:20,280
There's an astounding variety of items

4088
02:52:20,280 --> 02:52:22,280
with the Boston Red Sox logo on it that you can waste

4089
02:52:22,280 --> 02:52:24,280
your money on.

4090
02:52:24,280 --> 02:52:26,280
Is there an equivalent store for WOW memorabilia?

4091
02:52:26,280 --> 02:52:28,280
eBay.

4092
02:52:28,280 --> 02:52:30,280
Is there a place online where I can

4093
02:52:30,280 --> 02:52:32,280
blow my money on a wide variety of WOW shit?

4094
02:52:32,280 --> 02:52:34,280
I mean, a sticker with your

4095
02:52:34,280 --> 02:52:36,280
flying mount on it is a no-brainer to me.

4096
02:52:36,280 --> 02:52:38,280
That thing you use

4097
02:52:38,280 --> 02:52:40,280
to get around in real life on the thing you use

4098
02:52:40,280 --> 02:52:42,280
to get around in the real world?

4099
02:52:42,280 --> 02:52:44,280
That would be awesome.

4100
02:52:44,280 --> 02:52:46,280
Stay black, redertainment trainer.

4101
02:52:48,280 --> 02:52:50,280
You know...

4102
02:52:50,280 --> 02:52:52,280
There's the Jinx store.

4103
02:52:52,280 --> 02:52:54,280
I think Geek has a lot of WOW stuff.

4104
02:52:54,280 --> 02:52:56,280
Yeah.

4105
02:52:56,280 --> 02:52:58,280
I don't know if there's a

4106
02:52:58,280 --> 02:53:00,280
Blizzard company store.

4107
02:53:00,280 --> 02:53:02,280
Jinx is kind of like one of their official

4108
02:53:02,280 --> 02:53:04,280
vendors.

4109
02:53:04,280 --> 02:53:06,280
They do a lot of that stuff.

4110
02:53:06,280 --> 02:53:08,280
They're always at BlizzCon.

4111
02:53:08,280 --> 02:53:10,280
That's like JYNX, right?

4112
02:53:10,280 --> 02:53:12,280
I believe so.

4113
02:53:12,280 --> 02:53:14,280
Like the drag queen?

4114
02:53:14,280 --> 02:53:16,280
Yeah, or like the Pokemon drag queen.

4115
02:53:16,280 --> 02:53:18,280
I was going to say too

4116
02:53:18,280 --> 02:53:20,280
that I think if you look on Etsy

4117
02:53:20,280 --> 02:53:22,280
there's a lot of fan-made

4118
02:53:22,280 --> 02:53:24,280
items that are really good.

4119
02:53:24,280 --> 02:53:26,280
And I know

4120
02:53:26,280 --> 02:53:28,280
that there are people

4121
02:53:28,280 --> 02:53:30,280
out there who will...

4122
02:53:30,280 --> 02:53:32,280
There's artists out there who will do commissioned

4123
02:53:32,280 --> 02:53:34,280
work of your character and your mount.

4124
02:53:34,280 --> 02:53:36,280
And she's talking to you right now.

4125
02:53:36,280 --> 02:53:38,280
But

4126
02:53:38,280 --> 02:53:40,280
it's possible. You can even make this stuff yourself.

4127
02:53:40,280 --> 02:53:42,280
It's not that hard.

4128
02:53:42,280 --> 02:53:44,280
There's a program that I was doing

4129
02:53:44,280 --> 02:53:46,280
a WOW comic in for a while.

4130
02:53:46,280 --> 02:53:48,280
It was like the World of Warcraft viewer.

4131
02:53:48,280 --> 02:53:50,280
Where it has all the mounts.

4132
02:53:50,280 --> 02:53:52,280
It has hidden stuff.

4133
02:53:52,280 --> 02:53:54,280
It has...

4134
02:53:54,280 --> 02:53:56,280
Oh, fuck what's dude's name at Icecrown.

4135
02:53:56,280 --> 02:53:58,280
Lich King?

4136
02:53:58,280 --> 02:54:00,280
The current Lich King.

4137
02:54:00,280 --> 02:54:02,280
Arthas? Or Bolvar?

4138
02:54:02,280 --> 02:54:04,280
Yeah. There's actually

4139
02:54:04,280 --> 02:54:06,280
a picture of him on fire.

4140
02:54:06,280 --> 02:54:08,280
Not standing on the throne.

4141
02:54:08,280 --> 02:54:10,280
He's just standing there on fire.

4142
02:54:10,280 --> 02:54:12,280
And he's called Lavaman.

4143
02:54:12,280 --> 02:54:14,280
You can have him.

4144
02:54:14,280 --> 02:54:16,280
You can have old, actual Warcraft things.

4145
02:54:16,280 --> 02:54:18,280
And the ability to make the stickers.

4146
02:54:18,280 --> 02:54:20,280
I was also going to suggest, honestly,

4147
02:54:20,280 --> 02:54:22,280
if your mall has a hot topic,

4148
02:54:22,280 --> 02:54:24,280
well, I see Warcraft shirts in there all the time.

4149
02:54:24,280 --> 02:54:26,280
But if you're wanting

4150
02:54:26,280 --> 02:54:28,280
props and things

4151
02:54:28,280 --> 02:54:30,280
or stuff to put on your wall,

4152
02:54:30,280 --> 02:54:32,280
check with cosplay

4153
02:54:32,280 --> 02:54:34,280
distributors.

4154
02:54:34,280 --> 02:54:36,280
Because you can get stuff there too.

4155
02:54:36,280 --> 02:54:38,280
I know people who make weapons.

4156
02:54:38,280 --> 02:54:40,280
Find a friend with a 3D printer and learn a CAD software.

4157
02:54:40,280 --> 02:54:42,280
Or what's that printer

4158
02:54:42,280 --> 02:54:44,280
that you've... It's like a couple grand

4159
02:54:44,280 --> 02:54:46,280
home 3D printer.

4160
02:54:46,280 --> 02:54:48,280
MakerBot? Yeah, MakerBot.

4161
02:54:48,280 --> 02:54:50,280
I think people have done

4162
02:54:50,280 --> 02:54:52,280
insignias and things for MakerBot.

4163
02:54:52,280 --> 02:54:54,280
You can also buy a monthly membership

4164
02:54:54,280 --> 02:54:56,280
to TechShop and use their fancy ones.

4165
02:54:56,280 --> 02:54:58,280
I think that, actually, the school I go to now

4166
02:54:58,280 --> 02:55:00,280
is going to be getting a 3D printer

4167
02:55:00,280 --> 02:55:02,280
in the next couple years.

4168
02:55:02,280 --> 02:55:04,280
For the art design lab.

4169
02:55:04,280 --> 02:55:06,280
Alright.

4170
02:55:06,280 --> 02:55:08,280
If that's it for the emails tonight.

4171
02:55:08,280 --> 02:55:10,280
Yes, indeed it is.

4172
02:55:10,280 --> 02:55:12,280
Let's go to the FUs of the week.

4173
02:55:12,280 --> 02:55:14,280
It's a chance for us to be angsty.

4174
02:55:14,280 --> 02:55:16,280
Because, you know, for

4175
02:55:16,280 --> 02:55:18,280
502 weeks now we've been carrying a little angst

4176
02:55:18,280 --> 02:55:20,280
on this show.

4177
02:55:34,280 --> 02:55:36,280
My FU goes to the pizza, actually.

4178
02:55:36,280 --> 02:55:38,280
To Papa Murphy's Pizza in general.

4179
02:55:38,280 --> 02:55:40,280
Because this is actually the third time

4180
02:55:40,280 --> 02:55:42,280
I've had an allergic reaction to Papa Murphy's Pizza.

4181
02:55:42,280 --> 02:55:44,280
And it's been a different kind of pizza

4182
02:55:44,280 --> 02:55:46,280
every time.

4183
02:55:46,280 --> 02:55:48,280
And, like, I'm talking about my tongue started to

4184
02:55:48,280 --> 02:55:50,280
swell, my throat itched.

4185
02:55:50,280 --> 02:55:52,280
I'm so sorry because it's so good.

4186
02:55:52,280 --> 02:55:54,280
I'm not complaining about how delicious

4187
02:55:54,280 --> 02:55:56,280
the pizza was, but

4188
02:55:56,280 --> 02:55:58,280
I was sitting here having... By the way, thank you for that.

4189
02:55:58,280 --> 02:56:00,280
I was sitting here, like,

4190
02:56:00,280 --> 02:56:02,280
literally having one of those,

4191
02:56:02,280 --> 02:56:04,280
like, weird

4192
02:56:04,280 --> 02:56:06,280
allergic reactions with the rash and everything.

4193
02:56:06,280 --> 02:56:08,280
And I'm like, oh my god. Well, thank god

4194
02:56:08,280 --> 02:56:10,280
Tim brings us drugs.

4195
02:56:10,280 --> 02:56:12,280
You're welcome.

4196
02:56:12,280 --> 02:56:14,280
But, I mean...

4197
02:56:14,280 --> 02:56:16,280
This is the third time

4198
02:56:16,280 --> 02:56:18,280
I've had pizza from Papa Murphy's in Reactiswood.

4199
02:56:18,280 --> 02:56:20,280
So, I don't think I'll be eating

4200
02:56:20,280 --> 02:56:22,280
here again.

4201
02:56:22,280 --> 02:56:24,280
Lucky.

4202
02:56:24,280 --> 02:56:26,280
Lucky, United States Postal Service for just

4203
02:56:26,280 --> 02:56:28,280
chilling on my package.

4204
02:56:28,280 --> 02:56:30,280
Instead of just, you know...

4205
02:56:30,280 --> 02:56:32,280
Usually that's what you want people to do.

4206
02:56:32,280 --> 02:56:34,280
No, you don't want them to

4207
02:56:34,280 --> 02:56:36,280
chill. You want them to fucking move around.

4208
02:56:36,280 --> 02:56:38,280
You want them to be

4209
02:56:38,280 --> 02:56:40,280
getting close to, you know,

4210
02:56:40,280 --> 02:56:42,280
delivering the package.

4211
02:56:44,280 --> 02:56:46,280
And said no.

4212
02:56:46,280 --> 02:56:48,280
They're just like...

4213
02:56:48,280 --> 02:56:50,280
You want them to make that delivery.

4214
02:56:50,280 --> 02:56:52,280
Exactly. Make the delivery.

4215
02:56:52,280 --> 02:56:54,280
Get moving!

4216
02:56:56,280 --> 02:56:58,280
I want my... Ooh, yeah!

4217
02:57:02,280 --> 02:57:04,280
FU did the crappy heat

4218
02:57:04,280 --> 02:57:06,280
here in Sacramento today.

4219
02:57:06,280 --> 02:57:08,280
Because I wanted to take my friends to the flea market.

4220
02:57:08,280 --> 02:57:10,280
But it was just too hot.

4221
02:57:10,280 --> 02:57:12,280
We'll go bargain hunting for

4222
02:57:12,280 --> 02:57:14,280
video games in October.

4223
02:57:14,280 --> 02:57:16,280
Exactly. With those two

4224
02:57:16,280 --> 02:57:18,280
Sega prototype systems.

4225
02:57:18,280 --> 02:57:20,280
They're going for like multi grand

4226
02:57:20,280 --> 02:57:22,280
on eBay. Bought for a dollar.

4227
02:57:22,280 --> 02:57:24,280
Yeah, I know, right?

4228
02:57:24,280 --> 02:57:26,280
Didn't they actually close down Auction Town?

4229
02:57:26,280 --> 02:57:28,280
Because that's where Trader Dan's was.

4230
02:57:28,280 --> 02:57:30,280
So, you're going to have a really hard time

4231
02:57:30,280 --> 02:57:32,280
finding the good game sales at the flea market.

4232
02:57:32,280 --> 02:57:34,280
I hope some of the flea market is still out.

4233
02:57:34,280 --> 02:57:36,280
I bet Trader Dan

4234
02:57:36,280 --> 02:57:38,280
started back up on eBay, though.

4235
02:57:38,280 --> 02:57:40,280
I would bet.

4236
02:57:40,280 --> 02:57:42,280
CaptainSpike, do you have any FUs of the week?

4237
02:57:44,280 --> 02:57:46,280
Tim, for

4238
02:57:46,280 --> 02:57:48,280
preferring Super Mario Bros. 3

4239
02:57:48,280 --> 02:57:50,280
to Super Mario World, and

4240
02:57:50,280 --> 02:57:52,280
RageQuitting on me when we played Super Mario World.

4241
02:57:52,280 --> 02:57:54,280
And you for making me play

4242
02:57:54,280 --> 02:57:56,280
Ice Climber.

4243
02:57:56,280 --> 02:57:58,280
Deal with it.

4244
02:57:58,280 --> 02:58:00,280
Alright, Tim,

4245
02:58:00,280 --> 02:58:02,280
do you have any FUs of the week?

4246
02:58:02,280 --> 02:58:04,280
I do. It was a related note.

4247
02:58:04,280 --> 02:58:06,280
Fuck you, Magikoopa.

4248
02:58:06,280 --> 02:58:08,280
I am done with your shit.

4249
02:58:08,280 --> 02:58:10,280
Fair enough.

4250
02:58:10,280 --> 02:58:12,280
Alright.

4251
02:58:12,280 --> 02:58:14,280
Let us

4252
02:58:14,280 --> 02:58:16,280
do a couple more stories

4253
02:58:16,280 --> 02:58:18,280
then we're going to open up the Skypline for a little bit.

4254
02:58:18,280 --> 02:58:20,280
We are running super long tonight, though.

4255
02:58:20,280 --> 02:58:22,280
So, I'm sorry. I might have to abbreviate

4256
02:58:22,280 --> 02:58:24,280
some of the end of the show here.

4257
02:58:24,280 --> 02:58:26,280
Let's at least get these new stories out of the way. Low key.

4258
02:58:26,280 --> 02:58:28,280
Okay, so the second round of auctions for THQ happened.

4259
02:58:28,280 --> 02:58:30,280
And some of your big franchises

4260
02:58:30,280 --> 02:58:32,280
have gone to, well, mainly Nordic Games.

4261
02:58:32,280 --> 02:58:34,280
They bought Darksiders and Red Faction.

4262
02:58:34,280 --> 02:58:36,280
And five of five games?

4263
02:58:36,280 --> 02:58:38,280
Guess what they get drawn to life.

4264
02:58:38,280 --> 02:58:40,280
So, yeah.

4265
02:58:40,280 --> 02:58:42,280
Gearbox actually got a hold

4266
02:58:42,280 --> 02:58:44,280
of the

4267
02:58:44,280 --> 02:58:46,280
Homeworld franchise.

4268
02:58:46,280 --> 02:58:48,280
The one that they were trying to

4269
02:58:48,280 --> 02:58:50,280
buy via crowdfunding.

4270
02:58:50,280 --> 02:58:52,280
And Nordic Games

4271
02:58:52,280 --> 02:58:54,280
actually has been working with THQ

4272
02:58:54,280 --> 02:58:56,280
for a while now.

4273
02:58:56,280 --> 02:58:58,280
Talking sequels and they're hopefully

4274
02:58:58,280 --> 02:59:00,280
going to get the same developers back on board.

4275
02:59:00,280 --> 02:59:02,280
Also, they purchased

4276
02:59:02,280 --> 02:59:04,280
MX vs ATV and Titan Quest

4277
02:59:04,280 --> 02:59:06,280
for the other two franchises they bought.

4278
02:59:06,280 --> 02:59:08,280
And then THQ sold all this money

4279
02:59:08,280 --> 02:59:10,280
to a lot of people.

4280
02:59:10,280 --> 02:59:12,280
Including Double Fine.

4281
02:59:12,280 --> 02:59:14,280
Codemasters for F1.

4282
02:59:14,280 --> 02:59:16,280
And

4283
02:59:16,280 --> 02:59:18,280
hell, they even own

4284
02:59:18,280 --> 02:59:20,280
Ruben

4285
02:59:20,280 --> 02:59:22,280
some money.

4286
02:59:22,280 --> 02:59:24,280
Different, I guess,

4287
02:59:24,280 --> 02:59:26,280
bonuses or whatever. Employee obligations,

4288
02:59:26,280 --> 02:59:28,280
they said.

4289
02:59:28,280 --> 02:59:30,280
One more

4290
02:59:30,280 --> 02:59:32,280
story for you guys tonight.

4291
02:59:32,280 --> 02:59:34,280
And I think this is very interesting. It's one of those things

4292
02:59:34,280 --> 02:59:36,280
I'm kind of surprised didn't happen sooner.

4293
02:59:36,280 --> 02:59:38,280
But, you know, lately

4294
02:59:38,280 --> 02:59:40,280
we've talked about a lot of crappy games.

4295
02:59:40,280 --> 02:59:42,280
Or, I shouldn't say that necessarily they're crappy

4296
02:59:42,280 --> 02:59:44,280
games, because there's still people that love them.

4297
02:59:44,280 --> 02:59:46,280
But, games that get a crappy

4298
02:59:46,280 --> 02:59:48,280
reputation based on the

4299
02:59:48,280 --> 02:59:50,280
internet. Games such as

4300
02:59:50,280 --> 02:59:52,280
Game City. Mass Effect 3

4301
02:59:52,280 --> 02:59:54,280
in the ending.

4302
02:59:54,280 --> 02:59:56,280
Aliens Colonial Marines. Duke Nukem Forever.

4303
02:59:56,280 --> 02:59:58,280
Well, you know what? Before all of that

4304
02:59:58,280 --> 03:00:00,280
there was ET, the

4305
03:00:00,280 --> 03:00:02,280
extraterrestrial on the Atari 2600.

4306
03:00:02,280 --> 03:00:04,280
But see,

4307
03:00:04,280 --> 03:00:06,280
when I was seven it wasn't as bad

4308
03:00:06,280 --> 03:00:08,280
as everyone made it out to be. But the most frustrating thing

4309
03:00:08,280 --> 03:00:10,280
was you always fell in the damn pit, right?

4310
03:00:10,280 --> 03:00:12,280
Well, here's the interesting thing.

4311
03:00:12,280 --> 03:00:14,280
A hacker went back

4312
03:00:14,280 --> 03:00:16,280
and fixed some of the problems people have

4313
03:00:16,280 --> 03:00:18,280
with the game. And now people are like

4314
03:00:18,280 --> 03:00:20,280
this game's not so bad. It's kind of fun.

4315
03:00:20,280 --> 03:00:22,280
So what were the things that were changed?

4316
03:00:22,280 --> 03:00:24,280
Well, for one, they made ET an actual

4317
03:00:24,280 --> 03:00:26,280
ET color instead of, you know,

4318
03:00:26,280 --> 03:00:28,280
that green. And most

4319
03:00:28,280 --> 03:00:30,280
importantly, they fixed the

4320
03:00:30,280 --> 03:00:32,280
falling in the pit all the time. Instead of one

4321
03:00:32,280 --> 03:00:34,280
pixel colliding with the pit, it's a different

4322
03:00:34,280 --> 03:00:36,280
collision detection, which makes it far

4323
03:00:36,280 --> 03:00:38,280
less frustrating. You're not always

4324
03:00:38,280 --> 03:00:40,280
falling in that stupid pit.

4325
03:00:40,280 --> 03:00:42,280
So, now just so you guys know

4326
03:00:42,280 --> 03:00:44,280
Howard Scott Warshaw made the original game

4327
03:00:44,280 --> 03:00:46,280
and he was really rushed

4328
03:00:46,280 --> 03:00:48,280
over time. As a lot of the movie tie-in games

4329
03:00:48,280 --> 03:00:50,280
were at the time, he only had

4330
03:00:50,280 --> 03:00:52,280
months to make it. Same thing happened with Pac-Man

4331
03:00:52,280 --> 03:00:54,280
and why that turned out so bad, too.

4332
03:00:54,280 --> 03:00:56,280
Isn't that funny? Pac-Man was awful.

4333
03:00:56,280 --> 03:00:58,280
Isn't that funny how some things never seem to change?

4334
03:00:58,280 --> 03:01:00,280
When it's rushed too much.

4335
03:01:00,280 --> 03:01:02,280
We would think we'd learn from history.

4336
03:01:02,280 --> 03:01:04,280
But anyway, yeah, so

4337
03:01:04,280 --> 03:01:06,280
according to

4338
03:01:06,280 --> 03:01:08,280
Warshaw himself, he said, I was either

4339
03:01:08,280 --> 03:01:10,280
the golden child selected to do the project or

4340
03:01:10,280 --> 03:01:12,280
I was the only one stupid enough to take on the challenge.

4341
03:01:12,280 --> 03:01:14,280
You know, he did Yars

4342
03:01:14,280 --> 03:01:16,280
Revenge too, which was a great, great game.

4343
03:01:16,280 --> 03:01:18,280
But anyway,

4344
03:01:18,280 --> 03:01:20,280
Neocomputer.org is

4345
03:01:20,280 --> 03:01:22,280
the one that made the project that

4346
03:01:22,280 --> 03:01:24,280
tried to fix some of E.T.'s problems.

4347
03:01:24,280 --> 03:01:26,280
And I believe

4348
03:01:26,280 --> 03:01:28,280
the project ended up getting

4349
03:01:28,280 --> 03:01:30,280
done by David Richardson

4350
03:01:30,280 --> 03:01:32,280
who goes by the handle recompile.

4351
03:01:32,280 --> 03:01:34,280
And that's pretty cool.

4352
03:01:34,280 --> 03:01:36,280
From Atari age. He single-handedly,

4353
03:01:36,280 --> 03:01:38,280
I guess, maybe this started the discussion

4354
03:01:38,280 --> 03:01:40,280
there, but he single-handedly ended up putting it together.

4355
03:01:40,280 --> 03:01:42,280
And fixed the well,

4356
03:01:42,280 --> 03:01:44,280
fixed the difficulty settings.

4357
03:01:44,280 --> 03:01:46,280
So, like, not every step

4358
03:01:46,280 --> 03:01:48,280
will drain your energy.

4359
03:01:48,280 --> 03:01:50,280
And some of this stuff. So, uh,

4360
03:01:50,280 --> 03:01:52,280
yeah, pretty cool. And it even, like, showed

4361
03:01:52,280 --> 03:01:54,280
tutorial videos and how they did it.

4362
03:01:54,280 --> 03:01:56,280
Yeah, and they even have, if you want to do the ROM hack yourself,

4363
03:01:56,280 --> 03:01:58,280
they give you the addresses and what the

4364
03:01:58,280 --> 03:02:00,280
change in the hex editor.

4365
03:02:00,280 --> 03:02:02,280
I bet somebody like you is like, well, I know you don't hack a lot of

4366
03:02:02,280 --> 03:02:04,280
Atari 2600, but this is still pretty fast.

4367
03:02:04,280 --> 03:02:06,280
The one that's already done. You can download the ROM, I think.

4368
03:02:06,280 --> 03:02:08,280
Yeah, yeah.

4369
03:02:08,280 --> 03:02:10,280
But very cool.

4370
03:02:10,280 --> 03:02:12,280
It's almost like how people

4371
03:02:12,280 --> 03:02:14,280
will hack SimCity to play offline.

4372
03:02:14,280 --> 03:02:16,280
Or fix, you know, alien colonial

4373
03:02:16,280 --> 03:02:18,280
marines. But, you know, some of the stuff in there.

4374
03:02:18,280 --> 03:02:20,280
It's just funny. Alright, so

4375
03:02:20,280 --> 03:02:22,280
there you go. That's it for the

4376
03:02:22,280 --> 03:02:24,280
official stories we have tonight. Let me know,

4377
03:02:24,280 --> 03:02:26,280
let me open up the Skype line.

4378
03:02:26,280 --> 03:02:28,280
1877 Game O-L-R, or our username on

4379
03:02:28,280 --> 03:02:30,280
Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one

4380
03:02:30,280 --> 03:02:32,280
word. If you want to go ahead and give us a call,

4381
03:02:32,280 --> 03:02:34,280
that would be awesome.

4382
03:02:34,280 --> 03:02:36,280
If you want to talk about something we talked about on the show

4383
03:02:36,280 --> 03:02:38,280
tonight, or something you think we missed, what you've

4384
03:02:38,280 --> 03:02:40,280
been playing, that's why you have a question for Captain Spike,

4385
03:02:40,280 --> 03:02:42,280
or Tim, and want to talk about

4386
03:02:42,280 --> 03:02:44,280
whatevers, give us a call.

4387
03:02:44,280 --> 03:02:46,280
Say hello. 1877 Game O-L-R,

4388
03:02:46,280 --> 03:02:48,280
our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

4389
03:02:48,280 --> 03:02:50,280
Last minute stories, alright? So, in the

4390
03:02:50,280 --> 03:02:52,280
same vein of Metal Gear Solid,

4391
03:02:52,280 --> 03:02:54,280
and the sequels to that, and

4392
03:02:54,280 --> 03:02:56,280
going with different voice actors, the

4393
03:02:56,280 --> 03:02:58,280
next Arkham City game is

4394
03:02:58,280 --> 03:03:00,280
not going to have the same Batman

4395
03:03:00,280 --> 03:03:02,280
voice. They're going with someone younger.

4396
03:03:02,280 --> 03:03:04,280
Deal breaker. So, I have

4397
03:03:04,280 --> 03:03:06,280
Kevin Conroy will not be reprising Batman.

4398
03:03:06,280 --> 03:03:08,280
I've, and some

4399
03:03:08,280 --> 03:03:10,280
people are really frowning at the new Batman having

4400
03:03:10,280 --> 03:03:12,280
multiplayer. I don't think

4401
03:03:12,280 --> 03:03:14,280
that, again, I'm not going to throw the baby out with

4402
03:03:14,280 --> 03:03:16,280
the bathwater and say, Batman sucks because

4403
03:03:16,280 --> 03:03:18,280
they're adding multiplayer to it, because like Mass Effect

4404
03:03:18,280 --> 03:03:20,280
3, it was fine. I really love the multiplayer

4405
03:03:20,280 --> 03:03:22,280
Mass Effect 3. But I

4406
03:03:22,280 --> 03:03:24,280
understand where people have some great reservations,

4407
03:03:24,280 --> 03:03:26,280
especially hearing it's a new studio, and now all this

4408
03:03:26,280 --> 03:03:28,280
other, like, it kind of sounds like they're trying

4409
03:03:28,280 --> 03:03:30,280
to do this one on the cheap.

4410
03:03:30,280 --> 03:03:32,280
That is a big concern.

4411
03:03:32,280 --> 03:03:34,280
So,

4412
03:03:34,280 --> 03:03:36,280
you're agreeing with me over there, Spike?

4413
03:03:36,280 --> 03:03:38,280
I do agree.

4414
03:03:38,280 --> 03:03:40,280
Which is, because, Arkham

4415
03:03:40,280 --> 03:03:42,280
City is so fucking good.

4416
03:03:42,280 --> 03:03:44,280
Like, this next game,

4417
03:03:44,280 --> 03:03:46,280
to live up to that legacy, is really going to have to be

4418
03:03:46,280 --> 03:03:48,280
a step above that. When you hear things like this,

4419
03:03:48,280 --> 03:03:50,280
you kind of go, not sure

4420
03:03:50,280 --> 03:03:52,280
if, want?

4421
03:03:52,280 --> 03:03:54,280
We'll see. I'm sure E3 is going to answer

4422
03:03:54,280 --> 03:03:56,280
a lot of that. Anything else?

4423
03:03:56,280 --> 03:03:58,280
1877 Game O-L-R, or our username on Skype,

4424
03:03:58,280 --> 03:04:00,280
Orange Launch Radio, if you want to call. All one word.

4425
03:04:00,280 --> 03:04:02,280
Not really, but there's been some

4426
03:04:02,280 --> 03:04:04,280
Kickstarter projects I've been looking at, like, for example,

4427
03:04:04,280 --> 03:04:06,280
Anne, which is kind of a cross between

4428
03:04:06,280 --> 03:04:08,280
like, a Metroidvania game and

4429
03:04:08,280 --> 03:04:10,280
like, Gradius. So you get to fly around

4430
03:04:10,280 --> 03:04:12,280
the ship, and you get to also,

4431
03:04:12,280 --> 03:04:14,280
I guess it's more like Blaster Master.

4432
03:04:14,280 --> 03:04:16,280
You get to fly around a ship, or you get to go outside

4433
03:04:16,280 --> 03:04:18,280
on foot and stuff.

4434
03:04:18,280 --> 03:04:20,280
And it looks kind of cool.

4435
03:04:20,280 --> 03:04:22,280
Real quick, Tigerclaw in chat says,

4436
03:04:22,280 --> 03:04:24,280
the reason why the new Batman game has a younger

4437
03:04:24,280 --> 03:04:26,280
version actor is because the game takes place

4438
03:04:26,280 --> 03:04:28,280
years before Arkham Asylum. It's a prequel.

4439
03:04:28,280 --> 03:04:30,280
That's why they went with somebody younger.

4440
03:04:34,280 --> 03:04:36,280
That's an excuse.

4441
03:04:36,280 --> 03:04:38,280
He's a voice actor.

4442
03:04:38,280 --> 03:04:40,280
He's played younger Batman

4443
03:04:40,280 --> 03:04:42,280
in different, you know, animated series

4444
03:04:42,280 --> 03:04:44,280
and what have you. He's been doing this voice a long time.

4445
03:04:44,280 --> 03:04:46,280
He's very good. They also didn't hear

4446
03:04:46,280 --> 03:04:48,280
your mic off or something?

4447
03:04:48,280 --> 03:04:50,280
He's done a teenage

4448
03:04:50,280 --> 03:04:52,280
Bruce Wayne, and did a wonderfully

4449
03:04:52,280 --> 03:04:54,280
believable job.

4450
03:04:54,280 --> 03:04:56,280
Alright, we got a phone call here. Hi, you're on Orange

4451
03:04:56,280 --> 03:04:58,280
Radio. Who's this?

4452
03:04:58,280 --> 03:05:00,280
Dartitsouria. Hey, Dartitsouria.

4453
03:05:00,280 --> 03:05:02,280
What's up, buddy?

4454
03:05:02,280 --> 03:05:04,280
Hey.

4455
03:05:04,280 --> 03:05:06,280
Oh, not a whole lot.

4456
03:05:06,280 --> 03:05:08,280
I'm just, you know, hanging in there.

4457
03:05:08,280 --> 03:05:10,280
Well, what'd you want to

4458
03:05:10,280 --> 03:05:12,280
call us about tonight?

4459
03:05:12,280 --> 03:05:14,280
Well, I had a, uh,

4460
03:05:14,280 --> 03:05:16,280
hang on, let me mute my...

4461
03:05:16,280 --> 03:05:18,280
Are you here?

4462
03:05:18,280 --> 03:05:20,280
Did you forget to mute your radio before

4463
03:05:20,280 --> 03:05:22,280
you called in?

4464
03:05:22,280 --> 03:05:24,280
Yeah, I was trying to.

4465
03:05:24,280 --> 03:05:26,280
Sorry. No, I had a, uh,

4466
03:05:26,280 --> 03:05:28,280
so I have a

4467
03:05:28,280 --> 03:05:30,280
Steam key for La Mulana.

4468
03:05:30,280 --> 03:05:32,280
I want to donate to the show.

4469
03:05:32,280 --> 03:05:34,280
Heck yeah.

4470
03:05:34,280 --> 03:05:36,280
Wait, didn't

4471
03:05:36,280 --> 03:05:38,280
Dark Sakura have dibs on that?

4472
03:05:38,280 --> 03:05:40,280
Something? La Mulana on Steam?

4473
03:05:40,280 --> 03:05:42,280
Yeah.

4474
03:05:42,280 --> 03:05:44,280
Because I was like, if she ain't taking it,

4475
03:05:44,280 --> 03:05:46,280
I'm taking it. Shit, I want to play it.

4476
03:05:46,280 --> 03:05:48,280
I came super close to buying it until I remembered.

4477
03:05:48,280 --> 03:05:50,280
Oh, there you go.

4478
03:05:50,280 --> 03:05:52,280
Well, as much as I would love

4479
03:05:52,280 --> 03:05:54,280
to give a key away to the listener, uh,

4480
03:05:54,280 --> 03:05:56,280
to the listeners, um, I think we want to

4481
03:05:56,280 --> 03:05:58,280
kind of keep it for ourselves. Sorry, but

4482
03:05:58,280 --> 03:06:00,280
I want to play. Only because you rave about

4483
03:06:00,280 --> 03:06:02,280
it so much. Yeah. Do we want to play it for

4484
03:06:02,280 --> 03:06:04,280
ourselves?

4485
03:06:04,280 --> 03:06:06,280
Yeah. Why should we all be

4486
03:06:06,280 --> 03:06:08,280
playing La Mulana?

4487
03:06:10,280 --> 03:06:12,280
Well, it's a fun game.

4488
03:06:12,280 --> 03:06:14,280
It's like, like, you know,

4489
03:06:14,280 --> 03:06:16,280
those old school games were

4490
03:06:16,280 --> 03:06:18,280
tough, but, you know.

4491
03:06:18,280 --> 03:06:20,280
Yeah.

4492
03:06:20,280 --> 03:06:22,280
La Mulana, isn't La Mulana, like,

4493
03:06:22,280 --> 03:06:24,280
asshole Mario hard?

4494
03:06:24,280 --> 03:06:26,280
Uh,

4495
03:06:26,280 --> 03:06:28,280
it can be, but let's get the hang of it.

4496
03:06:28,280 --> 03:06:30,280
It's just, it's just memorizing

4497
03:06:30,280 --> 03:06:32,280
patterns, just like old MegaMakers. You know what?

4498
03:06:32,280 --> 03:06:34,280
I will be magnanimous

4499
03:06:34,280 --> 03:06:36,280
and donate

4500
03:06:36,280 --> 03:06:38,280
that code to you.

4501
03:06:38,280 --> 03:06:40,280
Yay!

4502
03:06:40,280 --> 03:06:42,280
Alright, uh,

4503
03:06:42,280 --> 03:06:44,280
Dark Tetsuya, I, I, I,

4504
03:06:44,280 --> 03:06:46,280
thank you very much for, for donating

4505
03:06:46,280 --> 03:06:48,280
the code to us and feeding our gaming

4506
03:06:48,280 --> 03:06:50,280
addiction further.

4507
03:06:50,280 --> 03:06:52,280
ActDeft in the chat room says, La

4508
03:06:52,280 --> 03:06:54,280
Mulana is your Mass Effect.

4509
03:06:54,280 --> 03:06:56,280
True? I bet he

4510
03:06:56,280 --> 03:06:58,280
doesn't have Turians. Yeah, I suppose so.

4511
03:06:58,280 --> 03:07:00,280
Alright.

4512
03:07:00,280 --> 03:07:02,280
Well, Dark Tetsuya, is there anything else you want to talk about,

4513
03:07:02,280 --> 03:07:04,280
talk, talk with us about tonight?

4514
03:07:04,280 --> 03:07:06,280
Uh,

4515
03:07:06,280 --> 03:07:08,280
just had a question.

4516
03:07:08,280 --> 03:07:10,280
Yeah.

4517
03:07:10,280 --> 03:07:12,280
So, um, so I was planning

4518
03:07:12,280 --> 03:07:14,280
on, uh, Best Gets 3. Yeah?

4519
03:07:14,280 --> 03:07:16,280
Right.

4520
03:07:16,280 --> 03:07:18,280
I kind of need, uh, Episode 169

4521
03:07:18,280 --> 03:07:20,280
to finish

4522
03:07:20,280 --> 03:07:22,280
working on it.

4523
03:07:22,280 --> 03:07:24,280
Oh, for, um,

4524
03:07:24,280 --> 03:07:26,280
uh, is this, this is the, um,

4525
03:07:26,280 --> 03:07:28,280
the, is this the DDR step file

4526
03:07:28,280 --> 03:07:30,280
stuff?

4527
03:07:30,280 --> 03:07:32,280
Oh, no, that's the, uh,

4528
03:07:32,280 --> 03:07:34,280
Best Hits compilation.

4529
03:07:34,280 --> 03:07:36,280
So, best hits. Oh!

4530
03:07:36,280 --> 03:07:38,280
So you, you need Episode 169?

4531
03:07:38,280 --> 03:07:40,280
You don't have that? I think he said 159.

4532
03:07:40,280 --> 03:07:42,280
Uh-uh. Alright,

4533
03:07:42,280 --> 03:07:44,280
we'll have to find it. If I don't have it,

4534
03:07:44,280 --> 03:07:46,280
then I'm sure Misty or Angel's got to have

4535
03:07:46,280 --> 03:07:48,280
it, or maybe somebody else has

4536
03:07:48,280 --> 03:07:50,280
a, I will look for it,

4537
03:07:50,280 --> 03:07:52,280
but there is an episode in the past

4538
03:07:52,280 --> 03:07:54,280
that is gone forever. There is a missing

4539
03:07:54,280 --> 03:07:56,280
episode that's completely gone, because

4540
03:07:56,280 --> 03:07:58,280
we weren't able to save it that night. And we were

4541
03:07:58,280 --> 03:08:00,280
too drunk to remember. There might actually be two.

4542
03:08:00,280 --> 03:08:02,280
So, there are a couple gaps

4543
03:08:02,280 --> 03:08:04,280
that you're going to find that, unfortunately,

4544
03:08:04,280 --> 03:08:06,280
they're gone forever.

4545
03:08:06,280 --> 03:08:08,280
Not a big deal.

4546
03:08:08,280 --> 03:08:10,280
Alright. Alright, well, Dark Tetsuya, we're going to let you go to get

4547
03:08:10,280 --> 03:08:12,280
more calls, but take care, okay?

4548
03:08:12,280 --> 03:08:14,280
Alright.

4549
03:08:14,280 --> 03:08:16,280
Sorry, he had some type of echo going on

4550
03:08:16,280 --> 03:08:18,280
in the background. It kind of made it hard for me

4551
03:08:18,280 --> 03:08:20,280
to hear. I think he didn't really mute the computer.

4552
03:08:20,280 --> 03:08:22,280
Or he had the TV on in the background.

4553
03:08:22,280 --> 03:08:24,280
He's trying to watch Chair of Swords.

4554
03:08:24,280 --> 03:08:26,280
And, uh... Damn that show.

4555
03:08:26,280 --> 03:08:28,280
Listen to us at the

4556
03:08:28,280 --> 03:08:30,280
same time. By the way, though, I did find a character

4557
03:08:30,280 --> 03:08:32,280
I like. Daenerys.

4558
03:08:32,280 --> 03:08:34,280
Because she sets people on fire.

4559
03:08:34,280 --> 03:08:36,280
And she inquires

4560
03:08:36,280 --> 03:08:38,280
about the location of her dragons.

4561
03:08:38,280 --> 03:08:40,280
1877 GameOLR

4562
03:08:40,280 --> 03:08:42,280
or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio

4563
03:08:42,280 --> 03:08:44,280
if you want to give us a call. Loki, can you talk again?

4564
03:08:44,280 --> 03:08:46,280
I'm talking.

4565
03:08:46,280 --> 03:08:48,280
And my mic is not working.

4566
03:08:48,280 --> 03:08:50,280
Why is your mic just suddenly stopped working?

4567
03:08:50,280 --> 03:08:52,280
That's weird. Because your board

4568
03:08:52,280 --> 03:08:54,280
is possessed. Maybe it just

4569
03:08:54,280 --> 03:08:56,280
needs to be dusted. It is kind of...

4570
03:08:56,280 --> 03:08:58,280
I wonder if our board might

4571
03:08:58,280 --> 03:09:00,280
just be... I mean, we've had that board

4572
03:09:00,280 --> 03:09:02,280
six years now.

4573
03:09:02,280 --> 03:09:04,280
It was a

4574
03:09:04,280 --> 03:09:06,280
damn expensive board. It should last.

4575
03:09:06,280 --> 03:09:08,280
I know. I'm just saying.

4576
03:09:08,280 --> 03:09:10,280
That's the reality. We might need something else.

4577
03:09:10,280 --> 03:09:12,280
Well, maybe it just needs to be cleaned out.

4578
03:09:12,280 --> 03:09:14,280
The contacts need to be...

4579
03:09:14,280 --> 03:09:16,280
We'll work on it. Live Radio.

4580
03:09:16,280 --> 03:09:18,280
Ain't it a blast? Because we didn't learn

4581
03:09:18,280 --> 03:09:20,280
that we were going to have audio problems

4582
03:09:20,280 --> 03:09:22,280
until, like, Bobby's

4583
03:09:22,280 --> 03:09:24,280
call tonight. Yeah, really, right?

4584
03:09:24,280 --> 03:09:26,280
Alright. I'm going to

4585
03:09:26,280 --> 03:09:28,280
just leave it open a little longer for another call.

4586
03:09:28,280 --> 03:09:30,280
1877 GameOLR or our username on Skype,

4587
03:09:30,280 --> 03:09:32,280
OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us

4588
03:09:32,280 --> 03:09:34,280
a call. I'm going to quickly try

4589
03:09:34,280 --> 03:09:36,280
to comb the Twitter topics at Twitter.com

4590
03:09:36,280 --> 03:09:38,280
slash O-L-R.

4591
03:09:38,280 --> 03:09:40,280
TigerClaw is sending us a tweet.

4592
03:09:40,280 --> 03:09:42,280
Eve Online getting a TV show based

4593
03:09:42,280 --> 03:09:44,280
on real player stories.

4594
03:09:44,280 --> 03:09:46,280
Hmm, isn't that kind of like what Defiance is

4595
03:09:46,280 --> 03:09:48,280
doing? But yeah, Eve Online

4596
03:09:48,280 --> 03:09:50,280
of course is an MMO that's been around for a

4597
03:09:50,280 --> 03:09:52,280
while. It's that whole

4598
03:09:52,280 --> 03:09:54,280
space one. Isn't that the one where

4599
03:09:54,280 --> 03:09:56,280
they had all that loot of

4600
03:09:56,280 --> 03:09:58,280
game time cards that were

4601
03:09:58,280 --> 03:10:00,280
on a ship and the ship exploded and it's like

4602
03:10:00,280 --> 03:10:02,280
all that money is just gone?

4603
03:10:02,280 --> 03:10:04,280
So yeah, Eve Online going to get a TV

4604
03:10:04,280 --> 03:10:06,280
show based on the stories in game. That's pretty cool.

4605
03:10:06,280 --> 03:10:08,280
Can you imagine if they turned

4606
03:10:08,280 --> 03:10:10,280
fanfic into TV shows? Because that's

4607
03:10:10,280 --> 03:10:12,280
essentially what they're saying here. Oh no, they did it.

4608
03:10:12,280 --> 03:10:14,280
Well, I don't know.

4609
03:10:14,280 --> 03:10:16,280
They did it for Mass Effect with the Citadel DLC.

4610
03:10:16,280 --> 03:10:18,280
I was going to say

4611
03:10:18,280 --> 03:10:20,280
that. Except for

4612
03:10:20,280 --> 03:10:22,280
creepy Shega.

4613
03:10:22,280 --> 03:10:24,280
Yeah, that really upset me.

4614
03:10:24,280 --> 03:10:26,280
That was so date rapey. Oh my god.

4615
03:10:26,280 --> 03:10:28,280
I felt dirty watching

4616
03:10:28,280 --> 03:10:30,280
it on YouTube.

4617
03:10:30,280 --> 03:10:32,280
Just

4618
03:10:32,280 --> 03:10:34,280
filthy.

4619
03:10:34,280 --> 03:10:36,280
Let's see, also at Twitter.com

4620
03:10:36,280 --> 03:10:38,280
slash O-L-R

4621
03:10:38,280 --> 03:10:40,280
a tweet from

4622
03:10:40,280 --> 03:10:42,280
ActDeaf. The third Skullgirls

4623
03:10:42,280 --> 03:10:44,280
DLC character voting has ended.

4624
03:10:44,280 --> 03:10:46,280
The fans chose Eliza, an

4625
03:10:46,280 --> 03:10:48,280
Egyptian based character.

4626
03:10:48,280 --> 03:10:50,280
You know, Skullgirls is pretty tight with the

4627
03:10:50,280 --> 03:10:52,280
Brony community. I'm not surprised

4628
03:10:52,280 --> 03:10:54,280
that ActDeaf's reporting on this. That's a

4629
03:10:54,280 --> 03:10:56,280
big thing I see on my Tumblr page a lot

4630
03:10:56,280 --> 03:10:58,280
actually. Brony? No, Skullgirls.

4631
03:10:58,280 --> 03:11:00,280
Oh, Skullgirls? Yeah. Well. There's a

4632
03:11:00,280 --> 03:11:02,280
big stint of Skullgirls stuff for a while.

4633
03:11:02,280 --> 03:11:04,280
That was a great alliance that they made.

4634
03:11:04,280 --> 03:11:06,280
Let's be real. So,

4635
03:11:06,280 --> 03:11:08,280
that's Twitter topics. Twitter.com slash

4636
03:11:08,280 --> 03:11:10,280
O-L-R.

4637
03:11:10,280 --> 03:11:12,280
Nobody's calling.

4638
03:11:12,280 --> 03:11:14,280
Nobody wants to say hi. How sad.

4639
03:11:14,280 --> 03:11:16,280
Come on, call us.

4640
03:11:16,280 --> 03:11:18,280
We won't yell at you much.

4641
03:11:18,280 --> 03:11:20,280
Fifth Dream in Chats is that's who they voted

4642
03:11:20,280 --> 03:11:22,280
for.

4643
03:11:22,280 --> 03:11:24,280
So, River City Ransom 2 is supposed to be getting

4644
03:11:24,280 --> 03:11:26,280
a Kickstarter. Oh, wait. Here.

4645
03:11:26,280 --> 03:11:28,280
Wait, no. She read that during the

4646
03:11:28,280 --> 03:11:30,280
rapid fire news. Yeah. I just want to remind

4647
03:11:30,280 --> 03:11:32,280
everybody to kickstart it when it actually

4648
03:11:32,280 --> 03:11:34,280
comes online. But it's not the real thing.

4649
03:11:34,280 --> 03:11:36,280
Who cares?

4650
03:11:36,280 --> 03:11:38,280
It has to be Kunio where it's nothing

4651
03:11:38,280 --> 03:11:40,280
else. Also, My Sleep looks awesome.

4652
03:11:40,280 --> 03:11:42,280
I kickstarted that one.

4653
03:11:42,280 --> 03:11:44,280
Among the Sleep, it's the one where it's a

4654
03:11:44,280 --> 03:11:46,280
survivor horror. The horror game

4655
03:11:46,280 --> 03:11:48,280
where you play as a two year old. From the

4656
03:11:48,280 --> 03:11:50,280
perspective of a two year old. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4657
03:11:50,280 --> 03:11:52,280
I would play the hell out of that. Kickstarting

4658
03:11:52,280 --> 03:11:54,280
right now. They need money. You know what?

4659
03:11:54,280 --> 03:11:56,280
I actually found a Kickstarter since

4660
03:11:56,280 --> 03:11:58,280
we don't have the one yet for Understanding

4661
03:11:58,280 --> 03:12:00,280
Video Games. I'm actually

4662
03:12:00,280 --> 03:12:02,280
except I think it's already over was contributing

4663
03:12:02,280 --> 03:12:04,280
to a Dr. Demento album.

4664
03:12:04,280 --> 03:12:06,280
Like another big compilation

4665
03:12:06,280 --> 03:12:08,280
in honor of Dr. Demento's birthday.

4666
03:12:08,280 --> 03:12:10,280
I thought it only had like two days left on it

4667
03:12:10,280 --> 03:12:12,280
a couple days ago. But I love

4668
03:12:12,280 --> 03:12:14,280
Dr. Demento. So, whatever.

4669
03:12:16,280 --> 03:12:18,280
Alright. Well, our listeners are being

4670
03:12:18,280 --> 03:12:20,280
shy tonight. Oh, come on. Give them one more chance.

4671
03:12:20,280 --> 03:12:22,280
Alright, one more chance. I'll leave it open a little

4672
03:12:22,280 --> 03:12:24,280
bit longer here.

4673
03:12:24,280 --> 03:12:26,280
Oh, I didn't do

4674
03:12:26,280 --> 03:12:28,280
Thank you. This is how we can fill time.

4675
03:12:28,280 --> 03:12:30,280
Listless results.

4676
03:12:30,280 --> 03:12:32,280
Thank you. Yeah, I did.

4677
03:12:32,280 --> 03:12:34,280
I wasn't paying attention.

4678
03:12:34,280 --> 03:12:36,280
Everybody's out of it tonight. These sound

4679
03:12:36,280 --> 03:12:38,280
problems just snowballed

4680
03:12:38,280 --> 03:12:40,280
into LOL. Alright, let's go over

4681
03:12:40,280 --> 03:12:42,280
listless results tonight.

4682
03:12:44,280 --> 03:12:46,280
You know why I didn't do listless results? Because in my

4683
03:12:46,280 --> 03:12:48,280
head, I already know. I already tabulated them up.

4684
03:12:48,280 --> 03:12:50,280
Alright, here we go. We don't live in your

4685
03:12:50,280 --> 03:12:52,280
head, thank God. Here it is. The

4686
03:12:52,280 --> 03:12:54,280
definitive list as voted on by the listeners.

4687
03:12:54,280 --> 03:12:56,280
Mascot, we are going to donate to

4688
03:12:56,280 --> 03:12:58,280
Sega in a close fourth

4689
03:12:58,280 --> 03:13:00,280
place, worth mentioning. Master

4690
03:13:00,280 --> 03:13:02,280
System, the Sega robot. In a very close

4691
03:13:02,280 --> 03:13:04,280
fourth place. Yay. In third

4692
03:13:04,280 --> 03:13:06,280
honestly, the way the listeners

4693
03:13:06,280 --> 03:13:08,280
voted tonight is really perfect, I've got to

4694
03:13:08,280 --> 03:13:10,280
say. So, I cannot argue with

4695
03:13:10,280 --> 03:13:12,280
this at all. Number three.

4696
03:13:12,280 --> 03:13:14,280
The number three answer for Mascot, we

4697
03:13:14,280 --> 03:13:16,280
will donate to Sega. An amalgamation

4698
03:13:16,280 --> 03:13:18,280
of all of Sonic's shitty friends.

4699
03:13:18,280 --> 03:13:20,280
It's the one I would have voted

4700
03:13:20,280 --> 03:13:22,280
for. There it is, number three.

4701
03:13:22,280 --> 03:13:24,280
Number two,

4702
03:13:24,280 --> 03:13:26,280
as voted by the listeners.

4703
03:13:26,280 --> 03:13:28,280
President Cat. Yay.

4704
03:13:28,280 --> 03:13:30,280
Fair enough, fair enough. We love you, Reena.

4705
03:13:30,280 --> 03:13:32,280
And the number one

4706
03:13:32,280 --> 03:13:34,280
answer of Mascot, we

4707
03:13:34,280 --> 03:13:36,280
will, and I don't know how we're going to do this,

4708
03:13:36,280 --> 03:13:38,280
maybe I can get somebody to put together a little

4709
03:13:38,280 --> 03:13:40,280
clip art, something for us. We can actually send this

4710
03:13:40,280 --> 03:13:42,280
to Sega, like a nice little envelope.

4711
03:13:42,280 --> 03:13:44,280
The number one answer that we

4712
03:13:44,280 --> 03:13:46,280
will gift on behalf of OLR,

4713
03:13:46,280 --> 03:13:48,280
a forklift, ladies

4714
03:13:48,280 --> 03:13:50,280
and gentlemen, a forklift.

4715
03:13:52,280 --> 03:13:54,280
I approve. Does the

4716
03:13:54,280 --> 03:13:56,280
forklift have a name? A forklift one out of

4717
03:13:56,280 --> 03:13:58,280
all the crazy things Rob would have had to dress up in?

4718
03:13:58,280 --> 03:14:00,280
Really? And Loki.

4719
03:14:00,280 --> 03:14:02,280
Forky.

4720
03:14:02,280 --> 03:14:04,280
Forky the Forklift.

4721
03:14:04,280 --> 03:14:06,280
You know what? Can't

4722
03:14:06,280 --> 03:14:08,280
I'll draw it. Can't the name be Q-Q-Q-Q

4723
03:14:08,280 --> 03:14:10,280
so it's 4Q the Forklift?

4724
03:14:10,280 --> 03:14:12,280
Oh my god,

4725
03:14:12,280 --> 03:14:14,280
that's great.

4726
03:14:14,280 --> 03:14:16,280
4Q the Forklift. And then he comes

4727
03:14:16,280 --> 03:14:18,280
into that song.

4728
03:14:18,280 --> 03:14:20,280
No, that's Taku.

4729
03:14:20,280 --> 03:14:22,280
Alright, there it is,

4730
03:14:22,280 --> 03:14:24,280
your winner of the list tonight. Don't give that

4731
03:14:24,280 --> 03:14:26,280
disapproving

4732
03:14:26,280 --> 03:14:28,280
It's funny and you know it.

4733
03:14:28,280 --> 03:14:30,280
It's my default look.

4734
03:14:30,280 --> 03:14:32,280
You're so mean.

4735
03:14:32,280 --> 03:14:34,280
Sometimes

4736
03:14:34,280 --> 03:14:36,280
I wish it were a TV show. DungeonBuster wants

4737
03:14:36,280 --> 03:14:38,280
to see the forklift fight the Daytona

4738
03:14:38,280 --> 03:14:40,280
car. I don't know, the forklift

4739
03:14:40,280 --> 03:14:42,280
would fight dirty.

4740
03:14:42,280 --> 03:14:44,280
It would just get under the car and flip it.

4741
03:14:44,280 --> 03:14:46,280
But the Daytona

4742
03:14:46,280 --> 03:14:48,280
car has the power of AM2 behind it.

4743
03:14:50,280 --> 03:14:52,280
Perfect Q-Q-Q-Q.

4744
03:14:52,280 --> 03:14:54,280
Alright, again, the Skypline

4745
03:14:54,280 --> 03:14:56,280
not lighting up. What's up with y'all?

4746
03:14:56,280 --> 03:14:58,280
So I'm gonna close it. Sorry

4747
03:14:58,280 --> 03:15:00,280
maybe Skype screwed up.

4748
03:15:00,280 --> 03:15:02,280
Everything else is screwed up on tonight's show. Why not

4749
03:15:02,280 --> 03:15:04,280
Skype? Alright. Well

4750
03:15:04,280 --> 03:15:06,280
that is about gonna wrap it up for another episode

4751
03:15:06,280 --> 03:15:08,280
of Orange Lawns Radio. But before we go around and get

4752
03:15:08,280 --> 03:15:10,280
all the final thoughts tonight, I really want to thank our guests

4753
03:15:10,280 --> 03:15:12,280
for being here tonight. Tim,

4754
03:15:12,280 --> 03:15:14,280
I'm glad we could pop your podcast cherry.

4755
03:15:14,280 --> 03:15:16,280
I'm glad

4756
03:15:16,280 --> 03:15:18,280
to have you do it.

4757
03:15:18,280 --> 03:15:20,280
And I'm glad that you liked my gift.

4758
03:15:20,280 --> 03:15:22,280
Yes, thank you very much.

4759
03:15:22,280 --> 03:15:24,280
I'm gonna slap you when we get home tonight.

4760
03:15:24,280 --> 03:15:26,280
Whoa.

4761
03:15:26,280 --> 03:15:28,280
Isn't that a little TMI?

4762
03:15:28,280 --> 03:15:30,280
Come on you guys.

4763
03:15:30,280 --> 03:15:32,280
But good luck with

4764
03:15:32,280 --> 03:15:34,280
whatever it is you guys are working on next.

4765
03:15:34,280 --> 03:15:36,280
And thanks for talking about

4766
03:15:36,280 --> 03:15:38,280
how you got into gaming and all that stuff with us tonight.

4767
03:15:38,280 --> 03:15:40,280
Sure, it was my pleasure.

4768
03:15:40,280 --> 03:15:42,280
Do you have any questions on Twitter or anything you might

4769
03:15:42,280 --> 03:15:44,280
if listeners want to follow you further or whatever?

4770
03:15:44,280 --> 03:15:46,280
Sure, TimTRP

4771
03:15:46,280 --> 03:15:48,280
at Twitter.

4772
03:15:48,280 --> 03:15:50,280
I'm sort of TimTRP at everything because I have no

4773
03:15:50,280 --> 03:15:52,280
imagination.

4774
03:15:52,280 --> 03:15:54,280
If you have any more questions for me or questions about

4775
03:15:54,280 --> 03:15:56,280
getting into the game industry or whatever, I'm happy

4776
03:15:56,280 --> 03:15:58,280
to talk to you about it.

4777
03:15:58,280 --> 03:16:00,280
Alright, awesome. I'll be sure to give you my resume.

4778
03:16:00,280 --> 03:16:02,280
CaptainSpike

4779
03:16:02,280 --> 03:16:04,280
it's about fucking time you came back to the show.

4780
03:16:04,280 --> 03:16:06,280
Thanks for being here. I literally haven't seen you

4781
03:16:06,280 --> 03:16:08,280
in years. Even if you are so mean to me

4782
03:16:08,280 --> 03:16:10,280
all of the time. But that's alright.

4783
03:16:10,280 --> 03:16:12,280
I am mean to you all the time.

4784
03:16:12,280 --> 03:16:14,280
It's like my second favorite thing to do.

4785
03:16:14,280 --> 03:16:16,280
But it comes out of a place of love, or at least

4786
03:16:16,280 --> 03:16:18,280
it better.

4787
03:16:18,280 --> 03:16:20,280
Okay, we can go with that.

4788
03:16:20,280 --> 03:16:22,280
You dick. Alright.

4789
03:16:22,280 --> 03:16:24,280
Gamebuoy.org if they want to hear

4790
03:16:24,280 --> 03:16:26,280
your own show.

4791
03:16:26,280 --> 03:16:28,280
Which I take back every nice thing I said about it

4792
03:16:28,280 --> 03:16:30,280
earlier in the show.

4793
03:16:30,280 --> 03:16:32,280
It's terribly unlikely given how big of a dick I've been

4794
03:16:32,280 --> 03:16:34,280
tonight. But on the off chance

4795
03:16:34,280 --> 03:16:36,280
anyone does care

4796
03:16:36,280 --> 03:16:38,280
Gamebuoy.org

4797
03:16:38,280 --> 03:16:40,280
Gaming news and views that aren't on your radar

4798
03:16:40,280 --> 03:16:42,280
but maybe should be. We'd really

4799
03:16:42,280 --> 03:16:44,280
appreciate the hits. And I just

4800
03:16:44,280 --> 03:16:46,280
want to say so much. Thank all three of you

4801
03:16:46,280 --> 03:16:48,280
so much for having me here tonight. It's actually

4802
03:16:48,280 --> 03:16:50,280
been quite a bit of fun and I really

4803
03:16:50,280 --> 03:16:52,280
do wish it hadn't been like seven years since

4804
03:16:52,280 --> 03:16:54,280
the last time I was on. Well, make

4805
03:16:54,280 --> 03:16:56,280
better and come back on a more regular basis

4806
03:16:56,280 --> 03:16:58,280
at some point. I would love to.

4807
03:16:58,280 --> 03:17:00,280
Fantastic. Love it. Alright.

4808
03:17:00,280 --> 03:17:02,280
Well, we're going to go around

4809
03:17:02,280 --> 03:17:04,280
and get everybody's final thoughts so we can close up

4810
03:17:04,280 --> 03:17:06,280
shop tonight. Um, Loki

4811
03:17:06,280 --> 03:17:08,280
who doesn't have a microphone. Loki, do you

4812
03:17:08,280 --> 03:17:10,280
have a final thought tonight? I wish my microphone

4813
03:17:10,280 --> 03:17:12,280
worked.

4814
03:17:12,280 --> 03:17:14,280
Fair enough. Uh, Dark Soccer, your final

4815
03:17:14,280 --> 03:17:16,280
thought tonight. My throat feels like a desert.

4816
03:17:16,280 --> 03:17:18,280
Uh, and my final thought

4817
03:17:18,280 --> 03:17:20,280
tonight is Haters to the left.

4818
03:17:20,280 --> 03:17:22,280
Uh.

4819
03:17:22,280 --> 03:17:24,280
Captain

4820
03:17:24,280 --> 03:17:26,280
Spike, your final thought tonight.

4821
03:17:28,280 --> 03:17:30,280
I hate you so much.

4822
03:17:30,280 --> 03:17:32,280
And last but not

4823
03:17:32,280 --> 03:17:34,280
least, Tim, your final thought tonight.

4824
03:17:34,280 --> 03:17:36,280
Um,

4825
03:17:36,280 --> 03:17:38,280
I just ate some potato chips that taste

4826
03:17:38,280 --> 03:17:40,280
like they're Doritos and they taste

4827
03:17:40,280 --> 03:17:42,280
like Doritos

4828
03:17:42,280 --> 03:17:44,280
tacos and in the computer science

4829
03:17:44,280 --> 03:17:46,280
world we call that recursion.

4830
03:17:46,280 --> 03:17:48,280
Recursive

4831
03:17:48,280 --> 03:17:50,280
chips. Love

4832
03:17:50,280 --> 03:17:52,280
it. Thank you guys so much for downloading

4833
03:17:52,280 --> 03:17:54,280
and listening to our show or listening to it live or however

4834
03:17:54,280 --> 03:17:56,280
you participate. Thank you for being a part of

4835
03:17:56,280 --> 03:17:58,280
Orange Lounge Radio. If you like what you heard,

4836
03:17:58,280 --> 03:18:00,280
all we ask is tell a friend or two about

4837
03:18:00,280 --> 03:18:02,280
the show because we don't have, you know, $35,000

4838
03:18:02,280 --> 03:18:04,280
to promote our show. No tea, no

4839
03:18:04,280 --> 03:18:06,280
shade. All tea, all shade. Shade that wave.

4840
03:18:06,280 --> 03:18:08,280
I'm totally judging right now.

4841
03:18:08,280 --> 03:18:10,280
Uh, but, uh, we would really appreciate it.

4842
03:18:10,280 --> 03:18:12,280
Leave a five star review on iTunes.

4843

4846
03:18:18,280 --> 03:18:20,280
a game you guys. Uh, spread

4847
03:18:20,280 --> 03:18:22,280
