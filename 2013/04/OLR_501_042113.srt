With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Tonight, April 21st, 2013, Nintendo announces a sequel to one of their classics. Could a cancelled TV show be brought back for the new Xbox? And an old, unreleased Sega console is unearthed.

Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 501 for this, April the 21st of 2013.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's our Blue Jeans episode, I guess you could say, coming off a high from last week in our 500th episode.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That's so 80s, they don't really use that marketing anymore, do they?

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Well, hi there, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. I don't know if they use that marketing anymore. I don't know if that's a thing.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I remember those commercials where they would sing the blues, but then it was the 501 blues.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I just remember the Saturday Night Live commercials that were bad idea jeans. That was...

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yeah.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Do they have those classic clips on YouTube, or did NBC pull them all? Because if they have it on YouTube, look it up.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I have no idea. Well, they had a bunch of them on Hulu, like you could watch a lot of the goth talks and...

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Oh, okay.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
...cluffy talk.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The funny people were on Saturday Night Live, like Chris Farley.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The funny people were on Saturday Night Live my senior year of high school.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Or, I mean, to be fair, before somebody snaps at us, if you're not talking about the originals from 75...

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The, what, not ready for primetime players?

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yeah, nodding my head at that, because clearly they...

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Because, hello Belushi.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
But I wasn't born yet, so...

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
But I have come to appreciate, after all this time, Gilda Radner, comic genius. Love that woman.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Ah, yeah.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And they were all great, really.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
But, 1994. Best year of SNL.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Without a doubt.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Good stuff. Good stuff.

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'll say hello to Techmaster Loki.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Hi.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Did you ever watch Saturday Night Live back in the day?

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Uh...

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I've watched it off and on.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
There was, you know, a time where there was a lot of people in there that, you know, I thought were funny,

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and then I stopped watching them after a while, because I'm like, ah, they're not funny anymore,

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
and then I came back, and they're like, oh, okay, you're funny again.

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Now we're kind of at that, oh, they're not funny anymore.

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Well, I don't really watch it anymore. Like, if really funny things happen, the internet blows up about it,

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
and there's clips on Hulu, but I remember back in the day, like when I was in junior high school,

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
that was the thing, was staying up late on Saturday night to watch Saturday Night Live,

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
and like, could you get all the way, could you stay up late enough to make it to the end of the show,

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
or do you fall asleep after Weekend Update?

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Really? You had that much problem?

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yeah.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
For me, my Friday night, going into Saturday morning, was, um...

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
In junior high, yes, I had that problem.

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Oh, well, this was high school, okay.

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Okay.

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It was a pot of coffee, probably two, and it was Saturday Night Live, followed by Headbangers Ball,

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
followed by 120 Minutes.

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So I would, like, listen to, like, Pantera and all that all night, and then go into The Cure.

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Ah.

54
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And I love my prog rock.

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Nice.

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Oh, we're going to have a Kate Bush revival tonight.

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Good times.

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yes, welcome to my senior year.

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I remember there were some video games based off Saturday Night Live.

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It was the Wayne's World game, which was awful.

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Oh, the Wayne's World game was awful.

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It was awful.

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Bringing it back to video games, which the show is about,

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
with you guys live in our chat room, the always present fourth guest on our show,

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
live.vognetwork.com in our chat room, if you want to join us here,

66
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
as we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com,

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackall show.

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So tying it back to games, Saturday Night Live games,

69
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
there was a Blues Brothers game, I'm pretty sure, too.

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yes.

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
When they had that movie, when they had the Blues Brothers 2000 or whatever,

72
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
there was that.

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Were there other Saturday Night Live movies?

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Now I'm just imagining what if there was an It's Pat game.

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Did you ever see the movie, though?

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It was weird.

77
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I watched part of it, and I was like, the hell is this crap?

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You know, the Wayne's World movies were great, but not a good game.

79
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com, Fifth Dream,

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
in our chat, says, Keir Cross Pokemon.

81
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Oh, lord.

82
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Padov's Song, Why Can't I Be Mew?

83
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The Love Me Offs.

84
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Mr. Mime Eyes.

85
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Amakism.

86
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Where the hell did you get this from?

87
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Only the, was that on Tumblr or some shit?

88
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You need to post that somewhere where I can find it on Tumblr

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
and repost that, because...

90
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
That sounds like the type of thing that came off Tumblr.

91
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm sorry, but...

92
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Fifth Dream said it best, though, later on.

93
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I want a John Belushi Samurai game.

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

95
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The Samurai Tailor.

96
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
That was it, right?

97
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Well, there was also the Samurai Butcher.

98
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Oh, that's right.

99
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The Deli.

100
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It was a thing.

101
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It was always him in different things, yeah.

102
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yeah, but I also liked the one of Dana Carvey as...

103
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
God, no, who was it?

104
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
He was being...

105
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Brian Adams, was it?

106
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The Church Lady?

107
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
No, no, no.

108
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Was it?

109
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Satan?

110
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Well, isn't that special?

111
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
No, no, no, no, no.

112
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Listen, it was Dana Carvey.

113
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I think it was being Brian Adams or somebody singing the broccoli song.

114
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Chopping broccoli.

115
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Whatever happened to Dana Carvey?

116
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I don't know.

117
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Like, I see him on billboards.

118
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
He performs in, like, Tahoe now, and I'm like, oh, it's so unfortunate.

119
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I don't know.

120
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Poor guy.

121
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
All right, anyhow.

122
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
From old school SNL people to video games.

123
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Real quick before we get into our gaming week, so I'll make this quick.

124
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
We had a big show last week, so this week might be a little easier.

125
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Taking it easy.

126
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
They had an Austin Powers game.

127
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That's sort of...

128
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Oh, they did.

129
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
That's sort of Saturday Night Live.

130
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Sort of.

131
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Sort of.

132
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Thank you for looking that up.

133
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I wanted to throw this out there real quick.

134
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Technically, this was the other show that I do under the OLR Studios banner, which is

135
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Horde House, but I just want to give this a shout out because I thought this was great.

136
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
This morning was that multiple sclerosis walk, and I've talked about it on this show a couple

137
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
of times.

138
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
That finally happened this morning, and a great turnout and great participation from

139
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
some folks here locally and the internet and the WoW community and the gaming community

140
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
in general raised over $1600, if you can believe it, for multiple sclerosis research.

141
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
That is great.

142
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's awesome.

143
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It is awesome.

144
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So now the goal next year is to outdo that.

145
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
We're going to push 2K next year, so watch yourselves.

146
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'll do it next year.

147
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
But now I'm thinking, you know, I had so much fun doing that, that we need to think of something

148
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
OLR charity related, like six months from now.

149
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So it's like, you know, Horde House, OLR, Horde House.

150
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But we're going to have to think of something to get involved with.

151
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I want to do one of the autism charities that is not autism speaks because they're assholes.

152
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Controversy!

153
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
But whatever, whatever, we'll find a charity that's near and dear to our causes here.

154
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
We need to have a car wash.

155
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You want to have a car wash?

156
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The OLR car wash.

157
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
We need something the whole internet can get involved with, though.

158
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
We'll put it on live cam.

159
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Alright, whatever.

160
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What else is I going to say about all that?

161
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Oh, I want to give a shout out to one of our listeners, Evan, who I met today who drove

162
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
up from Bakersfield to come walk with us and was a huge donor and a huge part of that effort.

163
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
So I know he participates more with Horde House.

164
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I don't see him in his OLR chat as much, but I want to say give a shout out to Evan.

165
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It was great to meet you today.

166
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I like meeting OLR fans and sometimes I meet them in very random places.

167
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Is that the Evan that just friended me on Facebook yesterday?

168
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Probably.

169
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Did he have a Liara pic?

170
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Oh, no, he has a MS pic now.

171
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Yeah, he had a Liara pic and now it's a...

172
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I don't know, but whoever that is, you're nice.

173
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yeah, he's nice.

174
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I met him.

175
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You should have come out today.

176
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You could have met him.

177
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Now he's going to have to come back.

178
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I was busy sleeping.

179
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Honestly, my goal was to get up this morning, but I think I still have like how much booze

180
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
did I drink on my birthday?

181
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
A lot.

182
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
All of it.

183
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Most of it.

184
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So thank you for the beer, by the way.

185
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It was delicious.

186
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You're welcome.

187
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
How was your birthday?

188
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Happy late birthday to Dark Soccer, by the way.

189
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Thank you.

190
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
My birthday was gamey, as in you did not sing any Alanis at my party, Rob.

191
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I know.

192
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
We only made a cameo and I didn't get around to singing Alanis.

193
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm sorry.

194
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But Becky sang alone for me and I ended up singing in the background, I think, because

195
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I was drunk.

196
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I played keyboards for that.

197
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You played keyboards.

198
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It was good.

199
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I downloaded the song just so that Becky would sing it, our resident, very good soprano.

200
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I think I sang Band on the Run once.

201
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
OK, this was the funniest part.

202
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
This happened after you left.

203
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Julian, Becky's son, who is going to be six in like a week or so, he wanted me to sing.

204
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Cute kid.

205
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Him and the other, is that Dan's little cousin?

206
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Cousin's daughter.

207
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
That was Hannah's daughter, Sophia.

208
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
They were cute, being cute kids.

209
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
They were adorable.

210
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,000
But Julian was like, sing the pink robot song, which is Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots.

211
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So about a third through the song, Julian has the chorus memorized.

212
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So he's singing along to the song with me.

213
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And it's like my second favorite song ever in the universe.

214
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And we're sitting here swaying back and forth.

215
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I've got a good three beers and a shot of vodka in me.

216
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So we won't be able to get an encore now?

217
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
No.

218
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And Julian is singing along with me.

219
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And it is seriously the cutest thing that has ever happened in my entire life.

220
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And then Midna decided to come out and be Little Miss Social, which I thought she was

221
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
going to go hide in the back room.

222
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
But no, she's like, oh, my God, people pet me.

223
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
She hates Gary.

224
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Just saying.

225
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
She loves everybody else hated Gary, but he was being addicted.

226
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Gary smell like dog.

227
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Gary was like hissing at her.

228
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Oh, that's not nice.

229
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I was like, you be nice to my cat.

230
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
She's a good girl.

231
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
He's calling her demon.

232
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm like, don't you dare call her that in front of me.

233
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I will slap a bitch.

234
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So, yeah, there's a lot of alcohol, a lot of alcohol because.

235
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Oh, my God, Amanda, I love you forever.

236
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
She brought mocha vodka, like the good, expensive mocha vodka.

237
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Wasn't she supposed to be here tonight?

238
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Amanda?

239
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
No, she said she couldn't do it this night.

240
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
She had to do it later night because she has something Depeche Mode going on.

241
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You know, she does a lot of blogging for Depeche Mode.

242
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
That's awesome.

243
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And she's going to like seven of their shows.

244
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Wow.

245
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
OK, well, she wants like like a series of twelve shows in Germany last year.

246
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I wish I could do that.

247
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Get your fangirl on.

248
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Well, she saved up forever for it.

249
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
But anyway, so she brought this mocha and I had like four double shots.

250
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And then I had two shots of this amazing, super expensive, like we're talking $100 plus bottle of tequila.

251
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
What?

252
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
That purple bottle that George had.

253
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Oh, my God.

254
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Oh, my God.

255
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's tequila that I don't hate.

256
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It still kicked my ass.

257
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I almost got you, Patron.

258
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You know what?

259
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You know what, Rob?

260
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I will tell I'm going to tell you this for future reference.

261
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
No tequila.

262
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
But I thought you liked Patron.

263
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I like Patron OK.

264
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
But do you know how long it took me to drink the last bottle you got me?

265
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
That's true.

266
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
That's true.

267
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I finished it for my birthday last year and you got it for me when I turned 30.

268
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Well, then I must have had a psychic moment because I was going to get it.

269
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And then I was like, you know what, maybe I should just bring beer.

270
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Rob brought me Guinness and Guinness is the best gift ever.

271
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And I'm going to cook steak with it.

272
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
There you go.

273
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So.

274
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
So, yeah, apparently the theme of my birthday was booze, which is pretty much the theme of every birthday every year.

275
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
If I'm not at Disneyland.

276
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And they busted out.

277
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
George brought his Wii U and that Injustice game, whatever that DC game is.

278
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You know how I feel about DC.

279
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:25,000
But it was actually kind of neat, except I thought that the character models were supremely bizarre.

280
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I've heard a lot of good things about Injustice, but not on the Wii U.

281
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's interesting to me that that was the platform you got exposed to it on because I've heard the Wii U one is a little weak compared to the others.

282
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Well, I had no basis of comparison and I'm sitting here like.

283
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And I'm I'm just I'm just copy pasting Internet hearsay.

284
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So I'm catching the end of the game when like three of my friends are passed out from booze and I'm sitting there sobering because you know how quickly that happens for me.

285
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
So I'm like watching this game and going, what the hell is up with Wonder Woman's hair?

286
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
That's the only thing I could focus on was Wonder Woman's hair.

287
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And that there were two Batmans.

288
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
When I was playing Mortal Kombat versus DC Universe, I was a little fixated on how weird Wonder Woman was, too.

289
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And then like Joker looked bizarre, but it was the right Batman. It was Kevin Conroy.

290
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Oh, nice.

291
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
So it was the right Batman. So. So, yeah.

292
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And then let me go to some quick comments from our chat room here.

293
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Actdeft in chat says Midna technically is a demon, though. I mean, she's the Twilight Princess.

294
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
No, she's an imp.

295
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
She's my baby.

296
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Other comments in our chat room at Live.VogueNetwork.com.

297
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Fifth Dream says The Cure and Depeche Mode in one podcast. It's like Goth Lounge radio.

298
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
No way. We're progressive. We're progressive.

299
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm going to attack the darkness.

300
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Let's see. Tiger Claw in our chat saying Injustice is pretty awesome. I beat the story mode.

301
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Well, you see, it was Gary was playing it, but I didn't care because I was watching it.

302
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And so. The big thing I remember is Amanda waking up in time to go,

303
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
that's where Depeche Mode is in this game and going to sleep.

304
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
So now I remember that the end song was done by Depeche Mode and it was actually a really neat song.

305
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
So. So, yeah, I mean, it was mostly, you know, a lot of us hanging out in the in the kitchen,

306
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
in the dining room, staring at the evil bell pepper pizza.

307
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Oh, my God, it was so good. So gross. I had to pick all the peppers off because I'm allergic.

308
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,000
And then just drinking and then children running all over the place.

309
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But cute children who don't piss me off. So it was good.

310
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
So that was my birthday. Well, I was going to ask about your gaming week, but I did a lot of it.

311
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
All right. Well, then why not? We'll just do our gaming weeks.

312
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Well, Catastrophic Moggy gave me that Sam and Max game on steam and resonance.

313
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And one other game I downloaded everything.

314
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And I played some of the game. I'm not supposed to talk about trademark.

315
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Oh, my God, I'm in love. I'm quitting. Well, so I.

316
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Well, I play. Oh, yeah, I live streamed Mass Effect two.

317
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And so what I'm going to do, since we don't have anybody on Thursday, we don't have any shows on Thursday,

318
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:12,000
is that I'm just going to play through Mass Effect two on the stream so that people can hear me talk shit about the characters,

319
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
which is basically all shame was there for that. And basically is all I do now when I play.

320
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
When I play any of the Mass Effect games is that I talk back to the characters and I'm pretty rude to most of them.

321
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's sort of like, what is my shepherd's inner monologue?

322
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,000
So if people want to see a play through where they're not talking back, don't look at your channel because you're a talker.

323
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Well, no, it's like I'll play it mostly quiet, but sometimes somebody will say something.

324
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And it's like because you know how I feel about a good portion of the writing and I will just go what or good.

325
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
No one cares what you have to say, Jacob. You know, move on. And it's that type of commentary.

326
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
OK, I'm sort of MST three king it as I play. Fair enough. Yeah, I'm done.

327
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It's the dark soccer experience. I've had pinkberry and coffee and I'm very hyper.

328
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Excuse me. Couldn't tell. All right. Say hello as well to Loki.

329
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And how was your gaming week? Let's see my game week. I played Defiance.

330
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I played lots of Defiance, actually. And I'm up to three hundred and forty now.

331
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,000
They don't really have like levels. It's just like size level. I should maybe get this game.

332
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's pretty fun. Yeah. Yeah. They don't have, like I said, levels.

333
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's just like your power level, I guess. Dragon Ball Z ish. But because you can do stuff.

334
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I mean, you do level up and your power goes up by so much.

335
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
But you can do other things that level or raise your power level as well.

336
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Like they have side stuff like very much like borderlands.

337
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I mean, the whole game is very similar to the borderlands as far as the whole style of the game.

338
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
And so you can do like these time challenge, you know.

339
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,000
OK, this is a rampage and you have to kill this many people in this amount of time.

340
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And it's kind of its own instance thing. And then there's also like races and stuff, which sucks because

341
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
when I first attempted some of these races, I was actually doing pretty well on them.

342
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
But there was like some sort of lag in it, like I'd finished the race in the correct amount of time.

343
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
But it would add two seconds to the clock every time. It wasn't like I was missing a pylon or something like that.

344
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It would just lag out, I guess. I don't know. It was weird.

345
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Thankfully, I did manage to hit silver on this, which is what you have to do to get your extra experience and levels and stuff.

346
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
But it's pretty fun.

347
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
The only thing I don't really like about it because I have some guns that I find that are really fun to use and stuff.

348
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
But once you've maxed up the level on those guns, you stop gaining experience on that weapon class.

349
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:55,000
So I have to switch to a different saw now or a different light machine gun, I guess, to keep leveling that skill up.

350
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:04,000
But it's fun. Last night I stayed up until midnight playing, basically going from one arc fall to the next.

351
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's okay. They're kind of getting a little boring because it's the same boss enemy that you're fighting each time.

352
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Although I did find one that was a different boss bug thing that you fought. Actually, it was three of them. Three different types now.

353
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
But they're always this boss bug thing that you have to fight.

354
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It's alright, but I wish they had a little bit more variety to it. Maybe that will come out later on.

355
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I did notice though, one of the things that they are doing is they have specific challenges for the entire season and then specific challenges for each episode.

356
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:46,000
So as the episodes play on TV, you get different stuff that ties in with the episodes on TV.

357
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
They have certain challenges that you have to do and stuff. So I thought that was kind of cool.

358
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
So yeah, I've really been just playing a lot of that.

359
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It's kind of fun because it's one of those games where you may not necessarily want to play with anybody and you can do that.

360
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm pretty much soloing the whole game myself, but it's just the way they have the partying. It's not even really partying.

361
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It's just you kind of go to the same area as other people and you just kind of help out and you get experience for it.

362
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And you get your own loot and you don't have to fight over it because everybody gets loot that drops exclusively for them.

363
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
And that's it. Whatever you see on the ground is yours.

364
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
That's kind of like Diablo. I'm starting to see that in other MMOs. I want to say Guild Wars did that too. I can't remember.

365
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Or Guild Wars 2, excuse me.

366
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's kind of fun. So I have gotten some clan invites and stuff, but I just don't feel like joining the clan or something.

367
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You're a loner.

368
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Well, it's not that. I would be fine joining clans and talking with them and stuff.

369
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:48,000
But my wife reads or plays on the computer and she hates it when I talk over the headset while I'm playing games.

370
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Because I have my noise canceling headphones on and so I tend to be loud because I think I'm talking on normal volume.

371
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
But I can't hear myself because I have a headset on or headphones on.

372
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
So yeah, it's been pretty fun. So I've been playing that.

373
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I played a little bit of more Modern Warfare 3 just because I've been having trouble fighting.

374
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Well, I want to play Defiance during work, like on lunch.

375
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
But our internet sucks where we're located right now.

376
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:26,000
One of the wireless hubs is over there that is not working so I can't get internet on my Xbox 360 over there.

377
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
So I've been doing kind of like the survival modes in Modern Warfare 3 and that's been kind of fun.

378
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
And multiplayer deathmatch when we can't get enough people over there.

379
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
And really, I think that was it this week. It's been pretty much just Defiance, just playing that.

380
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Alright, well, those MMO type of games will take up a bit of time.

381
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Yeah, I'm having fun even though it is very bland looking and it's not a whole lot of variety to it,

382
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
but it's entertaining enough to keep me interested in it.

383
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Well, my gaming week, not a whole lot of new stuff. I revisited a few old things.

384
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I played World of Warcraft, of course, because I do that a lot. Still doing PvP and having fun with it.

385
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I did cancel Final Fantasy XI, which I talked a little more about on Hoard House, but Shane was very upset.

386
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,000
But he's coping and I'm waiting for Civ 5 to go on sale so he can do his half of the bargain. That'll be fun.

387
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Other old games I revisited, I random, super random started playing Dota 2 because I hadn't really ever played it.

388
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Like I've had the game viewer for a while, but hadn't played it myself.

389
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
And the nice thing is in Dota 2, you can set up a bot game because I'm like too afraid to play with real people

390
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
because I have no idea what I'm doing and playing with the bots just reinforce that.

391
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
But I was telling another friend of mine about this today and he's like, why are you playing Dota 2?

392
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
You need to play League of Legends with me. I will teach you how to play League of Legends.

393
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:52,000
So Rob will be testing the waters of a few different MOBAs over the next couple weeks and I'll let you know which one I settle on.

394
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:59,000
But I'm kind of curious what you guys out there in the O.L. Army, if you guys are League of Legends, are you Dota 2?

395
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
There's a couple others, right? I'm not thinking of off the top of my head. I know there's the Blizzard All-Stars. That's not out yet.

396
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
There's a couple other MOBAs.

397
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
There's one that's not very good. It's the Guardians of Middle Earth.

398
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:18,000
That's not very good, but it's not really a genre I play.

399
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Otherwise, I played some more Harmonite this week.

400
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
There is another new game I played this week, but you'll have to wait for my review at vognetwork.com on Tuesday.

401
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
So look for that on the site on Tuesday.

402
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And I think that's really about it.

403
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Since there's the Tuesday game and then, wow, it took up most of my time, honestly.

404
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I was busy with out-of-town guests and so forth.

405
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Are you at all interested in the Star Trek game coming out next week?

406
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Yes, I would like to actually check that out.

407
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Star Trek game?

408
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Yeah, it's based in the movie universe. It kind of bridges the first two games together.

409
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Yeah, I've read some stuff about it. I'm interested in it.

410
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Some of the Star Trek games for home have been pretty bad, though.

411
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
They were supposed to have been in development for at least three years.

412
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Well, it was supposed to come out with the first movie, and it didn't.

413
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
So they held it back to make it better or whatever, so let's hope it worked.

414
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Some of the Star Trek games have been real stinkers, but I remember the Next Generation game on Super Nintendo was awesome.

415
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I actually did Star Trek Online until they went free-to-play and ruined the skill system.

416
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I'd like to see a game that plays like that, but on the single player.

417
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I'm looking at our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

418
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I can never say that name. I'm so sorry, guy.

419
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Syle says, I can't MOBA to save my ass.

420
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Let's see. Queen Cymia says, now, I don't really get Dota 2. How did they work that out legally?

421
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
How did they work that out legally?

422
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:59,000
The creators of the Warcraft 3 mod, Valve did their Valve thing and saw this innovation in the modding community, so they hired them.

423
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
That's where Portal came from, right? Valve does this.

424
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
That's where Team Fortress came from. Team Fortress was a Quake mod, right?

425
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
So they do this.

426
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
So they hired them to make Dota 2.

427
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Obviously, Blizzard was not a fan of that, but they settled, as these legal things usually go.

428
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Blizzard is going to call their game Blizzard All-Stars now, is their MOBA game.

429
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
And League of Legends was never called anything in the same category,

430
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:31,000
but I believe someone else involved with the original Dota mod is with the League of Legends team and Riot Games.

431
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I mean, Riot Games is doing very well with League of Legends, so, you know.

432
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
There's plenty of room at the table for all of them, apparently.

433
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Prince Brightstar in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,

434
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
If you want a free-to-play that isn't pay-to-win, PSO2 is a great game.

435
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I'm dying to play PSO2, but you must be playing the Japanese version, right?

436
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Because it's not out here yet, right?

437
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
No, I don't think they're remotely doing betas yet.

438
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I signed up for the beta ages ago, but I don't think that we're even close to US beta.

439
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Yeah, I am thinking that's an E3 thing. I'm thinking Sega's sitting on it till E3.

440
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
They have nothing. There's literally nothing on the table for them coming out.

441
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Well, I tell you what, there's nothing on the table for them coming out right now except for a couple PC titles.

442
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:17,000
But there's nothing. They have no announcements so far. There's nothing pending.

443
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Speaking of Sega, I did overlook an iOS game I played a little bit this week, Sonic Dash.

444
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
It's free on iOS. It is Temple Run Sonic. That is all it is.

445
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
If you want your Temple Run with Sonic rings, there you go.

446
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I actually find it to be, I mean, the pros of Sonic Dash is that, oh, Sonic, pretty, bright, vibrant compared to Temple Run, which is a little bit drab.

447
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I mean, I love Temple Run and Temple Run 2, but it's kind of a drab palette in those games.

448
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Sonic is very bright, vibrant. Characters you know. The ring sound is always refreshing to use that.

449
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:00,000
But then I do find it as a game and so forth to be under polished compared to Temple Run, which isn't.

450
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Because, like, Pitfall was really well done for a Temple Run ripoff.

451
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:11,000
It's very interesting to see all these, like, established franchises kind of ripping on what's going on now that's popular.

452
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
It's really fascinating to me how that kind of comes full circle.

453
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
You actually indirectly reminded me of another game that I started.

454
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Final Fantasy Dimensions for iOS.

455
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Oh, that's a good one.

456
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I only just started it, but it's cute. It's very old school.

457
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
The control's interesting.

458
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
The good news about that one is that it's free.

459
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
But if you like that one, that's very similar to what Final Fantasy.

460
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I'll get five.

461
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Yeah, what five looks like.

462
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Yeah. But I don't want to pay seventeen bucks for it yet.

463
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I didn't mention it in my week because I haven't gotten it yet, but my Ouya has shipped, apparently, via DHL.

464
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
So there is a chance that I may get it.

465
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
So you'll get it next year.

466
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
You'll get it eventually. Maybe in time for Christmas.

467
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Anyhow, that's it for my gaming week. I've said enough.

468
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,000
So just quick housekeeping. Not a lot. We don't have any off shows coming up soon.

469
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Maybe gone Memorial Day weekend, though. I might be out of town.

470
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
But that's not until the end of May, so we'll keep you posted.

471
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Well, if you go to Disneyland, take me.

472
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
No, I'm not going to. I don't have a pass anymore.

473
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
So?

474
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
If I go to Disneyland, the next time I will probably go is in E3.

475
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I still have to figure all that out, which, you know, I've been a bad boy.

476
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
We should do DisCon.

477
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
There's two parts to registration. I've done the first part, but not the second part because I need to get off my ass and do it.

478
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
But I keep getting distracted with all this other stuff.

479
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,000
But regardless of whether I go to E3 or not, Bobby's going to represent VOG.

480
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
And there's a very good chance I'll go down there and go to Disneyland with him like we did last year, right?

481
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
We went to Tronica and all that.

482
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Yeah. I'm actually kind of sort of interested in the Mad Tea Party now.

483
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Just because I've seen... I have friends that ship the Mad Tea Party.

484
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Yeah. No. Sorry, guys. No. Mad Flop Party. Always and forever.

485
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Electronica for life. All right.

486
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Okay. So Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.

487
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Twitter. Twitter.com slash OLR.

488
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Please follow us in our fan communities.

489
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
And next week on the show, if all goes according to plan, which I don't see why it won't,

490
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,000
two longtime friends of mine who I've been trying to get on the show for years are finally going to be here next week.

491
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Yay!

492
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
And I'm really excited about it.

493
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
One of them hosts another podcast that you all ought to be listening to.

494
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
And I'll tell you more about that next week.

495
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Tease, tease.

496
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
We should all do lunch.

497
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
We will try to work it out.

498
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Twerk it.

499
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
All right.

500
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Let us get into the gaming news this week.

501
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
There was a lot of news out of Nintendo this week, right, Logie?

502
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Yes. A lot of stuff.

503
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
They have their special Nintendo Direct thing that was all 3DS.

504
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Mostly 3DS, I suppose.

505
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
3DS-centric, I guess.

506
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:56,000
And one of the big announcements there is, hey, we're doing a new 3DS game for the Legend of Zelda series on the 3DS.

507
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
And guess what?

508
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
It's a sequel to Link of the Past.

509
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Yeah, we just took the best game we made, and we made a sequel.

510
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I was very, very happy.

511
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,000
And I'm most happy it's not another frickin' remake, that they're doing something different with it.

512
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,000
And I really would urge you guys, if you are a 3DS owner, check out the trailer.

513
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
YouTube doesn't do it justice.

514
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Like, seeing it on 3DS is pretty rad.

515
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Even better than the trailer, they actually have some leaked gameplay of it.

516
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
And check that out.

517
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
There's, I think, at least five minutes of gameplay, and it looks pretty awesome.

518
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
But it takes place in the same world as Link of the Past.

519
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:39,000
In fact, actually, there were some people on NeoGaf, I think, that actually took some of the screenshots from the video

520
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
and lined it up with some of the stuff that's in-game.

521
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
And yes, there are a few minor changes, but yes, the map is pretty much the same.

522
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Or at least it appears that's going to be what happened.

523
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
So that's pretty awesome.

524
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
And then a whole lot of other stuff.

525
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
So first off, you've got Pikmin 3.

526
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
We were wondering when the hell this was supposed to come out.

527
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,000
It was supposed to be a near-launch launch window title for the Wii U.

528
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I'm still not sure if it's launch window, because it is now August 4th.

529
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Game and Wario now coming out June 23rd.

530
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:25,000
There's going to be a brand new system update for the Wii U, I guess, pretty soon this coming week.

531
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,000
And it's supposed to add some stuff that they were teasing about before on some of the other Nintendo Directs.

532
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
One of those being the ability to install updates while playing other games.

533
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
So you're going to be able to install software and updates and that kind of stuff.

534
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:48,000
And also improve load times from starting new apps up to switching between stuff and returning back to the Wii U menu.

535
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Also, if you hold the B button, when you start the system up, it will go into Wii mode.

536
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
In case you want to play a Wii game, you don't have to take all those extra steps, I guess.

537
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
So you can play with your Wii easier?

538
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Yes. And you'll be able to transfer data between USB drives and some other stuff.

539
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
So that's kind of neat.

540
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Let's see...

541
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Also, to kind of coincide with the whole Legend of Zelda announcement,

542
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:21,000
they're going to be putting up Legend of Zelda Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons on the 3DS eShop.

543
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
That's May 30th.

544
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Wii U virtual consoles coming out next week as well.

545
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
They're going to be...

546
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Which game are they launching with here?

547
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Doesn't say what the brand new game is, but basically the launch line up.

548
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Excitebike, Super Mario World, Mario Brothers, Punch-Out!, Super Metroid, Balloon Fight, F-Zero, and GBA games and Nintendo 64 games planned later on.

549
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
New Yoshi Island game coming to the 3DS.

550
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I'm not sure if that's going to tie in with that new Yoshi yarn type game that they have coming out later on.

551
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
But they showed a little bit of footage of it and it looks just like Yoshi Island.

552
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Mario and Donkey Kong minis on the move coming to the eShop on May 9th.

553
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:19,000
New Super Luigi U DLC coming to New Super Mario Brothers U later in the summer.

554
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
New Mario Party is supposed to be coming out this fall.

555
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Mario and Luigi Dream Team coming out in Europe July 12th in North America August 11th.

556
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I think Jamie and I want to piggyback on this with a few other announcements and then we'll kind of break this down a little bit because it was a very busy conference.

557
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,000
But one of the other things announced here is that the Wii U is going to get the spring system update next week is happening.

558
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
So that's nice. That's happening very soon.

559
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
This is going to be the one that helps improve the loading times dramatically apparently.

560
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Changing between the different software is supposed to get better.

561
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Yeah because it's super slow right now.

562
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Yeah it's not that great right now.

563
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Some other little features you might not have known about.

564
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I mean that's the one everybody's waiting for but also you're going to be able to transfer data between the USB drives.

565
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,000
And you can install background downloaded software while playing other games.

566
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I didn't realize you couldn't do that now.

567
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I thought you could do like remember because remember the system updates you can kind of install those while you're playing.

568
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Well regardless that whole thing is going to get better so that's good.

569
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
And the Wii U will continue to download and install software while the system is powered down.

570
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Which you don't have to go set yourself on that screen and wait for it to do it.

571
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I mean these are all things that seem very logical in this day and age so thankfully they're catching up there.

572
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:39,000
You can also, this is pretty cool, hold the B button at the start up to go right into the Wii mode.

573
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
So like if you just got Pandora's Tower or something and you're playing it on your Wii U.

574
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
It's a great way for you to just bypass all the crap and go right into the Wii if you want.

575
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
It's stupid that you can't just, can you just put in like a Wii game into your system and have it just boot up?

576
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
No it has to go into the Wii shell because I think the way the console-

577
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
That's so dumb.

578
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
No I think the way the console's built is that they have the, I think you have a Wii in there to do all that.

579
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
But that's still really dumb.

580
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:11,000
It's weird but I mean if they're using different graphics processors and all that then I get it.

581
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I mean it's weird but it might just not be technically possible.

582
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I think Loki touched on this a little bit talking about some of those Virtual Console releases.

583
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
But just to confirm, Virtual Console happens on Wii U next week.

584
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Launch Lineup, Excitebike, Mario World, Mario Brothers, Punch Out, Super Metroid, Balloon Fight and F-Zero.

585
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Some of those games have already come out through the 30 Cent program.

586
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Like I know F-Zero is one of those, Balloon Fight, Punch Out.

587
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Some of these haven't happened yet though. Super Mario World isn't one of them and I don't think it's in the lineup.

588
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
No.

589
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I think, is the next game Super Metroid? No the next game's like a Yoshi game I think.

590
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I was gonna say Super Mario World, that's like 30 cents, hell yeah.

591
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
But GBA Games, a part of this, which is cool because that wasn't on Wii.

592
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
You didn't have GBA Games on Wii, you had them on DS, 3DS, but not Wii.

593
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
And I think you only got Advance games through the Ambassador program.

594
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Have they done Advance games? I don't even know. I don't think they have.

595
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
So this could be interesting, what'll happen there. Don't know why they wouldn't.

596
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Yeah, Nintendo 64 games coming out in the future as well.

597
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Which were on the Wii, so you know, for most people it'll be an upgrade I suppose.

598
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
And then Dark Soccer, I think you have a Whopper bit of news for us too right?

599
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Yes I do, if Bobby will stop spoiling.

600
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Seriously, stop telling about the future. You know what happens, you watch Doctor Who don't you?

601
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Anyway, Earthbound is going to be coming out in North America and Europe as in Mother 2, as it was in Japan.

602
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:47,000
It will be on the Wii U Virtual Console towards the end of the year.

603
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,000
And there's not a, I don't see that there is an actual release date on it yet.

604
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,000
But I'm expecting them to have a date out before E3.

605
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I mean, unless they're saving that date for E3 or whatever the hell they're doing.

606
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
That'd be a pretty good bullet point in E3 Ants about it.

607
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Well that could be one of those things where it's like, oh yeah remember how we said Earthbound was coming out?

608
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Go get it, it's up now, right now.

609
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
No, why don't we get Mother 3?

610
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Well you know the fan translators offered to give it to Nintendo for free, but legally I don't think that can happen.

611
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Why if they agree to it? I don't see what...

612
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I think it's just weird territory.

613
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Because they had to do things that Nintendo doesn't endorse per the terms of license in order to mod the game.

614
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Like dumping a cartridge to your computer is not something you're supposed to do to begin with.

615
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
It's not in your user agreement that is that fine print in the manual.

616
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
So I think if Nintendo were to legally acknowledge that, it puts them in a really weird place.

617
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Yeah but people do a lot of stuff they're not supposed to do all the time.

618
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I know right.

619
00:35:51,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I think that they would find a way around it if they wanted to find a way around it.

620
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
It's their property, they can give the permission. But, leaving it there.

621
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
But I'm excited even though I already have it.

622
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Yeah I'm excited about Earthbound 2 just because it's a much...

623
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
For those of us that don't have a cartridge lying around, which I don't anymore.

624
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Now I'm kicking myself for selling this shit years ago.

625
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
But it's a nice way to pick it up again.

626
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
And the Wii U Virtual Console is pretty good.

627
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:33,000
They pulled it off very well, the sound sounds great out of the four speakers between your TV and the gamepad.

628
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Well I need to come over and actually just sit and play the Wii U for a while.

629
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:44,000
But we're probably holding out for the PS4 ourselves.

630
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
We're pretty... So far that's where we're landing at home.

631
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Okay.

632
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Alright well, so we're curious. There was a lot of Nintendo news.

633
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I'm curious in here in the room, what were you guys most jazzed about from the Nintendo...

634
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Well first off, I should take a big step back.

635
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Because Loki, you're the biggest critic of Nintendo on this show.

636
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Were you moved at all by this Nintendo Direct? Or were you like, meh?

637
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I'm the biggest critic of everybody.

638
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Okay fair enough.

639
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
None of the news... I mean once again I'm not gonna go buy a system.

640
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I'm not gonna go get a 3DS again just for Legend of Zelda.

641
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I think it's cool that they're doing that game.

642
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
A lot of the other announcements I couldn't really care about.

643
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I mean like Yoshi's Island. Eh, whatever. It was cool.

644
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
You know, do a sequel I guess.

645
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I'm just... I mean at the same time I like that they're doing sequels to their old titles.

646
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
But I kinda wish there was something new.

647
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Like, just something new from Nintendo.

648
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Because a lot of it seems to be going back to rehashes of old things.

649
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
And I know everybody loves nostalgia, but I just want something new.

650
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Like a brand new property from Nintendo that doesn't resemble Wii Sports.

651
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
That doesn't resemble Nintendo Land.

652
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
It's not a 2D Mario remake or something like that.

653
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I want something... like Mario Galaxy was a good example of something.

654
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
It's sort of like Mario 64, but...

655
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Yeah, but it was so different.

656
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Exactly.

657
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Yeah, I mean it's Mario, but it's really not. You know?

658
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Yeah, I want something like that.

659
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
You know? That would be...

660
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Even if they put Mario or Link's face on it, you're okay. You just want some new ideas.

661
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Yes, I just want something new.

662
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
I mean, because a lot of... and...

663
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Don't get me wrong. I think that the whole, you know, new Zelda game is pretty awesome, but...

664
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I mean, I guess it is a little bit different.

665
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
It's a different approach to it in the same world and stuff.

666
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
It's all 3D now, but...

667
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
I don't know. I just kinda want something new from them.

668
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I guess. Something innovative.

669
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Ross Steele, UT, in our chatroom says,

670
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I wasn't really jazzed about anything. The 3DS is doing fine.

671
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
We need Wii U news and not fucking Earthbound.

672
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I think there's a reason this is happening now and not at E3.

673
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Because a lot of people are saying, like, shouldn't they have announced the Link to the Past sequel at E3?

674
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:14,000
That seems very weird that they would just on a random day of the week for no reason announce a Zelda sequel.

675
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
You know, it's a pretty big deal.

676
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I'm hoping that means they are clearing space for...

677
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Well, that's what they did last summer. They have three Nintendo Directs and their stupid press conference.

678
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Yeah. Well, also, keep in mind, Nintendo can only really speak to a lot of Nintendo stuff.

679
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
They don't always get into third-party stuff.

680
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
They do, obviously. They do sometimes.

681
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
But, you know, sometimes a lot more third-party information comes out at E3.

682
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Which, considering the Wii U could really use a boost from third parties, that would be a great thing.

683
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Do you think maybe Bayonetta 2, this E3, do you think they've been able to push it out this fast or maybe not?

684
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
No.

685
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
It needs to be on stuff other than the Wii U.

686
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
It won't. It won't.

687
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I know, but it needs to be.

688
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
It won't.

689
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Never say never.

690
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Yeah, never say never.

691
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Never say never. And here's why. Here's why.

692
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Because...

693
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Don't stop believing.

694
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Tecmakoe developed Ninja Gaiden 3 Razor's Edge for the Wii U.

695
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
It was published by Nintendo.

696
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Came out in other systems later on. Published by Tecmakoe.

697
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,000
They could easily, if it flops, and I'm sure...

698
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I'd hope that they have something in there that says, okay, this game flops, so we can put it out on other systems.

699
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I think it'll come out later on. I think it's gonna be like a time delay.

700
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Like, they're gonna have a window or something and then it'll come out later on.

701
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
All five of you who bought a Wii U here a month later. Here, everybody else.

702
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I kinda think they're gonna price drop at E3.

703
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I think that's just what the inevitable thing is gonna happen.

704
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I think they might sneak out the Wii backwards compatibility.

705
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
I don't think a price drop's gonna help.

706
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I mean, it'll help, but it's not gonna be enough.

707
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Because the excuse is, right now, I think there's nothing I can play on it.

708
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
All they have to do is exactly what they did with the 3DS.

709
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
If they do exactly what they did with the 3DS at this E3.

710
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,000
If Reggie comes out on stage and says, you want some fucking games? Here's some fucking games.

711
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
And then bam, bam, bam. It's gonna fix everything.

712
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,000
It's easy to sit here now and say no.

713
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,000
But when he comes out on stage, if he goes F-Zero is fucking happening on the Wii U.

714
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Like, done. Nintendo is saved. Hurry up.

715
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I don't think they're gonna have time because, okay.

716
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,000
But they pulled Mario Kart 7 out of thin air. They pulled the, what was the other game that came out?

717
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Well, let's just say it was being worked on behind the scenes.

718
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Exactly. They could still be working on stuff that we don't know about.

719
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
There's such things as NDAs and people who don't break them.

720
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I just think though that, but right now we know that there's no EA.

721
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,000
For example, there's no EA Sports titles for the Wii U at all. Nothing.

722
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
No Madden. No FIFA. That's it.

723
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
And so far, no NBA 2K either.

724
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,000
So, I mean, I understand if you're thinking about purchasing a new system.

725
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,000
And let's say a lot of mainstream people that buy games do play Madden or do play a sports title.

726
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
You know, not everybody. No, I don't.

727
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
But a lot of people do. And that's kind of disappointing.

728
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
That not, you know, it kind of makes you think, hmm, do I really want to get, you know, a Wii U?

729
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Or do I want to pick up another system that's gonna actually have the games I want on it?

730
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
And it's also a photo of lack of confidence from these publishers.

731
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
And EA being a big publisher, you know, I don't know.

732
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Activision supporting them with garbage right now.

733
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
But they're supporting the Wii U.

734
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
They have the, you know, their Walking Dead game, which is absolute shit.

735
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:29,000
And then followed by the Fast and the Furious showdown, which I'm sure is gonna be awesome.

736
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
And not total shit.

737
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Call of Duty will be coming out, I'm sure.

738
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Let's see. Some comments in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

739
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Strudels89 says, Rob such the optimist.

740
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Well, maybe a little bit. I just don't think they're gonna roll over and let all their critics get the best of them.

741
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
They didn't do it with the 3DS. Again, I'm just, you know...

742
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I understand that, but what is...

743
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Let me say this too, because this is important. This is an important follow-up comment.

744
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Flaco Jones says, another third place finish like the GameCube, but they'll be fine.

745
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:07,000
And I could see that happening, that, you know, maybe the Wii U is not gonna shatter whatever this next Xbox.

746
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Although, if some of these rumors about the next Xbox come to play, I don't know if Nintendo would necessarily be third.

747
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
But Sony's looking pretty good right now out of them all.

748
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
So, you know, even if they did finish third.

749
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,000
And another comment, WhatUpG says Nintendo will be fine because their handheld is doing well. Correct.

750
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
And it does put Nintendo in an interesting position where if they do decide to just, you know...

751
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Okay, Wii U went all Virtual Boy, we're gonna write it off.

752
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:39,000
They might be in an interesting position where they could do another console after whatever Microsoft and PlayStation does, and Sony does, excuse me.

753
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,000
And it's gonna put them in a very interesting position if they fix their mistakes.

754
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
They're not. History has shown they are not gonna fix their mistakes.

755
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I mean, how long has it taken them to understand how to do online?

756
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Something that's been around for a decade now.

757
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I'm not gonna disagree with you there. If they can't get online right, they're doomed.

758
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I'm not gonna disagree with you there.

759
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I still think that no matter what, Nintendo's gonna be fine.

760
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
They're gonna, they're making plenty of money with their handhelds.

761
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I mean, basically, they could just put out a console for shits.

762
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
And say, Hey, look, we have a console. It's called the Lol U.

763
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Lol at U for buying it. I know, right?

764
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:27,000
But either way, I mean, it's, and I've seen people draw comparisons between them and Sega with the Dreamcast.

765
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Which I actually think that that's completely not even close to the same part.

766
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Because what Sega was dealing with, they were coming off the fallout of the Saturn and the very, very awful marketing in the US.

767
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
They also didn't have oodles of money in the bank like Nintendo does.

768
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Exactly.

769
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Don't forget all that Wii money. They made a lot of money on the Wii.

770
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:51,000
The Wii turned a nice little profit because it wasn't the most powerful piece of hardware in the world.

771
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
That money's in the bank.

772
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Yeah.

773
00:44:53,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I mean, even, I'll admit, I was standing in line for my Wii at Target.

774
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
But we also bribed our way into the line with donuts and coffee, me and Kristen.

775
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:13,000
But at the same time, Nintendo is coming off a series of successes, of near failures that they've turned around.

776
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
They don't have that problem with the marketing that Sega came out of.

777
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
I don't really see where the comparison really is.

778
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Except that, okay, so yeah, white systems don't really do very well in the US.

779
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
But look at the Wii.

780
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I don't know what that was because in Japan it was, the Saturn was a silver box.

781
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Over here it was a black box.

782
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Just marketing is weird stuff.

783
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:44,000
All right, well, before we move on to our next story, since this Nintendo Direct was one of the biggest news stories in gaming this week,

784
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:52,000
we do want to take this opportunity to use our new feature on the website and go to a live listener poll.

785
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Let's go to the live listener poll at vognetwork.com.

786
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:03,000
If you are at live.vognetwork.com right now, you can participate in our live poll.

787
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,000
What are you most excited about from this Nintendo Direct?

788
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Here are the answers.

789
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:20,000
OMG Earthbound, OMG Zelda Link to the Past sequel, OMG Yoshi's Island, OMG Super Luigi U, or meh, Nintendo.

790
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Vote now, live.vognetwork.com if you want to participate in the poll, live.vognetwork.com.

791
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
We'll see it right underneath the chat box.

792
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I agree with Bob Coffee.

793
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Sega, he said Sega was dealing with shit management and no Segata Sanchiro.

794
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:41,000
We would have been, okay, I don't know if anyone other than like three of us knows about Segata Sanchiro.

795
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Segata Sanchiro was the mascot of the Saturn in Japan.

796
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:50,000
This guy with floofy hair, wearing a gi, going around punching the hell out of everything.

797
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
And they did a commercial for him for the Dreamcast.

798
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
And there was even a Segata Sanchiro game that came out on Saturn.

799
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,000
If we had Segata Sanchiro, still the Dreamcast would have lived.

800
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Interesting watching the live results of our poll coming in right now.

801
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Mad Nintendo is winning with half the vote right now.

802
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Interesting, watch this as it develops, live.vognetwork.com.

803
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
You do have to be registered at Vognetwork in order to be able to vote in the poll.

804
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Because, you know, there might be some little incentives on the site tied to participating.

805
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
So you should check that out.

806
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Okay, meanwhile, why don't we move on with more news besides just what's going on with Nintendo, right, Loki?

807
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Yes, so there was a series that was on TV that I was really hopeful for.

808
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,000
And then the writer strike happened and the writing went downhill.

809
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
And that was Heroes.

810
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Well, the rumor is that Microsoft wants to bring back Heroes, reboot the whole series.

811
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Obviously with new people because a lot of the cast has moved on to other things.

812
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
But they kind of did this with Heroes on the web.

813
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:03,000
They had like their webisodes or something like that with some different hero characters that the fans designed which were crap.

814
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:13,000
And yeah, so I think it would be kind of cool to see a new series kick off.

815
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Hopefully it just didn't fall into what I like to call the matrix problem.

816
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Where you give a character like Neo way too much power too fast.

817
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:29,000
And you're like, fuck, how do I deal with this next, you know, the next movie or next season?

818
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Crap. Yeah, so you just need to wrap it up slowly.

819
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:40,000
But apparently they're saying that this is going to be part of the whole TV focus.

820
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
And it might be some of the original Xbox programming.

821
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
And I can see this happening, especially since, you know, you have series now.

822
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Well, you have Netflix and Amazon doing like reboots and brand new, you know, exclusive series for those content streamers.

823
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
So it makes sense that they could do that.

824
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:03,000
This certainly leads to the other, you know, interesting discussion that goes with this of what other series could be revived.

825
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Because like, you know, I'm sure a lot of us go Firefly. Can we have Firefly? Can we have more Firefly?

826
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
You know, that's not going to happen because then Joss is just going to kill everybody else.

827
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Yeah. And Fox would never. So Fox will, Fox will just not let it happen just to spite.

828
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I think I saw that horse twitch. I'm going to kick it in its face again.

829
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:27,000
But, you know, it's very interesting kind of where and we'll get into this a little more with our Fugu question of the week later on.

830
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
But it's very interesting with all these, you know, content delivery services coming up with their own programming.

831
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
You see Netflix doing it too with the rest of development. You know, they brought back from the dead.

832
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
And we got Whose Line coming back.

833
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Yeah, that's a CW show.

834
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Yeah, but still I'm saying, you know, there are these series of revivals.

835
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Technically Whose Line is a game show.

836
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:52,000
So it follows, I mean, I know it's kind of not, but it's, I think it actually follows the rules of a game show when it comes to TV.

837
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
So it's a weird, you know, game shows come and go all the time.

838
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:02,000
I am very disappointed that they didn't try to go all meta with, you know, Whose Line and have Bob Barker host it.

839
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
That would have been, did she just have him guest host one episode?

840
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
You know what though? Ayesha Tyler's a great choice.

841
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
And she is. She's a total gamer.

842
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
And she's one of us.

843
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
She's a total gamer, you know, and she's, she's funny. She's really funny. So I'm looking forward to seeing.

844
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
As long as I get my Greg Proops on there from time to time, I'll be happy.

845
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Drew Carey was a great host, but he's got another gig.

846
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:28,000
So, which is weird because Ayesha Tyler does that talk show, but you know, they, they tape like a whole three months worth of shows in a day.

847
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,000
So, you know, they figured out.

848
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
All right. Uh, let me, what else do I want to say with this?

849
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Oh, um, did we talk about what kind of potential extra cost could be if they're going to save a show like Heroes?

850
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:49,000
That's not going to come for free, right? Would that be Xbox Gold? Would maybe I get that as an Xbox Gold member?

851
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Or maybe this is part of a new Xbox Platinum or something? Or what happens?

852
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I don't think that they should be charged. I don't think they'll charge any, well.

853
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Xbox Platinum was that crappy little card that did nothing.

854
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
No, yeah, yeah.

855
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Let's say they ignored it like I did and did it again.

856
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Okay. Well, I don't think, I don't think that they would do that per se.

857
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:14,000
I think that they could do more advertising, but who's to say that they're not going to be fucking greedy and still want more money on top of it?

858
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Although, it's going to be a hard sell if, like say, the PlayStation 4 still has the same type of scheme where it's, you know, regular PlayStation.

859
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:30,000
You get online multiplayer and plus you get, you know, extra stuff.

860
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Because I got to be honest, I mean, I do a lot of gaming on the 360, but I am jealous of, you know, the deal that you get with, you know, PlayStation Plus.

861
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,000
I mean, it's pretty nice with that instant game collection stuff.

862
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:52,000
But I, unfortunately, a lot of my friends are on Xbox Live, so.

863
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Alright. Well, before we get into the next story, I want to go to the results of the live poll that we took earlier.

864
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,000
What are you most excited about from this Nintendo Direct?

865
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:10,000
I got to say, I'm a little surprised with these answers, but this is why we do this, because then as we learn things, the winner of the poll, meh Nintendo, 50% of the vote.

866
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
50% don't care. Interesting.

867
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:28,000
And I was kind of looking in the chat room and just so you know, among the non-meh crowd, 25% of the vote for the Zelda Link to the Past sequel, 18.75% for Earthbound and 6.25% for Super Luigi U.

868
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
So, interesting.

869
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Is that 6% Ronma?

870
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:38,000
It could be. It could be. I don't know. I could look at the results, but I'm not going to look at who voted for what.

871
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:44,000
But I was looking at chat to try to figure out, like, why people are voting the way they are.

872
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:50,000
And it seems like a lot of people are just like, you know, I haven't been convinced that I need to pick up these Nintendo consoles.

873
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
So, you know, this news doesn't really get me excited.

874
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Here's my thing. I understand that they have a certain strategy with announcing titles because they don't know development cycles and how far.

875
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:06,000
They don't want to announce a title, Smash Brothers, well before it's going to come out.

876
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:13,000
But at the same time, I would think that, why would you waste time dicking around when your console's not selling very well?

877
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:24,000
And, you know, if you have stuff to announce, like a price drop, sure, you can wait until E3 and do it and make a little bit of a splash and stuff like that.

878
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:29,000
But I would think it would be in your best interest to help your console now instead of later.

879
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Because the more time you wait, the worse it's going to get for you.

880
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Because say you have someone that's waiting for Wii U, I really want a good title to come out.

881
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
And then it's just like nothing. You don't hear about anything for a long time.

882
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:48,000
You're like, you know what, I'm just going to go get an Xbox. Money's already spent, and aw crap, they announced a good title. Oh well.

883
00:53:48,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Well, what also surprised me about some of the reaction I'm seeing in the chatroom as to why people voted that way is that, you know, a big reason why they do these Nintendo Directs is to get out there on the internet, why you should own a 3DS, because you don't already.

884
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,000
And a Zelda Link to the Past sequel didn't sell that for people yet?

885
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Granted, to be fair, I totally know that people are like, I'm not going to buy a freaking system based off a two minute trailer. Show me the game and then we'll see. I can respect that.

886
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,000
The 3DS, I don't think it has any problems whatsoever saying reasons you need to buy a 3DS.

887
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:27,000
I think that there's plenty of games out there, they've got a lot of really good games, and I think there's plenty of reasons on it.

888
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I'm talking about the Wii U. That isn't there. And if they're going to wait-

889
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
But the Nintendo Direct wasn't about Wii U.

890
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I don't care if it's about the Wii U. The Wii U is hurting and they haven't had an Nintendo Direct about the Wii U. Except for the stupid way.

891
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Oh dirty, you're just Luigi, let's announce all these Luigi things. And the biggest thing they haven't announced was DLC for a game that they already put out.

892
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I mean, you need something that's-

893
00:54:51,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Yeah, but like, I put this Super Luigi U DLC next to some of the DLC that other companies put out. Let's say the Saints Row DLC Loki.

894
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Okay, yes, I'll give you that, but let's put it this way. Hasn't sold any systems. Did we see a big jump in numbers after they made that announcement? No.

895
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:16,000
No, because DLC will keep it afloat and keep people having their Wii U's plugged in, but it's not going to move the system.

896
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:23,000
All that's going to happen is when it gets dropped in price, they'll bundle it with New Super Mario Brothers U Game of the Year Edition or some garbage like that.

897
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:29,000
They'll have the New Luigi U DLC bundled in there. That's all that's going to happen.

898
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Well, we'll see. E3, hopefully a game changer. If not, going to be very interesting next year for Nintendo.

899
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:44,000
I think Falco just made a good point. If the best thing about your next gen system is the release of a nearly 20 year old game, your next gen console sucks.

900
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,000
But that's relying on-

901
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:54,000
But that's only really considering what's coming out of this conference. But I get it, Nintendo needs to light a fire under the Wii U.

902
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:00,000
I'm not going to sit here and defend Nintendo. No, Nintendo needs to get more people excited about the Wii U.

903
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,000
They need to pull the curtain back a little bit on what they're working on, and E3 is the deadline for that to happen.

904
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:11,000
But is it just me, or is there a lot of developers now just sort of banking in on that nostalgia?

905
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Well, why not? We run up to the trough and hit the feeder bar. How much did we all squee about Earthbound linked to the past?

906
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Well, apparently not the listenership, but I know I did.

907
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:33,000
To be honest, I'm not super excited either. I don't have a 3DS, I didn't get one because it gives me a headache.

908
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:43,000
It's really hard for me to put this into words. I want to see something new and exciting, and that's why my attention has been on the indie developers.

909
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Because they're doing the new and exciting.

910
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Ross Steel UT in the chat room saying, why isn't the Link to the Past sequel on the Wii U? That'd help if they didn't ass it up with gimmicks.

911
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Good point. Why not this game that gets people really excited on the Wii U?

912
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,000
My assumption is because we're going to get a Zelda trailer this year.

913
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:07,000
You won't get the new Zelda this year, but you're going to get that trailer that gets you just enough fan wank to get people excited.

914
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,000
I'm going to get the new Zelda. It's the Wind Waker thing. It's supposed to be a remake.

915
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Oh yeah, the Wind Waker. I meant like, you know...

916
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Just wake me when the wank is over.

917
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:23,000
I'm telling you, it makes perfect sense, and the setup is so perfect that I would be shocked if...

918
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Maybe not this year, because they are a little slow to adopt virtual consoles now just coming out.

919
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:33,000
How many months later? Six months later?

920
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:41,000
I mean, so they're a little slow to adopt things, but I would be shocked that we do not see a way to play 3DS games on the Wii U.

921
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Or, let's just say that they're not going to do that, seeing some HD remakes of 3DS games coming to the Wii U.

922
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
It only makes sense that they're going to do that.

923
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Alright, well let's move on.

924
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Dark Soccer brought up indie developers, and this could be a place where Nintendo could...

925
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
And it seems like something could be happening there, who knows?

926
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:07,000
But this would be the group you would want to get in bed with if you were a game developer.

927
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
It looks like they're in bed with Microsoft, though.

928
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
So is it sexy times?

929
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Yeah, but Mojang, Marcus Pearson, of course Notch, and Jens Bergensten, they have made Time's list of the 100 most influential people in the world for 2013.

930
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Now, Time's 100 list kind of gets some, you know...

931
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I think Lady Gaga won or came in second place in an online poll of who's...

932
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Take some of this stuff with a grain of salt, but it is nice to see gaming represented and indie gaming at that.

933
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:45,000
And the cool thing is that Will Wright, you know, SimCity before it was, you know, this last one,

934
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:50,000
actually wrote the introduction talking that Minecraft was, quote,

935
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:56,000
a wonderful combination of accessibility and depth allowing for complex output with simple input.

936
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:02,000
And, you know, Minecraft was an amazing thing for gaming.

937
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,000
So I'm glad this is getting acknowledged.

938
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:15,000
I went from payter to tolerator to digging holes in the ground prairie dogger.

939
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I'm going to make it a point this week because I've been really bad at not going to the server.

940
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:22,000
I'm going to play every single day this week.

941
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
I live streamed it last week.

942
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
I'm going to play every single day.

943
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
My prairie doghouse.

944
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:37,000
I guess apparently Time did that poll online, and this is saying that Notch ranked second in the poll.

945
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
So it was Notch or it was Lady Gaga.

946
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,000
I mean, you know, what's the difference, right?

947
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Lady Notch, Notch.

948
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,000
They're essentially the same person.

949
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
All right, so congrats to them.

950
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
I'm curious.

951
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Now the question is, what's next?

952
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,000
You know, they had that unit with the universe game was their next big project, right?

953
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
The camera, the name of the scrolls that they're doing.

954
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Yes.

955
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:07,000
They've got the you know, the fuck the games call.

956
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
It's like 0x00.

957
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,000
That's that's the one I'm thinking of.

958
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Yeah.

959
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Yeah.

960
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:18,000
So although that one, he's claiming that he's running to kind of like a writer's block almost with it.

961
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:23,000
So he's working on other things right now until he figures out what to do with it.

962
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Gotcha.

963
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
All right.

964
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Let's move on.

965
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
We're still a little ways from the classic game of the week.

966
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Some more news for you first.

967
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Well, now, this is something I'm excited about, even though, yeah, it's kind of me biting myself because of the nostalgia thing.

968
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
But I was super happy.

969
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Castle of Illusion is getting remade for PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade and PC.

970
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:52,000
It is being developed by Sega Studios Australia and it will be a, I guess, a 2.5D kind of game.

971
01:00:52,000 --> 01:01:05,000
This is a 2D 3D hybrid and it is basically based off of the Genesis slash Mega Drive game with the original director working with the developer now.

972
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:09,000
So there's a trailer out for it.

973
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,000
I totally recommend everybody watch it because it looks super good.

974
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,000
But I do not see a date on it.

975
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Yeah, I don't think they have a date for it yet.

976
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Yeah.

977
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,000
However, I mean, I played the shit out of this game.

978
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:34,000
I even, when I graduated high school, I traded my Super Nintendo for my friend's Genesis and sat playing this game for just the whole night.

979
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:40,000
And then I found his Master System converter and then was playing Alex Kidd in Shinobi World and that was pretty awesome too.

980
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:45,000
But yeah, Castle of Illusion is one of my top Disney games.

981
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Yeah, that was a great game so it's exciting to hear about this.

982
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,000
The pictures are absolutely gorgeous but seriously, watch the trailer.

983
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:58,000
It is maybe not as orgasm inducing as DuckTales but, you know, there's lots of wank.

984
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
It'll still get you going down there a little bit?

985
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
It'll make one moist.

986
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Ew.

987
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
That's just a fun word.

988
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Moist?

989
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Moist.

990
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:14,000
I was going to bring it up here in studio real quick just to be able to see some of this here in action.

991
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Let me get to the actual gameplay part of the trailer.

992
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
It does look really good.

993
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
The graphics.

994
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Yeah, this is more, there's not much of the gameplay.

995
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Yeah, Maleficent.

996
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Was that Maleficent?

997
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Her face looks a little weird though.

998
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Yeah, they don't have any gameplay in that but they actually have some screenshots that look pretty sweet.

999
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Yeah.

1000
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Good times.

1001
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Oh, Codeman, I'm sorry.

1002
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
What?

1003
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:49,000
This isn't you. We actually have a friend, our friend Beanie.

1004
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:53,000
You say the word moist around her, she full body shudders. It's hilarious.

1005
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Wasn't that the mom in Dead Like Me?

1006
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
I never watched that.

1007
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Dead Like Me was a great show.

1008
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Well, I know it was a great show but I never watched it.

1009
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Critical Myth, back me up. You like that show, right?

1010
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
You're the TV connoisseur around here.

1011
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Rob Moist.

1012
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
I love that word.

1013
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
I like cake.

1014
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Anyhow, Toilette.

1015
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Alright.

1016
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Moist Toilette.

1017
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and what's coming to a gaming store near you, Loki.

1018
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Today, Lego City Undercover The Chase Begins came out on the 3DS.

1019
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Tuesday, Dead Island Riptide coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PC.

1020
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen, it's kind of like the game re-released with their expansion in there.

1021
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,000
That's PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1022
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:45,000
And then Star Trek on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1023
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,000
And those would be your games for this week.

1024
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Because it is April and hardly anything comes out in April.

1025
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Well, I mean Star Trek and Dead Island Riptide are...

1026
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Yeah, it's a decent release.

1027
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,000
It's not as dry as some of the weeks have been lately.

1028
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Next week, on the other hand, Deadly Premonition.

1029
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,000
And that's it.

1030
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Eww.

1031
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Alright, let's travel over to Japan and check out what is coming out in the Japanese release dates this week.

1032
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,000
We will start off with the PlayStation 3.

1033
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,000
And on the 25th of April, Bioshock Infinite gets its Japanese release.

1034
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,000
So now you guys over there can see what we've all been raving about for a couple of weeks here.

1035
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Atuteki Yugi Mugen Scrolls, that comes in...

1036
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:32,000
I think there's like a limited edition, a regular edition, and then some like selection edition.

1037
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Oh, you know what it is? The original Mugen Souls is getting a re-release price edition.

1038
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,000
And there's Mugen Souls Z comes out this week. That's the deal there.

1039
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Dragon's Dogma from Capcom out this week on the 25th.

1040
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Shin Kamitachi no Yoro 11 Hitome no Suspect gets a price reduction this week.

1041
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Also in regular and limited editions, Steins Gate Senkei Kosuko no Phonogram comes out.

1042
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Tomb Raider gets its Japanese release this week. We talked a little bit about the...

1043
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,000
DLC Japanese voice track.

1044
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
No, not in Japan. You already get it.

1045
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:11,000
But to give you an idea, if you want to import this baby into the US, $84 to import that guy.

1046
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:15,000
So that's why it's, you know, games cost a little more in Japan.

1047
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Let's see, let's travel over. That's all PlayStation 3. Let's look at the Xbox 360.

1048
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Tomb Raider over there as well, of course.

1049
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Dragon's Dogma as well and Bioshock Infinite, most of the same stuff.

1050
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Steins Gate 2.

1051
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Colladrius also in regular and limited edition this week on the Xbox 360.

1052
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Taking a look real quick at some of the handhelds.

1053
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
PlayStation Vita.

1054
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Kajiri Kamui Kagura Akebono no Hikari in regular and limited editions.

1055
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Katamari Damacy no Vita gets a price reduction this week.

1056
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
That would be the Katamari Damacy game that was out at launch.

1057
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
The music's still stuck in my head.

1058
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Make You Cross Blood Infinity out on the Vita this week as well.

1059
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Photokano Kiss and Ragnarok Odyssey and Ridge Racer getting price reductions this week in Japan.

1060
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Lots of price reductions on games this week.

1061
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Shinsengoku Musou next.

1062
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Tales of Innocence R.

1063
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:08,000
So if you are a Japanese Vita owner, this is a great week to stock up on games you might have missed.

1064
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:14,000
On the Wii U this week, nothing.

1065
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Absolutely nothing on the Wii U this week. That really shouldn't be a surprise.

1066
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:24,000
On other systems, checking out the Nintendo 3DS.

1067
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,000
I'm showing that we're still sending to the feed, so I'm going to move on for the podcast.

1068
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Nintendo 3DS says Detective Conan, Marionette no Kuyo Yoko Yoko.

1069
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Pocket Monster PC covers for the 3DS XL, you know, for those you Pocket Monster fans.

1070
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:43,000
And Starry Sky in Spring 3D in regular and limited editions.

1071
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,000
There you go. That's it for Japanese releases.

1072
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Dark Sakura, how about the UK?

1073
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
We have some stuff in the UK.

1074
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:55,000
We have, and this is the wrong window, because I'm special.

1075
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Goddamn stupid iPad. Sorry.

1076
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Okay. We have, on the 24th, Draw Slasher for the Vita, and Thomas Was Alone for the Vita and PS3.

1077
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:15,000
On the 26th, Dead Island Riptide, Deadly Premonition, The Director's Cut, Dragon's Dogma, Dark Arisen, and Star Trek.

1078
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
That's it.

1079
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,000
It did, the feed did drop on our end, just so you know.

1080
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Yeah, I don't know what's going on.

1081
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Well, we always do a, you know, before, well now it's showing it's connected.

1082
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Before we start OLR every night, we always reset the router, reset the modems and everything in the house, you know.

1083
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Just think, if we were an always connected game console, we would not be working right now.

1084
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Keep that in mind for your future game console needs.

1085
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Dear Microsoft, listen to our podcast every week, 6 o'clock Central Time.

1086
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:56,000
I mean, Central Public Time.

1087
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Is my computer, Alan, is my computer on?

1088
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Yes.

1089
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:03,000
No? Okay. I just want to make sure, like, I didn't have, like, Dropbox running or something, so just, you know.

1090
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Yeah, Rob did mention Detective Conan.

1091
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
I did.

1092
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Which is a very popular anime series from the 90s.

1093
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Yes, which is getting a game release in Japan that I already closed the window for.

1094
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,000
All right, do we do UK release dates? Sorry.

1095
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Yes.

1096
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
All right, then we got-

1097
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
A bunch of crap.

1098
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,000
A few more news stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.

1099
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:29,000
All right, so we've already talked about how the Wii U isn't selling very well.

1100
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Rob isn't selling very well.

1101
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:37,000
And we don't have the, technically we don't have the NPD numbers out for hardware because Nintendo's not going to come out bragging that,

1102
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Hey, we only sold, like, 67,000 units. Yeah.

1103
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:55,000
But, apparently, according to a leak on NeoGaf, they have the console numbers, which is possible because I get email updates occasionally of NPD numbers.

1104
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:03,000
So, yes, the Wii U apparently only sold 67,000 units in the U.S. during the five weeks from March 3rd to April 6th.

1105
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:15,000
And then, also, I guess, roughly, the Vita didn't do much better, actually. Let's see here.

1106
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:20,000
They did only 33,000 units during March.

1107
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Were there any Vita games during March?

1108
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Quick, name me games on the Vita to get excited about right now.

1109
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:34,000
I'm thinking the Persona 4 release, but that was, that already happened, so I'm like,

1110
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Tearaway if you're into

1111
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Project D.Va

1112
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Yeah, I guess that's true.

1113
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Tearaway if you're into Media Molecule.

1114
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:44,000
There is Killzone, if you like Killzone.

1115
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:54,000
So, here's a question for you all. We sit here and we razz Nintendo about, you know, well, you know, they're just not getting those titles out there, but look at the frickin' Vita.

1116
01:09:54,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Here's the thing, I think, with the Vita, and it's like, Nintendo, we recognize the potential is there that they could be doing much better.

1117
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:08,000
The Vita, I don't think we have much expectations for them, other than, hey, it's a nice piece of hardware, but for some reason, all the games that come out on it aren't very good.

1118
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Like, dude, they had Call of Duty, Black Ops, come out on the Vita. That should have been System Accelerate there.

1119
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:25,000
But, no. Instead, they just had a quick rush of a game come out by someone that did Resistance, and it sucked ass.

1120
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Thankfully, they're taking all that stuff first party now, and they're gonna be developing, instead of having third parties develop their games for them.

1121
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:39,000
So, Killzone hopefully will be much better, but, I don't know.

1122
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,000
I don't know if Tearaway's gonna, well, Tearaway's not gonna say that system.

1123
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:49,000
What's gonna save that system, I think, a little bit is the fact that PlayStation Network is a really good place right now for indies, and there's a lot of indie games coming out in there.

1124
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
So, I think we'll see some interesting stuff from there.

1125
01:10:51,000 --> 01:11:01,000
And maybe what develops with the PlayStation 4, because before I get accused of being a Nintendo fanboy and always defending them here on this show, although I like to think of myself as devil's advocate against gamers hate everything.

1126
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:08,000
But, I think the PlayStation 4 is in a good place. I think it has a lot of good buzz around it.

1127
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:19,000
And, you know, PlayStation 4 is gonna be a real contender for the Wii U, which doesn't, you know, unless they really knock our socks off at E3, you definitely are gonna have PlayStation 4 on another level.

1128
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
You're gonna have to come out with something absolutely amazing.

1129
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:26,000
And it could be interesting how the Vita could tie into that. I mean, we've already seen a little bit of that early press conference.

1130
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:32,000
You know, so I'm really curious to see how that enriches as time goes on here.

1131
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Kuma JP mentioned a game called Oboro Muramasa. I guess, does that have to do with the sword?

1132
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Well, he linked us to the game there in our chat room.

1133
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Well, let's take a look.

1134
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:48,000
So, if I can bring it up without destroying our feed again.

1135
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:54,000
It's Muramasa Rebirth. It's the HD, well, not really HD, but remake of Muramasa.

1136
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Oh, neat.

1137
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
That's cool.

1138
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Oh, that looks pretty fun.

1139
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Screenshots are taking forever to load. There we go.

1140
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Yeah, it's at the end of...

1141
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
The Vita does have such a pretty screen.

1142
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
It is a great piece of tech.

1143
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Well, they do have some good Japanese games coming out. They've got, you know, the Persona stuff. They've got Muramasa Rebirth.

1144
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:21,000
There's also Odin's, well, not Odin's Sphere. There's Dragonblade.

1145
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Is that chick naked?

1146
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Look at her. They're skinny dipping or something.

1147
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Rob.

1148
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
This is a perverse game.

1149
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
You know what?

1150
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
You need to stop being so white boy about it.

1151
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Oh my god, boobs. Oh my god.

1152
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:48,000
It's only here that people have a big stick up their ass, a big rough sandpapery stick up their ass about boobs.

1153
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Exactly. I believe that we should have more boobs on TV. I fully support this.

1154
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Darsakir, are you saying I have a stick up my ass?

1155
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
I like boobs too.

1156
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Boobs are great, but I mean people in general. We're fine with violence and blood and gore and, you know, saw and everything.

1157
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
I like boobs covered in blood.

1158
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,000
But show a tit and everyone loses their shit. Hey, that rhymed.

1159
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:16,000
That's gonna be my new motto about America. Show a tit, lose your shit.

1160
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:27,000
We haven't come to that part of the show yet, but we do have a story later on about the evil within, which did have a four-armed demon chick with boobs and blood on her boobs.

1161
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
So there you go.

1162
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
The violence boob quota.

1163
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Blood orgy, yay.

1164
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Organ orgy. It's just like organs launched at the screen. It was great.

1165
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
More boobs.

1166
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Let's see, did you do the other sales story about-

1167
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Yeah, MPD.

1168
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
March MPD.

1169
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Repeat what you just said again.

1170
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:52,000
No, no problem. The March MPD stuff, Bioshock Infinite, obviously the top selling game.

1171
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:58,000
The utter disappointment of a game sequel, Tomb Raider, only placed second.

1172
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Heads will roll.

1173
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Oh, what a disappointment.

1174
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Ironically, Gears of War Judgment 360 and then God of War Ascension on PS3 were three and four.

1175
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:22,000
I'm sorry. I have to say this. This is going to be so wrong and I apologize in advance, but only an Asian company like Square Enix would be like, why can you only be the second best selling game?

1176
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Am I right? Am I right?

1177
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Only the parent company in Asia would be like, why weren't you the number one game?

1178
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Why you get an A minus?

1179
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
You came out in the beginning of the month.

1180
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Call of Duty harder.

1181
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Call of Duty Black Ops 2.

1182
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Luigi's Mansion, Dark Moon actually on there, number six. MLB 13, the show on number seven.

1183
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
NBA 2K13, eight.

1184
01:14:51,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Walking Dead Survival Instinct just began proving that Walking Dead, the franchise, will actually sell anything, whether it be a good game or absolute shit.

1185
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:07,000
So that was number nine. Naruto, ship it in. Ultimate Ninja Storm 3, number 10.

1186
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:18,000
What's not on this list? The two big titles for the Wii U, Lego City Undercover and Monster Hunter 3. Not even the top 10. So that's got to hurt.

1187
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Maybe Laura should have been a doctor.

1188
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Alright, moving on to fighting game news, or maybe a little change going on or another perspective.

1189
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Vice President Christian Svensson over at Capcom has made a remark about a fan-submitted question on the Ask Capcom forums.

1190
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:46,000
This was about stories in fighting games. You know, I don't know how many people really play fighting games for the story.

1191
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Although some of them do have good stories, I guess.

1192
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Will you raise your hand over there?

1193
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Yes. Okay, if I don't play fighting games for the stories, I would have never touched any of the Tekken games.

1194
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,000
I guess that's true.

1195
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:02,000
I assume the people that play the fighting games for their stories are the same people that read Playboy for their articles.

1196
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Well, anyhow, here's the interesting comment about story mode in fighting games.

1197
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Quote, the strategic marketing group here has for quite a while been pushing for our fighting franchises to have more and more better single-player content, of which full-fledged story modes are one component.

1198
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:24,000
How and when those requirements manifest in our future roadmap, I'm not prepared to speak about at this time.

1199
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Which a lot of people are reading in between the lines of that, that, you know, the single-player content or the story modes in fighting games are not good.

1200
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
In Capcom fighting games.

1201
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:42,000
I don't know. But then again, you know, you look at a franchise like Mortal Kombat.

1202
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Mortal Kombat's done really well with their story modes in their recent releases, especially this last one.

1203
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Tigerclaw mentions that the story in Injustice is really good and is getting Capcom thinking about making better stories in their fighting games.

1204
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Well, Injustice is just NetherRealm Studios that just did the Mortal Kombat game, right? So, same, same.

1205
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Anyhow, one other thing to mention about Capcom.

1206
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Apparently, more DLC in Capcom's future, which, you know, isn't really unexpected.

1207
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:22,000
But this is talking about Capcom's recent strategy.

1208
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:30,000
There was a lot of very interesting revelations here in Capcom's forecast about where the company's going.

1209
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Saying that apparently they don't want to outsource games to Western developers as much anymore.

1210
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,000
That it has caused a drop in quality.

1211
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:43,000
They're gonna promote DLC in the consumer business.

1212
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Aim for growth, surpassing the market by reinforcing the online and mobile contents business.

1213
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,000
iPhone games, Android games.

1214
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:58,000
And strengthen earnings base by expanding the title lineup in the P&S business.

1215
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,000
More DLC, just hopefully not included on the disc.

1216
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Or just announce the Mega Man rebirth already.

1217
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
We all know it's coming.

1218
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
A Mega Man reboot.

1219
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Alright.

1220
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Alright.

1221
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:24,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, band.

1222
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:28,000
That just about brings us to the end of the first half of our show.

1223
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:36,000
But we have to take a trip down memory lane first off with a segment we call the Classic Game of the Week.

1224
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,000
You know, back in the time, we didn't have reboots back in the day.

1225
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
You didn't reboot a gaming franchise.

1226
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:49,000
No, you just put out some crappy sequels and then try to make people forgive you with the third one.

1227
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:53,000
That's right. Well, let's see if that is the case with tonight's Classic Game of the Week.

1228
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Not really.

1229
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Alright, DarkSakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week tonight?

1230
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Son of the Hedgehog 3.

1231
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Because I couldn't find anything else and I've been haunted by the Ice Cap music.

1232
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Oddly enough for some reason.

1233
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Which is what's in the background.

1234
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Which is the best music ever in any video game in the universe.

1235
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:16,000
So Sonic the Hedgehog 3 was the special one.

1236
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,000
It was completely tied to its direct sequel, Sonic and Knuckles.

1237
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:23,000
And they could latch on to each other and be awesome.

1238
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:27,000
It was like the gestalt of game perfection.

1239
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,000
So yeah, I mean, it's basically Sonic the Hedgehog.

1240
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:35,000
I mean, I really liked the first one. I really liked the second one.

1241
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Sonic 3 for me just, like, lit everything up.

1242
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
It was the last real- actually, no, I take that back.

1243
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Sonic CD was the last really good Sonic game as far as platforming goes.

1244
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:50,000
But this, I actually, I actually will even put Sonic 3 above Sonic CD.

1245
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:55,000
And Bobby the Japanese music was better for Sonic CD, just saying.

1246
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:00,000
So Sonic 3 also had some interesting things going on with it too.

1247
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:05,000
You basically could pick between Sonic or Tails, as you could in Sonic 2.

1248
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,000
And it was basically the same type of gameplay.

1249
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,000
You had all the same usual stuff. You had your six levels with two parts.

1250
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,000
You had a boss at the end of the very full thing.

1251
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
You could keep going back to the level.

1252
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:23,000
You have new abilities, like you could hold the jump button while in mid-air.

1253
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,000
And do, like, a quick shield for protection.

1254
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Tails could fly or swim underwater for a short time before getting tired and going back down.

1255
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,000
So Tails could actually go to places that Sonic could not.

1256
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:39,000
And his tail could actually be used to attack enemies.

1257
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:44,000
And if you have a second player controlling Tails, then he can carry Sonic while flying.

1258
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,000
So basically it opened up to all kinds of exploration.

1259
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:51,000
And then there were the different shields in the game, like there was the fire shield.

1260
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:58,000
And my favorite was, was it the lightning shield that attracted coins? Not coins, rings.

1261
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,000
That was my favorite.

1262
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:04,000
And if you hit a checkpoint while holding 50 or more rings, you got a bonus stage, which was the bumper stage.

1263
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Which, I'm sorry, the bumper stage pissed me off.

1264
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Of any bonus stage ever in any game, for some reason it was that sort of, was it semi-isometric point of view?

1265
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Would just give me a headache and I couldn't do it at all. So now I make Dan do it.

1266
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:25,000
But that's how you earn your Chaos Emeralds.

1267
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:31,000
And, like, someone even took the time to chart out how the various bonus stages were.

1268
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:37,000
There was also a thing you could do with Sonic and Knuckles, where if you attached an older cartridge to it.

1269
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Like, you could play Sonic 2 with Sonic and Knuckles.

1270
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:45,000
But if you did another one, if you hold, like, a certain button press, then you could go on.

1271
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Now, I want to talk about the music for a minute, okay?

1272
01:21:49,000 --> 01:22:00,000
There was a big thing going around with the music, saying that Michael Jackson had done a lot of the music and then he removed himself from the cartridge or something.

1273
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:11,000
There's a series of, what am I mentioning, clips on YouTube, where people have compared music in Sonic 3 to Michael Jackson songs.

1274
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:16,000
So, I mean, it's pretty obvious. I mean, the Ice Cap Zone sounds like Smooth Criminal.

1275
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:19,000
This is actually my second favorite music in the game.

1276
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:26,000
It's the Lava Reef Zone. Really good music.

1277
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:39,000
So, yeah, so basically, you know, you can, if you got all of the Chaos Emeralds, you can turn into Super Sonic and then Knuckles punches the crap out of him and takes the Chaos Emeralds.

1278
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:43,000
And you have to go to the Death Egg. Rawr.

1279
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:52,000
You know, which, I always like, yeah, they called him Robotnik, but it really did make a lot more sense to call him Eggman because the dude looked like a freaking egg.

1280
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,000
And, hey, he was in Wreck-It Ralph.

1281
01:22:55,000 --> 01:23:01,000
So, yeah, so basically there have been a bajillion different releases of this game.

1282
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:07,000
We had Sonic Jam in 1997 for the Saturn, Sonic and Knuckles collection, and the Sonic and Garfield pack.

1283
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:10,000
What the fuck? Sonic and Garfield pack? For PC?

1284
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Sonic Mega Collection for the GameCube, Sonic Mega Collection Plus for PS2, Xbox, and PC, Sega Genesis Collection for PS2 and PSP, Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and PS3, and Sonic Classic Collection for Nintendo DS.

1285
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Plus, you can get, like, these various packs on Steam.

1286
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:35,000
I'll be honest, the only one of those I've ever bought was Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine because, hello, it's Puyo Puyo.

1287
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:49,000
There have been, like I said, the digital releases for Steam, there's been the Wii Virtual Console one in 2007, Xbox Live Arcade in 2009, and it even has a split-screen multiplayer on Xbox Live.

1288
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:55,000
So it was given, when it was released, EGM gave it a 9.5 out of 10.

1289
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:01,000
And, honestly, I think it was well-deserved. It's one of the best games to ever come out.

1290
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
So...

1291
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Alright. That's it?

1292
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,000
That's it.

1293
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:12,000
There it is. A real classic. A real classic game of the week there. Sonic 3.

1294
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:16,000
I think I'm saving the Sonic series for my... Damn, I can't think of a game this week.

1295
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:20,000
So I've got Sonic 2 and the first one to go. We'll see what happens, right?

1296
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Alright. There it is, your classic game of the week. Sonic 3.

1297
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:30,000
We will be back after a quick break with plenty more of Orange Lounge Radio. Don't go anywhere, guys. We'll be right back.

1298
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Welcome back to Part B of Orange Lounge Radio for this April the 21st, 2013, the 501st episode of our show.

1299
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Alright, so we had a little bit of a long break there live. Sorry about that. But, you know, just taking care of it.

1300
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Blame me!

1301
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Alright, I will blame Dark Sakura. It's all her fault.

1302
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:59,000
But, I don't get it. Loki was giggling like mad during the break.

1303
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,000
This is the funniest shit ever.

1304
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:05,000
It's apparently some gay... I haven't seen this yet, so I'm about to check this out. What is this game, Loki?

1305
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,000
It's Surgeon Simulator 2013.

1306
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Okay, and what's the deal with this game?

1307
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:21,000
It's basically a surgery simulator. Like, they have different surgeries you perform. There's like brain transplants, kidney transplants, and I think like a heart transplant or something.

1308
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:29,000
And what makes the game unique is that you control it using the keyboard and mouse. The keyboard, you put your hand on the Q, W, E, F, and space.

1309
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Each one of the keys represents one of your fingers in the game. So you have to grip instruments and actually do stuff.

1310
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:44,000
And so more times than not, you're just like flopping around all over the place.

1311
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:47,000
So it's kind of like Q-Op or something.

1312
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Yeah, go earlier in the video there.

1313
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Go earlier in the video here? Alright.

1314
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:03,000
So they're ripping out organs of this patient? What?

1315
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:06,000
You can even go earlier than that. This is the funny Swedish guy.

1316
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:11,000
Perform a double kidney transplant.

1317
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:14,000
In an ambulance. The ambulance is moving, so stuff is bouncing around.

1318
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Oh great, the ambulance is moving.

1319
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Hey, guts.

1320
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Sausage in your stomach, Bob.

1321
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,000
The kidney is just floating around in the back there.

1322
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
I love that.

1323
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Oh, lordy.

1324
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:33,000
I am buying this when I get home.

1325
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:37,000
You need to wait and don't play it until you can livestream it.

1326
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
Here we go, Bob.

1327
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
I'll do it tonight.

1328
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:47,000
I'll put that in our chat. Sorry to the podcast folks, but just look it up on YouTube.

1329
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:50,000
There's a ton of them. It was great about the game.

1330
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Surgeon Simulator 2013.

1331
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
They have records. They have people doing record surgery.

1332
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:58,000
The times, how quickly you can do surgery, and murder times.

1333
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,000
So like how quickly you can kill your patient.

1334
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Sj100matt says in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says,

1335
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Hey, I remember playing the original surgery game, Life and Death 2.

1336
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Oh yeah, I remember that.

1337
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Those games were scary shit.

1338
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Sorry, for me it was Trauma Center.

1339
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:19,000
You know, we got Trauma Center on Wii when it came out.

1340
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Oh yeah, me too.

1341
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,000
And I remember, I think I was drunk on something.

1342
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
No, no, no, it was the Vicodin.

1343
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:28,000
When I'm sitting here, leaning back in my chair, I was on Vicodin.

1344
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:32,000
It was right after, I think I was playing it right after my surgery.

1345
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:36,000
So I'm sitting here with my hand in a cast, trying to hold the Wii-mote,

1346
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
going, can't hold it!

1347
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:42,000
And then I ended up using my left hand, and so I was slicing people to bits.

1348
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,000
It was hilarious.

1349
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Sj100matt though, I was playing the original surgery game, Operation, by Milton Bradley.

1350
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Yeah, the only thing about Life and Death 1 that kind of sucked was that,

1351
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,000
from what I remember, at least we can only get to the first surgery,

1352
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:01,000
which was removing an appendix.

1353
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Unfortunately, they do not allow you to play tic-tac-toe using the scalpel.

1354
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:09,000
That will kill the patient, apparently.

1355
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Nice.

1356
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Alright, let's move on, do some rapid-fire news,

1357
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:18,000
quickly covering some of the other things going on in the gaming world this week.

1358
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
And then we'll get to the Fookle question of the week.

1359
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
But first, rapid-fire news, Logie.

1360
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:26,000
So, Deadpool, supposed to be coming out June 25th.

1361
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,000
And that's all you need to know, because Deadpool's awesome.

1362
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:32,000
PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC, June 25th.

1363
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:40,000
The Ouya's got a firmware update that's allowing people to change their credit card information.

1364
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
And apparently you can change this at any time.

1365
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:49,000
And also, they're going to be adding some different payment options as well later on.

1366
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:53,000
But right now, you can change your credit card information, fantastic.

1367
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:56,000
And they've signed up 10,000 registered developers,

1368
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:01,000
because technically everybody with an Ouya could be a registered developer at some point,

1369
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:04,000
because you can develop stuff on your own system.

1370
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,000
But yeah, that sounds kind of cool.

1371
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:16,000
And I think one of the announcements was that Papa and Yo, developers,

1372
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
was supposed to be making a game for Ouya.

1373
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:21,000
So that's kind of neat.

1374
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:25,000
And last but not least, Bethesda was teasing all week long.

1375
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:29,000
And then finally released a trailer for The Evil Within,

1376
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:33,000
which is the brand new game from Shinji Mikami.

1377
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,000
They're known for the Resident Evil series.

1378
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
And I got to say, after watching the trailer,

1379
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:42,000
other than the fact that there is a lot of organs and stuff,

1380
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:46,000
it looks very Silent Hill-ish. Like, good Silent Hill-ish.

1381
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:50,000
I was a little bit scared just watching the trailer.

1382
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Let me bring this up here in studio.

1383
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:57,000
I like brains.

1384
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Oh, I thought there was a YouTube here.

1385
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
I'll look it up when I get home.

1386
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:04,000
I like anything that's Silent Hill in a good way.

1387
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:11,000
But I have to get Shane's review of it, because I trust Shane in all things remotely Silent Hill-looking.

1388
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Oh, don't inflate his ego like that.

1389
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Okay, here, this is like a two-minute trailer, though.

1390
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,000
And there's ads on it. Hooray.

1391
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Well, let's come back to this in a minute. That's what we'll do.

1392
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
That's fine.

1393
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
In the meantime, I will read a few stories here.

1394
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:30,000
The bonus games for Capcom Arcade Cabinet revealed.

1395
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:34,000
If you bought all the games for Capcom Arcade Cabinet, all the download stuff,

1396
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,000
you will get two free games.

1397
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:42,000
And the bonus games were 1943 Kai. That is the laser 1943.

1398
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Awesome.

1399
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:50,000
And Vulgus, which was the very first Capcom game in arcades.

1400
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:56,000
By the way, just so you know, the other pack of games came out for Capcom that rounds out this pack.

1401
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:01,000
That's Sun Sun 1942 and Pirate Ship Higemaru, which I love that game.

1402
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Higemaru is a pretty neat game.

1403
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:07,000
But if you want just classic shooter, you can't get any better than 1942.

1404
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Well, for vertical shooters.

1405
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Right.

1406
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Okay, is that guy doing surgery on a brain?

1407
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
No, Shane hadn't seen the trailer yet, so I was linking him.

1408
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Don't watch this yet. Don't watch this yet. Okay.

1409
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
I have other news.

1410
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Mad Dog McCree 2, The Lost Gold.

1411
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,000
No incur.

1412
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Well, if you're a PSN owner, you might care.

1413
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
It has move control.

1414
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
HD scrub down.

1415
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Good, because this is the only way someone can play it anymore since light guns don't work.

1416
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
New difficulty modes.

1417
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
And online leaderboards.

1418
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:41,000
You know, because everybody wants to compete on Mad Dog McCree.

1419
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Also, a rating has shown up on a Korean rating site for Metal Gear Solid The Legacy Collection.

1420
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:52,000
This would make sense, though, if there's a Metal Gear Solid 5 on the horizon.

1421
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Why wouldn't they want to bundle the first four games together?

1422
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
You can't really call four games a trilogy.

1423
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
So this would make sense.

1424
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:02,000
There was also a tweet from Hideo Kojima that kind of points to this as well.

1425
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Why wouldn't this be a thing on PlayStation 3?

1426
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Why wouldn't it?

1427
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Makes a lot of sense.

1428
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:13,000
Now, this trailer's like two minutes long, so I can't do the whole thing.

1429
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:16,000
But here's some parts of the trailer, Dark Sakura.

1430
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:22,000
I'm going to fast forward a little bit.

1431
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
All the good stuff's towards the end.

1432
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
All the good stuff's at the end.

1433
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
That's really realistic.

1434
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
Yeah.

1435
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Let's go a little further.

1436
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Ooh, blood.

1437
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Okay, I want to play this.

1438
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Organs.

1439
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Yay, I like organs.

1440
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Ew.

1441
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Rob, why are you showing me that, Rob?

1442
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:04,000
That's one of those games to get my mom to watch me play.

1443
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:10,000
We need to get your mom watching you play one of those games, and we need to stream it.

1444
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Well, I was thinking a great one to have my mom react to would be Bioshock Infinite.

1445
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
So I'll work on that.

1446
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:20,000
We should do Rob's Mom, the series.

1447
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Yeah, maybe like a YouTube thing. We'll see.

1448
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Alright, moving on, Dark Sakura, you have some game news for us.

1449
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:29,000
I do, and one of them has to do with a game that we have covered before.

1450
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
It's actually a game hack.

1451
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:36,000
And now it's actually showing up in arcades.

1452
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:39,000
There's a guy named Clay Cowgill.

1453
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:43,000
I almost said cowgirl, and I knew better, so I caught myself.

1454
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Bangadoo bang.

1455
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Geez, thanks.

1456
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Did a ROM hack that basically installs it in place of the original game chips on the motherboard.

1457
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:57,000
So there is a YouTube video going around of the arcade version.

1458
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:04,000
And a site called This Old Game is doing the artwork for the Pauline edition.

1459
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:13,000
So it will be like $100 and has a marquee, monitor, glass, control panel, side art, and instruction stickers.

1460
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:18,000
They even have Mario being held by Donkey Kong and stuff.

1461
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Oh, that's awesome, because that's like...

1462
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:23,000
I mean, it's even in the right style, too. I love it.

1463
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:31,000
So next up, the 3DS XL Circle Pad Pro is finally in North America. Yay.

1464
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:34,000
And it costs 20 bucks. Boo.

1465
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:38,000
But you can order it on Nintendo's official online store.

1466
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
That is the only place that you can find it.

1467
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
But not too many games use it.

1468
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Mostly Monster Hunter 3 and Resident Evil Revelations and Metal Gear Solid 3D Snake Eater.

1469
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,000
It has the best theme song of any game ever.

1470
01:34:53,000 --> 01:35:01,000
And now there is a third-person shooter called God Mode that launches on Steam and Xbox Live Arcade this kind of Friday.

1471
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,000
This game looked kind of fun.

1472
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,000
It did.

1473
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:06,000
It looked like a big orgy of death, like Quake Arena.

1474
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,000
It really did.

1475
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:13,000
It was done by Old School Games, which is a subsidiary of Saber Interactive.

1476
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:16,000
And it's basically, like you were saying, a health-themed arena shooter.

1477
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Go around, shoot things.

1478
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:22,000
You have modes called Test of Faith that alter the rulesets.

1479
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:25,000
You have party hats, Rob.

1480
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,000
Party hats are great.

1481
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Oh, I love party hats.

1482
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:33,000
And then basically it's just lots of fun.

1483
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Lots of crazy fun.

1484
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:40,000
And it costs 10 bucks on Steam or 800 Microsoft points.

1485
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Or £6.99 for our friends in the UK.

1486
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Very nice.

1487
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

1488
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Prince Brightstar asking a question about one of the stories you just did, Dark Saga.

1489
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Can arcades legally earn money from the Donkey Kong Pauline game?

1490
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,000
That's a good question.

1491
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Probably not. In all honesty, probably not.

1492
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:08,000
I would think this is more of a novelty that shows up at trade shows and private owners.

1493
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Not something you put down at a miniature golf place or at a bowling alley to actually make money.

1494
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
That would probably get you some hot water.

1495
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Well, I don't know. It's a ROM hack, so it's not necessarily that they're selling pirated stuff.

1496
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
It's basically modifying your system.

1497
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:25,000
It also wouldn't be the first pirated game to ever show up in an arcade.

1498
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Well, at Classic Gaming Expo, someone had done a Donkey Kong 2.

1499
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:36,000
It was basically just a re-hack of Donkey Kong where you found unused sprites and basically redid levels.

1500
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:41,000
I mean, it plays exactly Donkey Kong style, but he put up his dump and everything.

1501
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:44,000
That sounded awful. I'm sorry.

1502
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:49,000
He put the ROM dump up. Shut up, Rob.

1503
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
You're five. You served it up.

1504
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Five years old, Rab.

1505
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Here's my dump, y'all.

1506
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Well, it wasn't my dump. It was his dump, and I just happened to be there for it.

1507
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
It was number two.

1508
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
I quit. Bye. I'm going home.

1509
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:13,000
I'm done with y'all. This is...

1510
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:16,000
backwards. Fuck this shit. Later.

1511
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Thanks for the pinkberry bye.

1512
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:26,000
No, but I remembered that he had distributed it to some arcades.

1513
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
You're still red in the face.

1514
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Because it's funny, his little comment about what it was number two. That was funny.

1515
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:41,000
Isn't Prince Brightstar so happy that his question led to that?

1516
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:45,000
A really good serious question led to, yeah, poop.

1517
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Yeah, and we supposedly have a mature rating because we're not.

1518
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Let's get to the Fugu question of the week. Let's class it up a little bit here with some listener feedback.

1519
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Good fucking luck.

1520
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:09,000
Facebook and Google Plus. Throw them together, you get Fugu.

1521
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Fugu Plus. And we ask a question of the week every week on Fugu.

1522
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:18,000
And this week has to do with the Heroes show reboot, Rumors.

1523
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:25,000
Rumor is that Heroes, a TV show that used to be on NBC, could get a second chance as a television show on the next Xbox.

1524
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Would you watch something like this via Xbox?

1525
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Do you think this type of content delivery poses a threat to cable television as we know it now?

1526
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:38,000
What are your thoughts? We'll start on Facebook tonight with Critical Myth. Love this answer, by the way.

1527
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:45,000
Setting aside the fan perception that the show quickly went downhill after the first season, and thus bringing it back doesn't make a lot of sense,

1528
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:48,000
I don't think this alone is a threat to network or cable television.

1529
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:55,000
It would only be the combined success of these alternative outlets like Netflix, Hulu, DirecTV, and so on.

1530
01:38:55,000 --> 01:39:04,000
What it does say, along with some of the other outlets, is that a cancelled show may have many other options than might have been the case just a few short years ago.

1531
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Add to that the crowdsourcing possibilities, Veronica Mars, and the initial end of a show might not be the final end after all.

1532
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:20,000
You know, there's a show on ABC that I really like, I think it's really funny, called Happy Endings, but it's supposedly kind of done because the ratings haven't been very good,

1533
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:27,000
but everybody's already talking about, like, can it be on cable or something like that? So, I don't know.

1534
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:36,000
Alright, going to Red the Haze. Would you support Heroes or what have you?

1535
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Nope, I haven't paid for a live subscription in ages, and I'm satisfied everywhere else with my gaming and entertainment needs.

1536
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:46,000
My internet connection isn't fast enough, and a large percentage of the US has the same issue.

1537
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:57,000
This won't threaten cable TV, but other reliable services that are catching on, like Netflix and Hulu, are more of a threat because of the low barrier of entry with Roku's and smart TVs.

1538
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Rebooting a cancelled TV show that nobody remembers fondly isn't a good gamble.

1539
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:06,000
Now, somebody else jumped in there and said, hey, wait a minute, nobody remembers fondly.

1540
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:11,000
I liked, what was the dude's name, was it Hero?

1541
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Yeah, Hero.

1542
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
I liked him, and I liked his buddy.

1543
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:19,000
Unfortunately, he's not probably, I would say that most of the cast would not be back because you have them all doing their own things.

1544
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
They're all in other shows now.

1545
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:25,000
He's on Hawaii Five-0 right now, and The One Chick's on Dallas.

1546
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Nashville.

1547
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,000
Or Nashville, yeah.

1548
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:37,000
I mean, but there's always the possibility that they could do cameos or what have you, and Heroes wasn't necessarily, the idea was the Heroes were going to get all killed off in the first season anyway.

1549
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:40,000
It was supposed to always be new people, and it just didn't work out that way.

1550
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:51,000
I thought Heroes was awesome the first season. I was so into it. I'm sure I talked about it on this show because this show's been on long enough.

1551
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:59,000
I remember downloading the preview on Xbox and all that stuff. There's things in the preview that was on Xbox that never was even in the real show.

1552
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,000
I watched it. There's George Takei.

1553
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
There you go.

1554
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,000
Because you know he's my gay daddy.

1555
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:10,000
But I'm of the mindset that when they started introducing all these other characters in season two, it really went downhill.

1556
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:19,000
I stopped watching season three. I couldn't take it anymore, but I heard the show started to get back to its roots and got a lot better season four and maybe ended a little bit before.

1557
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:20,000
I never saw season four.

1558
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Yeah, I never gave it that second chance, but I would be down with a reboot, but if you're going to ask me to pay a lot of extra money for it, eh.

1559
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:33,000
But if it's part of a service that's something else with it, I might be open to it.

1560
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:40,000
I still wanted to go. I tried actually watching the first season, but all I would do is just watch the Hero Anando scenes.

1561
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:45,000
And I wanted to like Cheerleader Wolverine. Could not get into it.

1562
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:48,000
But one of my friends was on that show.

1563
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:52,000
This is supposed to be about the listeners. Let me read the rest of the answers here.

1564
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:55,000
Dark Charger says if the writing and acting is good, I will watch it.

1565
01:41:55,000 --> 01:42:00,000
I already pay for Xbox Live, as do millions of subscribers, and this just adds much needed value.

1566
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:04,000
There isn't a single show or channel that will usurp cable.

1567
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:13,000
However, I believe consumers are willing to dump on an antiquated business model if an IPTV model is perceived as an equivalent or superior.

1568
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Remember this whole thing, the theory was that cable providers could then offer their cable channels over the internet to other people that would be out of the area.

1569
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
Like if you don't have Comcast in your area, thank God.

1570
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:33,000
And you wanted to get Comcast channels, although they all kind of have the same channels anyways.

1571
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:38,000
But that was supposed to be a way to do it, was with this box.

1572
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:43,000
But remember HBO is talking about doing internet only.

1573
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:51,000
So that would be kind of neat, although I just don't want to pay $8 for each channel.

1574
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Burr replies and says never cared for heroes, but I would gladly watch a show on my Xbox if it was good.

1575
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:06,000
I don't know if it's a threat to the whole system, but it's yet another step towards the a la carte delivery consumers have been clamoring for, much to the cable company's chagrin.

1576
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Pete Garuno says if it ain't 1 versus 100, dot dot dot. High five, sir. Amen. Preach.

1577
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:23,000
If they say the next Xbox is bringing back 1 versus 100, I would have to give it serious consideration on that merit alone.

1578
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:26,000
But they need to guarantee me it'll be up for at least a couple years.

1579
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:31,000
Let's see, Nicky E. replied and said I liked the first season, they blew it in the second.

1580
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
I would probably check out a reboot.

1581
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:39,000
As for the whole deal of getting services via Xbox or Netflix or any other streaming service, I don't like it one bit if it's an exclusive thing.

1582
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:42,000
I pay for Netflix to be able to watch what I want, when I want.

1583
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:48,000
If some other service has an exclusive thing, I would either not care, buy it on DVD later, or maybe end up downloading it.

1584
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:55,000
I think too much competition via exclusive deals and making content only for your own streaming service would just lead to more piracy.

1585
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Just when the streaming services were beginning to compete with the conveniency of the internet.

1586
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Thanks for a great show. Thank you.

1587
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:06,000
That's a good point. I don't want to have to give every content publisher 10 bucks a month to watch their show.

1588
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:10,000
I think that dilution is going to lead to a lose-lose situation.

1589
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Piracy, yeah.

1590
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Yeah, piracy. People get what they want to see, you know.

1591
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:17,000
Yes, people do get what they want to see.

1592
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:21,000
Degenerate Johnny says, I don't particularly think this service will pose a threat.

1593
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:28,000
Yes, interactive entertainment has played a role in the steep decline of ratings within cable television through Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, and other various services.

1594
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Which is why you see cable news upholding the interest of those networks by focusing on the negative pertaining to interactive entertainment.

1595
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Ooh, interesting. Do you think maybe it's a whole little, that's why cable news has it out for games, is that it's competition?

1596
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
That's an awfully little...

1597
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:47,000
No, I think it's just, it's the same reason...

1598
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:48,000
They are an easy target though.

1599
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:56,000
It's the same reason why there's certain people on cable news that have very racist comments or, you know, I just think they're very short-minded.

1600
01:44:56,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Let's see, Andy R. says, depends what kind of pricing is involved, but I would like something like this.

1601
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:08,000
I don't pay for cable because I don't watch much TV, which makes it difficult on the few occasions when there is a show I want to watch, like Game of Thrones.

1602
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:12,000
If I can watch it in a manner where I'm not paying for a ton of services I don't want, I'm all for it.

1603
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Mike B. says, cable should be trying to keep up with the times. The future is a la carte programming.

1604
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:19,000
He's not the first one to use that term.

1605
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Commercial-free shows and movies via the internet. I already do this now. It's a little pricey, but no commercials.

1606
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Let me go over to Google Plus and Redertainment, who said, this is what Microsoft tried and failed to do with Web TV.

1607
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Microsoft wanted Web TV to be centralized hub for all your entertainment.

1608
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:48,000
The Xbox is succeeding where Web TV failed due to Xbox being a well-established brand and consumers generally being more web-savvy now than where Microsoft failed with Web TV.

1609
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:54,000
As far as Heroes goes, I take the same approach to it as I do Arrested Development of Netflix or Zombieland on Amazon.

1610
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:59,000
If I'm interested in the content, then I will seek it out. I'm not interested in Heroes, so I will not be seeking it out.

1611
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:05,000
Again, that comment from Redertainment on Google Plus. I think the comparison of Web TV is very interesting.

1612
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:10,000
If at first you don't succeed, try again. Very interesting.

1613
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Apologize I didn't get to all the comments, but do check out our Facebook community, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio and Google Plus.

1614
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:22,000
Just search for orange lounge radio to read all of the great comments in their entirety.

1615
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:23,000
In the meantime...

1616
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
Yeah, cause there's some wank going on.

1617
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:26,000
What? Oh, the chatter's mad at you.

1618
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:27,000
You didn't read mine, Rob.

1619
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Well, maybe because I read a lot of your other stuff and you guys call in pretty regularly, so I wanted to read people that don't get to participate as much with the show.

1620
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
So just throw that out there.

1621
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:39,000
I know, but you know, I have to give...

1622
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
You have to fan the flames.

1623
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
I have to fan them.

1624
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Alright.

1625
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:48,000
I'm like, I'm like, um, Karl Lagerfeld and his fan.

1626
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:49,000
But I appreciate...

1627
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:50,000
Without being an asshole.

1628
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:56,000
I appreciate all of the comments and encourage everybody to go read them in their entirety on Facebook and Google Plus.

1629
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Meanwhile, more news.

1630
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:04,000
So the second round of THQ auctions are, well, they're happening.

1631
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:11,000
And apparently the news will be out Monday afternoon on to who has what.

1632
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:22,000
This included back catalog rights and also kind of different lots, including the Darksiders franchise, Red Faction, and Homeworld franchise.

1633
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Of course, you know, the original auctions, you know, sold off the other stuff like Saints Row and that kind of thing.

1634
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:35,000
They're saying they're going to make six to seven million dollars from those sales.

1635
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:46,000
One thing, though, that we do know that's going to happen, the whole crowdfunded movement to buy the rights to Homeworld failed.

1636
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:49,000
They didn't have enough money to win the bid there.

1637
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:53,000
So thankfully they are refunding everyone's money.

1638
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:54,000
So that's nice.

1639
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
So they have that going on.

1640
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
That means somebody put up a lot of money for it.

1641
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
So somebody recognized the value in it.

1642
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
Then somebody outbid those guys.

1643
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:10,000
So they had, I guess it looks like they had around 80 million dollars or set.

1644
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
No, like 70 million.

1645
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:13,000
No, no, no.

1646
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:14,000
Eighty thousand.

1647
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:15,000
I'm sorry.

1648
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
Seventy five thousand dollars.

1649
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
Eighty million dollars.

1650
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
Well, it's the most successful.

1651
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
Saints Row win for that much.

1652
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:24,000
No, no, no.

1653
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:31,000
So eighty thousand dollars is what they had between their Indiegogo and Kickstarter campaigns.

1654
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Unfortunately, they were not able to get it for that.

1655
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
It sold for the Price is Right rules.

1656
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Eighty thousand and one.

1657
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:42,000
All right.

1658
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:47,000
Well, this, I think, is some good news for gaming, because this was just causing a lot of fuckery in court.

1659
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:50,000
And I really can't think of a better word to describe it.

1660
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:59,000
But you might remember that there was a trademark on the term Edge, and this belonged to Tim Langdell, who was the founder of Edge Games.

1661
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:03,000
Well, a court order has stripped him of that trademark.

1662
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:07,000
That's because of a petition by DICE and EA, who made it Mirror's Edge.

1663
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:13,000
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued notice of the canceled registration on April 17th.

1664
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:16,000
This whole thing has been going on since 2010.

1665
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Let's see.

1666
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:25,000
Moby Game made a game called Edge, and they've discounted all versions of the game by 50% in celebration.

1667
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:30,000
The game had been taken down from the App Store previously due to issues with this trademark.

1668
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:34,000
So, you know, anything that had the word Edge in it, this guy was coming for you.

1669
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Hide your wife, hide your edge.

1670
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:39,000
Hmm, that sort of sounds like Ville.

1671
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Yeah, so maybe this will set a very interesting precedent and send a message.

1672
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:48,000
I'm going to create a game called Ville. Just Ville.

1673
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:53,000
I mean, this guy is welcome to call his company Edge Games, I don't have a problem with that.

1674
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:59,000
But where did Edge Games and Mirror's Edge? No. There's no similarity there.

1675
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
It's just like monster cables.

1676
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:04,000
I'm all for this. They should kill off more stupid trademarks.

1677
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:07,000
I can think of a few we've come across in gaming that need to be canceled as well.

1678
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:12,000
So, anyhow. Let's move on to some more news.

1679
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:19,000
In other news. Now, the original link, by the way, didn't work, so I had to hunt it down.

1680
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Oops.

1681
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:29,000
Oh well. It's okay. So, there is a prototype of a Sega machine that was called the Pluto, I believe.

1682
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:35,000
And a guy's posting on Assembler Games forums with pictures of one of the second prototypes.

1683
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:36,000
There were only two of them.

1684
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:46,000
And basically says it's super heavy. It had two controller ports, a flip-top drive bay, a cart slot, a power button, and the reset button.

1685
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:56,000
It still says Saturn on it, but this was, apparently, they were going to brand whatever this Pluto system was with the Saturn name.

1686
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:03,000
When you plug it in, it actually has the Saturn loading screen. The drive empty screen.

1687
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:09,000
So, yeah. Just looking this over. It apparently works.

1688
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:16,000
It was, I'm sorry if I'm having to go through this because, unfortunately, the original thing didn't work for me.

1689
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:25,000
It is region locked, but it is a USA NTSC Saturn. So, that's pretty cool. I think it had the networking capability.

1690
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:32,000
They bought this for a dollar at a Stockton flea market. One dollar.

1691
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:41,000
By the way, turning around and selling it on eBay right now, already up to like $67,000, or $7600.

1692
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:44,000
For real? That was at a flea market? That's crazy.

1693
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
Yeah. The other one was at a garage sale.

1694
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:47,000
Wow.

1695
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
And I think the Stockton area as well.

1696
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:52,000
Yeah, okay. It's a Saturn with a Netlink built in.

1697
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:55,000
This needs to be in my collection, dammit.

1698
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
You have a few thousand dollars to pony up?

1699
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:00,000
No, I have a desire to buy a house.

1700
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
If only you'd been at that flea market.

1701
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
I can't live in a Sega Pluto.

1702
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
You can try.

1703
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
It is pretty big.

1704
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:14,000
I have to say, looking at it, it is pretty burly, but you know what? I have a Saturn and I'm happy with it.

1705
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
Damn, it is a monster though.

1706
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:26,000
I just want to read a quick comment on the Edge thing, because people in chat are still talking about the Edge story, and I think this insight from Dungeon Buster is pretty good in chat.

1707
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:32,000
Langdell picked a fight with EA, and EA decided to litigate his trademark into oblivion and won.

1708
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:36,000
The guy was nuts. He'd sue over anything that he thought infringed on his trademark.

1709
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:40,000
He made up proof that others were using it, which the courts didn't appreciate. It was hilarious.

1710
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:43,000
Again, that's from Dungeon Buster in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

1711
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:48,000
I also do want to repost the forum link, just because people need to see photos of this. It's pretty interesting.

1712
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:49,000
Oh, of the Pluto?

1713
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:54,000
Of the Pluto. I mean, I've seen the Neptune one, because they have it at Classic Gaming Expo every year.

1714
01:52:54,000 --> 01:53:00,000
This thing is huge, and it looks like a Saturn and a Sega CD had an ugly baby.

1715
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:05,000
Poor Pluto keeps getting shit on. It's not a real planet. It's not a real system.

1716
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Good thing we didn't name this show Pluto Lounge Radio, or we might have been in trouble.

1717
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:15,000
Her. No, good thing we weren't Pluto Edge Radio.

1718
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:18,000
Alright.

1719
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,000
You see what I did there?

1720
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:23,000
Loki, were you going to get into something? Sorry, I think I cut you off.

1721
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Yeah, I was going to talk about how successful Microsoft is.

1722
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:33,000
They turned a profit in their third quarter, which just ended March 31st.

1723
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:42,000
And apparently, I guess, $2.53 billion. 56% increase over last year.

1724
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:51,000
And, of course, citing that, you know, obviously, Halo 4 is a big part of that.

1725
01:53:51,000 --> 01:54:07,000
They were saying that, I guess, overall, they said the operating income of $342 million was up from a $242 million loss last year.

1726
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:11,000
So, overall, they're up, but some of their costs went up as well.

1727
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:18,000
And they're saying right now, specifically, Xbox Live memberships grew 18%, now 46 million members.

1728
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:32,000
And they're saying that the console, I guess, it shipped 8.9 million units in the first nine months of fiscal 2013, down 3 million units from the same time last year.

1729
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:36,000
But it's a big spend. It's been out for eight years now.

1730
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
Yeah, yeah. You expect there's going to be a little decline.

1731
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:39,000
Almost eight years.

1732
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
No price drop or anything recently to motivate it, right?

1733
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:42,000
Yeah.

1734
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:48,000
All right. Well, we talked a lot in the first half of our show tonight about the Nintendo Direct conference that happened this week.

1735
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:53,000
But this was something that wasn't really a part of that, probably because this is only happening in Japan.

1736
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:58,000
But I found this interesting. If for nothing else, then it name checks Tumblr, which I know Dark Sakura is into that.

1737
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:02,000
It's a web tool coming out for the 3DS internet browser.

1738
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:08,000
And what you can do is you can share screenshots from certain compatible games right onto Twitter and Tumblr.

1739
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:15,000
The games it supports right now, Animal Crossing New Leaf and Tomodachi Collection New Life, which isn't something we have here.

1740
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
But those are the games that are going to work with the service.

1741
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:23,000
And you can even see in a little screenshot here, you see the games and I guess you take the screenshot and you just put them right up on Twitter and Tumblr.

1742
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:27,000
Which I find interesting that those are the two that are picked, not like Facebook or something.

1743
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:31,000
But again, it's Japan. Facebook might not be in Japan when it is here.

1744
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:35,000
And honestly, do you want more of that shit on your Facebook?

1745
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:37,000
Click block.

1746
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
You're right, I don't want more of that shit on my Facebook.

1747
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
God, Facebook is actually on my shit list for a big reason.

1748
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:48,000
Well, I've been talking bad about it for a long time. Welcome to the party.

1749
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:55,000
Alright, anyhow, no word, however, if this is something that's coming to our side of the pond, we'll see.

1750
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:58,000
I imagine it's one of those things that might surprise us in the future, Nintendo Direct.

1751
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:03,000
I would imagine maybe they are trying to incorporate some other services that are big here.

1752
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:07,000
I can't imagine they wouldn't try to do Facebook. Try to think what other...

1753
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Look, I just hit Tom Nook with a bug catching net.

1754
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:12,000
Right?

1755
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
I just made somebody fall into a hole.

1756
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:22,000
I hope they incorporate more of this stuff. They should do this type of instant screenshotting for virtual console games.

1757
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:29,000
See, I would have loved something like this when I was playing the first, well, technically the second Animal Crossing on GameCube and had my town lesbian.

1758
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:33,000
Or like, look what crazy shit I got this guy to say.

1759
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:41,000
I know, well we had one character because I think we brought over your card to have our town people meet.

1760
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:44,000
And now half of my town members started saying pussy.

1761
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:51,000
And then we brought it over to Adam's house on his wife's game.

1762
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:55,000
And then half of her town started saying it too.

1763
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:58,000
Yeah, I caused an outbreak.

1764
01:56:58,000 --> 01:56:59,000
You're a virus.

1765
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:00,000
I was.

1766
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,000
Rob caused an outbreak of pussy.

1767
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:08,000
I got one that said a really, really nasty word and there was a certain friend at the time that really did not like that word.

1768
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Was it?

1769
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
And it ended up moving to her villa, it ended up moving to her village.

1770
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:19,000
She worked for months to get, from what I hear, to get rid of it.

1771
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Oh man.

1772
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,000
In retrospect, I feel bad.

1773
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:22,000
Memories.

1774
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:26,000
But yeah, memories. Animal Crossing ruining lives, left and right.

1775
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:31,000
Alright, this is the part of the show where we would do the mailbag.

1776
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1777
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
Lol, nope.

1778
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
But, no emails tonight?

1779
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
FreezePop emailed us.

1780
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:43,000
They're selling merchandise to benefit the folks in Boston.

1781
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:46,000
Oh, well that's cool. They are from Bob. That's great.

1782
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:49,000
Yeah, so go check out FreezePop's merchandise. We love FreezePop.

1783
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:52,000
I almost sang Sprode last night and then I was too drunk.

1784
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:58,000
And the reason why I kind of snickered in the beginning is because we get a lot of stuff from them all the time about what's going on.

1785
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:01,000
But that is definitely a cause worth plugging.

1786
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:04,000
Well, I'm going to give it one more refresh just to see.

1787
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:05,000
Just in case?

1788
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:08,000
And if anybody sent me an asshole email in the interim, then you're banned.

1789
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:11,000
Nope.

1790
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
Send us one for next week. Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1791
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:14,000
Send me something funny.

1792
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:18,000
I will throw another plug out here for this. The bumpers.

1793
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:21,000
Now, don't forget, we're looking for more bumpers for the show.

1794
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:24,000
I didn't play one tonight. I have one in the queue. I still need to play.

1795
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:29,000
And I forgot to get it prepped today with all the stuff that was going on today.

1796
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
I had visitors from out of town and all that.

1797
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:34,000
So I didn't get around to doing that, so I apologize.

1798
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:38,000
But you know what? It's okay because if I had played it tonight, I wouldn't have had anything for next week.

1799
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
So don't forget to send in bumpers.

1800
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:43,000
And more details are available at the VOG Network.com forums.

1801
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:46,000
Use your gaming voices to tell people stuff.

1802
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
Alright, what are you...

1803
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:49,000
Something coming up.

1804
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Mewing out over there. Alright.

1805
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:51,000
Something looks hideous.

1806
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
Alright, well let's do the FUs of the week.

1807
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:56,000
Speaking of hideous and wrong.

1808
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
And horrible.

1809
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:16,000
To the girl who is at Panda Express.

1810
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
Not while I'm working there.

1811
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:21,000
She walks up, this girl walks up to my car and says,

1812
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:25,000
Hi, can you please buy us dinner? My mom just lost her job.

1813
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:28,000
Which, she was totally lying.

1814
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:33,000
I mean, it was, she was there with her friends hanging out and drinking cups of water from inside the...

1815
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:34,000
Not an Oscar winner.

1816
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:35,000
No.

1817
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:38,000
And I was like, and so I just said to her, I said, no.

1818
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:41,000
And she's like, but, but we need food.

1819
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:44,000
I was like, there's assistance programs.

1820
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
I'm not even going in Panda Express.

1821
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
And I went into the Rite Aid.

1822
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
Cause it's like right next door.

1823
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:55,000
Cause I wanted to buy cheap crappy sunglasses to wear over my regular glasses.

1824
01:59:55,000 --> 02:00:00,000
And then, so I walked back in to go buy my food.

1825
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
And I'm sorry to get you any kind of sour in the evening.

1826
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:03,000
Can you get that?

1827
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:06,000
It's fine. I actually ended up having Panda earlier today by coincidence.

1828
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
So it works out.

1829
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
Well, so anyway.

1830
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:13,000
By the way, the guy who talked about my hair a couple weeks ago was there and he said,

1831
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
You did your hair that way again?

1832
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:20,000
Um, but, um, the girls were sitting out there just being completely stupid and harassing customers,

1833
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
but they didn't have like any kind of security going on.

1834
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:25,000
They could, they had no way to ask them to leave.

1835
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
So I was like, Oh, I am so sorry.

1836
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
Your customers are being harassed right now.

1837
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:34,000
And then, um, to the Audi, the person driving the Audi who kept trying to pass me.

1838
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:35,000
No.

1839
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
You all know.

1840
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Hello Key.

1841
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:42,000
Um, I don't want to go all Seinfeld, but seriously,

1842
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:45,000
what's up with bicycles built for two?

1843
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:50,000
I mean, seriously, I saw like on the way here, you know, there's a lot of bikers out right now.

1844
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
Like a tandem?

1845
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:57,000
Yeah, like it's a bike with two seats and people both pedal.

1846
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:58,000
Yeah. Okay.

1847
02:00:58,000 --> 02:00:59,000
I don't understand.

1848
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:04,000
You mean like the one in front, one in back, like the classic tandem bicycle or if it had a buggy or something?

1849
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:05,000
No, no, no.

1850
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:09,000
The classic, like you see it in cartoons where they, it's a bicycle built for two.

1851
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:10,000
Riding through the park together.

1852
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Like the method movie.

1853
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:12,000
Yeah.

1854
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:16,000
Like I understand, you know, if you're on vacation or something like, well, let's get a bicycle built for two.

1855
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:21,000
But these were people that were, you know, the bikers that you see out on the road that dress up.

1856
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:24,000
The ones that like have their team sponsors.

1857
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
You're not sponsored by any fucking person.

1858
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:27,000
Okay.

1859
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:28,000
You just have this stupid biker thing.

1860
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
It looks ridiculous.

1861
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
You look ridiculous.

1862
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
And a bicycle built for two.

1863
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:40,000
Like I'm supposed to be convinced that you're training for your bicycle built for two marathon race that you're going to be in.

1864
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:41,000
I mean, come on.

1865
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:42,000
It's just.

1866
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
Now that song is stuck in my head.

1867
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:45,000
It's just weird.

1868
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:46,000
I don't know.

1869
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:49,000
It just annoys me extra.

1870
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:52,000
Uh, my a few of the week, I'll keep it short and sweet.

1871
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:58,000
Um, F F you to those bastards that set the bombs off in Boston.

1872
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:01,000
That was, that was some straight up fucked up crap.

1873
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
So or the MIT shooter.

1874
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:04,000
I am.

1875
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:05,000
That was all.

1876
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:06,000
That was all the same.

1877
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:07,000
That was the same guys.

1878
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:08,000
Oh, yeah.

1879
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
Did you not see the fuckery that blew up everywhere?

1880
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
I just saw that it was somebody I didn't see.

1881
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:13,000
It was the same people.

1882
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:17,000
It was some, it was, it was fucked up, but, um, you know what?

1883
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:29,000
Props to the city for banding together to stay safe and, uh, find the guy and well, they killed one and arrested the other guy who's like half alive right now.

1884
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
So maybe they'll be able to get some answers.

1885
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:34,000
Let's hope these crazies were acting alone, you know?

1886
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:35,000
Right.

1887
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
Let's hope they weren't part of something bigger.

1888
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
And that's, that would be even more fucked up.

1889
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
May I add something to that please?

1890
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:42,000
Please.

1891
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:48,000
Um, also the F you to the people who were going around and showing people on the internet that had absolutely nothing to do with it.

1892
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:51,000
I'm pointing fingers at them because it got a few innocent people arrested.

1893
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
Yeah.

1894
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:54,000
Everybody wants to be a crime.

1895
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:57,000
So everybody's a little bit Nancy Drew.

1896
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:58,000
Stick to the video games.

1897
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
Don't be the Hardy boys.

1898
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:05,000
Bobby Hammond interview with a very nice developer who's making crime games.

1899
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
And if you want to go solve crimes, go play her games.

1900
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:14,000
I do have to agree though that major kudos to the Boston police.

1901
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
All right.

1902
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
But also F you to CNN.

1903
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
God, they fucked up this week.

1904
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:28,000
Anyway, they've been CNN earns fuck up of the year already for me just because of how shitty their coverage is.

1905
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
I go to BBC for my news.

1906
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:43,000
I just, I just wait for the official press conferences because I, the thing I cannot stand, I cannot stand about situations like this is when there's a lull in actual news.

1907
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:46,000
It's let's talk about the why.

1908
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:52,000
Let's theorize on all this crap we don't know about what, why did they do it or make up these theories?

1909
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:55,000
That's the stuff that drives me bonkers when it comes to news.

1910
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
I think you played video games.

1911
02:03:57,000 --> 02:04:05,000
Well, there was that story around about the Moroccan kid who they pulled in because he happened to be there and happened to have a black bag.

1912
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:11,000
He was a runner himself and not in the thing, but he was watching the marathon because it was his passion.

1913
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:12,000
Inspiration.

1914
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:15,000
It's just, it's the whole profiling mentality.

1915
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:16,000
Yeah.

1916
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:21,000
I mean, I'm really, Oh God, I got into it with my mother today too.

1917
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:27,000
I was super disgusted over that sort of closed minded mentality that, Oh, they, why?

1918
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:28,000
They must be in trouble.

1919
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:29,000
Fuck that.

1920
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:30,000
Fuck that.

1921
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:36,000
When you literally cannot get, literally cannot get more Caucasian than these guys.

1922
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:39,000
They were from the caucus mountains.

1923
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:41,000
Hi.

1924
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:44,000
That is like Uber Caucasian.

1925
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
That is literal Caucasian.

1926
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:47,000
I am with Misty.

1927
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:51,000
See shit like this is why I stick to the bloody weather channel.

1928
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:52,000
Amen.

1929
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:53,000
It's going to rain.

1930
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:54,000
You know what?

1931
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:57,000
I'm about ready to sign up for that group going to Mars.

1932
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:58,000
Fuck this planet.

1933
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
I'm gone.

1934
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
Not the show.

1935
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
I will find a way to Skype from Mars.

1936
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:05,000
Just saying.

1937
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:08,000
Can we move on to more gaming news?

1938
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:12,000
Let's talk about green people instead of white people.

1939
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:13,000
Loki.

1940
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:14,000
Uh, yes.

1941
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:22,000
So they have a mod for Skyrim that turns the Argonians into Ninja Turtles.

1942
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:23,000
That looked frightening.

1943
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:28,000
And then if you don't want to be Argonian, you can put the shell on yourself and you

1944
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:35,000
could be like some strange cat turtle or some chick turtle.

1945
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:41,000
The dude that they have in the picture here looks kind of like the rock wearing turtle shell.

1946
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:42,000
He's like, what?

1947
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:43,000
I'm totally serious about this.

1948
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
But yeah, you can check that out.

1949
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:51,000
It's, I don't know if it's on ModDB or if it's actually one of the, it's probably

1950
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:52,000
on ModDB.

1951
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:56,000
And then, or Skyrim Nexus.

1952
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:59,000
Yeah, Skyrim Nexus is where it's at.

1953
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:03,000
And yeah, check it out if that's your thing.

1954
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:07,000
And maybe this gives you an idea of what the new Michael Bay movie is going to look

1955
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:08,000
like.

1956
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:09,000
Because it's terrible.

1957
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:10,000
Alright.

1958
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:16,000
Well, one more story for you guys before we get to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or

1959
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
a username on Skype, OrangeLawnTradio.

1960
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:19,000
This is pretty cool.

1961
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:22,000
A new album being produced for record label Game Chops.

1962
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
It's called World 1-2.

1963
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
It's not just about Mario.

1964
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:31,000
It's about, it's about kind of like what's new and what's going on in, in, uh,

1965
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
bit rock and all that stuff right now.

1966
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:40,000
Uh, including people like super hexagon composer, Chip Zell, um, Manami Matsumae who is, who

1967
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:41,000
did Mega Man.

1968
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:45,000
And we talked about also doing some tracks for Shovel Knight, uh, Austin Wintory contributing

1969
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:46,000
to this.

1970
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
Akira Yamaoka, apparently going to be on this too.

1971
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
I would marry that man.

1972
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:53,000
Uh, the album comes out May 2nd for $10.

1973
02:06:53,000 --> 02:07:00,000
You can check out some of the tracks, uh, on the website music.gamechops.com.

1974
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:04,000
Uh, the full URL is slash album slash world dash one dash two.

1975
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:08,000
But I'm sure if you get yourself to music.gamechops.com, you'll get to see some of this.

1976
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:13,000
Now, sadly, we can't preview the Akira Yamaoka track for you because it's not there, but

1977
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
I could try to play a little bit of this.

1978
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:21,000
This is the Manami, um, Matsumae song, one shot, one kill.

1979
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:22,000
Matsumae.

1980
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:23,000
Excuse me.

1981
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
Can I play this?

1982
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
I won't let you.

1983
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:30,000
I want to play a little bit of it, but it's not working.

1984
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
LOL Live Radio.

1985
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:33,000
Crap.

1986
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:34,000
LOL Live Radio.

1987
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
Let me see if one of these others will work here.

1988
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:41,000
Let's try this Chip Zell track real quick.

1989
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
Da da da da da da.

1990
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:44,000
Live Radio.

1991
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
Yeah, it won't work for some reason.

1992
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
Go to the, you gave them the website.

1993
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:49,000
They can listen to it if they want to.

1994
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:50,000
You can check it out for yourself.

1995
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
After they've listened to us.

1996
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:53,000
So.

1997
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:56,000
Or you can try to run both at the same time, but it might give you a headache.

1998
02:07:56,000 --> 02:08:00,000
1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

1999
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
If you want to give us a call, that would be awesome.

2000
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:03,000
We'll talk.

2001
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:04,000
We can talk about whatever tonight.

2002
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:05,000
I know it's, we're ending.

2003
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:08,000
We're getting to the last part of the show a little sooner than usual, but let's be real.

2004
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
Like the last few shows have all been like three and a half hours.

2005
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:13,000
So now I can go get my grocery shopping.

2006
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:14,000
Right.

2007
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:15,000
Well, we'll see.

2008
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
We still might have some calls coming in that, um, could be a good time.

2009
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:21,000
So again, 1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2010
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
Uh, last minute stories.

2011
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:24,000
Loki.

2012
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:25,000
I don't know if you have anything tonight.

2013
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
I just, I'm shopping on steam.

2014
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
I picked up a surgeon simulator.

2015
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
Of course you did.

2016
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:36,000
And they also have a double pack of breath of death seven and kazoo blue saves the world for 99 cents.

2017
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:37,000
Hmm.

2018
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:38,000
So that's not bad.

2019
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:39,000
Not bad at all.

2020
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
And the portal games were on super sale this weekend.

2021
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:42,000
Yeah.

2022
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:43,000
But I already have portal.

2023
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:44,000
Who does?

2024
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:47,000
I would think most of our listeners pick that up by now, but if you didn't, for whatever reason,

2025
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:50,000
I mean like I was surprised it's not 99 cents yet.

2026
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
It's they'll probably give it away.

2027
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:56,000
They gave portal away literally at one point and I'm sure portal to portal to right.

2028
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
And I think was at a 50% off sale.

2029
02:08:58,000 --> 02:08:59,000
Hmm.

2030
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:00,000
Um, just a few days ago.

2031
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:01,000
Oh yeah.

2032
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
I think that's the whole one this weekend anyway.

2033
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:04,000
Yeah.

2034
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:05,000
All right.

2035
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:06,000
We do have a call coming in.

2036
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:07,000
So let's get to the phones.

2037
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:08,000
Hi.

2038
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:09,000
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2039
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:10,000
Who's this?

2040
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:11,000
Hola.

2041
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:12,000
Bienvenido.

2042
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:13,000
Hey, this is excellent.

2043
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:14,000
Hey, excellent.

2044
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:15,000
How you doing?

2045
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:16,000
Hey, doing good.

2046
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:17,000
Oh, long time.

2047
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:18,000
You'll talk.

2048
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:19,000
How are you?

2049
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:20,000
I've called in here.

2050
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:21,000
Happy a last week.

2051
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:23,000
Thank you very much.

2052
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:24,000
That's been awesome.

2053
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:25,000
500.

2054
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:26,000
That's very, a lot of episodes.

2055
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:27,000
So.

2056
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:31,000
We're so old.

2057
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:34,000
I was calling in because I was decided by Earthbound, but I was a little disappointed

2058
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:38,360
because during the announcements for it, they were saying that it was coming for the Wii

2059
02:09:38,360 --> 02:09:42,760
U and I was hoping that it was also going to come for that for the 3DS because I do

2060
02:09:42,760 --> 02:09:48,360
own the 3DS for that and that is one of my favorite games playing well growing up.

2061
02:09:48,720 --> 02:09:53,440
I don't count out the 3DS, but I have a feeling they know a lot of people want Earthbound

2062
02:09:53,440 --> 02:09:57,440
and so they'll probably keep it exclusive to Wii U because if you could even sell a

2063
02:09:57,440 --> 02:10:01,320
handful of consoles to people that really want to play it again, they'll do it.

2064
02:10:01,320 --> 02:10:04,840
Again, I don't know why you just wouldn't get a Super Nintendo and get the cart, but

2065
02:10:04,840 --> 02:10:10,200
the cart is not exactly, I mean, it still goes on eBay for like 150 bucks.

2066
02:10:10,200 --> 02:10:11,760
I just like the portability of it.

2067
02:10:11,760 --> 02:10:15,640
I like the fact that usually when I go to work, sometimes I take the bus and stuff,

2068
02:10:15,640 --> 02:10:19,400
so it's kind of nice to have it so when I do the bus trips, it usually takes about 30,

2069
02:10:19,400 --> 02:10:20,400
40 minutes.

2070
02:10:20,400 --> 02:10:24,200
I can just sit there and just level up my character or do whatever it takes, just play

2071
02:10:24,200 --> 02:10:25,840
and have fun with it.

2072
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:29,740
Why won't Nintendo just open it up so you buy one, get them on all consoles?

2073
02:10:29,740 --> 02:10:34,640
That would be the great, you know, they're still making money not doing it that way.

2074
02:10:34,640 --> 02:10:38,920
You know, they should take that, but then again, that's a playbook either Sony too.

2075
02:10:38,920 --> 02:10:44,600
Sony kind of does that with some of their games with the PSP to the PS3 or vice versa

2076
02:10:44,600 --> 02:10:45,960
kind of deal to that.

2077
02:10:45,960 --> 02:10:48,480
So I mean, I don't know about the Vita.

2078
02:10:48,480 --> 02:10:50,080
They have done some cross play.

2079
02:10:50,080 --> 02:10:51,960
They have done some cross play that's pretty awesome.

2080
02:10:51,960 --> 02:10:52,960
Like what?

2081
02:10:52,960 --> 02:10:57,980
Retro City Rampage had it and you know, the fighting game, the Super or the All Stars

2082
02:10:57,980 --> 02:11:00,160
PlayStation battle royale.

2083
02:11:00,160 --> 02:11:03,680
I was referring more to the fact that like you buy some like their quote unquote arcade

2084
02:11:03,680 --> 02:11:07,600
games or lower end games like the pinball and stuff that you can actually play on both

2085
02:11:07,600 --> 02:11:10,400
systems without worrying about rebinding it like six times.

2086
02:11:10,400 --> 02:11:15,000
So I got nothing against it because believe it or not, here in the household here between

2087
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:18,400
me and my girlfriend, we had bought Plants vs Zombies like six different times for six

2088
02:11:18,400 --> 02:11:20,600
different, almost six different forms of platforms.

2089
02:11:20,600 --> 02:11:24,320
I think a lot of people did.

2090
02:11:24,320 --> 02:11:26,960
So you know, I do look forward to that.

2091
02:11:26,960 --> 02:11:29,760
Also really quickly, Rob, you really love League of Legends.

2092
02:11:29,760 --> 02:11:31,320
I would love to sit there and play with you.

2093
02:11:31,320 --> 02:11:33,720
I think you would have a lot of fun with that over DOA.

2094
02:11:33,720 --> 02:11:37,200
DOA is just, the game is a lot of fun.

2095
02:11:37,200 --> 02:11:43,460
There is a lot of different stuff they did with that through Steam and the Steam workshop

2096
02:11:43,460 --> 02:11:48,280
but also to the player base on there is a horde compared to that of League of Legends.

2097
02:11:48,280 --> 02:11:52,560
I swear I'm going to give League of Legends the good old once over but I got to finish

2098
02:11:52,560 --> 02:11:53,560
up a game.

2099
02:11:53,560 --> 02:11:56,580
I got to write a review for it first and then I can get into League of Legends over the

2100
02:11:56,580 --> 02:12:00,600
next week while there's still not a lot going on for me in WoW right now.

2101
02:12:00,600 --> 02:12:04,360
Well, it's one of those games where it's nice enough where I can go in there and play

2102
02:12:04,360 --> 02:12:06,520
a game for an hour or two and not worry about anything.

2103
02:12:06,520 --> 02:12:10,080
Like right now I'm level 19 out of 30 so I'm working my way up to 30 right now but

2104
02:12:10,080 --> 02:12:14,980
it's nice enough where I can sit there and play a game or two and not worry about that.

2105
02:12:14,980 --> 02:12:18,120
You know, I have to worry about subscription fee or anything like that on some other games

2106
02:12:18,120 --> 02:12:19,120
like WoW or something.

2107
02:12:19,120 --> 02:12:21,760
What worries me most about League of Legends though is the other people.

2108
02:12:21,760 --> 02:12:24,500
I hear the community is really awful in League of Legends.

2109
02:12:24,500 --> 02:12:29,200
No offense to the fans out there but I have heard your community is really awful.

2110
02:12:29,200 --> 02:12:33,580
There is a lot of people that are really awful in the game but there's also a lot of good

2111
02:12:33,580 --> 02:12:34,580
people in the game.

2112
02:12:35,140 --> 02:12:37,660
But WoW is not that much worse.

2113
02:12:37,660 --> 02:12:39,900
Look at the people on there from Cal and stuff.

2114
02:12:39,900 --> 02:12:45,780
I mean, it's just the horror stories I can tell you just sitting here talking about that.

2115
02:12:45,780 --> 02:12:47,220
But that's with any game in general.

2116
02:12:47,220 --> 02:12:50,820
You're going to have the good along with the bad.

2117
02:12:50,820 --> 02:12:52,940
That's the fun of it like playing with friends and stuff.

2118
02:12:52,940 --> 02:12:55,940
That way you don't have to worry about that so much.

2119
02:12:55,940 --> 02:12:58,620
It's like one of those things where if you do something wrong or something people will

2120
02:12:58,620 --> 02:13:01,620
point it out saying, hey, by the way, you do not do this right.

2121
02:13:01,620 --> 02:13:03,220
You should do this instead.

2122
02:13:03,220 --> 02:13:05,380
Just follow this or go here and look at this.

2123
02:13:05,380 --> 02:13:08,620
It's kind of like they do in WoW and it's kind of nice to know that there is a lot of

2124
02:13:08,620 --> 02:13:13,540
people that is willing to work as long as there is a lot of good as there is bad with

2125
02:13:13,540 --> 02:13:15,540
a lot of games.

2126
02:13:15,540 --> 02:13:18,340
I will give League of Legends a serious try.

2127
02:13:18,340 --> 02:13:22,580
I've fired it up a couple times but I haven't done anything serious with it but I will take

2128
02:13:22,580 --> 02:13:26,620
my friend's offer to help school me a little bit on it and I'll let you guys all know

2129
02:13:26,620 --> 02:13:27,620
how it turns out.

2130
02:13:27,620 --> 02:13:28,620
But give me a couple weeks.

2131
02:13:28,620 --> 02:13:29,620
Give me a couple weeks.

2132
02:13:29,620 --> 02:13:32,220
Like I said before, if you need any pointers or anything, I'll be more than happy to

2133
02:13:32,220 --> 02:13:34,700
How about I kick your ass at it?

2134
02:13:34,700 --> 02:13:35,700
Yeah, okay.

2135
02:13:35,700 --> 02:13:36,700
You want to do that, that's fine.

2136
02:13:36,700 --> 02:13:38,180
Be more than happy to do that.

2137
02:13:38,180 --> 02:13:40,500
Play a one-on-one game with you.

2138
02:13:40,500 --> 02:13:42,780
I can stream it on Twitch like everybody else.

2139
02:13:42,780 --> 02:13:43,780
It'll be fun.

2140
02:13:43,780 --> 02:13:44,780
All right.

2141
02:13:44,780 --> 02:13:45,780
Excellent.

2142
02:13:45,780 --> 02:13:47,340
Anything else you want to share with our listeners tonight?

2143
02:13:47,340 --> 02:13:48,980
That's pretty much about it for right now.

2144
02:13:48,980 --> 02:13:49,980
All right.

2145
02:13:49,980 --> 02:13:50,980
We'll have a good one.

2146
02:13:50,980 --> 02:13:52,620
I was going to get my input out of Earthbound and stuff.

2147
02:13:52,620 --> 02:13:56,340
I'm also kind of worried too, the wondering what they're going to do because now they're

2148
02:13:56,340 --> 02:13:57,780
announcing this out for so many years.

2149
02:13:57,780 --> 02:14:01,340
I'm kind of wondering if they're going to sugarcoat it or take stuff out or what they're

2150
02:14:01,340 --> 02:14:04,180
going to do to replace it because I know a lot of the issues they were having with

2151
02:14:04,180 --> 02:14:05,700
that was with the music.

2152
02:14:05,700 --> 02:14:08,940
So I'm kind of curious to know what they're going to do to get around that.

2153
02:14:08,940 --> 02:14:13,340
I am very curious as well to see if it comes out unedited or if they make any changes.

2154
02:14:13,340 --> 02:14:17,060
It will be very interesting because they're not going to announce it until it's already

2155
02:14:17,060 --> 02:14:18,060
out.

2156
02:14:18,060 --> 02:14:19,060
So we'll see.

2157
02:14:19,060 --> 02:14:20,060
Yeah, of course.

2158
02:14:20,060 --> 02:14:22,140
So that's probably an E3 thing too.

2159
02:14:22,140 --> 02:14:24,220
As long as the happy, happy cultists are still there.

2160
02:14:24,220 --> 02:14:25,220
They're my favorite.

2161
02:14:25,220 --> 02:14:26,220
All right.

2162
02:14:26,220 --> 02:14:27,620
I'm sure it will be.

2163
02:14:27,620 --> 02:14:29,980
They remind me of Shane because everything has to be blue.

2164
02:14:29,980 --> 02:14:30,980
Blue, blue, blue, blue.

2165
02:14:31,620 --> 02:14:32,620
All right.

2166
02:14:32,620 --> 02:14:33,620
Take care, buddy.

2167
02:14:33,620 --> 02:14:34,620
You have a good night, man.

2168
02:14:34,620 --> 02:14:35,620
I'll talk to you later.

2169
02:14:35,620 --> 02:14:36,620
You too.

2170
02:14:36,620 --> 02:14:37,620
Bye.

2171
02:14:37,620 --> 02:14:38,620
Bye.

2172
02:14:38,620 --> 02:14:42,820
1877 game OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2173
02:14:42,820 --> 02:14:43,820
All one word.

2174
02:14:43,820 --> 02:14:48,140
I am still, by the way, singing the praises of Drunken Robot Pornography.

2175
02:14:48,140 --> 02:14:49,140
Oh, yeah.

2176
02:14:49,140 --> 02:14:51,220
You've been raving about that game on Steam and all that.

2177
02:14:51,220 --> 02:14:52,220
Everyone needs to play it.

2178
02:14:52,220 --> 02:14:53,220
It's hard as hell, but fun.

2179
02:14:53,220 --> 02:14:54,220
It has a catchy theme song.

2180
02:14:54,220 --> 02:14:55,220
It has a very catchy theme song.

2181
02:14:55,220 --> 02:14:57,220
Have you played it?

2182
02:14:57,220 --> 02:14:58,220
No.

2183
02:14:58,220 --> 02:14:59,220
You need it.

2184
02:14:59,220 --> 02:15:00,220
How much is it?

2185
02:15:00,460 --> 02:15:01,460
That's not bad.

2186
02:15:01,460 --> 02:15:02,460
All right.

2187
02:15:02,460 --> 02:15:03,460
Let's go to the next call.

2188
02:15:03,460 --> 02:15:04,460
Hi.

2189
02:15:04,460 --> 02:15:05,460
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2190
02:15:05,460 --> 02:15:06,460
Who's this?

2191
02:15:06,460 --> 02:15:07,460
That's the one and only Ranma.

2192
02:15:07,460 --> 02:15:08,460
Hey, buddy.

2193
02:15:08,460 --> 02:15:09,460
How you doing?

2194
02:15:09,460 --> 02:15:10,460
Hi, John.

2195
02:15:10,460 --> 02:15:11,460
Hey.

2196
02:15:11,460 --> 02:15:12,460
I'm doing good.

2197
02:15:12,460 --> 02:15:13,460
I'm doing good.

2198
02:15:13,460 --> 02:15:14,460
I saw that Dark Sakura made some new album art for Anime Jam Session.

2199
02:15:14,460 --> 02:15:15,460
It looks good.

2200
02:15:15,460 --> 02:15:16,460
Yeah.

2201
02:15:16,460 --> 02:15:17,460
I mean-

2202
02:15:17,460 --> 02:15:18,460
She wants to fix the misspelling.

2203
02:15:18,460 --> 02:15:19,460
No.

2204
02:15:19,460 --> 02:15:22,220
She took my idea and just took it to the next level because that was not what I was expecting.

2205
02:15:22,220 --> 02:15:26,220
I'm just like, the entire staff pretty much loves the new logo.

2206
02:15:26,220 --> 02:15:27,220
Great.

2207
02:15:27,220 --> 02:15:28,980
Well, I'm glad that you like it.

2208
02:15:28,980 --> 02:15:30,380
Now tell people to hire me.

2209
02:15:30,380 --> 02:15:31,700
I did.

2210
02:15:31,700 --> 02:15:36,700
If you go to the official Facebook page, there is a link to your fan page where people can

2211
02:15:36,700 --> 02:15:37,700
contact you for commissions.

2212
02:15:37,700 --> 02:15:38,700
There you go.

2213
02:15:38,700 --> 02:15:40,460
Well, I would appreciate that.

2214
02:15:40,460 --> 02:15:41,460
Trust me.

2215
02:15:41,460 --> 02:15:44,460
I did not mean to derail your call with singing the praises of Dark Sakura.

2216
02:15:44,460 --> 02:15:45,460
What's on your mind tonight?

2217
02:15:45,460 --> 02:15:46,460
I did though.

2218
02:15:46,460 --> 02:15:49,180
It's a couple of things.

2219
02:15:49,180 --> 02:15:50,940
It's a little bit different from what you were talking about.

2220
02:15:50,940 --> 02:15:54,420
It's something I've been meaning to bring up in conversation prior.

2221
02:15:54,420 --> 02:15:55,500
Okay.

2222
02:15:55,500 --> 02:16:01,420
I remember Loki bitching about Smart Glass and truth be told, I understand where he's

2223
02:16:01,420 --> 02:16:11,360
coming from, but my thing is with Smart Glass and the new upcoming Xbox, I'd like to see

2224
02:16:11,360 --> 02:16:15,660
Microsoft use more Smart Glass integration when playing games.

2225
02:16:15,660 --> 02:16:22,580
I'd also like to see Sony get on the bandwagon with the PS4 because truth be told, not everybody's

2226
02:16:22,580 --> 02:16:27,600
going to have a Vita and if you're going to be beaming stuff to the Vita, which its

2227
02:16:27,600 --> 02:16:33,980
operating system is slightly similar to Android, maybe we can get a little app on our tablet

2228
02:16:33,980 --> 02:16:36,220
so we can have a little fun with that too.

2229
02:16:36,220 --> 02:16:42,980
I'm not sure it can work as fast as say a Wii U because a Wii U uses that whole dedicated

2230
02:16:42,980 --> 02:16:46,180
broadcasting channel to transmit to the pad.

2231
02:16:46,180 --> 02:16:50,820
It's a lot different than the technology in something like Smart Glass where your little

2232
02:16:50,820 --> 02:16:56,860
iDevice beams to your wireless and the Xbox or whatever is on that same device, everything's

2233
02:16:56,860 --> 02:16:58,420
kind of running through your router.

2234
02:16:58,420 --> 02:17:03,140
It actually slows things down a lot so it's not like your device can be a controller suddenly

2235
02:17:03,140 --> 02:17:04,260
or anything like that.

2236
02:17:04,260 --> 02:17:05,980
It's not going to work like that.

2237
02:17:05,980 --> 02:17:09,900
I wouldn't want it as a controller but like a secondary screen or something like that.

2238
02:17:09,900 --> 02:17:13,060
The weird thing about it is that that's what I always thought Smart Glass was supposed

2239
02:17:13,060 --> 02:17:16,500
to be and Smart Glass was really implemented poorly.

2240
02:17:16,500 --> 02:17:20,200
It's another example of something that Microsoft really half-assed.

2241
02:17:20,200 --> 02:17:24,080
They put on a great show at E3 and then they half-assed their way through it.

2242
02:17:24,080 --> 02:17:27,920
Connect Labs is another great example, Game Room.

2243
02:17:27,920 --> 02:17:34,000
They half-assed a lot of this shit, they didn't see it, XNA, sorry about it, but they didn't

2244
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,360
really give it the due that it deserved.

2245
02:17:36,360 --> 02:17:38,360
The vision camera.

2246
02:17:38,360 --> 02:17:40,960
The vision camera, I mean the list goes on and on.

2247
02:17:40,960 --> 02:17:45,160
Just add Smart Glass to the list, it's really unfortunate because you kind of see the potential

2248
02:17:45,160 --> 02:17:48,320
there, especially with it being such a media device.

2249
02:17:48,320 --> 02:17:53,880
Then watch, at E3 this year when they're selling their little dedicated channel, they're going

2250
02:17:53,880 --> 02:17:57,680
to push the second screen technology again, they're going to push Smart Glass again.

2251
02:17:57,680 --> 02:18:01,400
But I really hope to hell someone calls them out on it like, well wasn't this supposed

2252
02:18:01,400 --> 02:18:04,240
to be there already and like what?

2253
02:18:04,240 --> 02:18:09,120
A handful of movies have it and then Dance Central and Halo.

2254
02:18:09,120 --> 02:18:14,020
And all Halo does is launch what is a separate app anyway.

2255
02:18:14,020 --> 02:18:15,520
You can download it as a separate app.

2256
02:18:15,520 --> 02:18:20,880
And I still can't, you know, Forza or whatever, that's another one, Forza Horizon uses it,

2257
02:18:20,880 --> 02:18:25,700
I still can't on my Android device actually pull up the map.

2258
02:18:25,700 --> 02:18:30,240
It doesn't have any of that actual Smart Glass function, it's just, hey look, Xbox apps,

2259
02:18:30,240 --> 02:18:31,660
we renamed the Smart Glass.

2260
02:18:31,660 --> 02:18:35,960
Smart Glass ought to be a hell of a lot better than it is, and it's really disappointing.

2261
02:18:35,960 --> 02:18:39,920
I mean they could be doing these, like it might not be fast enough to be controllers,

2262
02:18:39,920 --> 02:18:44,400
he can't even do like little submenus and things like that, but why not maps of levels

2263
02:18:44,400 --> 02:18:45,640
that you're playing?

2264
02:18:45,640 --> 02:18:51,120
Like static images that change, you know, it just, it blows my mind how ridiculous it

2265
02:18:51,120 --> 02:18:52,120
is.

2266
02:18:52,120 --> 02:18:56,680
And you're right, and I don't mean to cut you off, but you're right, but because of

2267
02:18:56,680 --> 02:19:01,920
the WiFi frequency, I mean, it is not as fast, but it gets up there because Smart Glass is

2268
02:19:01,920 --> 02:19:05,640
pretty much like an over-glorified controller.

2269
02:19:05,640 --> 02:19:06,920
That's pretty much what it is.

2270
02:19:06,920 --> 02:19:16,200
Hell, I use my tablet to tell it to play videos on YouTube on my TV through to 360 or to PS3.

2271
02:19:16,200 --> 02:19:17,200
That is awesome.

2272
02:19:17,200 --> 02:19:18,200
You know, it's pretty cool.

2273
02:19:18,200 --> 02:19:19,200
You know, pretty fast.

2274
02:19:19,200 --> 02:19:22,560
Here's the thing though, the new system is supposed to be running on Bluetooth versus

2275
02:19:22,560 --> 02:19:27,600
this WiFi thing, now they can have an app that directly communicates with it via Bluetooth

2276
02:19:27,600 --> 02:19:32,000
instead of over WiFi, and so you're going to have less latency, and you can do more

2277
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,760
amazing things with it.

2278
02:19:34,760 --> 02:19:41,280
Well, E3 is going to be Microsoft touting all these features again, but we'll see

2279
02:19:41,280 --> 02:19:46,360
how many of them actually, excuse me, actually get implemented to its fullest.

2280
02:19:46,360 --> 02:19:47,360
Yep.

2281
02:19:47,360 --> 02:19:50,160
All right, anything else you want to share with us today?

2282
02:19:50,160 --> 02:19:52,560
I have a funny Paxi story.

2283
02:19:52,560 --> 02:19:54,280
Okay, go for it.

2284
02:19:54,280 --> 02:19:58,840
So we're all in one of the rooms, we're all sitting there, you know, we have our 3DSs

2285
02:19:58,840 --> 02:20:03,800
out, we're, you know, we're swapnoting and cross-friending and all that cool stuff.

2286
02:20:03,840 --> 02:20:07,760
And then Bobby happens to, you know, walk out of the room because he had to go take

2287
02:20:07,760 --> 02:20:08,760
care of something.

2288
02:20:08,760 --> 02:20:15,520
One of my friends in the room, he's going through his friends list, and he's like,

2289
02:20:15,520 --> 02:20:20,040
oh, Bobby Blackwell, I'm friending with him now.

2290
02:20:20,040 --> 02:20:26,980
Now, he just said it very nonchalantly, now the entire room just gets quiet and looks

2291
02:20:26,980 --> 02:20:27,980
at him.

2292
02:20:27,980 --> 02:20:29,920
And he's like, what?

2293
02:20:29,920 --> 02:20:32,840
I say, um, that was Bobby Blackwell.

2294
02:20:32,880 --> 02:20:37,040
He just walked out the room.

2295
02:20:37,040 --> 02:20:40,200
So this is somebody that was like a fan of the show that had no idea that Bobby was the

2296
02:20:40,200 --> 02:20:41,200
right in front of him?

2297
02:20:41,200 --> 02:20:44,640
My friend Paul, who goes by the name of Oshie, he used to be, I think he used to be like

2298
02:20:44,640 --> 02:20:51,480
a mod on the G4 forums in the chat room, so they go way back, so it's like, he didn't

2299
02:20:51,480 --> 02:20:53,880
realize that was Bobby in the room.

2300
02:20:53,880 --> 02:20:54,880
That's funny.

2301
02:20:54,880 --> 02:20:59,860
And we kind of raised, we kind of gave him hell for that the whole weekend.

2302
02:20:59,860 --> 02:21:00,860
That's funny.

2303
02:21:00,860 --> 02:21:04,980
Especially through this radio thing, I've met some people and they're like, you know,

2304
02:21:04,980 --> 02:21:09,220
you don't look anything like you sound, and I'm just like, all right, how do you respond

2305
02:21:09,220 --> 02:21:10,220
to that?

2306
02:21:10,220 --> 02:21:11,220
I think Bobby looks like a Bobby.

2307
02:21:11,220 --> 02:21:14,420
I don't know how to respond to that.

2308
02:21:14,420 --> 02:21:15,900
Is that an insult or a compliment?

2309
02:21:15,900 --> 02:21:17,900
It could go either way.

2310
02:21:17,900 --> 02:21:24,200
Rob, I still remember that cat to come walking around in the dealer's room, not even five

2311
02:21:24,200 --> 02:21:28,460
minutes in, the guy goes, you're Rob Roberts from Orange Lounge Radio.

2312
02:21:28,460 --> 02:21:29,460
Yeah.

2313
02:21:29,460 --> 02:21:30,460
Blush.

2314
02:21:31,060 --> 02:21:32,060
Yeah, that happened.

2315
02:21:32,060 --> 02:21:36,260
You remember when we were at John's Incredibly Shitty Pizza and one of our listeners was

2316
02:21:36,260 --> 02:21:37,260
there?

2317
02:21:37,260 --> 02:21:38,260
Hi, listener!

2318
02:21:38,260 --> 02:21:44,340
It's a very nice, like, it's an uber compliment, but one thing to remember, guys, like, I'm

2319
02:21:44,340 --> 02:21:46,020
not Tom Cruise, okay?

2320
02:21:46,020 --> 02:21:47,020
I'm really-

2321
02:21:47,020 --> 02:21:48,020
Thank God!

2322
02:21:48,020 --> 02:21:49,020
Thank God I'm not.

2323
02:21:49,020 --> 02:21:50,020
But I'm really-

2324
02:21:50,020 --> 02:21:51,020
You're like more Tom Cruise.

2325
02:21:51,020 --> 02:21:54,740
I'm a fan of video games just like the rest of you guys, so like, you know, when people

2326
02:21:54,740 --> 02:21:59,140
are like, oh my God, you're Rob, I'm just like, yeah, I'm Rob, hey, how you doing?

2327
02:21:59,140 --> 02:22:00,140
Tell me about yourself.

2328
02:22:00,140 --> 02:22:01,140
You know?

2329
02:22:01,140 --> 02:22:03,940
You've been listening to me for all this time, tell me about you.

2330
02:22:03,940 --> 02:22:08,980
So yeah, it's very humbling, but very flattering.

2331
02:22:08,980 --> 02:22:09,980
Cindy.

2332
02:22:09,980 --> 02:22:10,980
All right.

2333
02:22:10,980 --> 02:22:15,620
Well, I'm going to let you go, Rama, to see if anybody else comes through, okay?

2334
02:22:15,620 --> 02:22:16,620
You got it, bro.

2335
02:22:16,620 --> 02:22:17,620
All right, take care, buddy.

2336
02:22:17,620 --> 02:22:18,620
You too.

2337
02:22:18,620 --> 02:22:19,620
All right, Trun Trun.

2338
02:22:19,620 --> 02:22:20,620
Later.

2339
02:22:20,620 --> 02:22:21,620
All right.

2340
02:22:21,620 --> 02:22:27,300
1-877-GAMO-LR, or username on Skype is Orange- You all right over there in the kitchen?

2341
02:22:27,300 --> 02:22:28,300
Allen's making a mess.

2342
02:22:28,460 --> 02:22:33,900
All right, let's go to some tweets, twitter.com slash O-L-R. Tiger Claw is sending us a tweet.

2343
02:22:33,900 --> 02:22:35,620
You guys might have read about this in the news.

2344
02:22:35,620 --> 02:22:39,220
LulzSec member sentenced for Sony Pictures website hacking.

2345
02:22:39,220 --> 02:22:42,780
Yeah, they went after some of those guys that were involved in that and it looks like they've

2346
02:22:42,780 --> 02:22:48,060
sentenced a few of them and one of them for the hacking of Sony Pictures website.

2347
02:22:48,060 --> 02:22:51,660
Not related to the Sony PlayStation network hack though, right?

2348
02:22:51,660 --> 02:22:52,660
No.

2349
02:22:52,660 --> 02:22:53,660
Different, right?

2350
02:22:53,660 --> 02:22:54,660
Interesting.

2351
02:22:54,660 --> 02:22:55,660
Let's go to the phones.

2352
02:22:55,660 --> 02:22:57,140
We have one more call coming in we'll take.

2353
02:22:57,140 --> 02:22:58,140
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2354
02:22:58,180 --> 02:22:59,180
Who's this?

2355
02:22:59,180 --> 02:23:00,700
Hey, this is Prince Brightstar.

2356
02:23:00,700 --> 02:23:01,700
Hey, Prince Brightstar.

2357
02:23:01,700 --> 02:23:02,700
Hi.

2358
02:23:02,700 --> 02:23:03,700
How are you?

2359
02:23:03,700 --> 02:23:04,700
Doing good, yourself?

2360
02:23:04,700 --> 02:23:05,700
Good.

2361
02:23:05,700 --> 02:23:08,620
Now, you are the listener that was listening last week and you're like, this is my first

2362
02:23:08,620 --> 02:23:14,300
show in a long time, but I remember when you came to visit a very long time ago, right?

2363
02:23:14,300 --> 02:23:15,300
That's right.

2364
02:23:15,300 --> 02:23:16,980
Summer of 2003, I think.

2365
02:23:16,980 --> 02:23:21,660
To put it in perspective, you were out here at the tech TV buildings, right?

2366
02:23:21,660 --> 02:23:22,660
Right, exactly.

2367
02:23:22,660 --> 02:23:23,660
This show's-

2368
02:23:23,660 --> 02:23:26,820
And I'll never forgive Comcast for what they did.

2369
02:23:26,820 --> 02:23:27,820
I know.

2370
02:23:28,020 --> 02:23:31,940
Isn't it weird now that that's all really, really over, huh?

2371
02:23:31,940 --> 02:23:32,940
I know.

2372
02:23:32,940 --> 02:23:34,340
But, you know what?

2373
02:23:34,340 --> 02:23:37,260
Props to Attack of the Show for the ending.

2374
02:23:37,260 --> 02:23:41,900
That was a very nice way to end the show with the nod to a Leo Laporte and Alex and so forth.

2375
02:23:41,900 --> 02:23:49,180
Yeah, and I know Leo Laporte is still doing his podcast and such, and I think Chris Parilla

2376
02:23:49,180 --> 02:23:50,340
is doing live streaming.

2377
02:23:50,340 --> 02:23:55,180
Yeah, they have a studio in the North Bay out in Petaluma, I think it's located.

2378
02:23:55,180 --> 02:23:59,140
Everybody I know went over there for something, and yeah, so it's cool that they still kind

2379
02:23:59,140 --> 02:24:00,140
of have all that in the Bay Area.

2380
02:24:00,140 --> 02:24:03,860
It might not be in the city, but it's, you know, they're producing great content outside

2381
02:24:03,860 --> 02:24:04,860
the city.

2382
02:24:04,860 --> 02:24:05,860
Right.

2383
02:24:05,860 --> 02:24:09,260
Anyhow, I didn't mean to derail you, but what's on your mind tonight?

2384
02:24:09,260 --> 02:24:13,740
So once again, I did want to wish you congrats on the 500th episode.

2385
02:24:13,740 --> 02:24:14,740
Thank you.

2386
02:24:14,740 --> 02:24:16,700
Can you believe we're still here?

2387
02:24:16,700 --> 02:24:17,700
I know.

2388
02:24:17,700 --> 02:24:23,260
I feel old, and I need to see if I can find the old episode where I was there.

2389
02:24:23,780 --> 02:24:25,740
Do you remember what episode number it was?

2390
02:24:25,740 --> 02:24:26,740
I do not.

2391
02:24:26,740 --> 02:24:30,320
I know it was summer of 2003, but that's all I remember.

2392
02:24:30,320 --> 02:24:31,460
Two tips for you.

2393
02:24:31,460 --> 02:24:37,580
There is the Orange Lounge Radio Wiki, which is orangeloungeradio.wiki.com, and Dark Tetsuya

2394
02:24:37,580 --> 02:24:41,580
has put together an awesome little summary of like every single episode, so if you look

2395
02:24:41,580 --> 02:24:46,100
at the summer of 2003, you might find the topics, and you might go like, oh, I was there

2396
02:24:46,100 --> 02:24:47,440
when that happened.

2397
02:24:47,440 --> 02:24:51,220
And then there's another website, and Dark Tetsuya will correct me if I'm wrong on this,

2398
02:24:51,220 --> 02:24:56,980
but I think it's OLRxiv, I think it's O-L-R-C-H-I-V-E dot T-K.

2399
02:24:56,980 --> 02:25:00,740
I think he had to change the forwarder, so he'll give me the new address here in chat

2400
02:25:00,740 --> 02:25:05,540
in a minute, but look forward to the VOG Network forums, look for Dark Tetsuya.

2401
02:25:05,540 --> 02:25:10,820
He has the OLRxiv, and there's a lot of old episodes they have up on like a SkyDrive somewhere,

2402
02:25:10,820 --> 02:25:13,620
so there's a lot, a lot of old shit.

2403
02:25:13,620 --> 02:25:14,620
Gotcha.

2404
02:25:14,620 --> 02:25:15,620
You might find it.

2405
02:25:15,620 --> 02:25:16,620
All right, I'll have to check them out.

2406
02:25:16,620 --> 02:25:17,620
Thank you for the hookup, by the way.

2407
02:25:17,620 --> 02:25:18,620
Thank you.

2408
02:25:18,620 --> 02:25:19,620
There it is from Dark Tetsuya.

2409
02:25:19,620 --> 02:25:24,300
O-L-R-C-H-I-V-E dot L-Y, so bit.ly slash O-L-R-C-H-I-V-E.

2410
02:25:24,300 --> 02:25:27,220
So if you want to, and this goes out to the general listenership as well, if you want

2411
02:25:27,220 --> 02:25:30,940
to hear what Orange Andrado sounded like back in 2003, you can check that out.

2412
02:25:30,940 --> 02:25:33,100
But I do want to, I always kind of put this out there.

2413
02:25:33,100 --> 02:25:35,260
It was a very different show back then.

2414
02:25:35,260 --> 02:25:40,940
I was busy reading Harry Potter anyway.

2415
02:25:40,940 --> 02:25:45,380
So part of the reason why I'm calling here tonight as well, Dark Sakura, I just sent

2416
02:25:45,380 --> 02:25:49,460
over the details for Phantasy Star Online 2 for you.

2417
02:25:49,460 --> 02:25:53,300
But there's something on my mind aside from that that I kind of want to get out there.

2418
02:25:53,300 --> 02:25:55,220
It's got me a little bit worried here.

2419
02:25:55,220 --> 02:25:56,700
What did I do?

2420
02:25:56,700 --> 02:26:01,500
Regarding that game, it was announced that it was supposed to come out here in the West.

2421
02:26:01,500 --> 02:26:07,960
And then we rolled past the release date and all Sega had to say was, it's delayed and

2422
02:26:07,960 --> 02:26:09,980
nothing else.

2423
02:26:09,980 --> 02:26:14,300
And that's not the first time that this has happened.

2424
02:26:14,300 --> 02:26:17,380
Colonial Marines, that just happened as well for the Wii U.

2425
02:26:17,380 --> 02:26:22,220
Obviously that's under a different company, but it's got me wondering what's up with the

2426
02:26:22,220 --> 02:26:27,540
management because there have been other incidences with Sega recently, such as the recent Shining

2427
02:26:27,540 --> 02:26:30,180
Force debacle back in November.

2428
02:26:30,180 --> 02:26:36,460
It's kind of got me wondering what's going on there and are we potentially seeing Sega

2429
02:26:36,460 --> 02:26:38,800
of America closing soon?

2430
02:26:38,800 --> 02:26:42,140
When has Sega had good management in the US?

2431
02:26:42,140 --> 02:26:47,060
I am hoping you are just out here yelling the sky is falling, which is perfectly valid.

2432
02:26:47,060 --> 02:26:49,740
You have good reason for thinking that.

2433
02:26:49,740 --> 02:26:55,060
But I would say E3 is kind of Sega's chance to be like, alright, put it out on the table.

2434
02:26:55,060 --> 02:26:56,060
What's coming?

2435
02:26:56,060 --> 02:26:58,260
Is Phantasy Star 2 on that list or not?

2436
02:26:58,260 --> 02:27:01,740
And if it's not, then I would start to get worried.

2437
02:27:01,740 --> 02:27:04,780
But I kind of think that's the type of thing they keep in their pants till E3.

2438
02:27:04,780 --> 02:27:08,460
I seriously think that Sega is still going to have a US presence regardless, even if

2439
02:27:08,460 --> 02:27:10,260
they have to cut back operations here.

2440
02:27:10,260 --> 02:27:14,020
Well sure, a lot of Japanese companies still have an American presence in the games industry.

2441
02:27:14,020 --> 02:27:15,020
True.

2442
02:27:15,020 --> 02:27:20,940
They may have the translations done in-house at Sega of Japan, but I was just at PAX East

2443
02:27:20,940 --> 02:27:22,940
recently, they did not have a booth there.

2444
02:27:22,940 --> 02:27:25,860
So that's part of what's got me thinking this.

2445
02:27:25,860 --> 02:27:29,060
That is, I mean, PAX is kind of hit and miss.

2446
02:27:29,060 --> 02:27:33,000
It depends if they have something to show or not, but you know, there are some companies

2447
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:34,700
that don't really do PAX.

2448
02:27:34,700 --> 02:27:36,840
I mean like, take Blizzard for example.

2449
02:27:36,840 --> 02:27:39,740
They were there at PAX East because they had something to show with this whole new like

2450
02:27:39,740 --> 02:27:42,340
Hearthstone game, but they don't usually do these cons.

2451
02:27:42,340 --> 02:27:44,580
Well Blizzard is like, LOL, we'll do our own cons.

2452
02:27:44,580 --> 02:27:46,540
But yeah, that's actually just it.

2453
02:27:46,540 --> 02:27:50,060
They don't usually do these things, so they kind of do it when it's convenient for them,

2454
02:27:50,060 --> 02:27:51,560
which I don't blame them for.

2455
02:27:51,560 --> 02:27:53,500
For the record, I would go to SegaCon.

2456
02:27:53,500 --> 02:27:55,300
Just saying.

2457
02:27:55,300 --> 02:27:56,300
Agreed.

2458
02:27:56,300 --> 02:27:59,980
Well, what are we missing?

2459
02:27:59,980 --> 02:28:03,220
You're playing Phantasy Star Online 2 obviously, what are the rest of us missing?

2460
02:28:03,220 --> 02:28:06,340
I really want to check it out at some point.

2461
02:28:06,340 --> 02:28:08,340
You mean in the game or other games?

2462
02:28:08,340 --> 02:28:09,340
Yeah, in the game.

2463
02:28:09,340 --> 02:28:11,900
In Phantasy Star Online 2, how is it?

2464
02:28:11,900 --> 02:28:18,660
It is what I would consider to be a very faithful upgrade from the original game that came out

2465
02:28:18,660 --> 02:28:21,220
back in 2000.

2466
02:28:21,220 --> 02:28:28,420
The character creator is, I'd say, even better than what you get out of Skyrim.

2467
02:28:28,420 --> 02:28:35,660
The level design is superb in that even though it's randomized, it's still got a lot of

2468
02:28:35,660 --> 02:28:42,740
familiar elements, and you can just randomly encounter a boss outside of the boss nets.

2469
02:28:42,740 --> 02:28:43,740
It's just crazy.

2470
02:28:43,740 --> 02:28:48,060
Does this mean that you can make the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in Phantasy Star Online 2?

2471
02:28:48,060 --> 02:28:53,460
I doubt it, but can I still headshot a Rappy?

2472
02:28:53,460 --> 02:28:57,380
You can definitely spend at least an hour per character just building it.

2473
02:28:57,380 --> 02:28:59,620
How many Rappys can I expect to kill?

2474
02:28:59,620 --> 02:29:00,620
Tons.

2475
02:29:00,620 --> 02:29:01,620
Yes!

2476
02:29:01,620 --> 02:29:04,220
I hate those things.

2477
02:29:04,220 --> 02:29:09,060
And they still play dead and then get back up and you can shoot them again or whatever.

2478
02:29:09,060 --> 02:29:14,660
My friend actually spent $100 to buy a Rappy plushie.

2479
02:29:14,660 --> 02:29:18,260
Is there a big English-speaking presence on the game?

2480
02:29:18,260 --> 02:29:21,700
Are there a lot of people like you who are playing it even though it's not out in this

2481
02:29:21,700 --> 02:29:22,860
country?

2482
02:29:22,860 --> 02:29:27,820
Not only is there an English presence, there is a fan patch available for English so that

2483
02:29:27,820 --> 02:29:31,900
you can translate a good bunch of the game into English.

2484
02:29:31,900 --> 02:29:34,940
That's pretty awesome.

2485
02:29:34,940 --> 02:29:35,940
That's a fan thing.

2486
02:29:35,940 --> 02:29:38,380
That's not something Sega sanctioned, right?

2487
02:29:38,380 --> 02:29:39,380
Exactly.

2488
02:29:39,380 --> 02:29:46,860
Basically, people got fed up with how long it was taken, so they just ran with it, basically.

2489
02:29:46,860 --> 02:29:47,860
Fan communities do amazing things.

2490
02:29:47,860 --> 02:29:51,900
I honestly don't see Sega really having too big of a problem with it, to be honest.

2491
02:29:51,900 --> 02:29:55,340
Because, I mean, remember the support that they gave when they closed down the original

2492
02:29:55,340 --> 02:29:57,060
Phantasy Star Online servers?

2493
02:29:57,060 --> 02:29:58,220
That's true.

2494
02:29:58,220 --> 02:30:02,060
They did open up the Japanese form.

2495
02:30:02,060 --> 02:30:03,060
Exactly.

2496
02:30:03,060 --> 02:30:09,260
But they also provided US players with the data for their character to transfer to private

2497
02:30:09,260 --> 02:30:12,100
servers.

2498
02:30:12,100 --> 02:30:13,460
I didn't think that happened.

2499
02:30:13,460 --> 02:30:15,900
I thought that was something that fans were hoping for.

2500
02:30:15,900 --> 02:30:16,900
No.

2501
02:30:16,900 --> 02:30:20,260
Because I was going to do it, but I ended up just sort of not caring because I hadn't

2502
02:30:20,260 --> 02:30:22,880
been playing Phantasy Star Online for a little while.

2503
02:30:22,880 --> 02:30:29,840
But they were allowing full character transfers into private servers.

2504
02:30:29,840 --> 02:30:35,160
It was a limited window that they did it, but they had it available.

2505
02:30:35,160 --> 02:30:36,600
I'll have to look that up again.

2506
02:30:36,600 --> 02:30:37,600
All right.

2507
02:30:37,600 --> 02:30:39,260
Well, Prince Brightstar, thanks so much for the call.

2508
02:30:39,260 --> 02:30:40,680
It's good to hear from you for so long.

2509
02:30:40,680 --> 02:30:41,680
So welcome back.

2510
02:30:41,680 --> 02:30:42,680
Yep.

2511
02:30:42,680 --> 02:30:46,320
I'm probably going to be here every week for a good bit here.

2512
02:30:46,320 --> 02:30:47,320
Awesome.

2513
02:30:47,320 --> 02:30:48,320
Appreciate the support.

2514
02:30:48,320 --> 02:30:49,320
Well, you have a good one.

2515
02:30:49,320 --> 02:30:50,320
Okay, buddy?

2516
02:30:50,320 --> 02:30:51,320
You too.

2517
02:30:51,320 --> 02:30:52,320
All right.

2518
02:30:52,760 --> 02:30:57,160
I think that's really awesome for somebody that's like, you know, I fell out of the habit

2519
02:30:57,160 --> 02:30:58,160
or whatever.

2520
02:30:58,160 --> 02:31:00,560
Real life gets in the way and you don't end up listening to the show anymore.

2521
02:31:00,560 --> 02:31:01,560
It's cool.

2522
02:31:01,560 --> 02:31:04,280
But then it's like, after all this time, it's like, wow, I came back and y'all are still

2523
02:31:04,280 --> 02:31:05,280
here.

2524
02:31:05,280 --> 02:31:07,040
And it hasn't really changed that much.

2525
02:31:07,040 --> 02:31:09,080
You know, it's a really awesome thing to hear.

2526
02:31:09,080 --> 02:31:11,480
So thank you very much.

2527
02:31:11,480 --> 02:31:14,920
We outlived Tech TV G4.

2528
02:31:14,920 --> 02:31:18,520
All right.

2529
02:31:18,520 --> 02:31:20,080
Let's see if we get a few more tweets out here.

2530
02:31:20,080 --> 02:31:23,680
I don't know if there's any other last minute stories, but quickly, some more tweets from

2531
02:31:23,680 --> 02:31:24,680
Tiger Claw.

2532
02:31:24,680 --> 02:31:29,320
Centipede creator sees lack of diversity in the game industry.

2533
02:31:29,320 --> 02:31:30,320
Hmm.

2534
02:31:30,320 --> 02:31:34,600
Is that just because it's SQL SQL SQL SQL milking out the IPs?

2535
02:31:34,600 --> 02:31:35,600
That's my assumption here.

2536
02:31:35,600 --> 02:31:36,600
Hold on.

2537
02:31:36,600 --> 02:31:37,600
I'm bringing up the article here.

2538
02:31:37,600 --> 02:31:38,600
Why would anyone be surprised by that?

2539
02:31:38,600 --> 02:31:43,320
I haven't seen these because they're tweeted to me.

2540
02:31:43,320 --> 02:31:44,640
It's also depending on where you're looking.

2541
02:31:44,640 --> 02:31:47,400
I mean, if you're looking at mainstream gaming, then yeah.

2542
02:31:47,400 --> 02:31:48,400
Okay.

2543
02:31:48,560 --> 02:31:51,400
Here's the headline they're pulling that quote from or I mean, here's the quote they're pulling

2544
02:31:51,400 --> 02:31:52,880
the headline from.

2545
02:31:52,880 --> 02:31:56,700
So much progress has been made in the development cycle and the way games are developed.

2546
02:31:56,700 --> 02:32:01,360
This is according to industry button Dona Bailey.

2547
02:32:01,360 --> 02:32:05,520
It seems there hasn't been enough progress in the diversity of game designers and gender

2548
02:32:05,520 --> 02:32:08,800
equality for game designers.

2549
02:32:08,800 --> 02:32:10,760
Hmm.

2550
02:32:10,760 --> 02:32:12,760
Hmm.

2551
02:32:12,760 --> 02:32:14,120
That does make sense.

2552
02:32:14,120 --> 02:32:15,640
And I probably totally butchered the name.

2553
02:32:15,640 --> 02:32:18,880
It's probably Donna Bailey, but I said it wrong because it's spelled a little differently

2554
02:32:18,880 --> 02:32:19,880
than what I'm used to.

2555
02:32:19,880 --> 02:32:21,880
So Hmm.

2556
02:32:21,880 --> 02:32:27,600
Well, sadly, it's something you know, it's not like we haven't heard it before.

2557
02:32:27,600 --> 02:32:33,320
But I think the best way to help combat that a little bit is prove some of these analysts

2558
02:32:33,320 --> 02:32:34,320
wrong.

2559
02:32:34,320 --> 02:32:38,920
The people that say that, you know, the masses won't support a game with a strong female

2560
02:32:38,920 --> 02:32:40,140
lead and so forth.

2561
02:32:40,140 --> 02:32:43,700
It's important that and I'm not saying you have to support a game just because it has

2562
02:32:43,700 --> 02:32:45,040
a female lead.

2563
02:32:45,480 --> 02:32:49,840
Find the one that you like and really rally behind it and you know, gather support for

2564
02:32:49,840 --> 02:32:51,860
it and so forth and show these guys they're wrong.

2565
02:32:51,860 --> 02:32:55,360
I honestly think that we need to see more games that give you a choice.

2566
02:32:55,360 --> 02:32:56,360
Hmm.

2567
02:32:56,360 --> 02:33:00,120
Well, I made I made this comment during Bobby show and I think it's it's worth kind of exploring

2568
02:33:00,120 --> 02:33:01,120
a little bit.

2569
02:33:01,120 --> 02:33:04,140
I'll bring this up with you, Jamie, is that it's obviously part of a larger problem with

2570
02:33:04,140 --> 02:33:09,360
society and my whole thing is that let's take the dude bros who buy Xbox and I'm totally

2571
02:33:09,360 --> 02:33:11,520
stereotyping here guys bear with me.

2572
02:33:11,520 --> 02:33:15,320
Let's take the dude bros that buy their Xboxes because they're only interested in Madden

2573
02:33:15,320 --> 02:33:19,040
games and the basketball games and all the sports games that come out every year.

2574
02:33:19,040 --> 02:33:23,880
Well, you can't play as a woman in Madden, but that's not video games fault.

2575
02:33:23,880 --> 02:33:24,880
That's football.

2576
02:33:24,880 --> 02:33:25,880
Right.

2577
02:33:25,880 --> 02:33:31,300
So I mean, but what if the NFL were to have a woman come into the league someday?

2578
02:33:31,300 --> 02:33:35,720
You know, there's a woman that that is that that is a strong football player and you know,

2579
02:33:35,720 --> 02:33:40,280
gets on a team and now you can play as a woman in Madden that that right there would break

2580
02:33:40,280 --> 02:33:41,880
down a barrier.

2581
02:33:41,880 --> 02:33:42,880
It would.

2582
02:33:42,880 --> 02:33:45,200
But I don't see it happening just because of that.

2583
02:33:45,200 --> 02:33:48,080
I mean, we're in a total patriarchal society right now.

2584
02:33:48,080 --> 02:33:49,080
Not just right now.

2585
02:33:49,080 --> 02:33:50,640
We've always been.

2586
02:33:50,640 --> 02:33:54,220
And it's completely disgusting.

2587
02:33:54,220 --> 02:34:02,600
And I'm going to say one thing that there are there there are degrees of this physical

2588
02:34:02,600 --> 02:34:05,500
expectation that's put out for sports.

2589
02:34:05,500 --> 02:34:11,320
But I've seen some women's NBA players who could totally school guys.

2590
02:34:11,320 --> 02:34:13,220
I mean, I don't see why we don't have an integrated team.

2591
02:34:13,220 --> 02:34:16,800
You look in the four and you hate to go refer to the movie, but you remember a league of

2592
02:34:16,800 --> 02:34:17,800
their own.

2593
02:34:17,800 --> 02:34:18,800
Yeah, sure.

2594
02:34:18,800 --> 02:34:20,340
That should happen where all men were in war.

2595
02:34:20,340 --> 02:34:22,860
They had female baseball teams fully on.

2596
02:34:22,860 --> 02:34:24,820
And then the WNBA is a thing.

2597
02:34:24,820 --> 02:34:25,820
Well, yeah, it is.

2598
02:34:25,820 --> 02:34:30,500
But I mean, I'm saying that it's not like we haven't had a precedent for having women

2599
02:34:30,500 --> 02:34:33,900
in sports or even having integrated sports teams like that.

2600
02:34:33,900 --> 02:34:39,740
It's just that people have this notion that it shouldn't be done, that it can't be done,

2601
02:34:39,740 --> 02:34:40,900
that there's a big physical difference.

2602
02:34:40,900 --> 02:34:42,500
Say that you get China out.

2603
02:34:42,500 --> 02:34:47,420
OK, I hate to use it, you know, old wash up wrestler, but say you have China, who, yes,

2604
02:34:47,420 --> 02:34:50,480
true, she did lots and lots of steroids, but she's got the bulk.

2605
02:34:50,480 --> 02:34:51,660
She's got the strength for it.

2606
02:34:51,660 --> 02:34:53,100
She wrestles dudes.

2607
02:34:53,100 --> 02:34:54,100
Well, she did.

2608
02:34:54,100 --> 02:34:56,180
Isn't she in TNA now, I think?

2609
02:34:56,180 --> 02:35:00,660
Anyway, but I mean, you've got someone with that type of physical capability who can stand

2610
02:35:00,660 --> 02:35:02,100
up with the guys.

2611
02:35:02,100 --> 02:35:09,940
I think that if a person is physically capable of being a part of whatever that sport is,

2612
02:35:09,940 --> 02:35:18,740
whatever that event is, they should be allowed to be in it without having to deal with judgment

2613
02:35:18,740 --> 02:35:22,700
because of their gender or because of any other factor.

2614
02:35:22,700 --> 02:35:24,300
By the way, I did close the Skype line for now.

2615
02:35:24,300 --> 02:35:26,300
I didn't mean to get on this discussion, but it's a good one.

2616
02:35:26,300 --> 02:35:29,420
So I'm sorry to those who didn't get through on Skype, but feel free to email us.

2617
02:35:29,420 --> 02:35:31,860
Mailbag at orangesontrated.com.

2618
02:35:31,860 --> 02:35:33,580
Comment from ShadowNextGen.

2619
02:35:33,580 --> 02:35:37,880
Has Dark Sakura seen how the UFC has started highlighting women's MMA?

2620
02:35:37,880 --> 02:35:41,560
The next season of the Ultimate Fighter has two female coaches that will coach both men

2621
02:35:41,560 --> 02:35:42,560
and women.

2622
02:35:42,560 --> 02:35:43,900
Just curious about your thoughts.

2623
02:35:43,900 --> 02:35:46,100
I actually don't watch much UFC.

2624
02:35:46,100 --> 02:35:51,620
I tried watching when, oh God, what was his name that was in WWF?

2625
02:35:51,620 --> 02:35:58,080
He, God, I can't, cause he was just like the most boring dude ever, but he was amazing

2626
02:35:58,080 --> 02:35:59,080
to watch.

2627
02:35:59,080 --> 02:36:02,080
I watched from UFC and then I think went back to UFC.

2628
02:36:02,080 --> 02:36:08,080
And I also watched when Brock Lesnar went to UFC for a little while, dude, he was vicious.

2629
02:36:08,080 --> 02:36:11,020
But I didn't really, I haven't kept up with it.

2630
02:36:11,020 --> 02:36:14,140
Let me ask a real weird question that might be a little bit.

2631
02:36:14,140 --> 02:36:16,760
And I'm not talking about Brock Lesnar, I'm talking about somebody else.

2632
02:36:16,760 --> 02:36:19,600
Let me ask you a weird question that might be a little bit off the wall and it might

2633
02:36:19,600 --> 02:36:24,560
even be a little bit difficult, but it's honestly something I'm wondering and I want to ask

2634
02:36:24,560 --> 02:36:25,560
a girl.

2635
02:36:25,560 --> 02:36:26,560
Okay.

2636
02:36:26,560 --> 02:36:27,560
Sorry.

2637
02:36:27,560 --> 02:36:28,560
I'm doing both.

2638
02:36:29,040 --> 02:36:30,040
Pay attention to me.

2639
02:36:30,040 --> 02:36:31,040
Okay.

2640
02:36:31,040 --> 02:36:32,040
But yes, it was Ken Shamrock.

2641
02:36:32,040 --> 02:36:36,920
So female sports people that have broken through, one of them I think of that I think a lot

2642
02:36:36,920 --> 02:36:40,000
of us think of is Danica Patrick in NASCAR, right?

2643
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:45,240
Well, Danica Patrick is playable in a video game, but it's Sonic's All-Stars Racing, which

2644
02:36:45,240 --> 02:36:48,640
is a great game, but it's kind of cutesy lala.

2645
02:36:48,640 --> 02:36:52,520
You know, she's sitting there aside a lot of, you know, Sonic and a lot of cartoony

2646
02:36:52,520 --> 02:36:53,520
people.

2647
02:36:53,640 --> 02:37:00,160
Does this do the image of the woman in sports favors or does it hurt because, well, Danica

2648
02:37:00,160 --> 02:37:02,960
Patrick's in a game, but it's cutesy lala land.

2649
02:37:02,960 --> 02:37:05,640
Well, it's definitely not hurting her wallet.

2650
02:37:05,640 --> 02:37:07,040
Okay.

2651
02:37:07,040 --> 02:37:09,780
Props for that, right?

2652
02:37:09,780 --> 02:37:15,480
I don't look at it so much as a hindrance, although it is, I think going back to a little

2653
02:37:15,480 --> 02:37:17,600
bit more on the stereotype.

2654
02:37:17,600 --> 02:37:22,920
I think it's definitely getting her some, getting her exposure apart from just being

2655
02:37:22,920 --> 02:37:24,640
pretty awesome on her own.

2656
02:37:24,640 --> 02:37:31,280
I mean, aren't we now seeing like more women in NASCAR too, like more female drivers?

2657
02:37:31,280 --> 02:37:33,160
She's certainly not the last.

2658
02:37:33,160 --> 02:37:34,160
I know.

2659
02:37:34,160 --> 02:37:37,000
Well, I think that we, there was one who, God, I don't remember.

2660
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:41,200
There's one who has, I think an F1 going into F1 circuit.

2661
02:37:41,200 --> 02:37:43,160
Dan would know more about this than I do since he watches Top Gear.

2662
02:37:43,160 --> 02:37:45,920
Yeah, I don't even really watch NASCAR, but I know about this one.

2663
02:37:45,920 --> 02:37:50,120
There's also that lady who sometimes goes on Jeremy Clarkson's show.

2664
02:37:50,120 --> 02:37:55,000
She's one of the hosts of British Top Gear and she's a driver.

2665
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:56,120
She's amazing too.

2666
02:37:56,120 --> 02:37:57,120
Yeah.

2667
02:37:57,120 --> 02:37:59,560
And Bobby points out too, Danica wasn't the first female driver either.

2668
02:37:59,560 --> 02:38:00,560
She wasn't the first.

2669
02:38:00,560 --> 02:38:02,360
I just said she wasn't the last.

2670
02:38:02,360 --> 02:38:03,360
She wouldn't be left.

2671
02:38:03,360 --> 02:38:09,560
But my problem with Danica Patrick is that she is having to rely on stereotypes to keep

2672
02:38:09,560 --> 02:38:11,360
her popularity up.

2673
02:38:11,360 --> 02:38:16,420
You know, that whole, well, you got to show a little boob or you got to, you know, be

2674
02:38:16,420 --> 02:38:17,900
this.

2675
02:38:18,460 --> 02:38:20,660
You can't be just a talented driver.

2676
02:38:20,660 --> 02:38:23,180
You have to be a sex symbol too.

2677
02:38:23,180 --> 02:38:24,180
That I hate.

2678
02:38:24,180 --> 02:38:25,380
I hate, I hate, I hate.

2679
02:38:25,380 --> 02:38:29,460
And some people really, like you've got Rasteel UT in chat who says Danica Patrick didn't

2680
02:38:29,460 --> 02:38:32,540
break through because of her racing, she broke through because she sexualizes herself in

2681
02:38:32,540 --> 02:38:33,540
GoDaddy commercials.

2682
02:38:33,540 --> 02:38:38,500
So you've got, you know, people that kind of resent the whole T and A, if you will.

2683
02:38:38,500 --> 02:38:43,620
Well, I mean, and I'm even going to go into another, cause one of my heroes, cause you

2684
02:38:43,620 --> 02:38:49,620
know I've been trying to work out a lot more, is a weightlifter named Samantha Wright.

2685
02:38:49,620 --> 02:38:51,940
And she is adorable.

2686
02:38:51,940 --> 02:38:53,720
She's probably my height.

2687
02:38:53,720 --> 02:38:58,260
And I think that if I kept working out like she, you know, clearly does, I would probably

2688
02:38:58,260 --> 02:38:59,940
have, would be about the same build.

2689
02:38:59,940 --> 02:39:04,940
So she's been, I've looked at her because we do have a lot of physical traits in common.

2690
02:39:04,940 --> 02:39:11,860
I think that her body type would be a good ideal for me as far as working out and health.

2691
02:39:11,860 --> 02:39:16,860
Now she's getting all this extra attention because she is so absolutely adorable.

2692
02:39:16,860 --> 02:39:18,820
She is pretty.

2693
02:39:18,820 --> 02:39:19,820
She's pretty hot.

2694
02:39:19,820 --> 02:39:23,820
I mean, I will say that, but there've been other female weightlifters who have been just

2695
02:39:23,820 --> 02:39:27,620
as, if not more talented, if not stronger than her.

2696
02:39:27,620 --> 02:39:32,020
And if you look at people who are actually physically strong, and I'm not talking about

2697
02:39:32,020 --> 02:39:38,260
the people who, you know, are those muscle competitions, cause they starve themselves

2698
02:39:38,260 --> 02:39:39,260
to nothing.

2699
02:39:39,260 --> 02:39:42,780
They are at their least healthy when they're at a show.

2700
02:39:42,780 --> 02:39:45,820
You look at the actual strong people, the people who do the strong man contest who are

2701
02:39:45,820 --> 02:39:50,120
pulling semis with their body weight, they're built like trunks.

2702
02:39:50,120 --> 02:39:56,280
And the women who participate in these, they're built like, you know, complete.

2703
02:39:56,280 --> 02:40:00,080
It's funny you bring up the bodybuilding because it brings to mind one of, I think a great

2704
02:40:00,080 --> 02:40:04,680
example of where there were very memorable men and women in this, and I'm using this

2705
02:40:04,680 --> 02:40:08,820
term very loosely with my quotey fingers, sport, American gladiators.

2706
02:40:08,820 --> 02:40:09,820
Yeah.

2707
02:40:09,820 --> 02:40:12,140
Cause there were memorable men and women on that show.

2708
02:40:12,140 --> 02:40:15,900
I mean, it was really like an equal playing field of sorts.

2709
02:40:15,900 --> 02:40:19,180
I can tell you one thing about that, and just because I learned how to recognize it, oddly

2710
02:40:19,180 --> 02:40:24,380
enough when I worked at GNC, because we would have so many roided guys come in, teenagers

2711
02:40:24,380 --> 02:40:29,140
take in that andro because of, what was that stupid baseball player?

2712
02:40:29,140 --> 02:40:30,500
Fuck whatever his name was.

2713
02:40:30,500 --> 02:40:37,060
So anyway, there's a way to tell when a woman is roided.

2714
02:40:37,100 --> 02:40:41,300
There were some women on that show who were very naturally strong.

2715
02:40:41,300 --> 02:40:43,860
They looked like a strong woman.

2716
02:40:43,860 --> 02:40:48,500
You want to see what a woman looks like without steroids, who has worked out, who has a small

2717
02:40:48,500 --> 02:40:50,500
frame, Linda Hamilton and Terminator 2.

2718
02:40:50,500 --> 02:40:52,300
But I mean, I'm serious.

2719
02:40:52,300 --> 02:40:55,460
And that honestly, to me, people are like, oh, she looks so bulky.

2720
02:40:55,460 --> 02:40:57,020
I thought that was really attractive.

2721
02:40:57,020 --> 02:40:59,620
I thought that looking strong was a very good thing.

2722
02:40:59,620 --> 02:41:00,620
Yeah.

2723
02:41:00,620 --> 02:41:01,620
Martin McGuire.

2724
02:41:01,620 --> 02:41:02,620
Thank you.

2725
02:41:02,620 --> 02:41:04,300
Not Barry Bonds.

2726
02:41:04,300 --> 02:41:09,460
But then you had the other ones like, and I'm going to go back to using China.

2727
02:41:09,460 --> 02:41:14,500
A woman cannot carry that type of muscle structure naturally without having a genetic predisposition

2728
02:41:14,500 --> 02:41:15,560
towards it.

2729
02:41:15,560 --> 02:41:21,680
And you can tell how many people are augmented who have a breast enhancement surgery on top

2730
02:41:21,680 --> 02:41:29,860
of having taken steroids because it will very much give more masculine traits to a woman

2731
02:41:29,860 --> 02:41:34,580
because you're basically taking Jose Canseco.

2732
02:41:34,580 --> 02:41:39,780
I'm just giggling because some of our chatters are like, you know, AgDef's all sports lounge

2733
02:41:39,780 --> 02:41:40,780
radio.

2734
02:41:40,780 --> 02:41:42,060
I didn't mean to get this on this big tangent.

2735
02:41:42,060 --> 02:41:46,600
My whole point with this before we just kind of went on and on and on with it.

2736
02:41:46,600 --> 02:41:53,460
My whole point was the whole female leads in video games and we don't have enough of

2737
02:41:53,460 --> 02:41:55,340
them.

2738
02:41:55,340 --> 02:41:57,480
It's not right that that's happening.

2739
02:41:57,480 --> 02:42:01,840
But my point I'm making with it is that I think it's a reflection of a much larger problem

2740
02:42:01,840 --> 02:42:02,840
with society.

2741
02:42:02,840 --> 02:42:04,880
It's not specific to video games.

2742
02:42:04,880 --> 02:42:06,480
I didn't mean to go off on the other.

2743
02:42:06,480 --> 02:42:07,480
But no, no, no.

2744
02:42:07,480 --> 02:42:08,560
I mean, I think we agree.

2745
02:42:08,560 --> 02:42:09,560
Yeah.

2746
02:42:09,560 --> 02:42:15,760
The whole point is that, and this I think is going really towards anything, is that

2747
02:42:15,760 --> 02:42:21,520
unless you have, even the really brilliant women out there, like just even in academia,

2748
02:42:21,520 --> 02:42:25,640
are not drawing the biggest attention, are not being taken seriously if they don't also

2749
02:42:25,640 --> 02:42:30,500
have a certain type of aesthetic, you know, appearance to them.

2750
02:42:30,500 --> 02:42:36,900
And it's really a very sad thing because you can have, pardon me for saying this, the dumpiest

2751
02:42:36,900 --> 02:42:37,900
looking guy ever.

2752
02:42:37,900 --> 02:42:45,520
You can have neck bearded, you know, guy shorter than me waddling in and be taken completely

2753
02:42:45,520 --> 02:42:48,520
seriously just because he's a guy.

2754
02:42:48,520 --> 02:42:53,720
But if you had a woman who maybe was, you know, maybe a little overweight, maybe, you

2755
02:42:53,720 --> 02:43:00,600
know, a little gray, a few wrinkles here and there, even if she had three times the degree

2756
02:43:00,600 --> 02:43:04,640
this guy did and had done all this fantastic biomedical research, on appearances alone

2757
02:43:04,640 --> 02:43:08,280
she wouldn't be taken seriously by the majority of people.

2758
02:43:08,280 --> 02:43:12,000
And that's where I think that we're getting into the really sad part.

2759
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:15,640
And it doesn't, and like I said, it's not just affecting our gaming world.

2760
02:43:15,640 --> 02:43:18,500
It's affecting culture across the board.

2761
02:43:18,500 --> 02:43:24,640
And I get absolutely so sick of living in this society sometimes just because of it.

2762
02:43:24,640 --> 02:43:26,260
I did think of another positive though.

2763
02:43:26,260 --> 02:43:30,020
I did think of another place where I think it's done well, where we get male and female

2764
02:43:30,020 --> 02:43:34,700
sports heroes that we failed to mention because this is one of the few sporting events I really

2765
02:43:34,700 --> 02:43:35,820
truly enjoy watching.

2766
02:43:35,820 --> 02:43:36,820
The Olympics.

2767
02:43:36,820 --> 02:43:37,820
Yeah.

2768
02:43:37,820 --> 02:43:43,500
I think the Olympics are great because you get a lot of, you get a lot of strong athletes

2769
02:43:43,500 --> 02:43:47,120
no matter what, you know, from all these different types of sports and great stories and things.

2770
02:43:47,120 --> 02:43:48,120
That's a great thing.

2771
02:43:48,120 --> 02:43:49,120
So.

2772
02:43:49,120 --> 02:43:52,880
But, you know, even then I hear, um, what was it on NBC?

2773
02:43:52,880 --> 02:43:57,720
Well, you know, the coverage of the Olympics this past one was dreadful to save the values.

2774
02:43:57,720 --> 02:44:00,320
Yeah, but that's, that's, that's, that's another issue.

2775
02:44:00,320 --> 02:44:04,320
But what I'm saying is that you, you get side commentary from people.

2776
02:44:04,320 --> 02:44:08,440
Like I would go and look at, you know, YouTube videos of some of the events because I wasn't

2777
02:44:08,440 --> 02:44:10,040
keeping up with it all the time.

2778
02:44:10,040 --> 02:44:14,900
And I would see comments, oh, well, she looks like, you know, a dude or she looks this or

2779
02:44:14,900 --> 02:44:15,900
she looks that.

2780
02:44:15,900 --> 02:44:21,020
I would go into a Southern accent when I imitate a stupid person, but, but you still

2781
02:44:21,020 --> 02:44:25,900
get that as trying to ascribe aesthetics to what should have nothing to do with it.

2782
02:44:25,900 --> 02:44:26,900
Yeah.

2783
02:44:26,900 --> 02:44:27,900
Yeah.

2784
02:44:27,900 --> 02:44:29,900
Anyhow, tangent train, tangent lounge radio.

2785
02:44:29,900 --> 02:44:31,500
That was a good discussion though.

2786
02:44:31,500 --> 02:44:32,500
Sorry.

2787
02:44:32,500 --> 02:44:33,500
Oh.

2788
02:44:33,500 --> 02:44:34,500
And, uh, some of the chatters talking about tennis.

2789
02:44:34,500 --> 02:44:35,500
That is a really good example too.

2790
02:44:35,500 --> 02:44:36,500
Tennis.

2791
02:44:36,500 --> 02:44:37,500
Tennis has a lot of good people.

2792
02:44:37,500 --> 02:44:38,500
Mixed doubles is pretty fun actually.

2793
02:44:38,500 --> 02:44:39,500
Yeah.

2794
02:44:39,500 --> 02:44:40,500
Yeah.

2795
02:44:40,500 --> 02:44:41,500
Yeah.

2796
02:44:41,500 --> 02:44:42,500
So good, good job chatters.

2797
02:44:42,500 --> 02:44:43,500
All right.

2798
02:44:43,500 --> 02:44:44,500
Anyhow.

2799
02:44:44,500 --> 02:44:45,500
Rob turned on my ranty switch.

2800
02:44:46,100 --> 02:44:47,100
We'll be back with more details next week.

2801
02:44:47,100 --> 02:44:50,680
Mailbag at orange lounge, radio.com, but for now we have got to wrap up the show and say

2802
02:44:50,680 --> 02:44:51,680
good night.

2803
02:44:51,680 --> 02:44:54,060
Um, Oh, I didn't get, I may not have got all the Twitter topics.

2804
02:44:54,060 --> 02:44:55,060
I'm sorry.

2805
02:44:55,060 --> 02:44:56,940
Let me quickly try to grab some of these.

2806
02:44:56,940 --> 02:45:00,980
Uh, as Joan Hunter, Matt tweeting, one of the most popular card games is being made

2807
02:45:00,980 --> 02:45:05,980
into a game for three 60 Steve Jackson's munchkin.

2808
02:45:05,980 --> 02:45:06,980
I don't know.

2809
02:45:06,980 --> 02:45:11,580
Apparently a link on ain't it cool news of all places.

2810
02:45:11,580 --> 02:45:14,120
That site's been going on forever too.

2811
02:45:14,120 --> 02:45:16,200
So huh.

2812
02:45:16,200 --> 02:45:17,200
Very interesting.

2813
02:45:17,200 --> 02:45:18,200
Yeah.

2814
02:45:18,200 --> 02:45:21,300
Munchkin, the video game.

2815
02:45:21,300 --> 02:45:22,300
That's cool.

2816
02:45:22,300 --> 02:45:23,300
That'd be very cool.

2817
02:45:23,300 --> 02:45:24,640
All right.

2818
02:45:24,640 --> 02:45:27,380
That is, I'm going to put the, I'm going to put the phone down and no more Twitter topics

2819
02:45:27,380 --> 02:45:28,380
for tonight.

2820
02:45:28,380 --> 02:45:29,380
Twitter.com slash OLR though.

2821
02:45:29,380 --> 02:45:32,940
If you want to send us stuff for the future, uh, I'll get off my feminist pedestal for

2822
02:45:32,940 --> 02:45:33,940
right now.

2823
02:45:33,940 --> 02:45:34,940
There's nothing wrong with it.

2824
02:45:34,940 --> 02:45:38,240
It was, it was a, it was a discussion that needed to be had.

2825
02:45:38,240 --> 02:45:39,240
All right.

2826
02:45:39,240 --> 02:45:40,660
Let's uh, let's wrap up though.

2827
02:45:40,660 --> 02:45:41,660
We're about done.

2828
02:45:41,660 --> 02:45:43,160
We're closing up shop for the night.

2829
02:45:43,200 --> 02:45:46,880
Loki, you've been quiet over there while dark soccer and I've been, yep, yep, yep, and uh,

2830
02:45:46,880 --> 02:45:48,800
did you have a good time tonight?

2831
02:45:48,800 --> 02:45:49,800
Yeah.

2832
02:45:49,800 --> 02:45:50,800
All right.

2833
02:45:50,800 --> 02:45:51,800
Good.

2834
02:45:51,800 --> 02:45:52,800
All right.

2835
02:45:52,800 --> 02:45:53,800
Do you have any final thoughts for listeners tonight as we're on our way out?

2836
02:45:53,800 --> 02:45:57,000
Uh, I'm probably not going to play Minecraft every single day this week.

2837
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:59,080
I get boring since there's no one else on there.

2838
02:45:59,080 --> 02:46:00,080
Play two days this week.

2839
02:46:00,080 --> 02:46:01,080
Two or three.

2840
02:46:01,080 --> 02:46:02,080
Yeah.

2841
02:46:02,080 --> 02:46:03,080
That sounds good.

2842
02:46:03,080 --> 02:46:05,600
Um, so I guess I'll play some defiance then.

2843
02:46:05,600 --> 02:46:08,080
We should set up some time to live stream Minecraft.

2844
02:46:08,080 --> 02:46:09,080
That's that's where everything's going.

2845
02:46:09,080 --> 02:46:11,400
Like all of a sudden all the VOD people just got really into light.

2846
02:46:11,400 --> 02:46:12,400
Like Bobby's doing it.

2847
02:46:12,400 --> 02:46:13,400
Jamie's doing it.

2848
02:46:13,400 --> 02:46:14,400
I'm doing it.

2849
02:46:14,400 --> 02:46:15,400
Yeah.

2850
02:46:15,400 --> 02:46:16,400
See, that's the things I didn't know.

2851
02:46:16,400 --> 02:46:20,000
Like, I don't really know like when to be on when no one else is on.

2852
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:24,400
Well, I think it's inevitable that some of us are like, I think I was trying to broadcast

2853
02:46:24,400 --> 02:46:25,400
when Jamie was on.

2854
02:46:25,400 --> 02:46:27,980
It's just, I didn't know she was, you know, like it's inevitable.

2855
02:46:27,980 --> 02:46:30,420
Some of us are going to step on toes, but I think it's a general rule of thumb.

2856
02:46:30,420 --> 02:46:35,120
We just try not to be live when a live, when, excuse me, a premier vlog show is on.

2857
02:46:35,120 --> 02:46:38,360
So like Monday nights are usually really bad, but you know, as long as we're not stepping

2858
02:46:38,360 --> 02:46:41,400
on the toes of, of you do commentary, do you do not?

2859
02:46:41,400 --> 02:46:42,400
Do you not do commentary?

2860
02:46:42,400 --> 02:46:43,720
What do you, what are you guys doing?

2861
02:46:43,720 --> 02:46:45,540
I mean, like I do commentary.

2862
02:46:45,540 --> 02:46:46,760
She does commentary.

2863
02:46:46,760 --> 02:46:50,720
Uh, when I was watching Bobby, he had very little commentary, but they, they have had

2864
02:46:50,720 --> 02:46:51,720
some commentary.

2865
02:46:51,720 --> 02:46:55,760
But the problem is though, is once again, it's the whole talking in the same room with

2866
02:46:55,760 --> 02:46:56,760
my wife.

2867
02:46:56,760 --> 02:47:00,760
She gets annoyed even if I'm in like in the back bedroom or something like that, it would

2868
02:47:00,760 --> 02:47:01,760
just, I could try it.

2869
02:47:01,760 --> 02:47:02,760
I'm sure it'd be fine.

2870
02:47:02,760 --> 02:47:08,160
Um, so yeah, I'll hopefully start doing some of that and maybe sell more games this week.

2871
02:47:08,160 --> 02:47:10,440
One of those being injustice on three 60.

2872
02:47:10,440 --> 02:47:11,440
Wow.

2873
02:47:11,440 --> 02:47:12,440
I was, I want it.

2874
02:47:12,440 --> 02:47:13,440
Oh wait.

2875
02:47:13,440 --> 02:47:15,440
All my friends have it on PS three.

2876
02:47:15,440 --> 02:47:16,440
Son of a bitch.

2877
02:47:16,440 --> 02:47:17,440
Yeah.

2878
02:47:17,440 --> 02:47:19,440
Cause I got a copy for free and I don't want it.

2879
02:47:19,440 --> 02:47:24,560
Um, so cause I don't, I don't mind the fighting games, so it'll start at, it'll start at one

2880
02:47:24,560 --> 02:47:26,600
penny tomorrow.

2881
02:47:26,600 --> 02:47:28,480
Act F says we were doing commentary yesterday.

2882
02:47:28,480 --> 02:47:30,880
I missed your stream yesterday cause I was out drinking.

2883
02:47:30,880 --> 02:47:34,840
Grandpa was in town from San Francisco buying me doubles.

2884
02:47:34,840 --> 02:47:38,800
I got a little more drunk last night and I did on the 500th episode.

2885
02:47:38,800 --> 02:47:41,240
Sorry it wasn't broadcast, but it's for the best.

2886
02:47:41,240 --> 02:47:45,040
Um, my final thought tonight is thank you all for continuing to listen to orange lounge

2887
02:47:45,040 --> 02:47:50,480
radio and showing up for an episode like five Oh one right after 500, uh, whether it be

2888
02:47:50,480 --> 02:47:53,140
live, whether it be podcast, appreciate your support.

2889
02:47:53,140 --> 02:47:57,240
And I think I forgot to say this last week, which was really stupid, but I want to say

2890
02:47:57,240 --> 02:48:00,280
as always, thank you for checking out the show.

2891
02:48:00,280 --> 02:48:03,580
And if you like what you hear, remember we don't ask for a lot.

2892
02:48:03,580 --> 02:48:05,400
Just tell a friend or two about the show.

2893
02:48:05,400 --> 02:48:07,380
Help spread the word about orange laundry.

2894
02:48:07,380 --> 02:48:10,860
Tell a person who stopped listening five years ago, Hey, did you know those schmoes

2895
02:48:10,860 --> 02:48:15,120
are still on broadcasting and help bring people's back into the fold.

2896
02:48:15,120 --> 02:48:17,660
Help grow our family a little bit.

2897
02:48:17,660 --> 02:48:18,980
And last but not least, dark soccer.

2898
02:48:18,980 --> 02:48:24,460
Your final thought, um, down with the patriarchy.

2899
02:48:24,460 --> 02:48:25,460
There we go.

2900
02:48:25,460 --> 02:48:26,460
All right.

2901
02:48:26,460 --> 02:48:30,060
That does it for a this week here on orange lunch radio next week on the show.

2902
02:48:30,060 --> 02:48:32,540
I'm hoping we'll have some special guests here in studio.

2903
02:48:32,540 --> 02:48:33,820
Sounds like that's going to happen.

2904
02:48:33,820 --> 02:48:34,820
Very exciting.

2905
02:48:35,140 --> 02:48:41,180
Could be a long show next week and a pretty cool interview with, with two, two people.

2906
02:48:41,180 --> 02:48:42,880
I really enjoy next week.

2907
02:48:42,880 --> 02:48:48,640
So, uh, come, come here live, be here live to ask questions next week, six Pacific nine
